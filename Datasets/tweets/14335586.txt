If the slide to authoritarianism and tyranny is to be averted, Trump will need to be restrained – in the first place by Congress and hopefully the courts, but ultimately by the American people.
What's to stop the president from declaring an emergency and limiting the right to protest? 		To round up people of color en masse to combat purported gang activity?		To deploy the military on the streets to maintain order? 		To censor social media and Internet conversations?
If the president can merely cry “emergency” to override national law and contravene explicit congressional action – particularly when the claimed emergency is transparently fraudulent – then it is hard to know what limits exist on presidential power.
The danger of the #FakeTrumpEmergency to America is not limited to the outrage of wasting taxpayer money, or the immorality of building a wall that is designed only to symbolize disdain for and antagonism to people of color seeking refuge in our country.
The only crisis at the border is the buildup in Mexico of families seeking asylum in the United States —  but those people are seeking legal entry, and the crisis is due to the Trump administration’s refusal to afford them humane treatment.
The United States is a constitutional democracy, not a monarchy. If the Republican, Democratic and Independent members of Congress are to uphold their oath of office, they must act immediately to overturn Trump’s emergency declaration.
On behalf of several Texas landowners and a Texas environmental organization — both of which will experience firsthand the immediate impact of Trump's illegal emergency declaration, we will sue to challenge his unconstitutional attempt to circumvent the legislative process.

Without question, this is a dark time for our country and our democracy. But so long as we keep putting in the work, we will overturn #CitizensUnited and address the growing crisis of government capture by corporations and the super-rich.
None of this would have happened if we and allies hadn't launched the constitutional amendment campaign. Together, we’ve moved the issue to the mainstream of political discourse, an achievement that seemed impossible to many at the time of the #CitizensUnited decision.
In 2019, House Dems have made their first legislative priority (#HR1) a sweeping pro-democracy and anti-corruption package that includes support for a constitutional amendment overturning #CitizensUnited. https://t.co/Dcav9rh97w
In 2014, we won majority support in the Senate for an amendment overturning #CitizensUnited. In 2016, @SenSanders and @HillaryClinton each made support for a constitutional amendment a core component of their platforms.
✔️19 states—half the total we need to win approval—have passed resolutions supporting a constitutional amendment to overturn #CitizensUnited	 	✔️750 cities and towns across the US have approved resolutions	 	✔️Millions of Americans have signed petitions calling for an amendment
In the shadow of Donald Trump’s presidency, it’s easy to lose sight — but our constitutional amendment movement has done extraordinary things since the court handed down its #CitizensUnited decision on January 21, 2010:
Had the presidential election turned out differently, the Supreme Court would’ve likely overturned #CitizensUnited. But it didn’t—and there’s no reason to expect relief from SCOTUS anytime soon. That reality makes our movement to win a constitutional amendment all the more vital.
Until #CitizensUnited is overturned, the corporate oligarchy will maintain the power to block the policies favored by the majority of Americans — from raising the minimum wage to addressing catastrophic climate change, breaking up Wall Street banks to winning #MedicareForAll.
In the all-Trump media environment, it’s easy to think Trump himself is the source of all our problems. But it goes much deeper. So long as a handful of big money donors have outsized influence over who's elected and what's debated in Congress, our democracy will remain broken.

The good news in this leadership transition is that @MoveOn is populated by extraordinary staff and reliant on a committed membership of millions. Public Citizen is excited to continue fighting side by side with MoveOn in the days, weeks, months and years ahead.
Anna and Ilya have shepherded a generous and inclusive org that builds rather than dominates coalitions, elevates partners and especially the voices of disenfranchised communities, and supports and broadens the progressive movements that aim to make America what it should be.
During the two trying years of the Trump regime, and always in conjunction with allies, @MoveOn has been at the center of organizing and strategizing — from protecting the gains of the ACA to standing up for immigrant rights to defending the Mueller investigation, and much more.
Since its formation, @MoveOn has been a mainstay of the progressive movement. Under @annagalland and @iSheyman's inspired leadership, it became something even more important: the cutting-edge of the resistance to Trump and the defense of our democracy.

RT @Public_Citizen: William Barr is wholly unfit to be the nation's top law enforcement officer. Here’s why:
Ross’ pretext for the racist census citizenship question — that he wanted to "better enforce the Voting Rights Act" — would've been laughable if it weren’t so cruel. https://t.co/hXbklf28wl
Trump added the citizenship question to the census for one reason only: to intimidate immigrants so they don’t fill out their census form.		Today's decision to strike it down is a win for fair representation and unfettered distribution of resources to the areas where they reside. https://t.co/PasuPQP9Pf

Barr today told a Senate panel that he could get on board with arresting journalists. https://t.co/OzqBD84jri
As Bush’s AG, Barr’s draconian approach to law enforcement fostered a system of mass incarceration that disproportionately harmed communities of color across America. https://t.co/3qQFveXNrS
Although Barr stated at his confirmation hearing that he would “diligently enforce” the law encouraging whistleblowers to bring forward cases of companies ripping off the government, he previously called the statute an “abomination.” https://t.co/dBP20IRp57
The @ACLU calls Barr the “godfather of the NSA’s bulk data collection program,” because he authorized bulk phone call data collection. At Verizon, he worked so telecoms could “hand over massive amounts” of customer data to the government. https://t.co/sVrcuTywQc
Barr’s corporate ties are strong and will almost surely influence his views on key law enforcement decisions. He served as general counsel for Verizon and on the board for Dominion Energy, Time-Warner and several investment funds. https://t.co/9IZ27CH8aN
As Bush's AG, Barr was a hardline advocate of detaining Haitian refugees who were HIV-positive at Guantanamo, and of making HIV status a basis for refusing entry to the US. https://t.co/zToL1QDb1a

From rolling back health, safety and wage protections to misleading coal miners to tax giveaways for billionaires and big corporations that left most Americans with a pittance, it should be obvious by now that Trump holds working people beneath contempt.
As a candidate, Trump promised, “the American worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them,” but as president, he has betrayed workers at every turn.
Working families who are living paycheck to paycheck and can no longer afford to pay for rent, groceries and medical bills because of Trump’s reckless shutdown have every right to be furious at the president’s oblivious and patronizing remarks.
Trump has glibly claimed that “workers will make adjustments” and that he “can relate,” which is pretty rich coming from a six-time bankrupt real estate mogul who inherited his daddy’s fortune.

@JPMajor We want children to grow up trusting and aspiring to be astronauts, not with the perception that astronauts are salespeople trying to get them to purchase a product.
@JPMajor 4. Encouraging astronauts to take endorsement deals, including appearing on cereal boxes and in commercials, would effectively allow corporations to use astronauts as marketing agents to sell products to children – some of which may even be unhealthy for them.
@JPMajor 3. Taking endorsement deals (including commercials) could result in corporations having undue influence over NASA decisions. For example, NASA might prioritize a project to please a corporation that an astronaut has a commercial deal with.
@JPMajor 2. NASA employees could be assessed &amp; rewarded based on their abilities to secure corporate ad deals, and not on their abilities to effectively accomplish their job.

We understand sharp elbows will be thrown during a heated election, but the occupant of the White House, in our own city, has degraded political discourse with baseless attacks on his opponents, including by threatening their nonprofit tax status. We expect better from our mayor.
Our decision to file a request for investigation into whether the mayor made illegal in-kind campaign contributions was based on our independent assessment of the available facts. The mayor knows better than to state that Councilmember Elissa Silverman was ‘behind’ our complaint.
Mayor Bowser also knows that we have a long history of filing ethics and campaign finance complaints. A complaint we filed last year about the mayor’s 2014 election fundraising required her to return campaign contributions in excess of the D.C. maximum limit.
And we are strongly supporting legislation to restrict the ability of D.C. government contractors to spend money to influence elections.
As Mayor Bowser knows, we have a long history of advocating for campaign finance laws that empower voters and combat undue corporate influence. In the District, we were strong advocates of the Fair Elections Act, which the mayor signed into law – after initially opposing it.

The report twists and turns to claim that US health care is superior. But we do worse than other rich nations on infant mortality, access to care, lifespan, overall health and quality. Private insurance makes things worse in each dimension. 7/
The report is dead wrong on the cost of Medicare for All. Medicare for All is MORE efficient than wasteful private insurers. We would spend the same or less on health care while providing better treatment to all. 6/
Here’s one embarrassing claim from the report: Restraining drug prices will lower life expectancy. Yes, that’s right – in the country where 1 in 6 ration drugs because of price – they argue that restraining price gouging would cost lives. 5/
If there’s any purpose to the report, the main point seems to be to trash Medicare for All. One problem: The same arguments in the report also trash Medicare. 4/
The report ignores that US government spending launched, aids, props up, or supports almost every major industry in the real economy: Pharma, weapons, autos, computers, Internet, ag, aerospace, telecom, oil, petrochem, home building etc. 3/
The report overtly adopts Milton Friedman’s framework: Only good spending is by you, for you (p10). A great argument against public schools, libraries, police, firefighting, NIH, Medicare and parks. 2/

@realDonaldTrump Trump is ready to punish Central American countries, basically because they are poor. But he refuses to say an unkind word about Saudi Arabia, despite Khashoggi, and despite its war in Yemen, which is facing mass starvation.

Sign our petition demanding Trump immediately divest his business holdings: https://t.co/zDeYpoHw8L		Trump surely will continue making terrible decisions as president.		Nonetheless, we have a right to know whether those decisions are motivated by what’s best for his bottom line.
There are a lot of bad reasons for current U.S. policy.		But it is entirely possible that one reason for the policy, and the humanitarian nightmare it is facilitating, is Trump’s business ties to Saudi Arabia.
The UN warns that Yemen might suffer the worst famine in the last 100 years, if Saudi airstrikes in Yemen do not end.		Trump has refused to stop refueling Saudi fighter jets or take other action to end the Saudi war on Yemen. https://t.co/CrF0JHR2RX
One result has been Trump’s embarrassing series of excuses for the Saudis in the Khashoggi case. Even more consequential has been Trump’s complicity in the Saudi aggression in Yemen, which has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis—with millions on the brink of starvation.

Lies from Trump are nothing new. Lies from Trump about Medicare for All are new, so they're worth correcting.		One reason his attacks are new is b/c he likely supported M4All in the past. But whatever, there’s no reason to think he believed what he said then, or what he says now. https://t.co/SPRfLIRdeF
Medicare for All would take the best performing part of our health care system, improve it, and then extend it to everyone. And by wiping out the massive inefficiencies of the current corporate-dominated system, we can expand coverage and improve quality for no additional cost.
The data backs up people’s impressions: We pay far more than other countries for health care, and we get far less – among rich countries, we alone have massive coverage gaps, and our health care outcomes are far inferior. https://t.co/FfMwgvjev9
Why is support for Medicare for All skyrocketing? Because Americans know from their own experience that the current system is a total mess. Health care is unaffordable, co-pays are a killer, doctors make you wait and don’t have time for you.
Medicare for All won't “lead to the massive rationing of health care.” It's the current system that rations care. 1/3 of Americans had a problem accessing care b/c of cost last year. With M4All, everyone will be able to access treatment, irrespective of how much money they have.
As for the new junk health insurance options Trump has authorized, they offer only the illusion of care because they permit insurers to skirt the requirement to cover pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/iq6rzG2NVC
Protections for pre-ex conditions remain in place only b/c Trump failed to repeal the ACA. Meanwhile, a GOP lawsuit is challenging the ACA, including the guarantee for pre-ex conditions, and there’s a real worry that it'll succeed – especially with Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.
Trump's claim that he kept his pledge to maintain coverage for people with preexisting conditions and created new health insurance options is totally deceptive.
Medicare for All won't cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, b/c it will introduce savings not accounted for in the study Trump cites. But even if it did, that would be LESS than projections for our current system, which also leaves tens of millions of Americans without coverage.
Medicare for All would not “end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for all their lives.” It's called Medicare for All because it would take the program and expand it to everyone. Seniors’ benefits would not be taken away – they would be improved.
Almost every sentence in Trump's USA Today op-ed attacking Medicare for All contained a misleading statement or falsehood. Let's set the record straight.		Thread.

Which foreign government do you think was involved in planning Trump's military parade?
Why it’s IRAN: Sure, the optics of Trump modeling his “Make America Great Again” parade after Iran’s, which has prominently featured banners reading “Death to America,” would be unexpected. But wouldn’t that also be a good reason why the government wants its identity kept secret?
Why it’s SAUDI ARABIA: Trump approved over $2 billion in military weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. With America so heartily supporting the kingdom’s military, returning the favor by helping Trump emulate the annual Mecca military parade would be the least the Crown Prince could do.
Why it’s INDIA: India’s annual military parade features tanks, missiles, and thousands of troops — just the kind of show Trump wanted to put on in DC. “Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine,” Trump reportedly said. Maybe Trump loves a little (secret) help from his friends?
Why it’s the UK: Yes, Trump may have tried to mansplain to UK Prime Minister Theresa May how he thinks Brexit should be handled. But it’s the monarchy that makes him jealous. Perhaps the advice was sought from Buckingham Palace?
Why it’s FRANCE: Trump said he wants the parade to be “like the one in France.” When the DC parade was canceled, he announced he’d attend the Paris parade instead. Who knew that the McDonald’s-loving Trump had a thing for baguettes? Or perhaps he prefers the Royale with Cheese?
Why it’s NORTH KOREA: Trump took credit for the absence of nuclear missiles at the annual military parade in Pyongyang. Was Trump also planning to give Kim Jong Un something about the US military parade to take credit for?
Why it’s RUSSIA:	 	-Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help elect Trump.	 	-Trump openly admires Vladimir Putin.	 	-Russia secretly helping with Trump’s parade could be just one more way Moscow is helping Make America Great Again.
Why it’s CHINA: China pressured Trump to weaken the US enforcement action against Chinese state-owned ZTE, and Trump caved. Could secret parade assistance from China — which hosts a huge military parade each year — be part of the leverage China has over Trump?
With the Pentagon refusing to disclose which country was involved, we’ve got some guesses on who the culprit could be. “Like” the post with the country you think could be responsible. Thread. https://t.co/ChcXApIukv

When government agencies are challenged by corporations, Judge Kavanaugh almost always rules against the agencies. But when consumer or public interest groups challenge agencies, it’s an entirely different story — he sides with the agencies.
Judge Kavanaugh believes federal agencies should be permitted to regulate corporations on “major questions” only when Congress specifically instructs them to do so — a rarity.
Over and over, Judge Kavanaugh’s doctrines favor Big Business.		Kavanaugh believes that corporations almost always should be able to challenge regulations that affect them in court, but he imposes enormous hurdles on the ability of public interest groups like us to sue.

As a member of the DC Circuit, Kavanaugh was generous in deferring to executive agencies when their actions were challenged by consumer or public interest groups. But when corporations challenged agencies, it was a different story — he showed little or no deference.
