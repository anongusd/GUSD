@Otaku_Otter @PoxNewsCEO @Lead1225 @Knightmoved Yeah, I have five cats. They are not social. They are at best mildly tolerant, and it is unclear whether this is due to altruism or pure laziness.
@PoxNewsCEO @Lead1225 @Otaku_Otter @Knightmoved Note: I'm not weighing into the argument. I'm just saying my cat is a jerk.		Also, creationism is nonsensical and unsupported by fact. Further, "I don't understand how evolution did this one thing, therefore evolution is wrong" is a really weak argument. 		Guess I weighed in.
@PoxNewsCEO @Lead1225 @Otaku_Otter @Knightmoved I read the bit about the rats not shocking their littermates and felt all fuzzy inside.

@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama According to polls it's more like a 1/3. And it's shrinking every year. I have no doubt my children's and grandchildren's generation are much more accepting of people who are different to them than my parents and grandparents generations were.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Wasn't just one experience. I live in Missouri. Believe me, I know plenty of folks with the MAGA hat. Never once had a decent experience with one. I just shared one example.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I never said you weren't legally allowed to wear it. I never said you should care how people feel. I just said I hope you understand how many people feel when you wear it.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama LOL, not ironically Catholic. I'm also not twisting myself into knots to explain the obvious away. It's pretty obvious what he finds important and what he doesn't. It doesn't take much to get him to go off script. 		If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck...
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Well, yeah. He posts to let people know his views. He posts strongly when he feels misunderstood or attacked. He hasn't posted about this very much, if at all. 		All we have are his words and actions. This encompasses both.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama The kids wearing the MAGA hats at my kid's school taught her the word "kike." 		So, yeah, I'll pass, thanks!
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Maybe both. He has clearly made overt racist and misogynist remarks on several occasions, both before and after his campaign. (Housing discrimination, Central Park 5, Mexicans are rapists, grab 'em by the pussy being a few). Perhaps people don't know, perhaps they don't care.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama It wasn't a waste of time for me. I think I understand your points a little better. You truly don't think wearing that hat makes many people feel insecure and threatened.		I hope you understand that it does symbolize that for many people, myself and my family included.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama What I am saying is that when he is passionate about correcting what he perceives to be a misunderstanding, he posts about it frequently. He does not post about this, despite the fact that people (according to you) misunderstand him.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama *Amadis
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama So now you're standing by that argument?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama He backtracked on that the very next day.		Again, Trump is really good at making his feelings known. If he wanted people to know he's against Nazis, he'd be posting NOT A NAZI SYMPATHIZER alongside daily his WITCH HUNT and FAKE NEWS tweets.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Trump is really good at making things clear. He Tweets constantly about his concerns. If he were truly worried that we got the mistaken impression, he'd be tweeting it each and every day the same way he tweets witch hunt and fake news and whatnot.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama How does your question "Why would anyone of color support a white supremacist?" relate to that? That question in and of itself implies that if a person of color supports someone, they are NOT a white supremacist. Taken in context with the thread, and it REALLY means that.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm not confused. I'm also not kidding myself about what he meant. He has had ample opportunity to make it crystal clear. He hasn't.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama From the linked Tweet, I gleaned that your claim was that because some minorities support Trump, Trump cannot be racist. Perhaps I misunderstood? https://t.co/awMRBiqq8L
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama He said it in the sense that he referred to "both sides" of the protest. One side were Nazis. Others were those protesting Nazis. He said there were members on both sides who were very fine people. That logically implies that there are Nazis who are very fine people.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Immigrants are actually a really big part of America's middle class.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Have you noticed I haven't insulted you once yet I've been able to carry on this conversation with you? 		In any case, I was refuting your claim that a single person of color supporting Trump means that Trump supports all people of color. It is an illogical claim.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama No, enforcing the laws doesn't make Trump a Nazi sympathizer. Saying that some Nazis are "very fine people" does.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Actually, I've been involved with immigration issues for many years and I definitely didn't like everything about how immigrants were treated. Today, though, is much worse than the previous 15 years with which I have experience.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm not sure how that lawsuit connects to whether MAGA hats are symbols of hate. Can you connect those dots for me?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Did you miss the whole tiki-torch brigade chanting blood and soil? Did you miss our president calling some of them "very fine people?"
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama And what evidence do you have that I am a leftist lemming?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Unemployment across the board is great! I agree that's awesome! I also am a huge fan of prison reform and agree that some of the things they did are good.		Again, what's your point? None of this addresses whether Trump has, overall, increased the boldness of racists and neo-Nazis
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm not a democrat. I don't know why you keep bringing up democrats.		The hat is absolutely seen as a symbol of racism and misogyny based on the actions and words of its creator. You can be sad that this is true. You can think it's unfair. But you can't undo that.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama There are many examples in history of people who work for their own interests above the interests of others. Jewish guards in concentration camps come to mind.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama It's in my bio. You wrote "You guys" right after the word "Jews". I wondered. So, I asked. 		So let me ask again: What did you mean by "you guys".
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I am not sure how Kavanaugh and Clinton are relevant to the question of whether a MAGA hat is a symbol of hate. Can you connect those dots for me?
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Assuming for the moment those facts are true, how does getting more of the black vote than one other guy mean anything?
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama And I absolutely addressed the point. Symbols can start off one thing and evolve based on how they are used. Perhaps you missed that post?
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I didn't assume that. I asked. That's why there was the little question mark at the end. I was trying to get clarity on what you mean by "you guys".
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Elsewhere I said that I've never liked Bill Clinton. He also should not sexually assault people. No one should sexually assault people. Do we agree on that?
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama That's not even close to true and that's a huge reason he's so incredibly unpopular in NY, where he lived his whole life. There are many incidents (his renting practices, his calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, etc.) Seriously, just google.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I looked at his actions, read his words and his mother's words
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama "You guys" meaning the Jews?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama My toaster oven is stainless steel.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm not a democrat, so I don't give a rat's butt about what you think of the donkey. So, good luck with that.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama ... But that symbol, created by Trump, now encompasses everything we know about Trump. His sexual assaults, his racism, his hatred, his anger, his selfishness, his lies. He made that symbol what it was and when you wear it, you represent all of that.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Symbols have many meanings and they evolve over time. The original meaning for a swastika was actually quite nice. It was turned into a symbol of hate when millions were murdered and wars were fought. The idea of making America greater is a wonderful idea and I'm all for it...
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama The kids in my daughter's school who wear that hat call her a kike. I never had to even explain that term to my other kids until they reached college. 		The leader who created that hat has done and said a lot of racist and misogynist things. You should let your kids know that.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I have watched the video, read his mother's responses and his own responses. The discussion was about that particular kid.		The guy who called those kids names did not do a good thing.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I am stating very clearly that purposely wearing a symbol of racism and hate means something. I can't speak for the order in which I answered questions by Twitter posters.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama No, it's about wearing a hate symbol. I feel like I'm saying this a lot. My own children and grandchildren are white males. They wouldn't wear hate symbols. It's not about the gender and race.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama The MAGA hat is the racist part. I've been pretty clear on that. I can't speak for others.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama So you truly believe that symbols mean nothing? You believe wearing a swastika or a white hood or an anti-fa mask doesn't mean anything?
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Ah, sorry. My mentions are pretty busy at the moment. In any case, I assume I've answered the question to your satisfaction now?
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama You can keep using the word "bigotry" incorrectly. That won't make your argument work, though.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I don't hate white males either. I, myself, have produced a couple of them that I love very much!
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama You have already called me several names and attacked me personally.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama No one ever asked about anti-white slurs or threats of violence, so I haven't refused to comment. Perhaps you are confusing me with someone else.		So, for the record: no one should be demeaned because of their race. No one should be threatened with violence.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Yet he wears a symbol of hate.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Well, I also read his mother's responses, his school's responses and watched the whole video. I also happen to have a decent amount of personal experience regarding private Catholic schools.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama So he doesn't hate disabled people. That's great! It's a good start. Perhaps he can learn through his empathy for the disabled that wearing a symbol of hate that alienates other people different to him is painful to those people.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Well, you're right. He could have bought it with his own money just like the other kids in his group. It could have been a giant coincidence that the chaperones and the kids wore the hats.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I actually have a very, very clear idea of the type of school he went to. You don't know much about me.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama ... get out on his own, meet someone different to himself and realize that they aren't devils just because they are different. Maybe he'll look back with shame that he wore a hat that means so much pain to so many people and that he was seen doing this on a national stage. Maybe.
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama ...purposely isolating him from those who are different. 		He'll learn a hard lesson from this. He'll probably learn the wrong one, too, because his parents--the same people who put him in this situation--will cement him further in. 		Maybe, though, someday, he'll...
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I saw a boy who has been given privilege and who probably really has no actual idea what his hat means other than it "owns the libs" who are "bad, evil and socialist". HIs parents know. His parents bought him the hat. His parents are raising him to hate. His parents are...
@JohnJRotten @dipppysipppy @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I actually saw a young boy a little older than my youngest child who has been sent to a school where he has little interaction with people of other races, genders and religions and who has most likely been taught that he is much better off being separated from those people.
@kyleuub @NBCNews Here is what they say it means: https://t.co/Y5XPZSDREy		Please point out where it says recipients aren't racist.
@kyleuub @NBCNews I never claimed to hate anyone nor have any of my actions shown that I do hate anyone. I hate certain beliefs and actions, but I don't hate people.
@kyleuub @NBCNews So your argument is that accepting an award alongside 80 other people, some of whom happen to be black, means that he can't be a racist?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I am not a fan of Farrakhan at all. I, in fact, have been involved in various outreach programs to the black Muslim community since the 90s to try to lessen some of their views on anti-semitism.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I see. So you don't want to bring people around to your side. You just want to spew anger at people you disagree with?
@kyleuub @NBCNews That hat was created by Trump himself. He has made it clear through actions and words throughout his life that he has a lot of hate and misogyny in him and that he's peachy keen with sexual assault. Wearing the hat means you stand for what he stands for.		This isn't difficult.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama The rape was never proven and certainly never admitted on a live mic. That said, I never liked Bill Clinton at all and wasn't too big a fan of Hillary.		What's your point? Do you think it's OK to sexually assault people if they belong to your party?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama So you're saying you're a supporter of the wall. OK. So, are you a supporter of sexually assaulting women? Do you think some neo-Nazis are "very fine people?"
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Do you even notice how you resort to personal insults rather than address the issues being discussed? Does this work to bring people to your side in other areas of your life or are you just venting?
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Yep. It's about the hat. That hat that means "Build the Wall." The hat that means "Grab them by the pussy." That hat that means "Some [neo-Nazis] are very fine people." 		Yeah, that one.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama My particular 15 year old might start dancing or step around to stand beside him. She probably wouldn't be in a crowd confronting people while wearing a hate symbol on her head to begin with, as she's, yannow, not a racist.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Maybe not worn a bright red hate symbol and a smirk on his face in the first place? I dunno, but that could be a start.
@kyleuub @NBCNews Yeah, a MAGA hat is just a hat. A confederate flag is just a flag. A white hood is just hood. A swastika is just a symbol. A burning cross is just a couple of pieces of wood and a chemical reaction. Nothing means anything. Keep telling yourself that.
@dipppysipppy @JohnJRotten @Candid77 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Yes.
@kyleuub @NBCNews It still shows the kid wearing a bright red symbol of hatred and misogyny on his head. So....
@WajahatAli Please tell me he didn't do that again. Please. Even if you're lying.
@kyleuub @NBCNews I watched the whole video. Curious to see whether you think the whole video somehow shows the kid NOT wearing a bright red symbol of hatred on his head and a nasty smirk on his face?
@JohnnyDCab1 @NBCNews Yep.
@tromano40 @DaveDunndee @NBCNews Yeah, I love these guys who always dunk on me for being a "liberal." I've been an independent my whole life and up until recently, was likely to vote both sides of the aisle. They just can't fathom that people can be loyal to principles rather than a party.

@CheriJacobus On that we agree. I would add that I want a party strong enough to withstand the next Trumps--the ones that are less of an obvious buffoon but just as evil. As far as I can tell, that party is going to have to be the Democratic party.
@CheriJacobus I don't think it grows the party to have yet another ancient white male as leader when the are other valid choices. I'm not a Democrat myself, but I don't see appealing to octogenarians as a top priority for any party that thinks further ahead than a single election.

@sadydoyle Due to the fact that women are considered "old" well before men are, we can expect to be pretty much invisible so the vast majority of society by our mid 40s to early 50s. 		All that said, invisibility does give one the super power to not give a fuck and to say what one pleases.
@sadydoyle Middle aged women are underestimated and treated with condescension because we are women first and foremost. That's basic misogyny that society, including progressives, has in abundance. On top of this we are dismissed even more readily because society sees the old as irrelevant.

@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems @CBP Even if there is one per mile, you'll need the shifts of 1900 agents to do the packages. So 5,700 people just to hang out by the fence every day. Will they need partners?
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems @CBP So they'll have to have people standing by ready to pounce if the people and wild animals are trying to pass over packages, right? It doesn't take long to pass a package over. So how many will need to be stationed along the point fence ready to intercept the packages?
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems Two of them are right here, actually, helping make dinner.  They said they don't know about the Mexican emu problem either and are interested to hear your ideas.
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems Wait, does the detailed plan have a way to keep out the Mexican emus? Maybe I'm not giving them the benefit of the doubt here.
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems Also, birds! Birds might trip one of those 9500 motion sensors quite a few times a day. And we have to allow birds in because they can fly. Except for penguins of course and ostriches and emus. But maybe emus could climb. They won a war against the Australians. Did you know that?
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems So the border is like 1900 miles long. Most long-range cameras cover about 300 feet. But super expensive ones can cover up to 1,500 feet. So each mile will need about 5 cameras. You're gonna have one agent watching 9,500 screens at a time? That's a talented guy.
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems That's just a nickname in movies. I am seriously asking about real coyotes. They live in my neighborhood and I'm sure they live down south too. And they can carry stuff for sure. One took off with my neighbor's rabbit last year
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems Well he didn't call them illegal. He just said that there was a problem with coyotes going over the border. he said the wall would be needed to block them, so I was wondering how the motion detectors could tell the difference between people and coyotes.
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems And also, how will motion detectors differentiate between animals and people? and if they can differentiate, couldn't the animals pass packages back and forth to each other? I have so many questions.
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems Trump said we did just yesterday!
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems So they might catch wild animals, like, say, coyotes who go up to the fence to pee on it?
@SerrallesA @Acosta @SenateGOP @SenateDems And people can easily pass packages through!

@theratzpack @ByronYork Mattis' statement was much broader than Syria or Afghanistan. My point is that people are ignoring the broad statements to focus on the straw that broke the camel's back because it is easier to argue about Syria then justify trashing alliances we've had for decades
@BoardwalkRenos @ByronYork The point Mattis was making about our allies was much broader than Syria.

@washingtonpost I was just rambling about this elsehwere: https://t.co/KiBXiGls4Y
@ABC Of course I don't mean to suggest that anyone need get out of the wombat game altogether. I'm sure it's a great field of research and I'm the last person to denigrate another person's passion.		I just think that exclusively working with dead wombats might be a little too niche.
@ABC I, myself, would be thinking "Perhaps I could swing a gig where I can work with LIVE wombats rather than just reinflating dead ones?" 		It would be a step in the right direction, anyway.
@ABC I mean, imagine that was your job--reinflating the lower intestines of recently deceased wombats using only a plastic pump and a pack of party balloons. I imagine every pump of air into a wombat intestine neatly punctuated the researchers' ongoing inner monologues.
@ABC Researchers figured out how they poop cubes by finding roadkill wombats and reinflating the lower parts of their intestines with those long balloons you use to make balloon animals. Turns out their intestines have stiff walls and loose corners, enabling cube poops.
@ABC Wombats poop up to 100 2-cm cubes (yes, cubes) of poop every night. 		Just thought I'd share.

@Jeffers55879999 @LindseyGrahamSC Credible is different to corroboration. The FBI can determine whether there are corroborating witnesses and/or evidence. So hopefully they'll get their time to investigate.
@LauraMarklin @ErikFritts75 @LindseyGrahamSC Sigh. I didn't hear any stories changing. However, I'm sure the FBI would be great at gathering the evidence and making a judgment. Since people obviously don't agree, I guess that's the best route.

I have had more frank conversations in the past 2 years with my kids/younger relatives about what it was like to grow up in the 70s/80s and what my mother experienced than I had in the previous 2 decades.
@Schenck @jonlovett You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
@CShitposting @BenjaminRush20 @jonlovett Right. Good idea! Let's investigate and see if even more witnesses come forward.
@Eyes_On_It_All @jonlovett You manage your rhetoric and phrasing and I'll manage mine, thanks.
@Schenck @jonlovett Again, what we have to do as a society as keep pushing toward a time where Clarence and Kavanaugh would NOT be confirmed.
@rwgranny @jonlovett Well, you, um, investigate. In a month's time three women have come forward. You investigate their claims, see if other witnesses come forward, etc. 		There are some really cool true crime series on Netflix if you want to see how investigations work. Look 'em up!
@Eyes_On_It_All @jonlovett Do you or do you not understand the word "if"?
@601DvlDog @BenjaminRush20 @jonlovett Thank God I didn't! I wouldn't be nearly as much fun of a grandmother if I had.
@GingerPowers64 @BenjaminRush20 @jonlovett Wooosh.
@kevinmclaughli @jonlovett Right, the facts are unclear and there are multiple stories. If the situation is investigated, more stories will emerge and the facts will become clearer, either way. That's what "it's not over" means.
@roberttcu12 @jonlovett Understood. But women care. And if enough women care, politicians will eventually respond.
@Schenck @jonlovett Who said anything about months? We have the rest of his life to investigate.
@kevinmclaughli @jonlovett It's more like he said, she said, she said, she said and maybe another she said.		The truth will out if we make the space to allow it.
@BenjaminRush20 @jonlovett In what universe was Bill Cosby going to go to jail for sexual assault? 		I was a teenager in the 80s. Our society has changed slowly but surely and women are becoming freer to speak. We have to keep the eye on the prize and keep pushing relentlessly. These dinosaurs will fall.
@djsteincom @BenjaminRush20 @jonlovett As compelling a vision as this is, I hold no illusions that any of these men will ever face any consequences other than losing their jobs.
@jonlovett Even if he's confirmed, it's not over. He can be impeached. 		If he is truly a serial sexual predator, we have to make room in our society for women to come forward. We have to make it safer for women to speak. We have to do this anyway, so we may as well start here, with him.

(He may have posted others as well, but I just see what pops up on my timeline.) The majority of his tweets, though, are nasty shots at straw man arguments.
@James_Steiner_V @HawleyMO @clairecmc Read his entire Twitter history. He has made references to "our way of life" and talked about giving "pastors" the ability to lobby politically and keep their tax-exempt status. More than that, though, he's almost always trash talking rather than laying out his platform.
@HawleyMO @clairecmc I'm an independent voter who is disgusted by the divisiveness of Trump. Instead of rising above the stunningly low bar he set, you keep tunneling under it. I suggest you develop a message that brings ALL Missourians together--not just the ones that look and worship like you.

@bpcmd1 @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump There are a lot of stupid memes with no substance on Twitter, I agree. That isn't hate speech. It's just immature and not helpful. 		By hate speech, I mean posts that advocate banning particular religions or people of various races or orientations.

@DoxiOwned @HawleyMO @clairecmc I truly don't understand why any Republican, especially one who is so deeply and firmly snuggled into bed with Trump as Josh Hawley, would be complaining about someone having money.
@HawleyMO @clairecmc Why do you criticize @clairecmc for having money when you revel in the support of the divisive, crass, cruel and purportedly BILLIONAIRE Donald Trump?
@HawleyMO @clairecmc Why do you support taking away healthcare from those with pre-existing conditions? Why do you support the obviously deeply unpopular union-busting right-to-work? Why are you just trash-talking your opponent rather than talking about actual issues?

@NRO Interesting article about how we interpret, value and devalue facts.		It completely ignores the biggest conflict, which is that some want to take rights (marriage, residency, voting, healthcare, life) away from other population segments. That is the crux and should be addressed.

@jack He has blatantly threatened to kill people. Public officials, no less. If that isn't against your rules, what is, @jack?

@mflynnJR So if you were around when the Boston Tea Party happened, you'd have been scoffing at those guys, right? 		Also, since when is Tweeting incessantly working?
@savittj Insomnia. Also, scathing anxiety.
@TomiLahren Why do you try to sow more hatred into our society? All you do is divide people. You hurt people for a living.

@LaptopShopWH OMG, this means I'm not fake!

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Hey, two words: North Korea		Amateurs and frauds.
@FoxNews Are you going to ask him about all the murders he's participated in? You could start with the nerve agent death in the UK last week and work your way backwards.
@FoxBusiness Wait, I thought the tax scam fixed all this?!?

@seanspicer It's called not being a racist or a bigot or a misogynist. You all should try it.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Merrick Garland. Also, just STFU.
@thehill Huh. I guess we add firefighters to the list of people Trump hates.
@MoMoneyMitt Holy crap! He chose the white guy! Who could have guessed?!?
@OKnox Oh, the white guy! I'm so shocked!
@imillhiser Bite your tongue.
@EdanClay @realDonaldTrump Solid choice.
@Cernovich Boring. He's gonna pick the white guy.
@JamesTateHill Seriously. I need a nap. And glasses. Or a drink. Or fewer drinks maybe.
@JamesTateHill Oh. Wait. No. Apparently I can't read. I missed a negative in your original statement. I withdraw my counterpoint.
@JamesTateHill Counterpoint: Spaceballs
@ScholarsInk @NRO OK, I stand down. I see your point and apologize for jumping the gun. 		Many, many more voices soundly and completely condemning racism need to be heard.
@ScholarsInk @NRO ... problem on anything other than the root cause--ignorance, isolation and years and years of fear-mongering.
@ScholarsInk @NRO I probably picked on the wrong author, but I am frustrated as hell that there isn't a massive chorus of conservative voices screaming that what is happening is wrong. Instead, we have voices denying the problem exists, denying it's as big of a problem it is or blaming the ...
@ScholarsInk @NRO I'm an independent. I'm fairly fiscally conservative. I've voted for conservative lawmakers in the past, but never will again until all conservative voices are out screaming about the racists in their midst. Racists should be drummed out of the GOP and political life in general.
@ScholarsInk @NRO As I said, I agree that there are too many of these regulations. But I don't understand why the NRO isn't screaming from the rooftops about the much bigger problem of racism on the right. Not lightly hamstringing racists, but attacking the issue head-on.
@ADudeFromNowere @Cernovich Oh, so actual Nazis proven to be in the party are just "kooks" but anyone on the streets chanting blood and soil are just crisis actors? 		You have a Nazi problem. Address it. Stop pretending it doesn't exist.
@ScholarsInk @NRO They are not addressing the main cause (racism) and picking on one of their favorite whipping boys (regulations). They suggest that removing these pesky regulations will somehow tie racists' hands, when in fact it will mostly allow the corrupt to act with impunity.
@thehill So.... @LindseyGrahamSC wants a slave owner on the supreme court?
RT @MikeDrucker: Guys, this isn’t the way to handle politics. Really? Yelling at Stephen Miller? What you should do is engage him a polite…
@ScholarsInk @NRO The answer to racism isn't "fewer laws". I agree there may be too many regulations, but it is absolute bullshit for the NRO to go after regulation rather than directly addressing the real problem of racism within the GOP.
@NRO @ScholarsInk You misspelled "racism"
@adamcbest That seems like way too much work. I am just not giving a shit.
@thehill "...except when that person's last name is Clinton"
@Cernovich I guess you believe Arthur Jones is a democrat, too, huh? https://t.co/bCirrX6uNT		You guys own the Nazis. Have fun with them.
@GOPChairwoman You're complicit in so much corruption it's sickening.
@gersonwalks @thehill Why are socks any grosser than any other piece of clothing?
@NRA The NRA: "Every toddler should have a firearm!"
@dynamicsymmetry Seriously. Why do they think there will be no consequences to spending your life actively trying to harm other people?
@scalzi And productive!
@JakePlunkett @HelloCullen A duck once landed in my yard and within 2 seconds, insisted he owned the place and that we weren't allowed there anymore. We battled for about a week before he finally left.		No one got bit on the willie, but it was still pretty traumatic. Sorry about your ducksperience.
@moosemuffinn @eesha72627691 @GOP Look, it's Whataboutism Wendy, guys! She thinks because someone she doesn't like did something means it's ok to do.
@JuliaEAinsley I volunteer to watch the dog.
How in the world do you stand up in court and argue against giving children back to their parents? https://t.co/Tcb7P4U31U
@thehill That's the first picture I've ever seen of him that doesn't make him look like an especially confused dog.
@EyePatchGuy Did you evacuate the building and then burn it down? Because that is the only appropriate response.

@ColinKahl But, you have to understand, they were going to expose him to an unflattering balloon. He had no choice but to flee!		I hope Scotland gives him hell.
@thehill This article was delicious.
@Mike_P_Williams They do have that entertaining roly-poly fellow, though, don't they?
@PaulWuster @thehill This is true. Jesus was just a super precocious Reform Jew. As a modern Reform Jew, I can tell you these guys hate us with a passion. After all we're running around with our studyin' and thinkin' and carin' about people and stuff.
This is lovely! (Pun somewhat intended.) https://t.co/BUbR1rQmzB

This is disgusting on many levels. This shit needs to stop. Now. https://t.co/gvYbQ5r7cJ
@thehill We really need to invent a time machine, fill it with these pasty white guys and send them all back 100 years or so. Or maybe 1000. Or 10,000. Whatever.
@adamnowek a) Congratulations and b) Your cat doesn't look very pleased at all
@VoteJavi @fred_guttenberg This response to the father of a murder victim is stunningly dismissive, simplistic, heartless and cruel. It's also typical of the GOP these days and the reason this independent will not be voting for any GOP candidates for the foreseeable future.
@seanspicer You going to teach Lying To Your Country 101?
@Keffy It is bullshit. Maddening, maddening bullshit.
@adam22 I pay all my interns. They are human beings who need shelter, food and work experience. This isn't hard.		They come back every year and some of them end up working for me fulltime after college.
@guardian He's scared of the balloon so he's going to... Scotland. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! I can't wait to see the welcome he gets in Scotland.
@BillOReilly You have been a HUGE part of this. What are you going to do to change it?
@seanspicer @seanhannity Pay for lies? Nope. We can watch your pressers for free on youtube.
@NRO Um, you mistyped 2016.
@DemWrite They are farmers. They voted for Trump. They reap what they sow.
@GOP Oh you looked up what they actually did after everyone corrected you! Good job! It's almost as if you know what you're doing.
