#NextGenTV is game-changing technology for broadcasting and our viewers, and we thank the visionary leadership of @AjitPaiFCC and his colleagues for their support. https://t.co/vWnlnfxfJJ
The #NextGenTV item passes! Thanks everyone!!! -RK #FCCLive
.@AjitPaiFCC highlighting the competitive benefits of Next Gen TV. This has been ignored. It shouldn’t be. This is what makes cable and wireless nervous, and that’s a good thing. -RK #NextGenTV
.@AjitPaiFCC demonstrating exactly why the FCC should encourage innovation, not stand in the way of it. -RK #FCCLive
Minority doesn’t address the digital divide that is widened without a standard change. Those who can afford it will get better TV. Those who can’t will be guaranteed an inferior signal. That’s not serving the public interest. -RK #FCCLive
.@JRosenworcel claims that broadcasters will force MVPDs to carry two signals when people can’t get it. This is simply incorrect. No broadcaster can force an MVPD to do anything. It doesn’t match market reality, either. -RK #FCCLive
@JRosenworcel .@JRosenworcel is seeking to draw a parallel. NAB sees it too, but we are trying to solve the problems with the DTV transition, and we don’t have more spectrum like we did then. -RK #NextGenTV
.@JRosenworcel also talks about the DTV transition. She focuses on the legislation and the end date for a transition. She highlights the Wilmington transition market and says there are lessons learned from this approach. -RK #FCCLive
.@BrendanCarrFCC recognizes the enormous potential of #NextGenTV. He rejects the “bogeymen” of increased costs. Thank you, Commissioner Carr. These claims are false. -RK #FCCLive
.@BrendanCarrFCC takes our focus to the US’s leadership in technology. Bravo. We never seem to hear this from the FCC in the broadcast context. The US should not only continue to lead the world in wireless, but also in broadcast. -RK #FCCLive #NextGenTV
.@mikeofcc eager to see how the market develops and recognizes the broadcast industry has every incentive to serve its viewers. He focuses on the voluntary nature of the item. That piece is conveniently forgotten or ignored by some. -RK #FCCLive  #NextGenTV
.@mikeofcc walking us through the DTV transition history and correcting the record about the need for congressional action. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc putting his longer statement in the record. He expresses his support for the voluntary #NextGenTV transition. Recognizes the potential value to consumers. -RK #FCCLive
Still at a loss why the minority doesn’t support and encourage broadcasters to innovate. It’s not only for the wireless industry. -RK #FCCLive
RT @ZamirAtNAB: #NextGenTV allows broadcasters to often enormous pro-consumer innovations for over-the-air viewers - for free! Portraying i…
.@MClyburnFCC raising privacy. Of course that’s an important issue, but #NextGenTV has no return path. The only way broadcasters would get info is through broadband, not ATSC 3.0. This is a red herring. -RK #FCCLive
RT @KatyontheHill: Odd that #nextgenTV is not bipartisan; advances new tech in a biz that lives off its audience &amp; will do everything to ke…
.@MClyburnFCC wants more regulations for broadcasters and believes this item doesn’t have enough. Without flexibility, we can’t innovate, just like the wireless industry. -RK #FCCLive
It’s amazing how these questions about costs and innovation are NEVER raised when it comes to the wireless industry. That’s not balanced regulation. -RK #FCCLive
.@MClyburnFCC concerned about costs, but there are none. And why no concern about wireless and cable industries? What are T-Mobile’s new 600 MHz phones going to cost? Will there be outrage? -RK #FCCLive
No reason this #NextGenTV item shouldn’t be unanimous. Commercial and public broadcasters are bending over backwards to make this work for all. -RK #FCCLive
The FCC staff did a GREAT job working on this over the last two years. We’ve come a long way since the last administration put #NextGenTV out for comment. -RK #FCCLive
#NextGenTV allows broadcasters to continue to compete well into the future. We are always asked about innovation and this is yet another example. -RK #FCCLive
This is a really big day for all of those who have worked tirelessly on ATSC 3.0. -RK #FCCLive #NextGenTV
Media ownership modernization adopted! -RK #FCCLive
I am confused how one can dissent from the incubator program. It may not be enough, but seems like there is no downside. The rules don’t get it done. We need actual action. -RK #FCCLive
.@ajitpaifcc listing the reforms. Great description of the silliness of the 8-voices test. Never made any sense. I have never heard a remotely compelling rationale. Minority statements did not defend it. -RK #FCCLive
.ajitpaifcc believes he got it right. Some wanted more, some less. True. Would have liked to see more reform, but this is an important moment. Politics and apathy have prevented reform in the past. -RK #FCCLive
.@jrosenworcel making a sweeping statement. She covers important issues, but we still need suggestions about what reform works. Same rules basically since 1975. -RK #FCCLive
.@jrosenworcel says the FCC should engage in thoughtful reform. If this isn’t it, what is? What other proposal? The last vote kept everything the same. -RK #FCCLive
.@jrosenworcel focusing on fake news. That is an important issue. But let’s face it, that has zero to do with the FCC’s media ownership rules. -RK #FCCLive
.@jrosenworcel talking about how critical broadcasters are to our nation. We agree. -RK #FCCLive
.@brendancarrfcc pleased with the work on embedded markets. Thanks to the majority for not neglecting these important markets. -RK #FCCLive
.@BrendanCarrFCC praises the “common sense” changes in the order. His focus is on the record and what it reflects about today’s media landscape. -RK #FCCLive
.@brendancarrfcc looking to increase investment. Recognizes rules on their face eliminate investment. -RK #FCCLive
The point is that running a station is expensive. Consolidation may be necessary to increase resources expended to cover local news. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc hoping, praying (?) that the courts do the right thing and uphold this order. He asks the courts to let the FCC do its job as an expert agency. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc wants a review of AM/FM subcaps. Says it’s time. Today’s order does not do that. He wants more radio deregulation. He’s looking forward to the 2018 review. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc discusses his work to help embedded markets. FCC will employ a presumptive waiver in DC and NY. Sanity, finally. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc discusses eliminating 8-voices test. It’s a silly rule that doesn’t match more than half of the markets in the country. And it harms small markets in particular. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc rightly says that we need to formally review media market definition. Item today doesn’t do it, but heads in right direction. -RK #FCCLive
Social media IS local. Cannot ignore its impact on how the news is covered. FCC finally recognizing this. Stations know this – it impacts their operations daily. -RK #FCCLive
Past FCCs have ABSOLUTELY believed that the cross-ownership rules had outlived their usefulness. Only politics got in the way. -RK #FCCLive
.@mikeofcc rightly takes on those that wrongly suggest a nefarious plan to help one company. NAB has sought these – and other – changes for YEARS. Let’s have a philosophical disagreement, not one based on innuendo. -RK #FCCLive
Important for the FCC to know its own rules and standards. Majority ignored facts and data in initial ownership review. Now it must reconsider. -RK #FCCLive
Why did the last Chairman not even have a diversity committee? Where was the outrage then? -RK #FCCLive
Kudos to this FCC to pursuing an incubator program. Head-scratcher why prior Commission did nothing. NAB committed to continuing our efforts to increase the flow of capital to historically underrepresented groups. #capitalassets -RK #FCCLive
.@mclyburnfcc gets the law wrong. The FCC absolutely has the right to reconsider last year’s order. -RK #FCCLive
The prior FCC was derelict in its duty to take a serious look at the ownership rules. It was unfair to make the staff write that order. -RK #FCCLive
.@mclyburnfcc, the reason many mega-companies don’t do local news? It’s EXPENSIVE. How do locals pay for it, then? If Google can’t afford it, it’s important to inquire why. -RK #FCCLive
Eager to see if the #FCC is there for TV and radio broadcasters as T-Mobile tries to force them off the air during the next few years. We sound super important today. -RK #FCCLive
Hard to see the minority’s argument re: local media consolidation after approving two of the largest media mergers in #FCC history during the last administration. -RK #FCCLive
Nothing in the record – yes, the record – justifies maintaining the current rules. -RK #FCCLive
Excited about the possibility of embedded market relief for radio! Great for smaller local communities buried among larger ones. -RK #FCCLive
This modernization could have occurred two decades ago and it would still have been overdue. -RK #FCCLive
Staff did a great job on the draft item. Was clearly far easier to write this one than the gymnastics of last orders to justify doing nothing. -RK #FCCLive
Time for long-awaited media ownership reform... -RK
