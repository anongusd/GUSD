@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump How can you honestly believe Trump represents America's interests in foreign affairs when he's proven time and time again he doesn't? He's interested in his own business interests at our detriment. Anything to make another buck for himself, even if it comes to siding w dictators.
@tedlieu @glenns_music @realDonaldTrump He literally only strengthened Kim Jong Un while undermining American intelligence agencies, which he does at every opportunity, again. He is not loyal to America. He does ****NOT**** represent our national interests in any way. I'm quite frankly shocked that you believe he does.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump No, Ted, Trump does not represent America in foreign affairs. It's very clear he believes foreign leaders with horrific human rights' abuse records over American intelligence. He just took Kim Jong Un's word on Otto Warmbler after also believing MSB and Putin. #TrumpFail

@DrugstorCowboy @isawthesethings @johnlundin If anything, the Constitution is clear that Rule of Law is preeminent, NOT executive authority.
@DrugstorCowboy @isawthesethings @johnlundin Impeachment was added to the Constitution to ensure Congress, as a co-equal branch with oversight, did have a specific means to remove a president. There is nothing in the Constitution to suggest that Founders intended it as protection for a criminal president against the law.
@johnlundin @Havemercy_2 There's nothing in the constitution that says a sitting president can't be indicted. Just because the process of impeachment is described, it doesn't preclude indictment. Our founders simply added an additional method to ensure a criminal executive could be removed by Congress.

@Clover1292 According to ICE, it costs taxpayers, on average, $133 per detainee per day. At 44,699 (the average detainees per day, also according to ICE), that's $5,944,967 per day, or $2,169,912,955 per year. There must be alternatives between easy release and detainment.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Catch and detain is recommended by private prison lobbyists who would make huge profits by charging us taxpayers many millions of dollars. I'm personally not up for that. I'd rather fix roads, bridges and improve hospitals &amp; schools, etc., than pay private prisons for detainment.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi My understanding is that there is some funding for physical barriers/walls in specific places where they would be efficient.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Only Congress can allocate funds (Article I). Many other presidents have used National Emergencies, but not to directly contradict the will of a Congressional vote. It's an unconstitutional power grab and an extremely dangerous precedent, which is why it won't work.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi If you, as a customer who has the lawful right to delegate funds, give money to a contractor to build you a new deck in the backyard, but you arrive home to find instead he's given you a front fence, would that be okay? It's a similar principle.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi What Trump is doing here is declaring a "National Emergency" to make a run around Congress, and only Congress has the power to appropriate funds. Both the House and the Senate passed funding with veto-proof majorities that specifically did NOT pay for a wall.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Another factor is that the geography includes areas and private properties that are not best suited by a wall. It would be extremely expensive and not very effective. But all that said, if Congress had appropriated funds for a wall, it would be a legal use of taxpayer funds.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Congress funded better surveillance, using both technology (drones, tracking cameras, etc.) and more trained personnel at the border. Which is better? A constructed wall? That's not what most border experts recommend, which is partly why Trump couldn't sell it to Congress.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi https://t.co/EolurQ5itf
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi The implementation of 1 national visa tracking program would be much more effective than building a physical wall, but there are other things we can also do, such as a secondary checks of more vehicles entering legal ports, since the majority of dangerous drugs come through them.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi You'd think, wouldn't you, that if we as a country can track billions of packages, if libraries can track overdue library books, etc., we could certainly track overdue visas. However, there is no national software that tracks visas. Isn't that ridiculous?
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi The question isn't whether illegal immigration is an issue for this country. The question is what are the most effective measures we could take. Most illegal immigrants who reside in America came by visas - not across the border - and overstayed their visa expiration dates.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Trump had a Republican House and a Republican Senate - full Republican control of Congress - for the first 2 years of his presidential term, and his admin could not make the case that funding for the wall was an effective use of taxpayer money to curb illegal immigration.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Factually, Mexico was NEVER going to pay for building a wall at its northern border. They frankly have more pressing financial needs of their own than securing *our* border. Just as we won't buy a wall for Canada. Trump supporters should have realized that promise was fantasy.
@Clover1292 @mark_dillman @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Probably the greatest misunderstanding from Trump supporters is that if someone is against his using a emergency declaration for the wall funding, they must also against curbing illegal immigration. That's just not true.

@thehoustonrodeo @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Congress, and only Congress, controls the appropriation of funds. Trump, as C&amp;C of the military is to use the funds given to the military as appropriated by Congress. If there was $8 billion for a border defense wall, he could spend it that way.
@thehoustonrodeo @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Tell me, what would you call the administrator of an organization who misspent funds he was directed by the board to spend a certain way? 		You would call him two things, depending on the specifics: "fired" and "an embezzler."

Because if you give it to a president you happen to trust or like at the time, you are giving it to them all, including those you won't.
@DebSpence1 Speaking of Jesus, let's see his opinion: https://t.co/mnXKQIn9mZ
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Don't think just because you may like the current person in the White House that you should blindly support a power grab for the executive that would continue into perpetuity. This is usually how Republics have lost their freedoms in the past, and they usually don't last long.
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Here's one scenario: President ____ in 2021 tries to ban personal guns in Congress, but Congress will not pass the bill. So, pointing to Trump's precedent here, prez uses an "emergency" declaration to ban guns and pulls $100 billion from the military to implement taking them.
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi President Trump had his own party in control of both houses of Congress for 2 years. During that time, his wall wasn't funded. He was unable to make the case to the legislature that it was a worthy expenditure, so now he's trying to circumvent them. Just imagine the implications.
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Also, bear in mind that Congress has given the presidents vast other powers during "emergencies", including the power to halt all electronic communications and the power to freeze bank accounts. Do you really want any president to establish this precedent?
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi the president to be able to circumvent the will of Congress (and therefore the people of the states and districts) to spend money like this. It's too much power in the hands of one individual, which is exactly what our Constitution was written to avoid.
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Perhaps a future president's emergency would be gun control, or climate change, or God only knows what, and imagine that president (who perhaps you don't support) accesses those funds by pointing to this precedent. The Founders NEVER intended (and were very clear about this) for
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi The military budget is $719 billion for this year, FY 2019 (just so you know the amounts we're talking about potentially for future presidential use, it's about 17% of our budget). Imagine a future president tapping into those funds for another self-proclaimed "emergency".
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Let me put it this way: Article I (and yes, it is Article I for a reason) is very clear that Congress, NOT the president, appropriates funding. Trump is using his mantle as Commander in Chief to say he can redirect military spending elsewhere. Consider the precedent. (cont.)
@brianguy714 @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi The major difference between all prior "emergencies" and this one is that this is the ONLY time a president has attempted to use these Congressionally granted powers to circumvent Congress by taking away funds Congress appropriated elsewhere to build infrastructure NOT approved.

@new__millennial This section in no way gives the president power to act against Congress. It solely authorizes action if Congress is unable to convene. Invasion? Who cares? Even if you could somehow twist drugs into an act of war it would. not. matter. Congress DID convene.
@new__millennial Do you have an issue with reading comprehension? Or are you purposely being obtuse? We already talked about that throughout the strand. Not my fault if you are too lazy to read or incapable of following a conversation. 		Congress DID convene. This section is NOT relevant.

@Tex_SedX No, only if Congress was unable to convene. The emergency powers of the president were granted through Congress, not through our Founders. They specifically did NOT want to repeat the mistake of the Roman Republic. They did NOT want to replicate its position of Dictator.
@Tex_SedX Actually, I was replying to IsaLeeWolf. Forgot to take you off the comment strand. I will delete you from further replies after this one. Have a nice weekend.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Yes, that's true.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Among presidential emergency powers are the capabilities to halt all electronic communications and seize bank accounts. Is this something you would want a future president to be able to declare? Along with the power to use the military budget in ways not authorized by Congress?
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi People tend to think about expansions of presidential powers in terms of the current Oval Office occupant, but once a precedent is set, it's a power available to any and all future presidents. Imagine this power wielded by some president you'll personally completely oppose.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Since the majority of drugs come through legal ports, that would be a hard case to make. Yet perhaps they will try to make it. 		Let me ask you: would you prefer that Trump establishes a low bar for other future presidents to declare emergencies and get control of our military $?
@IsaLeeWolf @Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @TeamPelosi Thank you, I was a civics professor for a long time, and the pension from that still pays the bills while I'm earning my new doctorate. Seems fair enough.
@IsaLeeWolf @Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @TeamPelosi I take it as a compliment. But if anyone ever asks a constitutional question, I also welcome their interest and participation in this important issue. It's the apathetic people who bother me.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Yep, that's the section, as I posted it earlier.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Meanwhile, if Oregon ever gets a governor who declares himself King and then tries to invade Washington state, you'll find that covered here. 		Our founders basically thought of every sort of domestic authoritarian manipulation.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi Hope that explanation is helpful. Twitter is a limited format.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi If for some reason Congress wasn't able to convene, *and* you could somehow convince a court that there was an "invasion" similar to a war, perhaps then you could say it could be applied. But clearly, Congress DID convene and opted NOT to appropriate funds. It's not applicable.
@Tex_SedX @Zero_Sins @IsaLeeWolf @TeamPelosi It's just not pertinent. Read Madison's notes on this. He wrote it to ensure that all states would keep a republic under all circumstances after they were admitted into the union. So, for example, no governor could declare himself king and make his state a kingdom.

@TheRickWilson Excellent article, Rick, and it's not only the precedent for other presidents I worry about. Trump still has two years left on his term. If he can manufacture an "emergency" at the border when numbers have been declining for years, what "emergencies" will he declare next?
@MelissaJPeltier @michaelnorth @TheRickWilson Right.

@Oathkeepers @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Americans tend to see presidential in the present. That is, supporters of a current president usually don't fear expanded powers in the present. But it's far better to imagine those same powers being wielded by future presidents, who may embody the opposite of what you'd want.
@Oathkeepers @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec What I am trying to say here is the Congress gave away some of its power over time to the executive, power that the founders did NOT grant for a reason (they'd seen what happened to the Roman Republic with its position of Dictator) and we should all be very careful of precedents.
@Oathkeepers @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Can he take appropriated money from DoD to fund a infrastructure that DoD won't administer? And if so, where does that stop? Does the next president use DoD funds to build solar panels in its decreed climate emergency?
@Oathkeepers @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Which is why he had the right to order troops to the border. But to create an infrastructure project Congress expressly did not appropriate moves into the legislative branch's enumerated power. Do you get the difference?
@freddiem11 @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec But seriously, since the vast majority of illegal immigrants are visa overstays, can't we get some funding for one consistent national program to monitor recipients and report to local authorities if there's no record of leaving when their visas expire? Is that too much to ask?
@freddiem11 @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Their funding was to strengthen existing barriers, provide drone coverage, etc.
@LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary Why can't you be brave like @JeffBezos and just tell us what Trump's blackmailed you with?
@Taavi67828309 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec For example, a president could freeze Americans' bank accounts and suspend all their electronic communications. Do you really want a precedent set here that any future president could do that to you, when Congress votes against them?
@Taavi67828309 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Because the law doesn't give the president to *circumvent Congress* and rule by decree. Otherwise, every president would be tempted to do just that. He's trying to use it to go against Congress' express denial of funds.
@oo_roo_roo @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Thank you, this is a helpful resource. I have seen others theorize that this will be a source of funds he'll take tomorrow.

@CW3Johnston @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Yes, you're probably right (though they can act quite quickly when they have the will), but they don't need to since SCOTUS will handle this, probably with a 9-0 decision against Trump.

@kcjoelh @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec If he couldn't make the case to Congress, which constitutionally controls appropriations, that this money was necessary for a wall when both houses were Republican-controlled for 2 years, or now either, then it's a power grab. It's a matter of constitutionality, not semantics.
RT @mkraju: Trump tomorrow: Declares national emergency in the morning, heads to Mar-a-Lago in the afternoon
@Cosmo2goJohnny @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec The vast majority of illegal drugs pour through legal ports and also arrive via mail. The wall does nothing to address those concerns. Basically, where physical barriers are possible, they are usually already present.
@Cosmo2goJohnny @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec For example, the vast majority of illegal immigrants come through visa overstays. The main issue there is that we don't have one cohesive national system to track visa recipients. The wall does nothing to help that.
@Cosmo2goJohnny @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Good question. Personally, I think the wall is a massive waste of money - which in and of itself is probably all too common in governmental spending - but my major issue with it is that it would provide dangerous false sense of security. Our core vulnerabilities would remain.
@gpgailmp @DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Just curious, if your explanation is that Speaker Pelosi is the problem, why wasn't the wall fully funded when Speaker Ryan was in charge during the first 2 years of Trump's presidency?
LOL @PressSec, the president promised MEXICO would pay for the wall. 	Not the U.S. Military via U.S. taxpayers. Not the Americans who are rebuilding their lives after catastrophics hurricanes and wildfires. 		So, no, he most certainly is NOT keeping his promise.
Wow, veto-proof majorities in the House and the Senate approved the funding bill. 		Have someone explain to you what that means, @realDonaldTrump.		cc: @WhiteHouse
.@WhiteHouse		If the wall is your priority, @POTUS, why don't you fund it properly by putting it in your budget? You know, the one that's due to Congress soon?		Why shut down the government and use a contrived "emergency" when you clearly have a fully constitutional option?
@DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Theoretically, this only further expands the powers granted by Congress and it still allows the Congress to take back this power -- but we all know how this has worked in other "republics" from Rome to Weimar to Iraq, etc.
@DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec (cont.) there's a *chance* that the Democratic House allows him to get his wall in order to establish a precedent that future Democratic presidents could also use. I'm against it, because I think the executive branch was wisely limited constitutionally and should stay that way.
@DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec So, the crisis at the heart of this is that the president wishes to use a power granted to prior presidents by prior Congresses to go around his Congress. It's an attempt at a power grab. However, it gets more interesting than that (to me, as a civics prof), because (cont.)
@DayCday2 @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec None of these prior declarations involved circumventing the express wishes of Congress by funding something Congress would not fund. Also note that Trump's own party controlled both the House and the Senate for the first 2 years of his term, and the Wall still wasn't funded.

@michaelSchmiss @Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Thanks for the sane reply, though, in at least acknowledging that this power was simply granted by Congress and doesn't stem from the constitution.

@Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Beyond that, he'll have a very difficult time proving this is an emergency, especially since attempted border crossings are the lowest they have been in years.
@Ilovechickenid1 @RJersey_devil @WhiteHouse @PressSec Literally, it is unconstitutional. The executive has no power to declare emergencies in the constitution. Zero.

@brithume Brit, we all know Trump's a total moron about most things, so in some ways your argument that he's too stupid to know about the genocidal Trail of Tears has some merit. However, let's not forget he's a huge fan of Andrew Jackson, so it's very possible he did know this.
@realDonaldTrump The most pathetic part is that you think using TRAIL to joke about the genocidal Trail of Tears is funny. 		You're a fucking cretin, Donald Trump, and I hope you die in prison.

@msmarbella @criteria681 @MeetTheUnrealMe @ChelseaClinton Spent some time a while ago blocking every Pepe, suspected bot, MAGAmouth (often the same people) and also their terms (everything from "cuck" to "libtard" to "QAnon"). Twitter's been a much improved experience since.
@msmarbella @criteria681 @MeetTheUnrealMe @ChelseaClinton I must've had him blocked already. :)
@TheRickWilson @thedailybeast So true -- though it does explain her Trump support.
@msmarbella @criteria681 @MeetTheUnrealMe @ChelseaClinton Btw, in addition to my career of teaching European History for 20 years, my mom was also born outside Berlin in 1938. I know what I'm talking about, both professionally and personally.
@msmarbella @criteria681 @MeetTheUnrealMe @ChelseaClinton Here are a few examples: children separated indefinitely from their parents; immigrants in camps; vilification of opposition; attacks on the press; demanding party's loyalty to leader rather than country; state labor power grab; and, of course, the big one - emergency decree.
@msmarbella @criteria681 @MeetTheUnrealMe @ChelseaClinton I've often said the same thing. The problem is that too many people have only studied Hitler in his 5th-12th years of power, from 1938-1945, but they really should focus more on how his harrowing policies evolved. Compare Hitler year **2** to Trump year **2**. Obvious parallels.

@ChelseaClinton @mharvey816 Not to mention his admin's murdering thousands of German children because they had disabilities or were ill... and the other atrocities which occurred within Germany before he expanded them to other nations.
@justhefax_mam I'm starting to get why conservatives have been so obsessed with her. As a moderate, it's not really my lane, but I see how much she's controlling the political debate ... and she's been in Congress for what? A month?
@justhefax_mam It's almost like your state's Republican government didn't ask you to sit through several conferences on climate change like mine did for me. Not taking the bet, though. Just in case they're wrong, I'd rather spend that on a nice summer home in Tirol instead.
@justhefax_mam Guess what state has LOTS of natural gas? https://t.co/Us0LHRPWvm
@justhefax_mam Agree here, and this is also why so much in Europe has fallen (but of course I'll say that: I'm Alaskan)		"Renewables also contributed, but the vast majority of the emissions decline in the U.S. can be attributed directly to natural gas substituting for coal in the power sector."
@justhefax_mam "While the U.S. had the highest overall decline in carbon dioxide emissions, we didn't have the largest percentage decline. Many European countries experienced declines of 20% to over 30%."
@justhefax_mam "indeed despite the decline, U.S. per capita emissions are still among the highest in the world"
@justhefax_mam The problem is you still see it as a game. By the time you realize it's deadly serious, it will be too late to help. 12 years isn't very long. Trust me, I don't want to have to tell you I told you so.
@justhefax_mam Guess you're fine with more hurricanes. Probably also won't take too long for your fisheries to be affected as ours are. No fishing for Kings in Alaska this year. Not commercially, and not for personal use. Talk about economic cataclysm.

@justhefax_mam So I am glad AOC has put forth one plan, and I welcome the political pressure this puts on other candidates and Congress to put forth competing alternatives.
@justhefax_mam because I'm sure there are alternatives to the "Green Plan" and I expect every serious presidential candidate in 2020 from any party to have one. Dismissing climate change as a "Chinese Hoax" doesn't count, but of course I would never consider voting for Trump in 2020 anyway.
@justhefax_mam In terms of cost, I suppose we'll need to compare it to the cost of ignoring our scientists and doing nothing. It's somewhat similar to a patient ignoring a doctor's advice because of the cost of treatment. Yes, it's costly, but what is the alternative? And I mean that sincerely-
@justhefax_mam Neocons' obtuse and prideful ignorance of scientific evidence to "own the libs" is some of the most idiotic human behavior in history. I don't know if our grandchildren will forgive us for following Trump, who clearly disrespects expertise, during this critical juncture.
@justhefax_mam Pelosi seems sceptical, too, of the AOC plan, but I truly hope as a nation we can have a thorough, apolitical, science-based discussion on how we can help mitigate climate changes. Literally every other country on Earth is working to curtail damage, and we need to do our part.

@justhefax_mam @tombrokaw I realize the Congress will need to solve Trump's ego-driven crisis one way or another to save 100s of thousands of governmental employees and their families from potential financial ruin, but if they give into this, they will empower Trump's know-nothing narcissism even more.
@justhefax_mam @tombrokaw I'm not the kind of person who rewards a toddler tantrum with a cookie, and since Trump has shut down the government to get his idiotic wall, I am absolutely 100% vehemently opposed to it. Before this, I was indifferent.
@justhefax_mam @tombrokaw 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄		After 3 years of talking about it, Trump's admin hadn't even decided upon a building material before he shut down our government to pay for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build. The entire thing is LUDICROUS. 		https://t.co/Caq0ntFSlr
@justhefax_mam @tombrokaw The wall would placate people in Trump's base while solving very little. It wouldn't stop people from coming through the southern border and it wouldn't address any other facet of illegal immigration. But sure, let's throw billions of dollars we can't afford at an ego tribute.
@justhefax_mam @tombrokaw The vast majority of illegal immigrants are visa overstays that would STILL NOT BE TRACKED in any meaningful way because there is no national software alert system.
@justhefax_mam @tombrokaw That's not the vote I was talking about. The "wall" (which may or may not be a physical barrier depending on Trump's lewy bodies at the moment) is a ridiculous waste of money that would accomplish nothing other than creating a false sense of security.

@marionravenwd @realDonaldTrump Evergreen tweet. 🌲
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure @BuzzFeedNews doesn't mind your reminding everyone that they were the one who first published the now known to be very accurate and mostly proven Dossier. 		Time has certainly proven their judgment right on that one.
@TheRickWilson 🤔 Trying to decide if we Alaskans should just let you keep thinking that since it means more Chinook for us.
@justhefax_mam Meanwhile, I know one thing for certain absolutely, and only one: I am not going to watch any documentaries about the Fyre Festival.
@justhefax_mam Very true. I had colleague once who had a sign next to her desk that read, "Nobody gets out of here alive." I decided then and there that I didn't need pure reality. Delusion lets us enjoy ourselves for awhile.
@justhefax_mam Yes - - the logic certainly crosses both parties.
@justhefax_mam You know, one of my favorite lines from any movie is "You are what you love, not what loves you" (Adaptation) and the Trump in his mind is a better version than the real one. He's not in the position to make powerful political decisions, and I don't have the desire to take that.
@justhefax_mam Right? I know I *should* tell him, but I keep waiting instead, thinking he'll eventually figure it out ....
@justhefax_mam Did you ... warn the neighbor, or just call to tell them they had a package at their door?
@justhefax_mam Sadly, my sincerely pious family friend does. I haven't had the heart to tell him. #TrueStory
@justhefax_mam "Yep, just coming home from work now ... be with you in a sec, Babe."
@justhefax_mam 😬😶😱😱😱

@justhefax_mam Yes, I can understand where you'd get that impression. I felt the same on the other "side" about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Would be nice to have someone who could unify the country -- but I don't know who that could be.
@justhefax_mam @realDonaldTrump I'm sure she's heard better. =)
@justhefax_mam The problem with you is that you've never had fresh Alaskan salmon.
@justhefax_mam First of all, Mueller's made money from confiscations, not wasted it, and secondly, what's impeachable is decided by Congress. Neither party is in a hurry to impeach Trump. Dems know Pence would give GOP a stronger hand in 2020, and GOP doesn't want to anger his base.
@justhefax_mam Okay, yes, you're right about that, and usually I hate spoilers of any kind.
@justhefax_mam @realDonaldTrump Right, Melania's are fine.
@justhefax_mam @TheRickWilson @shannynmoore To be fair, I'm not sentencing you to watch the entire video.
@justhefax_mam I'd bet you a salmon the main parts of the story turn out to be true, but we're not allowed to fish Chinooks this year.

@justhefax_mam @TheRickWilson That's quite a bitter response to the AKleg(g) video. I doubt that's the reaction the filmmakers intended.
@justhefax_mam Right, it's "inaccurate" regarding the emails: maybe there were 20 contacts and not 10. 🤔

@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Ah, well, search Tulsi's name on Twitter. You'll see what I mean.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Neither Sanders or Warren will be the nominee, though either of them could probably beat Trump - Bernie, especially. He appealed to *a lot* of Trump voters (just proving many didn't choose by policies, but populism); however, he can't win the Dem nomination.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Nope, Gabbard has zero chance even though the Russian bots are trying so hard to propel her (they'll switch candidates soon when they realize that), and Hillary's not running again, either. Joe would easily beat Trump, if he's interested. But so could several others.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Just to be clear, I'm talking to Joe, here, and not you, Ted.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz I understand you like his SCOTUS picks. I don't understand how you like him. I think you are a much better person than he is. But you're my friend, and I don't have to understand it. =)

@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL Tulsi Gabbard. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Putin's switching teams, that's all that's about. She has ZERO chance. 😂😂😂😂
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Oh, if Dems had anything to say about it, Donald Trump WOULD be the candidate. Nobody's more easily beatable. It's the Republicans who should -- if they could look at the electorate outside their ever-shrinking base -- be desperate to find an alternative.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Why are you guys still talking about Hillary Clinton in 2019, when she ran and lost in 2016? We're one year away from the next election year and she's not running. Dems stopped talking about Romney's 2012 campaign in 2012. The election of current interest is 2020, not 2016.
@Bckrda @justhefax_mam @tedcruz And sure, I know a lot of people on both sides of the aisle say cynically that the Constitution is just a piece of paper, but I'm NOT one of those people.
@Bckrda @justhefax_mam @tedcruz Except there truly is nothing in the Constitution which allows for an election to be annulled. Nothing. There won't be a redo here, because there can't be without an amendment to the Constitution.
@Bckrda Well, as a Democrat, I agree with you, but I was writing to two Republicans (Cruz and Joe). I doubt they'll ever vote for a Democrat. And as Republicans, they should realize that Trump is ruinous for them.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Trump is a train wreck and Republicans would probably do much better in 2020 under Pence, who would likely begin with a collective good will based upon sheer relief (esp. w Independents) -- but rather than arguing, I'll wait until you Republicans realize that for yourselves.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz In fact, as far as overturning the election, even if there *was* a constitutional method to do that -- and there is NOT, under any circumstances -- it could certainly be argued that the concern regarding Russia was known prior to voting, though perhaps not to extent it is now.
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz (Hmmm ... just noticed I capitalized President with Pence and not earlier in the passage. Even my subconscious thinks Pence would be a better leader than Trump.)
@justhefax_mam @Bckrda @tedcruz Overturning a fair election is one thing, and investigating whether or not a president has been coordinating efforts with a foreign country is another. Even if he was, there's zero constitutional basis to overturn the election, either way. Pence would be President, not Hillary.

@GottaLaff @Salty917 @jrbaltmd57 Also, it's not really about a wall anymore than a bratty toddler is really about a cookie. He wants what he wants without exception. He's talked about the wall for years, and hasn't even put enough thought into it to decide what it should be made of (concrete see-through steel).
@Salty917 @GottaLaff @jrbaltmd57 Also, don't forget Rod Rosenstein announced he is stepping down. The ONLY thing stopping Trump is the power of the legislative branch. If they refuse to use it, our republic is done. (Same story happens every time a republic folds, from Rome to Weimar and more.)
@Salty917 @GottaLaff @jrbaltmd57 No, "throwing him crumbs" = appeasement. The world should have learned by now we cannot use appeasement to thwart an authoritarian narcissist. 		It will only empower him dangerously.
@GottaLaff @jrbaltmd57 @Salty917 At that point there will be no stopping him. And this time there's no Allied Powers in the world which could save us. 		As I have said many times power, the biggest difference between Hitler and Trump is that Hitler never had nukes.

@T1theinfamous @maddow @Lawrence You damn well can when you take a comatose man with massive brain injury and return him to normal in ten months without side effects and have the brain scans to prove it. Someone's going to make an ENORMOUS amount of money on this. 		I will DM a few screen shots.

@JRehborn In this case, it involves oligodendrocytes and a little old generic form of the old antihistamine called Tavist. It's not even TavistD: just plain little Tavist. But it's the most promising drug for improving brain demyelination diseases and injuries we've seen. #Clemastine https://t.co/iR2eoC9CU6
@JRehborn I wish I had the license to share the contents of the studies on Twitter. One man had profound brain injury and was comatose: 10 months later he was back at work with scans showing a fully normal brain. Another study followed moderate/severe MS patients whose sight improved.
@JRehborn Right?!!! A drug so safe it can be used for neonatal and newborn babies' conditions, so safe it's also used for cats and dogs, available as a generic for people for years, and it's promising for MS, Lou Gehrig's disease, devastating brain injury, cerebral palsy ... incredible.
If you know someone with Multiple Sclerosis or another white matter disease, please share this. 		RE-MYELINATION is hugely significant and had not been previously possible. https://t.co/GjkRLxZePQ

@jedrific *the perfect tweet* 👆
@SalvoSensu You backed into a conversation knowing nothing of the larger longer context and made a lot of snap judgments, based on what? My "avatar"? L M A O.
@SalvoSensu You assume when you ask a question about a man with a gun that you're using a hypothetical scenario with someone who hasn't had 3 loved ones murdered by a man with a gun. In this case, you're wrong. So, no, I'm not going to put my mind back there for your conversational comfort.

@TruthToLight15 @amymitchellart @CalWSportsFan @vinivinidogo @ASlavitt There were a few emails, phone calls and letters involved, but I'm satisfied with the plan for 2019. Glad I didn't accept their initial suggestion.
@TruthToLight15 @amymitchellart @CalWSportsFan @vinivinidogo @ASlavitt After some investigation, I really felt that my provider tried to pull a fast one on us and now have the number for the state's insurance regulator. I informed the provider that I'll file a complaint if they try that again.
@TruthToLight15 @amymitchellart @CalWSportsFan @vinivinidogo @ASlavitt Yes, my original plan had also increased, with a considerably higher deductible, so I rejected that and found another plan, differently named, which much closer to my first plan than the renewal had become.
@CalWSportsFan @amymitchellart @vinivinidogo @TruthToLight15 @ASlavitt I find some solace in the fact that healthcare (specifically pre-existing conditions' coverage) was *the* foremost priority for midterm voters. Screwing up the ACA got a lot of those GOP Reps fired.

@Ange_Amene If my tweets bother you, I will delete them. They're not worth offending you.
@Ange_Amene I guess I reserve being upset for the things off Twitter in real life that I can't control, like death in the family or Parkinson's. Squabbles between myself and my social network contacts don't really fall into the same category.
@calibeach24 @Ange_Amene Anyway, I like and respect her perspective. Living on an island for so long has given me an insular point of view, and she challenges that. I learn a lot from her.
@Ange_Amene Where did I say that you need to change your priorities? When did I get mad?
@FL_lewoo @Ange_Amene Agree that comparing it to WW2 would have been more appropriate in terms of death and destruction and world wide efforts needed to combat it.
@Ange_Amene Pretty sure she meant it's the epic life-and-death struggle facing humanity now. It doesn't minimize civil rights by comparison, since if we fail to stop climate change, it's inevitably the end of humanity, or at least civilization.

@Kris_Sacrebleu For example, Kristallnacht happened in Hitler's 5th year in power, 1938, not his second. Aktion T4 was his 6th year. Trains full of innocent families were sent to concentration camps to be mass murdered due to their religions in Hitler's 9th year. Trump is only in his 2nd year.
@Kris_Sacrebleu So his supporters minimize what Trump's doing, not realizing that he's following the same path others, including Hitler, followed before. Trump in 2018 should be compared to Hitler in 1934, Stalin in 1925, Mao in 1950. All of them became much, much worse as time progressed.
@Kris_Sacrebleu People often compare Trump, Year 2, w Hitler in Year 9. That's a huge mistake. Not even Hitler was full-fledged Hitler yet, and there were years when they could have turned it around -- but they didn't, and instead the world's worst total war occurred with genocide.

@JTempleton99 @CNN @realDonaldTrump No worries, though, I am sure Ted Olson will make the point so much better for posterity than I can. Thanks for being a witless idiot for others to use as a lasting example, Trump.

@JTempleton99 @CNN @realDonaldTrump If he wants to be in the position of banning reporters from asking him questions in his home, he should resign and move out of our White House. He has every right to deny access as a private citizen.
@JTempleton99 @CNN @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/fujYjVRREm
@JTempleton99 @CNN @realDonaldTrump Personally, I don't think any reporters should still attend any of Trump's ego fests. He's lied 6000 times and only uses his platform to foment division and undermine the Constitution, but that's neither here nor there. Trump can't ban reporters because he doesn't like them.

@T1theinfamous Oh, yeah, and Olson won 43 cases in the Supreme Court. Well done, @Acosta, well done.
@JTempleton99 @CNN @realDonaldTrump Hmmm. College undergrad student's version of the First Amendment, where politeness toward the executive administration counts, vs. founding member of the Federalist Society, who won forty-three cases in the Supreme Court. 	I'll take Ted Olson's legal expertise instead, thanks. 🤔
@T1theinfamous Whatever Olson's motives are, he's going to make Trump wish he'd never said a word or tweeted against CNN and probably the Press in general. Wonder how Trump will ever manage to sleep again with Mueller AND Olson against him. AND a soon-to-be DEM HOUSE.
@PalmerReport What, did someone in the @WhiteHouse finally look at her resume and realize she has a BA from bible school with no journalism experience whatsoever?
Okay, who saw my Christmas wish list? 😂🤣👏❤️ https://t.co/OEn13Mv86M
@PalmerReport Don't forget: 		-Russia calls its hacking of the DNC "an act of war" in court filings, opening the door for treason charges 	-Ted Olson, who Trump wanted for *his* attorney, is CNN's and Jim Acosta's lawyer. ❤️
@T1theinfamous Yep. Honestly, if you went back in time to 2016 to tell me that the winning lawyer for two of our republic's modern most sabotaging cases (Bush v Gore, Citizens United) would help defend it against it's top presidential saboteur, I wouldn't have believed it.
@T1theinfamous You know, Dershowitz likes to talk a good game, but he's not even close to the same realm as Olson.
@T1theinfamous Hahahaha ... yes, it does. I love it when the universe comes up with a better form of revenge than I could manage to think up.
@T1theinfamous Another SCOTUS case he won was Citizens United. 	So nice to have him switch sides. (‼️‼️‼️)
@T1theinfamous LOL CNN hired Ted Olson (who Trump most wanted to help *him* with his Russia problems, and who refused) to represent CNN and Jim Acosta in their lawsuit against the WH. He's *the* conservative superstar attorney. PERFECT.
Well, my day's been made. Thank you, Ted Olson! ❤️🇺🇸😊		I sincerely could not think of a better person to take Sarah Sanders down.
