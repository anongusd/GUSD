Michael Cohen’s testimony was dramatic— and raises further questions. We must continue to call witnesses and conduct investigations. We need other Trump organization officials to testify. We need the President’s tax returns.
ICYM: This week I joined bipartisan partners to fight for democracy and human rights by introducing the Cambodia Trade Act. When we fail to provide a voice for oppressed people around the world, we badly weaken our global leadership.
This week Congress passed sweeping bills to confront gun violence, preserve public lands, and to protect our Constitution from the President’s #FakeEmergency. We conducted aggressive oversight of Trump administration corruption. The Congress is finally working #ForThePeople.
The President’s abuse of power to grant clearances to his family members threatens our national security. We need answers. We cannot allow the Trump family’s hidden financial dealings to jeopardize our country’s security.  https://t.co/cauYlVgX3o

Last night we passed #HR8 to require universal background checks. Today, we passed #HR1112 to end the Charleston Loophole that enabled the tragic Emanuel AME Church Shooting in 2015. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Change is coming.
I am disappointed by President Trump’s failure to secure an agreement with North Korea. In spite of our differences, we can unite in the pursuit of peace and diplomacy.
Reports of escalating tension between India and Pakistan are extremely disturbing. We cannot risk nuclear conflict. I appeal to both side to seek a diplomatic solution as soon as possible. This is no time for irresponsible posturing.
The gun violence epidemic is a national tragedy. At long last, Congress has voted to confront it. I couldn’t be prouder to have voted to pass universal background checks, and to pass #HR8 today. We can save lives. It’s time to #EndGunViolence.
Leader McConnell is hiding behind parliamentary maneuvers to prolong the illegal and immoral war in Yemen. This is unacceptable. https://t.co/XQfn1xe52Z

Today, President Trump declared a national emergency – though saying that he “didn’t need to do this.” There is no rational justification for this and Congress will do everything in its power to block this non-emergency declaration power grab! #FakeTrumpEmergency
A judge has found that Paul Manafort lied to the Special Counsel about ongoing contacts with a known Russian intelligence officer during his tenure as chairman of the Trump Campaign. We will continue to protect the Special Counsel—the American people deserve the the facts!
The American people elected us to do our jobs, and to ensure that the government remains open. Today’s funding package was not perfect, but it rejects the President's wall, and provides humanitarian aid to asylum seekers. It protects federal workers. I voted yes.
The President can't manufacture a crisis, and then try to solve it by  usurping Congress's power of the purse. This is an affront to the constitution and the rule of law.  We'll see him in court, and I have no doubt we'll win.
One year after the Parkland shooting, we still grieve. Like so many of the incredible survivors of that tragic day, we must all channel our sorrow into action. Change is coming: I couldn’t be prouder to see #HR8 moving forward. Our nation needs more than thoughts and prayers.

The President shut down the government to demand “steel slats” that will leave our border impenetrable to anyone who can’t buy a saw (or, like most traffickers, travel through a port of entry). Enough. Reopen the government, and we can discuss real border security. https://t.co/FAADicTAmq

The President has dangled pardons in front of witnesses, attacked investigators, and repeatedly mislead the American people. Enough. The new majority will not tolerate obstruction of justice. Accountability is coming.

We can only fully tackle the problem with nonpartisan independent commissions. Stop letting politicians choose their voters and allow real democracy. #FairMaps 6/6
Protecting our democracy takes work, and we need comprehensive reforms to protect the right to vote. We must protect against foreign interference. But we can’t end harmful partisan gerrymandering without making it a national priority. 5/6
Gerrymandering has other consequences beyond partisanship. It divides voters with common interests. If your community is split between many members of congress for partisan gain, how can you be sure people in Washington are looking out for you? 4/6
Gerrymandering is an old process, but the problem is getting worse- new technology and computer modeling can draw ever more undemocratic maps that pinpoint voters and entrench undemocratic results. This is a problem in state legislatures and in congress. 3/6
When politicians draw maps for themselves, self-interest trumps the public good. Picking and choosing electoral coalitions makes the electorate more extreme and weakens our institutions. 2/6
Tomorrow, a new congress will take office, but the threat to our democracy posed by partisan gerrymandering is as severe as ever. Why? A thread: 1/6
Joyous wishes for a happy New Year. 2019 will be an exciting year. We have unique opportunities to make this country a better place. It’s time to get to work.

The President has decided that his wasteful and unnecessary wall is more important than funding the entire federal government. It's absolutely shameful. This shutdown will hurt innocent people, and Donald Trump knows it. He alone is responsible for the consequences.
General Mattis showed honor and courage in his resignation, and his rebuke of President Trump’s reckless and destabilizing agenda. As voices in the Administration fail to constrain the President, know that the new Congress is ready to step up and to hold him accountable. 2/2
Secretary Mattis was a valuable force for stability. He understood the importance of diplomacy, and boldly defended our allies. His departure from the Trump Administration is alarming. The President is acting without a strategy, and will embolden our enemies. 1/2

Our Acting Attorney General is unqualified, lacks Senate confirmation and is linked to a growing list of ethical failings. Make no mistake, his conduct is being carefully scrutinized. We won’t tolerate obstruction. https://t.co/fK5zC0nkQP
The rule of law is facing unprecedented threats. The President will not be allowed to weaponize the Justice department or to attack his political enemies. Congress must fully investigate these reports. This stops now. https://t.co/xmkreKVu7U
No more impunity for global human rights abusers. No more baseless attacks on our intelligence agencies. No more blank check from Congress for a reckless foreign policy agenda. https://t.co/IXSzK69VYV
For the first time in 10 years, the next House of Representatives will have a majority ready to take the threat climate change seriously. There’s no time for half measures. Action is coming.
Changes in Congress haven’t ended the GOP threat to protections for preexisting conditions. Republican Attorneys General are still suing to gut the law. We need to be vigilant as we work to protect our care.
I’m thankful to live in a country where change comes through the ballot box, where we can come together to solve problems and make the world a better, fairer place. I wish you and your family a wonderful holiday.
We don’t fight gerrymandering to balance partisan advantage. We fight it because it’s wrong and undemocratic to let politicians pick their own voters. Don’t let yourself be distracted. The fight for #FairMaps is a crucial issue and has a lot of progress that needs to be made.
Asylum seekers need our support. I welcome this ruling, which struck down the Trump administration’s inhumane ban. https://t.co/8gM4RFTUoy
This statement is an appalling abdication of American leadership on human rights and foreign policy. If the President won’t hold Saudi Arabia responsible, Congress will have to pursue all possible action. https://t.co/OQhCApw3Pp
It’s no longer a distant threat: droughts intensified by climate change are fueling the fires which are devastating our state. For too long, our efforts have been blocked. We need to re-imagine our economy and to slash carbon emissions.
I applaud my Senate colleagues for taking legal action to enforce constitutional oversight of the Acting Attorney General. Matthew Whitaker is unfit to serve, and his appointment represents a serious threat the Mueller investigation and the rule of law. https://t.co/S5saH4N00v

The stories emerging from the path of this month’s wildfires are truly devastating. I thank the first responders have worked so heroically, and pledge to support those affected. Without action to fight climate change, these tragedies will intensify. We can’t ignore the truth.
Our NATO allies have stood shoulder to shoulder with us to preserve the light of democracy for decades. We stood side by side with French troops to put an end to fascism and militarism. Whatever the President says in pre-dawn tweets, I support our NATO allies unwaveringly.
We can't take our democratic process for granted. We won’t allow special interests to buy elections, or allow voter suppression. And we can’t let gerrymandering allow politicians to choose their own voters. We'll take a stand to make sure every voice is heard! https://t.co/CpgZCbEKai
Our nation finally has a house of Congress that is ready and willing to stand up to the President. No one is above the law. We will not allow interference in the Mueller investigation.

I am devastated by the news of the Thousand Oaks shooting. The scourge of gun violence must end once and for all. As we grieve for the victims, I can promise one thing: the House of Representatives is done ignoring this issue.
The Mueller probe must be allowed to continue without interference. Trump loyalist and acting AG Whitaker must immediately recuse himself. The new House of Representatives will take all necessary action to uphold the Constitution and prevent obstruction of justice.
It is a tremendous honor to serve California and the 47th District, and I look forward to representing the district again for the next two years. The American people have sent a clear message. Now it is time to roll up our sleeves. We have a lot of work to do.

Thank you, Senator Flake. I welcome the delay while the FBI investigates the claims against Judge Kavanaugh. The Senate Judiciary Committee majority refused to subpoena key witnesses, including the nominee’s alleged accomplice, Mark Judge. 1/4
Without this investigation, rushing this nomination on an artificial deadline would make a mockery of our political system. 6/6
These hearings are hardly a complete investigation. Key witnesses, including Mark Judge, have not testified. Dr. Ford requested a full FBI investigation, which could corroborate her reports, identify witnesses establish essential facts. 5/6
It is no secret that Judge Kavanaugh and I disagree about many of the most fundamental questions which could come before the court. Every American should agree, though, the high honor of a Supreme Court seat must only go to a person of the highest moral standing. 4/6
Judge Kavanaugh is seeking to be one of 9 individuals with enormous power over the destiny of our nation. He’s seeking a lifetime appointment which would allow him to shape the law for decades to come. 3/6
It is extremely difficult to share a traumatic personal story, let alone to do so in front of the United States Senate and the American people. I want to recognize Dr. Ford’s courage. She is an example to us all, and a reminder of our moral obligation to support survivors. 2/6
Dr. Ford’s testimony was clear, confident, and credible. Her bravery and poise were inspiring. I believe her allegations. It is clear that Judge Kavanaugh must face a full FBI investigation, or withdraw his nomination. 1/6

The new allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are disturbing. There must be full, independent investigations by the FBI, as Dr. Ford has requested. Forcing through the nomination before the facts are known would forever tarnish the Supreme Court.
Mr. President--do not fire Dep. Attorney General Rosenstein. It will precipitate a constitutional crisis.

Dr. Ford is requesting a fair investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. She deserves better than attacks from the President, who, we cannot forget, has confessed to sexual assault on tape and has been repeatedly accused of similar crimes.
The President’s continued attacks on the rule of law have no place in our politics. As the Special Counsel’s probe continues to escalate, the risk of obstruction of justice by the President may rise. He must know that he cannot escape accountability.

Judge Kavanaugh has cast doubt on Roe V. Wade, and expressed hostility to affirmative action. He can’t be trusted to hold President Trump accountable under the law. And his nomination is historically un-transparent.  The Senate must reject his nomination.

Russian interference is continuing, both on social media and through attempted hacking. The President continues to deny the severity of the threat and to treat Russia like a friend. We need huge investments in cybersecurity and deterrence. https://t.co/itZx6J43w7

This @NYTimes article about the mental health of children separated from their parents by the Trump Administration is devastating. This is the trauma I saw at ICE facilities at the border. Those responsible for this cruel policy must be held accountable. https://t.co/NRjDBhHaSC
If the President truly believes that collusion is not a crime, why have he and his allies continuously lied about his campaign’s contacts with Russian officials? Why has he attempted to discredit investigators? https://t.co/f2eiWvpeb7
We can’t afford an anti-choice Supreme Court. We can’t afford a Supreme Court that won’t allow a President to face legal consequences for wrongdoing. We can’t afford a Supreme Court that will bless unlimited partisan gerrymandering. The Senate must not confirm Judge Kavanaugh.
My heart goes out to all those affected by the fires throughout our state. I am profoundly grateful to all the first responders working to keep our friends and neighbors safe.

Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court. He could devastate reproductive rights, environmental protections, and the Affordable Care Act, and so much more. He would also empower an increasingly unstable President. The Senate must block Kavanaugh.
This week the GOP forced a measure through committee which would allow foster care and adoption agencies to refuse services to LGBTQ and other couples based on their religious beliefs. This is an unacceptable #LicenseToDiscriminate and I’ll fight to ensure it never becomes law.

Justice Kennedy’s retirement could open the door to new attacks on the right to choose, LGBTQ rights, and anti-gerrymandering measures. I urge the senate to follow Leader McConnell’s example and wait to confirm a replacement until after the people have spoken in November.

The UN Human Rights Council is not a perfect body. It has rightly been accused of bias. Nations with appalling human rights records sit on the Council and it often fails to live up to the promise of its ideals. Even so, the Trump Administration’s decision to leave is wrong. 1/2
Both @HouseGOP immigration bills coming to the floor this week are unacceptable. They waste money on a pointless wall, fail to end family separation, and fail to provide real protections to #DREAMers. I will oppose.
The President’s executive order can’t undo the cruelty of his family separation policy, which subjected thousands of children and families to trauma. He spent days claiming that Democrats were responsible for his crisis, lying to the American people. We will hold him accountable.
The National Ocean Policy promotes thriving ocean and coastal ecosystems. Today, the President shortsightedly overturned it. This is a serious error, and will harm our efforts to bring together stakeholders to protect our oceans and our local economy.
The President created this situation to try to extort money for a wall, while trying to blame Democrats. This level of pointless suffering can’t be a partisan issue. Family separation must end. https://t.co/FJcdVUbCo5
Last night, DHS Sec. Nielsen denied that the administration’s family separation policy was designed to deter future migrants. Hours later, AG Sessions contradicted her. The policy is cruel. The images are heartbreaking. #Familiesbelongtogether https://t.co/yDYJ8AeBnb

The Administration can continue to try to distort the truth, but over and over they’ve tried to discredit the Special Counsel and the FBI, and over and over their claims have been debunked. Justice will win out! 2/2
The IG report on the 2016 election is unequivocally clear: while the DOJ is not perfect, its actions have been consistently free of political bias. In fact, the department’s activities in 2016 disproportionately and negatively impacted the Clinton Campaign. 1/2
I am disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to avoid a definitive ruling on partisan gerrymandering in Gil v. Whitford and Benisek v. Lamone, two cases which could have helped bring #FairMaps to all Americans. My statement: https://t.co/DNFfmXKDyY

I call on @SpeakerRyan to allow a vote on the administration’s monstrous family separation policy. We can’t sit by while children are dragged away from their parents on false pretenses. Every Member of Congress must be on the record. 6/6
Family separation is wrong, and the American people know it. It’s inhumane. It’s brutal. And in spite of the President’s efforts to stoke fears of mass immigrant crime, it’s unnecessary. The practice must end and it must end now. 5/6
Separating children and their parents is traumatic and brutal. The images of detention facilities, of cages and chain link fences, are heartbreaking. As a community psychologist, I know just how harmful separation can be. The fact is, #FamiliesBelongTogether 4/6
When the President demands that Democrats support his effort to overhaul the immigration system (including huge cuts to legal immigration and the wall) before family separation ends, he’s using these children as a to extort concessions. 3/6
No law requires him to behave so cruelly. Family separation began as a result of AG Sessions’ “zero-tolerance policy,” which reinterpreted laws passed in 1997 and 2008. This means that the President could end this tragedy with a phone call. 2/6
The President spent his morning on Twitter scapegoating immigrants and Democrats for his policy of separating patents and children at the border. He’s trying to dodge responsibility for his despicable actions because he knows they are wrong. 1/6

@HouseGOP Working with my @NRDems colleagues, we’ll do everything to protect our coasts, and the wishes of our communities. 6/6

Women’s rights are human rights. And systemic abuse is all too real. The United States must continue to offer protections to the victims of these appalling circumstances. 2/2

I am glad to see the Senate raising concerns about Trump CIA Director nominee Gina Haspel. Respect for human rights are the bedrock of American strength, and her role in the Bush Administration’s enhanced interrogation programs must disqualify her.
The world cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. The JCPOA is a strong internationally-agreed bulwark against that eventuality, and the best way to avoid potentially catastrophic armed conflict. The President's misguided action has assured one thing: the world is now less safe .

Changes in mental health screenings &amp; more reporting could help to prevent crimes, but they aren’t sufficient to address the magnitude of this crisis. We are the only advanced country where mass shootings occur with this frequency. That must change.

@GOP And it hits the middle classes in other ways: ending student loan &amp; medical expense deductions. Ending state and local tax deduction will have a terrible impact on California families 5/x
