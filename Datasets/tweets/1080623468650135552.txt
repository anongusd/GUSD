@SulliJoeSki @RashidaTlaib Equal access doesn't mean you will get what you need. Depending on your age and current medical health vs the type of surgery you need. If your life expectancy is less than a certain number of years you'll be put on hold until you die. Sad.
@RashidaTlaib If you have never worked in healthcare u have no idea of the challenges. If this comes forward. We will have less coverage becuz of  new restrictions regarding health vs endlife concerns. Pts in other countries have this &amp; are waiting 8 years for hip replacements.
@RashidaTlaib It was not broken until Clinton and Obama broke it. Sending corporations out of US taking our jobs and benefits. Before the mess it is in now, our insurance was 2,100 a year for 100% coverage for 2. Obamacare is $27,000 yrly premiums and deductible before 100% is covered.

@Ilhan Wrong again, I have 45 years experience in this arena. Insurance for all only insures that we will have a reduction in healthcare access. Testing or surgeries will be limited based on productivity of the patients life and quality expectancy. It means bigger bonuses for hosp mgmt.

@VP Without the US immigration laws &amp; proper vetting process my family would of been in one of those concentration camps. My Aunt came by steamer ship at 10 yo by herself to Ellis Island. My father came when he was 3. I went on to give nursing aid to 330,000 patients during my career

He hit all points of what we the people hope for from our elected officials. Watch again after a cup of coffee.

@gifuoh @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump They are still guarding the border.  Cartel stopped but they will look for another way in. That's why a border wall is needed.
@realDonaldTrump I support you...Build that Wall. Congrats to Border patrol in Nogales AZ for the hugh fentanyl drug bust.

@sharongelman @MikePet74472713 @SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett He just signed a record contract 2015 due to co-wrote the season one empire songs. So like I said his singing career is new from child acting career. Ist album to come out March 2. Still smells of publicity stunt.
@MikePet74472713 @SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett Jussie has concert Feb 2, new album coming out March 2 smells like a publicity stunt. Anything Trump related gets in the news. Sad when people make up crimes to get attention.

@MikePet74472713 @SpeakerPelosi @JussieSmollett And he received 2 threat letters and turned down protective detail. I see this as another leftist Hollywood publicity hoax.

@kathygriffin @RepJoeKennedy @djrothkopf @realDonaldTrump Education is knowledge... read the attachment. The death of ones loved ones by those that want to come here illegally is not funny.

@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer I am asking American's why do dems want POTUS to fail more than they want American's to be safe from sex&amp;drug traffickers, disease and illegal criminal activity? Why are they so pro-illegals and so willing to give our tax $$ to away and protect our security? https://t.co/2B5cTnpgKB
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Pelosi and Schumer are making our government looking like we employ idiots. They flip flop on Americans security needs and are in full support of illegals. WHO DO THEY WORK FOR? Not for the American people. https://t.co/2XHmoy016X
@CNNTonight @CNN @seanhannity  800,000 no ‚úî CNN article "Shutdown how many workers live in your state" statistics on workers per state out of work.

@CoryBooker @seanhannity @TomiLahren @theblaze So Cory you say the commonsense tax payer funds of $36.5 m spent on the Mueller investigation or known as the Russian witch hunt is to check on presidential powers. It seems like dems are think they are above the law! You knew results at $17m
@TheDemocrats Yes it's is LEGALLY LEGALLY LEGALLY LEGALLY LEGALLY LEGALLT LEGALLY LEGALLY. We have vetting immigration process in place for those wanting to coming to America legally.
@SenateDems @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Ask yourselves.....why do dems want POTUS to fail more than they want American's to be safe from sex&amp;drug traffickers, disease and illegal criminal activity?  https://t.co/uXjGkPCe5P https://t.co/m82710YiJQ
@SenateDems @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump Yes it can. Can take the yearly world aid monies we give to those countries and subtract the cost of the wall from that aid. Also why not use the $191billion we give to support illegals and provide to overseas abortions?? Both of those don't benefit American safety.
@CNN Support our POTUS. Build the wall. Hey CNN ask your biased selves....Why do dems want POTUS to fail more than they want American's to be safe from sex&amp;drug traffickers, disease and illegal criminal activity?
@VP @POTUS Let's build the wall. Use the $191billion from aid to illegals and aid for oversea abortions to fund. Or subtract the cost of the wall from the world aid we give to Mexico and those countries where caravans are coming from. Easy peasy! https://t.co/0y8ie03wRl
@SpeakerPelosi All illegals welcome. Job openings: cooks, gardeners, limo driver, nanny, housekeepers, laundry worker. No legal citizens need apply! https://t.co/9dFIIV8kA3

@krassenstein @TomiLahren So you support the illegals w a cost to legal tax paying Americans of $134+billion a year.

@realDonaldTrump YES our country is doing so much better. Market would be doing better if dems would quit doing stupid stuff. Over past 7 months POTUS makes a deal has good meeting stocks up when dems starting doing stupid stuff stocks go down. Dems shut up support POTUS he's on the right track.
@ChrisMurphyCT Like Obama care????? It doesn't work
@RepJoeKennedy We are paying $134+billion a yr in tax payer $'s to support illegals with healthcare, food, housing, school, legal aid and sancutary cities. We the tax paying Americans citizens deserve better. Why do you not work for we the people? We don't get those benefits and we are legal!!!
@davidcicilline @RepJoeKennedy No thanks I will watch and inturpt for myself. Like I am gonna believe the left, so two faced. Y'all day you want the border.

@SenWarren In America a parent is responsible for the welfare of their child. Taking a child on a 2,000 mile hike without food,wate proper housing is bad parenting. You want to investigate the child at the end of their sickening tormenting journey from their parent and blame it on America.
Oh this is great Lizzy. Why don't you donate your salary to the Americans who are laid off? I am sure those 7,000 are excited you are supporting illegals. Do your job and watch out for the American tax paying citizens whom you are not supporting. https://t.co/LSOkX2aE1E

@NPR Hmmm if your born in American. Your American. If you serve in the American government your swear in on the Bible. So if you are identifying as Muslim and swearing in on the Qur'an is that your telling us death to all infidels? Since the Qur'an allows you to lie and deceive.
@davidmackau More expensive Xmas present and vacations for me yeah yeah.... Thax Grandma's Nancy your pay from play paycheck is making my dreams come true.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Yes Nancy do your job and support we the legal tax paying American citizens. Why do you not support the security of our country? You support the security of your family and your homes border with a fence.
@CNN Such a great example for her son.
@BoKnowsNews @RashidaTlaib Ahlalalalalalalalalala...repeat that one for us. Showing her true color right off the top.  You take an oath on the Qur'an which is to lie deceive and wish death to all infidels. That is NOT the American way or the American government. Go to the country you can Ahlalalalalala in.
@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr How is she protecting the American public? Aren't we paying her to look out after the interests of 'we the legal tax paying citzens'.  She has a wall to protect her house. Why can't we have a wall to protect our country.?

@sweetglo1191 @realDonaldTrump Check out WPTI 94.5, FOX news, CBN, the Blaze if your getting your news anywhere else it is severely compromised or fake news. Have noticed the extreme bias and lack of true reporting over the past 4 years. Educating one self to all information using reasoning and common sense.
@KevinEverline @realDonaldTrump Have grown up watching Trump over the past 44 years. You'd find that he has been consistent in his business beliefs and his love of his country. The difference he's running the business of America not playing the governmental pay for play game like Pelosi Clinton Obama Waters.

@SpeakerPelosi Are you kidding me an investigation? What and spend more of our tax$ on a witch hunt. If if looks like a duck.... Parental neglect is what is charged if this was a child of UScitizenship. Work 4 us the people instead of your own socialist agenda. Ah when is your wall coming down?
@JoyAnnReid @SpeakerPelosi Won't watch. So sad can't rely on media to report the progress this Presidency has made. So one sided #fakenewsalive when only can get current events from FOX CBN Sean Hannity and Twitter. Feel like media is from communistic regime.
@SpeakerPelosi Same of the Dems. Y'all on record 4 wall support w Clinton\Obama 4 more $$than POTUS asking 4. Why not support your elected POTUS? Unless you and dems are only lip services and are jealous that you didn't get the job done. Work together and  #takecredit4thewalltogether
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Oh Nancy üëãsince the President takes responsibility for the shutdown... then will Dems take responsibility for the murders of American citizens by the illegals you and Chuck support? Why are you not working for the safety of American public &amp; with your elected President?
@SenBooker @CoryBooker Yes the President took responsibility for the shutdown are the Dems gonna take responsibility for the murders of American citizens by the illegals they support coming in unvetted?
@CoryBooker Hello üëã be concerned that you work for us in the USA not the Congo. We have election fraud here also. Let's get our systems fixed then you can advise others with our tax money on how to fix their governments. Work with your elected President. Prayers for party unity.
@realDonaldTrump Of course it's due to 2020. Dems are on record wanting to support the wall why the back peddling now? Jealous they couldn't make it happen during Clinton and Obama era's? Or are Dems just giving us lip service and not walking the walk? MAGA 2020
@realDonaldTrump Yes no security without walls. We even have a gate in heaven. All for proper vetting and immigration. I would not be here if my grandparents had not escaped communism thru proper vetting. Why not take back aid monies given to those countries whose citizens want to ignore our laws
@senatemajldr Prayers being said for unity between Dems and Rep for the betterment and safety of the American people and to support our elected President.
@LindseyGrahamSC Prayers being said for unity among Dems and Rep to support the betterment of the American people and to support our elected President.
@PressSec The news needs to write what's happening not what their agenda tells them to write. Keep up your great job Sarah. MAGA2020
@FLOTUS @POTUS Beautiful decor üíò. Should of been cover of every magazine. Sad fake  pityful new media is missing out this incredible opportunity to spotlight this presidential history. Grateful for Twitter, Hannity and his crew, Pat Robertson CBN and FOX for getting the WH news out. MAGA 2020
@FLOTUS Love the grace and style you add to the WH. Blessing to you and your family. MAGA 2020
@MukasaAMaat @realDonaldTrump Really, I don't see my food labels also written in Russian. Just Spanish. 12 years ago over 1,000 immigrants a day were coming into Florida. Thus putting a burden on the school systems and medical communities. I needed a translator in my our American FL hometown. So sad.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President. Happy New Year and thank you for the great job your doing for our country. https://t.co/uY98GzRSPR
