Every bipartisan deficit group during 2010-2011 realized that #SNAPworks and	worked to insulate it from cuts
77% of voters said that cutting SNAP would be the wrong way to reduce	government spending. They say #SNAPworks
84% of all SNAP benefits go to households with a child, senior, or disabled person.	#SNAPworks
#SNAPworks, it lifted 3.9 million Americans above the poverty line in 2010, including	1.7 million children and 280,000 seniors
#SNAPworks to help the most vulnerable; the average SNAP HH has an income of	only 57% of the federal poverty guideline
Another example that healthy school meals are affordable and kids will eat them!  	http://t.co/kIQ21oI7
SNAP‚Äôs responsiveness to unemployment proved it to be one of the most effective	safety net programs during the recent recession. #SNAPworks
USDA researchers found that the boost to SNAP benefits included in the ARRA	improved the food security of low-income HHs. #SNAPworks
Weakening SNAP means harm to seniors and children and the working poor.
#SNAPworks but weakening it will cause more hunger and food insecurity, worse	health and educational outcomes, &amp; higher health costs.
