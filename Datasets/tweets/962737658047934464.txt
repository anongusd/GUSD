@muchmoresalt No, not give up...debate is great, and we have done that since our foundation.		We should be able to debate and still be decent human beings. We should be able to see value in the people that disagree with us...even though we don’t agree.
@StarnesForOR You got that right.  Let’s do it.
@Center_Main We have to continue to believe that we can make a difference...
If we all are angry and we justify our incivility because of the “other side’s” incivility, who will stand up and do the right thing?  		Time for all of us to be better than what our politicians have reduced us to.  		#timeforsomethingdifferent
We may disagree on policy, but it is vital that we agree that this nation and our communities require and actively seek ethical leaders.		Leaders that seek truth over hyperbole. Leaders that place demagoguery aside for the benefit of the people.		Change the way we our servants!
Independent candidates have the luxury of being able to think independently, and freely.  Encumbered only by a desire to do what is right for the voter and the nation.		Parties ensure that politicians only look after themselves and their tribe.		#timeforsomethingdifferent
We deserve better than the partisanship and division wrought by the typical rhetoric and hyperbole of these political parties.		Walk into the voting booth proud of your voting choices...more importantly walk out of the voting booth proud of your vote.		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb
Consider the amazing history of this nation, the good and the bad, what marks us as exceptional is our ability to stand for freedom even when “leaders” try to hem us in.		We stand at that moment again, Nov 6, is our chance to throw off the party politics and change our course.
In 35 days you will choose how we will move forward as a nation...we can do the same thing again or we can try something different.  		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb
Tribalism is alive and thriving in our American political system.  Our politicians choose their tribe over truth and country.  		This is not just a Democrat or a Republican thing...all are guilty.  		#timeforsomethingnew
As a nation we have given up on the pursuit of truth, we fear the sacrifice that those decisions would require.		Our politicians would have to lay aside self, and bias, be politically courageous enough to say no matter my party, seek truth. It is what is best for our nation.
Lindenwold Day was a blast today. 		I am continually amazed by the people of the district. We must do better to represent them, they feel forgotten and abandoned in this broken political environment. #timeforsomethingnew		https://t.co/ooOMpynXXw
Celebrate #ConstitutionDay by reminding our public officials that they have an obligation to uphold and protect the principles of the Constitution.		231 years ago the Constitution was ratified and has been a shining example of Republicanism ever since.		We must not forget.

Political parties want you to be apathetic and not show up to vote, low turnout is better for est political parties.		It is time to get informed, take a stand, and be passionate.  We deserve better than what they offer.		Don’t like a candidate? Vote indie or run for office.
It is our responsibility to seek truth. In that quest we must be willing to listen and act on facts and apply our knowledge.		Dogma and demagoguery stand, at times, as enemies of truth. Truth can’t be abandoned in favor of false narratives which make us more comfortable.
@yarknarf You mistake civility with condoning.  We should debate, we stand firm for our principles, but we do not need to stoop.  		In a Republic with a democratic process our argument and debate should win the day, not who is loudest or who is most hateful.
We have been undone by an idea that “we” must win at any cost against “them”.  		In truth it is good to disagree, and have civil debate.  It is bad to HATE someone because they disagree with us, or to call them an enemy.		We are better than this. We deserve better than this.
For too long the political parties have told us how to vote, what we believe and taught us to fear other citizens.  We have allowed the parties to teach us that there are no other options.		We deserve better...we are better. 		https://t.co/C0oqGyZQxb
It is extremely difficult to have meaningful political discussions in 240 characters or less.
If a candidate thinks that being elected is about what is in it for them, they don’t deserve to be hired.		The question should be “what can I do to help my neighbors and country?”		#somethingdifferent
Remember that in the free market customers will enact change with their wallet. Don’t like the stance the NFL? Don’t buy tickets or gear.		The prob is when an elected official uses the pwr of their position to influence. I feel there are more important things to worry about.
@realDonaldTrump should NOT be using the power of the presidency to influence a private company.		The #NFL has the right to set and maintain rules for their employees, and face the praise or anger of their customer.		The presidency is better suited to deal with matters of state!

How can we change the deep division in our country?  		It is up to us to avoid party talking points, to think critically, to speak decently, debate with civility, and vote with ethical leadership in mind.  		We must stop the perpetuation of the same cycles over and over.
Do not be content in double standards and hypocrisy, look for something more meaningful than the fleeting talking pts of party.  		Instead look to our freedoms and liberties. We the people are a great people, argue policy later with love, but first let’s clean our house of hate.

@njdotcom This actually harms the middle class, as prem skyrocket, at an expected 18-24% this year alone.  The subsidies pass cost to the middle class who continue to see huge increases.  		The fine for being uninsured will be less of a burden than high premiums, co-pays and deductibles.
@TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump Imagery I do not want, thank you.
If you believe that these insiders are “spies”, than you think it is wrong when the police/FBI “spy” on gangs or other criminals?		Stop maligning the FBI for doing their job and trying to protect the democratic process.
When a person is under investigation and the police/FBI want info, they will often place someone on the inside.  They will gather evidence of any wrongdoing.  This happens in all kinds of cases and is not unusual.		Can we please be honest that this is the way investigations work?
Meanwhile, our country slides deeper in debt, with no solutions from either party.  Read the platforms of all candidates and rarely do they mention that we are $21 trillion in debt, all because of their reckless spending and policies.  		We deserve better.

By calling it free we cheapen the product or service. We also are telling people that the work they do is not valuable. 		If you are reaping the benefits of someone else paying for your service or product and you call it “free” it says you don’t care about their sacrifice.
Every service or product cost something to produce, so every product or service cost someone something. 		Be honest and transparent enough to use appropriate language, don’t call it “free”.
Econ 101: if it cost something to produce a product or service (including employees) the cost of that product can not be FREE.  		Someone, somewhere, somehow is paying for it.  If you think you are getting something for free the cost is hidden or someone else is paying for it.

When we approach the discussion with an understanding of nuances and complexity we can listen to the “other side” and admit that they may have something of value to add to the solution...		Or we can just post a meme, and declare victory.
Issues today have complexity and nuance, please don’t cheapen that by telling people that it is as easy as pointing the finger at the “other side” and accusing them of being wrong.		We are afraid of the dialogue, bc we don’t want to admit that some of our thought needs refining
They cheapen discussion and boil it down to polarizing points, which divide us.  It also makes people assume that complex issues can be simplified to a dangerous point.  		If your twitter or Facebook is reliant on memes, I would suggest diggin deeper
Political memes will be the death of political discussion.		Hint: complex foreign or domestic policy can’t and shouldn’t be boiled down to a picture and a snarky one line commentary.  		If you make decisions based on memes broaden your thought, and they aren’t usually right!

Trump will use a series of laws passed to allow for temporary trade and tariff control by the executive branch.  		Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917	Emergency Economic Power Act of 1977	The Trade Act of 1974

@OrmanforKansas @WahcaMia It’s amazing that politicians beholden to party politics spend more than 50% of their time in office gathering donations for their next election!  Party politics is dividing us and tearing us apart.		#timeforachange	#hamlinforcongress		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb

@JonahNRO This is what both sides do.  They cheapen the debate by name calling and hyperbole that solves nothing.  It is time to break up party politics and have honest civil debate in politics.  		#timeforachange 	#hamlinforcongress 		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb
It is time for this nation to realize that we have dug a hole that will be very difficult to escape.  $21,000,000,000,000		The two major parties simply let it keep going with little accountability.

@Evan_McMullin Both of our political parties are content to simply work on their next campaign or donation, while the nation and people are left without a rudder.  Time to stand up...		#timeforachange 	#hamlinforcongress 		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb
@BoringEnormous @davidfrum Looks like our congress trying to “lead”...they may be good at getting elected but don’t do anything to actually help the people.  Time to break up the party politics and stand up.		#timeforachange 	#hamlinforcongress 		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb
@mattklewis @TheRickWilson Isn’t it time to just step away from both of these parties?  Both of them worry about their next election and do nothing to actually help the people.  Time for us to stand up to party politics.  		#timeforachange 	#hamlinforcongress 		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb
@6abc Why can we not see that party politics create division and anger? Meanwhile nothing is actually being accomplished to help the people.  We need to break up party politics and make a change.		#timeforachange 	#hamlinforcongress 		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb

I hear talk about “repeal the 2nd Amendment” and my question is, why do we keep encouraging divisive and unhealthy language?  We can find solutions wo the hyperbole.  Support the 2nd Amd and sensitive to general welfare.		#timeforachange #hamlinforcongress	https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb

@TheMarkPantano Why do we insist on voting for Republicans or Democrats?  Neither party cares about us, they care only about their power.  How about we look at ways to change that?		#timeforachange 	#hamlinforcongress 		https://t.co/gR5rqS1wDb

We keep passing temporary spending (overspending) measures that continue to place the nation at risk.  We continue to spend money we don’t have, and we do it in a haphazard manner.  Giving lawmakers only hours to read a 2000 page document. Smh		#hamlinforcongress https://t.co/VlFCV7OQzo
