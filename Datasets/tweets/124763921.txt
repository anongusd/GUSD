We just assume that white men are electable because we've elected a bunch of them before. It's not a fair metric. 		We don't tend to attack men as "unlikable" or "inauthentic."		It's the candidates who don't fit the "standard" who get judged on these lines.
We all define each of these differently. And there's no way to tell who is actually authentic--only they know that. What's likable to you may not be to me. And anyone is electable if enough people vote for them. 		These terms are just used as weapons against certain candidates.

8) Finally, remember that job hunts are hard--finding the right fit is not easy and always takes longer than you want. And there's far too much rejection, often for reasons you never find out. So remember that EVERYONE has been rejected for jobs and you will land somewhere good.
7) If you are trying to be helpful and hoping to connect two people you know, ALWAYS ask first. I'm generally happy to talk to a friend of a friend, etc., but it just makes sense to check in before offering someone else's time.
6) Most important: Follow up. Both immediately (or at least same day) to say, thanks for meeting with me, here's my resume and thank you for offering to share with X or connect me with Y; and also long term--it's great to hear where you landed!
5) Also, review the bio/Linked In page of the person you're meeting with. It will make your questions to them more targeted and helpful and make sure that you are getting the most out of their experience.
"Would you recommend I do a House or Presidential campaign" to " What role am I qualified for" to "Here's where I want to end up--what's the best path" but you have to come with questions.
4) Come to the meeting with a list of questions. Please don't sit down and say "tell me what you know," or expect them to drive the conversation. Those questions can vary widely, everything from:
3) Once you've set up the meeting, send them your resume in advance. If they have time to review, they might be able to think through some ideas early. (But also, come with a copy in case they haven't reviewed).
2) Again, their logistics are tougher, so work within their schedule (don't offer up only one specific time), and you should go to them. You goal should be making the logistics as easy as possible for them so you can have them just focus on your questions.
If they say they'll meet but forget to close the loop, gently bump the latest email in a reasonable time frame (i.e. not the same day).
1) Recognize that the person you're asking likely has a job and is likely very busy. So be patient and flexible with scheduling. If they don't get back to you right away, give them some time, ping once more and then give it a rest.
So you're doing the right thing by trying to talk to people--and it's nice to be asked for advice. But there are good ways and bad ways to reach out, so a few things to think about as you do it:
I mean it: nearly everyone who has done this before knows how hard it is and wants to be helpful for the crazy souls who want to keep doing the work to make things better. I can't remember asking a friend to meet with a job-seeker who has turned me down.
First, thank you for your work last cycle. Win or lose, if you worked hard and gave your all for your candidate, you deserve thanks and a vacation and hopefully another great job in campaigns. And those of us who've been there want to help.
This is the time of year when campaigners and political practitioners are pounding the pavement trying to find their next campaign job and as someone who has done that a lot, I have a few unsolicited thoughts, following last year's thread on resumes. Thread: https://t.co/SFs0OG2sYy

Likable is a very subjective thing--what some people find likable, others don't. And voters can't actually know who's being authentic, they're just basing it on who they THINK is being authentic.

And one more: for my own sanity, I'm going to try to lift up the good (people, examples, DOGS) at least as much as I'm talking about the bad. Yes, we need to talk about the bad things that happen, but I'd sure rather talk about people/events/DOGS that are worth discussing.
@damonbethea1 Thanks! And same to you!
@whoisgarylee Same to you Gary! Miss you!
And in honor of all of the people who got me through a tough year, I'm going to try to be a better friend, daughter, sister, aunt, and be as supportive and caring as the people I'm lucky enough to know. I hope you all have some of those people in your life too.
I'm going to go get a check-up and try to get healthy (and maybe watch a football game) for Tyrone. I'm going to try to be a better mentor and more helpful to those getting started in politics in honor of Ann Marie. And I'm going to keep fighting for health care for Robertson.
So no more resolutions for me. Instead, I'm going to think of the people I'm missing and how I can honor them and their lives. So for Dad, I'm going to try to make a difference in the world. And keep reading 5 books at once.
So while I am grateful for the wonderful babies born this year (like my little pals Finn and Kevin and Jack and the ones I haven't met yet like Sutton and Will), I will spend tomorrow saying good riddance to 2018 and thinking through how best to remember those we've lost.
This will also be the year we lost Tyrone Gayle. And Ann Marie Habershaw. And Michael Robertson. And countless others who left the same kind of hole in other people's lives.
But truthfully, this year will always be the no good, awful year we lost my dad. And that is a hole that will never be filled. A bad that can never be made whole or good. We will get through it, but I struggle with the idea of something that can never actually be made better.
I could review the year based on how I did on my goals from this time last year: lost weight (nope, definitely not), got healthy/in shape (nope, backslid), got out more (nope, I just worked more), read more (ooh, I did that one), helped elect some women (yup, and it was fun!)...
Since technically it's New Years' Eve in my regular time zone and I'm stuck with several hours before I get on the redeye back home, I've been reading a bunch of year in review pieces and thinking about my own year...
@BlairBraverman If you like mysteries, it's a good one. I love non-fiction for audiobooks and am midway through Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman, which is long but RIVETING (and often snowy, given the locale, which you might appreciate?)

And I hope that in the midst of the holiday travel and stress that we recognize that we‚Äôre all going through something and maybe the best thing we can offer the world is a smile and a little kindness. And a puppy picture. Happy holidays and love to you all from me and Rosie. https://t.co/B6IJoAErF7
And to those without a family or without that kind of support, I hope you find some peace with people who love you, however they're related, and that you too have someone to tell you how great you are and how lucky the world is to have you. Because it's certainly true.
To those who are missing someone at their holiday table, my heart breaks for you. I know mine is broken and I have no good advice except that a friend told me it doesn't get easier but you get more used to it. I hope you have people you can talk to and share memories with.
So I hope that you'll join me in taking some time over the holidays to share stories with your family. To give them hugs and tell them you love them and know that even if they sometimes ask annoying questions or say the wrong thing, they may not be here forever.
We didn't know it would be the last Christmas. It was a great one--sure, not always perfect, but having the family together was wonderful. Headed into this holiday season has been tough, but I am grateful that the memories of last year are happy ones.

@evale72 One day it's gonna stick!
And thank you to ALL of you who went out and did it. We are grateful for your work and for everything you left on the field.
It's very easy to be a Monday morning quarterback. It's easier to burn down a barn than build one. Just a quick reminder that what's hard is being in the fight--maybe if people take a moment and remember that before they decide they know exactly what happened and who to blame.
I was senior staff on HFA, and I will go to my grave thinking about what we should have done differently to define Trump. I'm not going to work on any of these campaigns, but the rapid response team (to name just one) was fantastic and candidates would be lucky to get them.
And to assume that every staffer on a losing race was responsible for the loss, etc. is ridiculous and unfair. Beyond the fact that you can't blame any loss on any one factor, the idea that people either made every bad decision themselves or didn't learn from the loss is silly.
Sure, staff can blow it. They are rarely perfect and sometimes not good. But the view from the outside is, at best, not clear. And they got in the fight. They worked crazy hours for less money in a job with a Nov. exp. date, because they believed they could make a difference.
With 2020 staffing stories starting, we've entered the time when the people who were not actually in the fight offer definitive (often nasty) opinions on the job the staff on the ground did, based on an outside view that ignores the impact of both candidates and the media.

@NormEisen I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, Norm. Thinking of you and your entire rich universe.
Plain and simple: if you wish for a return to a "simpler" time from an era long past, you should remember that that simpler time didn't offer the same rights to everyone. And while we might still not be there, we're closer than we were.
I can certainly understand the nostalgia for a time when the president didn't make a sport of insulting and demonizing people like him. And I can understand (and I share) the respect for his service to his country. But that's not wishing for a return to his day.
I am sad about GHW Bush's passing because my dad really liked him and he was kind to the pilots--and because I just want to call my dad and have him tell me stories about flying him. I don't miss him in charge. That's not the same thing.
I read the Douthat piece to confirm it is as bad as the headline and subhead, and yup. Confirmed. He is nostalgic for a day when, sure, women and people of color didn't have the same rights, but things really worked. In other words, he only cares if things worked for white men.

They could all lean the wrong way. That's just a fact. So here's a thought: don't fret about it or obsess over tweets and polls (unless that's your job--go get 'em field and analytics friends). JUST GO DO THE WORK.
I understand the desire to look for information, for good news, from the early vote and the canvasses and the polls. I'm doing the same thing. And then I remind myself that there are EASILY enough races to flip the House and Senate that are actual toss-ups.
This is a Kemp robocall. So the man who is trying to steal the election by stopping people from voting and then claiming fraud on the other side is flat out lying about @staceyabrams record. Please prove him wrong, Georgia. You'll get an awesome governor out of it. https://t.co/LIS6WlYW1K

And then, after we hug our loved ones and say a prayer for those closest to them in this difficult time, we can get back to the work that they would want us to do. Standing up for the people who need help.
We can also support their families and their legacies.	For Michael, on behalf of his son: https://t.co/hI3Ftrg9J8	For Tyrone: https://t.co/w9HrQzow3m
Tyrone campaigned for Hillary Clinton and worked for Kamala Harris while fighting cancer. Michael fought for Obamacare while in the middle of his cancer fight. The least we can do is work a little harder to make sure other cancer patients are protected.		https://t.co/AVkJUQolqs
In the past week, both the Clinton and Obama campaign families have lost great men to cancer. It is a terrible disease and I don't know how to process the massive loss to their friends and families. I do know that both Tyrone and Michael would say to go help others.
I thought of her often as we fought for passage and then later, as the administration tried to get young healthy people to sign up. I don't know if it would have made a difference for her, but I hoped it would for future people like her.
When we caught up, she told me about that decision and how it meant she'd caught the cancer late. She knew I was working in the White House as we tried to pass the ACA so she told me to work harder, because "this knock wood and hope you're ok plan some of us are on doesn't work."
In 2009, I heard that a high school friend had been diagnosed with cancer. She'd been a good friend, but we'd fallen out of touch as I moved around doing campaigns and she built her own business, when she made the decision not to get insurance because she was young and healthy.
