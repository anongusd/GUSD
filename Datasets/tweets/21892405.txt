@RyanLizza @elonmusk I'd be more worried if he was on Diet Coke and KFC.
@AshleyRParker Baton down the hatches I say!   All hands on deck!! Summon the National Security Team. Get Putin on the RED phone (he always knows what to do) We've got STRAWBERRY's gone MISSING in the WHITE House.
@CNN As soon as her gofundme cashes up.
@DavidCornDC We get to hear Nixon - Drunk on the toilet ... every day!!!
@TheRickWilson Here's lookin' at you kid.
@JeffFlake I agree, you should do something, rather than rant on the twitter.
@RealMuckmaker It's like a Big Foot sighting.
@WalshFreedom @BetoORourke So did W Bush.
@RealMuckmaker "There is no 'we' sweetie, just you and Jr. I'll say you were good kids gone bad, very bad and did a lot of things that hurt your father. Many crimes, many crimes. So sad. So sad." ... Trumpster.

@MariaTCardona @realDonaldTrump Aided and others frantically trying to keep him from two things. 1) Real News 2) The Toilet where the sacred Tweets take place.
@chrislhayes Add "funneling money" to the list.
@RealMuckmaker The change with him happened awhile back when he had a couple golf outings with Trump in a row.  Also suspect in my book are Orin Hatch, McConnell, Rand Paul and probably others, and that's just the Senate.
@LisaBloom I'll help her -- She can market a new perfume, "Complicit".  Myself I think she's a sparrow, aka a Russian spy. I trust her not.
@samstein That's quite a stand up routine she has - What a hoot!!
@RealMuckmaker Ever since Graham golfed with trump. He golfed with once, then only a week later golfed with him again and has been pretty much pro trump since.
@DanaPerino @gtconway3d Fake News! Come on FOX'ed News. You can do better. Spin baby spin! The parade will be the biggest parade ever!!! Fake News Fox -- Fake News.... blah blah boo to you.
@PeterAlexander Is this what made the trumper's fold on this one?

@RealMuckmaker Can't wait for Hannity's recording with Cohen.
@Comey By Socialist Left you mean health care for all? Better Public Schools? Sorry. We've seen plenty of what Republican'ts have to offer.  I'm surprised to see Comey attack a label here.
@AprilDRyan "What's that Putin? You'll destroy the pee tape for me if I legitimize you taking Crimea? Done deal. I knew you were my best friend"
