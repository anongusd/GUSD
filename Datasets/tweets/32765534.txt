Anyway — “we all have to do better” means absolutely nothing when you’ve created a super-league that only allows well-funded mega-clubs who all play the exact same style. Put some thought into this, Christian. You could actually make a difference.
My daughter’s team won the Gold Coast League (and went undefeated), is top-20 in SoCal, doesn’t play kickball and even has an innovative social media presence. We can’t get into ECNL unless we get swallowed up by a mega-club. That’s a good system?		https://t.co/IGxOdKyYkV
To me “We all have to do better” means “Let’s think about changing a system that obviously doesn’t work.” Building ECNL  around mega-clubs + a kickball style that’s built to win tournament games but doesn’t actually teach kids how to play soccer — that’s not changing the system.
This all sounds great but why do they only allow big corporate mega-clubs in ECNL and not any successful independent clubs with coaches who think outside the box? Why can’t indie clubs earn their way in for a year? Why don’t they have relegation?		https://t.co/PJ2jnSjtTm

Unfortunately, there are only 3-4 true contenders every year. If you’re an NBA star, there’s an 80-85 percent chance you’re not going to be completely satisfied with your competitive situation. And by the way the next situation probably won’t be great either. See: Kyrie, 2019.
I don’t know how the NBA can fix this specific issue, but it completely undermines the concept of a team: Stars grabbing max deals while thinking, “I’ll grab the money now, and if we don’t get better, I’ll just push for a trade.” AKA... Pulling a Carmelo.
Fans and media have become numb to NBA players doing whatever the F they want. Davis could have waited until this summer to do this — instead he imploded the situation for leverage, it didn’t work, and now he’s pretending to be the victim. “I want to play.” This is so lame.
AD now “wants to play” — after snaking his franchise on a Monday to launch a news cycle, undermining his own trade value, having his agents repeatedly leak stuff to the media, and trying to force a trade to a specific team with a year and a half left on his deal.
This situation is ludicrous. It’s been a fun NBA season on the court and an absolute train wreck off the court. If you sign a massive deal to be someone’s max player — here’s an idea, show up every night and be their best player. What are you doing AD???? https://t.co/sSD0ofl4Wf

I like Harris and got to watch him here — great teammate, plays hard, hits open shots. He’s also been traded four times and he’s in a contract year. This trade was weird.
That Sixers trade felt desperate - gave up way too much for an expiring FA. And throwing Shamet in the deal was just weird. But fundamentally...  their crunch-time 5 is flawed now. No lineup flexibility, nobody to defend the Kyrie types. Why not make same offer for Jrue Holiday?

FYI: the odds of Porzingis signing a huge extension w/ Dallas this summer are 99.99%		Qualifying offer for 2019-20: 5.7m, one year 		Dallas extension: 28m in 2019-20, 125-130m range for 4 years.		So he’d just leave 22+ mill on the table for 2020 w/ his injury history? No way.

I’m speechless. Greg the Leg is the new Vinatieri. Who’s up for a Pats-Rams Super Bowl rematch?????????
What a shitshow last few mins...	—McVay kicks the FG	—Safety can’t break up the underthrown deep ball to Ginn	—Saints inexplicably throw on 1st D to save Rams	—Refs with one of the worst missed calls in recent playoff history		What’s next????
Tremendous Rams drive. I love how they used the clock — especially obeying the Lombardi Law and not spiking it after they got the long play to Cooks for goal to go with 40 secs left. So many dumbass teams spike it there.
The Rams need to hypnotize Gurley and make him think he’s playing the 2-10 Cardinals in late November.
Incredible fake punt by the Rams. Really enjoyed it. They needed to do something — this game had 40-0 potential.
Is tonight’s Super Blood Wolf Moon a good sign or a bad sign for the Patriots? I’m feeling “good sign”		https://t.co/6Vsafw8sqv
@WindhorstESPN Followed by 12 years of legit bad blood!!!
Actual Celts fights I can remember off top of my head...		Cowens/Rollins (amazing)	Wicks/Murphy	Bird/Bristow	Henderson/Frank Johnson	Ainge/Rollins	Bird/Iavaroni Max/Moses	Bird/Julius	Ainge/Threatt (TKO)	Sichting/Sampson	Bird/Laimbeer	Parish/Laimbeer
Perkins makes honorable mention but I can’t remember him truly snapping during a Celts game.
Since I’ve been a Celts fan we’ve had 3 guys who weren’t “hold me back” guys during bad blood moments and genuinely wanted to fight if they were pissed: Cowens, Bird and Smart. 		***Not sure about Marcus Morris cuz I’ve never seen anyone provoke him. Probably not a good idea.
Wait... this hadn’t happened yet??? What the hell? https://t.co/GAHDtgFu7I
I thought the Fyre Festival doc on Netflix was excellent. Here’s what @harvilla wrote about that one and the Hulu one		https://t.co/AiPZngz23Z
I still think Tatum has a chance to be great. He has every shot and trick you’d want from a 6’8 forward - but how he’s using those shots/tricks (and how he’s being used) continues to be perplexing. This is the most important thing for Stevens to fix these last 3 months.
My take: Tatum’s game always falls into place when he’s attacking the rim and drawing fouls. Also think they could post him up more esp. against smaller players. He’s only taken 8+ FTA in 5 of 40 games this season which just doesn’t make sense to me.
Jayson Tatum was 0-6 last night vs. Memphis. Here’s his per-36 numbers last year/this year. Strangest subplot of a strange Celtics season — good young players almost always make a leap in Year 2. Cannot figure this out. https://t.co/aGgW8pNxo5

Also — it’s OK not to talk after a game, or say anything interesting. It really is. It’s a long season. You can go 6 weeks being a press conference robot and giving generic quotes. It’s fine.
The best 2000s superstar leaders were Duncan, Dirk and Nash. All of them avoided discussing locker room issues publicly. I think Curry handles stuff well too. None of them would have beaten this “These young guys are ridiculous, they don’t know how to win” card into the ground.
Agree with @tomecurran — Kyrie’s latest story about calling LeBron was a fancy way of saying publicly that he’s playing with some young, immature dickheads who reminded him of his former self. Whether it was intentional or inadvertent — I dunno. But he should really stop talking.

@wojespn Sac could also keep Shump and throw Koufos’s expiring into that Knicks deal. They have a bunch of expirings. They don’t have their 1st either so they should be trying to turn expirings into 1-2 more playoff guys if they make it. I like Kanter as an off the bench playoff banger.
@wojespn Should clarify — That Dallas pick heading to Atlanta is top-5 protected but if you look at the standings, it’s just hard to imagine Dallas keeping that pick unless they shelved Luka and went full Tankapalooza. The bottom half of the East stinks too much.

@wojespn Knicks need to pull off the deal below. Then, they can flip Hardaway (which shouldn’t be impossible) and they’d have tons of cap space for summer 2019.

Cousins finishes 16 for 28 for 92 yards - legendary. Minnesota’s coaching was just as bad. Chicago barely wanted to win this game and couldn’t help themselves.
Also from that House phone call: “Can you ask KOC if there’s any way it makes sense to stretch Wall’s extension before it even starts?”
Just had my first and definitely not last convo with @HousefromDC about the Wiz tanking for pole position in the Zion Sweepstakes. I haven’t heard him this excited/focused/intense since the first Shake Shack opened in DC.
President Stevens closes in Memphis with Kyrie/Horford/Hayward/Marcus 2x - he’s officially fed up with the young guys. (And they’re winning with a minute left.)
I can’t watch another pull-up 3 from Terry Rozier with 18 secs left on the shotclock - I’m at capacity please no more I can’t take it.
I hesitate to overreact but THE CELTS NEED TO MAKE AN F’N TRADE

In 2015-16, Draymond was good for 14-10-7 every night with 49-39-70% shooting and the best D in the league. That guy is gone. Unclear if he’s ever coming back. He’s only 28. It’s bizarre.
It’s amazing that this never came up during 10+ hours of ABC coverage today. Seems relevant, no?
I just want to point out that Draymond has had a genuinely embarrassing season. And also, for whatever reason, can’t shoot anymore.

Trubisky and Goff have thrown for 212 yards combined and 6 picks so far, but even that’s not as weird as Gurley only getting 8 touches.
14 Russians - that’s enough to field an NBA team with one DNP guy in street clothes. 		https://t.co/PU5Ap36umZ
The hook and ladder - a play that only worked in sports movies and Friday Night Lights until December 9, 2018, when it suddenly became the most unstoppable play in the NFL.
Wow - I thought only Gronk got called for horrific OPI penalties. That’s a travesty. Worst call of the year.
Apologies to Bulls fans because I always forget to include Chicago as one of the worst-run NBA franchises. Paxson and Forman are Lloyd and Harry. https://t.co/3rsKgJfd03
Also inexplicable: a 4-man rush (that got no pressure whatsoever) so 6 d-backs and Gronk would be left to cover 75 yards of field https://t.co/nXiixgwVym
Putting Gronk out as a safety just in case a one-legged Tannehill can throw a 75-yards-in-the-air Hail Mary also might be the dumbest moment of the Belichick era.
That was the dumbest Patriots loss of the entire Belichick era.
Oh my God.
First and 10 from inside the 25 with two timeouts and under a minute left and Andy goes backwards on two plays to set up a long missed FG. Just classic. He’s such a great coach and yet this stuff happens every year with him. Every single year.
I forgot what it was like to bet on Andy Reid in close games.

Yeah I said “we” - I’m on the team.
This is a classic “Pats at Miami” game. Two blocked punts, triple the passing yards, 8+ more mins of possession thru 2 1/2 quarters and somehow we’re only up 6.

It’s too bad we don’t have the old All-Star set-up cuz Kyrie/Kawhi/Giannis/Embiid/Oladipo vs LeBron/KD/Curry/Harden/Davis would be a sick crunch time.
Holy shit what a game. Feels like a Game 5 of the ECF. Really nice minutes for Hayward, this is the most comfortable he’s looked. Dueling banjos with Kawhi and Kyrie in the 4Q was ridiculous. I’m running out of fingernails. Overtime!!!
This is a great game. If Toronto is putting Kawhi on Kyrie, the Celts have to exploit the Tatum/Lowry matchup. Great test for him right now.

The teams that make the most sense are Phoenix and Orlando, but neither team should be trading an asset to have a BETTER record this season.		Intriguing possibility: San Antonio.

Fascinating Celts-Nuggets game in Denver tonight. Celts are settling for too many 3s, aren’t going to the hole enough, haven’t figured out their best 5-man lineups yet, and don’t have anyone to defend Jokic. Chemistry looks a little off. Great spot for Denver who’s playing well.

I’m a huge Wendall Carter fan. 2018 is gonna go down as one of the best drafts of this century.
Other prob has been Rozier’s inability to thrive with less minutes. Some guys are just better as starters. Not sure he’s someone who can succeed playing 15 mins a game esp. in a contract year. He’s becoming a pretty obvious trade piece.
Hayward really hurt the Celtics on both ends tonight (and on the last play). He doesn’t look right yet. This is gonna take awhile. Really hard to justify him playing 25-30 mins a game right now - they have 8 guys who are clearly better.
Damn - Oladipo killed us late. What a battle! Those teams are really good.

VOICE OF REASON https://t.co/4oWEjM8We5
That felt like 2 losses and probably was.		Why have Pomeranz on the playoff roster if you won’t pitch him?		Eovaldi didn’t deserve the “L” - he was amazing.		The Kinsler throw is an all-timer. My great grandkids will be talking about it.
Betts and Bogaerts went 0-15.		Bogaerts made 9 outs tonight including the DP just now.		Somehow neither of them were the worst Red Sox player tonight.		Let’s go to the bottom of the 18th!
Eovaldi = Legend https://t.co/R7N0J2HW41
Larry King is dead so it’s easily more amazing that my dad it still up https://t.co/4zgoZ12OYB
Is this gonna be the Eovaldi Game or the Kinsler Game? Cuz it’s one or the other now.
Top-4 Spots of the Red Sox lineup are 0 for 26 https://t.co/GZ7BAJH4w0
If the Sox somehow win tonight then Eovaldi has to be the WS MVP favorite. Finishing last: Ian Kinsler.
RT @TheCousinSal: With all this free time, you’d think Joe Buck would have announced Larry King’s passing by now. #WorldSeries2018
If this game goes 18 innings, we should all agree to have Pedro and Koufax pitch the 19th.
“I’ll never believe that throw went where it did.  More absurd than Tyree’s helmet catch.” —@KevinHench just now
Just coming to grips with the fact that the Dodgers scored the tying 2-out run on a check swing walk, a pop-out that carried our 3B into the stands, and a routine grounder to 2B. Wait I’m not coming to grips with this yet.
@GlobeChadFinn TOO SOON
Don’t know why we pitched to Puig but Alex Cora is a White Walker this month so I’m not questioning him.
Ok
Mookie/Xander/JD/Benintendi went 0 for 15 tonight and somehow the Sox are 3 outs away from a W.
If the Sox win this game I want to take Alex Cora to the Morongo for 2 hours of late night craps.
Bizarro Ed Armbrister alert.
Really hoping we keep that number at 23. https://t.co/YsP4kkpfkc
By rule every World Series has to have a batshit crazy extra inning game.
Wow Cora is whipping it out for this game and going for the kill. I kinda like it.
I’m glad you all got to enjoy the Heath Hembree rollercoaster ride. If you feel sick just sit down and take a couple of minutes to catch your breath.
I would have walked Machado proving yet again that Alex Cora knows way more about baseball than me. Let’s go to the 11th!
This is true https://t.co/PcpEHyZfX1
I love how Buck and Smoltz are completely ignoring that Kinsler scores on that play if he bowls over the catcher or does even a half decent headfirst slide. That throw was 6 feet off.
Kinsler careened around the bases like an 18 month old in a bouncy castle. That was a legendary WTF performance. Unbelievable.
Kinsler definitely isn’t drunk but this is also what it would be like if he was drunk.
Extras and Pomeranz looming. Need runs. Need runs. Need runs.

Cowboys had a 1st down on Wash’s 37 with one timeout and 52 secs left and somehow only pulled off 2 plays (a 6-yard completion over the middle and a 3-yard run) to set up a 47-yard FB, a 5 yard penalty and a game losing 52-yard FG.		Ladies and gentlemen... THE CLAPPER! https://t.co/MLdTJnVru3

Oh man - that Sony leg twist looked bad. This sucks.
Lost in that fight was Ingram’s fantastic FU shove of a whining Harden before everything escalated. That was an A+ FU shove.
I’m surprised people didn’t know about Rondo and CP - that’s been one of my favorite NBA beefs since last decade. It blew up in 2009 but I think it started even before that.		https://t.co/GhIyxr36De

It’s Week 2. The Green Zone still sucks and makes no sense whatsoever. Just admit defeat, NBC.
Pat Shurmur doesn’t go for it on 4th and inches near midfield ... and then a half-hour later he goes for it on 4th and one near midfield. What’s been worse this season?
Worst Picks Ever came within a Lions garbage time TD of going 0-3 - MISSION SUCCESS THIS SHOW HAS BEEN GREENLIT FOR ANOTHER 8 WEEKS https://t.co/ORHbDuwjUR
Devin McCourty dogged it on the first part of that Westbrook TD. Such a sloppy performance by the Pats - take this game tape and burn it. Onto the Lions.
https://t.co/3mHEqm8a9k
None of the unproven big-game Pats (Waddle, Michel, Dorsett, Patterson, Rowe etc) came through today. At least so far. Def missed Edelman/Amendola today. TB has no security blanket on 3rd and longish if Gronk is doubled.
Sam Bradford: 11 for 20 for 64 yards and a pick. He’s 34-47-1 lifetime as a starter. Never won 8 games in a season. Turns 31 in November. Keeps starting NFL games. I just don’t get it.

When you’re in this seat some day, you’ll understand why I thought Zane Gonzalez could be a good kicker for us! But you’re not in this seat!!!!
Pat Mahomes is 19 years younger than Tom Brady - unless it turns out that he’s God, which would make him much older.
Best QBs ever...		1. Tom Brady	2. Joe Montana	3. Peyton Manning	4. Pat Mahomes	5. Aaron Rodgers
Seemed like Big Ben was a solid yard over the line when he threw that last TD. I’ve never been more consistently wrong about anything than the whole “Was that QB was over the line when he threw that?” question. I’m like 2 for 131 career.
I gambled on an Andy Reid team that burst out to a 21-0 lead, had the game-clinching TD called back on a penalty and now seems to be losing momentum... I mean, what could go wrong?

If the Browns tie, they need to dump Gatorade on Hue Jackson.
Only winner of this Browns/Steelers game is Baker Mayfield.
The Browns winning the turnover battle 5-0 and losing by 7 at home. We’re gonna be remembering the Hue Jackson era for the rest of our lives.
Welcome to the Red Zone Channel, Saquon!!!!! We’ve been waiting for you!
Jameis is a year away from being the face of the XFL.
Drops, penalties, dumb decisions and squandered opportunities - what Hard Knocks fan could have seen this day coming for the Browns?
It’s 3:13 ET and you’re officially allowed to panic about your Saints parlay/teaser/elimination pick.
Pittsburgh’s o-line’s euphoric over the top reactions to James Conner TDs are high comedy.
The announcers were just praising Hue Jackson / the Browns have 3 forced turnovers but 0 points. I missed football so much.
Wow - Bill O’Brien’s last 2 minutes in this Pats game were like a resignation letter.
Nice to have Andrew Luck back. He looks good.		Also nice to have Bill O’Brien’s clock management back.
Hue Jackson’s bold strategy of throwing away his offense to keep putting the ball in Roethlisberger’s hands is really starting to pay off.
Nobody is allowed to panic until 3 ET but swearing and throwing stuff is fine https://t.co/zk99vaZQIE
Every time they show Sean McDermott on the Bills sideline, it seems like he should be sadly chugging from a flask.
If Roethlisberger retires tomorrow, I think there’s still time for him to get a good TV job.
Tampa knows about everyone’s seemingly easy parlay or tease with the Saints and they’re gonna make us work for it. Buckle up.
Lemme know when you want me to overreact with my first “Roethlisberger looks washed” tweet of the season.
The first Bengal has been ejected - we’ve officially started the 2018 season.

I mean at least the Falcons are consistent.
Can NBC make it seem like the uprights are covered in burning orange flames? I can’t remember where they are on the field.
Still think facemasking penalties should be 5, 15, 25, 50 and 75 yards. Making Sproles’s head do a 360 is a 50 yarder right? If his head came off that’s 75 yards.
Just googled...	“Is Matt Ryan hurt?”	“What’s wrong with Matt Ryan?” “How old is Matt Ryan?”	“Matt Ryan Tommy John Surgery”

It’s amazing how many NBA teams panic and make all their roster moves in July/August. Like Atlanta — they had OKC over a barrel w/ Melo, nobody else could have absorbed that money. Why not wait, you only get more leverage as season starts and OKC is freaking about their tax bill.
I APOLOGIZE FOR LEAVING OUT ORLANDO - MY BAD
The lesson for GMs, as always: any time you’re in a pinch, just keep calling Sacramento, Phoenix, Charlotte or Atlanta and it will work out.
Houston did it again - Anderson’s contract was untradeable and they somehow flipped it into Knight’s contract which is absolutely tradeable. Now they can trade Knight + a 1st + $$$ and get an expensive wing who’s actually decent-to-good. Bazemore at worst. GSW should be pissed.

I actually think Melo is a good one year trade risk for a fringe contender like Portland because his game SHOULD age well. What happened to him last season doesn’t totally make sense. Might have just been wrong team/wrong fit in OKC. Not impossible.
It’s odd that Wade + Melo became crazy-expensive untradeable liabilities in back to back summers. Makes sense in 1988, 1998 or even 2008 but not in 2018 when so many stars have extended their primes. Melo - no major injuries, not a ton of playoff games, only 34. No real excuses. https://t.co/3F2KEBg5Tq
I would have enjoyed Equalizer 2 regardless, but Denzel playing a revenge-seeking Lyft driver in Boston really pushed it over the top for me.

Remember that Tatum 3 just there / usually takes one shot to get him going. This is an unusually unsafe double digit lead with no Love and LeBron on pace for 48 by the way.
Here come the touch fouls...
I’d love to see my face 25 years ago if someone told me the league’s best player was going to play all 48 minutes in a must-win playoff game during his 15th season with 53,000 NBA minutes on his odometer already.
Any time Jeff Green scores more than 5 points in a half against your playoff team it feels like getting your credit cards stolen.

If I could change one pick it would be Gobert over Horford. That crazy winning stretch Utah had ended up swaying me and I overrated it. Horford played way more games and meant just as much. Oh well.
Can’t believe DeRozan made 2nd  team over Oladipo (better 2-way player, meant more to his team, slightly better stats). Just weird.		Simmons over PG for 3rd team was a no brainer for me. BS was fantastic last 2 months.		I couldn’t vote for Curry - he missed 40% of the season.
KD vs Giannis for 2nd forward spot was unfair. Didnt love how KD ended reg. season but he’s a top-3 guy and I didn’t think he should lose that spot unless Giannis took it. The Bucks just weren’t good enough and G tailed off a little late.

The fans are now pleading for Tatum to shoot like we are trying to save a child trapped in a well.
Roof was gonna come off for That Tatum 3... in and out... Cavs keep hanging around...
Rozier hit the Unexpected Playoff Hero Wall. Get up Terry!
LeBron’s footwork on those 5-sequence spinning downhill drives is incredible. It’s almost like he invented a new way to post up.
The only Celtic that worries the Cavs in halfcourt is Tatum - they are happy when anyone else is shooting. Celts need to iso him at top. LET THE CHEF BAKE!!!

Just watched 4Q again. Ariza and Tucker were phenomenal. I can’t remember GSW taking that many bad shots in a 4Q since 2016 Game 7 Finals. Houston’s D was great. That’s a tough team.
Cannot understand why CP3 made the free throw...
Cannot understand why KD gave up the ball...
THIS IS A CLASSIC
Rockets are scrapping, clawing, retaliating and talking shit — this is exactly what the Celts didn’t do last night, they were way too deferential to LeBron especially (with the exception of Smart).
Here comes James Harden!!!!
This is a tragic month for Chris Paul’s max extension.
I told @haralabob pregame that I wanted the Rockets to unleash Eric Gordon tonight and that he was their secret sauce... Of course I also told him that the Rockets would cover +8.

Tatum refusing to just take JR off the dribble and score every time is damaging my internal organs.
This is the dumbest basketball Boston has played for these entire playoffs. Guess they were due for one of these but man.
Cannot figure out why Smart came out. They had it going defensively when he was out there.
Been waiting for Smart on LeBron. At least make him work a little.
LeBron: 34 of 36 mins, 35 pts, 21 FGA, 14 FTA ... and it’s a physical game.
Ty Lue did a good job in these 2 games. Smart adjustments. Not entirely sure how the Celts are only down 10. Nobody is playing well.
The Cavs aren’t playing “better defense” - they’re grabbing and clutching everyone off the ball on every play. It’s really smart. Watch what they do to Tatum and Brown off the ball. It’s throwing them both off.
I’m not even gonna say it.

I mean this in the least sports radio-y way possible... I’m ready for the @RedSox to make a real run at Manny Machado. Rare opportunity to steal someone who’s put it all together at the perfect point of his career (age 25), and weirdly there’s no *right* 2018 suitor for him.

PAY MARCUS SMART THE SUPER-MAX
OK I jinxed that one....
Thanks for the 5-point play JR.
JR Smith was the worst player in this game so naturally he made the dirtiest play of the game.
Celts missing easy shots and making dumb plays... letting LeBron hang around....
Halftime reading https://t.co/zaRaug40Px
Wouldn’t mind seeing Scary Terry show up for the second half.
Tatum has done this all season - goes thru mini funks, makes one shot and suddenly he’s totally fine.
LeBron is on pace for 100 points and the Cavs are only up 5.
Celts are playing the wrong pace - this is too slow, they need to push the ball and make Cleveland run. Also / Morris killing the Celts.
Luka and Booker is the League Pass backcourt we need.
Holy shit I’m still alive!!!!! https://t.co/OgUv8ArhvT

My hero https://t.co/XkOSZvMORW
Tyronn Lue threw the damn towel for Game 1 - Game 2 in 51 hours.
Tatum can get any shot he wants against this Cavs team - I’d bet that once Boston got the big lead Stevens decided to save that particular wrinkle for Game 2.
Until they call him for stepping over the line on a free throw shot (which he does every time) https://t.co/87POBZnxDp
And just like that... they washed the stink off.
That was the first stretch of boneheaded basketball in a long time for the Celtics. Got too comfy with the big lead.
Celts need to go back to attacking the basket - Cleveland has no rim protection. Tatum needs to take over a little. Key couple mins here. LeBron is definitely lurking.
That was the first time Jaylen has looked like Jaylen since the Bucks series. He was at like 60-70% for most of that Sixers series.
Can somebody at this game scream “GO TO THE BASKET JAYSON!!!!!” for me?
This is the ideal shot chart for the 1st quarter (and this whole series) if you’re the Celtics. https://t.co/dBcnH32BAb
Marc Davis will be reffing Game 1 today. 		Remember, as always - we’re not here to watch the teams, we’re here to watch Marc Davis.

Or, think of it this way...		Morris and Ojeleye averaged 39.6 MPG and shot 31% in the Philly series. 		What if a healthy Hayward had 36 of those 39.6 minutes every game? https://t.co/GbY4a6PHTg
Jayson Tatum played 29 games and 966 minutes at Duke last year as a freshman.		He’s played 92 games and 2,861 minutes with the Celtics (and still going) as a rookie.		Last 7 playoff games: 22.9 PPG, 51-31-84%, 7.3 FTA, 37.3 MPG.
I feel bad that LeBron James doesn’t have any help in the 2018 Playoffs.		Oh wait, here are the active 2018 payrolls for our 2 Eastern Conference Finalists (not counting Hayward, Irving, Larkin and Theis, all of whom are out).		Cavs: $135.7 million	Celts: $65.2 million.
