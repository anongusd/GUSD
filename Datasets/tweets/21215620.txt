“A bad idea”...“It’s a mistake”... “Violating the constitution.”	That's how some Republicans are describing Trump's decision to go it alone and use executive power/national emergency to fund his wall.
GOP Sen Collins says declaring a national emergency is a mistake on the president’s part.
Pelosi: "Democratic presidents can declare emergencies as well. So the precedent that the President is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans.”
@senatemajldr says Trump has told him he will sign the funding deal to avoid a shutdown and will also declare a national emergency at the same time.
Trump says he wants to negotiate, and McConnell isn't ruling it out, but the GOP Leader is urging Trump to sign the compromise on the table to avoid a shutdown. https://t.co/Ujdyw0pdZ8
@LindseyGrahamSC predicts Trump will "do both" a national emergency declaration and reprogram money to "make up the difference" between the compromise deal and the $5.7 bil Trump wants for his border wall.
