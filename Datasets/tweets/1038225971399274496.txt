@RogerWilliamsTX Based on the record, he will be fighting hardest of all for Wall Street banks and payday lenders. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details of Rep. Wms.'s long record of service to the giants and sharp operators of the financial world.
@MimiWaltersCA Has anyone asked why you have voted again and again to make it easier for banks and payday lenders to enrich themselves at our expense? See https://t.co/KsvEMkc40M for the grisly details.
@AnnLWagner The voices that will be heard the loudest if Wagner wins are those of the banks &amp; brokers &amp; payday lenders who have spent millions trying to keep her in office. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. @cortvo
@DonaldJTrumpJr @barrforcongress @realDonaldTrump Don't let WALL STREET AND PAYDAY LENDER MONEY determine our elections.

See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. https://t.co/tTpSgPk45o
@MimiWaltersCA Here's another fact for voters to consider: Walters has collected over $1.4 million from banks and other financial and real estate entities, abd she's voted again and again to help those firms and their executives enrich themselves at our expense. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq https://t.co/ezSBJIrOHi
@AnnLWagner Before you lead her to victory, give a moment's thought to all the banks, brokerage houses and payday lenders that are rooting for her. See https://t.co/zRZhW5sQ8g for the grisly details of Wagner's long recorf of service to the financial lobby. @LizForIndiana https://t.co/R8ACrv53HH

@LuetkemeyerB It would be more accurate to say that bankers and Wall Street high-flyers are feeling optimistic -- and thankful to the likes of Blaine Luetkemeyer for voting again and again to help them enrich themselves at everybody else's expense. Grisly details at https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq. https://t.co/dySLV0lxhH

@MimiWaltersCA @PolitiFact One truth about Walters: she has stood for Wall Street and the big banks every chance she got -- in 38 out of 38 possible votes. And she's collected over $1.4 million from financial and real estate interests. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. https://t.co/nHJbp6wmJF
@cathymcmorris The biggest raises have gone to big bankers and other sharp financial operators thanks to lawmakers like McMorris Rodgers who have built their political careers around the pursuit of Wall Street campaign cash. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. @lisa4congress https://t.co/4guSYnzfqq
@KathyManningNC Ted @buddforcongress exemplifies the problem. Top donors include Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and the American Bankers Association.

@KevinYoder It's hard to work for everyone when you've collected over $3 million from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America,. No wonder he voted with Wall Street every chance he got. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for detals. Support @sharicedavids https://t.co/NoTf2B0ogP
@Duffy4Wisconsin Duffy has collected millions from Wall Street while voting again and again to make it easier for credit card companies and payday and student lenders etc. to stick customers with hidden fees and unexpected charges. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. https://t.co/NaUlmwxyVH
@tmac4congress And Wall Street is fired up to keep people like Tom MacArthur in office, so the banks and payday lenders can continue to be get whatever the need from Congress. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details of his long record of service to the financial lobby. @AndyKimNJ https://t.co/rLC4m1mtTr

See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. @cortvo https://t.co/PnC1uPcHRP
Roskam voted to deregulate the big banks, repeal protections for borrowers against excessive fees and interest, and prevent large financial institutions from being challenged by consumers in court. He's doing Wall Street's bidding--and banking on you not noticing or not caring
Our project highlights 36 Republicans who are trying to rip you off while taking millions of dollars from bank lobbyists. One of them is @PeterRoskam in IL-6: https://t.co/b9ebJurTlt
@cathymcmorris Big banks are the biggest winners in today's economy, and it would be hard to find a member of Congress who has sided with Wall Street more often than Cathy McMorris Rodgers. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. https://t.co/2HRHcADdye
@perrygershon @leezeldin Another reason to remove Lee Zeldin from Congress: his conspicuous record of service to big banks, payday lenders and other financial entities. See https://t.co/SujTwv3fnq for the grisly details. https://t.co/gFfSt7BJmI
@MimiWaltersCA And the financial industry and real estate lobby has spent 1.4 million on Rep. Mimi Walters over the years as she has worked to deregulate banks and make it easier for credit card companies to stick people with hidden fees https://t.co/xAa0eYoQQo
Read more at our website, https://t.co/JV6CUHvBVG. And check out @AndyKimNJ, who is running against Rep. MacArthur. Kim's campaign has pledged not to accept corporate PAC money.		Vote out the Flunkies!
No costume: @RepTomMacArthur is tricking consumers and treating banks, but he's not even hiding it. His top campaign contributors include Goldman Sachs, UBS, and BoA. In total, he has taken over $1 mil from financial and real estate interests.
Treat: @RepTomMacArthur wants to repeal the Volcker Rule, which prevents banks from making risky gambles with insured deposits (people's bank accounts!) It's a treat for banks who want profits from risky bets, but don't want to pay up if their speculative investments go wrong.
Financial regulation, Halloween edition! 👻 Trick-or-treating with @RepTomMacArthur 🎃		Trick: Rep. MacAuthor said his support of S. 2155 was about small, community banks. Actually, the bill exempted 25 banks with assets from $50-$250 billion from post-crisis rules and oversight!
@RepHultgren Hey @RepHultgren, why have you introduced legislation written nearly word for word by Citigroup lobbyists? https://t.co/t01alWL4cD

@chmtchr12 @SeanCasten @VoteCasten @ACE_Naperville The tax cuts weren't meant for you.

He's being challenged by @deanbphillips, who doesn't take money from PACs, special interest groups, or federal lobbyists. Read more at https://t.co/rvgdhNGG4b
Or maybe Rep. Paulsen is voting this way because he's bankrolled by the financial industry, with contributions of $10,000 or more from US Bancorp, Thrivent, Capital One, Northwestern Mutual, Wells Fargo, MetLife , Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bank of America, and more.
Did you know @RepErikPaulsen voted to deregulate the Big 3 credit rating agencies and loosen the conflict of interest rules that were out in place after the financial crisis? Maybe he didn't remember that scene from The Big Short
Did you know @RepErikPaulsen supports forced arbitration, which robs people of legal recourse and prevents consumers from suing banks and financial companies in court?
Did you know @RepErikPaulsen voted to repeal the "Volcker Rule," which prevents Wall Street banks from making risky speculations on YOUR insured deposits?

@lisa4congress Why did @cathymcmorris vote for 38 bills to deregulate Wall Street and make it easier for banks to trap consumers in debt? Maybe it's b/c her campaign is funded by the biggest banks, financial institutions, and payday lenders https://t.co/mKY4H2Mxpo
@golden4congress Why did @BrucePoliquin vote for a bill allowing payday lenders to charge triple digit interest on loans to Mainers? Maybe it's b/c his campaign is funded by Ace Cash Express, Lending Tree, Advance America, Cash America, and the Online Lenders Association https://t.co/6sjLmeOw6m
@WMTWTV Here's a different kind of candidate profile of @BrucePoliquin: He has taken over $2 mil from Citigroup, BoA, Goldman Sachs, and other Wall Street banks. A financial industry trade group thanked him for building a “pro-banking bench in Congress.” https://t.co/6sjLmeOw6m
