@InnerN3rd these make a lot of sense
@InnerN3rd i think their going to get Finn Balor,the club,asuka and start the Miz Bryan feud
@cagesideseats most of the names are people that haven't fared well on smackdown,i hope they have more success on raw
@WWEColt Jeff Hardy. The Revival or Gallows and Anderson,Absolution
@WWECritics i think they are getting at least one big name
@WWECritics Raw got a ton of callups and returns so i'm not really that surprised
RT @WrestlingInc: POLL TIME! RT if you give #Raw a THUMBS UP...		OR...
@WrestlingInc favorite Bobby Roode. least favorite Mahal
@ProWrestlingMag Smackdown has clearly won the superstar shakeup
@JDfromNY206 if i was booking this match,i would have Roode turn on his team and cost them the match
@realschmidtking she's gotten rid of all the dead weight
@GlennRubenstein @WrestlingInc Smackdown will definitely be improved. all the people that have been dragging the show down are now on raw
RT @JDfromNY206: Samoa Joe...		The RIGHT SAMOAN for the #UniversalChampionship #Raw		RT is agree
@SeanRossSapp so far SD is winning the superstar shakeup.
@WrestlingInc this probably means smackdown will get Mandy and Sonya
@JDfromNY206 this shakeup is terrible. i'm calling it now. Sonya Deville and Mandy Rose are going to Smackdown
@WrestlingInc i'm sick of this. Sasha and Bayley need to be split
@JDfromNY206 i bet Jeff Hardy will be on Smackdown tomorrow
@RajGiri_303 @WrestlingInc i totally am. i don't see Rollins leaving raw
@GlennRubenstein @WrestlingInc could be. i have a feeling Jeff is going to SD
@WrestlingInc i think Jeff goes to SD
@JDfromNY206 maybe Jeff wins the title and goes to Smackdown and faces Orton at Backlash instead
@JDfromNY206 Mahal is a huge turn off
@RobbyTheBrain Rollins and Jinder is not a fair trade
@RobbyTheBrain the wwe has no idea what their doing

@RobbyTheBrain the wwe just released a new Raw is Rallins shirt so i don't think Seth will move
@WrestlingSheet Finn Balor to SD and split Orton and Mahal so we don't have to see anymore matches between the two

@jamdownrocks @Budini not looking forward to this
@jamdownrocks not surprised
@erika_kay10 @Sure_Jan__ @jamdownrocks their probably gonna make everyone feel so guilty for the way they treated her
@erika_kay10 @jamdownrocks probably,that will further isolate Victoria
@JTRules1 @jamdownrocks i heard JT punches Victoria soon
@jamdownrocks i heard JT is gonna start hitting Victoria soon
@jamdownrocks i think Victor is gonna fire Victoria when he finds out what she did,that will leave her all alone with JT
@_DaveBedford isolation tactic. i think JT is going to isolate Victoria from her family soon
@jetergirl410 KA was solid on OLTL,she really went downhill on GH
@NE_Newmans @acejordan23 @malyoung @deepsoap it's sad they think this way
@jetergirl410 the bright side about Summer returning is it could stop Phyllis from chasing after Nick
@soapcentral i think cbs is scared to tell a LGBT storyline
@splashdpow it's not good and they way JT is talking to Victoria is yuck
@splashdpow he's barely on the show anymore. it's sad they won't give Michael and Lauren a story
@splashdpow @MarkHToo i don't want Phyllis in this story
@KingMinos777 the show could have done better
@splashdpow very rarely
@splashdpow i hope it works this time
@noelleharmony i have a feeling the show may be heading down some sort of abuse angle
@acejordan23 i'm really hating the writing for Victoria. their making her so unlikable
@KingMinos777 @JoshuaMorrowYR @ameliamheinle @YandR_CBS lol
@lostdogs20 absolutely. i don't like Phyllis getting obsessed with Nick. and JT and Victoria's dialogue is horrendous
@huner0909 i don't like Phyllis involved in this
@whoknowstv he'll probably lose it
@WhitneyFurr1 yes
@soapparty411 i wonder if he'll fire Victoria
@LeighSoapFan @splashdpow based on what i've seen onscreen probably
@Ksweety26 Victoria is using JT
@WhitneyFurr1 this is gonna blow up in Jack and Victoria's face
@LeighSoapFan i think she'll start acting different and people will become suspicious
@splashdpow i think it's just rumor. it hasn't been confirmed by any credible source
@Ksweety26 she's gonna lose big
@sweetsucre Victor would be so stupid if he believes this
@dcconfidential GH by far
@dcconfidential Days
@KingMinos777 @ameliamheinle @YandR_CBS @CBSDaytime what a horrible thing to say
@KingMinos777 @ameliamheinle @YandR_CBS @CBSDaytime JT is wearing Victoria down
@dcconfidential Victoria needs a downfall
@THEBEST11985 Chelsea should have found out about Victor's connection to Chloe before she left
@THEBEST11985 it's a shame their doing this to this character
@THEBEST11985 it's garbage. i don't know what Mal is thinking
@THEBEST11985 it doesn't make a lot of sense
@THEBEST11985 this earthquake should of been done to cut down the cast size. i can think of a good 10 to 15 people that need to go
@THEBEST11985 the showrunners have no idea what they are doing
RT @BigBBfan1: I must say that #YR is VERY lucky to have Sharon Case. She is such a talent
@soapparty411 i hope there's a backstory to explain this behavior.
@_DaveBedford @Sure_Jan__ @Mistyrose78 i hope she stays
@Mistyrose78 @ameliamheinle Victoria is heading for a breakdown
@Mistyrose78 JT is coming off as very emotionally abusive
@Mistyrose78 @malyoung their are no strong women left. do they not realize this is a women's genre
@Sure_Jan__ disgusting
@l3nee91 @malyoung @AngelicaMcD for Valentine's Day,Mal gave us JT yelling at Victoria so of course the numbers were down
@Sure_Jan__ fans are really loving his work lol!
@Sure_Jan__ @malyoung i don't get it. it's terrible Mal thinks this way
@erika_kay10 @_DaveBedford the writers need to go back and look at the history of the show
@Mistyrose78 she's getting worn down
@MarkHToo yuck
@Sure_Jan__ it's very bizarre
@Sure_Jan__ this doesn't sound like Mac. the Mac i know would have warned Victoria immediately
@Sure_Jan__ @Soapyfan8 what an awful storyline
@_DaveBedford i have a felling there's gonna be some big showdown where JT turns violent
@AlanSarapa my biggest complaint with this story is their using the wrong characters to tell it
@AmandaNicole047 @jamdownrocks she might be a Summer recast. i heard they were bringing Summer back
@qsteph @jamdownrocks she played Starr on OLTL and Kiki on GH
@jamdownrocks Summer recast?
@jamdownrocks Pratt
@Laurene__o_O @malyoung romance has really been lacking since Mal's work started airing
@Laurene__o_O it looks really boring
@Laurene__o_O lol
@Laurene__o_O they have to isolate Victoria
@Laurene__o_O that's what i've been saying. Jt was gone for years,he could've changed
@jetergirl410 @Laurene__o_O maybe a Summer recast. i've heard she's coming back
@Laurene__o_O i think it's that he knows about Christian
@SkyLizzels they waited too long. this should have been done two years ago
@noelleharmony i think their doing an abuse storyline
@soapoperafan Victoria needs to be taken down a notch
@JJDUX he's disgusting
@_DaveBedford how bad is it gonna get
@CandaceLYoung @londah1005 @mnvixen52 @unlimitedjason the JT stuff is really hard to watch
@CandaceLYoung @noelleharmony @Naxie_Killy_Fan i'm getting the feeling something is gonna happen to Bill and their are gonna be multiple suspects
@theniajones something's gonna happen. JT is a ticking time bomb
@SOAPFanTweets @wally_lw it's only gonna get worse
@wally_lw i thought they nixed that but apparently not
RT @wally_lw: #YR abuse story with JT is coming can't believe Mal is going that route. That is not who JT is.
@verna_61 why doesn't she throw him out
@curiouslyavery i don't get what these writers are thinking
@curiouslyavery i don't wanna see that
@mookiemcclove it certainly looks like their heading to an abuse storyline
@verna_61 i don't like this story. JT and Victoria are being written out of character
@totaldramafan35 @jamdownrocks he needs to step down as writer and just be the producer
@jamdownrocks @erika_kay10 @SkyLizzels maybe the heart drugs he's taking
@XavierToups the school shooting and the olympics drove down the numbers. the demos for the cbs soaps are starting to get scary. the cbs soaps are losing young viewers by the droves
@CaneAshbyfans @SoapOperaNetwrk the show is awful
@MeElectra Chelsea's exit was horrible,one of the worst written exit stories https://t.co/JaJZ1jxm8S made no sense. i've given up B&amp;B,that show is so boring. i'm sick of Steffy and Liam show
@SoapVet the balance of the show is not good. we see the same few people everyday,while everyone else gets neglected. where is Michael and Lauren?
@jmhooksline @jamdownrocks the stories are not good
@WrecklessLove #YR is a pain to get through,the show is not very good. i enjoy #Days a lot more
@jamdownrocks their vow renewal was the lowest rated episode of the week
@l3nee91 @erika_kay10 i agree. my biggest complaint about this story is it makes no sense for JT to be the abuser. this is a character i have watched for nearly 20 years and i have never seen JT like this
@mslovely3000 @l3nee91 @malyoung @AngelicaMcD i think they are. JT is already yelling at Victoria
@LeighSoapFan judging by what i've seen on the screen,it looks like their heading toward JT being an abuser
@erika_kay10 @l3nee91 if they wanted to do an abuse story,they should of done it with someone else because this doesn't fit JT and Victoria's characters
@FoxRoxB it's completely out of character. JT and Victoria are the wrong people to do a abuse story with because it doesn't fit their characters
@Beachgurl1401 @FoxRoxB we can't get a LGBT story but they will have a man beating a woman. do they know this is a women's genre
@l3nee91 @malyoung i fear this is leading to JT abusing Victoria
@_DaveBedford this story is trash
@NE_Newmans @SoapOperaNetwrk @AngelicaMcD @SteveKentSony @YandR_CBS @malyoung it was. the show is not good. Chelsea's exit story was horrendous and now we have this rumored JT beating Victoria story coming. the numbers could get even worse
@GloShine97 bad writing
@LafayetteMom04 Chelsea's exit story was complete trash and it looks like viewers tuned out
@jetergirl410 the numbers are not really surprising. the show is not very good
@_DaveBedford this soap deserves to lose all of it's viewers if this happens. it's complete character assassination of JT
@jamdownrocks it's rumored to be happening in the next few weeks
@_DaveBedford i think JT's gonna start hitting her soon
@soapsindepthcbs the show waited too long. they should have done it when Adam was still there
@SkyLizzels i think JT did something
@TopTVTweets @_DaveBedford i believe the soap mags
@_DaveBedford i thought they dropped the dv story
RT @SethMacFarlane: Trump: ‚ÄúI really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon." https://t.co/sJshZ4rN94
@soapsindepthcbs something seems off about JT
@FarrisFlagg @jmcrenny me neither
@jmcrenny Chelsea's exit was so badly written
@WrestlingInc 5 it felt real maybe the best promo of Reigns career
@WrestlingInc it's off to a bad start
@WrestlingInc Mickie was the big loser in all of this
@WrestlingInc i don't know why Mickie is with Alexa,Alexa doesn't need her
@cagesideseats seemed more comfortable
@cagesideseats this would be a great match
RT @WrestlingInc: POLL TIME!		RT if you give #RAW a THUMBS UP!
@brookebillfan @BandB_CBS @KatherineKellyL @Iamthorstenkaye @don_diamont nobody should be surprised. no one wanted Bridge
@MarkHToo all they do is recycle the same stories. it's a shame their wasting KKL on fake Ridge
RT @WrestlingInc: Or...		RT if you give #WWEChamber a THUMBS DOWN!
@Jamey_Giddens it's sad this show can't make a good teen scene anymore
@Jamey_Giddens differen't showrunner
@yogachampagne @MaineFinFan @Jamey_Giddens exactly. JFP brought nobody back for their 40th
@Jamey_Giddens so much better than their 40th. i don't think they brought anyone back for that
@YRcritic @malyoung they need to do a better job in building up the younger characters.
@TheMikeGoldberg it's not really that surprising. this show has had numerous regime changes in recent years with weak writing and they still don't know how to develop younger characters
@soapsindepthcbs they had no chemistry and were just thrown together
