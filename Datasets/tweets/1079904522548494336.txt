Protect our borders!!!!!
Where is our voice? Isnt that why we vote?
Where are the debates?
I support the Dreamers of America. Not blindly. Only those who share our American ideals and contribute in a positive manner should be granted citizenship. After proper vetting.
I support Americans first.
I also believe that the pathway to citizenship is too hard. So much red tape. We dont need open borders just proper vetting. How many jobs can we create just in immigration?
Do we need immigration? In my average american opinion, yes we do! This land is for all who want the American dream and freedom to live in a society free of oppression of ones personal beliefs.
The immigration battle is the most absurd political battle in American history.
Build the Wall/barrier. Call it what you like. Obama and Trump once agreed on this. Didn't Obama start the building anyway?
It is my belief that immigration is the one thing we all agreed on. Why are we fighting and dividing the country on a fundamentally agreed upon subject?
Immigration!!!!!! What is the point of the fight? Isn't it true that immigration is the back bone of our great land?
The time has come for those who stand up for America to speak out against partisan antics.
