The only way for lasting peace w/ North Korea is complete, verifiable, and irreparable denuclearization.		POTUS was absolutely right to walk away from talks when Kim Jong Un took that option off the table.
Preventing acts of mass violence and protecting the rights our Constitution secures are not mutually exclusive policy objectives. H.R. 8 &amp; H.R. 1112 fail to fully accomplish either of these critical priorities.
Headed to the floor to speak in favor of S.47 The Natural Resources Management Act. This bill will provide for long term sustainability of LWCF and ensure Americans can enjoy wildlife and the outdoors for generations to come.
On SPF, one of my top priorities has been providing oversight on surface warfare training reforms &amp; working towards solutions to systemic problems facing the surface warfare community today. It is absolutely critical that we make these changes to protect our sailors at sea.
We will continue working with the Navy to ensure the proper readiness of our fleet and safety of our sailors.
The Navy has taken steps to correct deficient readiness. However, there are still systemic readiness deficiencies across the entire fleet that will take years of leadership focus and sustained funding to address.
Today @HASCRepublicans Seapower &amp; Readiness Subcommittees examine the Navy‚Äôs progress in implementing reforms outlined in the Comprehensive Review (CR) and Strategic Readiness Reviews (SRR) to prevent collisions.
Dollars secured in recent funding bills certainly go a long way, but broadband needs to be a part of the conversation for any infrastructure legislation too.
Our focus should be on the smartest ways to couple public dollars with private investment to expand access and enhance economic development.
The most effective way to build out an affordable network‚Äîleverage state, federal &amp; private dollars. The federal government shouldn‚Äôt be the sole provider here. Time and time again we‚Äôve seen government run networks fail to reach the truly unserved.

Tonight, @POTUS outlined a bold, bipartisan agenda, with a clear path forward for America. ‚Üí My statement: https://t.co/NsYXSSdrEp		#SOTU
There‚Äôs room for common ground to deliver results for the American people when it comes to: 		Maintaining military readiness	Rebuilding our infrastructure	Lowering health care costs.		Let‚Äôs‚Äô get to work. #SOTU
I agree that in this political moment we face a critical choice-- will resistance and retribution define the next two years or will we work together to deliver a strong, safe, and prosperous America? I choose the latter. #SOTU
The past 2 yrs of defense spending allowed our military to grow, strengthen &amp; prosper. Funding levels should be continued in FY20 and enabled by a budget cap deal to stem the effects of sequestration. Our military depends on it. Our country‚Äôs security depends on it #SOTU
We have made such strides towards rebuilding our military, including finally delivering a full year of appropriations for the first time in a decade. We must not lose the momentum that we have worked so hard to build. #SOTU
Thank you @POTUS for affirming the right to life. I know this means a lot to the countless constituents I‚Äôve had call in about late-term abortion this past week. #SOTU
We need a health care system that protects individuals w/ pre-existing conditions and empowers individuals and families to make decisions for themselves based on what best fits their needs, wants, and budget. #SOTU
Other #VA01 projects I‚Äôll be working to include address this Congress: 	Replacing Norris Bridge	Widening &amp; depending Virginia port	Extending I-95 Express Lanes	Lane expansion of Route 301	Addressing I-66 tolls	Resolving the Coleman Bridge toll		#SOTU
.@POTUS is emphasizing how an infrastructure package will unleash economic growth. Broadband investment must be a priority. Rural Broadband will play a critical role in bringing health care costs down, connecting rural economies, &amp; unleashing untapped economic growth. #SOTU
I‚Äôve been waiting for my colleagues to come to the negotiation table and finally recognize the crisis at our border for the true threat to our national security and sovereignty that it is. Can‚Äôt delay any longer. #SOTU
Our immigration system is broken. It‚Äôs very clear border security is national security, and without strong, serious changes we are putting our entire country at risk. #SOTU
Success from reg rollback &amp; tax reform is unmatched. To sustain the growth we‚Äôve got to think long term. That means preparing our workforce to meet the needs of a 21st century economy.
A lot gets lost between headlines &amp; partisan bickering. But the fact is our economy is producing record job numbers, creating opportunities for Americans from every single walk of life. 		That's worth celebrating! #SOTU
Yes, Mr. President! Nothing in the world can compete with America! üá∫üá∏#SOTU

H.R. 6157 maintains our commitment to support our warfighters and I was proud to vote in favor of it today! It is critical that we provide reliable funding to support those who put their lives on the line for our freedom.
It is critical that Congress pass the defense funding bill before the end of the fiscal year to avoid another harmful CR. The House took the first step to avoiding that today!
Honored to be named a conferee for #FY19NDAA. Ready to work with my colleagues as we begin restoring military readiness and rebuilding our Fleet.

Overall, the Chairman‚Äôs mark better addresses our future readiness challenges. It accelerates the 355-ship navy and the expected projection forces our nation so desperately needs.  #FY19NDAA
In brief, we authorized the 4th Ford-class Aircraft carrier, expanded procurement of the Littoral Combat Ship, and made critical investments toward two additional attack submarines in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.  #FY19NDAA
Because of these tough choices and a commitment to be good stewards of the taxpayers‚Äô dollar, we were able to accelerate major Seapower and Projection Forces equities.  #FY19NDAA
To this end, our Seapower and Projection Forces mark sought and achieved a balance of current and future readiness. #FY19NDAA
As the former Readiness Subcommittee Chairman, I'm painfully aware that readiness is composed of two major components: current readiness and future readiness. Without an adequate balance between the two, we cannot hope to be successful in the future of armed conflict.  #FY19NDAA

@dougiefresh1218 @POTUS I've voted more than 40 times for repeal. This is the first time a repeal bill has passed both chambers of Congress.
Health care decisions belong in the hands of patients and providers, not in the hands of insurance companies and government bureaucrats.
I voted yesterday to repeal Obamacare and defund PP. @POTUS will veto,but this sets us up to offer quality health care alternatives.
(2/2) Using these kinds of atrocities as a basis for a power grab, as Dems have done over and over, is unconscionable and unconstitutional.
(1/2) We need to end these tragedies once and for all by addressing the underlying problems and limiting gun access for violent CRIMINALS.
Mass shootings are a problem, but fixing that problem means ending terrorism/addressing mental illness, not abridging constitutional rights

As 2015 kicks into gear, my goal in Washington is to make sure that the job gets done. #SOTU #GetTheJobDone
President did not mention the impending cuts to our military budget, known as the sequester, which will be absolutely devastating. #SOTU
Above all, we must strengthen the opportunity for the middle class to succeed. #SOTU
