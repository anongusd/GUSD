Him and Putin, what can you do?
@_waleedshahid McCain moment, where are you, this is everywhere and we still have problems
@Yamiche And again, where were those who supported @POTUS44 in 2016, did they forget the racist conspiracy, did they not trust a candidate 44 supported
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Are you on a show or are you the president?
@JosephNSanberg Rent that is higher than the affordable housing in the old neighborhood, keeping up with the Joneses and easy credit ruins savings plans and budgets
@realDonaldTrump Hard to lead when you are always calculating and faking
@WhiteHouse You are late on that ship
@GOP Thru the door, and why do Americans buy it, because they are hooked
@SecPompeo @MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria Really not sure about the propaganda there
@HuffPost And what does he say about Jews and Native Americans
@maggieNYT Whoa
@sirengarg @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump can you show me another picture of dicktators
@abigail62398375 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump wrong, but you didn't mention all of that Venezuelan oil coming to you soon
@Trumpett3 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump would you be nervous if your 17 year old daughter were invited for a one on one visit with @realDonaldTrump
@WhiteHouse blah blah blah, you know I speak English right
@AlliemalCNN well probably what happens when two folks get together to compare facts and they both forgot to leave Neverland at home
@HuffPost Quitters
@motokorich hate to see them try to get back on the train
@motokorich https://t.co/1wqJOxRfxt
@motokorich motorcycles would of been easier, they visited an entire factory of them
@motokorich no OSHA in Vietnam
@JBHouts @WhiteHouse @POTUS they didn't fail, they refused to give the photo op
@WhiteHouse what is the Chief of Staff really thinking right now
@jonkarl good results for Kim, he brought the Superpower to table in exchange for nothing, we have seen this game and we stopped playing with the last administration.
@GOPoversight are you still talking?
@nytimes Just like when @realDonaldTrump brought @BillClinton mistresses to a debate, that Congressman was just copying his leader
@ZekeJMiller no MOUs today, maybe next Summit "TAKE 3"
@mkraju @mattgaetz too little too late, you are fired
@StateDept @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo we are tired of the photo ops, tell him we will stop helping him torturing his people by lifting sanctions but Kim must give us an inventory and not produce anymore, very simple, done in 5 minutes
@marcorubio why are you butting in to another country, why don't you help fix Florida
@maggieNYT why don't Kim and @realDonaldTrump just get a room by themselves and start WW III, but them two being on the same team
@mateagold @maggieNYT whatever has been directed by @realDonaldTrump are the thoughts and actions of the current @POTUS
@KFaulders @maggieNYT reparations
@elianayjohnson @maggieNYT give me one example of good/great leadership ever displayed by Chairman Kim or @realDonaldTrump
@maggieNYT He should be fired
@carolelee @NBCNews why is any time need to be given, Kim is a dictator and knows exactly where all of his WMDs are just like the businessman @realDonaldTrump knows everything that is happening all the time just like MBS knows exactly what happen to #khashoggi
@GOP @Jim_Jordan this is how you don't interview an accomplice
@SenSanders is a criminal and has had to settle lawsuits to not face jail time
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews turn off, oh wait, never turned on
@GOPLeader Democrats asked questions and @realDonaldTrump is doing a second "TAKE" as if the first "Summit" did not even happen
@SenGillibrand well, there are rules to playing every game, but if your entire life is scripted or your actions are always reactions in spite, there are no rules or norms you will not break
@AOC it always baffles me when someone not-thinks that it takes a certain person to represent constituents, it is human nature and no matter our human experience, we all have the capacity to lead, to inquire, to fix problems and to lift up humanity
@realDonaldTrump that will not bring any economics to a dictator, regime change would be the only answer, or continued isolation
@LindseyGrahamSC why do you bring that up if you think it is so fake
@maggieNYT what, who, https://t.co/z4GHVT1F5n
@SecPompeo @coalition and we will leave when they ask us to
@Jim_Jordan told to do by his employer
@GOP why would any body do that, we are a capitalist country with freedom of press, Did Putin get hold of this feed
@tedcruz not what the vote was about
@realDonaldTrump well you already said we would be at war, sorry no, you need a real history lesson, why don't you call @BarackObama
@Jim_Jordan @BuzzFeedNews and what about @realDonaldTrump and his lies
@IvankaTrump hello, never going to happen, waste of time, and it does nothing for the people
@LindseyGrahamSC really, who did the deeds, the time is completely irrelevent
@GOPLeader @POTUS have you compared every one of those emergencies and their circumstances directly to this current one and what emergency can be delayed for 2 full years
@Yamiche people on one side just want to copy @realDonaldTrump remember the debate with all of @BillClinton mistresses now shall the Democratic candidate bring all of Trump's mistresses, afraid not, we go higher, not lower
@realDonaldTrump just can't let go of the past, did you bring up @HillaryClinton and her actions as SecyofState
@GOP Duh, but so does @realDonaldTrump
@SecPompeo more used car sales statements, who is writing this stuff for you
@Jim_Jordan why have you not been the leader to change the law, these people are seeking what we offer
@realDonaldTrump are u sleeping, do you want to win, time to go back to your Democratic ways

@llerer @nytimes no
@brianschatz @All100Senators guess the omelet bar will be open in the morning
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump do you need a song to inform you about what all the alphabets in the government are required to do
@HuffPost time to change the "by the BIBLE" circumstances that put the abusers in their positions of power, celibacy, confessions, preaching against sin on one day and committing it the other 6 is just a recipe for disaster that has been ignored for far too long
@danielmarans @HuffPost where does he get his money if all his supporters are in student loan debt
@PicoDeGallos @KamalaHarris @BerieSanders where does all that money come from
@RepDLamborn @POTUS just a distraction that @realDonaldTrump is a professional at spitting out
@BernieSanders you don't need any contributions, you need votes and something new on the how not the what
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump he doesn't listen to intelligence briefings and knows no history, why would you take one word out of his mouth as legitimate
@RepAdamSchiff again, if there is nothing to hide, why why why @realDonaldTrump
@Redpainter1 @mschlapp @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri exactly, because Rush can go three hours without a break, the media that tells us the truth need to stop being rug mats and start offending those who are lying

@KamalaHarris Health care to cope with the stress of losing a job, and now more health care is needed for the sudden loss of multiple lives and another layer of the sense of false security. Health care, Health care, Health care
@SenGillibrand Just not quite feeling a good vibe from you, your not being aggressive enough and I need to see some policy details not just policy slogan from @SenSanders
@GOP sorry, but @realDonaldTrump lies on the hour and you trust him every day
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump and World War I and except Japan WWII, it is so simple, why do you want to grab women by the Pussy just like @realDonaldTrump or maybe you have and we just haven't dug deep enough for an accusation
@GOP @realDonaldTrump All losses are losses, but drunk driving is what killed your daughter,
@VP are you sure, did you discuss ways to help them survive climate change
@IvankaTrump weird, are you part of the White House, or just another citizen that can post anything and cause some confusion
@GOP have you looked at the history of all your members, he was elected by the people of Virginia, let them decide
@chiro_fletcher no, just when I try to act like I'm 20
@VP @POTUS sounds like more shiny distractions, you would of think all the joking about it would of brought it some better publicity or at least a better name
@VP @POTUS and will this be another emergency to get funded?
@realDonaldTrump Quick, someone put this to #notanemergency music
@realDonaldTrump What do you suggest, follow you and laundry some money from Putin
@KamalaHarris Two teachers to every classroom, loan forgiveness to all who have taught full time for three years
@realDonaldTrump To becoming superpowerless
@realDonaldTrump Can't pass this up, @VP can't get you an applause on Allie soil
@realDonaldTrump Didn't think you could dig your grave deeper, you said we would be in a nuclear war, what stock market are you referring too, # of humans
@GOP can't read polls at elections, can't read polls about what the majority wants, can't count votes
@jmax7 @nytimes words of a former secretary of state that were glossed over because it was coming from a female candidate
@nytimes career professionals do not plan coups, they react on evidence, @LindseyGrahamSC has chosen his path to find a new job because he will not be reelected, plowing his path on conspiracy
@Jim_Jordan and who is currently serving time?

@mschlapp @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan freedom for those in power to take advantage of everyone else, living above the law just like @realDonaldTrump
@BillKristol yep magic, and Russian contact

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump it is called how it works, but if you weren't bad mouthing your first picks, this would not be an issue
@WhiteHouse @PressSec Stop, excuse me, do you know what stop means, the American people have told you to stop lying and start using your brain
@senatemajldr legalize weed now
@VP really, how do you plan to make any agreements if you just break them, what you can't handle a challenge
@SecPompeo @PolandMFA @USEmbassyWarsaw no new limits on weapons, there is no reason for war this day
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes there is no need for answers, they were professionals doing there job and not questioning the black and white process, unlike you who has been shaking the 8 ball and blurting out what ever outcome
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes are your writing stories for National Enquirer
@jonkarl @POTUS @realDonaldTrump could of replaced fences with a few porn star payments
@GOPLeader you are wrong, it is the policy that is creating the crisis, it is the lack of trust we have in @realDonaldTrump , why don't you take a leadership action and extend a branch to our neighbor Americas and find out what the problem is,
@VP @netanyahu @POTUS how are the walls over there
@GOP @SenRickScott you have know clue how to do it because you fear monger all things that look like socialism, but social programs are the only thing that will start solving the problems
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson the election has been won and is over, or did you forget, your #UnfitForOffice actions, primarily lying to the world you work for is the reason for talk of your removal.
@VP @POTUS no prayers today, what are you planning to prevent more death

@SecPompeo @POTUS @StateDept @realDonaldTrump just needs to stop grabbing them by the PUSSY
@Jim_Jordan way to create speculation
@VP @CBP meanwhile, the demand for all the things that cause real crisis in the country are being ignored because @realDonaldTrump has no idea how the majority lives

@PattyMurray @All100Senators Any legislation should focus on the reason why migrants are coming here and how if crossing illegally and not turning themselves in, how they can survive.  Solve the problem, this is just the beginning and it is not a crisis, wait until climate change gets a hold of the equator
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace many have said, other than the things @realDonaldTrump has supposedly misspoke about that would have any Democrat facing impeachment, the White House could be vacant and the country would be doing great
@NorahODonnell He is so blinded by something, I would say lack of intelligence on many things, who is telling him that economics happen overnight, that carnage and darkness that he spoke of at his inauguration can disappear in a day and a high stock market, #goldenbubble

@marcorubio use the disciplines agreed upon in the treaty with the support of the rest of the world, every time you cancel you make America weaker
@GOP spend the money you have and get more help at the ports of entry
@Yamiche Does any one smell Russian involvement here
@Jim_Jordan @MariaBartiromo stop the demand for the drugs
@GOP @DHSgov @OURrescue what is your solution for stopping the demand
@realDonaldTrump boy you are reaching deep in to your book of lies today, trying to throw out some distractions for every one to see
@marcorubio procreation is not a miralce
@realDonaldTrump you can not build a wall fast enough, you don't have the money, and a wall won't stop them, this is just the beginning and the facts show this is not a crisis	STOP LYING
@SecPompeo @jguaido but don't provide TPS to any of their neighbors, real smart
@GOP @realDonaldTrump the people are coming through the ports of entry, and who in America are buying these people, friends of @realDonaldTrump
@tedcruz quit allowing them to be indebted to equipment with easy loans and commodity killing tariffs.
@GOP spend the money allocated, hire more people to process those seeking American help and focus your diplomacy on the problem, you think this turmoil is bad, where do you think people will be going when climate change swallows the lands of the equator
@LindseyGrahamSC some one has taken over this guys Twitter feed, mini Trump from Russia, hope you have your retirement plans ready Mr.Graham
@senatemajldr @SenSasse another distraction that has no thought put in to the very detail of the situation, let alone a care about all the babies that are brought in to this world and how they must suffer because there is never any money to cover the numerous medical needs they may need to live
@Yamiche time to get out every yearbook from everywhere and analyze the past intentions of every single person for the last 40 years?  Does the world not see this as another Russian distraction.  Do you see the source, did he not just get elected and no one looked at these things
@realDonaldTrump are you sure, only the best people, but you have struck out multiple times, why don't you let the worker bees of the departments pick there own leaders
@GOP you drink a bunch of that fear Kool-Aid and loss of power is going to be the full result
@SecPompeo @jguaido recognize yes, but let the people decide who they want to lead, stay out unless you are wiling to allow those refugees to seek TPS here also
@IvankaTrump get out of the White House, no one takes you serious and you are not inspiring
@SecPompeo we don't need a history lesson from a salesman, we need to stop breaking agreements that we make along with the rest of the world, we are the leading superpower, not a take our ball and go home spoiled brat.
@Jim_Jordan don't come on here with no proof, physical proof, why are you waiting to change the law, the American dream has no limits but you could change the law and let the migrants know there will be a waiting line.  This is the beginning of a real crisis, climate change migration
@NPRinskeep @VP @PeteButtigieg just too early, you know the campaigns, some how break records year after year no matter what the economy is like, if these candidates want to fix something, take all these "millions out of the air" donations and fix important things that matter

@juliaioffe warm, it is a hot party after yesterday's statements from @realDonaldTrump

@Eugene_Robinson How did every process leading to be president qualify him America knew this guy with no legitimate successes. IF @realDonaldTrump represents America, we have a severely REAL crisis among Americans that very well could end the world #25thAmendmentNow
@jonibetrue @maggieNYT it is on TV with real people, but it is satisfying the mind of someone who acts like he is on the Truman show, and all the attention he gets, the president has to be given the spotlight every time he Tweets and speaks, reinforces the Truman show mentality
@marcorubio even when the will of God is said to be what ever benefits those in power
@maggieNYT was there a transcript of the intel meeting

@SSWorks @AOC look who financed the development of the internet, access should be free, our taxes supported the military who developed it
@SSWorks @AOC when a drug is needed in an emergency situation, cost is not a consideration, but when the bill comes if you live, insurance decides if you would have been better off dying.  Focus on changing the game, not the players
@SSWorks @AOC so some inside scoop, Big Pharma is the new big auto, middle class jobs, 55-100k, money not built by Unions, but by the need for some what skilled employees, the problem is the health insurance game deciding the losers and winners for drugs that are very dangerous
@SusanR59810334 @LinzDeFranco @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/OI06SAb7rn

@VP @POTUS @DEAHQ no need for more wall if you would lead the Senate to change the law
@GOP no the truth is they are breaking the work done in the past, bringing undocumented folks out of the shadows and start exposing the attractions of breaking the law to improve lives, following orders that are breaking the trust of American policies.
@senrobportman better yet, why have you not addressed the reason why there is a demand for this powerful drug

@mffisher public financed elections only, a chance for door to door meet and greets to make an impact, increased nominations of business owners or REAL people of the community, representation by neighbors, not gerrymandered dotted lines
@mffisher journalism is not at fault, the pace of technological advances in media and the acceptance of headlines as the only part of the story that we need because the rest of the story can be pieced together from multiple other sources in a flash makes the work of the full story popquiz
@mffisher before long they'll all be gone, the environmental impact will be the last factor but it will be a reason. Can a newspaper format transition to a book club/submission review, paid stories structure. One for every community, all digital, all local, letting only the best survive
@mffisher So where will we turn for the honest truth about who a politician really is?Do the platforms on the internet really think it can sustain some kind of market system with ads and clicks! What is worse is another pathway to real journalism is being lost
@NYDailyNews @AOC the truth is out there and if a company management thinks that wages are not a water cooler topic than the management needs to find a new reality, performance reviews are a joke

@VP @VickiMcKenna @POTUS maybe you should find some help
@VP @VickiMcKenna @POTUS do you really have faith or are you as fake as @realDonaldTrump has said in the past you are
@VP @VickiMcKenna @POTUS walls do not work, diplomacy and community involvement and safety works.  There is no house in America built with walls that is fully protected, our history of "Helping" in central America is not pretty, why don't you find out what is going on and than make a deal
@VP @VickiMcKenna @POTUS you banned Muslims, primarily refugees, do you not see the same "CRISIS" at the border to stop all asylum seekers, or can you not ban all brown Catholics from entering the country, the entire "WALL" has no standing, the ports of entry is what needs help
@VP @VickiMcKenna @POTUS use the money already allocated and quit playing crying "Wolf"! no wall is needed if you would have changed the law a year ago
@SecPompeo @jguaido your wrong and you are taking us back in time in an attempt to do what, Make America Great Again, let them figure it out for themselves, do not repeat actions that has created terrorists in the recent past, let the international and locals sort out the mess

@realDonaldTrump being how you don't trust any one in your administration, where do you get your facts from, have you never seen the govt. numbers on immigration in the past, a crisis for you is borrowing money, letting a woman(Ivana) do better than you, or  you not being in the spotlight

@VP @ICEgov @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @POTUS @WhiteHouse we are disagreeing with ICE tactics commanded by your policies, that are forcing all visitors and those waiting adjudication in to the shadows.  R are encouraging illegal seeking of work by not passing national requirement for E-verify, stop drug flow by passing preventive health

@maggieNYT As did the rest of America that cared and were not consumed by the Celebrity @realDonaldTrump wrestling moves
@EricLiptonNYT @chucktodd failure of our education system, laziness, and drive to keep our consumer driven economy going by immersing our selves in to the hypnotizing "NEW" technology instead of addressing the problems of our neighbors next door, across the border, and across the world.

RT @realDonaldTrump: So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see…
@HouseGOP money does not make the military stronger, ending a war and calling a victory does
@HouseGOP did you get a @realDonaldTrump stamp of approval for this slogan
@ChrisCuomo and of course, here we are, talking about it, if only we would all of ignored it on day one, can we get a focused story on White House TV or (Fox/ @seanhannity or the propaganda free for all CRTV
@realDonaldTrump it is called poll predictions, not accurate outcome, the results are not conclusive until the votes are counted, just like the investigation is not over until the investigator declares it over, stop acting guilty and show us some good negotiating
@SpeakerRyan there has been no call for improving the education system at the bottom which would require less military spending and more #twoteacherstoeveryclassroom
@SpeakerRyan the entire world economy is improving because of the slow but steady recovery brought to us by @POTUS44
@SenatorCantwell what are our options to demand faster action, how hard is it to reverse a policy action, it seems to be the same approach as is taken on forest fires.  Maybe the National @USNationalGuard needs to step in since they are not being used on the border for National security
@HouseGOP @RepLoudermilk what about 10 years ago, time to give real credit to @POTUS44
@AaronBlake being that @realDonaldTrump is racist to all shithole countries, of course he is going to use immigration for a scapegoat for all problems
@tedcruz @NancyPelosi Ted, it is a principle fight, not a judgement of character of the judge, and it is the potential guilt that the Supreme Court will have to judge when the investigation puts him on the stand
@PressSec @POTUS disgraceful and I hope you trip on the cobblestone on your way to see Putin
@SenSchumer Time to call on your colleagues to investigate the relationship between Fox news and the @WhiteHouse   the middle class is still relying on local radio and cheap entertainment has no other real news source and have no need to question the TV
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS maybe @realDonaldTrump should give the Queen the same respect as he gives Putin and have a one on one discussion
@realDonaldTrump what exactly does strong on Crime mean, the Border is complicated and does not have any context being used as one word, immigration is your baby, the second amendment means nothing to you and you have no idea what it means to serve
@maggieNYT How do we combat the out of control rhetoric from Infowars and 80% of Fox news who has convinced most of middle class America that @realDonaldTrump  's words are always truth
@senrobportman Please speak up to your colleagues and tell them to stop protecting the president at all costs, retirees do not get a free pass to corrode the foundations of our American institutions like they displayed in the testimonials in the House
@HouseGOP It does not happen overnight, but increased debt and accelerated climate denying does.  Nice try to change your campaign slogan but it is too little too late
@realDonaldTrump you are all over the map and your brain is empty, do you know where we get our energy from, do you know how trade works, your just mad you didn't broker an energy deal
@GOPLeader @NancyPelosi an economy does not change overnight and you do not speak for any one else, but debt does appear overnight and you have voted for that
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump time for you to retire, you are brainwashed to the conversation on which ever side you are on which ever day of the week you feel like
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump propaganda, why do you act presidential, you need to be a live Tweeter all the time so the world can see who you really are
@ChrisCuomo when will you and @VanJones68 address the dark roller coaster flying down the track that informs the majority of the middle class AKA 80% of Fox news.  It is disgustingly dark and there is no coming back for their spectators and zombies
@HouseGOP LIES LIES LIES , do you live in America?  does an economy change overnight?  do you know how science works?
@SenateMajLdr @Enquirer you set this precedent and now you are going to have to deal with it so eat your soup
@VP @POTUS hurry up and turn him in so you can take over

@SenatorCantwell which company should he tweet about, he didn't hold back against Pfizer

@LinzDeFranco why
@Inana139 @chrislhayes @PressSec many "representatives" have been forced to leave establishments, goes with the profile and can happen to anyone from anywhere at any time.  All it takes is for one influential and inspiring leader to say enough is enough and all of America would be willing to walk in solidarity
@VP @POTUS free of LGBTQ and abortions, @realDonaldTrump does not want to solve any problems for our neighbors, then he would lose his primary campaign platform.
@PressSec @POTUS and if you were LGBTQ they could of done the same thing too
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/IBQXf49eTS
@IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse you need to do more than that
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris TY @POTUS44
@SenRonJohnson Why don't we hold Wal-Mart accountable for brining all these cheap, one time use goods to millions of shoppers and go ahead and let China be the next superpower with their #OBOR initiative.
@WhiteHouse drunk driving and auto accidents, something you are not focused on but you think illegal immigration will change any statistics, how about you propose a law nationwide for no hands on cell phones in the drivers seat of a moving vehicle, zero tolerance, save some lives
@GOPLeader a great economy does not appear overnight but trillions more in debt can, keep trying to run on this fairy tale
@kurteichenwald why not make voting day a Federal Holiday and get @usedgov  and @USDOL to agree that it is an essential part of being an American
@GOPLeader @BarackObama @NancyPelosi @SenatorReid hope you don't plan to get reelected on those tid-bits, @realDonaldTrump always said those numbers were all false and your current numbers must be also
@GOPLeader no just @realDonaldTrump and your weak campaign support to be reelected, look at the stats of the last 6 years and tell your followers the real truth, both on the economy and the environment
@Family_Handyman here is an idea, lead on the environment and offer digital only
@SRuhle @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump She knows he does not ever read @POTUS messages, and why does she have to send a Tweet, because @realDonaldTrump told her that would look the best, hey @IvankaTrump have you seen any pictures of Syria or Yemen or Navajo reservation

@realDonaldTrump DOTARD, did you bring any NK nuclear footballs home with you?  Do you remember what the nuclear triad is and did you happen to ask Kim if he has one.

@realDonaldTrump economy is not a building that you can put your name on it because that would require you being part of building the foundation done by @POTUS44 so go ahead and tell your base this is yours but like your @PressSec said debt does not appear over night nor does a great economy
@olgaNYC1211 @MalcolmNance must be all about the strategy of @realDonaldTrump not letting my enemies or my allies or my people know what I am doing, so much transparency no wonder we will never see those taxes.

@Sulliview @ChrisCuomo some times @realDonaldTrump asks where you are and you are standing right next to him, so we all like to keep tabs on our supermodel @FLOTUS
@PaulRieckhoff @ChrisCuomo If only we had been involved sooner,
@davidaxelrod @ChrisCuomo @POTUS hope he has been watching some Nixon documentaries to see what he should do next
@jaketapper @ChrisCuomo That should get some debate clips to remind us all where we were
@ChrisCuomo seems like a silly that we have seen before and not worth a segment, many do not know the anthem or have forgotten the words and @realDonaldTrump has no allegiance to any thing but himself
@ChrisCuomo it is just a crux that is letting the tobacco industry off easy for the death sticks they have been industrially providing for over a century and could cause the extinction of this planet and it's inhabitants.
@ChrisCuomo No we have not all been disrespectful to people in front of other people, we all have had those thoughts but some have a balance of discipline taught to us by our influencers and leaders, the current leadership @WhiteHouse is an anything goes reality show
@ChrisCuomo Nationwide, I would even go worldwide, free preventive healthcare, the money is there, the science is there, the want to provide is there, what are we waiting on, all of the volcanos to erupt
@ChrisCuomo Like leader, like follower, when appointed all these actions were "I told you so's" Nothing like hiring one pest to get rid of another pest proclaimed by campaign promises.  Review the campaign to see what the next shiny object will be tweeted
@ChrisCuomo Dems need to put forth passionate action and take any repercussions as lumps with the territory.  Education, environment, sharing the wealth and transparency in international relations.  Right now the entire world does not know what to expect of our Twitter in Chiefs next move
@ChrisCuomo the wall is a non positive and a lie in itself that Mexico is not paying for
@ChrisCuomo technology will lead the way to independent Health care and pioneering home remedies that will completely skip all the middle men and leave them with no patients.  It would be wise for the gov. to offer a free preventive health plan to keep their foot in the door.
@ChrisCuomo China has set out on their own economic plan and they will succeed without the US.
@ChrisCuomo why is this tweet not available
@ChrisCuomo meanwhile the majority who do not have to ever pay attention to any of this will only wake up after it is too late.  The media executives are smart and can feel the depletion of the audiences, but they are going to ride this wave until the last drip.
@ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump is not capable of offering an olive branch if he does not benefit in the optics so a deal will have to be brokered where it looks like he will end up on top
@matthewjdowd @ChrisCuomo We are who we are and we are very unique and many want to be what we are and others in power hate who we are because they do not want to lose their power.
@aarondmiller2 @ChrisCuomo where is the facts that measure this, and if that were the case why are we still being challenged from the same entities, why should we need to negotiate anything if we are so feared.  We do not succeed by being a bully, in fact we have lost every-time, We win by leading
@yashar @ChrisCuomo lets define what relationship means to @realDonaldTrump  and then when can have a discussion
@pbump @ChrisCuomo Again, is economics that complicated, is science not being taught in the schools, do we wipe away all the progress that is made when a new administration takes over.   @POTUS recognizes his father for his own success, why can't he recognize the administration before him
@ChrisCuomo Chris, you missed two opportunities, the debt isn't created overnight and neither is a good economy,  push those guests to the brink, to acknowledge the progress that was being made before they were put in their positions.
@chucktodd I guess the head of Congress or the Judicial branch will have to hold @POTUS accountable, but the American people will March in the Street in protest to remind @realDonaldTrump he works for us
@realDonaldTrump quit talking about it, can you not resist Don the temptation, there are thousands of investigations in to your past and you are not tweeting about them.
@tedcruz but it is ok to regulate what to do with your body, a business has a choice to serve, this has already been established just as an employer has full power to hire or fire for what ever reason.
@VP @POTUS https://t.co/2EOG4NWboS
Anyone think these tariffs are for Putin's benefits, ask @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@TroopCandiceKHP @kshighwaypatrol @SportingKC @cmpark is it mandatory state wide? just looking out for my troopers who are keeping us safe and do not want to see another get hurt because a motorist could not see and did not change lanes.
@scottlincicome It is time to stop this attack and get immigration process stream lined so that the dying towns can be revived.
@Rasmussen_Poll @MonicaCrowley This is the calm before the storm of massive automation.
@TroopCandiceKHP @kshighwaypatrol @SportingKC @cmpark Wear a safety green vest when out of your vehicle
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube Oh but wait a job is a job according to @POTUS and unemployment is at a all time low, the calm before the storm of all things being automated.
@sahilkapur @maggieNYT Does anybody really want this job?
@realDonaldTrump  @POTUS What are you hiding, where is the truth, no tax returns, no apologies, is your #goldenbubble  so thick that you are not an American,, Don are you an American?
@vtg2 Do they teach trade at Wharton, I would like to see a grade report of our #goldenbubble @POTUS , seems like again the only education he knows is what was on TV last night, maybe he should watch some @ThisWeekTonight or @TheCrashCourse
@aidnmclaughlin He should probably leave his glasses on and get a teleprompter.
The #goldenbubble Donnie lives in has put a spell on just enough people to prevent massive weekday marching in the streets.  What will put America over the line to shut this place down https://t.co/JeHLb0jkV4
@LinzDeFranco Love that age, best friend until those teenager/puberty years
@IvankaTrump Will you ever acknowledge the data or just keep thinking it was all your daddies doing, WAKEUP
@senrobportman why don't you pass state wide free preventive health so doctors would have more time to address their patients.
@SenatorCantwell Everything he promised in the campaign is going to be fulfilled or at least attempted, that is the playbook, we don't have to be distracted by all the other nonsense #Resistance
@realDonaldTrump Were you at the debate, it was one of the topics discussed
@HouseGOP how about paying off some debt or cleaning up the environment
@VP did not even make a dent down there did you bubbles
@SenatorCantwell switch to electric
@SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader It is called free preventive health care for all, but you can't figure that out so you blame it on the system that you didn't want to help fix and couldn't figure out a replacement despite 6 years of trying, just go home now
@SpeakerRyan Too little to late because you didn't fund anything, it doesn't matter how much money you throw at the troops, their inadequate K-12 education and now no leader at the helm will continue to record accidents and failures, unacceptable for the superpower
@SenatorCantwell why would @realDonaldTrump do that, the economy is booming and high gas prices is a direct result. @POTUS is just fulfilling back channel promises and trying to start another war in the Middle East
because you keep cutting funding and can't figure out how to fix the entire system, granting them access to the long lines and overbooked private care is going to cause more overdosing and PTSD, thanks for nothing again https://t.co/6Wz7I1M6gZ
@realDonaldTrump bullshit mr #goldenbubble you have no idea and are not helping the situation.
alternative facts
@SenRonJohnson @POTUS @VP It is a path down the wrong hole that is going to create massive amounts of litigation and broken promises, why don't you legalize the natural medicine first.
somebody tell that to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS so much for getting tired of winning https://t.co/ccXGkhrIzv
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Learning sessions/town halls during every break in every district to break the bubble of misinformation given by the #goldenbubble @POTUS
@VP @NFL @POTUS Hey false fan, you haven't seen nothing yet, until you fix the problem of overpowered and unleashed racist police forces, there will be protests.
@SonnyBunch too bad you don't have the time to just go make that shit at home.  Have you checked their environmental record?
@GOPLeader @POTUS if you are going to keep depleting  the right to choose and having government get bigger by getting in to women's health, maybe you should give out birth control for free and develop a modern standard across the nation for sexual education that is not based on religious fears.
@senrobportman @POTUS so now they can wait in lines and pay higher prices like the rest of us because you can't figure out how to fix healthcare
@PressSec Helloooo kindergarten teacher, as if any one didn't ever support firefighters, do you have any real thoughts??
@VP @POTUS You do not have to use Trump after POTUS, you rookie tweeter, and you have no clue what the situation is in the gang world..  stick to being a scared moommas boy with no leadership skills
@HouseGOP Bullshit, you have failed the military for the last 15 years, forcing them to track terrorist and instead creating terrorist 10 times over.  Use our leadership status to improve the world and support the UN in ending all arm conflict.
@tedcruz @TheSlyStallone Are you in on that pardon now too
@LinzDeFranco how would it be if we were not and is it any different than prayer at the dinner table, or opening a door for a lady or saying bless you after a sneeze

@kasie Macron is the @POTUS whisperer
@SenSanders been there, done that, it is temporary or you move up to management, automation and healthier eating will wipe these jobs out, they are not careers so stop blaming others for a failed education system and cheap easy fattening food, invest in teachers and solar power, real jobs
@HouseGOP no one is getting this message on Twitter, you all might want to find something better to talk about other than a law that has already passed
@Acosta @PressSec In a few months @POTUS will say he has never met the guy and his new lawyer will pay him more money to keep his health secrets safe
@FLOTUS had to find some way to attract attention to her self in the middle of this @POTUS bromance, guaranteed Putin and @IvankaTrump are a little jealous too https://t.co/oDRWnSdYeg
@michaelkruse that is why that A Jones and S Hannity have so many followers and if our education system had not been failing for the last 10 years, maybe a generation would understand the concept of why things are so cheap and globalism is the end game
@NBCNews i'll have to get back to you on that or that has already been addressed number 1 and 2 responses by kindergarten teacher in chief.  only if accessible means a sidewalk ramp with potholes all over the street
@AynRandPaulRyan @JuddLegum kindergarten teacher wins again because she is at the podium
@aedwardslevy @KatyTurNBC it is the oldest generation that this development pertains too, the rest of America has cut the cord, yet @POTUS always brings up ratings that do not reflect any truth, we could probably put polls in the same category, wrong but still used as leverage
@jeffzeleny @realDonaldTrump @jeffmason1 In @POTUS dreams
@DHSgov because there is still opportunity for them here despite the low unemployment, E-verify for all employment NOW
@SenFeinstein @All100Senators free preventive health for all
@SenGillibrand Support solar panels as the new American household appliance in the same way roads and schools were supported in the past, cut our bills and put us to work
@jeffzeleny @realDonaldTrump @POTUS should of done some more one on one time with him so he could really get to know he would not have any issues

Maybe it is time to be more transparent every where, all across the world, including govt's and corp.
@NegarMortazavi and @POTUS equates us to the thugs of Putin, how does the rest of the world feel about our bombs on civilians
@jmartNYT A gun has value but it is not worth the exchange for teaching me how to fish, move on to the real problems and enforce the laws that are on the books.
@NegarMortazavi 0 year deterrence or 10 years, that is the truth of the current deal and what does Russia benefit if we drop out

@VP @POTUS magic spells for all of the people you've treated unfairly in your past,be a leader and step up where @POTUS has not and never will.  You are not going to be able to run away like retiring Congress, you are going to have to fill some very small gloves and large clown shoes
@cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump at least #BlackLivesMatter has not been in the spotlight, maybe because of the truth coming out of Baltimore is the same all across the country the FBI is the replacement scapegoat.
@SpeakerRyan and we can't paint a bigger target on their backs like @POTUS did in his #SOTU , to bad our debt will be so high because of #TaxScam we will not be able to take care of our troops, maybe we should just bring them all home
@POTUS have you had enough hints to get to work on real problems like drug abuse, train infrastructure, military review , and preventive health care to reduce the chances of terrorism and gun violence, this is not a game and this is not your business, #Getowork
@SpeakerRyan The Republican sequester did not help, but the years of endless, unwinnable war has brought down morale and leadership confidence, solve problems, don't ignore them
@MarkWarner @NancyPelosi @WhipHoyer @RepJerryNadler @SenSchumer @SenatorDurbin @SenFeinstein @PattyMurray @RepAdamSchiff @repjoecrowley So what is the temperature of the non-wonks of America and how are they going to react because this issue is not in the top ten
@TomPerez and the tax on those bonuses did not change and there is no loophole to reap the full benefit.
@Tech4Campaigns @MichaelDTubbs @mikeyk what is reality and who is the judge of reality, the ease of entertainment access has granted an open door for all things to become blurred for entertainment purpose and blocking out real changes that need leadership to be solved but those capable are trapped because of $$$$

@clairecmc @All100Senators i'm sure their tax returns will show them and it will be an example of the tax reform that should of happened, why is extra work and extra pay taxed at a higher rate #35hourworkweek
@Millicentsomer so who should be the messenger in encouraging an equal approach, how do we educate humans on this when the world they all seem to idolize completely ignores the facts and labels those facts as sins and taboo.  Can equality become reality?
@SenatorBaldwin guess what, it is called free preventive health care
@davidaxelrod @MarkWarner @POTUS @realDonaldTrump who is the greatest influence in fighting this investigation and the tax returns are probably the real answer #ReleaseTheTaxReturns
@SpeakerRyan no shit sherlock, a tax cut is going to increase wages, that is not the concern of the unpopularity of the law which is already passed and you are still trying to sell, long term is the concern

@chucktodd again, this is completely @POTUS fault for trying to fulfill all campaign promises and not leaving DACA be until real immigration reform could be addressed, budget should have been a priority before health care and before tax cuts but Reconciliation would of not been available

@SenateMajLdr @All100Senators what is wrong with DACA by itself, immigration numbers are entirely down, make e-verify the law of the land and raise the fine for getting caught, the fence already has a budget and is in decent shape, invest in Mexico, bring troops home, lead by example @POTUS
@POTUS how about trying to be a good neighbor and invest in Mexico to make it better since we are already so great
@POTUS have you drove along the border recently, it is in pretty good shape, and the desire for drugs comes from citizens here in this country

@SenatorCardin @SenSchumer this is already widely known for those that care, what you need to do is turn this ship around and push the rest of the world to put down their squabbles from the past and look at what will effect us all in the immediate future, stop letting humans die at the hands of others
@SenatorTester @All100Senators government is the last thing you should be worried about watching us, it already tracks our lives everyday, the world is going to move on with out us if this is the best you can do
@SenatorFischer @1011_News @Nelnet no proof, bonuses taxed, schools falling apart and growth on credit does not benefit anybody but the rich
@ClintSmithIII despite all of the years of cover up and abuse.  And the home to the likes of brash progressive cartoons and live police videos and the NFL, but when it is the only station that will come in on the old antenna and the only news update available on the radio dial, equals brainwash

@SenateMajLdr @All100Senators you can't count what they were already getting and the fact it will be taxed at a high rate seems to slip your mind let alone your #goldenbubble lifestyle thinks$1000 helps anywhere in anyone's budget is complete fiction
@VP @marthamaccallum @FoxNews like all that tough #goldenbubble talk from @POTUS but now North Korea in the Olympics, because athletic competition solves so many problems
@SenThomTillis @POTUS tax cut for rich	killing the environment	filling a stolen appointment	prevented legislation to do this 5 years ago and did not do enough, and where are the jobs? @POTUS lowered our status as a world leader
@SenDeanHeller @ATT #goldenbubble reality check, this does not help anyone and it is taxed at the highest rate
@ChrisMurphyCT @POTUS is #MAGA by putting minorities in their place, in poverty, and dimming our beacon of leadership in the world, may we HOPE our institutions can sustain and prevent a freefall and the number of Republicans retiring sends a signal that #TaxScam will be the only accomplishment
@SenJohnMcCain and reconciliation should be put in the same category, suspending rules to fulfill campaign promises is not moving forward, nor is downplaying progress as a candidate and then taking credit for it once elected #goldenbubble @POTUS

@GOPSenFinance @RepKevinYoder why is this not nationwide news, for just as few sites reporting this, there are double who are closing their doors or laying off.  The economy is in a trend that Republicans keep denying.
@RepKevinYoder used your tax calculator and the cut does not assist my household budget, when will the govt become responsible money managers and be leaders, not ass kissers to those with heavy pockets
@RepKevinYoder fix the problems, forget the lobbyists
@RepKevinYoder Please tell @POTUS of these stories so he will stop defacing what we stand for
@USPS to bad they couldn't move the busiest shipping time of the year to a nicer weather season

@WhiteHouse @POTUS be sure to ask her about fake news
@ChrisCoons his playbook published in his book, fake carrot unbelievably low, snatch it away or give it away because it is fake anyways and change his mind, @POTUS is the first fake  Celebrity President, our institutions are our only HOPE, as long as we don't slide in the world view to far
@SenWarren @MarkWarner @Equifax The entire credit rating system needs to be reformed, it keeps getting the country in deeper debt and it follows the example of the US govt spending money they do not have.  Easy credit should be cancelled, new technology #blockchain can secure and manage a better credit system
@JohnCornyn @All100Senators @dcexaminer courts need to step in again on the immigration programs ordered to be cancelled and uphold the constitution.

@VP @POTUS so glad you are such a great Cherry picker
@SenatorTimScott they are only getting bonuses because corporations are already filthy rich, no tax reform has affected anything yet, this short term gain is creating a long term hole and it is really hard to see an improvement when everything was already headed in the up direction,
@senrobportman yea, investing in those stocks that are going to hit a drastic bubble and risking their golden years on a broke government.
@PressSec just like trump casinos and trump university, bankruptcy and lawsuits, bad business and IOUs ,,This is America's economy and these gains are results of drastic negotiations after the great recession, but another bubble is building and if Trump can not see it we are all LOSERS

@KatyTurNBC Every time we expect details about answers that we don't have and she is never prepared to give answers to things we don't know, what is her job, tweet translater, figuratively, not literally, time for her to go

@damartin32 @AdamHasty @realDonaldTrump @NFL Wrong, it's called a Union that needs to be revived to all industries
@realDonaldTrump So glad this is not from @POTUS maybe you should resign from your job because of your sexual misconduct on the apprentice
And Russians and Republicans want to add a failed USA to that list but America is not a Trump family business, we are leaders and we will not be distracted by a petty bully living in a #goldenbubble https://t.co/NCp3Uje86q

@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Did you not study economics, you know the truth,
@SenCapito The most profit in years and full benefit of infrastructure, corporations take the most advantage they should be repairing it
@DeanHeller Oh you forgot pro billionaire and pro corporation
@senrobportman Savings and a tax return the following year are not related
@SenCapito @taxfoundation Where is the science to support this hope
@SpeakerRyan Steve and Melinda, what a great choice
@jaketapper @MooreSenate Equal for male and female
@jaketapper @MooreSenate I would say some teachers might be in that category but if all affairs we're to be made public and turn out bad, it is equal to make and female, but then look at the church for some one sided statistics
@MrASTM @WhiteHouse Two unnecessary wars and subsidized oil
@WhiteHouse And this is why you think taxes are a problem?
@PressSec U mean the 5000 more retail stores that are going to close
@WhiteHouse make up your mind, I don't get a pay raise and I still pay taxes, maybe you should invest in new jobs
@SpeakerRyan does 500k sound like a capable middle class claim
What limiting foreign trade would mean for the U.S. economy https://t.co/ajEhRjBGjX via @YouTube  Another learning lesson for you @POTUS

@PressSec @POTUS so glad athletes can break the law in a foreign country and get away with it, how did they make it to college, oh yea, they are athletes
@RSBNDC do you recognize @POTUS posts equal to @realDonaldTrump
@RSBNetwork why is a tax reform bill considered a need being how well the economy is doing?
@RSBNetwork The repeal and replace passed and then failed also
@RSBNModerator do you think all this is from #METOO
@SenatorCarper And we can go further if we look at all the unused inventory that we have consumed but do not use, but have reaped the benefits in the category of jobs created, now that we are headed toward a downturn in consumption, we must focus on the second and third use of goods and waste
@SenatorCarper superpowers are suppose to lead, innovate, and spread our knowledge to the rest of the world so that they can also benefit, the more we share, the better benefit for all humans
@VP @POTUS @TexasTribune As more retail stores close and the stock market gets further from reality because it is reflective of global investment, not actual demand of American consumers.  Bring on improving what we have and putting America's inventory to good useto help the rest of the world advance.

@nytdavidbrooks And the fact that they never lose their value.
@nytdavidbrooks Flirting, Hollywood depictions of Flirting and puberty, the still unaddressed issue of parents being parents in all aspects of them raising their children and being able to teach their children their own experiences before they are exposed to the fantasy approach.
@nytdavidbrooks Because his public actions have had the spotlight and everything else was not important and undisclosed, Trumpism
@SenJeffMerkley It takes a nationwide safety awareness campaign to bring funds to fix working conditions, a tax cut will not increase pay, it will be spent on past debt and go to banks, shareholders and technology
@brianschatz Cold hard cash to cold to handle for everyone except a Wall Street Super Villian	"@stevenmnuchin1  Hurry, put it away, mighty mouse from the middle class is on his way to cut cut cut that cash in to student loan relief." whispers the watchman from the back.
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics is this equal to the money payed out to a soldiers family, can every American get a free pass if they commit a crime in a foreign country.
@RepPeteOlson @SpeakerRyan and millions of CPAs will be out of work
@BuzzFeedNews they have stemware, thanks for adding to the plastic island, https://t.co/9Zk7FbD3jw
@RepChuck the delay of pay increase was because of R obstruction and sequester, don't be patting yourself on the back now
@SpeakerRyan way to buy in to @POTUS campaign promises, jobs go where the cheap labor is and up and coming demand will be, how about you write some legislation to encourage new industry, paying more teachers, lower costs of education, increase costs on trash waste and increase rate of saving
@SenatorCantwell got to get something done so that there is something to show for campaigning in 2018
@DWStweets let alone the millions that will leave coverage, especially in the work place, which will lower the pools and increase premiums and decrease the health quality of all Americans, lets just go for a world health coverage system while we are at it.
