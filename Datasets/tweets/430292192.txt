@AGOWA Bob Ferguson on 9th Circuit win: ‚ÄúNo one is above the law, not even the President.‚Äú Tells Trump to withdraw his immigration order
The 9th Circuit's ruling is a clear and sweeping victory for the states; Trump's DOJ did not prevail on a single issue.
The 9th Circuit panel's decision states courts also can review national security matters that bump up against Constitutional rights.
Trump claim that courts can't review his immigration order "runs contrary to our constitutional democracy" the appeals judges wrote.
Fixing: 9th Circuit panel has unanimously sided with Washington and Minnesota and upheld stay of Trump's immigration order.

Hearing is over. The 3-judge panel  says it will rule in next few days. Very aggressive questioning of DOJ about impacts and intent of ban.
Trump's lawyer don't deny the president has said he wants to ban all Muslims, but wonders whether they are evidence. Says no ban exists.
Trump's lawyer in rebuttal points out the 7 nations involved had been identified as threats by Congress and Obama administration.
Judge Clifton points out that previous administrations have barred people from specific countries. It's 'common' in foreign affairs he says.
Judge Richard Clifton from Hawaii has honed in on whether WA can actually show Trump's order intentionally discriminates against Muslims.
Appeals judges are less aggressive in questioning @AGOWA attorney than DOJ lawyer, who was interrupted &amp; battered with questions.
Washington argues more harm done by Trump's immigration order itself than by the restraining order that halted it and returned status quo.
Washington Solicitor General Noah Purcell says the Trump Administration appealed the TRO too quickly and urges case be returned to Seattle.
