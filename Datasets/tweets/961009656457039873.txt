@Garrett_Watts Happy Birthday! I love your laugh and smile and love how loving you are no matter what happens to you. From broken wands to a broken heart, you know how to stay positive. You won't be lonely forever. Remain strong and diligent. Someone's out there seeing you smile.
Life is pretty crazy at times for me. I mean, adhering to society is fun and all. I just wish that society would adhere to me. I can't help the way that I look, or the way that I act at times. We're all still adolescents at heart. Bows make everything better. Stay strong. ‚úåÔ∏è. https://t.co/9wCCIVfQ3x
SnapChat and Instagram are always messing up at times. I wouldn't trade it for anything, though. I connect with the fam through there. And I love that. I can't wait to get to Cali. I hear it's nice and spacious.
What I've learned of life is this: no matter how hard things may seem or how difficult people of any background may be, we're all the same and want the same things. Never forget that you're loved, admired, adored, and appreciated. I love you. Spread love. It's contagious. ‚ù§Ô∏è.

@gabrielzamora Shis, take this advice. Look. You're a beautiful girl. Not too many men in L.A are ready for the love you want to give them because they're scared of your confidence.
