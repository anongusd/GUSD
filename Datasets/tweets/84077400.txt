“This is not the end of this process for all those affected by this bankruptcy. This is just another marker on the path of our fight for justice at Oak Grove &amp; Pinnacle. We will prevail in the end because we will never give up our fight.” - @CecilRoberts 	https://t.co/QVwIimNjjP
"We have negotiated a tentative collective bargaining agreement with the buyer of the Kemmerer and Beulah mines. However, we have not reached final agreement with the seller of those mines on funding for retiree health care going forward." -@CecilRoberts 	https://t.co/a4IcthFBKg
Westmoreland Coal miners worked a lifetime for a secure retirement.	Now, because of bad bankruptcy laws, that are stacked against workers, their future is at risk. Congress MUST ACT NOW to preserve the retirement these miners earned. #TheyEarnedIt	https://t.co/vIjgELVZAL

@LindaMasonJar @Sen_JoeManchin Yet I notice that you've changed the subject now that it's clear you don't know the facts about the 1974 Pension Fund.
@LindaMasonJar Sorry, I don't live on Twitter. Have a real life. Nor do I wait breathlessly for your next insult.
@LindaMasonJar @Sen_JoeManchin Not UMWA leaders, especially compared to coal company execs. That is a fact. And the salaries of any union personnel have nothing to do with the funding of the 1974 Pension plan. Two separate and distinct entities. That is also a fact.
@LindaMasonJar @Sen_JoeManchin The Wall Street swindlers caused this problem. Give us one example of any action by the union that caused this problem. The union doesn't even control the pension fund. Learn the facts before you make yourself look ignorant.

@bobmichaels77 @Bob_Casey @PADems Just so it's clear, the collapse in funding for the UMWA pension fund happened in the 2008 recession caused by Wall Street greed.

@grandmapete which benefits?
@NicoleKowalski5 @The_War_TARDIS @NavyChickMD Joe Manchin is the best Democrat we can ever get elected in WV and a strong voice for miners.
@WH_SeanSpicier Yes, the GOP bill leaves those provisions intact.
@Tam_Resist @eagle1776n I am not defending it either. It's bad. Just doesn't eliminate black lung protections.
@eagle1776n When this all shakes out and BL provisions are still in the law somehow I don't think you'll admit error.
@eagle1776n why do you think Freedom Caucus is going nuts? They will tell you GOP bill is not complete repeal.
@eagle1776n why won't you talk offline? Afraid to learn the truth and admit how wrong you are?
@wtstephens @eagle1776n the GOP language does not strike any of this. Plenty of bad things in the GOP language. This isn't one of them.
@wtstephens @eagle1776n Yes. And they are not amended by the Republican language. They remain part of the law.
@eagle1776n Let's talk in more than 140 characters. PM me for contact info.
@eagle1776n Dude, let's talk in more than 140 characters. PM me for contact info.
@cmdmgd78 Don't know. Lots to be worried about with ACA changes, but not black lung benefits. Need to focus on the real, not the unreal.

@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You @DavidCornDC So now you believe everything Trump says?
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You Another out of date story that doesn't reflect what was actually filed.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You @DavidCornDC Learn to read legislation then we can talk.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You Again, they are not repealing all of ACA. Just those parts mentioned in the bill.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You Don't have to prove anything to you.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You Black Lung victims who want the truth welcome to call our offices instead of relying on crazy tweets
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You That's how legislative language is written.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You No page number to mention because it is not changing anything. Bill only includes what it is changing
@Equality4You @eagle1776n @dylanlovan doesn't change any level of black lung benefits. Period.
@Equality4You @eagle1776n @dylanlovan We don't like changes to ACA either, but let's worry about what it does do instead of what doesn't do
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You All those resolutions were written before new bill was filed. No need for them now since no changes
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan New bill only mentions things it is changing. If no mention, no change. That's why it's silent on BL benefits.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You We are sure there are no changes to existing benefits or eligibility rules.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan @Equality4You You are just wrong, misleading your followers &amp; needlessly scaring the hell out of BL victims.
It does not change black lung benefits. New bill only mentions existing sections of law if it amends them. Not amending black lung section.

@eagle1776n @dylanlovan circular argument.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan another old story. Understand that the full ACA is not being repealed. The current BL language IS NOT TOUCHED.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan No, it does not. Those extra benefits remain.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan old story. Not relevant any longer.
@eagle1776n @dylanlovan No one cares more about black lung benefits than we do. They have not been touched by the AHCA.

@whereisjoemerch needs to learn more about unions. #UMWA an industrial union, not pub. emp. union. In a union mine, all are in the union.
Once again @whereisjoemerch has facts wrong. 60 layoffs at Wells are nonunion. 15 at Corridor G are, but 1st WARN was for 397 people.
@whereisjoemerch doesn't care about miners and retirees. Only his agenda matters. Won't take time to learn, just passes ignorant judgement.

The 1st federal Coal Mine Health and Safety law took effect 42 years ago today.  Thousands of miners saved from injury and death since.
@JoeBenge MineWorkers still vote in secret ballot elections. Only one case where elec. was questioned, in 1969. Get your facts right.
And the Stanford study shows that safety gap is growing between union and nonnunion mines.
Btw, independent statistical studies -- including one done by a member of the NIOSH review panel - show union mines are safer than nonunion.
Roberts: world of difference in inspections at union mines vs nonunion mines. There is another set of eyes.
Roberts: miners in southern WV didn't believe anyone had more power than Don Blankenship.
Roberts: need to go up corporate ladder to get to people who give orders to foreman to do unsafe things.
Kohler backs off of NIOSH panel recommendation to review need for quarterly inspections.
Kohler from NIOSH has real time explosibility meter to test rock dust compliance with him. Let's get them in every mine.
Roberts: Congress must also give families a right to participate in incident investigations. They have the most at stake.
Pres. Roberts: give miners right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions, criminally prosecute management if they force them to.
Rahall: families of miners are sick of watching corporate execs get away with UBB's.
Main points out that training plan required at UBB back in 1995 was never implemented and MSHA never asked for it, then or later.
Andrews: we all lat the miners at UBB down.
@Kenwardjr and that's below the belt.
Saw it at JWR No. 5 in 2001 and at UBB.
Roby. Another good question about two sets of books and how we keep that from happening in the future?
Main: MSHA changing the way it does business.
Roby: points out fatalities over each of the last 5 weekends. Why aren't inspectors working as much on weekends?
@Kenwardjr good question.
Woolsey is asking a question, I think, about constraints on prosecution of corporate execs who are responsible for company policies.
But question remains as to why experienced Dist. 4 management let UBB operate the way it did?
Main: experience of inspectors was an issue at the time of UBB.
Question: accumulation of coal dust was clear: how can MSHA miss that? Good question.
Main: no question MSHA could have done better at UBB.
Miller: Gary May testimony confirms advance notice enabled Massey to avoid citations.
@Kenwardjr As @Kenwardjr jumps in to goad on the GOP. Only asking where NIOSH report discredits issue of advance notice.
Kline: Massey "officially" one of the bad guys.
@Kenwardjr Where does NIOSH report discredit admitted illegal activity of giving advance notice of inspections?
Main: internal review found deficiencies at MSHA Dist. 4
Main: unlawful practices at Massey caused disaster at UBB, including advance notice of inspectors coming into mine.
Main: MSHA believes new legislation still needed to protect miners.
Woolsey: MSHA citations at UBB didn't stop company from violating the law. Entire system failed miners at UBB.
Kline:  MSHA didn't do it's job either.
At House UBB mine safety hearing. Chairman Kline: Massey clearly put production over safety.

Power gone. Keep the faith!
DB blaming MSHA again.
@jsayler Sorry, no blog. I've got too much else to do to keep a blog. Maybe if another 8 hours gets added to the day.
Byrd: I helped write mine safety laws. Responsibility to comply with them is yours.
Db's statement that Massey is "about average" is based on fatalities per millions of tons mined.  Not a real way to look at it.
CER: we have evidence Massey is being "borderline fraudulent" with respect to reporting lost time accidents.
CER: this is the 2nd disaster in 4 years at Massey mines. Not many companies want to copy that record.
Harkin: I've been around long enough to know you can put whatever you want on paper and it doesn't mean anything	in practice.
Aracoma disaster another example of Massey not putting safety first.
Blankenship: that's true. Trying to say it was about safety after all. More bs.
Blankenship: that's true.
Harkin asking DB about "run coal" memo.
CER: make it a criminal violation for any management person who interferes with miners right to withdraw from unsafe conditions.
Battery dying, but I'll tweet till I drop.
CER takes down Blankenships statistics on safety.
Byrd: 10 safety violations every day at Massey mines. A clear record of	blatant disregard for Massey miners. Shame!
Byrd: 29 miners are now dead simply because they went to work at your mine. Also concerned that safety vIolations at Massey are not new.
Byrd: Mr. Blankenship, do I have your attention?
CER: how are we going to protect every coal miner at Massey? Why didn't Blankenship shut this mine down? He had the authority.
CER: 23 other coal miners died in Massey mines in last 10 years. Massey had worst safety record in industry before UBB.
CER: thanks to Byrd for standing up for miners.
Roberts (CER) to start now.
He's giving testimony already refuted by Main, including ventilation plan.
Ah, what the heck - he's following his written testimony, which truly is bs.
Sorry, but i won't tweet Blankenship's statement. Don't see any reason to spread his bs.
2nd panel up. Photographers aflutter. Quick silent protest.
2nd panel up.
Saving my thumbs for the 2nd panel. Murray asking Main about Blankenship's trying to pin blame on MSHA.
Byrd: sounds like Massey is trying to blame MSHA for UBB tragedy. Main: MSHA does not run mines. Didn't run UBB.
Byrd: what remedies exist to	deal with rogue companies with safety issues with reputation for flouting the law? Smith: penal system.
Should have attributed 2 quotes ago to Byrd.
Byrd: let us all hope this hearing will provide information on company and government officials who should be held accountable.
Main: perhaps investigations will provide some solace to families who want accountability.
Byrd: where in earth was the effort to improve safety and health at UBB?
Byrd: Main and MSHA still have much to explain re: UBB. Happened on their watch. Massey Energy officials bear ultimate responsibility.
Safety laws jeopardized when miners themselves are not part of safety process.
Byrd: I am perplexed as to how such a tragedy on such a scale can happen given increases in funding and manpower to MSHA.
Back in session. Sen. Byrd is here. Harkin: no one has done more	for miners than Byrd. Roberts: amen.
Harkin recessing committee. 10-15 min. break.
Harkin recessing committe.
Main going after UBB and safety there.
Main: need mining industry to take ownership of safety in mines.
Harkin: under current system every violation contested by operators. Why are we getting more citations?
Smith agrees with UMWA that operators should have to pay fines into escrow before contesting them. If they're not guilty, they get it back.
Smith: to fix violation backlog, we need new tools. Subpoena power in routine investigations is one.
DoL's Smith: "if MSHA can find mine safety violations, operators can too."
Committe wil recess at 2:30. Financial reform cloture vote.
Harkin only Senator here. "Not here to talk about investigation"
Blankenship unwittingly posed with an environmental protester holding a	sign saying Massey profits B4 safety.
