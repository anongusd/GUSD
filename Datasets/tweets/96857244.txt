Buford says McDaniel's guilty plea was based off computer evidence that revealed McDaniel possessed child pornography, as well as his detailed, and graphic confession about decapitating Giddings.
McDaniel's former attorney, Floyd Buford says he thought McDaniel was innocent up until the last few weeks of the case.
