Yesterday the President forced a shutdown all to pander to the most extreme wing of his base for a wall that won‚Äôt keep our nation any safer. This is a disgrace. The President must come back to the table and reach a solution the majority of both chambers can agree on.
Last week, the President said he would be proud to shut down the government. No public servant should ever take pride in harming the economy or shirking their duty to solve our nation‚Äôs most pressing problems.

Today, he and the rest of the Republicans on the House Committee on Ways and Means voted against my amendment that would provide the same disaster tax relief to all victims of natural disasters.
Last year after hurricanes ravaged his Texas district, Chairman Brady offered a bill that provided targeted tax relief for the victims of disaster that struck his community.
Markup of the latest iteration of the Republicans‚Äô tax breaks bill just wrapped up. The majority was more focused on an irresponsible, unpaid for tax cut for the richest one percent and big corporations than helping everyone get ahead. Read my statement on why I voted NO. https://t.co/sfhkNVUkQ1
The irresponsible, unpaid for tax bill 2.0 makes the cap on State and Local Tax deductions permanent, unfairly penalizing CA &amp; making it harder for local governments to pay for services like health care, infrastructure &amp; law enforcement. More from @latimes https://t.co/VRgQ0u8K6O
Between the bill the majority is marking up today and last year‚Äôs tax breaks legislation, these bills will add more than $3 trillion to the debt, giving Republicans an excuse to chip away at Medicare and Social Security. RT to tell them this is unacceptable.
The GOP is holding a markup for the #TaxScam 2.0. It‚Äôs reckless policy focused on gifting huge tax breaks to the richest 1% while eliminating tax incentives for the middle class and leaving low-income families in the dust. I‚Äôll be speaking out‚Äîtune in: https://t.co/Ufyv4HuPAv

Of course they are looking to interfere in the election, our intelligence leaders said they did in 2016 and are working to interfere now!

What‚Äôs more, the President‚Äôs ridiculous walk back of his comments does nothing to undo the damage he has caused.
POTUS abandoned our values this week by suggesting Putin was not responsible for election interference and belittling our intelligence community. As a former member of the Intel Committee, I know they put their lives on the line to provide information invaluable to our safety.

Joined my colleagues to demand the President end his cruel and inhumane policy that leaves families separated at the border. Democrats introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act that reverses this policy. I am demanding the Speaker hold a vote immediately. https://t.co/ovqQaIiKmo
The President is losing some of his staunchest supporters, the religious right, and rightly so. Separating families is cruel, inhumane, and contrary to family values. https://t.co/oiVR2EHQMg
The president is the one who created this directive, he could reverse it at any time, and he should do so immediately. Today I joined 25 faith leaders in our district to strongly condemn this policy. Click to read more. (2/2) https://t.co/GfsRNDAgXH
The Administration‚Äôs cruel family separation policy has inflicted lasting trauma on children and is completely against our nation‚Äôs child welfare policies. It violates human rights and human dignity. (1/2)
Yesterday, @AmCollSurgeons and the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force hosted a #StopTheBleed training session for Congressional staffers, designed to give bystanders the education necessary to respond in emergency situations with traumatic injuries.

This rule doesn't address underlying drivers of rising premiums, it'll just exacerbate costs by allowing junk plans that don‚Äôt cover essential services and discriminate based on age/gender/occupation. This is merely another attempt to sabotage the ACA https://t.co/0NMiJXOHTn
Again today I cannot stop thinking of the photos and sounds of scared children ripped from their parents at the border. The president must immediately end this policy, which he can do anytime, so we can #KeepFamiliesTogether.

And he has lost the trust of the American people, flagrantly violating ethics rules and misusing tax payer funds. It‚Äôs time for him to go. Today, I joined over 125 members of Congress in calling on Pruitt to resign. https://t.co/0EBBFEG2CP
Administrator Pruitt must resign. He has failed in the agency‚Äôs mission to protect the health and environment of our nation, including ignoring recommendations from top scientists and loosening protections that help control pollution.
I asked Labor Sec Acosta why bipartisan bills, like mine to create a tax credit to close the skills gap, weren't considered in the GOP tax plan. If the plan had included expert testimony and bipartisan input, we could have made a real difference in boosting our middle class. https://t.co/BkEyIvEFLd
From @sacbee_news: Tax cuts will be anything but for about 1M CA taxpayers who will owe Uncle Sam more money a year from now... who will lose a collective $12B b/c the new law caps a deduction they have been able to take for paying state &amp; local taxes. https://t.co/G4mj0NL9lO
The GOP tax plan is disproportionately hurting Californians, forcing them to pay more, while giving the benefits to wealthy corporations.
Tax cuts don‚Äôt pay for themselves, so how do Republicans want to pay for the #GOPTaxScam? By cutting crucial benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. https://t.co/kztua1z5C6
Republicans falsely sold the #GOPTaxScam as a bill for the middle class. In reality, people at the very top will ultimately get 83% of the benefits and middle-class Americans get left behind.

Exciting news ‚Äì we continue breaking records of support for my bill to strengthen and expand background checks, adding our 207th cosponsor this week! This reflects the vast public support we have for these ideas and I will continue pushing for a vote.
We must have a thoughtful and deliberate discussion on matters this serious. We must also work as an international community to respond to these atrocities to build a resolution to this conflict. 3/3
According to the process laid out in our constitution, the president should be working with Congress to formulate these kinds of attacks and determine our strategy in Syria. 2/3
The use of chemical weapons is an absolute travesty and Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable for these actions. Tonight the president announced strikes on key targets in Syria in retaliation to that attack. 1/3

The president‚Äôs public posturing on potential military action in Syria is reckless and irresponsible. Launching missiles is not a reality television show and should not be joked about at a dinner nor referenced flippantly in a tweet. https://t.co/qaagVDalud
Today I voted against the so-called ‚ÄúBalanced Budget Amendment‚Äù because it would have ransacked funding from Medicare and Social Security. We cannot allow money to be taken from these safety nets that our seniors rely on and that they have paid into their whole lives.

This just in, the non-partisan CBO estimates that the deficit will hit $1 trillion by 2020 and $1.5 trillion by 2028, our country‚Äôs largest ever deficit. Its estimates show that this drastic increase is in part due to laws passed by Republican leaders, including the tax plan.

Stronger background checks are widely supported, including by 69% of NRA members, 78% of gun owners not part of the NRA, and 89% of Americans who don‚Äôt own a gun. Time for GOP leaders to allow us to vote on my bill to improve the background checks system. https://t.co/3Gqd8ziIBM
This report is a farce. The question of how and to what extent Russian actors interfered in our election is a serious matter that is above party politics. Rep. Conway should immediately resume the investigation and conduct it in a serious and nonpartisan manner. Shame on him. https://t.co/GIfcyF39ht
Thank you to students at Newark Memorial High School for your engaging and passionate discussion with me, @RepRoKhanna, and @Warriors Coach @SteveKerr. We talked about solutions to help prevent gun violence and keep our schools, our communities, and our nation safe. https://t.co/P8y0mm1UAm
We have legislation that is widely supported by Democrats and Republicans that will strengthen our background checks system and help keep guns from dangerous individuals. We must take action to prevent gun violence and keep our schools, our communities, and our nation safe. 3/3
People across our nation are calling for meaningful action and the White House is merely feigning in order to appease his base. While I am disappointed, my resolve to force action is only strengthened. 2/3
Today the White House released so-called proposals on gun violence, showing that as we feared, the President has cowed to the NRA and is turning his back on the millions of Americans who have already suffered from gun violence and the many who are vulnerable. 1/3
Christine Loeber, Jen Golick, and Jennifer Gonzales Shushereba were three of our district‚Äôs finest who got up every day to care for our veterans. This weekend, we honor and remember their lives and the good they did for others. https://t.co/m75KFC3UyU

Once again, @realDonaldTrump peddles more fake news of his own. This week's State of the Union was not the most-watched ever. It wasn't even the second, third, or fourth-most watched.

@realDonaldTrump may have stuck to script last night ‚Äì but it wasn‚Äôt honest. Clean coal doesn‚Äôt exist. GOP tax cuts help the wealthy, not working families. And he failed to mention the 13 million Americans who will no longer have health coverage because of his reckless actions.
My prayers are with my Republican colleagues, their staff, and everyone affected by this morning's tragic train crash. My heartfelt thanks to the law enforcement and first responders on the scene.
Our country faces great challenges, and I will continue to work with Democrats and Republicans to address the issues important to our district and our nation
While he outlined policy issues that we all agree need to be addressed, he was long on platitudes and short on details.  And, there were many issues he failed to talk about like gun violence prevention, passing much needed disaster relief and addressing climate change.
It was a well-orchestrated show featuring American heroes and heroines with stories that were truly inspiring.

Proud to cosponsor the Families of Fallen Servicemembers First Act to ensure military death benefits are paid to surviving family members during #TrumpShutdown. Unconscionable that grieving family members can't collect benefits because Rs in Congress can't get their act together.
Every day our government remains closed, the U.S. economy takes a huge hit. The last time the government was shut down in 2013, it cost our economy $1.5 billion per day. We must work together to find a responsible way to fund our government and end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/msYIqdBXyx

Per @NASA, 2017 was the second hottest year on record. Unfortunately, over the last year, @POTUS continued to deny climate science &amp; dismantle policy to help combat and prepare for climate change. We must work to mitigate climate change, not exacerbate it. https://t.co/t1ifvFxINo
My colleagues and I have introduced a resolution to formally censure @POTUS for the profanity he used to describe Haiti and all African nations. We must make it clear: these hateful and discriminatory words do not represent our American values nor our immigration priorities.

Last night, @POTUS yet again taunted North Korea, escalating tensions further. But this time, he explicitly threatened nuclear war, making our country and our planet less safe. This rhetoric is beyond concerning and should not be coming from a Commander-in-Chief.
