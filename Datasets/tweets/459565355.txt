RT @manutdreport: Howard unstoppable tonight. We taught him well. #bel #usa
BRadley played for Roma and Dempsey played for tottenham and fulham... howard also played on UNITED
Tim Howard plays for Everton so he is used to top players unlike some of the US team who play on bad MLS teams
it was coming
Neuer is going out so far, but he has prevented a lot of chances by doing it
nothing is going right for either team
