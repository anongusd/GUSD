@Twins @SouzaJr Also, the excellent catch he made earlier in the game (though not as good as @EddieRosario09 or @OfficialBuck103).

If you're not at the @twins game, you should be watching in @fsnorth. This is TV gold. @toriihunter48 @dbremer_pxp have us crying laughing.

@wintwins we need another syllable. We take rhythm very seriously.
Keep in mind the home team's record, and how important this particular game is. #howtobeavisitingfan
You do not need to cheer at the top of your lungs for a base hit. Bring it down an octave at least.
There is a certain etiquette for how to be a visiting fan at a ballgame. This girl near me is doing it wrong. #annoyingashell
Usually I'm overly critical (someone has to be) of the kid announcers but this one isn't bad.
Doesn't bode well for MN summer for the Twins to be this bad and Skeeta to be this good.

Me too. Perfectly sums up how I feel today. RT @mezzanine76: I hate the end of baseball season. HATE. :(
I don't really follow the Vikings, but from what I've been hearing, their relief pitching sucks.
