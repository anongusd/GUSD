@sgt_stingray @Mari_Noy @LoudResister @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Absolutely wrong. We are no longer supporting your stance
@TheChad10725333 @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Where do you come off? On the side of misogyny no doubt
@sgt_stingray @Mari_Noy @LoudResister @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Yes it does include single men. We must consider our job as all encompassing. Our children MUST be recognized by the Corporate world
@sgt_stingray @LoudResister @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC I agree and I am talking about now not 1960. Our country is still a country operated by men but it is changing because women are changing the narative
@sgt_stingray @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC I work for a large Arch firm. They just realigned their salary structure because the HAD to not because they wanted to. They apologized and we had to organize. It was humiliating really. Why must we fight for equal pay for equal work

@sgt_stingray @LoudResister @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Totally wrong. Real women, the ones who struggle to survive in a man's world know this. The ones who don't straddle the fence (i.e., white women Trump supporters) know how really difficult it is to succeed while being marginalized
@sgt_stingray @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Ray...I think you are confused. Go back and listen to the hearing and her questions. If you have a daughter you should be interested because one day it might be her asking Big Pharm important questions and not some candidate supported by them

@sgt_stingray @LoudResister @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC My partner is a Guarani Indian born in a hut in SA mountains. Trust me I know masculinity and I absolutely love it. He has taught me what true partnership is. How could I know I was raised by a brute and a weak woman
@sgt_stingray @LoudResister @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Bull shit. 4 sons and 14 strays later. My sons are the new normal. You probably don't know it, but we women run our own lives now. It's my house, my car, my problem and my success. Just ask my girls who are accomplished and respected and dont NEED a husband for anything
@sgt_stingray @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Again, she was pointing out the attitude, the down talk. Power is not given it is taken. She point out the facts
@sgt_stingray @LoudResister @Mari_Noy @TheOfficerTatum @AOC It WAS sexism. You are just too masculine to feel it
@Mari_Noy @sgt_stingray @TheOfficerTatum @AOC We DO however have babies. And you are not going to penalize us for it anymore. Or not hire us because we have a womb. You will give us time to make a family and to bond and you will protect our jobs. This is the new normal
@Mari_Noy @sgt_stingray @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Or pointing out misogyny or talking down. I have seen her talk in Queens and she takes no prisoners.
@Lancer_Jacob @sgt_stingray @TheOfficerTatum @AOC Or women

@MelissaAGarriga @michaeljknowles @Ocasio2018 It's not a FRONT. She always spent large amounts of her life in the Bronx. They moved to get her an education and her Dad's opportunity was better than the rest of her family as he studied architecture and moved up. But the family as my family did moved up alone and struggled.
@miazu_ @michaeljknowles @Ocasio2018 But she was from the Bronx when she had one foot always in the Bronx. When your Grandma or Aunt, the most helpful, important person to your Mom lives there, you are from the Bronx as much as anyone else. You learn to eat, dance, culture, music, paddleball, parks. It's cellular

@michaeljknowles @Ocasio2018 Living in Mt. Vernon the city of Homes meant right side of the tracks vs. left. Knowing struggle is all you really need to want to make things better.
@michaeljknowles @Ocasio2018 We saw how the differences worked. I did. Evertime I walked over that hole in the floor to access an apt in the Bronx. Or saw a rat. We didn't talk about it EVER! My Dad did better than his brother and sister and that difference was very SMALL and 1 paycheck away from poverty.
@michaeljknowles @Ocasio2018 Mike, IF you had family in the So. Bronx? IF your Mom took your Cousin in during the Summer to keep her safe because you were in Mt. Vernon?? THEN MAYBE you get that being a family means living the struggles together.
@Ocasio2018 Attempted rape. Robbery of the Coffee Shop, run down apt bldgs in such dissarray it broke my "entitled" heart and I was a Fireman's daughter??? We had to walk over holes to access apts. You had to strive for opportunity and my very poor family knew this. But it was TIGHT $$
@Ocasio2018 People don't understand. Dad pulled us into the lower middle class as a Firefighter. We kids did the same. BUT, it wasnt like that on Orloff Avenue in the Bronx where my Cousins struggled. My Uncle a diabetic struggled to live.

@CalebJHull @cameron_kasky Not true. We are organized and working very hard. Moms, professionals, students and intellectuals. A blue wave of happy liberals. And were NOT pillow fighting anymore
@cameron_kasky The diversity now is natural and people are sure about it. That wasn't the case in 1974. People still stay separated but we need to fight that. It's hard for us because trust is built and we already failed that. But your generation has already changed the world üíó
@cameron_kasky You guys will fix this. I'm 63. We survived a High School race war in 72, 73, and some more conflict in 74. I went on to work in a VERY diversified city and job. So everything that happened disappeared for me. Not so for a lot of other white students.

@plitter What? That's my train? Explain this?
@plitter @CurbedNY We have instituted a tuition free undergrad program in NYC colleges. A commitment from Amazon to support that program for undergrad students who study here would be huge! Too many students end up homeless or drop out. Amazon could change all that and NYC get a 2-year committment
@plitter @CurbedNY Your interview was informative. Do you really think this announcement isnt huge for us? Can you tell us who will be building the premises? Will they create public spaces? Will tranportation, housing, healthcare and job hours/steady career jobs be guaranteed

@NYCMayor He's right. We here in Queens, in turn, bring the world to Amazon in one microcosm. We must be able to talk collectively both as a worker and a neighbor
@Schlemieleon @NYCMayor That's right. And Amazon knew that. If the average pay is 150K as Cuomo recited thats good. And there is $$ for Queensbridge Housing being spentl0lpll
