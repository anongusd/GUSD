@RockcityFM Pls wat is the essence of mastech by Governor Amosun when there is no fund to run it &amp; no infrastructure in the school
@RockCityFM101  governor Amosun is not God telling who the next governor of Ogun State will be,as if he has already written the results.
@RockcityFM Mr President is slowness,what has he done in the area of budget transparency,security,unemployment,electricity,etc
@RockcityFMOn channel TV wen Apc Governor was interviewed he talk about is certificate.he said opponent said he graduated in Ile IFE but not
@RockcityFM Barrister wale, let be sincere to each other President is in competent in the area of democratic Govt he may try military Govt
@RockcityFM Dr Nkon and Governor Amosun are the only one that can see what ogun people can see.
@RockcityFM Dr Nkon is been sentimental,is it governor Amosun only can see what all the people of Ogun can't see.
@RockcityFM l will like the private sector &amp; Transport sector, likewise the NNPC to be inclusive in the strike Action.
@RockCityFM.l support the strike Action by NLC because if the don't go now b4 the election,it will be hard for them after the election.
@RockCityFM. Am 99% support of the strike Action by NLC because our political leader in Nigeria are too selfish and greedy.
