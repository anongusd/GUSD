RT @naval: 27/ Blockchains combine the openness of democracy and the Internet with the merit of markets.
RT @naval: 26/ Bitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Etherium pays for (executing and verifying) computation.
RT @naval: 25/ Blockchains pay in coin, but the coin just tracks the work done. And different blockchains demand different work.
RT @naval: 24/ It's important to note that blockchains pay in their own coin, not the common (dollar) money of financial markets.
RT @naval: 23/ As society gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.

RT @naval: 10/ Some are run by kings and priests who choose what is money and law, sacred and profane. Rule is closed to outsiders and base‚Ä¶
RT @naval: 9/ And the Rulers of these networks become the most powerful people in society.
RT @naval: 8/ Network effects thus create a winner-take-all dynamic. The leading network tends towards becoming the only network.
RT @naval: 7/ Networks have "network effects." Adding a new participant increases the value of the network for all existing participants.
RT @naval: 6/ Networks must be organized according to rules. They require Rulers to enforce these rules. Against cheaters.
RT @naval: 5/ Money is a network. Religion is a network. A corporation is a network. Roads are a network. Electricity is a network...
RT @naval: 4/ Overlapping networks create and organize our society. Physical, digital, and mental roads connecting us all.
RT @naval: 3/ Networks allow us to cooperate when we would otherwise go it alone. And networks allocate the fruits of our cooperation.
RT @naval: 2/ Humans are the networked species. The first species to network across genetic boundaries and thus seize the world.
