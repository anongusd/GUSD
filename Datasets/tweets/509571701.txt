@JoyAnnReid @ThePlumLineGS @senatemajldr You didn't seem to have a problem with Russians when your messiah Obozo told Medvedev but he would have much more political room to maneuver after the elections!		Once again you proved yourself to be the ultimate hypocrite, and self-indulgent liar and narcissist!
@EWErickson I suggest you take a look at the CDC numbers concerning the spread of Once Dead infectious disease: TB tops the list!		So tell me, would it upset you if your children contracted TB from illegal alien children in public schools?		People who went through Ellis were screened.
@EWErickson I hate to break the news to you my dear fellow, but we are once again in the late 1920s and early 30s; it's very Vogue to condemn Jews for anything and everything!		Leftist Democrats walk hand-in-hand with Sharia Muslims these days, everything is to be blamed on Israel thus Jews
@EdwardHBOh @stephenfhayes @mrsalzwedel I'll tell you what, well I'm also no longer a member of the GOP, the Democrats are the core party of racism by their policies!		Democrats heartily believe in Neo manifest destiny, and constantly denigrate people of color by their Neo slave policies!		Dems only see skin color
@EWErickson Really?		The underlying premise of your statement is predicated upon a myth: the Democrats might actually consider governing by the rule of law, rather than the end justifying the means, as in the example of Obama, Schumer, Pelosi, the CBC, take your pick!
@SoFlaDre @ScottPresler @LindseyGrahamSC Considering the fact that neither Pelosi nor Schumer, nor any of the people that you name as your would be president, have any ethics, morals, or Integrity either personal or professional!		Doesnt matter if Trump creates precedent, because like Obama Democrats reject rule of law

@TheSharkDaymond @rkelly Your anti-white bigotry and racism sir are not appreciated!		Sure, all white people are rich, all white people have power, all white people no prob with cops!		Hushed up because he has millions, and he is powerful black!		White authorities targeting famous black man, "racism"?
@AndyRichter You mean like the one trillion dollars that your massiah Obama spent on absolutely nothing, and then laughed about it?		The trillion dollars was supposed to be for the bridges, the roads, Etc!		Where did it all go?		Go ask your massiah.
@Mel_lific There you go again Mel, using logic, facts, and sound reasoning!		Shame on you!
@EWErickson Really? Please take the time to explain to me, dimwit independent conservative that I am, as to how such a declaration would meet the definition, historical definition, of high crimes and misdemeanors?		Where in any legislation does it make his proposed action a crime?
@HannahAllam I do so hope that you will inform the new congresswoman that the post it will give her some problems with the government of Egypt.	The post it declares that somewhere between the Nile Valley and/or due West of Cairo is the new state of Palestine!		Al Sisi might be upset.
@memii_social @amjoyshow @MSNBC @SpeakerPelosi @JoyAnnReid Should your contention that white people are as racist as you believe them to be, then slavery would still be illegal.		Barack Obama would have never been elected, twice, nor would any state has ever had a black governor, nor senators.		Your premise invalid b/c real world facts
@ClintSmithIII @kara_dreamer The most core aspect of the abolition movement of the 19th century, was its founding, support, and real world succes, by white biblical Christians!		This aspect of the abolition movement is heavily redacted these days, which actually hurts the concept of Liberty for all.
@EWErickson The media keeps saying a lot of things, and almost none of it has any basis in reality, empirical evidence, or factual basis.		They like it that way of course, because they can pretty much write and Report anything they want, and act as if it was actually true.
@JonahNRO You are obviously engaging in rank sexism my dear fellow! Next thing you know, you'll be calling her 'articulate'!		Remember, she is a member of the Nomenklatura, and Apparatchik of the first order, and an upstanding member of the Vanguard of the Proletariat!		Tsk, tsk, tsk!
@JeriFinke @politico It's always nice to see someone from the Left, calling upon God in heaven, you know, the God of the Bible, the One Who declares that He knows the names of Unborn babies while they're still in their mothers wombs, as he knows them as persons whilst still in the womb?		Dbl stndrd?
@Cleft_Music @politico My, my, my, how very open-minded of you, how very accepting of opinions diverse from your own!		Your anti biblical Christian bigotry is shining through bright and glaringly true to form for the Left!		Do I hear Echoes of a brown shirt Paradigm in your text?
@EWErickson Whispers: who cares? The Founders created the Electoral System to keep the easily bought off Mobs from destroying the nation.		I see your Trump derangement syndrome is still in full swing!		Oh yeah, I did not vote for Trump in 2016, I voted for a third-party candidate.
@JonahNRO Love the video, as I intend on raising Kinder goats when I sell my house here in Wyoming, relocate to the Kenai Peninsula, so I can enjoy warmer Winters!		Goats Rock, they make great weed eaters, people all over the country have goat weed eating businesses; yes, for real.
@RealJamesWoods I just finally deleted a tweet for which I was suspended last year, early last year, informing a pro Muslim woman why Islam is not a religion of peace.		I finally saw something which bothered me enough, to finally Bend to their tyranny and delete my tweet concerning Islam.
@EWErickson No, as usual you're wrong on this one too!		The reason many of us are upset, and please remember I did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016, is Romney is a backstabbing twit, considering Trump campaigned for Romney and he was happy to have him campaign in Utah!		Et tu Brutus?
@holliesmckay Would you please be so kind as to explain to me why you continue to refer to South American nations as Latin American nations, considering they are not geographically in Central America?		Thank you for your time.
@MADAMPrezToYou @RitaLiLz @larkinsroad Tell you what snookums, why don't you take a trip to the Sudan, or Saudi Arabia, or Kuwait, or any other muslim-majority country, and wear a mini-skirt, or a low-cut blouse, or promote abortion, or try and preach neo-paganism?		You wouldn't last 5 minutes!
@RitaLiLz News flash Rita, Muslim is not a race!!		There are black Muslims, white Muslims, Chinese Muslims, Asian Muslims, Indian Muslims, Etc!		Why don't you pull your head out for a moment, stop being politically correct, put the bong down, and try and get in touch with reality!
@MuslimIQ He was not being islamophobic, he was being contextually accurate, and any honest reading of the Hadith, or the Koran proves this fact! Further, Muslim is not a race and you know that, so stop trolling with the race card, you're being dishonest, ah yes, taqiyya!
@anonymously_all @Starbucks Sad to see that you are another politically correct idiot, as the fact, look that word up since you don't understand it, fact, is that Muslim is not a race!		A Muslim is an adherent to the genocide religion of Islam! There are white Muslims, black Muslims, Asian Muslims , Etc!
@rizkimoh1 @cjwerleman Congratulations on being another dimwit when it comes to the issue of Islam and opposing it!		Muslim is not a race, it is an adherent to the genocide of the religion of Islam!		Did you get that point my dear dimwit? Muslim is not a race, the man was not a racist!
@TElleElle News flash to all the dimwits who keep calling the guy a racist, Muslim is not a race you idiots, a Muslim isn't a Tarrant of the genocide of religion of Islam!		Why don't you take a moment to actually learn facts, rather than mere subjective personal opinion?

Here is a prime example of severe mainstream media bias.		They hate Trump so much, they don't care about truth.		New York Times slams AWOL Pompeo, then learns he was rescuing Americans https://t.co/KTPwi6QeBW via the @FoxNews Android app
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Like I said, I've already done the work, that's how I know they're biased, severely biased, to the point of being nothing more than left-wing propaganda machines. You've implied you know that to be the case as well.		I'm done with a proven liar. You're ignored from here on in!
@Lennyash @BlockMyWords @susan19514 @BillOReilly Troll
@Lennyash @BlockMyWords @susan19514 @BillOReilly Say, how is your mama's basement today?		Are you getting enough pudding snacks?
@Lennyash @BlockMyWords @susan19514 @BillOReilly First one has to commit treason, in order to be a traitor.		I have not engaged in treason, point of fact I didn't even vote for Trump I voted for a third party candidate!		It is only leftist, socialists, who stipulate that if you're not in lockstep with them, you're a traitor!
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly You just proven yourself to be either severely incompetent concerning nomenclature, logic, or, as I suspect considering what you've written, another lying never Trumper.		You implied that you agree with what I've written, that is a severe bias of the organizations of mentioned.
@pbullet50 @susan19514 @BillOReilly Unlike Bill Clinton's lies, Trump hasn't raped 3 different women, perjured himself as president, abused his office with an intern, and on that last where are the me-too crowd on his rapes and abuse?		They're hypocrisy speaks volumes
@StellarJ_bird @susan19514 @BillOReilly Because the source who continually say he lies, are the same sources who skew what they write about him, outright lie about him, and make things up on a regular basis.		CNN, MSNBC, ABC, all of had to retract major stories.		Never trumper's are delusional!
@SuzannaAnselm @susan19514 @BillOReilly Your Source comes from three left-wing nutjobs, and NPR is so severely biased, that they actually fired a fellow leftist, Juan Williams, when he took an out of Orthodoxy line!		NPR is the American Pravda! No more tax money for it!
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly No actually just, you didn't feed me any facts you just fed me left-wing propaganda!		The only way for you to not know that the New York Times, the wapo, CNN, are severely biased, is for you to be either brain dead, living under a rock, or a liar.		You're a proven liar.
@Lennyash @BlockMyWords @susan19514 @BillOReilly Keep going Junior High boy! Your retorts are of a superb nature, without a doubt you must be a stellar smile on your mama's face!
@rnelson0 @BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Since you seem to enjoy the fifth grade elementary school level, here's one right up your alley:		" I know you are, but what am I?"		Keeps slogging in the fecal matter never Trumper!
@notmeanspirited @susan19514 @BillOReilly Accusations are not facts.		When it comes to issues like this, I'll defer to professional such as Professor Christina Hoff Sommers, and Professor Camille Paglia, opposite ends of the political Spectrum, but both highly astute and honest women, and superb academics!
@rnelson0 @BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly I must admit Nelson you're a Wordsmith of inanities!
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly There you go running away from your responsibilities!		Lastly, you can't even admit that you lied, nor accept responsibility for what you said.		Have a nice night.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly I'm going back to my video, I'm done dealing with a liar who can't admit that he lied about what I said, and about what he said.		Thank you for proving that the left, antifa, mindset is utterly bankrupt.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly I presented positions, which have been publicly proven, I can't help it that you're too lazy to go ahead and confirm or deny whether it is I've written.		The best lie about me screaming what I've written, and lie about telling me to up and leave.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Well now you just playing lied, and publicly, in a public forum.		You told me to shut up, to be silent, and to leave.		You are the quintessential leftist, attempting to shut down any opinion with which you do not agree.		Thank you for proving my point, again.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly I've already done the research, I don't intend to do it twice for someone who doesn't have the integrity their own work.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Oh, I see you shifted from using the words scream and screaming, did the phrase zero value, as if it amplifies the of your words!		You haven't refuted my statement concerning the New York Times or the Washington Post, nor can you refute my point on NPR!		Do your own work Lazy.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Apparently, you've never actually read the First Amendment, nor more importantly, The Federalist Papers and the argumentation is there in!		Debating issues in the public forum was the reason for the First Amendment: it pertains not merely to government.		Case law.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Lastly my dear loudmouth, since you like using the words scream and screaming so much, I will never let a left-wing fanatic silence me.		Should you not like what I say, this is a public forum, go right ahead and move along!		Fleeing facts is what the left does the best and lie.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly I don't assist lazy people like you, I point them in the direction to do the same work that I did in my research.		I cited specifically, the New York Times in the Washington Post.		Further, I noted that both organizations have admitted publicly to being left biased.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Screaming must be your favorite word of the day, or maybe that's the extent of your argumentative abilities!		I specifically pointed out sources, IE, New York Times, Washington Post, both organizations have admitted publicly on several occasions they are in fact Left biased!
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Apparently you were interested in my assertions, otherwise you wouldn't have bothered to respond!		Secondly my dear left wing aficionado, this is a public forum, where everyone's opinion is valid, and worthwhile with sourcing, valid sourcing.		First Amendment, look it up.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Yeah, despite your severe bias, which is proven by your statement that I screamed what I said, despite nothing I wrote being in caps, bias source skew what they write, and that is a given according to the academic paradigm of contextual face value hermeneutics.		Look it up.
@BlockMyWords @Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Oh yes, the vaunted NPR, a self-admitted hardcore leftist organization which is supplied by taxpayer money!		They are left-wing, and are not any more of a reliable source than https://t.co/cUPea7poGt!		Objective Source prove the Trump has brought economy back, oil patch proves it
@StellarJ_bird @susan19514 @BillOReilly I'll stick with the economic facts, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, and other business sources, including Bloomberg.		Bottom line is that Trump has done wonders for the economy, and geopolitics.		Brought North Korea to the table, PRC to the table, we are respected!
@GranChandler @susan19514 @BillOReilly Yeah Chandler not really a coherent answer, nor empirically based!		I did not vote for Trump, I voted for a third party candidate.		I don't own Maga attire at all, nor have I attended any of his rallies.		The economic facts or what I pay attention to, the economy is growing.
@sayWhat215 @susan19514 @BillOReilly You mean as opposed to the New York Times, The Washington Post, the Clinton News Network, and MSNBC?		Next thing you'll be telling me is that Alyssa Milano is a reliable source concerning crime data relating to guns!		I'll stick with FBI crime data, and other empirical sources.
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly So looking at the comparative, the two or not equivalent.		Although, considering what you've written, I seriously doubt you've ever taken any college level courses in logic, comparative analysis, no graduate research.		You can start personal attacks again, BC you've no proof.
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Further, concerning rape, Trump, and Bill Clinton, three separate women accused Bill Clinton of rape. No one in law enforcement would listen to them, as Bill Clinton was either the attorney general and later governor.		A wife going through divorce accused her soon-to-be-ex of rp
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Thank you once again for the ad hominems, you're such a professional!		If law enforcement had believed the testimony, he would have been arrested, charged, tried, and possibly found guilty.		Why wasn't he?		Once again, I didnt vote for Trump, I voted for Little Boots, since 2004.
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly If there had been proof of rape, crooked Hillary would have found it!		No collusion by Trump. No rape by Trump. No perjury by Trump.		Adam Schiff wrong. Mueller wrong; neither has brought forth a single scintilla of proof for any of the accusations!		Just hyperbole by the left!
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly My dear lackluster fellow, those who throw personal invective around are those who have no Foundation factually upon which to stand!		Trump is President. Bill Clinton was president. Trump not a lawyer. Trump never an attorney general. Trump never a governor. Trump no perjury.
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly You can go ahead and sling personal invective all you like, but that doesn't change the facts!		Adam Schiff said he had firm concrete evidence of collusion by Trump 18 months ago. Shown none!		Mueller no collusion! Never trumper's R insane.		I didn't vote for Trump!
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Newsflash, Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury!		Perjury is a felony. Bill Clinton unlike Trump, was not just a lawyer, he was the Attorney General of a state and he was a governor! As president chief law enforcement officer.		He committed perjury which is a felony
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Scumbag or not, he didn't rape anyone, but Bill Clinton did in fact raped to women, and tried to rape a third, while he was Attorney General of Arkansas and then governor!		Unemployment 3.9% black unemployment 6.4%. Hispanic unemployment historic low.		Average income up!
@Lennyash @susan19514 @BillOReilly Once again, you are citing an article by three never trumper's, hardcore lefties who hate Trump's guts.		The Source you use is biased.		Further, the proof is in the pudding: Trump continues to fulfill his campaign promises.		Unemployment 3.9%. Black unemployment 6%.
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Lastly Whereabouts, well I stridently disagree with philandering, AKA adultery, that is between Trump and his wife, not you and me.		The Democrats and social justice Warriors of the 90s who defended Bill Clinton and his rapes, abusive office with an intern, are now eating crow!
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Thirdly Whereabouts, just like Nancy Pelosi, Chucky Schumer, Harry Reid, Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Democratic National Committee chairs, and every damn in office during the 90s, private lives are private buy those in office.		Two words: Bill Clinton.
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Further Whereabouts, he committed no felony otherwise he would have already been charged, considering Schneiderman heated and hates his guts!		Further yet, people voted for him because they wanted to change they were tired of the lies buy Pro Pols, promises never kept
@lost_cj @susan19514 @BillOReilly Tell you what they're slick, as soon as you demand that Bill Clinton be arrested for the same thing, but worse, the RAPE of at least two women while he was attorney general and governor of Arkansas, and the attempted rape of at least one more woman, your words have no meaning!
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly Yes, petroleum does need reinvigorating.		I know this is a first-hand fact, because I live in the oil patch, literally.		You were the one Speaking from willful ignorance, devoid of facts, because the facts do not fit your emotionally based worldview.
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly I'm not call you stupid, just merely willfully ignorant, because you're not willing to do the research using objective sources, rather than left-wing never Trump source.		You're entitled to your opinions, but not your own facts.		The economy is rolling, and average folks winning
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly Corporations clothes stores all the time, and one of the reasons is that the retail Paradigm is Shifting all across the globe.		Amazon, a company run by a hardcore left-wing Nut Job, has changed the retail Paradigm.		Brick-and-mortar stores have horrifically High overheads!
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly First you said that the bonuses weren't given, now you're saying they were only given to some folks, and they were only $1,000!		Tell you what chickie, I'll take a grand any day of the week, it might be crumbs to you, but it's major money to me, and millions of others!
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly I've researched the CSS based on the Canadian paradigm, so I really don't care whether you believe what I've got on my bio or not.		I earned the degrees I've done the work, I do not base my opinions on feelings.
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly Once again, science and facts do not back up your position!		Obama's 2015 CSS carbon-capture plot, was based upon one single section of one power plant in Canada.		It cost 1.2 billion dollars for minimal capture.		Obama and his thugs admitted CSS was to stop all new coal plants.
@JakiBaptiste @susan19514 @BillOReilly Oh yes, an article by three never trumper's, people who are severely suffering from Trump derangement syndrome!		Oh yes, they can be trusted, for sure!		Pruitt at EPA has just jump started the coal industry again in the USA, by getting rid of Obama's carbon capture CSS plot
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly You'll have to tell that to the employees of Walmart, carrier, Amazon, Sam's Club, Home Depot, and a couple of thousand other corporations.		Bonuses given out between $500 and $3,000 per employee.		I noticed you use the never Trump anti-trump Washington Post as a source! Nice
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly It is the Democrats who were lying.		18 months ago, Adam Schiff said he had concrete proof of collusion between Trump and the Russians.		Schiff has given zero proof, because there is no proof.		Mueller hired All-Pro Clinton investigators. Severely biased, no honor
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly Perhaps you mean the lies he spoke about forcing North Korea to the negotiations table?		Oh, wait, he's done that too!		How about his promise to get China to stop violating trade and copyright laws, by bringing them to the negotiating table, by tariffs?		Yep, he did that too!
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly Perhaps you mean the supposed lie that he told about cutting useless EPA regulations based upon unproven technology, like CSS, while reinvigorating the Coal and petroleum Industries, creating high paying jobs for average people.		Oh wait, he did that too!		Union members Pro Trump
@SuzyQL @susan19514 @BillOReilly 3000 lies huh?		You mean the LIE of improving the economics of the black middle class, and cutting severely the unemployment level for blacks?		Oh, wait, he actually did those things!		He promised to cut taxes for everyone, and increase take-home pay for average workers! He did!
@marwilliamson You really are a worshipper of counterfactual beliefs aren't you?		Deport all of the family, mom, dad, kids, right back to the countries from which they hale!		We are supposed to be a nation of laws, and we are supposed to have our government put Citizens First.		 Deport illegals
@rathernotsay @rellimkcin @marwilliamson Yes indeed, nomenclature does indeed make a vast difference pertaining to context! Last time I checked, the fellow who historically has been referred to as Dracula, which was the adjectives used by Williamson, was not viewed as an overly nice fellow.		His real name was Vlad Tepes

@RealJamesWoods The Clinton News Network must just be husbanding their energies!		Remember, we're still got Mueller in deep doo-doo, the upcoming November elections, and Rosenstein's and Sessions' heads to be put on Chopping Block for obstructing Trump!		CNN: so many lies to tell so little time!
@BlackPeteTESD @HesNotTheStig @Mel_lific These days I would argue that so-called journalist don't actually report anyting, they merely propagandize and repeat talking points from the Democrats, the Rinos, and other similar socialists on the left!
@kenweaks @hainey_amber @BillOReilly Yeah, but you forget the rest of the teaching pertaining to that phrase!		Do you remember the rest?		Go and sin no more!		The bottom line is that actions are to be held accountable.		Stormy Daniels is a professional hooker. She promotes debasement of women.		Those are the facts.
@hainey_amber @BillOReilly Oh yes, now I understand!		Accusations your proof, right?		So when someone accuses Stormy Daniels of being a low-life s***, who spreads her legs in a manner helping to spread disease, depravity, and the regular debasement of women, that's okay with you right?		Shame on you.
@audreybenny @BillOReilly Oh yeah, did you ever get his goat with that one!!		I did notice however, that you didn't bother to actually address his points.		Your behavior indicates a clear fear of engaging in open, honest, debate!		A clear sign that you're a leftist, a whiner, a snowflake!		You fear facts.
@NoldinGeri @BillOReilly I hate to break this to you, but Human Nature has not changed in 250,000 years!		Public consensus?		Now that has changed!		The songs I grew up with her about making love, wooing your girl, going to a dance and getting lucky, Etc.		These days? Screwing, abuse, whoring.
@susan19514 @BillOReilly Truth?		You mean subjective personal opinion, based upon the ability to garner large amounts of money because of an accusation.		Truth can be verified. Truth can be proven.

That concept is also consistent from the Old Testament to the New Testament.		Actions determine if one is or is not, a follower of the God of Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Jacob
@JegsyScarr @patrickmadrid Old Covenant Judaism put the sins of a child on his or her parents until that child came of age.		The concept of individual responsibility for one's actions, it's consistent from the Old Testament to the New Testament.

@rellimkcin @marwilliamson The reason I mention the 14th Amendment, is that it is the foundation legally speaking, but open borders people rely upon for their arguments of giving constitutional rights to illegal aliens!		The Fourteenth Amendment does not do that, and that is why I keep mentioning it.
@Oldupai9 @the_ectomorph @billiejayne @OctopusPryme It's even worse than you think, at 6 bucks a pint, I can't afford to go out and drink but once every couple months!		Happily, there are a couple of good liquor stores only 40 miles away that have reasonably priced sales from time to time!
@rellimkcin @marwilliamson Further, I strongly suggest that you researched the 14th Amendment, specifically the comments of its author!		The 14th does not cover illegal aliens, it covered freed slaves!		Context, history, and fax, actually do matter!
@rellimkcin @marwilliamson Either the rule of law remains intact, so that everyone, and I do mean everyone, is kept safe from those who would abused the power and trusted to them in County, State, and federal Offices!

@marwilliamson The constitutional republic of America, it's supposed to be a nation of the rule of law, not a Banana Republic, which is what you folks on the open-borders left keep demanding; no borders, no laws, just chaos and danger for Citizens!
@marwilliamson So I take it you'll be condemning Mexico, Guatemala, China, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia, and pretty much every Other Nation on the planet that actually has Sovereign and controlled borders?		No?		Oh yes, the standard double standard of the Left, which is abject hypocrisy!
@Oldupai9 @the_ectomorph @billiejayne @OctopusPryme Possibly, but the research I've done on the biblical side, was using the same tool on the academic side: contextual face value hermeneutics.		I strongly adhere to the concept of the Pauline Mar's Hill paradigm! I believe in agreeing to disagree, preferably over a good ale!
@Oldupai9 @the_ectomorph @billiejayne @OctopusPryme Opinions are like bodily orifices, everyone has them in their equally worthless!		Facts matter. Context matters. Putting aside subjective points of view in favor of empirical evidence is what I believe in pursuing.		That's all I'm asking for, context, facts, objectivity.
@Oldupai9 @the_ectomorph @billiejayne @OctopusPryme Bent out of shape atheists are so hell-bent, pardon the pun, on fomenting hate in themselves and others, to have actually taken time to contextually research biblical doctrines.		I don't mind someone disagrees with me, I'd prefer they base it on knowledge, not from ignorance.
@Oldupai9 @the_ectomorph @billiejayne @OctopusPryme Using the toilet?		No, that would actually be Islam you're thinking about, not biblical Christianity!		I'm not demanding, unlike Muslims, but everyone become a Biblical Christian, all I'm asking for is that people actually understand the subject matter they are denigrating.
@the_ectomorph @OctopusPryme You have an unexamined point of view concerning biblical Christianity, and it is abundantly clear that you don't have a clue as to what those biblical doctrines are, contextually!		I suggest you consider studying the very thing you hate, cuz you're just ignorant of the issues.

@Mel_lific @elbh You are assuming that their accusations are in fact the truth.		No such foundational facts have been found, reported, or confirmed.		What you are agreeing to, is that an accusation is as good as a guilty verdict in a court of law.		When you subscribe to concept, rule of law gone.
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter I thought you were taking the time to bother to read about it.		However, even where he not president, even where he just the average Joe on the street, it would still be immoral and unethical for the reasons I have stated!		Please take the time to address my specific points.
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter Further, as I indicated before, a nineteen-year-old intellectually, and psychologically, and emotionally, is a kid in comparison to the 45 year old.		Physically, the 19-year old, boy or girl, can procreate, they are physically adults.		But psych., emotion, intellect, still kids.
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter So, let's see the nice husband is betraying his vows, his wife, any kids he might have, and in the case of Kennedy, violating the responsibilities and powers of the presidency of the United States. The teenager was working as an intern as I understand it, just like Lewinsky.
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter 3/3		Again, I don't know if Moore is guilty or not, that will come out later.		What I am saying, is it there needs to be one standard for all Behavior, men, women, politicians, non-politicians.		Physically, teenagers look like adults, and they can procreate. Intellectually kids
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter 2/3		A 45 year old has vastly more life experience than a teenager. The 45 year old can manipulate the teenager into doing most anything the older person wants.		Bottom line, fact remains is that we are discussing issues of serious sexual manipulation and control of a teenager.
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter When he's a sitting president, he makes it my problem! Further, I'm not judging anyone, but I see you don't understand what that word actually means: I am stating facts.		45 year old, man or woman, engaged in a sexual relationship with a 19 year old, is immoral and unethical.1/3
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter Oh, I don't know, the fact that he's married, fact that he's president and subverting the morals of teenager, the fact that is 26 years older than she is, taking advantage of her lack of experience, etc!		The fact that you can't see there's a problem, is a problem itself.
@rellimkcin @AnnCoulter If it matters in the case of Roy Moore, it should matter in the case of JFK, and in the case of Senator Menendez, who is on trial right now, and who has been accused of having sex with underage Dominican teenagers.		It never mattered to feminists with Bill Clinton, 4 GOP it does.
@Thomasismyuncle Yeah, and "everyone" back in the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s, knew that all blacks could tap dance, sing the blues, and were natural entertainers, right?		I don't know if Moore is guilty or not, I'm just tired of the guilty-until-proven-innocent mindset in America these days.

@thehill No word and accusations from her or anyone else during how many election cycles that Moore ran for office and was elected to the Supreme Court?	No accusations during the primaries, but come time for the general election and viola accusations abound!
@markfromalbany @Dwarfclone @skiplacombe The timing is what really stands out to me! More ran for Supreme Court Justice how many times and was elected to that office? At least twice I know of, and not a single word from her or anyone else. No word during primaries. Then comes the general election and viola', Democrats!
@Renology_ Interesting thing is, the evolutionists don't know what they really believe in, because they can't agree upon a single theory of evolution, and that's, they have to use qualifiers for everything they say. Catastrophic and Gradual supporters are like ravenous wolves!
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe I don't know how old you are, but I remember the whole Bill Clinton Fiasco, where he was accused not just of fellatio with an intern in the Oval Office, but actually having raped at least two women in Arkansas while he was governor. Compartmentalization was the key phrase used
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent You may share a common ancestor with a cat, but I do not. I adhere to the Genesis version of creation thank you. You're entitled to believe whatever you want to believe. I'll do the same.		When we meet in the public forum, we can each represent our own sides. Live and Let Live
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent It doesn't matter, you are holding that position, and it is to that position to which I refer.
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe One of the key aspects of this entire Fiasco, is the whole question of believability when accused! Particularly when I accused by the left!		Political Integrity is at stake, McConnell and his associates are not acting ethically.
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe Quite frankly, considering Strange, &amp; his backers, I'd still prefer Moore over Strange, even if the accusation is true.		Moore would be an unethical sexual addict, versus and unethical political and social puppet.		Supposed sexual addict might make good choices politically
@Dwarfclone @skiplacombe True, but that's not the act of an informed person. Nor would it be an act of an ethical or moral person. Informed voters, base their decisions upon facts, rather than emotive foundations.		Basically, voting against him on that basis would be irrational!
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent Further, playing on your prose, I've known homosexuals in my life, and none of them have fornicated with animals as far as I know. You and your friends maybe have a different view than those whom I have met. Don't let PETA know!
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent You're emotively based positions do not hold water. Humans are superior to animals, in content, composition, and ability. The entire basis for your argument is your homosexuality. You don't like facts that get in the way of your worldview. Animals don't build aircraft, humans do!
@Dwarfclone @skiplacombe I don't know that it would have been illegal. Immoral yes. Unethical yes.		If it occurred in Bama, what was the age of consent at that time, that the alleged event was to have taken place?
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe Have you ever heard of a Woman by the name of Loretta Lynn? Look her up and see how old she was when she met and married her husband. What is the norm now, was not the norm then. And we still don't know if the accusation is actually true
@skiplacombe @Dwarfclone Yeah, actual facts do seem to be irrelevant to you
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent Hey, you want to debase yourself to the level of an animal, go right ahead! The biological fact is that those species you Talent, continue because of heterosexual biology!		Heterosexuality is the norm, homosexuality is abnormal. I don't care who's homosexual, keep out of my face
@skiplacombe No, that was not my problem. You continue to imbue to me a position concerning the situation with Roy Moore, that I have not taken. End of story. Had you not taken that position, we would not have this conversation. Sorry for the education, prefer monosyllabic?
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe So far, all there has been is accusations! Since Molly Yard, Patricia Ireland, and other radical feminist leaders state that all men are rapists, by their definition and accusation, you must be a rapist. Are you a rapist? Do you acceed to their accusations?
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe Neither did I, but you're in direct contradiction to women's rights leaders who say it 16 year old girls are actually women. Further, they say that the 16 year olds have a right to have sex with whomever they desire. Can't have it both ways! Moore has not been convicted.
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent I don't care as long as they're two consenting adults. The problem is when those two consenting adults move into the public forum and demand that I accept them as natural, normal, and advance to them special rights. That is when I have a problem.
@skiplacombe You're in the same position Moore is in, credible people in the women's rights movement have stated unequivocally that all men are rapists. You are a man. You're calling them Liars, because you state you are not a rapist.
@skiplacombe I'm not angry, I'm just done with Rinos, leftist, fence-sitters, and those who do not debate via contextual face value hermeneutics. Rather like you. You inferred to me position on the issues which I did not evince.
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent You're presuming that sexual attraction, and sexual activity are the same thing. They are not. Lack of self-control is a serious personal self-deception, please see rate of HIV infection amongst homosexuals
@skiplacombe More has not been charged with anything, nor has he been convicted of anything, but here you are stating it as if it were a fact! Now, I'm sure you did work for Glenn Beck.
@skiplacombe And you wonder why I use emotively based invective? You have just stated that more had sex with a teenager, as if it were a proven fact, rather than what it is, an allegation by what seems to be a politically-motivated partisan.
@skiplacombe Too late, the Republic died during the Obama Administration, and it was on life support during George W Bush Administration
@Renology_ @Jim252525 @Independent News flash you historically ignorant twit: paleo Pagan Romans despised Christianity because they elevated women to the status of equality with men. That was 2000 years ago. Backward? That would be radical homosexuals.
@skiplacombe For there, my point and question stand: Molly Yard, Patricia Ireland, and the number of noted radical feminist academics, stipulate that all men are rapists. Are you a rapist?
@skiplacombe I don't care who you used to work for. Your statement screams severe ignorance, and supposition where none was evident in my statements!
@ItsThatBriGuy @skiplacombe You must be an Obama and Hillary supporter. You don't believe in the rule of law, or the innocent till proven guilty. According to most radical feminist, all men are rapists. So, are you a rapist?

@drhouse15545 @Renevelation @iamAtheistGirl What I've seen from your fellow atheist, is that a flood never occurred! Are you now saying that there are numerous geologic examples?

@iamAtheistGirl You're the one professing a butthurt attitude, hurling personal invective viciously from start to stop, you're simply not honest!
@iamAtheistGirl So far, I haven't seen any questions, all I've seen is vicious personal invective thrown my way, and inane stupidity from atheists!

You poor souls can't actually argue, debate empirically, just hurl personal invective!
@iamAtheistGirl The proof that I'm not angry or hateful, is it is you atheists who are heaping personal invective and abuse my way, not me against you!
@iamAtheistGirl Sorry, but there isn't the biblical Christian alive who convert to anyone! God the Holy Spirit does the converting! I'm not angry or hateful

@MrBrendanBlack @apetivist @OctopusPryme My belief is faith-based! You're the one espousing science, burden of proof on you to disprove God does not exist!
@FendleyThomas @apetivist @MrBrendanBlack @OctopusPryme Me? Nope, not me. My Lord Jesus was an is the innovator, Creator of the entire universe. John 1
@sime707 @iamAtheistGirl You do realize the Atheism in atheists are in the absolute minority across the entire Globe, right? Primitive to sophisticated belief in God
@apetivist @MrBrendanBlack @OctopusPryme Actually, it does! My belief based faith in God, you're supposed 2 b scientifically based,burden proof on you disprove the existence of God

@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus Oh yes, you can't defend your arguments honestly, logically, openly, or contextually, so you resort to personal attacks!		You've Surrendered

@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus The ultimate justification is through Christ Jesus and His Cross, not through the actions of a person. Ephesians 2:8-9. Once again, context!

@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Wow. You don't even comprehend the doctrine of the Advent of Christ! The promise goes all the way back to chapter 18 of Genesis! Ignorant!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Quite frankly, you strike me as the kind of person who would even dislike the new Cimarron 44 mag with the octagon barrel!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Been over this four times, &amp; you still don't have a clue because of your hatred and willful ignorance! Try dif subject, you're boring me.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Shed your ignorance, and take the time to read description of crucifixion! Medical description of that capital punishment. No small matter.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Even the Force was disturbed by Vader's voice!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Once again, I must have you repeat after me: JR is not an orthodox Jew. JR is not an orthodox Jew. JR is not an orthodox Jew. New Covenant!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Babylonian Bible written 6th century BC. Three centuries before Alexander the Great was even born!		Two centuries before crucifixion created
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Yeah, that could be true normally, except for a book called The Septuagint, and the Babylonian Bible!		Septuagint written 300BC-200BC
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus Shed your ignorance and educate your yourself!
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus The Apostle Paul said it rather well, "there is neither male nor female, neither slave nor free, God is not a disputer of persons!"
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus It is Islam which equates women to dogs. It is Islam which commands the rape of women.		Biblical Christianity equalized men and women!
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus And this is where the New Covenant is so Splendid, and should be supported, even by atheists!		Biblical Christianity freed women!!
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus I'm not a Democrat, so please do not assign to me deficiencies which are the purview of the Left!		Stop being ignorant!
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus 3/3		Sins which were never enumerated in text, still existed! Humans know when they are doing something wrong, because of a conscience
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus 2/3		The sins mentioned, and others which were not mentioned, we're all pre Ten Commandments!		Are you grokking the dichotomy?
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus There was this little thing called The Flood; one of the sins mentioned was slavery! Murder was another one! 1/3
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus Again, you are contextually ignorant of both Roman Antiquity, what Paul wrote contextually, &amp; obedience to civil laws. Educate yourself!
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus Yes indeed, the Apostle Paul was extremely clear on how brothers in Christ, whether slaves, we're to behave under Roman law.
@GregCampNC I'm not missing anything doctrinally, you're the one shooting wide, Grand Canyon wide, of the mark. Read the book of Hebrews.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Yes, He did. We're right back to your ignorance concerning the doctrine of sin. This is why I keep asking U to educate yourself doctrinally.
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus I wonder if you're this incense with the 2.5 million slaves, owned right now, my good and faithful Muslims, all over the world?
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus And the purveyor of mindless memes continue! Educate yourself and abandon willful ignorance have embraced so gleefully!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad You don't understand the concept of free will do you? Let me put it this way, do you understand dichotomy between voluntary and involuntary?
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus There's no dodging and weaving on my part, you simply don't have the competence to understand the subject matter. Educate yourself!
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus The sin of slavery is the same as the sin of suicide. Is that clear enough for you or very diluted mind?		Committing one sin, commits all.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Thank you so very much for proving my earlier point: you don't have a clue understanding the doctrine of sin. You don't under stand it.
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus New Covenant. New Covenant. New Covenant. New Covenant. Biblical Christian. Biblical Christian.		Not Orthodox Jew. Not Orthodox Jew.
@OctopusPryme @GregCampNC @ReligiousVirus And there it is, the next Mindless meme out of context! Thank you for proving both your ignorance, and my point!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Why do you atheist continually desire to wallow in self-pity induced ignorance? The Advent of Christ is proof of my statement! Wake up!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Biblical Christians are not bound by the law! This is what the term New Covenant means! No sacrificing animals, no self righteousness.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad See, this is what I mean by atheist ignorance! You don't understand what the Cross of Christ means doctrinally. Your statement proves it!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Yeah, He's heard that argument before too, and it's never impressed Him.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Not only did he figure it out he told people. People did not want to listen. Kind of like you don't want to listen. Free will. Blame is on U
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Sorry, only one set of 10 Commandments. Whatever it is you've been smoking, you should stop.		Prophecy of Alexander and his empire in Daniel
@OctopusPryme Oh yes, you can't defend your position, all you can do is throw out another impromptu man would you've made, without any explanatory
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, you don't understand the doctrine of sin, otherwise you would not be making the statement you've made.
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Your outrage is nonsensical, since contextually he deplored both slavery and people trying to literally eat themselves to death.
@GregCampNC You forgot God the Holy Spirit, no I am not Jesus only, nor am I a Jew.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad No, I happen to mean all the peoples around the Jews of the Middle East!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Clarify please thank you.
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Yes, and people aren't allowed to sell cocaine, heroin, rape women, murder people, Etc.		Laws are on the books, and yet... prisons.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Old Testament righteousness came from one's actions, such has not been the case since the Cross of Christ! This is part of that dichotomy.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Not a millstone around my neck now. I am not an orthodox Jew, which means I am not bound by levitical laws. Righteousness comes from Christ
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. He never changes. This fact is why he is so reliable.		His laws have changed. Dichotomy.
@robotlemur @GregCampNC @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad That's not what I said. What I said is that my responsibilities are defined by The Ten Commandments, prophecy, and the New Covenant.
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Your ignorance of bounds! You do not understand the subject matter, which is sin, nor the scope of it, nor the depravity, you're whining!
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Ah, yes, you're pissed off because He gave human beings free will!		Atheists demand free will, but you never want the responsibility for it.
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad You're a gem among humans!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Further, I am utterly enamored of your heartfelt, Soul deep concern, for people who slaughter their own children as part of human sacrifice!
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, slavery is condemned. God simply did not want people dying of undercooked pork, shellfish in the Middle East in hundred degree Heat
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad I'm under the New Covenant, not the Old Covenant! Please note the dichotomy and try to keep up. Thank you for your support!
@GregCampNC @robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad And as usual, you fine folks in The Atheist community seem to think I'm an orthodox Jew!		Evangelical, fundamentalist, biblical, Christian.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Hey, if the girl who was raped doesn't want to be saved by the blood of Christ, and wants to end up in hell, that's her business! Free will.
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Slavery is condemned as an evil. There were laws made to regulate it, because humans would not Outlaw it. 2.5 million slaves in Islam today.
@GregCampNC @OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, slavery is a human invention, not His! Dietary laws, what came to be known as kosher, kept Jews healthier then surrounding peoples.
@robotlemur @JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad You do not want to be taught, you want to make excuses! Most atheists cannot even simply be honest! Out of context wording is atheist Forte!

@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus That would be a given.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Not as the ext. Left, or the ext. Right uses them. They are used by lazy people, incompetent people, dishonest people, by and large.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Should the person who had been raped, reach the end of their lives and die, without Jesus as their Lord and Savior, then yes, Hell.
@ShellyPass No, you don't understand the contextuality of them, nor their history, nor the dichotomy between Old Covenant and New Covenant. You er.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Further, I'm not dancing to any tune. You just don't like my responses, because you cannot address them. I'm fully expecting another meme.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus He allowed for human actions in the Old Testament because of human weakness, which is no longer allowed in the NT. Judgement is one such.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Or who are ignorant, or who understand the issues, but are utterly terrified of the facts, empirical evidence, and argumentation involved.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Memes are stereotypes. Memes are generalities. Memes do not have specificity. Memes are used by lazy people, who are either incompetent,
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Afraid of abject mindlessness? You really do go to extremes don't you? Memes are Mindless, because they are not rational responses.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus In a general context as you've outlined, the answer would be yes. The Cross of Christ, covers all sins except one.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Yes, thank you so much, for avoiding the responsibility for your own words! You don't like the context, you change it to suit your needs!
@g1rad No, I don't have that power, judging that is. You've just proven my point with complete precision! Atheist ignorance abounds!
@g1rad Oh, oh, wow, I am definitely shocked and awed by the intelligent, precise, and full explanatory, of your response! Mercy, please!
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Different Covenants. You are familiar with the term Covenant, yes? A synonym for the word 'covenant', contextually speaking, is Testament.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus And I'm not impressed with the use of mindless memes!
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, you did not say 'person'! You directed it to me, as a believer! You used the word 'you', not the word 'person'. Context matters!
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, not an evolving morality from God's Viewpoint, merely from The Human Side. We humans make all kinds of excuses, He does not.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus It has nothing whatsoever to do with verbosity! The issue is what the words mean in Context, not stand-alones as if they had no connections!
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus You don't believe in Christianity either, but you raised the issue. Why do atheists continue to raise issues in which they're incompetent?
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, I didn't. You are attempting to compare Old Testament Doctrine two new testament Doctrine, without even a scintilla of competence.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, actually I didn't. Cognizant means aware. Intelligent means the ability to process that of which one is aware. Competent implies faculty
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No they don't. Memes are not arguments, they're mindless drivel! Interested, intelligent people debate issues with words &amp; facts, not memes.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus I'm not the one doing the cherry-picking here, that would be you and your fellow atheists! You are citing scriptures U don't understand.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus If a person is a Biblical Christian he or she cannot be out murdering and raping! By their fruits shall ye know them! No murder, no rape.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Do you see contradiction in question you've posed? First half of your question has person being a Christian, the second half not!
@merricklestat @LewisDennWriter @snoflakepersist @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump No actually, Mueller is a tainted investigator and for so many reasons. His conflict of interest list is long and varied!
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Tell me, are you capable of cognizant, intelligent, competent debate, or do you just do memes?
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus No, it does not justify rape. You will note that the scripture which you have cited stipulates that it is a crime. You don't understand it.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Further, please take the time to look at the polls conducted by The Guardian newspaper in Great Britain, which is very leftist, about Islam.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus The prophet Muhammad was a self-admitted pedophile, a murderer, genocidist, torturer, rapist, and all Muslims are commanded to emulate him.
@OctopusPryme @ReligiousVirus Peter, I've studied the Qur'an for 11 years and studied the Hadith for 8 years! USC has a great online archive of all texts, free access.
@JayStephens @ReligiousVirus @g1rad The ignorance of far too many atheists abound on these aspects! None of you in this thread understand the doctrines you're condemning!
@mistersvensson @ReligiousVirus @g1rad Your ignorance of biblical Doctrine astounds me! New well and truly are ascribing to Christianity, what is part and parcel of Islam!
@ReligiousVirus @OctopusPryme Repentance is the key factor within biblical Christianity and it is unlike any other faith on planet! Biblical Christianity &amp; second chances
@ReligiousVirus @OctopusPryme You don't know doctrine at all? However, in Islam, you can rape all the women you want, murder them, NOT repent and still go to paradise!

@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 I see, so you admit that you want to ban all AR's. Why not knives, bats, crowbars, bricks? Banning them save lives if your argument is true
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Guns are safe as they'll ever be: safety is all in the person holding the gun, not the object. You can't stop criminals from getting guns.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 I'm not being insulting, and I'm not on Shaky Ground. You have not been able to refute a single point I've made empirically.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 But U and otr Left of argument don't want to ban knives, baseball bats, crowbars. One must conclude you don't care about lives lost.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 The left doesn't care about the loss of innocent life, otherwise they would be calling for Banning of knives pairing size to butcher size
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Despite the fact the five to six times more people are murdered with knives and blunt objects. But the left doesn't want to ban them.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Further, another point to the whole AR versus anything else argument is that you and many others would dearly love to ban them.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 My point is that no gun kills anyone.		People kill people, that is an undeniable fact and you can't seem to understand that point.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 They admitted their bias towards Trump during the election cycle and they've admitted it since, why don't you understand that or admit it?
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 The members of the media hated Trump's guts during the election cycle and they did everything they could to make sure he did not get elected
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 During the eight years of Obama there was no media check! The media aided and abetted him on a daily basis and they admitted it!

@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Background checks do not stop criminals from killing people! Criminals by their very occupations violate laws! They don't buy guns retail!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 What problem with the FBI crime data you've cited in your link? People use knives &amp; blunt objects to kill 6 times more people than AR's.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 No, despite your objections the New York Times willfully, and repeatedly skew stories against conservatives. They exclude information. Lies
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 What dams don't realize is that such laws would lead to a real-world bloody Civil War. 30 to 60 million gun owners would rebell and shoot!

@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 You can go to Amazon and get John Lott's book downloaded for cheap too! Or take the time to check the FBI crime data. Educate yourself!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 You didn't provide a link. The other link isn't there either. I got to go pay the water bill at the town office, but I'll be back later.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 You're using the talking points of the left perfectly, you're nt using your thought processes! Please answer my question about banning bats.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 You'll notice that I said the average American Soldier. The reason that I said that is because that is what President George Washington said
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Stop listening to propaganda of left-wing websites, the hoplophobes who play on your emotions! Read John Lott's book More Guns Less Crime.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Senator Dianne Feinstein has repeatedly stated all the way back to the 90s, that the goal is to take away all guns from all Americans!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, stated publicly to reporters just recently she wants that slippery slope to take away all arms
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 The Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno stated publicly that taking all the guns away from all the people was their goal!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Once again, I am not a member of the NRA! Please educate yourself by studying the FBI crime database, it'll open your eyes if you'll let it
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 The shooter of the congressman was a Bernie Sanders Democrat! Shooter of Gabby Giffords was a Democrat! Check out list of mass killers!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 With one exception, all of the shooters have been Democrats, and even worked on Democrat campaigns! They were on the left!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Gun free zones have gotten more people killed in the last 30 years than the most zealous right-wing Klan member could hope for!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 The bottom line is that the FBI crime data does not support your position. The Constitution does not support your position.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Armed to an American government Soldier. You can look it up, and read his very own words, I am not making this stuff up!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Read what President George Washington had to say on individuals owning guns! He stated that the average American citizen had to be equally
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 What part of the phrase shall not be infringed, are you not understanding? Take the time to read President John Adams writings on this issue
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 What I believe is empirically based, factual, real world stats, not emotion! This is why I use the FBI crime data stats to know the truth!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 They're not profiting from me, I am not an NRA member and I haven't been for two decades! I don't belong to any gun organization!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 No NRA numbers, no Gun Owners of America numbers, no pro-gun anything, just straightforward crime stats from the FBI, Obama's FBI no less!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 No, it's not marketing. That is why I specifically said you need to check FBI crime database online and study the numbers for yourself!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Further, numbers are not on yr side relating Deaths w/ guns! Do you want the ban bats, crowbars, Etc more people killed with them than guns.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Even if that were true, it doesn't matter. Neither you nor any other hoplophobe has the right to strip me of my constitutional rights.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 The left continues to Champion individual rights to choice! Well and good, you don't want a handgun, then don't own one. Simple and easy
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Your fears, unreasonable fears in my view, do not supersede my constitutional right to protect myself, to protect my family.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Except of course for that Troublesome constitutional thing! Handguns are used to hunt as well but that's beside the point! The bottom line:
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 When Muslim terrorists commit mass murder, the Left never blame all Muslims, someone commits crime w/ gun Left says all gun owners guilty!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 2/3 of all deaths related to guns in any year are by Suicide! You cannot stop people determined to kill themselves!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 FBI crime data from Obama years stipulate more people murdered with bats, crowbars, then with all rifles combined in any year!
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 Further, take a good long look at the numbers that the FBI has pertaining to all sorts of murders committed with weapons.
@MikeMachanic @essenviews @ddmocca @DarciaH3 I would suggest that you take some time, a lot of time, and look at the FBI crime data pertaining to crimes committed with guns.

@helloiambear @mkhammer I see, so you've convicted the man with no evidence provided to you. Lynch mobs operate on the same Paradigm you're using! Rule of law!
@helloiambear @mkhammer It's the same subject matter, I'm sorry you're not either capable, or willing to see that they are directly linked! Accusations r not proof

@justjudee @mkhammer You don't want to trial, because that would require evidence, proof in real-world terms O'Reilly was actually guilty of the accusations!
@justjudee @mkhammer You're making my point for me again! Look at the last part of your statement, you believe that he's guilty, without any confirmed evidence
@mkhammer @justjudee Once again, confirmed evidence, payment stubs, receipts, statements by either his lawyers, or by Fox News lawyers? Misandry is not pretty.

@Juliess31 @nyyssny @emilysteel @WhiskeyMD247365 @nytmike Your own words. You believe that he's guilty, without confirmed evidence, without a trial, without any rules! You believe in public lynching

@JewhadiTM The jihadist is being both truthful, and doctrinally accurate!		What a Pity that the members of the mainstream media are so ignorant!
@JudicialWatch Lois Lerner and Koskinen will never be touched: the rule of law no longer exists at the federal level.		 Little people required 2 obey laws.
@molratty You know for a fact that the left is logically impaired, empirically impaired, and factually impaired.		Asking tsuch questions never works
@molratty You're asking people on the left to engage with little gray matter they might actually still have operating, to consider things logically.
