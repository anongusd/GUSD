@themgill I will support legislative action that would make this possible. Treating and caring for my patients is a priority. Current scientific studies have shown the benefits of this drug in treating many types of disorders. It would be negligent not to support further research.
@themgill These benefits must be studied against potential adverse effects such as any effects to brain and lungs. It would also be beneficial to the scientific community to reclassify this drug from its current schedule 1 status which would also provide vet's access for medical purposes.
@themgill Additional research is necessary to explore how this drug currently treats patients and what can be accomplished in the future. There have been groundbreaking studies in treatments of PTSD, epilepsy, seizures, pain management, and narcotic replacements.

I would like the constituents of #FL01 to know that Gaetz consciously skipped working to earn the votes of Republicans and Democrats again to follow DeSantis around Florida. He does not care about your voice or your vote; if he did, he would be here.

We live in #FL01, a district full of coastal cities, and the concerns we have are real. I showed up like I always have. I am committed to a clean and safe environment. A vote for me is a vote for the future! #TogetherWeRise #VoteGreenNotGreed #SendTheGoodDoctorToTheHouse https://t.co/Ncy69EH1Ua
How unsettling that a sitting Congressman would miss an event discussing the importance of sea level rise &amp; #climatechange; he did not even provide a statement informing us he would not be attending. Instead, he went to a Florida gubernatorial debate at @BrowardCollege in Davie.
Unfortunately, even after proper planning on their end and concerned constituents packing the house, he did not show. Many of you may be angry, many of you may not care for him, but I know many of you are still disappointed. https://t.co/aaXdTEDA4o

On February 15, there was nothing to fill the emptiness but a string of tough questions. Why? How? And, perhaps most inescapable: What now?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe morning of February 14, 2018, 14 promising young students and three dedicated educators walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as everyday Americans; they were carried out as victims of a tragedy of unimaginable proportions.

Bullying is never okay, we must never make excuses for it. Many of us have been lucky enough to have survived childhood bullying, but it can have long lasting effects. We must end the cycle and have a community discussion.
As a Pediatrician and a mother, the loss of Joey has been very difficult for me. Several people have told me they knew him, and have shared their sadness with me. This has had an effect on other children and our community. This has raised questions that must be answered.

I wanted to take a moment to wish my family and friends a blessed Rosh Hashanah. Rosh Hashanah, which translates to ‚ÄúHead of the Year,‚Äù is a time for reflection, a time to look forward to what we might do better in the coming year, as it marks the Jewish New Year.

Today, your broken bones and tired body will no longer ache...for the LORD WILL GIVE YOU REST. I salute you Mr. McCain!
Though I disagreed with some of his beliefs, I pay respect to the man who had the courage to give his then opponent, Mr. Obama, the dignity of the truth and the compassion to save healthcare coverage to millions of Americans.
While the sitting president was enjoying his country club living with bone spurs, this war hero was being tortured at the Hanoi Hilton for several years.
Senator McCain could have stayed home during the Vietnam War. Instead, he volunteered to fight alongside his fellow Americans. He once said that he learned how much he loved his country while captured in another country. https://t.co/A9ugemhven

Beto has put into words the exact reasons that I felt compelled to run. This my non-violent protest to the inequalities, incompetence, greed, and corruption that has permeated our present society and levels of government.
To my fellow Democrats,	Voting has already began for the primaries and while a small number have already cast their ballots, there is still a large portion of #FL01 who have not. I came across this video of an excellent answer to a controversial question.

I've always looked out for and listened to the needs of the disadvantaged in our community. I can unite people of different backgrounds, as I have Republican patients switching to Democrats just to vote for me; that doesn't describe someone who is dividing anyone.
Female Dem candidates are winning primaries. This is what we've been desperately asking for; more representation. Our time is now. As a mother of 3, immigrant, wife, doctor w/ a scientific background, &amp; 20 years running a business, I will bring a different perspective for #FL01.
No matter what the circumstances are, our country has inflicted suffering to these  families and as Americans, we must send a clear message that we do not agree with cruel policies. Let‚Äôs unite as a country, let‚Äôs unite these families together!
As a pediatrician, I know that the most rapid rate of brain development occurs in the first three years of life and that children suffer long term effects of trauma leading to serious psychological problems in adulthood.
As a mother of 3 children, I cannot imagine the despair of being separated from them for any period of time without knowing if they are safe, well fed or free from pain or fear. #FamiliesBelongTogether  #WhereAreTheChildren https://t.co/comiuSuc0O

This unnecessary action is going to end up costing all of us more in clean up time for Walton Co, not to mention lost revenue for the area once visitors figure out they aren't welcome either. #standyoursand #CustomaryUse #KeepPublicLandsPublic #NoOneOwnstheBeach
We need a balance btw respecting homeowners' privacy w/ a reasonable compromise so crews can maintain the beauty of the beach, keep it clean &amp; safe for wildlife, and provide the access so we can all enjoy this area.
An unintended consequence of the new law removing #CustomaryUse in Walton Co is that they're unable to provide beach clean-up services for those areas &amp; now finding it difficult to reach public areas.

This process of breaking apart families and tossing children into the closest facility or even losing track of them is, without a doubt, cruel and irresponsible.		Photo by Edgard Garrido
The zero-tolerance policy is resulting in inhumane treatment of migrant children and parents.  I believe that we should treat all humans with respect and dignity.
As of last month, the US Health &amp; Human Services Department was holding 10,773 migrant children, forcibly separated from their parents while crossing the border.  While their parents are awaiting criminal prosecution, these children are housed in 100 shelters in 14 states. https://t.co/2HyAty5tdT

It was a bad idea then, and it‚Äôs a bad idea now.  We have many LGBTQ folks working in our camp. Just like you do at school, work, businesses‚Ä¶..everywhere.  We can't discriminate them away, and we should show more love and acceptance than intolerance and hate.
Discrimination hasn‚Äôt worked in the past, as we remember folks that sat at lunch counters because they were told a business could keep them from it. It is a reminder that some people in this country still consider some folks the ‚Äúother‚Äù and that they don‚Äôt belong.
Even though the Supreme Court ruling for the baker in Colorado was very narrow and did not set precedent for other states to discriminate against LGBTQ folks (as there are conflicting LGBTQ protection laws and religious freedom laws in the state), it was also very disappointing.
To commemorate the Stonewall Riots in June 1969, this month was chosen as Gay Pride Month.  It is a time to celebrate and recognize the impact that LGBTQ people have in our lives and the wonderful diversity they contribute to our society and country.

And then I realized. It was on me. It was on those asking questions, challenging those in power. It is on all of us to be the change we seek. On that night in February, I begged the incumbent, as pediatrician, as a wife, as a mother, as an immigrant, as an American.
But the stories I heard in the privacy of my practice didn't stop. Things may have seemed better on the outside, but inside? Republican. Democrat. Black. White. People were scared and they were hurting. Where was our representative? Where were the ones to allay our fears?
I spoke on behalf of those who lived in fear of having to choose between healthcare and putting food on the table. I took a chance to tell my story and the countless stories that I have heard from constituents in District 1. And then I went home.
On February 23rd, 2017, I found my voice at Oops Alley, where I told the story not only of my family's struggle with the healthcare system, but I also spoke for those in the District who could not speak for themselves. https://t.co/vIV7F6mlss

We are in the process of creating marketing materials, seeking headquarters, planning rallies, attending meetings and speaking with groups all across FL-01 spreading the word, collecting candidate qualifying petitions, etc.
Dr. Z has cared for children &amp; families in FL's 1st Congressional District for 2 decades. The campaign is in need of funding for varied and essential tools necessary to compete in this critical election process. Please consider donating to the campaign by visiting our website.
We stand at the threshold together with an opportunity to elect a leader who is committed to Health Care for ALL, Strengthening Public Education, Protecting the Environment and Comprehensive Gun Reform. This leader is Dr. Jennifer Zimmerman.  (Website: https://t.co/CCk6UcLHdf.)
Join us at the March for our Lives in Fort Walton and demand that your representatives in government fight for the lives of our children.		https://t.co/Zt6L4te70p
As time wears on and our cries for change go ignored by our representatives in government, our children continue to go to school fearful they will not come home.  They are afraid that their school will be next.  We must take action.
Grateful for the swift &amp; brave actions of the armed deputy that stepped in and subdued the gunman.  As the world prepares to march for common sense gun reform on Sat, March 24th, Great Mills High School is yet another example of why we need the changes the students are demanding.
Statement from Dr. Z on today's shooting at Great Mills High School in Maryland. #NeverAgain. Again.		"Today, a seventeen-year-old student walked into Great Mills High School in Maryland armed with a handgun and shot two students, one of whom he had a prior relationship with..."

Dr. Z wants to take action to help Puerto Rico and ask that everyone please share this post to encourage others to contact their elected officials today and demand they help the people of Puerto Rico. Use the link below to find your representatives. 		https://t.co/dNc0z9oJBw
Puerto Rico - 6 mos after Maria hit &gt;30,000 ppl still w/o clean water &amp; over 100,000 are w/o electricity. Progress made in restoring power &amp; getting access to clean water, but job not done yet. Congress must act quickly as 2018 Atlantic hurricane season is about to start.

4 hours of numbness and working in a daze, providing healthcare to other people's children while awaiting word from my own. There are moments when I question if what I'm doing is even worth it but TODAY, I know the answer. YES! It is always worth the fight to save human lives.

I believe that the American people believe in common sense gun laws. I would like to be the voice to bring that message to Congress. Healthcare professionals need to be involved, not the NRA. ~Z		For those who are wondering what you can do after yesterday's senseless tragedy:
@Beachchk @PhilEhr @mattgaetz I believe that most Americans agree with common sense gun laws and I can be that voice in Congress that brings that message. We need to involve healthcare professionals, not the NRA.
@Beachchk @PhilEhr @mattgaetz I believe that common sense gun laws should prevail and strictly implemented; that‚Äôs why I support and participate in the activities of Moms Demand Action. Respect the right to bear arms but not at the expense of safety of each citizen, especially the children.
I hope you hear this mother‚Äôs plea	Act now and change the policy.	We can talk, we can pray	But we all must live another day!
No, we can‚Äôt! We must fight!	All lives matter...‚Äôit‚Äôs not right.	The mind plays tricks when it‚Äôs not well	Rage! Rage! Rage! The voices tell.	We can‚Äôt lose hope, he needs to heal	Reach out , for love he must feel
Thoughts and prayers they‚Äôll all say,	A moment of silence, tears to wipe away.	Talk, talk, talk but who is listening,	Bang! Bang! Bang! The blood is trickling.	Are we that numb, callous and cold	That we worship the bullet wrapped in gold.

Today begins a new chapter in my life. I have officially filed as a candidate for Congressional District 1. We can no longer be silent as the democratic principles we believe in are being eroded by forces that seek to divide us as a nation.
