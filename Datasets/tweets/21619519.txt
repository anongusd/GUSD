@dcherring Howard is a wildcard as an independent. Running as an independent is a moonshot.
11. Terry McAuliffe is always underestimated but will work nonstop, can raise money, and is looking Jeffersonian these days compared to his successor and everyone else in Virginia politics.  A long shot but people I talk to believe he would do best one-on-one in a Trump smackdown
9. Sherrod Brown would be the conscience of the progressive wing and wins big in Ohio. A long shot for the top slot but already has to be on the shortlist for anyone‚Äôs VP pick. 	10. Steve Bullock wins in Trump Country, is articulate and likeable. But he needs money and Name ID.
7. Booker, Castro and Gillibrand are longer shots because their running lanes are crowded. But you never know if someone knows how to play the game until they climb on the mound the first time. 	8. John Kerry could win it all if he ran. But many think he won‚Äôt.
5. If she runs, Amy Klobuchar will provide the greatest contrast to a Donald Trump in terms of temperament. She‚Äôs from the critical Upper Midwest and could also do well in Iowa. 	6. Beto lost and has acted strange lately but is adored by many. But he ain‚Äôt running against Cruz.
3. Warren is facing a rough patch right now but if you wanted to pick a populist candidate naturally positioned to win Iowa and take next-door New Hampshire, it‚Äôs her. 	4. Biden and Bernie are strong in the polls but I think they overstate their dominance like most early polls do
1. Medicare For All will not be a litmus test. Too difficult to defend on many fronts. The way forward is making Obamacare work. Mend, don‚Äôt end. 	2.

But Churchill‚Äôs determination and Britain‚Äôs resilience provided America and our allies the beachhead to liberate Western Europe and combine our efforts with Russia to crush Hitler. By the end of the war, Britain was a spent superpower. But Churchill is celebrated for 1940.
D-Day would have likely come much later than June 6, 1944 had Germans forced not been bled dry on the Eastern Front. Without Russia, America‚Äôs victory over Hitler would have come later and at a much higher price.
I would argue that the United States made the more significant contribution but the losses inflicted on Germany by the Soviets in WWII were staggering. The Russians also payed a terrible price not recognized often enough in the West. As many as 30 million Russians died in WWII.
Hitler‚Äôs invasion of Russia in June 1941 and Japan‚Äôs attack on Pearl Harbor doomed the Nazis. Your question about whether Britain or Russia contributed more to Hitler‚Äôs defeat is the wrong question. The correct one is whether the US or USSR contributed more to Hitler‚Äôs demise.
Churchill‚Äôs contribution came in the darkest days of 1940 when Britain stood alone vs. Hitler‚Äôs Europe. Stalin had already signed a treaty with Hitler and the US refused to fight. During the Battle of Britain that year, Churchill saved civilization. https://t.co/r3B3DoXHeg

RT @CharlesPPierce: @JoeNBC It is, indeed, a good long-playing record.
@DavidPriess @RadioFreeTom @dcherring McCartney was pushed creatively by Wilson. We have Sgt Pepper because of McCartney‚Äôs drive to outdo Pet Sounds. Dylan introduced the Beatles to pot, folk and the drive to dig deeper on lyrics. Both Wilson and Dylan moved them toward Rubber Soul, Pepper and an extraordinary run.

@RadioFreeTom Some bands survived the initial chill of rock snobbery. Zeppelin is the greatest example. But Boston was forever kept in their corner. Doesn‚Äôt matter. They made magic for millions of fans and that actually matters.
@dcherring @RadioFreeTom Oh man. I thought I was the only guy left alive with a musical crush on Marshall Crenshaw. Cynical Girl, Maryanne, Whenever You‚Äôre on My Mind got as many plays in my car in the 80s as anything else. Loved his music.
@RadioFreeTom Just listen to the record, as they said. ‚ÄúDancing in the streets of Hyannis‚Äù is a line that still makes me smile years later.
@RadioFreeTom @dcherring Dude, what do you like? Hotel California is remarkable. The Last Resort, Wasted Time, Pretty Maids All in a Row, Try and Love Again. Chew on your nails. I‚Äôll keep play the Eagles and those Dylan albums you loathe.
@CharlesPPierce @RadioFreeTom @dcherring @morningmika @emilie_hoffer Pretty Vacant, Bodies, Holiday in the Sun, Anarchy in the UK. Leads to the Clash, Elvis Costello, everything that follows in the UK.
@RadioFreeTom Much respect for breaking out BOSTON while wearing your baby blue tux. Rock snobs will never give it any respect but it was a helluva debut album. Solid State madness, great harmonies and production so slick it made the Carpenters sound like Black Flag.
@RadioFreeTom @dcherring You lost 1,000 point with that Sex Pistols putdown. Like the Eagles encapsulated LA in 75, Nirvana and Seattle in 91, the Sex Pistols were London in their time. They also blew apart the bloated 70s rock scene and then themselves. Bodies‚Äô bridge remains rock‚Äôs most primal moment.
@RadioFreeTom @dcherring Oh man. A Rutles reference. 	50 bonus points.
@dcherring @CharlesPPierce @morningmika @emilie_hoffer Thanks. I‚Äôm with you. Dark Side of the Moon should be on the list but then again so should Highway 61 Revisited and Blood On the Tracks. What‚Äôs Going On, every Stevie album from 1971 to 1975, etc etc.
@RadioFreeTom @dcherring Pet Sounds is extraordinary but Endless Summer was my first album. I was blown away by Brian Wilson‚Äôs early songwriting. Pet Sounds is the man at his artistic peak in ‚Äò66. But both of those albums exclude his greatest work: Good Vibrations. Still breathtaking 50 yrs on.
@CharlesPPierce @dcherring @morningmika @emilie_hoffer This, of course, leaves off great albums from Led Zeppelin‚Äôs ‚ÄúHouses‚Äù to Elton‚Äôs ‚ÄúMadman‚Äù to Buddy Holly‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreatest‚Äù to Nirvana‚Äôs ‚ÄúNevermind‚Äù to U2s ‚ÄúJoshua Tree‚Äù to Carole King‚Äôs ‚ÄúTapestry‚Äù.

What is the GOP afraid of? 	If Kavanaugh‚Äôs accusers are not telling the truth, give them the FBI investigation they are asking for and put them under oath. 	If they lie, they go to jail. 	Again, why are Republicans scared of an FBI investigation?
For weeks, Kavanagh defenders have been blasting his accuser as a confused woman, a fabulist and a liberal activist who is lying for political reasons. If this were true, why would they not be calling for an FBI investigation to out her as a liar? The same goes for Ramirez.
These incidents should be investigated by the FBI like Bush41 ordered the FBI to investigate Clarance Thomas and Anita Hill. Americans need facts. 	If Kavanaugh‚Äôs defenders are correct, the speedy investigation will help their nominee.
The Times quotes show another accusation against Kavanaugh that may show a pattern of behavior or a pattern of accusations. Anyone calling him an ‚Äúattempted rapist‚Äù or a ‚Äúserial sex abuser‚Äù at this point is shameful. Those attacking thes accusers are equally reprehensible. #FBI

If it were like baseball where it‚Äôs understood that arguing balls and strikes gets you thrown out, then yesterday would be understandable. But that‚Äôs not the history of this sport.
When you‚Äôre in the final of the US Open, give warnings before penalizing a player for (1) doing something every other player does and (2) verbal abuse. To take away a game before repeatedly warning a player seems like a stretch given the history of tennis.
