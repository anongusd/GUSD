@WilliamPollack2 @larryelder @Chicago_Police @RobinRoberts Your a proud old creep. Not a capitalist. Your a low life broadcaster who I am sure won't tell me where I can call your superior or where you work so people can know what you do with your time. Don't have any kids? Lonely loser? Must have something better to do than this right?
@WilliamPollack2 @larryelder @Chicago_Police @RobinRoberts Old creep. I am a Democrat and have brown skin. I have my masters degree in business administration and have worked at my my job doing what I love for 5 years. (Not as old as you). I owe no explanation to a washed up Delusional old creep. Get out of your foxnews bubble.
@WilliamPollack2 @larryelder @Chicago_Police @RobinRoberts Typical right wing ignorant statements. So let me guess tough guy because I am brown skinned you must think I live on welfare, and live off the gov right? Is that what this broadcaster who clearly traffics in stereotypes believes? Because I'm a Democrat and brown right?
@WilliamPollack2 @larryelder @Chicago_Police @RobinRoberts Lol your a Nut. Scare me? Noone cares what you are or believe what's funny is your an old creep and seem to lack self control and act more petty and immature then most 17 yr olds do on here or any social media platform. You are exhibit A why old dopes like you should stay off SM.
@WilliamPollack2 @larryelder @Chicago_Police @RobinRoberts Age discriminate lol really?		Nice try.		Stick to broadcasting.		If the best you can do is age discrimination compared to the garbage you spew on your TL then I think I'm in good hands.		Where do you broadcast?
@WilliamPollack2 @larryelder @Chicago_Police @RobinRoberts Stick to broadcasting creepy Willy.

@MikePrattPhotos Point is buddy you are getting your panties all in bunch over one part of her covering Kamala. One part lol. Did you go back and read her Twitter TL?  Doubt it. So she's suppose to shut off the camera when people start laughing and acting like human beings??		Lol pathetic.

@cooway @CHueyBurns @KamalaHarris SMH says the guy who retweets garbage from Brit Hume. Lol. You don't like Leftys like Kamala Harris but you spend your Saturday afternoon apparently with nothing else to do stalking her every move??		Lol if you don't like her why so mad?		Scared she might be trump. Probably.
@jeannie_mcn @CHueyBurns @KamalaHarris And what's worse is you having no life on Saturday other than to tweet out your obsession with stalking Kamala Harris lol
@Billy_Purcell @CHueyBurns @KamalaHarris So funny how people don't like Harris but will spend their Saturday afternoon stalking her every move just to give their ignorant two sense lol. Must be they have no life.
@TaxRehab @CHueyBurns @KamalaHarris I know right. So embarrassed Sean hanity would get on stage with our president and give him 3 hugs in a row.

@Joe_Magarac @rachbarnhart You do your job without flaws? Should I scrutinize the every smallest and meaningless aspect of you via your job? Or should I judge you based on your overall work. Learn about politics. Get off of Twitter and off your ass from watching TV and go read books, read go learn. Plz.
@Joe_Magarac @rachbarnhart It's an issue when someone wins Majority of the votes from people and still loses. Again, if you can't comprehend this then you really serve no purpose nor have any business talking about Political campaigns and Politics writ large. You vote based on a video? Read some books. Plz
@Joe_Magarac @rachbarnhart Noone is putting their heads in the sand dummy. If you vote based on a video then you got bigger issues than I think you realize. You don't understand, Politics. Citing the Electoral College is not being naive nor disregarding to the issue the dem party faces.
@xmaddisonmoorex Welcome 😘👍		Follow me back please.
@Joe_Magarac @rachbarnhart No. He was the beneficiary of the Electoral College not the beneficiary of majority of the votes from majority of the American people. Dems should and can do better but first we need the folks to be better informed. Warren has a lot of $ now because she worked for 40 yrs. Fact.
@rachbarnhart Sorry I was kind to you. Guess you desvered the nasty things. Your not a very nice person. And very stubborn and think you posses some special powers and know with certaintity why or how someone wins the Presidency. Their will be great genuine candidates on the dems side.
@rachbarnhart Sorry that I genuinely asked for context and clarification. Not sure on how you take what happened with a news anchor and decipher that that's how or why someone will win the presidency. That's not funny I think it's sad you even think that and nutty.
@rachbarnhart I supported you &amp; still do when a ton of other people attacked u. So not sure why u feel it necessary to be rude. Maybe it's true. Your not a very nice person. Sad. Sad your like that. Your statement was not very specific. All you said was anyone else think trumps gonna win again
@rachbarnhart What about 2020?
@rachbarnhart Not being fesicious but when you said win what did you mean? Win what?		What did he win last week?		My friends mother gets SNAP benefits and if gov is sto shutdown she won't get that. How is that a win for him?		Political &amp;  Moral mistake, yes.		All the conservative judges = win.
@Joe_Magarac @rachbarnhart Yep. And a former game show host from Queens who shits on a gold toilet is definitely relateable to me a blue collar middle class worker.
@rachbarnhart Was this a serious tweet?		Win what?		Does he have a strong base. Yes. I guess.		Re-election is out of the question---politically that's all that should matter so not sure what would be relevant to a "win".
@amyomeara428 @MuslimIQ Thank you. I will wish I could say the same for you. Unlike you I don't think your statement was funny. And neither would if your daughter got knocked out. Do better. Think. I know its hard for you but think before you tweet. 😘
@amyomeara428 @MuslimIQ Good. I am glad you realize their is no justification to knock out a child. None. So maybe next time don't make your statement suggest you wanna have it both ways. Want an example if how you do this? Ok. "The man was wrong. Period." Got that? Have a good night mixed up lady.
@amyomeara428 @MuslimIQ Lol your retarded. So shoving a man who is double your size and weight is justification for knocking out an a 12 yr old girl. You think she really hurt him with that shove?		Your racism is showing. I so just shut your mouth and go bake some cookies or something.

You said it just so happens that the most qualified for the jobs happen to be white. The main point of his statement was these white coaches are in fact not the most qualified.
@rachbarnhart @fictionfree Don't let them get to you @rachbarnhart all they do is sit on their asses and run their mouths. Their cowards compared to you. You at least ran for office, take on challenges and put yourself out their to be tested. All they do is bitch like immature boys or girls. Don't give in.

@rachbarnhart @CynicalMother "Their would be no outrage". So "we"  white folk, if hearing a racist word would not be outraged and basically not speak out but remain silent. Racism is a lot like sexual harrasment it's wrong, period, and yet so many are too coawridce or ignorant themselves to say anything.

@ingodwetryst True. It is a vicious cycle.
@ingodwetryst All fights for rights/protections of already granted rights cost something. I think theirs more support for SW's than you realize or you have allowed yourself to realize. I am not a SW lol, just a middle class worker who listens to other POV and sometimes supports it, like SW's.
@ingodwetryst Your voice, time &amp; Yes God forbid even money. Paying it forward for the next women who wants to be in the business. I don't want you to think this is directed entirely to you. I have read about the work you have done. You clearly have done a lot for the industry with your ⌚&amp; 💵
@ingodwetryst I would think the victims fellow SW friends would have time. Time for political engagement to fight for the lives of those who died and that their names werent lost in vain. Sorry. Seems cold.
@ingodwetryst Precisely my point. If women actually died due to the increase of criminalization and shutting down sites then wouldn't your objective be change and the broader spectrum of the public. Sorry but with all respect that's ass backwards. More 💵 Correlates to less SW's dying?
@ingodwetryst I support SW's because I am a business man first/also for basic human rights. I wish my state NY would legalize the business. I am a voter. I would vote for SW's rights candidates etc. I am simply saying to all provideds every movement had to sacrifice. Make strategic decisions.
@ingodwetryst Your making an argument that's not even what I am talking about. I am not making the argument to prevent SW's from making the money they want. Just because I want more money for my job doesn't mean it's economical for my business. I can afford a highend provider. Not everyone can
@ingodwetryst Not an emotional etc. And again, the main point of question is with broader perception how do you get more people to support efforts such as repealing SESTA/FOSTA If you only agree or 'like' and what those in the SW bubble say or think. SW's will need broader support.
@ingodwetryst Your missing the point. Prices have gone up for everything these days etc. of course. And of course THEIR will always be providers for every income bracket. But like ANY small businesses just because you Can raise prices doesn't mean you Should. It has to be a business choice...
@ingodwetryst I don't think SW's should take a 'pay cut' either. However, with a perception of greed it will be hard to get political/other support etc. Outside of the SW bubble or circle. If hiring a provider becomes an *exclusive* thing for a few. Where does the clout for change come from?
@Crystalphilly Untie for sure.

@bluemachine3928 @Dwerc @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora The ALTERNATIVE IS WATCH WHAT YOU SAY OVER PHONE/WHAT YOU WRITE THROUGH ANY ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION, BE MINDFUL OF WHAT A CLIENT IS SAYING/WRITING. USE OF FOREIGN SERVERS ETC. IS ONLY RESOURCEFUL FOR ADVERTISING. LASTLY, DON'T BE CHEAP SET ASIDE 💵 FOR AN IN EMERGENCY ATTORNEY.
@bluemachine3928 @Dwerc @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚃ U. S. LE does not need Swiss permission to take a picture of criminal activity on their applications. All the encryption does is put the activity in the dark and using a Swiss server jjst eliminates the sensory or *monitoring of activity through their technology, be safe. End.
@bluemachine3928 @Dwerc @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚂ Where is the providers means of Communication purchased? In the U. S. or in Switzerland? Does Federal Law permit a search, excluding any obvious 5A privileges, to someone who is being investigated for Prostitution or Tax Evasion? Remember, the provider is a citizen in the U.S.
@bluemachine3928 @Dwerc @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚁...they are using a foreign internet server doesn't mean the provider is safe from Criminal exposure to U. S. LAWS. Again&lt;&lt; It doesn't matter what instrument you use. The providers or clients words (in text or spoken) can be incriminating to varying degrees.
@bluemachine3928 @Dwerc @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚀ I understand your point of the Swiss, compliance, International Criminal Law Enforcement etc. Your not understanding, your confusing yourself and confusing the overall point. One should not, EVER, bank on the fact that because their using encrypted communications or because...
@bluemachine3928 @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚂ My advice. Be careful what you write or say and be careful what the client does or says. And might be wise to set aside some money for an Attorney. Remember* an attorney can not give counsel or advice with any respect to criminal acts but can make clear to you what the law is.
@bluemachine3928 @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚁ E. G. If a *undercover agent (federal)  or undercovered officer (state) screen shots or takes a picture of all the correspondence between person A (The Provider)  and person B (LE) is then exchange of money, and they have the evidence for most likely a case conviction.
@bluemachine3928 @pornlaw @_taylorsims @lennox_aurora ⚀ Not the point. If LE is building a case for criminal prosecution their are many ways they can and will build a case. Not just based on *email*. You can do all your *work* through foreign companies won't matter. It's not just instruments of communication its the communication..
@pornlaw @JRoll555 SW's and others in the industry need to start doing some grassroots work and also get A LOT of money 💵 and to hire Lawyers to begin the long process of litigation. More importantly I'd argue tho is hiring more Lobbyists and local support. Doubt USSC would take up the case.

@KatMcKinley 2/ Your parents must not of taught you very well. You act more immature and disgusting than I do lady. And I am half your age. You set a very poor example not just for the Christian folks but non believers. Its ppl like you who make christianity seem pointless and horrible.
@KatMcKinley 1/ My mom did teach me good. Lots of great things. I am NOT a Christian to my moms disappointment. I chose for myself what I believe. But what's clear to me is I act the same if not better than people who do advertise their self proclamation or christianity.
@KatMcKinley Again. Go back a re-read scripture. God does not like someone being Prideful or a Fool. My mom is a good, respectable Christian. You are a fake. But seems a lot of deplorables are like that. White trash hypocrites. It's so embarrassing.
@KatMcKinley Saying "Liberal Journalists didnt or *dont* care about Syria is NOT Compassionate nor even a respectable statement. If you care...fake Christian lady about &gt;PEOPLE&lt; &gt;ALL PEOPLE&lt; then you wouldn't spew garbage out of both sides of your mouth. Go back old lady &amp; re-read scripture.

@KatMcKinley No. I dont care what side your on. Your not on Gods side. Your on the side of criminals (trump) and adulterers.		Like I said before you go to bed read some scripture and ask God to forgive you. Get off Twitter. Act your age. Stop embarrassing your family. Go cook or something.
@KatMcKinley This is a tweet from a lady with a big heart ?? 		No. A tweet from an old lady who  weds to act her age and vet off Twitter and go do some good  before she dies instead of being petty and acting like a 20 yr old. Did you  mute me yet cause your a coward and intolerant?m
@KatMcKinley No old lady. You do not have a big heart. You have a heart of blackness. Shame on you. You retweet racist and disgusting garbage. Go read scripture and ask God for forgiveness. You are setting a poor example as an adult and should know better. I am not a troll. Nice try

@KatMcKinley "Compassionate conservative".		I went to a catholic private school in elmira, New York from pre-K to 8th grade. Raised and baptized in the church.		Compassion doesn't mean only do it to people you feel "comfortable around" it means have a heart. You dont act like a Christian lady

@Crystalphilly Not all young guys are Immature, Broke, or Ill mannered. It is disappointing for me to see this. I am none of these things but I see my age is pre judged. SW's should practice what they preach.
@Crystalphilly SW's are Organizing/Protesting/Voting etc. to become more engaged ever since the passage of the New Law SESTA/FOSTA. Claiming it forced Companies to by Law discriminate&lt;&lt;&lt; against SW's, among other things. Its hypocritical to then turn around and discriminate based on age.
@Crystalphilly .@Crystalphilly  I think any reasonable person, no matter the age, can agree that this guys manners, or lack thereof, are pretty disgusting. When you then justify one person's actions to age discriminate I think it's poorly reflective of your thinking &amp; also hypocritical to say.

Women shouldn't just get to use a genuine good cause for their own gain just because their women. If you had sons and not daughters and a lick of truth in you. You clearly would understand what I said.
@1001plusblog @danielleiat Your a horrible father and husband then if your so much of a pushover you can't tell your daughter or your wife when their wrong because your afraid of being attacked for " telling a women what to do ". Your useless to them cheif. Get off Twitter your too old for it.
@cooperhill @danielleiat Heyy their! Glad you speak for all men.	'It's weak, sir" is something men say to make themselves feel better or be in a better light.
@danielleiat Lol yeah I don't want my mom my two sisters and two 4 and 5 yr old nieces to have rights. You hurt women more than you help them and that's what so shameful about you. Get over yourself. It's not about you. It's about the greater good. Your statements speak for themselves. Sad.
@danielleiat But that's not what your thread is about and it's not how it is being used by others. Duh duh		"Here's what a women says about cuomo" is literally what I just read when someone cited your tweet.		Maybe you should make that distinction more clear.
@1001plusblog @danielleiat You have a wife and daughter right dumbass?		Did I get that right?		And you would have people on Twitter believe you NEVER told your wife or daughters when their wrong about something that their wrong or that something they said is stupid or a bad look?		Right. Lol pathetic
@1001plusblog @danielleiat Lol you must have no friends. People tell each other their wrong every day dumbass. Lol what does gender have to do with telling someone they make no sense and are wrong??		Heard that one before.
@burtonphillips @danielleiat Yep Tommy. Will get right on it. LOL
@LissomeLight @danielleiat Please show me how you know what she speaks of is true. You don't. You sir shut up and sit down. Or chief you can show me the evidence that points to me statement being factually wrong. You don't have it do you dummy ??
@danielleiat Again you obviously are very prideful and stubborn and horrible and deceitful because your saying things or implying things I never said or implied. I didn't say most women want you to shut up.i said most women don't appreciate the politicization other women do. You make no sense
@danielleiat Never once claimed I am a feminist.	If being closer to women because of how I was raised, when it wasn't my choice to be fatherless makes me a feminist, cool. I don't claim to be anything. I don't live in a bubble. Not all women, appreciate the politicization of the #MeToo
@danielleiat The truth is Cuomo has how many daughters??? a mother himself.		You really think he is a protector of a serial predator like Weinstein?		Your statement tells me how disgusting you are for making such a serious and sad issue political.		You don't think you could work w. Cuomo?
@danielleiat I grew up with all women. Single parent mom. Two of my adopted sisters now I have 2 nieces. No dad. Most women don't like when other women especially survivors of rape or sexual misconduct of any form spend more time writing stuff on Twitter for their own egos and politics.
@rachbarnhart And what does this have to do with the issues that upstate folks like myself care about ??		My party is dumb.		So when Cuomo is re-elected everyone is gonna blame the "Democrat Machine", instead of all the time they wasted bickering.. sad.
@spoonman @rachbarnhart Majority when it comes down to it won't get rid if the two party system. Not yet anyways. These are the voters themselves not the "party bosses" or the '"Democratic machine". The voters have a responsibility to themselves and this country. On them. Simple as that.
@spoonman @rachbarnhart 2/  dems suck at being effective salesman &amp; politicians when it matters i.e. &gt;Elections&lt; and when speaking with or to the public in any forum. We have the Good policies months good politics and repubs d that's why candidates like Barnhart whom I like, and Teachout lose every time
@spoonman @rachbarnhart 1/ Of course. Problem is people make the politics more complicated than the policy. Americans unfortunately but consistently vote against their own interests. Majority of voters have notjinfnin common with this Republican pres, Congress and neo-con media and yet they always win.
@spoonman @rachbarnhart Agree. It's all good until it isn't.
@GeoffMiami Shout out from New York!
@KateAronoff Teachout is getting pounded. She looks to desperate.
@altochulo Great looks win. She needs to stop with the I'm more liberal than you. She's looks to desperate
@NickReisman Teachout is getting pounded.		She needs to spend more time learning policy and sticking to it and being aggressive and less time arguing about who's more liberal
@rachbarnhart Zephyr Teachout is getting pounded.		Like her policies but this is exactly with am so critical of my own party.		All show. All grandiose.		We spend more time arguing whose more liberal and Cuomo is the devil.		Maloney most likely will win.

I am telling you what to do. You know your losing when you gotta invoke Republicans when fighting with a fellow Democrat. Nothing learned from '16
@HeyRaChaCha @PaulKingsley7 @RomeohRomeo @rachbarnhart No. Unfair and honestly insulting for her to assume or state as if it were fact what Paul would or wouldn't do in a given situation. She said if this was a Republican he would do such and such. That's not right. She wouldn't like if other dems made the same assumptions about her.
@PaulKingsley7 @RomeohRomeo Exactly. New York voters don't care about this petty nonsense. That why these so called democrats keep losing in their own elections and their own districts. They are too stubborn to listen and to prideful to let go. They push on US the voters what they think we shld care about.
@rachbarnhart @PaulKingsley7 @RomeohRomeo I believe in your vision for this state and the country. The progressive and pragmatic vision but it hurts US when the only party with the better ideas spends more time fighting amongst ourselves than pushing the good things. Unfair 4 you to say &amp; assume what one might do. Sad.
@rachbarnhart @PaulKingsley7 @RomeohRomeo Theirs No way @rachbarnhart you know for a fact what you state. I understand you want " your candidates to win, badly". But that's not you to allow yourself to get down into the gutter politics. Sad are party acts like this to each other. We have learned nothing from 16'. Nothing
@ChrisCuomo That attitude @ChrisCuomo is exactly why you don't be on the air very long. Your that arrogant that you also the hands that feed you and your kids.		@ChrisCuomo do you ever listen to your viewers?		It's about them not you.

@petew77 @KatPriolo @EvesDungeon @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison Because like other women like my sister's they have brothers, uncles, dad's, grandpa's, whom they wouldn't want a women to feel she can be weaponized to ruin other men's lives for the sake of money or attention. Apparently the sled too much for your small brain to get. #dumbass
@petew77 @KatPriolo @EvesDungeon @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison Grew up without my dad. Single parent home. My mom, me and my 2 sisters. Now have 2 nieces. Very aware of what women think because they have been the closest to me my whole life. Most women you dirtbag don't want other women throwing out the me too stuff for money or attention.
@petew77 @EvesDungeon @KatPriolo @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison Be careful their too Chief. Insinuating that I have had DV allegegatiins against me or that anyone does with whom you disagreed with is great way to get yourself into legal trouble for defamation of character.
@petew77 @EvesDungeon @KatPriolo @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison First it's if someone says they don't believe her without evidence you say it's because their democrats lol. Now you say any man who says he wants evidence must be because they are bitter because they had allegations against them. Could it just be as simple as your wrong ? Dumb
@petew77 @EvesDungeon @KatPriolo @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison You stand with her. Why? How do you know what she said is true????		So If I say something happened to me your just gonna believe me ?		That's not just justice that's blind ignorance.
@EvesDungeon @KatPriolo @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison That makes no sense. You are a dumbass.
@BustaBrown8 @MrStormcloak @simplemines @EvesDungeon @KatPriolo @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison No shame here bot. Shame on the women who do not for attention.		Unless theirs evidence no-one should believe. Period.
@KatPriolo @petew77 @EvesDungeon @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison Peter is a dumbass. No where did anyone say they are "sure" her allegations are false. What was said is unless she has evidence to out forth besides choppy texts then why should anyone believe her. Unfortunately lots of women use this genuine issue for their own gain. Peter = bot
@petew77 @KatPriolo @EvesDungeon @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison No-one is saying they are pretty sure you dumbass. Where did you see in my tweet where I typed "I am pretty sure, she is lying". What was said is unless your going to put forth evidence why should anyone believe these "allegations"?		Delusional Trump ass kissers I tell ya.
@EvesDungeon @KatPriolo @SylviaIngram13 @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison It is a disservice to real victims when we allow other to use the #metoo for their own personal gain whether financially or for attention. If what she alleges is true she must be willing to back it up with evidence or else ppl should remain skeptical. That's justice. Period.
@SamanthaX_real 1/ @SamanthaX_real I don't take offense to what you say. But you're statements are misguided and mostly wrong. The only part your right about is people should do more then complain via Twitter. First, it's incorrect to state that "it was your people who voted for him" the...
@SamanthaX_real 2/ ..implication from that statement is we (us Americans) voted for him so how can we be or why would we complain now. Majority of Americans didn't vote for trump. He lost the popular vote by 3 million votes (3 million ppl). He won what's called the electoral college. This means
@SamanthaX_real 3/ ..that he won the state elected delegates. These are elected/designated people whom rep. their respective state.

@SamanthaX_real 6/ ..before they achieved the American Dream by making it big in Hollywood. Just because they have money they can't express their political beliefs or feel a certain way 4 their country. The country that afforded them all they have?

@Nikki_Irish You are an amazing person.		So glad I found you and follow you on twitter. Not just saying any of this to suck up. Genuinely mean it. Keep doing good work.		Now I just need to get screened and get an appointment with you 😎
@AshlynSparksXXX @PlumpPromotions @bunnyranch @BrothelsNevada @KitKatBrothel @DennisHof @PlumpSexy @BbwPromotion @LoveRanchNorth @BbwHeathens @sagebrushranch To make an appointment to come see you.
@RobynStevens74 Its true. 😉
@costareports @alexburnsNYT @jmartNYT Open revolt really ??		Reason why both sides are just disgusted with the media. Make issues out of non-issues.		Creating problems for your sick pleasures as journalists is not reporting it's being lazy and creating hyped up garbage.

@LilypoolXO @sagebrushranch Gonna be vacationing their next month. Your gorgeous. Would love to buy your time when I visit. I also love cuddling and watching movies.
@holy_schnitt You are gorgeous.
@EuropeDiChan You are stunning. When will you visit/tour New York again?
@fictionfree Exactly. I like her too. Liked her when she ran for mayor of Roch. But one thing I learned working on campaigns &amp; close to candidates is part of winning is you have to be able to listen to people who will tell you "no" and "sir/ma'am your wrong". Wish her the best She seems sweet
@rochplanner @rachbarnhart @Morning_Joe @RUN_AMC Actually what I said is the exact opposite. Their is no one strategy. Never. Liberals only have one strategy. Trump sucks balls, abolish ICE &amp; impeach. As I said. For her district which my aunt lives in Greece. Should have been Healthcare premiums, Jobs, tourism economic growth.
@fictionfree Brad Hoylman of the 27th and Mayor Svante Myrick of Ithaca NY.		It's about messaging. Her mesagaing was, even as she has admitted, not tailored to the district she ran in, which wants traditional candidates. To me she has the better beliefs but not a winning strategy. Backwards.
@fictionfree @rachbarnhart @peaceluver57 Btw I have worked for a campaign. As a strategist. A winning campaign not a losing one. So sorry nice try. It's sad to see fellow progressives be so immature. It's about the voters not about me or you. It's not about how you or I "feel". You strategize for the district and win.
@fictionfree @rachbarnhart @peaceluver57 My tweet had nothing to do with a voters "savy". You only prove my point. Liberals. Again which I am one, are stubborn &amp; cannot except failure and the logical explanations of those failures. She lost. Why? Blaming the "machine" is just another way of saying "its everything else".
@rachbarnhart @fictionfree @peaceluver57 Liberals need to stop only focusing on personal stuff and complex issues that for working class voters are to overwhelming. Like any service. You meet them. Not them meet you. Healthcare premiums, Jobs, and more tourist business for upstate NY. That's the message.
@rachbarnhart @rochplanner Answer is No. Which is exactly what she alluded to on @Morning_Joe this morning. She Said demsshould have a short and simple message for &gt;their districts&lt;.	Liberals, for which I am one, can not go off on deep deep tangents about Citizens United etc. Stick to jobs. Win. Then fix
@havencarlisle_ @steven_wms21 That sucks. And his girlfreinds twitter is in his description. He has humiliated her. Hes a dumbass.
@jeffzeleny @jaketapper @JoeCrowleyNY The major identity crisis ? 		You such a sleazy journalist.		Why do you guys have to make everything a problem when their isnt a problem?		Jeeze so damn dramatic.		Zelleny your a dumbass.
@rachbarnhart Never got a message from anyone from the campaign. Watched your mayoral run &amp; noticed quite a few things that you could have done diff to maximize potential as a politician. Sorry you lossed, cant say Im surprised. C-Nixon has similar issues. Must change or she likewise will lose

But I know not all LE officials are cowards like that	 The just know better to keep their mouths shut.		Get out of your right wing bubble.		Want change? Get off twitter big guy.
@JamesAGagliano @derekahunter @nypost No need to research you. You expose yourself as a clown when you post ignorant things like "it's a fact theirs no racism by LE".		So what your an ex FBI agent ?

@ChrisCuomo How do you know their being accepted as Fact ?		Your knee jerk reaction is to assume they are "being accepted as fact everywhere" and then make a impulsive dumb comment. Your a journo not the Internet police.		Must be your wife and kids are gone and your bored out of your mind.
@ChrisCuomo With questions like this @ChrisCuomo is only confirming A. He's letting the trump presidency ruin his image as a journalist. B. He is becoming petty. Can one just write something without you making it seem sinister. 		Hope ppl continue to turn of CNN

@JamesAGagliano @derekahunter @nypost Once again a piece with "all the facts", and yet nothing that speaks to the point of what Black and Brown americans have said which has to do with racism, fear of those white people don't engage with etc. 		Sad.

@DavidJollyFL What is also relevant is that Monica Lewinsky is not a metoo victim. 		While wanting sex with Clinton she got impregnated by a Pentagon employee &amp; then had an abortion.		Diservice to actual metoo victims.		Power dynamic is valid but does not and should not excuse her own actions

@rachbarnhart I don't think you give NYS voters enough credit. I am an informed voter. Will vote for cuomo not because he is perfect but because he's more genuine and his policies. A lot of ppl liked his dad, liked Andrew enough to vote for him as AG and governor twice. Rigged card seems low.
@rachbarnhart So tax paying, hard working voters like myself and my mom who like cuomo &amp; will in all likely hood vote for him are Naive ?		So if he wins it's because the system is Rigged? Not because he ran the better campaign and people voted for him on the merits? Nixon has to earn vote.

@rachbarnhart Works for state gov is corrupt or would like to be told they work for a "machine". Your tearing down trust in the institutions we need. Take a step back and be humble about it. I realize you are running for office and are desperately trying but don't sacrifice nobility to do it.
@rachbarnhart Your a journalist &amp; it's unfortunate you don't seem to realize what you say and how you say it has consequences. You should know better. Holding elected officials accountable is totally different than carelessly referring to our state gov. as a "machine". Not every one who.....

@rachbarnhart Way to early for any reasonable politician in or out of the race to be suggesting or stating Cuomo might lose or even be primaried. Remember  ROB ASTORINO 2014 won every county in upstate NY except one &amp; still lost. I'm open to Nixon. But her strategy to win is not good yet. No.

@ACTBrigitte So you want people to feel sorry for you for getting "attacked" by @CoryBooker so you smear an FBI director who had to hide in a closet when his home was broken into by a  violent criminal? Your gross. Don't feel sorry for you one bit. If your a bull, you deserve what you get.

@PreetBharara Love you preet. Get Ken Burns on your poscast. K? K.
@WhiteJoshuaL @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump LOL good luck. Feds won't stand by and watch people kill each other. Go ahead though. My advice watch Ken Burns Civil War and/or Free State of Jones movie. One is documentary latter is movie based on true story. We're on opposite sides but I don't hate you. Be safe man.
@WhiteJoshuaL @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump So start a civil war clown. Good luck with that. Good luck trying to go against the federal government. Fool.

@ModernTrailhead @cityscottp Your delusional. Remember Ferguson? When the DOJ and FBI wrote a scathing report that the Police, funded by tax payers, found that employees were drawing pictures of the first lady as a monkey and call the first family then apes in emails. No sympathy for his 3rd wife. Sorry none
@cityscottp Got that right Scott. I tell friends of mine don't argue with them. Reasonable people know that Hannity and Fox News said some sleazy things about Michelle Obama and pushed the Birther Theory. Both I'm sure hurt her. They didn't care then. Hypocrisy of the Right Wingers.
@davidaxelrod @TomSteyer @POTUS So when IS the time to stop appeasing @davidaxelrod ?	You didn't take trump seriously &amp; admitted as such. Now you want fellow democrats to just sit by &amp; listen to your "wise words" your "sit by and just be polite" garbage is why Obama wasn't harder on banks, Russia, ISIS. go away
@alanaevansxxx In all seriousness I hear ya on couple aspects such as decriminalization of prostitution, escorts, more brothels in states, 1st ammendment priveldge for advertisement.

@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne Lol singer
@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne 40 % approval. Special elections 2-2,  conservative media ratings down. Lesbians like maddow up. Turn over. And a criminal investigation. Most Americans don't like the president dummy. Why is this so hard for you to accept??????? You love him that much???
@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne 3 million more people voted for clinton. Hence more people voted for clinton. Did you get that? Hence more Americans didn't lie trump. Hence why liberal media is doing so well and fox news isnt. Dumb dumb this is simple logic. If he was so popular I don't think this would be case
@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne Wasn't what the conversation was about you moron. Wasn't about campaigns you pinhead. Do you sing because you don't know how to read ? Did you bother reading what the conversation was about ?
@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne No candidate has "ever" campaigned to win. Pretty interesting theory greg. Lol god you guys are dumb.
@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne Go sing greg. Politics ain't your thing man. Must be you didn't get a gig tonight so your bored at home. No one's crying lol but I'm glad you think you know. Do you embarrass yourself in front of your band too ?
@wolferkitten @therealroseanne No need for a conversation with someone literally this dumb and delusional. Just because you got fooled by a new york game show host doesn't mean your gonna make the rest of believe his or your crap. Sorry doesn't work that way.
@wolferkitten @therealroseanne Choosing to write how I want to is different than you being literally dumb and delusional. Your dumd. You reveal your stupidity with your twitter page and your tweets. Again sorry it's hard for you to accept that Most Americans don't like your idol. Get over it.
@GBrunswick @wolferkitten @therealroseanne Crying? And you deplorables are still mad the guy you worship so much is gross and has a horrible approval ratings and most americans don't like. Again, sorry that's hard for you guys to accept. If all you can reply with is about spelling then I guess that means I'm doing good.
@wolferkitten @GBrunswick @therealroseanne "As we know it".. lol okay you really are just dumb. Go pray or something. Tomorrow is easter. Be a better Christian and stop lying.

@wolferkitten @therealroseanne His ratings? Wtf are you talking about. Lady I think you have fallen off your rocker. This isn't a tv show. His ratings? Did you mean his poll numbers?

@cityscottp I support a ban on assault weapons just not sure how it would be enforced.
@cityscottp Now they (the NRA) care for the safety and well being of black Americans? My brain tells me #1 No, they dont. #2 They see their losing not just corporate partners but also members (mostly white Americans) so now they need black Americans to join. Sorry NRA. Won't fall for it.
@cityscottp Sounds about right to me.

@RealBobAxelrod @FaireComments Dumbest thing I have heard 2day. Your are ignorant &amp; delusional. I'm not a bot. Guess it's easier for u to assume I was so u can build up your "I'm too smart for every one" complex. Nazis had machine guns, airplanes, tanks, and unlimited $ to buy more. Still would have killed.

@RossBarkan @rachbarnhart If this is all Nixon supporters can say then Cuomos re election margin might be higher than 14's.
@RossBarkan @rachbarnhart So law school isn't a qualification. Funny. Almost 30 years layer never hear of an issue or controversy when he was Clintons HUD secretary. Didn't know being a son of a governor made you a celebrity either. Let me guess his dad paid off Andys bar exam officiating supervisor too?
@ericsslater @KimCamarato @MichaelAvenatti She really needs a new attorney. Don't trust him. I'd advise her to go before cameras in public and tell your story that way and then cry and apologize to melania. That would have most impact and get people paying attention. Anger makes ppl listen. Then do an interview w. Stahl.
@MichaelAvenatti Be very careful @MichaelAvenatti if your case as based solely on the idea that the American people should care and know truth your walking a thin line of trust and can have it backfire on you and her very hard. Do not disappoint the very people your asking to fund her suit.

@MichaelAvenatti @rolandsmartin Won't b watching think it's all hype &amp; think ms clifford should have a better attorney. Anderson Cooper is doing interview. Watch karen McDougal interview he already did and you will see line if questioning will be weak and nothing big. Basically an interview of background info.
@Lawrence Which is why I follow only one person from cnn. @ChrisCuomo mainly because his father was a great gov of my state and now his brother is. I like other reporters their but won't give cnn the dignity of following them even on twitter.
@ChrisCuomo I think Italian women are the prettiest. I'm Hispanic so I get my fair share of Mexican comments. Sometimes I laugh cause it's hard not to. Sometimes I get mad. "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". 🕴
@ChrisCuomo Watched your Pop in an interview where he was saying once out of law school he had a hard time getting a job and his friends suggested changing his last name to conrad. Always thought his reason 4 not doing so was pretty respectable. Are you a made man @ChrisCuomo ?
@ChrisCuomo Cute just like your dad. Always making the young think more deep about things while being thankful and informed. Your a good man @ChrisCuomo just stick up for your self more to your GOP guests 😇😇

@Bakari_Sellers To say that other people's history was not as bad as yours is disgusting and ignorant. Always liked you on cnn and follow you because I thought you were a good guy. What you said is very cold and ignorant. Many people's have complex history. My family struggles every day.
@Bakari_Sellers @Bakari_Sellers that's no excuse 4 ignorance. My nieces and extended family are black. What people did to the other people 200 years ago is always a horror and never should be forgotten but you and No Killer Mike, are extremely ignorant about your conversation. Stop being a fool

@DatelineNBC He's is delusional. My "experience to show up with an AR15". What a clown. Keep it in the pants next time and keep it professional. Could have been a good guy and helped a lot of people. Let's sex and hero glory destroy him. Sad.
@klnynews @CynthiaNixon That's not how she's gonna earn my vote or my families and she needs upstate NY to win. Either she's dumb or needs to hire a better consultant and strategist.
@JimCarrey Love it!!!🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒

@RepCohen @AC360 Multiple times having unprotected sex with multiple women. Then going home and having sex with your wife who just gave birth https://t.co/LUZBjHMBi6
@jaketapper @IronStache The only thing CNN does well l. Pin people against one another. Sickening.
@Alex_Roarty @CathyMyersWI @dccc It's not about knowing who's better it's about having a good candidate. If myers message is simply anti Paul ryan anti randy. Then she will fail and have earn not many votes. That's not how you earn someone's vote.
@Nordfold @ksthornton @Alex_Roarty @CathyMyersWI @dccc If people of Wisconsin 1 vote based on who paid their child support and who didn't then theirs a lot more wrong with that district than Paul ryan. Dems apparently have not learned their lesson from 2016. More fighting about who is more liberal than who. Sad &amp; pathetic.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers 🖒 agree. Wish escorts and brothels were legal here in NY.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers I think you'd have a good shot, seriously. Of course obviously if you wanted that. Just so I can be better informed what are the 3 top issues, laws, that sex workers right now are looking to get passed or addressed? Genuinely want to know 😇
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers You should run for elected office. Id vote for you 😊
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers I agree Christians are the least attacked though they act and talk like their the most persecuted. For the longest I have understood their hypocrisy and why they do it. Me personally I'm spiritual and an atheist. Don't believe theirs a god by that the universe is supreme.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers Guess for me I think theirs a difference between making a joke about someone or something &amp; eve if it's offensive or kind of pisses me off I just feel it's easier to laugh about it. Especially if you feel they don't know what they are talking about, why not laugh it off. That me
@XBIZ @ElectHof Hoff is a clown.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers I understand. I just think every body gets it. Blacks, Hispanics , Christians, etc. Hope ur not too mad at me. Just how I see it. Still a fan and hope sex workers rights become a bigger issue for the better in the not too distant future. Wish NY was like NV. Legal prostitution.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers Rather hangout with you over him any day. But how do you know he's pro-sesta? Your basing that on timing of his joke. I don't know whether he is or isn't. I do know jokes don't necessarily mean their for or against something. Every body is picked on. Every issue is made fun of.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers I follow you not just because your obviously gorgeous but also because I support sex workers rights but it's just a joke. Not sure one knows how he really feels about sex workers in general not sure he would say on a comedy show.
@ingodwetryst @sethmeyers You do remember your own vocabulary usage right ? It's a joke. "Joke"..."Joke"....."Joke". He's a comedian. If you can't take a joke from a comedian then your issue is not with people who actually do hold prejudices against sex workers your issue is with yourself.
@CynthiaNixon @nymodelelite Great for progressives and for national but if the campaign continues to work like this ad suggests she will get pummeled in the election. Cannot win upstate NY talking about poverty and a subway. Dems plz learn from 2016. This is not a race to the bottom.
@StormyDaniels @BreeOlson Lol attention whore? Wtf.. what is this a PSA
@KyleKashuv Hahahahahahahaha
@alanaevansxxx @CNN Their just getting their panties in a bunch because you exposed their guy for what he is. A cheap, gross, perverted, emotionless creep. Keep your head up. You have more supporters than haters put here in the USA. trust and believe that.
@tmmcm @dadofccx3 @SethAbramson @JeffreyToobin @AlanDersh He believes trump can deliver on a pro Jerusalem deal. He cares more about that country than this one. He believes and knows trump is in deep shit and feels the Mueller probe can remove trump thus kill a pro Jerusalem deal.
@CynthiaNixon @kharyp Make it about the issues not about cuomo this cuomo that. If this is how your gonna run your campaign then you will not earn my vote nor my families.

@rachbarnhart Have a good mesage. Anti cuomo crap is not a message. Whose more liberal than who is not a message,  and will not earn my vote or my families vote. Nixon must tell her supporters to not make this about the DNC machine or any of those conspiracy theories. Talk about issues.
@ZephyrTeachout Agree. I hope it's fair for all candidates. @ZephyrTeachout Nixon had to earn mine and my family's vote. Just being anti cuomo is not gonna impress me. Don't come to my door with anti cuomo crap or who's more liberal than who. Earn my vote.

@rahumphreys1 trump calling Rosie O'Donnell a bimbo or a slob, that not attacking women? Your okay with that? Clearly because you voted for him. You might wanna re read the Bible. Jesus would not act like and did not act like trump. Raised in church you don't act like christ like.
@rahumphreys1 Your mad at jim for "attacking" the federal employee being paid by me the tax payer and say "great another attack on a women"? Your are not very intelligent are you? But the man you voted 4 to be president talk about grabbing a women vaginas with out her permission? That's ok?

@TerryGipsonNY As a resident of Binghamton ny and a voter can you be more specific about how you will address and solve issus relating to prejudice as it pertains to criminal justice system writ large. Bail, incarceration, special prosecutor for police killings of civilians, stronger laws etc.
@CTLizB @NYGovCuomo Republicans and Ms. NIXON have no chance. But makes for good tv and gives something to self proclaimed political news pundits to talk about it. I'm a liberal Democrat and Nixon has no chance. Not this election cycle. Also said same thing about Clinton before her embarrassing loss
@rachbarnhart She Doesn't stand a chance. I am a liberal &amp; Republicans are right about one thing, we never learn, we always screw ourselves. If I'm a republican strategist I am calling top party leaders and getting us a candidate. Good news for any republican potential gubernatorial candidate.

@ChrisCuomo Exactly what I said when I read it. Cites no evidence. Somehow  Andy McCabe will make it unfair for a pardon for anyone else? Peple need to calm down on the left and on the right. Leave Mueller alone. We are only hurting ourselves as a country agree on something @ChrisCuomo
@KevinMaddenDC @JamesAGagliano So no one can stand up 4 themselves or else their politicizing the issue? People need to relax &amp; just let Mueller do his jon. If comey wants 2 speak so what. Stop reading into so much. Man is entitled to speak his mind. Jesus christ. Are we all gonna destroy ourselves like this.
@JamesAGagliano People are rediculous. Beyond pathetic this piece in the Hill. No need for Mueller to step aside. Partisan hacks, including current and former FBI agents should step aside. Let Mueller get to the bottom let the chips fall where they may. Americans need to stop hurting America.

@LisaBloom @JoyAnnReid @LisaBloom in all seriousness someone should talk 2 her attorney &amp; suggest bringing on another attorney. I'm a progressive democrat. Love you &amp; your mom. But as of now trump has the upper hand. Especially with the venue change. Will only have once shot to get it right. Call them.

So because he's a cop that makes you assume he's a good person? Unlike you not assuming genuinely asking if that's what your suggesting? #DontBeDumb

Nowhere in my tweet did I say All right wingers are bigots. I specifically said Lamb is a bigot, which he is, did my research.
@Mediaite @JamesAGagliano What a joke
@JamesAGagliano @JamesAGagliano do we know if McCabe lossed health insurance for himself and/or family?

@cheri_neill @LivePdFantasyLG You ready for Live PD? 😉
@JamesAGagliano They were for this kind of program before, what changed??? Conservatives why I couldn't ever align myself with people of the such. Those who commit crimes like defraud the United States are bad. Period. If your conservative or LE you should be angry these men hurt us.
@JamesAGagliano So hypocritical. Conservatives mad about it because it exposed embarrassment about their guy (trump) when they wanted to believe he'd be some Reagan like figure. Only reason it's an issue. Flynn and others were just as dangerous t our country as bin laden. Crime is crime.
@ChrisCuomo @ChrisCuomo very unnecessary remark . Won't be watching u at 9pm 4 ur new show &amp; no longer watching cnn all together. Not cool. To be that simplistic &amp; say her show is only successful like hannity because she's partisan is an insult. She's extremely gifted and intelligent women.
@ChrisCuomo @ChrisCuomo Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where maddows politics are. Watched ur show at 9pm as long as it was on. Extremely disappointed you would compare her to someone like hannity. Gifted and intelligent women. She reads and researches unlike a lot of journos.

@mattklewis @JamesAGagliano Good for him. That's his opinion.
@ChrisCuomo So your dad shot AR15'S @ChrisCuomo ? Your dad was pro life? Interesting.
@JamesAGagliano @AshaRangappa_ That Obama "evolved" on LGBT rights is overly assumptious. Don't know if it was a evolve or just a political switch due 2 the times. Some white politicians back in the 70's &amp; after didn't evolve on black civil rights they just politically made a choice 2 not b open about it.
@angela_rye @MakeupByMila @Tylerjones And how does this help get Democrats elected?? Extremely disappointed.
@CarolHLN Your still awake?
@BrookeBCNN Love you @BrookeBCNN
@JamesAGagliano Interesting opinion.
@rachbarnhart Once again making assumptions. Doesn't help get Democrats elected. Not stop lamenting doesn't help get Democrats elected.
RT @Alyssa_Milano: Where’s the MSM on this, @CNN, @MSNBC, @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC? https://t.co/RsQh8yhEwc
@kathygriffin Always said same thing. Eventually dems will win and have majorities. Eventually. Putin and douche are that dumb.
@USA_First_2016 @ChrisCuomo Why should I have to pay for trumps wall when he said Mexico will pay for it ?? So you don't want pay more into &gt;your&lt; health care but are okay with paying for a wall, I am assuming? God I hope I am assuming wrong.
@USA_First_2016 @ChrisCuomo Agree with u on that point. But don't blame 1 man. Once ppl realize this it"ll really help their wallets. I don't like paying taxes but I know it's right thing 2 do. If I can afford vacations and to stuff my face with food I don't need I can afford to have my health covered.
@USA_First_2016 @ChrisCuomo To cover u. So if those extras weren't covered and God forbid something happened from one of those conditions you can afford to pay out of pocket? Again insurances &gt;could&lt; help with those costs. Does not do so. Not one man's fault sorry. U shouldn't b so cheap with your health.
@USA_First_2016 @ChrisCuomo Key word** (Me). It worked perfect for you. Everything not just policy &amp; politics is subjective. What works for you obviously doesn't work for someone else, what works for me may not work for you etc. Did you forget you live in a country of over 300 million ppl.

@USA_First_2016 @ChrisCuomo Insurance dictates premiums. Not Obama. The government dictates tax cuts. Republicans only learn this lesson after things get really bad. Remember 2008??? Then what happened? Country elected first black president. Indiana and NC went blue. Ppl lost lots of $ so they voted blue.
@USA_First_2016 @ChrisCuomo My Dad's a correctional officer, moms a occupational therapist both NYS employees. We're considered middle class. Got an increase of $85. Combined. But a CEO gets a minimum 5 million tax cut. That's minimum. You should be mad that someone else benefits far greater at  ur expense.
@cheri_neill @LivePdFantasyLG Okay. Thanks for the friendly conversation. You seem like a very good women.
@cheri_neill @LivePdFantasyLG Followed them and just signed up. Seems pretty cool. Do you win any money or anything like in fantasy league football? haha I am guess not.
@NicolleDWallace Love your show!!! Wayyy better than Tapper.
@cheri_neill Of course deputy McElwain is pretty awesome too. Can't wait for this Friday for more LivePD. Do you have you have a favorite?
@ZephyrTeachout On all elections. On all races. Enough of the who is more liberal than who. You have to earn my vote. Don't come to my door saying cuomo this and cuomo that. What's your Past record and what is your agenda moving forward. Also dem candidates need to grown some balls. B Agressive.
@thehill Your credibility is already shot when you can't even stand up for yourself or your children. How can the American people expect you to stand up for us???
@fawfulfan @chucktodd Agree. He's a coward. Like many in the media. Cowards. I woudnt want my kids swearing or.yalkomg bad about anyone period. But the idea you can't stand up for yourself is pathetic.
@cheri_neill Like the four wheeler
@GwenGraham @TrueFactsStated @BetsyDeVosED God she's dumb. As long as you have lots of money you never listen to people. Why? I don't know. But since she has lots of money she doesn't listen only to ppl who don't tell her the truth which is your fucking dumb and don't know what's good for teachers or students.
@misslaneym @Ask4AdiAmour Very cool.
@rachbarnhart 4th grade is a little young 2 b seeing a movie like that, I agree 2 that aspect. But u take things 2 seriously my goodness @rachbarnhart These young black kids unfortunately will witness even more life altering violence at the hands of of a police officer. Let's worry about that.

@jmartNYT @jmartNYT your a clown. Why ppl don't like media now. It's about not trusting the media from the right. And from everyone else it's don't like the media because your customers say their displeased and you guys don't listen. Shut up and fix your attitude. Do what we want

@rachbarnhart Every Grandy Jury is different. Laws pertaining to grand juries for state trials vary state to state as well.
@NicolleDWallace Because @NicolleDWallace is too nice and tolerant of it. I'd snap at them 👊
@rachbarnhart @jerseygirlangie @jkane005 @CynthiaNixon My free advice would be spend money on top staff not on ads or donuts 4 the team. Let ur supporters no the realistic goals for a campaign &amp; for governing if one wins. Be Agressive against ur opponent which dems aren't the best at &amp; above all be able to listen and take criticism.
@rachbarnhart @jerseygirlangie @jkane005 @CynthiaNixon @rachbarnhart their r choices Cynthia Nixon looks like she's gonna get in, terry Gipson, I'm sure others will jump in by next election cycle. The issue isn't choices the issue is ppl with political aspirations who have no winnable strategy, horrible campaign Mngrs.
@rachbarnhart @jerseygirlangie @jkane005 @CynthiaNixon Makes no sense. A moderate republican is a better choice than Cuomo? Wouldn't they just be the same? A cuomo agenda is worse than a NY Moderate republicans agenda? Sometimes I think people don't even understand the fundamentals and distinctions of government and politics.
@rachbarnhart @CynthiaNixon They want someone from upstate. Cuomo is from queens but his moderate stances help him carry enough upstate counties to win state wide office. *The Buffalo billion. That's why cuomo gets elected even tho lots don't like him. He understands getting elected statewide different game
@rachbarnhart @CynthiaNixon Agree. Everyone deserves a chance. If I was her campaign manager the one main thing I'd worry about is moderate democrats from upstate NY. Born and raised in upstate NY and still live here. A lot of weariness and frustration toward the idea of another NYC politician....

@HvyDty4x4 @MacMimi61 @KyleKashuv @KellyannePolls @replouiegohmert Youtube is your friend. Louie Gohmert. I only judge after in hear them speak. For me rule of thumb is watch 3 interviews then make my own mind up. He doesn't represent my district thank god. But he's a shallow we say....a Nut.
@ChrisCuomo Agree with u on a point @ChrisCuomo that is that most Americans including his supporters know he cheated on his wife while she was pregnant &amp; they won't/don't care. So what's the endgame purpose, win or lose, for stormy daniels counsel? Cover up matters, lies from our gov matter.
@guypbenson @minneapolismilf @KyleKashuv Because he's a hypocrit. Is it really that hard. He calls for unity then runs around getting his picture taken with people of the likes of Kellyanne Conway. He's in the minority for a reason. So sad he is so misinformed. He's just used but guess he doesn't care 😄
@KyleKashuv U preach for unity but then have ur picture taken with the most divisive political party members. Ur a hypocrit. Their will be no progress until you understand this but you keep getting your pictures taken. Your in the minority when it comes to ur fellow students 4 a reason.
@KyleKashuv @KellyannePolls @replouiegohmert So your pinned tweet suggest decisive over divisive. And yet your standing with 2 of the most divisive federal employees. You make no sense. You are who you hang with. Might wanna find some new friends.
@jaketapper @NAACP @jaketapper I know ur bias because ur jewish and it seems like u obsess over that fact but millions have to deal with prejudice. Call that out u sleaze! This is why through it all I never followed you or watch you on cnn. Your smug and soobssed with jews u can't even be nomal.
@NicoleHockley @sandyhook @DylansWings Wish you warmth, comfort, and hopefully lots of love from tons of people.
@jaketapper Hey @jaketapper YouTube veterans who utter antisemitic words and who believe jews "control" everything. Will you condemn veterans who hold same views??? Why are you such a coward to not condemn veterans But want to make a fuss about Farakahn? All are gross people. Ur selective.

@rachbarnhart She's adorable 😊
@JoeNBC How do people know because ratings are down that it is in direct correlation with politics??? People don't wanna hear preaching? It's not preaching it's called these are unusual times and just because these people made something of themselves doesn't mean they have to be silent.
@jaketapper @TheLeadCNN A lot of veterans say disgusting things and take pics with disgusting people. Will you @jaketapper denounce them ? No. Because your obsessed with the military. Why I stopped watching cnn. They look for non-issues just to start fights. Pathetic.
@CathyMyersWI @IronStache @jimmy_dore Tell your supporters to stop attacking people. This is why republicans win. Because Dems are constantly fighting about who is more liberal than who. None of us will get get a raise, or he good health care if we fight and a republican wins the seat. Debate l but then support dem.
@CathyMyersWI @AdamParkhomenko @drhanskeirstead @HarleyRouda @IronStache This is why dems loose because they wanna argue and have meaningless debates about who is more liberal than who.

@JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump He's definitely paranoid!
@JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump Agree with you 100% @JohnBrennan
@rachbarnhart Money is always an issue. I agree. If I had known about your campaign I would of wrote you a check for $500 what I usually do for campaign donations me personally. Get a good finance and sales guy but don't forget to understand th electorate in whatever voting yr it is.
@rachbarnhart Agree 100% I want all progressive D's who earn my vote to win. Campaign finance reform definitely. I agree with your message disagree with how you sometimes go about it  and know for a fact it won't help the cause. R's win when D's have this infighting. 2016? We must do better.
@rachbarnhart You ran for mayor. Didn't you ever ask yourself why some voters you knew in your heart were gonna vote for Mayor Warren even though you made the point extremely well that she really wasn't gonna help them? If Gipson has the chance to win, and  earns my vote that's one thing.
@rachbarnhart Supporting is one thing. I agree wouldn't it be nice if dems would vote for alternative to cuomo who is more progressive. But will most? No. Ask yourself why @rachbarnhart seriously ask yourself why. Must understand individual voter and electorate.
@rachbarnhart By your standard your a hypocrit. Why not vote for cuomo even though he hasn't done every little thing you like??? No candidate is perfect. Understand voters logic @rachbarnhart don't treat them as if their stupid. Won't help you if you ever decide to run again. #NotAGoodLook
@rachbarnhart Gipson needs to tell me a voter and voters like me why he has a pathetic record on criminal justice reform, would he appoint special prosecutor in civilian police shootings that resulted in death, etc. Doesn't just get my vote because ppl bully me into voting. Not how it works.
@rachbarnhart Never said u should be silent. It's not what ur saying it's how ur saying it. Calling people like me a hypocrit doesn't make me want 2 listen 2 u. And if ur not just barking 2 make noise but actually want change then stop being stubborn &amp; petty. Learn 2 listen a little.
@rachbarnhart Calling people who are progressive Dems hypocrits won't help your cause. Ease off the judgemental attitude. I'm a progressive democrat I like &gt;almost&lt; everything Gipson stands for. Pathetic record on criminal justice reform, special prosecutor/civilian shooting etc.
@NicoleHockley @AndraDayMusic @common @sandyhook You look stunning.
@deray MSNBC cause they have more of a diverse group of correspondents/anchors. Also CNN tries 2 hard 2 win over trump supporters &amp; caters 2 hard 2 the Republicans but then will ask hard questions 2 their liberal &amp; Democrat guests. MSNBC has right business model. Why their beating FOX.
@BillOReilly @NRA OMG @BillOReilly you have fallen completely off your rocker. That sex scandal really messed you up 🤐
@rachbarnhart @KaraKane Nothing in this pointless discussion is "known for sure". So why bother have it? Swear ppl are just bored. This is why the right can make us on the D side look so foolishly &amp; HRC lost to a game show host from queens. Liberals spend their time talking about dumb things like this.
@rachbarnhart Blaming any1 is a waste of time. Online gossip and endless verbal loops on "defending people whom you don't even know" is not gonna help get Democrats get elected. The country is going through an identity and constitutional crisis and we waste our time on these pointless debates.

@VonnieCalland @MYMIMISTHEBEST @DiogenesToo @RWPUSA Power dynamic doesn't apply to Lewinsky case because she was an intern for one, second her position did not give Clinton influence over her. The only power of influence he had over her was to offer her a higher paying position which 20 yrs later we know was not the case.
@VonnieCalland @MYMIMISTHEBEST @DiogenesToo @RWPUSA Agree power is definitely a Factor. Some Ppl in positons of power sometimes use their power 2  coerce, pressure, or make a women feel obligated to willing or unwilking 2 engage in sexual activities, may fear losing her job etc. Power dynamic doesn't apply for the Lewinsky case.
@RWPUSA Bills sin was giving into tempatation period. He had a far greater responsibility as president, a husband &amp; father. Should of been more responsible &amp; had better judgement. Lewinsky sin was flirting and seducing married men and sleeping around. Only a victim of her own decisions.

@JamesAGagliano 1/Have said a similar quote also from Lincoln to my girlfriend since trumps inauguration. She like most in my family are scared, not scared of trump. He's just one man. But scared of what's happening to the country. Believe I first heard it from Ken Burns Civil War documentary.

@rachbarnhart @mltrickey Cops lie @rachbarnhart hate 2 break that to u. This is his side of the story, with editing I am sure from his attorney. Did u forget that? Not very responsible 2 make ur statement as if it were undeniably true. 2 sides to a story. Investigation isn't complete. Cops can b cowards!
@rachbarnhart I wouldnt be following protocol if people are being shot. You do what is necessary. After columbine the rule was to &gt;&gt;Not Wait&lt;&lt; go to where you hear the gunshots and engage the shooter. Not sit outside because the manual said to. Christ can anyone ever criticize the police?!
@rachbarnhart "He's a single deputy in a confusing situation". What a pathetic thing to say. 17 teenagers are dead. On s many levels that should not of happened. Makes me sick when people always excuse cops because "it's a hard job". That's what they signed up 4. That's what their paid 2 do.
@rachbarnhart &amp; this kind of meaningless debate only ensures trump will win a 2nd term &amp; Republicans will continue to win elections. It's garbage like this that is gold to a republican strategist. As long as democrats r fighting amongst themselves about whose more liberal than who USA looses.

@NicolleDWallace I think that's understandable. I think the left is lucky to have you. Love watching you and your show.
@BestWestern Are you or are you not with the NRA?
@JamesAGagliano No I know. I was just saying I'm not a hater. Long time viewer of cnn, think your a great asset to them. Versatile you could talk politics and sports.
@JamesAGagliano Lol trolls. For the record I'm not a hater. Your a basketball guy. So am I. As a viewer and twitter observer that makes you A Okay in my book. I just don't get all the dramatic outrage over these corps. decisions Logically all of them can't be making a nieve business mistake.
@JamesAGagliano Chased away his but gained more. Not sure why right wingers are so soured. Guess it's the feeling you get when your prom hopeful tells you she's gonna go a different direction with someone else. Right wingers get over it. What happened to let's do something for the kids???
@guypbenson @united Right wingers = Hypocrits***
@guypbenson @united You lose the argument when you start by calling people "online mobs". Go find another airline company stop your temper tantrum. U are just making it obvious u want them to chose sides. So if they don't listen to the "online mob" you say nothing ? Rights winers=Hypocrits
@JamesAGagliano Republicans really show their true colors when they feel their hands are being pryed from lever of power. So disappointed. If a corp. decided 2 sever ties with PPH I wouldn't say a thing. I'd be a hypocrit &amp; it would be exposing my bias. Stop trying to portray fairness. Patheric
@MetLife Good business move!
@JamesAGagliano @NRA @Delta @JamesAGagliano as u know. Law of unintended Consequences goes both ways. U could say the same for the "other side" No ? Why should ppl whom oppose NRA be punished by having 2 give money to a corp. who sponsors them? Simple: u can't plz every1. Delta is an irrelevant focus.
@Delta Applaud you delta. Wi continue to give you my business. Business model is more ppl fly you that are non gun nuts then fly who are gun nuts. #NoBrainer
@JamesAGagliano Shoud go to NRA and get them to do sensible gun control and help be a part of that process. I applaud these companies and am making a mental note to give them my business. NRA will still have other sponsors. Companies well within their right. If ppl don't like it tough.

@JamesAGagliano Damn right @JamesAGagliano
@JamesAGagliano No. It wont. I agree with you let teachers with LE OR Military experience, even better actual combat experience have a firearm. Would save life(s) and wild weaken fear from students who have a little more confidence in their teacher having a gun who has that experience.
@shelbystar4 Gorgeous ;)  When are you gonna be able to do shows on Internet like webcam or something? I'd pay you money and you'd be able to make money every night. I'd get on every night and pay to webcam you. Gonna be in vegas this summer. Hoping to see and talk to you before  then.

@TrueFactsStated GUT
@JamesAGagliano Hey I agree with you @JamesAGagliano if I was a student of yours I'd trust you to engage in fire. Just sad that in America this is what it has come to. Now it's wishful thinking to send your little ones to school without them seeing any guns. On good guys or bad guys.
@rachbarnhart People who really want change don't think modestly and act passively. Tell the politician who's finally doing their job, it's about damn time and then keep your foot on the gas and never let up. They don't need to b congratulated 4 doing their job.
@rachbarnhart Not about being a popular stance it's about looking at the totality of where we r on this issue and the administration's past. Never understood why people, let alone citizens who claim they want change, congratulate people for doing what they shld being, their job.
@NatashaBertrand @karenhunter @CNN Getting their senses back Finally!!!
@JamesAGagliano @Jackie51561079 If I was a right winger I'd watch them &amp; b very satisfied. They have the highest rated shows. Fox and Friends beats every morn show and Hannity beats every 1 in prime time. Come on. I understand R's envious but to say they don't have fair coverage is just wrong in every aspect.
@JamesAGagliano Never understood ppl who complain that mainstream media NBC, ABC,CNN, CBS (but not really) is liberal or only show liberals looking favorable or glorifying them because there right wing media. I'm a left guy. I don't complain what they show. I just call it out as bs issue wise.
@JamesAGagliano Called Fox News and Newsmax. They show a lot of pro life stuff including bringing ppl on who say PPH kills babies alive. Is the mainstream media more socially liberal, Probably. So what? If you don't like them showing kids who probably are liberals switch to Fox. Simple.
@RWPUSA Thought you didn't read books because you "learn" a different way??? Must of got his teachers aid to give give him a power point presentation.
@JamesAGagliano @BreitbartNews They get ya @JamesAGagliano 	Thier a bunch of rodeo clowns over their at Bart.

@NicoleK8686 @itsmeavaz @StopItAlan Good for you to stand up for yourself. Lot of the women in the Conservative circle do and say everything their told by their hudbands. Keep doing what your doing. If they don't like it they can kick rocks :)
@DaveEverlasting @ChrisCuomo Nope :) You probably stare into a mirror every morning thinking your such a bad ass. Clown :)
@DaveEverlasting @realDonaldTrump He doesn't give two shuts about LE. Why because he said in 2016 that he does???? #TakeOffTheBlackHood
@DaveEverlasting @ChrisCuomo "Proves"&lt;&lt; eh? LOL Amateure? Must such to spend all that time working out just to only be able to play an tough guy on twitter. Nope. Think you deplorable have proven the only dumb and ignorant ones are you. You like a game show host from queens. Stick to working out.
@DaveEverlasting @ChrisCuomo Cause bad guys just walk around with bad written on a piece of paper taped to their bodies. Dumbest thing I have heard yet.
@DaveEverlasting @ChrisCuomo Typical. The answer is Do Nothing! Gun nuts just can't let go of their sex pistols. Apparently they feel separation anxiety already ;)
@JoeNBC Always loved it when a Gun Nut would say need guns to protect when the Government goes too far. LMAO. Right ;) cause Bob and Billy and their AR15'S ate gonna be able to stop the Marines, Army, Nacy, Airforce, Coast Gaurd, Drone Strikes. Just admit your obsessed w. Violence.

@rachbarnhart The electorate has 1 thing in common right now, they all seem to b persuaded by some 1 who is "personable" &amp; Agressive. Most Dem candidates I know lack the Agressive characteristic more seen in Republicans. Ppl r angry &amp; want a someone who will fight Terry MaCaullife comes 2 mind
@rachbarnhart DNC should b vetting individuals by this summer. Joe Biden the way he is now would Not win	Good man, Savy Pol, but would need  to b open to "acting", "talking", etc. &gt;differently&lt; Not sure if he'd be willing to listen 2 a political strategist and then b willing make changes.
@NicolleDWallace Don't be Intimidated @NicolleDWallace by these cut and run cowards. Keep doing what you been doing, which is the right thing. Your son and his future is wayy more important then any charge they level at you :)
@nachosarah I nominate you spokeswoman of our soon to be created Organization.
@JamesAGagliano Still lots of respect for you. Always enjoy watching you on CNN. Wish you also would go on MSNBC. We will all see what happens when the investigation is officially over.
@JamesAGagliano I don't hate Trump. I don't hate anyone. Hate takes 2 much energy. I jus worry for the country. Like I said. I want trump to succeed. I'd feel like a hypocrit to say I'm worried the country might be falling apart them turn around and wish our President ill. Sorry if I insulted u.
@MichaelSSmithII @jimsciutto Point was they don't need to hunt with AR'S many farmers have same issue. You don't need an AR just admit it. Just admit you like it. You like the way it looks. It looks cool. You like how power you feel. U sound dumb saying u need an AR to protect ur farm from pigs LOL
@JamesAGagliano @julianbland58 @SalenaZito I understand lets all agree to this investigation isn't done. Let's all not make conclusions. I want trump to succeed but to succeed he must protect us &amp; that's all I want. By not being able to call a spade a spade @JamesAGagliano he is not protecting us. Plz be mindful of that.
@JamesAGagliano You are coming off as a trump apologist, enabler and defender. Come on @JamesAGagliano don't be so dismissive. Look at the bigger picture. Don't lecture us on drawing conclusions when every tweet u put out on this idictment has been "No Americans did anything and no collusion"
@JamesAGagliano @julianbland58 @SalenaZito @JamesAGagliano Respectfully disagree. As a attorney I kno it's everything u say &amp; dont say. Correct Rosenstien and the Indictment states no American name. But the investigation has not concluded. So be careful jumping the gun that no American has done wrong or no collusion.
@JamesAGagliano No they will probably never face justice. Doesn't the U.S though try and pick up some of these creeps like if they leave Russia and go to another country? I will repeat what many have said. Bob Mueller is a beast.
@AriMelber Who numb nuts ???
@sarahcwestwood Of course that's how Thugs work. Syphisiticated Thugs. They couldn't just make it too obvious. They had to make it &gt;appear&lt; or lay down foundation to be able to fall back on. "See, we did it too both"...
@JamesAGagliano @ChrisCuomo @JDWackrow @CNN @NewDay I like that my GF has a gun to protect her and to hunt or for sport but we realize at the end of the day a gun any kind of gun is like medicine you should really only use or think about in emergency. They should not b glorified. Guy wasn't old enough to buy a beer. So rediculous.
@JamesAGagliano @ChrisCuomo @JDWackrow @CNN @NewDay Your absolutely right @JamesAGagliano. Always said the same thing when a irresponsible gun nut would say to me we need the 2A to protect ourselves from a Tyrannical Gov. The Gov. has the Marines, Airforce, Army, Coast Gaurd. It's a foolish argument. They must know that.
@gwvanson @rachbarnhart They didn't teach common sense at ur school. I shortened words so can fit in less in tweets. They teach Grammer :) #UseYourCommonSense
@rachbarnhart Yea defrancisco is a sleaze ball. If I was a republican strategist I'd say the best chance at winning governor in NY would be Brian Kolb. He'd get all of upstate and be able to get Westchester county and LI. If Kolb decides to run. My money is on him. Course I don't want him too.

@ChrisCuomo Nothing chris because guns are great. Violence is awsome. Gun owners "rights" apparently are more important than mine and yours and your children's rights. This dumb redneck country love their guns. They worship them more than God. Sad ain't it chris ?
@Laura_Opiela @rachbarnhart 3/ just complaining and Yes research too. Dems need to come to grips with this. Some voters just don't care. We care more then they do. Dems shouldn't just contain but explain to All voters why they should care. Keep eye on the ball. Don't get caught up in endless complaining.
@Laura_Opiela @rachbarnhart 2/ corruption rampant in the white house now, from Domestic violence being covered up to the Russian Investigation. And yet 88% of Republican office holders across the country and Republican voters still support him. I was speaking 2 electability and thus having change instead of
@Laura_Opiela @rachbarnhart 1/ All of it true. But unfortunately that's not what majority voters at the end of the day will vote on, hence being elected. I want @rachbarnhart to be elected for any office. Clearly she's a good person. But Americans voted for trump someone they &gt;knew&lt; was corrupt. Theirs...
@gwvanson @rachbarnhart Also don't be a coward. Put a pic up of you so I can how dumb you look plz. If you wanna change the "corrupt" system get your law degree like me. Get off your ass and run for office and fix it. Your perspective is be lazy. But u wont. All u will do is complain. Pathetic!
@gwvanson @rachbarnhart Don't need to. Thinkin you need to. Saying what the governor is doing or how his office is run is like the "Mafia" is rediculous. The mafia killed people numb nuts. So to get change you say and shout the most rediculous things? Your a fool and hurt us true Dems who want change.
@rachbarnhart You would make  a great local, state or national public servant. Talk about corruption just try and not get carried away :)
@rachbarnhart 2/ what happens is ppl begin with good and genuine intents but then come off extremely polarized and sometimes exagatory. Sometimes individuals come off as acting like they have a chip on their shoulder about it. That's y I said the mafia thing is a little extreme.
@rachbarnhart 1/ I don't think it's being Negative. I've watched your videos on your radio show, sometimes viewed your tweets because you talk about Rochester issues but also State and National Issues. By talking about corruption &amp; doing work about it Iyour doing a "positive" thing. I think...

@BunnyAspen @kitehkawasaki @ElectHof @nyegop2 @nyecounty 3/ I'd rather not give you $ or anyone $ that supports the gross pig that's in the white house or who is a gun nut. Sex is Not worth giving someone money who is that disgusting of a person. U don't deserve someone's hard earned money. Common decency matters more 2 me than aex.
@BunnyAspen @kitehkawasaki @ElectHof @nyegop2 @nyecounty 2/ Apparently money is all that's important 2 u. Or you wouldn't b at the place u r. What's more important 2 me more than money and sex is common decency. Something u obviously lack. Disgusting u tweet so ignorantly about guns on a day where high school kids were killed by a gun.
@BunnyAspen @kitehkawasaki @ElectHof @nyegop2 @nyecounty 1/Ur so right. Some things are more important than money. Too bad the pig u voted 4 and support doesnt share your concept. Money is &gt;all&lt; that's important 2 him. Guns are that important to u? So ur not as free in this great country as me if u dont have a gun. Guns are freedom?

Her statement Seems more like media bashing and disengenuous. Lots of respect for both you and @ChrisCuomo.
@JamesAGagliano @ChrisCuomo 1/ I agree @JamesAGagliano both trump &amp; the media should b responsibly scrutinized. The media does at times allow themselves 2 get sucked into situations where they intentionally or naively glorify murderers, H.R. Violators, etc. who would/will do harm to our country as a whole.

@rachbarnhart 3) Understandably &amp; Unfortunately most voters don't comprehend the constitutional crisis this president has and will cause with a full 8 yrs. Because they can't see past their short term momentary financial gains. That's all I was saying. My fingers r crossed
@rachbarnhart 2) $ is the one issue I warn Dems (candidates and my dem friends) about that cld result in neither the House/Senate being flipped. If we don't flip either chamber I would bet against my own party that it was because ppl still had their O'Care and their 401k's etc. were making $.
@rachbarnhart 1)U raise a very important point. Which I think u were saying is Dems should be worried cuz ppl tend to vote their bottom line and if the bottom line is doing fine they (ppl) may not feel a reason vote otherwise. I agree with that. Do I have it right or no?
@baseballcrank Yes all liberals are opposed to republicans helping the impoverished. As a lawyer myself it's astonishing your one and that's your come back. Sad.

@rachbarnhart 2.) Any person would be a fool both logically and economically 2 put their faith in "in the moment gains" by a administration that can and has before changed rapidly. Dems should help ppl understand this.
