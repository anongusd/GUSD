“Am I dreaming? I wonder if I am. ... As soon as I realize how happy I am, I think of my brother and sister, both victims of the war, and my eyes mist over.”		“More than ever I am convinced that the war is over. The weapons have been put down: they will not be picked up again.“ https://t.co/6Qt2LQ3JkG
“Great tears fall, as I think that it is all over.” Frenchwoman Denise Bruller, in a letter addressed to her fiance Pierre Fort https://t.co/SejL946QVR
“Never, I can never, express to you the feeling and delirious joy of this first day of armistice. The upheaval to the very depths of my being, and this incredible thought that not one more man will fall, that the immense length of the front is silent. Nothing but silence.” https://t.co/U8KZVc9k1B
“Each soldier had his arms full of French girls, some crying, others laughing; each girl had to kiss every soldier before she would let him pass. There is nowhere on earth I would rather be today than just where I am. ...” 😘 https://t.co/mEcF0RZHrk
“I only hope the soldiers who died for this cause are looking down upon the world today. The whole world owes this moment of real joy to the heroes who are not here to help enjoy it.” U.S. soldier Capt. Charles S. Normington, 127th Infantry, 32nd Division https://t.co/NDI0153paz

#Easter2018 conversation of the day - overheard on the way into church: 		My 3-year-old: Does Jesus look like a dragon?		His grandad: No. He looks like a man. But he DOES have a beard. 		My 3-year-old (somehow satisfied that a beard and dragon are equally cool) - nods. “O-tay” 💛

Great panel with @guypbenson &amp; @dylanmarron - WILDLY opposing view points but really informative discussion. Both sides had strong reps. Great model for future #SXSW #IMHO
Interesting point by @dylanmarron about divisive discourse - says he’s attacked by left (he’s liberal) for talking to “other side” ~ there’s confusion about what empathy means: “Empathy doesn’t mean endorsement” #SXSW
"This is an exhausting politicizing of EVERYTHING" @guypbenson - followed by the "#GreatBritishBakeOff may save us all" @dylanmarron @greatbbakeoff #WhoKnew Any @BritishBakeOff #GBBO fans?
"Some people are beautifully direct about it" - @dylanmarron addressing critics #SXSW But..."It really sucks to receive these messages. It's easy to laugh now, because I have the power. (There is a comedic element when re-read outloud). But it sucks to get a barrage of them."
“I say what I believe” @guypbenson responding to comments from critics. Panel is about how to speak to the “other side” #SXSW - both panelists addressing online threats they get from critics...@dylanmarron https://t.co/Qhw0xAgIRG
Good life advice: "Just be better than everyone else" @BreedloveSteph "Expect that you are underestimated and use it as an opportunity to blow them away." #boom #SXSW
Panelists at #SXSW spoke about Russia rising #cyberwarfare during early stages of #Syria conflict. Asked what "the rise" looked like? Responded: "widespread A$$holes...with a unifying message" #FoodForThought https://t.co/WmET9sjIAh

This is a great panel. No "anti-man" vibes, no "let me tell you an inspirational story"...just good perspective on the "Why" ~ WHY investing in women makes sense...How to be better together. #SmartHER #SXSW https://t.co/kwcCYVJN2c
Why actively invest in women? It's not a men vs woman thing says @truewealthvc ~ "Women are seeing problems male entrepreneurs aren’t seeing." 👉👉👉 #SmartHerNews @SmartHerNews

Ok. Wait. Do you all believe this statement as to WHY we can’t be more effective against Russia cyber warfare? Is this VALID? : “We can’t counter any propaganda because we don’t know what we (America) believe” @selectedwisdom

#Lavrov says "not trying to accuse anyone or exonerate anyone"...#SyrianStrikes #SyriaGasAttack
Bottom Line - #Tillerson clear, concise, confident #Lavrov emphasis on investigation, UN, Hague, "accusations" against #Syria govt
#Tillerson says Assad has brought this situation on HIMSELF. #Lavrov not as confident in chemical attack. Wants independent investigation.
#Tillerson says confident in chemical attack by Syria forces...used chlorine bombs/cluster bombs on more than 50 occasions...(cont)
Questions! interesting...#Lavrov seemingly more complimentary #Tillerson starker, shorter statements - Both said mtgs were good (paraphrase)
#Tillerson The situation in Ukraine will remain an obstacle in improving relationships with Russia.
#Tillerson Re-emphasizes continued talk on #Syria...and Russia's help changing course of #Noko regime.
#Tillerson We need to put an end to the steady degradation (of our relationship) #Russia #USA
#Tillerson we believe in unified #syria....we believe #Noko needs to be denuclearized...There are other issues we have differences.
#Tillerson lengthy conversation on #Syria, shared perspectives on solutions...in some areas we share a common view...
#Tillerson "we just came from a productive meeting..." 2 hours w/@PutinRF_Eng Putin. I expressed current state of relations is at a low pt
#Lavrov I do hope the many hours we spent with Rex Tillerson...have not been spent in vain. We understand each other better.
#Lavrov shuld both sides demonstrate a pragmatic approach...this will improve our relations as well (translator "irritants of Obama admin")
#Lavrov @WhiteHouse team has changed &amp; we do hope our contacts on strategic stability will be resumed (underscores unfilled positions)
Observation: #Lavrov long laundry list of issues - a stark reminder of all thats happening in the world today...&amp; why THIS PRESSER MATTERS
#Lavrov "We touched on the #Ukrainian crisis" - and honoring Minsk agreement...and implementing it.
#Lavrov talks about common approaches in #Libya, #Yemen...&amp; Israeli/Palestinian peace process? (wow - unexpected) &amp; #Afghanistan
#Lavrov mentions #Iraq &amp; #Libya - elbow to ribs of American past foreign policy (follow to previous tweets)
#Lavrov We assume as well that the publicly stated position of Russia &amp; the US - no intention to interfere w/domestic affairs of #syria
#Lavrov We do have some arguments but we arent trying to impose them on anyone. We want there to be a frank investigation
#Lavrov We take note of the Americans willingness to take part in the investigation...#syria #SyriaGasAttack
#Lavrov We have said there has to be a thorough investigation into this incident (chemical attack in Syria)
#Lavrov mentions the call between @POTUS &amp; @PutinRF_Eng on Apr 4 &amp; terror attack in #StPetersburgMetro
#Lavrov "We do understand if Moscow and Washington cooperate, this is not to the benefit of just our nation but the whole world"

@jimhigdon Hey Kentucky!
...congress defined persons to include companies #Gorsuch (Anyone else feel we will have this debate defining person/corporations 4EVAH?)

@SophiaTesfaye very interesting case, isn't it? Wish we could run little "explainers" along with each case Senate Cmte is asking about...
Now #Gorsuch &amp; @SenatorDurbin discussing #HobbyLobby case...Durbin really going to heart of Dems criticism of #Gorsuch
#Gorsuch says it maybe an unkind decision but his job isnt to write a law but apply it...says the trucker CHOSE to drive &amp; wasnt protected
Now @SenatorDurbin asking about 1 of the cases some Dems feel show #Gorsuch doesnt care for the "little guy" (ruling vs a truck driver)
Apparently @SenatorDurbin was asking because some students had complained about this discussion. He quickly moves on after #Gorsuch answer
#Gorsuch is explaining this is part of textbook curriculum &amp; discussion about inappropriate questions asked about family planning illegally
#Gorsuch is being asked about what he taught in an April 19th class about maternity leave/gender Univ of Colorado legal ethics class...
Q:"Are we at war?"  A:"All I know is there are a lot of men and women in harms way so we can sit here and have this conversation" #Gorsuch

Answer by @PressSec is there are many sources of info for @POTUS - Next question about declassifying content of calls - not at this time
Good question by @KatiePavlich about whether or not there is concern within WH about any misleading info from #Flynn on other issues...
Another mention by @PressSec to a "series of issues" that led to #FlynnResignation - (What are those issues? We need a follow up on that...)
She could not confirm there was an investigation (into #Flynn) @PressSec on "heads up" from acting AG Yates that led to WH review
Affirmed over &amp; over @PressSec the content of calls wasn't an issue #Flynn - Reminder: no one knows the exact content of calls publically
"No. Absolutely not." @PressSec response to question by @MajorCBS whether or not #Flynn was ASKED by @potus to discuss sanctions.
The issue pure and simple came down to trust... @PressSec #FlynnResignation
Next question @PressSec responds to as to why Flynn wasnt asked to resign earlier, says there was thorough review happening by WH Counselor
So...@PressSec...1st question re: who on the Trump CAMPAIGN had contact with the Russians...@PressSec says nothing has changed (no)...
Ironic metaphor as @PressSec turns to Oroville Dam catastrophe considering the amount of "leaks" on the #FlynnResignation story...
Misleading information &amp; potential forgotten details' led to an unsustainable situation...@PressSec on #FlynnResignation &amp; @POTUS
..."series of other questionable instances" @PressSec part of reason why #FlynnResignation - says trust issue/not legal issue
"Back to the fun"...@PressSec now back on Gen Flynn - says it was a trust issue - "eroded to point to where he had to make a change" #LIVE
The @WhiteHouse trying to get back on msg fighting drugs... Treasury Sec asked about sanctions in Russia...says maintains status quo
First few words from @PressSec "HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY - I feel the love in the room..." #LIVE @FoxNews Now @USTreasury Sec speaking...

"I'm going to represent them (the American people) the way they should be represented" @POTUS
"We are no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing" @POTUS on Mexico and call with @EPN - "Friendly call"
"We had a very good call" @POTUS on Mexican President @EPN
Now @johnrobertsFox with question on phone call with Mexican president...GO JOHN!
"I have many times I thought I would get a long with people...and I dont like them at all" (LAUGHS from room) @POTUS

"We have a great general...&amp; he stated publicly he does not necessarily believe in torture/enhanced interrogation... @POTUS will rely on him
"There will be time where we disagree...but point of special relationship is to have an open and frank discussion" @theresa_may #Breaking
Now @BBCNews asks about where leaders disagree. And asks @POTUS about torture/immigration/abortion - sound like "alarming beliefs" to brits
First question to @steveholland1 - Asks about call between @POTUS and Putin. @POTUS says "early" to start talking about sanctions. #breaking
