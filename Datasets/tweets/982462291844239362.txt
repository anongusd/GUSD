@TheHRH The constitution was conceived from the start as a living document, with all the branches of government charged to uphold and protect it. The only one admonished to PRESERVE it is the @POTUS. The rest (Congress / Judiciary) must ensure it is applied appropriately to the time. /3
@TheHRH Thus the need for more learned judges to review the decisions of lower courts. The same need to interpret the Constitution through the lens of future society that our Founding Fathers hoped this country would survive to see absolutely requires a balance to ensure justice. /2
@TheHRH Totally disagree. If the #Constitution were immutable, the #FoundingFathers would not have made a tiered court system with multiple justices. It takes 1 court and 1 judge to decipher a frozen document. Because we all view the world thru a lens of experience everyone is biased. /1
