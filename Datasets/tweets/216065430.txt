Access to repro health services has allowed women across the U.S. to pursue higher ed, enter and stay in the workforce and provide for their families. Every woman‚Äîregardless of income, race or region‚Äîdeserves the right to control their own body and forge a path for themselves. 3/
In the fight for progress and economic equality, we must always support reproductive justice. We must continue to fight to protect and expand access to affordable reproductive health services for all, and we must oppose any effort to move us backward. 2/ #gapol
Instead of expanding Medicaid and tackling Georgia's maternal health crisis, Republican legislators are attacking #ReproRights and pushing extreme bills that risk women‚Äôs lives for political gain. SB 218, HB 481 &amp; HB 546 are cruel, unnecessary and dangerous proposals. 1/ #gapol

One note: rural access is critical &amp; essential, but so too is navigating the high cost of access in low-income communities. From options in-school for training to lower cost home access, spreading digital wealth must be a priority.

Healthcare coverage should not be yoked to job prospects, but the travesty is made worse with incompetence in an administration or failure to address basic infrastructure concerns.
One big obstacle to compliance: lack of internet access. While Georgia lawmakers plot a way forward on solving our healthcare crisis, a timely reminder that rural broadband deficiencies + high cost in urban areas are real impediments for the poor.

The movement we built together is only the beginning. We must keep fighting for the people who have always felt left behind, and for the communities whose security and status are now in question.
Because of your support, a little Black girl from the Deep South was within striking distance of a sitting Republican Secretary of State to be Georgia's 83rd Governor.
We reached out to communities across this state that very rarely see a candidate for governor, much less a candidate who is listening as much as speaking. We activated and energized voters at a scale never before seen in Georgia Democratic politics.
And at every step of this journey, instead of falling prey to fear, instead of being blown off course by the winds of doubt, we forged on.
Together, we won state House races and Senate races, a new seat in Congress and put America on notice that change is not coming ‚Äì it has arrived. And you made it so. #gapol
We believed in a new kind of campaign that respects every person and fights to earn, keep and count every vote.		And fight we did. We left everything on the field. We shifted the conversation. We demanded that every vote be counted. We made history.
And when they said this race would be a walk for Republicans, they shifted Georgia from ‚ÄúSafe Republican‚Äù to ‚ÄúLean Republican‚Äù to ‚ÄúToss Up‚Äù in the same breath.		Beyond the pundits, beyond the polls, and beyond party labels, we fought because we believe in Georgia.
When we kicked off our campaign in Albany almost a year and a half ago, we were told we would never win the Democratic primary. When we did, the pundits and pollsters said that a candidate like me in a state like Georgia would never poll above 30%. We did.
From the bottom of my heart: Thank you.		I am so proud of the movement we built. Together, we redefined the politics of possible in the Deep South ‚Äì but our fight is far from over. #gapol https://t.co/PV9hBM1gQ7

Our state faces a rural health crisis.		8 rural hospitals have closed since 2010. Many more hospitals are at risk. Thousands of families lack access to basic care.

For me, "criminal justice reform" isn't a slogan‚Äîit is personal, and a major part of our campaign.		I believe in Walter. I believe in GA. And I believe that together, we'll lead the way forward on this issue. For our families, our communities &amp; our future. https://t.co/a8COppEsIM

In '16, GA had the 4th largest prison population in the US. Most of these people will eventually be released, and the question is this: Do we support &amp; reintegrate them, or do we prepare them to go back‚Äîand how will we prevent the next generation of Georgians from joining them?
For my brother, "freedom" meant losing access to counseling and treatment‚Äîbecause, like Georgia, Mississippi has not expanded Medicaid. And when your last address is a prison, "freedom" means it's impossible to find a place to live and even harder to find a place to work. #gapol
The state of Mississippi, much like Georgia, does not offer substantive re-entry programs, and transitioning from prison back into society is impossible to do alone. #gapol
Unable to access the help he needed, Walter self-medicated. Over the years, he made bad choices to support his drug habit, and he ended up in prison.		Walter‚Äôs ambition fell in the face of his addiction. And when he was released from prison, Walter stumbled &amp; eventually returned.
Around 5 yrs ago, we found out that Walter has bipolar disorder. He was first diagnosed in prison, but he likely first presented in high school. He went undiagnosed and untreated because my family lacked health care, the means to address his illness, &amp; the language to discuss it.
On the campaign trail, I often brag about my five siblings‚Äîbecause they're all extraordinary people.		My younger brother Walter is brilliant, dynamic, and one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever known.

Across the state, Georgians are hungry for the prospect of change and new opportunities. Making that change real won't be easy. But together, we will build a state that puts the health and well-being of its citizens before corporations, political interests, or money. #gapol
This is the Georgia we are fighting for. A state as rooted in the traditions of community as we are committed to progress. A Georgia where no matter how tough things get‚Äîour core beliefs in faith, family and service never waver. #gapol
Ours is a state that will work for working families, and leave no community behind. 		Our Georgia will bolster the strength of trade unions and empower the physically and developmentally disabled to fully participate in our economy. #gapol
Working together, we will build a Georgia where every child receives an excellent public education and where small businesses have the resources &amp; opportunity to expand.		Our Georgia doesn't have to choose between protecting the environment or creating jobs‚Äîit can do both. #gapol https://t.co/kZtpg9j2Rl

As Dem Leader in the GA House, I was infamous for my "Leslie Knopian" obsession with facts &amp; figures. I once used a color-coded spreadsheet to stop one of the largest tax hikes in GA history.		Using policy to get good done is a part of who I am. It's why I am running for #GAGov.
That's why my website (https://t.co/zW1iluAW2z) has more than 100 single-spaced pages outlining my 18 comprehensive plans for veterans, for economic mobility, for affordable child care, criminal justice reform, higher education, gun safety, and much more. #GAGov #gapol

Now is the time to defend our values &amp; protect the vulnerable‚Äîfrom Randolph to Rabun Co.‚Äîand to understand that our democracy only works when we work for it.		Your right to vote is yours. It's a right worth fighting for. And we're going to give you a reason to use it in November.
Our ability to participate in government, to elect our leaders and to improve our lives, is contingent upon our ability to access the ballot. We know in our heart of hearts that voting is a sacred right. Now, it is time to step up and live that truth through our actions. #gapol
Defending our right to vote is personal for me. I grew up hearing my parents' stories about how they had to fight for their right to vote in the Jim Crow South. Their bravery influenced my decision to create the New Georgia Project to register every eligible voter in the state.
We can win, but only if we all step up right now.		To reach every voter, knock on every door, give rides to the polls. To fight until everyone knows the power of their vote, has a reason to use it, and sees what is at stake if they do not.		Join the fight: https://t.co/5d30bFtZqD
We are outraged, but we are not discouraged.		Your right to vote is yours. It is a right our ancestors fought and bled for, and we have no choice but to continue that fight.		It is time to pick a side, to pick up the baton, to fight like our future depends on it‚Äîbecause it does.
Efforts to suppress the vote &amp; depress voter turnout are alive &amp; well in Georgia.

When the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, Ellen &amp; William Craft fled to England to escape unrelenting slave catchers.		True Georgians at heart, they never gave up and always gave back. The Crafts returned to Georgia in 1870 to found a school for the children of freedmen. 4/

FACT: The 2011 GOP proposal eliminated funding for remedial classes for tech college students. Abrams saved this funding, co-sponsoring legislation to lower GPA requirements &amp; increase aid. Abrams is the only candidate w/ a real plan for tuition-free tech schools. - TA #gapol 1/
‚ÄúI will always stand on the side of the people to make sure HOPE is available for Georgians.‚Äù - Stacey Abrams 		FACT: In 2011, only Abrams worked across the aisle to defend access to higher education and preserve a full-day of pre-k for Georgia 4 year-olds. - TA #GAGov #gapol https://t.co/KEySShggMF

Building on her record as a champion for gun safety, Abrams is the only #GAGov candidate with a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence in Georgia and keep guns out of the wrong hands: https://t.co/Kxi3aYfctR #gapol
Fact: Abrams is the strongest supporter of gun safety in this race. She's the ONLY #GAGov candidate on either side of the aisle who never received a stamp of approval from the #NRA. - TA #gapol
The next #GAGov must have the courage to take on gun violence and fight for bold solutions to make our communities safer. I will be that leader for Georgia.		But first, we have to win on Tuesday. Will you stand with me?	https://t.co/bYulAijbxg #gapol https://t.co/xviDBWZJW5
