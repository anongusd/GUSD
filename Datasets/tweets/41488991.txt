"Enjoy your life," Trump says to new Attorney General William Barr, as he leaves a press conference called to declare a border emergency. In a few hours, he departs for a long weekend at his resort in Florida (and presumably, golf.)
More grousing by Trump that Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize and he probably never will.  Says that he should get credit for developing a great friendship with North Korea etc: "This administration does a tremendous job and we don't get credit for it."
Asked about the growth of debt (more than $2 trillion since he came into office) Trump says Obama put on more debt. True, tho Obama would note that was in an economy careening downward, and Trump inherited an economy that was moving upward. Says growth will take care of it.
Trump now asserting that statistics showing immigrants commit less crime than native-born Americans; that border immigration numbers are down, etc, are wrong, based on information he is getting from elsewhere.
Trump won't name Paul Ryan but contends a nameless Republican didn't do enough to push border issues. Says he has "built a lot of wall." False. Also contending West Side Highway terrorist brought "many people" into the country via chain migration. Also false.
Trump is now falsely denying he will be signing a deal that is worse in every regard, compared to what he wanted, than earlier deals he spurned. Turns conversation to 2020 election, and says Democrats are only driven to "obstruction" on the border by their desire to defeat him.
Trump is basically blowing past the constitutional question by citing his old campaign line: "If you don't have a border, you don't have a country." Then says he thinks he would win in court.
The complication for the first argument -- that he has done better than anyone at the border -- somewhat complicates his argument that there's an emergency afoot.
Trump claiming all credit, personally, for the fight against drugs and improvements in the economy, specifically denying any Obama administration role. Which is also false as fiscal indicators began moving positively early in the Obama administration.
"It's all a big lie, it's a con game"--Trump on Pelosi/Schumer on border, shortly after saying big loads of drugs don't come through ports of entry, which is false according to his own administration. https://t.co/vfSw6HwMqR

Trump[, wading into late term abortion, asserts falsely that Virginia Gov. Northam "stated he would execute a baby after birth."
Trump talks of bringing the cost of medicine "way down." That promise was a staple of his 2016 presidential campaign and one of the ways he broke from GOP orthodoxy. Republicans had fought any government intrusion into the market.
It's Infrastructure Week, or at least Day. After a brief mention of wanting to work with Democrats on an infrastructure deal, Trump moves swiftly to health care. (earlier he's boasted of some of his efforts to dismantle Obama's Affordable Care Act.)
"That's great. Really great. And congratulations, that's great," Trump says after extended applause for the Democratic women and chants of "USA!"
Democratic women, dressed in white, stand for Trump's reference to more women in the workplace. "Don't sit yet, you're going to like this," he says, adding a reference to more women serving in Congress than ever before.

When he talks about illegal immigration, Trump is animated and intense. Far different from earlier, when he seemed to give pro forma treatment to talk of unity and working together with Democrats.
"Until we secure our border they're going to continue streaming in" Trump says in an echo of Pete Wilson's campaign circa 1994 ("They keep coming."). National Republicans are trying to avoid the ensuing fate that met California Republicans.
Trump again blaming illegal immigration for crime and a host of ills. "Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate, it is actually very cruel." Now into the usual sex trafficking part of his stump speech.
Trump praises legal immigrants and says he wants people to come into the country "in the largest numbers ever." But he turned down a border deal because he wanted big cuts in legal immigration.
As Trump starts talking about caravans on the move south of the border, a slight sound of boos from the House floor. Pelosi puts her hand out and down, as if to still any insurrection.
Pelosi  gave a slight horizontal shake of the head when Trump says the state of the union is "strong."  But her mouth gapes when Trump demands an end to investigations into him as part of legislating. Now she's reading papers while behind him on the dais.

President Trump is now denying that he ever wanted a wall for the length of the border, which he did. Now segueing to a full wall defense, including favorite new anecdote about duct-taped women being victimized by traffickers which has mystified experts: https://t.co/0H0eI3uWlf
The president is giving up nothing publicly here, suggesting that walls will have bipartisan support. "Walls should not be controversial." Except Democrats have no incentive to bend, considering that it is the president who caved on this.
Trump says that federal workers will be paid "very quickly or as soon as possible." Also claims victory in convincing Dems that having "barriers, fencing, walls, whatever you want to call it" is necessary. (They've paid for all but walls for years.)
Trump now praising federal workers as "incredible patriots" and again claims they were encouraging him to keep the government shut down. (There's no proof of this.) Adds in his #MAGA slogan.
"We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government," Trump says. (He's capitulating to what Democrats have demanded all along).

Biden touting Obama admin programs that flowed to localities, including the Recovery act that propped up schools. Arguably, the admin didn't do the greatest job communicating to voters how profoundly they were affected by that measure. Biden is reviving it as he ponders 2020.
Biden pushing back against criticism that he's been too cozy with some Republicans to Democrats' detriment: "Well, bless me Father for I have sinned."
Ways you know it IS Joe Biden speaking at the mayors' conference: Within seconds of starting he"s said “Maybe it’s just an Irish thing" and "This is not hyperbole (twice)."

Trump's speech to the country on the eve of the second anniversary of his inauguration repeated the characterizations he used the day he announced his campaign -- that of immigrants being murderers and rapists.
Trump's offer to Democrats is the temporary protection for two groups -- Dreamers and protected groups -- in exchange for $5.7 billion for the wall. Insists the wall would result in "immediate" solution of border issues, which is impossible.
The rhetorical description of the wall becomes "the strategicc deployment of physical barriers."

Sanders, sounding like a Clinton staffer, says the FBI engaged in an "outrageous" amount of political "bias."
"We're not asking American taxpayers from that; we're looking at existing funding" for the border wall, Sanders says. Except that existing funding also comes from taxpayers.
"Maybe he did do those things but it doesn't have anything to do with the president," Sanders says about Flynn.
"Why is the president making positive comments about him?" Sanders asked by @jdawsey1 about Trump's praise of a former aide who hid employment by a fgn govt and lied in the White House. She says it's his right to do so.
"We'll see what the Senate does and let you know," Sanders says re looming government shutdown. Which seems a step back from comments this morning seeming to want to avoid a shutdown.
Flynn himself, in court today, denied that the FBI had behaved improperly.
"In the meantime we wish Gen. Flynn well," says @presssec Sarah Sanders --from the podium--about a former administration official who's pleaded guilty and is being charged by the Trump Department of Justice. And she goes after Comey and FBI who she said "ambushed" Michael Flynn.

At the end of the event, Trump said GA Dem gov nominee Stacey Abrams, a former state House leader, Spelman/Yale grad “is not qualified.” Earlier he called a second black gov nominee, Andrew Gillum of FLA, "a stone cold thief."
"Women don't want these people in our country," says Trump, aiming at a key part of Tuesday's electorate seconds after saying his immigration emphasis has nothing to do with the election.
Trump now setting up the possibility that if people trying to get over the border throw rocks, which is by far not the usual way it's done, they could be met by U.S. military firepower.
Asked about the separation of children from families at the border, Trump falsely says "that didn't happen" under him, and then says Obama did it and he did the same thing.
Trump falsely says that $4.8 billion has been set aside for wall and is being spent for the wall. Not true. $3.2 billion set aside for non-wall security.
Trump focuses at the end of every election on immigration, which fuels his base (and can attract some blue collar Democrats), as @mattviser and @jdawsey1 reported: https://t.co/ovRIAPlCmD
This is a repeat of Trump's earlier speeches on immigration, in which he's supported not only stopping illegal immigration but sharply cutting legal immigration. 1 of his arguments is they take jobs; contrarily he also contended today that the jobs market is the best it has been.
Trump insists that migrants, rather that fleeing violence and poverty by walking hundreds and hundreds of miles, are being drawn by "Democrat-backed laws and left-wing judicial rulings" in the United States.
Trump intimates that the U.S. military will be used to block entry of marchers, which is not in their job description: "We hope nothing happens, but if it does we're prepared."
Trump trying to counter pictures of women + children in the caravan that still is about 1,000 miles from border: "These are tough people...young men, strong men..they've overrun the Mexican police and overrun  and hurt badly Mexican soldiers...They've injured, they've attacked."
Trump falsely characterizing Hill immigration debate. Says Democrats, who are in the minority, are blocking action: "It's only the Republicans in unison who want to change them." Immigration bill foundered on Republican divisions.

Pressed by @Acosta about the absence of anything backing up his statements, Trump says "There's no proof about anything." Which he is taking to be proof that there are terrorists.
This is a continuation of the president's multi-year effort to taint refugees coming to the southern border with terrorists bent on damaging the United States. Trump says "it happens all the time." Government he leads says that's not true.
Despite the lack of evidence, Trump says he has "very good information" that terrorists could be in the caravan. This is a reprise of his 2016 campaign insults. (Also Pence again misstates intel about potential terrorists, says it's "inconceivable" there aren't some.) https://t.co/TOA0CTBMla

The visuals of that press conference say a lot about where the Republican party is today, as the bulk of its support is from white men. In 2016, Dems thought that the nation's changing demographics would propel them; they did not. They are making the same bet in November.
Hatch casts opposition and questions about Kavanaugh as based in opposition to President Trump and his right to appoint Supreme Court justices. No mention of accusations against him, apart from earlier insistence that (abridged) FBI probe turned up no confirmation.
This is yet another day when half of America appears to be speaking past the other half of America, with no real expectation for how that gulf will be bridged.
Amid optics of a Senate press conference featuring only older white male senators--at which senators are insisting a curbed FBI probe is not one--Grassley is now yelling at reporters about how far the process has sunk.

I might be missing someone, but seems that the only women Trump has actively championed were those who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misbehavior. Trump has declared that every woman who has accused him is lying.
"That's just completely untrue"--@presssec when asked why Trump believes men alleging church abuse decades ago but not women with delayed reports of abuse. Says it's ridiculous to say that Trump doesn't support women (many of whom he has mocked for accusing him of abuse).
Sanders insists that Trump mockery of Ford--which has angered Reps on Hill--was merely a recitation of "facts" and levels an insult of @acosta as representing a company that doesn't get facts.
Sanders insists that Trump is merely, on the Kavanaugh issue, saying that there should be due process. But she dismisses questions about how that squares with his support for death penalty for exonerated Central Park 5 as well as "lock her up" for uncharged Hillary Clinton.
Asked to rebut the NYT story, Sanders declines to go through details and instead quotes the president's father as saying that everything DJT touches turns to gold. Which by any set of facts in his business life is not true at all.
@pressec hitting Dems hard on wanting to hold Supreme Court seat open til 2020. "This is about politics. This is about power." Reps of course did hold open a Supreme Court seat for nearly a year and, when they thought Clinton would win, threatened to continue to do so for years.

Kavanaugh blaming Blumenthal for the references to Renate in Kavanaugh's high school yearbook. "You're just dragging her through the mud." Earlier, Kavanaugh had said he was "so sorry" for the sexual innuendo.
Mitchell is going through Ford's statement line by line, asking Kavanaugh if it's true: "No," he says repeatedly.
Have you ever passed out from drinking? Mitchell asks. "Never passed out, I've gone to sleep. Never blacked out"
"You're interviewing me, sorry to interrupt," Kavanaugh says after Feinstein repeats the question of why he hasn't called for an FBI investigation. "The Swetnick thing is a joke. It's a farce."
"Senator I'll do whatever the committee wants"--Kavanaugh, angry again, responding to Feinstein's question about why the accusers want FBI investigations but he hasn't called for it. "I'm here. I wanted to be here the next day. It's an outrage."
"I ask you to judge me by the standard you would want to have applied to your father, your brother, your husband or your son....I am innocent of this charge."--Kavanaugh's closing lines.
As his wife Ashley sits behind him looking bereft, Kavanaugh looks at Democrats and notes that "thanks to what some of you on this side of the committee have unleashed" he may never be able to teach or coach again.
In echo of his words the day he was nominated by President Trump, Kavanaugh is citing his longstanding friendships with women, his hiring of women clerks and his contingent hiring of women Supreme Court clerks. "That is who I am. That is who I was."
Now to the yaerbook: "Our yearbook was a disaster." A combination of Caddyshack/Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Re Renate: "One of our good female friends...that yearbook reference was clumsily intended to show affection." "So sorry to her for that yearbook reference."
"I liked beer. I still like beer. but I never drank to the point of blacking out" or sexually assaulted someone, he says.
Part-deposition, part-therapy session: Kavanaugh hearing emerges as strange hybrid via @PostRoz @thamburger https://t.co/Dj6lF9uvkB
Kavanaugh, occasionally teary, detailing how he was busy on weekend nights as shown by his calendar. (Though he says he's presuming the alleged party was on a weekend)
"I've never sexually assaulted Dr. Ford or anyone. Again, I'm not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted."--Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh returning to his tenure on Ken Starr's Whitewater prosecution team. Notes that some members of the team were outed for wrongdoing, but not him. (Followup on his earlier contention this is revenge for the Clintons).
"This pnslaught of last minute allegations does not ring true" Says that he does not doubt Ford was assaulted "at some polace, at some time." "I am innocent of this charge."
"Allegations of sexual assault should always be taken seriously..at the same time the person who is the subject of the allegations also deserves to be heard." Kavanaugh tearing up as he discusses his mom going to law school when he was 10.
"I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. You've tried hard you've given it your all. Your coordinated effort...will not drive me out. You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never."
"All nonsense reported breathlessly and often uncritically by the media. This has destroyed my family and my good name...a calculated political hit." (Also calls it revenge of the Clintons.)
Kavanaugh expresses anger at the delay of the past ten days, and fiercely goes after Democrats: "You sowed the wind, for decades to come I fear the whole country will reap the whirlwind."
"Listen to the people I know, listen to the people who've known me my whole life... I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford. This confirmation process has become a total disgrace." Blames "a frenzy on the left."
Kavanaugh, visibly angry: "I denied the allegation immediately, categorically and unequivocally...My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations."
Lindsey Graham says he doesn't doubt "something happened" to Ford who he described as "very competent." So GOP argument is she remembers a sexual assault but does not remember who did it. Not the best suburban woman argument.
"Dr. Ford...thank you very much for your testimony; more importantly for your bravery coming out," Grassley says to her. Now a 45 minute break before Kavanaugh. This undoubtedly comes down to he said/she said because no other witnesses will be allowed.
Mitchell questioning why Ford hired an attorney as opposed to going through an exam about her memories., and now her questions are over. Grassley introducing letters from Mark Judge and others. Democrats trying to introduce more letters from those backing up Ford.
Did you know that the best way to recount memories is in a private setting, Mitchell asks Ford. Five minutes at a stretch in public is not the right way, she says.
The question for the second half of this session: Does Kavanaugh come out blazing in the model of Clarence Thomas and Donald Trump? And does that backfire? Or does he approach it more softly and risk not matching the emotional power of Ford's testimony?
"I would be happy to cooperate with the FBI, yes," Ford says when asked what she would have done. Now Mitchell back on who's paying the bills. Will be interesting to see if she asks Kavanaugh about his finances during his testimony, as questions have been raised about that.
Mitchell back up, asking about how she came to get the lawyers she has and who referred them. Seems to be trying to make a case for Democratic collusion after the fact but that doesn't go to the root of the accusation.
"I wish that I could be more helpful and others could be more helpful and we could collaborate in a way to get more information," Ford says when asked by Booker what she thinks of the absence of a re-opened FBI investigation.
"They're doing fairly well, considering; thank you for asking," Ford says to Booker about her husband and children.
Ford asked if she knows how the letter became public. "No," Ford says.
Did you or anyone on your behalf speak to any member of congress or staff? Ford says "I did not." Mitchell is pressing about the actions of anyone who might have been speaking for her. Ford lawyer notes prosecutor is now asking her to guess.
Back to the polygraph. "Let's put an end to this misery: her lawyers paid for her polygraph...As is routine" Ford's lawyers tell Mitchell. Mitchell asks who is paying the bills. Ford mentions go-fund-me accounts, which she says she doesn't know how to access.
"Let me not interrupt you," says Grassley to Hirono, giving some glimpse at the message Republican senators may have received during the lunch break.
"We should be made to face the question of who it is "we are putting in high positions, Hirono says. "The issue of character matters." Hirono then brings up accusations against Trump and separations of border families.
"Is there a political motivation in your coming forward?" Hirono asks. "No" Ford says reiterating that she started raising questions about Kavanaugh before he was named as the nominee, not after as part of a Democratic smear.
In emotional testimony, Ford says she is ‘100 percent’ certain that Kavanaugh assaulted her, via @scotusreporter @seungminkim: https://t.co/GoNb6AJnon
RT @Fahrenthold: New scene from that Milwaukee bar, as Mitchell questions Ford.	"She's not on f-ing' trial!"	"Unfortunately, she is on tria…
Prosecutor's questions seem to be aimed at proving some collusion between Ford and unnamed others who guided her re the polygraph process. Also trying to get at video/audio records of polygraph although Republican senators have refused to admit testimony from the examiner.
On why the polygraph examiner came to her, not the reverse:  "I had left my grandmother's funeral" that day or the day before. Now Ford is being quizzed on whether she was given tips on how to take a polygraph.
So far the Republicans have pushed to prove that Ford has flown in the past despite claustrophobia and hired a lawyer on the advice of her friends.
Republicans are now spending minutes on whether Ford was offered the chance to talk to committee staff in California versus having to come back to DC. Again, process. And again, something that may seem off the point to viewers.
Asked by Coons how she's been impacted: "The younger you are when these things happen, it could possibly have a worse impact." There wasn't a lot fo drama but a scientific response that gets across that she's not milking this.
Here is the story written by @emmersbrown that stemmed from the conversations Ford is now describing: https://t.co/GesJkRxvMA
It's not just the treatment of Ford that is risky for Republicans here; it's the treatment by male senators of female senators. To them it may just feel like partisan bickering; but to those watching on TV, particularly women, it may play differently.
Grassley demands more data from the polygraph examiner; Klobuchar notes that Republicans refused to allow the examiner to testify, though the report from him has been received.	"You got what you wanted; I'd think you'd be satisfied," Grassley says to Klobuchar.
Klobuchar asks what she can't forget from that night. The snippets as Ford describes them: the staircase, the bed on the right side of the room, the bathroom in close proximity...
Mitchell eliciting statements from Ford that she does fly to vacations etc. She readily acknowledges that she does (she has said she's fearful of closed places as a result of the assault.)
On Fox, Chris Wallace talked today about finding out from his daughters things that had happened to them in high school (as a result of the Ford story:) https://t.co/7B9xSL209m
Grassley is a perfect example of that political adage: If you're still explaining, you're losing.
Grassley again defending his handling of this hearing, which again goes to the process of getting Ford to DC--not to her request for an FBI investigation or requests for witnesses who backed up her story.
As testimony restarts, worth noting that so far Republicans have not seized on what Trump understood in 2016: Emotion beats process. So far, all the emotion is on Ford's side (with a lot of the hearing to come, of course.)
"I said hello to him and his face was white"--Ford says of seeing Judge at a Safeway 6-8 weeks after the night. She said he looked physically ill. Another jarring moment as Grassley then angrily condemns Democrats for keeping her account secret.
"With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?"--Durbin.	"100 percent"--Ford.
Another sign of the limits of this hearing is that apparently no one is allowed to have a copy of the exhibit Ford was just given. (According to Grassley, who denied them to Democrats on the committee.)
"I was underneath one of them while the two friends laughed," Ford says.
"Bravery is contagious," Leahy says to Ford, telling her she is an example to other women.
It's typical of congressional hearings but nonetheless disjointed to have a prosecutor interviewing Ford, interrupted regularly by Democratic senators expressing their support.
Mitchell asks for details of the evening in question, again describes Kavanaugh and Judge as being very inebriated.
Ford says that if the committee could find out when Mark Judge worked at a Safeway, they'd be better able to figure out the time of the event. As with her request for an FBI probe, she's asking for an investigation of herself. Kavanaugh has not.
Feinstein: How are you so sure that it was Kavanaugh? Ford answering as a scientist, about the function of the brain in recalling trauma. "Absolutely not" a case of mistaken identity, Ford says.
Ford says the biggest impact was in the initial 4 years after the attack, but some symptoms--claustrophobia, for example--endure to the present. She did in fact get the second front door she demanded for her home.
Ford is now correcting a letter that she wrote, at which point Grassley interrupts the prosecutor and now Feinstein speaks. Ford was able only to note 2 of the 3 discrepancies in her letter before being stopped.
Here's a Post piece on Mitchell: https://t.co/1QUAAUNr5p
Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor hired by Republicans to question Ford, starts questioning her about messages to a Washington Post reporter and another letter, asking if they are accurate.
After Ford's gutwrenching testimony, Grassley immediately returns to discussing the process. Jarring.
"I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me...I am no one's pawn."
Ford's testimony was released yesterday, but it is another thing altogether to see her deliver it, passionately and emotionally, but firmly. She is not coming across as a "loon," as Lindsey Graham characterized another accuser this morning.
"I agonized daily with this decision throughout August," Ford says after thanking Feinstein for keeping her information secret. "My fears of the consequences of speaking out started to exponentially increase."
Ford said she did not publicly name Kavanaugh until this summer when he was listed as a potential Supreme Court nominee. "I thought it was my civil duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh's conduct."
Ford said that she did not discuss the details fo the assault until a therapy session that stemmed from her insistence during a home remodel that her home have a second front door (friends have said she wanted an escape route.). She said she described Kavanaugh to her husband.
"I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door." She said she remembers Kavanaugh and Judge laughing and "pinballing" down the stairs. "Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life..I convinced myself that because Brett did not rape me I should just move on."
"He began running his hands over my body and grinding into me," she said. "Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was very inebriated...I believed that he was going to rape me."
"They have been seared into my memory and haunted me episodically as an adult," Ford says after saying she does not remember all the details of the evening. Voice shaking as she describes what she said happened next.
"This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me."
"I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified," Blasey Ford says, and her voice breaks. "I understand and appreciate the importance of (you) hearing from me."
Grassley reprimands Feinstein for bringing up "unsubstantiated" claims and says those will be dealt with "at other times." But there are no other times; vote scheduled soon after this session. Grassley swears in Ford. "Proceed, please."
Feinstein offering details of the claims of witnesses that will not be testifying before this, including those raised yesterday. "Each of these stories are troubling on their own and each of these allegations should be investigated by the FBI."
Feinstein recalls walking through an airport and seeing a crowd gathered to watch the testimony of Anita Hill, directly connecting the echo from 27 years ago to now (an event that helped insure that Feinstein and women like her are on the podium today).
Worth reminding that Feinstein is in a re-election race with a fellow Democrat, Kevin de Leon, who has tried to make hay over Feinstein's handling of this. Hard to do given that Republicans are also attacking Feinstein.
Feinstein, now up, defends herself and reiterates that she kept Ford's accusation private at Ford's request. "How women are treated in the United States...is really wanting a lot of reform." And now Grassley mansplains her introduction of Ford.
Grassley now criticizing attorneys for others who have accused Kavanaugh of wrongdoing, although Republicans have made clear from the get-go that no other witnesses--including those who back up Ford--would be allowed.
The Grassley opening statement represents the divide: Republicans angry about what they say were Democratic "grandstanding and chaos", and leaning on process; Dems and the woman who is about to testify approaching it from 180 degrees away.
Grassley, opening a meeting at which Republicans refused to allow other witnesses, blames Democrats and the media for the current mess.
Grassley opens with  request for decency and civility, then moves into praise of Kavanaugh and reminder that "nowhere" in previous FBI looks at him "was there a whiff" of inappropriate sexual behavior. Repeats that Dems kept Ford letter "secret"--which is how Ford wanted it.
"We will hear from two witnesses"--Grassley opening the hearing with a nod to the extremely limited nature of the re-opened Kavanaugh matter.

Reminder that the president who said he did not believe Kavanaugh accusations because he too has been accused has actually paid off women for their truthful assertions.
"Always I've heard you're innocent until being proven guilty; in this case you're guilty until proven innocent," Trump, who minutes ago said the accusers are part of a "con job."
Asked what his response to the Kav accusations says to young men, Trump repeats sympathy for men accused, nothing for women. "Honestly it's a very dangerous period in our country. It's being perpetrated by some very evil people...it's a con game. It's at the highest level."
"They weren't laughing at me; they were laughing with me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together," Trump, when asked about world leaders laughing yesterday when he said his administration had done more than any other in history.
Correction, Clinton won 54% of women voters. Trump won 41%.
"Women are very angry" about the accusations against Kavanaugh, says Trump, contending he got 52% of the women vote. (He didn't; Clinton won 53% of women. Trump won 52% of white women, per exit polls.)
Asked if his "con job" comments are insensitive to women listening to him, Trump maintains: "It is, it's a con job by the Democrats, they know it." He  says he has used a lot worse words in the past.
Asked whether he will fire Rod Rosenstein tomorrow, Trump immediately brings up the Russia investigation. Similar to the Comey-firing excuse given to NBC's Lester Holt.
"I've had a lot of false charges made against me...I knew friends than have had false charges. So when I see it, I see it differently," Trump, saying that his thinking on Kavanaugh is "absolutely" affected by his own experience of being accused of sexual misbehavior.
"It's not the benefit of the doubt...I've known them for a long time a lot of these people. Some I've been disappointed with...I never saw them do anything wrong," Trump says of the men he has supported despite multiple claims of sexual harassment and assault from women.
Trump, who minutes ago called accusations against Kavanaugh a "con job," now says of Thursday's Senate Judiciary hearing: "You know what? I could be persuaded also."
Why is it that you always seem to side with the accused not the accuser? Trump: "First of all I wasn't happy with Roy Moore (he endorsed Moore)...whether it was a man or a woman 30 years ago 36 years ago...that's a long time."
"A big fat con," Trump repeats. Asked if he understands the delay by many victims in reporting an assault, Trump brushes that reality aside: "36 years and no charge."
Trump repeats the falsehood that Democrats "got tired" and decided not to appoint judges in Obama's terms. Missing the role of Mitch McConnell in stopping them.
Are you saying all three of those women are liars?: Trump "I won't get into that game...These are all false to me."
Once again Trump expressing repeated sympathies for Kavanaugh and his wife and children, casts criticisms of him as a "con job." Gone are the "she should be heard" tones he evinced before.
"How uninformed and uncaring to we have to be to say things like that, much less believe them? Do we have any idea what that says, esp to young women?"--Flake re Trump's statement that if Ford was assaulted "as bad as she says" she would have reported it at the time.
"We have lit a match my colleagues. The only question is do we realize how close the powderkeg is?"--Flake, after saying his family had been threatened. This speech is a follow-up, tonally, to his earlier anti-Trump toxicity speeches.
"These past two years we have tested the limits of how low we can go...winning at all cost is too high a cost."--Flake.

"He was ridiculed, he was ridiculed," Trump on Lincoln's Gettysburg address. "He was excoriated by the fake news...50 years after his death they said it may be the greatest speech ever made. Pretty good, pretty good. I have a feeling that's going to happen to us."
"You're going up the wrong tree, Nancy," Trump to Pelosi, re MS-13. Needless to say, a moment that seemed not to be on the teleprompter script.
"They're the ones honestly that have been driven crazy," Trump says of his critics, who he says have a "secret agenda." Says the NYT should publicize the name of the anonymous writer of the critical op-ed.
Trump repeats falsehood that NYT apologized after the election for its coverage, and then expresses shock at liberals and media he says are motivated by hatred.
"Is it subversion? Is it treason"? Trump refers to NYT op-ed about his handling of the presidency.
Trump to his fans: "We'll worry about that (impeachment) if it ever happens. But if it does happen, it'll be your fault. Because you didn't go out to vote."
"They like to use the impeach word," Trump says. "'We will impeach him!' But he's doing a great job." Then onto a riff about how if he is impeached, all opposite party presidents will be. Defends his electoral college margin: "We won by a hell of a lot."
"We had it done," Trump in Montana on the Obamacare repeal law, edging closer to his usual denunciation of John McCain, then swings into a multi-pronged criticism of Jon Tester.

‘Doesn’t involve me’: Trump distances himself from Cohen, Manafort cases, by @jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker	  https://t.co/PGXw8gJEDP
"The Republican party stands proudly with our courageous ICE officers and border patrol agents"--a Trump line you can get used to hearing a lot before November. "This election is about security."
Trump makes fairly brief reference to investigations--"Where's the  collusion??"--before turning to what he terms the beating heart of the  2018 election, immigration enforcement. Democrats, he says, would "set  loose vicious predators."
Trump mocking the Democratic assertions circa 2016 that coal miners should be re-trained to make "little widgets" and says they wanted to continue to mine coal. Which is, in fact, something that Trump understood about them better than Democrats did.
Referring to stmt by NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Trump: "So this November you can either vote for the party that says America was never great...let's give them a new theme 'America was never great'...or you can vote proudly for everything we stand for."
"You heard about today about the illegal alien coming in...from Mexico," Trump says, noting the arrest in the case of young Iowa woman Mollie Tibbetts, who had been missing for a month before her body was found.
"Is this Central Casting? This is what we want," Trump says of Brett Kavanaugh in a long list of criticisms of WV Sen. Joe Manchin.
"The Democrats want to turn America into one big fat sanctuary city," Trump, adding that Democrats would threaten the Second Amendment. For second time labels Waters and Pelosi as leaders of the Democrats. And now onto the usual denunciation of McCain.
"All my life I've heard endorsements don't mean anything," he says, insisting that Ronald Reagan's endorsements "didn't move the needle." His, he says, are moving candidates "fifty points!"
"We won 8 out of 9 special elections. Nobody talks about it," Trump says--not true--then moves on to his endorsements: "I don't want to brag about it. But I have a good record."
"I'm going to be going out as many days as I can and I'm allowed to," Trump says of the midterms, joking that he might escape without the Secret Service.
"Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp" Trump crowd chants unironically, hours after the president's former lawyer and campaign chairman pleaded/was found guilty of multiple legal offenses. And now, the crowd re Clinton: "Lock her up!"
Trump response to Gov. Justice: "He's a big man, he's all man. 6-11. I won't talk about the weight...I won't go there,"
WV Gov Jim Justice, onstage with Trump at Charleston rally: "We know what this great man right beside me has done for us. Now let me say this It's time for us to show that appreciation and deliver back." Crowd chants "Trump Trump Trump."
So the option to be expected is a campaign dominated by his insistence that he is being politically persecuted by the Dept of Justice (of a president who made him one of his earliest endorsees.) https://t.co/sm2It6At3j
Trump, per pooler @seungminkim, says Manafort conviction “very sad” but had "nothing to do” with Russian collusion. “We continue the witch hunt." He did not answer questions about former lawyer Michael Cohen's sworn stmt that he worked in concert with Trump re payoffs to women.

RT @DavidLauter: Notably, Putin did not deny having compromising information on Trump. He deflected the question by saying that Trump was a…
"You have just watched one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president"--@andersoncooper on @cnn when the press conference ends.
Asked if Russia has any compromising material on Trump, Putin says when Trump was in Moscow "I didn't even know" him. "Please just disregard those issues" he says. Trump breaks in to call FBI/Mueller efforts "a total witchhunt."
And then, having sided with Putin over US agencies. the president calls it an "incredible" offer to have US and Russia jointly investigate the Russian interference in the 2016 election.
"Who do you believe?"--Putin or US intel agencies, Trump is asked. He responds with conspiracy theories and undercuts US while standing next to Putin. Says about Russia interfering: "I really don't know a reason that it would be."
Such a dramatic contrast between Trump's dismissive/critical treatment of allied leaders, such as May and Merkel, and deference to Putin. Also a contrast w/Trump blaming the US for problems--as president of party that eviscerated Obama/HClinton for allegedly going soft on Russia.
"Isn't it natural to by sympathetic" to the candidate who wants closer relations with Russia, Putin asks. Then says he does "not know the full extent" of the Mueller accusations against his own people--but will look into it.
Shocker, Putin answers question about Russian interference in election by denying it. "Can you name a single fact that proves collusion? This is utter nonsense."
"I say it all the time, there was no collusion...you heard it all the time 12,14..."--Trump seems to be referring to Mueller actions against Russian agents. "We ran a brilliant campaign and that's why I'm president."
"The main thing, and we discussed this also, is no collusion"--the president, regarding what he and the president of Russia discussed in their nearly two hour meeting today.
Asked if he holds Russia responsible for anything, Trump says he holds both countries responsible. "We have both made some mistakes," he says, and calls the Mueller probe a disaster. This while standing next to Putin, whose country interfered in the US election.
Trump, in brief comment about Russian interference, says Putin has an "interesting idea" about it. This after Putin spoke of a joint cybersecurity effort. Fox/henhouse analogies abound.
From the podium of his press conference with Putin, Trump criticizes Democrats and the media, and seems deferential to Putin on the matter of interference in the 2016 campaign, which is asserted by US intelligence agencies.

The time Trump has spent on immigration/the wall/crime compared to tax cuts tells you everything about what he thinks will move his voters in November.

Trump's theory of the border mess: "You have to stand for something. You have to stand for safety and security of our country...We gotta stop separation of the families but...(the country) needs to be protected." His is the policy that separated the families; no acknowledgement.
"I was never a deep state guy"--Trump. Hmm.
"They game the system, they game it," Trump says of would-be asylum seekers. Interesting juxtaposition of rhetoric and the images of crying women and children at the border.
If a person comes to America and "puts one foot on the ground" they're let into the country, Trump says. Which is how Republicans have long wanted Cuba's immigration policy to work.
Trump again equating immigrants with criminals, saying that when they enter the country murders etc will be the result. And now, too, falsely saying that visa applicants are dumped on US by their countries.
As he has in past days, Trump is shifting from the child separation problem at the border to talk fears of MS-13, a calculation that plays to his benefit. And now he's off to the "graft" involved in hiring new border judges to hear border cases.
"They are helping these smugglers and traffickers like no one would believe," Trump says of the news media. "They know exactly what they are doing."
"We can no longer be the stupid country; we want to be the smart country," Trump tells business owners, reprising one of his favorite campaign lines on trade with Mexico and Canada.

Nielsen says she considers it "offensive" to suggest that deterrence is one point of the strategy, as multiple admin officials say: https://t.co/oUyVjXmu1s
Nielsen says the anecdotes gathered by reporters--including U.S. government pictures--are evidence of the intent of the media, not the intent of the Trump administration policy.
"It's not a policy" Nielsen says of a policy that was announced last month, with great fanfare, by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, and seconded by other administration officials including the president.
"I would reference you to our standards."--Nielsen when asked reaction to pictures of disoriented children and audio of wailing ones.
Nielsen casting this as falling under her agency's dictate to protect the American people. Hard sell given the age of the children involved.
There's such a huge emotional disconnect between DHS's Nielsen talking about rules under which minors can apply for asylum and audio tapes of wailing children calling for their parents. Legal talk vs human talk.
DHS Secty Nielsen insisting that the solution to the crisis involving minors at the border is to close loopholes with new legislation, as if the administration's new policy has had no effect whatsoever: "Congress and the courts created this..only Congress can solve it."

In disinviting the Eagles, Trump holds a celebration with more circumstance than pomp, by @AshleyRParker	https://t.co/iKWCTJlHjN
"This has been made a political argument" and the president has made his stand, Sanders says. More accurately: The president made the NFL protests a political argument as they were actually ebbing. (And Eagles didn't take part).
Asked why White House supports baker's 1st Amend rights and not players' right of free expression, Sanders: "The president doesn't think this is an issue...of free speech" and must respect national anthem and flag. Except the Eagles players didn't protest the anthem and flag.
Sanders calling Eagles' refusal to come to the White House "a political stunt" and a "political statement"--words that were not leveled at, say, Tom Brady when he declined to come to the 2017 Super Bowl celebration.
"Frankly I think my credibility is higher than the media's"--Sarah Sanders, following with criticism of reporters for criticizing false statements she has made from the podium.

BBC reporter re Iran: https://t.co/Autgr2tNBJ
Facing the limitations of the relationship he's sought to craft with Trump: https://t.co/rG8EOmHKIH
Trump now speaking optimistically about cutting a deal with North Korea, as if to buttress his argument that backing out of an Iran deal will not affect North Korea's willingness to enter into a deal with the U.S.
When Iran wants to craft another deal, "I am ready, willing and able" Trump says. In other words, there is no Plan B at present. Trump now signing paper with huge signature. "This will make America much safer," he tells reporters.
"The United States no longer makes empty threats" Trump says, casting an unspoken comparison to Obama's red line in Syria. @potus also announces that Sec State Pompeo is en route to North Korea for negotiations leading up to proposed summit between Trump/Kim Jong Un.
Trump announces U.S. is out of the deal and resuming sanctions. This is another circumstance in which U.S. policy is now "go it alone"  as opposed to joining in global efforts. Similar: trade deals, NAFTA,  Paris climate deal.
This is another circumstance in which U.S. policy is now "go it alone" as opposed to joining in global efforts. Similar: trade deals, NAFTA, Paris climate deal.
"If I allowed this deal to stand there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East" Trump says. That, of course, was the point of the deal.
"At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction" that the country violated the deal. Trump citing Israeli intel released last week--which U.S. officials said was not new. U.S. position has remained that Iran abided by the deal.
Now criticizing the deal itself, not (yet anyway) arguing that Iran has violated the deal. Top administration officials have said recently that Iran has abided by the deal crafted during the Obama administration.
"The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror"-- Trump opening expected announcement of U.S. pulling out of Iran nuclear deal by outlining their "long reign of chaos and terror."

Interesting Trump quote today, given the controversies roiling around him, as he discussed Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf's warning to residents about ICE raids: "Let me tell you, that’s called obstruction of justice..."
"We take people based out of a lottery. You think a country is putting their finest in a lottery? I don’t think so."--Trump in Cleveland, again falsely describing system by which some legal immigrants arrive in this country. Countries don't determine lottery; applicants vetted.
A wonderful, moving piece @jmartNYT : https://t.co/i1zsq1XkQk
Less than 3 months after he upbraided Congress as being submissive to the NRA and suggested limits to semi-automatic weapons, Trump tells NRA its leaders have "great heart" and leans on efforts to harden schools and arm teachers.

Trump isn't the only one saying Giuliani erred in his Wednesday night/Thursday morning discussions, which Trump now says will be clarified in a statement. Ditto Michael Cohen: https://t.co/osKzjMlOvt

RT @ElizLanders: .@catherine_lucey presses @POTUS:		Q: You said on Air Force One that you did not know anything about the payments.		@potus…
Giuliani had offered specifics: the monthly and total amt of $ from Trump to Cohen. Now Trump says: "Rudy had just started and he wasn’t totally familiar with everything...Rudy understands this better than anybody but when he made certain statements--he just started yesterday."

On other topics, Trump said that a time and place has been set for his meeting with Kim Jong Un, and that he's soon be announcing trade deals as his advisors on that front return from China.
So to recap: Cohen says he pay Daniels via a home loan. Trump says he didn't know about it. Giuliani says Trump repaid Cohen but didn't know it til recently. Trump says Giuliani was wrong and will issue a statement. Happy Friday.
"If I thought it was fair, I would override my lawyers"--Trump after repeatedly blasting Mueller's investigation as a "witch hunt" and saying his attorneys don't want him to speak to the special counsel.
More Trump on Giuliani: "He's learning the subject matter and he’s going to be issuing a statement too but he is a great guy. He knows it’s a witch hunt too." Says a timeline will be released of when he knew he was repaying Cohen for paying off Stormy Daniels.
"So Rudy knows it’s a witch hunt. He started yesterday. He’ll get his facts right."--Trump, offering two falsehoods and one TBD in comments about Giuliani.

Fwiw, on Thursday @SpeakerRyan batted down idea that @potus needed new congressional authorization for a strike on Syria: "He has the authority under the existing AUMF." /1
For all who know of a child in need of a sweet family: https://t.co/fxnJTLky2S
Recap: US, France and UK have begun strikes in Syria and vow a sustained response but do not wish an open-ended presence, President Trump says. Actions occur days after first tweeted threat by president, which was followed by multiple meetings with admin officials and allies.
"Tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies" and for the people of Syria, the president says in closing.
The Mideast "is a troubled place." America is a "partner and a friend" but the solution to the perpetual warfare there resides with the nations of the Mideast," Trump says.
"America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances," says Trump, who only days ago, just before the gassing, vowed to leave Syria.
"Assad's recent attack and today's response are the direct result of Russia's failure to keep that promise (to negate chem weapons)," Trump says. "I will say this: the United States has a lot to offer" with the "greatest economy" in the world.

Neither Secty Nielsen nor Press Secty Sanders denied that Trump's border action was spurred by a Fox News segment. They also offered no specific alternative rationale for the haste we're seeing.
Press Secty Sanders blaming Democrats for inaction on border issues. But the president himself threatened a veto on a bipartisan measure to build wall/protect DACA recipients because it didn't sharply limit legal immigration.
"We may have a little bit of short term pain but we're going to have long term success," Press Secty Sarah Sanders re Wall Street rollercoastering due to fears of trade war.
Striking that, absent any big crime/notable event, the border issue is urgent enough to send troops to the wall tonight, but wasn't a big enough issue two weeks ago to make the omnibus spending bill. Suggests another motivation.
Secty Nielsen not doing a ton here to put down the notion that the border push stemmed from recent Trump anger. Also seeming to confirm that Trump yesterday confused military with National Guard.

In explaining why he wants American troops to leave Syria, Trump repeats--twice--the falsehood that US has spent $7 trillion in the Mideast. The brief news conference is fact-challenged.

"Getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing," says Trump, adding that "nobody" has been tougher on Russia "than Trump." Then encourages Baltic leaders to praise his actions re NATO.

Trump on the effort of Orange County to fight the state's sanctuary measure: "There's a revolution going on out there." Then changes topic to Roseanne and her new show.
After a speech in which he blistered American involvement overseas and said money should be spent in the U.S., Trump now touting the digging of the Panama Canal.
Trump mentions $21 billion in infrastructure money that was in the spending bill "that you don't hear about." Including from him on Friday when he grudgingly signed the spending bill after a veto threat.
"Infrastructure week" has so often been thrashed by Trumpworld controversies. This speech is along a similar path, the topic of the day getting whacked by all sorts of other subjects Trump's more enthusiastic about.
"The road is no longer a straight shot, its a waaah....We're gonna stop that nosense"--Trump on permitting that protects nests. Says it doesn't help you if you are not feeling good behind the wheel.	This speech has EVERYTHING.
"Now the Democrats are trying to find out who the hell you are? You are hard working people. You work your asses off"--The president, still basking in the glow of 2016.
"Vocational schools...People know what that means. People don't know what community college means"--Trump. In reality, community colleges are also 4-year-college prep, not just vocational.
So far Trump is alternating riffs on things he seems to care more about with a tossed-in teleprompter reference about infrastructure and/or workers.
Trump basically concurring in Shulkin's assertion that he was fired for not privatizing VA care.
Trump calls it "a gift from heaven" that Obama left open judgeships for him to fill. More like "a gift from Mitch McConnell."
"If we kept the oil we would never have had ISIS," Trump says. "Stupid, stupid."
"We spent as of three months ago $7 trillion...trillion with a T"--Trump repeating one of his favorite falsehoods, re spending in the Middle east. "Any you know what we have for it? Nothing."
Trump's inability to stick on the subject of infrastructure without veering over to another topic seems to suggest a level of disinterest?
"Being a builder, we can all talk as friends"--entree into Trump's second paragraphs about the Keystone pipeline. (Company's boss didn't call him to thank him, Trump says: "We remember.")
And guns, school safety, the Keystone pipeline, healthcare coops ("It's a thing of beauty")
This Trump speech, like many, defies diagramming: brief hit on infrastructure, judges, Jerusalem, regulations, 2nd Amendment, and that old standard "Obamacare is a disaster."
"I hired the Teamsters...the workers got it and now i think the leadership is getting it"--Trump in union hall, omitting that whole Trump-Tower-with-immigrant-labor thing.
"I love the smell of a construction site."--President Trump.
Apparently over his Friday pique, during which he said he was considering a veto, Trump is praising the spending measure for  strengthening background checks/school safety, opioid spending, etc.
So far one sentence on infrastructure, the topic of the day, before a long Trump segment on not getting complacent before the November elections. Now on to 2nd Amendment.
"They’ve stolen our wealth, they’ve stolen our jobs...frankly our friends did more damage to us than our enemies"--Trump, in Ohio, in full campaign fervor. Complication is that tariffs can boomerang against companies in red states that use fgn products or export internationally.
Trump in his speech is touting the start of construction on the border wall, and twice cites pictures of construction. Factcheck: false. https://t.co/C9CIxHgfZf

Two Republicans on tv today showed why they were unsuccessful prez candidates: John Kasich flipping on his record to jump on march bandwagon; Rick Santorum saying march kids are asking others to do the work and they should instead learn CPR to use in shootings.
To end where this started: To transfer crowds in the streets into trouble for (mostly R) incumbents, people who usually vote R or who are stay-at-home Ds would have to change. And would have to consider this issue above others. Guns have always motivated Rs; less so Ds.
Another added thought: It's a mistake to think of this only as a movement of young people. The DC march was mostly families, tons of young and old. Not something limited to a group historically less likely to vote. /7
@defcon_5 @kimmurphy it is true that by registration they are far more likely to be independents than earlier generations. But their voting behavior is Democratic--which is what gives Republicans looking to the future such pause.
Added thought: Many protests are predominantly one type of people. Today's in DC was not. The young speakers, particularly, were multicultural. That is the face of coming generations of voters, and that too makes Republicans, whose voters are white/older, fearful of the future./6
As for Dems, the victory of Conor Lamb in a conservative PA district shows that the party does still have to be mindful in some districts of pro-gun sentiment. But the suburbs have a different political cast and there are enough seats there to flip House. /5.
Overheard snippet from a mom walking at the DC march today: We've told our kids since they were little to stand up for themselves and to speak up for what they want. Today is the remarkable result.
And what are Republicans in tight districts to do? Going left/center means angering the most loyal GOP voters who are allied with Trump. Staying right on guns means inspiring the anger of the newly-energized. Dicey to say the least.
The last big march--the January women's march--helped prompt hundreds of women to run for office, and tons more to vote. At the very minimum, today served as a powerful, remarkable reminder that momentum remains on the side of Democrats. /3
At least in DC, there wasn't a feel of it being a virulently D crowd. Many who looked instead to be denizens of the suburbs, where the November election will be fought out in House seats currently held by Republicans. /2
It's always hard to figure the political impact of a march--hard to say how many marching today would flip from R to D, for example--but the sight of all this is likely to only reinforce Republican problems in November. 1/

Who is happy in the Republican party after this? Base got teased with veto and disappointed when he signed it. GOP members who had his approval yesterday got publicly whacked today. Works for Trump's pique but hard to imagine other GOP elements are thrilled.
"I was thinking about doing the veto," Trump says, but backed off because of the impact on the military. That impact was apparent before his tweets; it was the central argument Republicans made while pushing the bill.
Trump is being very transparent here in the sense that he's veering between praise and complaint, anger and self-congratulations.
Democrats "did not want DACA in this bill," Trump tells DACA and Latino community. Which is flatly false--they tried to block the spending bill yesterday to force a new DACA vote.
A long way in, Trump thanks Republican members of Congress. "There are a lot of strings pulling everybody in different directions," he says, something of a 180 from his earlier comments.
President is thoroughly happy with House and Senate leaders when they slam together a tax bill (which like the spending bill few read). But happy to blame them when he's become convinced the Wall didn't get its due respect.
Trump's cabinet members are coming to the mic talking about the benefits of the budget, which sounds like what they or others did with Trump himself after the morning tweets talking veto.
Trump's m.o. with DACA is just to keep repeating that Democrats are to blame for the demise of the program. That cannot pass the smell test when he cut the program and, before that, spent years angrily denouncing immigrants here illegally.
A staple of Republican presidential campaigns going back two generations. https://t.co/oe6iQjhlSX
"If we end the filibuster rule, it'll end just like magic," Trump talking repeatedly to Mitch McConnell. Ignores that part of the problem for Reps was they were split and Dems were unified.
Back on blaming the Democrats for treating DACA recipients "very badly"--recipients, that is, of a program he cancelled.
Yes, Bill Clinton triangulated against his own party, but that looks mild compared to Trump eviscerating his team and Republican House and Senate leaders. "I'm not going to do this again," he says.
Trump complains again about the budget and then swings to the bill's defense appropriations, leaning on that to explain why he's signing a measure he wants everyone to know he dislikes.
Trump opens with praise for trade deals he says his administration is re-doing, as what appears to be the 2,232 page omnibus sits on a table next to him. He calls it a "ridiculous situation."

"I believe we've finally reached a tipping point when it comes to gun violence," @SenDougJones says. equating young protesters with civil rights marchers. (He prosecuted Birmingham church bombing.)
"The first obligation of government is to protect its citizens"--@SenDougJones, in first Senate speech, calling for pragmatic gun restrictions (after lengthy passage about his love for guns/hunting).

Trump is repeatedly mocking the idea of committees to deal with problems. Less than two weeks ago, he put the future of gun violence response in the hands of a committee, to be led by his Secty of Education.
"We can have all the blue ribbon committees we want but if we don't get tough on drug dealers we're wasting our time. And that toughness includes the death penalty"--Trump, New Hampshire.

Also publicly brushing off PA-18 race--and implication that tax cut isn't cutting it as a message for GOP--was Cathy McMorris Rodgers: "We have to be careful about making sweeping generalizations and we aren’t even in full momentum (on tax cuts)"
At times the public reluctance is jarring: Ryan today credited Trump with helping the GOP candidate finish strong, and would not publicly acknowledge the downside for Republicans that the president represents. When you're close to losing a 20-pt advantage seat, that's big denial.
The complication: Republicans need Trump to get out their base. (And no one besides departing legislators will buck him). But his presence also draws opponents in what seems more than equal numbers as supporters.
What that means is there is nothing, at this point, that can offset for Republicans the unpopularity of the president. (And they tried the usual anti-Nancy Pelosi argument too)
Republicans are doing a lot of "What, us worry?" in public this morning. But that covers bad news: on Tuesday their big legislative accomplishment did nothing to help a GOP candidate over the finish line. What happens in November? https://t.co/jbrE5sSnVg
