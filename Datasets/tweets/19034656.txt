Jay Inslee has been accepting donations for his re-election race for governor in 2020, but he cannot transfer these funds to his presidential campaign warchest. His gubernatorial campaign team has stockpiled more than $226,000. 8 more things to know: https://t.co/t3zE6OJkdP
@Publici analyzed eight years of workplace discrimination complaint data, reviewed hundreds of court cases and interviewed dozens of people who filed complaints.		What emerged: a picture of a system that routinely fails workers. https://t.co/W8sL5WYNtQ
Pictured: About 25% of Wilbur Ross’ holdings, part of a schematic put together by @AmericanOversight based on the Commerce Secretary's first disclosure: a 57-page document in a format designed years ago for appointees with much simpler financial lives. https://t.co/OQq0ixj5ft https://t.co/VLYU7Zfv81
16/ We want to hear your stories as we continue to cover this important topic. If you’ve experienced discrimination at work, please share with us. https://t.co/ZuJgcfDDr0?
15/ More than 3 years after he was fired, Jessup said he hasn’t recovered from his time at UPS. He can’t afford to see a therapist. “I’m still a wreck,” he said. “I’m still depressed. I’m still stressed.” (Read more about how racism is bad for our bodies: https://t.co/3ZM9h33jO5)
14/ Former Long Island driver Jason Jessup filed one of those lawsuits, alleging the company used discipline to discriminate against him. “I knew anything I did, if I did anything wrong, they were looking for it,” he said. He was even written up for wearing the wrong socks.
13/ Various lawsuits have been filed by UPS employees who alleged discriminatory actions including assignments, discipline, terminations, and promotions — ordinary business practices the workers said were warped to produce unjust results.
12/ It can happen in the hiring process, before an applicant even begins a job. (Take a look at this 2003 study that found employers were more likely to consider white candidates with criminal records than black candidates without records: https://t.co/wUE8sK0JUo)
11/ But most workplace discrimination isn’t expressed through slurs or physical threats. It can manifest in more subtle ways, like the assignments workers are given, the pay or benefits they receive, and the ways their performance is judged and rewarded.
10/ The evidence did not show “the conduct — apart from the racially offensive graffiti — was frequent, severe, physically threatening (with the exception of the nooses), humiliating, demeaning and/or unreasonably interfered with his job.”
9/ What they went through wasn’t enough to win in court. At first, 13 of the workers’ cases were dismissed entirely because the harassment they alleged wasn’t deemed severe enough to go in front of a jury. This is what a judge wrote as she dismissed plaintiff Ron Law's case:
8/ One of those lawsuits was filed by a group of 23 black employees at Austal USA, a U.S. Navy contractor in Mobile, Alabama. They testified to repeatedly finding nooses and racist graffiti at work. They reported seeing slurs etched into the aluminum ships they helped build.
7/ We reviewed hundreds of cases that were filed in court after they didn’t get resolved through the EEOC and interviewed dozens of workers who have sought relief.
6/ The EEOC and the majority of state civil rights agencies don’t reveal the names of most employers accused of discrimination or details of investigations. The Civil Rights Act made it a criminal offense for the EEOC to share that information with the public.
5/ Race discrimination complaints were among the most commonly filed and the least likely to succeed. Black workers are disproportionately affected. Twenty-six percent of all cases alleged discrimination against black people, who make up 13 percent of the workforce.
4/ To get a better look at the discrimination workers report and what happens to their cases, we analyzed 8 years of complaint data (about 1 million cases) from the EEOC and state/local civil rights agencies. Workers received some form of relief in about 18% of claims filed.
3/ Today, the EEOC has 42 percent less staff than it did in 1980 and a smaller budget (when adjusted for inflation). The U.S. workforce has grown by 50% since then. https://t.co/Awz6QrdHkn
2/ Instituting federal legal protections against employment discrimination in the first place took decades of effort and organizing. More than 200 fair employment measures failed before the Civil Rights Act passed. https://t.co/8BiJlQ1bbr
1/ The Civil Rights Act of 1964 created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to eliminate workplace discrimination. Fifty-five years later, thousands of people report discrimination annually, but employers aren't usually held accountable. https://t.co/RVs15ChHt8
A privately-run Texas detention center has been holding nine mothers with babies, including a 5-month-old, who have allegedly lost weight and aren’t feeding properly because of abrupt changes in the availability of formula, according to a new complaint. https://t.co/USOt5fuNJR

The bill seeks changes on the federal level -- read more on all these issues: https://t.co/G5UwrtlSS1. These issues don’t end there, though. More on campaign finance, influence and ethics in our state politics coverage: https://t.co/fXo8hNFXpz
If passed, will the bill make a dent in voting rights, campaign finance and ethics? What we have heard: public pressure alone isn’t enough. https://t.co/zfghBflw3Z
A survey from last December showed a majority of potential voters, both liberal and conservative, would force former members of Congress and congressional aides to wait longer before cashing in their government experience as lobbyists. https://t.co/XPr4vuRB7C
You can’t talk about influence with talking about lobbying, of course. The bill aims to address the revolving door of people who work in Congress to those who move on to lobbying their former offices.
Part of how the bill seeks to break the influence economy in Washington is through enforcement of disclosures. We took a look in September at how that’s been a messy process: https://t.co/BOYU4Bcfzi
(On the topic of FARA enforcement, see @Publici's investigation on how a Russian bank tried to lobby Washington officials): https://t.co/Sf4JIHbQwE
The bill’s enforcement angle seeks to more strictly enforce disclosures, such as the Foreign Agents Registration Act. https://t.co/u2V3SQ5Yet
3) Ethics and accountability: The bill seeks to fortify the ethics law in place and step up enforcement. That’ll be hard to do with a weakened Federal Elections Commission, though. https://t.co/3KfAfUBP6n
In the aftermath of a 2016 election marred by Russian online meddling, federal officials have grappled with how to strengthen internet political advertising rules to enhance transparency and defend against foreign interference. https://t.co/ElFAgP5aWo
Regulating campaign finance also means regulating political ads, which has grown ever more complicated by social media. https://t.co/ElFAgP5aWo
Whether or not the bill passes, change is still on the horizon: the Supreme Court in September upheld a rule requiring politically active nonprofit groups to disclose any donor giving $200+ when those groups advertise for or against political candidates. https://t.co/WVrRGNmYRo
Here's how we saw dark money play into the 2018 midterm elections: https://t.co/lH9bigWkzg
We’ve seen dark money boost candidates on both sides of the aisle, despite the fact that Democrats often rail against it. https://t.co/AEaRxl3Nae
The bill also seeks to address “secret money,” known also as “dark money.” https://t.co/dVmbJvDvmQ
2) Campaign finance: To understand why Dems seek reform, it helps to know about the Supreme Court’s ‘Citizens United’ ruling, which allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited $$$ on ads and other political tools. Our explainer: https://t.co/q09qraviX9
Ensuring voting access also means upholding election integrity, Democrats say. The bill seeks to address any threats to the voting process, whether that’s voter intimidation or threats from abroad. https://t.co/02KA40OKJF
This section also covers findings related to Native American voting rights, which we saw ahead of midterms was a major barrier in North Dakota: https://t.co/mdW6DLG0bY
1) Voting access. The bill seeks to revamp the voter registration process, making it easier for people to register and to vote through automatic registration, same-day registration and more.
Today, @HouseDemocrats introduced #HR1, aimed at improving voter rights, reducing the influence of money in politics and amping up ethics rules for public officials. It’s unknown whether any of its provisions will ever become law. But here are some major issues the bill lays out:

10/ There's a lot more to each of these pieces of the story. Read them all here: https://t.co/MkfcnMhTzj
9/ The boom in fossil-fuel production in the United States has been matched by a rush on the other side of the Pacific to build the infrastructure needed to respond to the seemingly unquenchable thirst for energy among Asia’s top economies. https://t.co/B2CFKaHRa8
8/ Pollution aside, drilling is an inherently dangerous undertaking, with a death rate nearly five times that of all industries in the U.S. combined in 2014, the most recent year of data. We showed how regulatory loopholes contribute. https://t.co/ZQIUmMcjkq
7/ The LNG up for export is pitched as a “clean” energy source, led by the U.S. Gas Infrastructure Exports Initiative, whose mission is to drive sales of American natural gas by pumping money into pipelines and gas-processing facilities overseas. https://t.co/Myvec0TQfu
6/ In Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas, oil and gas export growth means jobs paying good wages. But it also means greenhouse gases warming the climate, upping the risks of storms that, in turn, endanger those facilities and everything around them. https://t.co/q37CfYKSJm
5/ It’s been enabled by agencies like the Bureau of Land Management, which is making it easier to produce oil and gas on federal land. But in southeastern New Mexico, it can't keep up. https://t.co/uf4ivcEoTe
4/ Where did the oil export boom find its roots? Under the Obama administration. https://t.co/8Wouui7oKV
3/ Our research in early 2018 suggested a drilling wave and infrastructure-building already were under way. West Texas, for example, has become the world’s “extraction colony,” bringing jobs but also soaring water use, waste disposal and traffic deaths. https://t.co/dTpjGUMlnx
2/ The United States is producing more fossil fuels than ever and selling them to the rest of the world as climate change increasingly makes its presence known through heat waves, wildfires, droughts and floods. https://t.co/dTpjGUMlnx

A comprehensive review from @davelevinthal. https://t.co/OgvkWNxvpD
@FiveThirtyEight @actblue @GOP @levinecarrie @sarahkleiner9 @TheDemocrats @abalcerzak @lateshiabeachum 11/ President @realdonaldtrump may be facing Stormy seas when it comes to campaign finance law, but he has little cause to fear the @FEC — the agency created to enforce election $$ rules. Our @davelevinthal explains why. https://t.co/5eHccWwKEC
@FiveThirtyEight @actblue @GOP @levinecarrie @sarahkleiner9 @TheDemocrats @abalcerzak 10/ The nation’s wealthiest African-Americans are decidedly reluctant campaign contributors, almost completely ceding the rarefied rank of “political megadonor” to older, white men, this @lateshiabeachum analysis shows. https://t.co/htvdhqPSCW
@FiveThirtyEight @actblue @GOP @levinecarrie @sarahkleiner9 9/ @TheDemocrats love decrying “dark money” — political contributions for which the source of funds is a mystery. But that hasn't stopped them from using mountains of "dark money" anyway — @abalcerzak showed how. https://t.co/lZVc8rmgFl
@FiveThirtyEight @actblue @GOP @levinecarrie 8/ That time when @sarahkleiner9 uncovered a “dark money” organization, tied to a major electric company, pumping significant cash into an Ohio congressional race — in what a losing candidate describes as an act of retribution over a failed financial deal. https://t.co/ZKEcS4asoo
@FiveThirtyEight @actblue @GOP 7/ The madcap tale of a sanctioned Russian bank and its efforts to woo Washington officials — revealed by @levinecarrie https://t.co/a1ZlqckfBD
@FiveThirtyEight @actblue @GOP 6/ Following a @publici investigation into botched Senate campaign finance records, a bill was signed into law requiring U.S. Senate candidates to file campaign finance reports electronically, giving the public immediate access to campaign $$ info https://t.co/kAvVNzItPq
5/ A joint analysis of campaign finance data by @publici and @FiveThirtyEight shows that Democratic fundraising platform @actblue is handling more political $$ than ever before — and gives liberals a major small-dollar fundraising advantage over the @GOP. https://t.co/FOnzr2mDhK
4/ Reporters at @publici revealed that the U.S. government's system for foreign travel expenses is significantly more generous than the comparable standards set by other countries and institutions. https://t.co/lXZD14w2Cp
3/ The 2018 midterm election was the most expensive ever. Reporters at @publici analyzed big money in key federal- and state-level races to explain where it mattered most — and where, surprisingly, it didn’t. https://t.co/1yVNPFGoCo
2/ Trump declared the nation’s decades-long war on poverty “largely over and a success.” So @publici reporters visited communities where residents say the crushing effects of poverty and gov't neglect aren’t improving — they’ve gone from bad to worse. https://t.co/rAbxdjtN8M

Grant Oakley’s second day of work at Bluegrass Agricultural Distributors in 2015 turned out to be the last day of his life.		His tragic story is one of the examples of poorly investigated workplace deaths that experts are concerned about in Kentucky. 		https://t.co/QLwEw7vEbf
Kentucky is one of 28 states and territories that regulate their own workplaces rather than defer to the feds, which has led to varying levels of success and problems.		https://t.co/tZ3PTiUvdh
The OSH Standards Board was made up of a mix of safety and health, labor, management and agriculture experts, and chaired by the labor secretary. 		Now, the responsibility and power to ensure effective worker safety is solely in the hands of the labor secretary.
In July, @GovMattBevin cut some perceived red tape by eliminating a board of experts at the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health program responsible for approving and modifying worker safety regulations.
But this was all news to lawmakers. Seven lawmakers from the House and Senate committees that handle labor issues, when interviewed by @KentuckyCIR in October, said they didn’t know about either the problems or that federal audit.
A federal audit issued in August found the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health program had missed critical steps in nearly every single worker fatality investigation during a two-year period.
In the 2018 legislative session, a reworking of the state’s workers compensation system shortened the amount of time some injured workers can receive benefits.		The bill also contained limitations on benefits for coal miners affected by black lung disease.
In 2017, Kentucky passed legislation that allowed workers to not pay union dues even if they work at a unionized company and eliminated the prevailing wage, which had created a minimum hourly rate for public works jobs.
In his first three years in office, Kentucky's Gov. Matt Bevin has been rolling back many regulations that he says restrict businesses. Meanwhile, the state is under fire for failing to properly investigate worksites after an employee dies on the job.  		https://t.co/Tu2qBqXD0G

11/ “What’s at stake here is unfettered and unchecked control by CBP,” said Whitney Fore, Owunna's attorney. 		She said she's asking for information about how many other travelers arriving at Dulles may have been examined at Reston Medical Center as well. https://t.co/s3Hu98T5lO
10/DHS’s Office of the Inspector General reported last month that problems with training programs for new CBP &amp; ICE hires could present “increasing safety risk to themselves, other law enforcement officers, and anyone within their enforcement authority.” 	https://t.co/O3fNO9t8wE
9/ The physician, Owunna alleges, told him that he was sorry but had no choice but to conduct the medical exam. A CBP spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss Owunna’s case or others.
8/ After CBP officers were informed that X-rays showed no contraband in Owunna’s body, he was provided with a “discharge summary” and taken back to Dulles.
7/ His experience is similar to 11 other complaints filed since 2011 against CBP. The suits were all filed by women alleging abuse, unconstitutional overreach and invasive body searches. Read our story on that here: 		https://t.co/V8Cvr46ti7
6/ At the hospital, Owunna was told by officers that he had to consent to the medical exam because "doing so was the only way he would be released from custody,” according to his suit.
5/ From there, he ended up handcuffed, bound and X-rayed at Reston Hospital Center in Virginia.		"People in the airport were staring at me. I had tears in my eyes,” Owunna said, saying he was carried from Dulles in view of people.
4/Owunna voluntarily declared he had fruit with him, which officers proceeded to cut open and destroy. Then he alleges they spent hours questioning and searching him. His lawsuit alleges officers "insisted" on watching him urinate multiple times.
3/ When he arrived at Dulles Airport, CBP officers forced him into isolation, erroneously suspecting that he was smuggling drugs inside his body. CBP considers Nigeria a “known source” country for passengers trying to smuggle ingested drugs.
2/A U.S. citizen since 2010, Ike Owunna had gone back to his native Nigeria in December 2016 for two weeks to attend a memorial service for his late father.

For now, noncompete clauses will likely continue to bind workers in fields like in-home health care — and worker advocates will continue to fight them.
Republican Delegate Kevin Hornberger co-sponsored a measure to get rid of noncompete clauses for low-wage workers in Maryland in 2015 and 2017. He said he's trying to introduce legislation again. https://t.co/iDMB9vTkhG
On the federal level, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Chris Murphy introduced legislation to ban noncompete clauses in April. https://t.co/3LUgizy7xl https://t.co/W9vIMw5S2T
Legislation to ban or reform noncompete clauses has been introduced in: 	- Hawaii	- Maine	- Maryland	- New Hampshire	- New Jersey	- Pennsylvania	- Vermont	- Washington 	- New York City
The Obama administration issued a call to action later for states to curb abuse of noncompete clauses by passing legislation to ban them for certain classes of workers.		Only 2 states, Illinois in 2016 and Massachusetts in 2018, have taken action.		https://t.co/gX1a0rsSGj
A 2016 Treasury report explains that although there are some social benefits, noncompete clauses can have many negative effects on workers. 		https://t.co/xULuRZD9O4 https://t.co/mePfSxziZT
Many workers don’t realize they’ve signed a noncompete clause until leaving a job. And though many courts are reluctant to enforce overly broad agreements, few low-income workers have the resources to legally challenge them.
But after the recession, when jobs were hard to come by and workers had less leverage to negotiate the terms of their employment, noncompete clauses started appearing in contracts for low-wage and middle class jobs like hair stylists, security guards and house cleaners.
Businesses fear employees will leave and take valuable assets with them to a competitor, so noncompete clauses help protect those companies.
Noncompete clauses were usually found in executives' work contracts but now those restrictions are showing up in contracts for low-income and middle-class workers, which could limit their opportunities and negotiating power.  https://t.co/uEKINCTANg

All of this has led the U.S. to become a top oil and gas producer, rivaling countries like Saudi Arabia &amp; Russia. But the push for American energy dominance actually began before Trump came into office. Read @jiejennyzou's story for more.  https://t.co/8Wouuip09v
@TexasTribune The industry is also consuming water in an arid region at an unsustainable rate: Permian Basin operators used eight times as much water to frack and drill last year as they did in 2011. https://t.co/Yj0IYzowRj
Punishment is rare for companies exceeding air pollution limits. A 2017 investigation by @TexasTribune found that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality hardly ever fines companies when they bust air permit limits. https://t.co/gCWcas5sr3
Sites flaring natural gas are everywhere in the region. Regulators issued more than 6,300 permits from 2016 to May 2018 allowing companies to flare in the Permian. https://t.co/WVsBMQcY3J
Locals like Suzanne Franklin living near oil wells are reporting health conditions and difficulty breathing. 		Low levels of hydrogen sulfide, a contaminant in crude oil and natural gas, can cause chronic illness. In high concentrations, it can kill almost instantly. https://t.co/0Xq62GPqqS
While industry profits are skyrocketing, the drilling boom has also brought other changes to West Texas. Schools, police departments and hospitals are struggling to keep employees lured by better-paying jobs in the oilfield.
The U.S. exported its crude oil to only a few countries under the previous restrictions set back in 1975. 		In 2015, Congress voted to remove those restrictions. This year, the U.S. has shipped crude oil to about 30 countries.		https://t.co/YLfMQWYpfn
But there are major trade-offs — and not just for locals. Scientists warn this drilling rush almost certainly will worsen climate change by increasing the world’s fossil fuel use at a fraught time. https://t.co/ioSrJ6CW3s
In return for mostly leaving the industry alone, the state receives a lot of money.  Oil and gas tax revenue is up more than 50% this year.  The boom has created high-paying jobs for some residents, too.
There's a drilling boom in West Texas as the U.S. rushes to meet foreign demand for oil.		But the state isn’t tracking or policing the industry for issues like air pollution, oil spills, groundwater loss and contamination. https://t.co/dTpjGV3WM7

9/ Former Obama officials like Moniz may position themselves on the other side of the climate issue as Trump, but their deep ties to the oil and gas industry helped unleash American fossil fuel exports to the world—with no signs of stopping anytime soon. https://t.co/8Wouuip09v https://t.co/faIkfyLwND
8/ Now in a Trump White House, fossil-fuel exports have accelerated. In the past three years, exports of crude oil have shot up four-fold and exports of LNG 35-fold. https://t.co/PtdPIzboi0
7/ What’s good for corporate profits, however, may not be good for the planet. The U.S. has become not only the world’s largest natural-gas producer but also a top exporter of oil — a fuel that remains among the most harmful for the climate and public health. https://t.co/cQ0s8Ue6SK
6/ By 2016, a new global market connected U.S. drilling rigs with refineries in China and liquefied natural gas terminals in the United Kingdom.

4/ In 2015, just days after the Paris climate agreement, Obama signed a budget bill that included a provision allowing crude oil to be sold freely for the first time since 1975. https://t.co/CPR6grFALV
3/ Leading the charge within government was then-Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist with longstanding ties to the oil and gas industry and an enthusiastic proponent of natural gas. https://t.co/YvHZWhmeXz
2/ Under the Obama administration, change was sweeping American oilfields. Advances in fracking spurred the industry to pitch fossil-fuel exports as a “win-win” that would benefit consumers and enhance American power.

@TRACReports Under the Trump administration, the deportation net has widened. One week after Trump took office, he issued directives that “all lawful means” be used to deport anyone in violation of immigration laws, with no exceptions.
@TRACReports In 2015, over 80% of deportees were people who were convicted of a serious crime, according to an ICE enforcement and removal operations report.
@TRACReports ICE followed a policy of “prosecutorial discretion" during the Obama administration, which meant officials were less interested in locating and deporting people with strong ties to the United States if they had no serious criminal record.
@TRACReports About 21% of detainees had committed a minor infraction, such a traffic violation. 		Another 5% had committed an offense defined only as “other." 		16% had committed what ICE considers a serious crime, which can include selling marijuana.
.@TRACReports recently created a profile of detainees currently held in 217 ICE detention centers.		As of June 30 of this year, ICE was holding 44,435 people in custody. 		Out of this group, 58% had no criminal convictions.
Although ICE does issue reports containing estimates of deportees with criminal records, there is no publicly available data to cross-reference to determine how many deported parents of citizen children have or don’t have criminal records.
ICE officials told us there is no data available yet for 2018 on how many people deported have children who are citizens.
Between 2015 and the end of 2017, ICE deported a total of 87,351 people who claimed to have at least one U.S.- citizen child.
Beginning in July 2010, Congress required ICE to ask people slated for deportation if they are parents of minor children who are U.S. citizens. Answering is completely voluntary and that info is compiled into reports submitted twice a year to Congress.

Robeson County’s Native American Lumbee tribe is lobbying the federal government for full federal recognition that would open up additional funding streams to the tribe. https://t.co/fYPDmkz8F3
When it comes to advocating for their interests, Robeson County spent about $20,000 on federal-level lobbying efforts for “community facilities” in 2017 and has yet to report any lobbying expenditures worth more than $5,000 this year.
Averaged out, Robeson residents donated about 75 cents a person to political causes, making the county also one of the least generous in terms of political giving. With a $31,000 median income — barely half that of the average U.S. household — that’s not necessarily surprising.
Only about 53% of Robeson’s registered voters voted during the 2016 general election. That’s the second lowest participation rate out of all North Carolina counties. #NCPol
About 3,100 fewer people voted during the 2016 presidential election than during the 2012 presidential election in Robeson County. 		Residents said that drop can partly be attributed to the community still reeling from Hurricane Matthew.
Despite desperately needing hurricane recovery help and economic stimulation, Robesonians aren't trying to reach politicians through the usual routes of voting or contributing money to political campaigns.
Robeson County, North Carolina has felt disconnected from D.C. for awhile but after being hit by two hurricanes back-to-back, meeting its residents' needs is even more critical. https://t.co/07vSqjrr4m

In April 2018, detainees at a CoreCivic detention center in Georgia also filed  a lawsuit alleging that staff threatened immigrant detainees with solitary confinement if they didn’t work.
Both companies are also fighting allegations of neglect and abusive practices. In pending suits filed in 2017 in Washington and in 2014 in Colorado, GEO is accused of exploiting prisoner labor by paying immigrant detainees $1 per day to clean detention facilities.
During GEO’s earnings call, company chairman and CEO George Zoley noted that GEO is under contract to hold detained immigrant families, but the company isn't involved in managing facilities that hold unaccompanied minors.
The state of California is a major client of CoreCivic, a Nashville-based prison company. Immigrant detainees are expected to fill many of the CoreCivic beds left vacant by California inmates.
@ICEgov According to ICE data, from 2015 to 2018 the average daily number of immigrants in detention went from 28,449 to 41,836.
Both companies hold immigrant detainees for @ICEgov and are hoping to cash in on new ICE contracts, according to August earnings calls
Following President Donald Trump’s victory, the stock value of GEO Group, Inc. and CoreCivic recovered after the Obama administration's moves to reduce federal use of private prisons.

But change could be coming. The Senate just passed an appropriations bill in June that contains a provision that could put an end to Senate paper filing, making Senate candidates file directly with the FEC's e-filing system.
@FEC @AurotechInc @captricity In 2015, Sen. Jon Tester introduced the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act, but Congress didn't pass his e-file bill...  just like six previous Congresses didn’t pass the bill’s six earlier versions.
@FEC @AurotechInc @captricity Our analysis of comparable data from paper filings and data from electronic filings found 20% of digitized paper filings had at least one significant error, compared to 2% of regular electronic filings.
@FEC @AurotechInc @captricity This whole process can take nearly a month to complete for large batches of reports and opens up the possibility for numerous errors.
@FEC @AurotechInc @captricity Finally, Captricity digitizes the documents. But its conversion service partially depends on low-wage workers — some of them overseas — to enter U.S. Senate candidates’ financial information by hand.
@FEC The FEC uses software developed by a Maryland-based government contractor, @AurotechInc, to help convert scans into searchable, digital data. 		To do this, AuroTech subcontracts @captricity, a data conversion firm based in California.
The Office of the Secretary of the Senate electronically scans the paper reports it receives — which are sometimes thousands of pages long — and sends the scans to the @FEC, one D.C. neighborhood away
The vast majority of Senate candidates track their finances electronically. By law, they have to physically print, then mail or hand deliver their printed reports to the Secretary of the Senate in D.C.

Instead the federal government would have jurisdiction over those crimes. 		But when tribal law enforcement sent sexual-abuse cases to the FBI and U.S. Attorney Offices, federal prosecutors declined more than two-thirds of them, according to a 2010 @USGAO report
Because of a 1978 Supreme Court decision, non-native men who assault Native American women on reservations can’t be arrested or prosecuted by tribal authorities
Unlike women of every other racial group, Native American women are more likely to be sexually assaulted by people who are not Native American, according to a study by the University of Delaware and the University of North Carolina
More than half of Native American women have been sexually assaulted, including over a third who have been raped during their lifetime — a rate of rape nearly 2.5 times higher than for white women, according to a 2016 @OJPNIJ study.

Of all infectious diseases, those caused by bites from ticks, mosquitoes and other cold-blooded insects are most climate-sensitive, scientists say.
State and local health department employees may believe climate change is happening but don’t necessarily see it as a public-health crisis, surveys show.
Our story focused on exploring the connection between vector-borne diseases and climate change, but the majority of patients surveyed that doctors and nurses never brought up the connection to them.
Most patients said they lived in areas that had lots of ticks so it was hard to remember how they contracted their disease.
322 people in 36 states responded to our questionnaire. 		Some of the diseases they reported: Lyme Disease	Alpha gal syndrome	Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever	Anaplasmosis	Bartonella	Babesiosis

The 2016 mock convention in Virginia wasn’t the origin of this movement. Our analysis found that attendees had already sponsored similar bills in at least 15 states before coming.
The other nonprofit, Convention of States Action, raised just under $122,000 in its first year in 2014. 		Two years later, they brought in almost $5 million, thanks in part to one mystery donor who gave just under $1.7 million.
One of the nonprofits, Citizens for Self-Governance, earned more than $4.2 million in 2016, quadrupling its revenue since it began six years earlier. 		Much of their funding is not disclosed, but the Mercer family has donated at least $500,000.
The mock convention in Virginia was the creation of two nonprofits that paid at least $130,000 combined for 81 state legislators to attend the trial run.
Supporters of a convention of states want to wrestle back power from Congress. Critics worry about the whole Constitution being up for consideration.

So far, these are the states that have passed legislation or have pending bills seeking a constitutional convention. https://t.co/WCgFjSgx13
While Meckler said the mock convention was a strictly educational, nonpartisan event, for some attendees like State Sen. Norman Sanderson of North Carolina, the event was a turning point in his decision to sponsor a bill this year calling for a convention.
Mark Meckler, the founder of the nonprofit that ran the Virginia convention, said, “The vast majority of American people — left and right — don’t believe that Washington, D.C., is doing a good job representing them."
The 2016 mock convention in Virginia wasn’t the origin of this movement. Our analysis found attendees had already sponsored bills in at least 15 states to call for a convention of states, even before their arrival.
Any amendments must then win approval from 38 states to be enacted, so advocates say it’s unlikely that the process could lead to any divisive changes. Critics still worry that the process could destabilize the country.
The last time a convention of states occurred was more than 200 years ago. The Founding Fathers wrote that Congress “shall call a convention” for proposing constitutional amendments if two-thirds of the states demand it.
Two activist groups paid at least $130,000 to gather state legislators for a mock constitutional convention in 2016. 		Lawmakers in 27 states have proposed measures to hold a real one, which could result in new amendments to the Constitution. https://t.co/UZdBoNs26t

The U.S. immigration system allows people to ask for a “credible fear” interview with asylum officer per the treaties.
When it comes to obligations to asylum seekers, the U.S. signed on to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the States of Refugees.
Migrant advocates argue the practice is inhumane because there are monitoring programs that allow asylum seekers to often live with sponsors and that there is a solid record of getting them to appear in court.
The administration argues detention will ensure migrants appear in court, rather than disappearing while a hearing is pending.
