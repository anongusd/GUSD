Jamie Dimon: Don't like the politics of people insulting each other w/ @jpmorgan https://t.co/otnrpfH43B
@jpmorgan DIMON: "The blockchain is real.  Bitcoin was what the governments are going to feel about Bitcoin it gets really big.  And I just have a different opinion than other people.  I'm not interested that much in the subject at all."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "The American public is not clamoring for more government.  They were angry about the great recession.  They kind of blamed banks and they blamed Washington.  But they're also angry about the bureaucracy."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "The thing about the Democrats is, you know, they will not have a chance, in my opinion, if they don't have a strong centrist, pro-business, pro-free enterprise person."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "It's not whether Fannie or Freddie are national or public, it's what their policies are, and that they stay consistent and real.  If you want an amortizing 30-year mortgage, you're going to need something Fannie or Freddie, otherwise it will disappear."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "If they're Americans and they're patriotic;  infrastructure. Democrats, Republicans both want.  They both want it.  And, you know, to me, they should try to get that done."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "I don't like the politics of people insulting each other at all, from anyone ever."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "JPMorgan's economists estimate that had we done what I would consider the right thing, not going back to subprime, just opening up these requirements a little bit, we might have been doing half a trillion dollars more a year, a year."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "I think 4% is possible. Remember, the Fed also had to react to it, so it's not -- they're not going to act not knowing what's going on.  So if you have a strong economy, they'll raise rates more.  But the strong economy will dwarf when you factor high rates."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "I don’t worry that much about stock prices, the weather, the changes in the GDP because I want to have a right branch service, in the right location, every day"
@jpmorgan DIMON: "Some of the jobs we replace that are back-breaking jobs and you will always have the human element, you are always going to have people involved in the news and analysis"
@jpmorgan DIMON: "Technology is a great thing it’s why you know, my daughters’ kids are going to live hopefully to 100, 120; the air is better, everything is safer, now education gets better, we could do more things online you know, it’s – it’s a wonderful thing."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "Technology is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "Cyber is a big deal, we’ll be spending more – we’ll do whatever we have to do, that’s like you would do to protect yourself and protect your clients."
@jpmorgan DIMON: " The American public should think of it as a vast bureaucracy which is like sand in the engine and to reduce some of that, not rollback good regulations, not go back to the good old times, not – don’t put you know, we need to protect consumers"
@jpmorgan DIMON: "Regulation was like a fiction cost to society and it got worse and worse and worse."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "The fact is the competitive tax system is good for America and it will – some of it will be competed away.  It will be a very competitive environment so it will become a one-time benefit and not one time it will go up and be competed away."
@jpmorgan DIMON: "I’m actually kind of surprised that people say  noncompetitive tax system will be good for America so (in the world) if you go back 20 years ago, the world was almost 40%, we are 40%  now most of the world is closer to 20% and we are 40%"
@jpmorgan DIMON: "the U.S.  is growing at 2% per yr, it’s clearly accelerating and you see it in the household incomes, you see it in wages, you see it in jobs, you see it in capital investment and of course it’s helping the fact that the rest of the world is growing too"
