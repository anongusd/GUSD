@Bolic631 @a10sigh @EricDJuly @TalibKweli @GoRawYall Whatever the hashtag, my point was that two grown men physically intimidating/threatening each other via twitter is beneath all of us and needs to be called out as non-sense.

@a10sigh @EricDJuly @TalibKweli @GoRawYall #whataboutism is a mis-direction tactic and your point is not relevant to the point of ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù or promoting a fight between two grown men. It‚Äôs sets a bad precedence.
@EricDJuly A sock account? I had to google it. I assure you l am not trying to deceive you or your clan. And if you peeped my profile, you could tell. So just like you mad at TK for calling you a Nazi, you call me a ‚Äúsock account‚Äù bc I joined recently?
@CheesyBarbarian @EricDJuly I didn‚Äôt say Nazi. I didn‚Äôt label anybody. Y‚Äôall are awful defensive and quick to troll instead of engaging and asking why.
@TheRealHannay @EricDJuly @TalibKweli @GoRawYall Microsoft is dumb https://t.co/nx854aJntk
@EricDJuly @TalibKweli @GoRawYall Like getting invited to the White House by the then president to discuss cultural, social, and issues of injustice?

@pj_sullivan93 @DeannaChanele @JJLippold @realDonaldTrump So a guy a couple of comments up believes in 3 things. ‚ÄúThe president, god, and his country‚Äù. Presidents influence culture. It used to be just god and country and all of a sudden it‚Äôs this ONE guy that‚Äôs going to save the rest of us. ‚ÄúForcing‚Äù is strong, but so is the influence.
@JJLippold @realDonaldTrump You put the president in the same category as god? Hope you get to feeling better. The saying is ‚Äúgod and country‚Äù. Not god and country and whoever is in charge. That doesn‚Äôt seem like the right path to take.
