It is appalling and indefensible that in the name of ‚Äúchoice‚Äù leaders in our country now support infanticide, but Republicans are prepared to continue leading the charge to support mothers with life-affirming options and uphold human dignity at every stage of life. (3/3)
At the same time, woefully misguided opponents are saying that ‚Äúno one truly wants to abort a baby late in pregnancy.‚Äù If that is the case, then why are Dems lock-step in their denial of medical care to the children who, against all odds, have a fighting chance of survival? (2/3)
Watching the Senate vote against the motion to proceed on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act today was absolutely heart-breaking. This bill is about protecting newborn life‚Äîlife that is viable outside the womb. It does nothing to change Roe v. Wade. (1/3)

that considers only 1 of 2 people involved in an abortion. I‚Äôll continue to fight for the rights of the unborn, and I pray for our culture to realize their rights are not a threat to women‚Äôs rights. All life is valuable and deserves to be protected by law, not legally devalued.
And these policies lay bare the extreme agenda of the pro-abortion movement. Nothing warrants such evil and rendering the life of the unborn indefensible or permitting infanticide are no ways to ensure women‚Äôs health. These extremisms follow from a radical and callous belief...
These policies systematically remove the rights of the unborn from existing law, and the NY law goes so far as to revoke healthcare for babies born after a botched abortion. They fly in the face of the limits on abortion that most Americans support.
The Reproductive Health Act law being celebrated by pro-abortion activists in NY and VA‚Äôs Repeal Act bill supported by abortion advocates, pro-abortion legislators and @GovernorVA are horrifying indicators of the spreading of a culture of death in our society.

The protection of religious belief and practice is enshrined in our Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment.
The government cannot justify trampling religious freedom when alternatives to accomplish its goal already exist.
They ‚Äì not the government ‚Äì are the best guide for what violates those principles.
The people who serve in these ministries have dedicated their lives to living out their religious convictions
But neither religious belief nor practice ends at the threshold of a house of worship.
That means nearly all faith-based charities, schools &amp; hospitals are not exempt because they serve &amp;/or employ people of other faiths.
There is a very narrow religious exemption, but the federal government has consistently refused to extend it beyond houses of worship.

Why #SkillsAct? Because North Carolinians know more about what it takes to find a job in our state than Washington does.
Why #SkillsAct? Because millions of Americans are unemployed while skills-based jobs are still sitting empty. http://t.co/QaPbJHTdwH

#SkillsAct will help job seekers, help employers, and reform Washington. See how: http://t.co/ezM4LAeNYw.
Why #SkillsAct? Because this (http://t.co/Uo5WNwmm2N) could look like this (http://t.co/hD816W6n8Q).
Why #SkillsAct? Because community colleges can play a stronger role in preparing job seekers for skills-based careers.
Why #SkillsAct? Because North Carolinians know more about what it takes to find a job in our state than Washington does.
Why #SkillsAct? HR 803 ensures resources will be available to help all workers learn valuable skills for competitive jobs.
Why #SkillsAct? HR 803 has 1 flexible Workforce Investment Fund to serve as a single source of support for workers, employers &amp; job seekers.

Congress‚Äôs job is not to defend failure, and #Obamacare fails in its main objectives. Tomorrow we vote for #repeal.
#Obamacare promised to reduce premium costs. Families are already paying over $1,000 more for their premiums.
#Obamacare promised to allow Americans the choice to keep their current coverage. But 20 million are at risk of losing the Drs they ‚Äúlike.‚Äù
#Obamacare promised not to raise taxes. Obamacare contains 21 tax increases, 12 of which hit the Middle Class.
#Obamacare promised to reduce the deficit. In reality, it will add $340 billion to the deficit &amp; will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 yrs.
#Obamacare promised to spur immediate job creation. In reality, the CBO estimates there will be 800,000 fewer jobs by 2021 bc of Obamacare.
Why #repeal? Because ‚Äúa plurality of Americans believe [#Obamacare] will do more harm than good to the economy.‚Äù http://t.co/t1jCa3L0
Why #repeal? Because #Obamacare is bad for our economy and making it harder for people to find jobs. http://t.co/i9kFQ5Kc
Why #repeal? ‚Äú74% of sm. businesses contend that #Obamacare will make job creation @ their companies more difficult.‚Äù http://t.co/i9kFQ5Kc
Why #repeal? Because #Obamacare will impose ‚Äú$813 billion in new taxes on job creators &amp; middle-class families‚Ä¶‚Äù  http://t.co/i9kFQ5Kc
Obama Admin claimed w/Stimulus, unemployment would be &lt; 6% today. Not quite. Longest stretch of high joblessness since Great Depression.
