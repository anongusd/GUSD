@JaggerMickOZ @drwaheeduddin So if water temp rises by a degree or two Celsius, k will of course decline by a small amount(thus the lower solubility of CO2 at higher T,) but the dominant factor will be P in this equation. 20% more CO2 in the atmosphere roughly equals 20% more CO2 in the ocean, bro! 😀
@JaggerMickOZ @drwaheeduddin Mike, my dude. Since this is your pinned tweet, I’ve decided to help you out. Henry’s Law is the primary determinant of how much CO2 ends up in the ocean. It looks like: 	C=kP	Concentration = (Henry’s constant)(partial pressure of a gas)	Check it: https://t.co/gaVwCvbTCH

So I fail to see how air pressure heats the earth. Your thoughts?

@WasteManagement What is also in dispute is this: WM charges essentially a full month’s worth of fees to pick up the totes and dumpsters at the conclusion of the contract, which I found to be heavy-handed. I even offered to have my associates deliver those items to WM- WM declined.

@ElliottRHams (It’s also wrong for a whole host of other reasons, but there really is no need to go further than a simple fact- innocent people will lose their lives because of it, period.)
@ElliottRHams It is an impossibility- and that’s the point. I respect your staunch belief- but recognizing the impossibility of perfection is acknowledging that innocents will die under the status quo. It is the status quo which must change. Capital punishment is wrong BECAUSE it’s imperfect.
@ElliottRHams But zero error is an impossibility. Who suffers? Some random guy who was wrongly accused? What if that guy is one of your family members? I’m sure you’d feel differently about an imperfect system then. Someone wrongly accused &amp; murdered is/was our brother. WE bear responsibility.
@ElliottRHams It’s a bit late- I’ve enjoyed our discussion. I hope you’ll see that no system is perfect, and imperfection in capital punishment is unacceptable- rendering capital punishment unacceptable due to its finality. 	One wrong execution should’ve stopped the whole charade.
@ElliottRHams Interesting. You mention that “some reforms will make that more plausible.” This suggests that you find some rate of error acceptable, though you start the tweet by suggesting no rate of error is acceptable. Logically, there’s a problem here, wouldn’t you agree?
@ElliottRHams Thank you for responding. I’m more curious about how you feel on an acceptable rate of error in capital punishment cases- I’ve linked my initial question here. Looks like I have to up the quality of my tweets! 😢		https://t.co/lhS6VGOITq

@ElliottRHams @jdwilson909 If you believe no innocent man may be executed, then you expect our criminal justice system to have an error rate of zero, which is simply impossible.
@ElliottRHams @jdwilson909 What rate of error is acceptable to you? Is it worth it to execute 1 innocent man so that 1,000 men guilty of capital crimes may be executed? Or should the ratio be 1:10,000? 1:1,000,000?

@billmckibben @BilldeBlasio (Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would be an added perk, but I don’t want to offend anyone or be called a hippie.)
@billmckibben @BilldeBlasio Plug and play LED solutions exist to replace these lights, cutting electrical use by 40% in the T8 case, and 50% in the T12 case. If DiBlasio were a leader- he’d get on that to improve light quality, longevity, and reduce operating costs. IMHO!	2/2.
@billmckibben @BilldeBlasio Bill, I’m a huge fan of yours, but look at these two pics I just took. The majority of NYC’s subway stations are lit by T8 fluorescent tubes from the 80s(or prior?) the “modern” 2nd Ave subway and subway interiors are lit by T12. 1/2 https://t.co/NSlmH8RE93

@Sandon_72 Maybe because law enforcement didn’t have enough evidence to raid her house? I don’t get it- I thought you said the court of public opinion wasn’t a valid indicator of guilt- but you’re suggesting you know more than law enforcement about Hillary’s actions?
@Sandon_72 @ReaganBattalion @realDonaldTrump No, I’d say it’s not the new courtroom. The Right used to call Hillary “crooked” without any indictments. When challenged, they’ll fall back on, “everyone knows she’s guilty.” 	But suddenly the Right is all about due process? Sorry, life doesn’t work that way.

@Fk__45 The faster something recedes from us, the more its light is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. So stars that are very far away appear redder than they would were we in the same frame of reference.	The further out we look, the redder the universe gets.

@SenThomTillis @MartinHeinrich @RepRichHudson @GKButterfield Only a politician could pat themselves on the back for this. This change is a national disgrace, Thom.
@SenThomTillis @MartinHeinrich @RepRichHudson @GKButterfield LED bulbs should’ve been mandated years ago in ceiling fans. With your legislation, you’ll allow ceiling fan makers to push out 15 million sets of hot incandescent bulbs(1800’s technology) next year which will heat up users instead of cooling them.
@SenThomTillis @MartinHeinrich @RepRichHudson @GKButterfield You could’ve moved the motor energy efficiency requirement up to 2019 instead of pushing the light bulb requirement back a year, Thom. 	You know, it’s a miracle that I can remain civil when I see stuff like this.

@AltScalesOfJust @documentcloud Let’s say he has $500 million in assets, and $400 million in debts. Don’t you think Russia could get some favorable policies enacted for themselves if they promised to wipe out $200 million of J-dog’s debts? I do. 666 5th Ave is a looming problem for Jared-
@AltScalesOfJust @documentcloud I have a different opinion on the importance of Jared’s debt relative to his assets. Even if his assets are much larger than his debts, he’s likely very greedy, thus still susceptible to influence. For example-

@JeffFlake @hiattf You talk a good game, Jeff. But you enable our traitor-in-Chief who failed to enact the Russia sanctions you- and 97 other US Senators- voted for. 		Your response, as far as I can tell? Tweeting.
@MVOhanesian (PS-at least the GOP tax scam allows fat cats to write off their private jets, &amp; maintains the BS ‘carried interest’ kiss so hedge fund managers can pay a lower rate than their secretaries. Even though Dump promised he wouldn’t do that. If I had a dime for every Dump promise...)
@MVOhanesian But even during the Reagan Era, Ron’s tax overhaul had bipartisan input and over two YEARS of hearings and public opinion. 	The💩-Tax-Scam passed by the GOP was unpopular and passed under cover of darkness and against the popular will. Really, it was just f’ing disgusting.
@MVOhanesian The GOP Tax Scam, slanted towards the rich, is just trickle down economics all over again. It failed during the Reagan Era(which saw persistent 8% unemployment,) but GOP donors have brainwashed Repubs via Fox “News” to think otherwise- or not at all.
@MVOhanesian Yes, but in the worst way possible. A rising stock market primarily benefits the already rich- their incremental extra💵generally stays in their bank accounts. When tax plans favor the lower and middle classes, those dollars end up being recycled back into the economy many times.

@FoxNews @RajShah45 And notice how Democrats introduced a bill to stop paying Congress members in the event of a shutdown? Wonder where Mendacious Mitch will stand on that...	https://t.co/KqJfecnMm8
@FoxNews @RajShah45 But why is the GOP so comfortable taking pay away from military families? The Democrats suggested a way to fix that...McConnell objected. Playing politics with our military- SAD!!!		https://t.co/pHrDwf36xC

@KamVTV @cspan But didn’t you say trump brought about shutdowns to make the Democrats work? Maybe the Dems are shutting things down to make the Republicans work? Hmm, where did I see that tweet?
Here’s the answer! No peeking...vote first please 😉 	https://t.co/iNVdL6GR8n
Who said: “When they talk about the government shutdown, they’re going to be talking about the president of the United States, who the president was at that time.”
@rep_stevewomack How did you feel about Graham’s “no” vote? Lee? Flake? Paul? You’re cool with those “no” votes, huh?	Wonder why? 🤔🤔🤔🤔		Womack:	       👇	🤥🤥🤥🤥
@FoxNews On Dear Leader’s one year anniversary:	~The government is on the verge of shutting down.	~trump’s bribery gala at Maralago? Cancelled.	~number of coal mining jobs? Unchanged from Obama’s Presidency.	~Fox News viewers voted for change in DC- they got💩🤡	So much winning! 😂😂😂
@RepKevinBrady Oh right- so they could blame the Dems for voting against CHIP, when the GOP full well knows they tied Obamacare killers in their budget as well. 	We 👀 you.
@RepKevinBrady 4 GOP members voted ‘no.’ 	Btw- CHIP could have been reauthorized anytime in the last few months. Why do you think the GOP decided to tether CHIP reauthorization to the budget vote?
In response to the emergency shut down, will trump scramble his forces, unite the GOP and the Democrats, and really get to work?
@FoxNews @SenatorLankford Aww Jimmy. 4 Republicans have voted no. Couldn’t even scrounge 50 GOP votes. How ‘bout a “But Obama,” or a “But Hillary,” for old time’s sake? 		https://t.co/k0ibOgp386
If the government shuts down, it’s the fault of:
@FoxNews @SenatorLankford Shorter Lankford: “Governing is Hard!😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭”
@FoxNews @SenatorLankford This is the only time in history that a single party controlled the White House, the Senate, and the House, and the government experienced a self-inflicted shut-down.	Btw @SenatorLankford - you only have 45 votes from the @GOP. So, yeah- you can own this.

@steffanwatkins @KEKistanSupreme @FoxNews Very good points. Gerrymandering is a big problem. The EC is broken- it’s in place to stop completely unqualified individuals from taking office- it has clearly failed.	And every vote should carry equal weight.
trump is shutting down the government because America won’t pay for a wall that trump promised Mexico would pay for.		Let that sink in.	#TrumpShutdown

@stranahan Or- check out an interesting viewpoint in opposition to yours, like @maddow. She’s a bit far-right for me, but that might make her perfect for you. Thanks for reading, Lee.
@stranahan I found that last point interesting- you chose to mention rich Democrats, but failed to mention trump(who will be attending Davos too.) Why?		Try this as an experiment. Criticize Dear Leader a bit. See how long the Sputnik money sticks around.
@stranahan There were some demonstrable falsehoods in your show. McCain is older than Arpaio(he’s not- Arpaio is 4 yrs older,) for one.		Then some simple aspersions: some Muslim guy you referred to, stating he hangs out with Clinton, Schumer, and the Davos crowd. (Continued)
@stranahan Remember Carter Page? He was doing the Kremlin’s bidding unknowingly. I hate to tell you this- but I believe you’re in the same boat.	If you shout “fake news!” to discredit the legitimate media(like CNN,) then Putin’s gonna love you.
@stranahan I listened to your show. Question: why do you think Sputnik, an arm of the Kremlin, pays you? 		I believe it’s because they like what you’re saying, and they want to amplify your message with their rubles.
@stranahan I will take you up on that. I have some free time late tonight. I’ll listen and report back.

@justjudee @MDHolly @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Or maybe it’s because removing the Obamacare mandate will increase health insurance costs for everybody else? And for those who don’t insure themselves, their life expectancies will be negatively impacted? I could go on, but you get the idea.

@phillyrich1 @coffeequeen4lif @bigfatcatzeppy @sarahrstevenson Well, insurance costs rose 58% during GWB’s last six years, and 33% during O’s last six years.

@coffeequeen4lif @phillyrich1 @bigfatcatzeppy @sarahrstevenson Then your increase was way above average. Didn’t trump promise to make health insurance “so cheap you can’t believe it?” Huh.
@coffeequeen4lif @phillyrich1 @bigfatcatzeppy @sarahrstevenson Really? Because of potus’ actions, health insurance costs will rise 11% next year. During O’s last six years in office, health ins. rose 33%. So trump’s one year increase of 11% is faster than O’s increase. Is that the change you were hoping for?
@sarahrstevenson Dems get it. We also understand that bigger cuts were given to a smaller set of people, causing a $1.5 trillion bump to our deficit. You’re going to get a slightly nicer life- and ur kids will end up paying for it so that rich guys can keep carried interest/private✈️deductions.

@ChairmanLathan Merry Christmas? Stuff it, Terry. The people of your state were disenfranchised. They wanted Doug Jones to have a seat at the table and speak for them on this important legislation. They were denied that most important right that SHOULD come along with being an American citizen.
@nevadabrad @DeanHeller I’m honest. The ACA prevented insurance companies from dropping you when you got sick, and prevented them from saying ‘no’ to you if you had a pre-existing condition. If we go back to pre-ACA- insurance companies go back to being able to do whatever they please.
@nevadabrad @DeanHeller Really? But the GOP controls the Executive, Legislative, and Scotus- plus, campaign trump said everyone would be covered so cheaply you can’t believe it. Costs have only risen, &amp; fewer people will be covered. Was it just one more lie he told? It’s hard to keep track of them all.
@nevadabrad @DeanHeller Repealing the individual mandate is something which will hurt your insurance costs. It’s very simple.	But don’t worry too much- you can deduct your private jet expenses and if you’re a hedge fund manager, carried interest is still taxed at 15%!	So much winning.

@KimStrassel @AnnCoulter Hey, enjoy your tax cut while it lasts. trump is historically unpopular- the smart money says that in ‘18, the @GOP will lose control of both houses of Congress. Then, as usual, the Democrats will come in and clean up the mess left by the GOP.	https://t.co/j3PFQh2j9L
@KimStrassel But perhaps you’ll understand this from a different angle. The Right once complained about deficits- this tax scam makes our deficit larger to allow some at the top to become richer. Many on the Right disagree with this idea. Here’s one of them. https://t.co/GdXvjqmVQ3
@KimStrassel institute real estate tax loopholes that will cost over $400 billion over ten years- about THREE TIMES the cost of CHIP. So our GOP decided to give trump and his ilk a gift with OUR 💵, instead of spending a third of that on children’s health care. The rich get richer, amirite?
@KimStrassel When taxes are cut, as they’re about to be, government has less money to spend on certain essentials. Now we can all argue about what’s essential- I think CHIP is essential. Healthcare for all kids seems necessary to me. But, in a last-minute change, the GOP decided to (cont)
@KimStrassel Of course. The money belongs to the people. We pay taxes so government can do things that individuals cannot(like fix roads, strong military, air traffic control, prevent foreign nations from meddling in our elections, and so on.)	If nobody paid taxes- we’d be a 3rd🌎nation.

@realIanlong @ReaganBattalion Doesn’t matter to Democrats either way. If Moore loses, the GOP margin becomes even thinner.	If he wins, the GOP becomes the party who welcomes pedophiles- and hello 2018!	It’s lose-lose for the GOP. Kinda like what happened when trump won.
@ReaganBattalion He says(if my bad Russian is any guide)	“Hello, how are you doing today?” 	His Russian is lousier than mine.

@brandondarby You’ve had heavy moral questions? But you decided that since the propaganda outlet that pays you(Breitbart) deems it, you have to support the pedophile? 	Anything for a tax cut for the rich paid for by a tax hike for the poor and debt laded on our kids. A true GOP fantasy! https://t.co/M0YS0oegfH
@RealAmericanDon @brandondarby That’s the alt-RWNJ of today, comrade. They’ll go back 1500 years to throw a “but Islam” at you in the Glorious tradition of Russian whataboutism, solely to defend a pedophile so they can get a tax cut for the rich. What a great group of people.

@rachelstarlive @JohnSpacedow @bitofintelllect @JoGHern @SenatorTimScott By not insuring yourself, you insure that when you fall ill, society will take care of you in the most expensive- and least effective- way possible. In an ER, which you won’t be able to afford, which means hospital prices go up for everyone.
@rachelstarlive @JohnSpacedow @bitofintelllect @JoGHern @SenatorTimScott Rex, when you get sick and can’t afford your medical bills, you go to the ER. You don’t just sit at home and say, “Welp, I can’t afford it, so I guess I’ll die!”
@SenatorTimScott By which I mean- a family with earnings such as yours had- how much, in dollars, would this benefit them? Would they have availed themselves of the private jet deduction that was so thoughtfully written in to the bill?
@SenatorTimScott Tim. We all know this bill is for the donor class. But do us all a favor- since your family struggled early on, please quantify the benefits of this tax plan to your family(when you were a child.) Please do that before voting “YES.” Thanks.

PS: This doesn’t really explain why the RWNJ pundit prefers bullets.		My theory is that beating the war drum distracts from the @GOP’s massive failure to enact their promised legislation, as well as potus’ criminal conspiracy with Russia🇷🇺.	(Hint: it’s not working.)
Iraq has been costly. Trillions of dollars, well over one hundred thousand dead. Imagine if we’d traded with them instead? Made their lives better and ours as well? It’s said that “talk is cheap.” “Cheap” sounds much better than the alternative, which is “expensive as hell.” EOT
If we look back on recent wars, are we better off for them? Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam? War marks the victor and the vanquished indelibly, affecting generations of citizens. My grandpa was in WW II; the impact of his service will be felt in my family for at least 100 years.
When faced with a madman in a position of power, it’s easier to shoot first. But when you’re talking, you’re seldom shooting(on the Right, walking while chewing gum presents enough of a challenge.)
I believe it’s because bullets are cheaper than ideas. Any imbecile can buy a bullet and pull the trigger- good ideas, however, are only held by the few, and even fewer can convey those ideas well.

@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Shorter Ingraham- “yeah, Roy Moore’s a pedophile, but Democrats are guilty of stuff too!”
@JoeKahl3 @RickSau04879790 @FoxNews Example of a fact: Trump’s doing a shitty job.		Example of propaganda: The deep state is after Flynn because of blah blah blah...		Example of truth: Mueller is after Flynn because he’s a traitor. https://t.co/5U4wSDbyBr
@JoeKahl3 @RickSau04879790 @FoxNews Whoa, really great tweet Joe! 👍🏻 👍🏻. Of course, Trump is guilty of everything you just accused Obama of. And Trump’s killing Obama’s regs meant to reign in Wall St, soo... https://t.co/mVEPeGD7CY
@RickSau04879790 @JoeKahl3 @FoxNews Actually, Obama fired Flynn because he knew what an incompetent traitorous fck he was. And he warned Trump. But Trump is too dumb to listen to those who are better than him(everyone, basically.)	https://t.co/nrEOlx6QWw

@RepMattGaetz @AriMelber @MSNBC You are a national embarrassment. https://t.co/YLg6gTbIoO
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight LIAR 🤥🤥🤥🤥	So Shannon- now that your lie has been exposed- how about you focus on the pedophile who aspires to become a US Senator?	https://t.co/2DCOfJSfKm

@FoxNews @nedryun @dailybriefing Real news today for all you Faux viewers:	Russian/Turkish spy installed as US Nat’l Security Advisor plots to kidnap American citizen for $15 million dollars.		On Fox: look at these RINO’s stopping Trump! 😱🤯🤬
@FoxNews @NoahCRothman @HillaryClinton @dailybriefing #RoyMooreChildRapist is trending btw! And now this, oy ve Fox, how will the RWNJ’s get their pedophile into office!?! 😂🤣😭😭😭😭🤯😵		https://t.co/IwtxXItNyu
@FoxNews @NoahCRothman @HillaryClinton @dailybriefing SO FUNNY! If you just swap “Roy Moore” for “Anthony Weiner” and “Donald Trump” for HRC, this would become timely! https://t.co/dZzKCvFxAr
@RealAmericanDon @AlexandraMa15 @kristina_wong @alexjlockie Da comrades, so alpha! But I heard it took a team of 3 surgeons to separate Trump’s lips from President Xi’s ass. I guess it’s better than curtsying though! https://t.co/K268sow6Jg
@FoxNews @dagenmcdowell @NancyPelosi Hi Fox! Anything else going on today?	#RoyMooreChildMolester
@CarrollBryant @tpe3tpj2 @FiveRights You also may have missed that the incoming EPA advisor thinks the air is too clean? That kind of thinking tends to kill many people. He’s a Repub, btw!	https://t.co/cBRtnJSHQc
@CarrollBryant @tpe3tpj2 @FiveRights It’s also possible that you missed Trump’s actions which will raise insurance costs next year? One tends to miss that if Breitbart and Infowars are your “news” sources.	https://t.co/fM6uqId11L
@CarrollBryant @tpe3tpj2 @FiveRights Oh? I guess you haven’t seen the GOP’s new tax plan then?	https://t.co/fP7ECiFSzr
@FoxNews Fox, why is this? Why the different treatment by your propaganda machine? Thanks.	https://t.co/vQj0VxPKyI
@Constitutioner @FoxNews We’re getting there. Patience. https://t.co/aizUhXHpmd
@FoxNews *GOP guy
@FoxNews Such injustice, right Fox? Democratic guy who sexts gets two years in the Big House, GOO guy who is an in-person sexual predator/pedophile may be elected to the Senate!
@FoxNews But I thought Fox was cool with that sort of thing now that Roy Moore did it?	https://t.co/PBj54zRDw9
@shelgar63 @JacobAWohl @AmericanHotLips No, I think Mueller has a different type - traitorous Russian collaborators, mostly. Like these! https://t.co/rCI2MgF5mb
@RealAmericanDon @shelgar63 @wwweirdnews @BreitbartNews Da comrades. Only about 1.5 years too late. 	But at least now we have this guy! https://t.co/tNeAfTtcR2
@shelgar63 @RealAmericanDon @wwweirdnews @BreitbartNews Careful comrade bot. Twitter is suspending Russian trolls tonight. https://t.co/hgA0YWKqUJ
@ALGOP @MooreSenate Hi Alabama GOP! I’m so proud of your “who gives AF that he’s a pedophile” attitude towards Roy Moore that I updated your profile photo for you. YOU’RE WELCOME!!! https://t.co/u31R0dXIlK
@ChairmanLathan @ALGOP And now, you’re waking up to this. https://t.co/gq7RReOQcb
@jeff_g_59 @ChairmanLathan What are your choices? A crooked pedophile tossed twice from the judicial bench, or someone who is honest? Hm, tough one!
@ChairmanLathan Wtf Terry? You’re supporting a pedophile publicly? But still you‘re tweeting negative Hillary Clinton propaganda? https://t.co/NUsVBSdkIb
@J_Crespo16 @SenSanders They’re backing Trump because they can extract what they want from him- such as lower taxes for the rich at the expense of the middle class, and dispensing with regulations intended to prevent another financial disaster.
@FLGovScott @POTUS Wtf happened to America First, or was that just total BS? Any thoughts on accused pedophile and possible future Senator Roy Moore, btdubbs?
@GOP Senators when asked if Roy Moore should step aside... https://t.co/RdBZM0YUG6
@J_Crespo16 @SenSanders Goldman Sachs now occupies Trump’s cabinet. Not sure they ever were with HRC. Just more swamp that DT the moron brought to DC.
@charliespiering Charlie, you’re such an ass. You don’t see the slippery slope(I’m being kind here) that comes along with installing criminals into public office?	Go back to crying about Harvey Weinstein please, you dishonest cuck. https://t.co/fjlqlzu256
@SpeakerRyan Wait, aren’t you the guy who laughed about taking away healthcare from millions over beers in the Rose Garden? Trying to take another bite at the “screwing your fellow Americans” apple, are you?
@Phishie_Philly @Harlan Thank you. I know I’ve struck a nerve when a Russian bot accuses me of being a Russian bot. 👋 bye bye
@Harlan Lemme guess- you’re gonna try to pin this on Hillary or Obama, right? Putin boot-licker. https://t.co/kOwb91AgC4
@RealAmericanDon @EvanG1126 @joelpollak Da comrades. We’re so happy that Glorious Trump is such a strong man! He doesn’t bow like Obama, but he’s in touch with his feminine self enough to curtsy. So alpha! https://t.co/MarlQKPbhO
@JohnHMerrill @pacelattin Oh John. Once a voter suppressor, always a voter suppressor! https://t.co/3TsOMFaP0P
@foxandfriends Holy bat$hit! That’s like 10% of ONE WHOLE WEEKEND of Trump’s golfing!
Oh, Donald. The stress of Presidenting has become too great, I fear 😂😂😂 https://t.co/TeRUpSI44F
