Hey Jr, you gonna weigh in on Christopher Hasson at all? Or is it just too easy to beat up on Jussie Smollett all day? https://t.co/HElJ5AUCio
Instead of scoring political points, how about we agree that:		1. Jussie Smollett committed a serious crime and should face serious consequences.		2. Racism &amp; bigotry are still serious problems in America.		3. Jussie Smollett's actions hurt all REAL victims of racism &amp; bigotry.
My friend, this has nothing to do with race or sexual orientation to me. We should wait for the facts and the evidence to come in before we automatically believe ANYONE. That is the only point I'm making. https://t.co/jhRHFKKVwH

Trump's AG pick today said that Mueller is a stand up guy, it's not a witch hunt, Sessions was right to recuse himself, Russia interfered with our election, and he'll protect the Mueller investigation.		I'll sleep better tonight knowing he disagrees with Trump on all of it.
@PatrickGman You got that right my friend.

So, losing right now, Trump declares a national emergency, knowing it will get tied up in the courts for months (and knowing the courts will rule against him). He then reopens government without $ for the wall, telling his supporters that he's fighting.		He's able to save face.
Here we are:		A listener to my radio show emailed me: "Joe, I don't give a damn if Trump acts like a king. I don't give a damn if he steps all over the Constitution. I want him to do what he has to do to build that wall. Now pull your head out of your ass &amp; support him."		Ok.
So now he's considering usurping his constitutional authority by declaring a national emergency to pay for something that he promised us a foreign country would pay for.		And Republicans don't have the balls to call him out.

"Hate speech isn't free speech."		That's wrong. Dead wrong. Hate speech is in fact the very speech that the 1st Amendment protects. I disagree vehemently with what @marclamonthill said, but a public university can't fire him for expressing an opinion. https://t.co/tUfivufAvM
Perfectly fitting that George HW Bush's last public appearance on November 1st was an act of service to his country: Performing his civic duty and casting his vote. https://t.co/3ybuIKyqml
George W Bush, asked what people should know about his father: "That he was a gentle soul who took on the toughest job in the world, and remained a gentle soul."		#GeorgeHWBush
He belonged to a different generation. He was raised to never boast. To never brag. To never take credit. To never bring attention to himself. To never talk about himself. His mother taught him to never say "me" or "I am."		#GeorgeHWBush
