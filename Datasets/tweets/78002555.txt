But they didn't have to worry. After a few weeks in our care, Doug went home with parents and three pug siblings who already adore him! "He is my buddy and sleeps with me and my wife," said Doug's new dad. "I love him death." https://t.co/EMlmXbYts1
Staff and volunteers loved this little old man, but were concerned about his adoption prospects, given his age and medical conditions.
When 12 y/o Doug's owner could no longer care for her aging companion, she brought him to HRA. Our medical staff immediately noticed that he was mostly blind, he had lost most of his teeth and had an adorable underbite, and he was diagnosed with early-stage kidney disease.
Thank you so much for your support! We are so lucky to have supporters of all ages ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/TIVER7gAG0

‚ÄúShe's my Thanksgiving present, my Christmas present, the best present I‚Äôve gotten all year,‚Äù said Angela‚Äôs new mom. ‚ÄúAnd I can‚Äôt wait to get her home and introduce her to her new brother, Kibbles."
Upon her safe arrival back at the shelter, Angela was spotted by Ms. Perkins, and the connection was instant. After a successful meet-and-greet, a spay surgery, and a new harness, Angela was on her way home.
Upon seeing Joan, Angela walked out of the woods and became comfortable enough to be picked up by an animal control officer.
Our team got to work immediately creating &amp; handing out flyers, alerting the public via social media &amp; searching the area she was last seen. After a chilly night w little luck, the HRA behavior and training team leashed up her friend, adoptable Joan, and walked her to the park.
We were thrilled to send 10 y/o Angela home today! She came to HRA as a fearful stray, and while on a walk last week, she became spooked and wiggled her way out of her collar. She immediately darted into the neighborhood garden, across the street, and into a wooded park nearby. https://t.co/PFCR73Nilb

Snuggle Muffins, who has been renamed Blue, with his new mom Breeann! https://t.co/TodhImfOoi
For our adoptions team, the work was just getting started. We were thrilled to help Snuggle Muffins find a loving home with his new mom Breeann. "He has adjusted wonderfully and is just as snuggly as ever," she said. "We absolutely adore him!" https://t.co/B3zE81Krrw
After three surgeries to repair his head wound and months of critical care by our medical team, Snuggle Muffins was finally feeling better.
Snuggle Muffins, a former community cat who was treated for a large wound that left a portion of his skull exposed, is not only a testament to the resiliency of animals, but to the intensive, round-the-clock care our medical team is committed to providing to every animal.

@Nike We are thankful they entrusted us to keep these little guys safe and are proud to have a skilled team who knew just what to do when they arrived. The puppies, Nike, Swoosh, and Sneakers, were assessed medically,  bottle fed, and cleaned up before being transferred to foster care.
Our staff received an adorable surprise yesterday when a patron surrendered three 2-day-old puppies, safely enclosed in a @Nike shoe box.
