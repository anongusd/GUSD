@JacobAWohl Summary about cost of living in New York:		Four-person family monthly costs: 4,603.97$ without rent (using our estimator).	A single person monthly costs: 1,252.32$ without rent.	Cost of living index in New York is 27.99% higher than in Los Angeles.

@2sick4u1 @AOC @nypl Examples?
@2sick4u1 @AOC @nypl My opinion?!	The African Americans have been oppressed for years! Still are. They are harassed by police constantly	The indigenous people of the U.S. have been oppressed for years! They are stuck on reservations still to this day. 	Who are you to say there is no oppression?!
@2sick4u1 @AOC @nypl To say it was great depends on your social status, your upbringing, and the way you live your life. ALL of America was never great at one moment in time.

@KateLouiseWells @MichiganRadio Do you think there is any chance at all that MSU might get shut down?		I fear this might happen =(
RT @KateLouiseWells: This is huge.  https://t.co/Q6SmxPFMxk
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin This is getting so old.		Do you like Ben Shapiro? He's really pushing the whole positive/negative rights thing, I see.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin This is the first result for him.		https://t.co/K2W4hlA8le
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I don't need to focus on negative rights when they are just a given. No one is telling me to be a Christian, or else. I can say whatever the hell I want to, as you already know. I'm not a slave... even though you think I AM, because I pay taxes. Rights, schmights!
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Why should I use those terms? Both descriptions mean the same thing.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Did you know that both parties have done a complete 360 since then. When Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, he had recently created the Democrat party. They were the party of laissez faire, limited government, free trade, and hard money. Which is what Repubs stand for.

@Babobooey @Supersjwbasher @LGilloon @SBAList The Chris Madness post was reported for malicious lies
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin The kids were doing the "tomahawk" hand gesture, and mocking the Omaha-Ponca chants. That's pretty disrespectful.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin First off, saying "indian" is a racist term. They are not from India. Nathan Phillips is actually Omaha-Ponca, and I doubt he agrees with either party, given that both disrespected his tribe years ago.	The Black Israelites were VERY disrespectful. I agree.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin You are saying that by paying taxes, we are slaves. I get it. You don't want to pay taxes. Boo fricken hoo. Move somewhere else then. You are absolutely ridiculous. Our country would not be as great as it is without taxes.		 Do you want the rich to rule?
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 Mynah bird?! Where the hell are you from? Indonesia?!		That was a Muslim ban, and you know it. It was a ban on people coming from countries who's religion was Muslim majority.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Oh, so I should turn a blind eye to racism. Let them be racist, it's not hurting anyone. Right?!

@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 Religion is man made.
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 When should you be baptised? As a baby, to rid you of original sin, or as an older person who will know what's going on? Different Christian religions have different rules. They contradict each other.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Laws. Courts.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Unfortunately, I know a few. I live near some redneck towns.
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 I said they came here to get away from the Christian ruled monarchy.
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 You didn't answer my question. Which form of Christianity is the true form? Which one is right?!
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin If you seek it out, you absolutely can see coverage of those countries. Are you talking live feeds? What do you want to see?!
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I, personally, am not forcing anyone to do anything. I'm just saying that taxes work. If we didn't pay, we would not have all of the positive rights we have.	 I love how you are trying to make it seem like I am the one making people pay taxes, and therefore I am evil.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I've been a first time home owner for 6 years now. I saw no dramatic increase in my taxes. I pay land taxes through my escrow. Those land taxes help pave my roads and get rid of the snow that falls upon them. I pay less for my mortgage payments than I did in rent.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin The system works. It has for a long time now. As soon as we get a job we are paying into it. We haven't seen a dramatic change in payment amount. I feel like you just want to argue.  Stop paying your taxes. Go ahead, duder. I dare ya.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I absolutely do not think I am better than anyone. I've felt that way since kindergarten, when I saw kids being bullied.	That's why I volunteer for my community as much as I can. Like, right now I'm busting my ass shoveling snow for people who can't, and will be fined.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Then why say it?! Why even put that particular line? 		It's a threat, yo.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Our country has been run with positive rights for a couple hundred years now. I think we're ok.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Are they truly fighting against him, or the administration? Look at our administration. Some things get passed that the president didn't want, and vice versa.
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 Also, I love that your name is "My Own Truth". Sounds like Trump =)
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 What rights am I infringing on?!
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 What about Executive Order 13769?! That's the ban of Muslims coming into our country. Trump made a law restricting Muslims.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Oh also, is that last line a threat?!
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I wish you felt the same way about fellow humans. 		I'd pay extra for the health care of black lung coal miners.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin How about the option of not paying any taxes, but having a red mark on your licence, so you have to pay for positive rights on the spot. 		Yes, I'd pay even more for free health care. And dental too. Free dental. It'd be worth it.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin The reason it's an entitlement is because we pay for it. How do you expect anything to get done without money.	If we didn't have positive rights, the rich would rule this country.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin The racists people I see THESE DAYS are typically white Christian republicans.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I'd rather pay 10 bucks more a check for everyone to have free health care. Hell yeah. Screw deductibles, and family members with no health insurance.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin I'm more than happy to pay for schooling of our future generations, road and bridge construction, protection from crime and fire.		Yes sir, I pay taxes. I own my home.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin If no one paid for that stuff, it wouldn't be here, and we probably wouldn't be either because of that.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Taxes is used to distribute the positive rights.

@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Negative rights are civil and political rights, like the right to choose whatever religion you want, if any. Or, the right to say whatever you want. The right to not be a slave.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin Positive rights are rights that require action, such as, the right to be protected by police or military. The right to counsel in a court of law is a positive right. Public education is a positive right.		I don't think you know what positive and negative rights are, duder.

@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 Catholicism is a form of Christianity. Which Christian branch is the TRUE form of Christianity?	Mormonism? Catholicism? Protestant? Methodist? Southern Baptist? Jehovah's Witness? 	They are all different, with different rules.
@Myowntruth32 @ChristineRhyner @jodaka97 @LoriLNoel2 First off, religion is a tool to keep the meek in line, and to have the poor do the riches bidding.	Secondly, this country was founded in freedom of religion, and freedom of WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO.
@ShaunLeistikow @JTJ24 @CalebJHull @dbongino @kathygriffin The group is more so a social group, like a frat or sorority. It's not racist. And really, if they want to have a separate celebration, let them. They aren't attacking anyone.	African Americans deserve respect, because of the past disrespect forced on them.

@johnbeckham192 @Airbornex82nd @SweetKat111 Please explain. You can't just say she is crooked and not give any examples.
@johnbeckham192 @Airbornex82nd @SweetKat111 What are you insinuating? How do you think she became wealthy.
@johnbeckham192 @Airbornex82nd @SweetKat111 I'm not defending her, I'm just telling you how she and her husband amassed their wealth.
@iluvdonaldt Yeah, you can really trust polls. The polls also said Hillary would win.
@iluvdonaldt He completely disrespected Hispanics. All Hispanics I know hate him.		The whole "Mexico's not sending their best..." speech killed it for him.
@iluvdonaldt Doubt that. He didn't negotiate. He flubbed his "turn". He's still asking for 5.7 billion. That's ridiculous.
@NikkiHaley @iluvdonaldt @POTUS Tell president Trump he should reopen the gov't, and then sit down with both parties to talk about the wall.
@SenPatRoberts @realDonaldTrump He's not negotiating, he's asking for the same thing. 5.7 billion for a wall. We, the citizens, don't want that much money wasted on a "wall".

@goarrow25 @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official This was in England.
@goarrow25 @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official Why do I need to learn that marines stick together?		https://t.co/ujqg4kiiGa		This marine went AWOL.
@goarrow25 @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official =) How'd you know it was snowing?!
@goarrow25 @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official If you are a retired marine, why would you read a book written by a naval officer, AND why would you feel the need to motivate yourself for success, when it seems as though you ARE already?!		I improve on the things that I am interested in. I'm not trying to take over.
@JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official It pays people to protect itself? Protect a Culture of Life, not a culture of life. The capitalization on the letters makes me think that it's going right into their, and Jane's, pockets.		Be careful who you donate your hard earned money to people.
@JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official Where exactly does the measly 10% of the profits from sales go?! It says to "organizations that work to protect a Culture of Life!"
@JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official Also, you sure are in A LOT of their ads.
@iluvdonaldt @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official She says
@goarrow25 @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official If you truly are a retired marine, family man, and Christian, then why do you feel the need to be rude?!
@goarrow25 @JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official It was really good, too! Especially the first story about the mormons.		The book I'm reading now is AMAZING!!!
@JessieJaneDuff @COL1972official If it were a lie, you should have just ignored the ignorance, especially with you being "famous" and all. BUT, instead you deny the claim, which raises eyebrows, and makes the it seem true. 		Hmmm...
@johnbeckham192 @Airbornex82nd @SweetKat111 She and her husband have done real estate for years. Even before her involvement in politics.
@Faye2017world @johnbeckham192 @Airbornex82nd @SweetKat111 Sounds like Trump to me.

@JohnnyB371 @MSNBC @CNN This is coming from Breitbart news. The father of spinning political webs twisted with lies and stretched truths.
@ssdoggylove123 @Trump454545 @SweetKat111 The body slamming actually happened. It's one thing to call a person a "killer", but if they actually killed someone, that's a lil messed up.
@ssdoggylove123 @Trump454545 @SweetKat111 Liberals are full of hate? I think the "get over it" phrase is filled with hate.	Try acceptance, not calling people "snowflakes", or telling them to "get over it".

@buildthatwall45 @PanamaRoxy @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Those ARE my researched facts. If you pull info from .gov and .edu sites you are more likely to get the truth. Also, the kim jing thing was even brouhht up at the whitehouse. Thats why they delayed the next meeting with Trump
