Then again, I wonder if the Lions would be willing to swap picks w/ a team from 2-5 who either aren‚Äôt or may not be interested in Murray, if the Cards don‚Äôt take him. If a team is willing to fall back to a spot behind the Lions, then they should be willing to fall to 8th as well.
I could see either the Cards w/ their 1st pick, the Raiders, the Bucs, or the Jags taking him. The Giants will probably take Haskins at 6. The teams at 9+ who are desperate enough for a qb that they could trade ahead for him: Broncos, Bengals, Dolphins, Redskins. He won‚Äôt go 8.
Then again, the chances that Murray will slide to 8th are slim-to-none. There‚Äôs only one other top qb in this class &amp; there‚Äôs more than one team in the first 7 who either need one or could draft Murray even if they don‚Äôt.

Considering how much attention those comments and her apology received, how can the media not cover her complete walkback from the apology? How can they not cover her latest anti-Semitism scandal? How can they not ask Democrats, esp. those running for president, about this?
Seriously, the video is 10 minutes long. She doesn‚Äôt show an ounce of remorse for what she said. She does nothing but defend herself and her comments (while using anti-Semitic tropes to do so). She‚Äôs not sorry.
Worth mentioning that as Omar went on her latest anti-Semitic rant in defense of her previous anti-Semitic rant - for which she supposedly ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù apologized - @RepRashida, also a fan of the duel-loyalty smear, was sitting right next to her. https://t.co/Cq4VxVgSUr

‚ÄúDo you believe that the Obama administration ‚Äòresetting‚Äô relations with Russia to before their invasion of Georgia and the poisoning of a former spy in the UK, &amp; eliminating our missile-defense system in Eastern Europe was a sign to Putin that Obama could be easily manipulated?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think Putin‚Äôs reaction was listening to the American President running for re-election say that Russia had changed, that they were no longer an adversary, and that his opponent was stuck in the past for thinking differently?‚Äù
With that said, as Obama‚Äôs veep, Buden owns everything that happened between 09-17. So he better fucking be asked about Obama‚Äôs appeasement policy on Russia and the decision of Obama‚Äôs re-election campaign to attack Romney for calling Russia our #1 geopolitical foe.

@Peace4all17 @freep https://t.co/iK0J8f8WDr

@Olivianuzzi Is it really an ‚Äúimpossibly high standard‚Äù to not publish an article that prompts calls for the president to be impeached and turns out to be full of shit?

@daffodil139 @freep And it‚Äôs especially important as some people online are using the media‚Äôs reporting to justify a campaign to doxx the students and get them expelled.
@daffodil139 @freep Fair enough, but it doesn‚Äôt justify the media getting the story wrong. There‚Äôs a gulf btwn kids acting immature and kids targeting an individual b/c of their race, surrounding him, and making him feel unsafe w/ taunts and jeers.
@guypbenson It‚Äôs more than possible that the kids didn‚Äôt conduct themselves appropriately, but w/e the reality is, it‚Äôs miles away from the media-constructed version. They wanted to shift the narrative away from the anti-Semitism in the Women‚Äôs March. And they‚Äôll do w/e necessary to do that.
@guypbenson Doesn‚Äôt matter. Media has their narrative and they won‚Äôt let anything get in their way. Phillips is already a victim who you dare not question lest the outrage mob come for you. https://t.co/4bulvQ68Cq

Since I was 11, Michigan has lost the last two games of the year 9 times. They've missed a bowl game as many times as they've won them. The team crumbles against any opponent who's above average. Harbaugh is not worth how much he's getting.

The team's playing so poorly that you would think their game plan was that if OSU started to win, lose big so that they can go to the playoffs and maybe Michigan can go to the Rose Bowl.
Even more sickening is how the sports media has absolutely retconned what happened regarding Courtney Smith to portray Meyer as the victim of that story and making it a part of this hero's journey narrative that they've created of him overcoming that and his "health challenges."
"If Michigan is ever going to beat OSU, this is the year." 		OSU struggled to barely beat awful teams all year. Their defense was beyond pathetic. Michigan played very well all season. 10-game winning streak. And they're down 41-19. How much does @CoachJim4UM get paid again?
Welp. I guess this was a fraudulent season. Harbaugh and, especially, Don Brown are overrated. Team didn't arrive in Columbus ready to play and it shows. Mental mistakes killing them and an OSU squad that looked pathetic over the last few months now look like world-beaters.

The Lions has no business winning that game. Outgained by over 250 yards. 30 first downs to 18. But I‚Äôll take it.
And the refs blow it. McCaffrey didn‚Äôt get the first. Cam spiked it on 4th down.
And the Giants totally redeem themselves!
That has to be a historically bad performance by a kicker. Especially in a dome!
He missed. Again. 4 field goals. 1 extra point. 13 points.
The offense will have to do it again.
Meanwhile, the Giants continue to crater.

The offense will need to do what they did 2 weeks ago when New England made it a one-possession game. Put the game away.
Uh oh.
The Packers are outgaining the Lions by 40 yards. They have one more first down. Yet they‚Äôre losing 24-0.
What a first half. All-around performance by the Lions. Offense. Defense. Ford Field air conditioning. Everything‚Äôs clicking.
This defense tho...
Now the offense needs to take advantage.
I don‚Äôt agree with the Lions‚Äô strategy to get stops via Mason Crosby missing field goals, but it‚Äôs been effective so far.

Funny thing is, BK‚Äôs only slightly to the right of Roberts, who now becomes the Court‚Äôs center. To much conservative chagrin, I doubt either (&amp; esp. not JR) would ever overturn Roe. Curtail the limits currently imposed, sure, but not that.		Yet the left still cries bloody murder.
