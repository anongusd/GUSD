@Z_iz_hErE @HassanNisar @PTIofficial @Xadeejournalist Only saying “respect them for a few days as their mother passed away.” Is it a huge thing? Unfortunately we of Pakistani origin or living in Pakistan take matters from one extreme to another. Let’s find middle grounds. Respects only.
@HassanNisar I think Imran and the nation should respect the family as they lost their mother. Don’t play politics as everyone is going to lose a loved one. I am not a PMLN fan, but “Dushman maray khusi na keriyay, sajna we mar jana.” @PTIofficial @Xadeejournalist

Islam prohibits INTEREST as stated in the Holy Quran. Instead of worrying about that, Muslims of Pakistan will now raise hell “How dare an Ahmadi quote Quran!!!” Interesting, isn’t it? @ImranKhanPTI @fawadchaudhry @Asad_Umar @Xadeejournalist  @dawn_com
@sufilok I try to stay positive. Our goal should be mutual to ensure we help@poor and needy. To know about us try https://t.co/N2ZsGMKBP8 @alislam and send a private message and we will connect by sharing info. Peace on you and all loved ones.
@sufilok Pleasure to connect with you electronically. There isn’t any Ahmadi who does not love our beloved Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh). It is unfortunate that there is one sided self created Mullah misconception and no right to defend ourselves. I choose to ignore hate.
@WhirlingDervesh Let’s never get discouraged by the hateful comments of the ignorant. They are a small minority. Give them extra love as love supersedes hate.
@aasif1912 @ImranKhanPTI @JahangirKTareen @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @Xadeejournalist @mubasherlucman @hparvezdcd @HassanNisar I believe Hazrat Muhammad (saw) khatim ul Ambiyaa, the seal. Never will there be another messenger. In addition “WOH PESHWA HAMARA JIS SE HAI NOOR SARA - NAAM US KA HAI MUHAMMAD (saw) DILBAR MERA YEHI HAI.”
@WhirlingDervesh Very well said. Bravo.

Find one in your circle of friends and talk to him/her. Learn us before you pass a judgment (though Allah is the only Judge).
@shezyda1 @MalikNasir4 @naveed_zahra @ImranKhanPTI @JahangirKTareen @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @Xadeejournalist @mubasherlucman @hparvezdcd @HassanNisar What will be the signs? How will we identify??

I hope one day he shows courage to undo, as no state should ever involve itself in faith matters. I pray for a prosperous Pakistan where people of different beliefs can unite in bigger issues like poverty and education. Prayers.

@BohioGul @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen Already did few weeks ago. Plan to send every few months. I think this is the time where all get together and work for making the world a better place to live. Let’s accept all differences and get along.
@fatima_sunbal @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen Very true. The trees with good root system that help increase ground water level are: Thespesia Populnea [tulip tree]; Margosa tree [Neem tree]; Banyan Tree. Plant these on roadsides and these will help reduce smog as well. @Xadeejournalist @HassanNisar

@Jadoon74 @Xadeejournalist @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen Indoors. Aloe Vera plant in a pot in each room will improve room air quality.

@Jadoon74 @Xadeejournalist @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen My friend Aloe Vera in a pot inside a room will improve air quality immediately. But plant outside too.
@moazzamsalim @Xadeejournalist @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen Agreed but has to be done strategically, not haphazard. I don’t think this is a partisan discussion as all will breathe the same air. This is paying it forward for future generations to survive. Hope all can unite in prayers.
Hackberry (Celtis australis); Elm (Ulmus minor); Common ash (Fraxinus excelsior); Wild linden (Tilia cordata) are best trees for purification of air. @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen @HassanNisar @Xadeejournalist @mubasherlucman @dawn_com
@moazzamsalim @Xadeejournalist @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial @JahangirKTareen The key my friend is putting the right trees. Certain trees are cheap in price but not great with curbing with emissions. Let’s support all positive processes and pray.
@PTIofficial @ImranKhanPTI @JahangirKTareen @Xadeejournalist @mubasherlucman @HassanNisar Pakistan tried many in the last thirty years, of which President Musharraf was a patriot. Now Imran should be given unconditional support by all in nation building.
