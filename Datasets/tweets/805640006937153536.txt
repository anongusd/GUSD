@marklutchman I CAN'T STAND CROOKED HILLARY &amp; CAN'T WAIT FOR BILL BARR TO ARREST HER FOR HER FRAUD. I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE, OTHER THAN CHEATERS WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WOULD VOTE FOR HER. SHE'D BE IMPEACHED BY NOW &amp; WE'D BE STUCK WITH TIM CAINE! GOD HELP US!
@tedlieu IF CONGRESS DID IT'S JOB &amp; APPROVED THE $5.7 BILLION, AS IN THE PAST, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULDN'T HAVE CALLED AN EMERGENCY AT THE BORDER. YOUR FAULT! MILITARY MONEY: GOV. NEWSOM IS HOLDING $3.5 BILLION FEDERAL TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT BELONG TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. USE THAT MONEY! https://t.co/kMKznRpuvi
@RyanAFournier I KNOW! DON'T YOU LOVE IT?!! SHE NOT ONLY BROKE AMERICAN LAW BY VIOLATING THE MAN'S RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH, BUT SHE GOT HERSELF BUSTED BY ICE! GOOD!

@SaraCarterDC HOLDER DIDN'T WRITE THE CONSTITUTION. HE CAN JUST KEEP HIS OPINIONS TO HIMSELF. IT'S ANOTHER PLOY, ALONG WITH FLOODING THE COUNTRY WITH ILLEGALS &amp; MAKING THEM VOTERS, TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY &amp; CONTROL US ALL! THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK, SARA! I LOVE HEARING FROM YOU ON FOX!
@marklutchman HER UPBRINGING AND HER FAILURE TO ASSIMILATE TO AMERICAN LAW &amp; CULTURE, MAKES HER UNFIT TO SERVE IN CONGRESS. SHE IS CONSTANTLY REMINDING US OF THAT! SHE NEEDS TO GO.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr WHATEVER THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, IT'S BEING RE-DONE. WE SHOULD HAVE VOTER ID! YOU NEED A LICENSE/STATE ID TO GET A JOB, BUY A BEER OR CIGARETTES, BUY A CAR OR HOUSE, ETC. THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR ALL CITIZENS. WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?!! WHY ARE DEMS AGAINST THIS?!! https://t.co/oHWacfiZIp

@RealSaavedra MAXINE IS JUST KISSING UP TO JUSSIE BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF HER CALIFORNIA CELEBRITY CRONIES IN HER DISTRICT. SHE WANTS DONATIONS, THAT'S ALL!
@RyanAFournier REALLY! AND LOOK AT HER WITH HIGHLIGHTS IN HER HAIR. HER PARENTS ARE THE ONES PAYING FOR HER EDUCATION... WHO IS SHE KIDDING! THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T TEACH THESE COLLEGE KIDS WHAT FREE FOR HER COSTS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. FREE EVERYTHING MEANS BANKRUPTCY EVENTUALLY LIKE VENEZUELA.
@AOC YOUR GREEN NEW DEAL ISN'T FINANCIALLY POSSIBLE &amp; WOULD TAKE 10 YEARS, WHEN, ACCORDING TO YOU, THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IN 12 YEARS. I GUESS WE SHOULD JUST ENJOY THE NEXT 12 YEARS &amp; SPEND OUR MONEY ENJOYING THE REST OF OUR LIVES! THINK REALISTICALLY &amp; WE'LL TAKE YOU SERIOUS!

@RobertJohnDavi SAME THING IN MY DEMOCRATICALLY DESTROYED SANCTUARY STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE PAY HIGHEST TAXES IN THE COUNTRY, $23 BILLIION A YR SUPPPORTING ILLEGALS &amp; 1 IN 4 PEOPLE IN OUR STATE IS ILLEGAL.

@JacobAWohl @Arleekas JACOB... KEEP THAT MINDSET GOING &amp; START WRITING DOWN NAMES, ETC. WE NEED THEM SUPPORTING TRUMP IN 2020! DEMS ARE ON THE CRAZY LEFT SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE. WE HAVE TO SAVE THE COUNTRY &amp; THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW BETTER, BEING BRAINWASHED BY PROFESSORS.
@mjdgarage @starcrosswolf HUH?!!! I THINK HE'S FULL OF HIMSELF!

@iamjoshuatrump @stillcrowing1 @realDonaldTrump SO PROUD OF YOU JOSHUA TRUMP! THE PRESIDENT, FIRST LADY &amp; AMERICANS HAVE GOT YOUR BACK! YOU CONTINUE TO STAND STRONG... THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS, &amp; THAT IS WHY THEY BULLY YOU. IT IS WRONG! STAND UP FOR YOURSELF &amp; FOR OTHERS THAT YOU SEE ARE BEING BULLIED, TOO!
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump ANN... I USE TO REALLY LIKE YOU, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU LATELY. I'M CONCERNED. YOU SEEM SO ANGRY ABOUT EVERYTHING. I MEAN THAT SINCERELY.
@AOC WHAT YOU PUT OUT THERE TO YOUR YOUNG, NAIVE FOLLOWERS. AOC, YOU CALL A PLAN &amp; A VISION. BUT YOU HAVE NO CONCEPT OF WHAT REALITY COSTS &amp; HOW TO ACCOMPLISH IT. TOO BAD YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE REAL LEADERSHIP &amp; AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHEN YOU SEE IT. https://t.co/mDQa8salVx

@politico @RepKarenBass HIS TAX PLAN &amp; REMOVING REGULATIONS CREATED JOBS FOR AMERICANS, INCLUDING AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WHY DON'T YOU PUT TOGETHER A BILL CREATING JOB PROGRAMS &amp; RAISING WAGES? I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT WOULD SUPPORT IT. HE WANTS THE BEST FOR ALL AMERICANS. QUIT WHINNING &amp; DO SOMETHING!
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @RickReese10 REALLY! IS IT CANADA OR A MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY?!!! RIDICULOUS... POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AT IT'S WORST!
@Bud_Doggin @johnson20_j WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?!! SHE DIDN'T WATCH THE SAME SPEECH THAT I DID!
@LisaMarieBoothe I was so annoyed! I kept saying to her "Put your papers down! Be respectful! You're supposed to set a good example!" Unbelievable!

@mikebwonder @stillcrowing1 NO. WE HAVE A BORDER BARRIER HERE IN SAN DIEGO, WHERE I AM A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN, AND IT CUT THE ILLEGAL CROSSING BY 92%. SHE IS DISGUSTING!

@ScottHech SAD, BUT INCASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, ALOT OF BABIES &amp; CHILDREN ARE STOLEN &amp; USED TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY. ICE IS PROTECTING KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE OF THEIR OWN.

@RealSaavedra @SpeakerPelosi ONCE AGAIN, NANCY PELOSI, TRUE TO CHARACTER, LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

DID YOU KNOW YOUR POLL RATINGS SHOW INCREASED DISAPPROVAL?!! https://t.co/seM5gfGdd1
@SenSchumer WORK ON THINGS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT LIKE LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS &amp; INFRASTRUCTION! INSTEAD DEMS WANT TO FOCUS ON THINGS THAT AREN'T BROKEN. VOTING HOLIDAY?

@CalebJHull THIS IS CROSSING OVER THE LINE. WHETHER YOU'RE PRO LIFE OR PRO CHOICE... THIS IS UNAMERICAN! WHY DON'T THEY PUT THESE ALIVE, DELIVERED BABIES UP FOR ADOPTION? THE STATE WOULD TAKE THE BABIES IN A HEARTBEAT AND FIND WONDERFUL PARENTS WHO CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN TO ADOPT THEM!
@RealMattCouch AT THIS POINT... WE CAN ONLY GO BY WHAT THE VICTIM HAS STATED. AS FAR AS WHERE HE WALKED OR ANYTHING ELSE. WHEN YOU GO THRU TRAMATIC EVENTS, IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH TO GET YOURSELF TO SAFETY. ADRENALINE, ETC. SO I SAY, TAKE HIM ON HIS WORD UNTIL WE KNOW DIFFERENT.
@RealMattCouch @americafirstmg SHE CAN SIT IN THE FAR BACK CORNER, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. HER BLAH, BLAH, BLAH IS SO UNREALISTIC. I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING.
READ THIS BELOW! SO TRUE! STAND UP AMERICANS. THE DEMS WANT "FREE FOR ALL ILLEGALS." AMERICANS COME LAST. IF WE DON'T VOICE OUR OPINION TO REPUBLICANS &amp; PRESIDENT TRUMP, THINGS WILL ONLY GET WORSE. https://t.co/4akwS8af15
SECURE OUR BORDERS NOW! AMERICANS FIRST. APPLY &amp; COME HERE LEGALLY OR NOT AT ALL! NO MORE FREE BENEFITS FOR ILLEGALS. NO MORE VISA OVERSTAYS. NO MORE CATCH &amp; RELEASE. https://t.co/4353WgBhcP
TRUE! I'M MAD AS HELL &amp; I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE! 	NO MORE ILLEGALS VOTING IN OUR ELECTIONS - FRAUD &amp; AGAINST THE LAW; NO MORE FREE BENEFITS FOR ILLEGALS - LAW BREAKERS DON'T GET BENEFITS, AMERICANS DO; NO MORE OVERSTAYING VISAS - ALL VIOLATORS REMOVED IMMEDIATELY! AGREE? https://t.co/Afpb0dsxJd
@Jim_Jordan GREAT JOB, JIM! STAND UP TO THE DEMS... YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW, NOT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF DESTROYING OUR SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU KNOW IT, WE KNOW IT AND THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT. BUT THEY HAVE NO ISSUES TO STAND ON BUT RESISTANCE. https://t.co/1ZTmeqajjd

@Education4Libs @BARACKOBAMA @realDonaldTrump @VP WE COULD HAVE BUILT ALL THE BORDER BARRIERS WE NEED, ADDED MORE TECHNOLOGY, MORE BORDER PATROL &amp; ICE AGENTS, REFORMED OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, DEPORTED VISA OVERSTAYERS, ETC. WITH MONEY YOU GAVE TO IRAN. WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!!! WE ARE NOT HAPPY! https://t.co/9a8AZ5VTWQ

@charliekirk11 @sterling_poetry I'M ANGRY. CONGRESS GETS ELECTED &amp; PAID TO DO A JOB. BUT THEY RUN OFF TO HAWAII, PUERTO RICO, GO HOME &amp; TRY TO GO ON 7 DAY BUSINESS TRIPS WHEN WORKERS AREN'T GETTING PAID &amp; THEY HAVEN'T WORKED OUT A DEAL TO FUND MORE BORDER BARRIER, MORE TECHNOLOGY &amp; MORE BORDER PATROL PERSONNEL.
@_Caseeeyx3 @Brianpe93392896 AHHH... I'M SO SORRY! THIS IS SO SAD AND SO DISGUSTING! I WISH I WAS THERE. I WOULD HAVE TRIPPED THE GUY AND SCREAMED FOR SECURITY, SOMEONE CALL 911! I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SENIORS LIKE THAT!
@GOPChairwoman REALLY! HA! SCORE ONE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS FOR A CHANGE! WHAT A NICE START TO THE WEEKEND!
@Dougs1978 @jnottah @BreitbartNews AND THEN THEY GOT BIT IN THE ASS WHEN THE SPECIAL COUNCIL CONDEMNED WHAT BUSSFEED WROTE! HA! SCORE ONE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP &amp; THE REPUBLICANS!
@suzydymna @Mick2117 @SpeakerPelosi THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YOU SHOULDN'T BE LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOR 7 DAYS WHILE PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING PAID &amp; YOU HAVE NOT WORKED OUT A DEAL WITH THE PRESIDENT TO BUILD MORE BORDER BARRIER, ADD MORE TECHNOLOGY &amp; MORE BORDER PATROL PERSONNEL. DO YOUR JOB. STAY IN WASH DC!
@JudicialWatch @SpeakerPelosi ABUSIVE WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR CODEL'S MAYBE "CRUMBS" FOR YOU, BUT FOR THOSE OF US THAT WORK HARD &amp; PAY ALOT OF TAXES, WE'RE ANGRY. SET-UP A VIDEO CONFERENCING SYSTEM WITH AUDIO &amp; A GIANT FLAT SCREEN TV. I'M SURE THAT WILL WORK JUST FINE FOR YOU &amp; THE DEMS.
THIS IS A train &amp; I will collect names from ReTweeters @ Commentors for my January Trains! https://t.co/XpEFPBGb3y
@RealErinCruz @SpeakerPelosi QUIT PLAYING POLITICS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW IT. COME TO THE TABLE &amp; GET THE DEAL DONE. WORKERS WOULD GET PAID, MORE BORDER BARRIER, TECHNOLOGY &amp; PERSONNEL WOULD BE PROVIDED TO BORDER PATROL &amp; ICE. PUT YOUR EGO ASIDE &amp; DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SPEAKER PELOSI!
@CBPArizona @realDonaldTrump WHEN WILL DEMOCRATS DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO? THEIR PUTTING POLITICS BEFORE WHAT BORDER PATROL &amp; ICE STATED THEY NEED TO PROVIDE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A CRISIS &amp; AMERICANS KNOW IT. MORE BORDER BARRIERS, MORE TECHNOLOGY &amp; PERSONNEL NOW!!!
@MonicaCrowley SO TRUE &amp; SO SAD. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED TWICE, I SAID TO MY MOM, WELL, HE'S NOT WHO WE VOTED FOR, BUT WE NEED TO PRAY TO GOD THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COUNTRY. REPUBLICANS WOULD NEVER TREAT OBAMA LIKE THE LEFT &amp; MSM MEDIA TREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

@gallowglass321 @LastStand2019 YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT BORDER PATROL SAYS THEY NEED OR DO YOUR RESEARCH. IF YOU DID, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT BORDER BARRIERS WORK.

AND THE DEMS ARE IN PUERTO RICO WITH THEIR FAMILIES WATCHING HAMILTON &amp; GETTING A SUNTAN AT THE BEACH. ANYONE WHO VOTED FOR THEM &amp; HASN'T FIGURED OUT THAT THEY DON'T GIVE A SH-T ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IS JUST BEING NAIVE.

@francesirene5 @realDonaldTrump BECAUSE FEMA IS STRICTLY FOR CITIES AND VICTIMS OF NATURAL DISASTERS, NOT FOR BORDER SECURITY.
@LSARSOUR IF YOU DIDN'T PREACH HATE &amp; PUT DOWN AMERICANS, LIFE TOGETHER WOULD BE BETTER.

THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO TO PROVIDE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
@Acosta CAMP OUT THERE FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS &amp; WATCH THE "COYOTES" COME ACROSS WITH DRUGS AT NIGHT. DO YOU REALLY THINK THE DRUG CARTELS COME ACROSS DURING THE DAY? WHY NO FACTS RECORDED FROM BORDER PATROL AGENTS? YOU HAD THE PEFECT CHANCE TO ASK FOR FACTS! FORGOT YOU'RE A JOURNALIST?!!
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump WHAT JIM ACOSTA, AT THE SLAT BARRIER PROVED, IS THAT BORDER BARRIERS DO WORK. ILLEGALS ARE COMING THRU WHERE THERE IS NO BARRIER. DUH! YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WATCH THE BORDER MEETING &amp; LISTEN TO THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS. REPORT THE FACTS FOR A CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT REAL REPORTING IS.
@albertfishfry @RaifeHollister @Sheep2Wolves @Dr_Goofus @KyleKashuv @realDonaldTrump TYPICAL LEFTEST! ALL BULLYING, NO FACTS.
@askye7 @watspn1013 @Trump48_62 @JulianSvendsen @realDonaldTrump YOU FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THE "FAKE DOUSSIER" WAS PAID FOR BY HILLARY &amp; THE DNC TO TAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP DOWN. AND THE TRUMP HATING DEMS IN THE FBI THAT WERE PUSHING THE "FAKE REPORT" TO THE "FAKE NEWS" HAVE ALL BEEN FIRED OR RESIGNED. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT.
@askye7 @JulianSvendsen @realDonaldTrump TYPICAL LEFTEST. MAKE FALSE STATEMENTS WITH NO FACTS TO SUPPORT YOUR CLAIMS. WE DIDN'T ACT LIKE THIS WHEN OBAMA WAS ELECTED TWICE. WE PRAYED THAT HE WOULD DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR AMERICA. QUIT WHINING, GET OVER IT, DO YOUR RESEARCH &amp; GET A LIFE! THEN MAYBE WE'LL TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.
@kjparalegal @ReSparkled_ @BillyBakes724 @shannonrusso73 @BuzzPaladin @freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump I AGREE BUT THEIR ALSO MILKING OUR SYSTEM. ONLY 9% QUALIFY FOR ASSYLUM, BUT THEY CLAIM THAT &amp; NEVER SHOW UP FOR THEIR HEARINGS &amp; DISAPPEAR INTO AMERICA. IN CALIF.

@MarkYoungTruth I WATCHED VICTOR AVILA ON TUCKER CARLSON/FOX TELL HIS STORY OF BEING SHOT THREE TIMES BY THE CARTEL &amp; HIS PARTNER BEING MURDERED BY THE CARTEL.

THEY SHOULD STAY IN DC. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS APPRECIATE WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING TO SECURE OUR BORDER. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK THAT UNLESS ONE OF THE DEMS HAS A FAMILY MEMBER KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL, THEY WILL NOT WAKE UP &amp; DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. https://t.co/s0hX5UqGzG
WATCH THIS VIDEO OF MUSLIM MEN STOMPING ON THE AMERICAN FLAG &amp; TALKING ABOUT HOW EVIL AMERICANS ARE. ARE THESE PEOPLE HERE LEGALLY?

@Trump454545 @pacflyway THAT'S DISGUSTING!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I THINK ALL OF US HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STANDING WITH YOU! https://t.co/mvqNhg82zS
@RealSaavedra @RepJayapal YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR! PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TO NANCY PELOSI...

@JWCbuster @GOPLeader PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED NANCY PELOSI... IF I RE-OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, IN 30 DAYS, WILL YOU PASS A BILL FOR BORDER SECURITY FUNDING THAT INCLUDES MONEY FOR BORDER BARRIERS WHERE WE NEED THEM? SHE SAID NO. SO HE SAID NO DEAL. DO YOUR RESEARCH. https://t.co/DFolKYg5tw
@MsGrinningSoul @SSmith48334772 @GOPLeader IT TAKES MORE THAN TECHNOLOGY TO STOP THEM. THAT WORKS IN AREAS WHERE THEY CAN'T PUT A BORDER BARRIER UP. BORDER PATROL FOLLOWS THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE COMING OVER &amp; PICKS UP AS MANY AS THEY CAN.
@MsGrinningSoul @catraeger1 @GOPLeader ONLY 9% ARE VALID ASSULYM SEEKERS. THEY SAY THAT TO MILK THE SYSTEM. THEY GET A CASE # &amp; ARE SUPPOSE TO COME BACK &amp; SEE A JUDGE.

@gemini_mage @RealPlanoStu @realDonaldTrump I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WE PAY THE HIGHEST TAXES IN THE COUNTRY &amp; WE ALSO PAY $23 BILLION A YEAR SUPPORTING ILLEGALS! $5.7 BILLION IS ONE TENTH OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR ANNUAL BUDGET. NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR!

@darintorr1720 @badandyjones @KasBeard @realDonaldTrump TYPICAL LEFTEST. NONE OF YOU EVER KNOW ANY FACTS OR HAVING ANY IMPORTANT TO SAY. PRETTY SAD!
@KasBeard @realDonaldTrump A SPEECH FROM THE OVAL OFFICE IS ANYTHING OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE TO AMERICANS. I'D SAY AMERICANS BEING KILLED BY CRIMINAL ILLEGALS, 90% OF HEROIN/FENTANYL COMING THRU SO. BORDER KILLING 300 AMERICANS A WEEK, HUMAN TRAFFICKING, BILLIONS IN TAX $$$ SUPPORTING ILLEGALS IS IMPORTANT!
@JoelTCarter @realDonaldTrump TYPICAL LEFT EXTREMIST! AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT IS SO POSITIVE FOR OUR COUNTRY?!!  IF YOU DID YOUR RESEARCH, YOU WOULD KNOW HOW MANY, MANY POSITIVE THINGS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR YOU, YEAH YOU... EVEN THE HATERS BENEFIT. GET A LIFE!
@Free_nthee @birdonatwig @curleymaclaine @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump CATCH &amp; RELEASE HAS NOT BEEN STOPPED. IT'S THE LAW.

@Trump454545 @starcrosswolf UNBELIEVEABLE. I THOUGHT PEACEFUL PROTEST WAS AN AMERICAN RIGHT AND ATTEMPTING TO HURT OTHERS WITH "WEAPONS" IS ILLEGAL. UNBELIEVEABLE. I THINK THOSE OFFICERS SHOULD BE GIVEN A MONTH WITHOUT PAY TO THINK ABOUT THEIR ACTIONS, AND APOLOGIZE TO THE CHRISTIANS FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer AGREED! WE ALSO NEED TO END CATCH &amp; RELEASE &amp; BIRTH RIGHT CITIZENSHIP.

SCAM!
@MonicaCrowley So unfair. I hope the president gets his sentence expunged. Then we need to have a Nationwide Go Fund Me Page for @GenFlynn &amp; his family to buy them a new house &amp; rebuild their financial loss. He's an American Hero - we owe him that!!!

@VinnyVM559 @RagingGayCons THERE'S SO MUCH BUREAUCRATIC B.S. THAT GOES ON IN WASHINGTON. IT'S NOT JUST REPUBLICANS THAT LET US DOWN. THAT'S WHY WE VOTED FOR A FIGHTER LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE THE PEOPLE, SOMEHOW, NEED TO START VOICING OUR DEMANDS. PETITIONS W/MILLIONS OF SIGNATURES TO GET THEIR ATTENTION?
@ShiarTal @RagingGayCons @xbradtc I'M FOR THAT! EVERY OTHER NATION DOES IT! WE HAVE BEEN GENEROUS ENOUGH AND WALKED ON FOR TOO LONG!
@RobertItalia @RagingGayCons @ZiffyKat DEFINITELY VOTER ID! DO WE NEED TO START A PETITION AND GET MILLIONS OF SIGNERS TO MAKE IT LAW?!!! WHAT CAN WE DO? THE DEMS DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CHEAT &amp; LET ILLEGALS VOTE, TOO.
@RagingGayCons ABSOLUTELY! I AM IN FAVOR OF ALL OF THE ABOVE YOU MENTIONED. HOW DO WE FOLLOW-UP ON OVERSTAYED VISAS? I WOULD BE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER TIME TO TRACK THOSE LAW BREAKERS DOWN! THE "WALK ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES" BANK HAS CLOSED! AMERICANS FIRST!!!

@dr_palazzolo @GatesRobin @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO SHE IS DEFINITELY A "MINI-ME LEFTY SOCIALIST IN TRAINING" WHO ONLY GOT ELECTED BY PROMISING ALL HER SOCIALISTIC FREEBIES TO HER IGNORANT BASE.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; BUILD THE WALL. AMERICANS FIRST!!! GOD BLESS YOU &amp; KEEP YOU, YOUR LOYAL REPUBLICAN SUPPORTERS
@RealSaavedra @cannotfolme THE ONLY REASON I THINK SHE GOT ELECTED, IS SHE WAS PROMOTING ALL THOSE SOCIALISTIC FREEBIES TO HER IGNORANT BASE!
@RealErinCruz It's so ridiculous! I'M SINGING "BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE" WHILE "BRINGING HOME THE BACON!" HA! WATER OFF A DUCK'S BACK! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@Raiderdave70 @dbongino Why don't you spout your mouth off to someone that cares... because we don't! We're with Trump focusing on getting positive things done for the country, not whining, complaining &amp; bullying people. That doesn't work for us! Water off a Duck's Back! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
@cain_nate Nate... Just a thought... Could Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch be of any help to you? He seems to be able to get records released when Congress has fought to get information and been stonewalled. I admire your bravery in coming forth with the truth and I pray for you &amp; your family.
@cain_nate @ReadGracieWest There are people like you, like me, who are caring &amp; compassionate, openminded &amp; honest, who want to know the truth &amp; will fight for what is right.

@SenKamalaHarris I'M A NATIVE SAN DIEGO, CA. OUR TAXES ARE THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY. COST FOR CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PER YR IS $21 BILLION. TOTAL NATL. COST PER YR IS $84 BILLION. ILLEGALS CAN PAY A FEE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM. WE WANT A BORDER WALL &amp; LEGAL MIGRATION NOW!
@SenKamalaHarris Only 9% of Asylum Seekers qualify for Asylum in US. Illegal Immigrants jump border, are interviewed, get case number to come back for hearing &amp; disappear into the US never to be seen again. They milk the system! USA IS GENEROUS &amp; GIVES LEGAL MIGRATION TO 1 MIILION PEOPLE A YEAR.

IMPORTANT WORDS FOR US TO LIVE BY IN THIS DIVIDED UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE CAN CONTINUE HIS LEGACY BY REMEMBERING THESE WORDS OF WISDOM. George H.W. Bush never hated anyone. He knew what his mother and my mother always knew: "Hatred corrodes the container it's carried in." https://t.co/7LIBoukqQv
George H. W. Bush did not react with anger. "It's not about Democrats or Republicans, it's our country I fought for. Those that travel the high road of humility in Washington are not bothered by heavy traffic Humor is the universal solvent against the abrasive elements of life." https://t.co/gmekx1rMMh

@cavs4life216 @realDonaldTrump I hate to tell you but you have been lied to again by the Democrats... they will say anything to get elected and their only goal is power. ACA is way too expensive for Americans and when Obama said you can keep your Doctor... that was a lie, too. Check your facts!
@realDonaldTrump People are working the system, too, with Birth Tourism. Birth tourism is travel to another country for the purpose of giving birth in that country to obtain citizenship for the child, eventually sponsor their family to come, better college opportunities, etc. That has to stop!!!
I couldn't agree more! I am a Native California from San Diego County... our state is too crowded &amp; has changed so much with all the Illegal Immigration &amp; Birthright Citizenship in our state &amp; throughout the USA.

@TuckerCarlson @HillaryClinton @FoxNews Hilary just can not accept that she finally lost and did not get her way, despite all the dishonest, cheating that she and the democrats did.
@TuckerCarlson Rep Kennedy, in the opening of his speech last night, forgot to say one thing... "We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts – a proud American city, built by immigrants." THEY WERE IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME WITH SKILLS AND BECAME AMERICAN CITIZENS!
@TuckerCarlson One of my favorite lines in President Trump's State of the Union speech. "My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans... because Americans are dreamers too." That's why he got elected. He speaks for all Deplorables
@TuckerCarlson I love your show &amp; agree with you 100%. I am a native CA, who like you, is so sad about what CA Gov is doing to our state. I support Pres Trump &amp; pray he accomplishes his goals for the sake of the country. Keep up the great work &amp; for speaking up for people like me

@DarrellIssa How can I, as a CA Repub, help fight the $25,000 a mo being paid to Eric Holder? Waste of money &amp; California can't afford it!
@CAproTem Quit paying $25,000 a month to Eric Holder for what MIGHT HAPPEN! Come from a place of Faith not Fear. California can't afford it!
@CAproTem Trump will replace Obamacare before getting rid of it. Trump is only removing Criminal Illegal Aliens - do your homework!!!
