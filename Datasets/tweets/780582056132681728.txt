@WalshFreedom I'm on a @TeaPartyOrg mailing list.  Their daily emails are about "protecting Trump" and/or Hannity.  NOTHING about fiscal responsibility.  It's almost as @TeaPartyOrg was about America's first (half) black President, and had no concern with fiscal issues! #SadButTrump #TeaParty

@Lindalu827 Holy false equivalencies.  Obama had just been handed the biggest economic crisis since the 1930's.  Trump was handed a rebounded (although not perfect) economy.  A fat, spray-tanned guy who bankrupted a casino could have had a similar result....oh wait.  He did.  #SadbutTrump
@frfrankpavone @realDonaldTrump I see your last name translates to "Peacock" in Italian.  Makes sense.  Funny that around the turn of the 20th century, white Americans couldn't stand Italian immigrants either.  Maybe you should read some history Father Peacock.   #SadButTrump #FrankPeacock

@Alisand3 @Ohio_Buckeye_US @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP It most certainly does.   It never set term LIMITS, but the Constitution says that a President's term will be 4 years, a House member 2 years, and a Senator 6 years.   #facepalm
@Alisand3 @POTUS @SenateGOP @SenateDems Another #Conservictim.  Everyone is out to get Trump!   This is just REAL oversight, as the American people have demanded.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #Kompromat
@Alisand3 @Ohio_Buckeye_US @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP Because the Constitution sets the actual term lengths for the legislative and executive branches.

@sean_spicier You probably should have.  You're "future" would be much brighter.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #SecretaryOfLies #Kompromat
@KimStrassel Notice that Trump discussed "socialism," but not his direct government payouts to farmers as a result of his trade war.   Republicans would have stood and cheered that socialism!  #SADButTrump #Kompromat
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @mercedesschlapp Does this mean you're taking away the farm bailouts?  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #TradeWars #Kompromat
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes you normally go to Russia for your hookers with Daddy Deutschebank.   #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #Kompromat #DeutscheBank
@FreedomWorks Except when Trump's trade war causes farmers to suffer, then their will be bailouts.  Or when Wall Street collapses the economy, then their will be bailouts.  We are already a socialist country.  We just don't have socialized healthcare.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #Kompromat

@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Except that Michael Cohen served extensively on the campaign, even cofounding and leading Trump's "National Diversity Coalition."   It's funny how Team Trump tries to downplay him now, which I guess is only natural.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundy #Kompromat
@PennyDavisFrias @CollinRugg His salary goes to charity.  The secret service rooms, food, beverage and golf fees goes right in his pocket at his resorts.  For all the concern for Trump and his #Cult45 over Obama's golf habits, Trump has broken that record in the first year!

@stych626 @MIGOP @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi For someone so concerned with "facts," did you listen to the Presidents remarks with Schumer and Pelosi yesterday?  He said everything is tremendous and great at the border.  Is he lying to us?

@realDonaldTrump That "bad terrorist attack" in France was just your average "Tuesday" here in the US, where mall shootings are weekly.   What are you going to do about all these deranged white guys with guns running around the USA?  #SadButTrump
@girl4_trump In the rest of the world outside your echo chamber, it's Trump that looks like an idiot.  Schumer worked his "Art of the Deal" magic and got Trump to own shutting the government down.   If only Mexico could pay for the Wall none of this would be an issue..... #SadButTrump

@stych626 @MIGOP @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi In countless interviews, the HEAD of the Border Patrol has stated that they don't want Trumps wall--they want a wall in strategic locations, much like the ones Trump was touting the success off yesterday in his rant.  #FactsDoCareAboutMyFeelings https://t.co/rylH0tSCBO
@PantherEyez7 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The fact that all these people are "forwarding" to Donald Trump says a lot about the current state of our country.  Now run along before the black helicopters spot you!  #SadButTrump #Cult45 #Kompromat
@TheaGood @MoodysUSPubFin Actually the majority goes to children.   Another argument for some form of single-payer here in the US.
@DLoesch She must be a Russian imposter!   But no surprise there.... #SadButTrump #RussianLaundry #NRARussia
@MIGOP @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Yes because Trump PROMISED us that Mexico is paying for this wall, which the border patrol doesn't even want!
@Baylor (Except in an @Baylor frat house.....) #baylorrapist
@PeteHegseth So in Trump's soliloquy opening up the meeting, he went on and on about how the border is now 98% secure, over and over and over again.     They haven't spent the money from last year, yet clearly what we are doing is working.   #SadButTrump #LiarInChief
@kevindixon @JeffVolta @CrossBrigids @MuggleButt @KaitMarieox @sundarpichai Yes because typing "idiot" and a picture of Donald Trump showing up in a Google search is "censorship".   #Conservictims are such whiny snowflakes.
@DonnaWR8 My 9 year old son knows that Google tracks him via his phone.  It takes a #Conservictim GOP Congressman to ask the stupid questions!  #SadButTrump
@girl4_trump @realDonaldTrump Except if it costs him the presidency and possible jail time.  Then he's just the same dumbass he was before this decision.  #SadButTrump #RussianLaundry #Kompromat
@kevindixon @JeffVolta @CrossBrigids @MuggleButt @KaitMarieox @sundarpichai Actually there has been zero proof of censorship (far from it, and search results not to your liking is not censorship).  Beyond that, if I were actually censored, I wouldn't be a #conservictim and whine about it.  I'd go out and seek the information.
@KatherineWolfr2 One thing for sure is, his #cult45 supporters have a short memory of Mexico paying for the wall!  #SadButTrump #lowinfovoters #idiocracy #Kompromat
@kevindixon @JeffVolta @CrossBrigids @MuggleButt @KaitMarieox @sundarpichai WTF does this even mean?  And if you're such a #conservictim Kevin, why don't you just have the GOP job creators make you your own version of Google, where there is no bias.  Problem solved!

@DemRedistrict @EricHolder We should make house seats decided in parliamentary fashion.   If the GOP win 60% of the seats in a state, then they should get 60% of the seats.   In many states now the GOP wins 40% of the vote and takes 75% of the seats.  #Gerrymandering #GOPcrisy

It was only intended to get David the Gay Republican to engage in a conversation about the Anti-LGBT platform of the GOP.  Hundreds have responded, including yourself
@olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag No--it's because I follow most "Conservative" types, while you probably exist in an echo chamber.
@awww_na @ReaperHayes @GayRepublicSwag "More special to each other who you bang."   WTF does this even mean?    And sweetheart, you better read up on Mr Pence and his fundamentalist views.

@chareth1234 @4DandS @GayRepublicSwag Page 31.  Anti gay marriage.   Pro "traditional" family.   Which means @GayRepublicSwag cannot marry who he chooses, or make healthcare decisions for that person.  Sad, isn't it?
@theoldiowan @GayRepublicSwag I'm quite sure it's the other way around Ms Berry.  Just check the voting record of Mike Pence.
@awww_na @ReaperHayes @GayRepublicSwag Mike Pence and the conservative Christian voting block.  That's who.
@Anthellia Then why when asked over the last 2 years did he deny any such matters?  It's like he has something to hide!  Like a golden shower in a Moscow hotel room!  #SADButTrump #Kompromat

@frances1509 @GayRepublicSwag Lighten up Frances!  (I've always wanted to say that for real).  It was a fart joke.  But on a serious note, the GOP has an anti-LGBT platform and elects openly anti-gay national candidates like Mike Pence.  We should love everyone...unfortunately that doesn't always happen.
@valmont_1969 @GayRepublicSwag Then governor Mike Pence signed the law Jumpy.   The GOP platform is anti LGBT.
@ReaperHayes @GayRepublicSwag So what do you think of Gay Conversion Therapy?  Is that a version of "saving the sinners?"
@thebigjman57 @GayRepublicSwag But you vote against gay rights.  It is in the @GOP platform.

@originalcece @GayRepublicSwag He had to backtrack and rush the amendment through the legislature, after the NFL, NCAA and multiple corporations threatened to pull events or expanding their businesses.  You're right--it wasn't needed, but conservative "Christians" pushed their agenda and Pence gladly signed.
@itscollmc @GayRepublicSwag Sorry Coleen. You're late to this conversation.  Please read the rest of the threads here.  #SadButTrump
@lucylurichards @Rebeldill75 @GayRepublicSwag That is just your bias showing Lucy.  I am pro-gay rights and defending our Twitter friend @GayRepublicSwag!    I'm trying to understand the position of a gay Republican who's party platform is anti-LGBT.
@Anthellia @BasedArmando @Douglas_E_Ryan @SoutherngalDec @GayRepublicSwag No Democrat forced Trump to ban transgenders from the military.   That was likely @VP Mike Pence.
@lucylurichards @Rebeldill75 @GayRepublicSwag Muslims are a very small population in the us, and those that would be considered "fundamentalists" are a fraction of that total.  Fundamental Christians, on the other hand, exert their political power daily in this country, trying to legislate peoples bodies and bedrooms.
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @visitms Then why did Pence backtrack on it and force the legislature to re-write it?  He should have stood his ground!

@onetruthagenda @GayRepublicSwag I would dispute that statistic.   Then why is the GOP always trying to regulate women's bodies and people's bedrooms?
@NoNaziLiberals @Douglas_E_Ryan @olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag Whoooaaaa Anthony Furberger!  You're making quite the leap there!   Muslims infiltrating the government to implement Sharia law?   If anything it's a Christian Sharia law that Pence is after....
@PlainUnamerican @GayRepublicSwag It was a fart joke you dope (combined with the border patrol gassing people).  Hence the little fart clouds and a NOSE!  	 Some people are way to triggered!   And PS--I am pro gay rights as well if you read through this $hitstorm I started!
@sxdoc @RealMAGASteve @gatewaypundit @bonniemurphy @gr8tjude_08 @SandraTXAS @RealSaavedra @grizzlemeister @RodStryker @ROCKONOHIO @ReneeCarrollAZ @jeepsuzih2 Yeah I think you have that backwards.

@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @DNC @GOP Ok the NFL and NCAA didn't threaten to pull out of Indy.  Do you need a Fox News article to vindicate me?
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @visitms It didn't say it was anti-gay, but most of the country thought it was.  To the point that the NFL threatened to pull the Super Bowl and corporations threatened to leave Indianapolis.  I'm sure Pence has not evolved much on the issue (witness the transgender military ban).
@SebGorka @BarackObama Yes why let a woman in a happy marriage to the same man talk about morals?   Better to let a man with 5 kids to three different immigrant gold-digger women who screwed a porn star while one was pregnant have those talks......
@HughesSarge @olbigwhiskey @Douglas_E_Ryan @GayRepublicSwag Yes, you do.  You also need the rights of a married person to give your spouse benefits, or make decisions in their health care, including at end-of-life.
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @DNC @GOP Yeah that's all good in your fantasy land.  But here in the middle of America, laws are being passed and rights are being taken away.  Only the courts are saving transgender people from Trump's military ban.  And BTW, my response to Davids tweet was a fart joke.  Lighten up!
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @visitms That Mike Pence signed an anti-gay law?   Hardly incendiary.  He had corporations threatening to leave Indiana until he backtracked and changed it!  https://t.co/cWo1XFZJsB
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @DNC @GOP So my claim that there are Christians who are anti-gay is baseless?  Now you're really out there!   Even the most die-hard Trumpkin can admit that!
@2bz4thot @Jillibean557 If the "Libtards" can do it, it should be easy?  Right?  By the look on Huckabee Sanders face...maybe not   😂🤣😂🤣
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @visitms Not when people like Mike Pence are passing gay-discrimination laws.  There are places in America that are hardly tolerant.
@HughesSarge @olbigwhiskey @Douglas_E_Ryan @GayRepublicSwag Are you high tonight?   Gay marriage and all LGBT rights were advanced during the Obama administration.
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @DNC I don't disagree with you.  But I also don't think it can be laid squarely on the leadership of the @DNC.  We can go around in circles all night.  Cities are democrat controlled.  And all the poorest states in the union are all @GOP controlled.  #CountryOverParty
@SMaccarron @GayRepublicSwag I notice that everyone responding says "most of us."  I understand this--which is why you are following David.  There are millions of hard-core "Christians" who wouldn't mind stripping him of his rights.  #SadButTrump #FakeChristians
@charliekirk11 Or....just let the rest of us Americans (aka your employers) buy into the same health plans that members of Congress receive.   #Trumpcare #ACA
@GayRepublicSwag Well I'm not a Trump lover, and in fact I'm a Pence hater.  I have gay family members and just want to see them have the same rights to marry, divorce, adopt kids and make healthcare decisions like any other American.  Many fake-"Christians" would prefer to deny you those rights
@Jillibean557 Tootles.  Make sure you get with the GOP "job creators" and spend some of those tax cuts to make you're own conservative social media echo chamber.  #SADButTrump #Conservictims. #snowflakes
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @DNC Really?  Oakland is part of the Silicon Valley tech boom.  How's those housing prices treating you?  Chicago?  Massive wealth.  Houston?  During oil booms....yes.  And they are diversifying their economy.
@HughesSarge @olbigwhiskey @Douglas_E_Ryan @GayRepublicSwag Not true.  He wasn't publicly supporting gay marriage (he toed the line by saying civil unions).  He ran as a centrist.
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @visitms So you live in a tolerant area for LGBT people.  Which was the original intent of my tweet to @GayRepublicSwag.
@cityheels @GayRepublicSwag But it does vote for bigoted, anti LGBT people like @VP Mike Pence.  #SadButTrump #IndianaBoycott
@livelygames @Douglas_E_Ryan @olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag Well lets see. Trump and Pence are trying to ban transgender people from the military, even those who have served with honor for years.  Thankfully the courts are stopping them.
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @DNC Oh yes those destitute places that generate most of the wealth in the United States.  The cities.
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP @visitms Why did you leave?  Where are you now?
@Imamofpeace There are plenty of democratic socialist success stories.  If you ask me Australians have it pretty darn good.  Great weather, sun tanned beautiful girls, and some level of national health coverage.
@olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag @VP So by your logic, the anti-gay law was the one that Mike Pence's conservative "Christian" constituents wanted, therefore a majority of Indiana are anti LGBT.   And by the way, Mike Pence is a guy who is not allowed to be in the company of another woman without his wife.....creepy
@FutureSpecOps @kid_prairie @GayRepublicSwag @VP Ah the good ole days.  1861.  Mississippi is damn near last at most every stat in the country...it certainly couldn't hurt them (much) worse to secede.  #SADButTrump #JimCrow #RedStateBlues
@SamAkel2010 @GayRepublicSwag Sure Sam.  It's called evolving.  Hillary and Obama put some thought into the issue and realized it needed to be done. They then supported protection for LGBT people, including our friend @GayRepublicSwag People like Mike Pence are trying to keep us in the 19th century.
@mmooch1970 @GayRepublicSwag There ain't know bubble like a Trumpkin bubble.  It's a non-stop echo chamber of people who have never traveled and stay tuned to Fox News!
@olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag @VP Because he had to backtrack on the law and change it.   And thanks for proving the point the conservative "Christians" (aka Mike Pence's Indiana constituents) are anti-gay.  That helps!
@FutureSpecOps @GayRepublicSwag @VP Ok...Donald Trump banning transgender service members from the military.   Next?  How about Mississippi?
@FutureSpecOps @GayRepublicSwag @VP https://t.co/O19hjZvMAV
@Education4Libs You would be miseducating your children.  Republicans are not always the best candidates (especially when they are pedophiles...or dead).  Socialism does work in some countries (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Australia....).   I'd suggest they marry a liberal and travel a bit.
@olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag @VP Do you know how bills become laws Nick?  He was the governor of the state.  He signed it into law.  He could have vetoed it.  But he didn't.  And it almost cost the state the Superbowl and the NCAA moving out.
@galyki @SoutherngalDec @GayRepublicSwag Because he was the Indiana governor in 2015!  He's VPOTUS now!   Do you think he magically changed his beliefs and wouldn't discriminate against gays if given the chance?  #lowinfovoter
@SamAkel2010 @GayRepublicSwag Please..name one liberal or democrat pushing an anti-LGBT bill.  I'm waiting.....
@micasth87 WTF does that have to do with this at all?  We're talking about conservative "Christians" discriminating against LGBT people.
@Jehu11 @GayRepublicSwag That conservative "Christians" discriminate against gays?   We all understand that.  https://t.co/KApPRPVYyU
@SamAkel2010 @GayRepublicSwag Well Sam I am...not.  My nombre es Jesus.  And I speak the truth.
@FutureSpecOps @GayRepublicSwag So why are people like @VP Pence trying to pass laws discriminating against gay rights?
@SoutherngalDec @GayRepublicSwag https://t.co/KApPRPVYyU
@FutureSpecOps @GayRepublicSwag My point is, there are many conservative "Christians" who would gladly legislate against David.  Deny him of his rights to marry, have children, or make health decisions for his partner.
@heimagin @GayRepublicSwag LOL maroon.  That's kind of like saying, I stepped in some dog Poppe.
@olbigwhiskey @GayRepublicSwag @VP The VP passed a freaking law against LGBT people. He wasn't expressing an opinion.  There is a huge difference.  And lets just see what the conservative-tilted SC decides in any gay rights cases that come before it.
@TheNayJoy @GayRepublicSwag Glad to hear it.  Unfortunately, there are many conservative "Christians" who would gladly pass laws to discriminate against David.
@Ethnic_Coleslaw @GayRepublicSwag His Vice President Mike Pence passed an anti-gay law in Indiana.  It starts at the top.
@BONNWOOD1 @GayRepublicSwag "Most of his?"   I don't have an opinion on his level of adorable, but I'm sure he is!
@Ethnic_Coleslaw @GayRepublicSwag Uhhh...it was actually a reference to his sexuality, which is clearly stated in his Twitter handle.   I think you're projecting.  #SADButTrump
@2012gigib @GayRepublicSwag Name one Democrat pushing for anti-LGBT legislation.
@TLC63067 @GayRepublicSwag How did you feel when the NFL and NCAA threatened to pull out of Indiana over the RFRA a few years ago?
@Gr8ful_Patriot @GayRepublicSwag I have no problem with David.  Just wondering where he stands on the "Christian" element of the GOP that would love to pass laws to deny him the right to marry, to adopt a child, or to make healthcare decisions for his loved ones.  #SADButTrump #FakeChrisitans
@grimmgeek @GayRepublicSwag OH yes this is a very fake account.   Can I grab your pussy?  She looks so cute!  #SadButTrump #Caturday #CatsTakeIndy #catlady
@LauraSteele33 @GayRepublicSwag @VP It was a fart joke Beaker!  It sure triggered all the "Christians" on here tonight!  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
@stac_rn @GayRepublicSwag Why should they denounce the Islam religion?  Talk about being intolerant!   And I'm still waiting--name one Democrat pushing an anti-LGBT law.
@aebhel_juan @GayRepublicSwag Please Juan..name me one law being pushed by a Democrat that seeks to limit the rights of the LGBT community?   You can't!  They are pushed by the GOP's conservative "Christian" element.  https://t.co/HU45YiMAF0
@stac_rn @GayRepublicSwag Oh really?  Show me which of these anti-LGBT legislation are being pushed by the left?  https://t.co/HU45YiMAF0
@LauraSteele33 @GayRepublicSwag Wow what a coincidence!  I've been following him too and am interested in what he has to say!   I also have a gay family member who wants to be able to live his life and enjoy his family.  People like @VP would like to not see that happen!  #SadButTrump #Indianaboycott

@cjlovesamerica So thank you for contradicting your self.   I'm still waiting for an answer as to why the GOP hasn't passed any meaningful immigration reform (if you remember back to the GWB Presidency, the same thing happened).   Maybe they don't want reform because they like cheap labor?

@cjlovesamerica Oh sweetie...Obama hasn't been President for a couple years.   Trump has had control of the Executive, Legislative and now Judicial branches.  Sounds like you are using Obama as an excuse for Trump's failures.  He hasn't repealed Obamacare or passed any immigration reform.
@cjlovesamerica LOL you're funny.   That's Trump's legacy thus far...making Obama's EOs go away, and passing a tax cut that will add more debt than Obama (who had 1/2 his tenure with a GOP Congress).   Obamacare is still mostly intact, and the GOP has passed NO IMMIGRATION REFORM.
@MiltShook Because they were successful centrist Democrats that are immensely popular.
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump He should just prove us all wrong and release the last 20 years of his tax returns.   What is he afraid of?  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #Oligarchy

@augustangel61 @ColumbiaBugle @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump How did he get tax reformed passed?  Are you saying the Democrats made tax reform happen?  Because the GOP hasn't shared that bit of bipartisanship with the media!

@augustangel61 @ColumbiaBugle @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump No he doesn't write it and pass it.  But his party controls both haves of Congress who do.  Don't be a fool...the GOP likes to talk immigration hordes and caravans to their base--but they like the cheap labor and won't do anything meaningful about it.  #SADButTrump
@ColumbiaBugle @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Ok sheep.  You've all been fooled by Trump.  He could have passed meaningful immigration reform, but he hasn't.  Because he has the sheep under his spell....

@RickenRich @cheryl_schantz @Boyd_2650 @SpeakerRyan All y'all Trumpkins have been deluded by Obamacare proceedings, which they've tackled with budget procedure  (because the Senate GOP couldn't pass any repeal for popular Obamacare.

@USANana1 @cheryl_schantz @Boyd_2650 You're a moron.  They passed a Kavanaugh.  They passed tax reform. Don't you think the "never-trumpets" or RINOs would have stopped that also?   They need a simple majority to pass a law.  Study up on your civics, Nana.  #SADButTrump #lowinformationvoters

@randomxnp @joemonroe5 @Farberyanki Ahh yes...semantics matters to conservatives"\ unless you're talking about something they're against.  I'll give you that "Press" didn't mean "Journalists," if you give me that the right to bear "arms" doesn't mean "automatic weapons".
@RealSaavedra And Michael Cohen was Hannity's lawyer.   So that really makes @FoxNews look bad.  #SADButTrump

@Boyd_2650 Trump has had full control since 2016 yet no immigration law reform.  George W Bush had the same in his first term, yet no immigration law reform.  It's almost as if the GOP uses this as a talking point for their base, but in reality they LOVE the cheap labor that comes with it.
@randomxnp @joemonroe5 @Farberyanki Prove it.  Maybe he could give a speech in the rain someday?
@randomxnp @joemonroe5 @Farberyanki Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the PRESS; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

@randomxnp @joemonroe5 @Farberyanki A Trump supporter calling someone a narcissist.  That's rich.  How many reporters still wear a spray tan, wig and makeup on into their 70's.  Trump is the one that is VISIBLY obsessed with himself.

@randomxnp @joemonroe5 @Farberyanki No, I'm not.  Clinton is not POTUS so she cannot make any impact, no matter what you think.  What is true is Trump is kicking reporters out of the White House, and the press is lining up against him.  It's the only profession specifically mentioned in the Constitution.
@joemonroe5 @Farberyanki Freedom of the press is very well enshrined...but GOPeeps don't give two shits about that.  #SadButTrump

@rghtwngextrmst @Jonywalker56 @rickybobby90210 @kyrstensinema Hitler was a socialist only in as much as he needed to me.  We're talking about the Great Depression era here--so yes, he needed to feed the people and give them work--just like FDR was doing in the USA.   He was also battling against a highly-active Communist party in Germany.

@TAGOS22 @Jswans4 Really they are starting to Waleaway?   Are they moving to Wales?  Because it's a long trip there--and the Welsh are harder to understand than Mexicans!
@Jswans4 @TAGOS22 They could--but it's an overly complicated and outdated process--especially if you're a low-skilled farm worker.   The common thought is do a simple visa for them--so at least we can get fingerprints and figure out who's coming in, rather than have them sneak in.
@Mikel_Jollett I'm sure the shooter follows Trump's twitter feed like it is "Mein Trumpf"
@Jswans4 @TAGOS22 What we need are reforms that include easy visas available to them at the border so we can track these people coming in to pick our berries and lettuce.
@TAGOS22 You really think the people in the "caravan" will be stealing jobs from Americans?   If you do, I have a plot of land just to the east of Mar-A-Lago I want to sell you!   These people take the jobs that Americans won't get off their couches for!   #SADButTrump #CaravanInvasion

@FoxNews @DevinNunes Yes because they should have brought the FBI in right away and had the judge take a polygraph.  #SADButTrump
@AriFleischer She sounds vaguely like @DonaldJTrumpJr!   Maybe he hopped on her at a party?  #SADbutTrump
@GOP @JohnCornyn So let the good judge take a polygraph test along with the FBI inquiry.  Nothing to worry about, right?  #SADButTrump
@realDonaldTrump When you campaign in a state you won handily, it's not a rally.  It's a circle jerk.  #SADButTRump

@RyanPowellSmith @FoxNews @tedcruz @BetoORourke The only thing he doesn't stand firm on is defending his wife, or himself against Trump.   Cruz is the biggest weasel to ever walk in the US Senate.
@CyrusMMcQueen Based on the responses I've seen on Twitter, I think many of these guys actually assaulted their daughters...or cousins.

@nada_noche @M2Madness @realDonaldTrump And let me guess--you blame this horrible practice on Democrats?
@KimCarvalho It sucks when you have to cut off your flow of Russian Olicarch cash and lay low for a while.  Just ask @realDonaldTrump and the rest of his family.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry
@Farberyanki @realDonaldTrump What are you basing your statement on?  George Bush stood in the ruins of 911 with firefighters.  Jimmy Carter builds houses for the poor.  Clearly there are others who have been up to the task of small, meaningful gestures.

@StevieSleeves @RickSaccone4PA Because he "only hires the best people."  And meanwhile, our national intelligence agencies are telling Trump the Russians are attacking our elections, and he's choosing to ignore them.  But let's dwell on Hillary circa 2010.....   Keep moving the goalposts for Trump!

@StevieSleeves @RickSaccone4PA That's funny.  Because in the #cult45 echochamber, things that Hillary Clinton did 8 years ago are still quite newsworthy.   The goalposts for Trump have been moved miles by his base.
@MarshaBlackburn And how are those tax cuts doing for the debt?   Maybe we should do away with healthcare for ALL government employees and let them shop on the "free market."  #SADButTrump

@Acosta You and your colleagues should pick one rally and refuse to report from the inside.  Take away Trump's audience.  He feeds on it.  #SADButTrump
@CollinRugg Then once they are born, Republicans want to take away food, healthcare and education from said children.  The idiocy of both parties in this country needs to stop.  #SADButTrump

@NRO Trump works for all of us.  We are all equals that he should be setting an example for.  "Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd" came back to roost with "Perfect Smokey Eye" Sara Sanders.  The HUGE difference--Trump is our President and Sanders was at a roast with a comedian.
@KamVTV May 1 does traditionally kick off the Russian fundraising season.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #NRAPravda
@rolandscahill @DanBringhurst @michelleisawolf Meanwhile the child just laughed at said phallus and asked his mom for another Cheeto.  #SADButTrump #TinyHands
@rolandscahill Trump actually set the standard for press-related eye jokes with Sleepy Chuck Todd.  I think Ms Sanders is equally fair game for fatigued ocular disorders.  #SADButTrump #CivilDiscourse

@4YrsToday Should be quite a shit show, despite being after "Executive Time."  Will his attorney(s) be present?
@FoxNews Just like the Mueller probe, if this guy is so squeaky clean, why did he not only withdraw his nomination, but now he's quitting his current job?  Something must be sticking!  #SADButTrump #detective101
@MontyBoa99 I'm impressed @PressSec and @KellyannePolls were still there for any afterparty?   They have bigger balls than I give them credit for.  #SADButTrump
@SharinStone @GOP @realDonaldTrump And, by the way, you control both houses of Congress.  What's the delay @GOP?   Better get cracking before November!  #SADButTrump #GOPComplicit #excuses
@polishprincessh How about spending on technology, and hiring hundreds of more border agents (putting Americans to work permanently), rather than a wall that will become a maintenance headache and will be breached within 5 days of putting it up?

@WomenforTrump @realDonaldTrump But in reality, the comedian on the left is doing her own thing, and was brutally honest and true to herself after being hired to do the event.  The Press Secretary works for a liar and spreads his lies.  She has no guts.  #SADButTrump
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Dumbass--they are all making a ton of money off your father.  I wouldn't call that rent free!  But then again, you wouldn't know anything about money unless it is wired to you from a Russian banker!  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry
@gvaratta @FoxNews @michelleisawolf @HillaryClinton It's great that she bashed both sides of the "isle".   That's the point of the dinner.  Always has been.  I actually give Sarah Sanders a ton of credit for showing up when her boss refuses.

Maybe Trump is dumb?

@dcexaminer I'm failing to draw a parallel between the two.  So Zakaria rips off some writers, and that is somehow equivalent to a primetime host who claims to not be a client of the Presidents attorney, defends him on air, and is named in a  Federal court as a client?  Please elaborate.
@ThinkingMomOf6 If you grow up getting pulled over by the police just for driving while black, you might think differently.   At some point you'd want to make a stand.  Like a lunch counter in 1955 or a Starbucks in 2018, some things never change.  #TakeAKnee

@marklevinshow Did you ever think the @GOP machine would produce videos and direct their full weight against a guy like Comey?  It's almost like they know Comey is right!  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #GOPComplicit
@SethAbramson It is amazing how much the GOP is investing against Comey.   The entire weight of the machine is coming down on him.  A sure sign that Comey is right about a lot of things.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry
@blazingxmexican Yeah but the citizens of those countries aren't paying $140 million for a few minutes of Tomahawk missiles raining on Syria.   The USA has the money.  We just need to straighten our priorities and stop giving all our money to the defense industry.
@GOPChairwoman Oh have you read the book now?  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry #GOPComplicit
@GOPChairwoman It's interesting that the @GOP is pulling out all the stops to smear him.  It's almost like you have something to hide?  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry  #GOPComplicit
@Real_PeachyKeen It speaks volume that the entire @GOP machine is having to invest in the effort to smear Comey.  #SADButTrump #RussianLaundry

If they find anything in Cohen's office--HANNITY IS NOT A CLIENT!  So attorney-client privilege does not apply!!!!!   Problem solved!!!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Thanks Romney!
@seanhannity Hey Trump base!  Shiny object over here--don't pay attention to Hannity!  Should be a hell of a meltdown on tonight's show unless you take a pre-planned vacation?  🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  #StateMedia
@one1biglug @SandraTXAS @ReneeCarrollAZ @ClintonMSix14 @JVER1 @baalter @VFL2013 @WideAwake35 @888Scott @winegirl73 @GaetaSusan @mavrick803 I'm talking about the guy who promoted Hannity's show to his 54 million Twitter followers.
Well there goes the primetime slot!  #FoxNews #SADButTrump #StateMedia https://t.co/XowobCF52d
@mike_Zollo So Cohen is lying to a Federal Court about the status of his clients?  Sounds like a guy Trump would hire!  #SADButTrump #StormyDaniels #RussianLaundry
@The_Trump_Train Your NothingBurger is trending on Twitter! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 #HannityCohen
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Yeah unfortunately the #GOPTaxScam doesn't kick in until next year-after the midterms (as though by design).
@one1biglug @SandraTXAS @ReneeCarrollAZ @ClintonMSix14 @JVER1 @baalter @VFL2013 @WideAwake35 @888Scott @winegirl73 @GaetaSusan @mavrick803 No one except the President of the United States.  #EmolumentsClause  And for the millions saying holy fuck no more, there are as many or more saying--"What does this guy have to hide?"
@FreedomWorks Yeah those people really have it rough in Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, etc....
@one1biglug @SandraTXAS @ReneeCarrollAZ @ClintonMSix14 @JVER1 @baalter @VFL2013 @WideAwake35 @888Scott @winegirl73 @GaetaSusan @mavrick803 Sure.  But if I was President of the United States, I would understand there has to be a degree of transparency to ensure to the Republic that you are acting in behalf. Trump was probably never suited for the job because he refused to divest him self from business, show taxes etc
@SandraTXAS @one1biglug @ReneeCarrollAZ @ClintonMSix14 @JVER1 @baalter @VFL2013 @WideAwake35 @888Scott @winegirl73 @GaetaSusan @mavrick803 Ok I'll bite.  How do I "seem to support" Hillary?   Have I said anything pro-Hillary?  #puttingwordsinmymouth

@thehill It could be worse Jim.  You could be working UNDER Trump, like #StormyDaniels.   #SADButTrump
@one1biglug @SandraTXAS @ReneeCarrollAZ @ClintonMSix14 @JVER1 @baalter @VFL2013 @WideAwake35 @888Scott @winegirl73 @GaetaSusan @mavrick803 If Trump has nothing to hide, or they are not connecting the dots to other crimes, then he has nothing to fear.  The trouble is, he's acting like an awfully guilty man--especially with the tweet promoting Hannity's show last week.

Yeah normal Americans probably wouldn't have this happen....#SADButTrump
@StevenTDennis Or traded for future favors from Trump and Putin to pay off Hannity's girls.  Its called PRO-BONER.   #SADButTrump

@MEL2AUSA @AntonioSabatoJr Any links to the Democratic Party saying that?   I think what they are actually saying is the wall won't work--and maybe the funds should be spent hiring Americans to guard the border.  #SADButTrump

@laurasessions10 @HuffPostPol I hate trump but prefer any proceedings to happen naturally.  Let Mueller do his gig.  Impeachment now would only give us President Mike Pence.  If it happens close to 2020, just defeat him at the polls and put this entire nightmare behind us.
@AIIAmericanGirI @TwitchyTeam Trump should scrub his now as well.   Bragging about his building in a fire where one died and first-responders injured.....the definition of #SADButTrump
@laurasessions10 @HuffPostPol I'm none of the above.  Just concerned that "more of the same" is not the best past forward here.  Kamala Harris is my pick for 2020 BTW.

@KyleClemens5 @ToddRokitaIN OK let's go back to the photo I was commenting on.  As far as Trump supporters as a whole, sure there are a few here and there...but if you think that's a movement, then you should pay attention to a progressive candidate winning in Wisconsin!
@MAGAMOFOS @KamVTV @USATODAY I agree. Obama and the GOP Congress should have done more. Back to the current POTUS:  What has he done to actually improve infrastructure, besides a photo op showing a check that would barely pave a Wal Mart parking lot. His #InfrastructureWeek speeches were about Hillary.
@KyleClemens5 @ToddRokitaIN Looking at photos of most of these events, why yes I have.  It's easy to do when there are zero in the photo!   And for fun, just do a Google image search for Trump rally crowd photo.  Mostly the same result. https://t.co/H4gh0bRe8v
@KyleClemens5 @ToddRokitaIN No...other than it speaks to the very real demographic problem the GOP is going to have every election going forward.  Trump has amplified the problem.
@KamVTV @USATODAY Remember when Obama actually moved a bill through Congress to put Americans to work building infrastructure?   Because Trump hasn't managed that.  #SADButTrump
@ToddRokitaIN Only in Indiana would a "Chocolate Cafe" be filled with nothing but old white guys.  #SADButTrump
@krissyshouse @GOPChairwoman It's all over the map depending on many factors.  The fact is, most Americans confuse "withholding" with paying their taxes.  They may be getting that extra $72 in Michigan, but will it will become $1.50 next April when the tax bill is due.
@VP Many more Americans are killed each year at the hands of other Americans with guns.  What are you doing about that other than being a good Christian and taking another @NRA check?  #SADButTrump #FakeChristian
@junogsp5 @POTUS @jack @100PercFEDUP Well Trump and Prayer in the same sentence doesn't really make sense.  the man is a #FakeChristian.

@michael__1776 Anyone can win when your district is gerrymandered to look like Massachusetts.  Are you really a Kennedy Chip?  #HyannisTX
@Mungtoe3415 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Even the good things he has done comes with a ** notation.  Tax reform is killing debt.  Obamacare not repealed.  Wall being paid for by USA.  If you think this is liberal stupidity, then you need to pay closer attention to the GOP Congress and Trump.  #SADButTrump
@SBelle1950 Yes--you forgot to mention what the GOP Congress spent investigating the "scandal", only to find nothing.  They must be some sad investigators!  #SADButTrump #GOPcrisy
@Sunrise51052 If you think Hogg was whining, you must be the world's biggest snowflake.  Possibly more than Donald Trump himself.  #SADButTrump

@GovMikeHuckabee I thought you told Obama that he shouldn't negotiate with terrorists?   Now we have a President negotiating with porn stars AND terrorists and you stand behind him?   #SADButTrump
@AshleyyLibertyy @1608Legacy @GOP @realDonaldTrump They are positioning themselves for what's coming down the pipeline.  I do love dummies!   It takes one to know one!  https://t.co/dr1LJbykB2
@JudicialWatch While you're at it, throw @VP Mike Pence's laptop in the mix as well.  #LockHimUp
@SafetyPinDaily Maybe he should add some diversity to his appointees instead of 90% old white males.  And I'm not talking #StormyDaniels sitting on a bench!  #SADButTrump #60Minutes #WeThePeople
@DonaldJTrumpJr Better god than a 2-bit porn star!  Can't wait for the #60Minutes interview!   #SadButTrump #DoucheJr #StormyDaniels

@drmattsplan @HConomics I feel your pain (pun intended).  As a long time freelancer (aka "small business owner"), I feel the only way our system will get fixed is to do away with ALL employer-sponsored plans, starting with the ones our government employees have.  Force everyone to shop on the open mkt!
@chucktodd You should challenge @POTUS to stop Tweeting about Fox &amp; Friends, get his ass out of bed on a Sunday morning, and come appear on your show!   #SADButTrump
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ask your daddy to release his tax returns, then maybe we can make a determination.  #SadButTrump #RussianLaundry

@KialoHQ If the healthcare market was actually "free", I'd agree with you.  We should get rid of ALL employer-sponsored plans (starting with Congress and their staff first) and let everyone shop in one giant risk pool.   #Trumpcare
@ConservGayGuy Maybe because both parties have encouraged white flight and the destruction of inner cities.  It's not just city government--it happens on the county, state and federal level as well.  #SuburbiaUberAlles
@sandybeach0724 @mitchellvii If they wanted to discourage them, they would report that voter turnout was abysmal--so GOP voters don't show up.   Just like happened to Hillary when Dems thought Trump never had a chance.

@WiredSources Thank you to that young aide for standing up for what is right...something none of the politicians in the room were willing to do on their own.  #SADButTrump #CountryOverParty
@StephenKing Sadly it helps that American tax dollars go to defend Norway.   If we reworked our budget we could still have the strongest military in the world, AND healthcare for our citizens.  But Wall Street wouldn't support it, so it will never happen. #SADButTrump

@FortuneMagazine #ThanksBush!
@JimmyKPolk11 @Cernovich @RoyMooresHorse @realDonaldTrump Oh you mean the one that avoided Vietnam with bone spurs?  Or the one that has played over 100 rounds of golf so far, but hasn't visited a single member of the military deployed overseas?  Animated gifs do not make a great leader.  #FakePatriot #ChickenHawk
@SodaJoe1 @GOP Ah yes I'm enjoying the Dow run as well.  I'm also pinning this tweet so I can check back with you after the Trump "correction"
@Scaramucci @POTUS Hey Mooch--remember back in 1895 when Italy was considered a shithole country?  Fuck those were great times right?  #SADButTrump
@JimmyKPolk11 @Cernovich @RoyMooresHorse @realDonaldTrump Does a "country without white people" include those who spray tan themselves orange, wear makeup and a horrendous comb-over?
@SodaJoe1 @GOP I'd love to see how Trump would fare if given the economy in 2008.   We'd all be living in cardboard boxes.  #SADButTrump
@FoxBusiness For a few months...then it's 2008 Part Deux all over again.  #Fuzzymath
@GOP #ThanksObama  https://t.co/5Hbh4BbT0x
There are no #BoneSpurs in Haiti. https://t.co/TWTiM1mcIy
@JimmyKPolk11 @Cernovich @RoyMooresHorse So you still support slavery all these years later? Bring them from Haiti for a better life on your plantation, or perhaps as servants on your White House staff? Mr President its time to update your thinking. Sadly, @realDonaldTrump would probably get along swimmingly with Polk!
@GemMar333 Is one of these guys the father of your daughter in the last tweet?  She has your eyes, but his forehead.  #SADButTrump
@FLOTUS Lots of Russian baby showers to plan?   I know....someone has to do it.  #RussianLaundry #SADButTrump
@GemMar333 You look like you could be her mom!   #SADButTrump
@JimmyKPolk11 @Cernovich @RoyMooresHorse You're not making sense anymore.  Maybe time to get back to tending your slaves from shithole countries.
@Libertea2012 Maybe the troops should all call off for #BoneSpurs.....  #DraftDodger #Deferments #ChickenHawk
