@patDaily @KelemenCari For example, look into college sexual assault stats if you are curious as to the delay in response times. Most campus assaults take place in the beginning of the school year but are reported in April or May when victims feel more comfortable/by that point know other survivors.
@patDaily @KelemenCari Is your insinuation is that the delay in speaking up indicates these claims are untrue? Simply put, I think there is a momentum in our culture right now where victims feel empowered to come forward - there is power in numbers.

@AmericaRising17 @KelemenCari If you look at rates of ptsd, you will see it heavily in veterans... and sexual assault victims. Hence where survivor stems from.
