You can’t really get worse for favorite presidents than Andrew Jackson. Dude was just an all around horrible, horrible human.
And here’s your regular reminder that Trump’s favorite president Andrew Jackson was an unapologetic racist who committed genocide, actively fought the abolitionist movement, and routinely ignored the constitution to do racist, genocidal shit.
Of course Trump is making a Trail of Tears joke. To even leave open the possibility that it’s some other trail is stupid and dangerous. I mean, which part of “Andrew Jackson is my favorite president” didn’t everybody understand?

And given the myriad hilarious, biting ways any half decent professional writer could find to shit in my hat, it underscores how out of touch and classist Abramson and a lot of the media elite are.
This may not seem that bad to anyone who hasn’t been imprisoned, or who hasn’t had a friend of loved one struggle to re-enter society after being locked up. But the millions of formally incarcerated people in this country, it’s a label that hangs heavy around their necks.
However, deploying ex-con as short hand for being bad and unfit for polite society is a tired, fucked up stereotype. It’s used to exclude millions of people, limit their access to employment, strip them of their rights, and lock them into cycles of poverty and crime.
All of which is minor, especially compared to all the plagiarism and made up stuff that’s apparently in the book.
Like, she could have gone with “dirtbag punk rock kid,” which since Ive never been arrested, would certainly be more accurate. though I suspect THAT stereotype is probably too recent for her.
Apparently Jill Abramson describes me as looking like an “ex-convict” which on one hand is hilarious because it shows just how much of a goddamn dinosaur she is and how absolutely out of touch she is with reality.

These are basic, fundamental notions, repeated over and over over and over in the Bible, the Q’aran, the Book of Mormon, the writings of Chuang Tzu. That these children have strayed so far from them is a reflection on our society, on all of us.
What it does NOT do is compel us to teach hatred to those that will follow us. Children learn mockery, bullying, discrimination, and hatred at the feet of their elders. Just like they learn love and understanding and compassion and justice and joy.
And that sort of love demands of us that we accept our sins, accept our failings, openly acknowledge them and then use them as guide posts to avoid causing harm in the future.
And that makes me sad. The greatest lesson taught to us by Christ, by the countless martyrs, is love. Not some sort of accommodating love. But a powerful, forceful love that defends our brothers and sisters who need it, that moves us to actively stand against hate and evil.
And while some within the church like The Oblates of St Francis DeSalles who taught me have at least tried to own these ugly sins and guard against them being propagated into future generations, it’s clear that this is a minority.
It was a planned, purposeful cultural genocide against the defiant remnants of the 1st Nations, sanctioned and carried out by the church, with the help of the United States government. It is a horrific, evil stain upon all Americans who’s names it was carried out in.
THEN the church set up so called “schools” for the native population that was left after the purges. These institutions violently and explicitly stripped the children of the 1st Nations of their language. Their culture. Their traditions. Their basic worth as humans.
This, of course, is false. Christ wept through the decades of slaughter, rape, denigration and abuse that were, and continue to be, perpetrated in his name.
The church first sent priests and other evangelists into North America to convert the peoples of the 1st Nations one way or another. This ideology gave birth to manifest destiny and a general notion that whatever we, as white people, did to them was sanctioned by god.
I was raised Catholic, and I identify as such despite my many disagreements with the church. The priests who taught me the scripture also taught me about the church’s hand in the genocide of the 1st Nations, which makes the Covington HS students so troubling.

Also, there ain’t no Germans walking through the goddamn desert to get in the US. That part is just silly.
Also, the VAST majority of people from Muslim majority countries crossing the southern border do so at ports of entry because they’re coming asking for asylum. And while some MAY now be crossing in remote areas, that’s only cause of Trump admin metering policies at ports
In Agua Prieta, a small Mexican border town, you can buy galoshes made of carpet if you have the money, or squares of old carpet and twine to tie on your feet.
So we’re clear, this story is super doubtful. Finding carpet in the desert where people cross is very common - it’s used to climb over barbed wire, and migrants tie pieces to their shoes to hide their tracks. B/c it’s heavy, the then ditch it.
EVEN if we presume this rancher is real and she found a real prayer rug that was somehow labeled prayer rug or something, the ONLY reason that is of concern to somebody is if they are incredibly racist and stupid and think every Muslim is a terrorist.

@MelindaTaub Coordinated isn’t quite the word, at least not for people outside gop leadership. They exploited the general group think problem any press Corp has, deadline pressures, and the “no shit King is racist where’s my story on the govt defaulting in two hours” attitude of editors
Nobody said shit, including democrats, who just treated king like their racist drunk cousin who you ignore at the reunion, and things like the constant funding showdowns and brinkmanship and bullshit just took up everyone’s time
There’s a lot that went into why reporters went along, way too much for right now. But I think most of us were being pressed on deadline to produce stories that competed with everyone else, editors in most major outlets agreed almost uniformly with the leadership strategy ...
Anyway, I think we as reporters need to be calling King out on his racism, calling out his leaders on these sorts of bullshit perfomative acts of bravery, and coping to the part we played in his long career.
Then one day @BuzzFeedBen told me that a), he was elected like everyone else, b) he wasn’t being starved of oxygen, and c) a member of Congress saying racist ass shit is news, no matter how important or famous they are.  He was, of course, very right.
Again, I know this because they literally said this was their strategy, to me and every other reporter covering the house. It made sense, I guess, or maybe it was just a really successful pressure campaign. Either way, for years we all went along with it.
Boehner, Ryan, Cantor, McCarthy were all afraid to pick a fight with King, Gohmert and other members of the openly racist/antimuslim/sexist as fuck caucus, so their strategy was to put the screws to reporters to starve them of oxygen by not writing about what they said.
This is also 100% garbage. As Whip, McCarthy was in charge of party message discipline. He never did anything but make fun of King’s intelligence  - in private to reporters who he was pressuring to ignore King’s crazy racist rantings. I know because I was one of the reporters https://t.co/3MsiTyTUAI

@DLind @ReichlinMelnick exactly yes. Consequences have never been real things for him, so he doesn’t believe in their existence, which is weirdly logical. Presumably he believes the desert is sandy like a beach and therefore can be traversed by overpriced secret service golf carts with ease.
@DLind Though we’ve established that so long as you turn left, he thinks the desert is a flat, smooth surface easily driven upon by cars loaded with drugs and women with blue tape on their mouths. Which makes ports of entry kind of dumb, when you think about it.

I’ve spent literally years writing about deportees on the Mexican border. I can assure you that a deportee being raped and murdered in Tijuana or Mexicali will having no bearing on a Honduran father’s decision to flee gang terror and state violence w/his children.
US deportation policy is perhaps one of the cruelest aspects of our approach to immigration. It’s specifically designed to be unpleasant, unsafe and terrifying, in the hopes that it will help deter undocumented migration. Obviously it doesn’t, so it’s just pointless cruelty
It will be interesting to see if AMLO makes a stink about the Trump administration’s chronic violations of our bilateral agreement to end late night deportations, which puts people at serious risk of kidnapping, rape and death https://t.co/gyUAt3q2jc

I’ve talked with several MS13 and 18 Street members who left El Salvador because the gangs were trying to force them to join, only to end up being forced to join once they get here - or have what little family they may have here killed.
It is rare for MS13 to target people outside of the Central American community in the US. So really, we are failing those kids who have fled El Salvador under threat from the gang - only to be forced into their service when they arrive here.
MS13 is a US based gang, which our country exported to El Salvador during the anti-Central American immigration scare of the mid 1990s. It now terrorizes Salvadorans both here and in El Salvador.

@erinscafe Avenatti has a show?
In fact, under Trump @dhs has become increasingly punitive in its approach to migrants, including resuming late night deportations which serve no purpose other than to terrorize deportees and put their lives in danger https://t.co/UX4F80YwOt
Which was entirely predictable. In fact, groups like @NoMoreDeaths have been warning about the effect tightening border policies would have on migration patterns and the resulting deaths https://t.co/OGVpRDXrsP
And much of the recent increases have been families and children trying to cross irregularly through the most dangerous parts of the Arizona and New Mexico deserts, driven there by Trump admin asylum policies  https://t.co/X2fzViNNVT
There hasn’t been a sustained increase in irregular crossings by migrants into the United States. In fact, @cbp told members of Congress yesterday numbers in New Mexico are way down compared to last few months https://t.co/WYaxbNV00y
Lest we forget, while in the custody of @cbp one migrant child nearly died of cardiac arrest, Jakelin Caal and Felipe Alonzo Gomez did die, and a 5 month old was hospitalized w/pneumonia after being kept in an “icebox” cell. Since October.

I know because I and other border and immigration reporters have been writing about this for years. Including this story I did in July when it first started happening https://t.co/OGVpREf2Rp
It was clear this would happen. So while they didn’t have the resources or personnel to help Jakelin Caal or Felipe Gomez Alonzo, it’s not like they weren’t warned, repeatedly, that it would happen.
Groups like @KinoBorder and @NoMoreDeaths for years have warned our border policies would result in situations like this. The Sonoran desert @cbp patrols is littered with crosses erected for dead migrants by human rights activists.
While I’m back here and feeling cantankerous, I’ll also point out that @Dhs’ claims that they were caught off guard by migrant families trying to cross through the most dangerous parts of the border is, in a word, false.
It should have been abundantly clear Kelly was playing you when he tried to pawn his own racism off on Jeff Sessions, which is a bit like kicking a coma patient.
I honestly don’t get how you let someone like Kelly, who has been proven to lie repeatedly, with absolutely no shame, to make such patently false statements.
So while John Kelly might want to blame simple ass Jeff sessions forit’s just not true. They were separating families before “zero tolerance” was announced this year. He knew. He directed it. Letting him just lie is malpractice.
And in dec 2017 @aflores reported that they were doing so  https://t.co/tUM3dv7K7n

Although #jakelincaal and #jasonpero never met, and their lives and deaths were uniquely tragic, they do share something in common, a bond forged through coming into contact with law enforcement agencies who see themselves at war with the people they’re supposed to help.
And as 2018 closes, I’m once again writing about the death of someone’s beloved child, this time on the border https://t.co/DrbLTMLwsq
In Tijuana I also made a Folliw This episode on Americans going there for rehab, and wrote about how our drug and deportation policies are flooding this poor city with American addicts https://t.co/DrbLTMLwsq
In Tijuana I interviewed nearly 2 dozen sex workers about how American men, angry that their notions of superiority over women are being challenged by #MeToo are going there to enforce their notions of dominion on poor Mexican women https://t.co/iJtRooDyhh
Speaking of sex workers, I made a television show with @azeen @cwarzel @Scaachi @bimadew  and other great BuzzFeed reporters called Follow This. My first episode was on sex workers who’s lives are being put in jeopardy from new federal anti-trafficking laws
My second story on story on @StormyDaniels was earlier this month when she came to Louisiana to support her home state sexworkers fighting a law that targets only women strippers to “protect” their morals https://t.co/dDlGotQZKR
Then I wrote the first of two stories about @StormyDaniels - in January when she re-emerges publicly following the drama of her suit against Trump in Greenville, South Carolina. https://t.co/4I4RNJstsB
In January, I wrote about the killing of 14 year old #jasonpero by a white deputy while Jason was on his reservation in Wisconsin. The sheriffs dept is also accused of allowing a serial rapist attack native women held in its jail https://t.co/Sb0f5V70o9
2018 was a tough year. I got bells palsy, wrote a bunch of depressing stories, and had friends reach the brink. And of course it’s ending how it started for me: writing about someone’s baby dying after coming in contact with American law enforcement.

Paul Ryan convincing nearly the entire DC press corps (myself included) that he was really very focused on poverty issues ranks with George W Bush's "i like to paint!" as one of the great PR campaigns of the last 10 years
Moreno said they are hoping to talk to other detainees taken into custody with Jakelin Caal, but have not yet. He also says @cbp has no rule against deporting witnesses in investigations such as this, and in the past their actions have been “disappointing.”
Moreno says that despite agency rules requiring @cbp to contact medical professionals when there is a “medical emergency,” they did not do so before putting Jakelin Caal on a bus
Moreno says @cbp has not yet said whether it will turn those documents over the Caal family’s attorneys
Moreno said he is very concerned that in the hours after Jakelin Caal’s death, @cbp was pressing her father, who doesn’t speak english and only some Spanish, to sign forms that were in English, and that he was not clear on what he was signing
Additionally, Attorney Enrique Moreno says @cbp agents knew Jakelin Caal was sick before she was put on the bus to Lordsburg facility, which is an hour and a half drive away.

It’s a most as if trump, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, and Steven Miller don’t ACTUALLY believe all that patriotic smoke they blow up the asses of @cbp rank and file. But that couldn’t be it. MAGA BUILD THE WALL so on and so forth
Even the most well intentioned cbp agents are basically unequipped to help the migrants, the agnostic amongst them have no incentive to try, and the evil, racist fuckers are rewarded for being shitty humans. And then they’re ALL still left with literal shit water to drink.
That &amp; this intense top down view of immigrants as animals combines to make the situation here on the border incredibly deadly. If agents are told they’re animals, given no training to help them, and the go ahead to literally kill migrants, what can we realistically expect?
As of now at any rate, the evidence seems stacked towards a systemic failure at cbp in handling child asylum seekers like Jakelin Caal, and not nefarious actions by agents. They don’t have the training or resources to care for their own, let alone children

Jakelin Caal and her father were not part of the caravan, but rather part of the normal flow of migrants seeking asylum. They did not first attempt to cross in Juarez, per Garcia.
Jakelin Caal’s body has been taken to Laredo, where the Guatemalan govt is preparing to transport her home to her village. Her father visited her body Friday at a funeral home here in El Paso, Garcia says.
Garcia also points out no cause of death or medical records have been released, so it remains unclear how Jakelin Caal died, and is clearly frustrated with gov’t saying it was dehydration.
Annunciation House’s Ruben Garcia says Jakelin Caal went into cardiac arrest multiple times once she was at the hospital, and was revived. Garcia also says her father says she has no history of medical problems.

@pmingram Yeah I think most of that’s a product of domestic pr. Even really shitty Americans get squishy when you tell them “we’re purposefully killing children.”
This hotel bed definitely has plastic sheets under the fitted sheet. Once again I’m staying in a murder room while on assignment.
So, when @jasoninthehouse says ugly shit, being outraged may be appropriate, but so is understanding all he’s doing is saying the quiet part out loud. Just like John Kelly did with the separation policy, and Jeh Johnson before him on the child surge.
And so, our system actually incentivizes @CBP to NOT be prepared to help people. On the contrary, it literally relies on a certain number of people dying because of heat, cold, thirst, exhaustion, snake bites, etc. so as @AdamSerwer says, the cruelty is the point.
But our system of immigration enforcement is based on something called “prevention through deterrence.” Started under President Clinton, it explicitly relies on natural dangers to act as a deterrent (spoiler: they don’t).
Again, even if you’re going to immediately deport them, making sure you’re prepared to help people is pretty basic. Especially once they are in your custody, and by law and natural right they become your responsibility.
I mean, that’s some “look outside and see if it’s raining” common sense.
And be prepared to handle the myriad health problems migrants would suffer from. And given children and families have been coming en mass for a while, it would be prepared for adults, children, pregnant women, people with special needs, etc etc
And after a physically exhausting trip north, with likely little to no money, they weren’t going to have the supplies to deal with it. A humane immigration policy - even one with zero tolerance for migrants, legal or irregular - would understand this.
I just got to El Paso to cover the death of Jakelin Caal, and it’s currently 37 degrees. In Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, where she’s from, the average temp is about 77. It’s safe to assume neither she nor her father had ever conceived of this sort of cold.

Did Chris Cuomo huff a lot of glue when he was younger, or is he just naturally like this?
My last point on this: I get it’s all very shocking to see. CBP has no doubt gone ham under Trump. But they’ve been shooting and killing people INSIDE Mexico for years. In many ways, I’d bet they feel like they’ve been restrained in “just” gassing people today.
And as an aside, this really undermines the creepy fetishization of border patrol by Trump et al as these hyper masculine alpha warriors protecting America. Cause if rocks give you the vapors ....
But rocks? Not so much. Also, did I mention the whole “hey just step back a few feet or GET IN YOUR TRUCK DUDE” approach to a couple of stones being thrown?
In Nogales, the narcos have been known to throw Molotov cocktails - though mostly as s diversionary tactic. But still, that’s dangerous.
This whole “they’re throwing rocks so we have to gas them/shoot them” argument from CBP is so weird. We’re talking about rocks that can be thrown over a 20 food fence - so small - at people who could just back up 5 feet out of range. Or just get in their trucks.

The “here’s how to talk to your racist family” stories followed by “FUCK YOU AND MY CRAZY UNCLE” responses situation has replaced white people going nuts over pumpkin spice as the absolutely worst holiday season tradition. Good job everyone.
It's not particularly comfortable acknowledging that we've done some really, really bad shit to people. I get it. But that's not much of a reason to once again turn a blind eye to the horrors we've unleashed on people. and in El Salvador, we've unleashed a LOT of horrors.
And so, when their government uses US style profiling tactics to target those who dare to speak up, it is incumbent on us, their American brothers and sisters, to stand for them.
while it might feel easier to dismiss them and insist they "take care of their own country," we've made that all but impossible. we are linked in a way that cannot be undone.
Our cultural connections to El Salvador run deep. We've meddled in their politics and economy for more than two centuries, forced ugly wars upon them for our own global power purposes, employed them for low wages to build our homes and cook our food, and even gave them MS13
Now, Salvadoran rappers, b-boys, DJs, and just regular members of the hiphop community are under attack and being disappeared for speaking out against government corruption. https://t.co/NDyciGfe6X
In Brasil, for instance, hiphop inspired by Public Enemy became a way for poor and dispossessed people to raise their voices against power. So, too, in El Salvador, where hiphop has taken root in a major way, thanks in part to the mass deportations of the last 2 decades
it's is #hiphophistory month. One of the things most americans don't realize is how big of an impact hiphop culture has had on other countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America, where it has become the soundtrack to social justice movements.

ESPECIALLY in a place like El Salvador, where hip hop can be a really powerful force for positive change, to uplift people, and maybe, just maybe, undo some of the damage we did by introducing the gangs into their society.
Even if you’re not a hip hop fan, you should be concerned with this. Nobody should be worried that they’ll get snatched up because they’re wearing baggy pants or some new kicks, or have tattoos.
They can detain you basically indefinitely for this. Although some have tried to corrupted hip hop, at its heart it’s a positive, hopeful culture. MCs from @IAmKRSOne to @kendricklamar to El Salvador’s @DebilEstar have shed light on social ills and called for justice.
When I was there last month, so many people warned me about letting my tattoos show and not wearing anything that looked like hip hop gear. And not because the gangs might target me - but because the police profile people who look like they’re into rap.
When the US exported MS13 to El Salvador in the 90s, we also exported hip hop culture. MCs, DJs, b-boys, graffiti artists have flourished in the Salvadoran community - many of whom are now being disappeared for speaking against govt corruption https://t.co/NDyciGfe6X

Anyway, the point to this, if there is one, is that it’s possible to stand up against cruelty and power, it’s possible to raise your voice against injustice, and to do all that with love. Love isn’t weak or accommodating, I’ve learned. It’s in your face and defiant.
They stare down and call out the bad with a fierceness that takes the breath away. And then they smile and laugh and bring joy into this world. Some are conservative, some are liberal. But most don’t really care to fit into that. They just ... do.
I’ve met priests and nuns, doctors and academics, young anarchists and defiant transwomen who despite all the fucked up ugly shit, get up everyday, put their shoes on and get to work making the world better for those without hope - all with a smile on their face
It’s funny. I’ve covered the cruelty of all this from both sides: first as a political reporter, and now writing about what that means on the ground, you’d think I’d be cynical as fuck. And you’d be right. But I’m also still hopeful, oddly enough
Regardless of your party or political ideology, the least of us need the rest to be looking out for them and not throwing up barriers to survival. That’s the whole point. But way too many have lost the script
That so many of our fellow humans - some good, some bad, but all dealing with circumstances that would drive many of us to madness  - are watching all THIS, knowing they could be ground under heel, is shameful. We shouldn’t have a system that assumes them to be an after thought
That said. It’s also made this election much more scary. Because if you dear reader, or I, have anxiety about racist, sexist, horrible people openly and actively controlling the most powerful country on earth, just imagine what they’re going through.
They’re some of the most shit upon, forgotten people in our society. And I’d trust them all with my life more than almost anybody I covered in my old life.
This is the first election I haven’t covered in like 2 decades. Instead of politicians, their staff, operatives, and lobbyists I deal with migrants, sex workers, addicts, gangsters, anarchists and priests. And sister, lemme tell ya

you want to fight about asylum policy, immigration policy more broadly, or whether we owe anything to the countries from which these people come? have fucking at it. but just don't make them scenery for your hot takes.
but reducing them to b-roll footage for a domestic political fight that will be forgotten in a few days IF THEY ARE LUCKY is beyond the fucking pale.
Since the Monroe Doctrine, the United States has treated the people of Central America like inanimate objects whose only real purpose is to act as props in our "no MY dick is bigger" display on the world stage. That's fucked up enough for several hundred lifetimes of guilt
whether or not you think they should be given comfort is one thing. but reducing their pain to a feature of our domestic political collapse is just absolutely fucking inhumane and cruel.
Because, you see, these are actual living, breathing people. They don't have twitter. they're not CGI extras in a giant goddamn movie battle. they're not Bill Clinton's illegitimate cyborg babies. They're humans. Poor, suffering, terrified, desperate humans.
Everyone seems to be focused on whether or not the caravan is being overly hyped, and whether or not one party or the other is trying to use it for political gain. which are both legitimately the most fucked up, stupid arguments i've ever had the misfortune to stumble into

If you were covering a charismatic conman who used hyperbolic lies to bilk people of money, you wouldn’t just repeat the random shit that came out of his mouth or his spokesperson. It’s not goddamn rocket science.
All day today CNN personalities referred to Trump’s obvious lie about unknown Muslims in the caravan as a thing he said “without providing evidence.” Which allows for it being true. Which at this point, is malpractice.

Others, I guess, see strength as grinding others under foot, punching harder, twisting the knife with a particularly unique and cruel way. For them strength isn’t love and empathy, it’s power, control, and dominance. Which seems lonely and terrible.
I guess it speaks to what you see as strength. For me, it’s a man who wanted no part of the world, who loved his books and his god, but when confronted with absolute cruelty stood up and said, simply, “no.” And he kept saying no until the moment he was killed for it.
@robert_mariani Oh nah. I once did, but then I stopped covering politicians and started covering people.
But still. From the looks of things on twitter, it’s been an especially insane couple of days. Or day. Or hours. It’s hard to tell anymore.
Im not naive, so I didn’t expect to leave for a few days and San Romero would perform an Uber miracle on his canonization and teach our president humility or grace. Not even god could pull that off.
On a serious note. It’s really sad to come home from celebrating the life of San Romero, who gave up everything and defied the most powerful forces on earth, who gave his life for the least ... to find the president of my country is still petty, racist, sexist and small.
@Walldo That’s a serious racist feedback loop

There’s a ska band playing a song about San Romero. This is amazing
@spectatrcitizen Yup!
As for anyone who tells you it is dangerously radical to believe in lifting up your brothers and sisters? Well they stand to gain the most from people with some turning their backs on those with none.
That’s ... not radical. It’s hard, for sure. And even when you try to live by it, you’ll fail sometimes. But seeing the poor, the oppressed, and the dispossessed as equal humans deserving of love and support isn’t some crazy notion Karl Marx came up with.
The irony of course is that San Romero was neither a communist nor particularly radical. He was a quiet, kind, book nerd. But he also believed in what should be a basic concept - that we are called by God to give comfort and care to our brothers and sisters in need.
It’s more than a little jarring and shameful to realize the pope is canonizing a man who was martyred as a direct result of the US deeming the notion that we should put the needs of the poor above the bottom lines of the wealthy as dangerously radical. And did so in our names https://t.co/lBJ8hHAVAW
And it also speaks to the immense, cruel indifference of the wealthiest and most well off of the human family. To our eternal shame.
It speaks to the human capacity for hope that this sort of celebration can occur in a country that has been turned into a bloody battle ground by 3 decades of American wars against ideas. War against communism, against drug use, against immigration https://t.co/JEbuSzeWzd
Because of the time difference between Rome and San Salvador, people will be out here until 4 am. And it’s not just people who remember Romero and lived through the war. There’s so many groups of young people born a decade or more here as well. https://t.co/EwRsgZGVIt
According to friends who live here (and a very very concerned Uber driver), the cathedral where the celebration is happening is in an extremely dangerous part of San Salvador. So it’s especially nice to see so many people out dancing, singing, praying and enjoying their space
It’s after midnight, but thousands of people are still in the Centro plaza in San Salvador, waiting for Pope Francis to formally announce the canonization of Oscar Romero. https://t.co/Uzr1S8aRio

And so even though its clear that they way we think about and treat addiction is clearly failing, we just keep pushing that same stone up that same hill. And that dooms 1000s of people to a cycle of addiction, temp recovery and relapse, until they end up dying.
But the fact that it's not legal in the US -- and that studying it here is exceedingly difficult -- highlights a major problem with our drug policies. Innovation and alternative treatments are largely discouraged by our legal and social systems.
It's also expensive, costing in some cases thousands of dollars a week to go to these rehabs. And it's NOT a cure for addiction. Even under the best circumstances, it simply helps patients end withdrawal and potentially avoid relapses in the early stages of recovery
And while Ibogaine does seem to help in some cases, it's also very dangerous. It can cause heart attacks in patients, and must be administered in carefully controlled settings with medical professionals ready to help patients.
Ibogane, for instance, has shown some promise in helping with kicking heroin, crystal and opioids. But because it's a schedule 1 drug in the United States, you can't get it here. So people are going to Mexico for treatment in unregulated rehab centers.
Every one of the Americans seeking treatment in Mexico I spoke with had tried therapy, in patient, out patient, group, AA etc etc rehab treatments in the US. None of them work, and they were willing to risk the dangers of experimental treatments for a shot at getting clean
In my latest Follow This episode, I looked at the new rehab tourism boom in Mexico. Failed by our outdated rehab system,  Americans are heading to Mexico in search of dangerous, experimental treatments like Igobane or prison-like rehabs for help https://t.co/AB4SJXzMD2 https://t.co/U6ASBzXojZ

@MarkAselstine Heh, maybe not quite that, but damn close. And yes, Beto is a particular candidate - I’ve watched him do retail politics. He’s a natural at it. People eat that up
@spect8rcitizn I mean maybe. I’ve literally heard that before though. He’s good at elections.
Not to take anything away from Beto for putting pressure on Cruz, but Texans keep re-electing Gohmert. So i mean. It’s not like Cruz needs to blaze a new hipster trail. He could just, you know, be a regular ass Texas Republican and probably win.
I don’t get Ted Cruz tryna be the “cool” archconservative who relates to the youths. John Cornyn, a dude who’s eaten more fancy shit than I ever will, makes stereotype jokes about sushi. Reelection=done. Cruz, meanwhile, has memed his way into a tight race.
