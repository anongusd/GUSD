Regardless of what Michael Cohen told Congress about Donald Trump's investments in Russia, there is a letter from the president outlining those (non) investments the he sent to @LindseyGrahamSC that he expected would be made public, but that has not been. https://t.co/YoV636J0nv

Summits that seem like failures at the time (https://t.co/HusRKWfZ0J) don't always turn out that way. https://t.co/5UkCtJFjRL
What's the standard for believing people who don't tell the truth? Does Micahel Cohen's having admitted to lying make him more or less of a reliable than a person who has told verifiable lies but doesn't admit them? If the latter can be trusted in some cases, why not the former?

*making an assumption

If a liar tells me it’s raining do I disbelieve them if I am getting wet?
Why would people believe an admitted professional liar like Michael Cohen?  But does that mean there is zero recognition of truth in //anything// he says? When he describes covering for things Donald Trump has said that are untrue is that something Cohen critics find fantastical?
The timing here obviously is interesting relative to the president’s request at about this time that “Russia if you’re listening...”

@Ed_Realist But Eisenhower named Brennan, a Democrat (and Catholic) because he was worried enough. This also works the other way. Dirksen knew Nixon would win in 68 (why Warren retired!) but helped Johnson with Thornberry and Fortas (until late September).

@DennisPCrawford @JohnJHarwood Yes, but by the narrow historical claim, that doesn’t apply because Kennedy was nominated in ‘87– the claim was nominated and confirmed. How that connects to the spirit of the larger claim about voters having their say is up for debate.
But Brennan was a recess apointment in ‘56 not confirmed by Democrats ‘till ‘57. McConnell: correct! But: recess appointment &amp; confirmations in election years undermine idea it was Sen. norm justices coldn’t be confirmed b/c voters had to have their say— the Garland rationale.
The @senatemajldr &amp;I had a disagreement about 1956.

Today the president said: "My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me, and some others; they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia...I don't see any reason why it would be." This is more than putting Putin's word on par 1/2

In 2019 Donald Trump could, in addition to having control the White House, retain near-control of a sympathetic Congress and have a Supreme Court with a clear conservative majority, 20% of whose members he put there. How many presidents have had that level power &amp; unity?

@chrislhayes Yes, and under ZT they're getting rejected under any circumstance. I was just trying to see if the numbers are available to tighten up that narrow corner of the story.
@chrislhayes If 6 in 1000 incidents of families crossing are not real families (based on government numbers) and those cases prompted the new policy, according to officials, what is the "cost" in valid asylum claims per 1000 that would have been denied as a result of new ZT policy?
How many asylum claims have been determined as valid at non points of entry in any recent pre-zero tolerance period?
@jazzRodeo But that was private, right?

@juliagriffin @RealHousewifeMD That's what makes it extraordinary that it was deployed!
Among the things that makes this episode extraordinary-- and different from travel ban, etc.-- is that the Attorney General and press secretary defended policy that forced family separation as supported by the Bible.
@wtsparrow agreed.
@JavierF_R Yes, essentially.
@Gallagher4NY I disagree! But then again, what if I didn't.
@JavierF_R I was thinking about the deterrent aspect, but presumably the courts would have acted pretty quickly, initiating move (with a court pretext) to separation. Ensuing fight would have been on firmer ground. Thinking of it with administration goals in mind, execution seems flawed
@monabenach and it lacks the deterrent aspect.
What if the administration had started first with the policy of this EO and let the courts force them afresh to either revert to catch and release or separating families?
@SkyMcKinley Understanding where new law and practice deviates from what came before helps me understand what is new. It's why @Dlind updating the story from 2014 was so helpful.

@IvanTheK I am going to figure out how to offer bundled content!
@IvanTheK I realize that these deals are also more than just content: Fox has overseas delivery systems that Comcast wants so that they can force the international audience to watch their content too.
@IvanTheK By the way: Thank you for helping me work this out when I'm sure you have something better to do with your morning.
@IvanTheK Scale player meaning what in this context? Someone with money to distribute, market and swamp consumers (you must watch this movie!) or scale in terms of I have the pipe and will front load this in your homes whether you like it or not. (Or both?)
@IvanTheK When Microsoft went from being a software co. to one that started competing for share of internet profits in early/mid 90s it wasn't because AOL had a better operating system (i.e. direct competition) it's that MS feared the OS &amp; software was shrinking -- wanted piece of new pie
@IvanTheK Another way to frame: There is a battle for content. Traditional creators like Disney are in the scrum and are now having to compete with companies from a different  part of the delivery food chain that want to get in on the action because their core product isn't as profitable.
@IvanTheK And going back to that original paragraph: Netflix isn't really a "threat" to a company if it operates a different business, is it? I mean, it's a move driven by pressures inside a company to find profits in greener pastures.
@IvanTheK I wish more reporting made that point. I keep hearing jargon. Companies like ATT and Comcast, who made money bringing content to the home can't keep making $ that way, so they have to start owning the content that comes through the pipe no matter what kind of pipe it is.
@IvanTheK But aren't I getting my internet connection through my cable box? (I mean, I actually am). But your point is that the pipe is no longer where the $ is at so everyone must become content creators?
Why is Netflix a threat to Comcast as this paragraph suggests? As the largest cable company isn't Netflix and all chord cutting giving Comcast more subscribers who are willing to pay higher fees for good content? https://t.co/T4GGtkLZy9

On all other issues, both policy and cultural, what % of their energy matches the statements, hearings and work they've done to oppose him on tariffs. That will give some indication of their actual motivation versus what they do or don't say. 3/3
A similar standard can be used for the response from members of the president's party to evaluate the outer edge of their willingness to debate the opposite side of an issue with President Trump. 2/3
The president is very focused on tariffs. That's the standard against which his seriousness on other issues should be measured, right? So on immigration or school safety, for example, his focus and determination is what % of what it is on tariffs.  1/3

Also: Assuming for the purposes of argument maximum FBI malfeasance, the stuff leaked to date about Papadopoulos and Manafort is still more damaging than anything ever leaked about Carter Page, right? https://t.co/4kwcpRCJqE
What is the theory for how a FISA warrent of Page 17 days before the election was going to keep Donald Trump from being elected? Findings would be leaked &amp; voters would be outraged? If so why not leak information FBI had since summer from investigation of Papadopoulos &amp; Manafort?

The Nunes memo may be a partisan document, but it lives or dies based on the strength of its content which must be assessed. This is a reason not to dismiss it out of hand. If you agree, read First sentence and substitute “Steele dossier” for “Nunes memo.” Discuss.

...Especially since the memo in passage @davidafrench cites describes the agent who opened the Papadopoulos investigation as a leaker to the press who favored Clinton. https://t.co/bQMr15Xvjm
So if the memo confirms that and the FBI “deep state” knew about Papadopoulos for so long why, if the “deep state” was hell bent on keeping Donald Trump out of office, did the Papadopoulos News never get leaked? Didn’t FBI have Papadopoulos news for months before election? https://t.co/AuJ1gepfoq
@DraftRyan2016 That’s my hope.
@UltimateCrans I have proved that for 49 years.
Whatever history concludes about the Nunes memo, it really could have used an editor to help its authors make the case more clearly.
@thedawnwestlake @GOP Also, funding for dossier didn’t start with RNC. It started with Washington Free Beacon and its primary funder.

@natched @dave_in_sa I may very well be too stupid. There is ample evidence to make a case on a range of issues. However, on this issue the article I linked to that you claim is mine is not. I am not a reporter  for the Washington Post named Devlin Barrett or Karoun Demirjian.
@nycsouthpaw I read it as the former though in the current context I can see how some might have thought it was the latter.
@nycsouthpaw I assume b) is underway and not developed yet. Pointing out what SOP is and why DOJ IG is investigating this nevertheless would be helpful since presumably IG knows DOJ policy.
@nycsouthpaw Isn't your beef with the IG who is investigating on these grounds or are you saying the Post has it wrong and the IG isn't investigating.
@bradripka Is your argument is that the DOJ IG doesn't know DOJ policy?
@MissMaren5 I'm assuming there is sufficient deviation from DOJ policy for the DOJ IG to be interested in asking questions.
@dave_in_sa The piece says that's what the DOJ IG is looking into. It would be surprising if he was unfamiliar with DOJ policy.

Thinking about firing someone is not the same as firing someone, but thinking about firing someone so much that your FBI director (in the case of McCabe) and WH counsel (in the case of the Mueller) threaten to resign, is not simply noodling an alternative.
