I heard Nikki Haley is retiring to spend more time with her curtains

Taylor Swift sold out arenas in red states for the entire Reputation tour and THEN comes out as as a Democrat		I’m not sure if that’s cowardly or just hilarious
I’m sorry, Complicit Taylor can’t come to the phone right now...		Why?		CAUSE SHE’S DEAD!
If your phone still rings out loud when someone calls you, you were born before 1980
100% of the time when someone’s phone goes off in a meeting, the baby boomers glare at the millennials first. 		Sorry you don’t recognize your own ringtone Brenda, my phone has been on silent since 2012.
um how did u get this number

@EWErickson Erick, if you would spend the next 48 hours dealing with whatever has caused you to tweet in Kavanaugh’s defense 218 times in the last week, you’d be doing humanity a favor
When you’re a woman, there is nothing in the world scarier than an angry drunk man.		Nothing.

Republican logic on #SCOTUS right now:		Dems: let’s use fake sexual assault allegations to derail a SCOTUS nominee	*Gorsuch gets nominated*	Dems: nah not that one	Dems: shit, hope another seat opens up before the midterms so we can do the fake sexual assault thing
@SearlTom @EWErickson So by your logic		Dems: let’s use fake sexual assault allegations to derail a Supreme Court nominee	Dems: nah not that nominee	Dems: let’s just wait and cross our fingers that another seat opens up before the midterms so we can do the fake sexual assault thing
@EWErickson If this was the Dem plan all along for SCOTUS nominees, why now? Why not with Gorsuch?
If Democrats really had some evil master plan to derail Trump nominees with sexual assault allegations, why were there none ever put forward against Gorsuch? Or any of Trump’s cabinet members, for that matter?		#SCOTUS #StopKavanagh
@EWErickson “Please pause the confirmation hearings” does not equal “rush to find him guilty” but kk with your white man hysteria

#BachelorInParadise but with all the old Bachelors and Bachelorettes who got engaged to “the love of their life” at the end of their season but broke up within 10 months bc the whole concept of this franchise is ridiculous
My friends get engaged after 2 years of dating: “omg u barely know each other”		#BachelorInParadise couples break up after like 90 seconds of drunk beach makeouts: “I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU, WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU HOW DARE YOU”
Lock her up. https://t.co/n4EbZvxW1u

Holding on to relevant documents concerning a Supreme Court nominee bc “executive privilege” is #NotCoachella.		Calling police brutality a “distraction” is #NotCoachella.		Penning anonymous op-eds instead of taking real action is #NotCoachella.
Hot take: I care more about Brett Kavanaugh’s impending confirmation than this stupid op-ed.
Hey Donald, what do you call it when a presidential candidate and his staff collude with a hostile foreign power to influence election results? https://t.co/I4Ob8YDJld
Anyone else totally underwhelmed by this New York Times op-ed business? Trump’s a deranged buffoon, we knew that. His staff are slightly smarter than him but self-interested and also slightly deranged, we knew that too.
We’re about to see some really fiery NFL tweets y’all #NYTimes https://t.co/qniiWEAGaY

But like...does Colton lose his virginity to the first fantasy suite girl in the lineup? 		Or the one he likes best at that point? 		Or are his fantasy suite dates a “kiss and cuddle” situation? 		I have so many questions #TheBachelor

I have no idea what “power rankings” mean outside of the context of 2020 presidential hopefuls. Is it a sports thing?
I will click on any article that says “Power ranking of potential 2020 Democratic candidates.” I hate myself every time, but I will click.
