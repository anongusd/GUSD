Daily Nation refused to publish for obvious reasons. CNN published this Larry's piece. https://t.co/lbFJC5hWxP

Did I get it right? The General has been deported to Canada or Canaan?
@wawamelany Personally counted 6. 1 is a creation of the #MediaShutDownKE &amp; that's what @UKenyatta @WilliamsRuto @FredMatiangi @NPSOfficial_KE wants you and I to believe so that #FreeMigunaMigunaNow fizzles
6 people shot dead by police in Ahero, Kisumu during #FreeMigunaMigunaNow protests.
@ezraCHILOBA The only fake news I know @ezraCHILOBA is illegal declaration you made of @UKenyatta &amp; @WilliamsRuto that led to @NPSOfficial_KE butchering innocent babies including.
@StateDept @UKenyatta .. .to continue masquerading as President and DP. Kenyans will #Resist however much you try to lend legitimacy to an illegal govt.
@StateDept @UKenyatta The US has no moral authority to speak about Kenya or Kenyans. That window was closed when your ambassador @BobGodec rushed 2 rubber stamp a flawed process that was overturned by the Supreme Court. @USEmbassyKenya continues to support the 2 musketeers @UKenyatta &amp; @WilliamsRuto
@OfficialTeron Any mungiki oath that's aimed at massacre is obviously illegal
@FredMatiangi as a chinkororo member you allowed Mungiki aka NBC to administer indecent oaths using blood and skinned goats in Lucky Summer, yet there was nothing wrong with that. You only seem to have a problem with decent oaths. #MediaShutDownKE TJ Kajwang
@FredMatiangi As a self-confessed chinkororo member whose security officers always act like militia, you have no legal &amp;/or moral authority to proscribe any group. You should have started by prescribing one @FredMatiangi as an outlawed militia No. 1
Finally, MCK has spoken on #MediaShutDownKE https://t.co/O4uRfZqVU9

@realDonaldTrump Just pretending John. You care because of the selfish interests the US has in Iran. So many innocent people were murdered by police here in Kenya and thrown into the lake but you never cared, y? Coz Kenya is a strategic partner in a troubled region. Save us the hypocrisy!
@Donsarigo In @WilliamsRuto and @UKenyatta we have 2mafias . Look at Msando's mother, crying &amp; in pain coz she can't afford her drugs, 4 the sake of her son who's handed u the presidency, y not even pretend to care 4her? Suppose it was Mama Ngina or that peasant in Sugoi? #LoggedOutForever
@Donsarigo Lead killers @UKenyatta and @WilliamsRuto watched with their wives &amp; kids, but were never pricked an inch coz their hands r filthy of blood of so many innocent Kenyans. Kuria who sniffed life out of Msando with sadistic excitement must be high on something now. #LoggedOutForever
@Donsarigo that was a bit shallow esp. by leaving out a key person of interest Moses Kuria who made a prior FB post, which turned out to have some lead on where Msando's car was first to be found of course with Kuria at the scene @YvonneOkwara did superb! #LoggedOutForever
