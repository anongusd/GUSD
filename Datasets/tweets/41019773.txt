What I wrote for US News 5 years ago - "[I]n 2012, I had a front row seat to Warren‚Äôs dubious claims. While she succeeded in stonewalling the press then, it‚Äôs an issue that will surely re-emerge if she one day runs for president." https://t.co/T13sttCuqw
Boston Herald columnist @IAmMGraham to @ewarren - "In the past you‚Äôve tried to bob and weave your way around questions about why every law school you worked at listed you as a minority faculty member....We now know that you were lying." https://t.co/ufDw40TGf5
Key point here -  @ewarren knew then her statement wasn't true - "Back in 2012, when news first hit that Warren had been recorded as an American Indian in various faculty directories, she insisted she was unaware of the listing and hadn‚Äôt asked for it." https://t.co/y3NpFcMQRx
Sounds like the Democrats certainly have their hands full in the Commonwealth this week.  https://t.co/cLYKmcfnlo
It seems my op-ed on @ewarren from 2014 has aged well - "In fact, it was not until she was in her 30s and focused on climbing the highly competitive ladder of law school academia that Warren apparently rediscovered her Native American heritage." https://t.co/T13sttCuqw
Great non-political story in the Post today on @lukecombs - one of the rising stars in country music. cc: @kurtbardella  https://t.co/5Rqf8ZvkGQ
It directly undercuts what she's been saying for 7 years - "The revelation seems to undercut her long-held contention that she never used her claim of Native American heritage in a professional setting that may help her career." https://t.co/hjeHqbal74
Only took 7 years.... https://t.co/6NOQnd9enx
Also the Boston Globe investigation on Warren‚Äôs lie clearly wasn‚Äôt that thorough if they missed this last year - ‚ÄúThe Post obtained Warren‚Äôs registration card for the State Bar of Texas, providing a previously undisclosed example of Warren identifying as an ‚ÄúAmerican Indian.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs be clear - Warren didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúfurther confusion about tribal citizenship.‚Äù This was a practice called ‚Äúchecking the box‚Äù in the pre-Internet days in which she lied about being a minority in order to game the system and to advance her career. https://t.co/pk7PBNbsa3

@JRubinBlogger Disagree here. He cosponsored legislation that would lead to a specific outcome but he‚Äôs now saying he apparently a) Didn‚Äôt know that and/or b) doesn‚Äôt support that outcome. So begs the question did Booker a) sign onto a bill w/out reading or b) isn‚Äôt being upfront w/ voters now
So why then did Senator Booker endorse the Sanders "Medicare for All" bill - and why is he still a co-sponsor? It would eliminate almost every existing private insurance policy within four years. https://t.co/BEK4m661Cs

Eliminating private insurance and replacing it with a government-run program is literally what the Sanders bill does. Senator Warren is a co-sponsor of the Sanders bill. Explains why she's now trying to duck the issue. https://t.co/j8sbwnWWtK
It seems those running in 2020 are finding it's easier to just say you're for "Medicare for All" than it is having to actually explain and defend that policy position. @ewarren won't be able to dodge this forever though.  https://t.co/n8NikoyNeR
Good column on the rise of employer-coverage via @axios - key point - "That's why Kamala Harris' comment this week about doing away with private health insurance, as part of a Medicare for All plan, exposes the danger for Democrats..." https://t.co/9x1hpLDKAm
