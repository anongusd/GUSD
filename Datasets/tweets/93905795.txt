fact that Ds lost MN-1 in ’18 against an R who tied himself to Trump says that Ds can’t rely on Rochester/Mankato/Austin to cancel out the rural areas.But, even a small swerve against Trump with his base(which isn’t out of the question given what’s happening now)might hurt.
Also agree with @kkondik about MN-1. “Likely R” a little strong but among the rematches that might take place from last year (GA7, IL-13, a gazillion in TX), this one is probably near the bottom as far as flipping.
@kkondik MI-11 may be slightly different because Epstein was such a notoriously poor candidate (Trump’s co-chair, the Rent-A-Rabbi thing) but absent a big mistake by Stevens, the year will not allow her to lose.
@kkondik True. Slotkin has to be “Lean D” because she’s new&amp;it’s early but, her ability to win this time says the seat is hers. Mike Bishop didn’t lose because he’s Mike Bishop, he lost because he was an R in a light Trump carried by swing against him.

Funny how a Sen.well-situated in one seat often has colleagues in the other who come&amp;go.Jesse Helms, who served 30 years had 7 different colleagues,mostly because the guy in the other seat was defeated every 6 years. Dick Durbin, first elected in 1996, has had six. One was Obama
@JMilesColeman That's right. Hollings was the longest serving junior senator in history. He finally got a two-year stint as the Palmetto State's senior when Thurmond finally stepped down at 100 before retiring in 2004
I'm wondering whether the all-time records of two same state Senators serving together the are MS, where Eastland and Stennis were colleagues for 31 years, followed by AR, where McClellan and Fulbright were state mates for 30. Grassley and Harkin also served together 30
Ironically, in 1980, a pair of two other Washington State Senators,Warren Magnuson and Scoop Jackson served together longer than any other delegation that year, before Magnuson lost his bid for reelection.
The two Senators from the same state now serving together the longest is WA where Patty Murray was elected in 1992&amp;Maria Cantwell in 2000.Never would've predicted that would be the case when either was first elected. Before 2017, it was Feinstein/Boxer followed by Shelby/Sessions

@JMilesColeman Course,as the cycle developed,things changed.Bryan(NV)retired,making that seat an obvious bye-bye,as did Lautenberg(NJ)&amp;Kerrey(NE)which Ds held(Moynihan announced early).And John Chafee's death basically took a probable Dem pickup in RI off the table as Lincoln was appointed

@mark_greenbaum @SenhorRaposa Right. I always heard that lack of GOTV was costly and that, early in the evening, Rahm Emanuel thought they picked up the seat.Also didn't help that voters had to go from Freudenthal to Craig Thomas and back to Trauner. May've been too much in a state like Wyoming.
@SenhorRaposa The man Cheney replaced, Teno Roncalio, was the last Dem Wyoming ever sent to Congress, in 1976. Two others, John Vinich and Gary Trauner, came within fewer than 1,500 votes in 1988 and 2006 but couldn't seal the deal.
Okay,I'll try this tweet again.I don't condone what Tlaib said, especially in front of her own young kids(which raises serious jusgement questions).But we were challenged to find Trump saying something nearly as bad.Adam Schiff (a.k.a., Adam "Schitt as Trump tweeted)could answer
@amyewalter While I understand the fascination, I've long said the media is creating AOC. She doesn't run the House -she's a freshman. At least when DeMint and Cruz got all of the attention, it was because in the Senate, one person could bring everything to a halt.
@amyewalter I think the only reason the answer is no it's because she's not constitutionally eligible by virtue of the fact that she was born in 1989 and would only be 31. A bigger question is whether Rashida Tlaib will be her running mate

@mlow29 That I do.
@shannongkane Tell that to AOC.
RT @shannongkane: What Rep. Tlaib said was wrong. Full stop. 		We can’t condemn Trump and then not hold our own accountable.
Now that, for Shala LA, the hard part of winning is over, the question will be whether she faces a tough primary in '20.I've always said she's better at policy than politics so, incumbency will help her.But the demographics don't.
Donna Shalala may be one of the oldest rookies on the Hill but her years of contacts will ensure that her time will be strong. She will be taking a seat on the all-powerful Rules Committee.
@JoshCrawfordNE @ForecasterEnten That may come later but right now, the trajectory is on par with 2007-08.True,things .ight change if there's a Dem administration post '20 but that'll impact the party - not her. That would be her last term as Speaker.
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa Actually, I guess absentees brought Maloney up to 55-45% but still less than stellsr.The district is not strongly Democratic but the year was.
Monday and Tuesday are busy days for new governors.Newsom,Evers,Walz and Sisolak take the reins on Monday while DeSantis goes on Tuesday.
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa One person who will require help from the '22 remap is Sean Patrick Maloney. Took a rather tepid 53% last year. There's generally Dem turf that Engle&amp;Lowry could spare but with remap prob costing N.Y. 2 seats,he'll need some from up North as well.
An example of how things change. After the 2012 remap, Michigan's First Cong.District was the only one drawn to be remotely competitive. Now, other than the 4th&amp;maybe the 10th, it is the safest in the state for either party.Even MI-2,while tough,may be more flippable for Ds.

With Frelinghuysen and LoBiondo gone, are Chabot, Jones and Thornberry the only remaining GOP members from the class of '94 still in the House don't think I missed anybody)?Graham and Wicker are obviously still in the Senate.

On other hand, Liz Cheney, who placed McCarthy's name i n nomination, had the charisma of her father. Still, if she doesn't run for the Senate, I could see her as a future House GOP leader.
Wow! I just watched Hakeem Jeffries placed Pelosi's name in nomination for Speaker&amp;it was masterful ("NDP-Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi").Said since he was elected that he'd land on a ticket some day and he needs to be at the top of any Dem nominee's list for VP in '20

@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa Don't get me wrong - I think it would be a bad idea for TX to redistrict prior to '22 as it would stifle competition in half-a-dozen seats.But they may well do it if they fear losses so, that's what I was thinking.

@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa If TX does late-decade remap to make a Travis vote sink(accommodated by Carter leaving).It'd leave the Bexar portion Doggett holds open but,to protect Hurd,wonder if Conway would part with Tom Green(San Angelo)and next door Irion).His base is Midland.
@JMilesColeman Saw that Beto lost Kennedy County, Texas lopsidedly even though it voted for Clinton back in the day but there's also a Reagan County.Looks like Cruz won the 828 voters 692-136.Clinton was slightly more competitive, failing 651-337.

@mlow29 @SenhorRaposa Actually, if projections stand,Ds may actually benefit.Looking like CA will lose 1 but that IL only drops 1&amp;MN might actually keep  8.Makes it easier for Ds to preserve what they have in the latter two. CA Ds would be hard-pressed to being back anyway so losing one no big whoop
@ASFried Oh, okay. I thought today was the Appeals Court but I guess it was the panel.
@TomLavinNH I'll say for the record that Claire McCaskill was probably the best Senator in the past couple of Congresses.
@TomLavinNH I agree and most of the rest were defeated.That was also the case with many Dems early in the decade, at least starting in 2010. This nonsense about purging centrists is why so little gets done.
@ASFried I know but will he appeal to SCOTUS and while, I don't see them not seating Golden until they hear the case, I have a funny feeling about how they'll rule in the end.
@mlow29 @SenhorRaposa Not sure post '20 map will be less favorable for Ds.Yes, many of the losses are in blue states but Ds now control or have say in most.Also, a few GOP states are losing too&amp;those gaining are no longer red but quintessential swing or even blue&amp;urban areas where new seats will go.
Ironically, if ranked-choice is upheld, I wonder if that could save Collins should she run again in '20 which, if I had to guess, I'd say she does under heavy pressure from McConnell. But that's speculation with nothing to back up at this point
I will say that if Poliquin somehow overcomes the odds and is awarded the seat, he is finished come 2020. The Second district might not have put ranked-choice over the top but Mainers are, common-sense people who don't go for sore losers
I have a feeling SCOTUS is going to hear the Maine's ranked-choice law and who knows how they'll rule (well, I kind of have an idea how they'll rule). I don't think they'll stay the election and prevent Golden from taking office in January, however.
@nathanlgonzales Not only that but Beto has also served three terms in Congress. Trump's three predecessors all lost their first races for the house though Obama was already in the State Senate.
@SenhorRaposa Case in point about WY Governor's races. If that erratic 78-year old millionaire had won the GOP primary, the race would have been a toss-up and maybe even a Democratic win
@SenhorRaposa By the way, ID's drought might not continue forever.The state is now projected to get the 440th House seat but, I wouldn't be surprised if it snuck in and gained a 3rd one.Ada County had a light blue streak this year but Rs would prob.crack it 3 different ways for 3 safe seats
@SenhorRaposa Utah at least has a hot Congressional race every now and again. By the way, I'd say Wyoming and even Idaho are just as boring as Delaware only once in a blue moon, there's a governor's race worth watching
@SenhorRaposa For starters, it's because there's so little change. Most of the time, the Cong.delegation simply has to file for re-election and they're in and Rs haven'tbeen competitive for governor since 1984(Castle was the last R in both). Christine O'Donnell made up for 40 years of boredom

Who wants to break into Trump that a president really can't shut down the government because Congress won't fulfill his campaign promise. It's one thing to do so, as Obama had to, because House Rs wouldn't budge unless a standing law(ACA) was defunded
RT @CWR4: @CrassPolitical @amyewalter Think her point is that if the economy is bad it could have been much worse.
@mlow29 @SenhorRaposa Question is how safe Susie Lee will be. Obviously, the loss of the rurals will shore Horsford up so it will probably be 2-1-1, though even Washoe's growth may eventually make NV-2 unpredictable
@DavidZavac @amyewalter That's what I mean. I guess Ohio was one place where it did work but that's an exception. And you could also say that even though Trump did campaign for the ticket, Buckeye State residents weren't nec. voting for him.

@nathanlgonzales Oh absolutely. But his turf spans much of the southern part of the state. And Kinzinger might run statewide in '22 if he even sticks around that long.
@nathanlgonzales IL is going to be fascinating whether Rodney Davis holds on or not. With the census news today suggesting the state only loses 1 seat, not 2, look for Ds to create a Southern IL University vote sink while combing 2 Rs (maybe Shimkus&amp;Bost). Result could be a 14-3 Dem delegation.
@nathanlgonzales Guessing it will be 4-1-1. Schrader will get a safe seat as he took one for the team last time (though he might not have helped himself in the Pelosi matter). The question is whether it's the new seats that is made solid D or DeFazio's.

Actually, let me elaborate on my previous point. When I say Davids is infinitely safer, it's not so much because three legislators switch ed parties it's because they  are now effectively eliminated as opponents
Sharice Davids would have been difficult to topple in 2020 as it was but with three moderate GOP women switching parties, it looks like her prospects for re-election are growing as high as KS corn
The demise of what now makes up NY-27 has been predicted for three redistricting cycles but, this time, assuming Ds don’t win it post-Collins, it may become a reality. Ds control the process and it can be distributed between NY-23,26 and possibly even 25.

Pelosi’s compromise was a win-win given vow to only be a transitional Speaker. Hoyer will finally learn post-’22 if caucus finally wants him as Speaker. How Clyburn made out is mixed but he still may have a chance to become Maj. Leader (wasn’t likely to become Speaker anyway)

@kkondik  @JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa Example of how GOP egregiously gerrymandered WI in their favor. Six Milwaukee Assembly districts also go into the WOW region. Rs held five (two narrowly) and it took a state Mother of the Year to narrowly wrest away the other.
@JMilesColeman Doesn’t seem like Brown is purple anymore, which could have major implications for 2020. Also, one wouldn’t think Fond du Lac had many more Rs to gain but it appears to have gone from 60% Trump to nearly 2/3 for Walker. Outagamie seems to be solidifying also.

@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa A House&amp;Senate recount in Washington State's 42nd District confirmed the microscopic victories of two GOP legislators. A Dem won the other House seat without a recount, making inroads in historically conservative Whatcom County	https://t.co/vFul6FUfg3

@B_M_Finnigan MSNBC had declared Londrigan the winner at around 11:30. GA-7 was due to an incorrect transmission, presumably from Forsyth County.
Fun fact. Both GOP Congressmen who had erroneously been projected to have been defeated on election night – Rodney Davis and Rob Woodall, were former Congressional Chiefs of Staff (to Shimkus and Davis).The projection of defeat for a 3rd Chief of Staff, David Young,was correct
Little noticed: Rodney Davis held off Betsy Dirksen Londrigan by 2,058 votes. The 50.4-49.6% margin brought the race to under 1%. It was the second closest photo finish for Davis, who first won the seat by 1,002 votes over David Gill in ’12.
@jacobfhsmith Used to think somebody like Nunn or another centrist would be the strongest but, now I'm not so sure. She'd get a very negligible amount in rural Georgia while an "exciting"candidate would bring out the needed votes. Course, one imagines it wouldn't be a struggle in a Prez year.

@PoliticsFollow6 @ActorAaronBooth Not only that but McSally wasn't nearly the turnoff that Trump is to many voters, rhetorically speaking.

In both races, the losing candidate has requested the recount and posted a non-refundable bond to pay for the recount. https://t.co/t9GaTDQMpE
Interesting, if not awkward thought. Typically, the Dean of the House administers the oath to the Speaker who right now is Don Young, a Republican. Doubt Pelosi bypasses him for a Dem but if she did, that would be Steny Hoyer, 5th in House seniority &amp; the most senior Dem.
@ActorAaronBooth One thing to keep in mind about Georgia. Demographically, things are changing so rapidly that, if 2020 had been a midterm and the governor's race had been held that year. Kemp probably would have taken just 49%.
@ActorAaronBooth That's what I've long been saying - that it's going to come down to those two states. At this point, I'd suspect WI narrowly goes Dem, certainly not as decisively as PA and MI.

@SenhorRaposa Suspect Steve Pierce could probably be talked into running again in 2020. But unlike 2010 when he last made his comeback, the political winds will not be at his back and Torres- Small will be no pushover.
Very sorry to hear about of Ed Pastor's passing. The AZ Dem was low-key but warm, collegial and one who exuded decency Appropriations fit him like a glove.Just stepped down in 2014 and at 75, his days in both retirement and life were far too short.

@JoshCrawfordNE And, he's got to win next year.
@johndeeth @melseyiniowa @desmoinesdem Funny thing is, a nine-vote difference and 32 ballots, should they be counted, is still no guarantee, particularly if not everyone voted for St. Rep. Could be decided by one-vote either way, or even a tie. But that's what a complete count is for.
@johndeeth @melseyiniowa @desmoinesdem Okay, tainted. You're right - "rigged" is too strong a word. I know Koether and her team are reviewing their options so, I would imagine a decision will come this week.
@CWR4 @burgessev Well, here's the thing. Sinema did prove to be a good candidate but she also had major weaknesses (mostly in the area of past statements). In TX, did Cruz's surname give him a boost, however nominal, with some Latinos?

@CWR4 @burgessev He's not going to switch parties &amp; the GOP wouldn't renominate him in any case. One has to give him credit for voting as he sees fit, regardless of his state. But he probably couldn't hold even if he was another Joe Manchin (see Bredesen, Ojeda, etc).
@CWR4 @burgessev I agree - and TX was in part due to Cruz though,there will be even more demographic changes to balance it out by '20. FL is increasingly problematic for Ds. No way Trump takes MI and I highly doubt PA.WI is less certain in which case Ds will need a backup plan. Is AZ that backup?
@johndeeth @melseyiniowa @desmoinesdem And whether it's "human error" or "incompetence" at this point is irrelevant given that they've already been counted. In this instance, the only remedy for due process is counting the ballots in both counties otherwise it will be rigged.
@CWR4 @burgessev As far as the South goes, I'd stick with NC, GA and FL (and the Sunshine State is enough of a challenge) with VA being a lock. Expanding on Beto's outreach in TX should obviously continue but not at the expense of PA, MI &amp;WI
@JoshCrawfordNE Absolutely. The fact that an African-American could get 46% in MS, 49% in GA and come within .05% of FL is evidence that anything is possible. But as Ds learned from 2016, getting to 270 needs to be the first priority&amp;with OH possibly out of the mix, there's limited error room

Disagree with @repschrader that Pelosi shouldn’t be given 1 term,“because in one Congress we’ll lose our majority...we’ll lose at least half of the members who flipped seats this time.”In ’08, Ds retained control&amp;picked up many GOP districts. ’20 will be decided from top-down.

Another thing to keep in mind for what it's worth. Espy won his last two re-elections with 85% and 76%. At the time, it was 1/5 of the state (MS now has 4 Cong. districts). My point. He may have been running against nobodys but he ran ahead of the Dem performance.
@kkondik Well, Espy apparently fell 2% shy of his benchmark in Warren County but Hyde Smith is underperforming in several of hers.

Only in the deep South. Mississippi has a county named Jefferson Davis and Espy's benchmark is nearly 70%, which means it's probably an African-American county. Go figure.

Okay. To quote Claire McCaskill on ellection night, "I have no flipping idea who is going to win (she lost)." But I think it's near-certain that my own 55-45% call for Hyde-Smith is now out the window.
A comment on @RRHElections "DeSoto County holy cow. CHS by only one point with 6/39 precincts reporting." She may be underperforming but, both sides need to see where that's coming from. On other hand, remember, Travis Childers won an unlikely special election in that area in '08

@JustCameron__ IL-13 is the one that actually seems to be trending in that direction. A lot will depend on the student population  that almost elected a Democratic Congresswoman which likely will be voting in even higher numbers. Runner-up:WA-3. But neither will change how their states vote.

1 rematch that I could see in a district where a Democrat prevailed is New Mexico to where Harrell might try to avenge a loss where, initially she thought she had prevailed. But Torres-Small was a dynamic candidate and, as an incumbent in a Prez year will be a very tough target
On the other hand, I would rate Dan McCready's chances in NC-9 as strong along with GA-7 ( that will guarantee is non-existent). Rematches may also be assured in three or fourr TX districts which could be close (TX10, 22, 23 and 31)though and some the incumbent may step down.
A number of rematches from close House races might take place in 2020 and some outcomes may be different but, one where Dem odds may dwindle is MN-1. Much depends on Trump but, this was a banner year  for the party in MN  and the district does not appear to be trending their way.

@CTIronman @kkrz1211 @decunningham2 @JMilesColeman Not sure Sessions wants to return,especially to minority but yee,besides Marchant, Rs don't have to shore up as much in DFW as Travis area (perhaps TX-6 but it's still a reach).

@mlow29 I almost think that for '20, TX will be just as competitive at the Pres.level as FL(maybe a shade beliq). FL is filling up with retirees while TX is attracting younger people.And in the Lone Star State, suburbia increases it's dominance over rural Texas every day.
Doesn't seem that Donnelly or McCaskill would have won even without a contentious Supreme Court battle. But it's almost safe to say, that even without the Broward ballot fiasco, Bill Nelson was Kavanaughed.

@kkrz1211 @CTIronman @decunningham2 @JMilesColeman Then there's DFW.I speculated that they'd probably concede TX-32 for one cycle since their bench has been wiped out anyway but Marchant was another 3 percent, down from 15 2 years ago.

@Redistrict @kkondik Little noticed change. After the provisionals were counted in NC, Mark Harris’s 1,300 edge in NC-9 dwindled to just 905.Expect a marquee race - and perhaps rematch, in 2020.
@mlow29 FL is becoming a problem but, it's not unsalvageable like some think OH might be (I'm not even sure that would be in a strong Dem year).But, two races were decided by half a point&amp;Comey’s letter prob. cost Clinton in ’20. Still, party’s first traditional red flip-aim should be AZ
@kkondik CDs in the first category would be GA-7 and several in TX that were close losses not because of Pelosi, but because they are actually getting more competitive (2020)? Others, such as KS-2 may have stayed GOP due to Pelosi but, wouldn’t play much role in House Ds longterm strategy
@kkondik She’s slightly right. I expected 45-50 rather than 39 but, the narrow losses fall into two categories. 1, some suburban districts were closer than expected so may fall in ‘20 anyway. 2,some are rural, decent GOP districts that aren’t really Dem constituencies even without Pelosi
@JoshCrawfordNE Frost, in bowing out, insisted that Pelosi hadn't locked up the race until hours before but he likely knew better. Also, he wasn't unanimously supported by his fellow Texans as Sandlin, Doggett, and Eddie Johnson backed Pelosi.Conversely,her only defector in CA was Ellen Tauscher
@JoshCrawfordNE I remember Frost ran against Pelosi for about a week after the '02 election. He recalled that in 1976, a man from Fort Worth (Jim Wright) took on someone from San Francisco (Phil Burton)  and noted the Fort Worth man won. But prob. knew there were many more conservative Ds then

@desmoinesdem I don't want to call that history antiquated but, Grassley and Harkin built up popularity for so long (and even Harkin had a few close calls) that the theory really hasn't been put to a test for a while.
@desmoinesdem Really think J.D. Scholten would be an excellent candidate to take on Ernst but that's just my own personal bias.
@desmoinesdem On one hand, Reynolds's ability to hold on could trim the sails on Ds hopes to beat Ernst's. On the other hand, while Reynolds may be a clone for Trump politically, she is far different personalitywise and as a result, Trump's numbers have nosedived in IA. 2020 will be about him.
@ClistonBrown @MrFilmkritik That would have required ompetence. But on a serious note, the Senate map generally didn't allow it, though it could have potentially helped with women in AZ&amp;NV. But 2020 will be entirely different.
@ClistonBrown Normally I'd rank Torres-Small as among the most vulnerable freshman in '20 but she proved such a strong candidate that, unless Pearce runs again (he won't), she should be fine in Pr ez level turnout.
@ClistonBrown NM-2 I didn't even consider until the last few weeks as I suspect most didn't. UT-4 was one of my many tossups. Thought Scott Taylor would hold but that was before signaturegate.
Around June,I had about 15 House seats I was sure would flip,including KS-2&amp;NC-9 But Rs held them.On other hand, even taking away the 3-4 true upsets, I didn't see Walters losing and was very iffy on Roskam, Denham and Young. Hultgren was only a feint possibility.NM-2 was off map
The last week illustrates the unpredictable nature of absentees. Last Friday, Love was down 7,000 votes and now she is close to even. On election night, E	Walters led by 6,000 and now she's gone.
@PoliticsWolf Someone had said right around Election Day  - might have been Chuck Todd, never to assume that Mississippi is already enshrined. Now the black turnout will be sky-high. Will it be enough.
@AriBerman Well, due to the Constitutional amendments voters passed, it cannot continue super egregiously after 2020. Leg.districts will have to be more compact which still leaves room for sinister ploys. Cong. map has more room for mischief but my take is they can't shore up Chabot anymore
RT @jacobfhsmith: I'm old enough to remember when people were worried about Ds being shut out of the general election in CA seats.
If my math is right, Ds are two calls away from matching the 233 seats they came in with the last time they won the majority in '06. CA-45 officially went their way today and CA-39&amp;NY-22 are all but assured of doing so after a few remaining votes come in. Close UT-4 would be 234
@richardmskinner In some regards, Orange is still the color purple. Doesn't mean Democrats are dominant by any means, especially at the local level but it will be anathema to Rs at the federal level as long as Trump is in office.

@richardmskinner It's funny, many, myself included, laughed after a recent election when Pelosi said it's more important that she stay on after a loss (the presidency) rather than a win because they need her. And from a tactician sense, that's so true. This woman has never lost a floor vote.
@richardmskinner At one point, Linda Sanchez raised eyebrows  by becoming part of the anti Pelosi group. But, the perception then was that she couldn't lead Ds to victory. That's changed. You know what they say about victory having a thousand fathers (or mothers in this case)
@cwbusbyhouston @kkondik And I think it's almost safe to say that, things are not going to be getting any better in the suburbs for the GOP in the next two years.
@cwbusbyhouston @kkondik At least some of those TX seats prob.go the way of Southern California in 1998. It was thought that impeachment would help Ds in three districts where the odds were against them but Rogan,Kuykendall at Bilbray all narrowly won. Two years later, all three lost.

For candidates in GA-7, ME-2, NY-22, and UT-4, tomorrow is likely to bring clarity if not finality. Outside of the House, these results are really of secondary importance as Trump carried all four districts.
Walters now trails, Valadao adds to lead somewhat but Denham has now fallen 5,000 votes behind. Expect the AP to call CA-10 for Harder at next update.Meanwhile, Katie Hill, who was expected to barely squeak in if she even won (her race was called last week), may hit close to 54%

@karinjr @joxyandsuch @Nate_Cohn I think - I emphasize think, that there are roughly 2,500 outstanding ballots in the Gwinnett section of the 7th. That includes the roughly 1,000 provisionals and the 1,400 absentees.
@ajconwashington Many exasperated Rs felt that’s what he should have been doing for most of the cycle when he basically didn’t realize he was in trouble and went to sleep.
@byelin I'm sorry - McAdams is still in the lead but Utah County reduced it from 5,000 to just over 1,000. Salt Lake County should - but is not guaranteed, to grow it again.
Love's lead down to 1,020 votes following Utah County dump. However, a big caveat. In 2012, Jim Matheson led Love on election night by almost 3,000 votes and was assumed to have been safely re-elected. Two years later, Utah County came in and Matheson had held by fewer than 700

@PoliticsFollow6 I think Sinema, who did not run a particularly strong campaign, probably was helped by the Kavanaugh imbroglio, particularly among suburban women. No evidence to back that up but, in a state that hasn't chosen the Democratic Senator since 1988, something had to give
@brianros1 Stabenow, unlike Baldwin, didn't run the race of her life and in fairness, she probably didn't think she needed to given the year James just turned out to be a pretty strong opponent. By the way, I thought Casey would win more than 57%.
@PoliticsFollow6 That's my thinking as well. I'd still say Trump falls short in Wisconsin but, like Walker, it's not going to be a sure thing until election night.
Could WI decide the presidency? It's not a cheesy thought. It's highly highly unlikely that Trump will carry PA and MI again - and I felt this long before last week so, if all else stays the same, the Badger State might be pivotal.On other hand, so will AZ.And NC.And of course,Fl

There's talk that, if as expected, Golden prevails when ranked-choice is tabulated in ME-2 the GOP might file suit. I don't think that will happen because, it's not the decisive House seat and it is the will of the people via voter initiative. Plus, the concept is not going away.
@richardmskinner Collier County is heavily Republican. Will be interesting to see what happens with Florida-25 come redistricting.
Lost in all of the election hoopla. The Appropriations Committee, historically an old man's baron club, is about to be chaired by @nitalowey. Another major glass ceiling shattered.
Just realized, Steny Hoyer is now the most senior Democrat in the House, though not the entire Congress. Markey, Schumer and Wyden were in the House earlier and of course Leahy has been a Senator since '74. Marcy Kaptur will be number two when Sandy Levin leaves at year's end.

If this week is a guide, the post-2020 electoral college shift might signal Dem trends for the first time in decades. Blue/mixed states NY,IL,PA&amp;MI will still lose seats but, CO&amp;OR will gain and with AZ, TX and FL soon being possible wins, the losses are basically cancelled out.
@PoliticsFollow6 Not absolutely impossible for a strong Democrat to win Texas in 2020 at the presidential level. O'Rourke took 48% so, what would probably only need 49% to win the national contest. It all depends on whether there's further deterioration to the GOP brand in suburbia.
@JakeSherman Rohrabacher is the most senior lawmaker to be turned out this year and, aside from Pete Sessions, the only one of the roughly 30 defeated to have been elected before 2000. Upton, who first was elected in 1986, narrowly avoided that same fate.
The rapidly changing dynamics is only one reason I'd bet on TX Ds snagging a Senate seat come 2024. The other is that TX  Rs aren't smart enough to nominate someone with broad based appeal (Hurd), though I suppose P. Bush could conceivably clear 50% in a runoff.
Texas wasn't quite ready for a Democratic senator this year just as Arizona wasn't in 2012 - another three point race.But I'd venture that by 2024, the odds will be in their favor unless a possible Democratic president seeking reelection is very unpopular.
@wiscott44 @Redistrict @PoliticalKiwi The one race Dems should really be worried about is Tenney's. Her deficit is only 1,300 votes and 14,000 absentees remain.

Dino Rossi has conceded as did Steve Knight earlier in the day. Meanwhile, Rohrabacher has fallen farther behind, CA39 about steady. I would also expect - but not guarantee, that Denham loses his 1,100 vote lead as more ballots are counted. He has in every election since 2012.
Just saw Schumer's press conference. While acknowledging Dem wins at the national level as he should, I wouldn't have shrugged off the Senate losses as occurring in deep red states that aren't paramount to win the presidency. Why? Because they also lost FL.
If Mimi Walters becomes NRCC head - and she's been making phone calls so furiously that she may well be - she's guaranteed to lose her next
In 2014, there were probably at least 10 genuine Democratic centrists in the U.S. Senate. But two elections - that year and this, eviscerated their ranks to the point that now only two remain: Manchin and Tester (Doug Jones may fall into that as well).
Paul Davis was expecting to be KS Gov in 2014 and surprisingly lost. Last night, he expected to go to Congress and was again upset.. In defeat, he said, “Tonight marks the conclusion of my last run for public office,”

@stevesingiser @mlow29 @geoffreyvs Wasn't there an AG in AL or an AG candidate named Twinkle Kavanaugh?
@nathanlgonzales Stabenow unexpectedly struggled but I can't see Peters sweating too much. It'll be a presidential year and while turnout was high last night, it'll be even stronger in '20 and that counts for a lot. Plus, Peters is no longer anonymous - he's really been raising his profile.
@nathanlgonzales You know what, i keep forgetting that Jones is up. But it's true, any thinking that he could  survive has been evaporated by last night. He's probably got a better chance of either winding up as the number two on a Prez ticket or of becoming AG.
If the margin holds, Janet Mills' win in ME will mark only the second time since 1982 that a winner for the Blaine House reached 50%. Only Angus King reached that threshold when he won a 2nd term in 1998. Some wins didn't even hit 40%.

@RelentlessYapp New York State is absolutely turning into it killing ground for Republican and it might not be over yet. Donovsn was upset, Faso and Tenney have lost, Chris Collins appears right behind and suddenly, Pete King, comfortably before it's now up just 50.1 to 49.9
@RelentlessYapp Evers will probably win in Wisconsin, particularly because Milwaukee is only 17% in. It's reminiscent of 2016 when Hillary Clinton was down 68,000 and only lost by 23,000 (though I think that was Dane County that put her over).
Three close apparent wins for Republican incumbents in Pennsylvania. Scott Perry and Mike Kelly have both hung on with  51% while Brian Fitzpatrick is leading with that same number with 76% in.
This is when races that are tied take a while to unpack. IL-13 had been called for Londrigan but Davis is ahead with 95% in, though barely. A seesaw in NJ-3  with 99% in. But Mike Bishop, up by a big margin, now leads by just 2,000 votes with 85% in.
Extremely close races in Trump districts they thought they could win. North Carolina-9 which is tight with 98% in but more surprisingly, Kansas-2 where Watkins has edged ahead with 92% in.

Classic! Someone on MSNBC just asked @SteveKornacki if Steve King, assuming he holds, will caucus with Seth Grossman. The NJ R who was disowned by his own party for racial insensitivity came surprisingly close to beating Jeff Andrew, who has declared victory.
Anyone know where the outstanding areas are in the Wisconsin Governor's race? That one's tight as a tick.
It may be hard to believe, but, until tonight, Mitt Romney at 71 had only won a single election: Governor of Massachusetts in 2002.
Collins McMurray races too close to call, Will Hurd appears to have pulled back ahead a Kathleen Williams is leading in Montana. That always tightens as the race goes on but that would be a big gain, and not due to the size of the state.
A Dem House is assured but Nancy Pelosi, addressing her supporters in Washington, seem to be as reticent as can be. She left it appears that way but, perhaps it's a realization that, she might not be the next Speaker.
And a twin killing!!!John Faso and Claudia Tenney have both been unseated. Both big Trump districts (interestingly, both Gillibrand and Mike Arcuri were declared the winners at the same time in 2006).
Well, scratch that. Londrigan has now been declared the winner on IL-13. An Obama, Romney (barely, Trump district. The only surprise in favor of the Rs so far is that Mike Bishop appears to be hanging on.
Chris Pappas appears to be holding on in NH-1 but Eddie Edwards came on unexpectedly strong. Meanwhile, three NJ races are separated by 1%.
Noteworthy news in House races. IL-13 now has tightened considerably to 52-48% Londrigan lead while MN-1 has tightened to a 50-50% tie. Collin Peterson is now in the lead and ME-2 is neck'n'neck.

Wow some of those house races are close. No surprise but Taylor and Brat are both down by about 2,000 votes with 94% and 84% in respectively..
Hillary was behind 100 000 votes with 91% counted in Florida and Broward out. She only gained 25,000. That being said, a lot of Miami-Dade is still out and so is some of Orange. Nelson maybe okay. Gillum probably biting fingernails
RT @SenhorRaposa: The urban-rural divide is growing and that is very bad for this country.
I'm sure Donna Shalala appreciates being called The Comeback Kid but at age 77, she's headed to Congress.
3 Republicans are leading in House Democratic districts but, I think it's safe to say that Jim Cooper and Sanford Bishop will not lose. Bishop in fact was actually declared the loser in 2010
@SenhorRaposa Broward and most of Palm Beach haven't come in. Miami-Dade is only 25% in and yet and it's literally 50.0 to 50.0% (5,000 vote difference in favor of Scott). Looks good for Nelson. Gillum should squeak it out around 100,000 votes or slightly more.
@Redistrict That came out of nowhere. She had a 10-point lead earlier
Florida has suddenly tightens to 24,000 votes for Gillum and 44,000 for Nelson respectively. That's what the Panhandle coming in but, my guess is more of South Florida is outstanding. I'd still rather be them
Kelly had 54 percent in New Hampshire but that's probably with Manchester reporting. The small hamlets will probably bring it down and it might come down to Nashua and Portsmouth like the Ayotte race
Kemp has 2/3 of the vote in Georgia but traditionally, rural and under populated South Georgia always, always reports first.
Lots of House action. Bae is ahead of Mast by 10%, Spanberger leads Brat by about 2,000 votes and Taylor leads by the same margin. Meanwhile, Barr has passed McGrath and Curbelo down 51-49%.
If I remember, about the 60% mark was when Trump begin overtaking Clinton. So ifthe GOP is going to pull ahead in Florida, they're going to have to do it soon
@babayaga331 Depends on the margin. If Braun wins by more than five, I think the likelihood was that Donnelly was going to lose anyway
Meanwhile, Wexton has officially beaten Comstock. First to fall
Nelson up 138,000. I think only the Panhandle can save him but that's now iffy. Gillum up by 124,000.

Gillum and Nelson both ahead by 200, 000 votes. Now this is with Southern Florida starting to reporte and no Panhandle but, the GOP is running out of breathing room for the Election Day vote
Shalala way up. Taylor and Riggleman ahead. Harris leads in NC-9 ans astomishingly, so does Coleman in NC2 but no clue how much is in
Spanberger and Brat are separated by 564 votes with 20% in. Meanwhile will now only leads Hall by 54-46%
McGrath up 54-45% with a third in. Shapiro leads Buchanan 51-49%. Soderbergh trails big. Carlson and Spano close but the election day vote probably saves Spano
Think we can stick a fork in Comstock. With 48% in (boy, do they count the votes there). Wexton leads 56-44%.
Chuck Todd notes that the Bill Nelson people swore that Gwen Graham was going to be a better of gubernatorial candidate. Ironic that Gillum may carry Nelson
If Rs have a 150, 000 vote  E Day lead, Gillum, about 100,000 votes ahead, should still be okay. Don't ask me to explain that

Wow, Nelson is leading right now by a bigger margin than Gollum. Makes me think both might be holding their own in parts of the state where the other might be stronger.
Miami-Dade is obviously starting to come in because Shalala leads 52-42% with 150,000 tabulated. Curbelo trails in very early returns.
Scott's going to need a big number for the Election Day bote. Conversely, if Donnelly is going to be pulling ahead he needs to start narrowing the Gap soon because Braun's been at 60% for an hour
Wow. Kentucky is off its mark a little bit. Usually comes in like Speedy Gonzales but tonight is faltering.
Remember, at around 8:15 Eastern Time in 2016, Hilary seems Invincible with a 300,000 volt lead. Then the election day vote came energy lost by one. Gillum seems better positioned and Nelson leads too but the latter one maybe close, close,close.
With the early votes coming in so so quickly, I get the feeling some officials couldn't wait to release their totals. We have four hundred thousand votes and the polls haven't even close 10 minutes
Gillum leads 52-48 in Pinellas early vote and Trump actually won the county by 1. But again, it's meaningless until we get the election day vote
Very early but in the few areas that CNN is showing in Florida, Gilkum is running about 8 ahead of Crist from 2014 and Scott won by one. Nelson and Scott flip-flopping but it is meaningless at this point

When you think of it, it shouldn't take that much for Abrams to get to 50 + 1%.After all, Trump barely got 50% 2 years ago and it's safe to say Kemp doesn't motivate people the way Trump did. On the other hand, this time Dems are beyond motivated.

@RelentlessYapp Generally, there has to be a less than 500 vote difference for it to drag on and on. Some states, such as Minnesota and Virginia don't even have provisions to authorize recounts until mid December. CA may take 2-3 weeks for all of those to be tabulated .
Polls have increasingly been showing Tester's leadcerosing but, so much of the vote has been cast already by Rs that, so long as Ds actually show up tomorrow, which I don't think will be much of a problem, I don't see enough Indys as going to Rosendale.
Republicans keep talking about how even their best candidates can't gain traction when they are being so significantly outspent. Funny, I don't seem to remember complaints when the Koch brothers were doing their thing
So when does everyone think the last race will be resolved this year (I'm taking Congressional and Gubernatorial)?Remember, in 2008, Tom Perriello’s win wasn’t confirmed until almost Christmas. Franken/Coleman went to July but that was extraordinary.

@posglen @Redistrict The only thing I'd add is that even if there was limited Republican "enthusiasm," most voters were still likely to turnout. In other words, these races really are dependent on Indies

@PoliticsFollow6 @nathanlgonzales Donnelly yes. Mccaskill I called against but, she could pull a squeaker. I'm not from MO but you still have to Show-Me.
@Susca719 Curbelo will likely lose. I have to look into the Mast/Baer ace a little more
@Susca719 Shalala. If anything, FL-6 and 15 are tossups as well although Rs will probably hold 6.
@Taniel Besides Iowa-4 which I think is on everybody's list (including many Republicans other than Ted Cruz), New York-19 is mine. My second choice: Kansas-2.
@Susca719 I'll post them Saturday but I would imagine Brat loses. About the only good news for Republicans is incumbents in  OH-1 and KY-6 (Chabot and Barr) seem to have weathered the storm, though Barr's race may still be close.
Oh, and Florida-25 has suddenly come on the board as well. Diaz-Balart still a narrow favorite but just by a tilt.
I'm almost done with my House calls which I'll post by Saturday. Kind of ominous for the Republicans that the five or six races that I can't call are mostly those that weren't supposed to be close.They are: CA-48,GA-7, IA-4, MI-6,NM-2, VA-2 and VA-5. Everything else I've called

@ActorAaronBooth Sure it does. Booker has charisma that rouses voters. Don't forget, Obama did better in North Dakota in '08(45%) than any Den since LBJ.
I understand the strategy of Trumps fear-based ads, as deplorable as they are but, doesn't he realize it's going to backfire? For every GOP voter he gets to turn out (most of whom would have done so anyway), his candidates lose two others. Is that the art of the deal?
@kkondik Wouldn't be surprised to see an upset in a western Michigan House race (MI-2 or 3). Amash may be facing a nobody but turnout in Kent (Grand Rapids)is through the roof and it's trending blue. Adding Battle Creek hurt Rs as well.And of course,I've had eye on OH-14 all year
After this week,expect some surprise losses on the GOP side. I think Lee Zeldin's race is going to be decided by 1% and he may well lose. And Pete King, a very well liked member, better thank the Lord that he's Pete King because that'll be the only thing that saves him.
I heard an elaborate radio ad today for Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, California (mostly on his support for the wall). I live in effing New Jersey.
@ActorAaronBooth @KSTP @surveyusa @Tim_Walz @MNJeffJohnson And some said this one was tightening. Even if true, so much of the vote has already been cast that the outcome is preordained.

@RalstonReports A perfect prototype of the president he heartily supported.
@DavidZavac One problem, as is a wonderful problem to have him we're talking about a wave, is that so many of these races are just now coming on the table (FL15, perhaps wven MI-2, etc.), that, I'm not quite ready to call some yet.
@DavidZavac I'll get back to you. I have to total them up but, there will be a Dem majority.
@RelentlessYapp They are still going to have to get the turnout to back it up. If so, Valadao might even be vulnerable in 2020 when a Presidential year will be higher.
The race surprisingly hasn't garnered as much attention as others but in UT-4,McAdams has leaped ahead of Love in Siena. Casten also now up slightly in IL-6. After bouncing all over the place,TX-7 nearly tied.But in the biggest surprise of all,Harder is well outdistancing Denham

Siena has 24% undecided so far in NY-27. In a reliably Republican district with an indicted GOP incumbent, that's an understandable conundrum.

@ElectProject @KampSteve Are some of these people seeking recourse. Will they at least be able to vote provisionally? I suspect there's going to be massive litigation over how/if they'll be counted if Kemp gets say, 50.2%.
RT @JMilesColeman: Ed Gillespie got more votes than any Republican candidate for VA Governor ever. Still a 9% loss. https://t.co/T7LruembCI
@ForecasterEnten @elium2 Mississippi won't go Den if It's the 51st seat. Doug Jones wouldn't have taken Alabama if he had been seat number https://t.co/pe7q9dqPtW uphill slog as it is.
@Dawnsfire One member they mention throwing money at is David Young. They can do it and might get him close but in the end I doubt they save him. Especially if, as I expect, Kim Reynolds goes down.

@PoliticsWolf @richardmskinner That was among the furthest reach districts for Ds, even further than the West Virginia-3 where Ds are also behind but within mid-single districts- and Trump beat Hillary by 50. KS-2 also remains a big possibility.
@Redistrict Could be that neither side is comfortable enough to release them though, there was almost nothing in Bullocks '16 race.
RT @richardmskinner: FL political insider sees Gillum up by narrower margin than CNN poll. https://t.co/vW3oG2udQi
@richardmskinner But the advantageous thing for Democrats is that the playing field has been expanded to more historically Republican districts. Ds seem to have a real chance in seats like VA-7, KS-2 and KY-6.
@richardmskinner Right. This is not just suburban vs. rural, it's what you're taljing about which mostly, though not always, translates into Obama/Trump districts. MI-8 and NY-19 are prime examples.

@EricBoehlert It's completely paradoxical and a total 180 to the days of Woodward and Bernstein.
@mlow29 But probably higher in Orange County.
@mlow29 39 seems to be within reach for Cisneros but getting over the finish line is going to be tough, and the tax issue doesn't help. Conversely, some Rs refuse to call lights out on Rohrabacher  but I have a hard time seeing him holding on, even if It's close.

@JackCox @Taniel @RalstonReports Oh, I've been aware of that for years. He's already been invaluable as he always has been but that'll come out in force starting Saturday when early voting begins.
@amyewalter Rarely has more than minimal impact regardless of which side tries it. Didn't work for Rs against Tip O'Neill and only resulted in Ds gaining nine seats in '96 following the govt. shutdown when Gingrich was at the height of his unpopularity
@ActorAaronBooth The people watching that he hopes to drill that into Don't pay attention to the fact checking that comes later.
@Taniel Surprised they stayed in as long as they did. Rs never had serious shots in either but wanted to compete in 4 in particular because Hardy was a former incumbent. Plus, early voting is set to begin Saturday so some votes from both parties will be banked quickly
