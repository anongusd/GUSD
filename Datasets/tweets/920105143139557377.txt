@CountryPhy @Mrs_Malindo @RevTrinaCCA @mqueen983 @DoloresJust3 @SpeakerRyan DACA can‚Äôt work to provide for their US citizen children so DACA is waiting on Trump and Reps. to do what they said they were gonna do?
@CountryPhy @Mrs_Malindo @RevTrinaCCA @mqueen983 @DoloresJust3 @SpeakerRyan The problem is Trump said he will fix DACA by having congress do it.
