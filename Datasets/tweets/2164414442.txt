@ChelseaClinton Yes, but they are mostly brown Americans. Racists and xenophobes across our nation are in large part the fundamental reason why the USA has not and will not become a greater nation than it is. @realDonaldTrump has revealed the depth of this immoral truth. Now, let's address it.
@DineshDSouza Morons, imbeciles, idiots, simpletons, xenophobes, racists, in other words basically every Republican, your failure to realise that non-citizens live legally and contribute greatly to the nation is either ignorant or immoral. Which is it in your case? @thehill @GOP @TheDemocrats
@thehill Remember when taking the census you should be as honest as @realDonaldTrump when he is asked questions he doesn‚Äôt want to answer.
@longlivekcx Sorry Joe. We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness... 2nd A didn't make the list of God given rights@JoeWalsh
@Grace4NY What considered individual doesn‚Äôt believe that ICE will utilise the data collected to target immigrants? What a tremendous amount of indifference to humanity and the social contract would exist within an individual to allow the government to proceed with this action unchecked?

@SenatorWicker No it doesn't. Certainly it would appear that way on the surface, however, the Seattle consulate was going to close anyway. What we have here is the political spinning of a routine event. @thehill

Download the entire Human Rights Watch World Report 2018 at https://t.co/PE25hECBua.  @thehill
‚ÄúMany vulnerable groups endured renewed attacks on their rights during the year. Other longstanding US laws and practices‚Äîparticularly related to criminal and juvenile justice, immigration, and national security‚Äîcontinued to violate internationally recognized human rights.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe individuals most likely to suffer abuse in the United States‚Äîincluding members of racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, children, the poor, and prisoners‚Äîare often least able to defend their rights in court or via the political process.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrump has also expressed disdain for independent media and for federal courts that have blocked some of his actions. And he has repeatedly coddled autocratic leaders and showed little interest or leadership in pressing for the respect of human rights abroad.‚Äù
‚ÄúHis administration has embraced policies that will roll back access to reproductive health care for women; championed health insurance changes that would leave many more Americans without access to affordable health care; and undermined police accountability for abuse. ‚Äú
‚ÄúTrump has targeted refugees and immigrants, calling them criminals and security threats; emboldened racist politics by equivocating on white nationalism; and consistently championed anti-Muslim ideas and policies.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe strong civil society and democratic institutions of the United States were tested in the first year of the administration of President Donald Trump. Across a range of issues in 2017, the US moved backward on human rights at home and abroad.‚Äù Human Rights Watch Report 2018
