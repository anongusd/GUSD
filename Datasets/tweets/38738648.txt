@Adam_Hansen23 Thanks btw lol you won the Super Douche tweet of the month! Congrats😊
@Adam_Hansen23 I don't really like the steelers and the cardinals lost a super bowl against them a while back so that's why I said that...
@ktbouvette hopefully you have good spyware💀
New favorite person 😂👌🏼 https://t.co/D797wBt55Z
@ktbouvette half a screen just won't do! Dang. I'm not sure what else then. So many good websites have been shut down!
@ktbouvette try putlocker. I think if you type in "watch mocking jay part 2 online free" the putlocker website should be one of the links.
I feel like people dress like this now too😂 https://t.co/3GWS3ATbGl

But I have a feeling Carolina will go to the super bowl and win it. I like the team though so that would be cool too. But ... #GoPackGo lol
The Panthers definitely deserve to win after their near undefeated season but I would like to see the Cardinals win today! #playoffs
Literally every Saturday I've been back in GB I forget that the kress closes at 2, during breaks, until I get there 10 minutes to 2. 💀

Haven't had a lazy day since 'nam. So here, in my bed, I'll stay. Until work.
Having a significant other is a fucking chore for your emotions. Like I don't have a headache I have a heartache. Ew. I'm annoyed.
Time for sleep 😴😴😴
I think I literally only stay up this late when I'm with @TaylorLardinois 🙈
