Since 2012, more than 2,000 students have graduated from the Usharek+ program, which has been made possible with support from @USAID.
Campaigns focused on a variety of topics, including assistance to #marginalizedcommunities, improving the lives of #women and #girls, increasing opportunities for #youth representation in government, and #environmental rehabilitation. Which topic is most important to you?
Students then work together to build campaigns and reach out to various decision-makers and members of parliament to build support for issues they care about.
Through the Usharek+ program, students receive training in advocacy, campaign planning, communication skills, message development, social media skills, and event coordination.
Usharek+ graduates gathered at Ras Al Ein Hangar in downtown Amman and exhibited their campaigns to more than 150 guests, including government representatives, local and international civil society leaders, university officials and fellow students.

The delegation's full statement contains a number of additional recommendations. Read it here: https://t.co/cpaFxTw59P
Although not seen as a critical issue at this time, both opposition and ruling parties agree that #Georgia is subject to disinformation and attacks on its #democracy. Georgian civil society organizations and government authorities should continue efforts to counter these threats.
Prosecutors and judges should ensure impartial, timely resolution of the cases of violence during the 2016 and 2017 elections to help deter such violations in the future and send a positive message to the public.
Government leadership should clearly communicate to all civil servants and the public that abuse of administrative resources will not be tolerated and that violators will face prosecution.
The president should set an election date as soon as possible to ensure relevant regulations around campaigning can be applied and parties and candidates can commence their official campaigns.
In its statement, this delegation offered a number of recommendations that can be addressed ahead of the upcoming election.

@madeleine: ‚ÄúIf you attack one of us, you attack all of us; but if you stand with us, we can ‚Äî and we will ‚Äî make the world freer, more peaceful, and more just than it has ever been.‚Äù #NotTheCost
@madeleine: ‚ÄúAs women, we are not asking for our rights. We were born with our rights. We do not need anyone‚Äôs permission to practice them.‚Äù #NotTheCost https://t.co/GWRQwHOlnl
.@madeleine: 	"Help to make our voices heard.	In the voting booth.	In legislative bodies at all levels.	In multilateral organizations.	In the courts.	In the media.	In civil society.	In the workplace.	In classrooms.	And in the home."	#NotTheCost
.@madeleine: ‚ÄúLet us be clear: for women, violence is not a rightful or inevitable cost of participation in politics. Participation in politics is the way we will end violence against women.‚Äù #NotTheCost https://t.co/M88nKbkHuu
@madeleine, "That‚Äôs why @NDI launched its #NotTheCost campaign, to ensure that women everywhere have a fair chance to participate in the political life of their countries."
.@madeleine: "Democracy, however, depends on people who have the courage to speak up, join together, and fight back against injustice. It depends on people who refuse to be intimidated or to bury their ideals." #NotTheCost
.@madeleine: "There are many models of tyranny, from outright fascism to what some have labelled illiberal democracy. But dictators of all stripes count on good people failing to act as they should, either because they are confused, or divided, or afraid." #NotTheCost https://t.co/DvfFK8UPhM
.@madeleine: ‚ÄúWomen are among the principal targets when civil society is repressed, journalists are thrown into jail, judicial systems lose their independence, and elections are drained of their meaning‚Äù #NotTheCost
.@madeleine: ‚ÄúIn too many countries today -- including Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey, and Egypt -- authoritarian leaders have grabbed the pendulum of history and swung it into reverse." #NotTheCost
.@madeleine: "We have learned through history that when democratic movements of any type arise they inspire and liberate. But they also generate opposition from those who have power and refuse to share it." #NotTheCost
.@madeleine: "What really bothers the predators, the harassers, and the bigots is that they are afraid to compete with women on equal terms. They are the true victims of fear; they are the real objects of pity, trapped in a web of their own insecurities." #NotTheCost
.@madeleine: ‚ÄúWomen today are leaders, legislators, diplomats, warriors, peacemakers, professionals, aviators, athletes, artists, educators and a million other things, but we are not victims.‚Äù #NotTheCost https://t.co/tTvgmppByt
.@madeleine: "But my message today -- and @NDI‚Äôs message -- and the message of the advocates, dreamers and doers in this room -- is that women have finished with the role of victim." #NotTheCost

.@NazaninBoniadi: "We must recognize that the status of women and girls and the stability of nations go hand-in-hand; countries with the most discriminatory laws and cultural attitudes toward women tend to also experience the greatest unrest and turmoil." #NotTheCost https://t.co/LdMmU7zPyD
@NazaninBoniadi: ‚ÄúAs human rights advocates, we demand that the rights of half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äî women ‚Äî be respected. No one should experience violence or live in fear of it when he or she seeks to access the full range of their human rights.‚Äù #NotTheCost https://t.co/yAucJTO5s0

NDI‚Äôs 13th annual @madeleine K. Albright Luncheon is about to begin! Follow the conversation: #NotTheCost
When women politicians are harassed, bullied, threatened and attacked, those acts of violence send the message that there‚Äôs a high price to pay for entering public life. But democracy cannot take root, grow and thrive without the free and full participation of women #NotTheCost
Violence is #NotTheCost for women who run for office, organize their communities, advocate for their beliefs, or engage their fellow citizens.
Around the world ‚Äì in countries big and small, developed and developing ‚Äì women put their safety on the line when they enter politics and public service. That must end ‚Äì and it must end now. #NotTheCost

Analysis from other parts of the world shows that being active in online political conversations subjects women to significantly higher levels of abuse than men.
At the same time, 88 million (34 percent) of Indonesians are active social media users, and 41 percent of all Facebook users in Indonesia are women.
A UNFPA survey last year showed that 33 percent of Indonesian women aged 15 to 64 years old experienced physical and/or sexual violence.
Online violence against women is a reflection of the discrimination and violence that they face in person.

"The scope of irregularities in #Honduras‚Äô recent flawed elections has cast a cloud over the legitimacy of the process and could generate serious instability if unaddressed."
@JimSwigert "For nearly a decade, #Nicaragua‚Äôs electoral process has been characterized by opaqueness and deliberate restriction of political competition."
The US should also not lose track of unresolved electoral integrity issues. @JimSwigert points to #CentralAmerica
"International pressure for improved election conditions is essential if the people of #Venezuela are to have a say in determining their country‚Äôs future" @JimSwigert at @HouseForeign
Proven actions to safeguard elections: 1) Quick Counts or PVTs 2) international monitoring networks 3) Norms &amp; standards like the Open Electoral Data Initiative 4) Youth engagement programs 5) Building bridges between citizens &amp; officials to prevent violence @JimSwigert
.@JimSwigert advice to @HouseForeign on #LAC 2018 elections: The US &amp; others can help safeguard elections by directing political support and resources towards domestic election monitoring and international election observation (which can reinforce efforts of national actors)
@JimSwigert Other challenges: Infusions of illegal political financing, including from narco-traffickers and the growing use of disinformation, along with hacking, for political ends. @JimSwigert at @HouseForeign
According to @JimSwigert 2018: challenges in #LAC include: Efforts by some political leaders to curtail the independence of electoral authorities, twist rules to their favor, use courts to restrict political participation
Stakes are high: 2018 elections could rebuild confidence &amp; strengthen political legitimacy in #LAC; failed elections would damage governance &amp; exacerbate challenges of economic growth, trade, drug trafficking, migration and the crisis in #Venezuela. @JimSwigert #HFAC
"While democratic advances are ongoing (e.g. in #Argentina) public confidence in democratic institutions is in decline." @JimSwigert on #LatinAmerica in 2018

Democracy day is everyday. What words define a democracy to you? #SpokenWorldNDI #SpokenWord #Democracy https://t.co/4QIsFTHCWB https://t.co/zC250a6e53
5.1 e.g. In Colombia, victim reparations can de-escalate tensions, establish rule of law, support peace negotiations https://t.co/1w9EK4Al7s
5. In a post-conflict context, transitional democratic political processes are necessary for reconciliation. #InternationalPeaceDay
4.1 Elections can still be flash-points for violence. Lessons from C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire on how to mitigate this potential https://t.co/TfZdjWvG6h
4. Democratic #elections resolve a legitimate competition for power through peaceful, rather than violent, means. #InternationalDayofPeace
3.3 e.g. In CAR, NDI &amp; local partners worked w/ #Christian leaders to facilitate the return of #Muslims who had fled https://t.co/Fr5iRQhYKj
3.2 e.g. NDI works to build relationships bet/ Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo through people-to-people approach https://t.co/Fr5iRQhYKj
3.1 e.g. NDI program bridges divide bet/ #Syrian refugees &amp; Jordanian communities by providing venue for dialogue https://t.co/Fr5iRQhYKj
3. Especially in post-conflict societies, inclusive democracies can reduce polarization &amp; bridge intergroup divisions #InternationalPeaceDay
2.1 Civilian oversight is particularly important for the #security sector. https://t.co/oLfFryPTYI #InternationalPeaceDay #democracy
2. Democratic institutions (parliaments, media, civil society, etc.) help guarantee government's focus on citizen interest, the public good.
1. Political battles may be inevitable, but in stable democracies they are waged without violence. https://t.co/StS0M0a85T #PeaceDay2017
