"We were reminded in the primary that every vote mattered," Olszewski said, adding that the victory tonight was a relief.
Just spoke directly with John Olszewski Jr. and he said first order of business tomorrow morning is to start building a diverse team with whom to work.
Olszewski finished his speech to large cheers. Many campaign volunteers and supporters are embracing around the room.
Olszewski said he hopes to continue that approachable tone during his time in office. 		"Tomorrow, we get started," he said.
Olszewski said he asked people during the campaign to refer to him as 'Johnny O' because that's what family calls him. He said everyone in the room is family tonight.
Olszewski pledged to work toward a responsible, transparent and open government, he said to cheers. "We will take ideas no matter where they come from, because politics will never get in the way of what is important in Baltimore County."
"We've done it by pushing people to imagine what is possible," he said.
"We‚Äôve done this by building a diverse coalition that reflects the collective strength of our county and who we are as a people," Olszewski said.
"At first political insiders didn‚Äôt give us much of a chance," Olszewski said. "In fact they wrote us off. But I believed in Baltimore County, and I believed in each of you, and in turn you believed in me."

Organizers are beginning to ask students to move to the front of crowd in order to lead the march. Adults encouraged to let the students lead.
Rev. Curtis Price of First Baptist Church of Salt Lake helped organize the clergy here today to support students taking a stand against gun violence, he said.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think death is the answer,‚Äù Smullin said. ‚ÄúOur children deserve better than a lottery system. A single gun death affects multiple generations. I want to stem that tide.‚Äù

18-year-old Isaac Reese said the pro-gun group‚Äôs promise for protecting students feels empty to him.
The students are aware of the pro-gun group assembled across the street. Both protests are calling for change, but through different means.
Senior Ermiya Fanaeian, 17, said the price tags reflect how much each student‚Äôs life is valued by politicians. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely shocking. Is this what our lives are worth?‚Äù

Just spoke with Fire Chief Anthony Clousher. He said fire appears to have started on a back porch and extended up the side of the house.
The animals, Malone said, were not fosters but the homeowner's pets. The homeowner is not in scene yet.
"A house you can rebuild, but you can't replace your pets," Malone said.
Malone was told the animals might not have made it. She started to cry when she learned all were safe.
Trisha Malone works with the homeowner at Happy Hounds Homeward Bound animal rescue, a foster-based organization.
"...I knew it was nothing good," Carr said.
"It was heavy smoke but I thought it was a wood stove. It turned out to be more serious. Once I saw the flames coming out..."

Clousher says he doesn't know yet who owns the structure that is still ablaze.

That's all from me right now. Check @theeveningsun for story to follow.
The Combs family does not live on the property but farms it for strawberries and blueberries. Combs said the losses were "just stuff."
"It was like a tinderbox," he said. "In a way, I'm lucky I didn't lose more." The family usually keeps goats in the barn in winter.
Property owner Larry Combs said the barn was for storage and full of family belongings and a deconstructed log cabin.
Some smaller buildings near the barn were charred but able to be saved by fire crews. No word on monetary damage but the owner has insurance
Biggest struggle for crews was bringing water to the scene from remote sources. We're in a fairly rural area.
The fire, which totally consumed a barn, took about 40 minutes to extinguish. No one was injured at the scene.
Littlestown Alpha Fire Co. 1 Asst. Chief Steve Staub said the cause of the fire is unknown but appears to have originated near a tractor.
@ChrisEckstine @abc27News @theeveningsun yes you may
Still waiting to speak to fire officials but I did speak with property owner Larry Combs. He said the barn that burned was used for storage.

Engineer Robert Sharrah is speaking now. Sharrah's firm designed the Mason-Dixon Downs project seen here: https://t.co/MFdIfiVL6v
Pennsylvania legislators are in the process of deciding how to calculate the local shares (flat figure or percentage based)
In Pennsylvania, casinos and racetracks give a portion of revenues to hosting municipalities.
The economic impact of his project would be found in jobs and local share assessment, LeVan said.
"From a property tax standpoint, there would be significant value going on the tax rolls," LeVan said of his project.
LeVan said his purchase agreement with Mason Dixon is conditional. If he cannot get a license or permission to build, he will not purchase.
The current owner of the property being eyed for Mason-Dixon Downs is Mason Dixon Country Club LLC.
I'm going to estimate we have about 125 people in here now.
The application for the license is due June 14 to the State Horse Racing Commission.
LeVan says, to his knowledge, he is the only developer to announce he will be applying for this horse racing license so far.
Belt said that public comment will happen at the end of the meeting, with a three-minute limit per person.
The commission will eventually have to decide whether to change Freedom Township's zoning ordinances to allow for a casino and racetrack.
LeVan is here tonight with other representatives on his project, dubbed Mason-Dixon Downs, to give a presentation to the planning commission
Local business man David LeVan is proposing to bring a casino and harness racetrack to Freedom Township.
Commission member Wayne Belt just announced we only have the building until about 9, so the meeting will end no matter what at 8:45 p.m.
The meeting has just started. I've counted about 100 people here, though a few more are trickling in.
I'm at the Freedom Township planning commission meeting. Location was moved to a larger space. This is the largest crowd I've seen yet.
@ChefAndyLittle It should be noted that not everyone on council feels the borough should stop mowing the cemetery. But the question was asked who owns it.

The supervisors just unanimously voted to pass the issue to the township's planning commission for consideration.
The township solicitor says Yannetti has asked that the township may change the zoning OR create a separate zoning district.
Yannetti has asked the board to pose any questions.
LeVan: Gaming and Pennsylvania's rich historic districts already coexist.
LeVan is talking about jobs, public safety and water access to the casino.
LeVan willing to "voluntarily formalize an agreement with Freedom Twp to guarantee it receives the millions in gaming revenue it deserves."
David LeVan is speaking now. He says the plan will not contain a residential component.
Yannetti says Jim Simpson, president of Hanover Shoe Farms, is present as well.
Here's a picture I obtained from the township. Again, this is a preliminary plan subject to change. https://t.co/ZKNNPjOuZ0
Yannetti has a poster board with a picture of the Mason-Dixon Downs project. It's facing the supervisors at the moment.
Attorney Bernie Yannetti, representing Mason-Dixon Downs, is preparing to speak.
I should preface the casino presentation tonight with saying we were told at the last meeting these plans are subject to change.
The group handing out the stickers is called "Adams County for Jobs, Growth and Prosperity."
As I look around the room, a number of people are wearing pro-casino stickers that were being handed out before the meeting.
Supervisors are now considering other items on the agenda. It looks like the presentation on the casino is coming last.
@Tim_Prudente Shout out to all of your hard work in the past! I believe I've read every word you wrote about previous Gburg casino plans.
Public comment has ended.
Paddock: "We're asking Freedom Township to take a stand and say thanks, but no thanks."
Susan Paddock, chair of No Casino Gettysburg group, said her petition has about 3,300 signers, and 68% are from Pa.
Solicitor: The board is in no way going to make a decision on this tonight.
...proposed ordinance change. If any change is approved, it will then go back to the township supervisors for final ratification.
The solicitor just clarified to the room that the township's planning commission and then the county planning commission will review any...
It looks like there was some confusion between residents about what the supervisors are considering tonight.
We're about 20 minutes and there's some tempers rising. Supervisors and residents are civil but there's a bit of talking over each other.
Another resident Lucas Waybright said he believes a casino will be detrimental to his family's farm operations.
One Freedom Township resident just said she opposes the proposal to change the mixed use district to allow for the use of a casino.
Public comment has just begun.
The meeting has just started. It's standing room only with about 80 people here (i'm estimating). All three supervisors are present.
...to allow casinos and racetracks in mixed use zones. LeVan is under contract agreement for a property in a mixed use zone.
Tonight, LeVan and other representatives are planning to give some details about the project in hopes Freedom Twp will amend zoning laws...
This project, dubbed Mason-Dixon Downs, includes a harness horse racing track in Freedom Township on a property off of Route 15.
The first two locations were proposed in Straban Township in 2005/06 and in Cumberland Township in 2010. Neither were successful.
For those of you unfamiliar with the project, local businessman David LeVan is trying for a third time to bring a casino to Adams County.

Rabine had no word whether the building was insured but did say the owner had been on scene.

Rabine: The fire took 45 minutes to get under control. No individuals were injured and the restaurant, which is closed down, was vacant.

Despite the loss, Wright was optimistic. "I've got a bright outlook. It's okay. There is nothing in that house that couldn't be replaced."
Wright has lived in the house for 35 years. He does not have homeowners insurance and plans to stay with a neighbor tonight.
Someone driving by called 911 for Wright, who had left his phone in the house, he said.
Wright: "I opened the bedroom door and saw smoke so I got low and crawled out. Then I blew the horn of the truck hoping someone would come."
...of the candle. Wright did not hear the fire at first because he sleeps with a noise machine. Smoke detectors eventually woke him.
"I'm so ashamed. I looked at it last night. I wish I'd blown that son of a so-and-so out but I wanted to finish it off," Wright said...
Homeowner Dan Wright lived at the house alone. He says he was home when fire started from a candle he left burning overnight in his kitchen.
Leedy: cause of the fire is undetermined at the moment and the Pennsylvania State Police fire marshall will investigate.
Leedy: No one injured in or responding to the fire. One live power line fell as a result of the fire, but Met-Ed was able to cut power
Leedy said the house, which took about 40 minutes to extinguish, was a total loss. Red Cross is on the scene assisting Wright.

Spoke w/ Chief Martin. Police responded to a reported hit &amp; run at about 7:10 p.m. where a 4-year-old girl was struck while crossing street.
Dispatcher did not know the age or which hospital.
York County 911 is confirming that a pedestrian was struck. It was a child. The child was transported to a hospital by ambulance.
Hanover Police Chief Chad Martin is in the scene. Hoping he'll give us some information but at the moment he is talking with other officers.
Photographer @shanedunlap has just joined me. We're watching officials take photos of the scene. It's a pretty quiet, residential block.
Police lines have been set up and the length of Princess street is blocked to traffic @theeveningsun @ydrcom
Looks like a thorough police investigation is underway. I'm seeing multiple officers. At least one is examining street with flashlight.

Hollie: "I'm glad to see this many coming out. There's been a lot more controversy this year so it's a pivotal election."
I spoke with Kim Hollie at the end of the line. She has voted here before but never seen it quite like this.
Doss did not want to disclose who she was voting for but hinted it was "the person I dislike the least."
Doss: "We're yacking away. It's like Black Friday without the shopping."
Craig said they've been waiting about 40 minutes. "Not too bad."
Spoke with Gordon Craig and Kaye Doss who were standing at the front of the line just outside the doors.
"I guess it's a good problem," Morgan said of the crowds at Union Twp polling place. "The issues have been so strong this year."
People and some law enforcement are helping each other locate spots to park, including in the grass.
I spoke with the Littlestown Chapel Pastor Scott Morgan who said this site has about 105 parking spaces. Every last one is filled.
Hawn said this station is seeing about 50% voter turnout right now (approximates 1,060/2000 registered).
I spoke with Union Township judge of elections Veronica Hawn who said the line has been line this out the door since 6:30 a.m.

Waiting to hear from the fire marshal now.
Man taken to the hospital's name is James Stephens. He's 41 years old.
Some fire apparatuses are leaving the scene now.
The boyfriend and Dietrich's daughter were the only two home. The man was taken to the hospital. Daughter, 14, was unharmed.
Dietrich was at work when she got a call from a friend who works for a fire department telling her that the home was in flames.
I just spoke with Wendi Dietrich who lives in the house with her daughter, boyfriend and his daughter.
Miller: "we were watching tv and I heard a couple of pops. I thought it was a fender bender."

Oss is hoping that after the building is sured and wrapped for protection, they can give the restaurant a green light to reopen next week.
Just finished speaking up with the building owners, Jay Mackie and Monica Oss. No word on the monetary damage to the building, they said.
There is a lot of dust that has been kicked up as a result of the movement of debris.
Just to give you an update on the scene, the heavy machinery has been parked. Several crew members were measuring parts of the building.
"They are very nice people. It's a shame. They didn't need this," Kuhn said of the restaurant workers.
I spoke with Ed Kihn, of Gettysburg, who eats at Li's Buffet often. He came to the scene to see the damage for himself this morning.
Li:"I'm hoping to get back up &amp; running as soon as possible. I got tons of texts, not from friends, but from customers asking if I was okay"
Li hopes his insurance will cover the damage to his restaurant. His landlord was also on the scene assessing the building
Li: there have been two car crashes into this building in past years involving drivers under influence. Cause of crash today is not clear.
2/2 Li: "...We love this location. It's just that this is always happening at night after 2 a.m."
1/2 Li: "Any kind of business is frustrating. In the restaurant business, location is everything..."
Li said he'll probably have to let the employees go and hope thy return when the restaurant reopens. He doesn't know when that will be.
Li: "It's frustrating, I guess. We're losing money. I have 10 employees. I didn't know what to say to them. They depend on that too."
I spoke with the owner of Li's Buffet, Jin Li, whose business has been in this location for about 7 years.
Gable: All of the utilities are turned off. No one was in the building at the item of the crash.
@katesharmon I spoke with the owner and he talked about that incident too. This is apparently the third crash into this building.
Gable said a pickup truck was involved in the crash but couldn't give much more description because "there wasn't much left to look at."
Gable has been up since about 3 a.m. Responding to the crash. "We have to sure up the building so we don't have further collapse," he said.
When i arrived, I spoke to Gettysburg Borough manager Charles Gable, who was overseeing public works and staff during cleanup.
Right now, several backhoes are scooping up the rubble and creating in the side parking lot. The street is completely closed to traffic.
When I arrived, one of the fire police was handing out coffee to media and the business owners.
Scene is incredible. A building corner has collapsed. I can see exposed metal beams &amp; a picture hanging the wall of the upstairs apt.
The crash occurred in the early hours of the morning. For photos and details, check @h_jonesphoto and @theeveningsun respectively

@h_jonesphoto @escbeck Thanks Harrison! You did an AMAZING job too!
I'm heading home from the scene now. Check @theeveningsun for more updates tomorrow morning!
Residents at the Brethren Home nearby are being told to shelter in place but the home is located outside of the evacuation radius.
Received an update from Columbia Gas officials and the PIOs. They anticipate repairs to the line will take place between midnight and 4 a.m.
A large York County department of emergency services caravan of vehicles just drove by toward the scene.
A handful of Comcast trucks are congregating in the Crosskeys diner parking lot but they don't appear to be doing anything at the moment.
We're seeing lightening in the distance and wind appears to have picked up a little.
Again, if you have questions for me about the Hamilton Two gas leak, tweet them out! I'll try to get you some answers in return
Press is still being kept further down the road from the scene as the half mile evacuation radius is still in place.
Just to give you an idea of what I'm seeing right now, there are still plenty of emergency crews on the scene but the mood seems calm.
If you haven't had the opportunity, check in with @escbeck and @h_jonesphoto who are also on scene with me taking photos.
@fayeperry4 Absolutely!
That's it for this round of updates. Visit @theeveningsun for more as we go along tonight!
UPDATE: McCutcheon said the driver has been on the scene since the crash and is uninjuried but "shaken up." PSP is investigating.
There have been no injuries as a result of this incident (neither responders nor residents), McCutcheon said.
The count of 4-5 people was as of a half hour ago, Hartzell said. Since then, some individuals secured places to sleep and left fire dept
Hartzell: No total count on the number of homes affected but it's a fairly rural area. About 4-5 people were relocated to local fire dept.
Hartzell: There is no telling how long the process of securing the leak will take.
McCutcheon: There are 40 responders on scene right now. Red Cross is assisting, offering meals for the crews.
Hartzell: No decision has been made regarding the Conewago Valley School District holding classes tomorrow. That decision is up to district.
Hartzell: PEMA sent notifications to locals. Note that messages are often sent in wider radius than evacuation zone as precaution.
"All of this is preventative in nature," McCutcheon said of the safety measures being taken. "This is part of good planning."
McCutcheon: There are eight fire companies here from York and Adams counties.
Hartzell: The local power company has also turned off power in some surrounding area.
...Columbia Gas representatives are here now assessing the scene, which is not yet secure.
Hartzell: Around 6:30 p.m. this evening, a white pickup truck backed into a Columbia Gas line, causing the leak...
For those of you without Facebook, I'll tweet out the details now.
PIOs McCutcheon &amp; Hartzell just returned to press lines to give us an update. Visit the @theeveningsun Facebook page to see the live video.
RT @gragoYDR: Gas leak has emergency crews evacuating residents near New Oxford https://t.co/zdpJhWzOHv @LillianEReed @h_jonesphoto @ReadyPA
American Red Cross has just a arrived and is setting up shop at the Dollar General closer to the scene.
@gragoYDR that question was asked and the PIOs are not sure at this point in time.
McCutcheon handed out his cell to press and welcomed follow-up questions by text. Tweet your questions at me and I'll try to get answers.
Both men will return to the press line soon with more info, they said.
Both Hartzell and McCutcheon have taken a list of questions from press and will return with answers, they said.
Hartzell: PEMA was used for placing reverse calls to residents notifying them of the evacuation. Police followed up by knocking on doors
McCutcheon: The safety of life and property is our primary goal. The evacuation zone is a half mile radius around 3316 Carlisle Pike.
Hartzell: crews from Columbia Gas are on the scene developing a plan to address the gas leak.
Hartzell: A truck backed into a pipe, located at a Columbia Gas regulator station, and broke it.
Public Information Officers Russell McCutcheon, of Gettysburg Fire Dept, and John Hartzell, of Adams County, just gave press updates.
3 fire apparatus have relocated further away from the scene but are not leaving.
Route 94 north of Cross Keys is closed to traffic. Cars are being diverted to Route 30.
More emergency crews are arriving in addition to the dozen vehicles already here. Columbia Gas crews are here with back hoes.
We're parked at the Crosskeys intersection. The emergency crews are situated about a quarter mile north on 94.
Press has been moved back further from the scene (myself and @h_jonesphoto ) Homeowners have been evacuated to local fire station.
I'm at a reported gas leak near the Cross Keys intersection. We're being told a 1-mile radius around the scene has been evacuated

I'll be filing a story with full details about the case shortly. Check @theeveningsun for more information soon.
For clarity, Adams County District Attorney is Brian Sinnett.
Delaney is currently in custody at Adams County Adult Correctional Facility and has not yet been arraigned, Sinnett said.
The investigation into Oak Lawn Memorial Gardens took place over the course of five months and involved thousands of interviews with police.
If found guilty, Delaney may have to pay restitution, Sinnett said.
"Greed reveals itself in many ways," Sinnett said before adding that Delaney is innocent until proven guilty.
Sinnett: Delaney has operated the cemetery since the 1970s and has never been audited.
Sinnett: The statute of limitations prevents Adams County officials from filing charges for alleged crimes prior to that time.
Sinnett: that's most he's ever dealt with for one case. Delaney alleged stole more than $1 million from victims over a 5-year period of time
We've been given a list of 689 known victims of former Oak Lawn Memorial Gardens owner James Delaney.

Public confronts Spring Grove official for Islam comments https://t.co/7XwIxlF9fy via @theeveningsun @ydrcom https://t.co/JoAc8U4aAW
That's all from me about Spring Grove school district board meeting. I'll be writing up a story to be posted @theeveningsun later tonight.
King felt the church's sign wishing a blessed Ramadan was "in bad taste" and that people upset over Jansen's comments were "too sensitive."
King said he agreed with Jansen's initial comments and did not feel an apology was necessary. The two men shook hands outside after the mtg.
Another Spring Grove resident Joss King stood outside of the meeting with a sign that read the "First amendment protects all free speech."
When pressed, Jansen said he does not intend to resign at the moment.
Following the meeting, Jansen spoke with myself and other media. He plans to think about the requests for his resignation, he said.
@Coach_Ralph Board officials distanced the district from his comments &amp; shared school policy. It does not appear there will be a censuring.
We're at about 7:40 p.m. -- meeting has ended. No more comments were made about the sign incident.
@Coach_Ralph Was that your personal experience?
About half of the room (maybe 15-20 people) stood up and quietly left as the meeting continued.
...or remove a fellow board member. Board president Cindy Huber thanked everyone for coming and then started the next portion of the agenda.
District solicitor Leigh Dalton, of Stock and Leader, Inc., clarified to room that under PA Law, the board has no authority to discipline...
Public comment ended at 7:17 p.m.
One more gentleman spoke following Stauffer. He asked that Jansen resign and the school district take a "firm stand."
Stauffer begged Jansen to reconsider his term of service on the school district board.
Your representation sets the tone for our district," Stauffer said. "Your representation should exemplify respect."
The third member of the public to speak was Becky Stauffer. Stauffer has a child entering kindergarten in the district this year, she said.
Seitz-Brown brought a posterboard that read "Ramadan Kareem." That means noble or generous Ramadan, she said.
"You are in a position of power and authority. The decisions and comments you make influence people," Seitz-Brown said.
The next public speaker was alumna Ann Seitz-Brown. She expressed that she believed this could be a teaching moment for the district.
The teacher was Susan Korsnick, a Spring Grove Area School District taxpayer. To clarify, she is a teacher outside of the district.
Public comment begins. A teacher is the first to speak..."There is not room for hatred or discrimination in Spring Grove School District."
Jansen has just issued a public apology prior to public comment. "I know what I did was wrong. It was a kneejerk reaction."
Jansen is present. The meeting is about to begin. It's a fairly full room -- more than 30 people in attendance.
I've already spoken to two Spring Grove locals who are attending the meeting to express their upset over Jansen's comments.

"Life is about experience and relationships...trust and integrity are the foundation," Hirneisen said.
Hirneisen recalled advice from his own parents on the importance of integrity during his speech. "We'd rather have you fail than cheat."
The high school faculty speaker was Col. Todd Hirneisen, a decorated veteran of the war in Afganistan. He's taught math, science for 20 yrs.
"Let people give you advice...take credit and give credit where credit is due," Coates said.
"With every mistake you will grow into a better you," Coates said.
The next student speaker Sarah Coates spoke to her peers about their power and opportunity to exceed expectations.
"In the infamous words of David Bowie 'I don't know where I'm going from here but I promise it won't be boring,'" Vega quoted.
Vega also pointed to the recently deceased singer David Bowie and his life as an example to her peers.
Vega's advice to her classmates: "Find what fatigues you in a good way."
Student speaker Ellianie Vega kicked off the ceremony with her speech.

Generally speaking, those I saw handing out fliers today are educating voters on which delegates support which presidential candidates.
Now that her candidate of choice is out of the race, she is putting energy into handing pamphlets for Republican delegate Amy Sarah Brennan.
"I still have a bumper sticker on my car," Diguglielmo said with a laugh about Rubio's campaign. "I'm not ready to let go yet."
Her candidate of choice was Marco Rubio so she was disappointed that he dropped out of the race before she could cast her vote for him.
Diguglielmo, who is a student @gettysburg , wants to be president herself some day. So she's getting involved in the political process now.
I just spoke with 19-year-old Giulia Diguglielmo, who has been handing out pamphlets for delegates since 7 a.m.
The no. of people voting is lower this primary than last year's but about 430 have still come out, said Isaac Huggins, judge of elections.
Gettysburg Borough's ward three polling station is quiet but certainly not empty. There's a steady trickle of people coming in and out.
Next I'm heading to Gettysburg Borough's Third Ward polling station to talk to voters. Tweet at me if you have questions you want answered!
"The primaries are important this year," Randall said. "We do have contested races."
Randall has already run out of the pamphlets and notepads he was handing out earlier. It's been a steady stream of people today, he said.
Rich Randall of Straban Township was handing out fliers about which delegates support Ted Cruz, his candidate of choice.
...for the 2012 number of people to turn out to a presidential primary. About 250 showed up that year. Today his station is nearing 500.
Tim Staub, judge of elections at the Straban Township municipal building, said that his polling station passed the record...

Hoses being rolled up. That's all from me right now. Headed back to the office. Check @theeveningsun for a full story later tonight.
@beaubowden yes there was a large fire maybe two/three houses down over the summer.
Cromer explained that chargers left in outlets will heat up and blow out, causing fires.
"Unplug them," Cromer said about phone chargers when not in use. "Especially if you didn't buy them with the phone."
Hanover Chief Cromer just spoke to me. Said cause of fire was a phone charger left in an outlet. No one was hurt in the fire.
"My mom and dad are so thankful it didn't spread," Carbajal said. "It could have done all through the building."
Just spoke with Jonathan Carbajal who maintains the apartments with his father, who owns the property. Confirmed they do have insurance.
You can see fire crews inside the structure now. https://t.co/1KygkZvc6B

Deputy Chief Clousher with Hanover Borough Fire Department confirmed address is 217 Carlisle Street rear. Two males live at the residence.
Lots of lights have been set up inside of the residence. It appears that fire crews are going through more meticulously. Mood is not urgent
A neighbor Matthew Sullivan says his friend used to live in the residence and that it is an apartment building.

Littlestown borough public works employees have arrived.
I'm seeing parts of the house including fiberglass laying discarded in the yard. Window of the basement is broken
More workers with Columbia Gas have arrived and seem to be checking out areas around the house.
We were told by Chief Kellar that the most extensive damage is to the rear of the house. Definitely still work being done inside.
I'm counting about 40 fire, police and gas workers on the scene. I have a view of garage. Looks like the ceiling has been torn out.
RT @DustinBLevy: About four engines still on the scene in front of the residence. One rescue vehicle.

That's all of the info I have. Check back with @theeveningsun for more updates. We will be continuing to report as more info is released.
The cause of the fire is still under investigation by PSP Fire Marshall. Names of the woman and her son have not been released.
To clarify, no one was hurt as a result of the rounds going off.
Boehs believed about 75 to 100 rounds went off as a result of the fire. No one was hurt.
No one else was in the house. Fire did totally destroy the structure. At one point some live rounds that were in the house did go off.
The woman was found dead on the enclosed porch at the rear of the house. The male was airlifted to Bayview in Maryland for burn treatment.
The officer was unable to find her and was himself taken to Gettysburg hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation.
Make told them his elderly mother was still inside house, which was engulfed in flames. Cumberland Twp officer went inside to find her.
When they arrived they saw a male trying to escape a bay window at the second story of the house and helped him out.
Cumberland and Liberty township police responded to a call of fire and entrapment just before noon.
Cumberland Township Police Chief Don Boehs just spoke with press. Scene is under investigation by Pa. State Police fire marshal.

It's quite blustery outside as well but an otherwise cold and clear day.
Just to describe the area, this house is located in a fairly rural area. Lots surrounding fields with the house itself in a wooded section
I can no longer see smoke from the tree line where the house was located. Several of the engines have since left.
Crews were try to get further into the building using axes. The was smoldering at this point.
Still waiting for info from authorities. Before I moved I saw a house with severe fire damage. Flames appeared to be out for most part
Sorry folks for the typo. I'm at Pumping Station Road in Cumberland Township.

Myers has escorted me closer to the scene. Here's what I'm looking at. https://t.co/t56VbdbatV
Myers declined to identify the two individuals taken to York Hospital.
Myers: There were two individuals in the tow truck at the time of the crash, both of whom were taken to York Hospital, one by helicopter.
Myers said a cause of the crash was not immediately known.
Myers: A green vehicle being carried on the back of the tow truck fell off of the flatbed onto the deceased's vehicle.
Myers: The deceased was driving a pickup truck which struck the rear of a flatbed tow truck.
Pennsylvania State Trooper Michael Myers has verified that the deceased was male but declined to identify him. Family has been notified.
Fire crews are using power fools to cut open another door a the vehicle. A gurney is near by.
Here is what I'm seeing https://t.co/cHvVzkc4qS
I'm waiting for an official from state police to come give me more details. More to follow.
Potter went to redirect traffic while others helped the driver who he described as an older gentleman. No confirmation on last part yet.
Potter broke the wire connecting the battery terminal to cut the electric from vehicle, helped peel back the windshield to get to the door
Potter heard the horn of the pickup truck the deceased was driving and saw smoke pouring from under the dash inside the vehicle.
Potter ran over to help along with several people inside of Breighner's Tire Center located across the street.
Potter said he didn't hear any tires breaking but heard a loud bang and the sound of metal scraping.
Robert Potter lives just along the road where the accident took place. Said he was outside when it happened.
On the scene of a fatal car crash on Hanover Pike in Union Township. Accident occurred just south of Pine Grove Road.

I reached out to the borough's finance director Sam Miller to clarify where this $37,300 is coming from and what it means for residents.
Previously, members of Hanover Borough Council stated that the museum would be renovated without using taxpayer money, but rather donations.
The budget draft allots $37,300 for improvements to the Hanover Fire Museum on page 34.

Keillor has concluded his speech (to much applause) and has now been presented with a flag that was meant to be flown today at the cemetery.
"...but we haven't given up. And we come to Gettysburg and are awestruck at the memory," Keillor said.
"As for government of the people, by the people, for the people, it continues to be a struggle, especially the by and the for..."
"We are awestruck every time we come to Gettysburg. We are awestruck by the memory of what happened here," Keillor said.
"I'm well on my way to being the last person who remembers seeing him," Keillor said. Many laughed.
"Last living veteran of the battle was a man named Albert Woolson of Duluth, Minnesota, who died in 1956 at the age of 109," Keillor said.
The letter is "a mashup of excerpts from letters by twelve soldiers - two from the south, the rest from the north," Keillor said.
"In regard to the country, it is beautiful, the most beautiful I have seen since leaving the fair state of Minnesota," he read.
"Loyalty shows itself on every hand and we get lots of good living." - Keillor read.
Keillor is reading from the letters of soldiers in his speech.
Keillor: "Columns of men hiking along, blue and gray, through farm country toward what they knew would be a major and terrible battle."
Keillor is recounting the story of the battle of Gettysburg. "Pure circumstance settled on Gettysburg as the meeting place."

RT @shanedunlap: Residents listen to engineer Eric Mains on stormwater permitting for Conewago and Hanover. More @LillianEReed https://t.co‚Ä¶
I'm going to be working on an article about this stormwater management information tomorrow morning. Check back @theeveningsun for more!
@JoeGothie @shanedunlap Luckily, as a journalist, I count myself as one of those nerds. But I appreciate your sympathy! It's a tough subject
Hafferty: A church for example, who is normally exempt, would not be exempt from this. "It would be like forgiving your sewer bill."
Another question:: Who could be exempt?
Hafferty: Everyone is impacted by this. If you own a property you are going to be impacted at some point.
Hafferty: Typically a lot is handled by municipality. A consultant could also be hired for short term projects like mapping.
Another question: As we get further along, who is going to be in charge to manage or coordinate this project.
Another question: Are impervious surfaces going to include sidewalks? Mains: Yes.
Hafferty: We do encourage residents to coordinate changes to property with your municipality. Every case is unique.
Hafferty: If you look at Pa., different fees may range from $30-70 a year.
Mains: There are permeable concretes. Going stone is going to lesson what your fee may be.
Another comment: When I go to put a driveway on property, it's going to be stone?
Hafferty: Some of it will be opportunity based. If PennDOT comes in to make road repairs, municipalities could do work at same time.
Mains: With this fee structure, municipalities will be able to tackle projects they may not have been able to tackle before.
Mains: What you might see is funding going to replace certain pipes. It will not be ripped up all at once.
Another question: Are they going to be ripping up roads for existing pipe structures?
If anyone has questions that they would like me to ask the engineers following the meeting, now is the time to share!
The presentation has ended but the engineers are fielding some questions.
Mains: We are undoing 30 years. It's just going to grow in its depth. It's a long process and there's going to be a lot more mtgs like this.
Mains: We don't want this to be a doom and gloom thing. You have to keep the perspective that what we are doing is right for environment.
Woman mentions Frederick Co.,Md. that was required to pay fee for roof runoff. They set it as 1 cent. (Disclaimer: unconfirmed anecdote)
Someone has raised a hand.
Hafferty is gave examples of what other towns have done w/ their fee structure. Lancaster did a tiered structure based on square footage.
A closer look into the potential fees - there could be variable fee, flat residential, or tiered residential. Again, municipalities decide.
Apologies for some spelling errors as I go along, I'm typing my fingers off!
Hafferty: Another reason why we thought regionalization would be a good idea, we do want consistancy.
Those last items were just potential ideas for ways to pay for all of it. Municipalities will have to decide on their own how to approach.
Potential funding of Stormwater Mgmt: revenue requirement, rate structure alternatives, billing units, fees per unit for each alternative...
There are nine categories of things that could add up as costs. I'll be listing them in my upcoming article in more detail.
Mains: So how are we going to pay for this?
Mains: This is documenting municipal operations, facilities, activities that contribute to runoff.
6. Pollution Prevention/ Housekeeping for municipal operations.
However municipality has to now follow up and make sure a construction project was done correctly following a plan approval.
5. Post construction stormwater management activities. This is nothing new according to Mains. It's usual practice for construction sites.
Mains: We are trying to get ahead of that curve.
Mains: City of York got caught in one of these and it was hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.
Mains: Your'e going to be audited with these things. When EPA comes in and audits you, it's not a fun experience.
4. Construction site stormwater runoff control. This has a lot to do with erosion. Conservation districts could be involved with this.
EPA does audit the stormwater systems which is why a map would be a handy tool.
3. Illicit discharge detection and elimination. You must inspect outfalls, systems. This involves creating a map of all systems.
2. Public involvement and participation. This could involve starting a committee to provide notice and opportunities for public review.
There are several requirements. 1. Create public education and outreach on stormwater impacts.
A little more deatil from Hafferty about the permits...
Hafferty: The benefits of a regional stormwater management plan would be economic for residents and help municipalities implement projects.
Hafferty: Other stipulation of permit is to create "green" plan to cut back on pollution, for example through rain gardens &amp; other projects
Hafferty: Once a permit is issued, must submit an annual report documenting that the minimum control measures specified by the DEP were met.
Hafferty: Each municipality must submit an application known as an NOI to the Pa. DEP.
Mains: There are more than 100k streams and rivers in the watershed that feed into the bay.
Mains: The bay contains 18 trillion gallons of water, half of which comes from the watershed area. Other half comes from the Atlantic Ocean.
Mains: Why does it all matter? Well it has to do with the Chesapeake Bay watershed area.
Mains: The residential population has to have 1,000 people per square mile. So this affects Gettysburg, Cumberland, New Oxford, Hanover, etc
By 2010 census definitions, the DEP defined Hanover, Conewago and surrounding areas as an "urban area."
Mains: This second phase affects Hanover-region municipalities.
Mains: In 1999, the Clean Water Act i,plemented a Phase II permit for small municips. within designated urban areas.
THis update required municipalities with populations over 100k residents to acquire a Phase 1 NPDES permit.
Mains: Updates to the Federal Clean Water Act regulations created the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system in 1990.
Hafferty is explaining the types of urban development types that are found in water cycles.
We've had a few more filter in. About 30 people total are here.
Hafferty: MS4 means a municipal separate storm sewer system.
"Stormwater presentation will be given by Mike Hafferty of Gannett Fleming and Eric Mains of Buchart Horn," Hanover manager Flo Ford said.
There's about 25 people here. I recognize many government officials from Conewago, McSherrystown and Hanover.
First 15 minutes or so is going to be geared toward the plans for a new Conewago Township recreation park at the old Hanover airport.
I'm at the Stormwater Management meeting at SAVES in Conewago Township with @shanedunlap . I'll be livetweeting as we go along.

The two presenters then showed a video about the Hanover State Theatre. There was a brief Q&amp;A after. Here's a few pieces of info from that:
Other ideas came out to use the space as a lecture hall, church space, even a space for a boxing ring.
Kilkelly: We'd have to think abou tanother space where some of this could happen -- a duality of the space itself.
Answers: Live preformaces, symphonies, trade shows, dinner theaters, film festival, Rocky Horror Picture Show performances, live streaming.
Hirsch: What should go into that building?
Harrison mentioned that the downtown has an image issue right now. It's perceived as a dangerous, scary place, she said.
Answers spanned from local businesses like the Hanover Hub and the Hanover Art Guild to the dowtown homeowner as potential beneficiaries.
Hirsch: Who stands to benefit from the Hanover State Theatre?
Someone mentioned that keeping volunteers and board members excited about the project was important as well. "People get burnt out."
Hirsch: We are going to be looking for board members for this organization. We need a small group to carry it forward from tonight.
More mentions include the state of the building, whether Hanover's community would support activities that the theatre may offer, etc.
Hartman said that Hanover LIttle Theater is another group with similar goals. Harrison said that "one does not preclude the other."
Another listed the Eichelberger, or rather duplicated efforts, as a challenge. David Adler, exec. director of the Eichelberger, was present.
Clarification on this last comment. The building is currently for sale but the owner of course reserves the right to sell or not.
One woman who's name I did not catch listed the current owner as a hurdle, citing that they may not be willing to sell the theatre.
Justine Kilkelly of Main Street Hanover listed the theatre's current condition as a hurdle.
Harrison: Emphasis on the preception of lack of parking as being a challenge. Several people added in affirmations to this.
Another person listed ownership as one of the challenges. Robinson and Hirsch later confirmed that the current owner looking to sell theatre
Slagle listed the Hanover Borough as a possible challenge.
Hirsch: What are the challenges the Hanover State Theatre faces? (Several people sighed at this question)
Another person talked about doing outreach to local schools to get student and classes involved in attending future theater events.
Alex Slagle, owner of the Hanover Hub, mentioned that it would be a huge benefit to community to focus on the arts.
Harrison: It could bring so much life to the downtown, so much foot traffic.
Hirsh: What if we said 'What could it be to the community?" Could the answers to that be any different?
Hartman: We don't want to forget that we have the Eichelberger either. Several heads nodded to this statement.
Hartman mentioned taking a road trip cross country and encountering several historic theaters that were used by towns for proms, weddings.
Hanover resident Pam Hartman told the room that she used to go to there in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Her father-in-law was the projectionist
Another resident who's name I did not catch mentioned there is retail space in the front part of the theater.
Harrison mentioned that a liquor license for the location would be advantageous to hosting events.
Tabitha Harrison, owner of Abithat's on the square, said she didn't want the theater to necessarily be pigeon-holed as one thing in general.
Hirsch told the audience that this was just brainstorming and that there would be some more details about the building given later on.
Chesney said that last quote in response to some residents asking fo rmore information before they give their input to the building.
Chesney: I've heard it's in horrifici condition and should be torn down. I've heard it's beautiful inside. I just don't know.
Hanover Borough resident Heath Chesney told both moderators that residents need some context for the building and what we have to work with.
Hirsch: There's a faux balcolny. It's not a whole complete second floor. Robinson clarified that there is not a second floor at this point.
One person asked if there was an upstairs on the theater where other activities could be held. There was some confusion over building layout
Several answered with a venue for off-broadway dinner theater, an alamo draft house model, place to show theme movies and a movie theater.
Hirsch: The first question I have is what can the Hanover State Theatre be?
Jennifer Robinson, interim president of the Friends of Hanover State Theatre, recorded all ideas as bulletpoints on a big notepad up front.
That would be followed by the viewing of a short four minute video about the Hanover State Theatre and then a 15-minute Q and A session.
Hirsch explained that the meeting format was as follows: four question will be asked of the audience with 15 minutes allotted for responses.
We were introduced to Don Hirsch of Theatre Design &amp; Development firm in Montpelier, VT. He specializes in historic theater restoration.
I'm going to retro-tweet (is that a thing) the meeting since live tweeting didn't work out. There were appx 30 people in attendance at mtg.
Alright so I just got out of the meeting. I believe being underground in the basement messed with my wifi access.
I'm having trouble with my tweets going through but I'll be tweeting all of my notes out as soon as I'm in better service.
I'm at the Hanover State Theatre focus group and hearing lots of great input from Hanover residents about hopes for the building.
RT @kpetiford: The @theeveningsun team got together for a pic on my last day. #Hanoverrrrrrr http://t.co/3opJw2rAbA
@AlissaFalcone Le next time we are there!
@hanoversuperman @theeveningsun Apologies, I didn't see this tweet somehow. The commissioners announced the location, then had a formal vote
Here's another flier next to the first. The topic #BlackLivesMatter continues to inspire many thoughts and opinions. http://t.co/rdgMTEYhcQ
Found this in the hall on the way out. This appears to be a photocopy of the original. http://t.co/2tIfffmOoB
The lecture officially ran an hour and 15 mintues. Check out @theeveningsun for a full story shortly.
Someone in the audience said "Amen" to that last quote. Tometi is receiving a standing ovation. The lecture has ended.
Tometi: I'm getting death threats. But I'm also aware that my silence will kill me.
Tometi on BernieSanders:Ppl don't take lightly that they have to interrupt someone. If situation wasn't so dire, they wouldn't be doing that
Tometi: I absolutely think that taking literal action is necessary.Types of civil disobediance in the vein of Ghandi and MLK is so important
Tometi: There's been literal and symbolic erasure of black experience. There's a logic of erasure that's been rationalized in our society.
That same person asked how she felt about that and how she could relate personally to opposition.
A person from the audience just told Tometi that the poster for her lecture @gettysburg was "defaced" and crossed out to say #AllLivesMatter
Tometi: I'm not concerned about our group being derailed. We have some of more brilliant minds and ppl committed to taking corageous action.
Tometi: We are a decentralized group. We want racial justice and black racial justice. There are number of groups that have a role to play.
Someone just asked about internal mechanisms in organization to keep it going.
Tometi: The term #AllLivesMatter as if we didn't believe that too is unfair.
Tometi: I think there's likely a bias against the word "black" period whether folks know it.
Tometi: I know that all lives matter. But if they really did, we wouldn't need #BlackLivesMatter
Someone just asked her thoughts on #AllLivesMatter in general.
Tometi also added that the amount of backlash surrounding #BlackLivesMatter was unexpected.
Tometi: THere's something about simplicity and owning your choices...The fact that you want to stand with your community unapologetically.
Tometi: If you are that out of touch with the brutality and disparity that our community is facing, then you just don't get it.
We are beginning the Q and A session. First question is about word choice of #BlackLivesMatter especially in comparison to #AllLivesMatter
Tometi: It can bend toward justice but it's not going to bend on it's own. I encourage you all to be a part of the bend toward justice.
Tometi quotes Martin Luther King Jr. - "The arch of the moral universal is long but it bends towards justice."
Tometi; There are many others that came before us in the movement of #BlackLivesMatter
Tometi is giving her lecture about her co-creation of the #BlackLivesMatter movement.  http://t.co/vH8VjUZYzc
Tometi: answer is all of the above. http://t.co/70Wuw2gUcE
That last one was a direct quote from Tometi.
Ultimately I believe justice is not inevitable. We are not just going to willynilly find ourself in a world where everyone is getting along.
Tometi said her background is in communication and mentions how the language of how it is phrased is very important.
Tometi: It was imperitive for us to name the movement #BlackLivesMatter. The shame around race made it important to name it that.
Tometi: There's a term "post-racial era" but reality is exceptionalism of a few is a part of the project to keep us silent.
Tometi: I do think it's important that we talk about why it's been so hard for us to address the root cause.
Tometi: High rates of incarceration. 40 percent of those locked up are black even though they only make up 12-14 percent of the population.
She cites Broken Windows Theory which says criminalization of low level acts is helpful and allows for prevention of more violent crimes.
Tometi: It's also about some really significant laws that are in play right now.
Tometi: Entire racial groups have a trajectory...It's formed by our history. She cites slavery of blacks, genocide of indigenous ppls.
Tometi makes the metaphor of a tree's roots. Racism, sexism, transphobia, xenophobia, etc. all filter up from the root, impacting the fruit.
Tometi: We're seeing those who have power how are operating with those same types of implicit biases.
Tometi: There are systems that are at play, operating off of this logic that says black people are less than.
Tometi: It's this prevailing bias that causes folks to see us a particular way and make action on these biases.
She cites a few more studies with similar concepts.
Tometi is discussing structural racism, state violence. She cites a UCLA study that found white people &amp; police see black children as older.
Tometi: I think about the times that we live in where children can be taken like that. And it's not just any child. It's black children.
Tometi is talking about Tamir Rice who is 13 years old in Cleveland who was killed on a playground.
Tometi references that pivotal moment childhood where innocense is lost.
Tometi: I wanted them to know that there were people that cared for them, to take action, to change the story and to resist.
Tometi's love for her little brother was what prompted her (along with the other two cofounders) to use the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag.
Tometi: I was really struck by the fact that this person that I really love, something could happen to them.
Tometi: This truly could have been my own brother, who was 14 at the time.
...Our lives are devalued and don't matter.
Tometi: There was a huge question as to what was going to happen in this moment. The answer was that we are not welcome here....
Tometi: Watching way Trayvon Martin was essentially put on trial for his own murder was like watching one of our brothers or family members.
Tometi: I knew we had to do something more. In essence, we were all experienceing a certain degree of trauma, collective trauma.
Tometi: Folks were frantic. Folks were upset. Some folks knew and were really apathetic.
Tometi: I was astounded when I heard of the aquittal.
She has asked everyone to raise their hands who remember where they were when they first heard about aquittal. Many hands went into the air.
Tometi and two cofounders of #BlackLivesMatter created the hashtag two years ago after aquittal of George Zimmerman.
She grew up in Arizona -- a place she calls ground zero for the immigration movement.
Tometi is the daughter of Nigerian immigrants. Her Twitter handle is: @opalayo (she just shared it with the audience).
Tometi: The #BlackLivesMatter movement is in many ways about democracy in America.
Tometi: I use (the song) as a way to prime us to hear about a few different threats.
For those of you who can't view the link, it's a song titled "Welcome to America" by the artist Lecrae. Look it up at your leisure.
Tometi is starting off by playing a little bit of music. This is the piece she is playing for us: https://t.co/7HbvzZI2Ay
Tometi has stepped up to the podium. She says its an honor and a privelege when she gets to speak at college campuses.
Looks like there will be a video slideshow accompanying tonight's lecture.
Room is absolutely filled beyond capacity. Everyone has just been shushed. Lecture is about to begin. Follow me as I tweet along.
Opal Tometi, founder of #BlackLivesMatter , will be speaking to a packed room at Gettysburg College.  http://t.co/pMPTlwGbx1
There will be a welcome from Ryan Dodd and an introduction of the speaker from Jennifer Bloomquist, according to the program.
More about Tometi - she has presented at the U.N. and participated with U.N.'s Global Forum on Migration and Commission on Status of Women.
People are literally standing in the aisles searching for an open seat, of which there are none. But don't worry, I got here early!
According to the program, Tometi will have a questions and answer session following the lecture. I've spotted two mics at the ready.
Tonight's lecture is presented by Africana Studies, EPACC and the Department of Economics @gettysburg College.
The room has very quickly become packed. It appears like it will be a full house.
Tometi, according to the program, is the executive director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration.
The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag has prompted a nationwide discussion on civil rights and spurred several spinoff hashtags.
If you aren't familiar with the case, Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of a black teenager Trayvon Martin.
Tometi, along with Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors, began the hashtag following the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman.
The lecture begins at 5:30 so in the meantime I'll share some background via the program I was handed at the door.
I'm @gettysburg College preparing to hear speaker Opal Tometi, co-founder of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. I'll be live tweeting.
RT @ydrcom: York County Human Services has been hit hard by the budget impasse. http://t.co/3DJM0AIOpX
Penska has finished his presentation. The county solicitor John Hartzell is giving presentation on legalese now.
Penska: York-Adams Mental Health will make a contribution of $775,987 toward the purchase of this building.
Penska: the county will pay $2.285 million for the property. It was appraised by the county and independent contractors to be worth more.
Penska: Freedom Transit Loop has expressed interest in possibly creating a public transportation route to that site.
Penska: Herff Jones is located within a 10-mile radius of 70 percent of Adams County residents.
Penska: there is room for expansion for intended use. We could have a magistrates office here. This gives us a lot of options.
Penska: Herff Jones building has 91,000 square feet, 26 acres and appx. 200 parking spaces.
Penska: Spectra-Kote building. The interior is unfinished and will require extensive construction to provide office space.
Penska: Middle Street property could be renovated but "needs of the future will be pretty much limited in a few short years."
Penska: the St. Francis building on High Street has parking issues, asbestos and lead paint throughout and limited parking.
Side note: Commissioner Randy Phiel  said last night that I will receive a copy of this presentation. I'll be sure to post it once I have it
Penska: Union Square had no onsite security and inadequate parking. Security is a big issue for children and youth services.
County Manager Albert Penska is reviewing all of the building options that the commissioners reviewed. First is Union Square building.
@thehoov @kpetiford @walt_walters 585 Boyds School Rd. The mtg is still happening so a fuller story with more detail will be up later.
Warren recalls his experiences with consolidation of human services in York County.
Steve Warren, of the York/Adams  Mental Health-Intellectual &amp; Developmental Disabilities Programs, is speaking to the room.
He mentions the parking issue. "People are putting Band-Aids on issues they don't quite grasp...there are limited spaces in Gettysburg."
Judge Kuhn has left the podium. President Judge George has approached and is discussing how the St. Francis building is not a viable option.
Pardon, his name is spelled Kuhn. He is discussing the history of how the courts decided to rent the buildings they currently occupy.
Phiel has just announced that the location will be the Herff Jones building in Cumberland Township. Learn more on @theeveningsun website.
The commissioners have now begun a "Human Services Building Proposal" presentation, which will discuss the building wishlist and options.
The commissioners just voted in favor of declining the single submission from the Request For Quotes. Qually sited price as a factor.
Everyone was allowed to return after about five minutes. I do not see Kellett.
Phiel quickly took the entire meeting into a recess. Everyone was asked to leave the courtroom. We all filed out.
Commissioner Randy Phiel repeatedly asked Kellett to sit and down and let the meeting continue. Court officers took Mr. Kellett by the arm.
Public comment had already ended but Kellett said to the room that the commissioners were allegedly violating the Sunshine Act.
Paul Kellett, who previously ran for Adams County Commissioner, just stood up midway through the meeting to "object."
Golden (right) reads a proclamation speaking out about how commissioners handled the human services building search. http://t.co/obHEy93W7z
Gene Golden, administrator of the Borovent Gettysburg Facebook page, wrote and brought his own proclamation against the commissioners.

They are now placing the presidential wreath at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial.
@WhipHoyer several times quoted Pope Francis's remarks from his recent visit to the site of 9/11.
@WhipHoyer : This is a cause that so many in this room have made a cornerstone of their work.
@WhipHoyer : all of these fallen heroes share in common the value of others above self.
@WhipHoyer : we will remember 87 names. 84 for those lost in the last year. 3 from the years before.
The sounds you hear are those of more than 100 bagpipers, I was told by a representative of the foundation. http://t.co/8RQzRApYLp
@WhipHoyer is about to speak at the service. He's coming on stage now.
People are being called to their seats. Looks like we are off to a late start but things are about to begin.
Just found a program. It's appears there are four individuals from Pennsylvania being remembered today.
The bagpipes have just started up here though everyone is still getting seated.

Many women in 1860s mourning garb and soldiers with a black feather in their cap could be seen in attendance.
Women were offered a Union soldier's arm to accompany them down the aisle to the their seat before the funeral.
Prior to the beginning of the funeral Getty's casket was flanked with attentive Civil War re-enactors.
Friends and family said goodbye to Getty accompanied by the tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic.
The funeral for James Getty has concluded and small processional of cars and horse-drawn carriages are heading to the cemetery.
I'll be covering the funeral and processional to Evergreen Cemetery but will refrain from tweeting during the service. Check back for update

Info session has adjourned after 22 minutes. Sheppard offered to answer questions following the meeting. People beginning to trickle out.
Next step is that Penn Township and Hanover Borough councils will need consider the merger independently during their public meetings.
No one else is volunteering to ask questions. Sheppard handed out his email to audience if people are "bashful" - psheppard@rhsheppard.com
Another resident whose name I did not catch stood up to say that he was 100 percent in favor of the merger. Roland expressed the same.
Sheppard: The current three station model will be maintained in the merger.
Answer came from Hanover-Penn Township Fire Chief Jan Cromer: Both municipalities are withing $100,000 of each other, about $2 million each.
Now time for questions and answers. Hanover resident Scott Roland is first, asking what each municip spends on fire services.
Sheppard: "Basically what we're talking about here is formalizing what we are already doing."
Sheppard: There's not just Hanover and Penn Township. It's a community. There should be one shared entity around it.
Sheppard: There will be a 15-year apparatus replacement schedule.
Sheppard: the number of personnel will not be reduced in the merger.
Sheppard: The merger will mean reducing the total 29 pieces of equipment owned between both municipalities down to 21 pieces.
Sheppard: When we get to the end, there will be time for questions and answers.
Sheppard: firefighters, EMTs have to train for 300 hours before they can volunteer/work. "That's a lot of personal time and commitment."
Sheppard: increased call volume and duties of those fire and EMS officials also play a role.
Some trends that were examined by the merger steering committee over 18 months was decreasing volunteer fire and EMS members statewide.
I recognize a number of Hanover Borough and Penn Township officials in the audience.
The meeting begins at 7 p.m. So far the sign-in sheet has about 50 names on it. Pete Sheppard is moderating the session.
As promised, I'll be live tweeting this public information session about the Hanover-Penn Township fire dept. merger.

Wyatt kindly gave me a little background on the agenda so if you have any questions, I can try to answer them for you. Send them my way!
Hanover: Here is an amended agenda for Finance and Personnel Committee mtg tonight from my meeting with Cindy Wyatt. http://t.co/tZXkAe5DlG
Moul: Wolf's budget can be achieved without a tax increase through pension reform and liquor store privatization.
One audience member just asked what are the reps doing to compromise.
"It's not illegal to cancel meetings and not show up," Moul said, referencing legislators during budget workshops and negotiations.
Several audience members have begun asking the representatives what they are doing to hold fellow legislators to task with passing a budget.
A handful of people have begun asking questions.
In addition to the budget, Moul and Tallman have discussed property tax, funding for schools, and a break down of the Pa. budget last year.
Tallman said he was not optimistic that the stop gap budget will be adopted.
The stop gap budget would establish a six month budget using the same amounts spelled out in last year's budget, Tallman said.
Tallman discussed how a stop gap budget has been considered as a temporary way of providing budget for 6 months while legislators negotiate.
Moul: If there are questions that can't be answered by reps tonight, citizens can write down name and number to get an answer later.
Moul: You almost have to thank people to care about it. I appreciate you caring, taking time out of your evening to come here and listen.
"Very few people are sending me emails saying 'the budget's late, it needs to be passed," Moul said.
"School districts are going to be in pretty dire situations," Tallman said, adding that Pa. ranks sixth in country for education funding.
Both representatives are concerned that October is going to be a critical for many social services if a budget is not passed.
There are approximately 75 people in attendance to the meeting including Adams County Commissioner Jim Martin.
I'm with @shanedunlap at town hall meeting in New Oxford with State Reps Moul and Tallman, who are discussing state budget impasse.
Hanover folks! Tomorrow is the boro's finance &amp; personnel committee meeting. Do you have any questions you want answered about the agenda?

Workers were from Columbia Gas. I've received word there is no longer a gas threat. Headed to office. Check @theeveningsun for more info.
Traffic on Baltimore Street has reopened but fire crews are still on the scene
Some workers appear to be removing a gas meter located right where the car struck the wall. It's unclear if there is still a gas leak threat
Fire crews are preparing to open Baltimore Street shortly. Trucks appear to be rolling out.
Gessner said the person put in handcuffs was unrelated to the incident.
Just spoke with Penn Township Patrolman Michael Gessner who said driver is believed to have fallen asleep at wheel. There was 1 passenger.
"I heard a thump," Sherdel said. "It sounded like a truck dropped something off the back of it."
I'm seeing scrapes in the concrete but the sign has since been removed. http://t.co/nHfrATgkSE
Fire crews still too busy to talk. A neighbor Bob Sherdel has pointed out that a no parking sign in sidewalk was knocked down too.

I'm seeing someone being escorted by Penn Township police in handcuffs into the back of a police vehicle. Still no word from officials.
Tow truck is on the scene. A portion of Baltimore Street is closed to traffic.
Here is a picture of what I'm seeing now. Neighbors are saying they didn't see what happened. http://t.co/Orx6tWSVAr
It was unclear if fire official meant gas as in gasoline or gas in the home.
I was told to move to a sidewalk on Baltimore street and refrain from smoking because of the potential that there was a gas leak.
The building appears to be a residence. I only see one vehicle that appears to be involved but that is unconfirmed.
I'm on the corner of Baltimore and O'Neill streets where fire crews are responding to a vehicle crash into a building.

@ghostladyofpa The case is a 1980 double homicide in Adams County. Check back for a full story soon.
This is an extremely detailed case w/ lots of info. I'm headed back to office to thoroughly review my notes, charging docs. Story to follow.
The arrest of Abraham Cruz is the most recent development in an 8-year investigation into the crimes by Pennsylvania State Police.
Wagner: Erasmo was dating Deborah around the time of the crimes. She ended the relationship leading police to believe motive was jealousy.
Wagner mentioned that in 1981 charges were brought against Deborah's brother, who went to trial but was found not guilty.
The alleged fourth individual died in 2005 and was never charged.
The third individual allegedly present during the shooting was Ruperto Garcia, who was 15-years-old at the time of the murders.
Erasmo Cruz, Abraham's uncle, was successfully extradited from Puerto Rico to Adams County pled guilty to murder charges on Feb. 10, 2014.
Abraham is one of four individuals police suspect were involved in the crimes that night.
"There is no statute of limitations for murder for this very reason," Assistant District Attorney Brian Sinnett said during the conference.
Officials believe four individuals were involved in the crime. Wagner said he aims to present evidence that Abraham Cruz pulled the trigger.
Abraham Cruz is currently in federal custody at a Pennsylvania county prison for unrelated matter. Wagner declined further comment on that.
There was evidence on scene that Molotov cocktails had been thrown into the residence. In connection, Abraham Cruz is charged w/ arson.
16-year-old Judy Lynn Patterson and 9-year-old John Paul Sell-Patterson escaped without injury.
John Paul Sell, Nancy's husband, was also shot but survived his wounds.
...Deborah had died of a shotgun wound to the face and Nancy had died of a shotgun wound to the back.
Police were called to the Patterson residence in Freedom Township on Aug. 30, 1980 around 3 a.m. where they discovered...
PSP arrested Abraham Cruz, Jr.  On Aug. 14 for alleged murders of 17-year-old Deborah Patterson and her mother 41-year-old Nancy Patterson.
Press conference is beginning now. I'll tweet as I go along.
The homicide charges are in relation to the alleged murders of Nancy and Deborah Patterson, according to the PSP affidavit.
Press has been handed copies of affidavits for Abraham Cruz, of who has been charged with criminal homicide.

It's looking like some crews are packing up. There is still fire company activity on the 2nd floor.
Fire crews still working but action appears less urgent. Still no official available to comment.
@livinginhanover so is our photographer @h_jonesphoto who ran over here like a true photojournalist when he heard the sirens!
That last quote was also from Bowen.
"Alarms went off &amp; we all came out," he said "It was almost like the smell of plastic. We'll be smelling it for a while when we go back in."
I can't smell or see any smoke but fire crews appear busy. Many are holding axes and self contained breathing apparatuses.
"We usually get fires but not like this," said factory employee Dave Bowen as he waits outside.
Fire alarms can be heard on the scene and about 30 people appear to have been evacuated from the factory.
It's at the New York Wire factory. No officials available to comment but fire crews are using cherry picker to access 2nd floor.
Just arrived on scene of a fire located on 500-block East Middle Street in Hanover, between Fulton and Factory.

This was the definition of mobile, cluster journalism. Check out the story I worked on about an intense fire. http://t.co/Koi3mS9qyr
Repetz: It's too early to conduct soil testing b/c of the structure fire. However the DEP will be involved in soil testing at a later date.
Repetz: Contamination did not appear to reach the Conewago Creek yet and this was well after time that they shut of the intake.
Repetz: By the time that the DEP got in to investigate, they were seeing just the beginning of evidence of contamination in Flagle's Run.
Repetz: New Oxford has several days of water supply in place and  interconnection w/ York Water Authority so there is no cause for concern.
Repetz: The DEP arrived on sign at 5:30 a.m. and New Oxford shut down their water intake at 8:30 a.m.
Repetz: Flagle's Run goes into south branch of Conewago Creek, which is main source of drinking water for New Oxford Municipal Authority.
Repetz: There was runoff getting into the soil a little, specifically a closely situated creek called Flagle's Run.
Repetz: Residents in the area are hooked to a public water supply and Hanover's main water intake was not in the vicinity.
Repetz: Hazmat crews from York and Cumberland counties conducted air samplings and found nothing toxic.
UPDATE: I spoke w/ Dept. of Environmental Protection rep John Repetz. He gave me some insight about environmental impact of today.
@thehoov Also, they said earlier a small dam was constructed to prevent water leakage. However, no word on whether was successful measures.
@thehoov I tried reaching the DEP communications person on point for the Miller Chemical fire and have not been able to make contact.
@thehoov As far as water, the officials have dug a large retention pond and have a pump system in place to maintain water levels.
@thehoov Thanks! The boom sounds were the result of sealed containers exploding when exposed to extreme heat.
Hanover Police Chief Dwayne Smith confirmed the fire police struck was a 68-year-old male.
Lawrence: One male member of the fire police was the lone injury today after being struck by a vehicle while directing traffic.
Lawrence: The Pennsylvania State Fire Marshall is still on the scene. No word on the cause of the blaze.
Lawrence: The chemicals being referred to specifically were fertilizers, but cannot indicate which ones.
Lawrence: There was one large runoff pond dug by fire crews to help contain the water levels.
Lawrence: Firefighting efforts with water were resumed at 2 p.m. "We are in a mop up phase now."
Lawrence: Fire crews allowed for a controlled burn in order to better maintain the level of runoff from the structure earlier in the day.
Representatives from the Department of Environmental Protection and Miller Chemical were not present at the press conference.
Lawrence deferred all environmental questions to the DEP and all questions about chemicals to Miller Chemical company.
SAVES Fire Chief Tom Lawrence was the main speaker at the press conference.
The Miller Chemical plant is almost entirely extinguished. Smoke that can be seen now is either steam or smoke from smouldering remains.
Local businesses are no longer being asked to remain closed either.
Press conference just completed. That will be the final one of today. The request for residents to remain sheltered in has been lifted
RT @theeveningsun: Another press conference on the fire in about 10 minutes.
The "shelter in place" has been lifted! There will be another press briefing in 10 minutes. More to come.
Listen in folks... https://t.co/DbZsUWL7Jj
@ChristinaCBS21 Absolutely no indication of toxins in the air. Apologies for any confusion, typos happened.
CORRECTION: I meant to type NO indication of toxins in the air. Apologies for any confusion. I'm working from an iPhone with autocorrect.
Bonus fact: I talked with many residents and the smoke has not bothered those with whom I spoke.
Public supplies of water are not at this time believed to be affected. Most residents are hooked up to municipal water supply already.
Though there's no evidence of toxins in smoke, there's a lot of it &amp; it's considered an irritant. Residents are still asked to stay indoors.
A vacuum tanker has been brought on scene to remove water from the pond and maintain its capacity.
Responders dug retention pond, constructed a dam to prevent runoff from chemical plant, which packages retail fertilizers like Miracle-Gro.
Here are five things to know about the environmental impact of this fire at Miller Chemical plant:
Just got another press release from Adams County Department of Emergency Services. http://t.co/9vwASMbU5N
They've just started bulldozing the building. It's smoking still but they are tearing the walls down.
To give you an idea of the haze that's surrounding here. Smell is like burning plastic http://t.co/QtrVCNMML3
Remember that metal panelling that turned white? Well now is is turning black.
Hope my word picture helped bc it's pretty incredible to stay in person. Again, lots of smoke &amp; residents are still asked to remain indoors.
It almost exactly resembles how a piece of paper looks when it burns. @kpetiford  is attempting to get a close pic now.
Since then, that damage has worked its way down the building to the very end. I can no longer see yellow and the building has folded in.
About halfway down the exterior wall on the north side was warping, ash and charring.
When I arrived this morning, I could see a long exterior wall of the building with yellow, metal panelling.
It's difficult to get a picture of what I'm seeing happening to the building but I'll try to describe it.
@jeffreywwarner @theeveningsun Fire officials constructed a dam and dug a retention pond north west of the facility. Reps from DEP here too.
Gladfelter: "As soon as I saw changes in the colors, I figured it was the chemicals. Every 10 seconds or so there were explosions."
Back to some eye witness accounts from John and Marian Gladfelter.
Some neighbors are out now, talking and watching the fire fighting efforts. For the most part the smoke has been blowing north all morning.
So far the Miller representative on scene for media was unable to confirm any details about the building or business.
Eline: Miller reps have been very cooperative and even had a chemist on scene to talk to fire officials about what was in the building.
Eline said fire officials defer to Miller for types, quantities of chemicals in facility but did say that the plant packages Miracle Grow.
RT @h_jonesphoto: Found a lot of dead birds on the ground as well, assuming they're dying from smoke inhalation
RT @h_jonesphoto: The damage to one of the sides of the Miller Chemical building. @theeveningsun #millerchemical #Hanover http://t.co/d3Pxc‚Ä¶
Eline: fire officials are digging a retention pond to contain any runoff from the structure but he deferred further questions to the DEP.
Eline: "We know there nothing toxic in the smoke." Air quality testing has been performed all morning at various distances from facility.
Eline: The "shelter in place" request is still in effect due to smoke and officials are still asking businesses to remain closed.
Eline: Officials concerned about severe thunderstorms expected this afternoon. "We're not quite sure how the fire will react to the rain."
Just got done another press briefing with John Eline, director of Emergency Services for Adams County.
Large black clouds started billowing from the building again. Fire crews seem at ease, no indication that this is unusual.
This is a press release from Miller Chemical. A representative is on scene but has been unable to comment so far. http://t.co/7U5tlQoEER
The storm could affect fire officials' strategy for containing the fire. More answers to come.
There is going to be another press briefing at 12:05 with John Eline. Stay tuned for more. Also, storm is expected to roll in around 2 p.m.
Gladfelter said he was fine but described the smoke he saw out his window as varying in color - white, black, pink.
Gladfelter &amp; wife Marian said they got a call from neighbor further down the street offering for him come over if he had trouble breathing.
I spoke with John Gladfelter, a resident in the 1000-block of High Street, who said he needs to sleep using an oxygen tank at night.
Was told by John Eline that the smoke contained not necessarily a toxin but more of an irritant. More a problem for people w/ lung disease.
I just walked further down High Street where street intersects with Radio. It is still extremely smoky and the smell is indescribable.
On scene there is still black smoke coming from structure. Officials are still asking for businesses to remain closed and residents inside.
@betting_im_not I bet many businesses are in same boat as you. Would you be willing to talk w/ @walt_walters about how it's impacting you?
@betting_im_not Unfortunately they were unable to tell us when the "shelter in" order will end. As soon as I know, I'll tweet it out!
This is a photo of the one mile radius that is being asked to remain sheltered inside. http://t.co/n5Jezw0zWR
Lawrence: Fire fighters working in the "hot zone" we're required to wear a self-contained breathing apparatus.
Lawrence: The building, which contains residential fertilizer, is still smoldering.
Lawrence: The wind was in our favor. If not, we would have been evacuating folks.
Eline: Approximately 10 fire companies were on scene here. They are still asking people not to drive to this part of town.
Eline: State Fire Marshall is still investigating cause of the fire. At one point decision was made to let the plant burn out.
Eline: The repeated booms that were heard were sounds of sealed containers exploding when exposed to heat. No word on what was in them.
Eline: Initially fire crews thought two maintenance workers were inside the plant during fire but later confirmed no one was inside.
Eline: the call to shelter in is still in place and will continue until further notice. He asked that businesses nearby remain closed.
Eline: Substances in plant were not necessarily toxic but irritants meaning smoke could be a problem for someone w/ chronic lung disease.
Eline: Officials continue to monitor air quality. Most residents ahave municipal water and wont need to worry about water contamination.
Eline: there were concerns with chemicals in the water runoff so they have constructed a dam behind the pant to stymy contamination.
John Eline and SAVES fire chief Tom Lawrence gave media an update just now. Eline said crews have not used water for last half hour.

"At a couple of points it sounded like the grand finale of a fireworks show at the Fourth of July," Brown said.
"There must have been so many explosions throughout the night. The windows were shaking," Brown said.
So far there has been no indication of any damage to neighboring homes but Brown said he noticed some grass on fire near Miller Chemical.
"We were fortunate the wind wasn't blowing in another direction," Zeigler said of the fire's threat to his home.
I watched some residents move traffic cones in order to sneak their cars by but so far it seems like most residents are remaining inside.
Zeigler said he needed to call off from his job at paper factory in Spring Grove because residential roads have all been closed.
Greg Zeigler, who also lives in 1000-block of High St., said sounds of explosions resembled cannons. He also received call from borough.

Sponseller, who has lived in her home for 47 years, said company put fence up following 9/11 but that is unconfirmed.

That was the entirety of the note, Wagner said.
Note in Leipold's bag: "F- your childish games. All of your wars against humanity will fail. The chainsaw killer have come out to play."
Leipold owned 12 firearms which he had obtained legally according to state and federal regulations and a license to carry, Wagner said.
Active shooter Jess Leipold, 32, had been staying at Adams County Mission up until four days prior to incident at prison, Wagner said.
"We had no warning here. We had received no reports of threats he had made. He was not on our radar whatsoever," Wagner said.
Video from prison &amp; taken by civilian, &amp; testimony from 8 law enforcement officials @ scene corroborated Nickey being justified.
Pa State Police's Sgt. Matthew Nickey was the ranking officer at the scene &amp; responsible for firing shot, Wagner said.
@thehoov last weeks incident, yes.
Wagner: officer involved was justified in using deadly force.
This press conference is to announce if legal action will be taken against the officer involved, Wagner told me yesterday.
Just to update: the active shooter was shot by an officer following a 30-min standoff at the prison. He later died from his injuries.
Press was ushered into a conference room. Waiting for Adams County DA Shawn Wagner to arrive and conference begin. Tpr. Hicks is also here

Audience question and answer portion of the debate. First question returns to Walmart.
Qually: I'd be the dissenting vote but we [commissioners] all agree on this. We all sit on advisory prison board.
All candidates agree more programs in prison system are needed. Kellet asked Qually if he'd be dissenting vote in favor of more programs.
Stokes: County gov't is gov't of last resort. Whatever the federal and state gov't doesn't pick up, it's the county's job to do.
Qually: Any amount of poverty is too much. In Adams County, we have a huge amount of working poor.
On how best to serve poor and underprivileged. Kellet: We need to think about programs proven and cost effective to stop cycle of poverty.
TIF projects debated pretty thoroughly. Proposed Walmart super center in Straban Twp is focus.
All three commissioners raise questions over location of the building. Qually reminds candidates that nothing has been decided yet.
Question 2 asks candidates opinions on proposed new county building near Adams County Adult Correctional Facility.
Candidate Paul Kellet replied to Qually with "2-1 votes don't have to be antagonistic but they should reflect your values."
"3-0 Votes are not a sign of failure. That‚Äôs a sign of success. I'm not going to vote no just to see a no recorded," Qually said.
