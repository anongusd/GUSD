@b777brenda @EdKrassen I think normal every day citizens would only need two guns,	1.A hand gun for home robberies and protection.	2.A normal hunting rifle for emergency food shortages.
@b777brenda @EdKrassen Also many countries have strict gun laws and are not dictatorships, and a bonus is kids aren't killed in Schools every few months.
@b777brenda @EdKrassen I don't want law abiding citizens to be stripped of their guns, I just think it is unnecessary for people to own guns that shoot 600 bullets a min,	Why would anyone need a gun like that?
@b777brenda @EdKrassen The constitution also says "A well regulated Militia, is necessary to the security of a free State", in 1781 the most powerful gun could shoot 3 bullets a min, and the people were the military, Now people can buy guns that shoot 600 bullets a min, people don't need guns that fast
