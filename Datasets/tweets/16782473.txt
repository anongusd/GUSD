@bigshow my choice to drive

@bigshow your opinion..... like i said there are 2 distinct sides on this issue.
@bigshow dont you have enough issues in AZ. to be worried about WTF we do here anyway.
@bigshow that would be retarded,,,,, looks like we are all retards except you special 30 percent that are smarter than the rest of us
@bigshow dont think its an evil plot either..... your healthcare law must be unpopular because you are calling names, not your style
@bigshow distinct &lt;sp&gt;
@bigshow there are 2 distimct sides on the HC issue for and against, the debate about the law is actually over, its law
@bigshow  you want us to suddenly like this healthcare reform just because it passed?
@bigshow if only symbolic
@bigshow just like the point was made when America voted in Obama on the rejection of Republican ldrship, we vote against bad laws
@bigshow untill a court calls it unconstitutional or something, but the point is made
@bigshow what do you mean become? thats what it is thats what we call it, you know what we are talking about anyway, Missouri is out

Cleaver always seemed tougher when he was mayor, thought he would aggresively defend his positions, not hide in the back
@DLoesch he was quite sassy LOL... the bad thing is, as much as I disliked him as mayor, I always respected him, so I can settle down now
we will see how the media spins it here locally
leaving townhall (in vehicle) no violence, cleaver didnt say anything except how we organize wrong and wont talk healthcare.

@bigshow I am not being bussed in by a pharm. company... I'm driving my clunker....
@bigshow I am going to the Cleaver town hall tommorow in lees summit mo. I will report back 2u... if you are right I'll admit it
@bigshow I never called you a liar and never will... I am in the afl-cio so I know what kind of rousing the leadership is capable of
@bigshow I have seen the "clips"
@bigshow both sides have their special interest. is it only ok if the dems do it? the majority imo are regular people
@bigshow I think she is ginned up because she is not informed and going to these meetings to get informed not bullied
@bigshow I dont buy that.... if its true then it is vast minority and the unions are showing up in droves as is acorn and moveon
@bigshow it wouldnt kick in for 3 years anyway... just like the stimulas that still has not kicked in...
@bigshow bottom line, why does this shit have to happen so fast? its huge, work out the kinks and have a solid plan.
@bigshow c'mon, those old ass grandpas and grandmas are paid denouncers? tell me that nobody has genuine concerns all a conspiricy?
@RightGirl no way.. his healthcare kicks total ass
@bigshow just because there is some weird definition of grass roots does not mean that people on their own r going to these to ask questions
@bigshow hooray we agree on something once again.... maybe if the gov. could find a way to agree once in a while it would be o.k. (illegals)
@bigshow thats one guy that may be a douchebag, but dont tell me that a lot of the labor leaders arent doing the exact same thing
@bigshow maybe they are doing their homework and they disagree w/ left pov. and negative ads? the msm is mainly for it...
@bigshow o.k., simple question.. disregard we pay for them now... do we foot the bill for illegals? are they to be covered?
rt  @rightblogs [hotair] Obama:“I don’t want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking”: "I want them just.. http://bit.ly/nyIfH
@spiritualtramp ok, then if we disregard the plants can we say that most are there out of genuine concern or support?
@bigshow  show me the money, and if it is true then it is no different than unions inciting membership to act
@bigshow word, got your stats.. touche... but can we not agree that the favor is falling? give us 2 months LOL
gotta go pick up my check that I busted my ass for this week... see you later
@bigshow send me a link to your polling data if you have it.... if I am wrong I am wrong
@bigshow why does it have to be called a riot? This is no different than the impeach bush crowd or other out of hand meetings
@bigshow thats probably not true from what I have deduced, IMO
@bigshow the public option if it is to pass
@spiritualtramp no different than liberal talking points, and I say that the unions are basically paid plants. I saw some old guys yelling
@lagomorph13 by the time they deem me useful enough for treatment, I will have gone insane
so people that oppose healthcare reform are paid lemmings not genuinely against it? hmmmm STFU Reid and Pelosi, assholes
I am going to go protest a healthcare meeting so I can get a GOP check... c'mon people, does anyone believe this? if so you are an idiot
@rancov well I guess somebody is getting punched in the mouth then.. :} (seriously)
@ricksanchezcnn I didnt get my protest check from the GOP and I know for a fact that SEIU is stacking the meetings and are being dicks
I got crabs and I blame Bush
if unemployment was at this level 2 years ago "inherited or not" would Bush be exiled   by now?
If my kid cannot afford a used car in a couple years because they are all crushed, I am going to punch someone in the mouth
I am going to invest in private cash only hospitals
is this healthcare thing even driven by a majority of citizens? is gov. already "doing what they think is best" regardless?
I am a member of afl-cio IAFF and I am disgusted by the reports of thugery at townhalls... makes me ashamed
