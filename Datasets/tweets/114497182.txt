@MattStrabone @SDCityBeat Thanks Matt.  I think the pod will be more fun than the legal guidance was!!
Thank you Mayor for the opportunity that I’ll always carry with me and for what you did for my hometown. I’m listening to @93XRT today in your honor.
But he also did what the vast majority of elected officials refuse to do - he took on throny fiscal issues that there are no popular solutions to but would have destroyed Chicago had they persisted. Totally thankless task to take them on but the city is so much better off for it.
His record will stand strong: record graduation rates, advancing universal pre-K, free community college for good students, and huge growth in employment are already clear accomplishments.
People never believe that I had more fun working for @MayorEmanuel than any other candidate, but it’s the truth. Rahm’s combination of brilliant political instincts, never ending thirst for policy ideas, and hysterically harsh one liners made that race one hell of a ride.

Whoever offers a real, new vision here, not just poll tested boilerplate, emerges as '20 nominee (coupled with charisma of course!)
Most consultants say not to intro an opposition agenda because elections are referenda.  But a referendum on Trump in '16 wasn't sufficient.
Trump has relied on platitudes from the past -- close borders to trade!  Bring back coal! Dems have an opportunity for forward looking plan.
Huge education disparity in the 2016 election results.  Education also at the center of how we prep workforce for tomorrow's economy.
Glad Dems are unveiling an agenda today, but think we need to also intro big think solutions on opportunity in globalization/automation era.
