Also, if you give even a 1% tax cut to everyone, the highest tax bracket it going to recieve more money back anyways. Stop touting the lies. It’s just sad.
@pakopako1955 @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 The photo at the top of this thread said Rubio had about 3 million. I’m glad you were here to clear up the information and let everyone know Hogg is a lier. Thank you!
@Madodel1 @XRufio @artivistwoman @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 You’re right. The only way I make money is by offering foreign meetings in exchange for millions ‘donated’ to my foundation in a “Pay-To-Play” operation. Then on the way back from said meeting, I give a 500k speech on how women only vote the way their husbands do. Obviously.
@BocaGrande44 @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 Obama also lifted sanctions- but I see you conveniently left that part out. Trump didn’t hand over a single dime. I guess you can see whose the better negotiator.
@Gbruceybruce @artivistwoman @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 Yes we give money to Palestine, which fundamentally hates America. This would be odd to anyone normal, except... the Left applauds Palestine and therefore, we give them billions.

@MidModPicks @artivistwoman @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 Who says they love N Korea??

@MaryjaneMjmalin @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 And lifted sanctions. Obama got trampled home and abroad. It’s just too hard for you guys too admit it. I’m sorry Obama was a complete and utter failure. It’s okay, maybe one day you’ll nominate a candidate who isn’t a crook. (Gonna have to wait until Hillary goes away)
@Cokech @IgnitedTrueWord @davidhogg111 I remember a time when #Democrats didn’t love terrorist states like Iran- or hoped that #DPRK would get the better of our President.

But all you can say is “we’re f— up”
@BasicKoell @FoxNews @Maga Do you think that once Obama finally left office that the ramifications of his mishandling of foriegn affairs was over? No. We’re still feeling the disastrous effects of his kowtowing and now Trump has to go around fixing everything. I’m glad though- makes Trump look good. #MAGA

@Burnowski @BasicKoell @FoxNews @Maga Makes sense the typical Bernie-Hillary supporter has absolutely no evidence or claims in a sentence- if you can even call it a ‘sentence.’ #YouMad? 🤣🤣🤣
@BasicKoell @FoxNews @Maga You’re right. I just saw Trump gave 150 billion dollars to NK to not make nukes for the next ten years... Oh wait- that was Obama’s Iran deal whoops. No, Trump is not “selling out” America. If you think that, you obviously haven’t researched anything about Trump’s foreign policy.
@FoxNews What our President is doing is historic! He is doing what our former president, who got trampled on in foreign policy, and those before him, could never do! This is what it looks like to @MAGA
@Al00l00 @ileneasbury @USCentrist @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Uhh Obama offered Iran, a state-sponsor of terrorism, billions of dollars so that we could 'trust' them not to make any more nukes after ten years. Trump's a businessman. Who do you think is a better negotiator? The kowtowing former president, or the billionaire businessman?
@DeniseAlbares1 @JeffFlake @larry_kudlow @GOP He's so horrible in fact, he's out solving what Obama could never do!

@KamalaHarris Everyone ever who has gotten a higher education before has paid for tuition by themselves or with the help of parents. I'm not sure what the fuss is about all of a sudden. It's not like college tuition immediately skyrocketed when @BernieSanders ran for president.
@Vader671 @FoxNews @POTUS "It is our sacred obligation to pay tribute to the thousands of men and women of our Armed Forces who have been imprisoned while serving in conflicts and who have yet to return to American soil"		Don't worry, he gets hostages back too.
@Mike_Lowry19 @CNN I mean there are hundreds more. But you can stick to fake news CNN if you would like, but there is no denying that Trump and Republicans in general know how to manage an economy better than any Democrat.

@CNN Definitely wrong about that. It's Trump's economy. Sorry CNN.
Keep America Great! A vote for Trump in 2020 is a vote for low taxes, low unemployment, high GDP growth, strength in foreign diplomacy, a strong military, and unlimited winning! #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020 #Trump https://t.co/15QwqZnixl
But... but... Russia... https://t.co/oP6ShYf7k3
@FoxNews @POTUS At least one president does!
Absolutely Amazing. @realDonaldTrump is making a difference, and its time for the media to start reporting it. https://t.co/QcQuC5w97m
We've seen from day 1 of the Trump presidency that the Dems don't want to play ball with anything that has to do with the President. Despite his overwhelming accomplishments, Dems still try to resist and obstruct. Too bad for them, #PersistenceTrumpsResistance
@KamalaHarris Please dont. Like, really. Please. No.

Thank God we’re out of the Iran Deal. Not only does this deal not make sense, it’s an embarrassment to the United States and her people. If the world decides to not cooperate with America, so be it; they need us more than we need them.

The Correspondents dinner was just sad. Felt so bad for Huckabee-Sanders. Being made fun of and accused of lying. Baseless accusations to ridicule someone. Disgraceful.
@BradBosseMusic @EdKrassen Again, I refer back. Why does Trump have to prove he’s not guilty, as opposed to them finding actual evidence (of which they have none). The entire Russia farce has been created as a crunch for HRC to blame the election on, ignoring that she was a genuinely a bad candidate
@Aanna1123 @KamalaHarris I’d love to be in the 1% because that’s the only way you can afford Obamacare premiums. An operation costs twice what it did before Obama ruined our healthcare. He didn’t even like the idea of a single payer system, but adopted it when he trailed Clinton in the primaries.
Senator Tester has lied about Trump’s nominee, Mr. Jackson, for the VA spot. Looks like Montana is getting a Republican Senator
RT @SarahPalinUSA: This one would be well deserved. https://t.co/DcQN5IODsT
@OSUDaily @senrobportman Yes, a traitor that has brought back the economy, lowered unemployment, strengthened our alliances abroad, and denuclearized North Korea. Such a “traitor”
@KamalaHarris Hopefully a full repeal will make Healthcare affordable. Obamacare disrupted a perfectly fine industry to appease the liberal base. Very sad.
@EdKrassen @BradBosseMusic Adam Schiff will literally say anything to stay relevant. They just CLEARED the Trump campaign. Why does Trump have to prove he’s not guilty as opposed to the other way around?

Q1 GDP Growth in 2016 (Obama was president) was .6%-anemic to say the least. Q1 of 2018 (@realDonaldTrump president) GDP at 2.3%, higher than expected. Its called Making America Great, folks.
Obama: Nobel Peace prize simply for living                                                        Trump: Lowest AA and Latino unemployment, war on opioids, denuk’d NK, working relationship with Israel- No Nobel. Double standards??
