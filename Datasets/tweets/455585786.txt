Voters of color will be turned off by people who claim to be a minority having not faced the systemic societal barriers minorities face in this country. https://t.co/Ff1RWatkGu

I’ll remain an @MSNBC contributor, another role I would not have but for the Herald. Anyway, enough about me - everybody go back to work! We’ve got a paper to put out!
Much has been said about the very tough last year the Herald has had,so I’ll just add this: Boston needs and deserves a local tab full of voices that reflect that great city, speaking truth to power. I can only pray @MediaNewsGroup understands and lives up to that responsibility.
A glutton for punishment, Joe hired me back a few years later to cover Washington. All the while, he’s been the kind of challenging and dogged yet supportive and encouraging editor any journalist would be lucky to have. Hope I did you proud, Joe.
The biggest and more heart-felt “thank you” goes to @BHSciacca, for taking a chance on me almost 15 years ago when I had no idea I could be a political reporter, and trusting me to deliver the Herald’s coverage of City Hall and the State House.
I leave voluntarily (I specify because so many of my talented colleagues were not so lucky), but with an abundance of gratitude to all the amazing current and past reporters, editors and photographers I’ve had the pleasure to work with and learn from.

#SCOTUS https://t.co/drBef3P6EA
This press conference is precisely why the president is disincentivized from ending the shutdown. He can keep the focus on the wall. If the shutdown ends, so does his platform. It very well could last months or years.
He said there will quickly be a deal if Supreme Court overrules the 9th Circuit. If the shutdown continues, all federal courts, including the SCOTUS, will eventually stop operating.
Trump keeps citing a federal court ruling blocking his DACA rescission as a reason he walked away from DACA deal. That ruling was about executive authority - it had nothing to do with Congress’ ability to pass legislation.

Another observation: Recent Massachusetts politicians with national ambitions have distanced themselves from the state. Romney talked up his Michigan roots, then became a Utahn. Scott Brown moved to New Hampshire. Warren’s Twitter profile and campaign video brand her an “Okie.”
Warren said she has already received donations from all 50 states, DC and PR. Today.
2020 Elizabeth Warren sounds a lot like 2012 Elizabeth Warren.
Warren seems to be answering every question, including those about Trump, by saying she is running because Washington only works for the powerful and rich and she wants to “build a movement” to change that. She’s said “build a movement” a few times.
Warren sounds like her mind is already made up, despite saying her final decision will come next month: “I’m in this fight all the way.”

This is not the first time Trump has conflated antisemitism in the United States with U.S.-Israel policy.
Well, that kumbaya moment didn’t last very long.

And no, just because one side has been more consistently brutal with its attacks does not give the other side license to make unwarranted swipes too. If you have an issue wth a story, say it. But if you believe in a strong and free press, attacking it only serves to undermine it.
Can we could learn to make criticisms that aim at the target without blasting an entire industry already under siege? Broad swipes at “the media” - which includes hardworking journalists getting it right every day - aren’t helpful. They’re harmful. No matter which side deals them

Trump, lamenting how unfair the process has been to Kavanaugh, was asked if it’s been fair to the accusers. “We gave the doctor a tremendous time, which is great.”
Asked about the Kavanaugh FGI probe limitations, Trump begins by lamenting “the trauma for a man who is never had an accusation” like this made against him.

I’m not even sure how they can agree on the weeklong delay if @senatemajldr doesn’t back that move. That’s a point that others on the committee are making too.

Kavanaugh comes back after the break and apologizes to @SenAmyKlobuchar for answering her question about whether he’d ever blacked out after drinking with the retort: “Have you?”
Observation: GOP committee members only break their silence at this hearing to express their anger over how Kavanaugh has been treated.
I know I’m a broken record, but everything about this hearing underscores how impossible it is to vet a claim of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct before a political body like the Senate.
This has been the message of Trump’s core constituency from the beginning. https://t.co/l25yyu6gva
Wow, now @LindseyGrahamSC is testifying, red faced. “You have nothing to apologize for... I hope everyone in American can see this sham.”
When Durbin asked if he personally thought that an FBI investigation was the right thing to do, Kavanaugh sits back and answers with silence. Later says he’s done everything the committee has asked him to do.
“You know that’s a phony question,” Kavanaugh says to Durbin when asked if there should be an FBI investigation.
The tears have nothing on the aggreived anger.
My goodness, Kavanaugh talking over Leahy as he questions him about yearook statements. “No, no no — I’m going to talk about my high school record if you are going to sit here and mock me!” Being angry at an allegation is one thing. Open hostility to Senate Ds is another.
I mean, wow.
Kavanaugh, angrily: “The Swetnick thing is a joke. It’s a farce.”	Feinstein: “Would you like to say more about it?”	Kavanaugh: “No.”
Yep. https://t.co/W9iliJvzdw
Wow, Kavanaugh ended by turning the “imagine an accuser is your mother/sister/daughter” approach on its head, saying he should be judged by the same standard that should be used for “your father, your brother, your husband or your son.”
I suspect Kavanaugh’s statement is going over well at the White House.
Very different Kavanaugh than he presented in the Fox News interview. Gone is the choirboy. In his place an aggrieved man who “embraces” drinking beer and says that doesn’t make him a sexual predator, and claiming otherwise would make America “an ugly place.”
Kavanaugh is shouting his opening statement, not just angrily denying the allegations by Ford and other accusers, but also punching at Democrats for what he calls a “grotesque and coordinated charter assassination” that he says goes all the way back to the Clinton admin.
Re Sen. Graham’s comments, GOP strategist to me: “I don’t know what Lindsey is doing. He’s not helping, I’ll tell you that.” Suggests Graham is being Trump’s messaging surrogate.
GOP between a political rock and a hard place - they fear backing away from Kavanaugh would cause base to revolt, but ignoring a credible accuser who just captured the attention of America would likely be just as perilous. Unclear what happens next.

Lots of talk of this looking like a trial. That’s because Rachel Mitchell is a prosecutor. She’s doing what she’s trained to do. It was GOP committee members who made the decision to hire a prosecutor to do the questioning for them.
Ford gets emotional when she describes what she remembers most of the night in question. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter — the uproarious laughter of the two, at my expense.”
Ford is using her psychology expertise to explain why she is confident in her memory that Kavanaugh pushed her into a room, explaining how memories are encoded in the hippocampus.
Speaking of her deliberation of whether to come forward publicly, Ford said she worried she be “stepping in front of a train that was headed where it was headed anyway, and that I’d be personally annihilated.”
@HeidiPrzybyla As tends to happen when a prosecutor is hired to do the questioning.
#mapoli https://t.co/ca8fJLC3Tk
Rachel Mitchell begins by acknowledging that Ford is terrified, and apologizes to her. “That’s not right.” Perhaps she should have helped Grassley with his opening.
@DionRabouin @GingerGibson The point was that MEN all have female family members, and that they need to think about them in order to feel compassion. I reject that. That compassion should be visceral.

.@SenFeinstein references Kavanaugh’s self-description as a virtual choirboy during his Fox News interview, an indication that it will be a key subject of questioning when he takes the floor.
While @ChuckGrassley focused his opening on his displeasure with the process by which allegations against Kavanaugh came forward, @SenFeinstein is focusing on how difficult it is for women with claims of abuse or harassment to come forward.
That was quite an opening by @ChuckGrassley.
If @ChuckGrassley wanted to convey to Ford that this will be a “fair and respectful hearing” after blasting the Ds as obstructionists for wanting an FBI investigation, not sure it’s working. Ford asked for the FBI probe too.
.@ChuckGrassley opens hearing apologizing to Ford and Kavanaugh for the threats they’ve endured over the past few weeks - then begins lamenting the fact that Ford took so long to come forward with her allegation. Called it “the ranking member’s secret evidence.”
Trying to imagine how history will treat the moment we are in. I don’t think it will kind.

Note here that @LindseyGrahamSC, like Trump, does not use Julie Swetnick’s name. Focuses on Avenatti. But Graham specifically casts doubt on the veracity of Swetnick’s sworn account - so in that way going farther than Trump. https://t.co/M5uyHQpnBS
While he urged his colleagues to seek the truth and act in good conscience, Flake adds: “Up or down, yes or no, however this vote goes, I am confident in saying it will forever be steeped in doubt.”
Flake says he does “not believe Dr. Ford is part of some vast conspiracy (to) smear Judg Kavanaugh.” And he does “not believe Kavanaugh’s is some sexual predator.”
On Senate floor @JeffFlake said both Kavanaugh and Ford have suffered character assasination. “I will say to these witnesses, these human beings, we owe you both a sincere apology.”

I’m not sure many believe Kavanaugh was that squeaky clean. Many do believe he sexually assaulted women. Many believe he’s a good man who made a youthful mistake. Not sure his choirboy approach satisfies anyone.
By making an unequivocal denial that he acted as anything other than a perfect virginal boy - denying even underage drinking - he’s locked himself in. Any deviation from that when he speaks - under oath - Thursday makes him look like a liar or worse.
Understandable why the GOP wanted to get Kavanaugh’s story out first publicly, in a friendly venue, to control the narrative heading into Thursday’s hearing. But it comes with clear risk.

President Trump accused Bob Woodard of writing his book to distract from the Kavanaugh #SCOTUS confirmation. Yet every time Trump talks to reporters today about Woodward’s book, networks cut away from coverage of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing to cover it.
This is wild. It also comes as a court ruled that districts in the state were impermisbly politically gerrymandered, and ordered them redrawn. (Districts also had to be redrawn a few years back after a court found unconstitutional racial gerrymandering). https://t.co/Y0dk0KQhT0
Yeah, I lived in this district too. Pressley is not a carpetbagging Chicagoan who just swooped into Boston. She’s an elected city councilor and has been involved in #mapoli for 16 years.

Technically, with the exception of the first few comments, all of these folks were recognized by @ChuckGrassley and allowed to speak, so they’re not interruptions. https://t.co/2bbfEhvjpS
In short: GOP has not disclosed all of Kavanaugh’s documents because they don’t have to.
Lots of senators bringing up the full disclosure of documents related to other nominees’ past work - including Kagan, Sotomayor, Roberts and Ginsburg. Important to note a key factor that existed during those confirmations that does not exist now: the filibuster.
So far the only folks who have said a word about the substantive issues in play for Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing — abortion, healthcare, executive power, etc. — are the protesters.
We are an hour in. No official opening statement has been made. The Democrats’ coordinated protest has kept the conversation entirely on the refusal to produce some documents, late disclosures and claims of executive privilege. @JohnCornyn accuses Dems of “mob rule.”
RT @kasie: Democrats plotted coordinated protest strategy over the holiday weekend and all agreed to disrupt and protest the hearing, sourc…
.@SenFeinstein mentions the GOP’s full block of Merrick Garland’s nomination. Make no mistake, this is part of what all of this is about.
As if he heard my thought, @ChuckGrassley: “If people’ve got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it. But it gets pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time.”
The coordination on the part of @SenateJudiciary Dems is as remarkable as Sen. @ChuckGrassley’s approach to largely let them speak rather than shut them down using parliamentary rules.
Well, at this rate today’s confirmation hearing session may last quite a bit longer than 2:30p. #Kavanaugh #SCOTUSNomination
And here we go: @SenKamalaHarris and @amyklobuchar and @SenBlumenthal interrupt @ChuckGrassley’s introduction of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing over the late production of documents last night. Blumenthal moves to adjourn.
Today will be the short day of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, expected to wrap by 2:30p with only opening statements being made. Tomorrow, when lawmakers begin questioning the nominee, will go from 9:30a until at least 9:30p, according to @ChuckGrassley.

This is a symptom of the polarized political climate. Justice Scalia was confirmed unanimously. Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96-3. The recent partisan fights that killed the filibuster planted the seeds for this. Same will happen with next Democratic pick. https://t.co/qxD1iOpw3Z

@lenetra806 The Dionne fax! One of my favorite Aretha moments ever! #Diva
Who was there when Aretha sang Mariah’s “Touch My Body” at DAR &amp; said just cuz she’s a church girl “doesn’t mean I don’t want somebody to throw me on the bed. Now, if somebody tries to throw me on the floor, we gonna have a problem. We ain’t doin’ nothin’ on no floor!”🙋🏾‍♀️
What I love most about Aretha is that she was always unapologetically who she was. She took no gruff from anyone. And she certainly didn’t work for anybody. She graced us with her gift. And we were privileged to receive it.

@dankennedy_nu Why do people need training to know that a black student eating lunch is not a situation that warrants a 911 call?
The answer to this question is NO! Black people are not “out of place” on college campuses. Also looking “out of place” is not a crime.

There will be an 8-justice, divided court as of 7/31/18. They court won’t add potentially big cases until it’s sure it won’t deadlock on them. Kennedy’s retirement is not bringing  he #SCOTUS to a halt, but it’s certainly slowing it down. https://t.co/gyVmYjk4br
@ahrferrier I agree that ought not be the case. But rulings speak for themselves.
We should’ve seen this coming. This term Kennedy gave strong clues that he is fine leaving the court in the hands of the staunchest conservatives of his party. #SCOTUS https://t.co/nfPHvA3QME

Everything said about Senate midterm races just got thrown out the window today. It's now a new ballgame. Dems will throw McConnell's words back to him: Let the voters decide. And Trump and GOP will put the SCOTUS ahead of even immigration on the stump.
Stevens (and I believe Souter) said their retirements would become effective when a replacement was confirmed. Kennedy gave a date: 7/31/18. https://t.co/GfMZIwmIyr
@barryfriedman1 I believe Souter and I know Stevens said retirement would be effective upon a replacement being confirmed. Kennedy gave a date: July 31.
Remarkable that Kennedy will step down before a replacement is in place.  #SCOTUS
Big caveat on DC Cir Judge Brett Kavanaugh, reportedly a front-runner to replace Kennedy: he worked for independent counsel Ken Starr and helped write the Starr Report. Trump, facing his own special counsel probe, must know  that would be a BIG focus of Kavanaugh media coverage.

#SCOTUS ruling is a major blow to public sector unions’ political power, starving their coffers of cash and reducing their bargaining power.
The 5-4 decision (the court had deadlocked before Justice Gorsuch’s appointment) reasoned that such agency fees amount to compelled speech by workers who may not agree with the union’s views.
As expected, U.S. Supreme Court rules that public union non-members cannot be compelled to pay “agency fees” because it violates their 1st Amendment rights. https://t.co/OB2ea6O0To

RT @joshgerstein: CJ Roberts announces last day of #SCOTUS opinions for this term will be tomorrow
Much more on the #SCOTUS ruling to come on https://t.co/ror7hfAnCp and at @BostonHerald.
Justice Sotomayor, in a much more pointed dissent joined by Justice Ginsburg, calls the order an unconstitutional Muslim ban that “masquerades behind a façade of national-security concerns.”
In dissent, Justice Breyer expresses concern that the waiver program is not being carried out per the text of the order, noting how few have been approved.
Short concurrence from Justice Kennedy is a message to Trump: Just because the court cannot throw out an order that falls within the president’s executive authority, it doesn’t mean the president should flout the “meaning” and “promise” of the Constitution. https://t.co/hbMlFdlTvu
Roberts points to, among other things, the removal of some Muslim-majority countries from the ban as well as various exceptions and available waivers that potential Muslim entrants can use to support the opinion that the order does not unconstitutionally target Muslims.
“The President lawfully exercised that discretion based on his findings—following a worldwide, multi-agency review—that entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the national interest.” -Chief Justice Roberts

This Supreme Court ruling is a victory for privacy advocates - holds that there was an expectation of privacy in the information cell phone collect about your location and movements.
Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan - quite the lineup!

Narrowness and broadness refer to the reach of the ruling, not the vote of the justices. The court ruled 5-4 that there is an individual right to bear arms (broad). The court today ruled 7-2 that the facts in a particular case case led to a specific result (narrow).
Twitter always reveals something. Today it revealed how many folks have no idea what a “narrow” court ruling is. You can have an unanimous narrow court ruling. And you can have a 5-4 ruling that is broad and sweeping.   #themoreyouknow #everybodycalmdown
#SCOTUS 👀 https://t.co/7I2BbsUnU4
Still, hard to imagine that this ruling won’t still spur a flurry of religious rights/free expression challenges to these anti-discrimination laws.
Seems Kennedy tried to keep the ruling somewhat narrow, relying on the record that in THIS case there were “official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners’ comments”  - suggesting that absent this evidence the result could be different.
Court held that commission enforcing Colorado’s anti-discrimination law “violated the State’s duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.”
Worth noting that while Kennedy wrote the opinion, he was NOT the swing vote - it was 7-2. Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented. https://t.co/5hs30PpZJq

.@realDonaldTrump announcing the US is pulling out of #Irandeal: “It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and and rotten structure of the current deal agreement. The Iran deal is defective at its core.”
In a nutshell, @realDonaldTrump isn’t arguing that #Iran violated the nuke deal, he’s saying it was just a bad deal to begin with. This matters I terms of whether the US will be seen as violating the terms by pulling out.

Folks trying to predict what Justice Kennedy will do always give me the LOLz... #SCOTUS https://t.co/UIK26CIR3f
The #SCOTUS has released the audio of today’s #travelban argument. Come for the procedural question and statutory construction, stay for the constitutional analysis... https://t.co/HjibdRzOOO
“The ideal thing would be for President Trump to come to Fall River and see who we are and what we do,” Santos said of workers whose jobs will be sent to Mexico. “We need to put pressure on the government to help us keep jobs in America.” https://t.co/WRqTsaxaPN
Justice Kennedy, never one to show his hand, asked questions from both sides but didn’t indicate which way his swing vote in the case will go.
Others, like Justice Sotomayor, said Trump’s statement’s gives the court rise to “look behind” the order’s text to determine the president’s intent.
Some, like Justice Alito, said there was no evidence of anti-Muslim animus in the text of the #travelban order.
#SCOTUS justices seem divided in lively travel ban case argument, which could likely turn on the @realDonaldTrump’s tweets and campaign statements about banning Muslims.
The line for today’s #SCOTUS argument on @realDonaldTrump’s travel ban started forming over the weekend. Biggest argument day of the year. https://t.co/W08yFdgVxN

@dbernstein @BostonMagazine It’s not just those listed. The Globe is repeatedly cited as if it were the Bible (perhaps because the @BostonHerald is too busy holding people accountable to write gushing profiles.) That this piece reads like the Herald doesn’t even exist speaks volumes about the point of view.
Maybe also place it where I don’t accidentally “like” 100 tweets just by scrolling the feed? https://t.co/QeiQrriRCF
@dbernstein @BostonMagazine So let me understand: in a major metropolis covered by two daily newspapers, only your favorite one wields influence according to you?
