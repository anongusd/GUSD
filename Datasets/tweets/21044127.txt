@tweetpresident @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Since the problem on the border has been ongoing for decades, including 2 years under Trump, and he has been delaying declaring one, they might not feel the emergency. Besides, Roberts hates to get involved in political stuff.
@Lilyflowerbug @realDonaldTrump Yes and it was disappointing.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump I give Trump a 25% chance of succeeding in the courts with an emergency order. There is at best a 50% chance the court will even take the case before the 2020 elections. DACA was started August 15, 2012. SCOTUS STILL hasn't ruled on it and won't this year.
@realDonaldTrump #BuildTheWall or don't run.
To take the case, 4 Justices have to want it. That means 3, or less, actually want to rule on DACA now. Roberts is likely one of the delayers. Who is the other weasel?
If SCOTUS had put the case on the docket, Democrats would likely have been nervous enough to actually negotiate. Ironically, SCOTUS delay and desire for a political outcome is making one less likely.
SCOTUS is hoping to punt until there is a political settlement. With the liberal 9th Circus Court keeping DACA in place, the Dreamers are safe. Of course, Democrats know that. Hence, the DemonRats have no incentive to negotiate in good faith over the wall or Dreamer status.
#SCOTUS deserves some of the blame for the shutdown mess by their refusal to take #DACA. The Supremes don't want the case because they know it's unconstitutional and they would have to end it. Then, the so-called Dreamers would be exposed to deportation.

@politictrends @realDonaldTrump You may be the only one in the country who thinks that can be done without a constitutional amendment.
@politictrends @realDonaldTrump A. This has nothing to do with the wall. B. SCOTUS has passed on DACA for this term and even if they take it later in the year, a ruling won't be issued until 2020. The court ruing keeping DACA in place stands for now. Nothing in what you posted changes that.
@politictrends @realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter what I read. I am not a liberal judge in Hawaii. They don't care what the Constitution says or DACA would be toast already. They ruled Trump can't undo a previous EO that was clearly unconstitutional. SCOTUS is avoiding the case.
@politictrends @realDonaldTrump Who can't? Liberal judges can't block Trump's emergency order? Since when did the law and Constitution stop them from doing anything that supports their politics?
@politictrends @realDonaldTrump Democrats in black robes will block any emergency order until after the 2020 election. If you don't realize that, you haven't been paying attention. Don't count on the Roberts' SCOTUS to bail Trump out. Remember #Obamacare? SCOTUS didn't even take up DACA this term.

@JoshRob08020881 @POTUS The recession ended 5 months after Obama took office and it had nothing to do with Obama, his budget wasn't even in effect and the so-called stimulus money was unspent.
@JoshRob08020881 Bush signed TARP into law. I personally have mixed feelings about it, but giving Obama credit for it is denying factual history. The economy should have recovered a lot quicker, but Obama's regulations and tax policy stifled it. That's a fact too. https://t.co/HGf9PgsCER
@JoshRob08020881 The Syrian civil war start and rise of isis was under Obama, plus the lybian disaster.

@JoshRob08020881 If Obama caused the economic growth, how has Trump put it on steroids by doing the opposite of what Obama did? The recession officially ended in June 2009, before any Obama programs could be implemented. Then he oversaw the worst recovery economic since the great recession.
