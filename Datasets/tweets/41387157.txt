Thanks for joining us today, folks. Tiger still leading?
I asked Rand after if he will wait until Sept. 18  to transfer $250K. "We'll transfer it when it's ready."
Kentucky will have a presidential caucus next year, assuming Paul transfers $250K to RPK account by Sept. 18.
Caucus approved with 111 votes. Needed 98 votes in favor.
Voting has closed. Count 'em up
Rand is now casting his vote. Wonder which way he'll go
Motion to close debate on caucus passes overwhelmingly. Time to vote.
Everybody and their brother rising to speak in favor of caucus. But it's still a secret ballot requiring 2/3 in favor.
Interesting nugget: Because of rules change adopted earlier, Rand is now a voting member of the committee.
Terry Carmack, McConnell's state director, rises to remind committee voters that McConnell has endorsed Rand for prez and caucus.
The actual caucus question will be secret ballot.
Former RNC chair Mike Duncan moves to hold a caucus if certified check for $250K is in the bank by Sept. 18. If not, back to primary.
Reminds me of KYA when I was a kid -- two people offering amendments and everybody else eager for the dance to start.
Committee has to give up this hotel ballroom in an hour and a half. Debate over caucus hasn't started yet.
Rand and aide Doug Stafford just left the room while party rules on loyalty are being debated.

Things are heating up now that the topic has moved to Kynect. Bevin calls Conway charge "inappropriate... unprofessional."
Bevin accuses Conway of "cowardice" on tort reform. Says oof Conway's time as pvt sector attorney "that's not a real career."
Conway on Kynect: "Here we are as a shining example of a state that's doing it right."

Also guessing that Bevin is the first in the history of Ky. Farm Bureau to quote Groucho Marx and Margaret Thatcher in same response.
@ElRylando Good point. Bevin rivals Biden for use of "literally."
If you took a drink when Conway says "folks" or Bevin says "frankly," you'd be Keith Richards by now.

Comer spox says the commissioner is vacationing in Fla. and will make a statement tomorrow afternoon
Asked abt Conway, Grimes says today is abt "protecting the sanctity of the ballot box, a phrase I know you guys have heard me say before."
Grimes said she spoke with Bevin and Comer but did not discuss possible recount. Deadline to file petition to court is tomorrow
Grimes says when vote is certified on June 8, she believes Bevin will be the GOP nominee
Grimes: Recanvass shows no substantial changes
Grimes press conf underway. Form from Madison Co still out but she doesn't believe it will change outcome
Grimes waiting on forms from Knott and Madison Co. Will then call candidates before press conf
Press has gathered for Grimes 2:30 press conf to discuss recanvass results
Recanvass wrapping up in Fayette. No change in result
Recanvass is a pretty sedate affair. No Brooks Brothers riots. Yet.
In addition to clerk, staff and board of elections, there are three reporters and reps from Comer and Bevin camps observing recanvass
Clerk is doing recanvass of ag commissioner race at the same time as guv
Clerk is also counting five absentee votes, kept out to protect identity of one military voter involved in suit. Three votes for Heiner

Statement from McConnell aide: "Once it's official, Senator McConnell plans to endorse the GOP nominee."
@WKYT Thanks for having me. Really enjoyed that.
Glenn Beck says Kentucky is "no longer dead" to him. Unless Comer wins recanvass. Then "double dead."
While cautioning that anything can happen, Conway camp says it is moving ahead under assumption Bevin is the nominee
I'm calling it... a night. Thanks to those who followed along. What a blast.
From Estep, Comer said Bevin "was the beneficiary of a lot of this mischief that took place in the last two weeks of the campaign."
According to SOS's office, statewide turnout was 12.6 percent.
Per the HL's Bill Estep, Comer will formally ask for recanvass Wed morning.
What a night. Or as Matt Bevin accurately put it: "What a race!"
Bevin tells supporters AP has called race for him. They have not.
Bevin: "How about this race?! Really." Takes obligatory shot at the media then apologizes if we're missing deadline.
Comer: "Whoever is the winner when this recanvass is finished, I can make you one promise: we're gonna elect a Republican governor in Nov."
Comer: "But it's so close and so many people have worked so hard."
Comer called Bevin, said if recanvass "doesn't work out," he'll campaign door to door with Bevin.
Comer: "I owe it to our supporters to ask for a recanvass in this election."
Comer speaking now
AP says race is too close to call. According to HL's Jack Brammer, Bevin speaking at 10:05.
In a race this close at this time of night, I start quoting Lloyd Bridges from "Airplane" like it's my second job.
Race is still a stand-off between two candidates. Oddly, neither of them is the one that spent $5M of his own money.
Getting in on the fun, KDP emails "Brutal GOP primary continues"
AP reporting 99.7 percent and Bevin leading by 83 votes
No automatic recanvass trigger in Kentucky. Candidate can make a written request to SOS's office. Recanvass would be 9 am 5/28
Fun night to be a political junkie in Kentucky. Probably not as much fun for Bevin and Comer.
If "hold the phone" wasn't already an expression, we might've needed to invent it tonight for Heiner and Will T.
Right now, both Comer and Bevin wishing they had spent more time in Ohio and Ballard Counties.
This is nuts. Two counties outstanding and a 30 vote difference between Bevin and Comer.
We're still not ready to call this race
Will T. Scott says he had a "great time" running for guv. A lot of people say that, but I actually believe him.

My call to the FEC took about five minutes. C'mon, folks.
FEC needed a candidate number to tie to PAC. Since Rand had no candidate ID number, FEC created one. Everybody good and confused?
Per the FEC, they created the ID number for Rand because a super PAC in '13 said they supported him for prez.
No, Rand Paul has not filed with the FEC. And that's according to the FEC.

Caucus approved unanimously by voice vote. Meeting and discussion beforehand took about two hours
Executive session over. Former RNC chair Mike Duncan makes a motion to approve a caucus
@mpoindc You must've dug deep. Feels like a hundred years ago
So debate, arguments for and against a caucus and Rand's remarks to committee are now happening behind closed doors.
Rand's state director moves to go to executive session, meaning press gets kicked out while caucus is debated
Guthrie makes the case that caucus would be good for state, party, not all that different process to select delegates
US Rep Guthrie says caucus a lot of work -- cites Kansas turnout numbers -- but says "it's worth the work."

Ugh. Man of Steel. Ain't Superman without the music. Guess the closest thing I'm seeing this weekend is Julius Randle.
@BenHoltsclaw Almost just turned it off. First time they show him as Superman they don't play the freakin Superman music. Heresy.
@ConservaTerry I don't know the comic books. Was he? Part I'm struggling with most is Superman wearing a Kansas t-shirt.

There are already a few things I want the Cats to punish Robert Morris for tomorrow. Can we add losing in football to Vandy to the list?

McConnell centered remarks on potus and American exceptionalism. At presser, declined Q on immigration in favor of "Obamacare" questions.
As McConnell comes in, "Only in America" playing. One reference to "men to match my mountains," and I'll know this is all a dream.
"Where the Stars and Stripes... And the Eagles fly." Sen. McConnell's vets event keeps my streak of hearing that song on the trail intact.
"I don't have anything against Matt Bevin. I think he's a good, honest, Christian man." @SenRandPaul just now in Louisville.

@ojsutton @TWC Worst customer service ever. And I lived in DC for almost 10 years! Gonna walk up to Rupp, try to work some illegal magic.
McConnell's media blitz continues. Will be on Face the Nation this Sunday.
Thanks @twc for telling me you'd be here between noon and 5 today. Then changing it last minute to Saturday. This is how capitalism dies.

The sample PPP used was 53% D, 37% R and 11% I.

Bottom line: Beating McConnell is a win. But Katzenberg did Grimes no favors by saying he raised $1M for her.
I just had to pick a point on the horizon to focus on. Endless spin from both sides was making me dizzy.
Two notes: Yes, Warren was already a star. And two, in her first quarter in '11 (not '12), she put up $3.1M.
Grimes' numbers &gt; McConnell's but far short of Elizabeth Warren's $6.9M Q1 in '12. Same fundraising chief for both campaigns.
Grimes avg contribution $25. Donations from all 120 counties and all 50 states per campaign.
@jonward11 more than McConnell and more than Michelle Nunn in Georgia
Grimes raised $2.5M in her first quarter. Has $2M COH.

@CharlyNorton I'm confused. Back room with Biden and Reid?
Aides froze as Biden entered. "Afternoon, Mitch." "Where you been hidin', Joe?" Biden: "You ready to play?" McConnell: "Let's dance."
Man, I love the Biden fan fiction. Didn't even get to the leather case full of cassettes in the trans-am. But I'm on deadline. More soon
Removing the dagger earring from his right ear and sliding on his Oakleys, Biden turned to his wife: "Time to save the day, mama."
Obama asked, "How fast can you get here?" Biden, exhaled a long puff of smoke. "It takes two hours. I'll be there in one."
When the phone rang at Camp David, Biden turned down the blaring Whitesnake, took a long drag on his Winston and answered, "Time to close?"

"We're gonna sign that guy up, and then we'll tell him." Beshear on man who said he hates Obamacare but loves ACA.
"I think it's gonna start to boomerang on these folks that are out there yelling and screaming right now." Beshear
"Do you worry this will be a liability in the Senate race in 2014 in Kentucky?" Brownstein to Beshear
Audience questions start. Some applause here at first questioner's suggestion Beshear run for national office.
"Many of the Republicans in our state are... coming to realization that these real right-wing wingnuts are not the majority of their party."
"These folks up here act like a bunch of 9-year olds in a foodfight in a cafeteria," Beshear on DC
"I think in the long haul every state's gonna do this because their people are gonna demand it." Beshear
"It's something that's intangible, but it's something that's damn meaningful to most people." Beshear on quality of life with insurance
"I can't wait to compete with some of these states that aren't doing this." Beshear
"Over the course of a generation, this will make a huge difference in Kentucky," Beshear.
"Is this gonna mean waiting lists in Louisville?" Brownstein to Beshear. No, guv says, 'cause all 620K won't happen at once.
Beshear pushes back on UPS/spouse story. Says it's only at managerial level.

@PeruvianSkies4 Worth noting those were House Speaker John Boehner's exact words as well.
Beshear says Kentucky "one of the last few places where democracy still works in the United States." Says he and GOP work "like adults."
Beshear on website going live 12:01 Tuesday morning. "That thing lit up and it's stayed lit up ever since."
Beshear says folks who say ACA rollout will be a trainwreck "are on the wrong train."
Ron Brownstein takes over with questions. He's an all-star.
Beshear closes with line from NYT op-ed. "Get over it, and get out of the way so I can help my people." Polite applause at close.
"It is the law of the land." Beshear on ACA.
"As for the naysayers, I'm personally offended by their partisan gamesmanship." Beshear
"Has been overloaded ever since." Beshear on kynect website since it launched Tuesday.
Beshear says critics say healthcare law "will never work." Says facts show different. Namechecks Romney's Mass. plan. In Ky. "it's working."
"They said, 'Governor, you can't afford not to do this." Beshear on outside analysis of ACA implementation.
"To me, it was morally the right thing to do," Beshear on Medicaid expansion. Also said he had to consider if it was affordable.
RT @adeleshiv: @samyoungman I went on there.. $1216 per month + $8000 deductible + $12700 out of pocket.. for 2 of us.. Guess it's a deal
"These people aren't some group of aliens from a distant planet. We know these people. They are our friends and neighbors." Beshear
"We are literally going to change the course of Kentucky's history through the Affordable Care Act." Beshear
Beshear: "There is a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and governors."
Beshear says Kentucky is "leading the charge" in implementing Affordable Care Act.
"I know what you're thinking. Kentucky? A Red state?" Beshear
Beshear will talk about "how and why Kentucky both proudly and aggressively is leading the nation in implementing the Affordable Care Act."
Last joke drew a couple groans from the crowd.
"Got a great crowd here today. I assume most of you work for the federal government, and I assume you needed something to do," Beshear
The guv will deliver remarks then the legendary Ron Brownstein will interview him.

Meet Sam Youngman, the Herald-Leader’s new political reporter http://t.co/nvARR6rdld
Thrilled for my first day with the @heraldleader. Let's get to it!
@NextCats Thank you, sir. I'm eager to get started.
My first take on Rand Paul for the @thedailybeast on the eve of my start with the @heraldleader. http://t.co/FO2NEUs5hT
RT @BGPolitics: Incoming @heraldleader political reporter @samyoungman analyzes @SenRandPaul's presidential path for @thedailybeast http://…
@JohnStamper @heraldleader Thanks, boss. Folks, this is the man to holler at when you're my mad at me. Say hello to my new editor.
RT @JohnStamper: @samyoungman And I plan to sleep soundly tonight knowing you start for the @heraldleader tomorrow. Welcome aboard.
@lisagabbott That's good advice. Thank you. Of course all 308K eligible won't be calling Tues and call center is adding people.
Sleep won't come easy tonight. I'm way too excited to be starting with the @heraldleader tomorrow.
Made me chuckle. On Tues, 308K people can sign up for Ky's healthcare. Call center has 60 people. Sounds like Comcast http://t.co/a0JZEK63Mp
We just gotta be patient, Big Blue Nation. We can't go around breaking lamps that I didn't like anyway.
Hate when the fans leave early 'cause we're losing. But I hate it so much more when our offensive line does it.
It sure ain't pretty, but I'm seeing a lot to like from the Cats tonight. UK fball fan for 30+ years. I have to think like that.
Bluegrass folks, holler about any political ads you're seeing during the game. Unless the Cats are winning. 'Cause I sure wont be tweeting.
"You may leave Kentucky, but Kentucky never leaves you," Tubby Smith, inducted last night Kentucky Athletics HOF. Well said, coach.
Go Cats! Let's eat some gator tail!
Apparently was also political sleep talking: "Did I drive Matt Bevin's car here?" "Did the campaign people leave? I just saw Susan."
In a campaign first, fell asleep typing on phone then sent three nonsense texts. Can that happen? "It's not them. Cops told then finish"
@OKnox @lizzieohreally @samyoungman @RDKeil1 also, less hot. Sorry, DC
Ahhhh. 11:53 pm, full pack of Newports, tonight's performers Mötley Crüe, sweet tea and open the laptop. On deadline. I missed this.
@eyokley @davecatanese @GovernorOMalley He's absolutely right. This is 1996, right?
Running around DC, keep getting smacked with nostalgia, a little sadness to be moving. Then I look at my twitter feed, and I'm all good.
@theycallmetater I've come to think of my golf clubs as my spouse. They were very supportive of the move.
If I wasn't already moving to Lex Vegas, I'd be looking for a country that doesn't have words for "debt" or "ceiling."
I worked with @joshrogin for about a week in '06. Come by my place for your Free Dan Nainan! t-shirts. I kid because I care, old friend.
Ran into that Perryville Ky. fifth grade class not long after bumping into Ron Kaufman. Symmetry, y'all.
"See you in Kentucky," -- Fifth Grade class from Perryville, Ky. to me getting off the metro just now at Pentagon City. Folks, I'm excited.
Southern hospitality. Grateful to @repandybarr and staff for letting me swing by for a drink @Ale8One http://t.co/D67wcijUW1
#ff @BrammerJack a Ky. institution and @heraldleader Frankfort bureau chief. Only discernible character flaw: Louisville Cards fan.
Overwhelmed by the response yesterday. Sweetest words to hear are "welcome home." Welcome new followers, especially those in the Bluegrass.
Endlessly and gratefully reminded of two things today: 1. Got better friends than I deserve. 2. I am blessed to be a Kentuckian.
I'm deeply touched by all your kind words. Will be even more so three weeks from now when my mom retweets the announcement.
Overwhelmed by all the kind words. Be sure to follow @BGPolitics and check us out at http://t.co/MbhVMx0nZ9 and http://t.co/ANu4s0cEF4
And folks, it ain't just the hottest Senate race in the country. My apologies in advance, @UKCoachCalipari. This will get awkward.
Y'all humble me. Great political stories popping in the Bluegrass. Hope y'all will join me and the good folks at the H-L for the ride.
Folks, I'm thrilled to tell y'all that I'm joining the Lexington Herald-Leader as politics reporter.
Feels bizarre to be so proud of the Cats after a loss to Louisville. Keep your heads up, Big Blue Nation.
@Drury_11 Ha! Zing!
@Drury_11 So the Tea Party has shown more offense than UK this game.
@Drury_11 Thank you.
@jlh1000 Thank you.
Help me out, Kentucky folks. Y'all seeing any political ads during this game?
Sam trivia: I applied the '98 plaque to the Governor's Cup. Summer job at a trophy store in Lexington.
@KSLbbruce I've yelled "hell yeah, defense!" more times this morning than the rest of my life combined.
I'm already proud as hell of the effort I'm seeing from Kentucky. Especially on defense. That felt weird to type.
Friday news dump: I ate a snickers and smoked two Newports for breakfast.
@ron_fournier I don't hate writing. Writing makes me hate myself.
Rand is reading Mother Jones, and Grimes is writing for HuffPo. Yo @StewSays, when does Sen. McConnell's column in The Nation start?
Lord, this week saw Crossfire relaunch and Putin hailed as peacemaker. Evil can't sweep the week. Kentucky beats Louisville tomorrow, ok?
@BolivianCat So before you read it, you weren't an undecided?
@BolivianCat End of the quarter is coming up. It's a fundraising letter.
If you wrote or said "Russia offers a way out," you were robbed of a co-byline on Putin's op-ed.
I can't listen to pundits on Russia, so help me out. Was Putin's op-ed over the top enough to remind them who we're talking about?
Alison Grimes appears to be a HuffPo fan. Taking her argument directly to Kentucky voters I see.
Long list of folks who helped Putin the Peacemaker craft this absurd narrative. Flaming bag he left in NYT should remind folks who he is.
"We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law," Putin in the NYT. Uh-huh. And Drago didn't use steroids.
@ThirdWayMattB @MarkHalperin Now you're on the trolley.
Focus on the heroes and the fallen. But if you must think of OBL, remember we couldn't be broken. He failed long before he was fish food.
@adambodily Thought about that. Too many folks here thrive on the division I'd like to see erased. Still, good day to reach across the aisle
To my friends outside the beltway: this is a good day to not hate your neighbor because he or she votes differently than you.
Only noise in my college apartment that morning was tv, interrupted by the sound of my roommate opening a beer. Funny what we remember.
@ron_fournier at WKU, sleeping through class natch when a friend called. Watched until they fell then walked to the newsroom #wherewereyou
RT @sdaglas: @samyoungman Or as many Democrats on the same foreign policy page as George Bush. Weird, indeed.

Struck by potus assertion near the top that he has authority to strike without congressional approval
RT @steveholland1: In his speech, Obama will express skepticism about the Russian offer on Syria but vow to see if it is for real, we're to…
@fakegimel I can't say that for sure either. But I have a hard time believing Russia. Unlike some folks, I remember Matt and Jed's daddy.
@fakegimel I'm far from convinced they actually want to deal.
I'm having a fantastic day. Sold a dozen bridges to the folks who thought Russia was saving the day.
Nothing quite as mindblowing or nauseating than watching conventional wisdom become conventional wisdom
@jmoi002 Thanks, boss. Not sure I qualify on either count though.
I continue to fear that not enough Americans had their worldview shaped as I did by Red Dawn and Rocky IV.
So Russia indicating they want this done without the UN. Anybody want their statements back?
We're all talking about the same Russia, right?
Really?! I get a warning to watch Family Guy, but not a peep before an animated reenactment of RGIII's knee surgery.
Ah. And now that I see Howard Kurtz, I am no longer watching a replay of Fox News Sunday. Only in DC...
Watching a replay of Fox News Sunday. Was struck by Rand's suggestion Russia might come around at the UN and join the US. Huh.
Been a weird couple days in Kentucky and Indiana. Folks wanna talk Syria and football, but ain't nobody mentioned Halperin's beard.
@jmoi002 I imagine that can be arranged but probably not until basketball season. Wouldn't wanna waste it.
I'll say it until I'm blue in the face, Illinois: the man was from Kentucky http://t.co/ShDTymSnja
@chucktodd @AdamHasner @MajorCBS Don't hate on the media. We're just waiting until Assad texts a picture of his genitals to someone.
It took some doing, but I finally found some Syria news. It was posted in the comments section of a Miley Cyrus story.
Friday news dump: I thought Battleship was a cool movie.
Happy 7th birthday to my nephew Kaden. When he was 5, he told me: "I wouldn't take a meeting with Joe Biden. I'd meet with MCain though."
Medical marijuana for kids? Dave Junior's not here, man.
Late to the NYT being down. I would've joked: Sorry, folks. Paper's closed. Moose out front should've told ya.
Well done @HRBlock. You lost me as a customer today.
First one of these I've seen http://t.co/P5VN5LF9hx
Didn't realize until this weekend how much I blame Jim Furyk for last year's Ryder Cup debacle. Not fair really, but go Duf.
White House press was allowed to watch potus three-putt today, putting my morning round of bogeys in delightful perspective. #3puttpotus
Friday news dump: When I eat popcorn alone, one of four kernels makes it inside my mouth on the first try.
NSA stuff has worried me. Now that I know Congress and the WH will fix it, I'm absolutely terrified.
"I am confident that in the end common sense will prevail." -- potus, speaking on what must be his first day in Washington.
Potus would defend @edhenryTV? How many pinnochios are possible?
Congrats to the adorable Hudson "Was supposed to be named Sam" Lee on his first presidential shout-out
I don't do compliments, but what a remarkable difference it makes when potus shows up for a presser with a message and agenda.
Anybody else now thinking that maybe "Mister" Yellen aint the next Fed chair?
Thought for a moment potus was slipping into closing Rocky IV speech. Then I remembered he don't use the word change no more.
How dare folks have "not fully informed" opinions about programs they were never supposed to know about?
No such thing as too many questions about domestic spying
Covering Trump in Iowa? May God have mercy on your soul
"There is no spying on Americans. We don't have a domestic spying program." Whatevs. Tell me more about cable news time slots!!!
With Congress and the president out of Washington this month, seems like a good time for America to sneak in and change the locks.
I don't know Julia Ioffe, but consider me a fan.
This Russia stuff worries me. If you're under 25, please watch the original Red Dawn and Rocky IV. Do it for your country.
Friday news dump: I saw Steel Magnolias in the theater with my mom. I cried like a baby.
'Cause folks been asking: I've never seen the newsroom, but no, no the Romney stuff ain't accurate.
@reidepstein @Rick_Gorka @ZekeJMiller I'm with Gorka. Stands out to me as a nasty stretch. So much Dan Rutherford.
Hunter Mahan (-13) quit golf tourney he was winning when wife went into labor. My reaction makes clear I still ain't ready for fatherhood.

My love of public courses was tested this am. Studying last two greens, had to factor in a pile of feces and tire tracks. So much cussing

Bummed to hear the Nashville City Paper closed shop. They were a fun bunch when I was there a hundred years ago.
Gotta believe if people didn't hate the media so damn much, Obama's despicable dealings with the press would grotesquely scar his legacy
Good morning, strange July weather. You seem like a golf fan. Is that true? I'd hate to learn you get your jollies from raining on folks.
Because it's nobody's damn business how many times I've seen the movie Pitch Perfect!
@StewSays I see your senate resolution. Looks all red and black to me. Go Cats
@StewSays So Oaks over Cats?
I don't make a habit of giving advice to candidates/presidents, but an exception since Pitino's at the WH: Mr. President, wash your hands.
Missing from pool report abt Pitino and Co.'s White House visit: Secret Service armed to the teeth with Purell and penicillin.
So it's like that... Sens. Paul and McConnell show up at the White House to honor the Cards. No-shows for '12 Cats.
And Tiger's major drought during the Obama administration continues.
T Party: Tiger has not won a major during the Obama administration. Last major win was '08 US Open, summer before Obama elected.
Friday news dump: @MajorCBS is only 16.
The Daily Caller did what? Gee, I sure hope @PressSec was able to protect the integrity and importance of the daily briefing.
C'mon Washington Monument repairs. I prefer giggling at its phallic design (I'm 36) to the chills from seeing it caged in metal and metaphor
@edhenryTV Warn your favorite Italian restaurants or step outside for 15 seconds
@edhenryTV I'll spare you the details, but it would only take 15 seconds and nobody could eat on that table again.
Important note to White House staff: Keep Pitino out of the cafeteria. Just trust me.
Will McConnell show to watch Obama honor the Cards? He didn't show for the '12 Wildcats
If the Brits would ever dare to try and burn the White House again... I suggest 7/23 when the Louisville Cards are there
Friend of mine texted to ask if I saw the Romney stuff on The Newsroom. We're obviously not close friends.
Jenny McCarthy on The View surprises me. Had she been given a show on cable news, I wouldn't have batted an eye.
Mr. Cabbie: Believe Obama is Kenyan, a socialist, the devil. Believe what you want in America. But moms are off limits. Yeah, bro, even his.
@99YankeeSierra Dude, no. Not seriously. As far as I know, Gallatin didn't host orgies during Treaty of Ghent. Henry Clay was the stud.
@99YankeeSierra @chucktodd Dude, Albert Gallatin's descendants still aren't allowed in Belgium after he went all Caligula in Ghent.
Damn. Seems11th article was added not long ago requiring Americans to care about royal babies if Gwyneth Paltrow starts acting British
I have a good reason for being late to the royals' news. Studying 1783 Treaty of Paris for assurance I don't have to care about royal babies
Internet, don't let me down. How many times has Ted told his kids he had sex with Aunt Robin? How many I-love-yous? It's bothering me.
@SavannahGuthrie Maybe first time I've said or typed the words "happy anniversary." How am I single?
Congrats @SavannahGuthrie on your anniversary
Doing research came across Bachmann quote on Perry after oops: "We all felt very bad for him."
America, we gotta help NYC. Send whatever politicians you can spare to help with the shortage. They only have Spitzers and Weiners left.
Happy bday to President Bush. And y'all make sure to watch Captain America @MajorCBS host Face the Nation tomorrow.
Might lose some animal lovers over that one. I didn't eat a dolphin. Though I did make fun of it and give it a wedgie. Blame Pierce Brosnan
@jnanberg That's what blew me away. Just got home, studying. Way north for a school of dolphins. Usually just rays
Six years on Chesapeake Bay, countless hours in our secret anchorage spot and never seen dolphins until today. Dozens. Taste like chicken.
Was already having a great day. And hello, last 20 minutes of Rocky IV. God bless America. Remember, if he can change...

You'd think from my twitter feed Kerry was on a boat called Monkey Business
Kerry handling this boat stuff so well I have to believe he's running in '16.
@jmoi002 Just one of those rounds. Swing feels fine, short iron aim off, brain in the way. Still, a beautiful morning out there.
@jaketapper We'll just make this my holiday Friday news dump: rent That's My Boy
Nope, nope, nope. Hope you burn this joint down, @MarkLeibovich, but man I can't read another word about Kurt Bardella.
Sick as a dawg all week. No knowledge of current events, 78 new problems with How I Met Your Mother and, worse, golf swing still quite ill
Happy Fourth, my fellow sexy Americans. Listening to patriotic songs, don't slip on b-sides, second or third verses (h/t mitt)
@janetdubay Thank you. There's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with more childish giggling.
If you don't recall the awkward scene of elephants having sex in front of 43 and Mrs. Bush, last tweet must seem like my weirdest ever.
Definitions of success vary with presidential foreign trips. Except Africa. No elephant sex in front of First Family, trip's a bust.
@AJRiceDC Heck yeah. He'll do y'all proud
@leeconrad03 Nice. But I think Excitable Boy fits Hernandez a little better
Bilas completely redeemed himself by noting that Solomon Hill went to same high school as Warren Zevon
Somebody please pick Archie so I can stop watching the D-league draft
Things I don't know about Shabazz: 1. His age. 2. Who he's playing for. 3.  What the hell he was doing on stage just now.
Boring 2nd round + already used Eddie Murphy in the 80s joke = Bill Simmons making a joke that gets him in trouble at some pt tonight
@davemeddows Giving you a hard time. Back in the late '90s, Utes gave me a lot of heartburn.
Did Jalen just say Wiggins committed to Canada?
@fakegimel Bilas also said he doesn't care how old Shabazz really is. He's officially ready to be an NBA GM.

Can Shabazz play for Utah and still pitch in the Little League World Series?
Can't change the channel. Don't wanna miss it if I'm picked in the second round. We're nearing Motorboat Jones territory.
RT @ACCSports: Remember that time Kelly Olynnyk trashed Forrest Whitaker's Trans-Am?
Most of these fellas would be wise to treat their rookie contracts as the last check they'll ever get. Skipped the 1st rd; went right to 2nd
@tomfitzgerald @karentravers all that's missing is for Nerlens to shave a Santa hat in the back of his head
@karentravers I think y'all will love him, ya know, as much as y'all love anybody.
Prediction: Shabazz will be a very good NBA player -- every time his contract is about to expire.
@karentravers y'all already hatin on Nerlens? A record even for Philly, booing a dude before he even knows he plays there
Was it also a weak year in the Goofy-Whothehellisthat-Guaranteedbust-Darko European League?
Now seeing how GMs can be so dumb. Convinced myself in about two seconds Nerlens/AD was a good idea.
@erickmartin They'll both need some time, but I agree. A lot will depend on how/if Rivers grows.
@erickmartin I really don't know. Zero idea how Nerlens will develop, but AD grows offensively by the second.
"It's gonna be a shot-blockin party when I get down there." Nerlens. Love it.
Congrats, @NerlensNoel3. Big Blue towers down in the Big Easy.
No idea what kind of pro Nerlens will be, but this looks like silly anti-hype coming from a lot of non-doctors.
@davemeddows Big and tough... Right up until they play Kentucky. (Couldn't resist)
@Rowdyyates1 Yeah. Sarcasm. Couldn't you tell by my tone?
I do think @John_Wall will love playing with a guy with a work ethic like Otto's.
@Rowdyyates1 I'm usually joking. You'll have to be more specific.
Otto's a crowd-pleaser, and I can't fault the pick. But Nerlens would've been better.
@davemeddows Oh yeah. Those Utes stand out. I remember being scared of him when UK played them in the tourney.
Settle down, Victor. You just got drafted behind what I'm pretty sure is a made up person.
Anthony Bennett is a one-and-done. UNLV is ruining college basketball.
Might be a weak draft when your reaction to the No. 1 pick is "who?"
So Snowden is a flip-flopper. Boy, that'll kill him with his base. Espionage and intrigue given the Iowa/NH treatment. Love it.
Where would the scrambled jets go?
RT @ShawnaNBCNews: POTUS on capturing Snowden: "I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker." #boom
I get that I'm a weird dude, and not everyone wants to see potus's presser. But why spend so much money to go and not show it?
So, uh, grab torches, pitchforks, meet at CNN in an hour? Putting Newt on a new Crossfire way scarier than anything Doc Frankenstein's got

@davidplouffe So exactly five years ago you started the day with hope and change. Today you went with arson and Grand Theft Auto.
Btw, my hands are dirty too. "Yeah, Sam, write another story about twitter while 60K troops at war. Nailed it, buddy."
@arapaho415 Thank you. He and my sister are noble enough in their pursuits to almost offset the dumbness of mine.
Last note on Fix/Bruni checking their pulses: Every story a reporter writes about his/her job instead of a reader's, is asking for death.
@arapaho415 Very moving. My little brother is a police officer back home. And I'll tell ya, those K9s are cops and partners. Thx for sharing
@DylanByers WaPo reads NYT and fears death. Who started the panic? Bachmann. We ain't dying. But we sure as hell ain't livin' right.
I'm sure the country will get our back if we just keep telling them how bad they need us. I can tell you it ain't a good dating strategy.
Cillizza on Bruni claims noble purpose but says "true character" shown in gaffes, folks should be scared we might die. Want help?Be better.
Cillizza, a story on another reporter's piece about media, 7 faces of Carney. Are we making a case for voters to help reverse trend?
When journos fret about candidates end-runs around media, they're wasting time that should be spent earning trust back.
@ScottHogenson Don't care what interests them. I don't want IRS and DOJ hanging out in my kitchen. Plouffe or Carney vs Issa don't fix that
Only in dunceville would @PressSec be offered an option between victim or fighter. Same guy as when I was there, right?
News: Two people who are likely biters move on from peer pressure to fight. Actual news: They're the same person -- Fred Savage.
Also, who asked about '16 Clinton deal?
Uh, maybe WH press needs to seem less offended by Issa than Carney does. Especially as Jay is so honest with them.
@GOPfashionista Ed Klein. Same joke; different side of the aisle.
History of Biden super-soaker fight: First year happened spontaneously as Biden and kids played. Rahm killed three people.
Biden's water gun fight party canceled as potus, axe and team opt to just keep pissing on the press instead.
@DylanByers I did enjoy those. But small wonder the country can't distinguish between Issa, Carney and me.
@peterogburn @DylanByers Same thing I learn every single day in DC: We're idiots.
@DylanByers Or a very lost zebra
@DylanByers Well, if you're the ref...
@DylanByers By ending that last sentence without an adjective, you won the morning.
@DylanByers Obamacare I covered. It's the other stuff I'm learning to care a lot about. Major gets and heroes. Thanks for your time.
@DylanByers My man, ain't a thing about you makes sense. No worries though. Boom does better than sense around here.
@DylanByers And we're talking abt msnbc, which doesn't do the news thang, partnering with a news provider? Boom (my head exploding)
@DylanByers Naw, don't break focus.
@DylanByers What's the difference btwn boom and breaking?
@JohnJHarwood @GlennThrush @davidplouffe I'm sure that's it. Congress is broken, but excels at oversight. That it, David?
@JohnJHarwood @GlennThrush @davidplouffe Thought the WH had faith in Congress to conduct investigations negating need for independ counsel
@TheRickWilson C'mon. Issa becomes harder to attack if he spends less time on tv and more time on oversight. He makes it abt him, WH smiles
@CarlCannon @mattklewis Naw, this is candid: He boasted of not hiring journalists. That is a problem for a news channel if ppl want news.
@bbenenson So many levels of genius. Same guy that saved America by taking down Howard Kurtz and in five years will prob be a bureau chief
@bbenenson Has become art: accidental satire. Media critic puts his byline on press release and calls it breaking news.
@bbenenson You're welcome.
WH scandals, oversight chairman a two-bit huckster and a media critic reports(?) his pub hiring an editor is breaking news. On. Fire.
We've gone to ludicrous speed. Folo Game of Thrones tweet with outrage tweet at a media critic, then read the NYT's take on msnbc. Killin it
Beltway fever: Pretty sure my flak buddy really believed he could spin the rain away. Only explanation for our 12-second round.
@janetdubay Yes ma'am. Thank you. And thanks for the chat.
@janetdubay God bless ya. I'm gonna go play golf. There's plenty of humility out there.
@janetdubay And we'll end the sermon with this: God is in your liberal neighbor helping put out your house fire. She's way too classy for DC
@janetdubay And I'm certainly no preacher, but looking for Godly qualities in man, is sending a check to Swaggart to pass on to God.
@janetdubay But if you don't make them work for your loyalty, they got no incentive to get better? They work for you. Demand more, boss
@janetdubay So Jim Bakker will be better?;) God rewards faith. Con-artists prey on it. Sam's Guarantee: Faith in a politician don't end well
@janetdubay Ah, but I do have faith -- in Americans. Consider: faith in God is admirable. But faith in Jimmy Swaggart?
@leeconrad03 @jgohringer "Out of touch" are the good ol' days. At some point we went zero-gravity on acid.
@leeconrad03 @jgohringer Again, we made bad worse. NYT/Anderson Cooper are Dr. Frankenstein leading the mob. Who gave Bachmann the mic?
Lehane taught herpes everything it knows.
Time for my meds. Y'all have a good one. All except you, @davidaxelrod. Reflect. Ask yourself how much you'll sacrifice for bromance.
@jgohringer It's a lonely crowd thinking old-school media are capable of better. Very kind. Like women who marry guys on death row.
@jgohringer Also: Be better than the Bachmanns. She's a great circus clown. But a tiger ate the ringleader and is loose. What's your lede?
@jgohringer Cred comes from good work; not hours in the mirror. Think piece means nuthin if same paper calls @PressSec a "press warrior"
@jgohringer Between that Q and the fact you've read the column leads me to believe you're media too. Likely an editor.
I have zero idea how folks can look at Plouffe and Rove, and decide one is the good guy. I see matching overalls and mini-bikes
DC journos, break the cycle. Self-importance is an addiction. Bruni's column today is straight freaking heroin. Put it down. Back away.
@GlennThrush @davidaxelrod Maybe talking about the water cooler in the Oval.
Issa called @PressSec a paid liar, I see. Like watching a drunk pick a fight with mirror then later moanin that the other guy fought dirty.
@GlennThrush @davidaxelrod Axe might be right, but I fear he only knows this because that water-cooler is bugged.
So help me Good Lord, if this fine Sunday morning, a journalist asks Woodward to pronounce a scandal Watergate or not, we all sit in timeout
@janetdubay "He's so upset Johnny didn't get a promotion, he's stopped tweeting." We're weird people. Sunday show time --go back to sleep!
@janetdubay Funny to think about how you'd react to hearing that Mitt Romney was "despondent" over you or Some Dude not getting a job.
@janetdubay It's democracy Vegas-style. Every voter gets disappointed. For some, it's on Election Day. Others, late May. Casino always wins
@janetdubay Thanks! Unfollow me for a while? Noticed you weren't in home room.
Friday news dump: "For Love of the Game" gets me way more choked up than "Field of Dreams."
@MajorCBS @CoralMDavenport @bethreinhard @bfouhy @samsteinhp @JOSreports @jimtankersley @markknoller @markzbarabak Thanks, holmes
"[Marcus] was out buying doggy sunglasses for our dog, Boomer, while we were out visiting all of the many businesses." -- Bachmann 1/3/12
Sigh. I'm gonna miss jokes about doggy sunglasses.
Been out of town, ignoring phone, lifting free weights while glaring at pic of @PressSec. So a quick note of congrats to @AntDeRosa!
@PressSec what about pretty? Aren't we pretty?!
Most Americans prolly think @PressSec told his biggest whopper to date in saying press are good at their jobs and smart.
RT @RyanLizza: BREAKING: DOJ seized phone records associated with two White House lines and numerous Fox News phone numbers...		http://t.co…
Saw earlier that folks in Joplin are hustling to help the folks in Moore. God bless America.
@Adam_Mueller Actually pretty good advice
Definitely plead the fifth. Pleading the first will only get you in trouble.
@mkhammer @allahpundit Sam's definition of co-conspirators
Can we at least add some funny to the horror? Lerner can take the fifth, but only if she does it like Dave Chappelle.
@arishapiro co-conspirators?
RT @arishapiro: Spotted: @joshtpm @CapehartJ @ezraklein &amp; other lefty columnists headed into the West Wing as a group. POTUS coffee? Carney…
Dear Congress, I don't need a media shield law if the Justice Dept is already reading my emails.
I used to want a media shield law. These days I'll settle for not being labelled a terrorist co-conspirator.
So the president doesn't think being a reporter is a criminal act. Thanks?
I was afraid to start tweeting about the assault on James Rosen today. It could easily have devolved into endless profanity and sobbing.
Worst part about potus and @PressSec acting this way over AP/Fox/DOJ is that we've screwed up media so bad, America ain't coming to help.
After last week, the NYT called @PressSec a "press warrior." After today I'm guessing he'll get some kind of medal.
Just seeing today's WH briefing. Repeating from last week: @PressSec is a spineless slug
@HenryKraemer Always an mistake to assume a sliver of goodness here. He's no different. And surprisingly vengeful
Why diehard apologize for anyone here? You pay them to con you.
@HenryKraemer Nope, and it might be the worst. Because it's Obama himself saying yeah so? Whatcha gonna do about it?
I'd love to do QandA from time to time if there's interest. But read a damn paper. Quit being easy marks for pols betting on ignorance.
@JohnSunununu Thanks. I am after all a complete goddamn idiot... For trying to help.
@JohnSunununu I'm out. Keep making it about me. I confess: govt spying on press makes me ill. Buy a paper. Trying to help.
@JohnSunununu I've got 140 characters. Look up the damn tape. He brought up troops. And in the end, it was first for safety then PR event
@JohnSunununu I'm not. But his feeling seems to be FU, I'm president, oh, and nat'l sec. Dangerous territory. Yeah, he's potus. Not king.
@JohnSunununu It's basically the laziest FU use of nat'l security to do whatever. Bush struggled with this stuff. 44 not so much
@JohnSunununu Without a hint of concern, he can take whatever press comms he wants to stop leaks that might hurt troops. Because troops.
@JohnSunununu Well, the ap, other reporters disagree. Me too. Con law prof at least bullshits abt love of 2nd amend. He knows we're hated
@stewsky I'm not anti-Obama. I'm anti-politician. Especially when they forget who they work for.
@TSJ55 Envy potus. He gets out more than me, and I have far fewer scandals.
@TSJ55 Good to hear from you. You getting out much?
@TSJ55 So we have this shit called super pollen this year. I'm injecting Allegra between my toes, but still canceling too many tee times
@JohnSunununu 60K troops at war fighting for executive branch and overzealous prosecutors, I guess.
@JohnSunununu adorable tough shit, no apologies for DOJ reading AP's phone recs. Nat'l security reasons he don't have to share, incl PR
Been a while since Obama-holics came after me. Ah blind loyalty. Candidate  never has to think about or lift a finger for that vote.
@HenryKraemer Worst part, while she gazed in his eyes, she was audited, phone was tapped and house marked for drone strike.
@ArunChaud Funny. I remember Gibbs saying the same. He suggested drug-testing.
Just not a Preakness fan. Good race though. Where were you at Derby, Oxbow?
@Allison_sad Yes ma'am, you did. I worked very hard to get here, cover three campaigns and the WH. Take care. Please read more.
@HenryKraemer Under-informed argument. I like that. Oh well. Not doing this all night though.
Ugh. I was one-yo last triple crown
@HenryKraemer I do have a southern accent. Hoping positive comes out of this. More reading, less lying. Ya know, citizenship.
@Allison_sad So study up and come back. Maybe with fewer baseless accusations though. You're not a politician yet:)
@Allison_sad Look, I'm not mad. A little sad though. You have the fire. And this stuff is important and fun when you can have the arguments
@HenryKraemer Ugh, I know. For some reason lying groupies who think nothing of impugning my career get to me.
@Allison_sad Really? What foreign journalists do you like? Or are those more "facts?" Quit tweeting and go to a library.
@Allison_sad You're reckless and know nothing. Accusations of bias followed your exposed lie. You might think about a political career.
@Allison_sad Why in the world did you pick a fight that wasn't about whether he's hotter with or without the gray?
@Allison_sad You are a politician's dream. You should try patriotism. It's kinda like a dreamy crush.
@Allison_sad Goodness. More accusations but still no facts. It is a little personal since I prefer the constitution to any politician.
For the Obama-is-perfect crowd, if you hear music when he speaks, start listening to the words. And don't pick fights with people who do.
@Allison_sad It's a great country. You oughta check out some of the non-Obama stuff. Guessing I need not wait for an apology.
@Allison_sad And last, if you've got the http://t.co/P9s5Oi5C5q stuff down cold but not so much the Bill of Rights, take it elsewhere
@Allison_sad Listen to the stuff he says beyond fired up and ready to go. Appreciate so many gave their lives for him but for our country.
@Allison_sad Sounds personal? You accused me of falsehoods with zero idea you were right except he's infallible.That's important some time.
@Allison_sad There are quite a few. Op was over, 60K troops no more compromised than before, they btw are fighting for us, not exec power
@Allison_sad If you don't know them, don't take blind shots at my career. This stuff is as serious as it gets. You should treat it so.
@Allison_sad It's not a guessing game for me. I know the facts. Spoiler: they don't add up to him being perfect.
@Allison_sad so you led by accusing me of spewing falsehoods, ignoring facts. Now you won't comment until you see the facts. We're done here
@Allison_sad Neither. A concerned American. Brother of a two-war vet and not a fan of blind loyalists who claim "facts" and question nothing
@ArunChaud Unless Romania and Eurovision are racehorses, I gotta pass.
@ArunChaud Yes. It's not a flip side. It's worth more than no apologies. And it more than guarding executive power is why they're fighting.
And when potus is nonplussed about troops as cover and a free press and you're in charge of oversight -- Quit tweeting and go to work.
If the president uses our troops at war for cover to dismiss the first amendment and you respond "umbrella," go home. We have plenty of you
I quit. Gotta accept I will never understand that story and particularly the word warrior. Phone down.
Huh. NYT story on "warrior" Carney is real. I'm at a loss.
Have a great weekend, folks. Unemployed, veterans, school kids: Next week, we swear.
@CliotheLeo Sorry to lose you. Best wishes
@TVietor08 Little boys who prefer to do their cussing off the record shouldn't use words like brave. But I reached out to him.
That said, he's a dime a dozen here. They work their hustle and disappear. But I don't know what the hell the NYT was thinking.
Not normally my style to call out a flak. But about the fifth "great week," his attitude was a middle finger to all of us.
Ok, warrior it is. But a note to the NYT: It's one thing to be fed shit by a huckster. Quite another to thank him for it.
Warrior?
Hell, I'll play along. Kick ass week, @PressSec! Was worried about you, boo.
Gotta be about one of the other Jay Carneys.
Hell, even the Carney family newsletter used the word weasel.
Uh, so the NYT bestows "warrior" on Carney, a gutless slug who keeps saying what a great week he had? Warriors stand for something.
"Thank God. The police." Fletch, summing up oversight hearings
Under grilling, IRS admits "horrible" customer service. Screw it. I'll take it.
Was fuming at Miller, but really, even if I murdered and ate dozens of people, I'd be damned if a congressional committee judged me
Thank God McDermott is there to defend the IRS.
Good stuff: I didn't mislead you. I was flat out lying to you.
Remember when the folks lying to us had the decency to put a little effort, a little showmanship into the lies?
Good lord. At the very least we deserve better con artists.
So the IRS wasn't shooting at Navin. It was the cans. They hate those cans.
Remember, folks, I ain't even media anymore. Just an average good-looking American howling at the moon
That's it for today's edition of Sam on Fire
So many soulless scumbag poser so-called journalists out there. Keep hitting class reporters like Juleanna Goldman,posers'll be all you get
Are y'all tweeting an actual Woodward quote or a Deep Thought by Jack Handy?
Per Playbook, this is day two of the White House on offense. Yeah, got 'em right where they want 'em.
Take a cue from @bpshow who's doing his part to keep wayward lost journalists off the streets and off bad drugs. See you soon, Bill
@bpshow save me some Toronto soup
A Friday favor: Before you hate a fellow American today, take 30 seconds to hate a politician. It's the American way.
I'm still figuring out life without editors. Feels good. Maybe too good.
Sheeeit. I woke up on the self-righteous side of the bed this morning.
@billburton @PressSec Overwrought is my specialty. Sad day for first amendment today. A journalist would've stood up.
An explanation: "I was on your side" was always annoying. Given today's casual dismissal of the 1st amend, it's downright insulting
@billburton @PressSec I mean it's lost meaning from Jay. He don't live here anymore (uh, neither do I, I guess)
Last year a record number of journalists were killed worldwide. Worth remembering every time @PressSec pulls his faded membership card out.
Good gawd, 14-yo bloggers are using WaPo to sext the president. @ezraklein you trolling folks?
RIP Dick Trickle
I've heard people describe Chris Matthews as hard-nosed. Uh, does hard mean brown in some regions?
Who's writing the Marine/umbrella metaphor for using 60K troops to cover up for DOJ lede? Smart take.
@AnthonyAbides They're your countrymen, buddy. Keep fighting each other, we are easy to rule. And they fight all the way to the bank
Well yeah, this was exactly the kind of day you expect when you wake up to Bullworth. Clocking out. Later skaters
@AnthonyAbides sorry. Not a question. Neither side gives a good goddamn about folks like the bbn. Why defend any of them?
@OKnox Ain't gonna say it... Monster.
@AnthonyAbides about what? Nobody here fighting for you? Why fight for them? Not sure what's wrong with declaring both sides scum
@AnthonyAbides record scratch. Dude, that is way over the line
@RBPundit Naw, I'm good. Unemployed jokes are funny though.
Is there a word for when you're getting trolled, you know it but still take the bait and then can't stop?
@RBPundit Ha. Alright, punk. Back to your mama's basement.
@RBPundit false choice. I'm mortified by both. Nothing for anyone to be proud of today
@AG_Conservative dude, ain't got no job. I can tweet and golf. So I'm thinking either president or House leadership
@RBPundit Well that got the blood flowing, gorgeous. I'm grateful.
@RBPundit not sure what values your backing if you can find reason to defend anyone in this town. But I'm happy to figure out in person
@RBPundit @DarrellIssa You mean the elected lawmaker entrusted with the sacred, critical duty of oversight? Do I need a hash tag?
@RBPundit Well, my dear horse's ass, he didn't use a military coup to pass it. I'll leave the partisan garbage to you. None righteous here
This shit would be too cute by half if it was a roaring economy during peacetime. In these circumstances, it's shameful.
Hey, knuckleheads who got elected, quit tweeting! Go back to work! We're paying you to name post offices; not to tweet!
Why is potus so confident? The Republican charged with oversight is giggling at his blackberry every 30 seconds.
Last one, punch hole in wall, go outside: surprising the 1st amendment doesn't merit a tenth of the pretend love potus shows for the 2nd
Sonofa... People would walk out of the movie at this point. Nation desperate for oversight, and Issa is playing twitter games.
So next year's prom, give potus's seat to buzzfeed?
Since its founding, our nation has painfully deliberated how to balance security and freedom. Who knew it could be made to sound so cheap?
Y'all know two things I don't cotton to: first amendment and messing with the troops. Really a chilling, nauseating response.
@daveweigel Dude, Crosby's trip to rehab story at least moves him to third
I must apologize. Got worked up. But there's no excuse for two Spies Like Us references on the same day. I'm sorry. I'll be more respectful
@bobbiebarnhill Not sure I would agree -- this time. What would you have asked?
Mentioning the brave 60K serving in Afghanistan is hardly a satisfactory answer to very troubling questions
Forgive my language, but with that DOJ answer, potus skipped Bullworth and went straight to bullshit.
Jaw still open. The First goddamn Amendment was "the flip side?"
This president is the worst in modern history at faking respect for a free press. But it's a close call.
So safety first through super vague and appalling methods, then "on the flip side" that whole first amendment thang.
Thank goodness. The commander-in-chief is keeping y'all safe by reading who ap reporters were calling from the Hill. Yeah.
The more he answers it, the more potus's Syria answer is only missing "Are there any Paraguayans here?"
My staff has assured me the weather is fine.
Turkish PM missed the joke of the century: No, Mr. President, you better keep the umbrella.
My Turkish is a little rusty, but here goes: "I would just like to express how happy I am to not be President Obama for the next 30 minutes"
So who's leading with EU trade committee?
So he's a little tardy. Could be worse. His justice department could be... Nevermind.
My friends in the garden, start shouting questions at the damn building.
This is either a real danger sign for US-Turkish relations or clear and utter disdain for the press
sorry I'm late, I had to attend the reading of a will. I had to stay till the very end, and I found out I received nothing... broke my arm.
@edhenryTV Keep an eye on your phone. If he wants a complete GFY to the AP, he'll call.
If potus goes to @edhenryTV for first Q, I would advise standing back from both the ap correspondent and the bureau. Boom!
Can't stomach a Bullworth day (seriously, any day now, unemployed folks). I'm off to the golf course. Holler when we get to Dick Tracy
@rickklein More or less. A distraction that's so obviously a distraction it becomes comedy.
@rickklein I believe South Park called it "the Chewbacca defense."
saw @AriFleischer on a scandal high horse and Chris Matthews has turned on Obama. Young DCers, look away. Credibility does/should matter
Somewhere this morning Warren Beatty was finally able to put a haunting mystery to rest: Who was the guy who saw Bulworth?
Mojo back and stronger footing. Hmmm. Is it that easy or do the American people get a say?
How does this work now -- do we got to DOJ to find out what the ap is leading with after that statement?
Take two: I'm late to this DOJ story. Been focused on golf. Apparently, I'm the president.
Late to this story 'cause I've been golf-focused. So from now on, please call me President Sam.
Surprised Carney's stmt didn't include advice to @cbabington on what he should get for dinner

Been working on the best darn hardcore cuss-filled gangster rap song about how no other moms can step to mine. She'll love it.
Ugh. Watched Drugstore Cowboy, an old fav, then Gangster Squad. People cain't write no more.

@OKnox Worse. Called her ol sport, and she excitedly said she watches espn classic too. (Not really)
@Chris_Moody Dude, she knew it was a movie. She's probably class valedictorian. Criminal our ed. system robs kids of such purty words

It's a vicious sight. You should see a red-faced @edhenryTV yelling at @jonkarl "hit me harder!" A secret journalism tradition.
Few know this, but before they go to briefing room for a potus presser, WH correspondents slap the hell out of each other getting psyched
@JeffSadosky @Sarah_Boxer so much more to me. I'm also excited for Derby.
@Chris_Moody Bless you
@meredithshiner @OKnox @jdickerson O-dawg. O-livin'-right. O-my. #oliviernicknames
@OKnox @jdickerson Never forget the wording of what I didn't ask. Only vaguely remember what I did
@jdickerson @OKnox called on twice. First time earned my paycheck. Second time blew it and didn't ask my first Q. Gnawed at me ever since
@OKnox This might just be obnoxious. If I was in the WH basement, I think I'd wanna kick my ass. Might tee off in the rain for all of us
@OKnox Ask George Condon the story of Schieffer and "what's the deal with Russia?"
@OKnox Of course. And they know he's coming to them. Trick is don't get used. He's got opening remarks. What if espn asked abt Syria.
I just ruined @GlennThrush's question. Sorry, bro
Friendly tip to fmr WH colleagues: if potus wants to talk Jason Collins, he's free to bring it up. While important, if asked, canned stmt
First few potus pressers, my hands shook uncontrollably. Not afeared of any man, but the idea of standing up, that level, crowd, arena

@mkhammer Yep. Gather 'round magic picture box. Saw on the news that "a lot of Americans are hearing the word Chechnya for the first time."
@DylanByers what's a Chechen?
And man, given the week we in the media had, it takes real stones to assume the ignorance of others. End transmission. Tirade over.
Sorry but condescending 'tudes toward non-NYC America my greatest pet peeve. Annoying most days. Irresponsible, reckless on tragic days.
I do want to say Pete Williams has done amazing work, and he has gone above and beyond the responsibility inherent in the moment.
Sorry to do this, but msnbc, that was bushleague. Most days ppl can ignore. Tragedies bring them to TVs. For information, not insults
@Tamcam123 I'm with you. Beyond insulting.
Just talked to folks in Kentucky. They're still waiting to hear where and what a Chechnya is. In the meantime, they're staring at the sun
On behalf of non-NYC America: I have heard of Chechnya, but I'm grateful msnbc hasn't given up on us poor dumb slobs.Also, what's a fork?
@SabrinaSiddiqui Thank God the enlightened and inherently smarter people of NYC cable news still bother with educating the rest of us folks

My fellow Americans, a trying, hellish week Boston to DC's battles. Do me a favor: Ignore at least 1 person who angers you online tomorrow.
Since I'm usually the Travis Bickle of DC tweeting, this feels odd to say: Some of y'all need to say goodnight and turn the computer off.
Watching the Wizards this year after @John_Wall came back was amazing. No shot at play-offs, but still they fought. Pride. Grit. Next year.
@Lindenberger That's it. You cain't come here. We're all full.
@TonyFratto I wish I had never seen it. Very few victims of kidnapping and sex trafficking have former-CIA dads to come get them.
@Lindenberger You're a Louisville Cardinal. Neither Wall nor the Hoyas want ya. I suggest the Kastles
Tough loss @WashWizards. Proud as hell of the season though. Fought like lions to the very end of every game. Keep your head up @John_Wall
@mikememoli Thanks. Good to see you today.
@TonyFratto Scarred me. Way too heavy an issue for an action movie. Seriously just horrified me.
@mikememoli You get the sense that some family members thought 50+ was a win?
Serious question: Did someone at some point today have to explain cloture to Newtown family members?
@meredithshiner @OKnox @dcbigjohn Are you kidding? You're my hero. You called him on it faster than I could. And you're a Dukie.
Turned out the folks walking into the Senate side with me weren't just Sandy Hook. Also Aurora, Va.Tech. and maybe more.

@CindyCoops Happy to help. Just think one good thought about the media today:)
@CindyCoops  Sure. "Do you think the bombings in Boston have any policy implications either on gun control or immigration?"
"I think that in some cases the president has used them as props, and that disappoints me." -- Paul
Paul: "And I know they’re coming voluntarily, and they want to come be part of this debate. But it still saddens me just to see them."
Rand Paul's criticism of potus for using Newtown families as props was in response to a question about Boston.
At Monitor breakfast this morning (my 1st in a while), kept thinking of sitting next to the late great Broder when Phil Singer went off
@Lexvegaskid He is not. He's a Dukie.
Rand noted he doesn't always go to the Derby. I always figured great seats to Derby and UK ball were why ppl ran for office in the Bluegrass
"We're colleagues, and I do respect him," Rand Paul on McConnell. Added: "I don't think he ever personally disliked me."
Rand Paul did seem to have trouble with date JFK died. Legendary Mark Shields offered up '63. The senator: "But was it summer or fall?"
And because you were dying to know, Sen. Rand Paul will be attending the Kentucky Derby this year.
Yeah, Sen. Paul did pause when I asked if McConnell is a "mentor." Then: "Thoreau is a mentor."
always nice to have breakfast with a fellow Kentuckian
RT @Chris_Moody: Reuters' @SamYoungman asked Rand Paul if he considers Mitch McConnell "mentor." Paul pauses. "Thoreau is a mentor."

@TigerWoods should've skipped the dozen tweet legal jargon and just responded "Yes, yes. Winter rules."
I love watching Tiger play, but I would love more Condi Rice giving an cuss-filled interview that includes "they shoulda kicked him out!"

Saddest thing about the Cohen stuff is that he was friends with Warren Zevon. Cyndi Lauper ain't no Warren.
I don't think as much of the Steve Cohen stuff because a. I've known him for years and b. in the South, he's known as eccentric, not weird

@pb65 That's strange. Where you at in the Bluegrass? Seems to me like it would look much worse for Dems. Especially locally.
@pb65 I'm not sure I understand. Mind to rephrase?
I will say Team McConnell is teaching one good political lesson: Don't wait for an opponent to start fighting. Go hard at what you do have.
And I don't have a damn clue what's been happening in Augusta
I mean at this point I'm waiting for Jesse to imply that ProgressKY was the reason the Commonwealth stayed neutral during the Civil War.
Day one of the Bluegrass story was a clinic by McConnell. But I'm not sure they're projecting a lot of strength/toughness at this point.
@ScottJenningsKY Can we get round-the-clock protection for Ali, Moonlite BBQ, Rupp and Keeneland?
For their next phase, ProgressKY will burn down My Old Kentucky Home, mix bourbon with diet coke and proclaim Duke the best bball team.
Try to keep in mind that he didn't pass the bar, but he knows a lil' bit.
@ScottJenningsKY Dude, I just assumed you were Progress KY. For a minute I even thought you were Ashley Judd.
Dems in my home state do work hard to lose elections it seems. ProgressKY should be on McConnell's payroll. With Aqua Budha.
Question is would Raylan Givens arrest ProgressKY or get 'em to pull so he could take 'em down.
I also believe my late grandfather consistently shoots in the 60s at said course. And since it's Heaven, Grandma tells him to play more.
It's a golfer's cliche, but I believe Heaven's golf course looks like Augusta. I'd add 17 from Sawgrass and Pebble's ocean views.

“Hey, Ray, why don’t you teach this kid how to shoot?”  Sports writers doing something on potus's 2-22 day, PLEASE call Rondo for comment.
I keep coming back to his trash-talker reputation. Only thing I can figure is in private games, potus turns into a teenaged werewolf.
Steve Alford just offered POTUS a scholarship at UCLA.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that Arnie Duncan and Reggie Love have thrown a lot of games over the last five years.
And he has a reputation as a trash-talker?! The man is gifted with words, but it's hard to talk lemon with a shot like that.
I've seen potus throw a baseball, bowl, swing a golf club and now this. Law school was the right move.
Worst part about POTUS's shooting woes: Last night, unaccording to N.Korea media reports, Kim Jong-Un scored 178 points in a pick-up game.
I would still take potus on the Wizards over Jordan Crawford.
@John_Wall get the hell away from POTUS! That kind of shooting slump can be contagious.
POTUS shot 2-22?! Sounds like he could supply enough bricks to cover whatever infrastructure projects he wants.
Of all the WH pool reports I did, the Easter Egg hunt was most daunting. Chaos I cared nothing about but soooo many others did.

Just a heads up, I'll be viciously undermining any efforts to canonize Pitino this week.
This week, I'm a Shocker.
Good luck to Ryan Harrow. Now, @UKCoachCalipari offer Hawkins a scholarship
Love it! @John_Wall  with the three-ball icing on the cake
@Marty2634 Hey man! Not this year. Weak draft. Next year UK could have eight in the first round. Can't wait!
Never wanna see a kid get injured. Hate it for Ware and his teammates. But you'll have to break both my legs to get me to root for UofL
@JohnJHarwood @tonyfratto I'm happy to explain my contempt in detail including Laettner stepping on Aminu, the Maggette double-standard, etc
Rooting hard for Michicuse State.
Where are you, asteroid?
Just left church, a buddy's daughter was baptized. good stuff. might've added a prayer to request one meteor for UofL/Duke. heads up
This tournament is a preview of my every March for eternity should I end up in Hell. I wish to write in "Asteroid" in my brackets.
Really?! If Alford is the guy, I have to assume that Dick Morris was on the short list.
#fridaynewsdump Peeps are gross.
Happy birthday to Robert Gibbs and @sppeoples. And a big good morning to all you trash-talking, no-ring-having IU fans.
@chrisswartout I'm the same way -- with a UF exception. Blame Noah.
How hard is it for me to watch a Kentucky-less tournament? Two minutes into Ariz./Ohio State I flipped over to, gulp, Caddyshack II
@perrybaconjr @kenvogel But Perry, I agree with everything you said. I just think it was gonna be much uglier than most knew.
@perrybaconjr @kenvogel I just watched Andrew Wiggins's mix-tape. I say if he commits to UK, we give him a Senate seat.
Now that Judd ain't running, you Washington folks got 10 seconds to git off our property.
Good luck in the NIT, Ms. Judd
My actual Kentuckian take: Never knew if she'd run. Never thought for a second she could win.
If Kentucky native Hunter Thompson was still alive, we could speculate about him running.
Now let's start guessing if Kentucky native Johnny Depp will run.
Prolly the right call. She needs at least one more year in college to work on her mid-range jumper.
@rickklein My hat's off to you, sir.
@jaketapper Tried to leap to Tiger's defense, and all I came up with is "but dude, he's so fun to watch when he's on fire."
@rickklein Best promotional tweet I've ever seen.
I like to imagine that while SCOTUS hears arguments, @SteveScully and @cspan folks walk around office punching holes in the walls.
Manti T'eo just proposed to @RepJackKimble
State of Congress: Fake congressional twitter accounts don't seem fake
Just for the sake of comedy, I wish the Hot Cops were working security outside SCOTUS.
Reporters at SCOTUS, remember to verify sexuality with the if-your-hand-is-bigger-than-your-face test.
Until you've free-based a pair of Cole Haan loafers, I don't wanna hear it.
Scenes SCOTUS really make me miss Rodney Dangerfield. Picture Al Czervik at the top of the steps declaring "Hey everybody..."
RT @SalenaZitoTrib: Guy in coffee shop this AM watching Supreme Court spectacle on TV says "So when are we going to talk about the jobs?"
Reading your tweets about the scene at SCOTUS, I have to believe we are minutes away from the greatest dance party in history.
@John_Wall !!! Congrats on the new career high!
I have a hard time imagining Randy Whitman saying anything other than "I'm sorry. Did you say the two yutes?"

LA Kings are at the White House tomorrow. Gretzky was traded to LA in 1988. Discovered that while sipping after-dinner Sanka at 4 pm.
Tiger ain't lost since he played with potus, and, man, I can't find a good joke there...
@AaronBlakeWP y'all won't do better than Tubby
@MZHemingway Fair enuff. And this exchange goes down as Exhibit A of what my life is like when Kentucky doesn't make the tournament
@MZHemingway Media invention might be a stretch. Still, larger point being that national attitudes toward Tinky Winky have changed.
@MZHemingway Sorry. Been 14 years since "a journal published by his ministry did contain an article alleging" Tinky Winky was gay.
@stevebenen I keep waiting for a Tinky Winky "It gets better" ad.
Been 14 years since the late Jerry Falwell took aim at Tinky Winky, the purple gay Teletubby.
America, we gotta take notice. If we don't debate and address our issues like adults, Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy will weigh in.
Been 17 years since Newt's lesbian half-sister officiated a gay wedding on Friends. Yeah, Friends was on 17 years ago.
@PentagonPresSec I take that to mean you're not running for Senate.
What? They don't award points for talking? Shhhhhhhh
I don't care if it's the University of Phoenix -- somebody please stop Louisville.
Kansas vs. UNC and no Kentucky means for the 4 billionth time in my life, I'm grateful Red Dawn is on the teevee.
Still a great trip, @John_Wall. Still shakin' my head over LA. And thanks for giving me some ball to cheer this March.
Not great timing, but you gotta love this kind of strut from a PG: “Go to the basket and I swear to God, I’ll knock your…out.” @John_Wall
Saw Ralph Reed on the teevee this morning and less than five minutes later I was watching Hot Tub Time Machine.
Brackets could be better, but I'm golden as long as Tagg wins it all.
@mattbeynon I quit watching after 30 seconds (aka a Pitino marathon)
@mattbeynon My skin is crawling. We're gonna have to bleach everything Pitino touches.
Great @MrMichaelLee story on @John_Wall  blowing up lately, owning the Lakers last night. "I think I’m growing before my eyes..."
@John_Wall, @WashWizards amazing win last night!
@NolteNC Hate that for you, man. Hope it was at least a good dream.
@John_Wall dude, this March belongs to you!
@UMRebelCJ @NativeFlash22 Disappointing. But happy for Robert Morris.
@UMRebelCJ @NativeFlash22 UK 87 -- Ole Miss 74. Henderson 5-19. It's cool though. I don't think of Ole Miss as a math school.
"Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for a while." Sorry, Hoya fans, figured I'd never get another chance for that reference
@TonyFratto @BenFellerNY I'm in bizzaro world. Wizards are good, Kentucky is bad, Obama is drone happy and Cheney talks like Nora Ephron
Let's go Kansas/Louisville/Indiana! Y'all can do it! #reversejinxtime
@BenFellerNY @TonyFratto Sorry. My magic March touch is way, way off. Ask the deservedly ecstatic folks at Robert Morris.
@hjacksonAP I dream of living in a home with a name like Rowan Oak.
I was all set to root for Ole Miss. Oxford one of my top-five towns. Their fans and point guard talked me out of it.
@daDrumFreak Ain't never gonna stop. Hope you're still on twitter a year from now
@MorningBriefing @georgecondon He'll find a positive way to look at it. It's his ugliest quality.
Because of my dear friend @georgecondon, I decided to root for G-town. Hoya fans, feel free to blame me.
Rooting hard for Western Kentucky tonight. Only school in the Bluegrass that would let me graduate. Go Hilltoppers!
@KySportsRadio you practiced law. how does the phrase "about to get cut" normally get treated?
@Will_Schulze The town that gave us Faulkner, and that's your response? Stay classy, Ole Miss.
@cpurdom Ha. I shoulda known he was one of yours. Traitor.
@SabrinaSiddiqui THANK YOU! @OKnox was traveling, and I started thinking doggy sunglasses were a figment of my imagination.
@NativeFlash22 you're fighting with a fake account. Also, our worst team in years shut you down. Dude, stick to MySpace.
Game on. And on and on and on and on...
What would it have been called? Newtorum? Sangrich? Gigli?
@mpoindc I can't see them getting through first presser, let alone winning Michigan. Maybe makes Romney look steady
@mpoindc I honestly don't think it would've lasted long enough to hurt Romney.
@mpoindc It actually could've changed race. Newtorum explodes spectacularly in less than a week, Romney gets nom sooner
@mattbeynon Meanwhile, inside Santorum hq: "He got bit by a what?!"
@mattbeynon y'all would've walked when you saw the bill for Ellis's diamond encrusted sweater vest
Guessing Santorum would've done a break-up by post-it after the first "Calista and I and Rick..."
I'll take the zoos, you take the bowling alleys. Are we sure this would have "toppled" Romney?

That's it for me. Twitter is a serious bummer this afternoon. Have a good weekend, and Go Cats!

One caveat: those of you playing the home version of the blame game, yeah you, you can't come in. Try the Newseum.
Well, thanks for proving there's nothing we can't fight about. My bottom line: It's our house and officials here best not forget it.
@samsteinhp still his house. And I'm not having this argument with reporters who see it when they please.
The guy in Neb who has worked and saved for years to show his family our nation's capital doesn't care abt sequesters. Let him in his house
Yeah, I hear you. Sequester this, sequester that. Allow me to reply: IT'S OUR HOUSE!
Here's why WH tour thing bothers me: While their elected reps are screwing things up, Americans aren't. So let 'em in their house.
Man, two days of watching smoke has really put me in a bonfire kinda mood. Anybody burned down Cap Lounge lately?
The giveaway was Diego Maradona's hand hanging from his neck.
It really is a beautiful process. Still, if I was in the square, I would have to loudly request the new pope play some Skynyrd.
There was already a Pope Francis. His last name was Sinatra.
I shall name my first and second born after the first person to tell the pope: "Lighten up, Francis."
Very kind of the new pope to go with Francis so people like me can make "Stripes" jokes
At 76, the man had to choose between becoming pope or signing 5-year contract with the Redskins
oh the old Chicago Bulls intro would be perfect for this
new pope refusing to come out until 1,000 brown M&amp;Ms are delivered to his dressing room. God help you if there's a green one.
please please please come out in a Nixon mask
as I've told many before, Pope Sam has a nice ring to it
If he comes out with Axl on one side and @Slash on the other, I'll convert.
If he chooses the name Pope The Ultimate Warrior the First, I'll convert.
@Philip_Elliott @RickSantorum even stranger, the second the smoke started, Santorum jumped on a plane to Iowa.
As a protestant, I feel like a House Republican. This election meant nothing to me.
Just something about the Swiss Guard that makes me wanna fight one of 'em
if freakin' Rodman walks out on that balcony, I'm maxing out to Satan
I know it's a long shot, but please please choose the name Pope Joey Joe-Joe Shabadoo the First
Awww yeah. Look at that chimney. New pope: "Dave's not here, man."
@moirabagley alright, baby panda headed your way. on one condition: no Dukies allowed to pet it
@moirabagley @SenRandPaul what's the traditional gift for the one-week filibuster anniversary? Paper? Green paper sent to McConnell?
@AshleyJudd you forgot the launch of political ads
so if you're a Dem, why would you give cash to such an obviously nonpartisan group like OFA?
Today's pet peeve from Sam Oldman: Unless you're a stoned philosophy major, please stop saying "it is what it is."
Pretty simple really. Vatican City has great shooters, but they need help on the boards. (and I pray that's my last Rodman tweet ever)

"You remember– you were in the Clinton administration." potus to @GStephanopoulos, making coffee unnecessary for my friends on the right

Out in Vegas, when not being smacked around by Mo Green, Fredo Romney waits for someone to call about Mass.Senate race.

Sequester me, boys. SEQUESTER ME!!! #SwayzeSequestermovielines a little Red Dawn
The little hand says it's time for sequester #SwayzeSequestermovielines
Sequester don't hurt. #sequestermovielines and that one's from Road House
C'mon. It's a sequester. We zip in, we pick 'em up, we zip right out again. It's a sequester. It's like going into Wisconsin.
I thinkI'm speaking for the entire platoon when I say this sequester should be postponed until this platoon is better rested
If I was half the man I was 10 years ago, I'd take a flamethrower to this whole [expletive] sequester. #sequestermovielines
"I want a hamburger. No, a cheeseburger." You'll get nothing and like it because Bushwood was hit by the sequester.
We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the sequester began to kick in.
PUT. that coffee. down. We can't afford it. #SequesterMovieLines

Just called my golf course (a DC park) about effects of sequester. Was told "we don't know yet." Course is open Saturday though
So freaking weird. I thought for sure 48 hours of us preening and waxing about Woodward would turn the sequester off.

Let's say they did play best ball. How many of potus's shots do you think they used? I'm setting the O/U at 1.

Disappointed in you, Internet. Asteroid nearby and potus aboard AF1. I know it's Friday, but you conspiracy theorists should be ashamed.

I like to think that @UKCoachCalipari warned McConnell about roughing up @AshleyJudd. "She's one of ours, Mitch."

Good win, Wildcats. I don't know what to tell ya, @djusatoday
I get the sense from watching ESPNU that if you worked there, you would constantly be whining that the ESPN folks don't take you seriously
Kentucky shot 68 percent in the first half. That's gonna happen a lot, right?
Points if you use "got the boot" or other foot-related phrases
@iswanTheHill as a Kentuckian, I'm embarrassed it took me so long to tune in. I should've listened.
After a viewing binge, I'm completely hooked on Justified. The Bluegrass Conspiracy story arc in the new season is awesome. Love that story

I'm not joining the PGA. The timing isn't right.
Shhhh. Listen closely and you can hear Romney advisers laughing like crazy at this Tagg idea. Senator Cliff Claven is more likely.
Tagg stuff reminds me of Chris Heinz. Remember before November '04 how huge his political career was gonna be?
I would give Tagg only slightly better odds of winning in Massachusetts than Rick Pitino
still no word on whether Fredo Romney will leave the Tropicana to run in special election
Been chuckling all day. Why? Senator Tagg.
Bet Flacco still has to show his team ID to get in the victory party.
Power outage + 49ers comeback win = best Ray Lewis post-game presser ever. Like Stevie Johnson but sooooooo much worse.
Yeah. Go ahead, bra. Order a Beck's Saphire. What? No, of course we're not gonna make fun of you.
They're brothers?!
I woulda cracked up had the lights come back on to reveal Ray Lewis standing alone on the sidelines, his teammates all on the other side.

Belt it out, Ray. Just don't kill nobody.
Potus should've claimed, with a wink, that the wings are from a bird he shot.
So Ray, what are you gonna do in your retirement? Aw, you know, murder.
Wait. The coaches are brothers?!
Oh good Lord. The breaking news just keeps coming. Tom Crean is related to 'em too?!
BROTHERS?!!!!
One of my all-time fav movie scenes is Bill Murray as Hunter Thompson covering the '72 Super Bowl in Where the Buffalo Roam.
Did you know Larry Fitzgerald's dad is a sportswriter?! True, has no meaning in this game, but I'm still blown away by it.
If DHS ain't keeping a list of you folks who are tweeting about soccer on Super Bowl Sunday, they oughta be.
The coaches are brothers?! Someone should talk about that.
Alright, Jimmy Dykes, put your money where your mouth is. Race Kyle. He wins, you give a grand to charity. Punk.
It would be appropriate if there was a spike in the number of babies in Kentucky named Nerlens.

I have not seen all of today's Hagel hearings. Has anyone asked about Afghanistan, ya know, the place where we're at war?
Hagel gave a shout-out to Jan Scruggs today. Hagel has been helping Jan with the Vietnam veterans education center

I totally thought that was gonna be the video of Hagel breaking Joe Theismann's leg

I remember the first time I met Kerry in New Hampshire in '03. He had just started those remarks.
You've been warned, Foggy Bottom. Use the bathroom before Secretary Kerry begins his welcome remarks.
campaigns make people do crazy things. I say that because I can't believe I read Doug Brinkley's book on Kerry back in '04
I feel like the last time this many folks paid attn to a Kerry floor speech, he was talking about who serves in war and ruining '08 chances
@BuzzFeedAndrew I of course have no idea who Ron Jeremy is. But I hope he gets better.
Man, why do people give Ray Lewis such a a hard time? Oh, right.
According to Larry Fishburne in Boyz N The Hood, having a gun does not make you a man.
Nerlens with 11 blocks. That's insane. I'll bet Marshall Henderson's night terrors look exactly like you think they would.
Great win, Wildcats. Y'all do keep it interesting.

Sad, but Kaufman would actually be just 64-yo
Lamestream media Katie Couric's "gotcha" questions have convinced me that Manti Te'o is not qualified to be vice president.

Oprah tells crowd to look under their chairs where they discover rotten vegetables to throw at Lance. That interview I would watch.
@TheMatthewKeys there's a good reason why there ain't no It Gets Better campaign for John Mayer fans
@TheMatthewKeys i just learned that I'm more forgiving of doping and lying than I am of John Mayer appreciation. Not ok!
@TheMatthewKeys dude. Oprah can't save you
I'll watch the interview just as soon as twitter tells me Oprah slapped Lance with an open hand
@SIPeteThamel how much time did you spend in Turkey trying to nail Kanter?
Pete Thamel has obvious blind spot, decides who the good kids (Te'o) and bad kids (Bledsoe, Kanter, Honeybadger) are. Writes accordingly
"I can call Stanford and check. They have to have some record or note that she passed." Pete Thamel in interview with Te'o.
What all Kentucky fans know: If Enis Kanter or Eric Bledsoe had fake girlfriends, Pete Thamel would have found it
@KlausMarre thanks? was this a conversation somewhere?
I've spent the last 24 hours regretting that I didn't do more to confirm the existence of Ann Romney.
@AshleyJudd you're real, right? (also, are you running for Senate?)
Somewhere Rick Pitino is furious that he didn't think of that.
Man, college has changed.
I'm not worried about Te'o. He's got all that Nigerian prince money to fall back on.
I'm so disillusioned that I would only be mildly surprised if Lance was Lennay. Ya know, like Einhorn and Finkle.
I'm sure this is all somehow Calipari's fault
Who was on the phone all night?!
The worst part? Manti told me he couldn't go out wih me because he wasn't over Lennay. That hurts, bro
I can't believe Mr. Drummond died. You have to bury him, Arnold. Can't flush him like Abraham Lincoln (the goldfish).
Thank you, Lord. I swear Jimmy Dykes just said Archie got "too high" for a dunk. A real-life Major League moment. Too high?

Tonight I've heard Bobby Knight compliment Kentucky and a referee. It's like watching the Grinch's heart grow. Or an antidepressant ad.
@AshleyJudd what is happening in Nashville?!
Cats' effort disturbing but less so than Knight's. The big kid? Do your research, coach. His name is Willie.
Actually, Judd's presence at the game in Nashville only reminds fans that she lives in Tennessee. Still, go Cats!!!
Ashley Judd is at the Kentucky game. That definitely means she's running for the Senate. Or, you know, it doesn't mean anything at all.
