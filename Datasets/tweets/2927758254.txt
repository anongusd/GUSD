@Speckle48 If you have more questions, we're happy to help. Email hello@houseparty.com
@Speckle48 Locking a room means friends cannot just ‚Äòjoin‚Äô the party, they have to be invited by someone inside. Anyone in a locked room has the ability to invite people, or unlock the room. Switching on ‚ÄúPrivate Mode‚Äù in the app locks rooms by default.
@Speckle48 Hi! On Houseparty there are no ‚Äústrangers‚Äù - everyone you speak to is either a confirmed friend of yours, or a confirmed friend-of-a-friend. So, it‚Äôs important your daughter understands who she adds.
