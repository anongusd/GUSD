It has also struggled so far to meet the hiring targets that were part of the deal.
The state's Republican former Governor Scott Walker -- a vocal supporter of the plant -- was defeated late last year by a Democrat who said that the huge tax breaks offered to Foxconn risked negating the jobs it created in the state.
Its Wisconsin investment has not been without controversy.
The world's largest contract-electronics manufacturer assembles most of its products on the Chinese mainland but many of its high-tech gadgets are bought by consumers in the United States, leaving it acutely vulnerable to Trump's tariffs.
Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, is one of many key tech companies who find themselves buffeted by the trade war.
"While it's encouraging Foxconn will bring 13,000 new jobs and billions of dollars to Wisconsin, we would be disappointed by (any) reductions to the initial investment."
While Trump has not responded to the Foxconn announcement CNN quoted an official as saying: "The president has created one of the strongest business climates in American history because he lowered taxes and massively cut regulations.
Foxconn's announcement also comes with the US economy showing signs of slowing just as campaigning for the 2020 election gears up, with the state of Wisconsin a key battleground.
However, the latest news could dent the image he likes to project of the dealer-in-chief who can deliver, and comes soon after he backed down in his standoff with Democrats over his Mexican border wall in a dispute that closed the government for a month.
Trump came to power on the back of his "America First" promise to revitalise US manufacturing and create millions of jobs, crucially wooing blue-collar workers.
Woo also told Bloomberg there was "no scrapping of our plans".		But he added: "Given global economic conditions and the trade tensions between China and the US... it's impossible that we can always stay committed to our original plan without any change."
It added that "in addition to our consideration of plans to produce traditional products such as television sets" the company was also examining ways for Wisconsin's "knowledge workers" to promote research and development and produce "high-tech applications and solutions".
In its statement, Foxconn said it remained committed to building its science park in Wisconsin and "the creation of 13,000 jobs".
Earlier media reports quoted Louis Woo, an assistant to Gou, suggesting the company might scrap the flat screen factory in favour of hiring more high-skilled engineers for research and development -- a move that would lead to far fewer blue-collar jobs.
"The global market environment that existed when the project was first announced has changed. As our plans are driven by those of our customers, this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin," Foxconn said in a statement on Thursday.
But the global economic climate -- roiled by Trump's trade war with China where Foxconn has most of its assembly lines -- has led officials at the Taiwanese company to look again at the original plans.
A year later he appeared alongside Foxconn CEO Terry Gou at a groundbreaking ceremony wielding a golden shovel and proclaiming: "This is just the beginning. This is one of the largest plants in the world."
The investment was backed by $4 billion in controversial tax breaks and embraced by Trump, who hailed the deal when it was announced in 2017 as evidence of his "America First" plan in action.
Foxconn, which makes devices and components for a host of major tech firms including Apple, had planned to build the $10 billion plant to make LCD flat screen televisions and create around 13,000 jobs.
Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn said Thursday it was reassessing plans to build a cutting-edge factory in Wisconsin, potentially dealing a blow to Donald Trump's flagship drive to revive America's manufacturing sector.

In recent years, Iranian scientists have made remarkable progress in the field of peaceful nuclear technology despite the sanctions imposed by the West.		It is the 12th year Iran is celebrating a national day to mark its achievements in the nuclear industry.
The UCF in Isfahan is now working with full capacity, he added.		Salehi noted that Iran extracts uranium-rich material from Saghand-1 and Saghand-2 mines to produce yellow cake.
Speaking at a nuclear factory in the city of Ardakan in the central province of Yazd on Wednesday, Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi said the 30-ton shipment of yellow cake produced in Ardakan was transferred to Isfahan UCF.
A fresh shipment of yellow cake (a type of uranium concentrate powder) weighing 30 tons was transferred to a Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) in Iran’s central city of Isfahan, the country’s nuclear chief said.

@thehill The Hill notes. “Crowley, a Queens powerbroker and affable House Democratic Caucus chairman, had been considered a possible future Speaker.”
@thehill “The New York delegation has eyed Ocasio-Cortez with skepticism ever since last summer when the 29-year-old self-described democratic socialist shocked the political world and defeated then-Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in what many thought would be a sleepy primary race,”
@thehill “You’ve got numerous council people and state legislators who’ve been waiting 20 years for that seat. I’m sure they can find numerous people who want that seat in that district.”
@thehill “What I have recommended to the New York delegation is that you find her a primary opponent and make her a one-term congressperson,” an anonymous Democratic lawmaker told The Hill.
Russia, along with a number of other nations, continue to recognise Nicolas Maduro, who won the recent national elections, as the only legitimate leader of the country.
Venezuela is currently facing a political crisis and large anti-government protests. Opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared himself the country's interim president, drawing support from the United States.
he said.
"Together with other responsible members of the international community, we will do everything to support President Maduro's legitimate government in upholding the Venezuelan Constitution and employing methods to resolve the crisis that are within the constitutional framework",
Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia "will do everything" within a constitutional framework to support President Maduro.
The Finance Ministry later issued a statement saying Venezuela is due to make its next payment at the end of March and no changes have been made to the debt agreement.
The rumours may have been sparked by an earlier statement from Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak, who said Russia expects Venezuela to have problems servicing the state's debt as a result of the political crisis.
"I'm going to start bringing Russian and Turkish airplanes every week so everybody gets scared", he joked in an interview for Bloomberg.
Simon Zerpa, Venezuela's finance minister, denied a Russian plane has been parked at the Simon Bolivar International Airport in Caracas.
Other rumours said the plane actually carried mercenaries sent to support President Maduro, but there is no evidence to support those claims, Fox News reported.
An image of the Nordwind Airlines plane has been posted by Noticias Venezuela, a local news outlet. https://t.co/fPqGP793vu
The source alleged that more than $840 million worth of gold has already been prepared for loading onto a plane.
The report cites a tweet by an unnamed Venezuelan official who was later identified as a former economist in the country's central bank with ties to the bank's employees.
According to the earlier Fox News report, a Nordwind Airlines Boeing 777 allegedly made a trip from Moscow to Caracas, where it was parked "in a private corner of the airport". The report says the plane, capable of carrying some 400 passengers only had its crew onboard.
Talking to journalists, Peskov urged them to "be careful with different hoaxes".
"Russia is prepared to help resolve the political situation [in Venezuela] in any way possible, without interfering into the country's internal affairs", Peskov was quoted as saying by the Russian media.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he is unaware of Moscow's plans to bring Venezuelan gold to Moscow. Rumours alleging Russia had sent a secret plane to take 20 tonnes of Venezuelan gold had been reported by Fox News earlier on Wednesday.
Earlier rumours alleged that a mysterious plane had gone to Caracas either to bring in Russian mercenaries, to evacuate President Maduro or to take $840 million worth of Venezuelan gold.

It said: “The person who created the webpage used their knowledge of the non-sensitive discovery to make it appear as though the irrelevant files contained on the webpage were the sum total evidence of ‘IRA and Russian collusion’ ... https://t.co/iH8JX8d2Uh
The filing argued that attorneys for Concord should not be given access to “sensitive” evidence gathered by Mueller’s team for the case.
Mueller disclosed the leak in a filing as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Russia’s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA).
FBI investigators had found no evidence that government servers holding the data had been hacked, according to Mueller’s team, pointing instead to a leak on the Russian side.
The prosecutors said the filesharing site had confirmed to the FBI that the account which posted the material was registered from an IP address – an identifier for devices connected to the internet – in Russia.
Mueller’s court filing on Wednesday said the names and structure of folders containing the leaked files matched those used by Mueller’s office when it shared the data, and that these had not been made public.
The tweet was posted in October last year by the account @HackingRedstone, according to the filing. A reporter was also offered leaked material via a direct message the same day. The account has since been removed from Twitter.
“We’ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller’s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case,” a tweet from the account said. “You can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!”
A court filing by Mueller’s office said more than 1,000 files that it shared confidentially with attorneys for indicted Russian hackers later appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site and promoted by a Twitter account.
Evidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow’s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

Moreover, the Arabic-language RT quoted some media activists as saying that the Syrian security forces have also defused a second bomb plot and they are chasing the terrorists.
Meantime, the Syrian State-Run news agency reported that a terrorist has been arrested in connection to the foiled terrorist attack.
The Arabic-language al-Mayadeen TV network announced that an explosive package was seized from the terrorists and defused it through controlled detonation in Southern Al-Motehalaq region in the outskirts of Damascus.
The terrorists tried to explode a parcel in Southern al-Motehaleq near a Syrian Army military point in the suburbs of Damascus, but the Syrian Army foiled their attempt, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.
On Sunday morning, the Syrian security forces foiled a terrorist attack in the outskirts of Damascus.
The Sham Times news website quoted a military analyst as saying that there is a link between the Israeli airstrikes and terrorist attacks in the outskirts of Damascus which took place earlier today.
The source went on say that the Syrian army's air defenses destroyed all the seven missiles fired by Israel.
The Arabic-language service of Al-Mayadeen news network reported that four Israeli fighter jets fired missiles towards Damascus through Lebanon.		The Russian Defense Ministry also announced that Israel's attack on Damascus Airport did not leave any casualties or losses.
Pointing to the tensions in Quneitra Front after Israel's failed attack on Damascus suburbs today, they reiterated that the battlefield was the scene of missile exchanges between Syria and Israel.
The sources noted that the Israeli fighter jets were continuously and intensely flying over the Occupied Golan Heights concurrent with the attacks.
Meantime, the Arabic-language service of Russian Sputnik news agency quoted local sources as saying that the Syrian Army's air defense shield has repelled attacks by Israel on targets near Talol al-Ahmar East of the town of Hazar South of Damascus and North of Quneitra province.
Other reports said that the missiles were fired by Israeli fighter jets flying in Southern Lebanon's air space.
The Syrian air defenses managed to intercept all the seven Israeli missiles, while some reports said the Syrian army shot down six missiles and the seventh missile went astray and landed in a farm in rural areas.

All roads leading to and from the scene have been closed. Such attacks have become a rare sight in the Syrian capital after government forces reclaimed the last rebel-held areas of the city in 2018.
There is no exact information on the potential casualties. Authorities said the attack targeted a military checkpoint in the area and that a second attack was prevented by security forces shortly afterwards.

Speaker Pelosi was quick to say Democrats would reject the deal, even before Trump made his official announcement.
President Donald Trump wants $5.7 billion for a border wall along the United States-Mexico border. On Saturday, he offered to give Democrats protections for DREAMers, those illegal aliens who were brought America when they were a child, in exchange for border security.
"We have set a goal to send 100,000 BRICKS to their offices to prove that WALLS WORK!" Trump's campaign website states.
Each brick contains facts about “the crime, drugs, and human trafficking that result from open borders," Parcale said.		One of the campaign's goals is to get 100,000 bricks sent to Pelosi and Schumer.
“Since Chuck and Nancy keep stonewalling the president, we’ll send the wall to them, brick by brick, until they agree to secure the border,” Parscale told Fox News.
But according to Trump's campaign manager, @Parscale, this isn't just a fundraising tactic. It's also a way for the president to push his agenda.
“Weeks after the Democrats began stonewalling President Trump in his fight to secure our border, the American people now have a chance to send a clear message to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi about the need to build the wall,” a fundraising email sent Friday read.
President Donald Trump's 2020 team has found a rather clever way to cash in on the border wall debate. Supporters who want a wall can now pay $20.20 to have a fake brick sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

Türkiye, tercihen bu konuda Rusya, İran ve Suriye ile birlikte hareket etmelidir. Ancak bu yönde alınan mesafe yetersiz ise Türkiye tek başına da harekete geçecek güçtedir.
Türkiye fazla geç kalmadan kendi oyununu sahneye koymalıdır. Çünkü büyük bir askeri güce dönüştürülen PKK nötralize edilmezse, Türkiye için her zaman, hem Suriye’de hem de Irak’ta büyük bir tehdit olur.
Bir önceki Başkan Obama ve Dışişleri Bakanı John Kerry de, IŞİD ve El Nusra’nın müştereken vurulması için Rusya ile anlaşma yapmış ama ABD derin devleti Suriye ordusuna saldırarak, bu anlaşmayı fiilen sahada bozmuştu.
Bu nedenle ABD’nin yaptığı her uluslararası anlaşma, her an yürürlükten kaldırılabilir. Verdiği sözlerin zaten hiçbir kıymet-i harbiyesi yoktur.
ABD’de gücün kimin elinde olduğu belli değildir. Bu ülke içinde kıyasıya güç mücadelesi devam etmektedir. Başkan Trump’un yönetim üzerinde mutlak bir hâkimiyeti yoktur. Masaya yumruğunu vurarak söylediğini yaptırma gücü de yoktur.
Her gün bir yetkili açıklama yaparak çekilme sürecini bilmeceye dönüştürdü. Bu açıklamalarda, “PKK’nın Kürtlerle özdeşleşmesi ve Türkiye’nin durdurulması”öne çıkarıldı.
Beklendiği gibi, geçen her gün yeni dengeleri ortaya çıkardı. Bölgedeki aktörler inisiyatifi ele geçirmek için girişimlerde bulundu. İlk şaşkınlığı üzerinden atan ABD derin devleti devreye girdi. Trump üzerinde baskı kurarak, çekilme kararını sulandırdı.
Koşulların sonsuza dek aynı kalacağını sananlar yanılgı içindedir. Talih kuşu insanın başına bir kez konar. Koşullar olgunlaştığında harekete geçmeyenler, başkalarının zaferini seyreder.
ABD’deki iç tartışmalar Türkiye’yi ilgilendirmez! Stratejinin zaman, mekân ve kuvvet olmak üzere üç boyutu vardır. Zaman boyutu bu özel durumda öne çıkmaktadır. Harekât gecikirse yeni dengeler oluşabilir.
Türkiye Fırat’ın doğusundaki harekâta bir an önce başlamalıdır. ABD derin devletinin Başkan Obama ve Başkan Trump’a benzer birçok konuda geri adım attırdığı unutulmamalıdır.
Bu tehdit şimdi Doğu Akdeniz’de yoğunlaşıyor. Bu nedenlerle Türkiye’nin önündeki süreçte Amerika’ya direnmesi bir mecburiyet
Türkiye Amerika’nın dayattığı ekonomi yüzünden borç batağında ve yine Türkiye’yi bölme tehdidi ABD ve İsrail’den geliyor.
Bunun için Suriye hükümeti ve Suriye Devletinin Ordusuyla derhal işbirliğine geçilmelidir.
Türkiye Hükümeti, Kuzey Irak’ta başarı kazanmış olan modeli, hem Suriye’nin kuzeyinde, hem de Doğu Akdeniz’de uygulamak durumundadır.
Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri, Fırat’ın doğusunda ve Menbiç’te PKK ve DEAŞ teröristlerini temizleyecek güce sahiptir. Türkiye’nin kararlılığına ABD’nin karşı koyma yeteneği yoktur. ‘’
Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri, PKK Terör Örgütünü sınır ötesinde bitirecektir. Türkiye ve Suriye başta olmak üzere bölge ülkeleri, ABD emperyalizminin ve İsrail’in “Kürt özerk bölgesi” adı altında İkinci İsrail kurmasına izin vermeyecektir.
"Türkiye’nin kararlılığına ABD’nin karşı koyma yeteneği yoktur."
İran’a uygulanan ambargoya karşı kararlı mücadele ediyoruz. Türkiye-İran dostluğunu bölgenin ve ülkelerimizin geleceği bakımından yaşamsal önemde görüyoruz.
İran’ın ABD-İsrail güdümlü teröre karşı mücadelesi elbette İran’a yönelik baskıları beraberinde getiriyor.
Bölgesel işbirliğinin sonucunda ABD gidiyor, PKK bitiyor. Suriye’nin toprak bütünlüğü hepimizin ortak işi
Bugün, Türkiye ile Suriye arasındaki işbirliğini her alanda geliştirmek anahtar değerdedir.
Bölgenin geleceğini ancak Türkiye, Suriye, İran ve Irak beraberliği belirleyebilir.
RT @RT_Erdogan: 31 Mart’ta milletimizin kazanımlarına sahip çıkmaya ve AK Parti’nin hizmet bayrağını dalgalandırarak 2023 hedeflerimiz doğr…
Anahtar Değer: Türkiye-Suriye İş Birliği @RT_Erdogan
Bence parti dışında kalması daha faydalı olacaktır."
Meclis dağılımı değişecek, Erdoğan topal ördek olacak.		Erken seçim sonucunda yeniden AB adayı, yeni bir Türkiye tasarlanacak.		Tek bilmediğim; @Ahmet_Davutoglu içeride mi yoksa dışarıda mı görev alacak?
Ali Babacan, Mehmet Şimşek, Cemil Çiçek, Hüseyin Çelik, dışarıdan bir çok sosyal demokrat, Liberal, merkez sağcı, Kürt bir araya gelecek ve yeni iktidar partisi kurulmuş olacak.
Yani; "Erdoğan başarısız" sözünü kendilerinin değil, seçmenin söyleyeceği ânı bekliyorlar.		İşte o gün önce Saadet Partisi'nin ismini değiştirecekler, sonra Gül lider olacak.
İkinci olarak; seçim öncesi girilen 'seçim ekonomisi'nin etkilerinin 1 Nisan'dan itibaren, bu güne kadar hiç yaşanmamış gerçek bir ekonomik çöküş yaratacağını biliyorlar.
Şöyle;		AK Parti'nin yerel seçimlere kadar doğal yıpranma yaşayacağını, bir kısım seçmeninin zaten kopmuş olacağını öngörüyorlar.
Gül ve ekibi, Ak Parti ve Erdoğan'ı doğrudan hedef alarak yıkmaya çalışmıyor; Erdoğan'ın şeytanlaştırma kabiliyeti yüksek ve onlar AK Parti seçmenine düşman olarak siyasette şanslarının olmadığını biliyorlar ve bu yüzden hazırlık 31 Mart için değil, 1 Nisan için yapılıyor
İşte, en önemli konu bu.		Bence bu akıl, @cbabdullahgul ve onun çevresi.		Amaç ne?
Bu üçünü birden Milli Görüş'e kim hibe edebildi?
Peki bu parayı, insan kaynağını ve değişimi sağlayan akıl kim?
Para ile insan kaynağı çözülmüş, bu belli.
Bu değişimin ana taşıyıcısı olmalı.		1- Para		2- İnsan kaynağı		3- Yeni bir akıl
Seçkin konular ve konuklar, Milli Görüş'ü, uç noktalarda olmayan herkesin evine, aklına sokacak gibi görünüyor.
Belli ki Milli Görüş'ün yüzü, Milli Görüş'ün paradigmalarını değiştirecek.
Ama asıl gözlemlediğim, büyük bir paradigma değişimi.
Elbette bunlar para akışı ile kolaylıkla yapılabilecek işler.
Hepsinde büyük bir profesyonelleşme fark ediliyor.
Örneğin yenilenen kadro, stüdyolar, görüntü ve ses kalitesi...
Birkaç zamandır izliyor, gözlemliyorum TV5'te çok büyük değişiklikler var.
Biz fark etmeyenler için yazalım.
Dikkatli gözler mutlaka fark etmiştir.
TV5'te başlayan yenilenme süreci, Türk sağında pek yakında ortaya çıkacak yeni gelişmelere ışık tutuyor.
Rusya'da halkın en güvendiği siyasetçinin Devlet Başkanı #VladimirPutin olduğu ortaya çıktı. Putin'in icraatlarına ise halkın yüzde 62.1'i destek verdi.
Bu nedenlerle Çin’in toprak bütünlüğü, yalnız Türkiye için değil, Uygurların insanca yaşamaları için de yaşamsal önemdedir.		#Türkiye, bağımsızlık ve güvenliği esas almaktadır ve dünyanın her yerinde mazlumların yanındadır.
Bu denklemi kurmazsak, ne Suriye’nin ve Irak’ın kuzeyinde ne de Doğu Akdeniz’de güvenliğimizi sağlayamayız. İşte o zaman zalimin yanında olmanın ne gibi sonuçlar doğurduğunu görürüz. Ama pişmanlık fayda vermez.
Cumhurbaşkanı Tayyip Erdoğan, TBMM Başkanı Binali Yıldırım ve Dışişleri Bakanı Mevlut Çavuşoğlu’nun da saptadıkları üzere, Bugünkü dünya koşullarında Türkiye’nin güvenliği Çin’den başlar. Çin’in güvenliği de Türkiye’den başlar.
Çin’de hak ve eşitlik mücadelesi terörle yürütülürse, Çin devletinin yaptırım gücü kullanmasına davet çıkarılır.
Hiç kimse, ABD planları içinde rol üstlenerek, Çin Halk Cumhuriyeti’nde Uygurların hak ve eşitliğini savunamaz. Tam tersine Uygurları terör faaliyetine iterek, acıların yaşanmasına hizmet eder.
Doğu Türkistan İslâmî Hareketi’nin terör faaliyetini destekleyenler, ABD emperyalizminin kışkırtmalarına ve siyasetlerine hizmet ediyorlar.
#Nazi lideri #Hitler de, Sovyetler Birliği’nde yaşayan Türk ve Müslüman halkları, “sizleri zulümden kurtaracağız” diye kendi zulmüne alet edebildi. O nedenle bilinçsiz duygular ve bilgisiz samimiyet, insanları zalimlerin oyuncağı olmaktan kurtaramıyor.
Zalimin ya da mazlumun yanında olmak, kışkırtılmış duygularla olmaz. Mazlumun yanında olmak, bilimin, bilginin, bilincin işidir. Ne var ki insanlar tarih boyunca zalimlere “samimiyetle” de hizmet etmişlerdir.
Amerikalı, Avrupalı ya da başka kıtaların insanları, PKK’yı “Mazlumların yanındayız” diye destekliyorlar. Yine yeryüzünde birçok insan, mazlumlara el uzatmak adına “Ermeni soykırımı” yalanına alet oluyorlar.
ABD zulmüne alet olanlar, dünyanın her yerinde “Mazlumun yanında olma” perdesi altına gizleniyorlar. PKK terör örgütü, bütün dünyada insanları “Mazlumların yanında olmak” adına avlıyor.
Türkiye’de veya Çin’de ya da başka bir ülkede, hiç kimse ABD planlarına alet olarak mazlumların yanında olmaz.
Uygur kardeşlerimizin yanındayız.		Türkiye-Çin dostluğu da, zulme karşı dostluk ve işbirliğidir.		ABD emperyalizminin kışkırtmalarına alet olanlar, Uygurları savunmuyor, Uygurların iyiliğine hareket etmiyorlar. Tam tersine ABD emperyalizminin zulmüne hizmet ediyorlar.
PKK ile Doğu Türkistan İslâmi Hareketi arasındaki dayanışma işte bu ABD planı çerçevesindedir.
Bu girişim, aynı zamanda Türkiye ile Azerbaycan ve Orta Asya Cumhuriyetleri arasındaki yolu da kesiyor.
Haritaya iyi bakınız, ABD’nin sözde Doğu Türkistan ve Kürdistan planı, Türkiye ile Çin’i birleştiren yolu kesiyor.
Çin’in “Bir Kuşak Bir Yol Projesi”, Çin ve Türkiye’yi birleştiren bir ekonomik işbirliği ve barış projesidir.
Zamanlamaya da dikkat ediniz, ne zaman Türkiye-Çin işbirliği yönünde adımlar atılsa, Türkiye’de “Çin zulmü” kampanyası sahneleniyor. Bu kampanyayı CIA’nın ve FETÖ’nün örgütlediğini gelişmeleri izleyen herkes görüyor.
Bu gerçekler karşısında, Uygurlar adına girişilen terör hareketleri, ABD denetimindedir ve yalnız Çin’i değil, Türkiye’yi de hedef alıyor.
PKK, yayınladığı açıklamalarda, açıkça “Doğu Türkistan İslâmî Hareketi’nin Çin’de yaptığı eylemleri destekliyor.
En son TBMM Başkanlığına verilen “Çin zulmünü” araştırma önergesinde, İyi Parti ve CHP milletvekilleri HDP/PKK ile birlikte oy verdiler. Önerge AK Parti’nin karşıt ve MHP’nin çekimser oylarıyla reddedildi.
Sözde “Doğu Türkistan” Terör Örgütü, ABD kumandası altında Türkiye’ye karşı savaşıyor ve aynı zamanda PKK ile işbirliği halindedir.
Doğu Türkistan İslâmi Hareketi, Birleşmiş Milletlerin terör örgütleri listesindedir.
Sözde “Doğu Türkistan” terör örgütü mensupları, Türk Ordusuna karşı savaşırken zalimlere alet oluyor da, Çin’de terör eylemlerine gönderilince “mazlum” mu oluyor.
Sözde “Doğu Türkistan” terör örgütü mensupları, Suriye ve Irak’ta Türk Ordusuna karşı savaşırken terörist oluyor da, Çin’e gidince “kurtuluş savaşçısı” mı oluyorlar.
O savaşta 2000’nin üzerinde DEAŞ mensubu öldürüldü, aralarında Uygur kökenli teröristler de vardı, Türkiye’den giden teröristler de vardı.
DEAŞ içinde Türkiye kökenli teröristler de var. 24 Ağustos 2016 tarihinde başlayan Fırat Kalkanı Harekâtı sırasında Doğu Türkistan İslâmi Hareketi teröristleri, DEAŞ kumandası altında Türk Ordusuna karşı savaştılar.
“Doğu Türkistan” adına yapılan terörü desteklemek, Mehmetçiğe kurşun sıkanları desteklemektir. Doğu Türkistan İslâmi Hareketi mensubu, Uygur kökenli 15 bin terörist, DEAŞ saflarında savaşıyor.
Birincisi, Türkiye’yi savunuyoruz. Türklükle ve İslâmla ilgisi olmayan “Doğu Türkistan İslâmî Hareketi” adındaki terör örgütünü desteklediğiniz zaman, Uygurlarla dayanışma içinde olmazsınız, ama ABD emperyalizminin Türkiye’yi hedef alan bölücü tertiplerinde oyuncak olursunuz.
“Lütfen Çin’i savunmaktan vazgeçin. Tarih boyunca sürekli bize ihanet eden komünist bir ülke için soydaşlarımızı görmezden gelmeyin. Biz Türk milletiyiz nerde mazlum, zulme uğrayan biri varsa biz orada olmalıyız. Ayrıştırıcı diliniz insanları kötü etkiliyor.”
Bir arkadaşımız şöyle  yazmış:
SURİYE’deki Güvenli Bölge olayı tamamen illüzyon yani yutturma. Şahidim Devlet Bahçeli! O bile bu hadiseye, “Barzani modeli” diyor ki malum MHP Başkanı, iktidar şakşakçısı. Hal bu iken Güvenli Bölgeyi kabullenmek aslında PKKistan’ı onaylamak demektir.
CHP’den koparan Tuncay Özkan için. Ne mi diyorlar? Milyonda bir ihtimal bile olsa Tuncay’ın İzmir’e Belediye Başkan adayı yapılması durumunda şehre sokmayacaklarını söylüyorlar. Vallahi haklılar, zira tersi olsa bunun adı CHP’lilerin #Atatürk’e ihaneti olur.
İzmir, Tuncay’a karşı ayakta!		#İZMİR’deki gerçek CHP’lilerin mesaj sağanağı altındayım, niye mi? İhlas Patronu Enver Ören için yazdığı kitabı iki milyon dolar para karşılığı yakan, televizyonunu Fetullah’a satan ve binlerce Atatürkçüyü “Biz Kaç Kişiyiz” diyerek...
...  vallahi hukukla başım derde girer. Peki ne oldu da o gün hücum ettiğin Tayyip’e şimdi selam durursun Numan bey? Bir bakanlık için değer mi, değiyor mu? Demek ki Oğuzhan Asiltürk ile Temel Karamollaoğlu’lar çok ama çok haklı imişler zira senin davan kişisel ikbal imiş!..

@JudgeJeanine Judge Jeanine Pirro: Trump is ready to negotiate but if Dems won't, it's time to declare a national emergency | Fox News https://t.co/aiaftXF76i
The president has been sitting in the Oval Office since Christmas Eve. He's ready. If the Democrats aren’t coming to the table, the time to declare a national emergency is now.
... from Africa, Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and more is a national emergency, then you're out and out crazy!
And if you don’t think another caravan of thousands moving in a highly- organized fashion similar to military convoys with an advance party, a main body and a rear party, that has exhibited violence along the way with migrants in addition to those from Central America ...
@parscale So the only question now is whether or not this is a national emergency
@parscale Assume they will win but on an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, they will lose under Youngstown.
@parscale Now expect the Democrats to go forum shopping in California where the appeal goes directly to the liberal Ninth Circus aka Ninth Circut -- if the president declares an emergency using the military construction funds.
@parscale Now clearly, the $13.1 billion should be the line used since I doubt we need to build homes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
@parscale The only serious source of funds is in the military construction bill.		This week there was some debate whether that money would come from a line item of $13.1 billion dollars -- covering housing in Afghanistan and Iraq, or a $13.9 billion line for disaster relief.
@parscale The critical operational issue is that only money already authorized and appropriated by Congress can be spent.
@parscale I have a solution.		There is no question that President Trump has the “authority” to declare a national emergency.  The controlling case is Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube v. Sawyer 343 U.S. 579.
@parscale Curiously, some Democrats are peeling away from the rigid non-negotiable stance of Nancy Pelosi. They include Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sen. Angus King of Maine, Sen. Jeff Merkeley of Oregon, Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland.
@parscale In spite of his negotiations, the Democrats refuse to budge.
@parscale He’s made concessions from $25 billion to $5 billion.		From a concrete barrier to a steel one.		He’s promising more personnel, detention beds, using technology and electronics to buttress the security and money to address the humanitarian needs.
@parscale The president has shown he is capable of negotiating. He has gone from a concrete wall to a steel slat barrier... He’s willing to go with any barrier -- any physical barrier that you cannot climb over, crawl under, rappel, or shoot yourself out of a cannon over.
@parscale And Friday there were reports that an even larger caravan is staging in Honduras about to cause an even greater burden on our border patrol and the system.
@parscale Yet they refuse to negotiate, sit for serious talks, or work for the safety and security of the American people.		Their mantra? There is no crisis at our open porous borders.		Their goal? Destroy Donald Trump.

As the Turkish people mourn the dead, nurture the wounded and take pride in what we accomplished together, they also demand justice, closure and reassurances that never again shall we witness such a crisis.
Today, the people of Turkey are more united than at any time in recent history. In any democracy, citizens are bound to disagree. But our nation’s response to the July 15 assault proved that democracy, freedom and the rule of law are nonnegotiable in Turkey.
A due legal process will establish his role in this failed rebellion. It does not make sense for any country to condemn the coup without taking action against the lead putschist.
Fethullah Gulen’s claim that he has had nothing to do with this coup attempt is as credible as his claim that he has had nothing to do with hundreds of Gulenist schools, banks, companies and media outlets that operate under his direct orders.
The United States should not let this man exploit its laws to avoid facing a fair and legitimate accounting in Turkey.
Turkey has already provided a number of legal documents to American authorities and will send more as further evidence is collected.
The United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish citizen, to Turkey, as is allowed under an existing treaty.
They own a number of charter schools and companies across America and have been accused of engaging in financial fraud and violating immigration and campaign finance laws.
Since the 1980s, the Gulenists, a religious cult whose members present themselves as peaceful educators, have always had a dark side.

BMW recalled some 172,000 vehicles in July and October over the fires it has blamed on a faulty exhaust gas component. The company said there had been no reports of injuries linked to the fires.	BMW’s South Korean unit didn’t immediately comment on the ministry’s announcement. https://t.co/YuI0RWl4cm
South Korea’s Transport Ministry said Monday its investigation panel after a five-month review concluded that the German automaker deliberately tried to cover up technical problems and moved too slowly to recall vehicles after around 40 of its cars caught fire earlier this year.
South Korea says it will fine BMW 11.2 billion won ($9.9 million) and file a criminal complaint against the company with state prosecutors over an allegedly botched response to dozens of engine fires reported in the country.
