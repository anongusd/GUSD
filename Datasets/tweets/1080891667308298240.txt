#MedicareforAll will ensure ever Mainer and every American has affordable healthcare, because an equal chance at a healthy life should be a right, not a privilege. Every other developed nation in the world has a universal healthcare system. We can do it too. 9/ https://t.co/xpIzv88xLX
Almost 30 million Americans are uninsured. 40 million more can‚Äôt afford their insurance. There‚Äôs no doubt our system is broken, so let‚Äôs fix it. Change won't happen overnight, but pushing for #MedicareforAll is the right thing to do and the right direction for our country 8/ https://t.co/9b230gSGdR
Even with these changes, our current healthcare system can't guarantee every Mainer quality healthcare they can afford. We have to be bold &amp; change the system to get universal coverage in America. 		That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm cosponsoring #MedicareforAll as part of my healthcare roadmap. 7/ https://t.co/GD1TOPW1ve
But we also need to start thinking bigger on healthcare. Our roadmap includes a plan to allow Mainers over 50 to buy into Medicare. The bill would provide 145K people in our state with affordable, quality healthcare coverage. 		That's a big deal for an older state like Maine. 6/ https://t.co/xBAM0j8W1m
I‚Äôve been outspoken about skyrocketing Rx drug costs.

The president is wrong to use his authority to declare a nat'l emergency. The sky isn't falling and most Americans don‚Äôt buy his rhetoric. Instead, we should fix our immigration system and strengthen our borders with bipartisan deals like the compromise bill we'll pass today 2/

We need common-sense solutions to lower healthcare costs. Addressing the rising cost of Rx drugs is a step we can take right now. 		Today, I introduced the FLAT Prices Act to help prevent abusive drug companies from jacking up drug prices on the American people. #mepolitics https://t.co/krxR9U23pc
How do corporations get away with this? 		When they develop a new drug, the gov‚Äôt gives Rx companies a years-long monopoly. They can skyrocket prices with no competition. It‚Äôs a system intended to promote R&amp;D, but many pharma companies abuse it on the backs of Maine people.
Rx drug prices have been out of control for years, but in 2016 we saw just how abusive drug companies had become. In the space of 9 years, amid record profits, Mylan shot its prices for the life-saving allergy drug Epipen up by 400% https://t.co/lJAJ9deuc8
Higher Rx drug prices are one of the biggest drivers of rising healthcare costs. Maine people spend at least twice as much on prescription drugs as we did thirty years ago. 		Democrats, Republicans, and everyone in between agrees: this is a problem &amp; we need to fix it. https://t.co/RrQ0Xc1IK7
I met with the Maine Medical Association to discuss how we can make healthcare more affordable for Maine people. 		One thing I brought up: the cost of prescription drugs.

Heading into tonight's #SOTU2019, I was looking for areas where I could work with the president to get things done for Maine people. 		Here's what I took from the speech: https://t.co/aiZBndInrh 		#MEpolitics
We‚Äôre hearing the president will call for both parties to put aside their differences &amp; come together. I welcome that message, but he has to back it up with leadership. We need to see concrete proposals from @POTUS and willingness to work with both parties to get this done 11/
That‚Äôs why Maine needs strong federal funding to build infrastructure that grows our economy, creates good jobs, &amp; connects our businesses and homes. I‚Äôll be listening for @POTUS to seize the moment, work across the aisle, and outline a real infrastructure plan. #mepolitics 10/
Here‚Äôs the thing: Maine isn‚Äôt NY or CA and we‚Äôre more than 90% small biz. An infrastructure plan that requires private investment and lots of state and local gov‚Äôt $$$ won‚Äôt work here. #mepolitics 9/
Investing in infrastructure is huge for #ME02. We‚Äôre 1 of the most rural districts in the US, &amp; we‚Äôre the biggest east of the Mississippi. Bad roads, bridges, rail, &amp; poor broadband internet access quite literally hold our families, workers, &amp; businesses back. #mepolitics 8/
Here‚Äôs another area where I want to work with the president: INFRASTRUCTURE. There‚Äôs a real opportunity here for both parties to work together with @POTUS and get something done for Mainers. Few states would benefit more from better roads, bridges, etc than Maine. #mepolitics 7/
I‚Äôll work with @POTUS when his policies help Mainers, but I‚Äôll fight back when his policies hurt our state. I‚Äôll work with the president to overhaul NAFTA if he's serious about protecting Maine jobs, but this deal comes up short. 6/ #mepolitics #replaceNAFTA https://t.co/41aiZiIWpA
.@POTUS' NAFTA 2.0 must be changed to do more to keep good jobs in Maine and increase wages. And trade deals aren‚Äôt worth the paper they‚Äôre written on if other countries don‚Äôt play by the rules, so we need stronger enforcement provisions. #mepolitics 5/
The president‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0 proposal appears to be more of the same. It looks like a new paint job on the old NAFTA, not the meaningful change we need. Too many Maine communities know where this path leads: closed mills, outsourcing, and low wage jobs. #mepolitics 4/
One thing Cynthia &amp; I have been talking about: the president's #NAFTA plans. We agree with @POTUS that NAFTA's a bad deal for American workers.		NAFTA's been a disaster for Maine's working folks. It needs a full overhaul that addresses the agreement‚Äôs root problems #mepolitics 3/

We‚Äôre open in the County! We‚Äôre here to listen to and work for you, so come on by. 		7 Hatch Drive in Caribou. https://t.co/scpf9WOX0g
Especially during a gov't shutdown, your elected leaders should be open &amp; accessible. I'm here to listen &amp; work with you. It's what Mainers want &amp; it's necessary for democracy to work.		We welcomed Mainers into our open house in Lewiston this weekend. It's just the beginning! https://t.co/CL3sre6zMl
Come join me for coffee tomorrow from 9-10 AM at 179 Lisbon St. in Lewiston.		I'll be there to meet folks, listen, and talk about the work we're doing to end the shutdown and open the government.
It‚Äôs unacceptable for Coast Guardsmen and their families to go through hard times because of a manufactured shutdown crisis. We need real, effective solutions to open the gov't and secure the border. We can do that without an unrealistic, ineffective wall	https://t.co/LT3tQgafN9
Yesterday, my staff and I opened the doors of our Lewiston office and talked with whoever walked in. It was great. 		One thing I heard loud and clear: we need to open the gov't. I'm working to find solutions that end the shutdown and pay our Coast Guardsmen and federal workers. https://t.co/HdzEd4xgxJ
During the shutdown, many @EPA workers aren‚Äôt on the job to ensure Maine‚Äôs air and water are clean and Mainers are safe from harmful chemicals.		Yesterday, I voted to fund the EPA and put its inspectors back to work. We need to open the government now. https://t.co/JPTfl9YDUO
I voted today to restore services at @acadianps and fund @Interior. Our bill: 		- puts our park employees back to work and pays them	- helps the park boost our state‚Äôs economy and support businesses in our district	- allows Mainers to fully enjoy the best nat‚Äôl park in the USA https://t.co/KJKLIg7y3Q
Thanks to @chelliepingree, @senatorcollins, and @senangusking for working with me on this important issue. (2/2)
I introduced my first bill to get things done for Mainers. 		Our bill, HR 459, puts control back in the hands of local folks in Hancock County so they can continue the clamming and worming tradition and adds iconic coastline to @acadianps. #mepolitics (1/2) https://t.co/sAqN916rsF
It‚Äôs not too late to get your flu shot! I got mine today. 		This season‚Äôs flu is hitting Maine hard, so it‚Äôs especially important to get a shot this year. 		Find out where to get a free flu shot here ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è	https://t.co/iZ38MyWJsp https://t.co/QZqgevZA4p
A great Maine tradition stretching from Cornville to Skowhegan!	https://t.co/CQsEuCXXWG
I‚Äôm focused on solutions, which is why we're passing bills in the House this week to open the gov't as soon as we can. (2/2)	https://t.co/LaiIWLCYUF
The men and women of @USCGNortheast are worried about mortgages, rent, and putting food on the table because of the shutdown. Mainers are not political props. Real people are being hurt. (1/2) https://t.co/GLWxgnw1AB
The Smiths from Madison can't close on a house during the shutdown because @USDA is closed. This shutdown is real for Mainers.		I‚Äôm helping pass bipartisan bills this week to open the government as soon as possible. It's what's best for Maine. 	https://t.co/kD5SSBpUEr
That's why I voted today for H.Res 6. The legislation defends Mainers' care from a Republican lawsuit that would dismantle the ACA. It's time to put up or shut up about protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Maine people want:		‚òëÔ∏è Protections for pre-existing conditions	‚òëÔ∏è Medicaid coverage for 70,000 Maine people	‚òëÔ∏è Mainers under 26 to have access to their parents' plans (1/2)
Today is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Maine's law enforcement officers are deeply committed to serving the people of our district. 		I'll work closely with our police officers to keep Mainers safe in our communities.
The opioid crisis hurts Mainers every day, all over our state. Our communities need help.		@chelliepingree and I are calling for increased resources and new solutions to turn the tide on the opioid epidemic in Maine.		https://t.co/xmGkA1WMww
I talked with @MainePublic this morning about the government shutdown. Party leaders are missing an opportunity to come together and show the American people we can work together to get things done.		https://t.co/GyJ5eT0ihA
The closure of Barclaycard in Wilton will hurt a lot of people. We're learning more about the situation and we're going to work hard to help these workers however we can. https://t.co/D1hEjxGbaU
When I ran for Congress, I told Mainers I would work to restore faith in our democracy by helping remove big money and special interests from politics. 		#HR1 is the first step to following through on that commitment. #forthepeople 	https://t.co/bPrgiFDIaJ
We need to strengthen our borders. But shutting down the gov't to demand more money for the president's unrealistic, irresponsible wall hurts Maine &amp; doesn‚Äôt get us closer to a secure border. I‚Äôm working with both parties to get the gov't working again and put people first (3/3)
I voted with Republicans &amp; Democrats to reopen the government last week. The bills we passed strengthen the border &amp; build physical barriers where they're effective. Just as important for Maine, the bills fund infrastructure projects, open nat'l parks, &amp; pay gov't employees (2/3)
The gov‚Äôt shutdown means many Maine people aren‚Äôt getting their paychecks, many Maine small businesses and their workers are hurting, and services Mainers rely on aren‚Äôt functioning. This is bad for people in our state, and it‚Äôs only going to get worse (1/3)
We opened our offices in Lewiston and Caribou this week! 	We're here to listen to and work for Maine people. If you need assistance with federal programs like Medicare, Social Security, and the VA, we're here to help.		Lewiston: 179 Lisbon St. 		Caribou: 7 Hatch Drive, Suite 230 https://t.co/1kXSEtm7TM
Late last night, I voted for a bipartisan plan to re-open the government. Here's my statement: https://t.co/xHn2w9rA29
Just finished my first day as a Congressman. I am honored and proud to represent Maine's second district. 		Today, we took a critical step to end the partial government shutdown. But that's just the beginning. We're ready to listen, get to work, and put people first. https://t.co/AG4OEJdC6B
