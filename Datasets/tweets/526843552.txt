@seanrobinsonTNT Best of luck, Sean. And respect. Looking forward to seeing what's next.
@loganb You said both. (And declining to run an ad amounts to blocking it from appearing on Facebook, so I'm not entirely clear on the distinction you're drawing. Feel free to call again to discuss.)
@loganb The quote above is accurate, as is a second quote from you that's in my article:		“Facebook has a choice to make," Bowers said. "They can either decline to run the ad or they can comply with Washington State's disclosure rules. That’s the choice that they have.”
@jeremybmerrill Thank you, @jeremybmerrill! Means a lot coming from you.
After the above story published, @facebook spokesperson Devon Kearns responded.		"We have re-reviewed these ads and rejected them," he said. "We will be working to make sure similar ads are unable to run in the future." 		Facebook's ban on WA ads is still in effect, he added.
Same for a council candidate in south Seattle's District 2, Ari Hoffman, who said he's made very clear to Facebook that he's a Washington State politician running for elective office. 		"If Facebook is checking it," @thehoffather said, "they should be the one to shut it down.”
Three of those Seattle City Council candidates said they *knew* Facebook had banned local political ads, but bought ads anyway.		“I indicated it was a political ad," @loganb said, "It’s on Facebook to decide whether they want to follow through and block all local political ads."
Facebook banned local political ads in Washington State, then kept on selling them. 		Among the purchasers: four different candidates for Seattle City Council.	https://t.co/Q3rvv91qIF

Perhaps when Facebook now expresses concern that sharing ad targeting details "could expose people's information," it has this same, relatively small group of people in mind.
The company didn't say. 		But last year, as Facebook and Google tried—and failed—to prevent Washington State regulators from requiring them to disclose *local* political ad targeting information, lobbyists for Google offered a different rationale: https://t.co/qgy9K2NRee
When @Ariana_Tobin and @jeremybmerrill asked Facebook why it doesn't just disclose political ad targeting information through its much-hyped political ad archive, Facebook said that doing so “could expose people’s information.” Which people's information?

"If Google wasn't accepting ads," asked the treasurer for one Washington state campaign, "why did they accept ours?"
By my count, Google has now sold more than $13,000 in local Washington state political ads since it banned such ads in June 2018. 		These Google ads have targeted Washington legislative and judicial races, as well as local ballot measures on Mercer Island and in Skagit County.
A Google spokesperson told me: "Advertisers that submit these ads are violating our policies. We take measures to block these types of ads—when we find violating ads, we remove them." 		But @Magendanz showed me an October e-mail from a Google ad salesperson pitching him ads.
One former Washington state lawmaker, Chad @Magendanz,  lost his race and believes his opponent used banned Google ads. Magendanz used them, too—but he wasn't able to purchase his until days before the election. "It seemed that any 'ban' was being selectively enforced," he said.
Google is now six months into its ban on sales of Washington state political ads—yet it's been unable to stop selling them.	https://t.co/hs63xVO7vc
@apardoe (Those local transparency regulations, by the way, also apply to the mediums you mentioned: TV, radio, and direct mail.)
@apardoe Both Google and Facebook have said repeatedly that they support transparency in political ads. 		If I understand their positions correctly, both will resume selling political ads in Washington state when they feel they can comply with local transparency regulations.
@KAA81 No, the Washington state issue is confined to state and local political ads. 		Ads aimed at federal elections are regulated at the federal level — and Congress has so far declined to create any new regulations for online political ads targeting federal elections.

As promised, Facebook rang in the new year with a new ban on political ads aimed at local elections in Washington state. https://t.co/D4LLtnBiLv
The following day—which was yesterday—Facebook announced it will join Google in halting political ad sales in Washington state.		https://t.co/twXQ6lMtC1
And, Attorney General Ferguson said, if Facebook or Google violate this state's political ad disclosure laws in the future, "they’re going to hear from us again.”
In an interview after the settlement was announced, I asked Attorney General Ferguson whether Facebook's "Political Ad Archive" meets the requirements of current state law, never mind the new "final rule" that takes effect January 1. 		Ferguson's answer: "No."
Then, earlier this week, on December 18, Facebook and Google said they would pay Washington state a collective $455,000 to settle Attorney General Ferguson's lawsuits—without admitting guilt for local election ad disclosure violations.		https://t.co/k6hLsfBdAw
Facebook had claimed its "Political Ad Archive," launched in May, provides all the information that Washington law requires Facebook to reveal. 		But on November 30, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson made clear he has a very different view.		https://t.co/soYwE1MGBp
That effort failed when, on November 29, the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission voted unanimously to affirm this state's strong transparency laws and issued a "final rule" on political ads that takes effect January 1.		https://t.co/0wZfekacJz
But Facebook kept on selling political ads in Washington state, and its lobbyists, along with lobbyists for Google, set out to try to change state regulations to their liking.		https://t.co/PmJ3G6Ua67
A few days later, Google announced it would stop selling political ads aimed at Washington state's elections:		https://t.co/zeN6YBcoCX
Then, in June, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson sued Facebook and Google for failing to disclose local election ad information to me—and for other violations of Washington's landmark 1972 transparency law over many years.		https://t.co/7ire0ASb0L
As a result, in February of 2018 Seattle's top election regulator declared Facebook to be in violation of the law.		https://t.co/r5fZQULYNq
So in the winter of 2017, I walked into the Seattle offices of Facebook and Google and presented the companies with a law that says they have to disclose local election ad data. 		I requested information on ads that targeted Seattle municipal elections. They never sent it to me.
With lawmakers in DC deciding to keep this gap in federal regulations wide open, I wondered whether local laws could be used to force tech giants to disclose the money trail for state-level election ads, along with the ads' often narrow targeting information.
But more than two years after Russians bought targeted online ads in rubles to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Congress has declined to expand these federal disclosure requirements to digital platforms.
Federal law has long required television and radio stations, for example, to disclose who's funding political ads aimed at national elections.
This landmark transparency law requires campaigns in Washington state *and* the companies that sell local political advertising to make significant disclosures to the public.		If that sounds like a wild idea, it's not.
It begins decades ago, before the internet existed—before Mark Zuckerberg was even alive. 		In 1972, amid disgust at Nixon-era corruption, Washington voters overwhelmingly approved a law bringing daylight to the financing of political campaigns.		https://t.co/61Mwinz8Z9

The amounts Facebook and Google are paying here represent "two of the largest campaign finance resolutions in state history," according to @AGOWA.

The @sallyjclark version of @cmkshama's talk of an "unelected" MW committee? Thanks the "mostly-volunteer" committee, offers hearing sked.
A dive into the important details of @Mayor_Ed_Murray's minimum wage agreement, by @minardanna: http://t.co/UxeLYyXKHO
Business-backed OneSeattle corrects @Mayor_Ed_Murray. "No decisions have been made regarding a potential ballot initiative," spokesman says.
After @cmkshama left her presser, a staffer passed around an initial labor proposal to the mayor's committee. Very different from agreement.
The overall response from @cmkshama to @Mayor_Ed_Murray's minimum wage agreement: "This is not the only recommendation for $15 an hour."
There's a committee supermajority for @Mayor_Ed_Murray's minimum wage proposal. But @cmkshama says she has a supermajority of Seattleites.
Big labor voted yes on the mayor's minimum wage agreement. @cmkshama voted no. How does she explain this? She didn't quite answer.
"What is the justification for McDonald's and Starbucks to take three, for years?" asks @cmkshama. She doesn't support big biz MW phase-in.
"Our work is far from done," says @cmkshama. "We need a clear-cut and simple proposal. This is not a complicated question we're discussing."
The mayor's agreement, @cmkshama says, "reflects the attempts of business to water down what the working people of Seattle want."
Calling the committee "unelected," @cmkshama says she looks forward to this agreement going to the city council.
"This proposal does not live up to the wishes of Seattle workers," says @cmkshama. She voted no. http://t.co/NU0907gBXi

Cupcake Royale owner Jody Hall says the mayor's minimum wage deal is "a smart, responsible plan." http://t.co/z92ZPzHXSZ
Molly Moon says the mayor's deal is "excellent." http://t.co/b726IrMlff
A picture of who's with the mayor today: Big labor, one council member, one non-profit leader: http://t.co/6nLmXrFn4G
Worth noting: @NickJLicata is the ONLY member of the Seattle City Council who's here standing with the mayor today.
My guess is that @cmkshama was the third abstention / "no" on the mayor's committee. She's holding a press conf immediately after this.
There won't be a ballot initiative from business-backed OneSeattle, @Mayor_Ed_Murray says. Sounds like they're on board with this agreement.
...and Craig Dawson of Retail Lockbox voted "no." That's two. The third abstention or "no" wasn't mentioned by @Mayor_Ed_Murray.
Who on the minimum wage committee wasn't in the supermajority? Maud Daudon of Seattle Chamber of Commerce abstained...
The long-meeting minimum wage committee might have an unfair labor practice or wage theft complaint against him, @Mayor_Ed_Murray jokes.
That is, @NickJLicata said: "I will work with my city council colleagues to pass this proposal."
Now up, @NickJLicata. Quotes Saul Alinsky and says, "I will work with colleagues to pass this proposal." http://t.co/shryukAP29

"Seattle workers are getting a raise," @Mayor_Ed_Murray says. http://t.co/orP1970ETd
Lots of talk about the declining middle class. @Mayor_Ed_Murray says this is an "historic" step toward reversing that decline.
This is "middle-out" economics, @Mayor_Ed_Murray says, not failed "trickle-down" economics.
"No industry, organization, or class of employees is exempt from this deal," says @Mayor_Ed_Murray.
Details of the Seattle minimum wage deal: Small businesses (fewer than 500 employees) reach $15 in seven years. Big businesses in three.
He got his supermajority. @Mayor_Ed_Murray says 21 members of his minimum wage committee agree on this deal, praises their courage.

RT @OfficeofMayor: @elijsanders She is. No one is off the committee. The committee is not done.
"When was the last time the media went to Starbucks and said, 'Why aren't you willing to compromise?'" asks @cmkshama.
"I stand against tip credit," @cmkshama says. She's also against health care credit. "Wages are wages are wages."
Is @cmkshama still on the mayor's committee? It's an interesting question, she says, because she considers the committee "done."
"We live in a capitalist system," says @cmkshama. "It is class warfare."
Threatening an initiative is "a safety net" for workers, says @cmkshama.
"I don't think anyone wants exemptions," says @cmkshama, speaking of the mayor's committee.
Very different view on the second floor. "The committee is done," says @cmkshama. http://t.co/2dOJhr40w7
Negotiating with himself at the podium, @Mayor_Ed_Murray says supermajority would be: "At least 60%? How about that? I'll leave it there."
However! @Mayor_Ed_Murray won't say what he thinks a supermajority is on a committee of 21.
Committee co-chair says there is a majority in favor of an unspecified MW proposal. But, they are now waiting for a supermajority.
Mayor's committee co-chair says he's optimistic. @Mayor_Ed_Murray jokes the rest of the committee is "locked" in the negotiating room.
Why is @Mayor_Ed_Murray less optimistic than he was this morning? "Because I'm here without a plan," he says.
Adjusted timeline for a minimum wage proposal from @Mayor_Ed_Murray: "In the next few weeks."
"People have walked out of the room," @Mayor_Ed_Murray says. "But they've always walked back." And they're still, right now, negotiating.
Is this a sign of failure on the part of this administration? "Sure, it could be," says @Mayor_Ed_Murray.
If all of this ends in multiple ballot measures, @Mayor_Ed_Murray says, he fears "A mini-version of class war."
Sounds like the only number @Mayor_Ed_Murray's committee agrees on is 15. How? When? Who first and who later? Still under discussion.
.@Mayor_Ed_Murray: "The issue of how large and small business should operate is still under discussion."
"Regrettably," @Mayor_Ed_Murray says, "we don't have an agreement yet."
No firm agreement from @Mayor_Ed_Murray's committee. Just an "agreement in principle."
So, @GoldyHA, we all just sit here until we agree?
Number of video cameras: 12. Number of journalists: About 3 dozen. Minutes @Mayor_Ed_Murray is late: 15. Now.

Yesterday's 2/3 majority ruling is a reminder that down-ballot supreme court races really matter: http://t.co/TUsbAX9Waw

You're saying, @ByManuelValdes, that you disagree w/ Matt Barreto's UW study finding prejudice in the Gonzalez vote? http://t.co/9C1XPRM4ph
In striking down the 2/3 majority rule, the WA Supremes noted the framers' concern about "a tyranny of the minority"—which the rule created.
And, @ByManuelValdes, close in the sense that Danielson got 40% and 440,000 votes without raising money or even seriously campaigning.
In short, Supreme Court elex matter. McCloud over Sanders 2012 + Gonzalez over Danielson 2012 + Wiggins over Sanders 2010 = today's ruling.
Not final vote tally, @ByManuelValdes. But close in the sense that w/out media attention to Danielson and big Gonzalez $$, different result.
Recall, too, how close we came in 2010 to a re-elected Justice Richard B. Sanders rather than Wiggins: http://t.co/fav27ADXu6
Recall how close we came last year to getting a "zero qualifications" Justice Bruce Danielson rather than Gonzalez: http://t.co/mEDxSQzj1o
Which means: If Gonzalez hand't won last year, and Wiggins the year before, we'd have a different 2/3 ruling. This is a King County victory.
The majority striking down Eyman's 2/3 majority requirement: Madsen, Owens, Chambers, Fairhurst, Gonzelez, and Wiggins.
@glossolaliac I have a PDF. @GoldyHA will be posting soon on Slog.
In a 6-3 decision, court says that a 2/3 majority requirement must be passed "through constitutional amendment, not through legislation."
Washington State Supreme Court strikes down Tim Eyman's 2/3 majority requirement as unconstitutional.

Biden goes there. Are you taking notes on THIS Obama?
They should have made the fist presidential debate half foreign policy and half domestic. Much better format.
Even Sarah Palin didn't make Biden laugh this much.
Biden hearts Bibi.
Ryan: "Let's look at this from the point of view of the Ayatollahs." Guaranteed SNL parody.
"Incredible." Biden is doing the debate AND the debate color commentary.
This is how you keep control of a debate.
Biden is on.
Biden just laughs at Ryan when he says we are watching the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.

RT @OnionPolitics: Somewhere, Bill Clinton is shouting answers to all of Jim Lehrer’s questions at his television
For someone who has done pretty well by life in the boardroom, Romney has a surprising amount of distaste for unelected boards.
Exactly. Obama was smart to steamroll Lehrer to get to the Massachusetts uppercut.
Romney says the best plan would have been what he did in his state. Um, Massachusetts? Because that was the model for Obamacare.
RT @dlboardman: @elijsanders CNN has a running clock. Of course, Obama's speaking much more haltingly.
RT @gangrey: . @politifact is winning this debate.
RT @FranklinFoer: Romney would be winning this election now, if he had been this slippery at the start.
@dlboardman I stand corrected. According to whose stopwatch?
RT @dlboardman: @elijsanders Actually, Obama's had about 2 minutes more.
Finally, Jim Lehrer cuts Romney off. Finally.
Romney is taking advantage of the weakness of the moderator, which seems to be giving him an inordinate amount of time.
Obama, owning "Obamacare." Smart.
Romney tells everyone 60+ to turn off the TV. Now! Must mean the good stuff is coming.
Nice: "It's time to end it."
This was the right pivot for Obama: move it to corporate tax breaks (meaning, move it to Romney's major weakness, his corporateness).
Romney split screen expression now moving from concerned skepticism to smirking disdain.
The moderator needs to take better control of this debate.
Again channeling Clinton. And now name checking him, too.
It's math! Somewhere Bill Clinton is recording a debt owed.
Hm. Wondering if a five point plan actually plays better in a debate format. Seems more fulsome with clock ticking than in a long speech.
Romney's very practiced split screen expression: concerned skepticism.
Romney accuses Obama of trickle down?

In further foreboding, this week's Bay Guardian and SF Weekly, stacked, are thinner than boyfriend's iPhone. http://t.co/ZjS7sHDg
When I was in SF in early 2010, Bay Guardian was 52 pages and SF Weekly was 64. This week: BG 36, SFW 40. Not good.	http://t.co/HXaHrlix

I call it "McKenna vs. McKenna." @Jim_Brunner calls it "cake & eat it too moments." @goldyha calls it "bullshit." Rare agreement on McKenna?
@Jim_Brunner @ChrisGrygiel That was more about new McKenna statements on light rail, though. I've seen Inslee use HCR to win votes recently.

@paulconstant I feel especially bad about what was done to Whitney. That was way too soon (and way too high for us).
@paulconstant Then I went home and realized our karaoke room had profoundly mangled Bowie's lyrics.
@paulconstant I came away thinking Bowie taught me something profound about Twitter: "It's not really work. It's just the power to talk."

Is McKenna's Light Rail Opposition the Silver Bullet Inslee Needs in King County? http://t.co/cZOyOZ4s via @SlogFirehose
In Bellevue, Inslee tells McKenna to stop opposing light rail. "Get over it and move on," Inslee says. "Stop whining and start building."
@UrbanBeerHiker @WeekdayKUOW Life changing. I was joking about Tweeting from a RAZR. Assumed it couldn't be done.
RT @UrbanBeerHiker: @WeekdayKUOW @elijsanders I have been using my RAZR to tweet for more than a year.  I dread the day when it dies.
As mentioned on today's @WeekdayKUOW, the j stands for @jbalter 's biggest fan.
Something from my distant, pre-Twitter past: http://t.co/0Cx8uKtr
Listening to McKenna talk health care right now on @WeekdayKUOW. He says everyone needs to buy health insurance. But he hates the mandate?
