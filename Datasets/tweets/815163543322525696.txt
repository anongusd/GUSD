@SallyQYates Not sure what you are doing these days but I hope it has nothing to do with public service-your bias was inappropriate and you got fired for it.

@julieroginsky Be Honest to yourself and to us
@julieroginsky Stop being dishonest-This is what the Clintons did and you know it. George Steph. Admitted it in his book. Hillary wanted to continue to deny accusations re Monica and other charges of Bills sexual misconduct.

@RepAdamSchiff Rep Shifty likes to talk abt POTUS lying but he is unable to tell the truth or act in the best interest of Americans-he lies to divide

@DLoesch You are taking the bait-Hillary is irrelevant unless you make her so..She lost 2 pres elections so she is done-dont comment&amp;give her a voice
@jaketapper @SecPriceMD had credibility issues when he was appointed(shady stock purchase) and proves he isn't trustworthy-should be fired TODAY
@samstein Love to BUY @SecPriceMD for what he is worth and SELL him for what he thinks he is worth	I'd be very rich
@maggieNYT @SecPriceMD would have flown Trump Air had it existed
@maggieNYT @SecPriceMD comes across as a used car salesman-cant trust anything he says and now he gets caught stealing from tax payers	#FirePrice
@danpfeiffer The Clintons started their own charity in order to enrich themselves-Clinton Foundation is the way they pay for private travel everywhere
@CillizzaCNN @realDonaldTrump So much for draining the swamp	Now we hear there are "email" issues with Trump Admin?	We were told this BS would stop
@KatTimpf Happiness is a choice-simply choose to be happy by dealing with stress WITH action. Put the negative where it belongs-out of ur thoughts
@BillKristol Idiot-Nov 2018? You r talking about that now? 	You are pathetic Bill-you have turned into a whining punk
@FoxNews @MichelleObama HRC was a deeply flawed candidate to begin with	And more importantly-you have no right to try to shame women for voting the way they want

@EWErickson Extremism of any kind right or left is evil-especially when there is violence.
@samstein POTUS proves yet again that he is incapable of putting other ppl and their problems before himself. I dont think he really cares either
@samstein Once again, this POTUS proves that he has no sense of presidential decorum and doesn't understand proper protocol.
@CillizzaCNN Hey Chris-did you see that new Harvard study that showed CNN leading all others in negative coverage? 93% negative

@ChrisCuomo And u edit the hell out of what's actually said 2 suit cnn narrative all things trump r bad. U should be embarrassed 4 ur lack of integrity
@DallasCoy1 @KatTimpf Because POTUS is dangerously ignorant. He will never accept responsibility for anything he says no matter how much it rips America apart.
@KatTimpf Fox needs more libertarians and independent minded ppl on air. Brings balance which cnn,msnbc etc lacks
@RealAlexJones Shut the fuck up Jones you piece of shit.	Being a democrate/republican meant something different than wht they are today dumbass
@maggieNYT Should ask her if she would have married him if he weren't filthy rich-	Pretty clear that she is a shallow person
@realHelinBaran Know also that ppl a lot weaker than you have stopped	YOU CAN DO IT!
@realHelinBaran Know also that cigs dont actually taste the same after u have stopped for a while-tastes nasty which helps you to continue not smoking
@realHelinBaran #7 know that it will get easier but watch ur subconscious-it will try to negotiate cigs back into ur life or give an excuse like stress
@realHelinBaran By promising it will make it harder 4 you to cheat-nobody wants to break a promise	#6 remove triggers-4 me it was drinking Diet Coke
@realHelinBaran #5 Promise ur family/friends that u are quitting on a spec date like Aug 27th. They will ask you everytime they speak with you how its going
@realHelinBaran #4 Get your head right-write a list of reasons why YOU want 2 quit	Ex. I will no longer allow cigs to control my life.Make the list personal
@realHelinBaran #3 it takes a few weeks for Med's to start working so cont to smoke but start cutting back as tolerated-
@realHelinBaran This is how I quit	#1 Dont try to quit until you are ready	#2 C a dr ask abt Wellbutrin -an antidepressant that curbs addiction/cravings
@maggieNYT Question:why no reporting on Debbie Wasserman Schultz IT guy?
Another Shitty show Joe @JoeNBC 	Going negative 24/7 on Trump is aging you and is boring	Watch out for Karma-just ask @harryreid2016 https://t.co/LQidIgPHY6
@RepAdamSchiff Hey @jaketapper Why dont u ask Schiff and other Dems what message they have 4 Americans other than attacking DT.Attacking DT is no strategy
@CLewandowski_ @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Nice of you to take your head out of Trumps ass long enough to do an interview. Try not man-handle any women. Too much to ask?
@FoxNews @SarahPalinUSA Hey Sarah-Can you see Russia from Iceland like you could from ur front porch in Alaska?
@PressSecMooch @Scaramucci go away-listen to ur soon to be ex wife-your naked ambition and inaccurate self perception leads u to think ppl care wht u think
@JoeNBC @VP Of course you never had good ratings so trying to appease the TRUMP haters to get those ratings is pathetic and speaks to who you are
@JoeNBC @VP We know your agenda Joe-to tear down this POTUS/Administration for personal vendetta -your constant neg coverage makes ur show unwatchable
@NancyPelosi YOU can talk all YOU want but the fact is YOU refuse to recognize that YOU put yourself before ur party and people-retire already

@mattmfm @GovHowardDean I think WE are the illegal immigrants in this case	Native Americans lost all
@CillizzaCNN You cant get elected w low Likabilty-Scott walker and Ted Kruze are not likable enough. John Kasich is both likable and experienced.
@GlennThrush Why isnt MSM covering DNC/Ukraine meeting during 2016 election and Debbie Wasserman Schultz story of IT pirate?	Not even a mention
@aseitzwald Obama didnt allow a record of all visitors -tell the whole story	https://t.co/8isHHb6fYQ

@Acosta @DancingABC Anybody tell him he is wearing girl glasses?	Not that there is anything wrong with that
@daveweigel Rest assured that it wont be a white guy	Kamala probably as of right now
@CillizzaCNN She raises a lot of $ for Dems but Repubs raise a lot of $ bc of her. She may not b well(dementia)referred to Trump as Bush at least 5 times
@DLoesch @shannonrwatts You must be hurting them and their causes
@MaxineWaters YOU have-while you dont even live in the district you rep-your house is worth 4.3 million	You bailed your husbands bank out
@samstein Company not sold...yet	Not divorced....yet	Priebus got to be laughing
@jaketapper You just had Bernie on your show and you didnt even ask him about the FBI investigation of his wife....why??
@thehill Great...another self-centered egomaniac in the WH
@FoxBusiness @MaxineWaters @stevenmnuchin1 Hope she gets voted out in 2018	Maybe an African American who actually lives in the district
@NancyPelosi @FoxNewsSunday Warning Nancy:Chris Wallace may be a registered Dem but he is a real journalist and will not be serving softball Qs.
@dcexaminer You can count @JoyAnnReid out-she has no class
@CapehartJ @peta is that real fur Maxine?
@CapehartJ Is that real fur????
@DineshDSouza Finish you point... is it illegal?
@AnettePelletier @politico @abwrig @kyledcheney @RepAdamSchiff You make a good point abt not hearing a leader with brains
@CillizzaCNN Not @Reince -he is FREE from the ShitShow known as the Trump administration	He and Spicer should write a tell all book
@maggieNYT Rminds me of crowd size discussion-DT sycophants try to prove his lies	Millions of illegal votes?	1000s of Muslims dancing on roofs on 9/11
@DavidCornDC Don't let a lack of facts get in your way Corn	Spinning facts is lying so you along with POTUS are liars and contribute to dividing us creep
@DavidCornDC Doesnt pass the smell test unless those Russians in attendance said they were speaking on behave of Russian govt but go ahead and speculate
@DavidCornDC Remember Harry Reid? He did it -nuc option https://t.co/3wpx6z8bJB
@politico @abwrig @kyledcheney @RepAdamSchiff is a partisan punk who speaks ONLY to dem base. Independents and repubs know him to be dishonest and lacking credibility
@samstein So McConnell deserves a participation trophy?	I think Ricky Bobby said it best... https://t.co/vyQkkallZW
@maggieNYT Take away from anything Trump says.....you cant trust what Trump says
@GeraldoRivera @attorneygeneral @jeffsessions Noticed how happy Spicer was in an interview now that he is gone. Get out on your own terms @Reince and detach yourself from that ShitShow
@ericbolling Its a bad bill-	Skinny? More like pathetic	Need to have a bill that all members of both houses can work with	There is a reckoning coming
@samstein Take it a step further-Some in GOP dont want any form of govt healthcare like old fat white conservatives who have enjoyed white privilege
@mitchellvii You punk-McCain has never played any excuse card	He is a man of honor and integrity who truly puts America 1st
@StuPolitics Time to become an Independent	People before Party	POTUS doesn't realize he could get healthcare reform done by having both houses involved
@ananavarro Watch @SenSchumer wave off the Dems celebrating
@Sarge986 @cvpayne Disagree -POTUS and repubs on it now bc they have both houses and cant put a bill together that will pass -ACA is a bad law-very hurtful
@CillizzaCNN The egos on these ppl is astounding-they could no more put the American ppl before themselves than they could tell the truth
@Scaramucci You are the Communcation Director-stop "kidding around" and using sarcasm-MSM will take you out of context to undermine admin
@JoeNBC Its not abt going after defeated opponent-its abt going after law breakers like HRC-illegal server, 30k plus missing emails,pay-to-play etc
@julieroginsky Time to get on the right side of history. Remember segregation of military?ppl r who they r-Time to be intolerant of intolerance-
@JoeNBC Thanks Forrest
@ChadPergram @MariaBartiromo Time for a subpoena
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS Sessions is safe if he just hangs in there-Trump cant really afford to fire him and will look like a bully if he keeps public shaming #pivot
@CillizzaCNN MSM doesnt mind taking a hardline on DT et al but cant take the heat when they are criticized and called out for unfair/bias coverage
@ABC Typical Democrat-wants to grow the size of govt which is wasteful and incompetent. They are poor stewards of hard earned taxpayer money
@PatrickJas79 @KennedyNation That's crazy talk-Big Govt doesnt do anything well	Why should we give them more money and responsibility when they do such a poor job
@KeithOlbermann I think you are talking about yourself
@TEN_GOP @BoDietl will not run like Blaz the Coward and will support police
@FoxFriendsFirst I dont think @MaxineWaters could beat "The Rents Too Damn High" guy from NY mayoral race	She is toxic
@maggieNYT Saw Spicer in a recent interview and noticed how happy he is now that he is leaving
@julieroginsky Time to stop BEING a Dem or Repub	Time to put country and ppl before party	MSM needs to call out any and all of these pundits spin on truth
@thedailybeast I bet Spicers wife is happy-she has got to be tired of him trying to clean up after DT....EVERYDAY
@BrandyLJensen @daveweigel Trump will threaten Spicer re disclosure agreement so his entertainment value on CNN will be diminished and lack insight
@KatyTurNBC @SRuhle Maybe Bannon is next-lets hope
@thedailybeast @Reince is next to resign-	Cant control POTUS bc he cant control himself	DT fly by ur seat of pants style of mgt is very harmful to America

@AceofSpadesHQ Reminds me of those on American Idol who think they can sing but cant -same with his journalism -lopsided and laughable
@chuckwoolery @PageSix Guaranteed loss if DNC runs Kamala -voters on the left and right dont win elections-its the moderates and independence who wont vote for her
@Kylietwinmom @JoeNBC I dont defend Trump or Repubs or Dems-if they put country first then we could begin to fix what's wrong
@Kylietwinmom @JoeNBC If Joe asked abt FBI investigation of his wife and was nvr asked. Joe and Mika aren't real journalist-if they were then all Qs on the table
@Kylietwinmom @JoeNBC I left Repub party 2 &amp; dont watch Mornjoe but get the tweets w the guest lineup-taped the show Bernie was on to see if Joe asked abt...
@klrwriter @Warren36652708 @Kylietwinmom @JoeNBC Independents are not a party-They dont back DEms or Repubs and thats why its Independent
@stpillow @Warren36652708 @Kylietwinmom @JoeNBC Independents aren't a party -dont have to support DEms or Repubs just issue based	That's why its called independent
@monicajowalter @JoeNBC @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine Don't watch either show

@JoeNBC you or Mika are NOT real journalist and ur show is now an opinion show as all u do is bash all things Trump-boorish and unwatchable
@JoeNBC What Dems are u going to have on your show this week that u aren't going to ask Qs of-Like Bernie-U nvr asked abt FBI investigation of wife

@julieroginsky How do you know Putin thinks there will be no consequences for Russia hacking? You dont but you dont mind speculating and exagerating-shame
@CNN More like 10 out of 10 Americans say journalism has gotten worse since Trump was elected
@danmericaCNN CNN trying to lose viewers?-FCC should pull ur broadcasting license for MISinforming America. Already lost journalist integrity
@JoshuaChavers @Acosta Were u concerned with POTUS when Kathy griffin showed trump head or a play that depicts trump murder? 	Start doing your job and cover all
@joncoopertweets Should have used 25th Amendment on Obama 	He will go down as one of the worst presidents in history AND it has nothing to do with race
@maggieNYT Here is a story for you to cover Maggie https://t.co/AcE3y7kGkX
@maggieNYT Different dept Maggie	The ppl at NYT best seller list aren't the "journalist" writing half truths and lies
@GlennThrush Which means he works 10 times harder than Obama ever did
@julieroginsky The Worse Coming is MSM following TRump right down into the gutter-They are complicit in this-U dont have to cover tweets like breaking news
@JoeNBC You can thank TRUMP-he is the reason your ratings are up at all-by the way-half the ratings of Imus when he was on
@johnfkirby63 @CNN Seriously? You are a Clinton/Democrat butt boy. Your roll at the State Dept was disgraceful and showed your willingness to cover up HRC BS
@KirstenPowers AND....if women ruled the world there would be much less aggression and chaos
@chucktodd @POTUS It wasn't too long ago that being a "Lawyer" meant you were a low life -now the low life's are "JOURNALIST"
@chucktodd @POTUS Sarcasm does not become you Chuck-I miss the hell out of Tim Russert	Any chance you can act like a real journalist today?
@maggieNYT They didnt seem to mind...	Can you possibly cover other news other than everything Trump or can you not help yourself?
@julieroginsky Block the nut jobs and be glad you dont have to live in their heads
@chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump No DT didnt ask Russia to hack HRC he simply asked if they can find the 30k missing emailsGet your facts right-ur suppose to be a journalist

@foxandfriends @toddstarnes What does that even mean? Nuke? Irresponsible to even suggest that type of action. You remind me of another Todd https://t.co/wdGLizWrwS
@chrislhayes You haven't thought this thru-DT has been a life long prochoice Dem until recently when he realized he would have a better chance as repub
@mattyglesias You got that right-there are no Obamas in the Dem party. Who could be the next leader? Crickets
@ABC McConnell just setting up a justification for rushing the vote bc Dems wont work w them. This is way worse than how ACA was passed
@GlennThrush If it all goes south DT will not take any responsibility. He has no sense of decorum. Its just one mind fuck after another
@maggieNYT POTUS is so undisciplined that he admitted russia hacking-i would hate to be a part of his admin-he will make a liar out of you everyday!
@MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump POTUS admin/staff should keep any open mic away from him-so unpresidential and will let slip info that will get him impeached-no discipline
@JoeNBC @greta Life is a reality show didnt you know? Or a negotiation?  but real lives dont matter to Trump -its all a game
@RawStory @ericbolling should never be in a position to make these types of decisions-he also thinks steroids/other drugs ok in sports-
@RepAdamSchiff You really are a pencil necked partisan punk who is trying to obstruct this administration from getting the peoples work done-#asshole
@JoeNBC Mean while your network MSNBC is "looping" London terror attack. They are live right now when they would normally be off air
@MSNBC MSNBC gave @revalsharpton a show even though he advocated killing police.	https://t.co/Ew0rVF6mE2
@Lawrence @TheLastWord Shut the front door Larry-damn you suck. You are like the filler in dog food-nothing nutritional and u just get pooped out in the end
@ChrisCuomo That makes no sense at all-POTUS base loves a good show of strength BUT Dems will spin negative
@TIME Hillary is still lying......not shocked. Dems will eventually get to the point that HRC was a deeply flawed candidate or face losing big agn
@ABC Has someone told Hillary that she is not president? If she were she would "drone" Julian Assange
@rogerharrell555 @CillizzaCNN @JohnTeganXXX She is super privileged more likely with absolutely no idea what it means to truly worry about life situations-she does NOT looked stressed
@CillizzaCNN Seriously-I think she is an alien(from outer space) trying to learn to talk correctly &amp; learn our mannerisms. Doesnt resonate but lets see
@Lawrence @oreillyfactor @TheLastWord You feign moral outrage......Phony	Thanks Larry-You dick bag
@brithume Want some perspective re Russia and Syria-check this 60 minutes price on Obama	https://t.co/p1lJ4TyQFR
@brithume Susan Rice lies and cant be trusted. Cant seem to get the REAL truth about her role in all this. Bias reporting-I want balance
@ananavarro You are STILL so pissed about Donald Trump winning the presidency. Your anger shows and is unbecoming-Hit POTUS with real facts 4 a change

@maggieNYT Like at the inauguration when DT said that the sun came out when he was sworn in and it was really raining.
@newtgingrich 	Tell Him Newt-Why not grab that low hanging fruit like infrastructure and tax relief. Find common ground-gets. Things done
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP That's a lie-you owe it to Americans to go back and do it over. This bill drops 24mil ppl, adds cost, stop lying
@SimonMaloy @daveweigel Freedom Caucus is extremely intolerant of ppl who dont look like them or think like them. Limited future
@CNNPolitics @RepAdamSchiff You cant trust anything THIS Politician says. Let's see the facts before we jump in
@newtgingrich This bill does not repeal Obamacare. It still leaves elements in place. Bad bill
@BreitbartNews Don't blame Ryan-POTUS knew what he was doing and has to OWN this defeat. He never takes reponsibilty
@BreitbartNews The problem is that its a terrible bill-it drops 24mil ppl,adds cost and... AND doesnt repeal Obamacare. Do over
@CNN @@FreedomCaucusUS The Problem w Freedom Caucas is that they are intolerant of other citizens views and lifestyle. Anti-civil rights
@KosloffM Nope I said HONEST leadership. LOL!	POTUS needs to tell the truth on all issues and quit embarrassing himself &amp;USA
@Franklin_Graham Don't forget Honest leadership
@GeraldoRivera If the undoc person, who should have never been here, was prevented from entering then the rape would have never happened.
@JamesGoodnow There you go MANSPLAINING again James-ppl understand that its not REALLY wiretapping a phone-we r not as stupid as you wish
@chrislhayes @RepAdamSchiff Schiff comments when pressed said HE saw evidence of poss Russian collusion but cant talk about it-PartisanHack
@TIME @sethmeyers Seth Meyers is such a punk-I thought his show was cancelled.GET OUT ALREADY
@ABC @RepAdamSchiff 	Schiff is so partisan that he has no status when it comes to fairness or balance.
@JoeNBC Gorsuch will be confirmed-watching thehearings is a real love fest even by Dems. Ted Cruz seems to have a real man crush
@CNNPolitics I wonder how much THIS vacation cost american tax payers. Mar-a-logo costs 3million everytime POTUS goes. He should pay
@JoeNBC Tom Cotton is right-pull back and take your time to get this healthcare bill right. Americans deserve better than this flawed bill
@JamesRosenFNC @kilmeade @foxnewsradio Try not to lose any brain cells talking with the very "not funny or smart" Kilmeade
@ainsleyearhardt @newtgingrich Another reason to implement immigration reform-legal immigration w path to citizenship prov that structure
@TheFix Now people will want to ask you what bathroom you will want to use! Lol
@realDonaldTrump You are 70 years old-time to grow up and stop lying to suit ur agenda or you will never be respected and lying is ur legacy
@realDonaldTrump My parents taught me when I was a kid that if I told the truth then I would not have to keep lying to cover up
