@Bakari_Sellers Sad. But the man was armed and resisting arrest. "Citizen is not required to formally arrest the suspect if,  under the circumstances,  a reasonable person in the suspect’s position would have known  he was under arrest. A citizen may  use reasonable force  to effect  an arrest."

@Randelius @SheriffClarke @newsmax You should know as an attorney. What will go wrong for those who show up to commit felony assault, is they'll instead go to prison. Cops are hamstrung by optics but that will change fast when citizens step up. (link: https://t.co/m4qpPSkel5) Alameda Co. DA

@oreoscar @WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton @StateDept The FBI (under direction of corrupt attorney general after she meets with B. Clinton) chose not to file charges. Hillary is the height of evil and corruption that's why good people will never let this rest.

@oreoscar @WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton @StateDept Not being charged because your husband has a corrupt attorney general in his pocket doesn't make you not guilty of committing a felony.

@djblev @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler People commiting violent felonies in the streets are criminals not protestors. Anyone who observes the felony can make an arrest. This is the correct, lawful and ONLY way  for us to take back our streets and restore law and order in our society.
@djblev @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Law and order is society's responsability to uphold. We've enumerated enforcement of the law to police, but we're ultimately responsible that it happens. If they won't, then we must. The lawful powers of arrest for observed felonies actually lie with the observer not the officer.
@djblev @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Need to become versed in local laws concerning citizen's arrest. Generally, if you witness a FELONY, and make clear perpetrator is UNDER ARREST, reasonable proportionate force up to deadly is justified to stop felony and affect arrest.
