@animal_lover365 @SavnRyansPrvate @Politics_Polls They actually had trump up one a week before the election.....
@brown_alston @Nate_Cohn Well, the difference here is that the final poll coming up to election day shows handel having trouble. Sure, she could still win, but it's very worrying.
@joyful_Ally @Nate_Cohn Trump won this CD by 16 points, The Incumbent won it by 6 points last time, every other rating has this at a tossup. This is polling as a tossup, this is absolutely not good for the incumbent.
@brown_alston @MonmouthPoll Considering that all the tossups are held by Republicans, then yes
@albinaugustin19 @justpaiewonsky @blankslate2017 @NateSilver538 I think that’s what he means, the independents are heavily favoring the dems, while in previous years they favored the Republicans
@SavnRyansPrvate @DrewSutton20 @Nate_Cohn that's true, I guess it's mostly some number crunching I will never understand. We'll see on election day
@SavnRyansPrvate @DrewSutton20 @Nate_Cohn https://t.co/twe80byIZH		Read what the fundamentals do, it's not just GCB. I agree with you on North Dakota (It's a numbers model after all), but CA isn't North Dakota and it may be even more important to use Fundamentals there. (Clinton was underestimated in CA)
@SavnRyansPrvate @DrewSutton20 @Nate_Cohn so you are going to extrapolate just based of ND? Lmao what, alright man whatever floats your boat
@SavnRyansPrvate @DrewSutton20 @Nate_Cohn I mean, I'm just looking at Nate's Numbers (538), but he has the dems winning these races by 1-3 points. These polls suggest that is true, I think it's just some of the undecided Republicans are just voting for the Republican. Plus Statistical Noise
