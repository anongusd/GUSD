@MarkHarrisNC9 Presumably Harris gave Republican board members the opening to vote for a new election, but crazier things have happened. 		Will have to wait until the board votes, hopefully sometime this afternoon. 	#nc09
@MarkHarrisNC9 Yes Mark Harris called for a new election. (I'm late on the twitter news.) 		The NC Election Board still has to vote. 	There are 3 Democrats and 2 Republicans. They need 4 votes for a new election. #nc09
@ElwoodLampblack I know I realized that the second I said it. And I’ve done it my whole life. Ahhhh
.@MarkHarrisNC9 said he was surprised that he was paid at least $115k for Harris campaign work. 		"It was disappointing to me that I did not follow that more closely, :Harris said. 		He thought it would be more like $60-70k. 	#NC09
Mark Harris just said that he did not know that independent pacs can't coordinate with a candidate. 		He was a candidate for federal office.		Hmmmmmmmmmmm	#NC09

RT @hardball: We'll have an update on the latest out of #NC09 from @LACaldwellDC. #Hardball
BIG: Mark Harris did not know that his son was going to testify in what was pretty explosive testimony.		The Mark Harris team was not shown a witness list, a source tells me. #NC09
An emotional John Harris says he loves his parents and has no vendetta against them but says that they made mistakes in the process. 		Mark Harris also wipes tear from his eyes.
Son John Harris said that Mark Harris told him he was going to hire Dowless but as a contractor and through the Red Dome Group to add a layer of separation from the campaign. 	#NC09
Son John Harris also said that he had no idea that Red Dome was paying Dowless large amounts with no accounting. He said he just found out. 		And he said that his dad told him he had a criminal record. 		"I do remember expressing general concerns about Mr. Dowless." #NC09
Mark Harris' son is testifying that he had concerns about Dowless and told his dad he had concerns.	- Dowless' candidate over performing in absentee ballots in primary election of 2016	"I thought what he was doing was illegal and I was right," he said. #NC09
John Harris testified was concerned about absentee ballot results in the 2016 primary in the 9th CD race when Dowless' candidate Johnson over performed. 		He also said he was shocked to hear how Andy Yates paid Dowless with no documentation and per absentee ballot request. #NC09
The hearing resumed after lunch. Mark Harris' son, John Harris has taken the stand.
@MeetThePress It's never great for constituents when they have no representation in the House of Representatives. 		NC-09 residents haven't had representation since the new Congress was sat in early Jan. 		It's also not great where there is no confidence in the election results.
@MeetThePress that is an excellent question. And the answer is unclear. 		There would likely be lawsuits. And/or the House of Representatives could take up the matter. 		But it's unclear. The State Board isn't totally sure where it would go either.
@MeetThePress Harris will likely say he was unaware of the tactics Dowless used to drive up absentee ballot votes. 		Democratic attorneys are trying to show it is unlikely that Harris couldn't have known since Dowless has a track record of his candidates over performing with mail-in ballots
@MeetThePress Dowless conducted this scheme in two rural counties - Bladen and Robeson - working for Rep. Mark Harris.		He would collect voters' ballots, including unsealed ones, which is illegal in NC, and mail them in.		His step-daughter testified that they would fill out incomplete ballots.
@MeetThePress @packswimdive @MarkHarrisNC9 (2/2)	- the operative's step-daughter said they filled in incomplete ballots for GOP candidates (but she says not for Harris)	- Investigators found "coordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced scheme."
@MeetThePress Hi! First, I must give a shout to @packswimdive. The #4 ranked women start ACC championships today. 		OK. #NC09 hearing. The biggest developments:	- Investigators found illegal absentee ballot collection by political operative hired by Rep @MarkHarrisNC9 	(1/2)
Hearing broke for lunch until 2 pm. Watch this space at 1:30 for my twitter convo with @MeetThePress 		When the hearing returns, Republican Mark Harris is expected to take the stand.

Board Member Stella Anderson asking Yates about how much he paid Dowless, insinuating that he was overpaid and she questioned the lack of formality of the payment structure. 		"there weren't things written down necessarily that he gave you?" she asked. 		Yates said no.  #NC09
Harris attorney Alex Dale asked Yates if Harris would still be the winner if he received no absentee ballot votes in Robeson and Bladen County.	“Yes sir,” Yates said		Central to Harris’ argument: the vote outcome would not change even with fraudulent mail-in ballot fraud #NC09
At the start of Day 3, Mccready attorneys asked Red Dome Group Andy Yates if Rep. Mark Harris should have known about the extent of Dowless’ absentee ballot operation.		“Yes I thought I had been,” Yates said.	#NC09

Dowless would not give Andy Yates invoices or details of expenses. Yates would just pay him when Dowless would just verbally tell him how much he spent. 	#NC09
Mark Harris is listening to testimony from Andy Yates very closely. (Harris hired Yates. Yates hired Dowles.) https://t.co/fPUMDL4HLK
Testifying now is Andy Yates. He ran the Red Dome Group, who hired Dowless. (Harris hired the Red Dome Group.)		Yates said he paid Dowless a flat rate and $4 per absentee ballot request. 		Yates added that he saw "no red flags" about Dowless. Said he said he followed the law.
@hardball @SteveKornacki In testimony poll worker who "ran tape" said he didn't know it was not allowed to run the daily election tally in NC.		State investigator told him "We don’t run the results at the end of the night."		Edwards said: "I haven’t been told that until you just" said it.
@hardball @SteveKornacki A NC election board member asked a question, which has bene rare through out this hearing as they've been leaving the questioning to lawyers.	 	"It's clear that the tape (election tally) was run (before Election Day) should not have been run," board member Stella Anderson said.

I’ll be on @Morning_Joe in a few to chat about the still disputed #NC09 congressional race and the wild hearing on the election taking place in Raleigh
and here's the full wrap from the day, including a tv hit on @hardball with @SteveKornacki https://t.co/pDifVhZK9E
After closed session, the Board chair says if he testifies he would be granted immunity from what he testifies about but the board is unwilling to give him immunity. 		Dowless declines to testify
His attorney is advising Dowless to not take the stand. 		The board said they now must move into closed session to talk to Dowless.
McCrae Dowless is called as the next witness. He is here under subpoena. #NC9 https://t.co/XkyQo8LNb2
Kimberly Robinson is currently testifying that she handed her unsealed, blank ballot to a woman named Ginger Eason. 	#NC09
Britt provides a text message that Dowless shared with her last Thursday, instructing her to plead the 5th and not answer questions and to say she hasn’t done anything wrong and neither has Dowless.		She definitely did not plead the 5th.		She will be cross examined after lunch
BIG: Lisa Britt admits to collecting unsealed ballots.	AND If races were left blank she would fill them in at Dowless’ house or office.	She would fill them in favor of the Republican candidates.	Said she was directed by Dowless to do so.
Britt says the pay structure changed at the end of the campaign to a flat rate of $200/wk because it was harder to collect ballots than ballot applications because “a lot of people don’t want to give you their absentee ballot.”	#NC09
Lisa Britt, who is on probation for a felony and still voted, said she’d get paid by Dowless personally for absentee ballot requests plus food and gas.	She also periodically did work in the Bladen County board of elections office, she testified.	#NC09
Dowless’ step daughter Lisa Britt is testifying. She is very close with Dowless, describes him as a father. 	She worked for his absentee ballot operation. He asked her to conduct a media interview. She  admits to telling the reporter something different than investigators
Dowless' step daughter Lisa Britt is currently being questioned. 	She is very close with Dowless, thinks of him as her father. 	She worked for him in the absentee ballot operation. 	She is on probation for a felony offense. She voted in November (which is not legal in NC). #NC09
Investigators found that Dowless and workers requested at least 788 absentee ballot requests in Bladen county and at least 231 in Robeson County - but that number could be as high as 449. #NC09
Dowless paid workers $150 for 50 absentee ballot request forms and $125 for 50 absentee ballots. #NC09
@MarkHarrisNC9 The NC State Election Board investigator also said that there were efforts to obstruct their investigation. she said she'll get into more details on that shortly. 	#NC09
@MarkHarrisNC9 !!!! -&gt; Red Dome Group, hired by the Harris campaign, paid McCrae Dowless $131, 375 for the primary and general election for his absentee ballot and get out the vote operation. 	#NC09
Here’s the man at the center of the investigation: McCrae Dowless. Just chillin outside the hearing room.		He was hired by the @MarkHarrisNC9 campaign for get out the vote and absentee ballot work in the rural parts of the district. https://t.co/3TPHt8ifJi

So Trump will sign the bill AND sign a national emergency declaration, @senatemajldr said on the floor
Finally:		And their are restrictions as to the type of border structure that can be used along the border - no new Trump prototypes. It must be fencing that has been used pre-Trump.		It took a 35 day shutdown to get less money than the senate was willing to give him. (3/3)
More: 		And after Trump started demanding $5.7 billion in the early fall, Schumer started his negotiations with the Senate number - $1.6 billion		When things escalated in late fall, Schumer dropped his opening bid to $1.3 billion.		Trump stayed at $5.7 billion. (2/3)
A little perspective on the border security deal:		$1.375 billion is LESS than the $1.6 billion Senate appropriators agreed to in June of 2018, which is what the administration originally requested.

@MeetThePress One voter I spoke with, Datesha Montgomery, is one whose absentee ballot was illegally collected. 		She said she will never again trust anyone relating to elections. She didn’t think anyone would do anything unscrupulous with her ballot. 		But others aren’t surprised
@MeetThePress That’s right. There are so many facets to the story. Not only the election fraud component but the election board that is doing the investigating is filled with political rife.		Penry, the chair of the 9 person board, resigned after posting political tweets about @realDonaldTrump
@MeetThePress The Harris campaign acknowledged to the Washington Post that it hired McRae Dowless to help him win Bladen County. 		Dowless is at the center of the investigation for hiring dozens of people to collect absentee ballots, which is not legal.
@MeetThePress The NC State Board of Elections is looking into election fraud of mail-in absentee ballots. Bladen County is ground zero where hundreds of voters’ ballots were allegedly illegally collected and possibly tampered with.

@frankthorp And it’s important that the Alaska federation of natives, with 140k members in Alaska, came out against Kavanaugh over tribal issues a couple weeks ago. This group also helped to get Murkowski elected when she lost her primary in 2010 and won as a write-in candidate.

My segment with @AlexWitt from earlier today 👇👇👇 https://t.co/qeT8Ptc8z1
"The proposition that you’d reduce legal immigration would increase illegal immigration and so it’s counterproductive," LIBRE's Daniel Garza said.
The Koch network reinforces their position that they support citizenship for 1.8 million people. 		They don't love a full 25 billion for the border wall but would live with it. 		They don't like getting rid of the diversity lottery or reducing legal immigration, which trump wants
At Koch seminar, a young Dreamer who is part of the the Koch-backed LIBRE initiative starts to tear up talking about his story: 		"I don’t know what my future looks like," he said. "It sucks. It truly does suck being in this position."
Charles Koch also said: "We all bear responsibility" for the divisiveness in the country.		But is Trump to blame for the dissolution of discourse?		"I’m into hating the sin not the sinner."
Charles Koch took questions on the record from reporters. Among the things he said:  	- He "regrets" supporting some Republicans. "And so we’re going to be much stricter" in determining who they get behind
Charles Koch to donors: he’s seeking to build “a nation of mutual benefit”

And that's a wrap for Warren. The crowd loved her. And she was very graphic in her condemnation of Trump, saying he "tear babies from their mommas" or some iteration at least twice.
Boos from the crowd at the mention of Scott Pruitt		Big cheers when Warren says: I'm going to say something controversial in Washington, climate change is real.
More from Warren: "We will keep families together. We will reunite families.  We will make this government reflect the best of America."
“President Trump and his Republican leadership have decided to inflict as much pain as they can on people coming to the United States,” @SenWarren says. https://t.co/hCanPIbxYw
The crowd loooovveed this line from @SenWarren 		"I’m here this morning to fight for every working family.  I’m here to fight for every kid who is scared about what comes next if mom or dad can’t keep it together. I’m here to fight for government that works for the people"
.@SenWarren is walking up to the stage now. major standing O for her.
.@SenCortezMasto says what we have seen at the border this week "is disgusting" and then calls Trump "ignorant."		"It’s really appaling to me that in my own state we actually have Republicans today fundraising with President Trump," Masto says.
.@SenCortezMasto took the stage to a standing ovation. 		She's not up for re-election so she's spending much of her speech stumping for @RosenforNevada for senate.
Dem gubernatorial candidate @SteveSisolak left the stage to self-led chants of "go Dems go." 		Sisolak wants to be the first Dem governor in 2 decades in Nevada. 		He's up against @AdamLaxalt, who is way more conservative than current Nev Gov @GovSandoval who is term limited
Now that families aren't being separated at the border, @RosenforNevada says indefinite family detention must end. 		Calls on Heller to stand up to Trump in Vegas today during a high-dollar fundraiser
"It's time to repeal and replace you Dean Heller," Rosen says. 		Democrats throughout the country say that health care is the number one issue heading into November.
.@RosenforNevada in notes that this week is the anniversary @DeanHeller held the press conference with Gov. Sandoval to say he wouldn't support an Obamacare repeal bill that rolls back Medicaid expansion. "Then he flipped," Rosen said.

He also blamed the courts for derailing the DACA deal, according to a source. He said they had a deal on DACA and $25 bil for the wall but then the court issued the stay
Trump spoke of an unnamed poll to sell the compromise bill that says 88 percent of people support DACA and the Wall. He said only 55 percent support just the Wall.
Update: Trump called it “the bill” in the meeting and was never specific on which bill but the takeaway was he backed the compromise bill
