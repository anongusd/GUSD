250,000 African Americans had registered to vote for the first time by the end of 1965. üéâüôåüèΩ  #MLK55 https://t.co/hzTRy0qLMa
Two years after the march, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed specific voter restriction practices that were designed to keep African American voters from voting, like poll taxes, literacy tests and voter intimidation. #Mlk55 https://t.co/w0DrxkdSK8
After the march, states ratified the 24th Amendment, which outlawed the poll tax because back then voters in certain states were required to pay to vote which disenfranchised black voters. #Mlk55 https://t.co/HBagRIMegT

We have the opportunity to #RestoreTheVRA and protect #VotingRights for everyone. 		But we can't do it without you.		There's no better way to celebrate and honor all we've been through, than by registering yourself and everyone you know.		https://t.co/7dURUG3LNo  		#VRA53 https://t.co/E2rsi48qBk
Present: 		Our voting rights are still under attack and the hard work and progress we've made is unravelling with the help of those who would stand to gain from a less diverse electorate.  But the fight is far from over. #VRA53		https://t.co/s7UARtThoD
Almost immediately following this disastrous decision, states who had a history of voter discrimination based on race, began implementing rules to once again suppress votes under false claims of "Voter Fraud. 	 #VRA53 	https://t.co/WVLqbm3D4f
2013:		After decades of progress and strengthening of our democracy, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the #VRA freeing nine states, mostly in the South, to change their election laws without advance federal approval. #VRA53 	 https://t.co/GWnIeM43KC
1975:		President Gerald Ford reauthorizes the special provisions of the Voting Rights Act, including new measures to permanently bar literacy tests nationwide and give assistance to language minority voters.  #VRA53 https://t.co/aYuagBLsmT
1971:		The 26th Amendment gives 18 year olds the right to vote.  #VRA53 https://t.co/BRYwnPPJWk
By the end of 1965, 250,000 new black voters are registered, 1/3 of them by Federal examiners. #VRA53 https://t.co/JHcH6O1468
Just as important as those protections was the requiring of jurisdictions	with a history of discrimination in voting to get federal approval of changes in their election laws before they can take effect and the monitoring of those places with a history of discrimination. #VRA53 https://t.co/oTp6W8TiMI
1965:	President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the #VotingRightsAct into law, permanently barring direct barriers to voting by racial and ethnic minorities,prohibiting election practices that deny the right to vote on account of race. #VRA53 https://t.co/xfgA2Rj36W
1965:		More than 500 non-violent civil rights marchers are attacked by law enforcement officers while attempting to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to	dramatize the need for African American voting rights. #VRA53 https://t.co/5UpBOa9Iox
1964: 		Congress passes the Civil Rights Act of 1964, making it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, religion, and gender in voting, public places, the workplace and schools. #VRA53 https://t.co/loVDTMdx7d
1963:		The "March on Washington" led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. receives worldwide attention. #VRA53 https://t.co/NCZP1yMeIX
Finally, we start getting somewhere...		1957:		Congress passes the Civil Rights Act of 1957, giving the U.S. Attorney General the authority to bring lawsuits on behalf of African Americans denied the	right to vote.		#VRA53 https://t.co/gYUIV5NRVR
Are you seeing a pattern here? Over a century after the country was founded, there are still large groups of people being denied the vote. Those groups are decidedly non-white.  #VRA53 https://t.co/3jhmJRfHLc
1940:	 Only 3% of eligible African Americans in the South are registered to vote. #VRA53 https://t.co/CnflZrhoqO

1884-1920 	A series of SCOTUS decisions deny Native Americans the right to vote unless they give up tribal affiliation.		#VRA53 https://t.co/QOHeiBV5kH

They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.
They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS.
Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS.
Companies are trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn't reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS.
The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and our parents to call BS.
