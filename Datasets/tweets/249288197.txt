Having a modern IT infrastructure is going to be critical for Social Security’s future, and I look forward to hearing how Social Security can get there on time and on budget.  Americans want, need, and deserve nothing less.
But there is still a long way to go.  It’s going to take consistent leadership at Social Security, and it’s going to take continued oversight from Congress to make sure Social Security isn’t just spinning its wheels.
Social Security is undergoing a technology transformation that is long overdue.  These changes will not only make sure Social Security can quickly respond to new challenges, but also ensure the agency can serve Americans in a modern way.
But I also have some good news to share.  After releasing a modernization plan last October, Social Security has started to make some real progress in bringing the agency’s information technology into the 21st century.
Although Social Security now has modern hardware and modern data centers, its employees are still using software that is decades out of date.  About 30% of these legacy systems still use COBOL code, an ancient programming language that isn’t even taught in schools anymore.
Over the years, the Subcommittee has continued to focus on this important topic.  In fact, the first hearing that I held as Chairman back in 2011 was on replacing Social Security’s aging data center.
While Social Security faces many challenges, information technology is among the most critical to providing the exceptional service Americans expect and deserve.
I’m proud to say that one of this Subcommittee’s recent successes is the bipartisan representative payee bill that became law earlier this year. @RepJohnLarson &amp; I did this together.  He’s been a good friend  &amp; it’s been a pleasure to lead this Subcommittee w/ him. GBU partner
I thank all my colleagues on the Social Security Subcommittee for the honor of serving with them on behalf of the American people.  I also want to thank the Subcommittee staff who work behind the scenes to help make our successes possible.
As Chairman, I’ve focused on many challenges facing Social Security such as modernizing the disability program; combating fraud; protecting Americans from identity theft; &amp; making sure our children and grandchildren can count on Social Security.
This is the last hearing I plan to hold as Subcommittee Chairman.

The IRS already allows state and local workers as well as teachers to do this. So, too, should our brave men and women in uniform.  They should NOT be penalized when it comes to saving for retirement simply for serving our country.
My Servicemember Retirement Improvement Act addresses this problem by allowing Guard &amp; Reserve forces to contribute the maximum to BOTH their civilian 401(k) plan AND their military TSP.
However, Guard &amp; Reserve forces who have already hit the IRS contribution cap in their civilian 401(k) are unable to receive their military TSP matching funds AT ALL! This in turn hurts our military’s ability to recruit &amp; retain the best &amp; brightest.
The ’16 NDAA included military retirement reforms that reduced the military pension but helped make up for this by allowing servicemembers to receive matching TSP funds for the first time.
America’s Guard and Reserve forces typically have a civilian job in addition to their military career. BC of this, they often have a civilian 401(k) in addition to their military TSP.
Included in H.R. 6757 is my Servicemember Retirement Improvement Act, a commonsense measure to correct a problem in the ’16 NDAA, which limits the ability of Guard &amp; Reserve forces to save for retirement.

This bill treats Tribal Councils’ members fairly when it comes to Social Security benefits, and it is the result of a request from several Tribal Councils.  I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.
To be clear, H.R. 6124 does not mandate Social Security coverage – it merely ensures tribes have the ability to make their own decision.
But Tribal Councils don’t have this same option. This just isn’t right.  Tribal Councils should be able to participate in Social Security if they want to, and H.R. 6124 would allow them this opportunity.
Did you know that state and local governments were initially excluded from Social Security, but over time the law was changed to provide state and local govs the choice to extend Social Security coverage to their employees?
LIVE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR: As Chairman of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, last year I held a hearing on Social Security coverage for state and local governments.
Instances like this can be avoided if folks have a single point of contact at Social Security for victims of identity theft. I urge my colleagues to support the Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act.
As a result of all this hassle, he decided to just put off filing his claim...
Later, when he tried to file a claim of his own, he ended up having to make four separate calls! Social Security told him they couldn’t help him over the phone. Because of the previous fraudulent claim, Social Security said he had to go to a field office.
Recently, a man told me about his experience of someone trying to claim his benefits.  First, he got a letter from Social Security telling him to call about his claim.  Well, he hadn’t made a claim, so he called Social Security at the number they gave him. He never heard back.
I’ve heard firsthand how hard it can be for victims of identity theft to work with Social Security. Many folks get the run-around...
ON THE HOUSE FLOOR NOW: I want to thank my good friends, Rep. Bishop and Ranking Member Larson, for their work on the commonsense bill – the Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act.

It is up to Congress to make the tough choices needed to ensure that Social Security is here for our children and grandchildren, just like it is for seniors and individuals with disabilities today.  The American people expect and deserve nothing less.
THIRD, it should reward hard work. FOURTH, it should protect the most vulnerable. FIFTH, it should improve retirement security.
FIRST, it should fix Social Security permanently, not just push out the Trust Funds’ exhaustion date by a few years.  SECOND, it should modernize Social Security to reflect today’s workers and their families.
The news from the Trustees Report is clear.  Time is not on our side when it comes to fixing Social Security.  As I’ve said before, I believe that any Social Security solvency plan should meet 5 principles.
He said he wished he had a full report, but still did not know. The highest # of applications were at the peak of the recession and the # has dropped steadily since 2010. Plus, the # of applications continue to decline.
Last year, Mr. Goss said he was looking at what is causing the decrease in disability applications.  I asked him what he learned.
He said that because the tax bill happened late last year, it wasn't really factored into the the report. The economic assumptions were finalized prior to tax reform passing.
I asked Mr. Goss why the Trustees Report is different and when Social Security finalizes the economic assumptions for each report? Was it before tax reform?
Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and all the good news we are seeing with the economy, CBO and JCT have recently increased their projections of payroll tax revenue.
I asked Mr. Goss what changed.  He said the data showed lower earnings in 2016 and 2017, which decreased the amount of payroll taxes being collected.
Previously, Chief Actuary Goss said that Social Security wouldn’t pay out more in benefits than it receives in revenue, including interest from the Social Security Trust Funds, until 2022.  But the report this yr shows that this is happening RIGHT NOW.
We must take this responsibility seriously.  Americans want, need, and deserve nothing less.
Fixing Social Security will require tough choices, and Congress has a responsibility to the American people to make these choices.  But the longer we wait, the harder it gets.  If we wait until the Trust Funds are exhausted, some options won’t even be available anymore.
GAO can bring much needed transparency and insights into what changes need to be made to improve the reporting process.  After all, Congress must be able to count on these reports and have them available so it can do what it takes to fix Social Security.
To address the need for the full scope of info, @PeterRoskam and I have asked GAO to look at how these reports are developed and why they are almost always late.
Similarly, Public Trustees play an important role in the development of the report.  These positions were created to make sure there weren’t any concerns w/ the report’s objectivity &amp; integrity.  Yet, we haven’t had the benefit of the Public Trustees’ insights since July '15.
It's important to understand HOW &amp; WHEN the Trustees make economic projections that are the key to the findings in this report.
First, it’s surprising to see the report didn’t reflect the benefits of pro-growth tax reform we are now seeing every day – more jobs, higher wages, and a booming economy.
While we review this new report, we should also take into account how it is developed.
This Trustees Report should be a wake up call to anyone who cares about Social Security.  It is a signal that time is not on our side.
Even worse: according to the new Trustees Report, RIGHT NOW Social Security is paying out more in benefits than it receives in ALL of its income for the first time since 1982. This is a big deal.
When I became Social Security Chairman in 2011, the Trustees said it would take $6.5 trillion to make Social Security solvent over the next 75 years.  Now, the Trustees tell us it would take $13.2 trillion –  that’s more than double.
This year’s report says the exhaustion date is now 2034, which is even earlier than they projected last year.  And if Congress DOESN’T act by that exhaustion date, Social Security will only be able to pay 79% of promised benefits.
For years, I’ve said that Social Security is in trouble and that its problems will only get worse – and harder to fix.  Unfortunately, this year’s report once again shows this to be the case.

ICYMI: my op-ed about rethinking Social Security numbers in the modern age https://t.co/7WqGfpcA26 via @RollCall
He spoke about the timeliness of the issue and suggested that the first action we should take is to address the problem of using SSNs as authenticators.
I also asked Mr. Grobman why he thinks NOW is the time to tackle the problem with Social Security numbers.
She skirted the question about the whether the  practice was responsible, instead stating that if a caller was uncomfortable leaving their SSN, they didn’t have to do so.
I also asked Berryhill about Social Security employee voicemail practices, which tell callers to record their SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER with their name and phone number to get a return call.
She said yes, the agency has taken a number of actions including: issuing clarification policies to frontline employees, conducting national calls with managers and directors, and employing regional experts to consult w/ frontline experts at field offices on difficult cases.
I asked Acting Commissioner Berryhill if the agency is taking a close look at how it handles requests for a new SSN and what it’s doing to make sure their policies are being followed.
Identity theft is on the rise and we must take a hard look at the future of the Social Security number – both how it’s used and if Social Security needs to do things differently.  We have a responsibility to do all we can to better protect Americans from identity theft.
It shouldn’t take a local news story or a call from a Congressional office for Social Security to do right by those looking for help.
...What’s worse is that it isn’t Social Security’s policy.  It was an extra hoop to jump through made up by a field office employee.
I recently learned of a case in Arizona where the mother of a child whose SSN had been stolen was told that she needed to change her daughter’s full name before her daughter could get a new one.  That’s wrong…
We will also hear from Social Security about what it takes get a new SSN when it has been stolen and why it is often harder to do than it should be.
We need to break the link between identification and authentication.
These numbers are valuable to identity thieves bc of how we use them: to 1) identify someone, and 2) to prove their identity.
Make no mistake, it’s still important to limit the unnecessary use of SSNs.  But, if we want to keep pace with identity thieves, we need to think beyond just keeping them secret.
But after so many high-profile data breaches like Equifax, OPM, and Anthem, where hundreds of millions of SSNs were stolen, it is clear they aren’t a secret anymore.  And it’s time we stop pretending like they are.
I have been dedicated to doing all I can to protect Americans from identity theft by protecting the privacy of SSNs.  Ex: thanks to a bipartisan effort I led, Medicare is now sending new cards w/o these numbers to seniors across the country.
But given all the ways we use it TODAY, it’s no wonder SSNs are a valuable target for identity thieves.
The Social Security card and the SSN were created in 1936 so the Social Security Administration could track earnings and correctly determine benefits.

Clearly, the IRS Oversight Board no longer serves a purpose and deserves to be eliminated.  Especially since other entities, like Congress and the Treasury of the Inspector General for Tax Administration, already provide oversight for the IRS.
While the IRS Oversight Board was designed to operate like a corporate board for a business, it NEVER functioned as intended and did not provide proper oversight.  In fact, it has now COMPLETELY suspended operations.
As a longtime advocate to stop waste and reduce the size of government, I’m pleased that H.R. 5444 includes my proposal to eliminate the failed and defunct IRS Oversight Board.

He mentioned a snippet of the DoD memo discussing national security, dismissing the CONCLUDING idea that steel or aluminum needed for national defense is not at risk.  FULL MEMO HERE: https://t.co/b7tFS7w3Ir https://t.co/G8h43mryr0
I asked Secretary Ross why he and the Administration ignored the view of Secretary Mattis and proceeded with the tariffs...
Secretary Mattis even wrote to Secretary Ross that the DoD doesn’t believe “the findings in the reports impact the ability of DoD programs to acquire the steel or aluminum necessary to meet national defense requirements.”
As a combat veteran who fought in two wars, I am also deeply troubled that Section 232, which is intended to protect our national security, is being misused to advance a protectionist agenda.
My home state of Texas leads all states when it comes to importing steel and aluminum products. So this is a big deal that could hurt Texas.
I strongly OPPOSE the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  These tariffs pose a serious risk to our economy; could trigger a trade war; and may damage our relations with key allies.

I also asked Mr. Kouzoukas how Medicare is getting the word out to seniors about the new Medicare cards.
I asked the Principal Deputy Administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Demetrios Kouzoukas, if Medicare is still on track to issue new cards next month &amp; replace all cards by April 2019. He said yes.
Ending the use of Social Security numbers on these cards is vitally important to protect our seniors &amp; other Medicare beneficiaries from identity theft, as well as to prevent fraud &amp; abuse.
Back in 2015, then-President Obama signed legislation I championed w/ Rep. Doggett to end the use of Social Security Numbers on Medicare cards as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).

I asked the Ambassador for the status of the proposed NAFTA “sunset clause”, and what he’s trying to accomplish with it. He said at the end of 5 yrs, the President will make a decision about whether the deal should continue. Congress would not have a say in the final decision.
While I support updating NAFTA, I am concerned by the proposed sunset clause. I don’t think that’s good policy. Businesses need certainty.
Over 1 million jobs in TX are supported by trade w/ Canada &amp; Mexico. Nationwide, this trade supports nearly 14 MILLION American jobs.
I also discussed NAFTA w/ the Ambassador.
He said this process is ongoing &amp; that the negotiations are down to the last few issues.  He said he’s hopeful they can come to an agreement soon.
I asked the Ambassador for an update on the South Korea negotiations &amp; when it would wrap up.
As the President looks to renegotiate this trade agreement, he should do so in a way that strengthens our alliance with South Korea.
In 2011, I voted for the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement. Over 40,000 TX jobs are directly tied to this agreement, w/ hundreds of thousands across America.

...A nominee couldn't be appointed now for the next term – the President would need to wait until the current term concludes.
She said that he could possibly nominate someone for the next term, but if the person were appointed now, they would only serve the remainder of the current term...
We are more than five years into the current six-year Commissioner term. I asked Valerie Brannon w/ Congressional Research Service whether the President could nominate someone for the next term right now if he wanted to.
She said that certain actions can ONLY be taken by a Senate-confirmed Commissioner...that some actions taken by an Acting Commissioner are likely non-delegable and therefore in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act and have no effect.
I asked Elizabeth Curda w/ GAO what it means for Social Security to be in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act?
Mr. President, we need you to nominate a Commissioner – and NOW – to keep the agency focused on providing the service Americans expect, need, and deserve.
The President needs to nominate a Commissioner without further delay.  And once he does, the Senate should move quickly because the American people have waited too long.
A Senate-confirmed Commissioner is vital bc only they have the authority to make strategic decisions regarding the long-term operation of the agency.
Yesterday, GAO announced the Social Security Administration is in violation of the Vacancy Reform Act.
This is the largest single period of vacancy for the head of a Department or major federal agency since the SSA became independent.
But Social Security has been w/o a Senate-confirmed Commissioner since the most recent term expired over 5 YEARS AGO.  And for 3 yrs we haven't even had a nominee for the Senate to consider.
This position has a fixed 6 yr term that must be Senate-confirmed, just like Department Secretaries &amp; other high-level federal agency heads…
When Social Security became an independent agency in 1995, Congress created the position of a Social Security Commissioner to run the agency.

Wounded warriors who return to work after recovery shouldn’t forfeit their choice of health care. My bill, the HEARTS Act, rights this wrong.
Veterans who return to work and want to keep Tricare coverage can only do so by staying on more expensive Medicare.
She confirmed there’s a quirk in the law that means these veterans aren’t treated like everyone else and DON’T have a choice.
I also asked Ms. Clemons to detail what happens if a wounded warrior returning to work has other insurance available to them and no longer wants to be on Medicare? Do they have a choice?
She said they need to get records outside of the VA as more veterans get care at other locations.
In addition to working with the VA &amp; DOD, I also asked Ms. Clemons if there are other ways to get more electronic health records for veterans.
She said they expedite claims of vets who have a VA disability rating of 100% permanent and total
I asked Gina Clemons, the @SocialSecurity Associate Commissioner for the Office of Disability Policy, for more information about these expedited claims.
While @SocialSecurity is processing disabled veterans’ initial claims 5-7 days faster than the general public, that doesn’t seem like it’s much faster.
As Social Security Chairman AND a 29-year veteran, I’m as committed as ever to making sure Social Security effectively serves our veterans.
While there are things that Social Security is getting right, there is still room for improvement.
Americans rightly expect Washington to do the best for our veterans.  Social Security is no exception.
I also look forward to hearing about Social Security’s efforts to hire our veterans.
I look forward to hearing how Social Security plans to speed up disability claims for certain veterans + how it’s using tech to keep disability decisions moving.
Americans are waiting too long for a disability hearing, &amp; Social Security must get the backlog under control.
Veterans should have a simple, fast process when applying for Social Security disability benefits – especially our wounded warriors.

SSA’s Acting Chief Actuary said they need to be strategic – that a budget alone won’t solve this.
I asked SSA is the new plan is going to stop the cycle &amp; how they can assure us that in 10 yrs we won't have another backlog.
Yet less than 10 years later, here we are again.
Not that long ago, Social Security was facing a different disability backlog &amp; they told us how that backlog was going to be tackled...
I asked SSA’s Acting Chief of Staff why this plan is taking so long.  She mentioned previous problems &amp; that all options were on the table
Under SSA’s plan, ppl still aren’t going to get a timely decision before 2022.
Waiting nearly two years to get a hearing decision is too long!
Social Security needs a Senate-confirmed Commissioner who can lead the agency &amp; focus on providing the service Americans expect &amp; deserve
In February, Ranking Member Larson &amp; I sent a letter to President Trump asking him to nominate a Commissioner w/o delay.
Since ‘13, Social Security has only had an Acting Commissioner.
Social Security needs more than just a plan to fix this – it needs real leadership.  This is in large part a management problem.
Today we are going to hear about how Social Security plans to do just that.  This won’t be easy work, &amp; there is plenty to do.
The SSA must find ways to be more efficient &amp; modernize the Disability Insurance program.
This year, the SSA received an additional $90 million in funding to address the disability backlog.
While some progress has been made, there’s more work to be done. And more $ is NOT the answer…
This is in large part because Social Security continues to rely on outdated criteria to determine eligibility for disability benefits.
Since ‘03, Social Security’s disability programs have been on the GAO’s high risk list…
But Social Security’s problems when it comes to Disability Insurance program is more than just wait times that are far too long.
And for those who don’t qualify for benefits, these long wait times make getting back to work even harder.
While not all of them will qualify for benefits, all of these people deserve an answer in a timely fashion.
On average these folks will wait around 600 days to get that hearing.
Today, over 1 million ppl are waiting for a hearing w/ an SSA Administrative Law Judge.
But for those applying for disability benefits, that isn’t the case.
Americans rightfully expect that when they apply for benefits, if they are eligible, that they will receive them quickly.
Folks pay taxes on their hard-earned $ for the promise of future Social Security benefits - an important part of their financial security
The Disability Insurance program is too important for Social Security to not get it right.

As I've said before, we clearly can't tax our way to solvency.
Acc. to Social Security Chief Actuary, even w/o a taxable maximum, the program will be run cash flow deficits again w/in the NEXT DECADE!
I asked Chief Actuary Stephen Goss: if all earning were subject to payroll taxes, would Social Security be solvent?  HE SAID NO.
Some ppl suggest we get rid of the taxable minimum &amp; subject ALL earnings to payroll taxes...
He said: there's no question there is a risk of that.
I also asked the Chief Actuary how confident he is that we aren't going to lose additional Disability Insurance solvency a few yrs from now.
I asked the Chief Actuary if he agrees the longer Congress waits to address solvency, the bigger the changes would have to be? He agreed
Congress has a responsibility to the American ppl to ensure our children &amp; grandchildren can count on Social Security like folks do today.
Millions of Americans rely on this important program &amp; millions more pay in w/ the expectation of future benefits.
3)Protect the most vulnerable. And 4) Improve retirement security.
1) Modernize Social Security to reflect today’s workers &amp; their families. 2) Reward hard work...
In addition to permanently fixing the program, I believe any plan should meet the following principles:
When Congress acts, we need to be sure we’ve finally got Social Security on the right track.
It’s not enough to just push out the trust fund exhaustion date by a few yrs.
Social Security is too important to not give workers &amp; their families the certainty of a permanent fix.
@RepJohnLarson &amp; I have both introduced plans, &amp; while very different, they both permanently fix Social Security’s solvency.
I appreciate @RepJohnLarson for also recognizing Social Security is in trouble &amp; needs to be fixed.
…it only makes the problem worse &amp; the choices MORE difficult bc some options will no longer be on the table.
While we may have different views on how to solve the problem, not talking about it won’t make it go away…
Fixing Social Security will require tough choices.
Worse, that cost will continue to increase every yr Congress doesn’t act.  6 yrs ago, it was $6.5 trillion.
The trustees also tell us that today it would take $12.5 TRILLION to make Social Security solvent over the next 75 yrs.
Once the trust funds are exhausted, Social Security will only be able to pay 77% of promised benefits.
At that point, folks including current beneficiaries would face across-the-board benefit cuts if Congress doesn’t act.
In fact, the trustees report tells us that Social Security’s combined trust funds will be exhausted in 2034.
In the Social Security Chief Actuary’s report, he outlines serious challenges that this program faces.
But to ensure those earned benefits will be there in the future for our children &amp; grandchildren, Congress must act NOW.
Social Security provides important retirement &amp; disability benefits that millions of Americans rely on.

…And that the Social Security Trust Funds get the taxes they’re owed.  The American people deserve nothing less (19/19)
We need to be sure state &amp; local employees pay the right amount of taxes &amp; receive the Social Security benefits they’re counting on…
Let me be clear.  The answer here isn’t mandatory coverage.  Social Security &amp; IRS need to get their act together
And if ppl receive benefits w/o having paid the correct $ of Social Security taxes, Social Security Trust Funds &amp; taxpayers pay for it
If ppl think they’re covered, but aren’t acc. to Social Security, they may not qualify for Social Security benefits they’ve been counting on
These problems can go undetected for yrs &amp; have real consequences for Americans’ retirement security &amp; for Social Security’s Trust Funds
Even though payroll taxes are the biggest tax most people pay, efforts to improve compliance generally focus on other taxes
And the IRS still doesn’t know whether the employer reported &amp; paid the correct amount of payroll taxes w/o doing an audit
Social Security still doesn’t have the ability to verify state &amp; local govs are properly reporting wages for covered workers
Social Security &amp; IRS must rely on public employers to ensure compliance. Not much has changed
In 2010 GAO found Social Security &amp; IRS have trouble identifying problems w/ Social Security coverage for state &amp; local gov employees
W/ all this complexity, it’s up to Social Security, the IRS, &amp; states to work together to get it right.  But that doesn’t always happen
But who is covered can vary by state and even locality!
Overtime, the law was changed to allow state and local governments to extend Social Security coverage to their employees
When Social Security was created, state &amp; local government employees were excluded due to Constitutional concerns
Why is figuring out their Social Security coverage &amp; payroll tax compliance so complicated?
But today, we’re focusing on the close to 3/4 of state &amp; local workers who are covered…
Usually when we talk about state &amp; local workers &amp; Social Security, we talk about how many of them aren’t covered by Social Security

ICYMI, here's my response to President Trump’s Joint Session of Congress address last night https://t.co/WVZOtTOEaF
I thank our witnesses for being here today and I look forward to hearing their testimony. (25/25)
We can all agree that the American people deserve better, and Social Security must take this responsibility seriously.  (24/25)
But unless the person comes to Social Security and says “I now need help,” it’s hard for SS to figure it out. (23/25)
Just because someone doesn’t need a rep payee when they 1st claim benefits doesn’t mean they won’t need help later. (22/25)
Another concern is that SS doesn’t have a way to see if someone’s ability to manage their benefits has changed over time.  (21/25)
It’s hard to be sure if decisions that are being made are the right ones when evidence is missing.  (20/25)
According to a 2015 study, more than 3/4 of cases reviewed were incomplete &amp; over 40% were missing required lay evidence.  (19/25)
One concern is that SS employees routinely fail to complete “capability determination” tests…  (18/25)
The Institute of Medicine, Social Security IG, &amp; Social Security have ALL raised serious questions about the rep payee program (17/25)
Deciding who needs help managing benefits is an important responsibility, and Social Security has to get it right.  (16/25)
Lay evidence = evidence other than legal or medical evidence that provides info about whether someone can manage their money. (15/25)
SS field office employees use lay and medical evidence to make this decision – and lay evidence is the deciding factor. (14/25)
In the latter case, Social Security conducts what’s called a “capability determination” to see if the person needs assistance. (13/25)
Some ppl w/ rep payees decide for themselves they need help.  Other times a Social Security employee suggests someone needs help. (12/25)
That’s about 5.5 million ppl. And it doesn’t include those receiving Supplemental Security Income w/ representative payees (11/25)
Did you know about 9% of those receiving Social Security benefits get help from a representative payee to manage their benefits? (10/25)
Today’s hearing will focus on 1) those who need help, &amp; 2) the process Social Security uses to identify them.  (9/25)
We'll need to work together to ensure the rep payee program meets today’s challenges. It's too important not to get it right. (8/25)
After the hearings, I ask Social Security to send a report covering challenges as well as required improvements &amp; legislative needs. (7/25)
And we need to see if there are any changes needed in the program to ensure Americans receive the service they expect &amp; deserve. (6/25)
We need to make sure Social Security is improving to meet today’s challenges… (5/25)
We need to make sure Social Security’s representative payee program is working the way it should… (4/25)
The last time Congress made changes to the representative payee program was 13 yrs ago.  Today we are taking a fresh look. (3/25)
Who are representative payees? They're people Social Security authorizes to receive benefit payments on behalf of a beneficiary. (2/25)

This disapproval resolution is supported across the political spectrum: f/ the disability community, to the @NRA, to the @ACLU.  (5/7)
Furthermore, needing help to manage your benefits does NOT make you dangerous. (4/7)
Just because someone has a disability does NOT mean they’re a threat to society. (3/7)
My resolution today is about the constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities. (2/7)
Don’t miss my closing remarks on the House Floor about my resolution to protect Americans’ 2nd Amendment rights!  (1/7)
I thank @RepAbraham for his support on this important effort, &amp; I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  (12/12)
We need to stop @BarackObama’s discriminatory rule NOW so Constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities are protected (11/12)
But support doesn’t stop there. Disability community, 2nd Amendment groups, civil rights groups, &amp; others are on board. (10/12)
According to National Council on Disability: 	https://t.co/rKAABMNzs8 https://t.co/ahbphg0BJR
The disability community has also raised serious concerns with @BarackObama’s rule. (8/12)
Furthermore, needing help to manage your benefit does NOT make you dangerous. (7/12)
This is WRONG. Just because someone has a disability does NOT mean they’re a threat to society. (6/12)
@BarackObama’s rule: certain Social Security disability beneficiaries who need help managing benefits would lose 2nd Amendment rights (5/12)

Today is about understanding why these 2 respected groups have very different conclusions on just how much trouble Social Security is in
Congress count on the experts, like CBO and the Trustees, to help us figure out how to best do that.
Americans want, need, and deserve to be able to count on Social Security. And it’s up to Congress to make the changes so they can.
We may not all agree on the best way to make Social Security solvent, but we NEED an ACCURATE picture of Social Security’s financial health
While a plan may be solvent according to the Trustees, it might not even get close if you ask CBO.
With CBO and the Trustees so far apart, it’s hard to know if a Social Security plan will actually make the program solvent...
Last year their estimates of Social Security’s shortfall were over 60% apart.  Now they are over 75% apart.
…They also don’t agree on when Social Security’s Trust Funds will be exhausted…
CBO &amp; the Trustees don’t agree on whether Social Security’s finances got better or worse this year...
…And those differences have a real impact.
Today, CBO &amp; Trustees look at the same historical data but use different approaches &amp; make different assumptions about the future...
Both CBO &amp; Trustees have looked at Social Security’s finances for yrs.  But Trustees &amp; CBO differ on how much trouble Social Security is in
When it comes to Social Security’s solvency, the Social Security Trustees’ estimates aren’t lining up w/ the Congressional Budget Office
Future generations should be able to count on Social Security just like seniors &amp; individuals w/ disabilities do today.
…The longer we wait, the tougher it becomes to fix it.  Congress must make the tough choices based on the best, most accurate info available
We all know how important Social Security is to the millions of Americans who rely on it.  But Social Security is in trouble…
WATCH LIVE as I chair a @WaysandMeansGOP subcommittee hearing on the future solvency of Social Security https://t.co/Mwz5B5PMul
I urge all Members to vote yes &amp; pass the Social Security Mail Act today! This should be signed into law w/o delay!
My Social Security MAIL Act is a commonsense solution to a problem that shouldn’t exist in the first place.
Americans rightfully expect that the @SocialSecurity Admin keeps their personal information safe.
My bill, the Social Security MAIL Act, is commonsense legislation supported by @AARP &amp; @MatureAmericans
My bill requires @SocialSecurity to either remove SS #s from mailings, or explain why including a Social Security Number is necessary.
Just last year, @SocialSecurity sent out more than 233 million letters that include FULL Social Security Numbers.  This needs to stop. NOW.
Unfortunately, while progress has been made, the @SocialSecurity Admin still includes SS #s on some documents it mails. In fact...
…And for years I have been calling for ending the use of Social Security Numbers unless it’s absolutely necessary.
Time and time again, Americans are warned to protect their Social Security cards in order to avoid identity theft.  For good reason…
@SocialSecurity makes a point of telling Americans how important it is to protect their Social Security Numbers…

Social Security has to get its IT right, the first time. This is what Americans want, need, and deserve.
Make no mistake, Social Security must modernize its Information Technology infrastructure, but they have to do it responsibly.
...earned by plans that can be followed, staying within a budget, and getting the job done on time (if not early).
The American people have the right to be skeptical.  Trust is something that is earned...
...Yet Social Security had no problem asking for $300 million to redo its entire IT system w/o sharing a plan for how to get it done.
DCPS doesn’t inspire much confidence.  You can’t just ignore $300 million in taxpayers' dollars spent on a failed approach.
Ex: SS has been trying for yrs to develop the Disability Case Processing System, a single piece of software.
But today we'll also hear Social Security’s track record isn’t always good when it comes to IT...
It won’t be easy, but Social Security has to get it right.  The American people expect nothing less.
In this yr’s President’s Budget, Social Security admitted the patchwork approach isn’t working &amp; it's time to overhaul the entire system.
Good news: Social Security has finally recognized it has a big problem.
For years I have been sounding the alarm on the state of Social Security’s outdated &amp; aging Information Technology
Social Security’s employees lose 20 min daily due to technology problems.  This wasted time costs SS nearly $200 million annually
That’s time that lost f/ helping another claimant, processing earnings info of a Disability Insurance beneficiary, or answering phones.
And worse, there is a true cost to this old technology because it takes Social Security employees longer than it should to do a simple task…
Social Security has new hardware – new computers &amp; new data centers – but their software is out of date &amp; hasn’t been updated in years.
…or they have to rehire retirees to update its programs because they are the only ones who know how.  This is ridiculous.
That means right now Social Security has to spend time &amp; resources training workers in ancient computer languages like COBOL...
Did you know Social Security still relies on computer code so outdated they don’t even teach it in classrooms?
But even though it's so important, Social Security’s IT hasn’t kept up with advances in technology.
Social Security’s Information Technology infrastructure touches the lives of nearly every American.
WATCH NOW as I chair @WaysandMeansGOP Social Security Subcommittee on the modernization of Social Security’s IT https://t.co/Mwz5B5PMul
The Social Security MAIL Act is common sense, and Americans deserve nothing less.
My bill makes sure Social Security gets the job done so Americans’ personal identities aren’t unduly endangered.
We need to put a stop to this now.  Americans can’t afford to wait until Social Security just finds the time to get around to it…
I asked the Acting Commissioner about it. She said Social Security was committed to removing SSNs f/ mailings, but they need to show a PLAN.
In 2015 Social Security’s IG found that Social Security still sent out more than 233 million letters with full SSNs in them…
We got it done w/ Medicare Cards, but there’s more to be done to protect folks' SSNs.
Social Security tells Americans how important it is to protect their SSNs and the Social Security cards.  For good reason!
… &amp; IF Social Security believes including the SSN is necessary, they have to justify it. They ALSO will report to Congress 2X a year
My bill, the Social Security MAIL Act, requires Social Security to remove Social Security Numbers (SSN) from mailings…

Social Security is important to millions of Americans &amp; I will continue working to ensure its a program that future generations can count on
Social Security faces serious challenges &amp; needs serious solutions – not empty words &amp; plans that don’t add up.
Bottom line: we cannot tax our way to solvency.
Mr. Goss confirms: even if EVERY $ of earnings were subject to pay roll tax, it would NOT make Social Security Solvent.
I just asked Mr. Goss if Social Security would be solvent if we raised the taxable maximum to cover 90% of earnings...his answer? NO.
…and that the trustee overstated Social Security’s trouble. BUT Mr. Goss DENIED it was possible for 1 trustee to control the entire process.
This year the report process was done W/O Public Trustees.  Yet some Dems argue one of the Public Trustees took over the process…
I look forward to hearing f/ witness Stephen C. Goss, Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration as we work to find solutions.
Reform must first start w/ getting the program on sound &amp; sustainable financial footing. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to fix.
BC even taxing EVERY $ of earnings wouldn’t make Social Security solvent, let alone give the program enough for higher benefits.
Earlier in June @BarackObama spoke about his Social Security plan.  But he forgot one important thing. When you're in a hole, stop digging!
Actions speak for themselves &amp; it’s clear this Admin is not serious when it comes to Social Security.
We all know Social Security is in trouble. To fix it, we need to know what we’re up against. So you'd think the report would be on time!
ICYMI, the Admin’s Trustees report is 82 days past the MANDATORY deadline this year. And it's been late the past 8 yrs. This is WRONG!

As a veteran of two wars, I can tell you that our servicemembers should not be penalized when it comes to saving for their retirement.
...The IRS already allows this for state &amp; local workers and teachers. Our servicemembers should be given the same choice.
My bill would allow these Servicemembers to contribute the max to both their civilian 401(k) AND military TSP!
You see, the IRS caps the amount an individual can save for their retirement through work. That's where my bill comes into play!
...as a result, they don't get the TSP match to help make up for the reduction in pensions bc of the IRS.
......guard &amp; reserve forces who contribute the max $$ possible in their civilian jobs can't then participate in the TSP...
Unfortunately these reforms may harm guard &amp; reserve forces who happen to also participate in the retirement plan at their civilian jobs
...BUT it also included a 1st time ever match for Servicemember's retirement contributions in their TSP...

Dr. Fichtner ALSO confirmed @RepKevinBrady WEP solution would help BOTH new &amp; current beneficiaries but @BarackObama’s proposal would NOT.
@WaysandMeansGOP witness Dr. Fichtner just confirmed @RepKevinBrady WEP solution (HR 711) takes effect in ’17 - 10 yrs before @BarackObama’s
@RepKevinBrady has introduced H.R. 711, which would responsibly address WEP, &amp; I am proud to co-sponsor this effort.
ALL workers have a right to know what their Social Security benefits will be so they can best prepare for their retirements.

What's worse, the IG ALSO confirmed this tax credit can ENCOURAGE illegal immigration.
Did you know the IG confirmed illegals are filing tax returns &amp; claiming the additional child tax credit? This is WRONG!
My bill would require tax filers to provide their SS # in order to claim the $1,000 refundable child tax credit. Simple common sense!

Sec. Lew basically denied that SS is worse off under Obama. But numbers don't lie...
Since 2009 the state of Social Security keeps getting worse.  Worse yet @BarackObama doesn’t say a THING about fixing SS in his #2017budget
At @WaysandMeansGOP hearing, I just asked Secretary Lew if he agrees Social Security finances have gotten worse since Obama took office.
@SecBurwell had some good news: my law that requires Medicare cards NOT include Social Security #s is on track! Reissues to be done by 2019.
...she skirted the question &amp; didn't answer. W/ over $19 TRILLION in debt, this is WRONG.
I also asked @SecBurwell how much Obama's refugee plan will cost American taxpayers given refugee's long-term use of welfare programs..
...We can't take the risk of a terrorist slipping through bc we can't vet these folks. ALSO, TX receives about 10% of refugees...
...This is an increase of over 30,000 f/ 2015, w/ many of those refugees coming f/ Syria. Well it's no secret that I oppose Obama's plan...
I just asked @SecBurwell to confirm whether @BarackObama is proposing an increase in the # of refugees to at least 100,000. She said yes.

When Bowe Bergdahl deserted his post, he abandoned his country and his military family. This is NOT serving w/ "honor &amp; distinction."

My measure to protect seniors from identity theft passed committee today! LEARN MORE HERE: http://t.co/BATYPBPsKo
@WaysandMeansGOP just passed by measure to protect our seniors f/ identity theft by removing Social Security numbers f/ Medicare cards!
Let’s protect our seniors and end the use of social security numbers on Medicare cards once and for all.
Seniors being targeted for identity theft is a problem that has gone on for far too long!
…this makes no sense! It puts Medicare beneficiaries like the over 80,000 in my district at risk if their wallet is lost or stolen!
The problem is that seniors’ Medicare cards include their Social Security Numbers…
Your Social Security number is the key to identity theft, &amp; thieves know that!
If we really want to get serious about protecting seniors f/ identity theft, we need to take Social Security Numbers OFF the Medicare card.
Today @WaysandMeansGOP is voting on a measure of mine to protect seniors from identity theft!
...let’s make Social Security better for its current beneficiaries as well as its future ones – our children and grandchildren!
Social Security can &amp; MUST work better for people w/ disabilities as well as for the hardworking American taxpayer.
Let’s discuss ideas on how to make Social Security work better. Ignoring the problem isn’t right, fair, or honest.
Let’s stop kicking the can down the road and start FIXING THE PROBLEM. This is what American taxpayers want, need, &amp; DESERVE.
Bailing out the disability program by robbing the retirement program – which will go insolvent even sooner – is IRRESPONSIBLE.
...and 4th: I’m committed to promoting OPPORTUNITY for those trying to return to work.
...3rd: I’m committed to making the Disability Insurance program work BETTER.
...2nd: I’m committed to preventing a 20% across-the-board benefit cut.
...1st: I’m committed to ensuring benefits continue to be paid to individuals w/ disabilities &amp; their family members that rely on them.
I’m making a 4-pt commitment to the disability community &amp; I’m asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me!
FACT: In less than 2 yrs, the Disability Insurance program will not have enough $ to pay benefits. Dems want to ignore. I say let's fix it!
Thanks to individuals f/ disability community for coming to the hearing! You know better than most that DI program is not w/o its problems!
TUNE IN NOW: I'm chairing the @WaysandMeansGOP Social Security hearing on protecting the solvency of this important program!
IMPORTANT UPDATE: due to poor weather conditions, we will be rescheduling our Mobile Office Hours. Check back for new dates and be safe!

President Obama, what happened to not kicking the can down the road? http://t.co/lAzJBbMiRp
The President's only plan is a budget gimmick. Taking from senior¹s Social Security to pay disability benefits doesn¹t solve anything.
As Social Security Chairman, I'm committed to ensuring this important program is there for Americans who need it.
Obama's budget betrays his 2009 pledge to fix Social Security.  Americans deserve better.
...the longterm shortfall has DOUBLED from $5.3 trillion to $10.6 trillion. That means Social Security can't pay for promises it has made.
Over past 5 yrs Social Security shortfall has doubled. We CANNOT keep kicking the can down the road!
