@ttaylorfitness @mattgaetz @DonaldJTrumpJr @AndrewGillum Myself and Troy Taylor have developed a civil dialogue to agree and disagree. Troy @GOP vs Hakim @DEM. We respect each other and we go at it and discuss about the political climate we have in our country today. Let’s talk about it, keep our temper in check and no name callings.
@ttaylorfitness @mattgaetz @DonaldJTrumpJr @AndrewGillum Let’s keep our conversation intellectual and with substance, we have our differences and opinions that may not fit others thoughts. Let have civility towards others and not let kind of civil discourse ruin what we use to have in our democracy.

Get over all this we are great stuff and start helping the people in the country who built it.
America is great at locking people up and giving them 20 years, and the rich people who doesn’t pay taxes and steal charities and millions of dollars are rewarded with being POTUS and a slap on the wrist.
And if any republicans especially a die hard trump supporter who believes trump over god! Do your research before you comment.

@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Fox News have most entertainers ie Sean hannity who are not journalists and use lies to push a base who calls the other news outlets fake media that is pushed mostly by Donald Trump.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Some are trolls and some are led away and others made their own decisions. Candace Owens defines it as leaving the democratic plantation which I find very offensive.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Nice to know that thank you.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren We rely on journalists resources and research to report the news correctly. We agree 50/50 but the president is tainting the media as enemy of America. What news outlet do you get your news from?
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Walk away is a video. I’m reading the hashtag in a different sense.

@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren I can’t have a opinion on collusion because they are still investigating and Muller have all the facts, not us.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren The discussions about this topic of uranium 1 is not going to finish in the civilian sector of the population. We don’t have all the facts. I still read articles and mentions about the subject so I learn more and I won’t debate it because it’s divisive.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren The senators and representatives were asked and they declined to answer. You have to fact check before we put our credibility on the line in any forums.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren I read the article and read other articles on the same subject. They are all trying to just get her on donations to her foundation.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren But this transaction was done in 2013...
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Trump said yesterday 7 new steel factories are opening in Pennsylvania. The steel industry said they have no knowledge of his announcement and his facts are wrong. Why is lying and how can you support someone blatantly lying to families who depend on these jobs.

@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Don’t need to worry about that, you’ve already underscored in every point you try to make. But hey cult followers are always blinded with incorrect facts.
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Fact...polls are determined by averages, not just a pollster that belongs to the party they support. #FactCheck
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Your fact that the state Department is the only one that approved the sale of uranium 1 is incorrect. #FactCheck
@ttaylorfitness @MarkEnger2 @TomiLahren Your FACTS about Uranium 1 is incorrect, your polls are also incorrect.... and much more. The facts are there, but republican supporters like yourself have become blinded by trump. Your party has become a cult. AND WHAT THE HELL IS “Q”???

@Judy71548704 @TomiLahren I can see by your statement you’re one of the poorly educated.... now that you have access to the internet try educating yourself on American civics and do so world civics too.
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren So how can one person make this sale solely.
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren That’s a little fact for you
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren Uranium an asset with national security implications, Rosatom was subject to approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment,the Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, Energy, Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, as well as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren You stated incorrectly, and it’s kinda useless discussing this with you. Your comments are all talking points used by republicans.
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren Do yourself a favor, you’re really ignorant to the facts right now, so do some research to see how the transactions were made and stop with the talking points. You’re looking bad bigley.
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren Glad you copy a paste this story. But did you know it takes 6 more departments to approve the purchase. So this decision wasn’t made by solely one person. #FACT
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren Explain in short Uranium 1
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren Thank you... my point made. #MicDrop

@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren The difference between me and you is race is not a factor. I told you I was a black immigrant because it gets you riled up. You find someone weaknesses they show their colors (no pun).
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren (INFIDEL: a person who does not believe in religion or who adheres to a religion other than one's own.) I used the word to describe the cult and the followers of the new trump republicans party.
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren Go back and read your tweets then listen to Donald. Your party has become a cult (you do know what cult means). You’re now thought by your leader to hate other races. And why is it so important for you to know who I voted for?
@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren And the country is flawed with infidels like you....

@ttaylorfitness @TomiLahren What inconsistency???? They continue the same way every day even if the facts are staring them in the eyes. One voter said he has to consult with trump first before he believe god....They’re consistent.
