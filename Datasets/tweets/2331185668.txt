Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.		https://t.co/0toprjpf0P
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.		https://t.co/0toprjpf0P
A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing. 		https://t.co/0toprjpf0P
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment. 		https://t.co/0toprjpf0P
