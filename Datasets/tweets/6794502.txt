"It's not worth taking a victory if you can't get something real worthwhile done!" -@WaxmanClimate #SpeakForHealth
When should we compromise? @drJoshS "A compromise that moves you further is worth taking." #SpeakForHealth
Following up: @WaxmanClimate says naming a disease or other public health issue is a great way to raise awareness and spread education and collaborative work. "But we shouldn't be too narrowly focused," we can take advantage of those narrow focuses when possible! #SpeakForHealth
.@drJoshS asks a great Q: how should we strategize? Bank on putting all our eggs in the most visible public health basket? Or advocate for general public health funding? Is there a right or wrong way to do this work? #SpeakForHealth
"Don't wait for government. We may have a long wait to get things done. The groundwork can be set to educate the public and the groups here have a role to play in doing that, as well as pushing good public policy." -@WaxmanClimate #SpeakForHealth
.@drJoshS asks what can people do, when they really care about something, to "push the tide of history in the right direction?" @WaxmanClimate says Learn To Lobby. When you're passionate and educated, you can creatively address roots of public health issues. #SpeakForHealth
Climate change is real, it's happening, it's human-made, and public health needs to "build on public awareness and get people to realize how dangerous these effects are," says @WaxmanClimate. #SpeakForHealth
Life doesn't stop, even when we #SpeakForHealth, as @WaxmanClimate mutes a call on his cell. We've all been there! https://t.co/oP5Ty5pUGz
Looking back on tobacco regulation, @WaxmanClimate says it has been a long uphill battle. Not until 2009 was the FDA given jurisdiction to regulate tobacco delivery products (like cigarettes). Regulation can change attitudes and change health outcomes! #SpeakForHealth
That's @WaxmanClimate, and we see you Amanda! Keep it up and #SpeakForHealth! https://t.co/N6VlqLYYA9

"We need these programs, because they're focused on the needs of the patients!" Talking #socialdeterminants, not just in the patient-provider sense, but is much larger. -@WaxmanClimate #SpeakForHealth
.@WaxmanClimate discussing the launch of the Ryan White program to address HIV/AIDS. Comprehensive, holistic, and @drJoshS notes, it didn't matter if someone had legal status to be in the U.S. or not. #SpeakForHealth
Importance of truth, honesty, openness and science: @WaxmanClimate remembers during Reagan administration, "they wouldn't even say the word AIDS." Added to stigma, slower pace to address the epidemic. #SpeakForHealth https://t.co/ouAoHmVtu4

"We have an obligation to help those we can help" says @HHS_ASH. That's fighting stigma, working with communities to meet their individual and specific needs and more. #SpeakForHealth
This is the first time @HHS_ASH has given this talk on the new HIV plan (since it was announced in #SOTU19 last night). So #SpeakForHealth attendees know more about it than anyone else! (Of course! Public health always has its finger on the pulse!)
