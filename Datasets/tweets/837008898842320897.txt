@realDonaldTrump God you're such a loser. Grow up you little, sniveling baby.
@realDonaldTrump Right. That's why you left early. Your Mr. Art Of The No Deal. You couldn't deal your way out of a paper bag. But I guess it's better to have no deal than for you to give away the store.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows ROFL All aboard the crazy train.
@RepMattGaetz @RepAndyBiggsAZ Right. Sure ok, and what exactly did that big beautiful tax cut do? Just added much more to the debt. So pardon me for not being impressed by your fake concern. Loser.
@realDonaldTrump Oh Ya, Mr. Art Of The No Deal is back. You should have stayed overseas. The only reason you visited the troops is because that is where Air Force One re-fueled, it's not like you went out of your way. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews 🤢

@realDonaldTrump No you're there to sell the farm.
@realDonaldTrump Oh good grief, stop already. You're just making most of this crap up. I don't believe in late term abortion but I sure as hell don't want some ignorant lawmakers to tell me what I can and can not do with MY body.
@LindseyGrahamSC Sit down Lindsey, you're not effective anymore so just wait for your term in the senate to expire.
@realDonaldTrump Oh that's funny. Leading through lies, ya you would know all about that you stupid, little, insecure man baby.
@realDonaldTrump 🤢
@RepMattGaetz I remember when Muller was appointed all I heard from republicans was how much of a stand up guy he is &amp; how he was the right choice. Hmm, strange how you have changed. You're nothing but backstabbing thugs. And was it not Muller who kicked Strzok off the case. Try again, loser

I'm from Missouri the 'Show Me State' so I want you to Show Me this wall that's being built, so put up or shut up. 2nd don't you dare take money from the military for this useless wall, that would be unforgivable, they need the money more than you &amp; your stupid wall.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣 Right! And I'm the Jolly Green Giant. All you have to do is listen to 5 minutes of your crap to know that nothing has changed and you have no intention of cooperating with the possible deal made this evening. So screw you.

@HawleyMO @realDonaldTrump ... You don't give a damn about us. We were able to push out Mr. 50 Shades Of Grey Greitens &amp; we can do the same to you. Never forget that!
@HawleyMO @realDonaldTrump ROFL oh your funny, not! Under Trump our &amp; our friends tax refund was cut in half. My medications went up in price &amp; I can't afford it now. And YOU are suing to end affordable health care. We haven't forgotten about that. So just shut up &amp; resign you hack! ...
@realDonaldTrump This is what I think of the SOTU. It's scary. Our &amp; our friends tax refund was cut in half. I can't afford my medications, the prices went up this year. So where is the fairness for us? There is none. The billionaires run this country &amp; we are their pawns, plain &amp; simple.
and we are their pawns.
This is what I think of the SOTU. It's bad. Our tax refund was cut in half and we are not the only one, most people we know have had this happen. I can't afford my medications anymore. So where is the justice for us? There is none. The billionaires run this country now...
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity So what, we don't care about you anymore.
@JayDevereaux @sun_of_orion @Jim_Jordan @vmpcott @MariaBartiromo 🙄

@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @marthamaccallum NO!
@realDonaldTrump Wow, I really don't give a crap.
@realDonaldTrump So, since you're a supposed criminal does that mean we can throw you across the border?
@george_capen Yep, same here. And we really relied on that refund.

@realDonaldTrump You're such a waste of time &amp; space.
@senatemajldr How can you in good conscious stand by Trump when he threatens our national security daily. And his bad mouthing and calling what our intel leaders are saying as fake news is sick. Fix this mess! Tape Trump's mouth shut!
@RoyBlunt @USDOL If you're on the side of Trump &amp; McConnell then you are against us. I live in Joplin so I know what a real crisis looks like &amp; I saw the state take homes thru eminent domain. Knock this crap off! We pushed "Mr. 50 Shades Of Grey Greitens" out, and we can do the same to you.
@RoyBlunt @USDOL How can you in good conscious stand by Trump when he threatens our national security daily. And his bad mouthing and calling what our intel leaders say is fake news is sick. And you're sick for allowing this crap. Resign you hack or be pushed out like Greitens.
@HawleyMO I'm not here to talk about this subject. I want to talk about Trump saying that what our intel leaders said is fake news. He's putting us in real danger. You better start standing up for us. We pushed Mr. 50 Shades Of Grey Greitens out we can push you out too.
@RoyBlunt @DHSgov How can you in good conscious stand by Trump when he threatens our national security daily. And his bad mouthing and calling what our intel leaders say is fake news is sick. And you're sick for allowing this crap. Resign you hack or be pushed out like Greitens.

@realDonaldTrump Oh good, glad you made that clear. Which means he's telling the truth and you are not.
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Idiot!
@realDonaldTrump You are so stupid, it's unbelievable.
@realDonaldTrump How do you serve as the president when you lie 10 time every single day? You're a damn disgrace.

@realDonaldTrump Well, you better hide your broomstick.

@SenHawleyPress @SOPFLWRegion @HawleyMO @fortleonardwood You are a completely wasted Missouri vote. Do us all a favor and high tail it out of government. You are proving to be such a waste of space. Get the government open. Get! It! DONE! Or get out!
@LindseyGrahamSC @AOC What the hell is wrong with you. You are one hateful, bitter old man now. Time for you to move on.
@realDonaldTrump There really is no need for you to give a SOTU address, we already know you are a jackass and the the SOTU is in disarray. Next!
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @seanhannity @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the warning. I'll be sure to miss it then.
@GOPLeader Hell f'ing no. No!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Aww is Lindsey the Trump a** kisser upset? Too bad! Open the dang government. Then have the the State of the Union. But we already know what state we're in, dysfunctional, we don't need Trump to tell us that. Good Grief. You're such a joke.
@senatemajldr Ya right, your funny. I don't want a damn wall, open the government.
@realDonaldTrump Open the government you loser.
@realDonaldTrump Open the government you loser!
@realDonaldTrump 😐 Open the damn government you man baby. 👶🙄
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It's very sad for our country that Trump is throwing a man baby tantrum. Open the damn government, then debate the wall. You all are such whinny little babies, someone needs to send a box of binkies, security blankets and diapers to the White House.
@RoyBlunt Do your damn job! Open the government, or else it's bye bye Roy Boy.
@VP @POTUS 😐 You're an idiot following an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump You're an idiot.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Hey Lindsey, did you ever stop to think that the democrats in office are doing what I want them to be doing? Oh no, I bet you just blow us citizens off as liabilities instead of constituents.
@realDonaldTrump Awww Trumpy's little feelings are hurt because he can't snap his fingers and bend other counties to his will and push them around. Grow up. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump Hmm, no I haven't heard that. Maybe these "many people" are just talking inside your head. You are just a man baby throwing a fit, now that is real news. Do the right thing and open the government!
@realDonaldTrump Open the government you spoiled man baby.
@RoyBlunt I won't repeat what the other fine people here have already said. But I do have one thing I'd like to add to this conversation. Your fired! Good luck getting reelected you lazy, hypocritical, moronic, a** kisser.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS 🤣
@realDonaldTrump Ooo I'm so convinced! As if. 🙄
@RoyBlunt No one has the right to tell me what to do with my body. Keep your damn nose out of my business. I don't approve of abortion after a certain point in a pregnancy but before that, you can bugger off.

@realDonaldTrump Yep your causing a humanitarian crisis alright. Time for you to go. Hopefully to jail.
@realDonaldTrump OMG you insecure little baby. Who gives a damn about the election at this point. Your not winning, we are not winning because of you and your messed up mind.
@realDonaldTrump You had your chance to sign then Fox news pushed you around and you ran like a chicken.
@realDonaldTrump I'm so sick of these hokey videos. Don't you have better things to do, like run the country than produce this propaganda crap. Time to get back down to earth and get your heads out of the TV show gig.

@realDonaldTrump It was great until you came along. Now we will have to make it great again after you leave because of your lies, your love affair with dictators and how you wrecked this country.
@realDonaldTrump hmm ok, I guess they are interviewing doppelgangers to say they don't want a shutdown. You guys are good 🙄
@realDonaldTrump LOL right. How many times have we seen you lose your cool. I totally believe you slammed you hand down on the table because that is what babies do when they can't get their way. On to the next lie.
@dbongino 😐 Sure, ok.
@LindseyGrahamSC @senjudiciary I can't believe that you're going to take the word of Barr. Man you really are either gullible or a spineless jellyfish. Why don't you just resign, you can't be trusted in a position of power.
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up already. I'm so sick of your crap.
@realDonaldTrump Right, whatever you say boss 🙄
@JohnHRSmith @realDonaldTrump That is true, he is drawing a line right down the middle of America and dividing us all. Congratulations.
@realDonaldTrump You know what. I don't think we need you as president. We might as well let Fox news take over. They are taking over as it is, might as well make it official.
@HistorianMom @RoyBlunt Thank you so much for bringing up the environmental cost
@RoyBlunt I want national security, no doubt. But what I can't abide is you cozying up to Trump. End this shutdown now, or risk getting voted out, which I may do anyway. Let me say this as plainly as possible. Border security = Yes. Border wall = Hell no!
@evie121462 @mommamia1217 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Do you live under a rock?
@realDonaldTrump You're Mr. Art of the no deal. You're afraid of your own base &amp; afraid of lawyers &amp; law enforcement that are breathing down your neck. You are a poor little chicken sitting in a corner lashing out at anyone who gets near you. Sad! Just resign already.
@realDonaldTrump You're Mr. Art of the no deal. You're afraid of your own base, your afraid of lawyers and law enforcement that are breathing down your neck. You are a poor little chicken sitting in a corner lashing out at anyone who gets near you. Just do us all a favor and resign.
@RoyBlunt I want security throughout the nation. I love our law enforcement officers, they put their lives on the line for us everyday. But let me make this clear. Border security = Absolutely. Border wall = Hell no! Work to get us out of this shutdown or face getting voted out!
@PhilBrown62 @ThankfulThinker @RoyBlunt Thanks for the correction =)
@realDonaldTrump Let me make this simple for you. Boarder security = Yes. Boarder wall = Hell no!
@RepMarkMeadows 🤣🤣🤣 OMG you are such a lamebrain. It's you and your party screwing up. Let me make this clear, and I hope your small brain can understand. Boarder security = Absolutely. Boarder wall = Hell no!
@WhiteHouse Let me make this simple for you. Boarder security = Yes. Boarder wall = Hell no!
@realDonaldTrump You are such an ass. Resign!
@realDonaldTrump Awww the poor ity bity baby is throwing a damn little fit. Resign you disgusting pig.
@sendavidperdue Ya but, but, but that's what Trump is doing. Hypocrite.
@realDonaldTrump Hey now, wait a hot second. I thought you were against any more lawyers going to the border. I think you said "They will give anyone a licence to practice law, we need less lawyers not more"

@realDonaldTrump Wow! You really don't know anything at all. Just resign already.
@realDonaldTrump You're such a loser. If there is any "Harassment" it's coming from you. And screw your damn border wall. Bring in more tech, which I'm sure you know nothing about.

@LindseyGrahamSC 😐 sure why not. Let's build that wall around you and Trump and we will drop ship supplies once a month, maybe.
@LindseyGrahamSC Let me say this as simply as I can so you can understand. Border security = Good. Border Wall = Bad, Stupid. Understand?
#TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 OMG your to funny 🤣 you have 💩 for 🧠
@PressSec I've got to say it was pretty sweet to see you get a smack down by Fox. I could watch that over and over. And stop spreading your filthy lies about democrats not wanting border security. Better security is needed but we don't need The Great Wall of BS.
@LindseyGrahamSC Oh no need to wait. Yes we hate him that much. But as for me I want security, not a Great Wall of BS.
@LindseyGrahamSC No! Absolutely not. Security spending yes, wall no f'ing way!
@realDonaldTrump Go directly to the seventh level of hell and burn forever.

@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 No, they don't ask because they know you will make up some stupid lie. How many lies have you told today? Have you hit a new all time high?
@realDonaldTrump Says the man retweeting his own tweets. Brilliant.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣
@IvankaTrump 😐 Ya whatever. You don't give a crap about anyone but yourself. Like father, like daughter.
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up you over stuffed baby. 👶
@realDonaldTrump Yaaa try again stupid.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo 😐 Blah, blah, blah.
@realDonaldTrump There are criminals in the White House and your administration. Time to catch, detain, and throw away the key. You are putting our country in great danger. Not good.
@realDonaldTrump Just stop your whining you big baby.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 OMG your so needy. Hey everyone look over here, I haven't had my daily allotment of mindless devotion.
@realDonaldTrump Um, okay, that was totally random and useless. We were always great, that is until you came along.
@realDonaldTrump You are by far the dumbest president ever!
@realDonaldTrump What the bloody hell is wrong with you? Today your rot was slug all over the place. How dare you brush aside Khashoggi and stand with Saudi Arabria! And WTH was that with the turkey pardon? You can't get anything right.

@realDonaldTrump @mauriciomacri My heart goes out to the sailors. But I can tell you didn't write this tweet, too many big words &amp; it shows concern which you only have for yourself &amp; your family. @IvankaTrump used her private email for WH business so I say to you. Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
@IvankaTrump You used your private email for official White House business. Really! Lock you up! Lock you up! Lock you up!
@MichelleMC01 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ROFL

@realDonaldTrump You: Blah, blah. Blah, blah, Blah. BHAH!  Us: LOL 😐🙄🤣
@realDonaldTrump All I hear/see from you is "Blah, blah. Blah bhal Blah.  BLAH!"
@realDonaldTrump uh ha sure 😑
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up
@realDonaldTrump blah, blah, blah. 😐
@realDonaldTrump Ok, who wrote this for you because we all know you didn't.
@realDonaldTrump Ya, sure, that's exactly why. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up already.
@realDonaldTrump We're going to have to fumigate our state after you leave.
@realDonaldTrump But this is an awesome development, keep attacking your own party, this will work out great for you. ROFL

@SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 Ya right. You have 💩 for 🧠
@LindseyGrahamSC Just be quiet and go sit in the corner with Trump. If you need a binky, one will be provided.
@realDonaldTrump WTH is wrong with you? If I were you I'd go to the doctor and see if you are suffering from heavy metal poisoning, you know for all that gold you surround yourself in. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump @KevinYoder You and the people you support do not support vets. My husband is a disabled vet who got a letter in June saying he lost 20% of his status &amp; benefits, plus his medical team moved to a city further away from us. Your Veterans Choice program is crap, it's just a idea in name only

@LindseyGrahamSC Good God man, what the hell is wrong with you? If you all conducted yourselves with honor and respect people wouldn't have a reason to yell at you. Get a grip and wake up.
@realDonaldTrump Don't come to Missouri this week. We don't want you and your hate here. I have had enough of your crap.
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL ROFL DeSantis how funny, he's such a joke. And btw don't come to Missouri this week. We don't want you and your hate here.
@realDonaldTrump You are the most hateful person I've ever seen. And don't come to Missouri this week. We don't want you and your hate here.
@realDonaldTrump Don't come to Missouri this week. We don't want you and your hate here.
@realDonaldTrump Don't come to Missouri this week. We don't want you and your hate here.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You never learn.
@realDonaldTrump Just don't and say you did. We don't give a crap about the lies you will tell.
@ShimonPro When will this nightmare end?
@realDonaldTrump 😐 I really don't feel sorry for you. It's not our fault that most of your followers are Russian bots.
@realDonaldTrump Oh look, the van the bomber drove is plastered with your bumper stickers. Imagine that, odd isn't it 🤨
@realDonaldTrump Go sit in the corner and suck your thumb you big baby.
@realDonaldTrump You are full on 🦇💩🤪
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣As if!
@realDonaldTrump No, sorry try again. The only one who is hateful and inciting violence is you. Get real.
@senatemajldr @SecretService @USPS 😐
@realDonaldTrump I don't believe a word you say Liar! You're dancing a gig right now. You hate the media and democrats, you keep saying they are "enemies" and this is what happens. You don't give a 💩about anyone but yourself.
@PressSec As if, you don't care one bit. All you, Trump &amp; Pence do is demean the press and democrats. I don't believe a single word you say. You're such a liar.
@VP @CNN @SecretService @FBI Sorry I don't believe a word you say. 4 bombs sent to 4 Trump/your democratic "enemies", so tell me this, is this the togetherness and good Christian values you support. Shame on all of you.
@realDonaldTrump Lies, Lies, Lies!!! And in other news, all the people and news groups you hate are now getting bombs and ect in the mail. I hope you're happy now you SOB! GTHO of the White House.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump What about American Senators who disrespect our country, will they pay a heavy price? They should, you should too.
@sahluwal WTF! This is insane.
@realDonaldTrump Oh good, that means republican politicians will be thrown in jail.
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL 💩 for 🧠

@realDonaldTrump @DaveBratVA7th You don't give a damn about veterans. My husband is a disabled veteran &amp; in June he got a letter saying he was losing 20% of disability status &amp; his medical team moved to a different city further away &amp; your veterans choice program is BS. So thanks for nothing loser.
@realDonaldTrump @DaveBratVA7th Copy, paste, repeat. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump Oh so you mean he acts more like you.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 deep breath 🤣🤣🤣 You're 🦇💩🤪
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Damn, you're a laugh riot.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣  You have 💩for🧠
@realDonaldTrump You just can't help yourself from lying. Sad!
@IvankaTrump Why are you still hanging around?
@realDonaldTrump You're such a whinny little baby, go to bed and suck your thumb.
@realDonaldTrump I'm glad you put (END) in all caps and in parentheses, without that I don't think I'd understand what you meant. 🙄
@RepMarkMeadows You forgot to mention the ninjas hiding in the hallways.
@JeffFlake @MaxBoot There is no plight of conservatives, conservatives are the plight.
@realDonaldTrump Ya, you have to have that "Star" power to pass your BS meter.
@realDonaldTrump Sure, I'm certain he will do a through job, as if. Sort of like how you had the FBI expand the Kavanaugh background check. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump Why is he still there? Because he's good at his job and you don't like that. Like you and your followers like to say. Deal with it!
@realDonaldTrump You are stark raving mad. I see a rubber room in your future.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I have an idea. Why don't you root around in the slop like the good little piggy you are.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you get your binky &amp; security blanket &amp; go back to bed. The only people who cry "I'm not a baby, I'm not a baby, I'm not a baby" is in fact a baby. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump Yes there is and it's coming from you. So sit down and be quiet.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 You have 💩 for 🧠
@realDonaldTrump 😐
@WhiteHouse OMG! You are totally crazy! What is this crap of being advised by the overly dramatic Kanye West? That is the dumbest thing I've heard. Are you going to give him a job the White House?
@jaketapper @CNN I so don't care. If you can't handle the lime light, then get out.
I feel like nothing matters anymore. The government doesn't represent us, they don't give a damn about anything we want. And seeing all the damage from the hurricanes it brings me back to May 22, 2011 and the Joplin tornado. I just want to give up, what's the point. No one cares.
@realDonaldTrump OM F'ing G! There is NO clean coal!
@EricTrump @HawleyMO Get out of Missouri and never come back, and take Hawley with you, both of you are such a gd joke, you are nothing but nay sayers and lairs.
@USATODAY @usatodayopinion 🤣🤣🤣 What a crock of 💩

@slandry49 @ChicagoPhotoSho @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣
@SenatorCollins 😐Sure, so tell me again why I should ever believe you? You have no credibility, none, nada. Why don't you just retire like so many other republicans.
@Jim_Jordan 😐 like I believe anything you say, get real.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣  💩for🧠
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse 🤣🤣🤣
@FLOTUS WTH!
@realDonaldTrump You're so stupid and a liar, your a stupid liar. You can't even come up with a convincing lie. Sad!
@LindseyGrahamSC 🤣Aww baby Lindsey is following in the footsteps of toddler Trump, how cute.
@oper313 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump WTF is this crap. OMG this is so stupid 🤣🤣🤣
@JohnCornyn Oh for God sake, stop spewing this nonsense. You're worse than a moody teenager, they at least have an excuse, you do not.
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @seanhannity Ya, so?
@WhiteHouse 🤣🤣🤣 who cares.
@senorrinhatch He did this to himself, he didn't have to act like a baby or screaming toddler. Get real, we all saw it, well maybe not you, your eyesight may not be so good anymore.
@realDonaldTrump Right. Just because you have to hand out t-shirts &amp; signs &amp; pay people to stand behind you at rallies doesn't mean the rest of the US does. What a weak argument.
@Sen_JoeManchin I found your spine in the hallway, do you want me to return it or can you continue to live without it?
@JeffFlake I'm so glad you're not running for re-election. You're a joke, but you sure did Trump a favor with your stupid smokescreen.
@SenatorCollins Thanks for setting women back 50 years.
@realDonaldTrump Go to hell. If you're mad about this issue then that means you do it yourself at your rallies, you pay supporters to wear your t-shirts, wave your signs. So the more you bitch the more we know it's true. Just remember, if you point your finger there are 3 pointing at you
@ChuckGrassley Oh please, don't give me your sanctimonious BS, all I have to say to you is Merrick Garland. So sit down and shut up. You like dishing out crap but you don't seem to like the same treatment. Isn't that what Kavanaugh said, what goes around comes around.
@sendavidperdue 😐
@SenMikeLee 😐 Of course not. Trump didn't allow that.
@AnnAust5555 @justlikeyou_R @SenBobCorker 🤣🤣🤣 *deep breath* 🤣🤣🤣

@SenJeffMerkley I have to blink back my tears. I was raped at 16 &amp; I will never forget &amp; now I feel just as helpless &amp; hopeless. I feel like our government has forsaken me. The indignant, unbridled rage coming from Kavanaugh &amp; the republicans is repugnant &amp; sicking, proving they are unfit.

@SenGillibrand I have to blink back the tears. I was raped at 16 and I will never forget. And now I feel just as helpless and hopeless as I once did. I feel like our government has forsaken me.
@SenBobCorker 😐WTH! Don't leave the senate in a shambles and the courts tainted. You can leave public service but we have to live with what you leave behind. Don't condemn us. Or do you even care anymore?
@JeffFlake Don't leave the senate in a shambles and the courts tainted. You can leave but we have to live with what you left behind. Don't condemn us.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Thanks for the warning, I'll be sure to miss it. You and Kavanaugh are totally unhinged and unstable. Get help and send Kavanaugh to jail.
@senatemajldr I simply do not have the words for or about you. You will be judged for this one day and you will not like what you are confronted with. The truth will win out, and you will go down as one of the worst majority leaders in history. Good riddance to bad rubbish!
@Emma_Dumain @LindseyGrahamSC 😡
@BrettKavanaugh @senjudiciary @cspan Your just an angry man and your not believable at all, in fact your a joke.
@DianeAHayes @BrettKavanaugh @senjudiciary @cspan 🤣🤣
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews @ChickfilA A creep interviewing a creep!
@SenBobCorker Are you brain dead!
@senatemajldr No to Kavanaugh!! You better be prepared to take a lot of heat if you confirm him.
@SenBillCassidy Ya, I don't think so. You are the most lawless republicans I've ever seen. And all I have to say is Merrick Garland, you all started this crap and payback is a bitch, so just deal with it, isn't that what you always try to say to democrats. Payback!
@realDonaldTrump Yes we know exactly why you picked him, because you only hire the best criminals.
@Alyssa_Milano @KellyannePolls I simply can not believe the arrogance of Kavanaugh. He acts guilty as hell. How dare he yell and interrupt the senators. This was a mockery.
@hughhewitt @LindseyGrahamSC @JohnMcCain @BenSasse @SenateGOP 🤣🤣🤣
@ToddRokita ROFL because judicial nominee's should have no questions surrounding them, that is not the case here. And being belligerent isn't helping your case. Get real.
RT @MalcolmNance: @LindseyGrahamSC clearly waited for @SenJohnMcCain death to turn into a passionate bootlick and betray his own eulogy to…
@LindseyGrahamSC Oh that was a glorious temper tantrum. You need to go to the doctor &amp; get some meds for that condition &amp; you shouldn't run for office after this, because you need some serious help. Oh &amp; btw your nominee is not doing so well, you all are just making it easier to reject him.
I wonder how long it took for Kavanaugh to cry on demand, well not even really crying because he hasn't had to wipe away one tear. I don't believe a single word he says, he's not the victim here. This is so bogus!
I wonder how long it took for Kavanaugh to cry on demand. I don't believe a single word he say.  This is so bogus!
@davidaxelrod That's not the way I saw it.
@CBSNews I thought it was odd that he produced a list of 65 woman who back him the day after the first allegation was made. Hmmm.
@CBSNews Oh boo hoo hoo, you've been coached well, how long did it take you to cry on demand?
@realDonaldTrump You know and have all the best criminals.
@foxandfriends @LindseyGrahamSC I just saw you in the hallway and all I have to say to you is Merrick Garland, this is all on you guys. Payback is a bitch, so just deal with it!
It seems to me that the prosecutor for the republicans seems uncomfortable at times. Almost as if she's thinking I can't believe I have to do this.
@WhiteHouse LOL as if.
@RVAwonk I was raped when I was 16 and I remember the same thing, the laughter and having bruises on my wrist. What is happening in that hearing is disgraceful.
@foxandfriends @LindseyGrahamSC Stop this sham hearing now, you should be ashamed of yourself. What would your friend McCain think of you now? Call in the other witnesses, subpoena Mark Judge. Open a FBI investigation now, or pull Kavanaugh!! This is a disgusting display of no rule of law!
@ChuckGrassley Stop this sham hearing now. Call in the other witnesses, subpoena Mark Judge now. Open a FBI investigation now, or pull Kavanaugh!! This is a disgusting display of no rule of law!

@WhiteHouse Good ol President Nutjob. This was the longest news conference I've ever had to endure.
@RoyBlunt @POTUS So when will it be time to kick Kavanaugh to the curb? It better be pretty damn soon!
@LACaldwellDC @kasie @HeidiPrzybyla It's 6:13 when is the next accusation to drop?
OMG WTH did I just watch? Trump is so disturbed it's not funny.
@PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump Trump is a third rate human who is good at making false accusations, like he has done all his life. He is just looking for attention and he doesn't want people to look at his past record and relationships - what a total low-life!
@realDonaldTrump Oh for pity sake, another stupid copy, paste, repeat tweet. Don't you have more important things to do?
@Jim_Jordan Are you serious? You are a complete disgrace.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Lets not and say we did.
@realDonaldTrump ROFL ya right, I was literally laughing so hard my sides hurt.
@LindseyGrahamSC @marthamaccallum Only if you say your ending this repulsive joke of a confirmation. You disgust me.
@realDonaldTrump My husband is a disabled Vet, he first served in the Army then reup'ed in the Navy. In June he got a letter saying he lost 20% of his status &amp; his VA medical team moved to a city far away. Your VA choice program is a sham, you should be ashamed but you'd need a soul for that.

@VP @SecondLady @WhiteHouse @POTUS Really? Then tell me this, my husband who was first in the Army then reup'ed in the Navy and in June my husband got a letter saying that he lost 20% of his VA disability and his medical team moved to another city. So what's up with that? You're all liars.
@realDonaldTrump @JayWebberNJ I'm pretty sick of these copy, paste, repeat tweets. Talk about lazy.
@realDonaldTrump Nothing has changed for my husband at work. But he did lose 20% of his VA disability status and his medical team moved to a city further away. So your idea veterans picking any doctor near you is also BS. All you do is F'in lie about everything, big or small, you just don't care.

@insomniacx29 @realDonaldTrump And Trump is the real clown from the movie "It". That image will give a person nightmares.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Sure ok. I saw people at this rally that weren't amused, some didn't clap, some were yawning and best yet, some people just got up and left. It was awesome.
@realDonaldTrump This may be the most telling rally ever. I loved it. lol there were very few people smiling, some people didn't clap, some were yawning, and some just left. Ya, keep up the great work hahaha.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump True, but they did show people not clapping, not smiling, and people getting up and leaving. Go figure.

@realDonaldTrump Awe poor baby is throwing a fit again.
@realDonaldTrump Says Dumbbell Donnie.
@realDonaldTrump Sure, because you are so believable.
@alicetweet Sure, if you say so. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump You might have had a point up until you said Woodward is a Dem, then you lost your credibility. Again.
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec 🤣🤣🤣 Oh sorry. No I'm not sorry. Sarah is a bigger liar than you are.
@WhiteHouse And lied in his last confirmation hearing. That's just what we need. 🙄
@HannahKellyMO @clairecmc There is no way in hell I want Kavanaugh. He lied in his last confirmation hearing. So your ok having a criminal president appointing a lying justice. Got it. 🙄
@HannahKellyMO @clairecmc Good!
@WhiteHouse Riiiiight. Sure. What exactly have you been smoking?
@WhiteHouse A criminal president shouldn't appoint a justice who lied in his last confirmation hearing. Period.
@GovMikeHuckabee 😐 Oooo I'm so shaken up by your remarks. Not. Who cares what you think.
@Jim_Jordan Dems plan: Get rid of you.
@VP @Reuters 😐 Shut up Pence. If you won't stand up for the press here then don't talk about the press worldwide you hypocrite. 🙄 How stupid.
@PressSec @CNN Who gives a crap about what you think.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 ...  ... ... 🤣🤣 Your funny. You are such a 🐦🧠
@realDonaldTrump Another copy, &lt;insert new name&gt;, paste &amp; repeat routine.
@realDonaldTrump Every time you tweet your projecting what you have done yourself. So keep tweeting so the record can be saved in public view forever. 😉
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ya, don't even try to go there. Because every time you open your mouth all you show is your hate, venom, and scream at the masses and expect everyone to jump. Get over yourself, you two bit hack.
@GovMikeHuckabee I love your calm demeanor. 🤣
@GovMikeHuckabee 🤣🤣🤣 It's called doing the work. Something you know nothing about.
@ChuckGrassley Stop this! Allow us to have a fair hearing! Do you even know what that means anymore. We want All documents! This hearing needs to be postponed until this is done! The public does not want Kavanaugh. Wake Up! We don't want a liar! He lied at his last hearing.
@ObfuscateClear @SenateMajLdr 😐Oh I'm so scared of a name caller.
@SenateMajLdr Stop this! Allow us to have a fair hearing! Do you even know what that means anymore. No I don't think so. We want All documents! This hearing needs to be postponed until this is done! The public does not want Kavanaugh. Wake Up! We don't want a crook!
@asomer @ChuckGrassley This needs to be postponed until this is done! That is what I mean by vote no today. I actually want a delay until all documents are handed over.
@asomer @ChuckGrassley Yes a fair hearing means having all the relevant documents before this goes forward. Duh!

@realDonaldTrump Um, ya it is.
@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett You are insane!
@realDonaldTrump And exactly how many of Your people have immunity now? Ya that's what so. sthu
@realDonaldTrump You don't get it or maybe you do that's why you fight so hard against justice. But I'll leave you with this. Power corrupts &amp; absolute power corrupts absolutely &amp; you are nothing but corrupt. You are like a stain, a disease on our government. But rest assured we have an antidote
@CorinneMartino1 @DebBlois @realDonaldTrump Yes, you can count me in as being horrified, outraged and embarrassed by this president. Who is only president in title but not in reality.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump *sigh* Time for the binky again.

@realDonaldTrump You are the one who is weak on Vets! How about taking care of them! My husband served in the Army then Navy &amp; in June he got a letter saying he lost 20% of this disability. Your a Liar! You don't give a crap about anyone but yourself. Resign!
@realDonaldTrump I Have Had Enough Of Your Crap! What the freaking hell is wrong with you Trump! Resign you loser.
@realDonaldTrump BS! How about taking care of our Vets! My husband served in the Army then Navy &amp; in June he got a letter saying he lost 20% of this disability status. Your a Liar! You don't give a crap about anyone but yourself. Resign!
@realDonaldTrump You are a🐦🧠 and   🦇💩🤪
@realDonaldTrump OMG I could only watch 12 minutes of this garbage. John McCain had more people honor him today than Trump, and tomorrow John will have even more come to pay their respects. That's something little Trumpy Wampy will never have.
@realDonaldTrump I noticed some of the people behind you didn't seem as enthusiastic compared to your previous rally crowds. Strange. Maybe people are finally getting sick of you.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 *deep breath* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You are 🦇💩🤪

@realDonaldTrump 🤢
@realDonaldTrump You don't care about Vets &amp; I'm sure who you support doesn't care about Vets anymore than you. Your administration took 20% of my husbands disabled veterans status away. You are repugnant.
@realDonaldTrump No matter how many times you tweet today, this day isn't about you, it's about honoring McCain.
@realDonaldTrump No matter how many times you tweet today this day isn't about you. That must be driving you crazy.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump He's the copy, paste, repeat president.
@realDonaldTrump Really? Does he love Vets the way you do? My husband is a disabled vet who first served in the Army then Navy. You say you love our military but you hate veterans. In June my husband got a letter saying he was losing 20% of his status. Thanks for nothing, how is this helping?
@realDonaldTrump ...And get used to me here on twitter because I'm going to keep posting about my disabled veteran husband. He served his country with honor &amp; your administration doesn't care. So I'm going to post about him on every single one of your hateful, stupid tweets, you are repugnant.

@LindseyGrahamSC @IvankaTrump ... So since you have changed your opinion of Trump &amp; you now support every, petty, hateful thing he does than I can't support you.

@realDonaldTrump Stop the BS!
@realDonaldTrump Dumb, dumb, dumb.
@realDonaldTrump You are the worlds dumbest and largest crybaby of all time.
@realDonaldTrump You Are An Idiot!
@thehill Oh no, no, no. That man is crazier than Trump.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Sure like I'm going to believe fake Fox news about a fake president.
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to start setting alarms for us to get up, tell us what and when to eat and tell us to go to bed? I don't think so,  just deal with what we want to read or not read loser.
@bobbirightmyer @realDonaldTrump I'm with you.
@realDonaldTrump No, I'm pretty sure you don't appreciate him one little bit.
@realDonaldTrump Why do we still have a dishonest, lying dirt bag as president.
@realDonaldTrump Who cares.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ROFL not even. And um, I'm pretty sure they don't have security clearances any more, Duh!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Me too, I lost faith in you a long, long time ago. And I have no faith in the Fake Fox news, it is nothing but state run tv. Such BS.
@realDonaldTrump You are a true idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Desperate are we? That's always a bad sign when you keep retweeting yourself.
@realDonaldTrump Another swing, another miss. Congratulations, you didn't get anything concrete done, yet again. Your body language and facial expressions said it all lol. Exactly how many times did the Mexican president mention Canada? I stopped counting after 5 or 6.
@realDonaldTrump Copy, insert name, paste, repeat. Ya that shows a whole lot of real support.
@realDonaldTrump Another swing, another miss. Congratulations, you didn't get anything concrete done, yet again. Your body language and facial expressions said it all lol. Exactly how many times did the Mexican president mention Canada? I stopped counting after 7.
@kylegriffin1 ROFL I know, I couldn't stop laughing either. That was epic.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain 😐 I'm sorry for the loss of your friend, it is a truly sad time. Maybe now you can follow in his footsteps and stop being a 100% yes man for Trump. You are a Trump puppet now. Sad.
@RepMarkMeadows You should be proud. You're a champion liar. Congratulations.
@realDonaldTrump A great American died yesterday and 2 people were shot dead at a video game tournament in Florida today and all you freaking care about is your own sorry butt. There are not enough bad words to describe your vileness.
@AbsoluteTruthMG @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Seek medical help. I guess you don't know that spamming is for kids.
@realDonaldTrump How sad. You have nothing good to say so you just repost your own tweets. Funny.
@cindymccain My heart aches for you. Be strong, just know he will be watching you from above, and comfort you in times of need. Take care.
@MeghanMcCain @SenJohnMcCain My heart aches for you. I know the lost of such a great dad, we have that in common. Take comfort that he will always be with you &amp; checking in on you from time to time. I don't know what else to say, I know you are hurting, I am too. Take care, be strong, and carry on. Love you.
@misterbumface @realDonaldTrump lol I love this, it's so clever =D
@realDonaldTrump And to think you just handed NK everything they wanted, world wide recognition and we got nada. Your such a loser.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 *gasping breath* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump Well imagine that, who would have thought things wouldn't work out with NK. I wish there was a warning before hand not to make such a sweeping deal with them. Oh wait, there was. Your such a stupid president.
@JillWineBanks I had the very same thought. Does he know people who have flipped or does he know people who have flipped on him. Could explain why he wants everyone to sign NDA's.
@KellyannePolls @ChrisCuomo 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You are such a joke Kellyanne.
@realDonaldTrump I know you said this should be illegal so I'm going to say it over and over like you like to repeat things. 	People are Flipping on you.	 Flipping	 Flipping	 Flipping	 Flipping	 Flipping	Everyone will eventually flip on you, get used to it.
@realDonaldTrump You know you're desperate when you RT yourself. Ok, that's a image of good mental health for ya. But from what you keep saying (over &amp; over &amp; over) since you won, the dems were supposed to win &amp; you &amp; Russia swayed it your way. Ok, got it.
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @SecretsBedard @dcexaminer 🤣🤣🤣🤣 *deep breath* 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@lisamurkowski 😐 You would be smart to vote against him. But I know you won't.
@VP @NASA_Johnson @JimBridenstine Until you bums in DC can care for our veterans you have no place in space. My husband who first served in the Army then reup'ed in the Navy lost 20% of his VA disability status last month. And his medical team moved further away &amp; he has no option of picking his own dr. that's BS
@VP @NASA_Johnson @JimBridenstine Shut up Pence, no one cares what you think. Your irrelevant and more than likely a criminal too so move aside.
@Rep_Hunter @pressenterprise Where do you scumbag criminals keep coming from.
@RandPaul Did you have a nice trip to Russia? You should have stayed.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews 🙄
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt Ooo geeze thanks for the warning. I'll be sure to have my tv on a different channel. But I have a question. Don't you ever work?
@realDonaldTrump And we have the most criminals in the WH than ever before. And I want my apology now then you can go to jail.
@realDonaldTrump Oh you'll get that wall alright, just not the way you want it.
@LindseyGrahamSC I strongly disagree with you. I demand the confirmation hearings be stopped right now. Period!
@PressSec @RichardGrenell So, do tell, are you ever going to have another press briefing? How are you going to spin the news of guilty pleas. I'm just asking for a friend.
@Scott9357Scott @realDonaldTrump I'd say they were very poorly paid because some of those actors behind Trump were not smiling or didn't clap that much. It was sort of funny to see.
@LindseyGrahamSC Do your damn job and check this criminal president or resign right now!
@LindseyGrahamSC I demand the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! Period! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!
@realDonaldTrump Ding dong the king is dead and the court jester stole the crown. Have you ever heard of the card game crazy 8's well you just had 2 people place 8's on the pile and you lost.
I demand the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! Period! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!
@VP This is very sad &amp; all but we have other matters to discuss like demanding the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!
@VP This is very sad &amp; all but we have other pressing matters to talk about. I demand the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!
@VP @ICEgov @StateDept @RichardGrenell And don't get too comfortable when Trump gets kicked out of the WH because you will be next. There is no way in hell you didn't know about this crap or participated in Trump's illegal conspiracy. Be smart &amp; just walk away now. I will not permit another wingnut to take power!
@VP @ICEgov @StateDept @RichardGrenell I demand the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! Period! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!

@RoyBlunt Congratulation! I hate to distract from this happy moment. But I demand the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! Period! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!
@RoyBlunt Really?!? Veterans appreciation! My husband who first served in the Army then reup'ed in the Navy lost 20% of his VA disability status last month. And his medical team moved from Mt. Vernon to Springfield. You don't give a damn about our vets!
@SpeakerRyan Grow a spine and do your damn job. Check this criminal president, if I had it my way you would go to jail too just for not doing your job. Your a disgrace. Do Your Job!
@SenateMajLdr I demand the halt of the confirmation of Kavanaugh immediately, full stop! Period! A criminal president is unfit to appoint a SC judge into a seat that was stolen from the previous president. All of this stops now!
@realDonaldTrump Ding Dong the king is dead.
@WhiteHouse I think you all are in a great deal of trouble and all I can say is Ding Dong the king is deal.
@realDonaldTrump You spewed out enough crap here that it could fertilize an entire state. You, Manafort &amp; Cohen should have to spread it around as part of your prison punishment. Can't want to watch that. =)
@realDonaldTrump Well that was a nice heap of 💩
@7penguins @realDonaldTrump I know how you feel Thomas. My husband lost 20% of his VA disability staus last month. He was first in the Army then reup'ed in the Navy &amp; this is what he gets. It's disgusting! And they moved the VA hospital further away &amp; this crap of picking your Dr. is total BS.
@VP @POTUS My BS meter is going off. Gotta go and turn that damn thing off.
@GOP Ok, sure. And why would I take your word for it? You have all proven to be nothing but spineless, lying, jellyfish.
@realDonaldTrump You have to believe me because I'm your president. That's an order. Oh please, oh please, oh please believe me because I'm the best lair in the world. 😐 You know what? I don't believe a damn thing you say, you are so full of 💩 it's not even funny.
@realDonaldTrump No sorry, I still don't believe you. The more you tweet this dumb 💩 the less I believe you. Maybe you should check out the story of the boy who cried wolf.
@realDonaldTrump 🤨 This is just pathetic.
@realDonaldTrump Hmmm interesting. It looks like from the responses here that your not convincing very many people with your lies. You are such a small little man.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Sure, just telling yourself that. But I don't believe a damn thing you say.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Sound the alarm! The Trump train wreck is imminent. Maybe you all can avoid it if you get on your broomsticks and fly away now.
@realDonaldTrump ROFL ya right. That's not what you said before. But that's ok, just keep on tweeting, it's good for you, oops I mean it's good for us 😁 But you are such a gd liar. Face the facts, you &amp; your horrible family are deep doodoo. Bye now. Sleep well.
@realDonaldTrump If the economy is so great how about putting some of that money towards the VA. My husband who is a disabled veteran lost 20% of his status last month. He thought it was a mistake when he got the notification in mid June, but nope not a mistake. Thanks for nothing you lying SOB.
@realDonaldTrump You poor delusional fool.
@realDonaldTrump Hey, remember that time the Russians where in the Oval Office &amp; you blabbed about Israeli code word secrets to them or when Manchester was attacked they wouldn't share anything with you because you spilled the beans about the London attack that came before, no one can trust you
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for calling me a fool. I'll take that as a badge of honor.
@realDonaldTrump Social media is where we, Joe Public talk so stop griping about it you big baby, you can't silence us. If you want us to stop talking bad about you then straighten up &amp; act like a real President &amp; decent human being. Problem solved. Your such a hypocrite.
@realDonaldTrump Well if that's what you want then stop saying fake news all the damn time. Your such a hypocrite. Hahaha🤣🤣🤣And besides social media is where we the Joe Public talk so stop griping about that as well you big baby.

@GovMikeHuckabee 😐 So sorry. I have no intention of being an incubator. You don't have the right to tell us what we can or can not do with our own body. You only care about fetuses but not about the babies once they are born. If you don't want us to have abortions then cut off your balls.

@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity 🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity You can try to strip clearances or try to push out all the people who started or work on the Russia case but it won't work because each new person who sees this case sees corruption &amp; criminality so this will go on &amp; on &amp; on. Have a nice night.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Toot Toot, all aboard the crazy train. Your gross abuse of power is disgusting. Resign!
@realDonaldTrump No, I think it's you that is having a meltdown. Crime is hard isn't it.

@SenateMajLdr You better get off your duff and do something about your boy Trump. If you don't you're every bit the traitor he is. And you better hand over the paperwork of Kavanaugh or stop this horrible nominee!! Full Stop!
@realDonaldTrump 😐 Crazy train.
@realDonaldTrump You can try to push out all the people who started or work on this case but it won't work because each new person who sees this case sees corruption &amp; criminality so this will go on &amp; on &amp; on. Have a nice day.
@PressSec So you fully support Trump turning our country into a dick-taorship, what is this BS about security clearances. What is next, killing political opponents like ex officials, reporters &amp; anyone that disagrees with you or Trump. Putin must be so proud. Take your vile hatred &amp; leave!
@realDonaldTrump So you have fully turned our country into a dick-taorship, what is this BS about security clearances. What is next killing political opponents like ex officials, reporters &amp; anyone that disagrees with you. Putin must be so proud. You are a petty, cruel, impotent, little man.
@realDonaldTrump You are insane!
@KeithRothfus @IvankaTrump 😐
@PressSec 😐 I'm so impressed, not. So when are you going to resign? Because I'm pretty sick of all your lies. Oh ya, you have to lie to make your idiot boss happy or else he may get out the leash and walk you out the door. Sucks to be you.
@thehill Nice! Congratulations!
@realDonaldTrump You are so messed up in the head. Good grief just resign already.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 Sure. This coming from a disgusting pig. You only hire the best people, until they cross you then all bets are off. You Are Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump You are freaking crazy. You should be in a rubber room forever. Your crazy rants don't even make sense anymore. Your just rambling off whatever comes into your head.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Oh you want facts, here one. You all sure don't love our vets. My husband who first served in the Army then later the Navy was hurt in service and he lost 20% of his disability status starting in July, so thanks for nothing you lying pos.
@realDonaldTrump You might love the military but you sure don't love our vets. My husband who first served in the Army then later the Navy was hurt in service and he lost 20% of his disability status starting in July, so thanks for nothing you lying pos.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump @MarkBurnettTV 😶 BS
@realDonaldTrump You might love the military but you sure don't love our vets. My husband who first served in the Army then later the Navy was hurt in service and he lost 20% of his disability status starting in July, so thanks for nothing you lying pos.

@Jim_Jordan 😐 You are so corrupt it's not even funny.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 I'm so sick of your crap.
@realDonaldTrump @JohnKasich 😐Sounds like you need your binky and security blanket again.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 And this matters why?
@realDonaldTrump Funny how you never said John McCain's name once. You know this bill was named for him. Your so disrespectful.
@realDonaldTrump When can we fire you? Just asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump Ok, if you say so, I haven't seen any new station supporting Omarosa, I don't know what news your watching.
@realDonaldTrump 😐Really? Your still going on about this nonsense. Boy you must be terrified of something about to come out.
@realDonaldTrump Sure, I believe that about as much as I could throw you. Your nothing but a GD liar.
@RoyBlunt You better not have a vote on Kavanaugh before all his work is handed over. You've been nothing but a huge disappointment.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I am shocked! Shocked! To see how stupid you are.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 *sigh* So bored now.
@TheReal_Ikrani @rosiegee818 @realDonaldTrump And he filed for bankruptcy at least 5 times. Ya that's some epic record. 😐
@VP You should be more worried about supporting human rights, democracy and freedom here first you stupid little man.
@realDonaldTrump Your a sad little man.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, really?!? You really love keeping people employed don't you. That's why you fired everyone that worked in the residence area of the WH, ended the cyber-security office, ended the voter security fund &amp; now you laid off 40 staff members at the office of financial research. 😐
@realDonaldTrump What's this? Your first GOP supporter just got busted for insider trading. Trump: I have all the best people. Truth: I have all the best criminals. We need to put all you political criminals behind glass or cages like a zoo so we can point &amp; laugh, maybe even throw peanuts at you
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @getongab @CNN 🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump Whoa, what's this. Your first GOP supporter just got busted for insider trading. Trump: I have all the best people. Truth: I have all the best criminals. We need a new prison system, put all you political criminals behind glass like a zoo so we can point &amp; laugh at you.
@realDonaldTrump "Your favorite President" Don't say things like that so early in the morning I nearly choked on my coffee. Trump: I have all the best people. Truth: I have all the best criminals. You &amp; your criminal family &amp; friends need to be behind glass so we can point &amp; laugh at you.
@realDonaldTrump Ya sure. You want world peace, sure you do. It will never happen because you have to fight with everyone, about everything. You love the fight so we will never have peace. Might doesn't make right, or two wrongs don't make a right. Not that you would care.
@TerryTerry31301 @realDonaldTrump Yes. Go, Josh, Go, far, far away.
@realDonaldTrump You are the most cruel person I've ever seen. This is on the level of looney tunes because your a damn clown, or more like the "IT" clown, your so evil.
@thehill Get rid of it, unless you want to clean up a mess every week when someone else takes a pick ax to it.
@globalsocialm2 @WhiteHouse 🤣🤣🤣
@WhiteHouse Ummm ya, that's BS.
@RoyBlunt @POTUS Shut up and step aside you lame duck. You and the Traitor-In-Chief have to go, but maybe you should go to jail together, you can be bunk mates, sounds like fun.
@TheMizzouTiger @RoyBlunt @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Might as well give up on Roy, he doesn't give a crap about any of us.
@ZacharyJHicker1 @LkAlpine @WhiteHouse 🤣🤣
@WhiteHouse 🤣🤣🤣 Oh stop it already, my sides hurt from laughing so hard. Get the facts lol, that's rich.

@realDonaldTrump 😐 Your so damn stupid.
@WheelSpin_FuelS @VincentArnone1 @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣
@GovMikeHuckabee 😐
@sseagalofficial Your a damn traitor. I'm shocked that your now a Russian citizen &amp; you've been appointed as a special envoy appointed by the Russian foreign ministry to be Putin's mouthpiece. Stay in Russia!
@sseagalofficial Hmm I can't believe that you became a Russian citizen &amp; now your officially a special envoy appointed by the Russian foreign ministry to improve relations between Putin &amp; the USA. I take back my disbelief, I do know what I think. I think your a damn Traitor. Just stay in Russia.
@realDonaldTrump That is true. The facts are coming out and they are so damning against you that you don't know what lie to tell. You can't even keep all your lies straight in your sick little head.
@realDonaldTrump My BS meter is going off.
@realDonaldTrump You are one sick puppy.
@realDonaldTrump No that would be you. Your a liar. I'm so sick of your crap.
@realDonaldTrump All aboard the crazy train.
@realDonaldTrump Blah, blah, blah. You just can't shut up can you?
@realDonaldTrump 🤢Your a disgusting pig.
@VHawthorne @loynaz1515 @ThePatriot293 @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣
@PressSec @CNN I do agree with you on one point today. I am outraged by what I see happening &amp; that come from you &amp; Trump &amp; your nonstop lies. Little lies, big lies, stupid lies &amp; then there's the cover up of lies with other lies. I see a trend here and I'm frankly sick to death of it.
@realDonaldTrump Oh ya I have one more thing to say. Stop Tweeting and get to work!
@realDonaldTrump Where's the Russian collusion? Look in the mirror.
@realDonaldTrump And I thought you said a long time ago that seeking opposition research is a totally normal thing, no matter where it comes from. 😐
@realDonaldTrump 😐🙄 oh brother
@RobertDRoseJr1 @VP @JointBasePHH @POTUS @codeofvets @greggutfeld @Scavino45 My husband is a disabled veteran. He served our country honorable &amp; last month his disability status was reduced by 20%. It is disgusting how this administration treats our vets. Sure they love the soldiers until they are hurt then they're of no use anymore &amp; are forgotten.
@realDonaldTrump 🐕Your barking up the wrong tree. You will go down in history as the worst president ever because you refuse to protect our elections &amp; you won't bring back the cyber-security position &amp; refund the election security fund. Your so bogus. Fake President. 🐓💩 Putin Puppet.
@realDonaldTrump You've got nothing to stand on so you just throw out crap and hope it sticks. lol You're a joke and the biggest liar ever. 😐 Stop campaigning and do you damn job, protect our elections!
@realDonaldTrump 😐😐🤣 So stupid.
@joeyliv @Homespun2105 @realDonaldTrump Oh ya Trump is really taking care of our vets. My husband first served in the Army then reup'ed in the Navy, he is now a disabled vet and last month he lost 20% of his services. Ya that's just f'ing great. 😐
@jeffking1976 @AndrewSolender @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣I bet your one of those Trump followers that believe you need a photo ID to buy groceries.
@realDonaldTrump Um, say what? 🤣 What kind of idiot believes you need a photo ID to buy groceries? Ohh...
@11thHour @Acosta @NBCNews @alivitali Wow, just wow. I can't believe what I'm seeing. I simply can't believe these people, wth.
@DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo 🤣🤣🤣 Oh trust me, I'm glad I missed it.
@Amy_Siskind @EricTrump @Acosta @Twitter @TwitterSafety @Twitter @TwitterSafety add my name to this complaint too. @EricTrump &amp; @realDonaldTrump are endangering journalist.

@GaryAClarkJr1 @realDonaldTrump 🤣
@realDonaldTrump 😐BS! Democrats don't want open borders, stop lying. And go ahead, shut down the government and see what it gets you. You won't like it. Idiot.
@Jim_Jordan @SenSchumer 😐 I'm so damn impressed with you, Not! What about funding for our disabled veterans like my husband who had his benefits reduced by 20% last month. What about soldiers like him? Hmmm. Crickets, that's what I thought. Go away idiot.
@Lizj56Liz @TxDankasaurus @schweinsister @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnBarrasso 🤣🤣🤣
@marti4667 @thewhiteychan @realDonaldTrump No I don't but Trump hates veterans. My husband is a disabled vet and his benefits were reduced by 20% last month. 😐 So cry me a river about how great Trump is.
@DLoesch Yet!
@realDonaldTrump 🤢 Your Such A Freak.
@realDonaldTrump hmmm, Ya it is. And yes you did. Give it up.
@realDonaldTrump @RepDeSantis Too bad you don't love our vets. You are such a hypocrite.
@realDonaldTrump Your a disgusting traitor &amp; the most unhinged person I've ever seen.
@realDonaldTrump No it doesn't makes sense but you'll do it anyway. Why don't you just start handing out guns to terrorist &amp; kids in school, church. Your a puppet for Russia &amp; the NRA. How dare you consult the NRA before our governmental depts. Before you NRA folks attack me I support the 2nd
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews BS! Iair!
@realDonaldTrump Your the biggest Russian puppet in the world and a pig headed creep.
@WhiteHouse BS, just more lies. I love how you pick and choose your facts.
@SophiaHelwani @GOP @realDonaldTrump Your just sad. 😟 poor little thing.
@seanspicer 🤣🤣
@WhiteHouse Hell No!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump BS! You &amp; Trump don't give a damn about disabled vets or do you only care about able bodied vets? My husband served first in the Army then the Navy &amp; was disabled in service &amp; his benefits was reduced by 20% last month. So go ahead &amp; tell me how much we're winning. You're a liar.
@SophiaHelwani @GOP @realDonaldTrump Haven't you heard that the walkaway movement was started by Russia, the secret is out. Oh ya silly me I forgot, you guys don't give a damn.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Hell No! And your damn right they are ready to obstruct this nominee because that is what I want. Kavanaugh is a creep. Never confirm, withdraw this scumbag.
@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump BS!
@RealAlexJones @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Freak!
@realDonaldTrump Just keep on tweeting Mr. Nutjob, the only illegal scam is your weak attempt to cover up your families crime. And your not smart enough to come up with a winning strategy.
@realDonaldTrump Now boarding the crazy train.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump ROFL LOLOL 🤣
@VP @POTUS 😴
@realDonaldTrump Oh really? So are they going to take your phone away and put duct tape on your mouth? And you're the only one saying enemy of the people, so you can stop your lying now.
@LindseyGrahamSC Hell No!!
@realDonaldTrump 😴 Bored now. You threaten to do this so much that it's meaningless now.
@realDonaldTrump Oh good grief, this is going to be a long day.
@realDonaldTrump Protect our elections! Reinstate the office of cyber security, refund the election security fund. If you don't then you really don't give a damn about security. We need a well rounded approach to security, it can't be about just one avenue. Understand? 🤨
@Billbrowder 😢
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Oh Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, your lies will only land you in hotter water but you don't care and don't want to take the steps to change, so be it. Go down the drain with Trump. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
@leonard_ralph @MiaFarrow @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Oh really, you want to pull the veterans card. My husband first served in the Army and then the Navy, he was disabled in service and as of last month he lost 20% of his disability so don't you Ever Dare say veterans are protected, get informed!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump OMG that's to funny. Umm deal with it. If you stop doing dumbass things then maybe the press wouldn't be so hard on you. Poor babies. I don't feel a bit sorry for you.
@GovMikeHuckabee @TBN 😐 Stupid.
@realDonaldTrump 😶
@WhiteHouse LOL oh your funny. You don't believe that any more than I do. You're all a bunch of liars.
@realDonaldTrump No thanks I'm good. Who'd want to see a tub of lard like you. Gag. 🤢 I might feel differently if you didn't attack all our friends &amp; cuddle up to dictators. But you could bring back the cybersecurity position &amp; election security fund. Oh ya, I forgot you don't want real security
@JillWineBanks 😢
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like you need a binky and security blanket. Do you need a nightlight as well? I still have one around here, I'd be happy to send it to you.
@realDonaldTrump 😐
@WhiteHouse Muh, I've seen better.
@BrendaStancil @kay_merlino @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump You have said many times that you want my senator McCaskill to lose &amp; now your Russian buddies are taking on that problem for you. So we can't trust our elections now all because of you &amp; the republicans for ending the election security fund. This is on your head.
@realDonaldTrump Ya right. We're winning so much that a Missouri nail plant is about to close. Many have been laid off and the plant may have to close entirely. Yaaaa I'm so sick of winning. 😐🙄

@perlmutations And yesterday in my state of Missouri, Trump was in KC &amp; bashed my senator Claire &amp; now we find out the Russians are trying to hack into her office emails. This is sicking. What The Bloody Hell Is Going On?!? I've had enough of this crap.

@realDonaldTrump You have said many times that you want Claire to lose &amp; we can see you have your Russian buddies taking on that problem on your behalf. So we can't trust our election now all because of you &amp; your love of all things Russian. Russian Puppet! Traitor!
@Jim_Jordan You can kiss that speakership goodbye. You don't give a damn about Russia interference, you don't care about election security, the only thing you care about is Trump's rump. My senator is being targeted by Russia &amp; you could care less, your too busy chasing ghost.
@realDonaldTrump Hmm just found out that my senator is being targeted by Russia &amp; guess what, low &amp; behold you &amp; the republicans just ended the election security fund. So from this point forward all this is on your heads. This Is Your Fault!
@realDonaldTrump @AlanDersh Hmm just found out that my senator is being targeted by Russia &amp; guess what, low &amp; behold you &amp; the republicans just ended the election security fund. So from this point forward all this is on your heads. This Is Your Fault. So GTH loser.

@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan ROFL omg your a riot. 🤣
@CongressmanHice Um no, I haven't lost confidence in the DOJ, just you. You all forgot what the rule of law means anymore. For you it's just steam ahead and rip everything in your path to shreds. I've had enough of this crap!
@SecPompeo If you want people to believe you, which I don't and never will, then I suggest you get rid of that stupid smirk on you face, all you did was show your contempt. Your a disaster in slow motion.
@SenateGOP Of course they are impressed, they are all criminals banding together. Trump does Not deserve another pick, he's under investigation &amp; handing us over to the Russians, and this pick will do anything Trump wants, including clearing him of all charges. Don't allow this to happen!!!
@RedTRaccoon lol this could be considered an effective therapy session.
@realDonaldTrump Sure, I'll believe it when I see it. You can't be trusted to tell the truth, ever! This will all implode in about a week.
@Jim_Jordan You don't need anymore info from the DOJ all your doing is breaking law &amp; order rules, leak confidential reports and stack the deck in your favor. Remember Rod is a republican appointed by Trump and when he actually found something bad you want to impeach. I Don't Think So!!
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan What a bunch of traitors, this will not go well for you lol
@JerryTravone @realDonaldTrump ROFL omg what is this crap lol 🤣🤣🤣so damn juvenile
@marcorubio what a time killer you are. That was a joke today. Stay on topic. Good grief what a loser.
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning 🤣🤣🤣
@nytimes Oh for God sake, what the hell is wrong with these people.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't care about our veterans. My husband lost 20% of his VA disability services, so stop lying to the people you hacks. My husband wants to know why he lost 20% and no one can answer that.
@SecretarySonny @POTUS Right. What ever you say.
@realDonaldTrump Awwww poor little baby Trump is upset again.
@realDonaldTrump You are a sleezy, lying, scumbag and your unfit to be the president of cell block C book club let alone the USA.
@Martamendoza718 @WhiteHouse um ok, this makes Trump look like a communist. Hmm, that's not a good look.
@realDonaldTrump Josh Hawley is a joke!
@WhiteHouse ROFL Josh Hawley is a joke.
@WhiteHouse We don't want him here, believe me. My husband wants the 20% of his disabled services that was taken away last month. Why was it taken away? You don't seem to really care about our veterans, it's all just lip service. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump And forget about Russia for now, my husband wants the 20% of his disabled services back that was taken away last month. You don't seem to give a damn about the veterans. Your a sad little man.
@realDonaldTrump Welcome to the crazy train. Get a good comprehensive mental health exam please. You have gone off the rails. And to the lawmakers, pass a law that all presidential candidates must have a extensive mental health exam before they run for office.
@realDonaldTrump It was already great.
@realDonaldTrump We don't want you here, believe me. And I think it's past time you have a comprehensive mental health exam because your acting really crazy. I also want to see my husband 20% disabled status returned which was taken away last month. You can't fix anything, Mr. Art Of The No Deal!
@VP @POTUS @SenBobCasey No, do not vote for this hypocrite Kavanagh. He will give Trump the go ahead to do whatever the hell he wants. Your a real loser Pence.
@WhiteHouse Return the 20% of disability services my husband lost under this stupid administration!
@LindseyGrahamSC Too bad the same can't be said about you.
@PressSec @POTUS @AmbJohnBolton You and Trump are a clear and present danger to America, and you are the real enemies of the people. And your both as crazy as hell
@realDonaldTrump You are a clear and present danger, and crazy as hell. You are the real enemy of the people.
@realDonaldTrump I demand that you have a full mental exam. And I demand that lawmakers make it a law that all presidential candidates have complete and extensive mental exams, we can't afford another nutjob like you to get in office.
@realDonaldTrump Well he better fly right and return the 20% of disabled services you all took away from my husband. How dare you all treat disabled vets like this. But I don't have high hopes that he will do any better or care any more than the rest of your administration. Sick!
@realDonaldTrump Too bad none of your families crap isn't made in America. I'm so done with you.
@realDonaldTrump Right, this coming from the demented fool in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 Stupid little man. Now read after me. Putin Is Enemy, Putin = Bad.
@realDonaldTrump Hey stupid. They broke the rules, you of all people should know about breaking rules and laws. Loser.
@realDonaldTrump What about American security, like election security that the republicans just zeroed out. What about security from you and Putin. Your a menace and joke. What A Loser.
@IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse Get lost.
@realDonaldTrump Ya you can believe it because you keep making it news. Loser.
@thehill How stupid. What is wrong with the republicans anymore.
@GOPChairwoman ROFL Right! omg your all crazy lol
@GOP ROFL as if. I object to Kavanaugh with every fiber of my being. You didn't respect &amp; allow a vote for Obama's pick. How dare you ask we have respect for a judge that will give Trump the cover he so desperately wants from his crimes. I want my senators to fight for me! Period!
@TIME Of course, why not, they only care about themselves and how they can profit off this time in office. These are truly sick people.
@NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson What the hell.
@GovMikeHuckabee @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump 🤢
@BryanLowry3 🤢
@VP @POTUS Resign Traitor!
@RoyBlunt Resign! Since you have no spine and don't give a damn that Trump wants Putin here in the fall then you are of no use to us. Get out.
Unreal. https://t.co/BjWGc6hi6B
@VP @GovParsonMO @AGJoshHawley @POTUS Never come back to Missouri, Traitor.
@VP @TAPSorg Traitor!!
@realDonaldTrump What the hell is wrong with you? Inviting Putin to DC. Your a damn idiot. One day I can tell my grandkids that you are the reason the USA fell &amp; if we can get back on track new laws will be made to prevent people like you from ever taking power again. Go to hell.
@realDonaldTrump What the hell is wrong with you? Inviting Putin to DC. Your a damn idiot. One day I can tell my grandkids that you are the reason the USA fell &amp; if we can get back on track new laws will be made to prevent people like you from ever taking power again. Go to hell
@PressSec @POTUS @AmbJohnBolton What the hell is wrong with you people. Your all traitors!
@realDonaldTrump But hopefully I will be able to tell my gradkids one day that because of you &amp; your horrible family a whole new line of laws will be voted on to prevent future presidents from doing exactly what you have. You will in that aspect make America great.
@realDonaldTrump 🤣No I hate the fact that Putin led you around like a bull with a ring in his nose. You are so incredibly weak, it's astonishing. No wonder you went bankrupt so many times. That's also why you allow Putin to lead you, you own to much money to Russia. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump Well, I guess no one told you about all the lost jobs in Missouri. Nail factories are going under, farmers are making next to no profits, Harley is leaving. So things are going great according to your delusional, feeble &amp; senile mind. You might want to check for gold toxicity
@JoyceWhiteVance Go figure, strange huh? Good grief, what the hell is going on.
@McFaul I just wanted to let you know that I support you 100% I'm really sorry you are being put thru this horrible predicament. I can't believe Trump would even consider offering you &amp; other people up like sacrificial lambs is disgusting. This is not the America I know anymore. Scary.
@DLoesch @Real_DrewButler So what does loud mouth DLoesch have to say about dirty Russian money going into the NRA and then buying dirty politicians. Well I know what to say, Your A Traitor.
@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump No thanks, I'll pass.
@realDonaldTrump @RepKevinYoder But you don't love our veterans. My husband first served in the Army then the Navy, he was hurt in the line of duty and last month he lost 20% of his disabled services. You don't give a damn about anyone but yourself.
@SecAzar @POTUS Get lost.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan It's a total disgrace that you want to hand over our ambassador to Russia. Your a disgrace and a traitor. And the fact you knew before the inauguration that Russia really did hack/meddle means your a criminal and traitor of the highest order. Go to hell Sir, go to hell.
@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump Get the hell out of the White House Trump Traitors.
@LindseyGrahamSC 😐 Good God man your not that damn stupid. But apparently you are that corrupt so I'll be really glad to see you go.
@IvankaTrump @VP Get the hell out of the White House you traitor.
@VP @POTUS @IvankaTrump Well I'm so glad your willing to work with the traitors family. That means you can be kicked out too, so please keep working with this corrupt, ugly family. Your a hypocrite and evil SOB.
@PressSec You are one miserable liar. You look like a fool. But keep doing what your doing because I will be able to tell my grandkids about how corrupt you all are &amp; you will be the reason why we changed our laws to prevent people like you from taking power again. Good riddance.
@realDonaldTrump You truly are an ugly, ugly human being inside and out. My disabled veteran husband lost 20% of this disabled services last month so don't you dare talk about this imagined prosperity. Your a liar and traitor. Go to hell.
@realDonaldTrump 😐 Really? Good grief. Your the art of the no deal master. Some one needs to get a whole lot of super glue to repair your fragile ego.
@Newsweek 🤣omg your such a loser Laura
@realDonaldTrump Sort of like all the crime your bringing to our country. Just shut up traitor.
@realDonaldTrump Oh you mean like this fake news. But I thought these people were you feel good team. Your such a liar. 	Watch: Fox News slams Trump's Putin performance https://t.co/2eAq5Nvj4o via @nbcnews
@thehill lol That was epic. 🤣
@LindseyGrahamSC That stupid slogan of 'Peace thru strength' sounds a lot like the dark ages idea of 'Might makes right'. Yes strength is a good idea but that doesn't mean being a bully and dictator. Two wrongs don't make a right. I thought you would know that.
@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I also want to say that the slogan of 'Peace thru strength' sounds like the dark ages idea of 'Might makes right'. Yes strength is a good idea but that doesn't mean being a bully and dictator. Two wrongs don't make a right. So you might not want to use that term in briefings.
@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Ok, hold on. I'm confused. Trump just now talked about reducing nuclear weapons by Russia, USA and others. I could have sworn he said (more than once) that he wanted a bunch of new, better, bigger and more powerful nukes? My bad I guess. You might want to clear that up one day.
@WhiteHouse I also want to say that the slogan of 'Peace thru strength' sounds a lot like the dark ages idea of 'Might makes right'. Yes strength is a good idea but that doesn't mean being a bully and dictator. Two wrongs don't make a right.

@RoyBlunt And this so called tax reform is a load of crap. You own that mess too.
@RoyBlunt You had better rebuke Trump tomorrow, if you don't I will count you as a traitor too &amp;/the nomination of Kavanaugh needs to be stopped Now! I'm done with this crap! Trump lost his right to nominate a new judge. You lost control of Trump so this is on your head. So You Own It!
@IvankaTrump The traitors daughter speaks. Get of the White House. Daddy dearest sold out our intelligence agencies so you don't have the right to say anything or stay in the White House.
@MastersShelby @dronepill @WhiteHouse @POTUS 🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump 🤣Oh stop it, your such a liar but I love watching all the nonsense you spew but now it's time for you to go. So bye bye crybaby. #TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@realDonaldTrump There was nothing productive about today, well except for maybe your pending impeachment. So thank you for that. 	#TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson lol Ya I won't be listening to Trump state tv anytime soon. What a joke. Get lost the lot of you. #TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@realDonaldTrump Well hopefully that will be remedied soon, because they won't be Your intelligence anymore because you'll be in jail. Have fun traitor.
@WhiteHouse No more Supreme Court picks for Trump. Period!
@POLITICOEurope 🤢
Why is no one talking about the fact that a reporter was forcefully removed by Russian officials, or at least I think they were with Putin? That is not okay. None of this is okay.
After seeing that horrible Trump/Putin meeting we must stop the nomination of Kavanaugh now! Trump is a traitor! He doesn't deserve the right to appoint a lawless judge who will side with Trump. 	#TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You're all spineless jellyfish. You are all Traitors! Burn in hell. How dare you take sides with Putin and believe him more than our own intelligence, for the whole world to see. My God you people are sick in the head. #TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@WhiteHouse 🤣 No is showed that Trump is a jellyfish. Claiming to believe Putin more than our own intelligence is treason as far as I'm concerned. #TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC Collusion doesn't matter at this point anymore. Trump declared that he believes Putin more than our own intelligence. That's Treason! Resign you jellyfish. Yes this can be fixed by getting Trump out!
@Jim_Jordan You need to stop pandering to Trump and stand up to him after that horrible Trump/Putin meeting. Your every bit as much of a traitor as Trump. Stop being a jellyfish or better yet, Resign. #TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@SenateMajLdr @Enquirer After seeing that horrible Trump/Putin meeting you must stop the nomination of Kavanaugh now! Trump is a traitor, and I refuse to accept you or Trump turning us into a Russian state. Resign if you refuse to stand up.
@realDonaldTrump #TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump	Should we be going out to buy Russian flags and Russian language software?
#TreasonSummit	#TreasonousTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC Duh!
@dabeard 😢
@mikiebarb lol, as if. Trump gets away with anything he wants. Do you honestly think there is a limit. lol that's funny.
I am absolutely livid. What the hell was that? Trump is totally selling us out. We might as well start buying Russian flags and buying Russian language software.
@LindseyGrahamSC No, sorry, I don't accept your indignation. You stood by the lame duck president all the way. You allowed him to run wild. You &amp; your party are to blame. So no, you don't have the right to act all upset now. If you refuse to act then Resign! Now!
@realDonaldTrump Lame duck.
@lorilatimer @mitchellreports 🤣
@WhiteHouse Traitors!
@RealSrDollar_ @B_ShitterNChief @PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 🤣
@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Traitor!
@realDonaldTrump lol no the media is not the enemy of the people, you are.
@realDonaldTrump Sure, if you say so.
@realDonaldTrump Crazy much? 🙄
@RepMarkMeadows If you go forward with impeachment against Rod Rosenstein then that in my eyes would count as obstruction, so don't do it.
@VP Shut up traitor.
@skmarkus @VP @POTUS No, no he doesn't.
@VP And how many were lost?
@VP Try again, nothing has changed for us or anyone we know. Just more lies.

@realDonaldTrump Cancel the Putin summit! If you don't then your a traitor. How are you going to spin &amp; lie about the new charges against 12 Russian military intelligence officials? Hmmmm! You can't say that Russia didn't interfere in the elections anymore. But I'm sure you already knew that.
@WhiteHouse I Don't Care. Cancel the Putin summit! If you don't then your a traitor. How are you going to spin &amp; lie about the new charges against 12 Russian military intelligence officials? You can't say that Russia didn't interfere in the elections. But I'm sure you already knew that.
@dadago18 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Of course it is. Russia didn't just screw with one side or the other, they attacked all of us. And Trump will not confront Putin in a meaningful manner, so he is either complicit or a accomplice, take your pick.
@ChrisCPandolfo Resign! Or you could just keep doing what your doing and maybe you will go to jail too for being a Putin/Trump puppet. Your a disgrace.
@RampantKam @TheBoodaCat2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS 🤣

@JMAngulo2 @lilyX68 @WhiteHouse 😂
@sherrybhenry @RoyBlunt Oh he has, he just doesn't care.
@IvankaTrump Traitor! Liar! Funny how all of your products are free from all tariffs, strange isn't it?
@DarrellIssa No. I don't think so. We need to get rid of people like you.
@Jim_Jordan No, I have to object. Your crap is what is frustrating us. So just be quiet. Why don't you just resign now.
@realDonaldTrump Oh you silly man, your such a liar. Your nothing but Puttin's puppet.
@jimsciutto @eliselabottcnn I'm not surprised one bit.
@realDonaldTrump Aww that's nice. Too bad they didn't bother showing up to a meeting today without so much as a call. You were stood up lol, ya your some deal maker.
@SenJoniErnst @IvankaTrump That may be true but you shouldn't be standing next to that traitor.
@seanhannity 🤢
@rebeccaballhaus This is just pathetic.
@PressSec @USAmbUK How many lies are you going to tell in the next 24 hours. You need to think about them a little bit better because that lame lie about Kelly being upset that he wasn't served a real breakfast was really pathetic.
@suzydymna @realDonaldTrump 🤣
@WhiteHouse 🤣
@Teri__2 @realDonaldTrump I saw that Russian TV clip. OMG it was awful, they pretty much confirmed on the air that Trump is doing better than they had hoped for, that he is doing Russia's work for them.
@loman920 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump 🤣 We resist because we have that right, this is America remember. If you don't like it you have the freedom to leave. We don't have to take Trump's 💩
@realDonaldTrump Lies, lies and more lies.
@realDonaldTrump Since you refuse to support NATO our government did it for you. So how does that feel? Knowing that while your away ruining everything the house and senate declared that the USA still supports NATO. That must just get under your skin. How priceless.
@realDonaldTrump You really don't understand how NATO works, do you. Either that or your just a bully. So how do you feel now that both the senate and house passed a declaration of their support of NATO, and behind your back more or less, lol priceless
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews 😐 🙄 Here we go again.
@realDonaldTrump Ya, but, but you said our borders were bad.
@SykesforSenate @SenateMajLdr 🤣🤣
@nobody_iz_h3ere @ColumbusNeon @WhiteHouse 😂
@WhiteHouse This should be fun. How will he screw this up?
@realDonaldTrump Dear World. I'm so sorry. Don't hate us forever for what Trump does. He does not speak for all of us.
@realDonaldTrump Shut up, you have no idea what your doing.
@realDonaldTrump It'd be sooooo easy for you to shut up.
@WhiteHouse 🤢
@EdKrassen Oh good grief, this jerk is a real class act.
@Amy_Siskind I can't understand how all this happened. I haven't paid enough attention to what our government is doing. But that is over, I'm never going to put my head back in the sand again.
@joshtpm 🤣 Crazy town.

@RickSmithShow @funder @TheDemCoalition Absolutely.
@SecNielsen @VP @ICEgov Ask him why disabled veterans are getting the shaft. My husband who is a disabled veteran had his disabled status reduced by 20%.  He first served in the Army then served in the Navy &amp; this administration just spit on him. Thanks for nothing Mr. President and VP. Your all losers.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw them in meetings with the Russians on the news last night. What the heck is going on? I'm so scared for our future.
@realDonaldTrump To bad you don't have that same loving regard for veterans. My husband who first served in the Army, then served in the Navy was disabled while serving &amp; your policies have taken 20% of his disabled status away. Thanks for nothing &amp; Happy 4th of July liar.
Here is a quick &amp; easy way to find contact info for your state officials. So email &amp; call to have your voice heard. I'm not supporting/objecting any specific policy, I just think it's time we all become more active in what our officials do, good or bad. https://t.co/Ip726ATadk

@SenateMajLdr Don't talk about working together when you held up a SC nominee. Your a liar and hypocrite. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
@realDonaldTrump Shut up liar, I don't want to hear anymore from you. Since you can into office my husband who is a disabled vet had his benefits go down 20%, our SW Missouri VA rep is MIA &amp; my husband has no doctor. So much for you EO for veterans choosing their own doctor. Lies! Lies! Lies!
@realDonaldTrump Shut up! Since you can into office my husband who is a disabled vet had his benefits go down 20%, our Missouri VA rep is MIA and my husband has no doctor. So much for you EO for veterans choosing their own doctor. Lies! Lies! Lies! Everyone is fleeing from your corruption.
@realDonaldTrump Too bad you don't support our veterans. Since you can into office my husband who is a disabled vet had his benefits go down 20%, our Missouri VA rep is MIA and my husband has no doctor. So much for you EO for veterans choosing their own doctor. Lies! Lies! Lies!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You better think again there, no confirmation on any new nomination until after the election. Oh but you won't like that will you. If you can't take it then don't dish it out Mitch. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry South Carolina.
@thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Yes he's such a genius that he's getting rid of veteran benefits. My husband who is a disabled veteran has no doctor and he got a letter confirming that he lost 20% of his disability check today. Thanks for nothing you gd lying sob. Happy 4th of July Mr. Bonespurs.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @KingAbdullahII @QueenRania 🤢
@realDonaldTrump This is just the beginning, more will either move overseas or go under. Thanks for nothing stupid.
@SauterRory @realDonaldTrump @henrymcmaster Oh really is that a fact. Do you like the military, do you support veterans, then you better not support Trump. My husband who is a disabled Vet has no doctor and he got a letter confirming that he lost 20% of his disability check today. Happy 4th of July Mr. Bonespurs.
@realDonaldTrump @henrymcmaster Gee, thanks for helping the Veterans so much. Not! My husband who is a disabled Vet has no doctor and he got a letter confirming that he lost 20% of his disability check today. Thanks for nothing you gd lying sob. Happy 4th of July Mr. Bonespurs.

@realDonaldTrump Bored now.
@SecAzar @FLOTUS So, you don't actually know anything at all do you. You have no plan, you have no idea how to reunite the children and parents. Your pathetic. This whole administration is useless or worse damaging. You guys don't give a crap about anything but $$$$
@FLOTUS @SecAzar @HHSGov What a wasted trip. Of course you had to go to an expensive church based center. You didn't accomplish anything at all. Go visit the military bases, the tent cities, go see the scared toddlers. Get real.
@melabroohaha @matthewneville @NoiseGateStudio @Sheep2Wolves @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Same here.
@realDonaldTrump If we show any weakness? You are nothing but weakness, your the embodiment of weakness. The best thing you can do is take your horrible family and move, far, far, away.
@realDonaldTrump Ya right, like I'm going to believe a lying sob like you.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS Tell Daddy Dearest to open the infant, girl &amp; boy detention centers to congress and reporters. What are you hiding? And if you won't get the hell out of the White House.
@SecNielsen Open the infant, girl &amp; boy detention centers to congress and reporters. What are you hiding? And if you won't resign.
@RealTruth_Anon @anbtruth @NRSC @factdc @clairecmc If Trump is so freaking wonderful then why did my husbands VA benefits go down 200 bucks this month. That's our new normal. So bite me.
@NRSC @factdc @clairecmc What about that loser Pruitt? Or any of the other Trump swamp monsters. And you can say Trump's not making money all you want but it's simply not true.
@indivisiblestl Go Mr. @MichaelAvenatti ! Your the man.
@WhiteHouse Open the infant, girl &amp; boy detention centers to congress and reporters. What are you hiding? And if you won't get the hell out of the White House!
@realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Open the infant, girl &amp; boy detention centers to congress and reporters. What are you hiding? And if you won't then get the hell out. Resign you hack!
@realDonaldTrump Ya, it's because you hate law and order that's why you don't want &amp; hate lawyers. You such a loser.
@realDonaldTrump The republicans need to get rid of you, it's killing them and us. You have no idea how government works. Get out!

@PastorDScott Don't bet on it.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yawn, bored now.
@IvankaTrump If your not going to stand up for children, and you have no plans on advising your Daddy then I want you to leave the White House, there is no place for you there.
@SecNielsen @HouseGOP @POTUS I don't think you will work to fix our system. You will work to do only what Trump wants you to do. I've seen you lie one to many times. You should resign now. Oh btw how did you like your Mexican dinner?
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Muh, ya whatever. Totally bored with your crap.
@maddow No apology needed. I totally understand. I keep going between rage and tears myself.
@USRepLong So apparently you enjoy rooting around in Trump's slop as much as you love clearing a buffet. Your a dirty pig and I will not lose one bit of sleep seeing you voted out. How dare you engage in Trump's hell on Earth, I hope you like hot weather because your going downstairs.
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse So how do you feel about babies being hidden away in 3 secret compounds in TX? Are you going to do anything? Oh ya sorry I forgot, you don't actually do anything at all, so why would you even care.
@IvankaTrump So are you proud of Daddy Dearest for hiding hundreds of babies all over the place. You once said "There's a special place in hell" Well guess what sweetie you and your horrible family are in that special place category now, congratulations.
@LindseyGrahamSC Resign.
@LindseyGrahamSC @DHSgov So who bought your soul? Will you be going to hell, I hear it's a dry heat so you should be ok down there.
@Jim_Jordan Just shut up already and go to the nearest mental disorder hospital.
@realDonaldTrump Oh sure you can. You have personal experience with rigging you own election. Can you think of it now?
@realDonaldTrump Wrong! Just more lies. How many lies are you going to say today? I'm going to start a tally sheet and tick out all your lies.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong! Just more BS lies. Your going to love your afterlife, I hope you like hot weather.
@realDonaldTrump Since you love showing off your stupid signature on EO's just write one up and end this policy of ripping kids away from parents. It's just that easy but oh no you have to be a bastard about everything. Change of subject there, F your stupid space force. Your such a idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Ooo gag, no thanks.
@LindseyGrahamSC Of course you don't. Just stay quiet and go along with the Trump plan to ruin America. Your a disgrace.
@WhiteHouse @SecNielsen More BS lies.
@SecPompeo LOL ya good luck with that one. No one wants to stand by our side anymore.
@SteveScalise You need to get a refund on your soul because yours is damaged. Just resign already.
@realDonaldTrump Children are being use by the Trump crime family, some of the most horrible criminals out there.
@realDonaldTrump Change the president!
@realDonaldTrump Shut up liar.
@LAKERFANKEVIN88 @micheruby @realDonaldTrump You better rethink that statement Kevin, because it's a lie as well. Too bad you can't tell the difference.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously? Space Force? Are you stupid or what. Or what is my guess. BTW you need to get a refund on your soul because yours is defective or just buy it back from Putin. Your such loser &amp; pond scum, go to hell for ripping families apart. You sick sob.
@SecNielsen You need to get a refund on your soul, because yours is defective. Resign! Now!
@WhiteHouse BS!
@realDonaldTrump BS! Just more lies.
@realDonaldTrump Shut up you monster.
@SecNielsen BS!
@realDonaldTrump Blah, blah, same ol, same ol. Get some new material.
@realDonaldTrump Sure, that's what it says in your mind. But the rest of us can read. And Comey did some pretty stupid things, no doubt. But think about this, they hurt Hillary, not you. But of course you have to play the poor little victim in all things. Baby.
@realDonaldTrump BS! Your party controls everything numbnuts. Your AG came right out &amp; put this in motion, did you of all people forget we have re-play? Would you like me to pull up the clip? all you do is lie, bitch &amp; moan. Give it up. We need more people to call you out for your crap.
@realDonaldTrump Be quiet liar.
@realDonaldTrump Just be quiet all ready. I'm tired of seeing all your lies.
@realDonaldTrump Have some cheese with that whine. The solution is very simple really. Don't commit crimes and you won't be sued or investigated. See how easy that is.
@VP @POTUS Shut up idiot. Your such a fraud.
@realDonaldTrump LOL oh stop. You create stupid issues and pretend to try and fix them. Your such an idiot.
@SykesforSenate Your the village idiot. Go sit in the corner like a good boy.
@SteveSchmidtSES And my husbands head spun around when he saw how sloppy the American flag was. It wasn't hung right, the field of blue was broken. For a president who harps so heavily about honoring our flag he sure doesn't care about how it is displayed. They don't care about much it seems.
@DevinNunes ROFL
@Jim_Jordan @IngrahamAngle @RepMarkMeadows ROFL no thanks, I'll pass.
@realDonaldTrump So what about the end of sanctions? That's an awesome thing you promised, or so N.K. thinks anyway.
@PressSec You need to turn around now and go back to N.K. They are airing that Trump promised them the end of sanctions. You guys are awesome. 🙄
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS So what do you think of N.K. saying Trump promised the end of sanctions? Hmmm. Tell me that, I'd like to know.

@EPAScottPruitt @kevinmillershow @POTUS Go jump in a polluted lake. There will be plenty to choose from.
@SykesforSenate Damn another freak of the week, now go home &amp; push your wife around. There is this thing in the constitution called separation of church and state and you don't want to follow that law so go jump in a lake. I'm sick of Christians thinking that only their religion matters.
@realDonaldTrump Oh hell no!
@realDonaldTrump Your spewing 🐎💩 again. Liar!
@realDonaldTrump Wow, your stupidity is astounding.
@realDonaldTrump ROFL dang stop it already, I'm laughing so hard my sides hurt. But I needed a good laugh though.
@realDonaldTrump Except for Missouri where you couldn't save the 800 Harley Davidson factory jobs they moved to Thailand and the 200 people they laid off. Great job idiot. You are totally useless. So go hide in your magical forest and hide from the 🐉that is after your 🇷🇺🧙‍♀️

@notavet @CostaStacia @PressSec @MamaRose2017 I love crazy people, they are so fun to watch.
@PressSec Well Trump wasn't able to convince Harley Davidson to stay in Missouri. We lost a plant that employed 800 people and they laid off 200 others. Ya we are doing great here. 🙄 And why are you posting a story by the "failing NY Times" ?
@realDonaldTrump Blah blah, bl bl blah blah. Your a damn broken record. Just drop it already.
@WHCommHopeHicks lol ya whatever.
@realDonaldTrump Yep, you just had to do it, throw in a Nazi reference. But I'll never say Heil Trump. You pig.

@DeepStateOnEPIX @EpixHD ROFL OMG how stupid. 🤣
@realDonaldTrump Really, for the 3rd time today, it's Memorial Day for God sake, shut up for once. If you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. This day is for honoring our fallen and not listening to your idle ramblings.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Ya, derail the trump train, take all the wreckage and the die hard followers and build a wall around it all to keep us safe, that works for me.
@realDonaldTrump I said it once already today but what the hell is wrong with you, it's Memorial Day of God sake. Just shut up for one day.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I love watching you lose your cool all the time, proof positive that your guilty.
@realDonaldTrump Good Grief your a pig. It's Memorial Day for God sake.
@realDonaldTrump BS Lies.
@realDonaldTrump Just heard your trying to get your useless military parade again. Your don't need another ego boost, I'm all for the military but a parade is a waste of time &amp; money, get your priorities straight. Showing off all our equipment is like saying "Here it is study hard adversaries"
@realDonaldTrump Your heaping way too much praise on NK which means your lying through your teeth. The only person you truly praise is yourself.
@realDonaldTrump You crazy old liar.
@tedlieu @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump I don't recognize America anymore. This is just so scary.

@realDonaldTrump I am so sick of your sh*t. If your so gd unhappy resign!
@realDonaldTrump This would be funny if it wasn't so serious. Your a gd mental case. You have no idea what your talking about.
@realDonaldTrump No, no, no. The only spies are the ones in your head.
@realDonaldTrump OMG your such a worthless liar. You have totally lost your mind.
@realDonaldTrump You have absorbed and ingested too much gold in your lifetime, you have heavy metal poisoning or something that's why your so stark raving mad. Curse that damn gold leaf laced chocolate cake.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Hey numbskull there is no such thing as the deep state, just deep stupidity of those who believe it.
@JTMYVA @realDonaldTrump Ya I have to agree, it's going down in flames.
@PressSec @TheSlyStallone Oh Snap! You told another lie again today about the security briefing. Why do you even bother anymore. Do yourself and just leave, please.
@realDonaldTrump Oh for God sake, your still going on about this. What a damn baby. Looky, Looky everyone, I'm pretending to care (hehehehe dummies).
@realDonaldTrump It's for the best anyway. You would only screw things up even more than they are now. 🐓💩🤡
@JTMYVA @realDonaldTrump I think your getting confused there, I think you meant to say Mr. Art Of The No Deal.
@realDonaldTrump Stop it with your baby names for things, only an immature man would name every event his your life, I guess it makes you feel special, hahaha, loser. I don't believe a gd thing you say.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Art of the no deal. You couldn't deal your way out of a paper bag. Why would anyone trust you after you make a commitment then break it,  oh ya except for the woman you marry. The rest of the world knows better.
@realDonaldTrump You are the worst thing to ever happen to our country. Just get out of the White House you monster.
@madasednam @FoxNews @POTUS @SenateDems @SenateGOP He plans on selling these stupid things anyway. This is so dumb!

@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump And what really makes me mad is one of Trump's first actions was to do away with a lot of the mental health regulations, it's just a free for all now. Gee thanks a lot Trump! What a stupid, little man.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Oh good, I can't wait to hear you melt down again, that's so entertaining. Just let yourself go and blab all you want.

@realDonaldTrump Of course it'll be worse than Watergate because you made it worse. But that's ok keep tweeting away moron.
@DHSgov @SecNielsen @FBI @ODNIgov GTHO now! Your a disgrace.
@realDonaldTrump Oh for God sake shut up. Informants &amp; spies are different things, but I wouldn't expect you to know that. Even not knowing the difference the only reason your doing this is to blow more smoke &amp; guess what, I don't believe a damn thing you say. Your a habitual liar, gtfo!
@BetsyDeVosED GTFO! Now.

@LoneWolf1006 @brandon_r_horan @PressSec @POTUS @SecPompeo @HillaryClinton ok, that came out of left field. Your going on and on about something that wasn't even commented on, ROFL.
@PressSec @POTUS @SecPompeo You seem to dodge most questions or you don't know anything, then why even have a daily briefing? I'd rather have no briefing than to have you lie, dodge or show your ignorance. Please just stop it.
@VP @CIA @POTUS @SecPompeo Right, when pigs fly. So do you have your pig wings yet Pence?
@realDonaldTrump @AsaHutchinson Loser. If you all love our veterans then do something for them instead of stabbing them in the back. You're all a bunch of scumbags! Go to hell.

@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump I want to see documents too. Like your pink slip. Your a swamp monster that needs to become an endangered species.
@mutt1960 @BillBuckley12 @KausODB @pfsKat @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Sorry, ever hear of separation of powers. Maybe you should refresh your memory.
@realDonaldTrump You are completely mental. Get help for god sake. Maybe a rubber room is in order.
@realDonaldTrump No, sorry that would be you. You are a total disgrace and your embarrassing the USA at every turn. GTFO!

@realDonaldTrump Sure that's why you want to jail your political enemies, the press, citizens who don't agree with you. Did I leave anyone out?
@tommydaniel55 @Dicktrikle1 @OutlawYacht @CelebratingHim @NickOliva73 @realDonaldTrump LOL oh that's rich. Just resort to name calling right off the bat because that works so well. I hate to burst your little bubble but I'm a democrat and I didn't want Hillary for president, so you need to rewire your brain Tommy boy.
@l0w_tier_God @WilDonnelly @realDonaldTrump Sorry, but one person is already serving 30 days in prison. Please play again someday.

@disneydebbie13 @ACJJustice @realDonaldTrump Wow, you are one confused woman and blind as a bat. I sort of feel sorry for you, sort of. Maybe some meds would help you more, or a nice white room. If you back Trump still then you are not a real Christian so stop preaching like one. I've been down that road
@EricGreitens Wow, you &amp; Trump sure do like to talk alot &amp; claim how great you are. 🙄Give me a break. I want you out of office, your so corrupt &amp; dirty I can smell you from here. Get lost.
@realDonaldTrump Hmm I think you've already posted this before, you're one giant re-run.
@realDonaldTrump Idiot!
@funder Of course he is, he lives to golf. But don't dare distract him with a Mueller interview or more briefings on what not to do in North Korea because he has way too much on his plate for that crap. He's such a 🐓💩
@SecPompeo @FoxNewsSunday @POTUS No, but your going to make a whole new set of mistakes and leave it the USA's State TV to spread the lies.
@realDonaldTrump LOL omg you are totally crazy. Another promise broken. Your such a loser and a 🤡 and a 🐓💩
@realDonaldTrump Sorry you can't be trusted to tell the truth, I'll look up this information myself and see if I can find anything. But you, no sorry, I'll never believe you; ever.
@realDonaldTrump Good grief, they are dismantling a sight that can't be used anymore. Your so easy to fool, or you already know this and your just lying again.

@realDonaldTrump How many times are you going to tweet about this?
@realDonaldTrump Fake President, so bad! Sad!
@realDonaldTrump ROFL oh ok, if you say so. I must have been watching a different hearing.
@realDonaldTrump Well, what do you expect, they cover a fake president. So what are you so po'd about, it's not like the National Enquirer is "real" so stop bitching. If you act like a decent person the news wouldn't be reporting every little bad thing you do.
@realDonaldTrump I see your mentality never grew past that of a 3rd grader, only small minded people name call and threaten people and groups. Just stop it please.
@funder We can only hope.
@planetzalex @WhiteHouse Sure, sure. Like anyone would listen to someone screaming online, and I'm not, I just wanted to point out that this makes you look like an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Your a gd idiot. This is the biggest mistake you've done thusfar and we will be paying for it for a long time. You have no idea what your doing, your corrupt to the core. Just get the hell out of the White House.
@realDonaldTrump Worst President ever! Your such a scumbag, go ahead and burn everything to the ground but you won't like what comes after. No country will trust us after this. And what is the matter you today, you sound stoned out of your mind.

@YeahILoveTrump @realDonaldTrump lol Its impossible when we have people like you who think they are better than any one else.

@realDonaldTrump Oh God this is so funny. The more you yell the more you look guilty. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck, and you sir look like a lame duck.🦆 but you act more like a 🐓 or maybe even a 🦃we should throw you in the ocean so a 🦈can get you
@GIAMIKKO @GrouchoG @DevinNunes Oh dear God, you can't be that naive, wth.
@EricGreitens My husband is a vet &amp; he needs surgery but we have to go to Arkansas to have it done if you really want to help get more options here but I know you wont. I hear you have a RO against the AG that tells me all I need to know about you, if you act guilty you probably are. Resign
@realDonaldTrump You don't know great people.
@realDonaldTrump You say that about everyone, obstruction, obstruction, obstruction. Well you would know.
@realDonaldTrump Not on your life. Mike doesn't have the temperament to head up the state dept., just keep him in his current position.
@johannaihli @thehill I guess you didn't even read the article.
@thehill I remember nursing homes being so horrible when I was a kid, I thought those days were behind us. So sad.
@MrWolverineMan @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo Yes, by refusing to see the value and power he gave up by getting out of the TPP, great job. And he's already setting  the stage for leaving in the middle of the N. Korean summit. Great job again.
@Delyla100 @realDonaldTrump And does absolutely nothing except looking for places to hide.
@realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo @JPN_PMO @WhiteHouse @StateDept Oh that's nice, an advertisement for your gaudy, overrated properties. I bet you were in too much of a self induced stupor to notice that PM Abe was annoyed at times and laughing at you at others. LOL good thing your so clueless.

@realDonaldTrump Waaa Waaa Waaa You must be rolling around on the floor, pounding your fist on the ground, crying like a itty bitty baby. Do you need your security blanket?
@realDonaldTrump Oh no, no, no With the way your acting I don't want you anywhere near Kim Jong Un, because your to immature &amp; Bolton will talk you into shoot first ask questions later. And why is Pompeo talking with Kim Jong Un, he isn't in the state dept yet.
@realDonaldTrump Your Soooo childish. But you are right, people are not happy, we do want security &amp; safety, which means you have to go.
@MariePolder @_sweetmissy_ @realDonaldTrump O Angela, your so cute and clueless.
@realDonaldTrump You don't like anything you stupid little man. Opps no, I have to take that back, you like Russia.
@realDonaldTrump Oh so you admit that your a spy. OMG what do I do? I finally believe something you said. Damn!
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up already!
@EricGreitens You don't get it do you, we are sick of self righteous fools who think they are God's gift to women &amp; we're tired of politicians who can't do their jobs right because you're all fighting scandals. Times up! Now get the hell out.

@ttlaurent @mobilematt @FoxNews @KatiePavlich @IngrahamAngle @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @ShepNewsTeam @realDonaldTrump ROFL oh this is too funny
@thehill LOL ya, I don't thinks so. I wouldn't trust the GOP to buy toilet paper.
@realDonaldTrump Sure they are, just like all your fake facts.
@realDonaldTrump Right.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, give us all a break and resign.
@realDonaldTrump Why do you lie with every breath you take. Slime ball.
@RoyBlunt Goodbye Blunt. Be careful who you back, after we get rid of Greitens you may be next. It's so easy for you to spout off at the mouth while people like me worry about family and friends abroad, your a lousy leader, and bad for Missouri.
@SenRonJohnson Sure, whatever you say. 🤪🤡
@realDonaldTrump Your such a disaster &amp; all you do is Lie, Lie, Lie. Your totally controlled by Russia, you are Russia. All you do is collude with enemies. 🤪🤡
@realDonaldTrump You have no idea what your doing. You threw away our leverage when you tore up the TTP. Duh! Your so damn stupid it's not even funny. Get lost! 🤡💩
@IvankaTrump @MartinVizcarraC @the_IDB What the hell do you think your doing? Just stop it, go away, you don't speak for me or anyone I know so go home &amp; curl up in the corner like a good little pet.
@EricGreitens The tide is turning &amp; it will wash you away. Your not doing yourself any favors by acting like this, your not acting like an innocent man, the more you fume the worse it gets, you can see how will this is working for Trump LOL. Good riddance to bad rubbish. Resign!
@morwent112 @EricGreitens ... If he's innocent why didn't he cooperate &amp; turn over documents &amp; show up for interviews, not the actions of an innocent man if you ask me.
@morwent112 @EricGreitens I know, right. I don't know why people turn a completely blind eye this. I don't go to church anymore because this, I was berated, &amp; told the only value I had was to be a walking sex doll &amp; I don't believe a single word Greitens has to say...
@ASealsDen @EricGreitens WTH. Are you on drugs?
@EricGreitens GTHO! Resign! Someone needs to take you out to the woodshed. You hit and abuse a woman then someone needs to hit and abuse you. And don't think for a second that you parroting Trump's "Witch Hunt" will work for you because it won't, your just another lying SOB.
@GovGreitensMO GTHO! Resign creep. Someone needs to take you out to the woodshed. You hit and abuse a woman then someone needs to hit and abuse you. And don't think for a second that you parroting Trump's "Witch Hunt" will work for you because it won't, your just another lying SOB.

@SykesforSenate Bite me creep.
@realDonaldTrump And why are you not sending condolences for that poor man who died and what about your well wishes for the 4 firefighters that were hurt? And why is this the second fire in your (well built building) this year?
@realDonaldTrump Someone died you dumb jackass. Your building isn't well built at all, you know there's this thing called sprinklers which you don't have on that floor. No wonder you want all regulations dismantled so you can't be held accountable for anything. I can't wait to see you go down.
@StephenMilIer Well that's better than not having one at all.
@realDonaldTrump ROFL oh stop it already, I can't stand it. Your such a f'ing joke.
@RepSwalwell I don't think we have that much time, Trump will burn America to the ground by then.

@realDonaldTrump Keep crying little Donny. That's all you are good at. This just shows how very weak you really are. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump ROFL 🤣🤣Damn stop it already, this is just to funny.
@realDonaldTrump And China is going to hurt our state in a big way, &amp; in deep red Trump territory but you don't care about that. We are going to be hit hard in the soy bean and corn tariffs, you are such an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Well with you taking control we have a lot to lose, and lose big time. We are losing so much that I'm tired of losing.
@realDonaldTrump You forgot to blame Nessy, the closet monster, &amp; the aliens-but not the ones crossing the border, have you checked in on Area 51 lately? Maybe you can force those aliens with their cool alien tech to build your wall. Just a thought. 🤡🤪
@GeorgieCheva5 @cathyob1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ROFL back off? Why? It's so entertaining watching you stomp your feet &amp; throw a hissy fit every time someone challenges a Trump policy. You are showing your ignorance &amp; intolerance by acting like a baby. Do you need a binky &amp; security blanket?
@realDonaldTrump Blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada. You need a yak-back, you are nothing but a broken record.
@realDonaldTrump No, what's disgraceful is you haven't nominated people &amp; the other people you do have just flat out quit &amp; then you blaming democrats for it all. Your so incredibly weak it's not even funny.

@morningmika Ugg, I'm not surprised. Trump &amp; his clan are so classy. I wonder if they share tips with Fifty Shades of Greitens, I'm so ashamed of my state &amp; our governor @EricGreitens and his S&amp;M games. What the hell is going on in our country? This is totally out of hand.
@EricGreitens Your not doing jack for my husband who is a disabled vet, he doesn't have a primary care doctor! He routinely has to travel to Arkansas for treatment. So what are you going to do about that? Oh ya I forgot your too busy playing S&amp;M games &amp; robbing VA charities. Classy.

@realDonaldTrump Right, and I'm going to believe you why? I didn't think so. You have zero credibility. Face the facts your losing on every front.
@realDonaldTrump I just started seeing news articles about what you said in Missouri. You are totally unhinged! Never Ever come back to Missouri you messed up psycho, you will go down as the dumbest president ever. Ya just keep insulting N &amp; S Korea&amp; see what it gets you Stupid, Stupid idiot!

@realDonaldTrump What bs, our lives are absolutely not better! Nothing has changed, oh crap I forgot something has changed, my husbands VA disability yearly cost of living raise was less than ever before, gee Thanks Jared for nothing. But you keep supporting losers because that really does help
@Troup1998 @OfficeOfMike @realDonaldTrump ROFL OMG make it stop, my sides hurt from laughing so hard, Dude. You seem to be your own problem. Nothing at all has changed for us or for my friends and family, I don't know what world your living in but I can go there sometime. 🤣🤣🤡🤡

@MAGA__Chuck @HeatYoWilli @zwash300 @LoveOurPotus @realDonaldTrump Rude much?
@realDonaldTrump You obviously haven't heard about the 2 teachers that shot their weapons in school, 1 in Georgia &amp; 1 in California. Great idea you have there. BTW I hear your coming to Missouri, here's a tip for you, Don't Come! But then again everyone you support loses so that could be a plus.
@realDonaldTrump @Cabinet @SenateCommerce And how many times have you tried an infrastructure week? This will be a bust just like the other times you've tried. You don't know how to work with anyone to get stuff done. Sad.
@realDonaldTrump Another dumb ass wave of comments. What are you trying to distract from today? Ooo could it be because the candidate you backed lost. I see a pattern here.
@realDonaldTrump Well I see 3 problems here, 1) nominate someone 2) pick decent and qualified people 3) start treating congressmen with respect. But obviously you don't know any good people and you lack any human emotions except hate and pettiness. But nice distraction though.
@PeterAlexander I'm so inspired by these young people. Stay strong! I support you 100%
@realDonaldTrump I love our military, I have many family members that have served but you Trump are a idiot and I can't wait for you to be gone, your nothing but a vile, evil sob.

@thehill This man seems sick &amp; needs serious help &amp; I'm not trying to be to mean here, I'm worried. He tries to divide this country, acting like a dictator &amp; incites anger &amp; violence. And I don't understand why, what am I missing? (1 of 2)
@realDonaldTrump @Saccone4PA18 You are a sick sob, all you can do is lie, cheat &amp; divide this country as well as incite anger &amp; violence. And when did protesting &amp; freedom of speech become illegal? It hasn't! So stop trying to shut people up &amp; acting like a dictator you idiot.

@MAGAPILL @realDonaldTrump No, he's not. His house of cards is falling. I feel sorry for you, your so blind.
@MAGAPILL @realDonaldTrump Oh well guess what! He's not doing a God damn thing for our veterans. My husband is a disabled vet and has no VA doctor, his disability claims are being denied. So get informed before you spew nonsense!
@EricGreitens I have 3 things to say, resign, resign, resign. Do you understand, or do I need to spell it out for you, r-e-s-i-g-n! We don't need a lying, scummy 'fifty shades of grey' governor.
@realDonaldTrump What Good News! Did you resign?
@realDonaldTrump Poor wittle baby Trump is all upset. No credible news group is bowing down and kissing the kings shoes. I wouldn't want to get near Trump either, with all the shit he steps in and all the hookers he has around. You'd get vd by osmosis.

@RoyBlunt I have a question, since you and the other republicans are hand scribbling notes on the tax bill, will you write in a special deduction for my family? If you can't do that then I hope you go down along side Trump. Maybe you can flip the bill for Trumps special wall and you...
