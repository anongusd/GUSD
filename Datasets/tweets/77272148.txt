@alliatedsims I see gamers with stories to tell. As gamers, we are a #Community; strangers brought together through love for a game. 		The challenges/creativity allowed through CAS &amp; BuildMode has spawned careers for some gamers.  Their passion for the game reflects my passion. Inspires me.

@No1RealWolfy @ewarren He strikes me as a very wise and canny politician. His personal biases may play a role, but good politicians listen to their base, do polls, and seek compromise with the majority.
@beckyfs22 @ewarren Remember, Swing states of Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania? They threw the electoral college to Trump, not small GOP controlled states. 		Even my St of WA is insignificant by comparison. 		Vote Blue anyway, even if you kinda dislike the Democratic candidate. Ur vote's a statistic.
RT @beckyfs22: @ewarren The Electoral College is skewed to low population red states, so yeah, we’re skittish. We live under  minority rule
@larryelder You are clearly ignorant of US History concerning the conscious targeting of blacks after slavery. 150 years of Jim Crow: you and I still can't call target groups racist as they have never once enjoyed the freedom to thrive without harassment that we enjoy. call you MRDOMINANT
@No1RealWolfy @ewarren You may see a slight change in future. Remember, our elected officials do know their bases. The way to lose to an opponent in next election is to indicate you have ignored, abandoned your voters' expectations.		This is politics. It just is that way, sadly. In Democracies...

@prof_smartass @ewarren Hillary won the popular vote. She had a damn good platform. She had been Sec. of State and knows exactly what this country needed for '17-21.		Trump's election becomes less and less valid by the day because of guilty pleas and mounting evidence of corruption and fraud.
@awri125 @ewarren Maybe with money that was previously allocated to build a wall but sat in a vault for two years because of all the lawsuits drawn up in court.
I add support for cultural normalization with  lgbtq and poc. Meaning, Democrats come together from all walks of life and white America assimilates into their culture like whites forced them to do for centuries.		I am actually 100%for that. The future of the USA is a Brown USA. https://t.co/b2SXwFNOOy
@atheist_in_nc @ewarren The result of Trump's "change" has proven to turn our nation on its head. 		I seriously think we need a return to reason first and foremost. Get Democrats into majority in both houses and the White House and we will begin to see some progressive structural change.
@No1RealWolfy @ewarren If he follows suit with other Democrats in majority of votes. He is worth re-electing.
@jkamarketinginc @ewarren @funder @duty2warn This is useful, Thank You!
@InteractiveMary @ewarren It is, but Trump's being investigated and by definition of our laws is presumed innocent until proven guilty.		Or we see that one piece of dirt that breaks Trump's pillar and brings his whole regime crashing down.		Barring that happening, let's focus on vetting a candidate to win
@AtmaTheWanderer @Heath_C_Walker @ewarren @Mikel_Jollett Who do you think those Russian bots were targeting in '16? Not solid, vote,blue old ladies like me, that's for sure.

@SchleifAirs @ewarren I think the top brass in the DNC learned a thing or two from the last election. Democrat lobbyists aren't stupid. They will appeal to voters of "also rans" this time and, hopefully, get those voters back. 		There is some evidence the BernieOrBusters own some of the blame u know.
@robe_joe @ewarren bullshit. This is USA, a Republic with an elected governing body whose highest ranks are chosen BY THE PEOPLE. Fighting to fucking win an election IS doing the right thing. It's called Democracy.

@SolumNicole @ewarren Not a bad critique of the Tweet, but it's early. Meat and potatoes time for Candidates' Presidential Game Plan starts with the DNC Convention.: When we have vetted all and the DNC selects our sole candidate. Then we have a solid platform to support.
@chrisw_ottawa @ewarren I am feeling the same. Donate small now to those you feel confidence in and hold off on the bigger donation for after our sole Democratic candidate is selected. It's what I am doing. I give up a latte a week by doing the small. 		And not to every person who claims to be running.

@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I'll still respect you on Wednesday morning if you voted differently than I. 		Let's take back our country, progressives, liberals, moderates, and disgruntled conservatives. #LetsGetBackIntoTheWH2020 #DemocraticPartyUSA		#Vote2020		You don't need to respect me, or agree. #VoteDem
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I will not vote for the independent candidate or the Republican candidate as a protest because my preferred candidate lost to 'that schmuck-bitch-mother-fucker-whatever'.		I want my country back. 		I believe most Democrats feel the same.		So, Vote.	Your choice.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I WILL vote for the Democratic Candidate for President of the United States of America. No matter if he or she is my preference at the start. 		I will not dig in my heels, call the DNC a dictatorship or autocracy. 		I will not fail to vote if I am at all able to do so in 2020.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight … President Obama was someone I can trust implicitly. 		The DNC is our ally in politics. I am more liberal in some areas than the Democrats. I am more conservative in other regards. But I have learned to trust the wisdom of the DNC in political matter. 		So, I for one vow:
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight Still, I voted for Obama. I feel love for Obama today equal to the enmity I feel for Trump. 		One wise beyond his years (imo) and really, really relatable, humble enough, and overall, except for some hard executive decisions concerning our armed forces and international policy...
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize.		Not a bad candidate or president after all. Certainly not "green on the scene." 		Was there some angst before I went to the polls because MY Candidate had not been selected by powerful lobbyists in the Democratic Party? 		Yes.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I voted for Obama despite thinking he was a bit green on the scene as a freshman US Senator. He was a bit young...		But the DNC chose Obama.		So I chose to vote for Obama. Our Democratic Candidate in '08. 		He won the Nobel Peace Prize in his first year in office.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight Trump		The hopeful news is we have a lot of smart, sharp politicians throwing their hats in the ring. 		I ask ALL DEMOCRATS: 		Whoever is our candidate selected by the DNC:		Support them and GET OUT THE VOTE in '20! 		I wasn't sure Obama would be effective, but I voted for him.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight We are living the consequence of division and overarching pride. We accuse lobbies of unilateral acts of autocracy. We don't consider the consequences of turning our backs on our allies because we disagree about an issue or candidate. 	The price is:
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I just keep thinking about that old song by Claude Denjean: "United We Stand"		"For united we stand. Divided we fall	And if our backs should ever be against the wall	We'll be together, Together, you and I" 		This should be the anthem for all Democrats in the upcoming election.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight Seeing that data... The price we now pay as a party because of a perception that supporting the DNC choice for president stepped on some of our toes, or that parties are dictatorial autocracies. 		As I said. People get angry when their preference is not selected.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I don't know how to do a thread...		Anyroad: 		The DNC is not a dictatorship. No one is outcast for disagreeing and voting for an alternate candidate or voting YES when they recommend we vote NO. 		Other Democrats did get angry. I feel angry😞 that Democrats split votes in '16.
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight They are citizens like you and me who run polls, vet candidates, recommend candidates, and which issues we should support or oppose via letters and at the polls. They have not legal jurisdiction over our personal opinions or expression. Not even over our vote.		Need 2 thread this
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight I lost this thread. searching...
@VegasBatman @yashar Yes. The more time I spend here reading and chatting with folks, the more I learn. It does suck to get called out by someone, but as in our case, we are both gaining something (or so I hope). 		The DNC is an arm of the Democratic Party. They don't rule, but they do research a lot
@VegasBatman @ThisWeekABC @FiveThirtyEight No. The State is the overarching government of a nation or state as in State of New York; "foreign state" or "nation state" 		The Democratic National Committee is not a state nor a governing body. It is the lobbying arm of the Democratic Party.		A lobby is an interest group

No Clinton has ever been "absolute state authority"		Bill was Senator &amp; President of a Republic.	Hillary was Secretary of State &amp; Senator of a Republic.

I cannot speak on economics for lack of training in that area. All the best to you. TY! https://t.co/ISz2CuKcdr
Sadly, this is not actually true.  Statistically, blacks and POC are scrutinized far more than whites by law enforcement and non-poc citizens who live nearby. 		Ghettos exist for a reason. They are not havens for minority groups: They are containment from Middle American whites. https://t.co/QSshfwI2Gb

I am planning on starting a playthrough with all my characters in one game. It will be interesting to see how #JoeyJones interacts with #LegacySarah.
I see what may be a park on the SW side.		A possible (fingers crossed) get-to-work destination and exploration zone to the N.		At least one open residential lot E.

@alliatedsims @TheSimCommunity Yes: I love that the developers built freedom to play your way in much of #TheSims4. I tend to be story-driven so each family has "opt in" or "out" choices.		I have multiple saves because of this and segregate my story arcs. I don't play multiple families on the same saved game.
@Jazzywendt21 Thx for the follow back! Sadly, I don't have a Sims-only ID, so some of my tweets are not game specific. I wax political here as well... I won't be offended if you stop following because of that.
@alliatedsims @TheSimCommunity I both loved and hated #TheSims2 abductions. Sometimes they threw a big snaffoo into my pre-planned, perfect-life goals for my fave sim. 		In Sims4 we have #Simpregnation already and it can be avoided. (something I like) 		Still, I'd love to see a bit of that "danger" in Sims4.

After all, we already have great aliens in the Sims4. It looks like a total war zone with military. Strangetown, definitely.
@lusyneczka @TheSimCommunity #Sim2 is my favorite as well. I still play it on my PC and am grateful to the developers and Origin for giving that game to us lifelong simmers who bought virtually everything S2.
@KoffeeKatts @Emanyuerusan @TheSimCommunity I am totally psyched for this. Been waiting 11 years to play #Strangetown (Sims2) analog in #TheSims4.
@LeeJayXOX @TheSimCommunity There's not much to be negative about this gamepack. I am totally psyched to play in this hood!  I think some gamers don't remember or never played #Sims1 or #Sims2. #StrangerVille is a very promising game pack and I know I WILL play it.

@alliatedsims @TheSimCommunity We have aliens in the #Sims4. Create your alien family there. I think I will definitely try for a #PollinationTech9Smith analog. I would love to see #Curious and #Grunt fams as well.

@StormyDayzGamez @_ladysparrow Yes. My sim vampire fishes at night... I can switch out and have care-giver work with sim-toddlers. Honestly, I seriously consider taking all older Sims along and having baby default to "X has been sent to daycare."		It is the only way to keep babies at least "Fine'.
@StormyDayzGamez If that's been done to add a freakin' job challenge for our #GetToWork Sims, it's really viscious. My sim kids are all affected and always end up with "EmotionalControl" in the red.  		Good Lord, I bet--The devs did that to us on purpose--!!! #deviousSimGurus
@StormyDayzGamez Yeah, so I found out. I mean Baby doesn't need to be totally green all the time but to ever see a baby's or toddler's background constantly red until my working Sim gets home and intervenes is ridiculous.		I'm stuck choosing whether or not to neglect a Sim child to do work tasks.
@StormyDayzGamez Very true. I am currently playing a police Lt.

A great addition to the commercial lots we already have. With the ability to freely place home and commercial lots adjacent to one another, imagine the simming we could do!  I really miss the more open worlds from Sims 2 with placeable lots. https://t.co/wrAqiMqDOZ

I was pleasantly pleased with #Aquaman. The special effects and graphics are stunning. The story waswonderfully respectful of it's DC comics origins. Casting was particularly good what with Dolph Lundgen and Nichole Kidman and very HOT Jason Mamoa as Arthur. https://t.co/bpX3L6wKOe
@Forbes To this, I say "Bullshit!" Best special effects seen this year!  Good story that gets panned because it ends happy (Almost).  Forbes, you are wrong about this. Comics/sci-fi fans greatly liked #Aquaman movie.

Are we Americans via Trump and Russians via pal, Putin, about to become the aggressors in a war "to end all wars"? 		Fascists against Communists? It feels like a prelude to nuclear Armageddon.		If this occurs, may God have mercy on us all.   		Weigh in. Correct me, enlighten me.
Are USA and Russia preparing us for systemic isolation of China, and her illegitimate child, N. Korea? 		Are two super-powers setting up the untenable pincer attack on the most populous country on Earth? 		I have read propaganda from Nazis and other aggressors in History classes.
4/ Now, Republicans and Trump are saying China interfered in our election with cyber attacks against GOP. 		So, enlighten me, people. Who is lying? Trump with his 5,000+ "incorrect" declarations of fact? 		I'm just a silly elder, but I can still spell a rat.
3/ Many recent comments reflect concerns by Democrats, legal analysts and journalists, who are calling out and investigating Russia/GOP collusion and meddling in our 2016 Presidential Election in USA.
2/ China is systematically being called out, punished and isolated by USA policy  through tariffs and accusations (true or not). 		China is being associated with Democrats and was recently accused of aiding Clinton via cyber attacks during 2016 election.
Might be a bit paranoid, so help me learn some facts and History here: 		What I see is a USA and a Russia running as allies in a coup. 		The country surrounded east and west by these two super-powers who have "crawled into bed" with one another is China. 1/

@LeslieAnnKutz @tabornK @jennycohn1 Exactly. I love our WA mail-in system.  No stress. Easy to take my time reading about candidates/issues and doing some online double-check then marking the box while sitting in my fave chair.

RT @lisecodde: @jennycohn1 Also be very careful about the postage due on it.  Our CA ballots often require more than one stamp.
@ultralite001 @jennycohn1 I'm a Washington voter and this is purely misleading information. 		I LOVE our mail-in ballots. No personal info but return address is in mailer envelopes. 		Think 'bout it. What is cooler than voting on your couch and taking all the time you need, so long as you meet post date?
@travelberry2014 @HoulsbyMark @ultralite001 @jennycohn1 Exactly. There is something fishy in Ms. Cohn's entire thread because of this misinformation. Who is this person?
@4AnimalLife @HoulsbyMark @travelberry2014 @ultralite001 @jennycohn1 The fact that this poster failed to mention that our mail-in ballots for WA are a double packet with signature and personal info on an inner envelope---	It suggests either lack of clarity or suggestion that mail-ins ballots are bad.		But what's cooler than voting at home? Luv it

@sims_tonysims @EnsingBrandon @SimGuruKate All true. But we have businesses to work in and free travel to all worlds.
