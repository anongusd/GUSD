@love2laugh4ever @RepJayapal @BettyMcCollum04 @RepPeterDeFazio @RoKhanna @RepTimRyan @EleanorNorton @repblumenauer @RepMarkTakano @janschakowsky @RepBonamici @TulsiGabbard Our pref is publicly financed elections and/or limits on how much candidates can spend in races (based on size of constituency served). But there are lots of good options that are currently off the table until we pass the amendment cuz SCOTUS has/would declare unconstitutional.
@love2laugh4ever @RepJayapal @BettyMcCollum04 @RepPeterDeFazio @RoKhanna @RepTimRyan @EleanorNorton @repblumenauer @RepMarkTakano @janschakowsky @RepBonamici @TulsiGabbard The amendment is meant to just make clear that the Supreme Court may not rule campaign finance legislation unconstitutional -- the specifics need to come from legislation at federal, state and local levels. That kind of specificity isn't appropriate for an amendment. :)

@love2laugh4ever @RepJayapal @BettyMcCollum04 @RepPeterDeFazio @RoKhanna @RepTimRyan @EleanorNorton @repblumenauer @RepMarkTakano @janschakowsky @RepBonamici @TulsiGabbard The amendment is clear that constitutional rights are for human beings -- citizenship or documentation is another matter entirely. We were intentional about not saying "citizens" for example because not all human beings are citizens.
@love2laugh4ever @RepJayapal @BettyMcCollum04 @RepPeterDeFazio @RoKhanna @RepTimRyan @EleanorNorton @repblumenauer @RepMarkTakano @janschakowsky @RepBonamici @TulsiGabbard No, a "natural person" is a term in the law that means human being as opposed to an "artificial person" created by law like a corporation, nonprofit, PAC, union, etc. There is also a push to recognize nature as a "natural person" as well but that's a developing movement.

@CitizenMichael1 @Thom_Hartmann In our view, corporations weren't mentioned in the constitution and don't deserve constitutional rights. They simply aren't people with inalienable rights.

@CitizenMichael1 @Thom_Hartmann Based on our discussions with him, he knows the history and problematic nature of corporate personhood but is hesitant to commit to a systemic solution like a 28th Amendment to end constitutional rights for corporations.

And, for the very first time ever, we have a verbal agreement from a SENATOR that they will introduce the We the People Amendment to the Senate floor in 2019! This is HUGE! @SenateDems @SenateGOP
2018 is almost over but we are so confident that with you as our partners, we will get even more co-sponsors in 2019 that we raised our goal even higher: 75 co-sponsors in the House!
This past year saw a continuation of our ‚Äúgoal shattering‚Äù pace in the House for a second year in a row -- our goal was 45 co-sponsors when we started the year and we made gains so fast we had to up our goal to 60. Then we surpassed that, making it to 66 cosponsors!
You made so many things happen for @MoveToAmend  this year! Your support helped democracy move forward and Move to Amend get closer to our goal of ending corporate rule. THANK YOU! Here's a thread of some updates on our progress! #GetMoneyOut #MoveToAmend #EndCorporateRule

Happy #LaborDay from your brothers and sisters in the democracy movement! https://t.co/QBXmtvuW1L
Share your food, your stories, your struggles and your solidarity. Stay connected. Explore ways to connect afterwards.		If you have questions or would like assistance, please ask us and have a great #LaborDay
If the event is a picnic, find out if it‚Äôs a potluck or if you just bring your own food 	Either way, show up and sit with people you don‚Äôt know. Wear your Move to Amend pin. Have Move to Amend petitions (but be respectful and only circulate if it seems right).
If required and you're unable to have them printed in a union shop, simply have a few copies of one or both flyers taped to your table for reference when people walk by. Or if you print them yourself at home you can add "print labor donated" to the bottom.
It's important to note that some union members are insistent about a union "bug" (i.e. logo indicating that it was produced by a union printer) appearing on any distributed material. If passing out either of the above handouts, check first with the event organizer
If you‚Äôre able to reserve a table, post a sign and have Move to Amend petitions and materials. Go here to download the handout titled, ‚ÄúExpand Human and Worker Rights by Abolishing Corporate Constitutional Rights.‚Äù
Ask if @MoveToAmend can be represented. Candidates running for office will be out in full force. Print out copies of the Pledge to Amend form. Ask candidates to fill them out on the spot.
If the event is a festival, request to speak (if relevant) and to have a table	Some festivals will have speakers talking about threats to working people and the campaigns unions are involved in to expand justice.
‚àö If the event is a parade, try to join	Put together a ‚Äúfloat‚Äù (e.g. fancy vehicle with Move to Amend signs on either side). Have Move to Amenders follow behind with other signs. Other supporters can work the crowd for signatures on the Motion to Amend petition.
‚àö The most common #LaborDay events are parades, festivals (with or without speakers) and picnics		The event is often a parade followed by a festival or a picnic.
‚àö  Not all labor unions are members of the @AFLCIO	The United Auto Workers (@UAW) and @Teamsters aren‚Äôt generally members of local AFL-CIO labor federations. They may be organizing their own Labor Day events, so consider contacting these and other unions separately.
‚àö Find out what is going on in your community	Contact the @AFLCIO (a federation or coalition of labor unions) closest to you. This might be in your city or adjacent city or county. Find out what, if anything, is planned.
Here's a few ways to Build Solidarity with Unions this #LaborDay...
Since Move to Amend is also organizing a powerful movement to create real change -- our constitutional amendment to abolish corporate rights and money considered free speech -- connecting with labor unions and the working people they represent makes perfect strategic sense.
Many fundamental rights and protections of working people (e.g. the weekend, 8-hour work day, collective bargaining, end of child labor, employer-based health coverage, workplace safety) came into being because working people organized powerful movements to make it happen

Brett Kavanaugh's record is so incredibly anti-women, anti-consumer, and anti-accountability that if confirmed by the Senate, Trump and his corporate crony friends will have made this Supreme Court one of the most radically undemocratic Courts in this nation's history.

Thank you @RepLowenthal!		Is your Representative a #WeThePeopleAmendment Champion? Let them know they need to get on board: https://t.co/sxJHiTGXMP		What about your Senator? Tell them to join the movement! https://t.co/wCfA4w85ak https://t.co/zRcJogLJim
Please also email your Senators and tell them that opposition to corporate personhood must be a litmus test for Brett Kavanaugh or any nominee to the Supreme Court. Send them our Questionnaire to use in confirmation hearings. https://t.co/gEyi7GjJ0F
The most important action you can take today is to call your Senators and ensure they know that Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation would set the United States back to colonial times. https://t.co/fmdMDo1L9Q
We vehemently oppose Kavanaugh's nomination. It's time to take action -- the hearings begin next week! Here are some easy ways you can get involved:
Privacy will remain a thing of the past, as Kavanaugh supports mass government surveillance, and opposes a woman's right to choose.
86% of Americans support Net Neutrality, yet he has consistently sided with cable companies, spelling disaster for #NetNeutrality.
Investigating and prosecuting a sitting president would greatly undermine the federal government according to Kavanaugh. In his US, the President and the Supreme Court are apparently above the law.
He believes corporate constitutional rights are valid and concurs with the #HobbyLobby and #CitizensUnited decisions.
There are many reasons to be concerned about #Kavanaugh, considering his record and his own statements, but this man is Trump's puppet not a fair arbiter of the Constitution. Here's a thread on how our fight for democracy just got more real:

So what if @realDonaldTrump released his tax returns? Yeah it'd give a clearer view of his corruption but we already know he's corrupt! The real source of corruption is that corporations can give unlimited amounts of dark money because it's their "First Amendment" as a "person"
Requiring candidates to disclose their tax returns is a good idea of course but it's honestly a useless gesture as long as corporations have more rights than people!
