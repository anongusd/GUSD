#SecDef Mattis concludes that we have to work together with our allies. #MattisUSIP
War is one tragedy piled on top of another, says #SecDef Mattis. #MattisUSIP
But it's also going to take an informed electorate. We have freedom of speech in this country, so it's not all up to the military, says #SecDef Mattis. #MattisUSIP
The number one priority right now of U.S. Cyber Command is maintaining the security of our election, says #SecDef Mattis. "It's an all-hands-on-deck effort," he says. #MattisUSIP https://t.co/1pSy5lpPJC
On the INF treaty: Russia has now stood-up multiple units that are armed with a weapon that is clearly in violation of the INF treaty, says #SecDef Mattis. "We have done everything we can diplomatically... The diplomats are still trying as we speak." #MattisUSIP
The war in Yemen has got to end, says #SecDef Mattis. "We've got to replace combat with compromise... It's time to stop this." #MattisUSIP
It's a waste for the Iranian people to be involved in Syria, and to try to turn Iraq into a rump state of Tehran. It's not going to work, says #SecDef Mattis. #MattisUSIP
We're calling on Russia to support the Geneva Process on Syria... it's eventually in Russia's best interest to not keep Syria the cauldron it is now, says #SecDef Mattis. #MattisUSIP
I think eventually Syria's Assad will have to be managed out of power... I don't think any election held under his regime could be credible, says #SecDef Mattis. #MattisUSIP https://t.co/1pSy5lpPJC
Amb. Khalilzad is "a force of nature," says #SecDef Mattis, and he's been "a welcome addition to the team." "Reconciliation is our goal," says Mattis. #MattisUSIP
When I presented this Afghanistan strategy to the president, he challenged every assumption... We had a very robust discussion in every way, says #SecDef Mattis. #MattisUSIP
#SecDef Mattis describes the new 4R+S strategy for Afghanistan: 		Regionalize the approach;		Reinforce with more troops;		Realign those troops to work closely with the Afghan security forces; 		Reconciliation.		Then Sustain the strategy. #MattisUSIP
To defeat terrorists, we have to give people hope. And that can't be unilateral, says #SecDef Mattis. It has to be multilateral, and the military has to support @StateDept diplomatic efforts, he says. #MattisUSIP https://t.co/1pSy5lpPJC

Today's most powerful threat is Russia, says #SecDef Mattis. The most urgent threats are terrorism and North Korea. And the threat with the most will is China, he says. #MattisUSIP
When we assessed today's threats for the National Defense Strategy, we looked at power, urgency, and will. We're in a competition of sorts to maintain this world, and turn it over, hopefully, in better condition than we received it, says #SecDef Mattis. https://t.co/1pSy5lpPJC

A sustained commitment to a long-term strategy of strengthening governance in fragile states will be needed to help our partners foster societies that can resist violent extremism.
8. A preventive strategy cannot succeed without strong U.S. leadership and sustained commitment. Even as our partners shoulder their share of the burden, U.S. leadership will be critical to mobilize collective action toward a common goal.
7. However, the U.S. cannot execute a preventive strategy on its own. The U.S. needs to more effectively share the costs of a prevention strategy with willing international partners, including our allies, international organizations, and the private sector.
...The U.S. should catalyze investments where our partners are working nationally and locally to address the conditions that fuel extremism.
6. A preventive strategy is a cost-effective and sustainable way to keep America safe. Preventive measures cost far less than military interventions‚Äîsaving $16 for every $1 invested....
...contribute to the problem. Going forward, the priority for U.S. policy should be to help fragile states build resilience against the spread of violent extremism within their own societies.
5. The time has come for a new U.S. strategy to alleviate the conditions that enable extremism. Fragile states are incubators of extremism: the sense of injustice &amp; political exclusion of their citizens, spread of extremist ideology &amp; presence of extremist groups all...
...where resentment against poor or predatory governance is exploited by extremist ideas and groups.
4. Extremism cannot be curbed through force alone. Extremist groups have drawn us into an expanding fight against terrorism. The U.S. has spent $5.6T on military efforts to combat terrorism since 9/11, yet, new generations of terrorists continue to emerge in fragile states...
3. America's rivals are exploiting disorder to expand their influence. Russia, China, and Iran are preying on fragile states, often in ways that contribute to extremism. America cannot compete effectively against strategic rivals as long as extremism and fragility persist.
Extremist groups are increasingly focused on exploiting fragile states' weaknesses to seize and rule territory to establish a new political order.
2. We face a challenging strategic environment today. The states of the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel have become increasingly fragile; their governments lack legitimacy, struggling or failing to provide security, justice, and basic services.
Extremist groups have spread to 19 of the 45 countries that make up the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel, sowing chaos and undermining already fragile states. https://t.co/u94EQ5sJtL

Thank you to everyone who watched our panel today! And a special thanks to our partners, @IRIglobal and @SFCG_ #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
One of the issues facing us is rooted in a fixation that one's own view is the best, says His Holiness @Karmapa17 #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
It's useless to talk about interfaith peacebuilding without including the women and the youth, says Cardinal John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
Rev.@SusieOHayward: We need to be careful that our interfaith peacebuilding doesn't reinforce discrimination in unintended ways, particularly in gender inequality. #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
Our #IRFMinisterial panel is accepting questions from the audience on interfaith peacebuilding. Watch their answers here:	https://t.co/FdkS6FMYEL
If you have freedom of religion, women clergy can defend their agency without risk of retaliation, says Rev @SusieOHayward #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
"Our work isn't so much as Hindus, it's as human beings," says @SadhviBhagawati of her approach to interfaith peacebuilding. #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
@SadhviBhagawati: Local leaders, not central governments, often end up with a lot more control over people. And religion frequently gets co-opted for the leader's own motivations that have nothing to do with how people pray. #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
Our panel on Interfaith Peacebuilding is happening right now! Watch the conversation here:	https://t.co/FdkS6FMYEL
Cardinal John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan: If religious communities cannot live in harmony, it is impossible for interfaith work to build peace in society at large. #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
I see interfaith peacebuilding doing a lot of work on the social side, between people, and not a lot of work being done between governments and citizens-- and that is a place to improve, says Rev. @SusieOHayward #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
Interfaith peacebuilding can be a tool for both religious freedom and peaceful religious coexistence, and those two must be cultivated together, says @SusieOHayward #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
His Holiness @Karmapa17: Religious freedom is an innate right, and religious leaders must understand that religion should be something that comes from within rather than imposed. #IRFSummit #IRFMinisterial
The practical implementation of religious freedom remains a challenge. Many times, there is tension even within families about religious beliefs, says His Holiness @Karmapa17 #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
The work of interfaith gives a human face to the "other," says @SadhviBhagawati. We can deprive others of their rights only when we dehumanize them, and interfaith work prevents that from happening. #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
There is a difference between what the law says about religious freedom and the reality of religious freedom in Nigeria, according Cardinal John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
"I just have to find a way to live in peace with my brothers," says Cardinal John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan on being a Catholic archbishop in Nigeria. #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
"Despite all appearances to the contrary, in light of how far I've traveled across this world, I believe humanity is making progress." says Cardinal John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan #IRFMinisterial #IRFSummit
.@MikeJobbins from @SFCG_ opens up our second panel on Interfaith Peacebuilding by saying that everyone should "believe that you can find hope in the most challenging places." Watch the conversation here:	https://t.co/FdkS6FMYEL

"As soon as you stop talking about terminology and start talking about the nature and substance of the response, people are on the same page" in regard to countering violent extremism, says Oliver Wilcox of @StateDeptCT #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Youth in the Arab world are looking for a narrative of pluralism and an inclusive society, says @fdaoulb #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Our panel is answering questions on how religious engagement can help counter violent extremism. #IRFministerial #IRFsummit 	Watch the conversation here:	https://t.co/FdkS6FMYEL
.@fdaoulb says a young man explained to him how ISIS appeals to youth: they show the action first, then out-of-context scripture that justifies the action. #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Good security practices will uphold the whole spectrum of human rights, says Humera Khan of @muflehun #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Oliver Wilcox of @StateDeptCT: Understanding what appeals to youth is a challenge for religious leaders and countering extremism. #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Even within the same community, what may drive one individual to become radicalized may be different than what drives another, says Oliver Wilcox from @StateDeptCT #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Humera Khan, president of @muflehun: Many people believe that religion is a catalyst behind violent extremism-- but research says religion can be a protective institution; preventing people from seeking a sense of identity from extremist groups. #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Rev. @fdaoulb speaks of "inclusive citizenship," where we are not just equal to one another, but part of a unique community. #IRFministerial #IRFsummit 		Watch the conversation here:	https://t.co/FdkS6FMYEL
How religious leaders can present a wise narrative that stifles extremist influence is a challenge for creating religious freedom, says Sheikh bin Bayyah of @ppeaceims #IRFministerial #IRFsummit
Sheikh bin Bayyah, president of @ppeaceims: In the Marrakesh Declaration, we attempted to sever the rope that extremists hold onto; the rope that says Islam is antagonistic to religious pluralism. #IRFministerial #IRFsummit

We need to stay focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, says @SenJoniErnst, who says that she rarely hears mentions of them from her constituents today. #ErnstIraqUSIP
Iran wants the U.S. out of Iraq. And that's a problem, because U.S. and Iranian interests do not align in Iraq, says @SenJoniErnst. "Iran is not our friend," she says. #ErnstIraqUSIP

The U.S. has the ability to exert enormous influence for democracy and to raise global standards of living, and we should use that together with our allies, says @USRepKeating. #BipartisanUSIP
Russia supports authoritarian regimes because they are easier to corrupt and use to enrich Russia's oligarchs, says @USRepKeating. #BipartisanUSIP https://t.co/vNGvkVw8C3
Russia has certainly exploited the migration issue in Europe, says @RepRooney. We need to expose that, and support the countries that want to solve it in a humane way, he says. #BipartisanUSIP
Destabilized countries like Venezuela, and potentially Nicaragua and Mexico, are petri dishes for Russian influence, says @RepRooney. #BipartisanUSIP
We need to counter Russia militarily, but should also look at where we get the most return on investment and effectiveness, says @USRepKeating, like investment in the @StateDept and soft power. #BipartisanUSIP
We need to get better at connecting with the Russian people themselves, who may not agree with what Putin is doing, says @USRepKeating. #BipartisanUSIP
Traditionally, we've been effective at countering Russian narratives abroad through @VOANews and @RFERL, and we can do more of that today, says @RepRooney. #BipartisanUSIP
We also need the help of private companies, like social media companies, to counter Russian influence, says @USRepKeating. Congress will do what it can, but we also need their help, and we don't want to hurt American firms, he says. #BipartisanUSIP

Treaty: A formal and mutually binding written agreement between two or more states or other political authorities.

Cease-fire: A suspension of armed conflict agreed to by both sides.
