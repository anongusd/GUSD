@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Worst thing ever was labeling climate change as global warming. It allows for ignorance too easily for those who don’t want to be educated.

@SpeakerPelosi should host the #SOTU at 9:00 AM EST, during normal business hours.  That would allow @POTUS to fulfill his obligation without requiring furloughed employees to work that evening.
If the @GOP wants to help bring this country back together and narrow the chasm that exists between the left and the right, they should not allow @realDonaldTrump be the defacto candidate in 2020, but rather run a primary and let the party decide if he is still the best choice.
