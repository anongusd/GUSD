Earned income credit and dependant credit can be placed on a w4 even now, and that can be rolled forward in company benefits make poor rich
People need to be empowered everywhere to be able to earn and buy more through smarter policies without costing employment. Or tax revenues
So many people in poverty live paycheck to paycheck. Spending every dime. There must be a way government can help create multiple income.
Also, every account arrangements should have rollover from a child's birth to adult. I hope poor and middle class can benefit from this.
Conduits are flexible accounts that are deducted before taxes and used for basic living costs. It gives more leverage, but should have cap.
When employees are able to deduct 60% of their income in benefits, they get more earnings, buying power, for some can be conduits.
What if every employee can deduct up to 60% of their income in employee sponsored benefits? And an education savings account 4 current need?

Homeless people are a huge target of violence. Housing and work education must be a priority.
With a vat tax on the consumer end right before retail,it adds 1.2 trillion to the government revenue.adds to education and basic services
Usually poor people spend every dime of their money, when people earn and keep more it's usually spent. This adds to consumer confidence.
Reducing business taxes can increase their profits and capital formation, allowing wages and benefits to be raised transitioning to spend
You can increase revenue by allowing business to keep more profit, by reducing corporate taxes,and increasing the amount taxpayers can earn
I know the government cannot send checks to everyone that wants one, but you can educate and rehab the poor to work while balancing budgets
I know some politicians are trying to gut entitlements, but when you cut lifelines from people it can create a crisis, must be a better way
