At the Dallas Democratic Forum today w/ special guest former Congressman Martin Frost
The bills I passed during session will go into effect today. HB 123, HB 351, HB 2615, HB 3270 http://t.co/Mmd6UZE #txlege
Filed suit as Plaintiff today in Congressional redistricting. Hope for Justice
R's axe my effort to make insurers pay for damaged child seats. Why must parents pay for a broken seat thatwas someone else's fault? #txlege
Pres. Obama just threw the Hook Em Horns!!
Repubs have 101 members in the TX House-enough for a quorum w/o Dems And they still cant get enough members to conduct the people's business
Started debate on Redistricting over 8 hrs ago & its clear R's plan to trample rights of black and Latino voters & ignore Voting Rights Act
I voted against republican cuts to public ed, nursing homes, & other vital  services today, but HB 1 passed. This is a sad day for our state
RT @startelegram: Texas House passes resolution recognizing 'horrific' racial massacre of 1910 http://bit.ly/fGiPPt #txlege
HR 865 passed House today acknowledging Slocum Massacre of 1910. You can read about it here: http://bit.ly/ie7Qw1
Just like the 1950's, this is a regrettable day for decisions made in the Texas Legislature #TXphotoID
After a long day of fighting R's voter suppression bill, it passed 101-48 and is unfortunately one step closer to becoming a terrible TX law
R's sent SB 14 back out of comm, with fiscal note still included. Hello R's, we still face a $27 bill. deficit. #therealemergency #TXphotoID
Check out this article about HR 665 which I authored to honor grandparents raising grandchildren http://bit.ly/es62z4
Point of order sustained. The bill will come back soon as R's push to suppress legal voters #TXphotoID
If GOP learned to prioritize, we could move on to important business like saving teachers' jobs instead of legalizing discrimination
Right now the House is debating the Republican voter disenfranchisement bill which will deny hardworking Texans the right to vote #txphotoid
It's AKA/Links Day at the Capitol.Thank you for all you do in the community! http://twitpic.com/44s18m
