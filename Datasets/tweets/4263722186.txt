"We have done things in a very bipartisan manner." @Mark4AZ has sent a strong message in his first term, starting with office hires, that he cares only about what the law requires - not whether or not an attorney or a victim is a Republican or Democrat. #AZAG #azright
.@Mark4AZ is extremely frustrated that Congress won't do its job when it comes to immigration enforcement and border security. Immigration mostly a federal issue, but he will defend and enforce state law when applicable. #AZAG #azright
.@Mark4AZ is a big believer in federalism, thus the reason why he has joined national efforts to stop federal overreach from hurting Arizonans. #AZAG #azright
Good question from @mpolletta on @Mark4AZ's second term priorities. Consumer protection leads the list from the #AZAG. Prosecuting cyber crimes and protecting data privacy also on his radar for years 5-8. #azright
.@Mark4AZ bemoans the current radioactive culture we find ourselves in where political opponents seek to destroy each other's name and character to win a debate. Didn't used to be this way. He's always wanted to have a debate on ideas. #AZAG #azright
The #AZAG office is required by law to review and approve language for ballot measure descriptions. Under @Mark4AZ's leadership, his office airs on the side of giving Arizona voters as much information as they can. #azright
.@Mark4AZ's been able to build a track record of success at the #azleg because he's been willing to work across the aisle and he's gained credibility for his consistency. #AZAG #azright
"To keep that consistency of the rule of law, you have to defend the laws as they are, and let the policymakers make changes to the laws if they choose." @Mark4AZ #AZAG #azright
.@Mark4AZ says hes been willing to take on tough fights and always ready to defend the law and the will of Arizona voters. Important to have that consistency from an Attorney General. #azright
On why @Mark4AZ thinks he deserves a second term as #AZAG: he was raised with a mentality to give back. Desires to protect Arizonans. Has 3+ years of doing just that. #azright

Great debate from @Mark4AZ tonight. He showed Arizonans again why he is the only choice at the ballot box for #AZAG. Arizona is better off with him as our state's top cop. #azright
.@Mark4AZ and the #AZAG office have worked overtime to keep Arizonans safe. They have earned the trust of their constituents for being consistent with their defense of the rule of law. #FourMoreYears
"You have to defend a law until the highest court in the state - or the U.S. Supreme Court - says it is unconstitutional....even if you don't like the policy, you have to defend/enforce it to keep the consistency." @Mark4AZ during tonight's #AZAG debate. #azright
.@Mark4AZ is winning this #AZAG debate at the halfway point - and it's not even close. Few better than him to make winning arguments on substance and facts. #azright
I agree with @Mark4AZ: having a California billionaire coming in to try to buy the #AZAG race is not funny. And Arizonans won't think it's funny either, which is why the Brno will sail to another victory in November. #azright

@DebbieLesko The @freedomcaucus will be gaining a great ally when @DebbieLesko becomes the next #AZ08 Representative.
@DebbieLesko 2. @DebbieLesko proved herself adept at raising a significant amount of money in a short amount of time. 3. She is well liked by her constituents, in large part, because she spends time with them and gets things done for them. #AZ08
How @DebbieLesko positioned herself for Tuesday's #AZ08 primary victory is a textbook example for future Congressional aspirants. 1. She campaigned hard for every election cycle in LD 21 - mailers, autodials, signs, etc - even with a safe seat.
