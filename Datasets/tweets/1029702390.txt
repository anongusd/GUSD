@FHeavy1998 @realDailyWire @jimbo_slice1135 Nuanced distinction, but healthcare is different than insurance.

@guypbenson I really don't think a public Mueller report (if we ever get one) is necessary at this point to impeach Trump. He's been unfit since day one when he refused to separate himself from his business and the campaign finance, obstruction, fraud, &amp; emoluments cases are strong as-is.

@wanderhomenow @PKfromCentralPA @J_BDahn @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv Last year had an over $6B increase over 2017 and Trump has accomplished what with that money? Exactly. Why does he need another $5.7B when he just got a $6.3B increase for DHS?		https://t.co/nEhTGaH9qf

@wanderhomenow @J_BDahn @PKfromCentralPA @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv Also worth mentioning, Obama ever nominated a judge deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association. Trump has nominated 6 judges deemed not qualified including 3 unanimous decisions.
@wanderhomenow @J_BDahn @PKfromCentralPA @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv Except Reid only did that as McConnell refused to move forward with ANY Obama judicial nominees no matter how qualified they were &amp; the Supreme Court was exempt because Reid knew how important it was to have greater consensus w/ SC nominees as there's no higher court to appeal to
@RevFisk @AOC Plus... Trump is on record saying he'd own the shutdown, he wouldn't blame democrats, he'd take the mantle. I mean, how much more obvious can it be?		So again, because of your really bad awareness, critical thinking, and analysis, it's best that you don't write books or preach.
@RevFisk @AOC I'd argue that the party who doesn't allow the other to hold the government hostage as some kind of bargaining chip is blameless. You don't buy the spoiled brat who's throwing a tantrum a toy unless you want more tantrums.
@Just_Some_Bot Clean DREAM Act would 100% pass tomorrow. It's the kind of no vote that costs someone their seat. Huge majority of republicans want permanent protections for dreamers. As for DACA itself, the courts currently disagree and SC does not intend to hear case.		https://t.co/xfSml0HSaC

@Just_Some_Bot @J_BDahn @PKfromCentralPA @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv No, that's not right. It's about not allowing Trump to singlehandedly (with a late assist from McConnell) hold gov't hostage for the ransom of an unpopular partisan policy goal. The gov't's continued operation should never be bargaining chip &amp; giving in ensures it'll happen again
@Just_Some_Bot You can't even say dems "won" the shutdown. It's more that Trump, McConnell, and senate republicans performed a sensational self-own for absolutely no reason. And Trump already appears to have learned nothing as he's already primed to do it all AGAIN in 3 weeks.
@Just_Some_Bot McConnell says it's cuz he won't introduce a bill Trump won't sign, except congress had veto proof majorities willing to pass the pre-shutdown bill from Dec. He finally introduces two bills this week, republicans refuse to re-open gov't. Trump caves, senate passes same Dec bill.
@Just_Some_Bot There was a deal. Unanimous in senate, house had the votes, but Ryan refused to introduce it; instead decided to offer up freedom caucus fever dream as a fuck you out the door. Dems take the house, pass same bill as senate, McConnell won't reintroduce previous bill, or ANY bill.
@Just_Some_Bot @J_BDahn @PKfromCentralPA @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv That's an insane line of thought. Because they want the shutdown to end, they should vote for any bill that ends it, no matter what's in it? Imagine the rules were reversed. Should republicans be expected to vote for a carbon tax or Medicare for all in order to reopen gov't?

@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv There's A LOT of water on earth üåé!
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv 1,174,891,996,306,285.8		That's a rough estimate of how many gallons of water it would take to make inferences about all of the water in all the oceans. Which seems like a lot (definitely more than a glass), but it's actually only 0.0003273% of the water on earth.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Anyways, sorry if I was snippy at first. Twitter doesn't bring out the best in people sometimes, but I do love statistics and appreciate that you were willing to talk üôÇ
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Which is why a lot of places (538 and RealClear Politics come to mind) will do polling averages and polls of polls in order to (ideally) improve the accuracy. Though a poll is still just a point in time snapshot that will change over time, sometimes drastically.
@denise_kandra @J_BDahn @PKfromCentralPA @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv You're wrong. He got a watered down 5th iteration of the travel ban that did not closely resemble the original. Just like he'll get a 5th iteration watered down version of border security.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Because principles of statistics are unchanging, it's possible for polling companies to know how many people need to respond to reach particular degree of certainty (confidence interval) and accuracy (margin of error), which is why many national polls stop after ‚âà 1k people
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Exactly! An educated guess is exactly what we're going for. It's impossible to be exact because there's no way to sample all 350M people. And the level of accuracy is something that can be statistically proven, though polls are only shooting for "close enough" usually ¬±3-5%
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv I know it seems that way, but mathematically it's not. Not if you're dealing with a normal distribution (which we are) and a sample is truly random (which no poll can truly be, but they do their best).
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Though there is debate about the "randomness" because right from the start you're limited to the types of people who answer their phone and are willing to participate.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Correct, for a national poll, it's a random sample of people nationwide.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv The confidence interval is how sure a scientist is and the margin of error is how accurate they want to be. For example, if you want to be 99% accurate and within 1% margin of error, you now need a random sample to be 16,640 people for a population of 350 million.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv The confidence interval and margin of error do not make the whole. You can for example have a confidence interval of 95% and a margin of error of 10%. Since the margin of error is so big, you'd only need 96 random people to make an inference about 350 million.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv In the ocean example, you'd be looking at a population of millions of trillions of gallons of water. In order to make estimates about the oceans as a whole, you'd need a lot more than a glass (though it'd still be less than one might think).
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv The 3% is the acceptable margin of error that will fall between the high end and the low end of the 95% confidence interval.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv 95% confidence interval means that you're 95% sure of something. In statistics, that means the true value value would need to be over ¬±1.96 full standard deviations from the mean to reject the poll's hypothesis.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv I'm dead serious. You can look it up. Either do the calculations yourself or use one of the hundred or so online calculators that will do the work for you.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv It's simple math. Though you're right, I was rounding off. It actually takes a 1,067 person random sample to make inferences about 350 million people with a 95% confidence interval and 3% margin of error.
@snackpack210 @the_frugal_jew @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv You justify it with math... like I said to begin with, inferential statistics are solid science. All you have to do is look at the numbers.
@jbowser74 @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Pollsters were all well within margin of error. Just because polls from August had Hillary winning by a landslide doesn't mean the polls were wrong for an election held in November. Polls are a point in time snapshot only.
@jbowser74 @IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Then look again when the question includes that current cost of healthcare *already* exceeds the estimated costs of Medicare for all. All of a sudden it's popular again.
@JonahNRO Except the swamp does exist, which is why the message was both popular and effective during the 2016 campaign trail. It's just that Trump was a populist charlatan who went on to assemble the swampiest cabinet in history and AOC seems to actually give a shit even after an election
@PKfromCentralPA @J_BDahn @JoshuaMD84 @williamlegate @JoeDMillard @KyleKashuv In what universe? Border crossings are at generational lows and only crisis at the border has been the unnecessarily cruel family separation policy. If you can wait for over two years and make no progress on the wall with unified control of government, there ain't an emergency.
@IIII_RC_IIII @KyleKashuv Polls are incredibly accurate. Inferential statistics is sound science and a random sampling of just 1,000 people is enough to extrapolate data about 350,000,000 people with a 95% confidence interval and 3% margin of error.

@AcidRayneStorm @missmalevolent @pichkamaterina @MrAndyNgo @benshapiro The SHERIFF says that his tip solved it. He only said it was a white dude because the VICTIMS said it was a white dude on account of seeing a white guy speeding off at the time of the shooting. Turns out it was probably someone else scared and fleeing the shooter.

@pichkamaterina @MrAndyNgo @benshapiro Confirmed by Harris County sheriff himself.		"He became a target in our investigation based on a tip that initially went to journalist and activist Shaun King," [sheriff Ed] Gonzalez told reporters. "Mr. King then passed that tip to me personally."
@MrAndyNgo @benshapiro It's now being widely reported that a tip forwarded to police by Shaun King was what led to the real suspect being arrested.
@brandybyerley @deray @SymoneDSanders Except the sketch was based off of eyewitness testimony and it was actually notable SJW Shaun King's forwarded tip that led to the right person being arrested.

@Utahopia @guypbenson Considering the amount of deductions, a 100% marginal tax rate that ends up being taxed at an effective rate of 45% is fine. If you can't live off of $4.5M per year, you have bigger problems than the tax code.
@guypbenson Also, 70% would be the marginal rate. So...
@guypbenson I think that when you're taking about $10M, saying someone "earned" that money belies what it takes to reach that figure. Usually you barely scratch the surface to find the exploitation and manipulation that kind of avarice requires and there should be a high price to pay for it.

Hell, give them the $46B and resurrect the 2013 immigration bill. Now that immigration reform would be a win for Trump and not Obama, the house should be willing to do it.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP It'd be great if as a country we funded the government on something other than a month to month basis.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP Patayto patahto. A voice vote where no one says nay is in the books as 100-0.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP I agree. Though it's entirely predictable when republicans tie major new funding bills to a democratic political nonstarters like defunding planned parenthood or gutting ACA. And it goes both ways, hence the embarrassing and increasing prevalence of continuing resolutions.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @SenSchumer That it's a tough sell to blame Schumer when you need 60 votes and can't even get the 51 republicans on board. Someone tell John Cornyn he's still the majority whip for a little while longer.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @SenSchumer McConnell couldn't even get the Republicans on board. Didn't even get 50 votes.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP Also, still no point to your rant about the filibuster for a CR that passed 100-0.
@dreamwriter9 @RepMarkMeadows @senatemajldr @SenateGOP That is a big reason why I hate huge thousand+ page monstrosity omnibus bills that always carry some kind of bait intentionally that can be used in an attack ad during the next election cycle.

@jeroendstout @_ph1bs_ @danagoulet @Ocasio2018 We're making huge progress there though. Less people live in poverty now than at any point in human history -- in large part thanks to capitalism and globalism (though obvious glaring problems exist... I'm looking at you climate change).
@jeroendstout @_ph1bs_ @danagoulet @Ocasio2018 Because it's an evolutionary trait? We're meant to never be satisfied for long, which is pretty helpful for survival. Even when you provide for everyone, there will still be struggle and suffering. I have exclusively first worlds problems and manufacturer plenty of struggles.
@_ph1bs_ @jeroendstout @danagoulet @Ocasio2018 Obviously their lives could be improved, otherwise they wouldn't need to be using those programs. I'm glad we have programs that help those people and I believe we can improve them. However, no amount of welfare investment can eliminate struggle and suffering.
@_ph1bs_ @jeroendstout @danagoulet @Ocasio2018 Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, CHIP, WIC, cash assistance, food assistance, SSID, section 8 housing assistance, workers compensation, unemployment, and this is just off the cuff, I'm no expert in public assistance, but I know there are dozens if not hundreds of programs.

@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump We really do. It's unfortunate that Trump can't consistently deliver it and even if he could, his past divisiveness strains credibility that he does so sincerely.
@mlwestie77 @MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Maybe. I bet the vote ratio flips among the two parties though. You'd have 50-some or more GOP voting against and just a small handful of democrats who still believe it doesn't do nearly enough.
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The reason Medicare 4 all seems to be the rallying cry is because of how well it's implemented. Huge subscriber group means huge buying power &amp; leverage to negotiate price. Set prices means less admin costs on provider side &amp; insurance side, meaning cheaper for everybody.
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump And the ACA was a hybrid based off of the market-based Romney-care model in Massachusetts. It was supposed to be a compromise republicans could stomach, and hundreds of their amendments made their way into the final bill, though they ended up voting against it anyway b/c politics
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Except there is a huge misunderstanding of what a single payer solution actually is. Part of the problem with the VA is that it attempts to handle patient care. The major single payer ideas are focused solely on changing how health care is being financed, not how it is delivered.
@CarolRicard @MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump You're misinformed. Dodd-Frank had nothing to do with causing the housing crisis. It was passed in 2010 in an attempt to help PREVENT risky loan and banking practices. The housing crisis peaked in 2009.
I often wonder who the John Dean of #StupidWatergate is going to be. https://t.co/fRHKtd0i0m
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The work they've done in an attempt to address climate change is pragmatic and perhaps the most important issue that'll affect future generations. They might have failed in their major climate bills, but had tons of small successes and acted as the world leader for change.
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The Obama DOJ established guidelines for states regarding medical and then recreational use of marijuana, which are still in place. That was pragmatic.
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The ACA slowed the annual rate of insurance increases and provided insurance for 21M more people. If republicans acted in good faith and/or the Supreme Court held up federal Medicaid expansion, it would have been even more successful. It's now more popular than ever.
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The Iran deal wasn't perfect, but the inspections were working. There's a reason our allies didn't drop out when we did. That was pragmatic incremental progress.
@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The response to the financial crisis was pragmatic and likely saved us from a second great depression. Democrats were murdered at the polls by their base for not being hard enough on big banks and by republicans for the bailouts and what was seen as reckless spending.

@NatureEcho_ @Nickthonton35 @JRagman2 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump The main conclusion of the opposition is that it will do more harm than good and be a step backwards. I disagree with that assessment, but they put together a decent argument.

@NPdejong @MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Though the Trump admin largely reversed course on those reforms as none were made into law. The GOP also wasn't willing to give Obama a bipartisan CJ reform win and never once brought any of the Dem co-sponsored bills to the floor.
@NPdejong @MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump You could make the argument that dems should have addressed this in 09 - 11 when they had unified control, but they used all their political capital on healthcare and the recovery act. Obama actually did a lot re: criminal justice reform by EO and DOJ guidance/reprioritization.
@Nickthonton35 @JRagman2 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump I could not have been more clear with what I was talking about and you ensured me you read it all.

@Nickthonton35 @JRagman2 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump That's obviously not happening here and I don't know how anyone could reach that conclusion from these statements. Trump's name doesn't appear once and these were released months before Trump made a push for the bill once it was clear it'd be coming to the floor for a vote.

@Nickthonton35 @JRagman2 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Because if you weren't, you'd know how ridiculous it is to believe dozens of organizations put in thousands of hours of advocacy work leading to valid criticisms of a bill are just some elaborate ruse to hide anti-Trump bias.

@MikeRyzak1 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump You're welcome. I don't necessarily agree with the opposition as I'm a believer in pragmatic incremental progress, but the opposition in their own words is not how Candace is portraying them. I believe she's being intentionally dishonest.
@change2happen @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump You obviously don't understand the article one powers very well.
@change2happen @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Congress is enshrined in the constitution with the power to create laws governing the citizens of this country.

@TurmanChauncey @zipowitz @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, it became a nonstarter for Obama the moment dems lost the house in 2010.

@BigHomie2 @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Yeah. Both parties want it, which is why it passed with huge bipartisan support. Too bad McConnell hasn't introduced its companion legislation in the senate.
@zipowitz @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump It's how it's done because it's a proven formula. Any political strategist worth their salt will advise members in safe seats to act as the Overton window movers of the party.
@I95megalopolis @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Depends on which representative you're talking about. Lots of legislation passed by all of them. Check out for yourself. https://t.co/GTeGVTFQDK
@zipowitz @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump They take a stand and get a chance to shift the Overton window further from retributive justice to restorative justice. All while still having a bill pass that makes incremental progress in the right direction. That's win-win for them.
@Cat69Q @debpokel @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Except not because the knew the bill would pass the house. If the vote was close, I guarantee they change their vote to get it over the finish line. Their no vote is symbolic and an attempt to shift the Overton window.

@LadyG8tor51 @benshapiro @biddergalore @POTUS @FoxNews @OANN @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @CBS @NBCNews Wow, if you think those outlets are hyper-partisan, what does that make something like occupy democrats? Media bias occurs on a spectrum, and OANN is way to the right compared to where the more mainstream outlets would appear on the left.
@WWeingrad @Zigmanfreud @benshapiro And I'd argue your observation is a classic fallacy fallacy. A YouTuber or independent blogger with a hundred followers probably says Trump is the enemy of the people pretty regularly, but they are not indicative of the media at large. Trump's words ARE indicative of Trump.
@CK13697976 @realjorgemendoz @nmlinguaphile @benshapiro Google is for friend. Your can find a million stories (not hyperbole) critical of Obama from all corners of the media.
@LadyG8tor51 @benshapiro @biddergalore @POTUS @FoxNews @OANN That's a problem right there. OANN is a hyper partisan news network that is feeding you a distorted view of the world that isn't based in reality.
@benshapiro Ben, have you paid any attention to the people who interact with you on a daily basis? If you think people suffering TDS have lost their minds, what are your thoughts about these ignorant sycophants constantly ratioing any critical word you share?
@AltRightTruth @SJRoadW @jaredlholt Jeez. Your perceived victimization is astounding. Why don't you pull yourself up by your bootstraps or something?
@bethanyshondark It's impossible for me to not see how Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and inability to adopt a conciliatory tone to turn down temperature of the current political climate has not significantly contributed to the increase in political violence on both ends of the political spectrum.

@bulldogfan26 @SriramofNorwell @SICEMDAWGS76 @JohnJHarwood The ACA was revenue neutral, paid for by additional taxes that were part of the legislation with or without states expanding Medicaid.
@anamariecox This is Cavvy. He's trying to be good, but the yarn is calling him. https://t.co/aAoCk44ADS
@SriramofNorwell @bulldogfan26 @SICEMDAWGS76 @JohnJHarwood And it really says something about certain red states that they turned down Medicaid expansion, which would cost them nothing, punishing their own residents, just to stick it to Obama.
@bulldogfan26 @SICEMDAWGS76 @JohnJHarwood Any criticism of Obama and the ACA that doesn't acknowledge that fact is either ignorant of how the legislative process unfolded or intentionally dishonest.
@bulldogfan26 @SICEMDAWGS76 @JohnJHarwood What are you talking about? The people who need it most would have had the option to buy in to Medicare starting at age 55. That's how ACA was originally designed. And that transfer of risk is what was used to project the private market cost savings Obama was talking about.
@bulldogfan26 @SICEMDAWGS76 @JohnJHarwood If the private insurance risk pools didn't include a majority of the 55 - 65 age Americans, you'd have seen the promised premium reductions.
@bulldogfan26 @SICEMDAWGS76 @JohnJHarwood It's not patently false. And insurance did increase at a slower rate overall while still insuring millions more Americans. Also, the premium comments occurred when the ACA had a public option that would have transfered much of the higher risk 55-65 age group to Medicare.
@SICEMDAWGS76 @bulldogfan26 @JohnJHarwood What he meant was there was nothing in ACA that would prevent you from seeing the same doctor you'd been seeing for years, which was true. Obviously provider networks and insurance companies strike new deals or let old ones lapse all the time. That has nothing to do w/ ACA though

@William79617191 @Christine_meow @shaunking @RealCandaceO The president is a pretty objectively terrible human. I don't think anyone should support him. There's nothing Trump is doing for the conservative movement that couldn't be accomplished by a President Mike Pence. The sooner, the better.
@miltonbradley02 @shaunking @RealCandaceO If you asked him if he was a conservative, my guess is he says yes. If you ask him if he's a republican, my guess is he says yes. If you ask him where he stands on the issues, my guess is he will support those platforms. That makes him those things.

@natalie201315 @ChuckGrassley Hilarious. You accuse Obama of corruption compared to Trump? I'd be happy to compare indictments and convictions.
@RBMEllis @KyleKashuv Unfortunately, you have to round to the next base of ten so that it's a nice round number. So impeachment is off the table until the djia drops 10^4. Pretty sure that's how this all works.
@ChuckGrassley Because you held open all positions for the final two years of Obama's presidency. Totally ignoring your duty to advise and consent.
@KyleKashuv @RBMEllis I wasn't aware that Trump qualified his 2012 tweet in any way. Though if he did, surely presiding over 4 of the top 10 drops in history within a span of 8 months is a better indicator for automatic impeachment than a drop of 1000 over two days.

@YourLocalJacob I participate in life, so that makes me complicit for everything that's ever happened? Of course not, that's not what that word means.
@YourLocalJacob I'm order to be complicit, it would have to be wrong or unlawful. Laws are by definition lawful. So it'd have to be wrong, which is why we have a judicial system. If you want to keep calling me complicit for participating in government, then whatever, keep fighting the good fight

@YourLocalJacob Apparently you consider my willingness to participate in and abide by the rules of our government to be complicit in their every decision? Look up the definition of complicit, it doesn't mean what you think it does.
@YourLocalJacob Which I believe is a stupid waste of money, but Trump actually isn't the 1 who holds the purse strings, that would be Congress. I had an opportunity to vote for my Congressman and both Senators, and they would need to vote on an appropriations bill to allocate funding for a wall.
@YourLocalJacob You both give consent AND get to control how it's used. You elect lawmakers who act on your behalf, and to earn your vote they tell you how they'd spend tax money towards societal good. It's how civilization is built, but feel free to go it alone and see how far you get.
@YourLocalJacob No... I don't know how you could possibly make that leap from my last comment, but what else should I expect from a grown man who honestly believes that taxation is theft?
@YourLocalJacob Uh, I said nothing of the sort. What I did say is that part of the agreement to our social contract is that we abide by the rules in place regardless of whether we voted for the person who made those rules or not, and if we don't like the rules, we make an effort to change them.
@YourLocalJacob And are his demands demands lawful? If the courts say yes, then I agreed to play ball as part of America's social contract. If the courts say no, then he can scream his demands into the void.		In either event, I'm not "complicit" in his demands. That doesn't even make sense.

@RealSagacity @justinamash So while it doesn't seem like this is a big difference, it has the side effect of suppressing minority votes. I'm actually against party line voting, but then we should double poll workers, voting booths, and number of ballots. We should actually do those 3 things anyway.
@RealSagacity @justinamash Because removing straight ticket voting means it takes longer to vote. Which means long lines at the busiest precincts become even longer. People aren't able to wait in line for 5 hours, so they don't vote. The precincts most effected are usually majority minority districts.

@THcEount @RonDeSantisFL I just meant insurance slightly blurs the line of product or service.
@THcEount @RonDeSantisFL Though I'm not even totally against government subsidies for agriculture as it's such a critical industry. Sometimes that bandaid makes sense on a case by case. However, bailouts to save farmers from the negative consequences of an admin's own awful trade policies is bananas.
@THcEount @RonDeSantisFL I mean, health insurance as a product is a weird middleman to healthcare as a service. It's definitely not the typical industry. I also see a program made available to all (universal healthcare) as a different ballpark from selective redistribution (auto/farm bailouts).
@THcEount @RonDeSantisFL Can there be a compromise to expand Medicare to people 55 or older then? A huge portion of the cost burden is the older and sicker people who don't quite qualify for Medicare. If private insurance didn't have to address them, couldn't we achieve 3 out of 3 for most Americans?
@VP @POTUS If true, that won't even offset that family's health insurance premium increases that are a direct result of republican's sabotage of the ACA. #GOPTaxScam
@RonDeSantisFL Is it so hard to believe that some things should be done for the common good and that healthcare is one of those things? A healthier country is a more productive country, therefore the government has a vested interest in ensuring as healthy a populace as possible. Makes sense.
@RonDeSantisFL What about public utilities, emergency services, infrastructure, education, military, redistribution of wealth to farmers, etc.? Why are we propping up these industries with taxpayer dollars instead of letting the free market dictate the cream that rises to the top?

@CurmudgeonlyOpa @danopticon @KyleKashuv Good faith would have acknowledged the full context and accounting of the Obama administration's foreign policy actions towards Russia. The Daily Wire didn't do that, and they didn't do that in order to propagate current White House talking points.

@XIJUMP23MANIX @MicroSuperFan @Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller Feel free to back up the claim by providing clear evidence of their bias.
@betorn @KyleKashuv My point is that the Daily Wire article omits a lot Obama's foreign policy decisions as it relates to Russia and ignores the context that everything changed after annexation of Crimea. He intentionally makes it seem like Trump was much harder on Russia than Obama, but he's not.
@MicroSuperFan @Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller Uh, no it hasn't. It's actually the universally accepted opinion of all the US intelligence agencies and the most recent indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers is insanely detailed into what was done when and by whom.
@KyleKashuv The point was more to show actions by Obama that were omitted and to highlight the fact that a lot of what Trump did was done begrudgingly in response to veto-proof bipartisan legislation. Didn't need anything more recent to do that.
@jasoninthehouse Does the hat make it easier to hide the fact you can't look your daughter in the eye?
While Obama deserves lots of credit, there were millions of households who never recovered. Seeing the fat cats who caused the financial crisis back to making fortunes while peoples' homes, cars, jobs, savings, and retirement were all still gone was insult to injury. https://t.co/cGryjLAUxU
@Darternole @Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller Or the millions paid to them by Perkins Cole what?
@KyleKashuv That's really the whole article? Huh. I assumed it would be more fleshed out and provide a more thorough accounting. Try this instead https://t.co/d6YcHMO7N6
@Darternole @Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller I obviously can't prove anything definitively, but Occam's Razor heavily implies CrowdStrike did absolutely nothing nefarious. And why would they? Cui bono? Reason, logic, and the available evidence point the other direction.
@Darternole @Forrestc25 @Goathair33 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller Obviously there's no information detailing sources and methods for identifying Fancy Bear, but despite issuing later corrections, they stand by their main assertions about the Howitzer hack. Maybe they're wrong, but I highly doubt it was intentional or malicious.
@Darternole @Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller Nothing to gain and everything to lose by trying to pull one over on the FBI. There's about a zero percent chance a company like CrowdStrike would ever do that.
@Trump201711 @Forrestc25 @Goathair33 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller No, their professional reputation hasn't been too affected by this actually. They're big time; so it's IT Directors, CTO, CFO, and CEOs who are making contacting decisions, and those people don't really buy into conspiracy theories. They just look at CrowdStrike's body of work.
@Trump201711 @Forrestc25 @Goathair33 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller I take it as they'll do what it takes to protect their reputation as a business who contracts with some of the biggest companies in the world. The last thing they want is to alienate themselves from future clients by becoming involved in any controversy related to their work.
@Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller You're right though, they could have saved themselves a lot of grief had the FBI ran point from the beginning.
@Goathair33 @Forrestc25 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller It is my understanding that despite not getting the physical server, the FBI was provided bit by bit mirrored copies in addition to the CrowdStrike analysis. I bet if the DNC knew they'd still be getting bad press about the server 2 years later, they'd have just turned it over.
@JudgeJeanine @DarrellIssa Republicans cowardice and inability to be any sort of a check on an obviously unfit president has gotten out of control. Helsinki isn't even a week old and already we've moved on to another sex scandal and Trump's out golfing and yelling at black football players.

@Forrestc25 @Goathair33 @ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq @DailyCaller CrowdStrike has a stellar industry reputation and their digital forensics services are by all accounts spectacular. They've been hired by plenty of republicans too, because they're good at what they do.

Someone coming forward after seeing a person in the spotlight is not as suspect as people think. It's a matter of visibility. And once one person comes forward, it becomes easier for others to do the same. This is especially prescient considering we're talking male athletes. https://t.co/J9V3B8WhZU

@oilgypsy @swcollings @Jenfeds73 @NoahCRothman Except Medicare 100% is more efficient than private insurance. It's not even close.
@oilgypsy @Jenfeds73 @swcollings @NoahCRothman Well considering the cost of Medicaid to state governments, it seems appropriate to include state revenue since they carry a large portion of the healthcare burden for low income Americans.
@oilgypsy @Jenfeds73 @swcollings @NoahCRothman Stephen is right. Medicare is more efficient with a lower ACR that ANY private insurance company. It's amazing the bargaining power you have when you have a membership of close to 100M people.
@oilgypsy @Jenfeds73 @swcollings @NoahCRothman Your tax revenue estimates are way off. $6.2T in total revenue. You're also thinking about it in the wrong terms. The  $3.1569T is ALREADY being spent. Instead of paying insurance companies, the money will be collected via taxes. Larger coverage pool also means better rates too.
@oilgypsy @Jenfeds73 @swcollings @NoahCRothman Medicare patients are older and sicker. Not remotely fair to average out those cost to everyone. There's math that works. Other countries do it, eventually the US will too.
@oilgypsy @Jenfeds73 @swcollings @NoahCRothman That's the annual budget. $32T for single payer is over 10 years, and that's the HIGH estimate. Now consider the current 17% of GDP spent on healthcare. That's $3.1569T annually right there! Add a payroll tax for both individual and employers and it's covered.
@AndyfromTucson @NoahCRothman @benshapiro Me too. There's a $19T range of costs, but he can pin down the exact dollar amount for the average American. Amazing!
@NoahCRothman So you can't give a tighter range then $13T - $33T, but you can put a dollar figure on how much it will cost on average annually? How about you show your work?

@johannajwahl @TomFitton @KimKardashian @realDonaldTrump He did care. Obama commuted the sentences of thousands of non-violent drug offenders who were over-charged. Unfortunately, that still only scratched the surface and the majority of those incarcerated are in county jails or state prisons, not federal prisons.
@TomFitton @KimKardashian @realDonaldTrump The liberals I've seen on Twitter are happy another over-sentenced non-violent drug offender is back in society where she belongs and appreciate Kim for the advocacy she did for criminal justice reform.
