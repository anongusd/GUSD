@bparkerhouse Indeed. I recommend reading the piece, which gets into details.
The funny thing is even if HR1 became law, Republicans would still have massive unfair advantages, from Fox News to the electoral college. But they are so unpopular they fear those huge advantages aren’t enough and so they also need voter suppression and dark money. https://t.co/q5Xz40MxOZ
Both the religious right and “libertarian” groups that support vampiric capitalist systems oppose HR1. They know their views are unpopular and that they can’t win unless they cheat. https://t.co/FcuHw96nur

@KathaPollitt Anyway, I don't have a lot of time to argue on Twitter. But here's actual research: https://t.co/lnMZImfqDH
@KathaPollitt I'd argue the opposite: Long sentences for rape cause everyone from police to prosecutors to juries to be more reluctant to put men behind bars, more open to hearing special pleading about how this young man's life will be ruined. So it hurts the certainty of punishment.
@KathaPollitt I believe this in violent crime, as well. The problem with rape isn’t short sentences, but that most rapists get away with it. If rape was a year long sentence, but a 90% chance of punishment, I bet rape would decline significantly.
@KathaPollitt Anyway, I would gladly take these short sentences for white collar criminals in exchange for a system where there was an overall reduction in sentences, coupled with an increase in certainty for punishment. This has been a consistent position.
@KathaPollitt I doubt it, but again, no way to know unless we actually start consistently punishing people instead of making it a 1 out of 100 proposition of even getting caught.
@KathaPollitt I would like to test that assertion, but there’s no way to know, because the current situation is “not getting caught”, so there’s no way to know. But my guess is a lot of people would not commit crimes if they thought they’d do any prison time.
@LexAlexander I think 47 months would feel satisfying if it wasn't the sentence we dole out for low level crimes that, in a sane country, would only result in 30 day or fewer sentences.
@KathaPollitt I am not an expert, but from what I understand, swiftness and certainty of punishment is more effective at deterrence than sentence length. If we took money out of imprisoning people and put it into actually bothering to enforce white collar criminal laws, that would do more.
That feels less satisfying than “lock him up!” but that’s the problem. In a sane country, 47 months would be an eye-popping sentence. But that’s one we dole out for petty crimes here. That’s bonkers. We need a society where 47 months is a “holy shit, that’s long” is the standard.
Our idea of what constitutes “just” punishment is distorted by the ridiculously long sentences people get for other crimes. Shorten those to reasonable amounts — many low level crimes shouldn’t even result in prison time! — and Manafort’s sentence will start to look more just.
Length of sentences matters less in deterring crime than swiftness and certainty of punishment. White collar criminals don’t do what they do because they think they’ll “only” get 5 years — 5 years is a lot! — but because they think they won’t get caught.
If you want to to offer more direct help to people in need, consider The Bail Project:		https://t.co/x4rS8iLIOp		A lot of people spend months and years in jail, just awaiting trial, because they can’t make bail. Take that anger about Manafort and turn it into good for them.
If you’re mad and want to do something, here are some groups you can support:		The Brennan Center for Justice https://t.co/fKCGddTSLq		The Sentencing Project	https://t.co/ZagykcOsUe
The solution to this problem is not to try to somehow get longer sentences for rich white men. It’s to push for a less punitive system overall. Excessive  sentences do nothing to deter crime or rehabilitate criminals, but they do destroy families and communities.
I’m so glad to see people furious that Paul Manafort, a criminal who enriched himself from human rights abuses, used his privilege to obtain a light sentence, while poorer people and people of color get railroaded daily for much lesser crimes.

@JenniferJerboa Individual chapters can vary, but their badges are mostly geared towards genuinely good stuff for girls.
Anyway, while they use overblown rhetoric and lies, the core fear — that  Girl Scouts teaches girls self-sufficiency and self-esteem — is real enough. That they fear it is what makes them awful.
@t_a_pierce Oh, the sacrifices.
I’m not even remotely surprised that AOC is not being folded into the case against the Girl Scouts. They’re terrified of what she represents, which is more women and younger women moving into bold leadership roles, and so are scaremongering about it.
This has been going on with the religious right for awhile, and they often try to make it seem like Girl Scouts are teaching girls to be lesbians or make them get abortions (no doubt at the same time, since lesbianism is a surefire route to abortion, dontcha know).
https://t.co/hBqB2oKTCd The woman calling on a Girl Scout boycott is part of a larger religious right war on the group,  which they oppose because it teaches girls leadership and self-esteem, instead of teaching them they are subjugates who exist to serve men.

Anyway, peek behind the curtain. As a survivor myself, I can say that survivors are full, complex people. Being raped sadly doesn’t automatically mean you are on the side of other rape victims. I want to see McSally stand up for real, not just with words.
This is especially frustrating, as @SenGillibrand has been behind an actual solution, one McSally seems, from what I can tell, to oppose: Removing sexual assault adjudication from chain of command and giving authority to military law enforcement.
As far as I can tell, McSally’s “solution” is a vague call on commanders to do better, but I don’t see any movement towards  making that happen beyond just asking into the ether.
The coverage of Sen. McSally coming out about her rape is frustrating. Yes, she’s a human and her story matters. But she is also a legislator, and my question is what she intends to do to prevent this crime from happening to other people or to get justice for victims.

@loki_monster Read my article. No need to make me rewrite on Twitter when you can click over. There are links and explanations of the legal maneuvers.
@loki_monster I don't think so. Here's what the dad said: “We had a long discussion over what she was going to do when she got pregnant. And we said we would support her either way,” he said, adding, “They weren’t married, and I felt legally it was her right to make that decision.”
Now, he was 19, so this isn't like some kind of child molestation thing and he shouldn't be prosecuted for rape. But it also adds dimension to this, showing that it literally is antis supporting a young man who wants to rob a teenage girl of her future.
https://t.co/QoxfboBre9 Magers was an unemployed legal adult and the girl’s father said he pressured her into sex. But antis are treating him like a victim, deprived his right to strong-arm a high schooler into a relationship and into motherhood.
https://t.co/MiMmgGYU8a I wrote about this case yesterday, of a man suing an abortion clinic, claiming they should have forced his girlfriend to have a baby. Well, new details have emerged.		The biggest? The “woman” he wished to force childbirth on is actually a girl of 16.
@LuxAlptraum Yep,  by their age, it’s more like 5 out of 25.
https://t.co/wgymny26w0 There is no way that the Trump administration honestly thinks wolf populations have been sufficiently restored. This is about putting cattle ranching and oil drilling interests over the preservation of our beautiful country, as usual.
@Kswan55 What they’re actually afraid of is people of color being equal. Trump is only too happy to have an underclass of people determined by ethnicity. And depriving people of birth control aids that goal, by making it harder for low income people to get educations and better jobs.
Every girl gets this lecture, I’m sure, especially if they grow up in a community, like I did, where teen pregnancy rates are high. But the lecture doesn’t stop sperm from meeting egg. Condoms do. Pills do. IUDs do. And that’s the “secret” for those who succeeded. https://t.co/nU11OHoKwh
So while it may seem “no duh” to some people, it’s critical for reporters to explain the central role that birth control plays in preventing pregnancy and underline how lack of it is the reason for early and unwanted pregnancies. Every single article should emphasize that.
The right would have you believe women don’t need birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy, that there’s some other way to do it. There isn’t, not realistically. “Abstinence” has been tried over and over and over and over and it failed.
This oversight is no small thing in an era when the Trump administration is trying to take birth control away from low income women and hand wave away the fact that this is basically damning them to unwanted pregnancies.
https://t.co/xldGFXgDqP For some reason, this story utterly neglects to mention birth control. This is a gross oversight. The reason women in better economic circumstances don’t get pregnant young because they have access to birth control, full stop.
Why are you acting like Trump’s stooge? https://t.co/kTfF5jo2IY

"Trump Demands Ban On Taco Trucks" vs. "Standard White Guy Democrat Introduces Policy To Make Prescription Drugs 10% Cheaper". Hey, journalists have to eat. It's not going to be the latter that gets front paged.
Trust me, in our click-and-ratings-driven media, if editors have to choose between headlining "Trump Calls For Mandatory Deportions Of Ex-Wives" and "Standard Centrist White Guy Democrat Calls For $10 Minimum Wage", they're going with the former every time.
@jschaedler You're confusing "has an amusing personality for a dinner party" with "able to capture public and media attention and direct it to his policy preferences".
Trump is going to spend the entire 2020 election cycle pulling stunts, throwing tantrums, and otherwise dominating the media landscape. Any Democrat will struggle to get attention. A generic white guy who reads as "boring" will never get a word in edgewise. https://t.co/yg9f7js5yP
Here's the problem with "safe" candidates: They are also boring. If you want to win, you need someone who motivates and inspires. Yes, a motivating and inspiring candidate will also fire up the opposition. But the alternative is losing Democratic voters as people tune out. https://t.co/gn4Soi79am

@ShermanPXavier I promise it takes less time to read it than to write two healthy sized tweets!

@janeinak I wish that were so, but trust me, this is something a ton of Democrats, especially wealthy donors, are saying, anon to reporters and behind close doors, but saying.
https://t.co/lLqtOK9fSa A whole lot of Democrats are starting to worry that the only way to beat Trump is to play it “safe” by running a white man, ideally a centrist.		But that’s not safe at all. On the contrary, such a move will make it harder to win.
Here's the problem with giving men the "right" to veto an abortion: Any man who would use it is not fit to be a father or a partner. Any such man is, by definition, an abuser. https://t.co/W5m7AQA8bV
Again, all anti-choice arguments are rooted in the baseline assumption that women are inferior to men and cannot be trusted to know things like their own lives and own circumstances. And so if they say, “I can’t tell him, he’ll kill me,” antis just say, “Oh, women know nothing.”
Of course, this “abstract” kind of question hides the grim realities of what they’re suggesting. In reality, if a woman doesn’t feel comfortable engaging the man who got her pregnant about her decision, there’s usually a very good reason for it.
Men who “honestly” wonder why sticking your penis in someone doesn’t give you veto rights over her medical decisions. So honest. So sincerely worried. https://t.co/zjetERWlLl

I've seen my fair share of women who just give up cooking after years of trying to please picky kids and whiny husbands. I often think the only reason I even bother cooking is I don't have to worry about either.
It's like with the abortion debate: People are so ready to believe women are stupid and lazy. In reality, women do a lot of grunt work without reward or even thanks, because they have to. And if they fall down, it's often because the amount of work is overwhelming.
I'm also troubled by the assumption that if women are struggling to create multiple weekly meals that are affordable, diverse, delicious and pleasing to the entire family, then it's because they're not trying hard enough.

@txoffender Instead of immediately moving to judge victims, try empathy. Try some listening. Watch the documentary!
*Just. Anyway, nearly everyone is suspectible to being told they are special. No one likes to hear, "Well, you're perfectly ordinary but I don't want to be lonely, so you'll do." And abusers exploit this desire that pretty much everyone has, to feel seen, to feel special.
I ask people to watch this documentary with an open heart. Stop throwing up defensive claims that “I would never” and “I can’t imagine”. Try radical empathy. Because you may think you’re too strong to love an abuser, but in most cases, you were ju lucky not to be targeted.
What people fail to understand when they shame victims for being confused, for loving their abusers, for going back is they are doing the abuser’s work for them. They make the victims feel broken and alone, and therefore even more emotionally dependent on their abusers.
Survivors often go back over and over again to their abusers, and that’s what the victims (and their mothers) in this case say happened. And they get blamed for it — why did you go back, if it was so bad? 		And people are often shamed out of the real answer, which is love.
Sat down and watched “Leaving Neverland” last night. It’s a tough thing to watch, but an important addition to the discussion of sexual and domestic abuse. Because one thing the documentary addresses that a lot of other discourse about abuse elides is the the role of love.

But while it may be slammed as "PC", I appreciate Tabitha King's efforts here to redefine the traditional meaning of "wife" away from that as a subservient role. Aspirational language can help change current realities and make the world a better place.

@emanzi That *used* to be true. Recently, when a celebrity dies, and a bunch of people react to the obits by saying, no no no, we have to deal with the fact that this person was abusive. See: All the angst over Bowie allegedly having sex with an underage girl.
@dyspepticJ @mikeijames That is extremely easy to say for a white man. For women who are victims of abuse or who have been excluded for most of history from even being allowed into the arts, it's not so simple.

@BroderickGreer It’s not as hard as people think! Just don’t skip steps.

@plain47 Good point. There, I think the conflict between Cosby’s public image and his reality is an issue. But most of these artists don’t present as moral arbiters. MJ actually put out songs asking if redemption and change were possible.
@earnestp I still think it’s mostly a post hoc rationalization for an urge that’s more about abstract desire for justice. If I play R Kelly at a wedding, he doesn’t see an extra dime, since I spin my MP3. But it’s still considered poor taste. So it’s not $$.
@Karlcastan Your personal taste is your taste, but it’s very odd and completely out of line with everything historians and experts know about music. So feel free not to like it, but you are simply wrong is denying the immense skill and genius.

People bring up money, and I think that’s interesting but not really why cancel culture is a thing. For instance, all my MJ records are used, bought at secondhand shops. But I still have this question of whether it’s okay to play them or own them.
@Karlcastan That’s an easy thing to tell yourself,  but it’s simply not true. We have to make space to admit someone can both be an abuser and a genius. The question is what we do with that knowledge.
@KateHarding I cut it for space, but I remember that MJ’s resurgence happened after he died for exactly this reason. But nowadays, the cancel response rises up when someone dies and people demand a reckoning for unpunished crimes.  (See: David Bowie.)
I know it’s a big ask on social media, but I’d love to hear if people have good faith and nuanced responses to this very difficult issue.		Victim-blamers and deniers get blocked, though. Let’s get past  pretending bad shit didn’t happen.
I think a lot of artists that people say are “cancelled”  now wouldn’t have to be — if they had ever  faced any real punishment. But imagine if they did. Then we could still enjoy their work, knowing that they got what was coming to them for personal transgressions. https://t.co/8r5xLNvUW6

Trump’s Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, of course, is married to Amway scion Dick DeVos. They are rigidly fundamentalist, and Amway has a vampiric relationship to evangelical churches, plugging into their social networks  in order to perpetuate their lucrative MLM scheme.
BTW, the claims that P&amp;G was the cover for a Satanic cult were traced back to Amway distributors who were trying to convince people to buy cleaning supplies through a MLM instead of just going to the store. https://t.co/OPlJRxj8Xe
The “born alive” myth is up there with the Satanic panic over day cares, claims that P&amp;G is secretly a Satanic cult, and that gay men put hamsters in their butts: Urban myths floated mostly by fundamentalists who are trying to demonize enemies with what is basically blood libel.
Antis want you to believe that women deliberately go through 9 months pregnancies because they get off on killing babies. That’s what they’re implying. 		As with witch hunters, the point is to say that if women aren’t kept under firm control, they become serial killers. https://t.co/JpOICz44WX
That’s why I believe anti-abortion people are the modern day equivalent of witch hunters of old. https://t.co/JOqH9babKh The stories they tell aren’t supposed to make sense. They’re the equivalent of saying women cavort with Satan.

But if there was a chance they would get fair coverage that highlights the difference between Democratic honesty and Republican mendacity, I suspect there’d be more interest in spending more time asking questions (like @AOC did) and less making speeches.
I’ll add that if reporters don’t like Democratic showboating, then stop incentivizing it. Right now, Democrats know their motives will be impugned as equivalent to Republicans with that empty word “partisan”, so they might as well play to the cheap seats.
It also shows that true objectivity and “balance” are in tension. A truly objective take on the hearing would be to note that the Republican party was not remotely interested in the truth, and  to dwell on that difference, which is the real story.
It creates a false equivalence between Democrats asking real questions, some which revealed new information, and Republicans spending their time literally trying to bury the truth. 		It’s a frame that suggests both transparency and deception are equally suspect.
The way the “objective” media felt the need to frame the Cohen hearing as “partisan” shows how “objectivity” and “balance” serves to conceal, not illuminate, the truth. 		That frame, for instance, draws a false equivalence between Democrats telling truths and Republicans lying.
And once Trump is gone, they will do the same to him. https://t.co/yjzkR0aG3r

@Th1nk1ngTh1ng FFS, just don't. For once, just don't.
Republicans may repeat “book deal” until they’re blue in the face. But Michael didn’t get a book deal. He got a jail sentence. And they cannot hide that fact.
Sadly, way too many women have dealt with what Mark Meadows just did in their own lives: Men who are wrong, who know they are wrong, but will just get in your face and scream and yell until you give in and agree to their lie.
Meadows strategically flying into a rage in order to cow women out of speaking the truth is so infuriating. That’s how men control women: By using intimidation and their license to rage in order to silence women and suppress the truth.
And now Jim Jordan again with the GOP line, which is that Trump’s long habit of hiring criminals because he knows they will do crimes for him somehow exonerates him.
That was Trump, in public, claiming basically that all black people are on welfare. That's who he is in public. So there's literally no reason to disbelieve what Cohen says he's like in private.
https://t.co/5Bmpiz8wVa  Trump had to settle with the DOJ after an investigation found that he and his father would not rent to black people who met the same financial profile as white renters. Trump claimed the DOJ was trying to force him to rent to "welfare recipients".
Cohen's private observations comport with Trump's public behavior, include his habit of claiming that prominent black people — Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, Spike Lee to name a few — are "low IQ", faking their grades, unable to speak without notes.
As a reminder, what Meadows literally did was argue that because Trump has one black employee, that somehow wipes out his long-standing history of racism. As a reminder, here is what Cohen accused Trump of doing, and let's admit we all believe every word. https://t.co/OifFAmA1XG
Now Meadows is using Cummings, trying to hide behind their collegial relationship to cover for what was a shameful act of overt racism — literally hauling a woman out and making it seem that because Trump will be in a room with her, that means he's not racist.
A) Tlaib is right that it's a racist act. B) Meadows is absolutely a racist, because duh. C) And god save us from his feigned outrage.
Rashida Tlaib shames Republicans for using woman as "a prop". Mark Meadows is responding by talking about Tlaib as if she's a child.
Ayanna Pressley asks if someone can have “a black friend and still be racist”?		Cohen: “Yes.”
And now we’re back to Republicans insisting that it somehow exonerates Trump to harp on how Trump hires sleazy criminals to do sleazy crime work for him.
3) They thought he could be intimidated. But he’s a professional bully. He might be chastened after all that’s happened, but there’s no way belligerence intimidates this guy.
2) They thought Cohen would be defensive and say things that would incriminate himself. But he’s a man with little to lose, and it shows.
Mistakes Republicans made: 		1) They thought Cohen was here for some kind of partisan gain for Democrats. He’s not, as evidenced by his willingness to shoot down certain trains of inquiry that would politically benefit them.
All Democrats! Are we finally done with Republicans pretending to be outraged about Cohen’s past lies, when we know they’re just outraged about his current truths? https://t.co/MmxZE0KarF

I’m not sure why Cohen is so sure Trump wouldn’t hit Melania. Cohen was involved in trying to cover up Ivana’s deposition testimony accusing Trump of rape, and then defended himself by falsely saying it’s not a crime to rape your wife.
The Republicans are really outraged about a book deal that doesn’t exist, while also indifferent to crimes that Trump is implicated in that actually happened.
Republicans would have you believe this criminal Michael Cohen just happened to Trump, like he showed up in Trump’s office one day and started doing crimes and poor Trump just couldn’t fire him because reasons.
Goddamn, we get it: The Republican position is that when Trump conspires to commit crimes with his lawyer, the lawyer is a terrible criminal and Trump is an angel made of gold and silk who is above reproach.

They aren’t trying to convince anyone. They are propping up conspiracy theories and distractions for Fox News to feed to the base. The base also does not believe this stuff, but will repeat it to keep justifying their support for Trump. https://t.co/3MDEsSc8dm
Hard to deny that Cohen’s got a point about how he’s going to prison and frankly has nothing left to lose.
“I did the same thing you’re doing now, for 10 years,” Cohen tells Republicans. 		Yep.
American 2019: A bunch of lying Republicans pretending to be outraged about Cohen’s past lies that they actually supported in order to discredit the truths he’s telling now.		We live in hell.
RT @samstein: Paul Gosar’s own family members cut an ad urging—pleading—with people not to vote for their brother.

RT @marinafang: Reminder that Jim Jordan allegedly ignored and helped cover up serial sexual abuse at Ohio State. https://t.co/tNJaGkkUBK
Cohen’s argument, I would say, is not that he’s a great guy, but that he was a professional liar hired by another liar who needed someone to do some more lying and also some crimes.
Jordan is trying to argue that Trump’s lengthy history of firing people who might be onto him is somehow…exonerating of Trump? 		I mean, the fact that he fires anyone who gets close to exposing him is pretty damning evidence of Trump’s guilt.
Dragging Lynne Patton up to do “Trump hired a black person” theater makes clear that the entire GOP strategy is to pander to their own base and flatter Trump. They have no other goals here.
RT @emptywheel: Shorter Jim Jordan: What kind of sleazebag would you have to be to defend someone like Donald Trump?
Republicans appear to think Cohen was going to cower. But this is a guy whose entire job was bullying people on Trump’s behalf. Fascinating that what made him so good at his vile job is helping him now.
“His instinct to blame others is strong!” Jordan screams. 		Trump. Was. His. Boss.
RT @benphillips76: @BenjySarlin The whole Republican party is protecting Trump. There is no non-Trump/post-Trump Republican party. There is…
Worth repeating: No doubt Cohen was criminally minded in general.		That’s why Trump hired him. 		He needed someone who was willing to do sleazy and illegal things.
I knew coming in that Republicans would hammer at Cohen’s past lying while pretending that it wasn’t on Trump’s behalf. 		But it’s still really stressful. How can they be so completely and totally void of any morality whatsoever?
“Trump’s desire to win would have him work with anyone”
Historians: Is there a precedent for a victim of a crime being able to ask questions about it during a congressional hearing? Because whatever else you might think of DWS, she was the victim of the criminal hacking.
It’s absolutely maddening, this gaslighting Jordan is engaging in. It’s true that Cohen is a sleaze. 		That’s WHY Trump hired him. Trump WANTED criminally minded people because he wanted people willing to commit crimes.
Jordan’s line of questioning should also be a reminder that Trump has publicly hinted at blackmailing Cohen with this information.
This whole “Trump’s longtime lawyer is a terrible person” strategy shouldn’t work, because it should just remind people that Trump saw criminality as a plus in his hiring strategy. But The Mighty Base will play along with anything.
Like I said, literally every minute is precious. There are so many crimes.
As with many people in history, Cohen is a clear example of someone who didn't know how far in over his head he was until it was far, far too late.
It’s easy to laugh at Michael Cohen, but man, it must feel surreal to be in his position. I imagine when he took a job, it  was mostly about paying off mistresses and threatening vendors with lawsuits if they dared send an invoice. No way did he see this as his future.

This testimony about the Moscow Tower really establishes, I think, the likeliest narrative: Trump was being used by the Russians to damage Clinton’s presidency before it even began, and in return, he gets a sweet deal on a tower in Moscow. Speculation, but best one from evidence.
Cohen’s claim about Trump directing Stone to work with Wikileaks is not surprising, but we shouldn’t glide by it. Everyone knew those emails were being stolen. It’s as if there was direct evidence of Nixon ordering the Watergate break-in.
What we’re going to learn today is that every single Republican on the House Oversight committee is a wretched piece of shit who will not hesitate to grandstand and lie on behalf of a man they know full well is a criminal who betrayed his country.		Don’t lose sight of that.
Gosh, this Michael Cohen guy sounds like a piece of shit. Who was he working for again?
So it seems the GOP argument will be that Michael Cohen somehow was working for Hillary Clinton in her dastardly plan to commit campaign finance crimes to help Trump win the election.
Republicans dig into the argument that Cohen can’t be trusted….because he’s a liar. And the game is trying to avoid saying who he lied on behalf of.
I appreciate Cummings rage, but this really is a situation where every minute is precious. Cohen has a lot of crimes to talk about! Time really is super precious!
It’s weird how terrified Republicans are. They all know that Cohen could give them the pee tape and Trump’s rabid base wouldn’t care, so long as he keeps up the racism.
It doesn’t actually matter when you get Cohen’s testimony. There’s enough to justify impeaching Trump by the end of the 2nd page. https://t.co/pNwZS9dfQS
You know Republicans believe Trump has committed a dizzying number of crimes that they think chipping even 5 minutes away from hearing time will reduce the amount of damaging info that comes out.
Most of Cohen’s written testimony is riveting stuff, but this passage, I fear, hurts his credibility. No one thinks Melania Trump is a good person. https://t.co/pW6qaO0y3M
RT @juliaioffe: If #Cohen is a liar and his testimony is pointless, why are they so afraid to hear it?

And replies, “My goodness, young lady,” and lecturing her on how premarital sex makes women incapable of loving or being loved. And no birth control is offered.		That’s the end game, however slowly they are rolling it out.
What the GOP envisions is a 20-year-old going to a “birth control” clinic and a staffer saying, “Here is the only option: You and your husband abstain from sex half the month—“		And when the patient says, “I don’t have a husband, I’m 20,” the staffer acts aghast....

@Astorionics “Need”? Anyway, read my piece instead of making me rewrite it here. This isn’t about someone having a specific sexual desire for girls under 18, but taking pleasure in dominance and cruelty.
@Astorionics I think that's backwards and I recommend reading the piece. I don't think sexual abuse is rooted in horniness, but in the desire to hurt and dominate.
These are men who aren't satisfied with being able to buy any luxury or consensual experience imaginable. They want to hurt people and sexually abuse women, to luxuriate in being so wealthy they are shielded from consequences.
It's fantastic that people are speaking more about wealth inequality and redistribution. But to really make the moral case for it, I think we need to bravely look at stories like Kraft, Trump, and Epstein and call out the way that excessive wealth leads to moral depravity.

It’s like the “incel” thing. If women were so hateful and angry towards men in that way, they’d be regarded as monsters. With men, however, we’re expected to have a “discussion” about restricting women’s freedom so these guys might be able to have sex.
The obvious solution here is to start holding men to a higher standard. But people don’t like doing that. It feels ungenerous. With men, we’re trained to look for excuses for the behavior and to seeks ways to placate instead of punish.
The issue with the Klobuchar story isn’t that she’s being held to too high a standard, but that men are held to too low a standard. Men who behave how she reportedly does get to be endearing grumpy grandpas.

@QueenInYeIIow No, the sidewalk. And it happens all the time, that was just the most recent. And this happened when I carried books. A lot of men are weirdly unnerved at seeing evidence of a woman’s internal life.
But now dudes who are furious at reminders that women have internal lives not about them — because we read, play games, etc. — have this “phones are bad" cover story to bash women, and man, they are taking full advantage.
Some dude yelled at me for being on my phone the other day. What was I doing? Playing a video game — the sort of thing no one would think twice about if I was using a TV instead of a phone. Again, I think he was mad for the same reason men get mad at women who read in public.
Why yes, I play games or read Twitter or listen to audiobooks to “cope with boredom”. Before phones, I carried a book around to do the same. But no one thought that was shameful. The only negative reactions were from men who were mad that I wasn’t paying attention to them.
https://t.co/yJXKine3In This kind of thing is why I can’t stop being skeptical of the “addiction” discourse around phones. By all means, if your phone use is harming your life, then do something about it. But why assume that everyone you see on a phone has a problem? https://t.co/dhzAXCog9f

In fact, if sex work is legal and sex workers feel safe calling the police, they can actually help expose traffickers.
Unfortunately, even when selling sex is legal, underground markets exist for this reason: A lot of men pay for sex precisely because they want it to be non-consensual. Which isn’t an argument against legalizing sex work.
I’m sure many people have pointed this out, but Bob Kraft is super, super rich. He could pay someone making $2K an hour and that would mean less to him than a dollar to most of us.		He went to a “massage parlor” because he didn’t want someone who was safe and well-compensated.

Anyway, it's a lot like all the right wing outrage over progressives supposedly "defending" Ralph Northam for blackface, when in reality, progressives were largely condemning him.
@sainttoad Which is really hypocritical of people who are angry about a hoax. Maybe they should also be angry that the president lies as easily as he breathes, due to the concerns over honesty.
Like, the obvious reason to ignore that Trump also condemned the alleged Smollett attack is that everyone just assumes he doesn't mean it. Which is messed up. There is nothing exonerating about Trump because we all know he is lying when he pretends to oppose racism.
Particularly telling that Kamala Harris gets bashed for issuing a standard issue condemnation of the attack, but Trump does not for doing exactly the same thing. The double standard is stark.

Briefly acknowledging Warren only to make strained arguments against her as a "reformist" gets just way too close to the "let the dudes have this one, it's the only way to shut them up" thinking. "Reformist" is code "for actually accomplishes goals", which is, you know, good.

@DemagoguesRUS Yep, that’s about what an upper middle class person with a little extra cash to throw at a candidate early in race would likely give.
It’ll be interesting to see this play out. What wins: Men writing checks or women knocking on doors? The answer might have impacts beyond just this election cycle.
But I suspect the other, mostly female frontrunners may have a quiet advantage: The same women who put in the time and shoe leather that won the Democrats the 2018 midterms. Women may not have as much money to give, but they’ve been better at organizing and putting in the work.
Bernie’s fundraising isn’t really a surprise. His base of support is well-off white guys who have some cash to spare and are really hyped up to box out the up-and-coming candidates.

Of course, the problem with my plan is that the same dumbasses who want candidates to adopt the M4A branding, without looking at the details, might claim they are "betrayed" and throw the next election to Republicans if, inevitably, it becomes a buy-in program. Such a conundrum.
@joeff53 Of course, but as with the Medicaid expansion, the subsidies to the government program often end up being cheaper that those to private insurers.
I'm not jazzed about Klobuchar and don't really see the point, but I think a buy-in is a perfectly legitimate way to expand Medicare or Medicaid for all people.
Frankly, the way to square this problem is to just go ahead and buy into the lefty branding of Medicare-for-All. Most of the haters don't even look at the details. And M4A could be done immediately or gradually with a buy-in — something Congress needs to decide anyway.
https://t.co/iQzUkOJJnT  Medicaid buy-in, which Klobuchar supports, is a great policy and might even lead to single payer more successfully that the tear-it-up-and-start-over proposal. That said, I see the argument for why you don’t start from the compromise position.
https://t.co/WPMDN2Lyln When people say it’s all too easy to imagine fascism happening here, this is the sort of thing they’re thinking about.
@KathleenRuns @barrydeutsch In addition, this thinking is flat-out wrong. 80% of women with a post-graduate degree and 82% with a bachelor's degree have children. https://t.co/mhUAlwlCuy That's lower than the motherhood rates for less educated women, but by teeny tiny amounts.
@KathleenRuns @barrydeutsch That's really unfair and frankly kind of cruel to imply that women have children only out of ignorance. I'm childless, but I sure don't think my path is the best one. Most people *want* to have children.
@barrydeutsch The U.S. Fertility Rate Is Down, Yet More Women Are Mothers   https://t.co/ObLtxflW0a Taken over a lifetime, we can see the childcare benefit will help more people than free college.  There are some pitfalls, but I think Warren in particular has thought them through.
@barrydeutsch 86% of women become mothers.
People don’t like talking about how women’s relative inequality compared to their husbands or male partners does real damage to women’s quality of life, but it’s a real issue. And I think this could help.
But childcare helps people in a more egalitarian way. Plus, and this is critical, it reduces inequalities between men and women. That has all sorts of benefits, some not even economic.
Subsidized college might help reduce some inequalities, but not much. Well-off people will still have massive advantages getting their kids into prestigious schools and replicating privilege.
As you say, ideally both,  it if I had to choose, subsidized childcare over free college any day. As you say, early financial lift over later. As important: Not everyone goes to college, but most people work and have children. https://t.co/hScXMS74Gl
@Kevin_M_Horn Sure you did.
@Kevin_M_Horn Frankly, I feel Sanders tossed off an idea that sounds nice, but will invest absolutely no political capital to make it happen. That’s why it’s half-assed. There is no intent to make it a priority.
@Kevin_M_Horn If you think she is “tweaking” the system, you don’t know enough about it to have an opinion.
@bmichael Some people like the way childcare hobble women’s career aspirations.
I'm not a parent and plan never to be. So you can trust that when I say that childcare should be a priority, even in front of free college or health care, it's not out of self-interest. I really do think it would be a huge shift for the better for our entire society.
And because it targets young parents and children, I think the ROI on childcare would be higher even than on single payer health care, as much as I support that idea. Women would make more money and families would save more, starting early. That would pay off in the long run.
While the main benefits of Warren’s plan would be more economic stability for families and more independence and equality for women, it would also benefit children. Right now, far too many children are in substandard care situations, and in some cases, injury and death result. https://t.co/kWKQ78bClK
Other candidates, like Bernie Sanders, have offered similar plans, but where Warren stands out is that she is likely to make childcare a priority and to really fight for it. 		After all, she built her career dealing with exactly the kinds of issues this could help solve. https://t.co/b0Qw1MgOL4
https://t.co/ENXlsncd5r Federally subsidized childcare may not rate as a sexy issue in our male-dominated media landscape, but Warren’s plan could be more impactful than marquee ideas like free college or even single payer health care.
Despite all the dudes 'splaining how Sanders is supposedly more likeable than Warren, to be clear, I don’t think he is. I think she beats him. It’s just he will get a number of votes from people who think the only way not to vote based on “identity” is to vote for a white guy.
@RenMoonTwitch Oh, I don't think he's going to be more popular. I think she will. But that he gets any votes at all with her in the race is uncut sexism.
@rockomcneill Don't tell me what to do.
"I would vote for a woman who literally cannot run for president" sure is a great way to sound like you support women without actually having to do it. https://t.co/3HY5FAvfVC
Lots of words for “but he is a man”. https://t.co/zkqnlqPyZP
The only reason to think his shouty old man persona is more appealing than Warren’s is sexism, pure and simple. She sounds like she’s talking with you and he sounds like he’s shouting at you. https://t.co/QU0PMqO4tl
In other words, if we actually took Bernie at his word, and looked at the candidate over "identity", then it's Warren in a walk and he would get zero votes. Maybe that will happen! But I'm not holding my breath.
The fact that Sanders and Warren get mentioned in the same breath by so many shows how much a leg up just being a dude gives you. She's so much better: Sharper, more productive, more accomplished, more capable. But she's a lady, so she has to be far more than twice as good.

Third, most of the audience for this rant also supports mandatory childbirth. They claim it's because they love children, but the eagerness to trash the planet says otherwise. It's all about punishing younger people: For being young, for having sex.
@aquart Again, explain the audience of millions. They can't all have a personality disorder that makes them indifferent to the suffering of younger people.
Second,  the claim that climate change is a problem "30, 50 years" down the road is a lie. Climate change is now. (See: Vortex, polar.) Denialists use numbers like "50 years" in order to bamboozle their selfish, aging audience to think this is their kids' problem, not theirs.
@aquart Most of his listeners do, though, and they are only too happy to inflict climate change on their children as punishment for being young and surviving them.
It's worth watching the rant in full, because he is bristling with rage at young people for supposed ingratitude. You get the real sense that he wants to inflict climate change on younger people as punishment for being younger and being able to outlive him.
First, the "it'll be after you're dead" anyway gambit shows that conservatives don't really believe their claims that climate change is a hoax. Limbaugh's actual message to followers is that they don't have to care, because it's someone else's problem.

@joshdobbin Most people are not criminologists. So they don’t have complex knowledge. They drew a perfectly normal and understandable and conclusion based on a normal knowledge level.
@thefuzzybastard @mattzollerseitz Dig through my timeline. I dare you. Find one instance where I mentioned Smollett before today. Have at it.		I am not trying to cover my own ass. I am pointing out what should be obvious: People who believed Smollett are victims of a hoax, not perpetrators. Don’t be an asshole.
Odds are a hate crime that is reported is real are exponentially higher than it’s not. People just assumed what is usually true was.
My point is simple: We should not hold rape or hate crimes to a higher standard of evidence than other crimes. If someone says they were mugged, we tend to believe them. If they are lying, we tend to be angry at them,  not the people who believed them.
Folks: You are free to dig through my Twitter timeline. What you will find is I never said a word of belief or skepticism about Smollett. I did not rush to judgment. So accusations that I’m trying to cover my own ass are  false.		If you oppose false accusations, don’t make them.
@Coffeeandbeans1 That hoaxes are bad, but they do not mean that real crimes are less real. Also, hoaxes are clearly rare, which is why you cling to one that’s 3 decades old.
@joshdobbin The idea that a gay black man would be attacked by reactionaries is the opposite of surprising, actually. Again, hate crimes are rising, not falling.
@kidd_whitey @Britpoptarts We live in crazy times in which right wing reactionaries are committing all sorts of violence. So it's not really that preoposterous to think it's happened again.
@kidd_whitey @Britpoptarts I would have thought it was preposterous that someone walked into a synagogue and shot it up because they believed racist propaganda. Or would send bombs to Obama, Clinton, CNN, etc. because Trump hates those targets. And yet, that's exactly what happened.
As a reminder, Trump's campaign and election has led to a sharp increase in hate crimes: https://t.co/IqYoeiZJGa It's dishonest to use a single hoax to obscure that fact. So if your concern is honesty, don't do that.
@emersonthor @Tahawus506 @rachbarnhart That isn't actually true. I was skeptical from the get-go, though I stayed out of it because I didn't know the facts. But I also recognize most people don't know what the red flags of a hoax are.They just know, correctly, that the vast majority of hate crimes are real.
@Animallover985 You lost me at the claim that MAGAhats are victims. Nah. You wear racist garb, you can't complain when people think you're racist.
Hoaxes are bad. People who commit hoax crimes should be punished. But the vicitims of hoaxes are innocent. Leave them alone.
https://t.co/ZE6anBecSZ Here's a white man who killed his pregnant wife and blamed a black man for it. Is every person who believed his original story a horrible monster? If not, why are you treating people who believed  Smollett differently?
Here is a famous case of a white woman who killed her children and made up a black perpetrator. https://t.co/RlHXESBR2f Those shaming people who believed Smollett, do you also agree that everyone who believed Susan Smith is a terrible person who should rot in hell? Why not?
As a reminder, redhats trolling for a block: There are plenty of white people who commit crimes and blame black people for it. You do not want to open the door to a narrative where everyone who believed the racist hoax is automatically written off as a co-conspirator.
@Tahawus506 @rachbarnhart Except the vast majority of hate crimes are real. Most people are not criminologists. This is no different than if I told someone, “I was in a horrible car accident but I survived,” and it wasn’t true. You wouldn’t heap shame on that person for believing me. Why shouldn’t they?
@Animallover985 How you think it’s not a denunciation to say he victimized people who believed him.... Someone is acting Trump-like, but it ain’t me.
The people who believed Jussie Smollett deserve our sympathy, not our scorn. They acted out of compassion and concern and with the knowledge that most such crimes are all too real. Their kindness was exploited. They are victims here, not perpetrators.
Co-conspirators. Edit button @jack
But when the hoax is a fake rape or fake hate crime, the victims of the hoax — the people who offered sympathy and comfort — are treated like con-conspirators. 		The reason is so that those people will be scared to help real victims in the future.
When people fake their deaths, commit insurance fraud or murder someone while blaming someone else, we don’t blame the people who believed them. We properly see those people as victims of a hoax.
Hell, sometimes people *fake their own deaths* for fraud or to escape. But when a friend says, “Oh man, my father just died,” you don’t say, “Are you sure? He could be faking.”
Yep. People fake being victim all sorts of crimes and accidents for all sorts of reasons: Sympathy, insurance fraud. But it’s only with hate crimes and rape (which I consider a hate crime) that one hoax supposedly invalidates the vast majority of real crimes. https://t.co/U0XO76tDJw

Worth adding that I’ve publicly complained about lengthy blog entries before recipes, but examine my own sexism, I realized I wasn’t giving women the benefit of the doubt here. Once I did, I realized there was good reasons for it and most don’t actually expect you to read it.
@DrAlecPelwater @BeckyEscalator It does, though. Unless you are crippled by a belief that women should work without compensation.

@ajoykelly @BeckyEscalator Most SAHMs are looking for a side hustle. Many are desperate, in fact. It’s one reason they are the primary victims of multi-level marketing schemes.
@BeckyEscalator I think it starts as an outlet for bored women who want some validation for their skills, which is 100% something they deserve, like all other people. Then they realize there’s serious money to be made. Their SEO skills are top notch.
Dude is blocked, but what a hilarious self-own. Obviously, that dude doesn’t cook, or he would know that like 90% of recipe blogs are run by women.
Yep, you caught me. Clearly my belief that the vast majority of recipe blogs are run by women is rooted in misandry, and not my own observational power. After all, as a woman, I am incapable of things like having observational power. https://t.co/MUgK9syYaa
I think people underestimate how much recipe blogs are a side hustle for housewives trying to make up for lost income.
Because they’re run by women, I think a lot of people overlook that this just might be a clever ploy to make more money, by forcing readers to scroll past more ads. https://t.co/d3zmJbCCrv

The wall is very likely never going to be built. The real problem here might be more serious: The president is using national emergency powers to invalidate a free and fair election.
Trump had two tears with a GOP majority to fund the wall. There was even a bill to do it! But he chose to spend two years golfing and tweeting instead. 		Then Democrats won. The “emergency” that Trump is trying to stop is democracy. https://t.co/uc4DIVnFKJ

Trump’s a honking moron, but even he knows that it takes time to build things. Barring the horror show of him getting re-elected, the end game is still that this national emergency is ended long before any kind of “wall” is built.
@stephgwhiteside It was just a stay, though, so I wouldn’t get too excited.
However, I hold out hope that even with the court as corrupt as it is, this whole wall situation is far too time-consuming to become a reality. There will be many rounds of litigation that will likely drag out for years before they can break ground, and Trump will be out by then.
I think Trump is sadly right that the Supreme Court is far too corrupt at this point to issue a constitutional ruling, instead of just giving him what he wants for partisan reasons. And he’s correct that the Muslim ban proved this.
Trump had two years of a GOP-controlled Congress to "get it done faster." So, nope. This is about something else. https://t.co/ht2bZsyGoD

@CharlesPPierce If we are talking about the 80s. 20 years ago was 1999.
@dimwitdoc Yeah, neither is my taste, but I think she is better/more interesting.
Anyway, since a lot of folks struggle to sense cheek when a woman is talking about the arts, let me be blunt: The Ryan Adams story made me resent the way that mediocre men get raised up in an industry where women who are literal ground breakers don’t get their due.
The real oppressors aren't the men who pushed talented women out of the music industry for decades, folks. The real oppressors are fans who stand up for the right of female genius to be counted, making random men feel kind of oddly defensive.
@DamonLinker Goodness, you are defensive about an opinion you agree is correct! Why so defensive? Is there a reason, since we’ve eliminated “Ryan Adams fanboy” from the list? I can think of one, but not others.
@oligopistos I literally said it wasn’t a zero sum game. Spend more time listening, less ‘splaining. But also, Adams is a hack. At least R. Kelly fans can argue he’s a great musician.
@misanthropemime I saw her stun a room into silence during a Wild Flag solo. It’s actually sad that some men deny themselves the pleasure.
@DamonLinker In this case, it would be true, isn’t it, though? That Brownstein is far better than Adams isn’t an argument with a lot of non-sexist wiggle room for disagreement.
And yes, I can love both women. Or dozens of women! That would. Be the point, now that I have to spell it out: The idea that not only are men necessary, but so much so we have to indulge their abuse so as not to scare them off, is silly and also women are great musicians.
Men who are insisting that there are other, better female guitarists (St. Vincent), I hate to break it to you, but you’re kind of missing the point of the tweet. 😘
@mcmurrayjt She is also great.  Also, they are working together on a new album!
Anyone who thinks rock is dead if Ryan Adams isn’t idolized has wretched taste and no business being a rock critic. 		P.S. the best rock guitarist of the past 2 decades is Carrie Brownstein. If you weren’t too sexist to know that, congrats. Enjoy your unproblematic SK records.
Remember: Trump had two years of a GOP majority to pass a bill to build the wall. As far as I can tell, he barely even tried. He only started really pushing for it after Democrats were elected.

It's depressing, on a personal level, realizing the pathetic, desperate White House plans to "pivot" to abortion. After more than a decade of this work, I'm just so tired of the hate directed at women just for trying to live their lives.
And just as we've seen an uptick in racist terrorism, I imagine the already rising rates of clinic violence will get worse. And I worry, with Trump's encouragement, more men will hurt or even kill women who make reproductive health choices they don't want them to make.
So that sucks: We're going to spending the next few months, and god help us, maybe next two years enduring demagoguery from Trump about how women who aren't virgins are clearly murderers who abort babies just to stick it to men. But maybe the wall will recede into the background.
"National emergency" or no, it's clear from reading the White House tea leaves that his staff realizes the wall is a losing issue and they're desperately looking for something, anything else to pivot to. And they're going with that old standby, abortion. https://t.co/IYV9Uuu3E6
The more Trump tried to sell the wall, the dumber and more pathetic he looked. The national emergency declaration is an effort to save face, but it can't hide the fact that Trump has no idea what the hell he's doing. https://t.co/hZstrDrI6R

I continue not to understand all the right wing procedural dramatics around the wall. Trump really can just say, “It’s already there! We built it last night!” and that would probably satisfy his base.
@askaphysicist That's part of what will delay it. The government will try to seize the land — which in itself takes forever and hopefully bureaucrats can slow walk it even more — the land owners sue, and boom! Trump is out of office while the suit is still playing out.
The good news is that Trump will probably be out of office and the next president will be rescinding the fake national emergency before ground is even broken on the border wall.

@benfinkel It doesn't (read it!), but I will say that I think that's why this kind of thinking is as sad as it is enraging. Men don't realize they are making themselves miserable, both expecting women to perform for them, and then getting angry and feeling manipulated when women do.
@kitty_legal Seriously, I wonder if some men think women just power down when there's no man around to flatter and serve.
@JohnnyNasheo Look, you didn't read the piece and now you're scrambling. I get it. A lot of people read the headlines and assume they know what's in it. But it's a bad look, especially when there's a mansplaining element.
Men, telling a woman she's wrong without bothering to read her argument first is generally obnoxious, but somehow more so when the argument is explicitly feminist. Maybe try not to do that?
@schemaly Hope it is true! I’ve met women who are infertile because the LEEP had to remove so much of their cervix, and that’s even before it turned into cancer. So it’s a bigger problem than many think.
@JohnnyNasheo Read the piece! I actually deal with this objection in there.
So when I hear, for instance, male reporters obsess about how Clinton must only be pretending to like hot sauce to manipulate them, I wonder how much time they're spending on misogynist Reddit under a pseudonym.
Normal behaviors, like wearing make-up and nice clothes, are not viewed as an attempt to put your best foot forward, but as an attempt to trap men with lies about how you "really" look. They generally see all female behavior as something women are doing to manipulate them.
You see it today on some of your grosser internet boards where men gather to get their woman-hating on: The number one accusation against women, over and over, is that they're somehow using deceit to trick men.
My word count was already gettinglong, so I cut this observation out, but I'll add it here: The idea that women are devious phonies is a deeply held misogynist stereotype that goes all the way back to the the story of Adam and Eve. It's how men have always justified patriarchy.
@mmrsofagayshai Or read the piece! I have a lot of interesting thoughts and really tried to get past glibness.
The male-dominated media continues to hold the view that the only “authentic” role for women is as support staff for men — wives, aides, secretaries. So a woman who rejects that and seeks leadership is automatically seen as devious, unnatural, and “inauthentic”. https://t.co/2GsWkkDt03
https://t.co/546qF6N3j2 “Authenticity” is a stupid political test in the first place, but when it’s applied to women, it becomes even more toxic and frankly sexist.  Female politicians will always fail, because ambitious women are inherently seen as “inauthentic”.

@iamprowoman @shannonhmcclain I suspect she doesn't view her child as an "immigrant", but a person she took from an "inferior" culture and will forcibly assimilate.
My community growing up was the front line of the "globalism" that's being demonized now. And I promise you, it was just fine. Better, even. I mean, living on the border with Mexico is probably why I'm a ginormous Cure fan. That alone makes it worth it.
It's not a sexy space, but I do think it's valuable to offer some very basic, kindergarten-level arguments that people can take to their Fox News-viewing people to rebut what is a growing cancer of white nationalism.
One more thought: I realize this thread is very 101, almost laughably so, to a lot of folks. But I also know a lot of white readers have family and maybe friends who watch Fox News and are likely starting to spout white nationalist views.
@chmod777Mark Seriously. Granted, it was the 70s, but my grandfather was able to score a prestigious job at a bank when he retired from the military, despite knowing nothing about banking, because, as someone who grew up in Mexico, he was bilingual and they desperately needed that.
They know kids are assimilation machines. And if your school is multicultural, you will assimilate to that. They worry that they can’t pass on their racism to the next generation. They are, in other words, monsters. Who wants to raise racists?
They’re worried that white kids will grow up around the children of Mexican immigrants or Somali immigrants and realize they’re kids, just like them, and they will grow up not to hate them. They’re worried their kids will have non-white friends and even non-white partners.
In truth, what Ingraham and her white supremacist guests are worried about is not lack of “assimilation”. They’re worried that kids are *too* good at assimilation. They’re worried that white kids will pick up Spanish or start adopting Mexican-American cultural signifiers.
Anyone who is actually around an immigrant community is familiar, in fact, with the way that the kids often are the translators for the adults. Kids often have to help parents fill out forms or talk to government officials who don’t know their native language.
Kids pick up English super fast, due to the fact that kids are built to learn languages. (My ex had the reverse situation — moved to Mexico at age 8,  not knowing a word of Spanish, became fluent pretty swiftly.)
The concerns about “assimilation” are particularly comical. The entire point of being a kid is assimilation. You don’t come out of the womb knowing a language and cultural norms. All kids need to “assimilate” to the environment around them, and are built to do so quickly.
What was the main result of this bilingualism in my community? Well, the Spanish speaking kids had a major advantage in Spanish class. That was irritating. 		Outside of that, nothing.
She fear mongers about the Fox News audience’s white grandchildren going to school with kids "who speak a foreign language”. Well, a huge percentage of kids in my school spoke Spanish. In some cases, they didn’t speak English when they started school.
https://t.co/IG6nezpIBR Now that Laura Ingraham is hosting white nationalists and sharing rhetoric from white nationalist sites, I want to share my experience, once again, growing up in a bicultural, bilingual community.

@AndreaJ152230 @MelissaSpadin What’s the point of sending kids to college if half of them, the girls, are expected to quit working in a few years? Yeah, no, that’s sexist.
There’s no way for female politicians, in particular, to “win” the stupid food tests. Hillary Clinton was asked about hot sauce, which she actually knows a lot about, and was accused of “pandering”.  You don’t know something, you’re a bimbo. You do, and you’re a fake.
@datwyler Government health care doesn't cover child care. And that's why I say "male-centric". All this "socialism" is still built around men assuming when children come, women will leave work to care for them. So it's still patriarchal and assumes women doing free labor.
@Canard_Chroniq *sigh*
@Joelsberg Eventually we can do both. But you can usually only do one thing at a time. This is a discussion about real world politics, not a spitball session at a DSA meeting.
Plus, family leave, even at its most generous, only covers a fraction of child care needs. Frankly, I'd put universal day care at the top of any progressive priority list: Above free college, above single payer health care, above more family leave. It's that important.
It frankly disturbs me how many progressives turn to "family leave" as the solution to the child care issue. It's important — I've written about it  — but universal day care is better. We shouldn't be putting the expectation on women that they leave work to care for children.
https://t.co/3Bg1tzjYmA Important piece. I’ve said it before, but worth saying again: Federally subsidized day care should be a priority way before free college. The Sanders strategy was too male-centric and middle class. This would address the whole of America.

Real Americans know that the only way to travel is to go through a humiliating full body scan with your shoes off for the privilege of sitting with your knees to your chin for 4 hours.
I mean, who doesn’t love flying more than the train? Why have a roomy seat, a short boarding time, the ability to get up whenever you want during the trip, and the ability to show up only about 10 minutes before your departure time? Crazy people, that’s who.
The right wing hysteria over the possibility of replacing a lot of air travel with trains is a very strong tell that they’re just trolls who reject out of hand any and everything that progressives say, without thinking about it.
@LilyBart2 Strongly disagree. I love having TV cameras around, so long as it’s not for like a murder or something. And if small kids ask, just play dumb.
@DrNerdLove Seriously, the sex basement and kitchen are the only tasteful rooms in the house.

@LMplusG They aren’t children. He said one is in high school and one is college. And, you know, most people with children aren’t virgins. That’s how they got those kids.

@QueerEcho Except their argument is that by expressing any outrage about the blackmail, you are a foul person who is complicit in exploitative capitalism who deserves to burn in hell. So if being opposed to blackmail makes you evil, surely buying anything from Amazon makes you doubly so.
Plus, I'm certain 100% of the scolds buy from Amazon on the regular.
Honestly, I wonder how folks get through a work of fiction, movie or TV show. When your view is that someone must be morally perfect or they are completely unsympathetic no matter what, that has to make dealing with any complexity in fiction impossible.
The third would just be: "Neoliberal monarchist shill."
The second would be, "Sure adultery shouldn't be a crime, but are you trying to suggest it's okay to murder hundreds and falsely accuse your brother of a crime?!!!"
The first reply would be someone with a red rose on their name writing, "You are an apologist for the monarchy! What about all the people Cersei has killed?!!!"
Tweeter writes, "Obviously, Queen Cersei is a tyrant who has killed a lot of people. But stripping her naked and marching her through the city to punish her for adultery was wrong. Adultery shouldn't even be a crime. It's a matter for couples to sort out on their own."

I’ll add that this strongly favors Republicans. I’m guessing the skeletons in the closet are even worse for GOP politicians in Virginia. But we won’t ever know, because the left doesn’t have as much well-funded oppo research and journalists don’t have resources.
Zooming out, we can see that as newspapers have fewer resources, and opposition researchers have more, the latter are going to set the media agenda — even when they're lying. We saw this play out in the 2016 election. It's also getting bad on the local level. https://t.co/qPiWVbWWH4

Anyway, interesting article on how this fundamentally right wing ideology of TERFism has managed to become prevalent in feminism in Britain and not in the U.S., where feminism benefits from diversity and largely eschews the kind of "status quo, but with women" faux feminism

I hate to dignify TERFs by even engaging their arguments, but trans people don’t “erase” women. Some of them are women! I’ve spoken to many, many trans people in my life and not one of them has made me feel like I am somehow not a woman or shouldn’t be a woman.
https://t.co/J3dSmTPfVi The harassment of Sarah McBride, who is just a very kind-hearted person, speaks volumes. Whatever incoherent ideology these TERFs cough up is just a Gamergate-style cover for bigotry and harassment.
@morninggloria He’s got feminists’ number. We see a man who posts ridiculous weight-lifting photos and think, “Oh goodness, I am so afraid of that man’s manly manliness!” and not “egads, what is he overcompensating for?"

https://t.co/CFvMlsFO28 The right wing commenters on this piece all denounce liberals for “protecting” Fairfax and Northam, even though the piece, at length, argues for why Democrats need to resign in cases such as these. 		They have their narrative. Facts be damned.
His  insight is that violence and harassment stem ultimately from human impulses and that understanding why people do what they do is the key to countering violent or threatening behavior. Very useful.
While he’s in the news, I hope people do read Gavin de Becker’s “The Gift of Fear”. It’s a far from perfect book, but despite its title, it’s a very good counterpoint to the way too many people think about safety these days. It’s not really about militarized police or guns.
As folks point out, the other thing to remember is that in the exceedingly rare case of women needing hospital care after abortions, showing up at E.R. will get you that care. No one is in any danger of not getting care.
That’s why it’s bonkers that #SCOTUS is even considering upholding the law next year. Whole Woman’s Health from 2016 was decided on the common sense argument that regulations shouldn’t be written in bad faith. 		Imagine if Democrats did that, with, say, coal power plants.
It’s reminiscent of the “literacy tests” to vote in the pre-VRA days. On paper, “you should be literate to vote” sounded reasonable. In practice, the tests given to black voters were literally written so that no person could pass them.
What the Louisiana bill is literally doing is saying, “Okay, you can perform abortions, but only if you meet a standard that we know is impossible to meet.”
That’s the poison pill of these bills. Hospitals don’t give admitting privileges to doctors who don’t admit patients. It’s a very use-it-or-lose-it privilege. But abortion is incredibly safer — safer than wisdom tooth extraction — so abortion doctors have no patients to admit.
Admitting privileges to a hospital sounds good, right? Everyone wants to be able to have the same doctor at the hospital that they have at the clinic, so why shouldn’t that be true of abortion doctors?		The problem, however, is that abortion almost never requires hospitalization.
https://t.co/glNLySGo3s Quick explainer on why the Louisiana law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges is a disingenuous law, meant to sound reasonable on paper but in practice, is meant to be a standard no abortion doctor can meet.

What I got from those words was reassurance that I'm fine the way I am, that I'm not crazy to feel like I'm running on a hamster wheel, and that yes, it's actually sexism. That feeling is relief. It's a gift and we should give it to girls.
My dad is conservative, but in a rare moment of honesty about the world, he  once said to me, "You know, it's not fair, but you'll have to work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously." Reader, those words meant more to me than anything else he ever said. It gave me strength.
But honestly, it's probably better than the alternative, which is telling her that pluck — and working hard or maybe not working hard but working at confidence or maybe leaning in or leaning out or etc etc — will fix it. That the problem is her, not society. That's worse.
I know no one wants to look their daughter in the eye and say, "The problem is that society values you less because of your gender. That's irrational and many people are fighting against it, but the fight is long and you will suffer."
This kind of piece actually contributes to female anxiety. The premise of it is that gender inequality is the result of women somehow not being good enough. We work too hard or not enough, but it always comes back to the idea that women are the problem, not oppression.
We need to stop talking about female performance anxiety as if it's a flaw unique to female brains. It's a reaction to a world that hates women.
The reason women and girls live their lives as bundles of anxiety, who work too hard and fear even the slightest flaw, is we live in a world where any minor flaw is immediately seized as a reason to disqualify us and having leisure time is considered a privilege for men.
Galaxy brain: What if this isn't because girls are wrong, but because they're right? What if they correctly perceive that the standard for women is perfection, whereas men can be mediocre and get ahead? What if, for instance, they just watched the 2016 election? https://t.co/WlMzEtqYQz

@annejumps I don't think that's entirely right, and the article shows why. The 2018 midterm shows that the voters noted and appreciated that Democrats took the high road on #MeToo allegations and that Republicans dug in. And they voted for Democrats.
Some folks think the way to fight this GOP nihilism is to imitate it: When politicians get caught doing something wrong, refuse to resign and rise it out. I disagree.

Yep. Born and raised on the east side of El Paso. Trump would make you think everyone was locked inside, blinds drawn, living in fear of sex traffickers. But it was a perfectly normal city, with kids playing outside all day long. https://t.co/MDM3RxIDfE

Telling white people that their black and Latino neighbors will destroy them, simply by existing, is laying groundwork for eliminationism. Trump is already in the preliminary stages, by using bureaucratic excuses to round people up and throw them out.
https://t.co/GVlFtXLrno This isn’t just racist. This is white nationalist rhetoric, a variation of the “white genocide” claim that white people will be destroyed by living in a multicultural society. 		This rhetoric is inherently eliminationist.

Again, and this is critical: Most crime is committed by non-immigrants. Native born citizens commit more crimes. 		If reducing crime is the goal, kick out the native born people and leave only the immigrants.

There are many privileges white men are fighting frantically to give up, but judging by Twitter chatter today, the god-given right to have the  last word is among the most precious.
https://t.co/GSpRHsWqEL “You don’t need health care, because dying means you get to go to heaven,” is an excellent argument all Republicans should embrace.
@linneaharts I'm not going to get mad at Booker. As a black man, he gets unfairly penalized for acknowledging racism. Until that kind of prejudice is gone, I'm not going to ding black politicians for having to play the game.
@linneaharts Which is my point: We actually do draw reasonable conclusions about intent from behavior all the time. It’s only in these discussions of bigotry where we’re told we can’t use this very normal assessment of evidence.
What is frustrating is that we're told both that intent matters but that we can't know intent, creating a closed loop where we are never allowed to react to bigotry. 		So I thought I'd defend people's right to draw reasonable conclusions about intent based on evidence.
So, whether we like it or not, people are going to be concerned about intent in discussions of bigotry,  because intent shapes how we understand nearly all harm everyone can do. But since intent matters, we cannot deny people the right to draw conclusions about intent.
For instance, if you step on my foot, intent *does* matter. If you did it on accident, I am far likelier to forgive and forget. (And I'd actually be an asshole if I didn't.) If you did it on purpose, then that shapes my response. This is not unreasonable.
I recognize a lot of people prefer the more high-minded response of "intent doesn't matter, only effects do". I have felt the draw of this in the past. But I think it's an argument that won't really work on a lot of people.
@tcalaquilac I appreciate the high-mindedness, but the truth is people do care about intent. For instance, if you step on my toe, I am far likelier to forgive if I believe it was an accident than a deliberate stomp.
@Matthew_Hodson Sure. Bigotry in general. I mention this in the piece, which is why I recommend reading articles and not just reacting to teasers on social media.
Not to constantly harp on this, but “you can’t tell if someone is a racist simply because they act like a racist all the time” is gaslighting.		“Can we ever really know if Trump is a racist” is like asking if we are sure the cat wants food just because she’s begging. https://t.co/cWy4evhQfm
This “but is that person X in their heart” is not a standard we use for any other behavior. When it comes to whether you’re a cat person, a sports fan, or even just grumpy, we assume how you act is what you are. 		Only racists get the “behavior doesn’t indicate belief” treatment. https://t.co/abcQrhnnZJ
https://t.co/q3ljTZZW6w Donald Trump is a racist in his heart. We don’t have to get cute about this, Chuck Todd or anyone else. We can make this determination based on behavior and speech.
@JerradWTF Straws. Grab at them.

“Not vaccinating my children is a personal choice” makes as much sense as saying it’s your “choice” to refuse to feed your children or to send them to school in urine-soiled clothes. Children are not objects, and if you have them, you have to care for them.
Jokes aside, that’s why vaccines are not about “personal choice”. It’s about depriving children of needed medical care and exposing other children, as well as immunodeficient adults, to deadly disease.

These propaganda bills aren’t meant to convince women, who already know that having a baby with the wrong man or at the wrong time isn’t their Only Chance.  It’s meant to perpetuate misogynist stereotypes that women are dumb sluts.

If they fail to provide the documentation showing they have lived a totally flawless life, they should be saddled with a bill for a million dollars to be paid out over 18 years. That's the standard they're holding women to, so it's only fair.
Anyone who says that a birth control failure should be punished with mandatory childbirth should also be prepared to show they have a) never slept in late b) never had a hangover c) never missed a payment d) never got less than an A+ on any test or paper.
Two, this "just use birth control" gambit is disingenuous nonsense, because the same people trying to pass abortion bans are also trying to keep you from getting contraception. That's why they want to shut down Planned Parenthood! They object to all the pregnancies PPFA prevents!
The demand that women have to be perfect 100% of the time is just another form of misogyny. It's saying that for women have to "earn" equality by being perfect, which happens to be a standard no woman can meet. It's a way to deny women's humanity while pretending to be moral.
For one thing, no method of birth control is 100% effective, even if used correctly all the time. And no one really can do that, due to being human. I guarantee 100% of the people shaming her are not the flawless human beings they pretend to be.
A lot of folks under @nona’s brave thread are trying to shame her, claiming that no one needs abortion because of birth control. 		This is false for a number of reasons. https://t.co/ypuhnlJTDX
I say this very sincerely: I really don’t think Howard Schultz is running for president. It’s hard work and running a campaign isn’t like underpaying surly baristas. It’s a gambit to get TV time, and will likely be soon forgotten.

The rejection of rule of law also shows Tucker’s constant invocation of “Western civilization” is just code for white supremacy. The idea that no man is above the law is supposed to be a democratic value, but Tucker rejects it in favor of “people like me are exempt”.
Rule of law is supposed to prevent such inequalities, but Tucker is openly teaching his audience to believe privilege and political loyalties should be a shield.

Law enforcement agencies take the “gosh, it would be nice if we had evidence for our racist urban legend” as an ask to falsify that evidence. Which is doubly scary when you consider what Trump wants: Women duct-taped and kidnapped.
So what did DEA agents do? Well, they decided to create the evidence that was lacking. They called a teenaged drug dealer and talked him into selling where he didn’t sell. https://t.co/r0FodIjHT3 Which isn’t something he regularly did. And this entrapment led to his imprisonment.
This may not seem like a big deal, but George H.W. Bush had a similar need in 1989: He wanted evidence for an urban legend about crack dealing in front of the White House. Unfortunately, there wasn’t any, because again, urban legend.
https://t.co/OrsrsCgRRj Make no mistake: This is the Trump administration leaning on a federal agency to falsify evidence to back a conspiracy theory. They may not be asking overtly, but as that’s the only way the request can be filled, that’s what’s going on here.

Frankly, you're not doing these boys any favors by teaching them to believe there are no consequences for being cruel and bullying. That kind of message can and does poison relationships, often causing, years down the road, wives and children to cut off the bullying man.
https://t.co/8Uh4SDMZZs Watching adults bend over backwards to make excuses for their racism, sexual harassment, and rape jokes is just going to make these already obnoxious boys worse. They just learned the Trump lesson about how “they let you do it”.
And let’s be clear: Post-24 week abortions for medical reasons are often married women who dearly wanted their babies. That’s the level of misogyny on display here: They think even married women should be prepared to pay with their lives for having sex with their husbands.
It’s way past time to stop treating anti-choicers like sympathetic people who mean well. The level of moral monstrosity on display in people whose argument is, “Well, if she wanted to live, she should have kept her legs shut” is beyond all reckoning.
In other words, anti-choicers believe that a woman having sex is so evil, so immoral that the punishment should be expanded to include death or forcing a woman to walk around with a corpse inside her.		Think about that. How much do you hate women that you think that’s okay?
https://t.co/AZESz92SWG Apparently, anti-choicers are in a full blown freakout because New York allows abortions after 24 weeks. What they fail to tell you is only if the fetus is not viable or the woman’s own life is threatened. https://t.co/yGZ7rfypqe

Of course, the supposed heights of civilization that Dreher and Duke long for included widespread illiteracy, slave trading, witch burning, all manner of uncivilized behavior they politely ignore in favor of pretending society is perfect when only white men run it.
This rhetoric isn’t any different than what David Duke rolls out. White supremacists are big on arguing that Great Western Culture was destroyed by racial diversity and gender equality. They just tend to be more explicit in their language, instead of hinting around. https://t.co/oHlciQBAqk
And the victim in this case was a Native American and not another prep schooler, like Christine Blasey Ford, who was harder for privileged legacy media types to dismiss.
I think the full bore propaganda press kicked in on this issue because right wing noise artists knew that mainstream media, which is run by a disproportionate share of white men with privileged backgrounds, has a weakness for accepting excuses for prep school bullying.

@bbdevices Admitting that there's no failsafe and no magic solution Democrats can invoke to fix this situation is too scary. So they fall back on the myth that Democrats somehow have magical powers to fix bad situations that fall outside of their power.
Miller and other racist hardliners have a goal: Making America as white as humanly possible. Deporting DACA recipients gets them closer to goal. A wall, which does nothing to lower immigration rates of any sort, would not. So they will kill any DACA deal.
One reason I suspect Democrats aren’t interested in Trump’s DACA “deal” is that it’s offered in bad faith. It doesn’t matter if Trump shakes on it. The second they leave the room, Stephen Miller will kibosh it. So why waste the breath?

Getting people to hand-wring as "moderates" and claiming the truth-tellers don't understand "nuance" helps further the isolation. It is doing on a mass scale what emotional abusers do when they isolate their victims by telling family and friends she is "crazy".
The mass mobbing of anyone who tells the truth about what happened, calling them "crazy" and insisting their eyes are lying furthers the isolation. The idea is to make people who see the truth clearly feel marginalized and scared. We fight back with solidarity.
The way the isolation works on the national level is by excluding the truth-tellers from positions of power and leaning on the heavily white, male media to advance the narrative that "context" somehow changes the video and the people speaking truth are "hysterical". https://t.co/7LWYKD2X49
And, of course, they are training their sons to be gaslighters, by teaching them it’s okay to simply lie and use your privilege to label the truth-tellers “crazy”. That behavior rarely is restrained to politics. Many will grow up to gaslight wives and children.
So far, all of the right wing responses to this thread have been versions of calling me “crazy”. Which, of course, proves the point, which is they are gaslighters.

Instead, give yourself permission to know what you know. The video shows the boys were being racist jackasses. This is beyond dispute. Anyone who disputes it is trying to gaslight you. Instead of arguing this point, focus on why the gaslighting is happening.
The advice, which I need to take myself, on how to deal with gaslighters in personal life is probably helpful when dealing with the Coventry gaslighting: Let go of trying to “convince” the gaslighter. 		They know they’re lying already, so there’s no amount of facts to sway them.
The same thing is going on with the Covington boys videos. They are quite clearly acting like entitled pigs. But because “everyone knows” white men are “objective” and women and people of color  are “overly sensitive”, we are told our eyes are deceiving us. That is gaslighting.
So you find, for instance, notes written from his mistress, and the conversation becomes about how only crazy paranoid bitches would think “I can’t wait to make love to you again” is evidence of infidelity. The woman loses the fight because “everyone” knows women are crazy.
What the man is doing is relying on social narratives that hold that women are overly emotional, hysterical, etc. to make others doubt her and make her doubt herself.
Most gaslighting relies heavily on bigoted social narratives about whose voices count and who is deemed “hysterical” and “crazy”. The most common kind is men denying a truth a woman knows by saying she’s “crazy” or some form of it.
The mass of conservative commentators claiming that the video of the Kentucky boys doesn’t show what it clearly shows has a name: Gaslighting. 		Good reader on how this form of emotional abuse works in relationships: 		https://t.co/wsjdxekQr8

“Like you never did anything wrong as a kid!” Oh, I did. But I got in trouble for it and was expected to learn why what I did was wrong. 		Nothing of that nature appears to be happening to Racist Boys.
So put a pin in this episode whenever conservatives talk about teaching kids “values” and “responsibility”. Nah, you’re teaching your kids to be assholes and to refuse to apologize for it.
@SachaGilbert The point is that their minor status is giving people cover to demand forgiveness. But children must learn that forgiveness only follows sincere regret and efforts to make up for what you did wrong.
You keep hearing about how giving kids trophies supposedly makes them spoiled and bad.		But I think it’s much more serious to teach kids that they can act like racist jackasses in public and refuse to take responsibility afterwards, and adults will cover for them.
Instead, the boys are not apologizing and, with the adults in their lives, making half-baked excuses for their rancid behavior. 		Is this what we should teach children? Hurt who you want and never apologize and just demand forgiveness without taking responsibility?
If the boys apologized sincerely and accepted responsibility — which means being able to articulate why their  behavior, including being at the march in the first place was wrong — I bet most people would be open to forgiveness.
@annejumps @therealjimteal And let’s be clear: If any of these boys comes to regret his racism and misogyny down the road, and speaks out after a sincere apology, I bet people will forgive. But so far, they are making excuses and evading responsibility, with parental encouragement and help.
“I was once a bigot, but I unlearned it” is...not a good defense of bigotry, much less teaching it to the young. It is an outrage that older people indoctrinate young men to hate women and people of color.
I am unclear what your point is. I’d say this is an argument against teaching young men that racism and sexism are cool. https://t.co/28NNSh9MEW
Stated. Edit button, @jack
This is why intersectionality matters. Racism and misogyny are so intertwined. Young white men are being taught they are superior to everyone else, and that plays out in these various situations.
Giving your son a MAGA hat is the equivalent of telling him you think sexual assault is funny and cool. Why so much pressure to pretend otherwise?

@travellator2 A woman literally got 3 million more votes than Trump in 2016.
Correction corner: I forgot about Julian Castro, which is especially an oversight since I'm also a Texan. But that he fell right out of my head doesn't really speak well to his chances. I like the guy, make no mistake, but I don't see it happening.
To be certain, all these women are strong on all these issues. But the have a range in where they put their focus, and so there’s really a lot of options here. So vote for a woman! No need to vote for a man. They’ve had their turn.
If your main issue is economic progressivism, vote Warren. Gillibrand is strong on women’s rights and demonstrates how to be adaptable in politics. Harris is a good choice if you want someone who is a fighter.
The diversity of women in the race, in terms of resumes and focus, also means there’s no reason to vote for a man.
@EvenBetterIn20 True, and fell right out of my head, which says something about his chances. I like the guy, but it’s not going to happen.
One thing that can be done: If people vow right now to vote only for female candidates, we can push the men out early and get that all-female race that would be dope. It’s what men did to block women out in the past. It can be done.
Plus, it would be entertaining to see the same men who are skeptical about demands for female parity lose their mind if there’s a situation where men are underrepresented on stage.
Harris, Gillibrand, Warren: I love that all the official early contenders are women. I know it won’t happen, but it would be cool if *only* women ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020. We’re so used to seeing male-only races, but a female-only one is still unimaginable.
Agreed! I would hope the Kavanaugh hearing should underline the danger of teaching young men that girls and women are not autonomous humans, but objects put here to serve and bear children, whether they like it or not. https://t.co/pcsVgCq6O8
Last thing: The fact that young men feel ugly behavior from a small group of African-Americans justifies racialized abuse of any person of color in their vicinity does not make them somehow less racist, but more. That’s literally refusing to see people as individuals.
@DeborahDitkows1 In the future, avoid equating the actions of a few randos with what mainstream conservatives who number in millions are teaching young boys.
@DeborahDitkows1 And? The only point in bringing that up is to try to cast these young men as victims. It is a given that we do not issue death threats. The only reason, therefore, to bring it up is to minimize the seriousness of teaching young boys misogyny and racism.
@DeborahDitkows1 That old man was not issuing death threats. Shame on you.
Parents and schools who send boys to anti-choice rallies are literally teaching them that women are second class, and if you have sex with them, they lose all right to say what happens to their body afterwards. Let’s not give into the pressure to pretend this is innocent.
As others note, as well, the MAGA hat is a symbol of one’s commitment to Trumpism, an ideology that holds lying for the sake of bigotry as its main value.

And I’m sure the main anti-choice leaders are pulling faces and disavowing this racism. Don’t buy it. This is not unusual. The racism has always been there. Catholic schools in Kentucky, specifically, are popular as a way for white parents to evade school integration.
The myth that anti-choicers are just well-meaning fetus-lovers was just too strong, I guess. Hopefully, now that there is video, the truth will be better understood: They are vicious reactionaries and raise their children in that ideology.
Their parents thought this racist harassment of pro-choice women was delightful, laughing and cheering the boys on. This is who anti-choicers are, but when I reported it at the time, no one seemed interested.
When I stood outside of the Supreme Court in 2016 watching pro- and anti-choice demonstrators while Whole Women’s Health  was being argued, a bunch of teen boys on the anti side chanted “Build the wall!” at Latina pro-choicers. The antis had come in from Florida, IIRC.

To be clear, I do not pity these women. Mostly, they are selfish and  racist and married their nasty husbands out of a desire for status and wealth, and only lash out when some reporter or other whistleblower tells the truth. Just interesting that they feel the need to lash out.
Republican wives on a rationalization tear, trying to convince themselves they married good men, are always so fascinating. Though none will beat Ginni Thomas trying to make Anita Hill apologize. https://t.co/T77RlKF68M

@gp_wisconsin @Salon Read my article, instead of telling me it’s wrong without reading it. There’s data in there that goes against your point, quite a bit of it. 		And just generally, it helps to know what a woman’s arguments are before telling her she doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
So, she took away his opportunity to feel important and get applause, i.e. what he lives for. And he took away what sounds like a tiring, unfun work obligation. Man, guy drives a hard bargain. Next, he’ll promise she can slap him in return for him buying her a drink. https://t.co/AgLJHNICND
The anti-abortion stance is tied up in the opposition to premarital sex, same-sex marriage, and contraception. It’s about a subculture of Americans who subscribe to deeply sexist religious beliefs.  Everyone else basically  wants to leave women alone. https://t.co/Xv9WsrcaOV
There’s only one group of voters that are “divided” on abortion rights: Republicans, who are split down the middle. But Democrats and independents are strongly pro-choice. https://t.co/TVO17dyqXl
https://t.co/0X9L30c0Sq The media keeps portraying abortion as a “divisive” issue. It’s not. Polling data shows strong majorities of American voters support abortion rights and access.
Trump doesn’t care if half the country dies from his policies. But if he misses a chance to have important people like congressmen applaud for him, he will melt down. Pelosi gets this, which is why this tit-for-tat framing is wrong. She has a weak spot of his, and not vice versa.
That Trump is lashing out at Pelosi in this way is ultimately a good thing. It is evidence that taking away the SOTU is really upsetting to him, which means it’s a leverage point.
@sierracharlie1 He could fire them, so they are worried.
@gorskon I am certain she doesn’t care and also likes knowing that her tactic is doing what it was meant to do: Get under Trump’s skin, and create personal consequences for the shutdown.

I don’t really have a dog in this fight, but I am beginning to think certain folks on the right are trying to hurt unnamed senator by vigorously promoting a rumor about him under the guise of denouncing it.
"Hey, fellow right wing nuts, I’m super worried about this rumor that’s going around about a Trump-loving senator. How can we best kill this rumor?”		“I have an idea! Let’s front page it at Breitbart! That will definitely keep people from hearing this particular rumor!"
It’s like Fox News and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She’s got a lot of charisma, so she has a bright future. But her superstar status owes a lot to the way that conservatives obsess about  her, which draws more people to wonder what she’s got that makes her so scary to the baddies.
What’s funny to me is the longer that Bernie stans grind axes about Beto, the more they send the message that Beto is a real potent threat they are super afraid of. Why else would they obsess so much? Maybe if they laid off him, he might actually go away as they wish.
Trump’s strategy to shield himself from being convicted by the Senate will be the same: Play the victim for the crowds, drive up his poll numbers for GOP voters who are motivated solely by “triggering the libs”, and scaring GOP senators into backing his every move.
Trump doesn’t want House Democrats going after him, but he has, from the beginning, focused mostly on owning McConnell and Senate Republicans by making them afraid of turning against him. That’s why the shutdown is dragging on and has no foreseeable end.
@YAppelbaum First of all, it assumes Trump has any motivation that prevails over his desire for applause and attention. There’s no evidence for this. Perhaps more importantly, it misreads how Trump thinks he wins this, which is by playing to the crowds and leveraging that.
https://t.co/Wh25rp7QXO There’s a lot that’s compelling about @YAppelbaum’s argument for impeachment. But this is just a massive misread of Trump’s views and strategy and likely future actions. https://t.co/LN8UsfpW2X
When you hear a rumor you do not like and do not want other people to hear, the recommended course of action is to simply not repeat it. Not even to condemn others for repeating it. Because people will disregard your condemnation, but hear and likely spread the rumor.
I realize that faux outrage generation is just the only language right wingers know, but it’s kind of odd to spread rumors you claim you don’t want spread simply to accuse Democrats of being the ones spreading them.
@jesseltaylor The best way to keep chatter from spreading, of course, is to repeat the whispers out loud on a public forum and invite retweets.
All of this. What’s funny is how some of the people who hate Trump most still underestimate how malignant and sociopathic he is. He’s not going to stop pushing his luck. It’s not in his nature, which is why he kept tanking businesses. https://t.co/IvIs8ngC95

I hope Beltway journalists don’t choke themselves with all the pearl-clutching over Pelosi’s refusal to play along and pretend there’s nothing alarming about Drunk Uncle Trump’s behavior.
Now Trump is trying to use the same tricks in government that he leaned on in business. They failed him in business and they’re failing even worse in government. 		But his sociopathic narcissism means he wills himself not to see that he’s a big, fat failure.
I don’t think Trump has dementia or is mentally challenged. But he’s also not a smart or talented person, outside of his manipulative talents. He failed at business because he struggled to understand very basic principles, such as maintaining relationships.
Trump spent basically all of his career overleveraged because his costs would far outstrip the money he was taking in, and he would use the fear of default to extract more money from banks and bondholders. 		Now he thinks he can pull the same trick with the wall. https://t.co/io11bUDdTr

This is just misogyny, and it is shameful. Franken chose to resign. He was not forced. He just heard and realized the correct argument that, as he was clearly guilty, there was no point in drawing this out. Pretending otherwise is not just misogyny, but cowardly misogyny. https://t.co/z8mPVUQz5o
And yes, I recognize some of you hide behind conspiracy theories accusing the more than half dozen Franken accusers of being paid liars. This only means you are a coward who can't own up to your own misogyny and instead you defame innocent women. Shameful.
And yes, I expect a bunch of "but but I have a good reason to blame Gillibrand for Franken's choices". No, you don't. You are a misogynist. Your attitude is shameful. You should be ashamed.
If you blame Gillibrand because Franken can't keep his hands to himself like a big boy, then you are a misogynist. This is beyond dispute. I don't care if you donated to NARAL or are a woman yourself. You think women should simply endure male abuse. That's misogyny.

@swampudlian Worth remembering, though, that they didn't really do this with Trump. The bankruptcies and financial info suggests that they way over-lended compared to what his assets actually were, which,  in turn, suggests a throwing good money after bad situation.
So much about Trump Is easier to understand if you remember he literally burned every bridge with nearly every bank, despite his father’s reputation as a successful businessman, because he is such a liar and a cheat that they gave up lending him money.
@scudworx Or, just chill out and admit that I was right. And yes, it’s a sleazy tactic, but a lot of “legitimate” builders do it, at least until they’re cut off, which is literally what happened to Trump.
@LAGoldenrod @askaphysicist Which is why it’s baffling he simply doesn’t declare victory and move on.
@DeborahDitkows1 Oh for sure. Which is why Democrats especially are going to simply do what the banks eventually started to do, which is not give Trump any money in the first place.
@scudworx Literally I said the opposite.
I suspect Congress, both GOP and Dems, realize that slow-walking this thing means even if, god forbid, ground is broken, when Trump is gone, they can stop construction and tear down anything Trump-related. They aren’t a bank and there is no sale on the wall to recoup investment!
I bet Trump, mistaking Congress for a bank, thinks, “Okay, $5 billion now, and then when they realize we’re way underfunded, they will have to cough up the rest or risk losing their initial investment.”		This, of course, is dumb, and shows why he’s bad at business.
Banks stand to lose if a building sits unfinished, because it won’t sell or rent, meaning the builder will have no cash to pay off the loan and will default. So there’s often a tense negotiation where the bank reluctantly lends more to a builder they suspect lowballed them.
It’s a strategy he likely imported from his building days. Builders will lowball their construction costs to banks, making it easier to qualify. Then, when ground is broken and the work is half done, the banks will lend more rather than leave the work incomplete. https://t.co/ZH0xKbU8Jk

There are many legal challenges, even if Virginia ratifies the ERA, to getting it into the constitution. But we should welcome the fight. Republicans need to be forced to publicly explain why they oppose enshrining the idea that women are full citizens, equal to men. https://t.co/CbLsqkqfP9
@browntailedhawk @LOLGOP Read the article! It’s a lot quicker than asking me to rewrite the entire thing on Twitter, and it also helps fund journalism when you click on articles.
The truth of the matter is that the religious right and the Republican party simply oppose equality for women. Everything else is hand-waving. The hostility to the Equal Rights Amendment demonstrates that.
The issue is the religious right. They oppose formal equality for women and fear that the ERA will protect LGBTQ rights. But they hide behind “abortion”, even thought abortion rights were decided even without the ERA. It’s just their catch-all scare word to demonize equality. https://t.co/RczEk4v1bT

@Fahrenthold It’s telling how Trump thinks it’s the most selfless possible act that we should all be slobberingly grateful for that he spend a couple hundred bucks on burgers. And honestly, I fully expect to find out that someone else actually paid for it.
https://t.co/vUlyU2KisH Trump lying about how many hamburgers he bought is in the same vein of all the fake charity he pretended to give that @Fahrenthold has discovered.		Trump gets a real kick out of pretending to be generous, while not actually being generous in the slightest.
@chicagomom No,  that implies he has an honest bone in his body. Which he doesn’t. He loves lying, like he loves cheating, on wives and on anyone who does business with him. He loves getting one over on people.
But noooooooo, Mr. Lies About Everything is drawing a line in the sand. The one time he cannot lie is if the lie actually helps anyone but himself. 		He really does operate by figuring out what the right thing to do is, and doing whatever the opposite is. Every single time.
By which I mean, Trump could make this shutdown go away by simply deciding to lie about it to his followers. He could just say, “The Democrats gave me wall money and it’s being built.” And his followers would believe him, as they always do.
It really is remarkable how Trump is completely void of a single redeeming value. He lies, effortlessly, about everything. But now we’re in a situation, where the first time and the likely the last time ever, it would just be better that he lies. And he refuses to do it.
It’s hard to gin up much interest to watch William Barr bullshit his way through this hearing. I can’t imagine his words have any value, any more than whatever other empty rhetoric the rest of the pack of Trump appointees has coughed up.

@CRlos71946939 @ThePlumLineGS Why I recommend reading articles before commenting on them. Not only does it help keep journalism alive to actually click, but there's only so much information you can cram in a headline.
The only thing that would prevent that, I'd hope, is that stasis is simply not possible here. Every day the shutdown drags on, the reverberations get worse. Airport lines are bad. Airports shutting down, however, is another story, and feels like it's inevitable if this drags on.
I worry that's what McConnell is banking on now: That there are only so many horror stories about long airport lines or federal employees losing their insulin before audiences stop tuning in.
One more thought not in the piece: McConnell learned from the Merrick Garland thing that by holding still, never changing your position, the media will run out of new things to say and will move on. They almost have to, or they'll lose audience and therefore money.

But what they’re actually saying is, “I don’t want a service I believe mostly benefits old white people to be extended to younger people, who are more racially diverse. Because then you might be sitting in my doctor’s waiting room and that scares me.”
On its surface, for instance, it makes no goddamn sense to say that it’s somehow going to hurt Medicare to let the rest of the country buy into Medicare.
One other thought: As a general rule, a lot of incoherent right wing arguments make way more sense if you consider that the person making it may be a racist, and they’re trying to argue against sharing public resources with people of color without coming out and saying so.
Well, I was right, y’all. And since my new year resolution, inspired by AOC, is to shuck off the false humility expected of women, I’m going to go ahead and say it. I warned everyone! Oh well.
But I was basing my argument on growing up hearing white people constantly bitch about how many “Mexicans” were using the hospital or government services. Which wasn’t out of proportion, since, you know, most of the city was Latino.
I got so much pushback, y’all. I was told I was paranoid and reading too much into, say, anti-ACA ads that threatened long lines at ERs with photos of racially diverse crowds waiting in lines.
These are folks, I argued, that will cut off their nose to spite their face. They would live in a mud pile so long as they felt people of color were living in a shit pile. They would give up affordable health care just to make sure people of color didn’t get it.
My argument was simple: Conservatives were hyper-focused on the possibility that Obamacare was going to make health care access easier for people of color to get. And they were freaked out about the idea that hospitals and their doctor’s office might become racially integrated.

One reason that so many white Americans keep voting for Republicans is they know, on some level, that Democrats will swoop in and save them once Republicans muck it up badly enough. Until that calculus ends, things will keep getting worse.
This shutdown sucks hard, but I am glad to see Democrats holding firm. They cannot reward hostage-taking. And they need to stop saving Republicans from the political consequences of their own choices. It’s the only way to save us in the long run.
@SophieInCT @tomwatson @CharlesPPierce @NydiaVelazquez It is true that, a week into office, AOC has not passed major legislation. Which....okay, if that bothers you, but that's a little like telling a 3-month-old pregnant woman to give birth already.

@tweet1hz Because they assume the Democrats are trying to “save face”. No, the Democrats know the wall cannot happen and are trying to shut this down.
Perhaps what is needed is a national campaign of artists who will pledge, if the wall is built, to cover it in graffiti depicting Trump in unflattering poses. We need to organize a drive of people mocking up pictures of what they plan to paint on it, and we can send it to Trump.

https://t.co/Fvi4X3voyl Either way, read my analysis last night. I happen to know a lot of people who are the kind of people who voted for Trump but might not be persuaded about the wall. And I think it’s worrisome that such people got a “both sides” narrative and not facts.
@PaulWartenberg Well, most “independents” are partisans in their voting behavior. So this won’t impact their votes. However, I believe “independent” typical Republicans could be persuaded to think the wall is dumb or scared into supporting it. And that matters.
14% of Republicans currently oppose the wall. I suspect, if the issue became less a marker of partisan identity, that number would rise. https://t.co/xYWpniqJuc That’s why the speech’s reception matters. If these people are successfully scared, Trump can dig his heels in longer. https://t.co/GStvOf4YYz
To be extra clear, I don’t think that we can persuade people who typically vote Republican to vote for a Democratic candidate in 2020. But there are other considerations, especially right now. One issue is whether disengaged, typically more moderate Republicans support the wall.
I kind of feel guilty, because I was one of the earliest out of the gate writing  pieces about how already committed base voters will never, ever change. But that analysis doesn’t take into account the huge number of Americans who are mostly disengaged and persuadable.
Yes, yes, yes, the base will believe anything Trump says. But there are still, hard as it may be to believe, some people who aren’t “base” but also not fully anti-Trump. I can easily see disengaged white people watching that speech and concluding, holy shit we’re being attacked.

The border wall reminds me of the Iraq War in many regards, but one is the blithe way that too many pundits and leaders talk about it as if it's actually a manageable project, when it's absolutely not. The ridiculousness of this fantasy needs to be emphasize more.
Honestly, I think Trump shut down the government just because he thought it was a dramatic plot twist in his reality TV show, and it didn't occur to him that it might actually have political fallout. Now he's scrambling.
Here's a part of the border I used to visit on occasion when I was a kid. It's called Santa Elena Canyon, and it's in the Big Bend National Park. Where does that self-identified genius Trump think his stupid wall is going to go? https://t.co/KipFP544Ja
And I am very specific in saying they *don’t* have the ransom, because that’s what’s going on here. A border wall isn’t just evil, but undoable. Conservatives can swoon about the Berlin Wall, which they used to hate, but it wasn’t built along a goddamn canyon.

https://t.co/cSXHbllmXT Ah, there’s something just deliciously funny about a dude threatening defamation lawsuits when all his potential targets know full well he doesn’t have the guts to actually show up to testify in court.
@johnlk_80 So, for instance, it's always illegal to punch someone in the face, unless they affirmatively consent (boxing). We do not have laws that say "it's okay to punch people, unless those people are unconscious or say no". We say, "you cannot punch people without affirmative consent".
@johnlk_80 Yes. See this tweet from this thread: https://t.co/yxzpjGIonU But if you need it restated, it simplifies things, for police and juries, if we simply expect "yes" from all partners, instead of elaborate carveouts required because the initial law has a massive, obvious flaw.
Also, affirmative consent standards make it harder on predators like Trump, who, by his own admission, springs the assault on unsuspecting women and then only back of (maybe) once he's been told no. Consent before touching removes the ambiguity that Trump types exploit.
Instead of creating elaborate, complicated carveouts that need to be argued in court about why this particular absence of a no is different from that, let's simplify things: Sex only with people who want to sex you back. Anything else is rape.
The case also shows why affirmative consent — which means you need the presence of a "yes" instead of merely the absence of a "no" — needs to be the standard. Obviously,  a woman in a vegetative state can't say no, so "she didn't say no" isn't enough.
Hey folks, unless the woman who gave birth after being in a vegetative state for 14 years had a 15-year-long pregnancy, we can safely drop the “allegedly” as a modifier to “assault”.
The good news is Trump doesn’t have a national trauma like 9/11 to exploit. The bad news is he and his team are likely going to figure that out soon, if they haven’t already, and start feeling that’s what they *need*.
If you remember it, too, you should be deeply, deeply worried about network executives rolling over for Trump and saying, “Sure, have our airwaves to lie to the public."
I remember the early aughts and how Bush Jr. hijacked the news media and turned it into a propaganda stream for a constant drumbeat of lies scaring Americans into believing Saddam Hussein was minutes away from hitting us with WMDs.

@freetimeectomy @jaredlholt Am I? The sentence clearly says “this guy who messaged @jaredlholt”.
Professional writers, I think, do two things more than most people: Cook and listen to music. Our jobs are conducive to it. So we overestimate how popular both those activities are to the general population.
So, hard as it may be for music heads to believe, a ton of people simply haven’t heard many R. Kelly songs, especially in recent years. So they either saw the documentary or heard about it, and were curious what all the fuss was about. So I’m not surprised.
I think I know why this happened, and it’s more innocent than it seems. 		Background: Most people watch way, way more TV than they listen to music. The audience for even low-rated shows is higher than what most popular music acts sell. https://t.co/56pdmDqzbg

Yep. At a certain point, it becomes easier to list the things about Trump that aren't fake: His racism and his narcissism. That's it. Everything else is a fraud. https://t.co/N1pBVl2k6N
And we shouldn't be dismissive of the power of this. Trump lies as easily as he breathes. Clinton is a fundamentally honest person. But her gender made her "wrong" in people's eyes, so they ended up believing, bizarrely, that she was somehow the corrupt one.
The impulse to frame a habitual liar and total fraud like Trump as "authentic" and a perfectly normal person like Ocasio-Cortez as "phony" stems from pure racism and sexism. It's a way to express the belief that only white men are legitimate leaders. https://t.co/NCuMKggnww

To be clear, Fox News grandpa will probably kick and scream and declare you’re lying when you tell the truth. But a small fraction of people really are confused. And the rest are going to have a harder time gulping down lies if you keep pressing, politely but firmly, the truth.
A simple way to explain it to your Fox grandpa: Say the 70% tax rate kicks in at one million dollars, and it’s 30% before that. You make one million and one dollar. Only the one dollar is taxed at 70%. The rest is taxed at 30%.

I can’t believe AOC managed to hijack the media obsession with gossip and drama to force a discussion of how high marginal tax rates work. I hope it never stops, or at least keeps going until everyone gets that the 70% would only be on what you make after $10 million.

Not that it is worth arguing this point, I realize. If Ocasio-Cortez said she was "from" Yorktown, they'd also be flipping out, calling her a liar, and making hay out of how she was born in the Bronx and is trying to hide that.
Hoft is both stupid and a really aggressive liar. AOC *represents* the Bronx as a congresswoman and just moved to D.C. from her apartment in the Bronx. Where she was born.

At the end, this argument boils down to, “Unless all white liberals shred all remaining vestiges of personal prejudice, then widespread, overt white nationalism must be the law of the land.” But it doesn’t answer why, or why the opinions of people of color don’t matter.
That some white liberals need to be better simply doesn’t justify destroying the environment to build a massive eyesore that serves mainly as a symbolic monument to racism.
It’s a silly distraction. Do wealthy white liberal hypocrites exist? Sure, but they aren’t the majority of Democrats, who have a multi-racial coalition. More to the point, white people who wall themselves off from others  in the suburbs tend to vote more Republican.

https://t.co/5oihpkPsSE This is about right, and we should stop giving into the myth that there is anything particularly radical about this. It should be treated as mainstream liberal thought.
@beyerstein @imillhiser @LemieuxLGM What’s amazing is that while Harry Potter is a children’s book, it’s a lot more adult in its understanding of the world than some Jacobin folks live in. She both satirizes ineffectual technocratic bureaucracies but also realizes that we need them to maintain Democratic programs.
@imillhiser @beyerstein @LemieuxLGM The funniest part of this is that the bureaucrats in Harry Potter are often bumbling idiots. Which he'd know, if he bothered to read the books.
@beyerstein @imillhiser @LemieuxLGM Fantasy is just a genre. The magical metaphors can go in any direction. Rowling is using it to explore the concept of power and by and large, the conclusion is that struggling to maintain justice in the face of power is a never-ending battle.
@beyerstein @imillhiser @LemieuxLGM And put his thumb on the scale by picking a children's book that he (wrongly) assumed he didn't need to read to understand. But Charlotte's Web is also a children's book with fantasy elements.
@imillhiser @beyerstein @LemieuxLGM Yeah, he's confusing magic with white male privilege. 😜

@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM The one other point I'd add is the books are not "generic". That's why they're beloved. They upended the fantasy status quo, which was conservative and assumed the rightness of hierarchical systems, i.e. LotR and the "good king" problem. Rowling rejects this on all levels.
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM There entire end game of the books is a long examination of the question of why it's not enough to have magic, and in fact how knowledge and the power it brings (think Elon Musk) can blind people to deeper truths about love, death, and our moral obligation to each other.
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM No. That's the point. The wizards are still human with human foibles and problems. Literally, the whole point of the books is that magic cannot solve all problems. It's explicitly stated at times. If he read the books he was shaming people for enjoying, he would know that.
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM The technocratic bureaucracy in the books, the Ministry of Magic, is a multi-book satire of the some the drawbacks of the technocratic approach. The Ministry is quietly taken by Voldemort because they are ill-equipped to understand the moral seriousness of his threat.
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM So why does he need to misrepresent the books, and in fact I'd argue openly lie about their contents? This paragraph in particular is the opposite of what the books actually contain. In the actual books, wizards often have poverty, mental illness, homelessness, and hunger. https://t.co/0Tx940v800
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM I also have to point out that going after a children’s book is putting the thumb on the scale. Why not attack Rushdie or Morrison, who have fantasy elements in their high literature?
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM So, I can say, “Trump reminds me of Voldemort” and 99% of people will know I mean hugely egotistical and cruel, not that I think Trump is a dark wizard with magic powers.
@beyerstein @LemieuxLGM I haven’t actually seen anyone in their Harry Potter analogies suggest we should use magic to solve the problem. There is a whiff of moral panic here and an unwillingness to accept that most people have critical faculties to distinguish fictional elements from themes.

Perhaps someone should let Trump buy one of these golf courses. Once it’s his property on the line, he won’t want to destroy the area by putting a wall through it.

There's a lot I like in this bill, which is the first Democrats are putting on the floor, but perhaps the biggest change would be making voter registration opt-out instead of opt-in.

I suppose if Rashida Tlaib didn’t want to offend conservative sensibilities, she shouldn’t have called Trump a “motherfucker”. 		She should have instead said she would grab him “by the pussy”.

And yes, Trump is a clown. But Putin does have something to gain by having the U.S. president back his conspiracy theories and reject decades worth of opposition to Soviet oppression. Both on an international stage and for propaganda purposes at home.
And let’s not forget this:		https://t.co/DqyNFQMfeN 		It could be the pee tape is real. Or Trump just really wants to please his man Putin. Or the Russians have some kind of financial leverage. But where this is coming from isn’t mysterious.
And, as Chait himself notes, this comes right as Russia is about to declare they were always right to invade Afghanistan. 		And Trump has already been caught trying to backchannel with Putin:		https://t.co/zEeJ7VfhRj
Again, as @maddow pointed out last night, Trump has a long habit of parroting downright obscure talking points that come straight from Putin, often referencing countries he probably didn’t even know existed.
https://t.co/87O5NXrvcw I don’t know why there’s still so much unwillingness to even accept the possibility that Trump is simply working for Putin. 		On the contrary, I’d say it’s the only explanation that really makes sense. https://t.co/iMELtSvlty
Another part of it is racist, trying to make hay out of how AOC used one last name as a kid and two as an adult. But I'd point out a lot of schools make it hard for kids with Spanish last names to use the two-name tradition. So it's common to see people switch back and forth.

I don’t like hearing politicians talk down to journalists as a rule, to be clear. But we journalists should also not be lily-livered cowards, begging everyone to give bullies like Trump what he wants.

The whole “you let women in, and art/literature/science is OVER” thing instantly marks someone who has no knowledge of any of these areas, all of which depended heavily on women’s work for advancement.

And frankly, the GOP’s commitment to advancing white men above others shows. There are some real duds on the GOP side of the fence, white men who are not very bright or talented but coasted on promotions offered them largely because of their identities.
Failure to understand this leads to the unfortunate and untrue implication that white male dominance is somehow natural, and diversity alone requires active decision-making. But both modes are the result of deliberate choices.
The white maleness of the GOP is just as deliberate a choice, and just as much a reflection of the priorities and desires of their voters and leaders. They don’t need special white male recruitment programs, because the whole party is a white male recruitment program.
I’m seeing a lot of journalists correctly point out that the diversity of the Democratic side is a deliberate choice made by voters and party leaders. But all too often, the lack of diversity on the GOP side is written off as due to a lack of effort. This is false.

"There is simply no excuse for treating anyone as anything but full equals.” edit button @jack
@dancingdog27 Access is an especially weird argument when Trump broadcasts his dumb meetings on TV.
A better response: “I am sorry that women were disrespected and harassed. Going forward, we will strive to make sure women are given the same respect as the men in our community. There is simply no excuse for treating as anything but full equals.”
It also ends up, intentionally or not, implying that men who adjust behavior aren’t doing so because it’s the right thing to do, but because they are tip-toeing around the fragile feelings of inferior females. Which, in turn, implies it’s a shame to have them around at all.
Women’s feelings are typically not only understood as not objective, but in fact *opposed* to objectivity, rooted in a supposed tendency of women to overreact. It’s a way to condescend to women, to root the disrespect in their “feelings” instead of the man’s actions.
https://t.co/BvyxPX0kg2 I would like to ask men to stop using terms like “women felt disrespected” and generally framing this around women’s feelings. You may mean well, but you’re leaving the door open to the “they’re just oversensitive hysterics” interpretation.
Euphemisms like “inaccurate” or “misleading” confuse readers. By using the accurate term “lie”, you help readers understand why Pelosi and Schumer have no interest in Trump’s arguments. Giving into overt lies is bad business.
https://t.co/1HocJ56nmS This article is mostly good, but man, they are running out of euphemisms for “Trump lied”. Just say it. Why the elaborate dance to politely avoid the word?
Following a dumbass like Trump helps reassure the often mediocre authoritarians: They do not need talent or smarts. Their race, gender, social standing, and adherence to the ideology assures their place.
I would argue that is the point. What is fascinating about hierarchical thinking is that the value of the leader is irrelevant. What matters strictly is their position. Which is why women are expected to play dumb, to flatter male “superiors”. https://t.co/4PfpZ0Wcoh
To be fair, we have some of this on our own side, as demonstrated by the angry responses I got from a few men when I pointed out that Warren is smarter and more effective than Sanders. It may be true, but it ruffles the sense of hierarchy.
After giving Trump a thorough tongue bath, for instance, I bet Whittaker lashes out at service workers for saying “sir” 9 times instead of 10. And , of course, women are expected to be demure and swiftly meet needs without even having to ask what the needs are.
What’s continually fascinating about authoritarians is how theatrical their sense of hierarchy is. These men grovel and bootlick Trump with enthusiasm, and then turn around and expect women, people of color, anyone perceived as beneath them to bow and scrap. https://t.co/oMyT6oQt3A

@Jankowski60 I'm glad YOU know, but not everyone is you. And it was a real question whether or not the larger public would be hoodwinked. So while it's great to pat yourself on the back, it's not really the issue here.
I understand the impulse to cynicism, and the desire to believe nothing we could ever do would work so why even try. But I think it's okay, going into 2019, to value hope. Trump is not some invincible force who only grows stronger with every attack. Hope is not lost.
More importantly, Trump clearly wanted to bring more people on board with his disinformation campaign. So it's good that it's not only failing, but seems to be backfiring, with more people gleaning onto the fact that he's actively trying to deceive them.
Truth told, most of Trump's supporters probably don't believe most of his lies. They "believe" the lies, which is to say they agree to lie along with him, as a show of loyalty.
Also, I think it's not helpful to set the goalposts at "unless his avid supporters turn on him, it doesn't matter". Yes, it matters quite a bit that most Americans see the reality here. Trump voters aren't the only people who count.
@4kwiknus He's the president. I'd love to ignore him, but that's like trying to ignore a car that crashed into your living room, in hopes it goes away.
@Critical1977 But the point is that he continues not to be able to convert more people into followers. Most Americans see him as a liar. That's a win.
@Jankowski60 Uhhhhhhh, and yet nothing you said had anything whatsoever to do with my points.
More on the topic of Trump's lying, and why it needs to be framed, correctly, as a deliberate disinformation campaign. https://t.co/tocVofpTRp
That said, it continues to be critical that journalists focus on the debunk, not the lie. Don't run headlines that say "Trump Says X". Run headlines that say "Trump Lies About X Again".
So maybe more research is needed about the role of credibility in whether people believe lies. But nice to know that, contrary to predictions otherwise, journalists are not failing when they debunk Trump's lies.
If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say the repeated debunking of Trump's lies is reinforcing a larger idea in the public's head: That Trump is a chronic liar. (Which is true.) And his lack of credibility is making it harder for him to get his lies to stick.
The reason people tell you not to even debunk Trump's lies is there's research showing repetition, even in service of debunking, reinforces a lie. https://t.co/N27vpNEG8i But that research focuses on the claim itself, not the person making it.
You see a lot of people claiming that it's dangerous to repeat Trump's lies, even to debunk them, out of fear that even debunking them helps them spread. But this article suggests the opposite: That the repeated debunking is helping instill the correct idea that Trump is a liar. https://t.co/MFXRzDsCPq

@estarianne @salemp Which would include critical vetting of Sanders.
Easy to see the strategy here: Federal employees doing things like pollution regulation or enforcing civil rights laws, worried about making rent, take jobs at non-profits or the private sector. Then Trump appointees drag their feet on refilling the position. Diabolical, really.
https://t.co/cUz97qRAZX Republicans really do see a shutdown as a good in itself, as a backdoor way to gut federal agencies they don’t like. So no surprise they’re exploiting this situation to get federal employees to give up and take jobs elsewhere.
@estarianne And frankly, a major reason I put Sanders at the bottom of the list of candidates is I don’t think he has any whipping skills at all. If you want to whip Dems, a good starting place is to join the team, instead of acting like they’re beneath you.
@estarianne Let’s entertain the possibility that this is true, though I think overstated. While the president can play a role, a) they simply need to wish to do so, which is true of all contenders and b) whipping is still more up to congressional leadership. So worry about that.
The best way to demonstrate that you aren’t in a cult of personality, then, is to act like it.
Like both want Medicare-for-All. Both will sign any bill with that name. What’s in it depends on Congress. But supposedly smart people don’t seem to get that. Obama wanted a public option. He didn’t take it out, dummies.
The most annoying part of watching the continued Beto paranoia of the Bros is the failure of supposedly smart people to realize Sanders and O’Rourke and any Democrat, really, will sign any climate or economic policy bill a Democratic Congress gives them.

Deleting that tweet because as funny as it is, it’s also hard to watch. Still: Racoons. Avoid them.
But after #MeToo, it’s become extraordinarily hard to pretend the conflicts over sexual abuse and harassment are due to female overreaction, instead of male entitlement and cruelty. That’s a huge victory. Even NRO can’t play that game anymore. So toast yourself, #MeTooers.
Same magazine, after all, that published John Derbyshire’s mistaken interpretation of Lolita as an ode to statutory rape, complete with his insinuation that feminists are just jealous because women lose all their looks by the time they’re old enough to vote.

If you want women to be more open, nicer, and more curious about accepting that date or flirting, then you should support a system where men are swiftly punished for abusing women's kindness.
Hell, just having a man ask directions is fraught. A few months ago, I conceded to a man insisting that I give him directions on the subway. My reward for my kindness? He followed me for multiple stops, until I stood right in the middle of a crowd of men and scared him off.
Men complain women won't look at dating app requests or respond warmly when spoken to in public. But we know from experience that doing either leads to dick pics, being followed, or otherwise being harassed.  So we're cold and forbidding, because it's the only way to be safe.
Women would be more open to accepting dates, talking to strangers, flirting, and yes, casual sex, if they were assured they could be safe. The reason we're careful, however, is a lot of men just take even the slightest kindness as permission to treat you like shit.
The one other thing I'll add is that conservative claims  to the contrary, coddling stalking, harassment and abuse actually makes dating harder for everyone. Why? Because it means women are constantly on guard.
@darwin_moduel @KatTimpf They understand it. They just pretend not to, in order to excuse male abuse and violence.
@VanDommelin Yes, they can. They just pretend not to, in order to justify being creeps.
While @KatTimpf might see stalking as merely romantic awkwardness, it is in fact a very serious issue. Stalkers feel entitled to a woman's attention, and when they don't get it, they often escalate to violence. https://t.co/Ux8gFZ0Wd7

But I always liked it a bit better than the Anglo tradition of caroling. It's more explicit about the roots of the tradition, which is meant to celebrate hospitality and the importance of being good to others in need.
I mean, I make it sound grim. It's not. It's basically the Mexican version of caroling, where you go to people's houses and sing songs asking to come in until one predetermined house lets you in. And then you eat and drink a bunch.
I keep thinking about how, as that little boy was dying in New Mexico on Christmas Eve, people in the area would have been participating in Las Posadas, a tradition that is literally about people seeking shelter and hospitality, instead of being left out in the desert.

I don't have an IQ test I can give Trump, but seriously, the man is probably about average intelligence, and not as dumb as he pretends to be. Funny how many "smart" people seem to think that the alternative to "dumb" is "genius", when "average intelligence" is also an option.
@candycat357 It's fascinating how many people cannot grasp there is space between "supergenius" and "complete idiot". Saying Trump isn't as stupid as he pretends to be doesn't mean he's a genius. A person of average intelligence can also play dumb.
Playing dumb is a *classic* strategy to evade responsibility. The more innocent form is a man pretending he doesn't know how to clean dishes so his wife will. With Trump, it allows him to buddy up with dictators and commit evil, while pretending he's too dumb to know better.
Trump's not a SUPERGENIUS, but nor is he the doddering fool with a vocabulary of 200 words that he pretends to be in front of reporters and especially his own followers. That act is useful for distracting from the real issue, which is Trump is sociopathically evil.
It continues to be fascinating how many liberals — mostly men, almost exclusively white — are insistent that Trump's main problem is he is stupid and will reject any evidence to the contrary. I understand the urge, but the problem is, the "dumbass" narrative benefits him.
@wellsbe May be! Point still stands. His need for constant adoration would have also led to the faking it situation.
That this is even a question is disturbing. Of course it is. https://t.co/EcdtcNJh7v
But when Trump lets his guard down, as he did with a child, we see that his vocabulary is bigger than he lets on. (Fred Trump paid for a lot of education!) His dumbass behavior is an act. The sociopathic behavior, however, is all him.
The funniest part about Trump’s “marginal” comment re: Santa is that “marginal” is a word he would never use when speaking to his adult supporters. With them, he talks in small, simple language, which is why a lot of people think he’s a simpleton or demented.
@RotoValue Mostly, it's irrelevant. The fact that someone as accomplished and sharp as Hogg has a middling SAT score mostly serves to prove that the SAT score is a strongly flawed measure of intelligence and aptitude.

@williams1977 Sorry, hard to tell on Twitter. I would agree and argue that conservatives are spreading the myth that only SATs matter because that's all they want to matter. SATs favor the privileged more than they measure merit.
@parabasis @Adansonians For sure. As I said, my preference is for Gillibrand, Warren, or Brown. Or Abrams, if she would run, since she is a rock star on all levels. But I flat out don't think the Sanders stans are going hard for Beto because of his voting record. I think it's deck-clearing.
@williams1977 If you're criticizing me, I recommend reading the article. I very firmly argue both that schools do take more into consideration and that they should. :)
I don't know all the deets, but Gonzalez matriculated at New College, which is a progressive school that eschews grades altogether. Worth remembering most kids had their college applications in before the shooting. If Gonzalez wanted to go to Harvard, I bet they'd have her. https://t.co/Ynj543pjqv
https://t.co/1ACuyRyQqz Anyway, I think it's useful to compare David Hogg to Abigail Fisher, another student with middling grades that didn't get into an elite school. Fisher didn't deserve to get in, but Hogg did. Because life and school are about more than grades.
The right likes to demonize holistic admissions as "reverse racism". But, as David Hogg shows, white kids also benefit — often especially so. Not everyone is good at taking standardized tests, but that doesn't mean you're not smart. (I say this as someone who is good at tests.) https://t.co/rO2cj7hg9b
Hogg is a white guy, of course, but his case shows why holistic standards are better than simply taking the kids with the best test scores. A lot of kids who aren’t good at tests are still bright and capable and have a lot of potential. https://t.co/kXd7cMXk5j
Because of hostility towards racial diversity, conservatives have turned against holistic admissions standards (which help black and Latino students) and instead argue that admissions should be based only on “objective” measures like SAT scores.
https://t.co/1ACuyRyQqz David Hogg’s admission to Harvard is not only deserved, but a good example of why right wing arguments against holistic admissions are wrong.
@MoreSocialism I didn't say sexist. I said jealous of the hot dude. But your swift defensiveness around the sexism issue is....interesting.
Anyway, some other good points. Again, there’s candidates I would rather see — all women, except Sherrod Brown — but if Beto is it, don’t believe the well-poisoners.

@andrewryanpayne I'm saying that Bernie stans know in their heart that their guy's voting base wasn't attracted to "substantive issues", but just liked the charismatic white guy who claimed outsider status. Now there's a new guy who is holding down that spot, and they are bitter. Not hard!

For a decade now, I’ve been arguing that the right’s “sexual morality” isn’t about actual chastity, but a cover to abuse women and LGBT people. Then they went ahead and proved it by electing a straight guy who has as much sex as he wants, while punishing everyone else for it.
https://t.co/8gGTCMO0LX Donald “Fucks Porn Stars” Trump is violating court orders so that his administration can tell young people to eschew contraception in favor of abstinence.
But there is this passage that actually makes an interesting and provocative argument about, while he doesn't use the word, fascist politics. And that is an important message and I hope people pay attention to it. https://t.co/YIGgbtoFwl
One more thought and I'll move on. This op-ed appears to be the source of the latest round of well-poisoning efforts against Beto.  https://t.co/vIM2f1ypzX Which is frankly weird, as there's nothing objectionable about it. He's right and it's not particularly provocative.
@ShermanPXavier I don't really consider them a "left flank". That assumes that "left" has a set meaning, and it's for expansive social spending. But there are other issues where they're to the right (feminism, anti-racism) and issues they actually ignore (real socialism).
@PenguinGigantic She would have won a fair race. But it was stolen, blatantly.		And love this phrase: "ess fetishizing nonwhite candidates". Your slip is showing.
@ShermanPXavier Because they lost last time. Think about how sports fans feel if their losing team rebounds and has a chance to win the title. They can't think of anything else. They just yearn.
But the evidence suggests that Sanders did well in the primaries, not because of his progressive views, but because his voters were attracted to a charismatic white guy they viewed as an outsider. Beto is far more that figure in 2020 than Bernie.  https://t.co/qbHEeGEl65 https://t.co/dpGaolVnzR
The reality is that if voters were as issue-focused as Sanders stans were arguing, they wouldn't be worried about Beto one tiny bit. They'd be way more worried about Warren or Gillibrand, both of whom are to the left and frankly more intelligent and substantive than Sanders.
@ifartedblood Sanders voted with Republicans occasionally against the majority of Democrats, as well. Classic cherry-picking,
@kenner116 @DawgsWillHunt Sure, dude. You do you.
@bchadhill Statistical evidence shows that was also Bernie's appeal, and not The Issues. That's why they're actually worried. They know that Sanders voters wanted a charismatic man that seemed like an outsider. He no longer fits that bill — but Beto does.
@parabasis Note that Sanders voters were not to the left of Clinton voters, and to their right on multiple issues. https://t.co/qbHEeGEl65 What Sanders voters had was an enthusiasm for "outsider" candidates and less enthusiasm for multi-culturalism. Beto will be very attractive to them.
@parabasis The gripe seems to be that he’s to the right of Bernie, though. The believe (which I disagree with) however, is that all Dems are to the right of Bernie. So the special ire, I think, is due to him being a unique threat with white voters in caucus states, which Sanders needs.
@DawgsWillHunt They aren’t paranoid. They are disingenuous. The real objection to Beto is he’ll clean Bernie’s clock.
And I say this not as someone who ranks Beto #1. I want Stacey Abrams to be the nominee. But Beto is great and I think the disdain for him is not substantive, but rooted in a secret realization that he’ll win over the Bernie voters who just liked a charismatic white guy.
This argument is very convincing, if you believe most voters spend all day on angry faux-socialist Twitter. https://t.co/ejKhQCk0dh

Moderate tolerance of anti-feminism and false equivalences between feminists and anti-feminists allows alt-righters freedom to enter your geek community and start recruiting young men that they intend to radicalize. So don't be squishy. Kick out the sexists.
All of which suggests two things could help curtail white supremacist recruiting: 1) Way better sex ed that emphasizes that dating is hard for *everyone*. 2) The "moderates" in geek spaces need to quit scolding feminists and hand-wringing about whether #MeToo has gone "too far".
This is effective because it preys on young people's insecurities about dating and sex, which can be amplified by the persecution complex a lot of geeky young men have. Once they're in and hating "SJWs", then it's easy to start luring them into white supremacist thought.
The alt-right recruitment strategy is crystal clear now: Enter "geek" spaces like video game fandoms or atheism, and start telling young men that feminist objections to sexual harassment are a cover for the "real" agenda, a conspiracy to keep them from getting laid.
https://t.co/rnsGt5HWI4 The “feminism wars” of atheism led directly to young men being recruited into white supremacy. This was what a lot of us were worried about, but noooooo, we were accused of hysteria for resisting anti-feminists in the the atheist world. https://t.co/X2L9NAjsyN

@OBoyleP @MarcFaletti Well, they were able to get pro-Russia propaganda normalized through Trump and change the GOP platform to be more pro-Russia, even if he loses. But yes, they clearly hoped he would win.
Putin and his cronies have become rich by stealing from the Russian people and parking the money overseas. Sanctions make the ill-gotten gains hard, if not impossible, to access. That’s why it’s so terrible how eager Trump and his cronies were to give Putin sanction relief.
As a reminder, the sanctions that Putin is aggrieved about are largely targeted at individuals, freezing their overseas assets and banning their ability to travel to countries who impose them.
As @MarcFaletti pointed out to me, this challenges the popular theory that Trump thought he couldn’t win and was selling out to Russia just for financial gain. Flynn’s offer only works if Trump wins.
https://t.co/KGsG9nYhnJ Flynn was offering sanctions relief to Russia during the campaign, during the same period the Russian government was criminally hacking Democratic officials in order to manipulate the election.
This isn’t unique to Trump’s administration, either. There is no such thing as an organized movement that opposes abortion for “life” reasons. The entire “pro-life” movement has backed efforts to reduce access to contraception.
https://t.co/uPGrACxOUI Good news. Also an important reminder that the Trump administration is not “pro-life”. They oppose efforts to prevent pregnancy, even though preventing unwanted pregnancy is the single best way to prevent abortion.

It’s arguable, in fact, that the “wall” is just a pretext for what Trump wants, which is a government shutdown. He views himself more as a ratings generator for Fox News than the president. (Someone should tell him Fox doesn’t pay him.)
Part of the problem is that right wing media has convinced their audiences there are two federal governments: The “good” one that serves up white people Medicare and Social Security and the “bad” one that gives out welfare checks to racial minorities. In fact, they are the same. https://t.co/EVIPXmK0nu
https://t.co/nvfwuVIhJd Trump’s declaring that he would own any government shutdown is being treated as a gaffe, but I think it’s more sinister than that. 		He is betting that his base wants a government shutdown, because they think they hate the government.
Republicans will back Trump even if he murdered someone. We know, because Trump covered for a murder — that of Jamal Khashoggi — and Republicans didn’t even blink. We know, too, they’d back him even if he sexually assaulted someone, as he bragged about it on tape.
So people who were hoping Republicans would get squeamish once it became impossible to pretend Trump is innocent, I’m sorry to report that your optimism was misguided.

This just sticks in my craw so much. I know that predatory capitalism and the way banking and credit systems screw over poorer people and average consumers isn’t a sexy issue, but it is a major cause of people’s inability to get a leg up, and Warren really works hard to help.
@misctx Sadly, not the MAGAheads that are the issue here.
Who cares what Warren calls herself? She's been a powerful force in curtailing the predatory nature of capitalism and has a huge number of ideas that would go even further.
Nothing against expansive social safety nets, but they are, historically, a liberal idea, and have often been employed to forestall socialist reforms. Socialism is far more focused, traditionally, on Warren's concerns, which is economic systems and accountability to the public.
https://t.co/pYus5jiTCa This kind of argument is why I can't take so many people who like to call themselves "socialists" seriously. Warren's focus on corporate responsibility is closer to actual socialism than the expansive social welfare state that Sanders runs on. https://t.co/sa9NZQZvQy

https://t.co/zwwJFHKazW The document indicates that the guidelines recommend 51-63 months for these crimes. While Trump isn’t involved in all of them, I suspect that they’d like to give him at least 5 years.
It occurs to me that one reason prosecutors recommended 42 months for Cohen is that, even though he cooperated, they need to signal how serious this crime is. Because they believe Trump did it, too, and this suggests they believe he should do serious time for it.
@FuturesCoRyan The problem is that women are the ones pressured to reduce outside employment to meet housework demands. If men did their fair share, women could make more money.
@princessmom122 @tomwatson @HeerJeet Remember, Clinton’s not guilty verdict has historically been rendered exoneration. Trump’s will be, too, if only to avoid accusations of “liberal bias”. This is inevitable, not game playing.
@princessmom122 @tomwatson @HeerJeet Which is why it’s super critical to not allow that “not guilty” verdict that will allow him to walk away claiming exoneration.
@tomwatson @HeerJeet Two years of hearings, arrest him when President Gillibrand is sworn in. 😀
It's the same thing with the "#MeToo is going too far" hand-wringing. The implication is men graciously allowed that rape is bad, so we can't keep pushing them to agree that harassment is bad, too.
A lot of women are afraid to confront men about this, because, to be blunt, we're afraid of running them off. We're led to believe men are doing us a huge favor by opposing sexual abuse and supporting equal pay, so  not to push our luck by demanding equality at home.
https://t.co/lHKfUXFqFE Kudos to @JessicaValenti for calling out the “woke” men who want credit for being feminists, but also want someone else to do the housework.
@tomwatson @HeerJeet Trump literally took a document that accused him of a crime and declared it an exoneration. Imagine how far he gets when the Senate says “not guilty”. This isn’t 11th level chess, but very predictable.
@tomwatson @HeerJeet If Trump is impeached, he will not be convicted. This will immediately be characterized as an exoneration by Trump and his supporters, the cowardly media will go with it, and set him up for a state funeral with glowing, soft focus coverage one day, like Bush got. So, I oppose it.

@Sophiesirloin No, I don't think so. I think another candidate who feels fresh and different will pick up most of them. That's what Sanders had over Clinton more than anything.
@stuker I wasn't trying to sound conspiratorial. I think there's just a kind of political football chatter that people tend to keep off social media because it's boring in that context, but is fun to talk about with friends.
@atonal440 But that's been going on for a month now. What's got people prickly is a sense that the Beto attacks came all in a span of a couple days.
@NotTonyWonder @JulianNotaro1 Not really. I hear something cool I hadn't thought about before, and I turn around and say it to the next person. It's how humans operate.
@zolsavicky @daveweigel No, my point is that people tend to hear stuff and have predictable reactions. So there's just nerd chatter, most of which is not coming for Sanders hardcores, but when they hear it, they have an entirely predictable reaction.
The other thing I'll add is that the really aggressive Sanders folks are a small minority of people who voted for him in the primary. I think that gets forgotten sometimes. In a bigger field of candidates, there's good reason to think a lot of those folks will pick someone else.
@JulianNotaro1 Dude, that is literally my point. As soon as people started talking Beto 2020,  the Sanders troops flew into action. They don't need to be prompted to clear the decks. They just do.
@subalternuplift The fear is that Sanders gets wiped out before then. The way I heard the theory: Beto takes Iowa, Warren takes NH, Booker takes South Carolina, and Bernie’s momentum is gone.
Point is, this is what people political nerds, of which I am one, chat about over cocktails. And so I suspect this theory of Beto’s rise is spreading and causing a lot of people, unprompted, to go on the offense. It’s part of the Sanders stan culture, not a conspiracy.
But the kryptonite to that strategy is having a really charismatic candidate who makes a good in-person impression and has a willingness to shake every hand in the state. So Beto’s a real threat to the Sanders strategy in caucus states.
The issue here is the caucus states. Having pushy people championing you can be an advantage in a caucus state, if only because people vote for you guy so they can go home already. So that makes them Sanders-advantageous.
Which is to say, I think Sanders stans hear this theory and then spring into action. Which is, in itself, a bit troubling. But it’s not a conspiracy. Ideas spread in the somewhat incestuous world of progressive politicos chatting at parties.
I doubt very much there’s a Sanders stan conspiracy to sandbag Beto O’Rourke. Instead, I think what’s happened is that a theory is spreading rapidly in backchannels, that Beto is the biggest threat to Sanders in Iowa. I heard it at a party and suspect this is something spreading.

If anything, what I learned having this ancestry is that there’s an ur-WASP culture that appears to transcend even national origin. People were always, always shocked my grandfather was Mexican. Because he seemed like he grew up in Connecticut or something.
But I would not say this made them particularly woke or somehow more understanding of the world that today’s “multiculturalists”. They were pretty indistinguishable in their attitudes about class, race, and ethnicity from WASPs born and bred in U.S. Rigid Republicans to the core.

During Bush’s last year in the White House, AIDS became the number one cause of death for men ages 25-44. The CDC recorded over 200,000 Americans with AIDS from 1988-1992. 90% of them died. Please take time to think of them today. https://t.co/sKMYdsx9bz
https://t.co/csqKsOrHU1 Today is a day of mourning for Bush. I would like to ask people to take time today to also mourn those who were lost to AIDS while Bush dragged his feet and argued that “behavior change” was a better solution than prevention programs.
I say this all as someone who grew up in a house where guns were laying around, where teens could just take them. I think my parents just didn’t think about it. That’s why public education is so important, and why it’s awful of the NRA to tell parents not to listen to doctors.
What Loesch is arguing is the equivalent of saying that a “good” parent wouldn’t need to lock poisons away from children. In reality, good parenting involves things like putting locks on cabinets. It’s 101.
@Jankowski60 Cool. I’ll be bored with calling them out when this country’s gun violence epidemic is over. Until then, your boredom isn’t my concern or responsibility.
The point is that a major aspect of being a good parent is providing a safe environment for children to grow up in. 		And while conservatives may not like hearing it, part of that is not having guns in the house. To avoid “subpar” parenting, get rid of guns.
https://t.co/GxrIOBkjoW Dana Loesch tries to argue that there’s no need to keep guns from kids, blaming “absent or subpar” parenting for teen suicide. Not only does this victim-blaming fail to account for realities of mental illness, it is also incoherent.

The main thing holding back the authoritarian right isn't a sense of morality. It's a fear that getting violent means losing their comfortable lifestyle. If that equation changes, the violence won't be "jokes" anymore.
Look to our own past: Slavery, lynching, sending dogs after civil rights activists. The violence isn’t unimaginable. The open fantasizing about it is likely just what it seems: Authoritarians testing the waters, seeing if they can push us in that direction again.
There is no reason to think Americans are uniquely incapable of turning to the viciousness that other countries have endured at the hands of authoritarians who gain power. Indeed, we’ve already seen a journalist murdered, and Trump is actively trying to cover it up.
I don’t think it’s preposterous to assume a number of right wing figures mean it when they say they’d like to see political opponents murdered. Pinochet wasn’t joking when he threw people from helicopters, and Erickson wasn’t joking when he fantasized about it.
https://t.co/ZycghAQpKt I think this piece is right that conservatives traffic in liberal outrage — my book, Troll Nation, is all about this — but I think it’s wrong to assume this means that Coulter, Erickson, Lahren, Yiannopoulos etc. don’t mean the awful things they say. https://t.co/SGGrw3I1Dx

@CalgaryET This kind of “gotcha” was what I was trying to discourage liberals in engaging in. The idea that Bush was a noble statesman who had nothing in common with Trump simply isn’t true when you look at the record. They have a lot in common.

3) While people think of “Operation Desert Storm” as the “better” Iraq War, it was also sold to the public based on a bunch of lies. https://t.co/P6OdxRt7JA This established the pattern that W. built on, of using lies to start wars.
It also, like embracing anti-choice politics, helped firm up the GOP as the party against women. The pattern of rallying around accused sexual predators and defaming their victims as sluts and liars really started with Thomas and continued through Trump and Kavanaugh.
2) H.W. appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, as a slap in the face to the legacy of civil rights, as Thomas was replacing Thurgood Marshall. This was momentous, and not just because it helped establish “trolling the libs” as the major motivator of GOP politics.
By helping lift up the religious right in this way, H.W. paved the way for his son to win the presidency by campaigning on anti-LGBT and anti-woman policies. So the Iraq War is the eventual result of H.W. pandering on this issue.
1) Even though H.W. used to be adamantly supportive of reproductive rights — his nickname in Congress was “Rubbers” — he switched sides for political expedience. This move empowered the religious right, ushering in an era of right wing terrorism against abortion clinics.
There will be a lot of sentimentality about George H.W. Bush, with people casting him as a noble statesman, compared with Trump and with his own son. Do not fall for this. 		H.W. was a architect of the current situation, where the GOP is completely consumed by right wing nuts.

@CALMicC Wish I could say the same, but once Trump covered up for the murder of a journalist, I was afraid this is exactly the door that was being opened.
The killing of Jamal Khashoggi, I think, was a major step in this process. Now the extrajudicial killing of political opponents, with a cover-up from the government, is on the table. And fascism-curiosity will get stronger.

Which I think is proof positive that all talk about “redistributing” sex is just a euphemism for forcing women. If you want sex to be offered as labor and not pleasure, and you refuse to compensate it, and you want it mandatory, well, there’s a word for that.
https://t.co/H77I1UR5sH Saw someone on Facebook point out that sex workers are literally doing what these Jordan Peterson fanboys want, and “redistributing” sex, often at fairly affordable prices, when we’re talking camgirls. And yet these jackasses punish them for it.
It helps to learn a little bit about why people are fleeing Central America. A lot of gangs are exhorting people or forcing young men to join gangs. Conservatives are claiming we should not care about victims of terrible crimes, if they are male.		Sounds like man-hating to me.
And to be clear, adult men have a legal right to seek asylum. (Ask Marco Rubio, who talks about his dad using this claim to immigrate from Cuba.) Telling that feminists are called “man haters”, but hey, it’s not us saying your male identity means you can be tear-gassed at will.

So really, picking on Gillibrand means you are putting a man's "right" to sexually harass ahead of not her, but of the party in general. Sorry, but no. Your priorities are so screwed up, it's unbelievable, and the recommended course of action is to shut up forever.
But because Franken resigned, the Democrats could walk into the hearing with unmuddied records of consistency on the issue of sexual abuse and power. That moral high ground helped fuel the turnout in 2018, which depended on women's votes to carry Dems over the finish line.
Literally, the entire Kavanaugh hearing would have been about Franken if Franken hadn't resigned. All the news stories would be "Democrats hypocritically attack Kavanaugh after letting Franken stay". Every other word out of GOP mouths during the hearing would "Franken".
Also, if you enjoyed watching the Democrats rake up wins in the midterms, donate to Gillibrand or one of the other female Senators who spoke up early about Franken. Their willingness to stand up to Franken saved Democrats in the midterms.
@DemFromCT Female misogynists, a lot of them who simply believe their male friends rank higher than women they don't know.
Literally, the only reason to hate Gillibrand is you think men should get a free pass for sexual harassment, if you personally like them. That is nonsense and indefensible. Future attempts to rehash this lead to blocking. I’m done with “liberal” misogynists.
Folks, this is the last time I’m pointing this out: Gillibrand did the Democrats a favor. A drawn-out hearing, run by Republicans, over a clearly guilty Franken would have politically ruinous. That’s why the party supported Gillibrand, and Franken gave into reason.
@RomboughSunni Huh? I swear, Franken apologists are so incoherent.

Obviously, what is needed is government intervention. I realize that feels impossible right now, but things can change. Pressuring Democrats to work on solutions that they can enact if they get into power again is probably the best course of action.
But simply deleting your account so you can feel virtuous — or tell other people how virtuous you are — is going to have a minimal effect.
Boycotts are only effective if they are organized, targeted, and disciplined. If millions of people pointedly left Facebook and publicly refused to return until certain demands were met, that would be effective.
Leaving Facebook might make you personally feel virtuous, but it shouldn’t. It does nothing to stop Facebook’s bad behavior. You’re patting yourself on the back because you’ve confused sacrifice for effective action.

I recognize a lot of white people feel more comfy if we slide race talk and instead focus on class and economics. But this racial history is real, Hyde-Smith is running for the Senate, and we need to talk about it, and not water it down by changing the subject.
Yes, private schools in general have problems and there is a time and place for criticism. But segregation academies were a direct reaction to Brown v. Board and weren’t about reinforcing class per se, but clearly about maintaining racial segregation. That distinction matters.

@eekshecried Okay, that’s genius.
99% of ideas for Thanksgiving leftovers are variations on put it on bread, throw it over lettuce, or wrap it in an egg. Which is fine and how I deal with all leftovers, minimizing food waste. But it’s a little odd to me how much it’s presented a mystery, how to handle leftovers.

@kcraine @LOLGOP I'm guessing he just made it up. Ballpark, there's been 45 million abortions since it was legalized in 1973 (though worth remembering that the abortion rate was nearly as high before it was legal). And there's simply no way that half of those were black women.
White supremacist nonsense, like Bill O'Reilly pretending Beyoncé videos are the problem, not hundreds of years of oppression. Doubly offensive because, and this can't be reiterated enough, women get abortions out of a sense of responsibility to themselves and their families.
Bryant attacks black women in this way precisely because he knows that abortion is stigmatized and so he can slander women, especially black women, who get abortions, and get very little pushback. But we must push back.
And it’s worth noting that these aren’t even two flavors of “bad”. Women who get abortions are good people. They are exerting control over their lives and making sure that they give the best possible life to the children they do have.

In the long run, of course, we need to teach men, from the time they are boys, that women aren’t objects to own and control, but people who have a right to say no. But right now, we can at least take their guns. This is doable.

Maybe instead of seeing everything as a constant rehash of the 2016 primary, it’s time to actually talk about policy instead of scoring points for your “team”. A thought.
Instead of hip sneering about “means testing”, it would help if progressives engaged this argument. There is a real danger that most of the “socialist” programs are just about more giveaways to the middle class and offer nothing to people with fewer means. That’s a problem.
However, it’s worth noting that all the people bashing this article as “centrist” ignored the real point, which is that student debt forgiveness would benefit middle class college graduates, while offering nothing to those who didn’t go to college.
It’s worth noting that if we’re going to abandon means-testing, education is a good place to start. That an 18-year-old’s parents are rich doesn’t mean she is. Kids can be cut off. Kids are often made to take out a lot of loans by parents who don’t help pay them off. https://t.co/b4GKaFl7xM

https://t.co/J1I0VWJr1S I strongly suspect the antagonism to this is being exaggerated, in order to maximize click-generating conflict. I suspect most Democrats, even in the dreaded establishment, are fine with more competition. It has long-term engagement benefits, for sure.
I know it’s hard to believe, but I am very conflict-averse myself in my personal life. But that often just invites more conflict, because people with bullying tendencies see you as an easy mark. So sometimes the way to avoid conflict is perversely to embrace it.
One more thing: It might turn into a fight. Do not back down. Consider this current conflict insurance for the future. If you show that you are willing to fight with them, they tend to be more hesitant to be trolls in the future.
I find this often works, because it signals clearly that you won’t be trolled. You won’t change their minds politically, but you can deny them their desire to exert dominance through right wing trolling.		Trust me, when I started employing this method, I got trolled way less.

@canonizer @sandrasandraphd That's my sense. They operate at a loss to get market saturation. Starbucks wants you to think of them when you think of coffee, and one way to get that done is make sure there's no smaller coffee shops competing.
@annemulholland2 No need for snark here. People live in NYC for all sorts of reasons. They're not all snobs who believe other cities have nothing to offer.
Amazon coming in feels like more of the same, turning NYC into a sprawling shopping mall, which nothing but cookie cutter wares on sale and a population that can’t, you know, live there.
The issue here is income inequality, full stop, and it’s really hurting people. There may be jobs and people, but smaller businesses are folding as greedy landlords hold buildings open with too-high rents, hoping for a Gap or Starbucks to come in.
DiBlasio’s comment about Amazon next to project housing doesn’t sound as progressive as he imagines. It suggest that instead of NYC being for everyone, it’s going to be for super wealthy people with some subsidies so they can still have people they underpay for menial work.
I agree that Amazon itself isn’t going to be more than a ripple. But it’s enraging people because it’s a symbol of how the city continues to gear itself towards the ultra rich, leaving even well-paid professionals wondering how they can pay the bills. https://t.co/PPSp3xE1Nh

And no, it’s not “false” accusations that are a concern. One can be falsely accused of vandalism. But anti-feminists never suggest that means schools lose the right to evaluate evidence and discipline those they believe responsible.
@haru_spex0 Agreed, except I think by “lied”, they mean a woman failed to shut up and accept her fate.
Why, do you think, opponents of Title IX agree schools can eject you for, say, vandalism, but melt down in fury at the very idea that you could be similarly expelled for rape? 		Why are women less valuable to them than walls that are spray painted on?
As a reminder, schools have the right to discipline students for all sorts of crimes and misbehavior. You can get expelled for fistfights, vandalism, theft, and even a non-crime like plagiarism. 		And yet no one is in hysterics about this, calling it a “kangaroo court”.
@willfe Why are you okay with schools having the right to discipline students for theft, non-sexual assault, vandalism, plagiarism or other crimes or offenses? 		What is so special about sexual abuse that men who do it need to be shielded from consequences that others who misbehave face?
@maryannetalbott The victim should determine whether to file charges. Many do. So it’s not either/or.
@wendycockcroft @AlohaTaraMaria @StankSuzette The same way we deal with the rare false allegations of non-sexual assault or theft.

@bjoycollins A lot of women like to believe good girls don’t get raped.
Yep, instead of sensible gun control, we are expecting kids to learn EMT skills and then apply them while under fire. https://t.co/BMpXLB6qq2
So DeVos constructed a rule where girls assaulted during "good" girl activities — studying, extracurricular activities — have recourse, but girls who go to parties do not. Whatever the excuse, it works to distinguish "legitimate" rape from those the victim was "asking for it".
This highlights the Christian right influence, because the religious conservative view is, bluntly, good girls don't get acquaintance-raped. That a good girl should avoid wild parties and instead try to socialize, with an eye towards snagging a husband, at chaste events.
In response to a reader question, I'd like to flag one troubling provision of the proposed Title IX rules: Barring reporting from girls and women who are assaulted in the way Christine Blasey Ford said she was, at unofficial and off-campus parties. https://t.co/IdSNX07A3D
@FatVeganCommie Thank you for the thoughtful question!
@FatVeganCommie That thinking is reflected in the proposed rules. If girls are raped at parties or bars, then too bad. But they still allow reporting for “good” girl activities that might allow college girls to chastely meet future husbands, such as student activities events.
@FatVeganCommie As for rape, well, the way a lot of Christian conservatives see it is, to be blunt, that good girls don’t get raped. That you should be at home knitting and waiting for your future husband to get his oats sown with the bad girls before he comes around to marry you.
@FatVeganCommie It’s not well-reported, but evangelicalism is tied very closely to the “men’s rights” movement. Phyllis Schlafly was quite outspoken about her opposition to VAWA, precisely because she didn’t want women leaving bad marriages.
@FatVeganCommie I’d say they are pro-patriarchy. A lot of the anti-anti-rape movement is tied up in a “men’s rights” movement that was started mostly by men who are angry that their wives left them, and want to make it harder and more punishing for women to leave bad and even abusive marriages.
DeVos has bilked the taxpayers for $20 million to pay for her round-the-clock security detail. She clearly takes her own safety seriously. But the girls and women trying to get an education? They are expected to fend for themselves. https://t.co/dfzbIHXfdu
DeVos consulted misogynist hate groups heavily to write these rules, and it shows. The proposed rules reflect the thinking of men who have spent a lifetime thinking about how to manipulate legal systems to prevent women from getting justice. https://t.co/IU5gTtprUC
https://t.co/1bDwK5vPkD From yesterday: DeVos’s proposed Title IX regs are worse than I feared. They’re geared around the goal of making victims decide that reporting is too traumatic or impossible to be bothered with.
(And no, I’m not ascribing that motive to all photos men put up of their families. But if that’s your response to a “let’s hate feminists, prove you’re a man prompt”, well.....)

This is Franzen pretty blatantly trying to keep people who aren't privileged and wealthy from even considering a career in writing. https://t.co/8CC2wJ8bzx
Which isn’t to say that it isn’t useful to report that DeVos literally brought organized misogynists and rape apologists in to inform policy on how to deal with sexual abuse. But readers should know how radical that is.
Folks, quoting “men’s rights” groups in your pieces about Title IX rules is the equivalent of asking a white supremacist organization to weigh in on changes to the Voting Rights Act.
@gmo418 I disagree with the assumption that if such a thing is hypothetically possible, it must be assumed over sexism. If sexism was rare, over half of Congress would be women. Sexism is the *safe* assumption, like assuming the ground is wet because it rained.
@BedfordMassDems Yep! But not for Speaker, which is why sexists are using her hypothetical campaign to oppose Pelosi’s actual one.
First Elizabeth Warren, now Barbara Lee. Man, those not-sexists sure love supporting women for high office — as long as those women aren’t running.		They’re that boyfriend who loved your career aspirations because he secretly felt you’d give them up once you had his baby.
And the best part is the expectation that I listen to them and agree, while they did not do the courtesy of reading my piece before telling me it’s wrong. This listening thing, for the no-way-am-I-sexists goes one way.
@00OO2018 They would immediately change their minds if they thought she’d win, just like they all receded from Warren when she started to start sniffing around a 2020 run.
Men sure do think I am obliged to take their word for it that they’re not sexist! Which is not a sexist stance at all, no sir.
@RoseAJacob @RepBarbaraLee Because if they actually thought she had a chance, they’d withdraw support. Y’all only love women if you’re not too worried about them getting leadership roles. The same way men love having “strong” wives, so long as those wives don’t make more money.

@soopervillain I’ll allow “too old” when Sanders retires from being a politician. Until then, nope, it’s sexist.
@tadeutscher If you’re opposed to division, you’d stand down. That you assume it’s the woman’s duty to step aside in favor of “unity” speaks volumes. Well, women are done letting men have everything in the name of keeping the peace. Learn to share, men.

@rmangi Read the piece! (You won't, but you should. But I'm a lady, so this is a foregone conclusion, you not-at-sexist you.)
"We could have probably brought down that statue for a lot less."		Pelosi's capacity for a sick burn is not the reason for backing her, but it sure doesn't hurt.
Folks wanting a mid-afternoon dark chuckle, here’s a fun clip from the Washington Times in 2003, when they were trying to shame Pelosi for opposing the Iraq War, which they claimed was such a success. 		Oops! https://t.co/RSOReYXHkU
Not surprised that the people arguing against this article clearly didn't read it or they'd know their excuses are addressed in it. But as I noted, the opposition to Pelosi is rooted in sexism. Didn't expect them to get past the lady byline.
@rmangi If you read the piece, you’d know that isn’t true. But I know you won’t, for the same reason you dislike Pelosi. Starts with an “s”, ends with “ism” and is not as easily disguised as you think.
@rmangi Nah. It’s sexism. The idea that someone with no government experience is better than a seasoned politician at running the House is only the sort of thing you’d say if you’re rationalizing sexism.
Frankly, this leftist sexism has to end. It’s a real albatross around the movement’s neck. We’re crippling half our talent pool with this undue suspicion and making them work twice as hard to get half as much respect.
@BHussler Agreed. And I think that’s why sexist men are so quick to insist that women who have gone far must have cheated. They simply cannot accept that a woman did the work and was good enough.
Pelosi’s gender is clearly a trigger point for her detractors, no matter how much they whine as they deny it. But I say her womanhood is a bonus. She has put up with the worst men her whole life. She can deal with Donald Trump. https://t.co/pMNe8dqLSe
@BooneMordecai Ageism is completely intertwined with sexism. The same people squawking about Pelosi being too old don’t seem to have an issue with Bernie Sanders being a bit long in the tooth.
It’s starting to seem like anyone who happens to be a Democratic woman over 40 is going to be accused of being a “corporate sellout” (or “corporate whore”) or a “centrist. 		The implication is ugly, that women can’t win on merits and only gain power by cheating. https://t.co/9vjd0FfjIx
https://t.co/rU4BrliCN5 There is nothing progressive about the attempts to oust Nancy Pelosi.		On the contrary, it’s sexism and the “progressive” disguise is wearing awfully thin.

No surprise, with Confessore working on it. But the end result will be the blunt normalization of criminal foreign interference in our elections, as Republicans will deflect any efforts at accountability by turning to this. 		We are so screwed.

https://t.co/FMKuUxjzZW Check out my interview with @hbrikin about “What The Constitution Means To Me”, her incredibly timely play about women’s lives and constitutional law.
If an aging population changes your health care systems and your employment systems, it seems likely it could have this slight effect on sexual activity rates.
@JDelGracio Yes, he is using “self-abuse” to mean masturbation. Which is funny to me, because it’s unbelievably dumb and this is 2018.
And this. The fact of the matter is that the average American is older than she used to be and the percentage of Americans that are elderly is growing. So while old people have sex, plenty of it, they probably don’t have quite as much as newlyweds. So relax, people. https://t.co/yAhhdaDxkF
My guess is it mostly has to do with this: https://t.co/PmzMjVJrau
There’s a lot of reasons that might not be bad for this, as well. As I said before, women probably are just settling for bad sex with crap men less than they used to.
As a reminder, the average number of sexual encounters dropped from 62 to 54 times a year in the past two decades. Which means the average rate of intercourse went from 1.2 times a week to once a week. Not exactly an earth-shaking change.
Oh dear, Douthat today. https://t.co/iZFlegEuhg
White evangelicals can and do become more progressive. But they almost always leave the church as part of that process. That’s the real story here.
Instead of hoping that white evangelicals abandon Trump, we need to look at those who abandon their religion. People who de-convert, whether they become atheists or liberal Christians or just unaffiliated, are leaving because they realize white evangelicalism is the problem. https://t.co/xbiX0NZDlO
https://t.co/hKyqTS35zO Despite all the pre-election hype, it turned out white evangelicals had no intention of leaving the Republican party. And they never will. But that doesn’t mean there’s no hope of change.
Every single one of these men has a higher Trump score than Pelosi. Don't believe the lies about how the anti-Pelosi bloc is "progressive".  They are trying to pull the Democrats to the right. https://t.co/fieMNqPj9N

@BuckyBuck2001 Your defensiveness around this is having exactly the opposite effect as intended.
@tigerquinn7 Anyway, in your outrage that erased half the human race as people, you overlooked the likely explanation that the decline is mostly due tona decline in hetero sex. Which involves two people, not a man and an object.
@tigerquinn7 Uhhhhhh, literally I said women choose to have sex or not, and included them in the stats. Presumably women count as people? Did you overlook that in your rush to bizarre offense?
@Mexicoguy Maybe! But you don’t need to be married to be in a couple, so I think the effect is minor.
Or to be more blunt, it’s hard for young women to date. Like a quarter of young men are alt-right jackasses. And unlike previous generations, they don’t feel like they need to make do. Good for them! Maybe men will eventually catch up to the rising standards. Many already are!
Once people do couple up, there’s not a lot of evidence that they are having less sex than couples in the past. So there’s no need to worry. Slightly fewer aggregate sexual encounters &gt; a situation where women are unhappy because they settled for bad partners.
The stats are pretty clear-cut. The reason people are having a little less sex than they used to is they are a little more likely to be single. So why is that? I think it’s pretty clear: Women don’t have to settle for less in a boyfriend, so they hold out longer.
It’s funny how many articles there are out there exploring the (somewhat slight) decline in the frequency of sex for the average American, and never even considers the strongest possibility: That women now have more power to say no to bad sex.

@ellenwell_ I'd recommend reading the article! I think it might challenge this reaction a bit.

Trump isn't smart, but he knows how to do reality TV-style conflict. When reporters walk into press briefings, they're basically signing up to be pawns in a reality TV game. https://t.co/akcAr82tEP
https://t.co/bIQ1Chc6Ar Instead of suing, or at least in addition to it, journalists need to suck it up and boycott the White House press briefings. They’ve devolved into reality TV theatrics and make everyone involved look foolish.
Which, to be clear, I'm not against. Just worried about liberalism getting redefined as "socialism" and inadvertently pulling the country further to the right.
I love all the folks calling this "socialism" and hope very much that you're being sarcastic, because it's really not. It's just FDR-style liberalism. Socialism would be the government taking over Amazon and running it. https://t.co/fEhIu6FU5x
@albabbitt I think that's appropriate sometimes, but there's solid sociopolitical reasons to believe people want more than just money. They want jobs.

@RyanMcDonnell16 Here’s some more thoughts: https://t.co/QTVIBeP7DY
@RyanMcDonnell16 Yeah, but that’s arguing a fact that everyone knows is a fact. Conway knows. Her audience knows. They are lying. So instead of trying to prove the already known, we need to dig deeper.
Conway is the mother of small children herself. Reporters need to ask why she seems unconcerned about defending people who would be so callous as to lie about the Sandy Hook parents, rather than trying to debate her about facts, which never works, since she is a shameless liar.
As a reminder, this is in defense of a video made by a site under lawsuit for claiming the Sandy Hook shooting was faked.		We can get caught up in the arguments over facts, but let’s not lose sight of the fact that these lies are being told in service of relentlessly evil people. https://t.co/LhFpdeYWhG

@Jonibyoung My mad deduction skills say the person who tweeted this deleted it for a reason. And it's not because it's totally unrelated. So you are just saying things — I need evidence, not speculation.
@Jonibyoung I'd love to see your proof, one way or another, of when this photo was taken. Don't tease, show!
Amending this tweet. I can't, with dead certainty, say this deleted tweet is about the same photo shoot as the Baraboo "sieg heil" photo. What I can say is it is evidence that photo shoot is an occasion parents attend. And the photog said they were there. https://t.co/rYNauscUTj
@Jonibyoung Proof? I amended the thread to be clear that I can't say for certain it's from the same photo shoot. Can you offer your proof? I'd love to see it, since you see so certain.
I can't say for certain that the deleted tweet showing parents at the Baraboo high school photo shoot is from the same year. The tweet was deleted, and date tag is gone! But the photo suggests parent attendance to this photo shoot is the norm, as does the photog's lame excuse.
@Jonibyoung Proof? Anyway, it shows this photo shoot has parents at it, as is traditional for all proms everywhere in all places.
@aaronecarroll What an odd thing to say. Whatever you want to claim about your experience, 99.9% of kids going to prom pose for pictures taken by parents before the event.
In addition, the photographer’s obvious lie about this situation does require him to inadvertently admit the parents were there. So don’t believe the “well I never” crap. https://t.co/VFJEUM6Sfx

Whenever white adults in these situations clutch their pearls and say, “I have no idea where these boys learned [rape jokes/racism/sieg heil]”, don’t believe a fucking word. They learned it at their parent’s knee and in their schools and it was encouraged.
No, instead the adults were *delighted* and cheered the boys on, laughing at how well these young men had absorbed their bigotry and loathing of people with Latin American heritage.
Some pro-choicers started chanting "Sí, se puede!” And a group of teen boys I was standing next to replied by chanting, “Build the wall!” 		At this racist display, did the adult anti-choicers stop the boys and say there’s no place for racism in the “pro-life” movement. Ha!
Told this story before, but it bears repeating. I was at a rally a couple years ago where pro-choicers and anti-choicers were clashing. Being a white lady and with the help of enormous sunglasses, I was able to blend in with the antis without being noticed.

Just remember, for the right wing troll — and nowadays, they are all trolling, all the time — if they can bait you into arguing, they think they've "owned" you. So don't. Find other ways to fight back, instead of using facts against those who reject facts.
But there are ways, I think, for journalists and liberals in everyday life to fight back against right wing lies and trolling, all without giving them what they want, which is to get you into a fruitless debate over facts or to make you lose your temper. https://t.co/QTVIBeP7DY
