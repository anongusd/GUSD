@DJL_1022 @BrianFr93771928 @BettinaVLA @JohnHookfox10 @WaywordKnight @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama And still, because I have been a Republican since the 70s, I went to his damn rally when he came to town and was scared and sicked by the hatred that he fomented.

@DJL_1022 @BrianFr93771928 @BettinaVLA @JohnHookfox10 @WaywordKnight @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Then he began his campaign and started fear-mongering‚Äîclaiming Mexicans were drug dealers, rapists and worse, he followed it up with making fun of a handicapped man who asked something he didn't like.

@CoalCracker21 @donwinslow @CBSSunday Trump's way is petty and dangerous. He should have taken what Congress was willing to give him and then continued to work them and add more in the next year. I reality, if this has been such a problem, he should have addressed it when the GOP held both houses of Congress.
@CoalCracker21 @donwinslow @CBSSunday His use of calling a national emergency scares me as it sets a terrible precedent. It will pretty much give any president a blank check to do whatever suits their will. As the Democrats warn about possibly calling a national emergency for climate change, gun laws and more.
@CoalCracker21 @donwinslow @CBSSunday Well, it sounds like we have some common ground, but on the president's insistence on a wall and calling a national emergency, it sounds like we will have to agree to disagree.

@silvercreeklady @CNNnewsroom @tedlieu What are you smoking?
@KeepItRealist You mentioned one reason that it isn't getting as much play as it might otherwise. Roger Stone. Another one is that Trump caved. It turns out that he isn't much at making deals after all.
@KeepItRealist Then how did you find out about it? Gillum is trending. That's how I found out about it, and almost every news outlet in Florida is on the story. The investigation will move forward, and he will either be convicted or exonerated. That's how investigations work.
@powrsurf What a turd. This news is all over the internet. The only thing from making this the top story is the fact that President Trump caved and Roger Stone was arrested.

@mm4fsu @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr And, the typo. Ugh! Perhaps it was one of those Freudian slips.
@1a Perhaps, when Jesus walked this earth, he said it best. "God is Love." And love is all there is. So, taking that to logical conclusions, hell is existence without love. 		Trying to remember that, and act accordingly, is a difficult journey. A road that we are all on‚Äîtogether.
@1a I was raised Catholic and, therefore, learned about hell, a lot. Over the years, my views have evolved. I don't think it's like Dante's Inferno, or the firey pits of Sheol, Hades, or Gehenna. I think it is more the absence of God's presence. And further, KNOWING God is there.

@LiloAuntie @NancyPelosi @LaureReminick @realDonaldTrump @GOP TBH I voted for @JohnKerry way back when and would have voted for @JerryBrownGov when he last ran if our politically-corrupt election system hadn't eliminated him before the primaries in Florida. I have always put country before party.

@HaysCarlyon I'm good with getting rid of Fournette. We have passed on far too many other good backs in favor of building a team around him and Bortles. I wonder how long we will continue to hold onto the belief that Caldwell knows what he is doing?
@AggieFootball @taxslayerbowl Dear @AggieFootball. Congrats on your win. You had better pray that Saban doesn't leave Alabama anytime soon as Jimbo will drop you in a minute for the money. He gave up on FSU when he started shopping and left the program a wreck. It WILL happen to you, too. Enjoy the ride.
@Franklin_Graham Bless your heart! Why do you continue to test our Lord by supporting the president? Have you taken up the role of the devil and cast the American people as Job? What is wrong with you? I know that you were raised better than this.
@Franklin_Graham Would it be that you actually believed this prayer.
@TrueFactsStated YASS!
I never supported him, and because of him and the undying allegiance to the man instead of the country, I will be FOREVER leaving the @GOP after being a life-long Republican. The party is corrupt and rotten to the core. Good riddance! https://t.co/DgXVP5euC2
@NancyPelosi @LaureReminick @realDonaldTrump This Republican of almost 40 years, stands firmly in support of you. In 2019, my resolution is to FINALLY leave the @GOP and all of their corrupt, selfish, and divisionary way. We need to bring ALL Americans together. #HappyNewYear

@leesuperstar375 @Tomahawknation @tashanreed The focus should be on playing well and being a great team player. The rest should fall into place.
@leesuperstar375 @Tomahawknation @tashanreed Right. That's what I said. Nothing wrong with it as a goal but I think that we are starting to see more individualism in sports instead of teamwork, and that can fracture and break teams. IMO that is some of our problem this year.
@leesuperstar375 @Tomahawknation @tashanreed not as a goal but there should be a little loyalty to university.
@SenDuckworth "should?"
@shannonrwatts Loesch is a monster who will say and do anything for a buck. I think that there is a word for people like that.
@tashanreed THANK YOU!! It is nice to get the 4 &amp; 5 stars, but they aren't always the best team players. Look at Alabama's newest RB recruit who is after the Heisman as a freshman. Seems he's looking out more for himself than his team &amp; looking more towards an NFL payday than college.
@amber_khan @rmatthartley Unless and until the Church ferrets out all of these monsters and the Bishops &amp; Cardinals who enabled them, the Church will be a diseased and putrid organization engorged on power and money. Fix it, now, @Pontifex. Telling is not the same as turning them in.

@Gamerben111 @comicsanDDevils @ronmarz I can't say as I enjoyed it or learned anything. Maybe next time, you could share something to back up your statements and/or beliefs. That's usually how people challenge another's wrongly held beliefs, but it doesn't always work. People have to be receptive to facts. Right, Ben?
@Gamerben111 @comicsanDDevils @ronmarz Not pissed off at you. I feel sorry for people who can only see their side‚Äîespecially when they are so off-base.
@Gamerben111 @comicsanDDevils @ronmarz Fact, Ben. Facts.
@Gamerben111 @comicsanDDevils @ronmarz The man convicted and died in prison for the crime was a far-right, white-supremacist. He was also a big supporter of George Wallace. I will congratulate you on your indoctrination. Your boys must be proud.

@MichaelF788 @thejaskr070 @ManaByte Have fun with your indignation. I'm sure the fanboys will like it. For a comic book fan of more years than you have probably lived, my tastes have matured as I have gotten old. Camp for the sake of an immature laugh, just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Hope you enjoy it though.
@MichaelF788 @thejaskr070 @ManaByte I base my comments on one of the trailers and the fact that many of those who have seen it said it was "campy". I would have preferred something more along the lines of The Dark Knight or Logan. This felt more like Flash Gordon. Fun but "campy". I'll wait for Netflix.
@MichaelF788 @thejaskr070 @ManaByte Touched a nerve, there, eh Sparky?
@wbishop_3 @dannykanell You're right about one thing. It wasn't a question! Doh! I'll stick to my original comment. It would have to depend on the outcome of the game and the other games. FWIW I don't think that  there is anything to worry about. Bama should take it all,

Looking for a replacement. Any recommendations? We're looking for the Goldilocks mattress‚Äînot too soft; not too firm. Not too expensive; not too cheap. Just right. Definitely not another Stearns &amp; Foster. #InferiorQuality
We figured we'd splurge. Buy a nice mattress. We bought a Stearns &amp; Foster king. Bad idea. Within 3 months, the mattress started sagging. We complained. They sent out a man with a ruler. He said he saw the sag, but it wasn't enough. No refund. #NeverAgain #CrappyCustomerService
