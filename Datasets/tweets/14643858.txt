I'm so glad I have a credit union for my checking account. Guess where I will be transferring my @chase balance to?
Guess my awesome credit rating, carrying a balance and making on time monthly payments to them isn't worth it to them anymore @chase

Just had a bad experience with @chase calling ME to lower my cc interest rate but wanting to charge me 22% of my balance as a fee!
