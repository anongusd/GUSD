800k workers missing a paycheck &amp; thousands others harmed in some way by the #TrumpShutdown is an emergency, not the situation at the border. @HouseDemocrats are again passing bills to re-open the gov't. @SenateGOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump need to come to their senses &amp; do the same.

It’s not enough to simply remember the individuals impacted by the #ColumbineHighSchool shooting once a year. We need to honor these individuals every day w/ action - action to make gun violence less deadly &amp; less frequent, and a commitment to get involved in our own communities.
I will never forget the lives lost or effected by the tragedy at #ColumbineHighSchool. I am committed to help ensure the safety of our communities by supporting meaningful reforms that will help prevent other innocent lives from being lost to gun violence.
Today is a painful reminder of one of the darkest days in CO history when we lost 13 innocent lives to gun violence. Since that tragedy we’ve seen countless other acts of gun violence. Yet a moment of silence is the only action that’s been afforded to victims. That is not enough.

Six months ago, Trump made the disgraceful decision to end #DACA, pulling the rug out from under these folks leaving them with the fear of having to leave the only life they’ve ever known. I'll continue to push for Congress to act and protect #Dreamers. https://t.co/Zwomp7U3BZ

The #GOPTaxScam gives the most benefits to corporations &amp; the wealthy, plain and simple.
