@mitchellvii @Cernovich Hey, if you want to get rid of the 5th, why not the 2nd too?
@sdkirk57 @Mimymomary2 @EWErickson Yes, every government in the world that funds climate research, without fail, has a legal requirement that the scientists agree that climate change is real. That's not even remotely true.
@AGirlHasNoPOTUS @lagibbs84 'Silence is consent'...First of all that's pretty rapey. 2nd, how was Ms. Gibbs being silent? Did you read the original tweet?
@oldandydufresne @lagibbs84 @WatchArtTV @imtheotherjoe @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump By implying that Ms. Gibbs is a "puppet" you accomplished what the Trump WH tries so hard to do: devalue and discount the freedom, voices, opinions, and decisions of minorities and women.  Congratulations.
@CinnammmMaria @oldandydufresne @lagibbs84 @WatchArtTV @imtheotherjoe @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump But criticizing those who choose to be civil  to the Trump train is counterproductive and only makes more enemies.
@CinnammmMaria @oldandydufresne @lagibbs84 @WatchArtTV @imtheotherjoe @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump And even though 45 and his family/staff are, and even though they may represent nepotism, corruption, and buffoonery, treating them with respect is NOT the same as embracing their agenda or ideals. You can choose to treat them with the same disrespect that they have for many, 1/2
@oldandydufresne @lagibbs84 @WatchArtTV @imtheotherjoe @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump How do you explain the fact that RBG and Scalia were very good friends despite being on complete opposite ends of the political spectrum? Or how the Supreme Court is able to debate controversial issues while remaining civil and decent? Shouldn't we aspire to that?
@Joe_Munney @oldandydufresne @lagibbs84 @WatchArtTV @imtheotherjoe @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @USABS @IvankaTrump How to win friends and influence people 101, Joe. You're really helping your side.

@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes I just did. And "hold (some of) their views" != "subscribe to their ideology of fascism"
@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes And that is reprehensible. Still doesn't make him a fascist. A "part of the problem", certainly.

@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes If you want to "beat" these ideologies, you have to provide evidence and reasonable arguments.
@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes Yes, I am perfectly fine with everyone exercising their right to free speech. Doesn't mean I'm not disgusted by most of their views.
@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes For the record, PJW, McInnes, and Cernovich are complete morons, but I'm not ignorant nor stupid enough to call them something they aren't.
@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes I don't "fall for their lies"... I listen objectively and make judgements based on their arguments and viewpoints.
@MarlonEttinger @benito_chan_ @MeGminor @Hector_E_Alcala @BLMNYC @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @Gavin_McInnes Yes, they have marched with them, just like nonviolent police brutality protesters have marched openly with violent BLM.

@benito_chan_ I'd characterize it less of a debate and more of a history lesson.
@benito_chan_ Then maybe don't make false claims that are insulting to the memories and descendents of those who suffered.

@benito_chan_ @CalypsoBeach @Skellypro I'm gonna need a little more than just your word for me to accept that the photo is A) from Auschwitz and B) inside a purported gas chamber.
@benito_chan_ @CalypsoBeach @Skellypro "as little as possible" != nothing. And if you read my tweets thoroughly, you'd see this doesn't in fact invalidate any of my statements.

@OilySal @Abomination1349 @dennis_duclos @MIGHTYMAGAMAN @Cernovich @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Since compromise is inherently two-sided, yeah, he would need to sign on. Your point?
@aunt_libby @BreakfastImam @realDonaldTrump I agree. However, if you think DJT is any different than this crowd, I think you're delusional.

@aunt_libby @BreakfastImam @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump The few ppl who criticize EVERYTHING he does are a vocal minority. Most critique bc of disagreement in policy or morals.
@BreakfastImam You weren't listening hard enough.
@BreakfastImam OK, then how does Obama preparing an exploratory and speculative list make a travel ban the will of the liberal community?
@BreakfastImam @Abomination1349 @MIGHTYMAGAMAN @Cernovich @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by a Trump supporters complete lack of understanding RE politics and government in general.
@BreakfastImam A) I'm not a "leftist". B) It's dangerous and frankly stupid to support every single thing a leader does.
@BreakfastImam @Abomination1349 @MIGHTYMAGAMAN @Cernovich @POTUS @realDonaldTrump First, Obama doesn't dictate or even exclusively represent the liberal agenda. Second, he made a list. Not an executive order.
@bruch_amy @Abomination1349 @MIGHTYMAGAMAN @Cernovich @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Wow, I'm cute AND smarter than you? I guess God gave you the short end of the stick.
@BreakfastImam @Abomination1349 @MIGHTYMAGAMAN @Cernovich @POTUS @realDonaldTrump "Obama made the list of countries" doesn't make it part of the liberal agenda.

@BreakfastImam @Abomination1349 @MIGHTYMAGAMAN @Cernovich @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yeah sorry.... the travel ban in its current and past form goes against liberal/Democratic policy/beliefs.

@realmikefame @tariqnasheed Wrong again. Saying something racist doesn't necessarily make that person racist. So supporting someone who said it doesn't either.

@1upmovement I hope this isn't goodbye, because then you would've proved me right that you don't have a proper defense against my case
@1upmovement I have plenty of answers, you just refuse to address them.
@1upmovement @Myleslava @KilleenC_ @chris77_jay @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD By your standards,  he doesn't need to provide any evidence.
@1upmovement The thing is, there is a 99.9% chance that I'm statistically more intelligent than you. But you didn't know that until now. Sorry!
@1upmovement It's funny that you think you've made ANY legitimate arguments. All you've done is name-call and meme (badly).
@1upmovement What's also sad is you've convinced yourself that you have the moral high ground and that you haven't made a mistake or been wrong.
@1upmovement What's sad is that you assume that you are superior to those who disagree with you, and refuse to acknowledge their arguments.
@1upmovement I'm trying to get your attention. I admit that tweet was probably unwise of me. Now why don't you address my more meaningful points.
@GamingLeech @1upmovement It gave me ass cancer.
@1upmovement So advocating equal treatment is the white supremacist agenda? Then sign me up I guess.
@1upmovement I made many legitimate arguments against you. You just chose to ignore those and focus on the weakest.
@1upmovement @GamingLeech @RedWings51930 @KilleenC_ @chris77_jay @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD You can discourage me from saying it by implying that anyone that says it is racist, regardless of context.
@1upmovement And I'm not white. I believe in fair and equal treatment of all, regardless of skin color, gender, ethnicity, religion, or sexual preference
@1upmovement When did I say that? Your using a #TariqTactic , putting words into others' mouths.
@1upmovement @GamingLeech @RedWings51930 @KilleenC_ @chris77_jay @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD So you preemptively assume your superiority over others, and then dismiss their arguments because of this?
@1upmovement @GamingLeech @RedWings51930 @KilleenC_ @chris77_jay @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD "We decide what words we use" fair enough, then why can't non-black ppl say the n-word?
@Robert05409228 How about have Tariq (and yourself) watch Phil's entire body of work before calling him a racist.
@Robert05409228 And here's yours: Phil does a show every weekday since 2006. And I've watched most of those.
@Robert05409228 Because in this case, the video description states that he was attempting to make fun of stereotyping. Badly, imo, but still.
@Robert05409228 The problem is, this particular video was outdated, out of context, and misrepresents Phil's body of work.
@Robert05409228 They bring up the rap career bc it's fucking hilarious. I don't necessarily think they use it as an argument against his character.
@Robert05409228 I agree that an alternative to MSM is often good, but Tariq DOES distort... like when he cropped out the black Cosby accusers.
@Robert05409228 Phil has apologized many times for his old videos, and had changed significantly over his career. He owns up to his mistakes and grows up.
@Robert05409228 Which we don't. I asked him to provide evidence on his accusation and he never responded. Then, later on, he blocked me.
@Robert05409228 I called Tariq out on this, and he responded by making it seem like both I and Phil condone and promote violence against black ppl.
@Robert05409228 The Tariq tweet including the video of Phil making those jokes was presented out of context, and it is also outdated.
@Robert05409228 Phil called him out for this a while back, about the Cosby thing. Tariq responded by calling Phil a SWS.
@Robert05409228 Tariq uses his platform to fight personal battles. He also distorts the truth to round up anger.
@Robert05409228 hey can we move our convo over here? It's getting hard to navigate. Here's my main points:
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD But Tariq acts like they shouldn't have even been on trial in the first place.
@KilleenC_ @Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Chris, do you know the definition of insanity? ;)
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD And he's also tweeted stuff like this... https://t.co/7un2IltpUO
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD And what would Tariq say about either of them? That they are the victims of systematic WS, and are therefore innocent?
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He. Didn't. Say. That.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD And that's life. Shit happens.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD And if you think that wanting Tariq shut down is bad, then how do you defend Tariq shutting down/attempting to shut down his critics?
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD No, only some want to shut him down. And they do because in their eyes, Tariq is a hatemongerer and a race-baiter.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Like Bill Cosby, for example.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Consider his motive for not responding to my valid question of where Phil or I advocated violence.  Finally, consider why he blocked me.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Also, consider Tariq's motive for calling out Phil. Consider his motive for replying to my legitimate point with a false accusation. 1/2
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD That is not even close to being logically sound.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Tariq implied that Phil's joke was used to justify violence against black ppl. https://t.co/YGnfLwfVAV
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD If he had been more suspicious he likely would have behaved more aggressively and still would've been killed.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD We didn't. Then I asked where I or Phil had said those things. he didn't respond. Then he blocked me.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD To attack Phil's character, then when I called him out, he tried to discredit my statement by implying I and Phil said something 4/X
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He is petty, self-obsessed, and hides it behind a facade of "anti-racism strategist", look at how he used a dated, out of context clip 3/X

@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Tariq deserved to be called out because he uses his platform not only to speak out against racial injustice, but also attack his 1/X
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Because someone jumped to conclusions too early about him and (hate to be cliche) judged a book by its cover!
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Is Phil?
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Yet your criteria for SWS is broad enough to include people who have never hurt others in their life?
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD And there are a million other things to worry about in life, so I don't focus on it unless absolutely necessary.
@1upmovement @RedWings51930 @KilleenC_ @chris77_jay @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He probably meant "shouldn't" be taken seriously. Just bc others do doesn't mean it's healthy or productive.
@Robert05409228 @KilleenC_ @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Because Zimmerman either was not qualified for his job (he got spooked easily) or he's guilty of racial profiling. I'm not.

@JordanMichael08 @CritclDisbelief @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad Just read through the replies for any of Tariq's tweets and you'll find it.
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Yes but I wouldn't ever tweet "This dude is a thug, a gangbanger, and a drug-dealer".
@JordanMichael08 @CritclDisbelief @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad No, the METHODS used to "criticize" WS do. Calling them subhuman, celebrating violence against them, threatening them, etc.
@JordanMichael08 @CritclDisbelief @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad Promoting violence, hate, and oppression of free speech.
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD But publicly calling them racist or SWS diminishes the actual proven racists and WS.
@JordanMichael08 @CritclDisbelief @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad I think that letting WS expose their own flaws and presenting a more logical and peaceful alternative is better. 3/3
@JordanMichael08 @CritclDisbelief @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad it differently. The "critiquing" that many feel appropriate for WS is very counterproductive bc it "fights fire with fire". 2/X
@JordanMichael08 @CritclDisbelief @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad The Barkley interview was good, so was the WK Bell one. I didn't say not to have a conversation with WS, and perhaps I shouldve worded 1/X
@JordanMichael08 @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @CritclDisbelief @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad I never said to ignore them. I don't think the "confrontation" that's happened has lessened their influence, in fact it's done the opposite.
@JordanMichael08 @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @CritclDisbelief @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad Emboldens his ilk and gives them more reason to mock and hate. We have to be better than them and demonstrate that publicly.
@JordanMichael08 @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @CritclDisbelief @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad The whole Richard Spencer thing, for example. Punch him in the face at a protest, then trumpet it as a victory against WS? It just 1/2
@JordanMichael08 @daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @CritclDisbelief @Def_A_Cool_Guy @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad And if you want that popularity to die you stop giving them attention and ammunition.
@daringlogic @SeriousPerson1 @CritclDisbelief @Def_A_Cool_Guy @JordanMichael08 @attichris84 @tariqnasheed @Sargon_of_Akkad Real WS don't need "critiquing" bc everyone reasonable agrees that their POV is disgusting and regressive.

@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He doesn't have long twitter conversations. He still tweets.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He doesn't DIScourage it.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD YOU think it wasn't a hit list, but I guarantee that there were threats and harassment directed towards its content.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Post hoc ergo proper hoc.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He wasn't ignoring that. He was criticizing Tariq for his indifference towards women.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Jeez, you can stop spamming that article. Phil considered the racial narrative, and thought it was ridiculous.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD It's fine to be skeptical. Tariq isn't skeptical. He's convinced that it's a WS witch hunt.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He doesn't often have twitter conversations. That might not be a good enough excuse, but oh well.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He attacked Tariq because he knew that any attempt at a productive conversation with him would be impossible.
@daringlogic @CNTheCrosshairs @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Your opinions were wrong.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD I'm choosing to omit it because many of Tariq's followers attack SWS with the same vitriol and hate as WS
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD And he has every right to suspect anyone who puts him on a list, given that he's harassed and threatened daily...
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Fair enough. How about the accusation of racism?
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD The majority isn't. And jokes aren't the enablers of police brutality.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD No, he isn't indifferent at all. He's realistic. Cosby won't be killed. And Tariq isn't skeptical or logical RE Cosby, he's convinced.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He attacked Tariq for forming a racial narrative where he thought there was none.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Disgusting and minimizes these women's accusations.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Phil believes that dismissing the overwhelming amount of accusers, both white and nonwhite, and calling this a WS witchhunt is 1/2
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Phil wasn't replying to "white accuse culture", he was replying to Tariq for injecting race into a matter that in his opinion didn't need it
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD I'm not, I'm omitting the suspected part because imo it's just a meaningless word in this context.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Sorry, SWS, not WS. Phil didn't lie, he said what he believed. He gets threats daily and a database listing one's enemies is pretty scary.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Fine, then reconsider your suspicions.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Personal intent and context DOES matter.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD No, he called out Phil because Phil called him out for manipulating a photo of the Cosby accusers to crop out the black women.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He also wasn't accused of downplaying g racist behavior.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD He isn't indifferent, something you would know if you watched his videos, many of which deal with racism.
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Ah, THERE'S the insult I was looking for!
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Example? (Besides this one from 8 years ago)
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Reconsider your condemnation of Phil as a white supremacist, or racist. BTW, THIS is what it looks like when I try too hard. :)
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD I really appreciate you contribution to this conversation. I really did learn something. I hope you do me a favor, though, and 11/X
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Tariq responded to me, trying to put words into both mine and Phil's mouths, just proves that Tariq acted emotionally and irrationally. 10/X

@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD The point of Tariq calling out Phil for this wasn't to raise awareness for something that caused legal discrimination against 5/X
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Furthermore, if you think that a joke a YouTube made 8 years ago has influenced modern public policy, you're delusional. 4/X
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD However, these jokes and stereotypes come from people who legitimately believe their contents to be true. I know that Phil doesn't. 3/X
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD I was wrong. I should have researched more thoroughly. I acknowledge I was also wrong in that jokes/stereotypes influence law 2/X
@daringlogic @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD I'm plenty educated in how to properly research and defend my arguments. I just initially didn't think your points worth researching 1/X
@daringlogic @aerionfallen @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD That wasn't a deflection. Also, isn't being uneducated and willfully ignorant about the same subject impossible? (This is a deflection)
@daringlogic @aerionfallen @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Ah. It's at this point you've resorted to insults. For a while you were actually making good arguments.
@daringlogic @aerionfallen @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD That is an unproveable point that I disagree with you on.

@KilleenC_ Fair enough. I thought you were very reasonable. Perhaps just unprepared for the onslaught of disagreement. Sometimes twitter is exhausting.
@KilleenC_ @bigkdc @1upmovement @chris77_jay @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Just make sure to shut up next time you think someone is being unfairly treated! /s

@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Yes, I did. The problem is, conflating what proven racists in that time would have done with modern UNproven racists do now is illogical.

@iamkerrylove @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD So because you haven't heard of any comedians telling these jokes, they don't exist.
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD So you admit that your comparison is baseless? OK.
@daringlogic @aerionfallen @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD You have yet to provide sufficient evidence to that point.
@daringlogic @aerionfallen @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Nixon's war on drugs may have been racially motivated, but there were no "jokes" that pushed it's agenda. Only stereotypes.
@daringlogic @aerionfallen @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Post hoc ergo proper hoc. Reagan used a "joke" analogy to promote the eventual law. Does not mean racist jokes -&gt; racist laws.
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD post Civil War racists are comparable to a modern day YouTube news commentator making insensitive and immature jokes.
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD I apologize, perhaps your statement was more factual than I realized. However, it is still moral equivalence to assume that 1/2

@iamkerrylove @KilleenC_ @MyVoiceY @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD Oh, so comedians are the only ones who can tell jokes now?
@PhillyD @tariqnasheed calling you out as a racist, using an 8 yr old out of context clip of yours.
@Robert05409228 @dotbspeaks @MyVoiceY @KilleenC_ @ty_martin13 @tariqnasheed @PhillyD The Klan started as a way to organize oppression and hate.

@Emass718 @tariqnasheed The "intellectual bullshit" is called being reasonable and fair in one's assessment of another's character.

@secondgunn74 @tariqnasheed It doesn't need to be funny to you (or me) to qualify as being said in jest.
@justice_logic @tariqnasheed Assume intent. Go right ahead. Make sure it fits your narrative!
@ArtistBobStone @tariqnasheed This is an astounding case of moral equivalence.

@HShazam Making a false DMCA claim on YT is against terms-of-service (and is also illegal), which is why Tariq's channel was shut down 3/X

@AnnaMenaceStar @pressinjest @SKETCHNIFICENT @tariqnasheed So because Tariq's ancestors didn't invent the term, he can say something hateful to black women?
@pressinjest @SKETCHNIFICENT @tariqnasheed If you still think hate speech isn't protected free speech, look up "Snyder v. Phelps".

@SKETCHNIFICENT @madlibertarian3 @tariqnasheed @IrateBear #youobviouslydontgetthereference
@SKETCHNIFICENT @pressinjest @tariqnasheed Don't call me the snowflake, dear. Tariq attacked black women with a derogatory slur. Hate speech, which is protected.
@pressinjest @SKETCHNIFICENT @tariqnasheed So then if hate speech isn't free speech, why can Tariq say this? https://t.co/jVuYOQQmdt
@SKETCHNIFICENT @triggeredtees @Jay1025Music @tariqnasheed https://t.co/uq4CBGmTMN
@SKETCHNIFICENT @tariqnasheed I don't think you understand. Tariq placed copyright strikes on videos he did not make, some weren't even about him. https://t.co/uq4CBGmTMN
@SKETCHNIFICENT @tariqnasheed Because "hate speech" (which in this case isn't actually hate speech) is protected under free speech, whereas false claims are illegal.
@SKETCHNIFICENT @tariqnasheed "So much for freedom of speech"... Tariq falsely claimed 5+ videos. That's why his channel was shut down.

@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee Yes, they often do. Don't kid yourself.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee Won't get a productive response from the ppl they try to engage with.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee You HAVE to respond to people in order to engage in positive discourse. It isn't the fault of the antis that any video they make likely 1/2
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee This literally does nothing to further your argument or refute mine, and just serves as unproveable speculation.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee She is "snuggling up" to him bc they had a heart-to-heart convo including an apology from Carl for the anguish he caused her.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee They don't ignore this. They also don't condone it. Just bc they don't address every instance if it doesn't mean they are OK with it.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee The fact that they profit from their work isn't a valid criticism given that most feminist advocates do too.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee There are antis who are to some degree guilty of trolling for trolls sake, but many have legitimate arguments and rational ideas. 1/2
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee Yes, the history here is relevant, but does not excuse Anita's behavior. She abused her position of power as a panelist.
@Space_Goon @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee She broke VidCon rules. She also perpetrated harassment by her own definition.

@Surgoshan @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun You responded to a tweet accusing Chris of being a white supremacist.
@Surgoshan @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun See my reply to your tweet where you call Chris a "fucking shitbag"
@Surgoshan @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun In no way does this promote or further the alt-right or white supremacist agenda.
@Surgoshan @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun I hardly think "not calling someone what they are" qualifies as "fucking shitbag" behavior. And I certainly don't see how it is "Nazism"
@Surgoshan @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun Perhaps Chris was unaware of this fact? Considering this was Nov. 2016, before Spencer became a household name?
@BlazerBluejeans @Surgoshan @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun Don't even get me started on how stupid this tweet is. @JonTronShow is NOT alt-right or a white supremacist.
@Surgoshan @BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee @ChrisRGun "Tries to position himself".... your analysis assumes Chris is a white supremacist.

@DirkDiggy86 @UpDollarHolla It's fine though, he blocked me
@DirkDiggy86 @UpDollarHolla Yeah I tried to keep going but my brain hurt after a while
@BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee Chris isn't a white supremacist. First of all, he's mixed-race, second, he's left-leaning, third, he openly mocks actual white supremacy.
@UpDollarHolla Once again, stop assuming what I think. I'm not deflecting one bit.
@UpDollarHolla Using power to influence the less powerful is most certainly leadership.
@UpDollarHolla No, I'm not. They aren't mutually exclusive. Kim K influences her fans to buy her products, subscribe to her lifestyle, etc.
@UpDollarHolla Also, please stop assuming what I think.
@UpDollarHolla I classify anyone who has a large following, and conveys opinions to that following, attempting to influence them, as a leader.
@UpDollarHolla She in fact is. She leads millions of young people in her fashion choices, her lifestyle, and her personality.
@BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee When has Laci ever promoted white nationalists/supremacists?
@UpDollarHolla Please explain to me how someone with 180K+ followers is NOT a leader.
@tariqnasheed @Protrump45 She never said YOU claimed to be a black leader. She is CALLING you a black leader. She therefore did NOT lie. You just misunderstood.
@tariqnasheed @Protrump45 I could say the same for you 😆
@Protrump45 @tariqnasheed Tariq doesn't do logic.
@BlazerBluejeans @WoolyBumblebee What gives you, or anybody else for that matter, the right to decide for ANYBODY what choices are "horrible"?

@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq And Now For Something Completely Different (is what you should call your argument tactics).
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Yes, it is an argument. See?
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Dan Loney is a human being of high intelligence and keen perspective who has never lost an argument to some dude on the internet.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I've been waiting for 7 hours for you to realize none of what you have said has come close to invalidating my statements.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Another "clever" reply that distracts from the fact that you started an argument you weren't equipped to win.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Considering you failed to hit a single thing that was thrown at you, I think it's safe to say you lost.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Just keep on telling yourself you won this one.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq John Hinckley was also mentally ill.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Then I apologize for being too empathetic.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq You were the one that asked me to.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq It is when I attempt to reveal how familiar I am with the subject material.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq "Trolls"? Seriously? I attempted to lessen obvious bias of the author but preserve her rhetoric.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq It's called "establishing credibility". You should try it sometime.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Do you need me to ask again? Sorry, I'm really stupid.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq How did I take an allegedly biased part as fact?
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Wants to be an anti-bullying advocate, she would do well to practice what she preaches. She crossed the line she herself drew. (3/X)
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq She has made her position very clear on many things, including bullying, abuse, and harassment. I am merely pointing out that if she (2/X)
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I have watched 50+ of Anita's videos, and followed her twitter for years. I'm not "deciding" what she believes, I'm observing it. (1/X)
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I don't even know what you mean anymore. Please help my feeble, forgetful brain understand...
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq So I'm sure Anita would say one-time in person abuse at a public event is just fine... oh wait no she wouldn't.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq She publicly insulted him, then tried to justify this. Consequently, she incited online harassment towards Carl. https://t.co/QwbIpzEZd0
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I'm sorry you feel that way. You still haven't addressed my point that the original article was overtly biased.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I'm waiting... make your case. Interested to see how you twist this one.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Quick recap: you asked me what I would have written, then tried to pick it apart, yet not once have you successfully refuted my statements.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq At this point I've lost any hope I had for a productive and well-reasoned discussion. Care to prove me wrong?

@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq OK then. Would you like to keep attempting (and failing) to present a valid opposition to my argument?

@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Please continue to assume I am even less informed than you are.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq One of many examples. Do your own research, it's not my responsibility to spoon-feed you info. https://t.co/zXMO3dq3s8
@transscribe And how does that justify your hypocrisy? You brought up someone's past statements to make a point. So did the article you criticized.
@transscribe U disagreed with the article's attack on Caitlyn's character bc it selectively quoted. U are guilty of selective quoting to attack character
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq They aren't written out explicitly, but watch her speech to the UN, or any of her videos RE harassment. Her opinions are well documented.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Once again, I never said I "hold her" to these standards. I believe that if she preaches these standards, she should abide by them.
@transscribe Pot, meet kettle. https://t.co/QxUGSujTaj
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I don't have to agree with Anita's "standards" to point out her hypocrisy.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I was referring to the remarks Anita made to the UN, which if applied to this situation, make her guilty of verbal harassment.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq I never said any of that. I also meant "speech", not "sleep".
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq These standards, BTW, are set by Anita herself, partially in her sleep to the UN RE cyberbullying and harassment.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq He's not "my man". I don't deny he has crossed the line multiple times RE Anita. That doesn't excuse her behavior. Standards are universal.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq Your lack of self-awareness is remarkable. It sounds like you have no more valid arguments (not that you had any at all), so good day.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe Which is concerning, given DFTBA's affiliation with @femfreq
@DanLoney36 @transscribe You can call the police and report it. This analogy, BTW, is as shitty as your argument.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe Stop making up silly job titles. It is up to individuals to call out hypocrisy when they see it. You are assuming intent. Read VidCon rules.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe 1. I'm not in the least bit insulted, I'm simply holding Anita to her own standards. 2. How would Carl know what Anita would do.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe It doesn't take an expert in VidCon policy to know that insulting an audience member while onstage is inappropriate and wrong.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe @femfreq @chescaleigh @AlliSpeed OK then. You prove my point that this article was sorely lacking. I don't have any journalistic training and even I could see that.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe Carl doesn't think that. He thinks Anita misused her platform and broke VidCon policy.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe I used her word "troll", Dan. If expanding on "many" is important, I would cite @femfreq or @chescaleigh or @AlliSpeed , all panelists.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe Furthermore, "Eventually..." is misleading because Anita said those things early on in the panel, before any inflammatory questions.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe I would have also refrained from using the word "physical", since no violence occurred. "Physical threat" is a gross exaggeration.
@DanLoney36 @transscribe How was that? Less biased, with more context? Almost like respectable journalism!
@DanLoney36 @transscribe ... many have condemned as hostile and tantamount to harassment. (2/2)
@DanLoney36 @transscribe During the panel, response-video trolls occupied the first 2 rows of seating, with several asking inflammatory questions, an act that (1/2)
@transscribe @nathan2s1 Sargon and a group of including @Some_BlackGuy @ChrisRGun sat in the front 3 rows. This isn't my narrative, this is a fact.
@nathan2s1 @transscribe I'm not trying very hard. The bias of this article is obvious and the intent to discredit opposing viewpoints is also obvious.
@nathan2s1 @transscribe Please show me where they did this. Not once has one of the ppl in those rows claimed they were there to harass.
@transscribe @nathan2s1 How does this in any way relate to why Sargon and Co. attended the panel?
@transscribe I didn't say you were lying. I said you did not provide proper context. You furthermore assume intent. This could have been much less biased
@nathan2s1 @transscribe "In order to harass the panelists in person" assumes the intentions of Sargon and Co.
@transscribe  https://t.co/8K3478OIIo
@transscribe  https://t.co/2KIdhV9mQh
@transscribe Some of these statements, however, lacked proper context and we're clearly deliberate attacks on someone's character.
