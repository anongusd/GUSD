Discrimination is any difference in treatment of an individual or person because of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.
Health and Welfare agencies, like hospitals, nursing homes, counseling centers, community service centers, may not discriminate by withholding or denying services, programs, benefits, facilities, or in setting rates for services based on demographics.
Discrimination is to treat someone differently, usually in a negative way, due to a given characteristic. Federal law prohibits discrimination by employers and many other entities on the basis of skin color, race, gender, national origin, disability, age, medical state, religion.
