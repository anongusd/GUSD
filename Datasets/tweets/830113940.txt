@Phillies I'm so excited for the start of the season.  However, I wish to ask you just one question even though I doubt that you all answer such an inquiry.  Are you guys currently planning something for Harry Kalas in April to commemorate a decade since his tragic death?
Reggie Fils-Aime is retiring, eh?  I mean no offense, but he's too young to retire anytime soon.  Nevertheless, I wish him all of the best of luck in his future endeavors.		I know Doug Bowser will do his best as President.
@BusyPhilipps Why, Busy?  Are you okay?
Happy birthday to Steve Irwin, who would have turned 57 today.  This wonderful man's life may have been cut short, but his legacy will live on in all of us.  		Crikey, I wonder if that stingray that killed him is still alive?  No, it doesn't matter.  I hope he's celebrating. https://t.co/K3hdohDBo8

@XboxP3 I'm so excited for Rare's new game to be shown at E3, but is that the only game that they will be showing?
@XboxP3, will @RareLtd only show one game at E3 2015?
@XboxP3, will multiple games from Rare be shown at E3?
@XboxP3, will E3 show only one game or multiple games from Rare?  I've got a feeling only one game will be shown...

@DynamoAlligatz @Ballot_Confess @MySmashCorner @SmashBrosBallot I don't think so, @DynamoAlligatz.  Everyone and I love Banjo and Kazooie.
@GruntildaBot We are a month away from E3 2015, Grunty.  Plan your plots now before E3 starts.  Bear and bird may appear there.

@NintendoAmerica Did you know that @RareLtd is upset being with @Microsoft?  Most, if not all, of its employees want to come back to.. (1/2)
@NintendoAmerica When is release date for Art Academy for #WiiU?
@NintendoAmerica When in 2015 is #Mario Party 10 releasing?
@NintendoAmerica When in 2015 is #Mario Maker releasing?
@NintendoAmerica When in 2015 is Yoshi's Wooly World releasing?
@NintendoAmerica When is the New #Nintendo #3DS and New #Nintendo #3DS XL launching?
@NintendoAmerica When is #Flipnote Studio 3D coming out, Reggie?
..Thank you for your patience. (2/2)
I'm sure the Art Academy for #WiiU and Flipnote Studio 3D will come out some time in 2015.  We'll get more info in the future... (1/2)
Today would've been the 37th birthday of the late Brittany Murphy.  RIP Brittany.  Love and miss you and see you in the heavens above.
@KingConker64 @BerriTChipmunk @proj_spark Thank you.  We'll have further information on whether or not @BerriTChipmunk and you will appear.
@kingconker64 @berritchipmunk @proj_spark We will have an update on your appearances soon, okay?
@BerriTChipmunk You poor thing.  @KingConker64 doesn't want you to be in @proj_spark, but you really deserve to be in the game.
@kingconker64 @proj_spark We'll find out soon enough.
@KingConker64 You should thank @proj_spark, @RareLtd and @Microsoft for turning you back into a family-friendly character.
@KingConker64 You should thank @proj_spark for reforming you for the first time since Pocket Tales.
@KingConker64 I'm speculating you and, once she's returned, Berri, and all of your friends and enemies will arrive in @proj_spark in 2015.
@BrittMurphyDad It could be true, but I guess it couldn't be, could it?
@KingConker64 We will have an update on your and her appearances in the game soon, okay?  (3/3)
@KingConker64 It doesn't at all mean that her character is retired, so there's a good chance she'll appear in @proj_spark. (2/3)
@KingConker64 In #BadFurDay, it sounded as though you wanted to bring @BerriAndConker back to life. (1/3)

@KingConker64 @proj_spark Okay, just wondering.  We will have an update on your arrival, @KingConker64, as soon as possible.
@KingConker64 @proj_spark Is there any information now as for an exact release date or launch window?
@proj_spark This is probably the most important question I need to ask you.  When is @KingConker64 coming to the game?
My condolences go out to the victims of the Marysville High School shooting and their friends and families.
Exciting news, Mewtwo fans!  Mewtwo himself is joining the battle in Super #SmashBros in Spring 2015!  Stay tuned for more information soon.
@gamespot One of the "50 new things" I hope will be a story mode with cutscenes, exclusive to this game.

@KingConker64 I just reserved my copy of #ProjectSpark at @GameStop and I look forward to seeing you and Berri return to life on October 7.

@Pokemon Mega Mawile.
@XboxP3 ...assuming hypothetically the 500 million figure is actually accurate. Here's a direct link:	http://t.co/iq7dMwIowL (5/5)
@XboxP3 I don't know, but it would require 10%+ of Nintendo's total cash reserves to be spent in order to complete the takeover... (4/5)
@XboxP3  ...that Nintendo would possibly have to pay to re-acquire @RareLtd . Is that considered a worthwhile investment for Nintendo? (3/5)
@XboxP3 Adjusting for inflation in 2014 dollar terms, it would equate to around somewhere close to the region of $500 million.. (2/5)

@Solarisltp You don't understand. I let @Sora_Sakurai know that the #WiiU version of #SmashBros feels empty without a story mode. (1/2)
@BrittMurphyDad I know this will hurt, but is there by any chance you want her back? That would be a problem. (2/2)
@BrittMurphyDad I'm glad you slammed the biopic and told the whole truth. It sounded as though you wanted to exhume her body. (1/2)

@Sora_Sakurai #Pacman Please! http://t.co/J2WqjV9GK1
@namcogames Since Smash Bros. is now supported by you guys @namcogames, I want you to ask Mr. Sakurai @Sora_Sakurai to put #PacMan in them.
@namcogames There is still a little time for all of us to support Pac-Man to join Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U, right?
@namcogames Millions of us want #PacMan in #SmashBros.  I would love it if you confirm Pac-Man to be a newcomer in Smash.  Can you please?
@SmashMiiverse You said that trophies would be exclusive to each version, and this is not a 3DS version trophy.  Phosphora's 3DS, not Wii U.
@Sora_Sakurai Waka-waka!  A new challenger eats in! http://t.co/G4zFbw55bl
@SmashMiiverse Thanks, Mr. Sakurai!  I'll request something regarding Wallpaper Games Maker soon.
@FlipnoteS3D This also means that it won't be released in March 2014 at all.(2/2)
@FlipnoteS3D It is with deep regret that I must inform you that nothing regarding #Flipnote Studio 3D was announced.  (1/2)
@SmashMiiverse #Yoshi would've been revealed today, too, if it weren't for that North American and European launch of #YoshisNewIsland...
http://t.co/nb3CAwnFj8
@SmashMiiverse The latest Pic of the day shows the Villager and Wii Fit Trainer fighting in a new stage from Tomodachi Collection: New Life.
@Sora_Sakurai You should've revealed #Yoshi to join the battle since #YoshisNewIsland launched today in North America and Europe.  (2/2)
@Sora_Sakurai @Kojima_Hideo would like to see Snake again in the upcoming Smash Bros, just so you know.  (1/2)
@namcogames I hope you will confirm Pac-Man for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U.  Here's a leaked image. http://t.co/wnOtSQ4pl0

@LowerMerionSD Are you once again going to make the Monday of Spring Break a school day?
@FlipnoteS3D I regret to inform you that Nintendo is unable to notify us on an official release date for #Flipnote Studio 3D.
@namcogames Please tell @Sora_Sakurai to celebrate the launch of Pac-Man Museum, and he'll confirm Pac-Man to join Smash Bros.  (3/3)
@namcogames Pac-Man Museum came out today, right?  (2/3)
@namcogames Fans, including me, are requesting Pac-Man to be in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U as a playable character.  (1/3)
@NintendoAmerica What's it like being able to use your cane to bounce on things unharmed?  That's pretty good for an elderly Kong like you.
@NintendoAmerica How did your wife, Wrinkly Kong, die after the events of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble?
@NintendoAmerica Aren't you a little old to join Donkey, Diddy, and Dixie to take back Donkey Kong Island from the Snomads?
@NintendoAmerica How did Wrinkly die and become a spirit?
@NintendoAmerica Cranky, are you really Donkey Kong's grandfather?
@Sora_Sakurai I'm currently suffering a cold as well.  I hope to get better soon.  Hope your injury gets better soon, too.
@Sora_Sakurai I had a dream last night that #PacMan will be joining the battle.  In that dream, I saw a trailer with him fighting #Sonic.
@Pokemon I just became the Pokemon League Champion, defeated AZ, and caught Mewtwo!  Isn't that great?
@GameStop Super Mario Land for the Game Boy in 1989.
@Sora_Sakurai I'm so sorry to hear about both of your arms injured.  Feel better soon!
@Sora_Sakurai I hope you have a safe and speedy recovery.  Sorry to hear about your injury getting worse and affecting your left arm.
@Sora_Sakurai I'm sorry to hear that your injury is getting worse and is now affecting your left arm.  Hope you recover soon!
@Sora_Sakurai Thank goodness you're using the controller gently.  Have a speedy recovery!
@Sora_Sakurai Get better soon, Mr. Sakurai!
@NintendoAmerica Thank you very much!
@Sora_Sakurai Mr. Sakurai, there's been a leaked image of Pac-Man.  I want you to be aware of the image.  Thank you! http://t.co/md1zH4qyWI
@Pokemon Thank you very much for the heads-up!
@haydenpanettier Have you ever heard of Jonathan Winters?  He was a true master of improvisational comedy.  He died this past April at 87.
@Sora_Sakurai I apologize for any inconvenience, hope you understand these rumors, and hope you confirm these four rumored characters. (3/3)
@Sora_Sakurai There was also one image with Mario fighting Lucina at a Fairy Isle on the Great Sea. (2/3)
@Sora_Sakurai I hate to alarm you, but there were rumors regarding Ness, Jigglypuff, Palutena, and Lucina. (1/3)
@Sora_Sakurai There's also been a leaked image with Mario fighting Lucina on a Fairy Isle in the Great Sea.
@Sora_Sakurai I hate to alarm you, but there have been leaked images with Ness, Jigglypuff, and now Palutena in them.
@NintendoAmerica Thank you very much!
@NintendoAmerica Thanks for the heads-up!
@Reggie_NOA Do you happen to know when #Flipnote Studio 3D will be released?
@GameStop Mario.
@Reggie_NOA Thanks for the heads-up!
In remeberance of Mrs. Karen Jones-Jenkins of Lower Merion School District, I will not be posting on social media channels today.
@NintendoAmerica @Pokemon Thanks for the heads up!
@NintendoAmerica Since the eShop is back online, can you give me a new release date for #Flipnote Studio 3D, please?  It's been so long.
@NintendoAmerica Now that the eShop is back online, can you give me more information on the launch of Pokemon Bank and Poke Transporter?
I'm completely devastated to learn about James Avery the actor's death.  RIP Uncle Phil.  There will never be another Phillip Banks.
@Sora_Sakurai What website did those movies you and your team work so hard on to create upload onto?
@NintendoAmerica Thank you so much.  I'll be in touch about when you'll give us a head's up on Pok√©mon Bank and Poke Transporter.
@NintendoAmerica I'm happy to report that I was finally able to access the Nintendo eShop on the Nintendo 3DS.
@NintendoAmerica I'm so glad you guys are working really hard to resolve these issues right now.  Thank you so much!
@NintendoAmerica However, I now have a NNID, which I now have a successful #WiiU and #Nintendo3DS #eShop combination.
@NintendoAmerica Tomorrow, you're supposed to release Pok√©mon Bank and Poke Transporter on the Nintendo 3DS eShop.
@NintendoAmerica How long will it take you to fix these online problems?
@NintendoAmerica I'm happy to report that I was able to get onto Miiverse.
@Reggie_NOA Reggie, I hate to alarm you, but I'm currently having trouble connecting to the Nintendo eShop.  Are there any suggestions?
@haydenpanettier Do you know Jonathan Winters?

@NintendoAmerica If you're going to VGX 2013 tomorrow, have a safe trip!
@NintendoAmerica Hi!	@FlipnoteS3D is currently demanding a release date for #Flipnote Studio 3D.  Can you give us a release date, please?
@NintendoAmerica When are you guys planning to launch #Flipnote Studio 3D?  A fellow member of Twitter is currently demanding a release date
@GameStop In 1981, Mario made his debut in the NES game, Donkey Kong, in which he had to rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong's clutches.
@NintendoAmerica Can you give us a release date for #Flipnote Studio 3D, please?
@Sora_Sakurai Why aren't there any more newcomers right now for Smash, other than Villager, Wii Fit Trainer, and Mega Man?
@SEGA Our condolences to all of the Bellfield family from all of us players, fans, and workers of SEGA.  #RIP Charles Bellfield.  So sad.
@SEGA #RIP Charles Bellfield.  You were such a great guy.  Thanks for everything and you will be missed.

@SEGA Zik
@NintendoAmerica You're-a Wario!  You're-a gonna win!  Wa-ha-ha!
@NintendoAmerica Can you give us a release date for Flipnote Studio 3D, please?
@NintendoAmerica Answer #4 on the photo above of Bill's gameplay of #NameThatFace on #WiiPartyU is my final answer, @NintendoAmerica.
@NintendoAmerica Because this is The Year of Luigi, I'm happy to report that I'm dressing up as Luigi for Halloween this year.
@Sora_Sakurai I want the Powerpuff Girls to join the battle in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U/Nintendo 3DS.  That would be really cool.
@Sora_Sakurai A fellow Miiverse member named Wesley wants the Powerpuff Girls to be in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U/3DS, Mr. Sakurai.
@GameStop I sure did.  Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Toadsworth, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi and Baby Wario are all voiced by Charles Martinet.
@NintendoAmerica I'd like to thank all of you for hosting this month's #NintendoDirectNA.  Happy Halloween!
@NintendoAmerica This December, will you host a #NintendoDirectNA?  If so, will it cover games for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS coming in 2014?
@NintendoAmerica I'm looking forward to Mario Golf: World Tour for Nintendo 3DS.  I hope you host a #NintendoDirect this coming December.
@NintendoAmerica Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour for Gamecube. My favorite course was Peach's Castle Grounds.
@GameStop Hi @GameStop!  Unfortunately, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze will now be released in February 2014.
@NintendoAmerica You know something?  The closer we wait, the harder it's going to be for you to release Mario Party: Island Tour.
@NintendoAmerica I have to tell you something about Mario Party: Island Tour.  Not much has been shown, so I suggest you delay it to 2014.
@NintendoAmerica In Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, will the unknown fourth playable character be Kiddy Kong?
@GameXplain Just so you know, there will be a #NintendoDirectNA tomorrow, so I hope you're looking forward to it.
@NintendoAmerica Tomorrow during the #NintendoDirectNA, can you give us new information on Mario Golf: World Tour, please?
@NintendoAmerica Can you let us know what the release date for Flipnote Studio 3D is, please?
@wiiudaily I entered to win in the @WiiUDaily Club Nintendo Elite Reward Giveaway #NicksStuff http://t.co/evqKBjh0WD
@GameStop Mario Party Island Tour, Super Mario 3D World, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, and Sonic Lost World.
@Sora_Sakurai Challenger Approaching! Toon Link joins the battle as a veteran!
@GameStop Sonic Lost World will now launch on October 29.  The Deadly Six will have to wait just a little longer...
@NintendoAmerica Can you give me a release date for Flipnote Studio 3D, please?
@NintendoAmerica As part of The Year of Luigi, I would consider Luigi himself a great dancer.  What do you guys think?
@NintendoAmerica When will you release Flipnote Studio 3D?
I'm completely devastated to learn of Hiroshi Yamauchi's death.  RIP Mr. Yamauchi.  Thanks for being there to help Nintendo grow.
@NintendoAmerica Summer ends this coming Saturday, September 21, 2013.  Can you give us a release date for Flipnote Studio 3D, please?
@GameStop Mario Party for the Nintendo 3DS will be titled Mario Party: Island Tour, which will be released on November 22, 2013.
@NintendoAmerica Who is your favorite Nintendo character while hosting #NintendoMinute?
@NintendoAmerica How long have you worked at Nintendo for?  Kit and Krysta, were you selected to host #NintendoMinute? Do you love Nintendo?
@Sora_Sakurai New Challenger Approaching!  Monster Hunter joins Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U!
@SEGA Amy Rose
@Sora_Sakurai While I was sleeping last night, I dreamed that The Powerpuff Girls (Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup) joined the battle.
@NintendoAmerica When are you going to release Flipnote Studio 3D?
@Sora_Sakurai I've just received word from Miiverse that you want only video game characters.  Have you ever heard of The Powerpuff Girls?
@Sora_Sakurai Are you sure that Namco Bandai characters have no priority in Super Smash Bros?  Do you like the Powerpuff Girls?
@Pokemon Staraptor
@Sora_Sakurai Are you a fan of The Powerpuff Girls, Mr. Sakurai?
@Sora_Sakurai You originally announced that ten Tekken characters will be in Smash Bros.  Who will you confirm?
@Sora_Sakurai Despite Namco Bandai helping you guys, you said that no third-party characters are just fit for Smash Bros.  Why?
@Sora_Sakurai Why did you remove the story mode from Smash Bros?  I was really looking forward to that!
@Sora_Sakurai Now that you confirmed Mega Man, I want to see the Powerpuff Girls (Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup), and Pac-Man.
@NintendoAmerica When is the release date for Flipnote Studio 3D?
@NintendoAmerica Gigantic Luigi saves the day!
@DisneyInfinity Three Disney movies, including Wreck-It Ralph himself, Disney!  Thank you, and have a nice day.
@DisneyInfinity I'm cheering for Sulley.
@DisneyInfinity I see Woody!
@GameStop Mario Golf: World Tour will now launch in 2014.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
@DisneyInfinity I spy Syndrome, Dash, and Agent P.
@Pokemon My favorite Water-type Pok√©mon is Piplup and Oshawott.
@Sora_Sakurai I want Pac-Man to be a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS since Namco Bandai is helping you.
@NintendoAmerica Why did you push back Mario Golf: World Tour to 2014?
@NintendoAmerica When is the release date for Mario Golf: World Tour?
@DisneyInfinity Monsters University.
@NintendoAmerica Nintendo eShop is #1!  Wahoo!  It even lets me download retro video games from the Virtual Console service.  Thank you!
@GameStop He made his very first appearance in 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game.
@animalcrossing I'm ready to get the game today, Isabelle.  I'll see you in the game with my customized character, okay?  Bye!

@animalcrossing That's right, Isabelle.  It would be neat if Gracie opened up a boutique in your town.  Puppies can dream too.  Bye!
@Sora_Sakurai I can't wait for the E3 Nintendo Direct!  Next week will be awesome since you would like to show us Smash Bros. 4.  Take care!
@animalcrossing That would be great, Isabelle!  Good luck with that.
@Pokemon James.

@Pokemon Prepare for trouble, make it double.  To protect the world from devastation.  To denounce the evils of truth and love.
@NintendoAmerica @animalcrossing Yes, because you can expand both your basement and house in the game, NoA.
@NintendoAmerica I love Nintendo eShop!
@Sora_Sakurai How's your arm doing?  No major press conference at E3 2013.  I'm so excited for you to show us Smash Bros 4.  See you at E3!
@animalcrossing Thank you for keeping us updated, Isabelle!  Good luck to you!

@animalcrossing My weekend was wonderful, Isabelle.  Thank you so much for asking!
Some of my new customers are really excited for this game, you know.  Wah-ha-ha!  Thank you!
@NintendoAmerica You know what would be great?  How about if you release Mario Golf: World Tour on July 21, 2013.  How about it, Nintendo?
@NintendoAmerica When will you release Mario Golf: World Tour for Nintendo 3DS?
@Sora_Sakurai I have some bad news.  I might be experiencing RSI, too.  I'm going to have to rest my wrist and hand so it could heal.
@Sora_Sakurai How was the local multiplayer mode in Super Smash Bros. Brawl?
@NintendoAmerica My mom loves to play Mario Party.  Her favorite character in the Mario series is Toadette.  She loves her ponytails, too.
@NintendoAmerica We all know that you will be releasing Mario Golf: World Tour this summer.  Can you give us a release date, please?
@NintendoAmerica I would eat pasta and pizza because they are some of my favorite foods, you know.
@SEGA I love Amy Rose!
@SEGA Amy
@SEGA Knuckles
@Sora_Sakurai That photo is really cool.  We'll see you at E3 2013 when you show us both Wii U and Nintendo 3DS versions of Smash 4, okay?
@e3expo That's really awesome, E3 staff.  To express my excitement, I can't wait for Smash Bros., Mario Kart, and 3D Mario. See you then!
@NintendoAmerica What will the suggested Nintendo eShop price for this game be?
@SEGA Hot Dog
@GameStop Mario and Luigi: Dream Team will be releasing on August 11, 2013.  Just wanted to give you a heads-up on the game.
@NintendoAmerica I think Chase is made of 9,000 bricks.
@NintendoAmerica Mario Golf World Tour is coming this summer.  How about if you release the game on July 21, 2013?  What do you guys think?
@NintendoAmerica Will you host a Nintendo Direct sometime this month of April 2013?  Please let us know.
@Sora_Sakurai I have a rumor concerning Smash Bros. 4.  I want the Joker, Mega Man, Pac-Man, Powerpuff Girls, and Lotso.  How many of these?
@NintendoAmerica Yes I am.
@NintendoAmerica @Konami I am entering to win a Nintendo 3DS XL with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Nintendo.  Can you pick me?
@Sora_Sakurai GDC 2013 had just gotten started.  Mr. Sakurai, if you want to, can you show us screenshots of Super Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS?
@Sora_Sakurai Tomorrow, GDC 2013 starts.  Mr. Sakurai, if you can, can you give us new info on Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS?
@Sora_Sakurai GDC 2013 will be in a couple weeks.  Mr. Sakurai, if Nintendo will host their conference there, can you show us Smash Bros. 4?
@Sora_Sakurai Because the Nintendo 3DS is a handheld console, the new Smash Bros. game on that console is very hard for you to control.
@Sora_Sakurai I'm so glad you're still in good shape to work on Smash Bros. Wii U and 3DS.  However, the 3DS isn't too easy for your injury.
@Sora_Sakurai I know the 3DS version of Smash Bros. is not that easy for your injury.  Why don't you use a 3DS Stand?  That might be easier.
@Sora_Sakurai I hope you have a speedy recovery from your injured right arm.  Players, please note that he will show us Smash at E3.  Thanks
@Sora_Sakurai I can't wait for you to show both versions of Super Smash Bros. at E3 2013.  But please be patient while your injury heals.
@Sora_Sakurai I'm begging you to put your injured right arm in a cast right now so you can get back to working on the new Smash Bros.
@Sora_Sakurai What I'm not happy about is that the Nintendo 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. 4 ain't easy for you're right hand.
@Sora_Sakurai We're all so glad that you realized how your health is important to you.  I'm glad that you're still in good shape to work.
@Sora_Sakurai I just found out that your arm injury impacts your work on Smash Bros for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.  I hope you get better soon!
@Sora_Sakurai I just found out that your arm injury impacts your work new Smash Bros.  I hope you get better soon, Mr. Sakurai!
@Sora_Sakurai There is a Nintendo Direct at 9AM ET for upcoming Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games.  Mr. Sakurai, can you show us new Smash Bros.?
@e3expo Did you know you are also going to show footage on the new Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS this year?
@Sora_Sakurai How many newcomers are  you going to add to Smash Bros. 4?
@Sora_Sakurai I heard you're going to show us Smash Bros. 4 at E3 2013.  That is just so cool.  Thank you!
@Sora_Sakurai Hopefully as you said the day will come for you to feel better.  You still need to work on Smash Bros. 4, remember?
@Sora_Sakurai I just found out that you're suffering from repetitive stress injury in your right hand.  I hope you get better soon!
@Sora_Sakurai Tomorrow, there will be a Nintendo Direct based on upcoming games for the Wii U.  Mr. Sakurai, can you show us Smash Bros. 4?
@Sora_Sakurai So you decided to cut down right here on Twitter, huh?  In that case, let's just wait a while longer for Smash Bros. 4.
@Sora_Sakurai Again, I have a rumorSmash Bros. Wii U/3DS.  I would like to have Mega Man, Superman, and Powerpuff Girls.  What do you think?
@Sora_Sakurai I have another rumor concerning Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS.  I would like to have Lotso from Toy Story 3 in it.
@Sora_Sakurai I have a rumor concerning Smash Bros. 4 (Wii U/3DS).  I would like to have Snake and Sonic in the game again.  Also, Pac-Man.
@Sora_Sakurai I would really like you to release an announcement trailer for Super Smash Bros. 4 (Wii U/3DS) starting December 23, 2012.
@Sora_Sakurai I really like that picture of Link and Pit fighting each other.  Can you give me a photo of other characters too please?
@Sora_Sakurai So what do you think?  I say Pac-Man, Mega Man, and the Powerpuff Girls will be in Smash Bros. 4. What do you think?  All 5?
@Sora_Sakurai I have a rumor concerning Super Smash Bros 4.  Pac-Man Mega Man and Powerpuff Girls should be in it.  I prove this rumor true.
@Sora_Sakurai I would like you to show us some photos and a trailer for Super Smash Bros. 4 (Wii U/3DS).  That would be in three weeks.
@Sora_Sakurai I want you and your team to release an announcement trailer for Super Smash Bros. 4.  Starting December 23 okay?
@Sora_Sakurai I need you to give us a trailer for Super Smash Bros. 4 (Wii U/3DS).  And I also want Pac-Man and Shadow the Hedgehog in it.
@Sora_Sakurai I am still being patient for Smash Bros. 4.  Please show me some footage about it if you can write your tweet in English.
@Sora_Sakurai I think Super Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS should be released holiday 2013, so what do you think?  Is that okay with you?
@Sora_Sakurai Super Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS should be called " Super Smash Bros. X Namco Bandai" and have even more non-Nintendo characters.
@Sora_Sakurai I am still being patient for Super Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS.  Can you give me a few photos about the game, please?
@Sora_Sakurai Right now, I am being very patient for Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS to come out.  Can you show me a trailer or something like that?
@Sora_Sakurai You are telling us that Smash Bros. 4 for the 3DS will have retro characters, while Wii U will have more modern characters.
@Sora_Sakurai We all know that we have to wait a while for Super Smash Bros. 4, but can't you just show us something about the game now?
@Sora_Sakurai 		You are showing me a Nintendo 3DS there in your auditorium.  Is this Kid Icarus Uprising or the new Smash Bros. 3DS/Wii U?
@Sora_Sakurai 	You are telling us that you're adding new characters to the next Smash Bros. because it's fun.  Can you show us details now?
We know you recognized the need to narrow down third-party characters, but how many will you put in?
Which new characters are going to be in the new Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo	3DS?  When will you release an announcement trailer?
Would you like to show us some new, solid details about the next Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS?  If so, that will be great.
When will Super Smash Bros. Wii U and Nintendo 3DS be released?  I really like that whiteboard drawing you posted here.
Super Smash Bros. X Tekken X Soulcaliber X Pac-Man.  It should have a lot more third-party characters like Pac-Man and more Final Smashes.
We are all so glad you are adding more characters, Mr. Sakurai!  Can you give us some new details about Super Smash Bros. 4 soon?
@Sora_Sakurai I really want to know how you are making out with the next Super Smash Bros. game(s) for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.
