Once the Senate passes this legislation and puts us on a path to reopening government, President @realDonaldTrump must come to his senses and immediately sign it into law. #TrumpShutdown
It would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they supported two weeks ago. #TrumpShutdown
If @SenateMajLdr McConnell and Senate Republicans refuse to support the first bill, then they are complicit with President @realDonaldTrump in continuing the #TrumpShutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers‚Äô paychecks hostage over the wall.
The second bill would extend the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs funding through February 8th, which Republicans already supported in recent weeks. #TrumpShutdown
The first bill would reopen all government agencies except for the Department of Homeland Security‚Äînot taking a position on the President‚Äôs wall. It would simply continue the funding levels and language that both parties have already supported. #TrumpShutdown
The President is using the government shutdown to try and force an expensive and ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown. #TrumpShutdown
The Democrats‚Äô legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown reopens government services, ensures workers get the paychecks they‚Äôve earned, and restores certainty to the lives of the American people.
While President @realDonaldTrump drags the nation into Week Two of the #TrumpShutdown and sits in the White House and tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess. https://t.co/velSjEBxyj

The President wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it. As long as the President is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, it‚Äôs hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his #TrumpShutdown.
Meanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the President would accept or not accept to end his #TrumpShutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment.
Instead of bringing certainty into people‚Äôs lives, he‚Äôs continuing the #TrumpShutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts.

Hey @realDonaldTrump, we were promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. 100%. https://t.co/tEtOdMeNDT
Since Mr. Barr hasn‚Äôt been formally nominated yet, the president must immediately reconsider and find another nominee who is free of conflicts and will carry out the duties of the office impartially.
The fact that he holds these deeply misguided views and chose to launch them in an unprovoked written attack on the Special Counsel unquestionably disqualifies Mr. Barr from serving as Attorney General again.
Mr. Barr believes presidents in general‚Äîand more frighteningly, President Trump, who has shown less respect for rule of law than any president‚Äîare above the law.
William Barr‚Äôs memo to the Department of Justice criticizing the Special Counsel investigation reveals that he is fatally conflicted from being able to oversee the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation and he should not be nominated to be Attorney General.
The American people know the president‚Äôs wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters‚Äîcertainly not worth a government shutdown.
It‚Äôs good that our Republican colleagues in the Senate finally realized that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country.

I commend Senators Blumenthal, Hirono, and Whitehouse for bringing this important lawsuit and shining a bright light on the president‚Äôs unconstitutional appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.
Thomas Farr must not be confirmed to a lifetime appointment as a Federal Judge in North Carolina. It‚Äôs hard to believe President Trump nominated him, and it‚Äôs even harder to believe the Senate Republicans are considering it again.
Farr appealed to the United States Supreme Court which also rejected his arguments and affirmed the District Court‚Äôs ruling. https://t.co/dgcYVY890y
The court held that ‚Äúrace predominated in both‚Äù congressional districts and that the 2011 redistricting ‚Äúaffected North Carolina citizens' fundamental right to vote, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.‚Äù https://t.co/5HhwT5qoh5
Farr argued that plaintiffs had ‚Äúfailed to demonstrate that race was the ‚Äòpredominant factor‚Äô used by the General Assembly in drawing‚Äù the two congressional districts. A U.S. District Court rejected Farr‚Äôs arguments.
In Harris v. McCrory, yet another challenge to NC‚Äôs 2011 redistricting plan, the plaintiffs alleged that the NC legislature violated the 14th Amendment when it used race as the predominant consideration with respect to two congressional districts redrawn after the 2010 census.
Although the NC Supreme Court agreed with Farr, the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately vacated the state court‚Äôs judgment. They remanded the decision in light of Harris v. McCrory/Cooper v. Harris. What did this decision say?
In his arguments, Farr dismissed the challenges as politically motivated and argued that NC had a compelling interest ‚Äúin preemptively factoring race into its redistricting process‚Äù to avoid liability under the Voting Rights Act.
In 2014, Farr represented NC in Dickson v. Rucho, a case in which both the legislative and the congressional plans in the state‚Äôs 2011 redistricting were challenged as impermissible racial gerrymanders.
In their rejection, the court held the districts unconstitutional, citing ‚Äúcopious statewide evidence‚Äù that ‚Äúrace was the predominant criterion in drawing all of the challenged districts.‚Äù The decision was later affirmed by the Supreme Court. https://t.co/u4u4c3bZ7X
In Covington v. NC, Farr argued that race was not the primary factor used in the redistricting. And even if it was, Farr argued the NC legislature‚Äôs use of race was reasonably necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The trial court rejected this argument.
In 2016-17, Farr represented NC in Covington v. NC, a challenge to the state‚Äôs 2011 legislative redistricting alleging each of NC‚Äôs 19 state House districts &amp; 9 state Senate districts constituted a racial gerrymander violating the Equal Protection Clause. https://t.co/fgf3qJhp6C
Hard to believe Senate Republicans are trying again to vote on the nomination of Thomas Farr as a federal judge in NC. Farr's represented the NC legislature in not 1, not 2, but 3 challenges to the state‚Äôs 2011 congressional and legislative redistricting. Here‚Äôs how that went:
We‚Äôre more than happy to vote on Mueller and the Special Counsel investigation. If that‚Äôs what you want, tell Senator McConnell to send a bill protecting Mueller to the Senate floor! https://t.co/j8Q27MUE8R
Whitaker still refuses to say if he‚Äôll recuse from Special Counsel investigation &amp; we haven‚Äôt even seen his public financial disclosures? Ethics in Government Act requires him to disclose publicly.	 	How can anyone trust him to enforce the law if he refuses to follow it himself? https://t.co/QxBtz7ITcS
President Trump should not roll over on trade with China, on protecting intellectual property and letting American firms compete. If we cannot come to an agreement, Trump should not cave to the doves in his Administration who'd continue allowing China to steal our jobs &amp; wealth.

Said it last time @SenateGOP tried to vote on Thomas Farr‚Äôs nomination as a federal judge. Saying it again now:		Farr has shown he's willing to defend the most strident attempts by NC Republicans to make it more difficult for minorities to vote.		I strongly oppose his nomination. https://t.co/UfVWS9WvSh
Every American should be alarmed by the attempt to confirm a nominee with Farr‚Äôs egregious record on voting rights, particularly with the Republican agenda to maintain power by limiting access to the ballot now on full display.
The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Farr‚Äôs arguments finding instead that North Carolina‚Äôs laws work to "target African Americans with almost surgical precision" and "impose cures for problems that did not exist." https://t.co/j7Y7qHFKTZ
In a lawsuit brought by several groups challenging the law, Farr defended North Carolina and argued that the voter ID provision in particular was not problematic.
In addition to reducing early-voting days &amp; eliminating same-day registration and preregistration of teenage voters, the North Carolina Legislature also implemented strict voter ID laws requiring voters to show certain photo IDs which African-Americans disproportionately lacked.
After gathering data on the use of certain voting practices broken down by race, the North Carolina Legislature drafted a law that targeted voting practices like early voting and same-day registration that were disproportionately utilized by African-American voters.
Farr defended the Republican-controlled North Carolina Legislature in a challenge to the restrictive voting laws it enacted shortly after the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, gutted the Voting Rights Act.
RED ALERT: I'm announcing my strong opposition to Thomas Farr as a federal judge in North Carolina. @SenateGOP has set up a vote on his nomination after Thanksgiving.	 	Farr is a serious threat to voting rights. Americans need to tell Senate Republicans to block this nomination.
I hope this story isn‚Äôt true. It was a bad idea when General Flynn proposed it, and it‚Äôs still a bad idea.	 	U.S. residents should not be used as pawns to appease foreign leaders who flout the rule of law.	 	@realDonaldTrump should confirm that this will not happen.

What we know about President Trump‚Äôs Health Care agenda: 		He supports letting employers impose lifetime &amp; annual limits on critical types of health care. That means coverage could be cut off just when you get sick &amp; need it most. 		But isn‚Äôt that the whole point of health care?

Just last week, Leader McConnell flat out admitted that Republicans will try to take away health care from Americans, and said that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security must be cut to offset the cost of tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest few.
It's hard to take the Trump administration and Republicans seriously about reducing health care costs for seniors when they have repeatedly advocated for and implemented policies that strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence. https://t.co/vxqRaUvu53
It is simply not true that Republicans will protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, Mr. President.
And, Senator McConnell said he wanted to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for the Republican tax cuts for corporations.

Just last week, Senator McConnell said he supports the Republican lawsuit‚Äîbacked by your administration‚Äîthat would get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions.

No amount of revisionism or protestations to the contrary can cover up the fact that Republicans are putting the health insurance companies first and leaving American families out to dry.
Today is yet another step in the GOP‚Äôs effort to tear down our health care system, leading to higher health care costs for millions of families, particularly those with pre-existing conditions.
Today, the administration plainly admitted its intention is to use taxpayer dollars to fund junk insurance plans that don‚Äôt cover pre-existing conditions, which could lead to medical bankruptcy for many American families in order to pad the pockets of health insurance executives.
Republicans are once again undermining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and sabotaging our health care system.

They promised the tax cuts for corporations would pay for themselves.	Then they blew a $2 trillion hole in the deficit.	And now they‚Äôre coming for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.	But don‚Äôt take my word for it.	Listen to the Republicans themselves: https://t.co/GGG1EMpIqT
The contrast with the Democratic platform on health care could not be starker: Republicans want Americans to pay more for less care, Democrats believe every American should have better, more affordable health care.
In recent days, Leader McConnell has also made clear that Republicans would attempt to repeal the health care law and may pursue cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid to address a deficit they ballooned.
Leader McConnell has made it crystal clear that Republicans are for eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions.
Seriously, do the Republicans think no one will notice their reverse Robin Hood plan? They plan to take money from the middle class and give it to the corporations. https://t.co/VTXLlOeznh

Under this Republican President and this Republican Congress, Americans are paying more to get less health insurance, and protections for pre-existing conditions are under assault. #NoJunkPlans
As a result of Republican sabotage: premiums are up, out-of-pocket costs are up, prescription drug costs are up, and insurance is covering less. #NoJunkPlans
Ever since taking control of Congress and the presidency, Republicans have deliberately and relentlessly undermined Americans‚Äô health care. #NoJunkPlans
Even worse, these plans draw consumers out of the health insurance marketplace, making it more expensive for everyone to purchase insurance, especially more expensive for those with a pre-existing condition. #NoJunkPlans
These junk plans bait consumers in with low prices but hardly cover anything. They could not cover maternity care, or mental health care, or prescription drugs, you name it. #NoJunkPlans

And finally, to say that this investigation exonerates Judge Kavanaugh, or to say that this is a complete investigation, is patently false. Chairman Grassley‚Äôs claim that there is no hint of misconduct in these documents is just not true.
Third, it appears very clearly to me that the FBI was severely limited in which questions they could ask and which leads they could follow.
Second, Judge Kavanaugh stated at his hearing that the individuals at the incident involving Dr. Ford refuted her version of events. From their own public statements, we knew that to be false, and nothing in this report changes that.
After reviewing the additional background check documents on Judge Kavanaugh, four things are crystal clear.		First, the documents raise even more serious doubts in my mind about Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs truthfulness.
I will always stand with the @3407Families. Since they fought to secure safety regulations after the tragic 2009 Buffalo crash, there have been no major commercial airline accidents in the U.S. The FAA Reauthorization that passed the Senate today keeps these protections intact.
Anyone watching Dr. Blasey Ford saw a credible, courageous woman who elected to relive the worst night of her life because she felt a civic duty to come forward.		President Trump‚Äôs mockery of a sexual assault survivor was reprehensible. He owes Dr. Blasey Ford an apology.
It is cruel and discriminatory that the Trump administration is denying visas to unmarried, same-sex partners of foreign diplomats and @UN employees. The majority of countries still ban same-sex marriage. What purpose does it serve to force partners from these countries to leave?

If our Republican colleagues are so certain of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs story, they should immediately demand that the White House order the FBI to reopen the background investigation, and hold off on a vote for several days so all the facts can come out.
While I strongly believe Dr. Ford, the way to clear this up would be to have the FBI reopen the investigation, actually interview potential witnesses, and get to the truth before the Senate is required to vote on whether to elevate Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony was courageous, difficult to hear, and grounded in the facts. Judge Kavanaugh was angry, defiant, and partisan.

If the Republicans believe these two men, they should call both of them to testify and refer their names to the Montgomery County District Attorney. If they don‚Äôt, we‚Äôll know it‚Äôs just an attempt to undermine Dr. Ford and ‚Äúplow right through‚Äù with the nomination.

If our Republican colleagues proceed without an investigation, it would be a travesty for the honor of the Supreme Court and our country.
I strongly believe Judge Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration. If he will not, at the very least, the hearing and vote should be postponed while the FBI investigates all of these allegations.
There are now multiple, corroborated allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, made under the penalty of perjury, all of which deserve a thorough investigation.
Given the latest allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Republicans need to immediately suspend the proceedings related to his nomination, and the president must order the FBI to reopen the background check investigation.
Leader McConnell owes an apology to Dr. Ford for labeling her allegations a ‚Äúsmear job.‚Äù And he should apologize to her immediately. We must respect these women and Judge Kavanaugh by handling these allegations with the seriousness that they deserve. https://t.co/roA9BQT5gD https://t.co/qVqy0pd4ag
If President Trump and Senate Republicans are so certain the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh aren‚Äôt true, then why are they blocking the FBI from reopening the background check and investigating‚Äîa routine practice for judicial nominees? 		What are they hiding?
There is only one way to get to the bottom of these allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and prevent the nation from being thrown into further turmoil: an independent background check investigation by the FBI.
Dr. Ford says she can testify Thursday, but Republicans can‚Äôt wait that long. What is 1 extra day for serious allegations and a lifetime appointment? They clearly don‚Äôt want a hearing, like they don‚Äôt want an FBI investigation.

Dr. Ford‚Äôs life has already been badly disrupted by death threats and other intimidation. She deserves to be treated with respect and fairness by the Senate.
Senate Republicans and the White House should drop their inexplicable opposition to an FBI investigation, allow all the facts to come out, and then proceed with a fair process in the Senate.
Dr. Ford‚Äôs call for the FBI to investigate also demonstrates her confidence that when all the facts are examined by an impartial investigation, her account will be further corroborated and confirmed.
I strongly support Dr. Ford‚Äôs call for an FBI investigation before a hearing is held. An immediate FBI investigation is not only consistent with precedent, it is also quite clearly the right thing to do.
The FBI tells us that the White House needs to direct them to re-open their background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. Now, the White House is saying it is up to the FBI. What are they trying to hide? https://t.co/CVEuPeLyNo
Chairman Grassley's announced hearing on Judge Kavanaugh is a small step: It has to be done right. It can‚Äôt be rushed. There must be witnesses. The FBI should be given time to re-open its background investigation. And Senators must have the necessary information before a vote.

We need the FBI to step forward and ensure that the Senate and American public have complete information about this troubling alleged incident before a hearing is held.
Instead of having the FBI investigate these serious allegations as part of the standard background investigation process, the White House has intentionally chosen to bury its head in the sand and make weak excuses.		https://t.co/2dsl2pFAhS
I believe Professor Ford. If the FBI conducts a thorough investigation and the American people hear from her and Judge Kavanaugh, I think a majority of senators will find her credible.	 	Thanks to @theview for having me on today to have this very important discussion. https://t.co/A3QAvFPBq9
Senate Republicans ran a transparently partisan confirmation process and then immediately insinuated Prof Ford is being untruthful. They cannot impartially investigate these disturbing allegations. That must be done by the FBI, and the vote must be postponed until it is complete.
To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court.
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs credibility has already been seriously questioned because of his answers regarding Manny Miranda, Judge Pryor, and other issues during his time in the Bush White House, and now his credibility is even more suspect.
Re: WaPo report on Judge Kavanaugh, Sen Grassley must postpone vote until, at a very minimum, these serious &amp; credible allegations are thoroughly investigated.		For too long,when women have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored.That cannot happen in this case.

On questions where Judge Kavanaugh felt he had something positive to say abt himself or his record, he responded. On every other Q - incl those abt women's constitutional rights, unchecked pres power, &amp; protections for people with pre existing conditions - he simply stonewalled.
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs responses to follow up questions from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee is just another exercise in selective secrecy.
The new executive order certainly does not absolve the Senate from passing much-needed legislation and funding to beef up our election security and prevent future attacks on our democracy from foreign adversaries.

The extent of these misstatements is extremely disturbing, and this is what we‚Äôve found in only the small portion of his record Republicans have released. Given what we‚Äôve heard this week, they should immediately release the rest of his White House records.
Fifth, the judge appears to have misled us regarding what he knew about emails stolen from the Senate Dems by a Republican operative.  The judge claims he didn‚Äôt knew they were stolen, but that seems increasingly implausible. 		See Sen Leahy‚Äôs explanation: https://t.co/QGLr4si8m0
Fourth, Judge Kavanaugh said that he didn‚Äôt personally work on the extremely controversial nomination of Judge William Pryor, but new records tell a different story.  Dozens of emails show Judge Kavanaugh was personally involved.		@washingtonpost explains:	https://t.co/1rVRGIkC1T
Third, Judge Kavanaugh claimed that he only learned of President Bush‚Äôs warrantless surveillance program when it became public, but an email suggests he knew about a memo providing the justification for the White House‚Äôs authorization of the program.
Second, Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly denied knowledge of the Bush Administration‚Äôs policy on detention and interrogation of combatants. But emails released this week indicate that he had meetings on the subject, reviewed talking points, and opined on legal strategy.
For example, a document produced for the Committee shows that Kavanaugh was told about the fact that a potential nominee for the Fifth Circuit was ‚Äúpro-life.‚Äù	https://t.co/Ey8LrhKqkP
First, in his 2004 hearing, he told Sen Feinstein that the WH didn‚Äôt know about potential judicial nominees‚Äô views on abortion in the vast majority of cases. But recently released emails show that he was often told about &amp; discussed nominees‚Äô views and ideology, including on Roe.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Judge Kavanaugh has misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in a number of ways. This should raise immediate red flags for all Senators and the American public.
Today‚Äôs @nytimes editorial perfectly sums up Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs  confirmation hearings: Judge Kavanaugh can‚Äôt be trusted.	https://t.co/kak64zONoH
The most interesting part of these hearings may have been in what Judge Kavanaugh declined to do ‚Äì pledge to uphold Roe or Casey, defend those with pre-existing conditions, or reassure the country that he will be willing to hold President Trump accountable.
Instead of answering questions, Judge Kavanaugh spent 30 hours dodging questions and saying as little as possible, despite the fact that the president has vastly overreached his power and promised to appoint a Justice that would overturn Roe v. Wade.
This week, Judiciary Committee Democrats were able to shine a bright light - for the American people &amp; Republican Senators to see - on Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs troubling views on women‚Äôs rights, presidential power, and protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

This new legislation would ban the often misleadingly called ‚Äúright to work‚Äù state laws that undermine worker freedoms. It would also prevent employers from interfering in union elections and strengthen penalties on employers that break the law.

As @paulkrugman writes, ‚ÄúGDP numbers have been good in recent quarters, but much of the growth has gone to soaring corporate profits, while median real wages have gone nowhere.‚Äù	 	Our new bill will help present a clear &amp; accurate picture of who the economy is really working for.
When we hear that GDP is rising &amp; the economy is booming, there‚Äôs an implication that all are Americans are reaping the benefits equally ‚Äì yet the reality is that wages for middle-class workers remain flat &amp; the income inequality gap continues to worsen.

Relying solely on GDP numbers as a bellwether for how Americans are faring in the economy is a mistake. That's why @MartinHeinrich &amp; I proposed new bill to require the Feds to report how growth is distributed across the income spectrum - alongside quarterly GDP reports.
Pres. Trump promised American workers a $4,000 raise, instead he blew up the deficit to give a tax cut that pads the pockets of the wealthiest Americans and the executives at the biggest corporations.
No amount of @realDonaldTrump tweets can change fact that real wages are declining; while cost of living‚Äì esp gas prices &amp; health care costs, thanks in large part to GOP &amp; Trump Admin‚Äìare continuing to climb, &amp; families are struggling to choose which basic necessities to pay for.

I hope that many, if not most or all, will join because @SenJohnMcCain was a dear friend to all of us and a great American, great senator, a great man.		Let his name be an example to future generations, as his service and character were to every one of us.
Today, I am circulating a letter with Senator Flake asking all of our colleagues if they‚Äôd be willing to join us in a resolution to officially rename the Russell Building the McCain Building.
We can honor him by trying to carry on the principles he lived by. We can try, as he did, to put country before party. We can try, as he did, to speak truth to power. &amp; we can try,as he summoned us to try,to restore the Senate to its rightful place in our national political life.
So that future generations will study his example, I‚Äôve proposed that we rename the Russell Senate Office Building, one of only three Senate office buildings, after John McCain.		But it need not be the only way we honor Senator McCain.
I will miss him dearly. In the past year of his illness, during moments of doubt about the direction of our country, I found myself thinking about what John McCain would do or say if he were here.
Remarking on the character of America, @SenJohnMcCain said that we live in a ‚Äúbig, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, restless, striving, daring, brave, good and magnificent country.‚Äù Truer words could not be said about the man himself.
He was all of those things throughout his life, usually more than one at once, until the very last of his days.
He was unafraid to take on presidents, &amp; he was unafraid to take on his own party. He was equal parts funny &amp; furious, foul-mouthed &amp; statesmanlike. He could put the temper in temperament. He was a brave and honest man. He was a patriot.
He was so many things to so many people. A fierce friend to those who were lucky enough to have earned his friendship. A real thorn in the side of those who earned his scorn. An unofficial ambassador for the US, a comfort to our allies &amp; an unabashed champion for Western values.
I can truly say that the time we spent together authoring and passing immigration reform were some of my proudest days in politics, in no small part because the success was shared with @SenJohnMcCain.
On Saturday, August 25th, 2018, nine years to the day since the death of his friend Senator Kennedy, our friend and colleague Senator John S. McCain passed away.
Further, these documents aren't the official National Archives‚Äô curation of White House docs, but the ones that have been pre-screened by Kavanaugh‚Äôs former deputy and George Bush‚Äôs private lawyer. The Senate will likely have ZERO records from the Archives by next week‚Äôs hearing.
This is new. Sen Grassley now admitting the Senate will only receive half the documents that he requested (~900k), before the hearing starts. That means Senators will have seen only 6% of Kavanaugh‚Äôs records, &amp; the public will have seen 3%.	 	This is unprecedented secrecy. https://t.co/mbb3DhlrsS

Lastly, this bill also doesn‚Äôt change fact that if the GOP lawsuit were successful, premiums would soar for millions of families, hundreds of millions of ppl would lose major pre-ex conditions protections, seniors‚Äô drug costs would go up &amp; the individual markets would collapse.
This bill also doesn't change the Republican plan to expand ‚Äújunk plans", which put insurance companies back in charge, allowing them to refuse to cover vital services like Rx drugs, maternity care, emergency room services &amp; substance use disorders.
The GOP-led lawsuit ‚Äì which, again, the Republicans don‚Äôt oppose - would also strike down Medicaid expansion, tax credits and premium subsidies and more.
Nothing in this GOP bill states that Republicans oppose the lawsuit to gut protections for pre-existing conditions.		If the lawsuit - which Rs don‚Äôt oppose - is successful, the entire ACA would be struck down, including requirements that all plans cover Essential Health Benefits.
This Republican bill does nothing to require insurers to cover vital health care services. Bill essentially says if you have cancer, your insurance plan doesn‚Äôt have to offer cancer care.		What kind of ‚Äúpre-existing condition protection‚Äù is that? https://t.co/FquMzcm9D4

More must be done and Democrats are committed to working to give the American people a better deal on child care.
While some in GOP suggest that trying to make child care more affordable is an undue burden on taxpayers, Democrats disagree. That's why we've made providing access to child care was one of our top priorities.
Democrats know that access to affordable child care means a great deal to America‚Äôs working families, and for far too long Congress has not done its part to help offset the costs. Democrats are fighting to change this.
Increasing funding to make child care more affordable for Americans is one of our party‚Äôs top priorities and so I fought hard for this in the bipartisan budget deal that we crafted last year.

The price of the Republicans' Faustian bargain has already become too steep. Considerations of country &amp; constitution aside, if my Republican colleagues remain silent, the Republican Party is a co-conspirator in the culture of corruption that surrounds this president.
The mantra of the Republican majority in the 115th Congress might be ‚Äúput your head in the sand.‚Äù
At some point, after the Access Hollywood tape, Charlottesville, Helsinki summit, &amp; now after these most recent revelations, the broad failure of Republicans in Congress to condemn the president‚Äôs behavior becomes a form of complicity.
The president was alleged to be an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal crime. What did we hear from Republicans on the Hill? Was this the moment when Republican leaders finally stood up and said ‚Äòenough‚Äô? Nope.

The next SCOTUS Justice will have immense influence over the lives of Americans for generations to come. Unfortunately, Kavanaugh was either unwilling or unable to state that he wouldn't upend centuries of precedent &amp; disturb well-established rights of the American people.
And on the issue of executive power, Judge Kavanaugh would not say that the President must comply with a subpoena or provide records.
A similar pattern played out on other key issues. I repeatedly asked him to reassure me that he believes the Affordable Care Act and the vital protections for pre-existing conditions to be constitutional. He refused to do so.
Judge Kavanaugh had a special obligation to make his views on this topic clear, given the president‚Äôs litmus test that he would only appoint justices who would overturn Roe. On that obligation, Judge Kavanaugh failed spectacularly. #WhatsAtStake
Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether or not he agreed Roe v Wade &amp; Planned Parenthood v Casey were correctly decided or assure me he believed these cases should be left alone		That should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom for women

Republicans are making an unprecedented effort to keep hidden Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs records from the American public, and even the large majority of Senators. This is a new and astonishing level of secrecy. What are they hiding? #WhatsAtStake

If the Senate‚Äôs constitutional duty to advise and consent is just as important as the President‚Äôs right to nominate, as Leader McConnell also reminded us, why should a midterm election be any less important than a presidential election?

My @SenateGOP colleagues should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a SCOTUS nominee in an election year. Sen McConnell would tell anyone who listened that the Senate had the right to advise &amp; consent, &amp; that was every bit as important as POTUS‚Äô right to nominate.
The Senate should reject anyone who will instinctively side with powerful special interests over the interests of average Americans.
Will Republicans &amp; @realDonaldTrump nominate &amp; vote for someone who will preserve protections for people w/ preexisting conditions, or will they support a justice who will put health insurance companies over patients, or put the federal government between a woman &amp; her doctor?

It may be the GOP‚Äôs 6 mo anniversary, but remember what @realDonaldTrump promised the American people? He said the Republican tax bill would give a $4,000 raise for the average American family. Spoiler: it hasn‚Äôt. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/X0YANf5wG0
If you look at the numbers, corporations are reaping record profits as a result of the #GOPTaxScam, but that savings isn‚Äôt really being passed onto their workers. https://t.co/NEjSnC2xRe
Since the beginning of 2018, corporations have announced plans to repurchase more than $480 billion in stock buybacks. Meanwhile, the @washingtonpost reported that ‚Äúwages aren‚Äôt just flat, they are falling‚Äù for the largest group of American workers. https://t.co/II7oKuMalt
6 mos ago, in the dead of night, the GOP jammed thru the #GOPTaxScam lavishing tax cuts on big corps &amp; the wealthiest few. @realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP promised this would help the middle class, &amp; even give families $4K more in their pockets. But the tax law has failed to deliver.
More increases in health insurance rates out of Indiana and Iowa today‚Äîthose higher costs are thanks to the sabotage actions of the Trump administration &amp; Republicans in Congress, who are more concerned about scoring political points than lowering costs for American families.
Open borders, @realDonaldTrump? The bipartisan immigration bill I authored had $40 billion for border security and would have been far more effective than the wall.
While @realDonaldTrump signed an exec order on his policy of family separation, it does nothing for the &gt;2,300 children who have already been separated. Today @NancyPelosi &amp; I are writing him with one simple request: reunite these suffering children with their families. https://t.co/MQ3YcIXavw
.@realDonaldTrump hasn‚Äôt taken care of the problem, not by any stretch of the imagination. But now that he‚Äôs finally admitted that his administration does have the power to take action, I urge him to address these serious, unresolved issues.
What is the admin's plan to reunite the children already separated from their families? The EO is silent on that. How many facilities are these kids in now? What is their condition? Why hasn‚Äôt the media been allowed in to see and verify that the conditions are humane?
The way the executive order was drafted means that it will not go into effect until a court rules on its legality. What is @realDonaldTrump's policy on family separation in the meantime? Will he continue to insist that these heartbreaking separations continue?
I hope this means @realDonaldTrump will stop blaming others for problems he creates &amp; start fixing them himself. He may have signed his executive order, but we have even more questions:
For a little over a month, @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs family separation policy has resulted in &gt;2,300 children separated from their families. After wks of acting like his admin bore no responsibility for the policy, contravening all fact &amp; reality, I hope this represents a turning point.
Keeping these children separated from their families is unacceptable and must be rectified. This has to be our number one priority #KeepFamiliesTogether	https://t.co/H2bkvKtDpc
He can start with correcting the problems that this executive order will create, and should also undo his #DACA order, which has put so many young people in limbo.
I also hope this represents a turning point &amp; @POTUS will stop blaming others for problems he creates &amp; start fixing them himself.
It‚Äôs a relief that @realDonaldTrump has reversed himself &amp; recognized the cruelty of his policy of separating families. While the EO doesn‚Äôt reference the families already ripped apart, I hope &amp; expect that the admin will be able to quickly reunite these children w/their parents.
Protecting US jobs &amp; our nation‚Äôs security must remain paramount &amp; not something that we can compromise on. As my colleagues on both sides have already stated, it is vital that the House keep this bipartisan provision in the defense bill as it heads towards a conference.
My Republican colleagues must resist efforts by the Trump administration ‚Äì at the behest of the Government of China -  to get them to water down or back off of the Senate‚Äôs strong language on ZTE in the defense bill.

You - and not the law - are responsible for this family separation policy, @realDonaldTrump. GOP Senators and members of your own administration have confirmed this. You could reverse this terrible practice in a few minutes- but you refuse to lift a finger. https://t.co/goVSkJoGVk

If the House moderates really want to get something done on immigration, they should not be duped by their leadership for a bill that they know isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
House mods will lose all credibility if they accept this sham of a bill; it's extreme &amp; drastically cuts immigration in ways unacceptable to the Senate &amp; American ppl. It holds #Dreamers &amp;kids separated frm parents hostage to cut legal immigration &amp; enact the hard right‚Äôs agenda.
Instead of supporting this so-called ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù bill, @HouseGOP who want to get something done for Dreamers should stick to their original idea: Protect the Dreamers and work in a bipartisan way to secure the border.

In today‚Äôs decision, the #SCOTUS seemingly ignores the rights of the eligible voters who will be denied the right to vote in future elections simply because they chose not to vote in the past.
When Congress passed the NVRA, a balance between was struck between the desire to make it as easy as possible for eligible voters to cast ballots and the need for States to maintain accurate voter rolls.
Democracy suffers when laws make it harder for U.S. Citizens to vote. This decision is dangerous and damaging and is NOT why we passed the National Voter Registration Act in ‚Äò93. In fact, this goes completely against the spirit of the law.
The right to  vote is the most sacred right we have as citizens. Aggressive voter purge systems like Ohio‚Äôs essentially make voting a ‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù privilege.

Despite Oregon‚Äôs action to mitigate some of the damaging effects of this Trump-GOP sabotage, Republicans still won‚Äôt be able to skirt ownership of the skyrocketing health care costs in this country.
The fact of the matter is that, like other states, Oregon‚Äôs rates do not need to be this high, but Republicans chose to systemically dismantle the American health care system - instead of working with Democrats to improve it - and now middle-class families are feeling the pinch.

So I'm asking: Are you better off today than the day @realDonaldTrump became president? Most people aren't. Costs are going up and so many of his promises just aren't being fulfilled.
What else? There has been no ‚Äúbill of love‚Äù for the #Dreamers. The President never stood up to the NRA. There is no check from Mexico for a border wall.
Did he #DraintheSwamp? Nope. @realDonaldTrump filled the federal govt with industry lobbyists &amp; rich execs with sprawling conflicts of interest. His cabinet secretaries have enjoyed luxuries on the taxpayers‚Äô dime. And his Administration hardly even vets its candidates.
Even on trade, where @realDonaldTrump &amp; I mostly agree on policy, he hasn‚Äôt delivered. After talking a big game on China, promising to be very tough, this weekend the president completely backed off.
How about #infrastructure? @realDonaldTrump promised a $3 trillion infrastructure bill to build gleaming new roads, bridges &amp; tunnels. It took him over a year to propose a detailed infrastructure plan &amp; when he did, it wasn‚Äôt even close to a trillion. And it‚Äôs gone nowhere.
.@realDonaldTrump promised his tax bill would be a middle-class miracle ‚Äì instead, the #GOPTaxScam was mostly a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy. Already, we‚Äôre seeing higher premiums and rising gas prices eat away at any meager tax benefit middle-class families received.
.@realDonaldTrump promised to protect Medicaid and Medicare from cuts and then proposed cutting both of those programs. Just recently, the President backed off a commitment to let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescriptions drugs.
.@realDonaldTrump promised the American people a better health care system -- better quality at lower prices. As premiums jump double digits in state after state, it‚Äôs clear he hasn‚Äôt delivered on that promise.
THREAD: Millions of Americans voted for @realDonaldTrump because they expected him to deliver, and millions who didn‚Äôt vote for him need him to deliver ‚Äì when is he going to come through for them? Think about it:

Unfortunately, instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to improve our healthcare system, Republicans have chosen to take full ownership of rising healthcare costs by actively making the problem worse.

This leads to the greatest worry, which is that the president will back off on what China fears most ‚Äì a crackdown on intellectual property theft ‚Äì in exchange for buying some goods in the short run. That‚Äôs a bad deal if there ever was one.
The toughest thing we could do, the thing that will move China the most, is taking tough action against actors like ZTE. But before it‚Äôs even implemented, the president backs off.

All for the sake of a political vendetta, Republicans have sabotaged &amp; destabilized our healthcare system so severely that #Trumpcare is already heralding double-digit premium increases in states across the country.
And right now, the Trump Admin is finalizing a rule to expand the availability of #junkplans that would force higher premiums for ppl w/ pre-existing conditions, impose an ‚Äúage tax‚Äù on seniors &amp; once again could subject Americans to the devastating effects of medical bankruptcy.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress repealed the health care coverage requirement, which the @USCBO predicted would raise premiums by 10% more each year than they would otherwise be and result in millions of more people without insurance.
Don't forget: President Trump canceled payments for the cost-sharing program, which reduces premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for low-income Americans.
Remember when @realDonaldTrump said he was going to ‚Äútake care of everybody;‚Äù that he would deliver ‚Äúhealth care that is far less expensive and far better?" He didn't just drop the ball - he &amp; Congressional Republicans sabotaged the whole system.

Read more of my thinking on decriminalizing marijuana on @Medium: https://t.co/dGEV4hXQSF
Plain and simple: this is the right thing to do for America.
This will not course correct the damage that‚Äôs been done, but it is a first step that can help to enable those historically harmed to have an opportunity to better compete in the industry as we make this change on the federal level.
It's clear that African Americans and Latinos have been disproportionately impacted; approximately 80% of people in federal prison and 60% in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.
That‚Äôs why this bill will inject real dollars into minority and women-owned businesses to ensure those disproportionately affected by marijuana criminalization can benefit from this new economy.
Now, I recognize that time after time when these sweeping changes occur, the little guys lose while the big guys continue to profit. We saw this with big tobacco and we could see it with marijuana as well.
It will also maintain federal authority to regulate interstate trafficking to ensure that marijuana from states that have legalized doesn‚Äôt pour into those that have not.
In addition to decriminalization, my bill will invest critical resources into the THC research needed to prevent unintended effects on our youth and ensure highway safety.
And under existing law, the federal government considers marijuana as dangerous as heroin and treats it less favorably than cocaine. That has to change.
So why have I changed my stance? Looking at the numbers helped. 2/3 of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized, meanwhile more than half of all drug arrests in the United States are marijuana arrests. (https://t.co/MUOam2uIxz)
I have long believed that states should function as their own laboratories of democracy. My bill is a step in the right direction aimed at removing the barriers to state legalization efforts.
THREAD: It‚Äôs official. Today, I am formally announcing my plan to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. It‚Äôs time we allow states, once and for all, to have the power to decide what works best for them.
People can change. Sat down with @Shawna from @vicenews to talk about new marijuana policy. Tune in at 7:30pm: https://t.co/rVTnNeseTg

The landmark agreement held so much promise, but the facts show how much work remains to be done: from health to education to access to good jobs, the painful legacy of housing discrimination remains a wrong that America must right.
Before his death, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led the fight to end housing discrimination. Though he did not live to see the Fair Housing Act become law in 1968‚Äî50 years ago today‚Äîhe knew that the path to equality ran through desegregated and non-discriminatory housing policy.

The only thing standing in the way of achieving their goals is the president, whose White House today praised them as courageous. What they want is for the president to show courage, not in empty words, but in real action, by at minimum supporting universal background checks.
I marched for 2 hours with the students in NYC and came away inspired by their enthusiasm, steadfastness &amp; focus on electing those who support them.

Thanks to the work of Senator @klobucharoffice, ‚ÄúKevin and Avonte‚Äôs Law‚Äù will become a reality &amp; we‚Äôll take a vital first step to ensuring lifesaving technology is available all across New York and the country.
Just this month, we were again reminded of how critical Avonte's Law is after the heartbreaking disappearance of 14-year-old Trevyan Rowe in Rochester.
As a result, I learned that bolting, elopement, &amp; wandering are part of the everyday worries of caregivers &amp; parents, and got to work looking for a way to provide voluntary GPS tracking devices to children or adults w/ developmental disorders, like Autism Spectrum Disorder.
I first introduced the bill in 2014, to honor Avonte Oquendo, a non-verbal boy with #autism, who bolted from his school in Queens. It felt like our whole city was looking for him, and we all mourned with his family when his body was found.
A bittersweet moment for me, as I announce the inclusion of a bill that means so much to NYers ‚Äì Avonte‚Äôs Law‚Äî will finally receive a final passage vote by the House and Senate this week.

When Hurricane Sandy hit, Chairman Cochran was the ranking member on the Approps Cmte. He &amp; his staff were extraordinarily helpful throughout the process. Ultimately, @SenThadCochran voted for the #Sandy relief bill when many of our colleagues opposed it. I‚Äôll never forget that.
After Hurricane Katrina buffeted his state, @SenThadCochran convinced recalcitrant lawmakers to deliver aid to the gulf coast far exceeding the Admin‚Äôs request. And he did it by working members on both sides behind the scenes, earning the nickname the ‚Äúquiet persuader.‚Äù
But there are many things do  have in common, and there‚Äôs a particular part of his legacy that I want every New Yorker to remember today:
.@SenThadCochran and I certainly have our differences. He once said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt call lots of news conferences. I just don‚Äôt see that as a necessary part of my responsibilities.‚Äù 		Agree to disagree.

Today @SenateDems have #ABetterDeal to offer the American people, one that rolls back the #GOPTaxScam's giveaways to corporations and the wealthy and invests that money instead in job-creating infrastructure.
After a year of bold promises, the Trump infrastructure plan proposed just $200 billion in federal funds, financed through cuts to existing programs, demands on local govts, and the private sector would make up the rest. 	What will that lead to? #TrumpTolls across the US.
Then we waited. And waited. A full year after we made our proposal, the Trump Administration finally released one of its own. Frankly, it was underwhelming.
A year ago, last January, @SenateDems unveiled our trillion dollar #infrastructure plan &amp; sent it to @realDonaldTrump. We said it was one of the areas where we could work with the president to get something done.
.@SenateDems believe overwhelmingly the American people will prefer building #infrastructure and creating close to 15 million middle-class jobs than giving tax breaks to the wealthy. More on the plan we'll unveil today:  https://t.co/DB8Z0bdVXQ

Over $200 billion in corporate buybacks have been announced since January, putting corporations on pace to spend over a trillion dollars this year buying back their own stock.

"The tax bill was sold as a way to create jobs and boost stagnant wages. So far, at least, corporations have been showing more concern about shareholders than about employees or the economy as a whole."
Instead of giving workers major wage increases, hiring new workers or investing in new equipment and research, the most popular use of the savings from the #GOPTaxScam for corporations is corporate share buybacks. https://t.co/xP8BkPouOw
Over and over, we‚Äôve heard the GOP mantra that the #GOPTaxScam was aimed at giving working Americans a boost. And yet, when you look at the actual policy, the lion‚Äôs share of the tax cuts is going to corporations.

Rather than just draft memos, @realDonaldTrump should call on Congress to pass @SenFeinstein‚Äôs bill to ban bump stocks. On far too many issues, this administration has been all talk &amp; little action ‚Äì we can‚Äôt afford that approach when it comes to curbing #gunviolence. 3/
However, there are serious problems with @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs approach. 1st, his own @ATFHQ agency has warned that it does not have the authority to ban bump stocks. The only way to close this loophole permanently is through legislation. 2/
Republicans in Congress &amp; the White House, led by @realDonaldTrump, have held fast to the belief that better laws won‚Äôt curb the epidemic of gun violence in this country. That they‚Äôre now reversing that belief &amp; exploring policy changes to curb gun violence is a welcome shift. 1/

What are YOU hoping to hear about in @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU address tonight?
Any other President would have already made it their priority to take decisive action against Russia in their first year. But this President is paralyzed when it comes to Putin &amp; his cronies in Russia. @realDonaldTrump may not say ‚ÄúRussia sanctions‚Äù tonight, but he ought to.
Why is the President so afraid to sanction Putin, his associates, or other corrupt Russian actors and officials? Why is he giving Putin a free pass after he attacked our democracy? What is he so afraid of?
Why won‚Äôt @realDonaldTrump use the power given to him by a near unanimous vote in Congress to hold Russia accountable for its blatant transgressions against the American people?
There is no subject more worthy of a thorough &amp; unbiased investigation than Russia's attack on our elections. And yet, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his allies have waged a scorched-earth campaign to discredit the investigation in any way possible.
Here‚Äôs something the President should discuss tonight: Russia sanctions. #SOTU
They‚Äôre missing the step where they consult with the other side, work with the other side, earn their support. That‚Äôs the hard work of legislating in our democracy. But this Administration eschews hard work.
There has been hardly a shred of bipartisanship in the Trump era, despite many appeals for it. @POTUS &amp; the GOP seem to think that bipartisanship happens when one side puts together a bill and demands the support of the other side, with no negotiation or compromise.
There are two words we‚Äôd like President Trump to say tonight about the economy: #ThanksObama. We may never hear @realDonaldTrump say those words, but he ought to. #SOTU

The Republican attacks on the credibility of the FBI &amp; DOJ are playing right into Putin‚Äôs hands. They constitute an attack on democracy itself &amp; I urge the GOP &amp; the press to stop peddling delusions of secret societies and deep states and coup d‚Äô√©tats.
Can you imagine the outrage on the right if President Obama‚Äôs message was being spread by WikiLeaks or Julian Assange or Kremlin sources?
The Republican campaign to attack the FBI has been joined by the same forces that interfered in the 2016 election ‚Äì WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, and Russia. Just a few years ago those things were actually attacked by the GOP, particularly by the hard right. How things have changed.
The Republican Majority on the House Intelligence committee has manufactured a secret memo of partisan talking points, full of innuendo &amp; glaring omissions, intended to suggest widespread corruption at the Dept. of Justice &amp; the FBI.
The right has waged an aggressive &amp; coordinated attack on the integrity of the Special Counsel, and now that political smear campaign has bled into a spiraling &amp; delusional attack on the @FBI itself.
In 2016, @FBI was tasked with a mission of great importance to all Americans: investigating Russia‚Äôs interference in our elections. But ever since Special Counsel Mueller was appointed, the GOP &amp; right-wing media have been desperate to distract the nation from his investigation.
Important to remember, in the midst of a govt shutdown, the GOP - which used to be considered the "law &amp; order party"- continued their attack on our nation's top law enforcement agency, the @FBI.
He leaves a profound legacy and we are grateful beyond measure for his gifts to our city and our nation.
As a pastor and leader in Harlem he built affordable housing, challenged the pestilence of the drug culture, and never stopped his passionate pursuit for equality and racial justice -- even as he changed hearts and minds and inspired countless congregants to lead better lives.
As a civil rights leader at the very vanguard of the movement, at the most crucial time he pulled America away from hate and racism closer to its founding ideals.
My heart sinks to hear of Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker's passing. I was privileged to be welcomed many times to Canaan Baptist and to be inspired by his words, intellect and towering dignity.

To say allowing Dreamers to become Americans is "amnesty" is nasty; protecting Dreamers is our moral obligation. The eyes of America are on us to help them, and we must get the job done.
#Dreamers have been trying so hard to become Americans. They came across the border when they were little, now they're in our armed forces, our schools, our factories, our offices.
Every Democrat ‚Äì all forty nine of us @SenateDems ‚Äì supports DACA. Many of my Republican colleagues do as well. We certainly can find a bill that will get sixty votes here in the Senate.
The clock is ticking for #Dreamers. If we don‚Äôt solve this problem in 15 days, the Republicans are going to have to explain to dreamers what their plan is to prevent them from being deported.

What are Mr. Mueller‚Äôs discreditors so afraid of? It‚Äôs obvious, when you are afraid of the result, you attack the process.
Mr. Mueller is one of the most trusted &amp; respected public servants. He‚Äôs as straight a shooter as they come. Impugning his motives &amp; calling his investigation a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù or a ‚Äúcoup‚Äù is frankly hysterical.
Over the past several months, the investigation &amp; the FBI have been the target of a smear campaign by Republicans in the media &amp; by several Republicans in Congress to discredit the investigator &amp; the investigation itself, by falsely painting it as biased or partisan.

The GOP's tax bill is a cynical one-two gut punch to the middle class ‚Äì raise their taxes to pay for corporate tax cuts &amp; then decimate their earned benefits as a kicker.
Know this: the #GOPTaxScam will explode the deficit, starving our investments in ed, infrastructure &amp; research. After all that, it will endanger #SocialSecurity, Medicare &amp; Medicaid, when, a few yrs down the line, the GOP slashes those prgms to pay for the deficit they created.
At a time when our economy is stacked against the middle class &amp; in favor of the wealthy, #GOPTaxScam will skew the playing field even more &amp; will explode inequality in a country where the top 1% already capture &gt;20% of the national income, while the bottom 50% take in only 13%.

On the #DreamAct, as @SenatorDurbin said yday, we are making progress in talks with the GOP &amp; I hope we can reach an agreement soon. Democrats support real border security &amp; will happily join with Republicans to pass legislation to secure our border in exchange for the Dream Act.
Our veterans deserve better. People seeking recovery from opioid addiction deserve better. Hard-working pensioners deserve better. We must do both of these things - support the military and programs that create jobs and economic growth here at home - in equal measure.
Nobody wants to see a shutdown. But without an agreement that covers defense AND economic development, programs to combat the opioid crisis, shore up pension plans, support veteran's health care, relieve student loan debt, and build rural infrastructure could see a cut.
Update: Congressional negotiators are making good headway on a budget deal that would meet our commitments to our military &amp; urgent priorities here at home.  I hope this progress continues but it's in stark contrast to @POTUS who again said yesterday: "a shutdown could happen."

#GOPTaxBill raises premiums on average Americans healthcare by 10% so they can give the wealthy a tax cut.		Sound familiar? 		Remember #Trumpcare?
RT @SenateDems: .@SenBobCasey is FIRED UP ‚Äì ‚Äúwhen I say this bill is a thief in the night, I mean it.‚Äù WATCH: https://t.co/bP1TDyvEQj
The #GOPTaxBill kicks 13 million people off health care to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. 13 MILLION.
Cmon. The #GOPTaxPlan is the wrong kind of approach for our economy; it betrays the American workers &amp; the American families who deserve tax relief by helping those at the very top.
.@SenateGOP, there's way out of this mess ‚Äì work w/ @SenateDems on real, bipartisan reform. You won‚Äôt have to choose btwn blowing up the deficit &amp; hurting the middle class. Working together we could actually improve the condition of working Americans.
Last night, @SenateGOP decided to throw the mother-of-all monkey wrenches into their bill: repealing the individual mandate. Impt to remember @USCBO already said that would cause 13M fewer Americans to have health insurance &amp; would raise premiums by 10%.
Either tens of millions of taxpayers will pay significantly more in the long run, or a future Congress will extend the tax breaks, making the deficit hole they create massively deeper.	 	Our Republican colleagues, particularly the deficit hawks, can't have it both ways.
With the new Senate #GOPTaxBill, Republicans have put themselves between a rock &amp; a hard place: dramatic tax increases on the middle class or a huge hole in the deficit.
This has now happened 2x in one day. So much for the ‚Äúwhole trickle-down through the economy‚Äù idea. https://t.co/taoHSUoC4Z

Instead of learning from their failure to repeal health care, GOP is doubling down on the same partisan strategy that would throw our health care system into chaos. If the American ppl weren‚Äôt already outraged by #GOPTaxScam, injecting health care into it will do the trick.
The #GOPTaxScam is a backdoor attempt to get #Trumpcare passed. That‚Äôs not what the American people want.
GOP is tying themselves in a knot. They‚Äôre cutting taxes on the wealthy &amp; taking health care away from millions &amp; raising the premiums of millions others all to help reduce taxes on the rich. Does that sound familiar? https://t.co/q1JYTEm4GB

We shouldnt be rushing through such an ill-conceived, backwards bill. Remember it is being called the #GOPTaxScam and "HR1%" 		If the GOP turn their backs on this deeply flawed approach, we can work tghr on bipartisan tax reform that delivers real relief to middle-class families.
But why rush? @SenateDems, the American ppl &amp; even the rest of the GOP need to know what's actually in the #GOPTaxBill. Are they trying to hide that it helps the wealthy &amp; big corps while raising taxes on millions of middle-class families?
It's clear: the real #GOPTaxPlan isn't ready because every few days Pres Trump tweets asking the Republicans to change their bill, repeal the individual mandate and drop the top rate, as he did yesterday. And the GOP considers it to placate a restless &amp; uninformed President.
.@POTUS's absurd idea to repeal the individual mandate as a part of the #GOPTaxPlan would boot 13M ppl from the health insurance rolls and cause premiums to skyrocket - all to pay for an even bigger tax cut for the very rich, those who pay the top rate. What a toxic idea!
We are two days into a markup of the #GOPTaxPlan &amp; Democrats haven‚Äôt even seen the real bill yet. In their desperate rush to get this tax bill through Congress, the Republicans started by marking up a bill that‚Äôs not even the one they intend to pass.
Every American should wonder why President Trump goes to such great lengths to avoid criticizing President Putin.
