Those seeking asylum are doing so because they fear for their safety, and the federal government sending them back into harm‚Äôs way is unconscionable.	 	New York will continue to support those seeking refuge here &amp; will fight back against anyone who tries to thwart this process.
The Trump Admin‚Äôs Turnback Policy directs officials to deny some asylum-seekers the ability to present their claims for asylum.	 	Federal law requires officials to promptly give them a fair chance to present their claims, not force them to languish under inhumane conditions.

At a time when so many Americans are struggling to make ends meet, the CFPB should be focused on protecting consumers, not advancing policies that could potentially hurt them even more.
The proposal would expand the use of "no-action" letters, effectively making it easier for companies to test new products and services without the regulatory oversight necessary to protect consumers and ensure financial stability ‚Äì the core role of the CFPB.

Secretary DeVos &amp; the Trump Administration must understand the gravity of what's at stake.	 	It's the Education Department‚Äôs duty to protect students in every way they can, and help them feel safe while receiving their education.
The rollbacks discourage the reporting of sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence, and if enacted, would limit the school's responsibility to prevent &amp; investigate sexual assault and harassment.
I submitted a letter to Education Secretary DeVos and the Trump Administration to express my concern over the Department's efforts to roll back key protections for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses.

They passed:		‚úÖ The Comprehensive Contraception Care Act which protects New Yorkers' access to cost-free birth control.	 	‚úÖ The Boss Bill which allows New Yorkers to make their own reproductive health decisions without the fear of reprisal from their employers.
Today, New York signed the Reproductive Health Act into law, officially codifying this protection in our state.	 	But the Legislature didn't stop there.
46 years ago today, Roe v. Wade was decided and a woman's right to choose became the law of the land.	 	In the years since, too many have tried to reverse it and infringe on this most basic right.
We will continue to root out alleged illegal practices that increase costs of health care and medication for all New York Medicaid recipients, and will hold accountable any provider that may engage in these deceptive practices.
We‚Äôve also reached a $60M settlement in principle w/Walgreens for allegations of false claims made to NY's Medicaid program for prescription drugs.	 	Allegations include billing certain drugs at a higher cost while selling the drugs to consumers as part of a reduced rate program.
We‚Äôve reached a $209.2M settlement with Walgreens over Medicaid fraud allegations for over-dispensing insulin pens.	 	Walgreens didn‚Äôt always adhere to prescribed days of supply outlined by prescribing doctors, and allegedly billed Medicaid for the additional doses.
While we are disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision to allow the ban to proceed, we will continue to challenge the policy.
Alongside other states, we have fought in the Circuit Courts to stand up for the rights of transgender people to serve in the military.		Today‚Äôs decision doesn‚Äôt stop that fight.

Child labor laws exist for a reason.	 	My office will continue to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law employers who unlawfully put children in danger.
Today Luke Park, a dairy farm owner in Homer, NY, was sentenced for violating child labor laws which resulted in the death of a 14 year old boy.		Park allowed children to operate heavy machinery and made them work hours over the legal limit for minors.
Even though New York has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, lax gun laws in our neighboring states jeopardize our safety.		New York has zero tolerance for anyone who tries to illegally bring weapons into our state.
We took down gun traffickers who brought guns from Pennsylvania and illegally resold them in New York.	 	The individuals illegally trafficked firearms through the Iron Pipeline, including assault weapons, semiautomatic pistols, a ghost gun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. https://t.co/I18KiXJbF8

We reached an $11M settlement with Sterling Jewelers (Kay Jewelers &amp; Jared) for enrolling consumers in store credit cards without their knowledge, misrepresenting the terms of the cards consumers did enroll in &amp; enrolling them in card insurance without their consent.
It‚Äôs unacceptable that unlicensed individuals would ever perform medical work in New York, and cheating our state out of millions of dollars of Medicaid fraud is against the law.		We will never tolerate these dangerous and deceptive business practices.
Earlier today, we reached a $9M settlement with Diamond Braces, a chain of dental offices operating in twelve locations in New York State, for allowing uncertified employees to perform orthodontic procedures and then improperly billing Medicaid for payment for such procedures.

We will never stop fighting to ensure our processes are protected and that our federal government is fulfilling its responsibility to serve Americans.

My office will continue to fight for clean air for all New Yorkers.
This is particularly problematic in rural areas upstate.	 	NY is the nation‚Äôs second largest consumer of wood for heating, and residential wood heating contributes more soot to NY's air than the electricity generation and the transportation sectors combined.
I'm leading a coalition of 8 states in fighting against the EPA's proposal to give manufacturers an additional 2 years to sell wood heaters that produce soot, a major public health concern, and fail to meet tighter anti-pollution standards.		https://t.co/kUJsdLalxH

This precedent-setting settlement with Bosch marks the first time any auto supplier has entered into a settlement for violating environmental and consumer protection standards.	 	Bosch will pay $98.7M to states across the country, including millions to consumers in New York.
New York led a coalition of 9 states to reach a landmark multistate $171M settlement with auto industry giants Fiat Chrysler &amp; Bosch for violating environmental &amp; consumer protection standards across the United States.
