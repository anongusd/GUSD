State lawmaker proposes new way of distributing electoral votes https://t.co/l4VmV6iLw8
Closing arguments have been made. The jury is out for deliberation. #KellyTrial
The prosecution says in the State of Illinois the fact that Kelly fled the state is an admission of guilt, a reason for flight. #KellyTrial
The State acknowledges there are two contradictions in the testimony of Gregory Bridges. He was the only eyewitness that said there were 5-6 shots fired and that the shooter got back in the white van and drove away. #KellyTrial
In rebuttal, the state says there are way too many assumptions to be made for a ‘second shooter’ to make sense. They say Kelly is the only one anyone saw with a gun. #KellyTrial
Bianucci says the white van is a mystery. If Kelley drove it into the parking lot, got out and started shooting then ran off on foot, who drove the van away? He says “It doesn’t make sense.” #KellyTrial
Mike Bianucci now giving closing arguments in defense of Jonathan Kelly. He raises questions about a “second shooter” and the legitimacy of eyewitness testimony due to alcohol consumption. #KellyTrial
The prosecution is giving its closing argument. They say whether or not Jonathan Kelly intended to kill Jenni McGruder doesn’t matter. They say firing a gun into a crowd with intent to cause bodily harm is murder. #KellyTrial

@JBPritzker now bringing up HB 40 abortion bill, Quincy Vet's home as example of @BruceRauner lies
@GovRauner says @JBPritzker dodging question on rates. Taxes for mid-income people would go up, he says. @JBPritzker says Rauner lying, taxes for middle class would go down
@JBPritzker asked multiple times for specific rates on prog. income tax. Says it has to be negotiated with lawmakers &amp; go to people of IL. No specific #s
@JBPritzker asked what his progressive income tax would look like. No specifics on rates.
@JBPritzker - Unions endorsed me b/c I"ll stand up for worker rights. @GovRauner "abysmal" on workers
