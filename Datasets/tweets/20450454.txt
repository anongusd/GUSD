Despite bipartisan agreement on policy that would #ExtendCHIP, Congress has failed to step up for kids. #SaveCHIP #KeepKidsCovered
We respectfully ask our representatives to #SaveCHIP now. Without immediate action, our kids could lose coverage in the coming months.  You can help us advocate for kids here: https://t.co/MmxEUWRTBU #ExtendCHIP #KeepKidsCovered
While lawmakers in the U.S. House and Senate support extending CHIP, Congress has not acted to pass long-term funding. Soon, children will be left without the coverage they need. #SaveCHIP
We're joining children's hospitals across the country in a day of action to #SaveCHIP. More than 6 million American children, and many of our patients, depend on Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for health care coverage.

"If you succeed in every disaster drill, you've failed." Better to face unexpected in drill instead of reality #lbgrandrounds #emergencyprep
In Tuscaloosa, hospital parking deck became impromptu shelter after tornado. Everyone charging devices, fuses kept blowing #lbgrandrounds
Hospitals must devise system for identifying/logging patients after disaster unidentified and unable to speak #lbgrandrounds #emergencyprep
On other hand, false info circulates on social media after disaster; can create more confusion than clarity #lbgrandrounds #emergencyprep
Phones were down after tornado- hospitals use Twitter and Facebook for updates after disaster #lbgrandrounds #emergencyprep
Better to send physicians to "response room" to divide areas of responsibility rather than gather in ER. #lbgrandrounds #emergencyprep
"Disaster plan should be second nature to you." Hospital set up 6 alternate care sites, plus treating patients in cafeteria  #lbgrandrounds

Children covered by Medicaid (compared to uninsured) enjoy better health, lower rates of mortality, higher educational &amp; economic outcomes
Children's health is a smart investment. Kids rep a large proportion of the Medicaid pop. but r responsible 4 only a fraction of spending.
It's critical we all tell our representatives that children need their help. #keepmedicaidstrong
The proposed Medicaid changes will have far-reaching, long lasting, negative impacts on kids and families in our own backyard.
The proposed American Health Care Act stipulates a cap on federal Medicaid dollars and a reduction of coverage and benefits.
In the Mid-South, kids make up nearly 60% of the Medicaid population -- but account for only a fraction of total spending. #kidsfirst
Le Bonheur is TN's largest provider for children on Medicaid. We provide about $100 million every year in uncompensated Medicaid care.
Take action to keep Medicaid strong for children. Why? Medicaid is the single largest insurer of children. https://t.co/cNvq3EO4zO

(cont)w/ each other &amp; our children. That's why we must always balance benefits against harms &amp; not use antibiotics unless really needed.
Lastly, overusing antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance in community bc we end up sharing antibiotic-resistant bacteria (cont)
5. Antibiotics can cause unpleasant and sometimes harmful side effects. There is no benefit to taking them when you don't really need them.
4. If you have a cold or other viral infection, taking antibiotics will not keep your friends and family from getting sick.
3. It is normal for mucous from your nose to turn green during a cold. Doesn't always mean you have a bacterial infection/need antibiotics.
2. Remember, it can sometimes take 10 + days for cold symptoms to go away. Antibiotics will not make a virus go away faster.
1. Many infections, especially ones seen this time of year, are viral. Antibiotics do NOT cure viral infections. #getsmartaboutantibiotics

@CardinalBiggles Love this!
To us, @clairerobinson5 is the winner. Her contributions will make a huge difference in the lives of children in Memphis and beyond!
The verdict wasn't what we hoped but $2,500 for the children of Le Bonheur! Thank you @clairerobinson5 for thinking of us!
From ordinary bumps &amp; sniffles to the most life-altering extremes, Le Bonheur is prepared for whatever life throws to the children we serve.
They left us on a cliffhanger, but all we can say is how much fun it is to watch @clairerobinson5 #cooking4MEMkids! Makes us so proud!
Here it comes! What's the verdict on the Southern Fried PuPu Platter? eek! "Good Flavors." #CutthroatKitchen #cooking4MEMkids
