@NorahODonnell @MichaelDadiego @ScottPelley @60Minutes Tyranny. Russian style. We have a Constitutional Right to end this tyranny.
@JackPosobiec @WebbDorsey2 Fascism? More like tyranny. Remember, Congress supported this and worked right along side of them every step of the way. We The People have no one to blame but ourselves for not fighting this tyranny 13 years ago. Yes, 13 years, 25 years if you go back to the Bill Clinton days.
@HeyTammyBruce We The People allowed this, we no longer have the will to fight tyranny, we have the Constitutional Right but not the will. Sad, sad time for America.

@justinamash Speaking of our Constitution and following it as the oath you all took to uphold and defend. Time for Congress to honor that oath. @POTUS is! The last thing you want is for We The People personally and physically defending our borders by any means necessary. We also have a duty. https://t.co/1hjGFVtY7c
@justinamash I sure hope conservatives can find some good Patriotic Americans to primary all our anti American members of Congress.
@justinamash @POTUS Well, no more emergency declarations for floods, wild fires, hurricanes, tornados, blizzards, illnesses, famine etc. Not here or abroad. This is indeed what you are saying @justinamash  Who in Congress is benefitting personally and or financially from our open borders?

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Really? DACA would not have expired if Obama would have not put an expiration date on it. You know he was advised to do this so Democrats could use them once again for campaign donations under the guise of "fighting for them".
@SenSchumer You want financial protections for these employees but not physical protections that save their lives? That's special. Your job carries dangers, are you willing to give up your personal physical protections while doing your job? If not stop denying others of the same security.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump All our BP employees want is the same safety and security Congress receives. A wall is a source of protection for them while doing their job protecting all of us, you, me and every American citizen. Why are you refusing to grant them safety and security while doing their job?

@LeaderHoyer @senatemajldr @POTUS Harry Reid did this for Obama and against Bush, it is where Mitch learned it from. Part of making gov. work is filling the vacancies in vital agencies. Schumer has blocked 350 nominees for 2 years now. Illegal immigration cost taxpayers 25 trillion with a T the last 5 years. Next
@RepSusieLee @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr McConnell learned this by watching Reid &amp; Schumer do the same thing. 350 nominees have been waiting 2 years [not 27 days] to be voted in the positions they were nominated for. These procedures work both ways. #FUNDTHEWALL #SECUREOURBORDERS

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Really? You refused to look at the faces of over 1 million of your own constituents when they lost their jobs due to NAFTA, ACA, regulations, legislations. How is it you give yourself a pass? These over 1 mil. did not get back pay for not working nor did they their job waiting.
@SenSchumer Wages go up the cost of the product and service also goes along with the taxes for each product and service along with individual SS tax goes up right off the top. Only one winning here is the tax man. Employees are the consumer of these products and services.

@griffbos @SenatorShaheen @POTUS @senatemajldr This is where @senatemajldr has the experience with Democrats promising something if they get their goods first and then Democrats not honoring their end of the deal.

@RealBasedMAGA @jstines3 @realDonaldTrump will not fall for the trap of declaring a national emergency. He knows it is the Democrats trap to cry impeachment for abuse of power even though he has the power to do so. He should wait this out until SCOTUS rules on DACA. He will have more leverage.

Congress has been running the same thing labelling it human trafficking for decades now and they are not facing jail time.
@dcexaminer @TianaTheFirst But it is winning. Congress and the President all took the same oath to protect and defend the United States of America and her citizens. President has shown he takes his oath seriously, Congress has never taken that oath seriously. Congress cares about Congress, power. Not us!

@txtechsean @RepKevinBrady @HouseGOP Not true. Everyone in this country has the same opportunity for fortune. Those that work and risk their hard earned money in investing should not have to support those that don't/won't.
@DiamondandSilk Would love to see ya's do a bit on this nugget. In Pelosi's own words on how the media does her dirty work. Listen here and you will see why everuone uses the exact same words. https://t.co/9Mm9e4BoiQ
@DiamondandSilk @POTUS needs to challenge them to give up their pay and perks along with their staffers until they agree to fund the wall. Yes staffers as they are the ones that actually do the negotiating the politicians just approve or disapprove of what they decide on. Pretty sad isn't it?
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump We have quite a large group of DACA recipients and legal immigrants that support the wall forming a march on Congress as we speak. Dates to be announced Sunday. House offices and local offices will also be visited. Stay tuned as the group is growing daily.

@realDonaldTrump Millions of Americans have lost their paychecks due to legislation and regulations passed by congress over the last 30 years. Our little community lost over 3,000 jobs the last 5 years. No one from congress cared, called, held press briefings. All in @SenSchumer district.
@realDonaldTrump How many members of congress are financially benefitting from drug and human trafficking? If they were not benefitting they would not be fighting to stop these abuses.
@realDonaldTrump Do you know how many American citizens can do the jobs of these H1-B holders are now doing? This is so wrong as is a path to citizenship ahead of those waiting in line to come here legally.

@WilDonnelly @K9Flex_JPD @realDonaldTrump Looks like a steel wall to me. Did you truly believe Mexico would cut a check? We didn't. We know stopping the flow of illegals and not paying their housing, food, education, medical would pay for the wall in 6 months. Wasted millions? You need to go read what Cong. spends daily.
@maggieNYT President @realDonaldTrump has no dealings with his businesses since he was sworn into office. Another fishing expedition.
@barkingspaniel @K9Flex_JPD @AlphaRebel5 @realDonaldTrump Best walnut America has ever had the pleasure of representing us.
@CGasparino Only morons believed Mexico would cut a check. Same morons that believed Obamacare would save those that work and pay for health insurance would all save $2,500.00 each every year, we could keep our plans, keep our Dr. and our hospitals.

@JacobAWohl @Mjhall412 Pelosi will not survive this. I see another major stroke coming for her... wall funding and shutdowns will be the least of her concerns if Trump gets to appoint another now and possibly 2 more within the next 6 years. Good thing I stocked up on popcorn!
