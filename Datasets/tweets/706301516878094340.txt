@Tommymac18 @CNBC The Homestead Act in Florida prohibits the seizure of your home for legal judgments or any other reasons except mortgage default. Once you pay for it, it’s yours. Some provinces in Canada have no property tax. The land belongs to you and your children.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC I’ve also done legal work for 25 years.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC Just think about it my friend. I’m a lot older than you and have seen a lot more than you have happen to good people.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC And be falsely accused and found guilty. You’re family is in the street then.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC And the accuser is an old neighbors’ daughter, who is now on drugs, has nothing and wants your Lobster Boat and your home so she can sell them...
@Tommymac18 @CNBC But that’s how people lose their homes. They don’t plan to not pay their property taxes. It’s forced upon them by circumstances like those I just discussed.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC You discount losing your home over unexpected medical bills or undeserved attorney fees. Supposed under new Statute of Limitations going back 20 years, you were falsely accused of rape 10 years ago? Forced to a $100,000 trial? You could lose your home.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC Not the point. The point is that as long as there are property taxes, “ownership” of real estate is a legal fiction.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC I know that. But they can’t seize my real property if it is protected similar to the Homestead Act Florida has. I can’t be made homeless and my heirs would always have a place to lay their head. Property taxes should be replaced.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC You’re splitting red cunt hairs. You or your heirs can lose everything you worked for your entire life over $1,000 in unpaid property taxes. Your home is the major source of equity in your life. Property taxes need replaced with sales and income taxes to protect your estate.
@JustaFan18 @LinSooMoon @lilly20122 Picture a soul that spent 25 years in prison for something they didn’t do and was forced to take a plea to get out because after spending $505,000 on attorneys they had run out of money. Picture a soul refused entry into a nursing home or shelter, and denied protection of law.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC I “own” my refrigerator. I “own” my car. I do not “own” my home as long as it is subject to be taken from me for not paying property taxes (rent), to a local government. Replace property taxes with income or sales taxes. That would be real tax reform.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC No. I don’t own my house. I have a Deed that allows me to live in it and sell it. But if I do not pay rent in the form of property taxes to the local government, they kick me out of “my” home and they sell it. Wake up. You “own” nothing as long as you don’t control it totally.
@jilevin MAGA hats are gang member insignia. Nothing more, nothing less.
@Tommymac18 @CNBC You are in error. You are equating tax reform with tax elimination. I would have no problem with replacing property taxes with an income tax. I would just like to actually OWN my house, instead of renting it from any government.

@Tommymac18 @CNBC I understand your point. But the concept of tax reform is not necessarily limited to federal taxes. Nor is it limited to visible taxes. To use your approach would eliminate the majority of taxes from consideration for reform.

Trump’s “Iron Curtain” will be no more effective than the Soviet “Iron Curtain.”		   But the philosophical and image implications are disheartening
@barbiejo16 @CalVic932 @RepMarkMeadows In 2013 no one was proposing building a 1200 mile 30’ useless wall. I spent 25 years in prison. I know about walls. Walls are there to slow you down. They don’t stop anything. But an electronic barrier with sufficient manpower and deployment resources is workable. Be practical.

@CalVic932 @RepMarkMeadows The government isn’t run by extortion. “You build my wall or I shut down the entire country,” isn’t subject to compromise. It’s like sitting down with a Islamic terrorist to negotiate, whose starting position is that you should be dead. You simply shoot him and get it over with.
@RepMarkMeadows The Republican’s answer to every single offer from the Democrats to reopen the government continues to be “no,” without any effort to compromise or meet in the middle. They are not negotiating. They’ve become the party of “resistance” and not “reason.”
@CheriJacobus @RightHookUSA @JadeRhinos @RichardEricSha1 @FBI The answer to that is obvious.

@G_Padraic @MaryDofVA I haven’t taken the time to actually read Chapter 47 of the CFR, but I may. I’m actually a student of Frankfurters Second Restatement.
@G_Padraic @MaryDofVA Good conversation. Nice to know others are at least think along the same lines.
@MaryDofVA @G_Padraic It’s well worth researching.
@G_Padraic @MaryDofVA “Chilling and hindering” a right has always been a cognizable claim.
@G_Padraic @MaryDofVA An attorney friend of mine and I discussed this and he believes Administrative Regulations and the CFR governing the FCC is a solution for Facebook, Instagram and any company that uses the Internet after Packingham.
@MaryDofVA Water companies? Kroger’s? Rite Aid refusing to fill prescriptions? All these things would be legal also?
@MaryDofVA @G_Padraic I believe you’re wrong. Once the Internet was declared a Public Utility, Facebook denying service to an SO is the same as the Water Company refusing to sell a SO water, when they pay their bill, or the electric company refusing service solely because they are an SO.

@cjcalgirl @Dax_x98 That’s not legalese DAX. Religion attempts to control sexual relations in general. Religion exploits those who need a crutch to survive day to day. But ALL of religious teachings must contain some degree of logic to be appealing enough to result in loyal followers. Or it dies.

@BostonUnite @Chaplain_Billx @KwikWarren That argument would be valid if contraceptives were not related to health care. It would be valid if it was not the case that the US has one of the highest rates of mortality during childbirth, and for some women pregnancy is life threatening. Religious beliefs cannot prevail.
@BostonUnite @KwikWarren And if the government has to pay for contraceptives for the disabled,  with medical problems requiring them, can they then discriminate against other women by making laws prohibiting insurance companies and corporations from paying for contraceptives?
@BostonUnite @KwikWarren And what about disabled women, living on $750 a month and Medicaid, who have severe menstrual health issues but cannot afford to buy contraceptives needed to treat that medical condition? As a Christian, do you object to your taxes paying for their, essentially, medication?
@Chaplain_Billx @BostonUnite @KwikWarren Taxes are part of the “Social Contract” each citizen enters into with their government by choosing to remain in that country. The manner in which taxes are spent is determined by their government. If you don’t want to pay for contraceptives, change your government, if you can.
@d2creative @BostonUnite @KwikWarren Good question. When churches become political entities by publicly advocating, on TV or otherwise, specific political platforms adopted by a particular political party, should they lose their tax exempt status? I believe Pat Robertson should not be tax exempt, for one.
@BostonUnite @KwikWarren Contraception drugs are not only used for birth control. Many women have medical issues like pain, heavy bleeding, cramping and vomiting during their menstrual cyclical that contraceptives cure. How do you separate your religious objections from their health issues?
@KwikWarren There is a subculture in the United States that is convinced their moral values and religious beliefs are “right.” They believe this to the point of actively working to make those values and beliefs the law, and place judges on the courts to impose those beliefs on everyone.

@McAllisterDen You’re wrong. There is systemic racial prejudice in America. African Americans make up 12.4% of the population. Yet 45% of prisoners are African American. The felon disenfranchisement laws were nothing more than Jim Crow laws. So were the mandatory minimum crack sentencing laws.
@LadyOnTheRight1 @donnabrazile @JackKingston @BrianKempGA @staceyabrams Yes, Becca. It’s prejudice. And you know it as well as I do. That’s what disheartens me. It’s source is usually familial. My father was like that. Do you realize Harvard said an alien probe passed through the solar system last year? We all breathe Oxygen and bleed red. Do they?
@LadyOnTheRight1 @donnabrazile @JackKingston @BrianKempGA @staceyabrams Here are people who do understand Georgia’s voting system.

@ShierBill Americans are regularly punished for exercising their right under the 6th Amendment to a jury trial, by being sentenced to the maximum the charges carry instead of the few years offered before trial if they would have entered a plea of guilty.
@ShierBill It’s more perfidious than that. In UNITED STATES V. RUIZ 536 U.S. 622 (2002), the Court stated that if 93% of criminal defendants did not plead guilty, the system would collapse. So prosecutors overcharge, then offer plea deals carrying 1/10 the sentence a trial could result in.

your fat ass. What you did was unnecessary and harmed both these men and their families. They weren’t bothering anyone. 96% of all sex crimes are committed by First Time Offenders. Brothers, Uncles, Stepfathers, Teachers. Why didn’t you report that?
You have engaged in sensationalized journalism perhaps to keep your job from being taken by someone younger and more willing to do real journalism. This entire story you sat at your desk, started with the RSO website, and then researched the people online. Never got off 4/5
predatory homosexuals attempting to force prisoners with sex cases into having sex with them, or second, they have committed sex crimes for which they either had not been reported or which were so far in the past their records had not been digitalized. 3/5
who are minding their business you have interfered with their right to support their families and their right to worship. In my considerable experience with people like you, I’ve found they generally fall into two broad categories in prison. First, they are 2/5

@lsolum Just looked at your profile. Didn’t know you were a Law Professor. I was just a lowly jailhouse lawyer for 25 years in the Ohio prison system. I have 7 reported decisions from the 6th Circuit and was Class Rep. in Fussell v. Wilkinson.
@lsolum I enjoyed.
@lsolum Yet is was done under the guise of originalism. Perhaps the real danger of originalism is its obtuse nature inviting abuse and misuse by the sophisticated on the unsophisticated???
@lsolum I don’t know if there is a difference. The concept of originalism seems to me, with 25 years experience in litigation, as mostly sophistry designed to support a reactionary view of Civil Rights.
@lsolum The Statutes were the product of Senators Orrin Hatch and Trent Lott. They are both originalists and have strongly advocated the appointment of originalist Judges and Justices.
@lsolum That I agree with. But some who purport to be originalists use it to advance nationalistic or fascist agendas. Furthermore originalists judges I’ve faced, like Magistrate Merz in Dayton, use originalistic interpretations of the Constitution to suppress Civil Rights.
@jaketapper @The_UnSilent_ So it’s okay to destroy the coastline and planet, but not the economy...just stop and think about that for a minute. Marco Rubio, in essence, just said Florida’s coastline doesn’t contribute to its economy. Is he on drugs?
@lsolum Originally the AEDPA contained a Clause suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus, but Democrats objected so strongly it was removed. Hundreds of pages of regressive laws enacted a week after the Oklahoma bombing. You’d think they were simply waiting on such an occurrence...
@lsolum It’s the philosophy of originalism in action. The rights given prisoners in the 1800’s were almost non-existent. Originalism embraces a non-evolving perception of our laws. Thus, these laws, enacted by conservative originalists, epitomize the philosophy.
@lsolum I’ve seen it’s damage to our laws through opinions issued by Justice Thomas, Scalia, Roberts, etc. I know what it is. It’s laws like the Prison Reform Litigation Act the stops prisoners from obtaining lawyers by capping their Fees at $75 an hour and the AEDPA.
@lsolum Originalism is simply a misleading label for a reactionary view of society’s duties to minorities and criminals, i.e., people that don’t look or act “like they are supposed to.” (in the originalist’s opinion). You can only suppress society’s evolving values with sophist Judges.
@lisastark351 MAGA’s have found something that will accept their real values. Most MAGAT’s come from racist families that taught them to hate anyone not like them. But Politically Correct/Hate Crime laws have kept them in the closet. Trump opened the closet and invited the idiots to join him.

@SaysHummingbird @ShierBill It’s not shame that Mitch McConnell lacks, so much as a sense of right and wrong. He’s lost his moral compass in his quest for power.
