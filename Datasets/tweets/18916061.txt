I was all set to criticize Ben’s use of Yiddish, but reading the piece, I see he used the word “mishegas” perfectly appropriately. I suppose that makes him a “meshugenah,” and Laurel must be “meshuga” for even catching the use of the word “mishegas!” https://t.co/sZtIF5to72

Super Bowl Sunday is a fun day for me- I participate in the Worldwide Tefillin Wrap where we teach pre-B’nai Mitzvah Jewish kids about Tefillin and how to put them on; then we join with friends to enjoy the Super Bowl itself, with all its excitement, great ads and half-time show. https://t.co/nZOI2E34Kz
Turns out @realDonaldTrump saw how dismal his situation was and agreed to re-open our government for 3 weeks with NO funds for his #WallOfHate - He realized his #Shamocracy is crumbling around him and @SpeakerPelosi and the #Dems have beaten him at every play as his numbers tank.
Could it be that @realDonaldTrump sees how dismal his situation situation is &amp; will let Democrats re-open our government temporarily without funds for his #HatefulWall? His #Shamocracy is crumbling around him. @SpeakerPelosi has beaten him at every play &amp; his numbers are tanking.

Breaking: CNN reports GOP Senators Lisa Murkowski &amp; Susan Collins, along with the retiring Jeff Flake and Democrat Joe Manchin are meeting privately right now - this could be the determinative discussion for the success or failure of the #KavanaughConfirmation vote.
I’m willing to bet this Tweet was written days ago. #Kavanaugh was downright disrespectful &amp; disdainful to the #SenateDemocrats - he ducked, dodged and weaved, and kept repeating himself, failing to ever answer the questions he was asked and acting totally entitled. #KavaNOPE https://t.co/pax9uZmGXF
Now this is a mouthful: Former GOP Senator (and presidential candidate) Rick Santorum discussing the #KavanaghHearing on @CNN said, “She (Blasey Ford) seems totally authentic and that’s a big problem for Kavanaugh.” Word is the GOP Senate lunch is “raucous.”
Any person listening to #ChristinaBlaseyFord testify who does not hear &amp; feel her pain &amp; see her deep emotion as she relives this trauma, is heartless &amp; utterly inhuman. The contrast between the sensitivity of the Democratic Senators &amp; the GOP prosecutor is stark. #KavaNOPE https://t.co/fSqo4qpa4J

As a kid my grandparents assured me the last bastion of freedom and fairness was #SCOTUS - that was not true then and today proves it is certainly not true now. By 5-4 those partisan enablers have allowed our hateful, vindictive #POTUS to discriminate based on religion. #SHAME

After 2 days of meetings in Sacramento, I ended by speaking to Generation Change, who are working hard to turn out young voters. Now we are heading to San Francisco for a day full of meetings tomorrow, then home for Shabbat. I’ll announce my GOTV weekend plans shortly.
Send your friends who are helping lead the Big Blue Wave across the USA to join me @EricBauman - we have much work ahead and I need all of your support! Visit @CA_Dem on the web at https://t.co/dgBCnBDRmQ for more info.

It’s not quite official but @NBCNews has declared #ConorLamb the #ApparentWinner in #PA18 - an embarrassing repudiation of @realDonaldTrump &amp; his cronies. The GOP spent $10 million in a failed attempt to save a seat #Trump won by 20% - be scared, very scared, #BigBlueWave coming. https://t.co/7KXg0J6pUu
It looks like tonight @realDonaldTrump (and his cronies) suffered the biggest slap in the face since he lost the popular vote, barely winning the electoral college. It seems #ConorLamb will pull it out &amp; narrowly win #PA18 which Trump won by 20% - The #BigBlueWave is on the way!
So with all but 3,206 outstanding absentee ballots in two GOP-leaning counties, giving Republican Saccone 60% and Democrat #ConorLamb 40%m Lamb should win #PA18 by about 200 or so votes... please keep holding your breath! Remember, #Trump won this by a 20% margin.
With 98% of the vote in, #ConorLamb remains ahead by 585 votes. There are several thousand absentee ballots, more than half come from Allegheny County, the #Democrats stronghold. Holding my breath. Regardless, this is a humiliation for the GOP. #Trump won this by 20 points.
At 87% of the vote in #ConnorLamb remains 1.4% ahead in #PA18 - those the rural and red parts of the districts are coming in, this is definitely still in play.
At 71% of the vote in, Lamb is still 3.6% ahead #pa18 - we can do this, please keep your fingers crossed!
I am amazed and delighted to see #Democrat #ConnorLamb more than 9 points ahead with 40% of the vote in - this a district #Trump won by 20 points - and in spite of Trump’s #ClownCar road trip to #PA18 last weekend. We may not win in the end, but #BlueWave2018 is coming.

And let’s not forget, the celebration of Trump’s one year anniversary is being celebrated with the #TrumpShutdown - what a fitting tribute to the #Failure of   of our #FakeNews racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic so-called president.
Once again the Trump #FakeNews machine tries to spin it’s way out of the mess they’ve caused, but Trump owns the #TrumpShutdown - anyone who suffers from this must remember the GOP holds the White House and both houses of Congress. We say DACA &amp; CHIP now!
Looking forward to going toe to toe with former @CAGOP chair @shawnsteel1 over #Trump and his debacle of a first year on  @KNX1070 at 	1 PM today. America is more divided and angrier than ever as the government is about to shutter under his #Failed leadership.

LA Democratic Party's statement on Jerry Brown's knock out of Neel Kashkari in tonight's gubernatorial debate: http://t.co/SkkJsy7LSU
The verdict: @JerryBrownGov scored a decisive knock out. Kashkari's still going down in double digits! #CADebate
With all his blather, I'm shocked  Kashkari doesn't offer a PARP plan - TARP for pensions. Clearly he has no clue how Gov't works. #CADebate
