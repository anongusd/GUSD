What is H.R.1? It’s our anti-corruption bill that will:	✅ Get dark money out of politics	✅ End partisan gerrymandering	✅ Protect our elections from foreign influence		https://t.co/BAcoQmNG9h
For far too long the Central Valley has been left out of the appropriations process &amp; that’s why I’m opening it up to YOU. Submit a request at the link below to get federal funding for your organization!	https://t.co/5Ykot4wh63 https://t.co/VAzMJQ4Nhw
Thanks, Amy – I made a promise on day one to be accessible and transparent because that’s what the Central Valley deserves.		https://t.co/xax38WE0G2 https://t.co/DwfUVCV7z1
Water isn’t a Democratic or Republican issue – it turns out we all need access to reliable and high quality water. I recently sat down with some folks from the Modesto Irrigation District to discuss ways to maintain a steady water supply in the Central Valley. https://t.co/YLJYHaWflO
Thanks to the California Alliance for Retired Americans for visiting our Modesto Office and sharing your priorities for senior citizens in the Valley! https://t.co/9Wr0gMepGe
I have to admit something to you all… I’m no photographer. That’s why I’m launching a contest – do you have a beautiful photo of the Central Valley? Submit it to this link and we’ll chose a winning photograph to become our new official cover photo!	https://t.co/XNFspZbZrN https://t.co/Drd4MuScqG
This week, on a national stage, I made sure the Central Valley’s voice was heard – we need better health care and we need Medicare for All. https://t.co/r9f8ahi8fw
Thanks, Christy. https://t.co/niEGXsLv68
WATCH: Here's what I had to say to Sec. Perdue at this week's hearing. https://t.co/2pfrL0huYL

Blue and I had a great conversation today about how to promote bi-paw-tisanship in Congress! https://t.co/w0wlXk2iwN

Today I’m keeping a promise to address our healthcare crisis. We need to move to a system where every single family has healthcare coverage and can actually afford it. https://t.co/ed03t5u4T7
I’m proud to announce today we officially introduced #MedicareforAll, I’ve heard throughout our community that the Central Valley needs affordable and universal healthcare. This bill is a big step towards fulfilling that promise. https://t.co/GNSSceh7jb
Win of the day: Last week I visited the VOLT Institute to see how they use technical education to prepare folks for good paying jobs. Today we worked on (and passed out of committee!) a bill that brings more dollars to programs just like this in the Central Valley. https://t.co/rSmdVJs3nA
Tomorrow we have a big opportunity – what should I ask US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at our hearing? https://t.co/9Vehwpx5Dp
Drug prices are out of control and devastating our families. Glad to see both parties working together today to hold drug companies accountable. https://t.co/EwWOWlp0Es https://t.co/GHqTvfD0Hx

Our office is open for business! Please reach out, our staff is ready to help get you the services you need and the funding the Central Valley deserves. https://t.co/hR36XeZOdZ
But when it comes to our Central Valley water, I believe even one tunnel is one tunnel too many. We can't afford a plan that exports Central Valley water down south at the expense of our economy.
In today’s State of the State address, @GavinNewsom set the stage for a new chapter in California, &amp; the Valley must play a key part of that story. I look forward to working with the Gov to ensure every Central Valley family gets the overdue attention they deserves in Sacramento.
Met with these wonderful Central Valley families today to discuss how we are fighting to keep families together. https://t.co/QEID52m6D7
I’m proud my staff reflects the values of the Central Valley. We are your neighbors, and we’re here to serve you. https://t.co/Ls6n490yQk

In my town halls and meetings across the Central Valley I hear time after time that drug prices are too high. Today, I co-sponsored an important bill to keep money in your pocket and end price gouging from pharmaceutical companies. https://t.co/FFwmkDFnT9

I hope the President backs up tonight’s bipartisan appeals in his #SOTU with bipartisan action. If we want progress on the issues that matter to the hardworking families of the Central Valley, we can't let gridlock, lies, and fear-mongering rule as they so often do nowadays.
Tonight is my first State of the Union Address - I hope to hear the President discuss the issues that unite us. #SOTU https://t.co/4gPsJR5wBk
Just landed in DC with John, our State of the Union guest! Looking forward to John teaching Congress a thing or two about how we get things done in the Valley! https://t.co/TjlIyi9eXJ

This shutdown should have never happened, but glad that the Pres. &amp; leaders in both Houses have agreed to compromise. Let’s put this sad episode behind us so both sides can work on a permanent solution to fund our government, secure our border, &amp; fight for Central Valley families
It's about showing up, listening, and getting to work. Read my latest Op-Ed here---&gt;	https://t.co/57fHPE0Tft

The CA wildfires were devastating. Today we worked across the aisle and won an additional $1.9 billion to help farmers rebuild. We have lots more to do, but this is a start.		If you were effected by the wildfires call my office at (209) 579 5458 and we can help. https://t.co/u8SLnrTXld
Thrilled to be on the House Ed &amp; Labor Committee (and still TBD others). I ran to make a difference on issues that matter to  #CA10— good jobs, worker's healthcare and setting up the next generation for success. This gives us the voice to do just that.		https://t.co/Wgv8BpSs4B
Our communities need this disaster recovery funding. I refuse to let it be taken from us. We have to put politics aside and have a real debate about how we properly secure the border.		https://t.co/p0w7MxyPZb
Yesterday for the first time I addressed Congress. I rose to speak because this government shutdown is directly hurting the Central Valley and it needs to stop. You can watch my first speech below. https://t.co/fuTmXAO4LC
This is what is wrong with partisan politics. 		Immigration reform is needed, border security is needed. 		But we absolutely shouldn’t shut down the government because we can’t work together. Open the government and stop hurting families who need our government’s help.
Congrats to all our @SJGov and @StanCounty representatives who took the oath of office yesterday! Excited to work with you to make life better in the Central Valley!		https://t.co/CcvYrUcp3n
