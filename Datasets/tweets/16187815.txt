@nixonron @nytimes @AP Well done! Looking forward to welcoming you to the @AP family 🤗
I want to thank everyone who read, shared and commented on my stories this year. I welcome and appreciate *all* genuine attempts at dialogue. Americans want to talk about race and it’s my honor to help the conversation along in my role at @AP. Happy holidays and Happy 2019!
One of my last stories of the year was a sad one about voters who felt disenfranchised after waiting hours to cast their ballot in my hometown. Voter suppression was a major midterm theme and I’ll continue to focus on this issue:	https://t.co/iOJ1Je1PUV
https://t.co/baxtHcRmmu
Race took center stage in the midterms and was key to victory and defeat for both parties. Here are a pair of stories I wrote on how race played out on the campaign trail. Stay tuned for more in 2020:	https://t.co/14mga6qiyG
During the midterms, I focused on the black women candidates, voters and organizers who stepped into the foreground and were a huge factor in the elections, as I predicted they would be after Alabama and Virginia (and as they have been for generations):	https://t.co/QZ29b8Sb4m
The Queen of Soul’s death was a milestone and rallying cry in the black community. I covered her marathon homegoing tributes in Detroit:	https://t.co/OyEvymI6Dd
I was obsessed with the cultural optics of the #RoyalWedding. Meghan and Harry did not disappoint:	https://t.co/tnHOzQhTOW
I landed the only interview with the two black men arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a business meeting. It was the beginning of the season of #LivingWhileBlack:	https://t.co/sf6dAaUbUa
In April, I wrote about the 50th anniversary of MLK’s assassination and made an emotional trip to Memphis as a native Atlantan:	https://t.co/NA0RiIdEs1
In February, I had the privilege of helping to cover the Winter Olympics in South Korea. A coverage highlight was the Nigerian women’s bobsled team, a pioneering point of pride for their country: 	https://t.co/qVHHfcO20j
I wrote several stories on the intersection of race and sports. This was part of our “Game Changers” series highlighting the long history of black athlete activism in America:	https://t.co/lCLz0cNIGK
This year was a reminder that the past is prologue. So much of what I wrote about was as much about where we’ve been as where we are as a country. Here are some of the stories I did in 2018 that I’m proudest of: https://t.co/e7XDUwlPom

@Eugene_Scott They won’t volunteer it. Like WWII veterans or Holocaust survivors. But we need to know. We have to ask.
@Eugene_Scott This could not be more urgent. These people are slipping away from us every day. For every obit about a civil rights icon, there are dozens of black people who put their bodies, psyches and faith in this country on the line for us whose contribution we learn about too late.
@Eugene_Scott Black people can talk about the footsoldiers for American freedom IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES. Your grandparents, parents, aunties and uncles helped to perfect this union. Ask them. Honor them. Do it now.
@Eugene_Scott An entire generation of black folks are walking this country, living, working, loving — and having survived something unimaginable to their descendants. And while that experience is part of our muscle memory it must be part of our actual story that we speak and tell our children.

My colleague (and fellow Southerner) @BillBarrowAP and I wrote about our takeaways from #MSSen and some thoughts about the state of play in the South going forward. I hope you'll read and share: https://t.co/zeMGz5VMLs
I wish I'd written more about GOTV efforts happening at black colleges. I'll definitely be paying more attention in 2020. From Tougaloo to Spelman to FAMU, HBCUs were fired up this year. These campuses have a history of civic engagement and a track record of producing leaders.
I had a chance to see black organizing in the South up close this cycle. It doesn't look like the sophisticated machines we're used to seeing from parties; their strength is in cultural institutions like churches, fraternities and sororities, civic groups and black colleges.
Black voters overperformed in some districts and it still wasn't enough to win statewide. But it did help some down ballot candidates, especially black women running for judgeships. This happened in Mississippi and Texas, and last year in Alabama.
And while this has been said, it bears repeating: The storyline in many of these races put Democratic victories on the backs of black voters. High black turnout is necessary because partisan politics are largely a matter of race in the South.
The main takeaway here is that racially polarized politics are still very potent in elections in the South. We saw this in Georgia, Florida and this week in Mississippi. Racist rhetoric and alleged voter suppression worked to discourage and galvanize voters.
The midterms are nearly over (there's still a runoff in Georgia next month), and it's worth pointing out that this cycle had some interesting lessons about race and Southern politics.

RT @samswey: 40% of all black men in the state of Florida just became eligible to vote *today.* Think about that.
He pointed to Florida and the margins for Gillum vs. Nelson. Cliff's question: Their alliance may have netted Nelson black voters but did it help Gillum with white liberals?
Another thing Cliff said: "We need to talk about the white response to an expanded electorate and more candidates of color." Whether they see this as a threat or an opportunity to build coalition affects how they vote.
.@BlackVotersMtr co-founder @cliff_notes said TN Senate candidate Phil Breseden's play-it-safe strategy didn't get him conservatives and could have cost him black votes in his loss to Marsha Blackburn. He said last night's victories showed that approach leaves votes on the table.
The @NAACP president also said voter suppression should be treated as a matter of national security.
There was so much more I could've said on this, but a few highlights here: @DerrickNAACP told me the level of fear in our national climate caused people to focus more on tribalism than the future, that divisive language can plant seeds of fear in whites that can dilute progress.
“At some point, voters have to stop rewarding racist behavior.” Thanks to @MsPackyetti, @cornellbelcher, @cliff_notes and @AyannaPressley for their insights as I look at what the midterms means for candidates of color going forward: https://t.co/baxtHcRmmu

@pm_jawn Talk about it! While I’ve seen a few black men working the polls, when I say black poll workers I’m almost *always* talking about the older black women who are the civic forces of their communities.
No one has ever been prosecuted for their killings. The lynchings were meant to send a message to every black person in the area: Don’t even think about registering, much less casting a ballot.
Wow. While that’s certainly never how I would refer to these heroes, I’ll name four:	✊🏾 Roger Malcom	✊🏾 Dorothy Malcom	✊🏾 George Dorsey	✊🏾 Mae Murray Dorsey 	They were lynched in Jim Crow Georgia in 1946, months after a Supreme Court ruling ended the state’s all-white primary. https://t.co/D2SAuCoJIL

In his acceptance speech Obama mentioned a 106-year-old Atlanta woman who voted early for him. Later that week, I had the honor of interviewing Ann Nixon Cooper. I also spent Inauguration Day with her, which is one of my favorite reporting memories. https://t.co/LydPrkUspP
I spent Election Night at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King preached until he was killed in 1968. Here is the dispatch I filed as part of our national roundup: https://t.co/5eZlXyrzzk
On Election Day, I was with Congressman Lewis as he cast his ballot. Here we are at the polls: https://t.co/Oki3XQGn5P
Later, in the general election, I went with Ambassador Young when he went to early vote for Obama. For a moment at the polls he froze, flashing back to a time when people who looked like him were blocked from casting their ballots. But he voted that day and I wrote about it.
Here’s a link from the story I wrote that night: https://t.co/28pbc8NoMO
I spent the rest of the evening watching news coverage with Ambassador Young at his house and talking to him about the beginnings of what was happening.
I remember covering Super Tuesday with a room full of black Gen Xers. I expected to be in for a long night; my bosses called that race within moments of the polls closing.
At the beginning of the campaign, his fellow civil rights icons, Congressman John Lewis and Ambassador Andrew Young we’re both Hillary Clinton supporters; both had relationships with the Clintons going back decades.
I remember the arc of this election vividly. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, whom I covered regularly, was on board from Day One and one of Obama’s most excited cheerleaders even in his late 80s.
That night, I was a 30-year-old reporter who had gotten her start covering politics by focusing on the young black professional class and civil rights generation — both in abundance in my hometown of Atlanta — in the 2008 election.
As we head into Tuesday’s elections, it’s worth stopping to note that 10 years ago today Barack Obama was elected America’s first black president.

@fivefifths But we have to figure it out. We must tell their stories all the time — not just in February or on anniversaries. Their lives, lived both during and after segregation, continue to bear on our democracy and society. Their status and perspective are unique among Americans.
@ALBDamn 😞 It’s definitely my mom, too. The generation that survived Jim Crow is still very much with us. We must continue to tell their stories, not just on anniversaries but as part of a living, breathing American narrative that plays an ongoing role in our society and democracy.
Black Americans of a certain age are especially familiar with racial and economic anxiety, as well as the threat to voter security — all things that have been the focus of our recent politics, and yet they have not been the face of these conversations. https://t.co/kgsetiXtjr

Gillum’s take in our interview: “I’m a sitting mayor, a sitting elected official. I’m his opponent in this race, but he couldn’t even bring himself to respectfully acknowledge me.” Said he thought the first name reference was intended as a head fake. 1/2

THREE MORE TUESDAYS https://t.co/t3xaJ98po4
“My upper thighs were very tight,” Carlos said. “I wanted to see where Tommie was. If he was not in a position to win it I was going to gut it out.		“But he won, and I am glad.”
Carlos who faded in the stretch, was asked why he appeared to look at Smith during the final strides of the race.
“When they put me on the stretcher, my coach, Stan Wright asked me if I wanted to be scratched. I said ‘No, I want to run.’		“It was a hundred percent try for me or nothing,” Smith said.
Smith, who pulled a muscle in his groin during the semifinals, said there was an 80 percent chance he would not be able to race in the final.
Carlos was asked why all the Negroes were not following the same procedure.		“Each will protest in his own way,” Carlos said.
They also got the silver medal winner, Peter Norman of Australia, to wear a similar button on the victory stand.
They wore knee length black stockings as an added gesture of protest against treatment of Negroes in the United States and green and white buttons which said “Olympic Project for Civil Rights.”
They said the reason they wore only one glove each was that they could get only one pair of black ones, which they shared.
Carlos and Smith wore one pair of black gloves between them, Smith on his right hand and Carlos on his left. They held their hands high during the playing of the National Anthem with fists clenched.
“The reason for the closed fist,” he said, “was to show that black men in America are united. We are gradually — no I mean rapidly — getting closer together.”
He said the reason for wearing the black gloves was to demonstrate their point for both the whites and black back in the United States.
Then Carlos, his eyes glistening, added:		“I want you to print this and print it right. If white people don’t care to see black men perform they should not come out to the stadium.”
“They look upon us as nothing but animals — low animals roaches and ants,” Carlos said.		“We are sort of show horses out there for the white people, they give us peanuts, pat us on the back and say ‘Well boy, you did fine.’”
Carlos said when he and Smith mounted the victory stand he heard applause from the crowd of about 60,000, but also heard a lot of boos and saw people gesturing with thumbs down, like a crowd at a bull fight.
Carlos did most of the speaking but Smith, from Lemoore, Calif., nodded his head in agreement.
Then Carlos told the newsmen he never again would attend an Olympics unless he paid his own way there. This represented a virtual announced boycott of the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany.
In the middle of the press interview after the awards ceremony, Carlos took the bronze medal from around his neck and passed it on to his wife standing in the background.		“This is yours,” the black athlete said. “I do not want it.”
“White America would not understand,” said Carlos, of San Jose, Calif., the militant spokesman for the occasion. “They recognize me only when I do something bad and they call me ‘Negro.’”
Explaining their demonstration on the victory stand, where they held clenched fists in black gloves high over their heads, they said the reason was to show the solidarity of black America.
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tommie Smith and John Carlos leveled a bitter racial blast at the white structure Wednesday night after winning the gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200-meter dash of the Olympic Games.
As a race reporter I am often reminded that so much of our job is to simply state: This Happened.  Here is the @AP story from the night of Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ protest on Oct. 16, 1968, as it appeared in many newspapers the following day.
Fifty years ago today, two American Olympians showed what it meant to champion justice and equality. It would cost them their careers, test their sanity, and earn them the scorn of their fellow citizens. Their protest inspired multitudes and left a legacy that transcends sport. https://t.co/kox8RrqWxY

When she says that no matter what, she’s already won, this is a profound statement. Each breath she has drawn in the past year has been a victory. Each day is a new blessing.
But for real, let her words sink in folks: A year ago, she almost died giving birth. Olympia could have lost her mom. Alexis could’ve lost his wife. Not only could she have not had this moment — she didn’t have to be here, period.

Print it out and prepare your spirit ... The official program for #Aretha's five-hour (scheduled) services, which begin Friday at 10 a.m.: https://t.co/c13DB0srTH
Anyway, I tried to capture some of this for you guys in my story today. #Aretha is for the culture, and for the ages -- and for such a time as this in today's social and political climate. Please read and share! https://t.co/v96q5FLlMk
Also, I can't being to imagine what the economic impact of #Aretha's homegoing tributes must be. I've seen no fewer than a dozen different t-shirt designs. Someone tried to sell me a commemorative book with a CD with 20 of her greatest hits.
The people of Detroit and fans who have come from across the country are showing so much love for #Aretha. Spontaneous cheers, singalongs and shouts of "Ree Ree!" have broken out all over the city this week. It has been amazing to witness.
And yes, I said "homegoing," and not funeral, because that's what this is. #Aretha is going to meet her God after a lifetime as His faithful servant on Earth.
#Aretha has changed outfits EVERY SINGLE DAY. She started Tuesday in red, Wednesday in blue, Thursday in rose gold. Her ensemble for Friday's homegoing? Stay tuned.
This entire week has been for the culture. #Aretha was on view at The Wright Museum, keeper of all things black history for generations.
So I'm in Detroit and really trying to think of when was the last time we saw this much blackness on display for a funeral? Rosa Parks? Coretta Scott King? Whitney Houston? Prince?
Bearing witness for my people is my privilege as a black journalist. I wrote this one for everyone who has ever heard, sang or loved #Aretha.  https://t.co/sVxnu1Bl9W
