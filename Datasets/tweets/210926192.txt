We need to work closely with our allies and regional partners to look at all options to combat ISIL and ensure our citizens are protected.
The United States should have all tools at its disposal to confront the threat posed by this terrorist group.
ISIL clearly poses a new type of threat to the United States as it is well organized, well-funded, and extremely brutal
