In short, strangely enough, the Mississippi Republican Party stuck to its founding principles longer than any other Southern state Republican Party.
holdout in the South was the Mississippi Republican Party. The black-and-tans controlled it until 1932, and after that still were a sizable faction. It was only in the late 1950s and early 1960s that the black-and-tans lost control entirely.
lily-whites won pretty much every time, and ad time went on more and more state Republican parties were taken over by such groups. Many of the takeovers took place in 1920.		Hoover courted the lily-whites of the South in 1928, essentially abandoning the black-and-tans.		The last

Let's remember these people. Their courage should not be forgotten by history.
Not every Southern politician was a segregationist. Some stood up for what was right. Those that did should be remembered.		There are more, by the way. LeRoy Collins. Roy Turner. Frank Porter Graham. Augustus Stanley. Mike Monroney. Estes Kefauver.
No one remembers Jack Brooks of Texas, who helped write the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
No one remembers Luther Patrick of Alabama, who in 1942 gave a speech condemning the use of the poll tax on the House floor. He was primaried later that year because of it, but won the primary for the seat two years later and came back.
No one remembers Brooks Hays of Arkansas, who tried to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Little Rock Nine crisis, and who then lost his seat in the House of Representatives to a last-minute write-in campaign by segregationist Dale Alford.
Democratic Party tried to have all candidates sign.
No one remembers Charles Weltner of Georgia, who voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1966, and who refused to run for reelection in 1966 because he wouldn't sign a loyalty pledge to Lester Maddox that the Georgia
No one remembers Carl Albert, who entered Congress in 1947 as a segregationist but by 1964 was helping secure votes for the Civil Rights Act.
No one remembers William Mahone, a former Confederate general who after the war founded a biracial political party that for a time prevented white supremacists from taking control of Virginia's state government.
No one remembers Ben Johnson of Kentucky, the only Southern Democratic Representative to vote in favor of the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill in 1922.
What I think is so sad is that it appears history has forgotten those Southern politicians who risked their career to support civil rights. No one remembers Richard Fulton, or Charles Weltner, or Brooks Hays, or Claude Pepper, or Ralph Yarborough, or Carl Albert.

You know, other than the Civil Rights Act of 1991, I'm pretty sure Trent Lott voted against every bit of civil rights legislation that came up while he was in Congress. He voted against reauthorization of the VRA in both 1981 and 1992, voted against the Civil Rights Restoration

The idea that the Democratic Party only embraced free trade starting with Bill Clinton is a myth peddled by the far-left.
Even William Jennings Bryan railed against protectionism!		FDR shifted the Democratic Party firmly to the center-left...but one of the major parts of the New Deal was reciprocal trade agreements to reduce tariffs.		Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter...all supported free trade.
the Democratic Party has *ever* had a protectionist as their candidate for President. The party was founded in the 1820s as a conservative, pro-free trade party, and starting in the 1890s shifted to being progressive on economic issues, while continuing to support free trade.
parties' candidates supported free trade.		1988	Dukakis: Protectionism	Bush: Free trade		From 1992 to 2016, both parties once again supported free trade on the presidential arena.		2016	Clinton: Free trade	Trump: Protectionism		Dukakis in 1988 is literally the only time that
1928	Smith: Free trade	Hoover: Protectionism	1932	FDR: Free trade	Hoover: Protectionism	1936	FDR: Free trade	Landon: Free trade	1940	FDR: Free trade	Willkie: Free trade	1944	FDR: Free trade	Dewey: Protectionism	1948	Truman: Free trade	Dewey: Free trade		From 1948 to 1988, both

Corporate income taxes generate very little revenue. Lowering them discourages outsourcing because companies typically move overseas because the country they're moving to has a lower corporate tax rate.

disenfranchise people of their right to vote. In short, no one really liked his view on civil rights, which amounted to believing that the Southern states could be trusted to end segregation without federal interference. Goldwater was not a prejudiced man - he founded the Arizona

@BenAdamsO_O @KDbyProxy @StevenTDennis Thurmond *did* move towards generic conservatism rather than segregationism as time went on.

@RLM_3 @Kenclarkmedia He voted to make MLK Day a national holiday, and he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1991. He also voted for the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1986 (the Reagan amnesty). He did renounce racism. Thurmond was a horrible person, but he didn't die a segregationist.
@RLM_3 @Kenclarkmedia Thurmond *did* evolve. I'll definitely give you Helms as an example of a racist until the end, though.

Goldwater has no path to victory in such a scenario. The bloc that did go for him in 1964 (racist Southern whites) won't do so in 1968. Blacks won't like him because he still opposes the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Midwest hates him because he opposes farm subsidies. And the

They started caring again in the 1890s, then abandoned blacks again, and started caring once again in the 1910s. But for long periods of time, Republicans courted white supremacist voters in the South, pushing black leaders to the side to court "lily white Republicans."
Republicans stopped caring about civil rights when it stopped being politically expedient.
Reminder that Republicans literally abandoned black people in the South and left them at the mercy of white supremacist militias in exchange for enough electoral votes to keep the presidency. They let the Redeemers win...in exchange for the presidency.
I just thought of the most damning argument against "the Civil War was fought over states' rights" - if that had been the case, Stephen Douglas would have swept the Southern states in a landslide in the 1860 election, and the Fugitive Slave Act wouldn't have been passed.

The states in red are the ones where resistance to civil rights was strong. Texas's congressional delegation by 1965 was pretty evenly split in half between civil rights supporters and those opposed to civil rights, with segregationists holding a slight majority. https://t.co/xj4wdA0ggu

One of the claims made by the people who say "Democrats are the real racists" is that Albert Gore Sr, father of Vice President Al Gore, was one of the anti-civil rights Southern Democrats. But Gore had a complicated and mostly positive civil rights record.

The third group consisted of politicians who didn't give a shit either way about civil rights. If they deemed supporting civil rights to be politically expedient, they would support civil rights. If they deemed supporting segregationism to be the best strategy for getting
The first group were the most virulent racists. Lester Maddox is an example. The second group instinctively recoiled from what they deemed to be excessive federal authority. They put the New Deal and civil rights legislation in the same group. Think libertarians but on steroids.

@BenScionti @joncprevo Do you actually believe that they just hate women? Your analysis lacks any nuance and comes down to "people who oppose abortion are anti-woman." This is as stupid an argument as pro-lifers claiming people who are pro-choice just like killing babies.
@BenScionti @joncprevo women who can't pay for it out of pocket.
@BenScionti @joncprevo about it. I think a constitutional amendment would have been better than a nonsensical argument that abortion falls under a right to privacy. I used to be pro-choice but supportive of the Hyde Amendment, until I read about the fact that it disproportionately affects low-income
@BenScionti @joncprevo They don't view it that way. I think they don't realize that illegal abortions are even a thing. They think ending all legal abortion would mean that no abortions happen. My position is that of supporting legalized abortion but opposing the Roe v. Wade decision as the way to go

@corbetkt @RogerWicker Whitten actually started off as a segregationist, but became a supporter of civil rights in the 1970s. He voted for both the Civil Rights Act of 1990 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. I'd consider him a "reformed segregationist" like Byrd - those who abandoned their racism.
Based on his other responses to questions, it appears that interestingly enough, Thurmond stopped being racist sometime between 1964 and 1996. I'm surprised even *he* changed. Looks like Jesse Helms and Trent Lott were the only segregationists left in the Senate by that point.

Colmer. After Colmer retired from the House of Representatives, Lott switched parties and successfully ran for his boss's old seat.
Stennis served in the Senate until 1988, and was the Dean of the Senate at the time of his departure. Republican Trent Lott succeeded him in that seat. Coincidentally, Lott started his political career as an intern to another Democratic candidate way back in 1947 - William M.
@bushlover2016 Yeah, but he also became an anti-immigrant activist.
The special election in Mississippi held on November 4, 1947 for the Senate seat vacated by the death of segregationist Democrat Theodore G. Bilbo had quite a wide field of contenders - five different Democratic candidates (all were segregationists) and one Republican. https://t.co/9xyCkR26Ti

Obama's foreign policy is horrible in 2008. Pulling out of Iraq? We just won the peace last year with the surge! He also talks about renegotiating NAFTA and other deals. Protectionism and dovishness isn't my thing. McCain has picked Palin as his running mate, and she's a gaffe
handling the reconstruction. He has no mandate. Kerry praises the removal of Saddam, but criticizes how Bush has handled the reconstruction of Iraq. He's also supportive of free trade, environmentalism, and is liberal on social issues. Kerry gets my vote.
But Gore has it all - environmentalism, hawkish foreign policy, continuation of Clinton's foreign policy. Whereas Bush sounds way too dovish with his talk about removing troops. Gore all the way.		I support the Iraq War effort, but I can tell that Bush is utterly inept at

This is a horrible Democratic ticket. Reagan gets my vote again.		1988 is...odd. I like Dukakis's opposition to capital punishment, but he's a gaffe machine (the fucking tank!) and he's a protectionist. Plus, I like H. W. Bush a lot. Put me in the Bush column.		1992 has two

But 1944 is quite a different story. Though Dewey pledges to fight the war to its end, he also says he'll bring back protectionist policies after the war ends. However, FDR is now on my bad side because of Japanese internment. Dewey gets my vote, but I'm not happy about my
While Willkie continues the Republican tendency to support protectionism, at long last the Republicans have abandoned isolationism. He wants to actually do something about what's going on in Europe, while Democrats are the isolationists suddenly. Willkie gets my vote.
But FDR's second term genuinely frightens me. Court packing? This is the act of a dictator. He's attempting to mess with the Supreme Court so it stops striking down his laws! This isn't what the Founding Fathers intended. And 1940 brings Wendell Willkie as the Republican nominee.
FDR gets my vote.		By 1936, the Republicans still haven't learned their lesson. They nominate arch-conservative Alf Landon, who continues the pattern of running on protectionism and isolationism. And Democrats finally add support for civil rights to their platform. FDR again.
Exacerbating the Depression by passing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Protectionism isn't what America needs in this trying time, yet the Republicans go for it anyway.		1932 arrives. FDR is very attractive as a candidate - free trade, progressive reforms, entry into the League.

Joe Manchin sucks. But he's the type of Democrat that can compete in West Virginia. He's the best we've got. And every additional Democrat in the Senate is a vote for Chuck Schumer as Senate Majority Leader.
I definitely hate some Dems based on policy positions. But I wouldn't call for them to be primaried unless they're seriously problematic outside of their policy positions.
Stop trying to primary Dems based on voting record. Primary them if they're horrible people, like Cardenas, like Jackson Lee, like Hastings.
Ideally, the Republican Party would also be a big tent.
I'll say it again: the Democratic Party is a big tent. It's not supposed to be subject to purity testing. Purity testing led to the Republican Party being consumed by the Tea Party and its liberal and moderate wings defecting to the Democrats.

@bushlover2016 Where does the Constitution mention health insurance AT ALL?
@bushlover2016 HEART Act was a proposed bill in the Senate back in 1993 put forward by a bipartisan coalition as an alternative to the Clinton healthcare proposal. It included an individual mandate and tort reform, among other things.
@bushlover2016 "A. Government has no constitutional authority to regulate health insurance, if your insurer is within your state."		Since when?
@bushlover2016 But it IS a tax. The Supreme Court ruled it as such.		And it really makes no sense that conservatives started opposing the individual mandate considering it has its origin in legislation proposed by conservative Republicans (HEART Act).

that retrain workers who have had their jobs outsourced so that they can pursue new careers outside of manufacturing.
Unions need to stop opposing free trade and advocate, instead, for expanding and improving the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. We cannot stop globalization in order to try to ensure these people keep their current jobs - instead, we should focus on strengthening programs
