@ComradeDaybed @JohnAnzo “She has never been anything but respectful of all her colleagues”	Are we just going to ignore her actively trying to get them primaried?
@SailorHaumea Kentucky and Arkansas?
@SailorHaumea @jackcurran49 @politicsluo I’m disappointed you didn’t use the phrasing “immigration stance” so I could make a Minneapolis airport joke.
@SenhorRaposa I’m hoping he takes out Raskin lmfao
@krazgreinetz @jackcurran49 The diamondback op-Ed columnists are like almost all DSA members lmfao no wonder it’s absolutely garbage
@SenhorRaposa It’s so weird to think of Rubio as a party leader lmfao
@JeffreyToobin Must be your first time watching a hearing, then.
@TossupReport @SenhorRaposa @phanthanhtom He was one of the only northern R’s to vote against Ex-Im, along with like Amash Huizenga Jim Jordan Scott Garrett and the like
@TossupReport @BlueDogPAC @HouseBlueDogs https://t.co/Uu1ZiPdcnO He wasn't officially endorsed by them if I understand correctly, but joined after the Congress started. He's listed here on the Caucus membership page.
@jaselzer Is there a breakdown of the Iowa Caucus Poll by Congressional District? Thanks, and keep up the great work!
@SenhorRaposa Don’t give them any ideas.
@TriviaCrack Is trivia live done forever or is this temporary?
@TossupReport @GregOrman He has a child named Imogen that is a name I’ve never heard before
@codepink @BenjaminNorton @BootsRiley @MaxBlumenthal @RaniaKhalek @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @ggreenwald @aaronjmate @dancohen3000 @MsJodieEvans @medeabenjamin @vijayprashad @FAIRmediawatch @mrdannyglover Thank you for providing an easy to access list of people whose opinions are worthless and I can ignore!
@ne0liberal DC also has absurdly strict height restrictions.
@jackcurran49 Hopefully the media will actually call him on them this time. Last time they were more interested in there being a close race with Hillary but this time the field is so crowded they’ll have no excuse.
@_alex_joshua Also, China’s population is more concentrated than ours. Americans are spread out on both coasts, the Midwest, south, etc. whereas China is pretty concentrated in the east and center.
@ne0liberal It infuriates me how often people list 2020 candidates and include Andrew yang and Marianne Williamson but not Delaney.
@TossupReport And ignore John Delaney and Jay Inslee. If you include a guru and a random tech dude at least include the governor of Washington and a US Congressman
@samzhang428 Disagree on Maine; Sanders is a fellow New Englander and the state has a thing for populists and “outsiders”
@Jack_W002 @GabeTheCentrist @jackcurran49 I’m gonna disagree—it was the lone EVEN state in the 2012 CPVI calculations, had a GOP Governor from 09-13, and came very close to electing a GOP Senator in 2014.
@SenhorRaposa I wouldn’t‘ve enjoyed 1896 twitter much either lol
@SenhorRaposa Also he’s embraced some popular stances regarding taxes and schools and alcohol. He’s really fascinating cause he’s from Takoma Park—basically the Berkeley of Maryland, very dense area on the DC border—yet has become popular across partisan and geographic lines
@SenhorRaposa He’s competent at a position where competent leadership is crucial and a democratic ally of a popular GOP governor
@andkenbr @AndrewSolender Well, in gore’s case he could’ve used a little help in Graham’s home state tbh
@SenhorRaposa I think Stephen Wolf from DKE said he contacted the board of elections and asked for the data and they had it on hand but not on their website.
@ahardtospell C a n d i d a t e  o f  p e a c e
@jackcurran49 @_alex_joshua Ditching DesJarlais makes this a very very tempting offer tbh
@DecisionDeskHQ @JMilesColeman The link is dead, is there a way I could access the maps from the article?
@SailorHaumea Him and Dingell were the last WWII vets to serve in Congress :(((
@lnsiebert @politicsluo @PoliticsWolf @IAmKrishanPatel And then Guam, the USVI, American Samoa, and the NMI
@PNWwonk And not all of it worked, and not all of it was constitutional.
@mtracey Surprise surprise, obnoxious political gadfly has absurd, disgusting opinions. More news at 11.
@ElectionMapsCo Alright, requested. Thank you so much! Been loving this series, keep up the great work!
@ElectionMapsCo Great map! Is there anywhere I can access the data behind this? I’m curious about Perot’s performances.
@NateSilver538 It’s something he’s failed to understand his whole career.
@MarkSalter55 The scary thing is, these people actually do think that’s what we need.
@samzhang428 Because gerrymandering is only bad if republicans do it silly
@SailorHaumea Henry Clay? I guess Muhlenberg technically bc he was the first
@SailorHaumea Frank Lucas and Tom Cole are excellent
@jackcurran49 Shoutout to UMD lmaooo
@PNWwonk He’s honestly the best candidate his biggest problem is no one knows who the hell he is and that isn’t changing soon lmaoooo
@jackcurran49 This is quality stuff! Do you know if anyone’s calculated for 2004 and/or 2000? I’ve seen a couple states, I think, but not all of them.
@JuliaCarmel__ @AOC Who on earth lies about major details of their upbringing and heritage for political gain?
@_alex_joshua Also do y’all really wanna give Donald trump the power to tax mosques lmaooo
@jackcurran49 I don’t think he’s ever put that much thought into anything. You’re being quite generous.
@SailorHaumea @Richhomiezeker @jackcurran49 @SenhorRaposa @POTUSCAPOTE2057 1988; pretty democratic. 1944, also democratic, especially S and W of Pittsburgh. https://t.co/TN3JmsxZOX
@BSchorshy TYPING IN ALL CAPS DOESNT CHANGE THAT YOU’RE WRONG
@jackcurran49 Tbh this applies to her whole shtick
@SenhorRaposa I found out when that twitter account was like “don’t vote for her she’s bad for black people” and listed that “she’s a swirler” as a reason
@neontaster I mean the British did once do that
@SenhorRaposa Nah didn’t you see what Sean McElwee said about this???
@SeanMcElwee How is it that every single tweet of yours somehow manages to be worse than the last one
@jackcurran49 There’s literally a million things I hate about him but one of the things that’s weirdest to me is how he makes his display name “we’re going to (goal of whatever radical cause he’s taken up this week as the pinnacle of human morality)”
@codepink You don’t give a rat’s ass about democracy or human rights beyond being buzzwords to attack America with.
@NicolasMaduro Ladron.
@ggreenwald @mehdirhasan Glen, you’re a disgusting shill for the world’s worst regimes. Your only principle is whether they hate America and the West as much as you do—no surprise that you’d be parroting the line Maduro and his buddies in Cuba want you to spew. Maduro is evil and needs to go.
@HotlineJosh Frankly I bet it’s cause technically not ALL Black Hebrew Israelites are part of a hate group—although I think it’s fair to say the ones involved here were quite possibly part of a hate group given their disgusting rhetoric.
@IlhanMN At least you’re defending “Israelites,” which I guess is in a way progress?
@fbgchase @samandjabbari Suh, Talib, and Peters. Also, having little real fan base and leaving the people of St. Louis on a bad note doesn’t help.
@JMilesColeman Chris Van Hollen! Also the chair of both DCCC and the DSCC which is unprecedented.
@ne0liberal Makes me sad that the 2000 RNC support for the Delaware plan never came to anything.
@PeterBurnsESPN Saints: yesterday, 2017 divisional vs Vikings, 2011 divisional vs 49ers, 2006 championship vs Bears               Nationals: 2012 NLDS Game 5 vs Cardinals
@chris_g_pino @SenhorRaposa @SailorHaumea Hasn’t this been the case in the past too? At least, when the Dems had the house in the past
@ne0liberal To get a job as a cable news panelist
@jackcurran49 Josh Gottheimer 😍
@rhona_kate @J4Years They may’ve had interns to do it, interns don’t get furloughed or anything so they come in handy during a shutdown—it’s part of how bill and Monica got to know each other
@BruneElections The president being Donald trump or the president being whoever the president of the United States is at any given moment?
@AsInMarx Delaney deserves an asterisk, his victory over Bartlett in 2012 was contested on radically different turf than had made Bartlett an incumbent.
@_alex_joshua I think we’ve seen recently that popular state level politicians have no chance if they’re going against their state’s political leaning for a federal race.
@JMilesColeman @VApoliticalmeme Not to mention she was so crucial in spearheading the reconstruction of the Superdome—a move that may well have kept the saints in New Orleans and played a big role in the psychological recovery of the region. I think it’s quite appropriate to honor her at the Superdome
@SailorHaumea @jackcurran49 Hey now in her defense she‘s “not a witch”
@mtracey She. Supports. Assad.
@SenhorRaposa Hey they once came within low double digits of winning the mayoral election in the last quarter century which tbh is better than a fair amount of big city GOPs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@ashtonpittman @thehill For sure, but not the NRCC—the most they’ll do is recruit candidates or name them to their “Young Guns” or “Vanguard” programs
@decunningham2 I alternate each time I go. Too tough of a decision.
@thehill This isn’t a story—the NRCC doesn’t get involved in primaries lmao
@SenhorRaposa Money well spent—what an incredible site it is.
@BruneElections @joncprevo Imo that’s in part because Maryland has a much more polarized and inelastic electorate than Massachusetts does but you’re absolutely right
@Adorably_Nerdy @BenScionti He also was tied to BDS in a heavily Jewish district
(Big shoutout to @cinyc9 for his tutorial, by the way!)
Bush's district voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, 51.5%-44.3% (53.8%-46.2% Two Party), for a margin of 7.2%. https://t.co/4m651HmARn
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah A little project I've been working on, looking at former Presidents' districts they represented in the House. The last ex-Rep., George H.W. Bush (R) represented Texas' 7th Congressional District (Western Harris County) from 1967-71... https://t.co/Ync6m7qHab
@RashidaTlaib This is a disgusting dog whistle and you know it.
@Karandikar18 Voting for bush over Kerry in my preschool’s mock election cause I thought it’d be disrespectful to vote against the president
@ne0liberal Opened up the doc, trying my hardest to keep an open mind but abandoned that when I saw “Sean McElwee”
@allahpundit I cannot believe CNN once gave him his own show lmao
@McF_Nbctoday @_alex_joshua For me it’s Dave Brat—&gt;Spanberger, although just about anyone would’ve been an upgrade over Brat
@politicobsessed @dexxxbers17 Best 2R: IA 2D: DE, WA mixed: WV, ME Worst 2R: AR, TX 2D: NJ, MA mixed: PA, WI although neither are that bad per se
@welldrawndog @ChadPergram Ah yes because he should be primaried over nominations to the national postal inspection board?
@HMSPitts “Dems should gerrymander too to offset when the republicans do it!!!”
@ActorAaronBooth Wait did DRA undergo a redesign?
@neontaster Not to mention James “if the civil war starts while I’m in office it’s actually Lincoln’s problem” Buchanan
@SenhorRaposa After he lost the Dropkick Murphys to Martin O’Malley, he had no chance.
@ChazNuttycombe I honestly haven’t seen any donut twitter tbh
@_alex_joshua John K. Delaney 😍
@Adorably_Nerdy @rudnicknoah He isn’t, that’s his dad Bob Casey Sr—but he’s kinda allowed the misunderstanding to slide when it’s electorally beneficial lol
@maestro876 @JMilesColeman *GOP voters
@maestro876 @JMilesColeman He’s only one of two to win re-election with fewer EVs than initially; other was Woodrow Wilson, who cruised in 1912 cause the GOP was split between TR and Taft
@BenjaminNorton @Ostrov_A Why don’t you go back to what you do best, Ben, parroting Russian and Syrian propaganda and endangering the lives of those exposing their crimes?
@ActorAaronBooth Is there anywhere I can see the individual maps? This is incredibly well done!
@SenhorRaposa Anyone who is screaming “THIS IS BOTHSIDEISM” is just revealing that they belong in the same category as him.
@JayCostTWS Tbh I think that’s being very generous to him—don’t think he cared when it was really from as long as it hurt bush.
@SeanMcElwee It’d be funny how ignorant you are if you didn’t have nearly 90k followers.
@_alex_joshua For the Kazakh one do you mean the Borat version or the real one
@haytoft @politicsluo It’s the lack of hair
@_alex_joshua Wait sorry for so much commentary about the list lmao but the biggest omission I see is def Scott DesJarlais
@_alex_joshua My bad i missed Ellison haha replace his name with Eddie Bernice Johnson
@_alex_joshua IMO Barbara Lee deserves a place on here, as do Dave Brat and Keith Ellison if we’re including soon to depart congressmen. Again I strongly agree with most of this, very solid list
@_alex_joshua I’d put mark meadows in there instead of Swalwell but otherwise very solid list
@SenhorRaposa It’s somewhat understandable but my biggest question is why’d he do it so late in the campaign? It wasn’t until there were just days left in the campaign that he did so
@BruneElections Not only did two former NFL players win, representing opposing parties, but they faced off against each other on opposing teams in a game once. (Gonzalez, R-OH w/ the Colts, Allred, D-TX w/the Titans in their Dec 28, 2008 game)
@B_M_Finnigan Congrats! Which CD?
@greenealogist96 @RedistrictNet Very clear that you put effort into it though and it’s a pretty solid map—certainly miles better than the status quo—so kudos to that also props for taking constructive criticism so well lmao
@greenealogist96 @RedistrictNet Not sure I agree with your MD-07; Montgomery and Howard have much in common, yes, but not as much in common as southern moco and western PG, which form more of a coherent community.
@JMilesColeman And it’d been within a half a point in 2000 and within 5 in 2004
@ClaraSorrenti Organizing a plan with the Nazis to invade Poland together was *checks notes* one of the greatest anti-fascist moves in history
@jackcurran49 @SailorHaumea Oh my bad the brightness of my screen was screwy so it looked blank haha
@jackcurran49 @SailorHaumea Think that map is missing Richmond NY (Staten Island) which was McCain Obama Trump.
@RosLehtinen @jaketapper @MDCollege And thank God it did. America and the world are better off because of your public service—thank you Congresswoman.
@TossupReport Where did you learn such wizardry I’ve had a hellish time trying to pull a conversion from DRA to QGIS off
@ArminRosen CTH being anti Semitic??? Why I never would’ve expected that!!!
@jgm41 Waited three hours in 30-some degree weather and it was absolutely worth every second.
@emilysumiko @ChazNuttycombe I’m joking because the answer in mind was Beto but Ojeda has also been compared to jfk lol
@NateSilver538 @ryangrim Grim just wants to be a jackass, nothing new
@andrewdamitio I wonder who the least recent president with a federal judge still serving is
@ChazNuttycombe Ojeda? https://t.co/qL1JE3Aoyf
@SenSherrodBrown If you actually cared, you’d oppose the tariffs that hurt GM and other companies so much.
@NateSilver538 Regarding 2, if it’s Chris McDaniel, I’ll pass…
@JMilesColeman @jmartNYT Interesting to me how Beto seems to have notably underperformed in east and south Texas compared to Obama and I wonder how much of that is demographics; in an area where non-white voters key to democratic numbers, were these voters simply more motivated for Obama+midterm drop?
@mfa_russia Russia starved millions and denies its crimes. Disgraceful but not unexpected.
@amyserwinowski @Minimuh2017 @RJPilkenton @SteveKornacki The ballots are designed at the county level. Other areas, including Democratic ones, didn't have this problem. This is a false talking point designed to stir up a partisan controversy where there is none.
@PoliticsWolf yeah but what about the main prize, Mines Inspector?
@PoliticsWolf @JMilesColeman Is the updated interactive version of the non-Partisan map (w/data for 2016 if possible) available online anywhere? The one I've found has a different Michigan map than what I've found on Dropbox and your cover photo.
@mtracey LOL
@IAmKrishanPatel Imo he just isn’t qualified. A state legislator isn’t enough experience to be president and I think especially with trump we’re seeing just how essential experience is for that office.
@BruneElections 1) Tbh not really a huge fan of any	2) Mitt Romney	3) Jeff van Drew/Anthony Gonzalez
@politicsluo Who knows, Chris van Hollen went from DCCC to the Senate.
@ryanmatsumoto1 @nathanlgonzales I concur with the point of this tweet but imo a big reason the dems did so well in IL-03 is that the GOP candidate was an unabashed Nazi
@andrewdamitio Idk if I’d call Sanford “moderate” but I get what you’re saying
@andrewdamitio It irrationally bugs me that it’s “NC-9” while every other single digit seat is “XX-09”
@SethAMandel At least Cockburn lost
@JMilesColeman Free space should be Walter Jones.
@rudnicknoah I mean part of that is that he was the only election taking place at that time
@JMilesColeman Sick in the hospital as an 8 year old coloring in a map and I remember being very irate that my dad was encouraging me to color Texas red before NBC had called it for McCain
@JMilesColeman This is one of your best ones lmaooo
@TossupReport @politicsluo Tbh that’s understandable he’s probably among the most forgettable member: he’s got no compelling personal narrative (dad was senator) and no cohesive community (he reps MD-03, the “broken pterodactyl”) as well as extremely run of the mill generic D positions
@scaredjackal @SuspendedNo7 @NateSilver538 @ruckus2 @ORACLE_of_Blair @FiveThirtyEight @gelliottmorris @DecisionDeskHQ In fact he was mocked by many for giving Hillary too LOW of a chance
@politicsluo If Ben Nighthorse Campbell were still in office, I’d put my money on him—Olympic judo captain—or Jon Runyan, hard to bet against an All-Pro lineman.
@JMilesColeman @mcimaps I’m out of the loop what’s the Shalala meme?
@pottairi @politicsluo Tbh I don’t know about this one—whoever the R was didn’t have the dual bonuses of being Larry Hogan and running against the O’Malley administration
@Ahmadinejad1956 Would’ve been nice if you’d put your money where your mouth is. You are a disgrace.
@politicsluo @JMizzle36 I’ve noticed they tend to be slow to update compared to Cook and Crystal Ball.
@rudnicknoah CA-39
@rudnicknoah Wait nvm someone called that lemme look again
@rudnicknoah MN-03, Dan McCready
@ChazNuttycombe For US House 80-20 Jamie Raskin 	MoCo CE 50-40-10 Elrich-Floreen-Ficker	MD-Gov 50-50 Hogan-Jealous
@politicsluo 16 Ron Johnson, 14 Dave Brat, 12 Joe Donnelly (at least, pre-Mourdock rape comments), 10 Lisa Murkowski, 08 Joe Cao, 06 Jim Webb
@JayCaruso I think there’s some long running protest by a group against circumcision I’ve seen them camped out at the SCOTUS before
@charliekirk11 Uh primary challenges haven’t worked against her before...https://t.co/r3wQzEU5xp
@JMilesColeman living his best life as President of Purdue which, even though I wish he was POTUS, I don't remotely blame him for taking.
@SaysSimonson That hotel is the "Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport" too lol
@Marcus_Mosher This is something straight from the onion tbh
@KielTWilliams @wallace_milner I think part of it is the "maverick" sort of politics of La Follette practiced are notoriously hard to pin down because of the way DW-N categorizes; for example, Walter Jones of NC is graded as moderate despite being very much a libertarian type. McCarthy was less a unique voice
@ForecasterEnten Helps that DeSantis is too extreme for the general electorate tbh
@smithmarion I agree that they belong on there because the communist regime is committing atrocities on breathtaking scale (as is case the world over), but list appears limited to OECD members. Likely bc iirc OECD countries have to commit to transparency standards that PRC won't ever accept
@JZTessler Very impressive--I'm mapping some of the other MD primaries, do you know where I can find a guide on how to show the level of support for the winner if there are 3 or more candidates? ie how would I show that Jealous won X w/35%, Baker won Y w/40% and Shea won Z w/30%
@wmata car 3069, on an orange line train bound for Vienna, has a broken A.C. I tried calling y’all but you were closed for the day
@JZTessler Very good job, insightful and well done, I'm thoroughly impressed--where is the data from? I can't find any precinct level data on https://t.co/mhYqluLns0 :(
@richeisen 2 lefty QBs in the Hall of Fame now--Kenny Stabler was inducted recently. Loving your coverage, keep up the great work!
@JMilesColeman Morning Call is something we should all give thanks for
@amyewalter @CharlieCookDC @CookPolitical @Redistrict @jennifereduffy Is there anywhere I can find historic PVI values? Having access to them for a school project would be valuable. Keep up the great work!
@cwm396 I totally agree haha but--he's not an elected official, you may be thinking of Gov. Roy Cooper of N.C.
@JMilesColeman B for data that's for large areas ie counties/parishes; A for precinct data
@contrarymary197 @gelliottmorris 90% sure it's '06 because the Dems have two seats in KS and don't have Perriello's seat in central VA
@baseballcrank @WellspringGP From the FAQ page, Leip says it comes from habit, given that in the 80s, when he got into maps, R=blue D=red
@JMilesColeman @mcimaps @paulajean2018 And to push across an absurd argument, too. Yikes.
@JMilesColeman Mr. Coleman--really love each and every map you make! Keep it up. Do you use just GIS software for them?
@JMilesColeman @DecisionDeskHQ Very excited--these pieces are some of my favorite articles online, period. Keep up the great work!
@JMilesColeman @RRHElections @DecisionDeskHQ You could also call it "Mountain Maryland" if you're really into alliteration
@daveweigel ...and Duberstein's tenure ended because his boss was term limited
@sfpathe Great article on John Delaney's presidential bid--but I think you misspelled Amie Hoeber and David Vogt's names. I've done it too
@garagekidd @stargazzr_ @nbcwashington  It isn't the same guy as the one who was beat up
RT @EricLGuerci: Tommy showed up at schools without a backpack today. He claims it's nowhere to be found
