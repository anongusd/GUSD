“African American women know all too well the damage that guns can do. African American men are 6 percent of the population and 47 percent of the homicide deaths.” — Diane Weathers, former editor-in-chief of @essence &amp; former Brady board member #EndGunViolence
“...We’ve got to find a way that...mothers on both sides begin to work together &amp; stand up to the violence that’s in our communities b/c no one’s winning. We’re losing them to incarceration or the cemetery — b/c both is death.” — Dr. Dorothy Johnson-Speight of @KCMothersCharge

In short: Gun violence in America is an epidemic. And we need solutions now. 		#Aurora #EnoughisEnough https://t.co/DwUx5yM1SK
According to @bostonglobe, the #Aurora shooter had been arrested 6 times in IL, including for domestic battery. 		Once again, we see the escalation and connection between #domesticviolence and mass shootings. 		https://t.co/CtX3r6diKC	#Aurora #EnoughisEnough #EndDV
At the same time, mass shootings like yesterday’s tragedy are also up. 		According to @FBI, there were 30 active shooting incidents in 2017. 		138 people were killed in those shootings — the first time the death toll rose above 90 in a single year. 		#Aurora #EnoughisEnough
That means gun violence makes up an overwhelming 79% of workplace homicides. 		Seventy-nine percent.		Let that sink in. 		#Aurora #EnoughisEnough
Shootings accounted for 394 of the 500 workplace homicides that took place in 2016, which is the most recent year for which @BLS_gov has data. 		#Aurora #EnoughisEnough
Every year, 2 million American workers report having been victims of workplace violence. The DEADLIEST situations involve an active shooter. 		#Aurora #EnoughisEnough
Fatal workplace shootings like yesterday's are becoming more and more frequent — climbing every year since 2014. 		#Aurora #EnoughisEnough
It’s UNCONSCIONABLE that gun violence has become so commonplace that we now have to ask “which one?” in reference to #Aurora.		Amid a year since #Parkland, yesterday’s mass shooting makes clear that gun violence is the REAL #NationalEmergency. 		Here are the facts. Thread 👇
