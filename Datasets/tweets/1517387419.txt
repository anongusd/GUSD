“It is entirely inappropriate to view any trade with Canada as a national security threat to the United States." https://t.co/ejzvgcBBYU
“The United States has a $2-billion surplus in steel trade with Canada. Canada buys more American steel than any other country in the world, accounting for 50% of U.S. exports." https://t.co/ejzvgcBBYU
“As a key NORAD and NATO ally, and as the number one customer of American steel, Canada would view any trade restrictions on Canadian steel and aluminum as absolutely unacceptable. Any restrictions would harm workers, the industry and manufacturers on both sides of the border." https://t.co/U8W7t9W2kb
