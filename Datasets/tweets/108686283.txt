@MikeMadden sorry. I've been here before.
@BobbyBancroft I don't know. 58 currently in RPI, 3-6 in league. So if finish in 6-3 (plus 1 BET win), gotta think that's 40-something RPI.

Many people are saying the fact that Trump felt the need to defend himself by highlighting that he's a germaphobe is very interesting.
There it is, the President-Elect, muttering as an afterthought, "I think it was Russia," then moving on as quickly as he can to downplay it.
No one in media should take lectures on responsibility from a guy who owes his political career to a conspiracy theory about Obama's birth.

Hm. Rubio says the Democratic Party has become radicalized &amp; if the GOP frontrunner were so radical, "you'd hear stories about it every day"
Rubio: Obama is "a bad commander-in-chief." Adds that if Obama were a Republican, he'd say the same thing.

Heard the most succinct explanation of Trump's appeal while getting a haircut yesterday: "I actually like Trump. That guy's crazy, man."
Trump is still winning. By a lot. And it's almost December.  https://t.co/X5fM8d3O7W
RT @baltimoresun: ESPN2 didn't show the start of the Maryland-Georgetown game, and fans got angry. https://t.co/1On8HGMnQU
@BenStandig uh. Ok.
RT @GUVoiceSports: JTIII: "[Derrickson] did well, but we expect him to play well."
@MikeMadden the 0-4 possibility is so strong and daunting though.
@MikeMadden weirdly, I'm pretty certain  this is the most talented team we've had since at least 2012.
RT @NationWideNolan: GOOD.  https://t.co/FfUZtRrv1Z
On the bright side, pretty certain this year's Hoyas are the best 0-2 NCAA hoops team I've seen in quite some time.
RT @BobbyBancroft: Georgetown has never started a season 0-3. Hoyas need to beat Wisconsin on Friday to avoid making history.
@ScottFConroy no really @espn show is the foul call at the end of the Georgetown Maryland game.
I want to see a replay of that foul call and also to have these refs future assignments based on whether it was correct.
Win win win
It's incredible that we've done this without DSR. But like, put him in now.
I don't know how else to explain that Bradley "Willie Mays" Hayes is really, really good.
@MikeMadden you've been round the block long enough to expect a win in this particular scenario though.
DSR time.
Ready to set Bradley Hayes' floor at Hank Sims' senior season.
@MikeMadden nah.

@Timodc or Radford's winning it all this year.
RT @NicoleAuerbach: I see a Maryland fan holding a "Georgetown was my safety" school sign. I find that one hard to believe.
Hoyas really missing Paul White here. Reggie Cameron...just no.
@espn you had one job.
I know everyone's excited about this Toledo vs. Bowling Green Tuesday night football tilt and all @espn, but maybe consider this some more.

Shameful @nytimes printing the words of the "elderly gentleman" that a leading presidential candidate relies on for foreign policy advice.

@davecatanese @tripgabriel echoes of Palin's foreign policy briefings, except her guys waited until after the campaign to tell the world.

@HotlineJosh @baseballcrank just strange luck that Hassan's deeply held views on this happen to coincide with what will help get her elected
@baseballcrank ah indeed. Even weirder coincidence.
Weird coincidence that Maggie Hassan, who happens to be in a tough reelection fight, is only Dem governor calling for Syrian refugee ban.
