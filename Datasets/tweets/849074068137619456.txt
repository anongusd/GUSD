We can have a robust debate within the party, including bad manners, and still win. It's not betrayal - it happens in families, companies, and even school boards. It's a feature, not a bug, of having a broad coalition. It's a GOOD sign.

In 8 years, we face a real risk that liberals will be sighing for the good old days of the milder Trump the way many have rehabilitated Reagan or W. We have a Volkish movement on our hands, and it won't stop with the retirement of one mafia boss @POTUS.
And that's also what's so terrifying about the political process playing out in their movement. Trump has done away with the pretences and said the quiet parts out loud. The next manifestation will be worse because his cult will accept no less.
Everything has been turned upside down in the #Conservative movement - EXCEPT their hatred and fear of immigrants, women, non-whites, the poor, and intellectuals. Those are constants, and constitute the beating heart of anti-progressive institutions.
Lying in a heap like discarded costumes. But the purely performative convictions, the self-righteous posturing, has only gained in intensity over the years - perhaps as an effect of the ever-more-apparent emptiness behind it all.
In the space of 2 years, they've moved from Jade Helm hysteria to full throated support of a border occupation, and have done the same re Eminent Domain, Executive Orders, national debt... the list goes on. It's like a circus act with all their castoff "convictions"...
Seriously, though: if we were to take most of these counterrevolutionary media platforms and display their morphing positions on a giant wall, with the dates jumbled, we would see the utter chaos and nihilism that undergirds their movement.

@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews Same to you my friend! Have a blessed day.
@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews Every bank is alive today because our government inflated their holdings. And they are even bigger now and rely even more on government aid. I haven't noticed you applying these concepts to the rich yet - the ones who need it least.
@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews Like - raising the minimum wage? Because that would grow the wages.		Abolish poverty wages
@RiderTripp Ah, yes. But one of my platform positions was to cut congressional pay in half. I agree that Congress members shouldn't make so much while the rest of our country makes so little.
@RiderTripp Yes, like Congress, but with much, much bigger rewards.
@RiderTripp I'm a teacher.
@RiderTripp Sometimes, yes. But even if they didnt, they would see zero consequences. Their golden parachute is certain even when their decisions are wrong.
@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews https://t.co/tBEOGfsjR4
@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews You think making enough to pay for rent, food, and clothing is inflated? What is an inflated wage - and is this yet another rule that only applies to the poor?		Bc - again:
@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews They could be saving up for college, paying to support their family, or a lot of things. It's their business what they do with their money. But we should make sure they aren't robbed of a fair wage.
@RiderTripp It certainly want for the pay. I had less than 1/10000 chance of winning, and I lost a half-years work. I did it because I believe it is my duty to stand up for my neighbors who need healthcare, a decent wage for their work, and immigration reform.
@Twilliamson_ @RealMikeBannon @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews And while they are filling those roles, they should be rewarded for hard work.
@RealMikeBannon @Twilliamson_ @smartlyjoan @NewsJunkie60 @AOC @FoxNews I'll tell you who: a more productive citizen than a billionaire. A person who deserves to live in decency because they perform labor that is in very high demand in this country.
@RiderTripp All the consequences roll downhill to their workers, and they shouldn't be held to a higher standard than the billionaires while scrambling for mere survival.
@RiderTripp No, I'm not saying CEOs dont work. I'm saying some of them don't work much, some of them do bad work, but they live in a consequence-free world.
Better yet: abolish low paying jobs. For most of the labor market, low-paying jobs is not a pursuit, or one option among many, but the only option for survival. That's why poverty wages shouldn't exist: it is a tyrannical use of force. https://t.co/WAS8yhret4
Wow - really? Executive boards and CEOs put in the work to make the company run?		Ok, let's test this theory:	A. The board takes a month off work	B. The workers take a month off work		Which will do more damage to the company? Who is actually doing the work? https://t.co/NLAdPXdAQJ
I have heard the phrase that life's not fair, but so far everybody on this thread seems to be saying our unregulated top-heavy economy is fair insofar that it rewards hard work and punishes laziness. But you agree with me that it doesnt, so that's one step. https://t.co/9DJj2dM0lj
@RiderTripp Tell that to the Sears workers. Their executives just got millions, and the workers didnt even get wages for Christmas.		If mediocre work shouldn't be rewarded with wealth, you're gonna have to purge a whole lot of board rooms and hedge funds of mediocrity.
@Twilliamson_ @tvc15ma So the only lazy people you want to punish are the poor, and your solution for them is to hand more unearned money to the rich so they can scramble for the crumbs or hope for a Steve Jobs breakthrough. It's the system we have now, and it has created lazy rich ppl and working poor
@Twilliamson_ @tvc15ma So... again. You claim that the rich can get something for nothing by working people for poverty wages. In your system, the rich can inherit great wealth they didnt work for, go to private schools they dont pay for, and receive handouts from poor workers.
@Twilliamson_ @tvc15ma We have a huge GDP, and yet also: 40% of Americans can't handle a $400 emergency, 2 families own as much as the bottom 90%, and ppl are rationing insulin. We have to be more specific in our approach than just having a big economy. Best proposals: jobs guarantee and ⬆️min. wage.
@Twilliamson_ @tvc15ma So it's only ok to be lazy if you're rich? And if you skim off of the poor by paying poverty wages, that welfare check is ok, but if a poor person gets a welfare check that's wrong?
@tvc15ma @Twilliamson_ @tvc15ma are you suggesting we eliminate the system of inheritance?
Welcome to a balance of power. #investigations https://t.co/RkZ8BJvsBS
No, because in that case there would be mo such thing as a lazy, uneducated rich person, and there are plenty of those, and there would also be no hard working poor ppl, and there are millions. The cause is not laziness, but a system that doesnt reward work with good wages. https://t.co/AQWXj6YKKh

Reason #100 Evangelicalism is a political organization, not a coherent theology:		There is no bible verse that condemns or forbids #abortions. Not a single one. None of them say #AbortionIsMurder. They don't even forbid #AbortionUpToBirth.		Their #1 goal: elect Republicans. https://t.co/7BrE0Z3R8m
Was never about literalism or the Bible or belief in Christ. Their institution (esp the Southern Baptist Church I grew up in) was always about male, white power.  Threaten this power, as Held Evan's did here, and prepare to face a pit of vipers. #Christianity
Their reaction to my perfectly literalist test on this, their pet issue, is to accuse me of being a false teacher. Yes: pointing out that there is no Biblical rule against abortion makes me, in their eyes, the false teacher. But that's because their institution ..
But their goal, like any skilled propagandist, is to always remain on the attack (while of course claiming they are the REAL victims of culture war vitriol). To this day, whenever I challenge any of these literalists to find a Bible verse that forbids #abortions,
My #ProLife mentors are the 1st to cheer for war and mass incarceration. My "not ashamed of the gospel" youth leaders are the 1st to squirm and hedge when they hear the actual words of christ on worldly wealth &amp; treatment of the oppressed.

While the @GOP is praising the #TrumpShutdown as a "vacation" for fed workers while stealing their hard-earned paychecks, we should remind everybody that every time a worker receives poverty in exchange for a 40-hour workweek, our government allows a dire injustice. #livingwage

The @GOP establishment in the Senate, and of course Sunkist Caligula, see stealing paychecks from workers as just another day at the Oligarchy office - even if that means you vote against a budget that YOUR GOVERNMENT passed.
@TheDemocrats have voted in the House to open the government, largely because they believe you shouldn't steal a paycheck from a worker. This is not even their budget they voted on, but a budget passed by an entirely Republican government.

@JNLILLYIII @BrianKempGA Thank you for educating me and for having a civil, enlightening conversation! It's all too lacking these days.
@JNLILLYIII @BrianKempGA So we should certainly examine this pic and what it means. Now: we are talking about a Kemp photo with a white supremacist. Has Kemp, like Obama, condemned the guy he posed with and gave a thumbs-up to? We have to treat them both with the same standard.
@JNLILLYIII @BrianKempGA 2. Who was the staffer who asked for the photo to be suppressed, if that indeed happened? There should be accountability for hiding the truth from the American people.
@JNLILLYIII @BrianKempGA 1. What was Obama's calculation in taking this photo or attending this event without calling Farrakhan out for his antisemitic slurs? Without further evidence, we must conclude he compromised his commitment to fighting racism in order to avoid conflict with a powerful org.
@JNLILLYIII @BrianKempGA But this photo does show that no party or institution is lysol-clean when it comes to racism or anti-Semitism. Obama has long since condemned Farrakhan, and he should do so again now that this picture is out, but the pic raises serious questions...
@JNLILLYIII @BrianKempGA John you have educated me today. I hadn't seen that photo before. I did some research - here's an article that covers this photo in context (there isn't a good context): https://t.co/SO36lhbXW8

To be pro Life, and reduce the number of abortions, you have to commit to fight poverty. Josh will commit to this fight. #McCallCollinsDebate
Rep Collins claims to protect life from birth to death but has voted against funding and expanding healthcare to save those lives. #McCallCollinsDebate
“We can build a better future of compassion and cooperation” Josh McCall #McCallCollinsDebate
Rep Collins opens with taxes, economy, and military. These are issues wefeel need a strong progressive approach and also are concerned about. #McCallCollinsDebate
Thank you to Spencer Carr for moderating this evening! #McCallCollinsDebate

These sexual assaults and rapes are a warning sign, a prophetic voice, the blood of lost childhoods crying out for justice. If we do not do all in our power to grant them justice and agency, we have set ourselves on a dangerous path, with terrifying momentum.
Dehumanizes people of color and the poor, a militarized culture w/ a cult of violence, and we expect that all if this will coexist with liberal values of a free and open society, that the normal will persist along with good manners, like a family with terrible problems in denial
But this is always a danger in a Liberal society: these horrifying institutions exist sub limine, out of the public eye, far away from news cameras. We entertain Guantanamos, Chicago torture units, mafia rings in the Baltimore police, a law enforcement system that...
Sexual predation and masochists are a feature, not a bug, of the immigration gulag we've fashioned in this country - a  gulag which predated Trump, but which  he and his race baiting lickspittles have expanded out of cruelty, recklessness, and incompetence.
For the same reason you will find many Trump-types at cocaine parties with young models, at pageants with underage girls, and for the same reason you will find a dozen interchangeable Cohens and Manaforts around every Trump and Kushner.
Take a cross section of the corrupt, secretive, abusive, tyrannical organizations involved in our #immigration system, and of course you will find sexual predators at a much higher rate there than anywhere else in society.
Of course child abuse happens across the ideological spectrum, but imagine the people who willingly work as agents of kidnapping kids without legal status, whom the Trump administration and the right wing have characterized as sub-human, as infestations, as pests...
This is a feature of fascism - and authoritarianism in its communistic form as well - to smear the opposition with the crimes that thrive in their own social sphere.
Ever noticed how all the sickest conspiracies on right wing sites always feature pedophilia?		Trump authored a program of kidnapping that puts kids in contact with sick people.
