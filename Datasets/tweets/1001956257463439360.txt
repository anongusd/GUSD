It's difficult to decide if I should run for office because well I think I'm capable there are far more qualified people who could run. I have 2 1/2 years-ish until I can be elected to anything so I guess we'll see but I don't know. I may want to work "behind the scenes"

does anyone else agree with me on all of this? probably not. but at least I'm getting all of this out right now instead of continuing to feel fake and fraudulent for having varied political views
also I either want a Klobuchar/Castro ticket or a Harris/Pete (I'm sorry but I can't spell his last name lmaoo) I was very Klobuchar but Harris is getting to me big time!! Wouldn't be mad at a Warren/Gillum ticket but he should primary Al Lawson tbh
I think we should make all Hospitals and Prisons not for profit and make Higher Public Education more affordable//spend more on all public education
my foreign policy views are very left// look at Ilhan Omar's and they're pretty much mine and my economic policy views are unique, I believe in a circular economy instead of a linear one and I do think the rich need to be taxed big time.
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm more a Chris Hayes/Rachel Maddow Democrat and not a TYT/Jimmy Dore "Democrat" but I know my views make no sense to anyone but me but I don't think that supporting Democrats across the spectrum makes me a fraud.
I also feel like this rant makes no sense to anyone but me but I'm just going to keep typing. I think that Schumer needs to be primaried, from the left most likely but not from AOC. But he needs to go. So does Cuomo, but he needs to be replaced with someone who isn't corrupt af.
I like Gallego for Senate but I get that Stanton has a better shot. I also would never support Woods because tbh his views haven't changed he just changed his party. I feel like that in-between between NDC and CPC.
BUT I still support and love AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Pramila Jayapal. I still think Democrats like Ed Case and Dan Lipinski deserve to be primaried. I still support M4A or something similar and the GND. I also like most of the new Blue Dogs (not Case tho)
I always feel fake when I realize how my political views are changing and it's ok. I'm not a fraud because of it, I'm allowed to change and it's taken me awhile to accept that. I'm a lot more along the lines of Katie Hill, Abby Finkenauer, Sharice Davids and Chris Pappas
It's ok for people's views to change. Especially when they can't even vote yet and are still finding themselves as a person let alone politically. 6 months ago I was a Bernie Bro Socialist. 3 years ago I was a Marco Rubio Republican. Developing doesn't make a person a fraud.

@danikamcmurray_ @RepKendraHorn @RepSpanberger @JoeCunninghamSC @RepTorresSmall If people don't start understanding this the party is fucked
My point is some of you are way more outraged at @RepKendraHorn for joining the blue dogs when she flipped a conservative Oklahoma seat instead of Ed Case who won with a plurality in a primary in a safe blue open seat.
We can have these purity tests in districts that are very blue (see Lipiniski and Cueller) but in districts where it's a fight for "conservative" (which the new blue dogs really aren't) dems to get elected, someone like AOC or Ilhan won't win. Sorry but they're facts
Ed Case represents an extremely liberal district from one of, if not the most liberal states in the country. He's who you should be targeting. Everyone else flipped districts which is impressive af, especially Kendra and Joe. Ed? He decided he'd go back after being a lobbyist
y'all attack people like @RepKendraHorn @RepSpanberger @JoeCunninghamSC @RepTorresSmall etc. for joining blue dogs when they're from super conservative districts and all actually care about issues and are more progressive than you think they are but not Ed Case??

keep in mind these are my 2 am ramblings but also if @RepBarragan isn't either a Senator or in house leadership by 2026 I may loose it because she's one of my favorite reps from Cali ever!!
When Dianne retires I really want to see a SoCal senator for once so the top picks here would be @RepBarragan , @JimmyGomezCA , and @ToddGloria (if you see this good luck on the mayors race!!!) two Mayors would be fucking badass together in the Senate tho. What a team!!!
When Kamala resigns to focus on the transition, either @LondonBreed or @Scott_Wiener should be appointed? should run in the special? I'm not positive how Cali works when it comes to that.
Considering I kinda expect Kamala to win the nominee and presidency in 2020 and that Diane is going to retire I want to present my *picks* for new California Senators (take it with a grain of salt, like a thicc grain, bc I'm not from Cali)

@OfficialClayyy No, I think democrats who are pro-intervention do care about the people, but republicans, especially trump republicans dont give a flying fuck about people
@OfficialClayyy Because I'm vehemently anti-war and anti-intervention?? I held those views before I even got into politics. Why do we need to be the biggest and baddest? America's ego needs to be checked
@OfficialClayyy To act like any of these gop politicians actually care about people is hilarious, they only care about oil
@OfficialClayyy The US has no business everywhere else because it only cares about oil. I stand by that through and through. Helping people abroad would be increasing Peace Corps efforts and increasing refugee and asylum seeker status

@AndrewSolender @OfficialClayyy @RepPeteKing ok and who's angie craig again?? if a candidate was competitive in a seat that isn't normally competitive they should run again because now they have name recognition
@QuancyClayborne to have the bullshit of a small minority of us imposed on the teenagers as a whole is an overused trope that i was hoping would stop on the left/ with liberals after @AMarch4OurLives @sunrisemvmt and @ThisIsZeroHour but i guess not🤷‍♂️
@QuancyClayborne don't impose the acts of a handful of teenagers on the rest of us?? sis, the majority of us hate trump, find this appalling, and are too busy in the first place to do dumb shit like this. we have hours of homework, tests to study for, sports  and other extracurriculars
@NFL_Kneelers @QuancyClayborne honey please. all of us roll our eyes at participation trophies and honestly? they make us feel more stupid than we really are. maybe if you got off your high horse for once instead of just deciding how everyone else feels you'd understand that.

in short i don't want to here the bullshit you're going to decide to spew about all teenagers being disgusting and horrible. thanks for coming to my ted talk!
we're the only reason y'all actually started to really care about gun control and climate change, especially gun control. neither of those would have been the number one reason for some people to vote if it wasn't for gen z.
i'm living for everyone starting to equate all teenagers to the dumbass white supremacist teenagers in the video that everyone knows i'm referring too?? like ok but literally the majority of our generation finds the video as well as the president disgusting??

so in conclusion #klobuchar2020 #harris2020 #warren2020 #gillibrand2020 #castro2020
Klobuchar won 42 counties in Minnesota in 2018  that Trump won in 2016. MN can honestly be compared to a scaled down version of the country at large political. super progressive urban areas, increasingly moderate/dem leaning suburbs, and increasingly conservative rural areas
like the only man i'm tolerating is Castro and i have a feeling he'll be vp  but like he's the only man i could see myself wholeheartedly supporting so like just stop with "only white men will win 2020" like no honey that's incorrect.
y'all really want a man to be president?? in 2019? with the 4 amazing women who are presumed to run?? Warren as the lefty progressive, Harris as the establishment progressive, Gillibrand as the in-between, and Klobuchar as the "moderate" candidate??

@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Yeah and I think they're mostly shit for it, especially a non union hotel (to my knowledge non union) and that he went back to congress
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Sis was a bit confused, I read this wrong😂😂😂 https://t.co/hyBNP1SmHi
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco I don't like Case as a person so unless he somehow gets M4A or the GND passed he can go fuck himself. It's not even how he votes to me. I mean yeah, I think he's too conservative for 2019 Hawaii, but also I think he's a dumb bitch for being a lobbyist
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Is TX16 really only D+5? The change from Beto-Veronica still shows that change in many safe Dem districts across the country tho
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco That's the thing though. You're 100%  right. But considering Hawaii's Senators, both HI1 and HI2 are way more progressive than their reps are
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Than when Beto won that primary. People just don't want to seriously challenge incumbents
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco New Dems aren't bad, but the ones who come from super blue districts that are blue because there's a progressive voter base don't represent their districts. I mean look at the different between Beto and Escobar. Beto's great, but Escobar represents how thag district is bluer
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco But if you're district is super lefty and you're New Dem?? Sis what is you doin. Especially the districts that are clearly not FL-7/NJ-5(Murphy/Gottheimer?? (God I can't spell or remember their districts lmao)and are held by Blue Dogs. Oh sis. Let the Blue dogs take over in NM2
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Case is better than maybe a handful of Blue dogs/New dems who don't represent the blueness of their districts. That's not to say being New dem isn't representing ones very blue district if that district happens to be a district like Sewell's, who I think represents it very well
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco I get what you're saying, but she wouldn't be nearly as bad as Tulsi. She's still better than Case
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Was. She's on par with someone like Sharice Davids at this point.
@OfficialClayyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Nope, no way in hell. He needs to just stop running and be a full time lobbyist like he's done before with Outrigger Enterprises Group. I don't care if he runs as a socialist, he himself is who I'm against
@TheStagmania Yeah... Buffalo doesn't have like anything substantial
@TheStagmania I mean we kind of had it with Nate McMurray but that was mostly backlash to Collins and the fact that Nate is an amazing candidate for that district
@TheStagmania But I love what Dana and her team were able to accomplish and I hope she runs again in 2020!
@TheStagmania But compared to downstate, upstate is no where near as "grassrooty" especially wny, we don't have shit over here in terms of grassroot. NY24 is such a weird district like wtf tho. Like it goes what, +3 for Clinton but it still super conservative for congress?? Like wtff
Heyy @KanielaIng @bethfukumoto @votekimcoco Who's running against Ed Case in 2020!?
Ok but who's running against Tulsi in 2020 is it gonna be @SherryForHawaii or @LeanOnAndLead ??? Both of you are amazing but we really need one person to just go after her! It needs to be one of you two for sure!
@TheStagmania Downstate, yeah. Upstate? Not as much tbh
@TheStagmania Also upstate will be fucking pissed if NY has 2 downstate senators sooo who are we going to pick?
@TheStagmania Would we tho?? Because Cuomo fucks everything up. I can't believe Gillibrand was his pick! Minnesota could be Peggy Flanagan or Ilhan Omar and Cali could be Nanette Baragan or Jimmy Gomez😉 (My dream ticket rn is Klobuchar/Harris)
@TheStagmania I'm Klobuchar all the way, but my top VP picks are Harris, Castro, and Gillibrand in that order (I don't want to lose my one good Senator lmao)
Ugh @monicaisliberal is making me start to fall for Castro. I'm already on Klobuchar's team tho!! Castro is in my second tier (my first tier is all Klobuchar) along with Harris, Gillibrand, and Booker.

While I do plan on moving out of the area for college, I'm still here until 2021 so it's time to figure out what's going on around here in the meantime
The Buffalo Common Council doesn't have a single woman currently and to my knowledge Erie County has never elected an open queer person to office. Both of these will hopefully change in November.
2019 is going to be a year where I learn about the local politics of Buffalo and Erie County by immersing myself into them. Hopefully we see some real change in WNY even before the 2020 election cycle. We've seen some the last two years, but not as much as is needed.
The only people I know of right now who could primary Assemblyman Schimminger and win are @jillyomalley and @TomakaEmma. Both would be amazing assemblywomen and I'd love to work on either of their campaigns. They'd represent the 140th fabulously!

@OfficialClayyy @joncprevo She just sounds moderate lately since she'll probably be beat. Moderate in todays Trump Republican party is used generously since not too many are left
@joncprevo I want to see more moderate Republican woman Senators is safe red states tbh. Martha Roby, Nikki Haley (assuming SC stays red), Mia Love, and keep Murkowski. Not Too on board for keeping Collins, Ernst, or McSally since all of those could flip.
Basically I just want to know what freshman Dem Senators we may see in already Dem held seats. I have ideas but I want to discuss
Warner may retire bc I swear I've heard that some of his colleagues are trying to push him to retire so someone more progressive can run to replace him as VA becomes more blue. Anyways I'm just theorizing and want to hear input about where I may be wrong and if I missed anyone
Do we think any Democratic Senators are going to retire in 2020?? I think the possibilities are limited to Durbin, Markey, and Warner. Possibly Merkley if he runs for Pres. Durbin and Markey because they've been in congress for awhile.
@joncprevo I think Pressley specifically if Markey decides to retire in 2020 because Kennedy will presumably go for the seat

@OfficialClayyy I don't want Trump term #2 but if it means better policy bc of a solid majority in the house and senate come 2024 with a guaranteed new President.
@OfficialClayyy Yes! Like honestly it would even set Dems up for the 2024 Senate elections too to flip Texas and regain Florida. Also some possible swings could/should retire by then so there could be clean slate elections in Maine,Michigan,Vermont  etc.
I'm going to get a bunch of hate for this. I'm just saying though, worse comes to worse in the 2020 presidential race, it's not the end of the world bc hopefully we'll have huge checks on the president
Unpopular take:: The presidency isn't the most important office up for grabs in 2020. The Senate is. Not to mention a 2022 Trump Midterm would ensure Dems start off on the right foot with the new house map and we could flip the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Senate seats.
@haydenrobinsonn If Bullock doesn't run for Senate in 2020 that would he such a waste considering he's term limited for Governor
Tester has pretter much said "no" to a 2020 run to my knowledge but another Senator with similar personal appeal is Sen. Amy Klobuchar 😉😉 https://t.co/CVEU3kPhjH

Both aren't overtly ProTrump, especially within the Republican party and I'd like to see some Republicans with common sense. They'd be a welcome addition to Lisa Murkowski style of Republicanism
Plus I'm all for getting the number of women in the Senate from 25% to 51%. If there's a state that's super conservative I'd rather see a woman in office (except HydeSmith). I'd also like to see Mia Love run for Utah Senate at some point.
Martha Roby is a Republican I wouldn't hate seeing in the senate since it's pretty certain Doug Jones will loose. I'd love to see him not but at least Martha could be someone Dems could work with on some issues in the Senate.

Bernie is much better suited for repping Vermont in the Senate and Beto should run for Texas senate again. Brown would be a good VP but idk if Dems can afford to lose his seat in Ohio.
If y'all don't stop acting like the only people who can beat Trump in 2020 are white men I may lose it. Stfu about Biden, Bernie, Beto, and Bloomberg. Biden should enjoy his retirement, nothing against him but come on, really? Bloomberg can fuck right off.

@McF_Nbctoday @haydenrobinsonn Yes! And I'm 100% here for that, since they're from more conservative districts. But people like Dan Lipinski and Brian Higgins? Sis no way

@MelanieHammer @VettingBernie @dmh07666 @BresPolitico @CahnEmily @SenSchumer @Grace4NY He's also a 20 year incumbent. He should've gotten at least 70% of thw vote easily. I'm sure he's ok, especially compared to our current senator, but I'd still much rather hace Grace or Kathy
@VettingBernie @onmalecon @dmh07666 @BresPolitico @CahnEmily @SenSchumer @Grace4NY 😂😂you're funny. Schumer? With a backbone?? 😂 i should bite my tongue since i may apply to be a page in 2020 and it may have to be him instead of Sen. Gillibrand. We'll see but I should keep quiet about him till after😂😂

@onmalecon @VettingBernie @dmh07666 @BresPolitico @CahnEmily @SenSchumer @Grace4NY Im just saying I don't want him to be my Senator. I'd much rather have Grace Meng or Kathy Hochul. My congressman needs to be primaried too
@VettingBernie @dmh07666 @BresPolitico @CahnEmily @SenSchumer @Grace4NY I don't want Bernie to run either. I'm sick of mediocre men getting to do whatever they want when women have to do 5x as much to prove themselves.

@haydenrobinsonn @ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 I messaged you, we should discuss this bc I'm 99% sure we're basically on the same page
@haydenrobinsonn @ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 Nationally we shouldn't, but WV Dems also shouldn't give up
@haydenrobinsonn @ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 I wholeheartedly agree, but I also feel bad throwing WV to the side. But we should talk more about the senate races
@haydenrobinsonn @ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 It's worth a shot tbh, like obviously the national stuff should focus on Colorado, Maine, Iowa, Arizona, Texas apparently etc. But we shouldn't leave WV out to dry
@haydenrobinsonn @ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 Also who else do you propose run? Like not in a snarky way, like seriously. I think there's a SoS? Also Ojeda but he's running for President 🙄
@ChrisFistonich @haydenrobinsonn @paulajean2020 I'm hoping mainly independents/3rd parties. I don't know how many there are in WV. Same with non-voters. The Republicans would just make things easier. Not to mention, I doubt she had the name recognition Manchin had in the primary, but running against a repub could be different
@ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 How many independents are there in WV/ Republican voters she could win over? That's what I'd like to see
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY And what point is that?
@ChrisFistonich @paulajean2020 Well we won't find out unless someone tries, right?
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY Oh honey, if your dumbass "president" wasn't elected, there wouldn't be all of these amazing people heading to congress
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY You're funny, you think I'm jealous of Republicans? Amazing!!
Trump supporters are really so brainwashed it's amazing. Like he could tell them anything and they'd just fucking believe it. I hope researchers are study the psychology behind all of this.
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY Hun you are so blind to the truth
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY What do you mean everything they do. House matters are house matters. If you're talking about bills, yeah you're right, but things like Speaker? No that's all house stuff,

@brianschatz Ok but what about Senate Majority leader after we talk back the senate in 2020, either you or Tammy!! I'd be happy with Mazie too!
@RCTjunkie @harrypujols @brianschatz I think you read Bernie, they said Brian, and god almighty do i fucking agree!
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY I hope by "they" you mean all politicians, because Republicans are even worse when it comes to that. Ocasio-Cortez is supporting Pelosi bc she's the most progressive candidate for Speaker there is right now, and the Progressive Caucus got power from it.
@ajinbk @MaxRose4NY Sis are you ok?? He ran as a democrat, and to my knowledge will still vote against Pelosi? You really should get your head out of your ass
@matthewjweiler @NicholsUprising @mehdirhasan That's what the constitution is for I'm assuming. But I mean, I would totally if I was an atheist lmaoo
@IlhanMN @Ocasio2018 Ok but where in upstate?! I'd 10/10 support that business!
We also need to add congressional districts following the 2020 census. We have so many more people compared the 1920s when the current number was set. I believe that there is a NY Times article on this issue.
#Statehood needs to be granted to both Puerto Rico and DC within the next year, if the citizens there want it. Discussions should be had with other US Territories and all US citizens should be able to vote in the Presidential election regardless of where they live.

@HURRICANEPAUL @sunrisemvmt The "Green New Deal" would create jobs that create renewable energy. So yeah, people would produce something in the process. Regardless I plan on going into politics as a staffer so your point about me specifically is irrelevant hun.
@HURRICANEPAUL @sunrisemvmt I'm not even a part of this, although I do agree with them. How about the jobs don't necessarily exist in their area so you should shut the fuck up if you don't know their circumstances? Like why are you so angry about young people fighting for the environment?

I may disagree with Pelosi on some issues, but honestly this right here has won my support back for the house race. Straight facts. I was a little skeptical to begin with because of who is actively against her, but I've decided to support her for Speaker https://t.co/GwJKfRirpf
