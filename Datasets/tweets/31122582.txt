"Finally, I remind Members that we still need to remain mindful of those areas where there are ongoing interests of the #DOJ.  		Those scoping limitations have not been changed." - Chairman @RepCummings
"So in fairness to the Ranking Member and all Committee Members, we will not restrict questions relating to the witness‚Äô testimony or related questions he is willing to answer. " -Chairman @RepCummings
"However, in Mr. Cohen‚Äôs written testimony, he has made statements relating to #Russia, and these are topics that we understand do not raise concern from the #DOJ." - Chairman @RepCummings
"At the request of the House Intelligence Committee, I had intended‚Äîover the objections of the Ranking Member‚Äîto limit the scope of today‚Äôs hearing to avoid questions about Russia." -Chairman @RepCummings
"The days of this Committee protecting the President at all costs are OVER.  		Before I close, I want to comment about the scope of today‚Äôs hearing. " -Chairman @RepCummings
"The American people voted for accountability in November, and they have a right to hear Mr. Cohen in public so they can make their own judgments.  	Mr. Cohen‚Äôs testimony is the beginning of the process‚Äînot the end." -Chairman @RepCummings
"We need to assess and investigate this new evidence as we uphold our constitutional oversight responsibilities.  		And we will continue after today to gather more documents and testimony in our search for the truth." - Chairman @RepCummings
"Mr. Cohen‚Äôs testimony raises grave questions about the legality of the Donald Trump‚Äôs conduct and the truthfulness of his statements while he was President."- Chairman @RepCummings
"I agree with Ranking Member Jordan that this is an important factor we all need to weigh. But where I disagree fundamentally with the Ranking Member involves his efforts to prevent the American people from hearing from Mr. Cohen." - Chairman @RepCummings
"We will all have to make our own evaluation of the evidence and Mr. Cohen‚Äôs credibility.  		As he admits, he has repeatedly lied in the past." - Chairman @RepCummings
According to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump replied, ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt that be great.‚Äù		The testimony that Michael Cohen will provide today is deeply disturbing. - Chairman @RepCummings
"We will also hear Cohen‚Äôs account of a meeting in 2016 in #Trump‚Äôs office during which Stone said, over a speakerphone, that he had just spoken with Julian Assange, who said there would be a, quote ‚Äúmassive dump of emails that would damage Clinton‚Äôs campaign." -@RepCummings
This claim fell apart in August when federal prosecutors concluded, quote:  ‚ÄúIn truth and in fact, there was no such retainer agreement.‚Äù- Chairman @RepCummings
"A month after that, the President admitted making payments to Mr. Cohen, but claimed they were part of ‚Äúa monthly retainer‚Äù for legal services."- Chairman @RepCummings
"The #President answered, quote:  ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  - Chairman @RepCummings
"Six months later, in April of 2018, the President denied knowing anything about it.  	In April 2018, President Trump was flying on Air Force One when a reporter asked him, quote:  ‚ÄúDid you know about the $130,000 payment to #StormyDaniels?‚Äù  - Chairman @RepCummings
"This new evidence raises a host of troubling legal and ethical concerns about the #President‚Äôs actions in the White House and before.		This check is dated August 1, 2017. " - Chairman @RepCummings
"For example, Mr. Cohen has provided a copy of a check sent while the President was in office‚Äîwith Donald Trump‚Äôs signature on it‚Äîto reimburse Mr. Cohen for the hush-money payment to #StormyDaniels." -Chairman @RepCummings
"We received a copy of Cohen‚Äôs written statement late last night.	It includes not only eyewitness accounts of meetings with #DonaldTrump as President inside the Oval Office, but it also includes documents and evidence for some of Mr. Cohen‚Äôs statements." -Chairman @RepCummings
"The President has made many statements of his own, and now the American people have a right to hear the other side.  	They can watch Mr. Cohen‚Äôs testimony and make their own judgment. "	-Chairman @RepCummings
"Here is how I view our role.  		Every one of us in this room has a duty to serve as an independent check on the Executive Branch.  		We are searching for the TRUTH."  Chairman @RepCummings
"And he admitted to lying about his actions to protect the President.	Some will certainly ask, if Mr. Cohen was lying then, why should we believe him now?  That is a legitimate question." - Chairman @RepCummings
"Mr. Cohen admitted to violating campaign finance laws and other laws. 		He admitted to committing these felonies quote, ‚Äúin coordination with, and at the direction of‚Äù #PresidentTrump. " - Chairman @RepCummings
"On August 21, Mr. Cohen appeared in federal court and admitted to arranging secret payoffs of hundreds of thousands of dollars on the eve of the election to silence women alleging affairs with #DonaldTrump. " - Chairman @RepCummings

"They want greater transparency and accountability in our government. #HR1 makes good on that promise. It is a broad and brave step towards restoring a government that works "For the People." -Chairman @RepCummings
"The American people gave this Congress and this Committee a mandate to restore our democracy and CLEAN UP our government."
"They warned that every decision he made could be questioned, and the American people would rightly wonder whether he was serving the nation's interests or his own financial interests. Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened over the past two years."
"Both Democratic and Republican ethics experts warned #PresidentTrump to do this years ago, but he refused."
"Title VIII also would make clear that Congress expects the President to divest his business holdings-just as every single President since Jimmy Carter has done- and place them in an independent and truly blind trust."
"Title VIII also would prohibit senior federal employees from working on matters that affect the financial interests of their former employers or prospective employers. They could obtain waivers for this requirement, but those waivers would have to be made public."
"Title VIII also includes another bill I introduced, the Transition Team Ethics Improvement Act, with @SenatorCarper and @SenWarren . This legislation would require transition teams to have ethics plans in place and make those plans publicly available."
"This would have prevented Gary Cohn from receiving more than $100 million in accelerated payments from Goldman Sachs while leading the Trump Administration's efforts to slash corporate taxes."
"For example, Title VIII includes a bill that I introduced called the Executive Branch Conflict of Interest Act. It would ban senior officials from accepting "golden parachute" payments from private sector employers in exchange for their government service."
"Today, our hearing will focus on the part of H.R. 1 that is in our jurisdiction-Title VIII-which puts in place strong new reforms for the #ExecutiveBranch."
"It is by American citizens who voted for reform in last November's elections and sent a clear message that they want to exercise their constitutional right to vote without interference."
"Senate Majority Leader #MitchMcConnell has described #HR1 as a "power grab" by Democrats. He is right about one thing-it is a power grab. But it is not by Democrats. "
"It would provide for expanded early voting and absentee voting and give additional funding to states to maintain enough polling sites so everyone can easily go cast their ballot."
#HR1 would address many of these problems. The bill would institute procedures to automatically register eligible voters and put in place protections to keep them on the correct voter rolls."
3. Kansas moved to the outskirts of town the one and only polling place for 27,000 residents of Dodge City, most of whom are minorities.
2. Georgia kept eligible individuals off the rolls and caused widespread problems with wait times and absentee ballots, particularly in areas with significant minority populations.
For example:	1. North Carolina drew legislative districts that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found target African-Americans "with almost surgical precision.
"Especially troubling, in some cases, they have engaged in illegal efforts to suppress the vote that target minority communities."
"Unfortunately, some people disagree, including most Republicans. They think we should make it harder to vote. They think we should make it more difficult by cutting back on early voting, eliminating polling places, and taking other steps to reduce the number of people who vote."
"We should be encouraging more people to cast their votes- not fewer. We should be promoting early voting, absentee voting, voting by mail, and other ways to help citizens cast their votes-  not rolling back these programs!"
"I believe that we should be doing everything in our power to make it easier for eligible American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote- NOT harder.We should be making it MORE convenient-not less."
"This sweeping legislation will 	- clean up corruption in government	- fight secret money in politics	- make it easier for American citizens across this country to vote!"
"We are holding a hearing on #HR1, the #ForthePeople Act was introduced by  @RepSarbanes , a senior Member of our Comm. We thank him for his vision and tenacity. He has compiled one of the boldest reform packages to be considered in the history of this body." - @RepCummings

"Our constituents are DEMANDING it.  		And I am grateful that we are finally starting down that road with today‚Äôs hearing." -@RepCummings
"But the bottom line is that the ongoing escalation of prices by drug companies is simply unsustainable.  		This is a matter of life and death, and we have a duty to act NOW. "
"We all recognize that research and development efforts on groundbreaking medications have made immeasurable contributions to the health of Americans, including new treatments and cures for diseases that have affected people for centuries."
"Let me be clear:  there are powerful interests here that do not want us to interfere with their massive profits. 		But there is a strong bipartisan consensus that we must do something to rein in out-of-control price increases."
"The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable in the world‚Äîand one of the most POWERFUL.		Fourteen drug companies each made more than $1 billion in profits just in the third quarter of 2018.  And they have the best lobbyists money can buy. "
"We have seen time after time that #drugcompanies make money hand over fist by raising the prices of their drugs‚Äîoften without justification, and sometimes overnight‚Äîwhile patients are left holding the bill."
"I have been waiting a very long time to hold this hearing.  		For the past decade, I have been trying to investigate the actions of #drugcompanies for all sorts of drugs‚Äîold and new, generic and brand-name."
"We also value the expert testimony of Dr. Jerry Anderson, Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, and Dr. Avik Roy."
"I also want to thank our other witnesses for being here today.  		We are grateful to have Dr. Catherine Georges of @AARP to speak on behalf of America‚Äôs #seniors. "
"So, when you testify here today, you are representing thousands and thousands of your fellow Americans who are suffering from the same worsening problem. "
Researchers at Yale University recently found that one in four patients with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes and I quote, 		‚Äúhave reported using less insulin than prescribed.‚Äù
"Ms. Worsham, it‚Äôs not easy to testify before Congress, and you are very courageous.  		I want to thank you for being here to share your family‚Äôs story with us.  		You are not alone. "
"The first witness to testify before the Oversight Committee is Antroinette Worsham.  		Ms. Worsham is a working mother whose daughter died tragically when she could not afford to pay for the insulin she needed to treat her diabetes and instead began to ration her medicine."
"Two weeks ago, the Committee launched an investigation into #prescriptiondrugprices to determine why #drugcompanies are increasing prices so dramatically, how #drugcompanies are using the proceeds, and what steps can be taken to reduce #prescriptiondrugprices."
"But today, for our first hearing, I wanted to focus on one of the biggest problems facing American families across the country‚Äîthe actions of #drugcompanies that have been AGGRESSIVELY increasing prices on existing drugs and setting higher launch prices for new drugs!"
"And the latest of #PresidentTrump‚Äôs longtime advisers has been INDICTED on criminal charges."
"Until last Friday, the federal government was in the middle of the LONGEST #shutdown in U.S. history.  		Hundreds of #immigrantchildren‚Äîand possibly many more‚Äîare still SEPARATED from their families."
"Before we begin, I acknowledge that there is A LOT going on right now‚Äîhere on Capitol Hill and across the country."
"Today, we will examine the actions of #drugcompanies in raising #prescriptiondrugprices in the United States, as well as the effects of these actions on federal and state budgets and on American families."
"I know we are taking on a lot today, but I truly believe this is one of the most important issues facing our constituents, and it is one that demands immediate attention!"

‚ÄùWe need real and immediate action to lower drug prices in this country.‚Äù
‚ÄùThey should not have to decide between paying their bills or paying for their prescriptions.  	 	We‚Äôre a better country than that.‚Äù
‚ÄùNo more talk.	 	No more tweets.	 	The American people want action!‚Äù
‚ÄùThese bills are important because it‚Äôs time to provide much-needed relief to the American people.‚Äù

‚ÄùSo today, I‚Äôm here to reintroduce the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Act, co-led by my friends Representatives Welch and Doggett, to allow Medicare to negotiate prices directly with drug companies.‚Äù
‚ÄùAnother study found that most widely-used brand name drugs have more than doubled in price since 2006.‚Äù
‚ÄùA poll found that one in five Americans reported not filling a prescription due to high costs.‚Äù
‚ÄùAnd unfortunately, there hasn‚Äôt been any progress since then, and it‚Äôs clear the problem is getting worse.‚Äù
‚ÄùWe asked for his endorsement. 	 	We asked for his support.	 	He NEVER responded.‚Äù

‚ÄùI, along with Rep. Welch, even met with President Trump.		We went to the White House‚Äîearly in the President‚Äôs first year. ‚Äù
I‚Äôve held hearings, written letters, and pleaded with my Republican colleagues to address this issue.‚Äù
‚ÄùI have been investigating the skyrocketing prices of drugs since 2011‚Äîfor both generic and brand name drugs.‚Äù

RT @cspan: House @gopoversight @oversightdems hearing on the Clinton Foundation (@ClintonFdn) ‚Äì LIVE on C-SPAN https://t.co/5jnpAD7b8h http‚Ä¶
‚ÄúOf course, it is the prerogative of the Chairman to call hearings, and he has chosen to call this one.  Unfortunately, I think to most people, it looks like a last gasp of partisanship.‚Äù @GerryConnolly
‚ÄúDespite our requests on the Democratic side, no subpoenas were issued, and no hearings were held.‚Äù
‚ÄúChairman Meadows and Ranking Member Cummings sent a letter to the #TrumpAdmin seeking documents about their inhumane policy of separating immigrant children at the #border. We did not get a SINGLE document.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe truth is that there are very serious issues that we should be investigating instead of this!‚Äù
‚ÄúThey had eight committees, including this one and a select committee, squander millions of dollars.  Yet, now that Democrats are about to gain control, Mr. McCarthy says we should not investigate #PresidentTrump.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course, there is some irony here.  The Republican Majority Leader, #KevinMcCarthy, famously justified the massive investigations of #HillaryClinton after #Benghazi by touting his party‚Äôs efforts to bring down her poll numbers.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere have been serious allegations against both, but Republicans on our Committee have refused to investigate.‚Äù
‚ÄúBefore this hearing, I sent a letter to the Chairman asking him, if he planned on inviting the #Clinton Foundation, to also invite the #Trump Foundation and the foundation operated by Acting AG #Whitaker.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe #Republicans have been making unsubstantiated claims against the #Clinton Foundation for years.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Chairman invited the #DOJ  and the #IRS to be here today, but they both refused to come. The #Trump DOJ and the Trump IRS refused to send someone to this hearing.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow about the FBI? Apparently, the #FBI interviewed the #Clinton Foundation CFO last year, but like the #IRS, took no further action.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo, what did the #IRS and #FBI do with this complaint? The IRS rejected it. The IRS sent them a denial letter. They say they have appealed, but they have refused to give us a copy of their original complaint or more recent appeal.‚Äù
‚ÄúNext, they will report on a secret interview they conducted with the Chief Financial Officer of the #Clinton Foundation, Andy Kessel, during a breakfast in 2016.  They claim Mr. Kessel made statements criticizing President Bill Clinton and the #Clinton Foundation‚Äù
‚ÄúThe #Clinton Foundation commissioned these reports internally, voluntarily, and then made substantial improvements to address their findings. This is neither a scandal nor new.‚Äù
‚ÄúTheir first claim is that internal reports issued a decade ago‚Äîa decade ago‚Äîsuggest that there were management challenges at the #Clinton Foundation.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey have already conceded that they are not whistle blowers. Instead, they are would-be plaintiffs in a lawsuit looking to make money.‚Äù

I look forward to the Committee conducting a systematic and thorough investigation of this issue, and I also anticipate developing long overdue legislation to strengthen standards for these processes and to expand transparency as much as possible while protecting privacy.
The Committee must conduct thorough oversight over how agencies handle allegations of harassment and bullying. The Committee also must ensure that the Forest Service will hold perpetrators fully accountable.
I thank Ms. Reed for her courage in coming forward and for her willingness to testify.  You are opening the door for more women to come forward and say we aren't taking it anymore.
Documents provided in response to the Committee‚Äôs requests contain extensive and inappropriate redactions.  They contradict the agency‚Äôs claim it is committed to transparency.
The #ForestService has made improvements in the processes it uses to receive and investigate allegations of harassment and bullying.  But it is clear that, two years later, many employees still believe the agency tolerates harassment, bullying, and retaliation.
@RepCummings Given the life-threatening risks that #ForestService employees regularly face in their careers, it is critical that we ensure that the #ForestService is a place where no one feels afraid to come to work because of what a co-worker might do to them.

ICYMI: Rep. Hurd, Gowdy other Republicans blocked testimony from ODNI Director Coats days after promising vigorous public oversight 	https://t.co/g8ZcYk6KNv
@RepCummings : We don‚Äôt need talk.  We need action.  This should be a bipartisan issue, and we have less than four months to help our states before the next election.
@RepCummings : Vote in favor of additional funding for states that desperately need it.
@RepCummings : Support our request to subpoena the Trump Administration for documents it is withholding about Russian attacks. Support our request for the Director of National Intelligence to testify in public.
@RepCummings : We need all of our Republican colleagues to conduct oversight‚Äînot just use strong words.
@RepCummings : I have a letter here that we just received yesterday completely contradicting that Republican talking point. This letter is from a bipartisan group of 21 state Attorneys General‚Äîboth Republicans and Democrats. https://t.co/uWI1xDJIc1
@RepCummings : They argued that states do not need more money because they could cover these security upgrades on their own.
@RepCummings : But even worse, House Republicans are taking active steps to hurt state efforts to protect their election systems.  Just last week, House Republicans blocked all attempts to provide additional funding to secure state election systems.
@RepCummings : It is clear that House Republicans do not want information about how Russia attacked our states in the last election‚Äîwhich seems like a pretty basic first step when you are trying to help these very same states defend against Russian attacks in the next one.
@RepCummings : We implored him to help us get from the Trump Administration these documents about how Russia attacked our states.  But all we got back was total silence.
Because this issue is so important, we joined with the Ranking Members of other key committees and sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan.
@RepCummings : We sent a letter asking Chairman Gowdy to subpoena the documents DHS is withholding, but he ignored it. We sent another letter asking him to let us vote on a subpoena, but he denied our motion.
Let me repeat that‚ÄîPresident Trump‚Äôs own Director of National Intelligence compared our situation now to the months leading up to the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Yet, Chairman Gowdy would not send an invitation to ask anyone from ODNI to testify.

.@RepCummings The harm and trauma our own government is inflicting on these children is continuing and compounding every single day. There is no question that this is an emergency.
.@RepCummings Children are separated from their parents‚Äîby our own government.  Isn‚Äôt that an emergency?  Another week has gone by, and there is still no functioning plan to reunite them.  Isn‚Äôt that an emergency?
.@RepCummings You can have your emergency hearing on Hillary Clinton's emails, but can't we also have one on these kids.
.@RepCummings So, now, I am pleading with you again‚Äîanyone on this panel‚Äîis there one Republican who will join us?
.@RepCummings Apparently, however, we cannot have these documents.  As we all know, Democrats are in the minority, and since no Republican joined our request, the agencies will not produce them.
.@RepCummings We asked for basic, basic information on each child they separated from his or her parents so we could monitor and promote efforts to reunify these families.
.@RepCummings So on Friday, we had to send our own letter, just from the Democrats, dated June 22, to Attorney General Sessions, DHS Secretary Nielson, and HHS Secretary Azar.
.@RepCummings I got no response. I didn't even get a letter. Not a phone call. Nothing.
.@RepCummings To my Republican colleagues, last week I asked a very simple question, but a very profound one. I simply asked for your help.
.@RepCummings But the real emergency is these children‚Äîthese babies and toddlers whom the government has, literally, torn from the arms of their parents.
.@RepCummings Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee is holding a so-called ‚Äúemergency‚Äù hearing on Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. They are hauling up Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray to demand more answers.
.@RepCummings What I do think is extremely serious is the urgent plight of thousands of children who the Trump Administration separated from their parents with no discernible plan to reunite them.
.@RepCummings Like so many other ideas that come out of this White House, President Trump‚Äôs proposal to privatize the Postal Service is disorganized, unilateral, nonsensical, and frankly, incompetent.  I do not think this plan is a serious one.
.@RepCummings These are all basic prerequisites for a serious plan, and they are completely missing from this one.   Last week, my staff asked the Office of Management and Budget for these assessments, and they were told they do not exist.
.@RepCummings For example, why is there no analysis of the costs and benefits of this proposal?  Why is there no assessment of its impact on the federal budget?  Why is there no information at all about how it will affect federal workers?

@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan Whether these facts and others that are not public amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt is another matter, and will be for a jury to decide if Bob Mueller obtains an indictment‚Äîthat is, if the Republicans allow him, and Congress, to do his job.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan Now many of the president‚Äôs lawyers and allies have retreated to a different argument, that collusion is not a crime. But collusion is another word for conspiracy, and conspiracy to violate U.S. election laws is a serious crime, especially when it involves a foreign adversary.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan To claim that these facts show no evidence of collusion requires a willingness to avoid seeing what is in plain sight, or to credit the self-serving explanations of the same Trump officials who misled the country about these same meetings.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan Each of these contacts between the Russians, the Trump campaign, and the transition is now uncontested, yet time and again, the president‚Äôs team, and in some cases the president himself, had lied about them.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan With the president continuing to claim that the investigations have produced no evidence of collusion, it is worth examining the public record after nine months of work. Reality diverges sharply from Mr. Trump‚Äôs vehement denials.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan Republicans excoriated the FBI and Justice Department. Some called for an end to Mr. Mueller‚Äôs work, even as they urged a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton. These attacks are a clear effort to lay the groundwork for a rejection of Mr. Mueller‚Äôs findings.
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan Special Counsel Robert Mueller has secured multiple indictments and guilty pleas. In contrast, eight congressional committees conducted investigations into Benghazi over more than three years and produced no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by anyone other than the attackers.
@RepAdamSchiff President Trump and his allies have been pressing @SpeakerRyan to bring the House‚Äôs investigation to an end, an action that would preclude a comprehensive and bipartisan report to the American public on the full extent of Russia‚Äôs covert political influence operation.
