You should be shocked by that photo. It's a truly nightmarish image. But your reaction should be self-reflection, not shaming. A desire to improve the quality of safety in your own life, not gawk at the lack of safety in someone else's.
Friends, we've got multiple websites dedicated to all the things you should think about when it comes to safety. That's because our NEISS database is full of injuries that were the result of a lack of safety mindfulness in the home.
Are your medicines locked up and out of sight of kids? Is your vape juice? Do you have a carbon monoxide alarm? If you have a baby, are they sleeping on their back? Is their crib stuffed with pillows and blankets that could suffocate them?
Is your furniture anchored to the wall? Do you have cordless window blinds? Is there a smoke alarm in every bedroom and on every floor? Do you have a fire extinguisher in your kitchen? Do you own a decent first aid kit? Do you have a working flashlight?
If there's one thing you should take away from that photo it's that this is the time to evaluate your own home and ask yourself how you could make it safer.
We spend a lot of time on here encouraging people to be more mindful of the safety of themselves and their families. That's because children end up in dangerous situations in every kind of household, with parents from every socioeconomic background, all. the. time.
We've seen the troubling photo of a young child crawling in the middle of the road and while your gut reaction may be to shame the caretakers we ask that you fight that impulse with all your being. If you think this kind of thing could not happen in your home, you are mistaken.

CPSC staff undertakes investigations to identify specific attractions that may contain defects. As complaints or incidents are received, our staff evaluates the complaints and incidents and takes appropriate follow‐up action to promote safety.
CPSC is aware of 22 fatalities associated with amusement attractions (including rides) since 2010. The fatalities do not include work-related incidents and fatalities at water parks or water slides.
The estimate includes injuries associated with fixed rides (amusement or theme parks); mobile rides (carnivals/fairs/festivals); inflatables (inflatable slides or “moon bounces”); coin-operated or free-play rides at restaurants/shopping centers/water parks; and location unknown.
In 2017 there were an estimated 29,400 hospital emergency department visits for amusement attractions, including rides.

@michiforjoy 2. When it comes to play style, the big ones are making sure kids don't attach jump ropes, leashes, or clotheslines to the play equipment and making sure you keep an eye on your kids. If something serious does happen every second counts and you'll want to be able to help quickly.
@michiforjoy 1. To make sure the space is safe, look for shock-absorbing surfaces under the playground equipment (wood chips, mulch, sand). Look for any sharp edges, rusty edges, or other weather wear. Check to make sure surfaces aren't too hot (especially in the western US)
@michiforjoy Overall, two goals to keep in mind when it comes to playgrounds: 1. This space is safe for kids and won't send them to the ER. 2. Kids are playing in a way that won't send them to the ER or worse.

@SaludAmerica A4: Install the anti-tip devices according to manufacturer instructions. Always double check the attachment points to make sure the device is secure. Our #AnchorIt tip card is here to help: https://t.co/KUovOPC5iu (pdf) #SaludTues
@SaludAmerica A4: Lots of places and not much! Anti-tip devices are sold online (search for “anti-tip strap” or “anti-tip kit”) and in-stores from $5 to $25. People can visit their local home improvement, electronic or mass merchandise store to purchase anti-tip devices. #SaludTues

@SaludAmerica A3: Tip #2: Remove items that might tempt kids to climb, such as toys and remote controls, from the top of the TV and furniture. #SaludTues #AnchorIt Watch and share this important PSA: https://t.co/wMyA6JNygk
@SaludAmerica A3: Tip #1: Recycle older and unused TVs. If moving the older TV to another room, be sure it is anchored properly to the wall or to the furniture. The furniture should also be anchored to the wall. #SaludTues #AnchorIt https://t.co/e3FU1GTBrR
@SaludAmerica A3: When a television falls from an average sized dresser, it can fall with the force of thousands of pounds. We want consumers to be aware of this hidden hazard in their homes and keep kids safe. Download this free poster to learn more: https://t.co/UYvLE2rKrH (pdf) #SaludTues

@SaludAmerica A2: Between the ages of 2 and 5, children are at a developmental stage where they like to climb, jump and are eager to exert their independence by dressing themselves or putting on their favorite TV shows. #SaludTues #AnchorIt https://t.co/4ETzB4wFEO
@SaludAmerica A2: 91% of tip-over fatalities occur in the bedroom and about 60 percent of child tip-over fatalities involve children age 2 to 5. #SaludTues Read CPSC's tip-over report (pdf) https://t.co/Rz3afOP2I5 #AnchorIt
@SaludAmerica A2: Children like to climb on furniture as a means to reach something higher. If the furniture or the TV on top of it are not anchored correctly to the wall, there is a chance that they will tip over. #SaludTues https://t.co/if62pjzHvn #AnchorIt

@SaludAmerica A1: Another tip is to check your home for recalled furniture. If you have recalled furniture, stop using it right away, and put it in an area where children cannot access it. Contact the recalling firm to get a refund, replacement or repair: https://t.co/hJfjvMq5OG #SaludTues

Between Jan. 2003 and Aug. 2017, CPSC received a total of 153 reports of incidents, including 105 injuries, related to children’s folding chairs and stools.		The most frequent injuries include pinching, finger injuries and tip-overs due to instability.
The new standard incorporates the most recent voluntary standard developed by ASTM International (ASTM F2613-17a, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Children’s Chairs and Stools), but limits the scope of the CPSC standard to children’s folding chairs and stools.
The mandatory standard contains several requirements for children’s folding chairs and stools, including:		- Latching and locking mechanism or adequate hinge-line clearance requirements,	- Rearwards and sideways stability testing	- Warning labels

Keep menorah candles away from curtains and drapes. If you have a real Christmas tree it's critical to keep it well watered. If you have a fake tree, make sure it's labeled "fire resistant" and use Christmas lights that were tested by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.
