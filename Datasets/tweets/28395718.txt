Obama wants to take country to the left.  GOP willing to accomodate dems by moving to the center.  Conservatives left out either way...
US lost a great leader with the passing of Jack Kemp.  Current GOP leadership should take a lesson from the life of Jack Kemp.
Democrats want to take country to the left.  GOP wants to accomodate dems by moving to the center.  Conservatives left out either way...
GOP leadership is as misguided and corrupt as the democrat leadership.  Both parties are taking US in the wrong direction.
I will never surrender to the Left wing to facilitate a more popular national party!!!  TO HELL WITH THAT IDEA!
Senator Ensign on FoxNews continues to promote the very thing that killed GOP.  Selling out conservative principles for popularity is wrong!
