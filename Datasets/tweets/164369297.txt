It is appalling that @POTUS &amp; Congressional Republicans would shut down the government days before Christmas because they didn‚Äôt get what they wanted. I urge the GOP to embrace compromise and reopen government. #TrumpShutdown
.@RealDonaldTrump says he is ‚Äúproud‚Äù to shut down the government for his costly, expensive border wall, yet his government shutdown leaves 90% of @DHSgov employees to work without pay just days before Christmas. #TrumpShutdown
The majority of Americans don‚Äôt think a #TrumpShutdown is good policy. @HouseGOP &amp; @RealDonaldTrump ought to work with Democrats to reopen the government now.
@johnsifton @cunardline @BilldeBlasio Cruise ships docking using clean power 50% of the time  is not acceptable, and CM Menchaca and I are calling on EDC to get to  100%. Anything short is inadequate.
The #TrumpShutdown has many negative effects for workers and families. It also illustrates yet another reason why a federal receivership of NYCHA would be a bad idea!
TO ALL RED HOOK RESIDENTS ‚Äì We hear you on the cruise ship issue. We‚Äôve gotten 50% of cruise ships to dock using clean power, up from 33% - but make no mistake, 100% is the goal. We‚Äôll be working closely with EDC to ensure this happens. Anything short of 100% is inadequate.

Let me get this straight, 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents were released the night before the confirmation of a SCOTUS nominee during a time of unprecedented corruption in the White House. The American people deserve to know Kavanaugh‚Äôs full record.
We can't lose sight of the rollbacks that Kavanaugh, if confirmed, could impose on voting rights, abortion rights, access to health care and so much more. This is about moving America forward, not backwards. There is too much at stake and we must #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
The #FloresAgreement isn‚Äôt a loophole. Waiving this provision would eliminate key protections for children in immigration detention that ensure safe, sanitary conditions for traumatized children. #NotALoophole #EndFamilyDetention

In 2013, the Supreme Court weakened  protections put in place by the #VRA to help voters of color pursue their basic right to cast a ballot on election day. Congress can and must take action to restore the Voting Rights Act. The foundation of our Democracy depends on it.
Many people associate the VRA with fighting voter suppression in the South but the law also had tangible impacts in NYC. It put an end to literacy tests in BK, Manhattan and the Bronx ‚Äì tests that disenfranchised Puerto Rican New Yorkers who were educated in Spanish.
On this day 53 years ago, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. The law sought justice for voters of color who had been systemically disenfranchised. After SCOTUS gutted much of the law in 2013, it is incumbent upon Congress to #RestoretheVOTE.

Trump‚Äôs DHS @SecNielsen says this is not the Administration‚Äôs policy‚ÄîFALSE. Trump‚Äôs 100% criminal prosecution policy for asylum seekers is what is separating children from their parents.
Instead? Trump is blaming Democrats and playing politics with the lives of children who are suffering at the hands of the U.S. government. #EndFamilySeparation
How did we get to this? The Trump Administration put in place a ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù policy that is separating children as young as 12 months old from their parents as a form of deterrence and punishment. @realDonaldTrump could end this TODAY.

I am a proud member of @HouseDemWomen‚Äîwhere we are fighting every day to help raise the voices &amp; power of women in America. I‚Äôve co-sponsored the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which would help close the #wagegap by giving workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination. #EqualPayDay
Black women must work till August 7 for salaries to finally catch up to what white men made in 2017. Native women must work till September 27 for their salaries to catch up. And, Latinas must work the longest: November 1 for their salaries to catch up to men's. #EqualPay now!
Today, April 10th is #EqualPayDay, women must work 3 extra months just to earn the same pay as men. Over a 40-year career, the avg woman loses $418K to the #WageGap. But many groups of women lose so much more than that. Just some of the reasons why we need #EqualPayForEqualWork.

.@NRA has always opposed the CDC studying gun violence like the epidemic it is -- &amp; producing data on how to stop these tragedies. I have a bill that would fund CDC research with a modest fee on gun sales. We need commonsense steps like this. Just saying no is not an option.
President Obama had a policy meant to make it harder for mentally troubled people to secure firearms. @realDonaldTrump reversed that policy. Not all the facts are out yet &amp; yes we are all still mourning -- but could we at least start there? #EnoughIsEnough
