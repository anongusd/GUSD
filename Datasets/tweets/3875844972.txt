@mikeoz No doubt.  That's more a message to Padre fans.
@CNNSotu @Bakari_Sellers @BernieSanders Bakari Sellout--unable to support the non-establishment candidate:		https://t.co/UxILlA0Sp8
@Bakari_Sellers Bakari Sellout and his inability to support anyone that isn't an establishment democrat.
@thedavidcrosby What's positive? The full frontal or a potential distribution deal? üòÄ
@thinkprogress ...and she married him for love too.
@mikeoz Awesome! Only 300+ spring training games and 1,620 regular season games to go!		Dodger fans were tired of him after 2 months, but good luck!

@mikeoz ...and it‚Äôll never happen again.
@MeghanMcCain Meghan has 3 modes @TheView:		1. Talk about daddy.		2. Get angry when someone disagrees with her (especially Joy...but the "it's my job" BS with @SenSanders was an example of it today).		3. Twirling her hair and looking up or down at the cameras.
@MeghanMcCain This is like the MD Hippocratic oath for Republicans: known as the hypocritic oath. Hypocrisy at its finest...		A conservative that's calling out others for how they'll be regarded in history.
@CoryUpdate @kimguilfoyle @GavinNewsom @kimguilfoyle...taking the "jilted ex" title to an entirely new extreme.		Hey @GavinNewsom, your ex-wife is nuts.
@DodgersNation Not even close.		The only way to look at this team with its inept catching corp, weakened depth, and Kershaw potentially on the bench and STILL believe that BS is through rose-colored glasses.
@RepLaMalfa @RepByrne @SenTedCruz @BetsyDeVosED Oroville (the town closest to your own home) needs a strong public school system to help people up.		The Paradise school district is going to struggle for years.		But you continue to only help yourself and others like you.  You're a disgrace, plain and simple.
@nowthisnews @AOC @reshmasaujani @GirlsWhoCode You're incredible @AOC, absolutely incredible!		Continue to focus on those things that matter, drown out the noise, and know you're an inspiration to many, many, people!
@kengurnick Slow news day Ken?
@ChadMoriyama Even a blind squirrel Chad...let's hope this is Bob's moment.
@MLBNetwork @Royals Ummmm, this is really a question?
@DanRather After all these years of calling himself a stable genius billionaire, are you sure it's not @realDonaldTrump himself that can't handle the truth?
@GOP ...with the lies and manipulation being EXACTLY the reasons your grifter-in-chief president had him working for his organization for over a decade.
@nowthisnews Fordham University confirms Cohen's statement:		https://t.co/hXMHug4eDJ
@RepLaMalfa @ClifBar @ClifBar--a corporation doing what Republican hacks like @RepLaMalfa are incapable of...		https://t.co/7iAZWroDQI
@molly_knight We can‚Äôt expect a Trump to be able to read all those big words when they form sentences and paragraphs.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Your President chose Michael Cohen for exactly those types of situations and the lies to which you speak were largely done to protect the grifter-in-chief.		Maybe you should ask yourself why Trump surrounds himself with this type of individual.
So @RepMarkMeadows, YOU are the one that was actually lying in order to hit the highlight reel on @FoxNews?		What a joke. https://t.co/fi3dtRLNs2
@ProvenClosers @DustinNosler Well, it's the A's so the Dodgers can probably get him in about 2 years--like their stellar trade of Donaldson for some nacho cheese sauce.
@JohnFugelsang Even a blind squirrel John.
@davidmweissman @travisakers News also came out today that The woman that accused Mueller of inappropriate behavior admitted Wohl put her up to it.
@RepLaMalfa @POTUS How do you honestly say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a nation of laws‚Äù out of one side of your mouth and voice support for circumventing the Constitutional separation of powers out of the other side?		What you really are is an unintelligent joke.
@AtheisticLib Scroll down to the party affiliation for this one:		https://t.co/RKe1sex4Hm
@AtheisticLib Yup...		https://t.co/NRl2b1SH5W
@mike_petriello (2/2)  ...You disagreed with a "Nah"		It isn't as simple as "the Coors effect", just as it isn't as simple with the pitcher's approach, but I would argue that they are both factors in the changes we're seeing in the game--however small they may be.
@mike_petriello (1/2) You're right--it's complicated, as with most things there are many, many factors coming into play.		But the same can be said of the reason pitchers are pitching out of the zone.  I argued the hitter's approach (working toward power and launch angle instead of contact)...
@Martina The disconnect from the average citizen is stunning.  These people have no shame and lack the intelligence to keep their mouths shut.
@RobertA54611889 @CBSNews ...and became the new Revlon spokesmodel.
@CBSNews I didn't know Gods smoked cancer sticks.		You learn something new every day.
@demassie2 @hairgirl712 @chinchilla1970 @iamRuthECarter Way to go racial @demassie2.		It's real simple--treat people the way you want to be treated.  If you're incapable of doing, you're the racist.
@molly_knight ...and there's @TheAthleticLA's version of "What I did Last Summer" that they make every writer produce.		Regardless, congratulations Molly. You'll do great.
@demassie2 @hairgirl712 @chinchilla1970 @iamRuthECarter I‚Äôm an absolute left-wing liberal so that‚Äôs complete BS. This has nothing to do with politics‚Äîit‚Äôs calling someone out for bad behavior. They both deserved the spotlight‚Äîthey absolutely earned it. But what would you be saying if Hart didn‚Äôt give Beachler a chance to talk?
@ChadMoriyama @mike_petriello No doubt.  We just have last year's playoff game on a constant loop at my house.
@chinchilla1970 @iamRuthECarter Legit happy for you winning for production design.  It was incredible and gave an emotional speech, but you def. owe Jay Hart a big apology for completely stealing what was his moment too.
I thought Hannah Beachler winning for production design was absolutely incredible and she gave an emotional speech, but she owes Jay Hart a big apology for completely stealing what was his moment too.
@IndivisibleNet Interesting take @TuckerCarlson, but the constitution was written 250 years ago too‚Äîand you believe a musket and AR-15 are equal.		What‚Äôs good for one is good for the other. Right?
@m_millsey If I remember right Monster tour = Nudie suit.
@peta Let me say this as a pet loving, blue-bleeding, dyed-in-the-wool liberal.		You guys are acting like assholes and contribute to the reason people complain about the left-wing.		You'll never get another dime from me.
@KristyInCA @Giants55 @mrsabad @MLBONFOX How many names has this park had now?  If they keep renaming it, it'll just be called Corporate Joke park--now matter how beautiful.
@kylegriffin1 In @realDonaldTrump's defense, "memorandum" and "understanding" have more than 3-4 letters.  We can't expect President "Big Brain" to know the phrase.
@megynkelly I watched your old clip on Scientology with Michelle LeClair today and I can't believe how hypocritically smug you were with your comments.		I can't stand Scientology, but I also can't stand the "my religion is better" B.S. (aka the "Santa is white" crap) you spew.
@AmberAudio @salmonprotocol @michaelshure @johniadarola You're right Amber, and that'll probably be the equivalent to YouTube signing their own death warrant.  Users will move to other options/sites over time.  It won't be overnight, but it will happen.
@tedcruz Hey you hypocritical, narcissistic, hack! Why didn‚Äôt we see these types of comments with any of the 50+ ‚Äúgo back to your own country‚Äù posts the past few years?
@BNightengale I can't believe you haven't found anything else to write about.  How many versions of this story have you produced now?
@TheDailyEdge This may actually be the first thing @realDonaldTrump actually "knows more about than anyone".
@salmonprotocol @michaelshure @johniadarola That wasn't directed at your comment Selman, it's just commentary on comment sections in general.  If someone writes something unintelligent, mean spirited, etc., they're just letting you know all you need to know about them.
@michaelshure @johniadarola Okay, that's an opinion.  But your inability to see the irony in shutting down online YouTube comments, on a site dedicated to online comments is, at best, comical.
@salmonprotocol @michaelshure @johniadarola Of course, but a blanket shut down by YouTube is idiotic.		My dad always said, "If someone tells you about themselves, believe them".  If a jackass leaves a troll-like comment online, they're telling you EXACTLY who they are.  I can then judge them appropriately.
@michaelshure @johniadarola I'm don't know Michael, maybe the 1st amendment?
@tinkertime As a FF/Paramedic, I'm all for bringing attention to the opioid epidemic, but your comparing fentanyl and aspirin mg is ridiculous.  As someone associated with the medical field, you know (or definitely should) for ANY meds, 1000mg of 1 might be 1mg of another!

@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett @JussieSmollett needs to be called out (and will be) if found guilty.		But what about the continuous stream of videos showing MAGA racism since you took office?  No comment on those?  You are a disgrace to true Christians and conservatives and will be removed as POTUS in 2020.
