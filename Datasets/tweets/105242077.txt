A6: (part 2)  If it moves to the blood vessels of the lungs as a #PE, it can mimic a heart attack with shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. It can also cause pain with breathing or coughing of blood. #Clotchat @tbplante
Hot tip: The backbone of treatment for a new #DVT or #PE is anticoagulation (blood thinning) meds. These keep the blood clot stable and stop it from growing. Blood thinning meds support the natural response in your body that leads to break down of the clot. #ClotChat @tbplante
