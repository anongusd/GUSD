@othersteve I agree on the first point. We have to be ready for the technocracy!
@modernistwitch Good luck! Fuck boobs!
@othersteve No problem. Sure, but history has shown that the labor market does not foster wage increases suitable to inflation or standards of living. A better way to incentivize large corporations to pay up is a tax on their profits to be democratically dispersed among the working class.
@othersteve You could say that. What I advocate for is more of a democratic, decentralized form of socialism, closer to social democracy than state-sponsored socialism. Per your bio, up I know we have to be careful with these terms as they’ve been bastardized by the US political landscape
@abbygov Im 5’6”, happily married, and I am a Marxist. I agree that this goob’s height aids in his Napoleon complex. All he had to do was be a lefty and he’d’ve gotten laid and wouldn’t have to be a Puny Pinochet™️
@othersteve What i mean by “running out of people’s labor” is that the inherent exploitation of Capitalism, employers making profit that is many times what they pay their labor force, the real creators of capital wealth, is unsustainable. Some of that excess has to go back to the people.
@othersteve Capitalism compels the provision of labor by force- the threat of starvation and homelessness. How else could people get away with paying the least amount possible, not allowing their employees decent living? Socialism aims to compel fairness in exchange by removing that force.

@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll I’ll read into this more. You seem educated on this and you’ve convinced me quite a bit. I don’t want to use your back as a bridge to my understanding. I hadn’t even considered that a black feminist would support IDPs. I thought it was white campus mumbo jumbo. I will learn!
@eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll That was funny 😄
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll I feel more solidarity with the working black folks than wealthy whites, even considering my privilege as a white man in a white supremacist society. I do anti-racism work daily. I think my disagreement with identity politics doesn’t make me racist, just opposed politically
@eclecticbrotha @subalternuplift @Rosal1ndRu553ll I will look into this. I didn’t know that. I was always told by black marxists it was a tool of the white liberal elite
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll I live in a mostly black community on the south side of Chicago. The IDP of the intelligentsia and campus leftists does not serve them and will not serve them. Public access to resources and equity will
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll It directly conflicts with what Bell Hooks says about building coalition. That white people are allies when they work against the oppression of POC with their peers, which is what I do by embracing a class consciousness. POC are killed by our troops,out health care system,housing
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll I call myself a socialist because I am against the murderous and dehumanizing inequality in today’s America, which includes white supremacy and patriarchy. Identity politics is by the few, for the few. It does not unite working people to fight back.
@BarackDaVote @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll Good q!
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll We must have an entirely opposite idea of what identity politics actually is
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll Well I took you for a liberal since you said to reject corporatist, neoconservative political thought makes me racist
@subalternuplift @eclecticbrotha @Rosal1ndRu553ll Well I see you’re a socialist. Shouldn’t you disagree with the ID politics because white feminists use it to disempower black Marxist feminism?

@caroleigh21 @krassenstein @BetoORourke “What’ld you do?”
@betterwchile @krassenstein @SenSanders MoveOn is likely to endorse Bernie. His tactic was smart and is still available to him. Most young people I know plan to vote Bernie as a Dem. who won’t tolerate it? You?

@KaitMarieox What you’re describing is called “Socialist Feminism” and we’re glad you practice it, comrade ✊🌹
@HungryComrade I had no idea that excess fat outside of obesity was unhealthy. I know obesity can cause heart disease, fatty liver, diabetes, joint and muscle-skeletal issues but i thought being merely overweight or carry some excess fat puts you in the safe zone.
@HungryComrade It is often to shame a fat loved that grosses you out. I say loved one because strangers are at times comfortable calling you a “fatass”, “fat piece of shit” “bill bye the sandwich guy” (i has a bow tie on, big mistake!) anyway that’s my theory on why people resent that statement
@HungryComrade ...” I don’t like looking at your fatness and it is my will for you to look better” Sure, it’s correct to say fat is unhealthy for well understood reasons. The problem is the intention behind.
@HungryComrade ...for a natural fat person to burn enough calories in a day to not carry excess fat. Anyway I’ve never heard body pos people say fat isn’t unhealthy, that sucks, but in my experience the people who say “I just think you would be healthier if you lost some weight” really mean...
@HungryComrade My motivation is mostly to not have to experience heart disease and diabetes. I have been fat since the day I was born, minus a small stint in wrestling which was only aided by extreme 2-3 daily workout and cutting weight. It takes utter desperation at all times...
@HungryComrade I have finally succumb to the pressure to be healthy. I eat all Keto, gafaste for 16 hours a day, and work out on the eliptical daily. I do not lose weight simply@by eating healthily. I haven’t eaten fast food or drank soda in years (except for later croix of course).

And not just Bernie, but the democratic socialists of the world— those who say to Americans that we ALL have, especially our poor, the right to a decent life, and that plutocracy doesnt have to collapse this country under the weight of inequality. Onward, comrades,to victory!	2/2
The only chance for progress to be made in this country is for the Democrats to swing far left, to fight fire with fire, because at the end of the day, Hilary Clinton is Donald Trump, Carter is Nixon, Mondale is Reagan... But Bernie, Bernie is the voice for the marginalized many!

@WhosAGrumpyBear @ZachWritesStuff Yes, that sure wouldn’t be good for business! Addicts know were dancing with the devil, too, but without a fellowship we can’t spot our own self-deception!
@WhosAGrumpyBear @ZachWritesStuff At this point I agree, this law is both unjust and unethical
@WhosAGrumpyBear @ZachWritesStuff Yes I do, and that just feeds the cycle of addiction, violence, and depravity
@ZachWritesStuff @GonzoToolbox That’s true. These stories are happening all across the country. The least we can do is stand for compassion and policy and that can help others.
@ZachWritesStuff @GonzoToolbox I’m glad you took the time to educate and have a civil discussion with me. I am forming more realistic and informed beliefs about drug reform now. As someone close to it, it’s amazing how little I’ve researched it.
@GonzoToolbox @ZachWritesStuff I was typing with my heart and not my head. When my brother died, i had to check myself into psych treatment because I was planning to gun down the whole dope spot that gave him the fentanyl that killed him. I’ve come a long way, but sometimes I Can backslide into resentment
@GonzoToolbox @ZachWritesStuff You’re way behind, man! I already walked back my opinion on this thread. I admitted closed-mindedness and giving in to authoritarian logic, and moved to opposing this type of legislation.
@HillPharmD @ZachWritesStuff @cmoraff Thank you 🙏 compelling read!
@ZachWritesStuff @DirectFirpo chosen to blame the dealers.I am reacting emotionally instead of thinking logically.I think I need to practice open mindedness and compassion in this case, and maybe rethink my political beliefs about this. Clearly, the drug war is awful and I can’t support those lines of thought
@ZachWritesStuff @DirectFirpo That true, especially those in the hood or working spots for gangs, they can even be children. There is a range, and  I have to practice open mindedness. Plus, the law rarely solves any social ills. I think I have some anger over the deaths of my family and friends and I’ve
@ZachWritesStuff @DirectFirpo they range from a lack of regard for human life to being stone cold killers, all in the interest of lining their pockets
@ZachWritesStuff @DirectFirpo A drug dealer left my identical twin brother dying in his bedroom 7 years ago, which contributed to his death. Sure, no one ties us down and forces us to feed our addiction and the respondibility for the harm we’ve caused is ours alone, but my experience with dealers is that
@DirectFirpo @ZachWritesStuff I could concede that
@ZachWritesStuff I agree with you there!
@Sentinel_Vaughn @ZachWritesStuff Well that’s a major flaw!
@bonnieshouses @ZachWritesStuff @ShaunKing @Sentinel_Vaughn @LeoBeletsky @DanCiccarone Thank you! 2 years, 3 months, and 8 days clean off opiates and all other drugs!
@DerekCrimLaw @ZachWritesStuff I agree with you with regard to the drug addicts, but I don’t believe we should be light on heroin dealers. Addicts are sick people trying to get well and they don’t deserve to be criminalized. Dope dealers are scum—they kill addicts daily.
@ZachWritesStuff The law is designed to impose harsh sentences on people who sell drugs to people who then die—“dope dealers” if you will. This law is not designed to imprison addicts. In this case it has and this man should beat this case. Selling hot shots is murder, and this law is just.
RT @DavidKlion: https://t.co/gYwaeIDiV4
@ZachWritesStuff @ShaunKing @Sentinel_Vaughn @LeoBeletsky @DanCiccarone As a recovering addict, I support this law. Going after dope dealers and people who fix up a hot shots, whether or not they OD or are addicts themselves, is the right move. In this particular case, 40+ years for accidentally killing his friend is excessive. Policy is ok though 👌

@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr Furthermore, our current gun leg is killing poor POC right now, dead black/brown bodies in Chicago killed by white, Surburban, legal guns
@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr I’m sure they do. But these crimes are not being committed by people who use it. The black market is a deterrent that spans classes
@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr The black market for guns flourishes in my neighborhood, among poor people. Middle class whites are the problem in this instance
@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr I live in a poor urban neighborhood. The issue is ppl being able to get ARs at Walmart, none of the hood rats here are shooting up schools
@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr Yeah, I’m sure this paddock guy would have had an easy time rolling through Englewood looking for 10 fully automatic weapons
@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr Recent mass shootings have not been performed by black market guns, while shootings in poor urban neighborhoods have. It cuts out the former
@ChudsMacKenzie @ChrisSturr Criminalizing not only makes them expensive but fewer and inaccessible to most, especially those without criminal ties ie Holmes, Paddock

@DavidBillips7 Thank you for sharing. Fibromyalgia is no small potatoes! I bet youve had to be tough for those 3 years and I respect your perserverence
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett so I cannot defend him as being much different than classic Clintonism. This daca things, trans in the military..not change, its lip service
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett measures.We reward cultural politics these days. Trumps ideas to save the working class are good on paper, but his actions are establishment
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett But so far he has embraced the corporate hold on politics, left our troops in costly wars, repealed no trade deals, and only passed symbolic
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett Trump offered a promise to save the working people, to boost the economy and bring business home, to stand up to the corporate oppressors
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett Instead of condemning the working masses, GOP goes after the immigrants, Libs now go after the masses, the "deplorables", which is elitist
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett Which dissolves unity in this country even further and has pushed a lot of young people to the right, afraid lib-ism is the new puritanism
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett Today the libs do it through considering  these people bigoted and themselves woke, theyve become social conservatives regarding virtue
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett Ultimately this has worked in Trumps favor. The Republican Party used to condemn the masses, condemning working people as backwards and dumb
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett I understand your frustration with the libs using the tolerance card as a means to feel superior to conservatives and working class whites
@DavidBillips7 Daca deals with people who came as children and did not make the choice to come here. But they are already here and want to contribute to US
@DavidBillips7 @Mikel_Jollett I agree. Obama should have had this bill passed through congress. Prsidntial  initiatives are weak and dont create real change as we've seen

@HAGOODMANAUTHOR @ProgressiveArmy Mamá always told me, "Only bullies get bullied."

@daniecal Keep up the discourse tho you're killin it!
@daniecal Truth. Leftists haven't had a real stab at it since the Dems absorbed the populist party in the late 1800s, but they've strayed so hard...
@daniecal Trying to argue with the right is futile. But we have much to gain to convince "Liberals" to nix the neocons and join a people's party.

Only once we have achieved this dream will we begin to reverse the destruction of this country and its people.	#TheResistance #UniteBlue
In order to reduce inequality in this country #MAGA There must be a complete disidentification from this system, a #blackandwhite revolt
Things won't change at this trajectory, no matter how much we speak out against #hate The system won't allow it.
The #trailerparkboys and #ghetto dwellers of this country are told by @TheDemocrats and @GOP that they are better than the other.
Those perpetrators of #Charlottesviille weren't poor. They were #yuppies . Even fucking @DrDavidDuke has a masters degree.
but it won't mean shit if I sing the #liberal tune of being better than my fellow citizens for being socially conscious #sjw
I am lucky to have access to enough information  #privilege and socialization to be #woke
If these #Deplorables voices and black voices speak the same tune, the #liberals and #conservatives will be forced to give up their wealth
a #capitalist corporate #plutocracy that requires and enforces inequality (what easier way to dole out #privilege than how someone looks.)
keep people divided on racial lines, so that the 120 million poor #americans don't rise and dismantle the system
Poor whites and poor blacks have more in common than the people of the same race do between classes. Both parties #dempublicans
so they wouldn't squabble over their own #poverty ( specifically #CivilRights and onward)
They do this to remain in power, just as the #rightwing convinced poor #wypipo they were better than poor black people
labeling poor whites, who often are socialized with #racist tendencies, as #deplorables in an effort to keep #racial tensions high
These days the #Liberal elite sell a psychological wage of being socially conscious, and therefore better, to the middle class and up,
I find it funny that @DNC supporters call themselves #TheResistance ...  Centrists were not on the front line in Charleston #russophobes
@Politics_PR @DNC should have called for a full-scale war with the Kremlin, ousted both enemies (Trump and Russia)
@Politics_PR Goes to show that Trump was in cahoots with our SWORN ENEMY	#nukerussia #warwithrussia
