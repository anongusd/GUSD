@Jim_Rebuff @mitchellvii I agree and government should wait to see how things play out first.
@Jim_Rebuff @mitchellvii Point taken. This is happening now &amp; unemployment is dropping the $15/hr jobs are being shifted to logistics, warehousing, F&amp;B, hospitals, retail or to service oriented jobs like Netflix. The new generation of kids should spend more time skilling themselves with STEM skills
@Jim_Rebuff @mitchellvii American retailers pays China for goods. Then American people pay American retailers for goods who pay Americans to work. I will agree this may cause a decrease in American manufacturing jobs but the decrease is being offset by the increase in logistics jobs like truck driving
@mitchellvii Firing is not the issue. Starving his budget, having final say so on who &amp; if/when people can see Mueller report overseeing indictments without oversight is the problem especially since he's already publicly stated his position on this case WITHOUT seeing the facts.
