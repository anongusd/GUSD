I asked @Humana to help me fill a Rx from the #1 Vascular Surgeon in Hawai’i, Dr Elna Masuda. Humana said they’d pay for my leg wraps IF I could wear a size off the shelf. My legs are too big, so Humana told me to go pound sand rather than hepp me get custom fit wraps at $800/leg
I also asked @Humana for a patient advocate. @AskHMSA gave me a patient advocate when I tried to get nonelastic leg bindings, but Humana said I need to be near dead before they’ll let anyone actually HELP ME. So pissed off.
I’m working on a project to improve my health, but fucking @Humana says I have to be SICKER to qualify for ANY help. You’d THINK Humana would value someone taking the initiative to get healthy, but they want me to have diabetes or kidney disease before I qualify for anything 😡

.@Shy_Survivor My parent is transgender. I grew up in the trans community. Not one of them ever tried to hurt me. EVER. #NoOnHB2
.@Shy_Survivor Why aren’t laws being passed to stop Sexual Predators from using bathrooms?? That alone says this is LGBT #DISCRIMINATION
A door does NOT protect kids @Shy_Survivor.
That said, @Shy_Survivor, #PennState sure turned a BLIND EYE to #JerrySandusky raping boys. #JoePaterno knew for years, did NOTHING.
That’s junk @Shy_Survivor!! Men do NOT dress as women to rape girls in bathrooms! Women do NOT dress as men to rape boys either.
This is very frustrating, @Jessi4JC!! My friends/family are scared too! We have so many bigger issues to deal with these days.
Bullshit, @Shy_Survivor! If that was the reason, then ban SEX OFFENDERS from public facilities! This is #DISCRIMINATION!! @RepMikeHager
Because, @RepMikeHager, let’s be honest: Men who are Comfortable with their sexuality do NOT advance these kinds of laws. #HB2
.@RepMikeHager So now you are going to foist all YOUR Sexual Insecurities on your constituents. #HB2
.@RepMikeHager Or someone whipped you in school because they said you “Run Like A Girl” as if that’s the worst thing ever. #HB2
.@RepMikeHager I’d venture your Daddy BEAT you for being perceived as “gay” when you cried as a boy. #HB2
.@RepMikeHager Maybe you Hate transpeople bc someone you once fancied turned out to be trans?? #HB2
Maybe your Church or your Daddy beat it out of you @RepMikeHager?? Maybe you have a Dark Secret to share?? #HB2
That said, @RepMikeHager, why are YOU afraid of people who are transgender, hmmm?? #HB2

Good thing no one is going hungry or dying in NC @RepMikeHager. Obviously you MUST have more pressing problems than #HB2, yes?!
.@RepMikeHager @JWhitehurst Why does #HB2 NOT stop Registered SEX OFFENDERS from entering PUBLIC bathrooms?? Hmmm?? #DISCRIMINATION
.@RepMikeHager @JWhitehurst 16yo male student of mine is a Registered Sex Offender for Towel Snapping his Coach in a locker room #HB2
FYI @RepMikeHager, @JWhitehurst, I’m not ok w grown men showering in the same rooms as BOYS. #HB2 is DISCRIMINATION wrapped in LIES
