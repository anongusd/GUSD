Lots of good-natured back and forth on military service between GOP ranking member Trent Kelly, who is in Army National Guard, and #transgender troop witnesses. Polar opposite of biting partisanship of Cohen hearing today.
New Dem majority on Armed Services called this hearing to put a public face on Trump's #transgender policy. Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King talking now about jumping out of helicopters onto mountains in #Afghanistan.
"I looked into his eyes and it shook me. As cliche as it may sound, I saw darkness. It felt cold and he was without remorse for what he had done," testified Wyatt, who is a corpsman and gave Pemberton a medical check-up.
Wow. Akira Wyatt, a transgender sailor, is testifying about the moment she met and looked into the eyes of Marine Lance Cpl. Joseph Pemberton, who was convicted of killing a transgender women in the Philippines.
House testimony of active-duty #transgender troops is remarkable. It comes more than a year and half after Trump tweeted out his decision to exclude #transgender service.
Peace says she would be the first to kick out any #transgender troops who are unable to meet military standards.
Capt. Jennifer Peace, who is #transgender, would be among current troops who would be grandfathered under Trump's policy. But notes she and others would be locked into their current positions, effectively blocked from advancement.
Rep. Speier says 14,700 transgender people are serving in the military. I don't recall seeing any reliable confirmation of a total number (workplace surveys note a very small % of troops self identify). DOD said just under 1,000 troops sought treatment for gender dysphoria.
Seems likely that Gaetz anticipated all of this when he tweeted and took a calculated risk. https://t.co/4X1sDBJTii

How this may work:	1) Congress denies Trump border $$	2) Trump takes border $$ from military	3) Military requests lost $$ from Congress
DOD's McMahon pledges to give House lawmakers a list of delayed military construction projects - by state. That should be interesting.
Rep. @DWStweets points out that DOD requesting $$ to replace mil-con money is essentially asking Congress to pay for the wall, says it must think lawmakers are chumps.
DOD's criteria for tapping mil-con projects to pay for border wall, per Assist Sec McMahon:	1. pose minimal operational or readiness risks if deferred	2.  already scheduled to be awarded in last six months of fiscal year	3. recapitalization projects of existing facilities
That seems like an ambitious timeline. DOD budget top line figures expected the week of March 11.
BUT 3) DOD plans to tell the House it will request $$ in its FY20 budget request -- expected in mid-March -- to replace funding for any raided military construction projects ...
2) DOD will say the military has not yet ID'd military construction projects in its own budget that would be delayed so $$ can be shifted to Trump's border barriers ...
Border wall hearing: DOD will tell House panel today that 1) it is waiting on DHS to propose a list of construction projects along the border ...

Votel says he read Crocker editorial. Calls him a leading expert on region. 'I would characterize where we are in the process as very, very earlier.' Says Afghan govt being consulted.
Wicker reading through Crocker column and argument that U.S. has de-legitimized #Afghan government.
Wicker notes Ryan Crocker's column in WaPo about #Afghanistan withdrawal being a surrender.
Sen. Wicker, GOP, praising Dem Reed's opening statement on costs of withdrawing from #Syria and #Afghanistan.
Reed: If U.S. withdraws from #Afghanistan, would $4B per year in security support still be needed?	Votel: Support to Afghan forces would still be needed but level would need to be determined.
Sen. Reed, now questioning Votel, turns to #Afghanistan withdrawal.
Votel says working through various scenarios of how U.S. can keep pressure on ISIS in #Syria as it withdraws troops.
Sen. Inhofe priorities so far: Defend Trump Syria withdrawal and U.S. involvement in #Yemen. Highlight #China engagement in Africa.
Sen. Inhofe highlighting costs of U.S. disengaging in #Yemen.
Votel says he believes all ISIS territory in #Syria will be liberated before troop withdrawal.
Sen. Inhofe defends Trump withdrawal position, cites unfriendly media coverage.
Talks are underway with allies on the details on stabilization efforts in #Syria post-U.S. troop presence, Votel tells Senate Armed Services.
Votel says #ISIS controls area now less than 24 square miles.
Trump likely to announce soon, possibly during #SOTU, that ISIS has been cleared from 100% of territory in #Syria. But IG report released yesterday warns it could re-emerge within 6-12 months.
Clearly Trump's #Syria withdrawal leading the concerns at this Votel testimony.
Sen. Reed, top SASC Democrat, says #Syria withdrawal was 'anything but thoughtful and deliberate.'
Sen. Inhofe says he wants an explanation from Gen. Votel of how the U.S. will keep ISIS from returning after @realDonaldTrump announced #Syria troop withdrawal.
Now: Gen. Votel, CENTCOM commander, starting his testimony to Senate Armed Services.

Important to note that Shanahan gave his long-awaited press conference 30 minutes before the HASC hearing started and said 'several thousand' more troops would be needed at the border.
Plenty of opportunities during the HASC hearing to ask about the new troop numbers - which the press corps has been trying to nail down for weeks - but it seems Smith missed an opportunity to press DOD at the outset.
Smith instead pursued a line of questioning about the legitimacy of deploying active-duty troops to the border.  'It is very, very rare to send active duty troops to the border,' Smith said.
After Rood disclosed the fact of more troops, Smith (frustratingly) followed up immediately with questions BUT never asked about the new deployment. 'The original number was, like, 5,600 I believe, something like that? How long were that many troops there?'
... Rood, DOD under secretary, told Smith at the top of the hearing on Tuesday: 'There will be additional deployments of active duty troops that will go through the end of this fiscal year, Sept. 30, in response to the latest request from the Department of Homeland Security.' ...
HASC chairman Smith pens angry letter to Shanahan, saying DOD did not disclose in Tuesday testimony that 3,500 troops headed to border as part of new DHS request BUT ...

‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to try to combat discrimination within the military,‚Äô Rep. Smith says about chairing HASC, mentioning #transgender policy specifically.
Smith doesn‚Äôt think there is wall funding in Trump‚Äôs $750B defense budget top line, but if so lawmakers would ‚Äòfreak out‚Äô and move to stop it.
Rep. Smith said there is bipartisan support for putting legislation into #FY20NDAA blocking Trump from using military to build border wall.
‚ÄòWe can more than survive for less than $750 billion‚Äô for the defense budget - Rep. Adam Smith
Still, Smith says @RoKhanna resolution important because it puts public pressure on the administration on #Yemen.

Trump‚Äôs deployment of troops to border is about ‚Äòoptics‚Äô to portray an invasion, but is actually unnecessary, Rep. Smith says.
Smith says he wants legislation for #transgender troops similar to lifting of Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell, but doesn‚Äôt believe it can pass Congress.

Inhofe wraps Fort McNair appearance after more than 1 hour of address and Q&amp;A.
Inhofe says agriculture in his state has been hit by trade war with #China but says it appears to be working.
'I have been the most conservative member of the U.S. Senate for a number of years,' Inhofe says.
Inhofe says Republicans were finally able to break the Democrat demand for parity between defense + non-defense spending caps last year. He hopes to do the same in 2019.
Audience member was quoting a Roman historian, apparently, secure peace by preparing for war.
Audience question starts '2,000 years ago ... ' Military academics here at National Defense University.
Inhofe says the problem with #Africa is it's too big when it comes to US military operations. Says a dedicated SFAB would be good.
On #China in #Africa: 'They don't hire anyone, they bring their own labor,' Inhofe says. 'All the infrastructure that is out there has been built, and they are doing it ... They would be the ones that I'm most concerned about.'
Africa question alert. Inhofe has taken a keen interest in Africa for years.
Inhofe reading through his sheet about China and Russia threats ...
Inhofe, when asked about China and Russia challenges, says he has to get his cheat sheet from the dais to answer accurately.
'I think it was a bad choice and one that he and I will be able to sit down and talk about,' Inhofe says about Rep. Adam Smith and his skepticism about nuclear spending.
Inhofe on Adam Smith: 'We are two different people with two different philosophies.' He says Smith made a mistake by calling out cost of updating the nuclear arsenal.
Inhofe says he discussed cost sharing with allies when he met Trump, Pence and Bolton in the White House Tuesday. He says allies need to spend more and take on more of the burden.
Big difference now is European allies and others know the US does not have the resources to carry them, Inhofe says.
'Not true' that US spends more than China and Russia combined, Inhofe says, but doesn't explain why or how that is.
'You hear that on the TV everyday,' Inhofe says. 'First of all, they lie,' meaning China and Russia.
Interviewer: We spend more on defense than China and Russia combined.
But by 'everyone' I don't think Inhofe's including Democrats, who might also have a say in the Pentagon top line.
Everyone agrees military needs a minimum of 3-5 percent increase in defense spending over inflation, Inhofe says. $733B would be no growth, he says. Fact check: true.
Now on to the Q&amp;A portion of this Inhofe appearance ...
Inhofe warning against continuing resolutions, which is about as controversial as milk in coffee. Nobody wants CRs, especially the Pentagon, but they keep happening.
Inhofe calls for 3-5 percent increase over inflation for defense budget over next five years.
Inhofe now giving Trump credit for confirming a large number of judges. 'We probably have the best economy we have in my lifetime ... You have to acknowledge this guy is doing a great job,' he says.
'Every time I hear a tweet is coming out I cringe a little bit,' says Inhofe about Trump. He's a big backer of the president. Many people are Trump haters, he says.
'Don't trust the media,' Inhofe says.
*he
Inhofe says she spent over 2 hours with Trump, Pence and Bolton discussing FY20 defense spending this week. 'There is no strategic rationale for any cut,' he says. Trump has ordered a 5 percent cut.
'Remember how much he cut from defense,' Inhofe says of Obama. Note: Congress funds the military, and Congress passed Budget Control Act caps.
Defense funding needs to be predictable, Inhofe says. Read: No more CRs.
Inhofe touts his conservative bona fides but says he makes an exception for spending on defense.
Inhofe says much of the public doesn't understand security threats. 'A lot of the media out there is making them think we don't have any threats,' he says.
Inhofe wants to lift the Budget Control Act caps on defense spending. 'We are going to do that ... it would be easy,' Inhofe says. Just make sure everyone knows the #1 priority for US should be defense.
Priority 6. Last but not least, he says: Return to strategy-driven defense. Read: Provide more funding to the Pentagon so it doesn't have to worry about money.
'The big reform we always talk about is acquisition reform,' Inhofe says. Fact check: true.
Priority 5. Defense reform, get most from tax dollars.
4. Caring for service members.
Veiled mention of Adam Smith? Inhofe says some people argue wrongly that we should get rid of nuclear triad.
China also moving into Africa, says Inhofe, who has a long relationship with the continent. Calls the influence frightening.
'China is a real force,' Inhofe says. In the South China Sea, 'they are everywhere.' Islands with military equipment and bombs. Allies see US doing very little, he says, and wonder who's side they will be on.
Inhofe mentions Rand report earlier this year that warned the US might not win a war with Russia in the Baltics.
US been toying with updating nuclear arsenal since 1960's, Inhofe says, but hasn't done it and is falling behind.
Inhofe says Putin lies a lot and he doesn't believe the Russian president, but Putin has claimed he surpassed US in hypersonic tech.
Investment in space, cyber, electronic warfare, hypersonic weapons ...
China's Navy will surpass US in two years, Inhofe claims.
Inhofe says there is 'a little problem' with the Ford-class carriers, the elevators don't work and cannot move ordnance.
'We have no time to waste we have to restore America's military advantage,' Inhofe says. Fighters, bombers, Army long-range fires, ISR, larger Navy fleet ...
3. Modernization of the military.
Inhofe says the military was not a priority during 8 years of Obama admin and will need to take care of that. Note: Congress passed the BCA during that time, which has capped defense spending.
2. Rebuild military readiness. Inhofe mentions Army BCTs not being ready to deploy. F/A-18s not ready to fly.
'We've got to get out of this mindset of CRs,' he says.
1. Get National Defense Authorization done early, before the end of the fiscal year
Back to his 6 priorities ...
Inhofe mentions former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, says they weren't friends for some reason. But Hagel warned about declining military.
Inhofe quotes commission saying America near 'strategic insolvency.' 'Here is the bad part: he knew it, we saw it coming,' he says.
Now Inhofe talking up the bipartisanship of the Commission on the National Defense Strategy, which found US defense is in crisis.
Inhofe says he has 6 point program of priorities as Armed Services chairman, which he briefed to reporters previously.
Inhofe invoking John McCain and his beliefs about leading free world. Inhofe and McCain often did not see eye to eye.
Inhofe says Cold War with superpowers was a simpler time. Now much more complex.
Russia and China doing some things better than US, they have been busy, Inhofe says. NK, Iran, Islamist terrorists ...
'We've got some problems out there,' Inhofe says about world.
Inhofe dwelling on the post-WW II order underwritten by US.
Inhofe quotes George Marshall; 'peace can only be maintained by the strong'
Inhofe giving speech and Q&amp;A on need to fully resource the Pentagon after meeting with Trump this week at the White House to discuss it.
Happening now: Sen. Jim Inhofe gives first address as Armed Services chairman on the FY20 defense budget at Ft. McNair. He opposes the 5 percent cut proposed by Trump + the White House.

@wardcarroll @reporterjoe Maybe, but I think Dems would be happy to bask in the political glow of a strong military, if they can also cite a hike in domestic spending.
@wardcarroll @reporterjoe That would keep the defense budget relatively flat and give Hill GOP more leverage (not a two-front fight w/ WH + Dems)
@wardcarroll @reporterjoe But Trump may back off the 5 percent cut too + submit the Pentagon‚Äôs original $733B budget in Feb. Or something closer to it.
@wardcarroll @reporterjoe I think it‚Äôs very possible Dems will agree to a number above Trump‚Äôs $700B once they get non-defense concessions.
Leaving Dems to fight for parity of defense + non-defense $$.
Sen. Jim Inhofe plans to negate Dem advantage (provided by WH cut proposal) by removing cap on defense $$ only.
Trump undercut GOP bargaining power on FY20 defense $$ at the outset by announcing the 5% cut.
Trump‚Äôs 5% defense cut does two things:	1) Pits GOP hawks in Congress against White House 	2) Gives Dems chance to be heroes by raising defense spending (more $ means more $ for their non defense priorities)

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard making her argument that U.S. is protecting al Qaeda + terrorists in #Idlib by challenging Assad, Russia, Iran ... Karem calls Idlib a hornets nest of terrorists but caused by #Russia.
Karem + DOD are in a tough spot here. Bolton appears to have articulated a new #Syria policy against #Iran while the Pentagon is either not on board or out of the loop. At least those are the optics.
Karem appears to confirm operations against #Iran would not be authorized under existing AUMFs, says Bolton was making an analytical judgment.
Moulton grilling Karem about the disconnect between DOD mission being only to fight #ISIS and Bolton's statement that US troops won't leave until #Iran leaves.
Rep. Moulton: Does 9/11-era AUMF authorize force against #Iran?	Karem: Under none of those AUMFs are we envisioning operations against #Iran.
Brig. Gen. Scott Benedict, of the Joint Staff, echoes Karem and says the Pentagon is only focused only on ISIS in #Syria and not #Iran.
However, Karem says US military presence in #Syria has 'residual benefits' such as giving diplomats leverage and deterring other adversaries such as #Iran.
Karem tells House it should 'disaggregate' Bolton + admin policy on countering #Iran in #Syria from Pentagon mission. 'The object of our military operations is very squarely focused on the ISIS fight.'
DOD's Karem: #Russia has launched disinformation campaign to discredit US by flooding media w/ fake stories to sow doubt + confusion about realities in #Syria + hide its role in Assad murder and brutality.
Assistant Defense Secretary Karem's prepared statement: 'We assess that even after the defeat of its physical caliphate, ISIS remains stronger now than its predecessor ‚Äì al-Qaeda in Iraq ‚Äì was when the United States withdrew from Iraq in 2011.'
I believe he's referring to the terrorist forces that eventually evolved into #ISIS.
DOD's Robert Karem, testifying on #Syria strategy, says ISIS still stronger now than al Qaeda when US withdrew from #Iraq in 2011.
Moulton says 'clearly not the case' that Mattis + Bolton are on the 'same sheet of music' on #Syria strategy as the defense secretary has claimed.
Moulton cites Trump statements that US would leave #Syria 'very soon' and more recent statements by Haley, Bolton and Mattis indicating US will remain for now.
Rep. Seth Moulton, ranking Dem on subcommittee, says he is alarmed by disconnect between Trump + senior cabinet on #Syria.
Hearing will delve into John Bolton and Trump admin statements that U.S. will remain in #Syria until #Iran leaves, Hartzler says.
Rep. Hartzler opens House hearing on US #Syria strategy by pointing out DOD assessment that #ISIS is well-positioned to rebuild + could recapture lost territory.

Duncan Hunter‚Äôs statement on the indictment is very Trumpian.
Also this bit in Hunter statement alleging partisan bias on the part of authorities handling his case: "The obvious question is why would the Secret Service need three prosecutors at a fundraising event?  The answer is they are partisan prosecutors."
Duncan Hunter is defiant - statement on indictment claims 'witch hunt' and invokes Hillary Clinton.
"All the while, there has been a constant barrage of misinformation and salacious headlines in our media regarding this matter.  I purposely choose to remain silent, not to feed into this witch-hunt and trust the process."
More Hunter: "We are seeing this with President Trump; we are seeing this with my case.  This is evidenced by the fact that after two years of investigating, the Department of Justice decided to take this action right before my election."
Duncan Hunter statement: "The fact is that there is a culture operating within our Justice Department that is politically motivated. "
The treasurer questioned why Hunter spent $142 in campaign funds to get suit pants tailored. Hunter's response: "Lol. Men's warehouse was a possible semi-embarrassment that I had to let ride. I used the wrong card, then didn't want to explain the forced refund."
The campaign treasurer threatened to resign at least once, until Hunter agreed to tell his wife she couldn't use the campaign credit card (that didn't last, allegedly) ...
The treasurer repeatedly questioned Hunter about allegedly illegal campaign spending. Hunter replied "Yessir" at least twice and when pushed said the treasurer was "trying to create some kind of paper trail" on him ...
