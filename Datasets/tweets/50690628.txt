“You are valuable because of your differences,” says @BethBrooke_EY on the message she wanted to deliver to teens when she came out at @EY_People. #NGLCCGlobal
EY’s @BethBrooke_EY speaks to how @EY_People approaches protecting its employees in countries that don’t accept LGBTI identities. Some countries allow EY to adopt an advocacy model, while others force them to prioritize employee safety.
The evening's first #NGLCCGlobal features Beth Brooke-Marciniak (@BethBrooke_EY), Global Vice Chair of Public Policy at @EY_People and Luis Eduardo Salazar Muñoz (@lsalazarmunoz), Costa Rican Commissioner of LGBTI Matters. https://t.co/bwBnO59WmI

A special thanks to all of our sponsors, panelists, and presenters for the evening! Your shared expertise tonight has opened a dialogue on improving LGBTI business opportunities in Mexico. #NGLCCGlobal https://t.co/5LQ73inJQK
A clarifying point from the audience: the cost of LGB discrimination in Mexico is estimated at $18M, but that number is estimated to triple if transgender and non-binary people are included. Imagine that impact on a global scale. #NGLCCGlobal https://t.co/QsKJrNzJre
@rfermin of @FMELGBT describes a global study that showed that LGBTI discrimination costs not only Mexico, but also countries across the globe. #NGLCCGlobal

#NGLCCGlobal’s @PhilofDelphi recommends leaning on countries’ LGBTI Chambers of Commerce for support on the ground in reaching LGBTI entrepreneurs.
It’s a difficult situation, say our panelists. Reaching LGBTI entrepreneurs takes embassies, private sector, entrepreneurs, and governments in both the investor’s and the LGBTI entrepreneur’s countries working in tandem.
We’re now taking questions for the panel from a packed house! One question: How do we link interested investors to LGBTI entrepreneurs? https://t.co/S4dbpcq0b1
@IPProfEvans We look forward to having you join us @IPProfEvans!
“Supplier diversity is good for the entrepreneur... but it’s good for the corporates as well.” - @PhilofDelphi speaking to the mutual benefit of supplier diversity and educating global corporations and constituents on that benefit. #NGLCCGlobal
#NGLCCGlobal’s @PhilofDelphi speaks to the cycle of poverty that can befall LGBTI people facing discrimination and how organizations like NGLCC Global creating space for the LGBTI entrepreneur to thrive can break that cycle. https://t.co/YfD7CKi7IZ
Panelist @DrSNNyeck shares something that makes South Africa unique when compare to other African nations: LGBTI inclusion and non-discrimination enshrined in its constitution. https://t.co/B2l2zUEXFT
Panelist @DrSNNyeck elaborates on Ms. Kunene's point by providing examples from Nigeria and Cameroon on the cost of discrimination and asks what these countries give up as a result of their policies of discrimination against LGBTI people.
When asked how the @WorldBank approaches countries in Africa that may not accept LGBTI identities, Bongiwe Kunene, the Former Executive Director, shares that often these countries “don’t know what (they) are missing” in terms of economic growth through inclusion. #NGLCCGlobal https://t.co/d2IukuKkZO
Our final panelist, Dean Ebden is the executive director of South Africa's LGBTI chamber @lgbtiplus. He speaks to South Africa's protections and barriers for LGBTI businesses owners.
#NGLCCGlobal's own @PhilofDelphi continues the introductions by speaking to NGLCC Global's work to bring the public and private sectors together to support the LGBTI entrepreneur and the importance of growing a global network for the success of NGLCC Global.
Panelist @DrSNNyeck of @UvA_Amsterdam opens with remarks on tying procurement to economic prosperity for LGBTI people. #NGLCCGlobal
Bongiwe Kunene, the Former Executive Director for South Africa, Angola, and Nigeria at @worldbank, opens the discussion by tying the importance of safety for LGBTI people to LGBTI economic prosperity in South Africa. #NGLCCGlobal

@HoudartUN Panelist and human rights lawyer @saltschuller adds: Companies have an expectation to act in accordance with human rights, and companies need to be engaged by stakeholders to bring their existing human rights policies in line with support for LGBTI rights.
Many companies are afraid to support LGBTI people publically, says @HoudartUN.

@PhilofDelphi The issue with LGBTI inclusive standards like the ones laid out by @unfoundation and @HoudartUN, adds @PhilofDelphi, is in the implementation and monitoring. Anti-discrimination is complex and a nebulous problem to address.

Some great answers from our panel: leverage ERG members as company ambassadors, ensure procurement teams work with ERGs to understand relevant issues, and train and actively include LGBTBEs.
A question from the audience to our Corporate Advisory Council: how can we leverage ERGs to enhance supplier diversity?
Some questions our ERGs are struggling with:	- How do we turn ERG members into advocates in other parts of the company?	- How do we recognize intersectional identities?	- How do we promote continued ERG engagement?	- How do we empower employees?
Some ERG best practices from our panel:	1. Celebrate intersectionality and include multiple identities.	2. Turn executives into champions of inclusion in your company.	3. Provide opportunities for local employees to engage in national initiatives and support the company's goals
@ATT @Target @verizon Eliminating ERGs in favor of more broad "Inclusion Councils" can encourage would-be ERG members to problem solve across diverse groups rather than in isolation, but ERGs still provide value for diverse employees.
We’re shifting now to a panel discussion on ERGs: are they still relevant and what are best practices for supporting ERGs? We hear from representatives from @ATT, @Target, and @Verizon. https://t.co/V01YivykvD

Ambassador @jmaloten takes the stage to assert the universality of LGBTI human rights. https://t.co/Dw8xICYLtQ
“We have to find that data that brings the public sector and the private sector into harmony,” says @NGLCCJustin on #LGBTInclusion https://t.co/T644PCbjCK

Lack of inclusion affects worker productivity, a business's profits, and on a larger scale, a country's GDP and economic growth. #LGBTInclusion
“How do we ensure that decision makers understand the value of inclusion and equality?” asks @NGLCCJustin. https://t.co/6S2o7QRsoQ
LGBT business owners have an "$1.7 trillion dollar impact on the US economy." - says @NGLCCJustin, larger than the economies of most countries.
@NGLCCJustin If you haven't seen it already, check out NGLCC's report on the economic contributions of LGBT people. https://t.co/tp0S5rGbzy
NGLCC President @NGLCCJustin opens our discussion with remarks on the importance of filling data gaps when it comes to measuring LGBTI economic contribution. #LGBTInclusion https://t.co/GRFEj4KNp0
We’re beginning our second night of our Global LGBTI Business Week with a discussion on using data in LGBTI-inclusive development. Opening remarks from NGLCC Global Director @PhilofDelphi. https://t.co/g8bBLa6hL9

Thank you to each of our panelists - @angelicaross, @GaryGoldman, and @maggie8uy - as well as moderator @afshop and presenting sponsor @Accenture for a great start to Global LGBTI Business Week! #LGBTInclusion https://t.co/oY5mUIfh0u
Moderator @afshop adds that putting the pressure on companies like @YouTube and @amazon to protect LGBT users' data and discourage anti-LGBT hate speech can critically influence the future of the digital safety of LGBT people.
@GaryGoldman echoes @angelicaross's sentiment: LGBT-inclusive stories and media representation matter!
@angelicaross recommends using @YouTube and other storytelling methods to bridge the gaps between these communities.
Audience question #3: how can we create meaningful digital connections between LGBTI people and heterosexual people who may not know an LGBTI person personally? #LGBTInclusion https://t.co/28QN6BKVUf
Speaking personally, @angelicaross talking about the steps she had to take to protect herself from harassment including changing her address to a PO box and using aliases online.
Speaking from the side of a website owner, @maggie8uy adds that the importance of good website security management and turning your users into collaborators can improve user safety. #LGBTInclusion
@GaryGoldman says there is no simple solution, but encourages the use of secure apps and following digital safety guidelines.
Audience question #2: What can organizations do to provide security for LGBT people and help amplify global LGBT communities’ voices that might be otherwise silenced? https://t.co/OFN5UoEDUW
Panelists @GaryGoldman and @maggie8uy agree! Using personal stories and case studies to educate is critical to shifting false narratives about the LGBT community. #LGBTInclusion
Panelist @angelicaross says that we need to create narratives that include heterosexual people and address reality as it is.
Audience question #1: what can organizations do digitally to combat false anti-LGBT information on the Internet? #LGBTInclusion https://t.co/pWRZZ5xM7q
"Uruguay has more Wifi access than anywhere else in Latin America," says @maggie8uy of a policy which can help give equal access to tech jobs and the tech community.
Panelist @GaryGoldman adds that employers need to practice what they preach and hire women, POC, and queer people in tech. Big tech employers "need to get these people in the door."
@afshop Panelist @angelicaross says that picking the right partners is critical. Pursue partners taking measurable action while creating the space for the people who actually need the service you're providing.
Moderator @afshop asks: “What can we do to help guide underrepresented groups to access technology?” https://t.co/NRWr7WIXaM
@angelicaross "Case studies and visibility is really what matters" - @GaryGoldman says on the global LGBT community &amp; technology
“The world is flat when it comes to technology and data.” - @angelicaross, on data giving a realistic picture of LGBT communities in other countries. https://t.co/8yC7iPeNds
@maggie8uy @GPSGAY "We wanted to do something meaningful for us, for our community." - @maggie8uy, on why she and her wife decided to move beyond web design into creating the popular website @GPSGAY. #LGBTInclusion
Panelist @maggie8uy, an entrepreneur originally from Uruguay, speaks about founding @GPSGAY, an LGBT social networking app that protects users privacy. https://t.co/WxGXsijn3b
Panelist @GaryGoldman started @OutInTech through an email for queer techies to gather at a bar for drinks! #LGBTInclusion https://t.co/PSznAJ4OAY
@angelicaross @TransTechSocial "I want you to step out of advocacy, put down your armor, and pursue your dreams. And from that place, advocate." - @angelicaross
