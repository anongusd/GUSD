5. If alternative plans are brought forward then I'd be happy to discuss these. But I would not support any proposal that is detrimental to historic public access to our bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.		Read more in the @LennoxHerald👇		https://t.co/S9GUyNWaYd
4. Whilst I'd prefer a decision to be made sooner rather than later, this is a substantial application and it's right that time is given for the impact of the proposal to be fully considered.
3. I submitted a formal objection to the initial plans. And having met with representatives of Flamingo Land, I remain opposed to the development as it stands.
2. I'm opposed to any development that would detract from the natural environment here. I have concerns about the #FlamingoLand proposal, not least due to the loss and disruption of several hectares of local ancient woodland.
1. Loch Lomond is an area of outstanding natural beauty right on our doorstep in #WestDunbartonshire. I'm open-minded about proposed improvements to the site in Balloch, but the views of local residents must always be fully taken into account.

I’ve already brought this case up in @HouseofCommons on several occasions — we can’t allow our democracy to be undermined by those who seek to launder Dark Money through it
So we know @Conservatives have no problem with taking money from #Kremlin cronies: so what is there in these Dark Money donations that they don’t want us to know about? What did @RuthDavidsonMSP know, and when did she know it? https://t.co/g7QBn8KMrB
So we’ve got @ScotTories beginning to use a funding arrangement explicitly designed to obscure donations when Richard Cook is their chairman, 1 he then goes on to use to fund a #Brexit campaign in a way that even Jim Murphy says ‘stinks to high heaven’ 🤔 https://t.co/7ItpPBsFm4
It’s no wonder that you’ve probably not heard of of Richard Cook: but he’s a former Vice Chair of @ScotTories and candidate in East Ren. He’s got business interests in #Pakistan, #Ukraine and with the former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, as you do https://t.co/W5YXrAOxY7
