@bettywolpert That should say $1 bil...my apologies.
@bettywolpert Keeping the lake even ~6 inches lower is approx. equivalent to the entire southern storage reservoir, which costs over $1 tril.  We don't need to drain the lake to make a huge difference w/o costing any more money.  We can find a sweet spot that protects water users &amp; coasts.
@bettywolpert Lake O can be kept lower in dry season to prevent need to discharge during wet season. Ex. Caloosahatchee NEEDED more water this winter but was denied water by ACOE so lake would stay artificially high for other uses. This increases risk of dike failure &amp; causes toxic discharges.

With this manufactured crisis behind us, we need to get back to work—fix the broken system, stop governing from crisis to crisis, get our country’s finances back on track, cut wasteful spending &amp; do what we were sent here to do: put power back in the hands of the people. 3/3
The fact that a minority of Senators were able to hold the government hostage for 3 days—&amp; make no real changes to the bill—shows just how broken the system really is. Sadly far too many people in DC remain more interested in helping themselves than the people they represent. 2/3
I’m relieved to say that the government is going to be back open, but this was an entirely avoidable crisis.  The bill passed today by the Senate is fundamentally the same as the one the House passed last week.  1/3
@danspacesmith What exactly in the bill the House passed do you or the Democrats in the Senate disagree with?  I was under the impression they wanted to fund CHIP and our government.
@danspacesmith The House passed appropriations bills and a long-term extensions for CHIP months ago.  The Senate hasn't acted yet because they haven't been able to get 60 votes.  If we're going to get this job done, we're going to need members of both parties to vote to re-open the government.
@kcolburn67 Pointing fingers and assigning blame doesn't get us anywhere - we need to get the job done and the only way to do that right now is getting 60 votes in the Senate where neither party has enough votes to pass a bill without the support of the other party.
Update on day 3 of a completely avoidable shutdown. Gov being held hostage by minority of Members putting politics ahead of the people they represent. We took an oath to support &amp; defend the Constitution. It’s about time Congress acted like it. Watch: https://t.co/dQDDsFKlbu
@spinfreehistory Not in this to make a name for myself, but I do believe the memo should be released and I'll be doing what I can to get it released.
@nebraskadem Agree. That's why I've four times to do that.
@droosien I agree we need to reauthorize CHIP. That's why I've voted four times to do so.  Sadly, the Senate didn't have the votes to reach the necessary 60 vote threshold needed to pass a long-term extension. Same problem they are having now.
My thoughts on this completely avoidable government shutdown... https://t.co/IeuDgsN4wt
Tonight we passed a solution to keep gov open &amp; extend CHIP for 6 years. I'm hopeful tomorrow the Senate will put aside partisan games &amp; do what's in best interest of the millions of children who rely on CHIP funding for their healthcare &amp; all those who rely on gov services. https://t.co/yyb5WPjLvf

As DOI works to finalize their plan, I will do everything I can to convince them to change their mind &amp; prevent drilling off the Florida coast.
Today’s announcement that DOI intends to open up drilling off Florida coast is extremely alarming &amp; unacceptable.  Moving forward, Secretary Zinke has indicated states will have voice in process.  Our voice has been clear from start: we will not tolerate drilling near our coast.
Oil drilling off coast of Florida puts our economy, environment &amp; marine life at risk.  That’s why I’ve long opposed drilling off our coast &amp; have been working closely with my Florida colleagues on both sides of aisle to extend prohibition on drilling off the coast of Florida.
