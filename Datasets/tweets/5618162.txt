@lsmisemer @wakelet That makes sense. So, pondering. Embedded threading is actually pushed from Twitter as a default, so tricky to undo. If Wakelet can, what if they offered control of that aspect of the display to both the creator and viewer? I hate to take it away from folk with disabilities.

@lsmisemer @wakelet I've done both. For one recent collection, I added text inserts to guide people along the path. I captured more info than most folk wanted, so it was important to help them not get lost. Really, I should have made a copy of the first Wakelet, and cropped it for easy viewing.
@lsmisemer @wakelet I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to use Wakelet collaboratively, which I haven't tried out yet. I could certainly see having students collaborate on building a collection!
@lsmisemer @wakelet Ah, there were so many things I wanted Storify to do that they wouldn't even discuss. Wakelet has listened, and added many of the features Storify refused to consider. I haven't found anything I could do in Storify that I can't do in Wakelet.
@lsmisemer @wakelet Intrigued. I used Storify a LOT, &gt;400 at close, plus using it to track friends' work, and never saw anything like what you describe. Unable to visualize. Unless you mean simply manually ordering the tweets by concept instead of time, which I've done, but it takes extra time.

@lsmisemer @wakelet Sounds like the tool we're dreaming of doesn't exist yet ... Me, the big thing that I detest about ALL the tools like this is the infinite scroll, with its bounce and wait and memory hog behavior.
@lsmisemer @wakelet I never saw anything like that! Fascinating! Do you have any screenshots showing how this worked? I ended up using mind mapping tools for this, but it's a lot more work, as each link has to be added individually.
@lsmisemer @wakelet I can see how that could be frustrating for someone who is smart, sharp, and has a good memory. Or for people who function best in non-linear modalities. At the same time, for people who prefer linear information flow, or w/ cognitive/learning challenges, context is helpful :)
@lsmisemer @wakelet I think you are using "thread" to indicate conversational lines, rather than single-author content created sequentially (which is how thread is beginning to be used).
@lsmisemer @wakelet Threading has been a problem for ALL Twitter aggregation tools. I tried in this Wakelet to include conversational content that did not use the hashtag, which is tricky. This weekend, I also saw significant pushback against apps like ThreadReader which specifically capture threads
@lsmisemer @wakelet Good point. Personally, I like that feature, as it helps me orient to the flow. Perhaps if this was made an option rather than requirement, that should be on the viewer-end, rather than the compiler-end?

@redcrew Hunh. Sigh. The problem with that is that I can read them in the moment, but I can't find them again. And Twitter search makes it super super difficult to re-find things even a couple of days afterwards. I've also found Twitter sometimes won't show things that are still there. :(
