#releasethevisas  The H-2B program is good for America and should be made more usable and reliable. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen should immediately release all of the additional visas authorized by Congress. #saveh2b @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen https://t.co/94f7L0rnNb
#Releasethevisas @realDonaldTrump devastating news this is awful news,  I moved from Pittsburgh I feel for this company.
