@casserolexoxo He said there is a number on all the machines that students can call. That way they know which machine(s) have a problem.
@casserolexoxo I spoke to our Housing staff last night. They're going to check out the Marshall Hall washing machines today.
@casserolexoxo We'll notify Housing &amp; Residence Life staff right away. We know how frustrating that is. We'll try to get them fixed ASAP!
An update on a Towson University hate/bias investigation that was first reported on last Thursday, Nov. 10. https://t.co/ajMJM59mbR
@casserolexoxo Where are the washing machines that aren't working? What building?
@jsmith5511 As to whether there will be any comment after the court proceedings are concluded, we'll make that decision at that time.
@jsmith5511 Acts of violence are a violation of TU's code of student conduct and are not tolerated or condoned.
@jsmith5511 It was not appropriate for the university to discuss "what happened and when" once charges were filed and a court date was set.
@jsmith5511 Both of the persons who were involved in the Nov. 1 Glen Garage incident are current students.
@jsmith5511 Yes sir, that is correct.
@jsmith5511 Just to be clear, there were no "guests" involved. Both of the persons involved are current TU students. And no one was injured.
@jsmith5511 No. Very different situation. A student was arrested &amp; charged the same day it happened, so no need for a campus notification.
@aaymaddie_ We felt it was important to set the record straight and explain what happened and when.
