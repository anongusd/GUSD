It's worth noting that the troops' contributions were what made the song so popular in the first place — that, and the stirring melody of the original hymn. https://t.co/yXkzAtZaBg
Howe's minister pushed her to rewrite the song the soldiers were singing. Reborn as "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," Howe's version is the one we know best today.
"John Brown's Body" became super-popular among Union soldiers, and a few years after, a poet named Julia Ward Howe and her minister visited Union troops. As they did so, Confederates attacked — but the Union soldiers defended, and impressed Howe.
Though their impromptu rewrite was inspired by a regular soldier, the ghost of the abolitionist loomed large — and a marching song called "John Brown's Body" was born.
Soldiers were making up new lyrics to the tune of an old hymn, "Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us," Harvard professor John Stauffer says. https://t.co/yXkzAtZaBg

Ross said that he believes the cost of this last-minute change to the 2020 census would not be significant and has been factored into updated cost estimates.
In a Jan. 19 internal memo prepared for Ross, the Census Bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, wrote that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census "is very costly, harms the quality of the census count."
On Friday, the Commerce Department released 1,320 pages of internal memos, emails and other documents related to Ross's decision as part of the lawsuits against the citizenship question.
Ross said the driving force behind the question is the need for more accurate citizenship data. Critics of the question — more than two dozen states and cities — are skeptical. They are concerned that the question will discourage noncitizens from participating.

Here are two Democratic Senate primaries that are worth watching: Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Robert Menendez.		Both face Democratic challengers, though in both cases, the incumbents are expected to prevail.
In Alabama, several Republicans are challenging Gov. Kay Ivey, who succeeded Gov. Robert Bently after he resigned. Democrats have seen more energy than usual in the solidly red state following Sen. Doug Jones' victory.
In Iowa, several Democrats are competing to take on Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds this fall. Iowa Democrats have seen their power and relevance wane in recent years, and are hoping to claw their way back into power in 2018.
California Republicans have their own top-two fears in statewide races. There's a realistic possibility that Democrats' substantial statewide voter registration edge over the GOP will lead to Democrat-vs-Democrat ballots in races against Sen. Diane Feinstein and Gov. Jerry Brown.
Many of these Southern California districts are crowded with Democratic candidates, and since in California the top-two primary candidates make the ballot, Democrats are worried that a large field could spread their party's votes, @scottdetrow reports.

Former assistant U.S. attorney Kim Wehle spoke with @rachelnpr about Michael Cohen's attempt to limit the materials prosecutors can access after. https://t.co/tuIfQpNeiV https://t.co/LBmH3j2fFg
Prosecutors argued that allowing the subject of a search warrant the ability to review what was seized before investigators can defeats its purpose.
Trump's attorneys argue that he and Cohen should not have to rely on the government's "clean team" to review the documents to protect his privilege.
Prosecutors depend on the "clean team" to segregate evidence and divide that which might become part of a court case from that shielded by attorney-client privilege.
The Justice Department's has an independent team — a "clean team" or a "filter team" separate from the prosecutors and investigators looking into Cohen — to review the material.
