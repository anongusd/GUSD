@GiGiNor @peterdaou Since he refuses to take PAC money there is no chance he took laundered russian donations like trump did from NRA; what do yiu csll it when HRC uses foundation money from the middle east?

@randreynolds @peterdaou Deny him what exactly? Hes got a fundraising apparatus bigger and better than OFA; he set a new first day donation record by raising $6M in the first 24 hours with an average $27 donation. He refuses PAC$$.  He brings new voters to the party. He‚Äôs the Dem Outreach Chair.

@blueherring32 @LizardRumsfeld Well thats an interesting take on it - mine was that he was decrying the hyperpartisanship and rank complacency that‚Äôs run rampant in our politics and our culture.
