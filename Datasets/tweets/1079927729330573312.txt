@Forbes Forbes obviously doesn't understand odds. The +200 line on Trump re-election imply he has a 33% probability of re-election. Forbes is mathematically illiterate.
@NTarnopolsky So both of Netanyahu's character witnesses are friends of Jeffrey Epstein.
@Lollardfish @DineshDSouza Palestinians already know that.
@KoominCider @Forbes The moneyline odds for Trump winning the general election are +200. To be clear, this implies Trump has a 33% probability of winning re-election and a 67% probability of not winning re-election.
@KoominCider @Forbes He is not expected to win. He has less than a 50% chance of winning, although his odds are better than any *individual* Dem.  Stated another way, using the +200 moneyline, Trump has a 33% chance of winning and the yet-to-be-decided Democrat has a 67% chance.
@Forbes Just because Trump has better odds than any other candidate does not mean he is expected to win.  Oddsmakers do not expect him to win.
@Forbes "The odds makers are right. Trump will probably be reelected if he chooses to run." This is not what the odds say. The moneyline is+200 for Trump, which is an implied probability of reelection of 33%.  Is Forbes mathematically illiterate?

@EmilyRu64514701 @BruceBice @dbongino My comment isn't about politics.  It's about interpreting odds. @dbongino is misinterpreting the bookmaker odds.  Bookmakers do not expect Trump to win.  Bookmakers give him 3-2 odds, which is less than a 50% chance.
@mtracey Sex trafficking victims are not consenting.
@BruceBice @EmilyRu64514701 @dbongino I don't know any specific odds, but I would be happy to tell you if a stated odds represents a probability greater or less than 50% because @dbongino and his followers seem to be clueless on how to interpret odds.
@EmilyRu64514701 @dbongino They aren't my odds. They are odds from bookmakers that @dbongino is misrepresenting. They do not show Trump winning reelection.  The odds show him being defeated.  I sincerely doubt @bongino is intentionally misrepresenting the odds.  I think he's just doesn't understand them.
@EmilyRu64514701 @dbongino The 3-2 odds indicate Trump has a 40% re-election probability. His approval rating is irrelevant.
@dbongino Wut? These odds show Trump with less than 50 percent chance of getting reelected. He is favored to lose. But he has a better odds of winning than any other candidate. But still less than 50 percent.
