New opioid use after hospitalization is common among Medicare beneficiaries. Use of opioids during &amp; shortly after hospitalization is warranted in many clinical settings, for example, in patients with orthopedic injuries &amp; those undergoing surgery. #SHRM #SHRMHC
More employers expected to provide coverage for treatment of behavioral health issues through #Telemedicine for convenience &amp; to improve access to mental health specialists that might not be available locally for in-person consultations. #SHRM #SHRMHC
Today, 25% of employers provide coverage for treating behavioral health issues via #Telemedicine Another 46% are planning to or considering it over the next three years. #SHRM #SHRMHC
Beyond cost savings, employers can also look to #Telemedicine to improve employee productivity and reduce absenteeism. #SHRM #SHRMHC
According to @SHRM_Research there has been an 11% point increase over past year in the prevalence of #Telemedicine as an employee benefit‚Äîoffering diagnosis, treatment or prescriptions provided by phone or video (34%) this is an increase from 2016 (23%) #SHRM #SHRMHC
With increasing health care costs, employers are pursuing an array of approaches. Key employer priorities over next 3 yrs include #Telemedicine for office visits ‚Äî 78% of employers currently use these consultations w another 16% planning to or considering by 2019. #SHRM #SHRMHC
