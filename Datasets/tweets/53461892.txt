Really hope #KimExposedTaylorParty doesn't help renormalize sexist lyrics. Yes, Taylor lied. But let's not miss the forest for the trees.
@conorjwhite Haha
@conorjwhite I don't know what I don't know, but he. did. not. make. her. famous. When there's proof she approved that line, we'll talk.
@Victor_Hugo_GP1 I get everybody's point of view, but this is all based on a sexist song lyric, let's not forget.
@conorjwhite The misogynistic message is, "I made that bitch famous." That's a sexist claim. The actual sex part is just his imagination.
@Steeven_Hyde Our standards are too high for women and too low for men. Here we are blaming Taylor for Kayne's ego.
@conorjwhite But the lyric she's denying she approved is, "I made that bitch famous," right? (Wildly inaccurate and misogynistic.)
Taylor did play the victim after #Famous, but Kim's snaps don't show Kanye saying he would call her "that bitch." To me, it's a wash.
