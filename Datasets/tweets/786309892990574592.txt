6.  The stated motives of these Terrorists is a recitation of the message flowing like sewage from the White House, Fox News, Judicial Watch, Mark Levine, Limbaugh and Gingrich.  It is not accidental and it is not coincidental. It is the deadly and inevitable consequence of Trump
5. Plot  in American history and gunned down 11 Americans at a Temple in Pittsburgh. They have been radicalized by the contagious poison of an American President and his Fellow travelers.  The hour of pretending there is no causation between the rhetoric and the violence is over
4. Now we see the terrible cost of Trumpism. The lies, conspiracy theories, coded racist and anti Semitic language, intimations of violence and declarations that opponents are enemies of the state and people have activated the evil people who attempted the largest assassination
3. America’s southern border. The intent is as malignant as it is purposeful. There is only one goal and that is to create a frenzy of craziness before an election where the American people will have their first opportunity to repudiate the vile and filthy regime led by Trump.
2. It finds its intended targets. Among them are the feeble minded, sick and racist. It’s singular purpose is incitement and it is working. A migration of poor and desperate human souls has been turned into an invading army; a Panzer division about to crash through

6.  An assasin. He would do what had to  be done to enemies of the people. He would kill them by mailing bombs to them. All of them. All of Trumps enemies. He launched a massive assassination plot and tried to kill 2 former Presidents and many more. It was not enough
5. And so they were his. He would strike at the traitors, the enemies  of the people. Trump winked at the violence. He knew Trump was right. There were good people on both sides in Charlottesville. The country was soon to be invaded by the Caravan .  He decided to become
4. Kavanaugh and the Caravan it was the Sayocs of the world he was talking to.  Trump ignited a passion in him to serve. He decided to be a soldier and a terrorist and strike back against the enemies, criminals and saboteurs who were stealing America.  They were Trumps enemies
3. They were not lies though. Objective reality crumbled in his mind. What was true was what his leader believed or said. That was enough. It was he , that the billion dollar anger and propaganda industry was targeting. When Gingrich smirked into the camera that it was all about
2. were stealing his entitlement.  He fell in line behind his avenger, a dime store Mussolini who assaults the institutions of our country, divides the American people, demagogues every issue, emboldens white supremacists and lies thousands of times a year.

No journalist or commentator should be intimidated from making this point. The stoking of hatred and sundering of the American people was always going to lead to terrible consequences. Chief amongst them would be the initiation of partisan or sectarian violence within our country
The targets are political not coincidental. Trump, the greatest demagogue in American history has celebrated violence over and over again. It looks like someone finally took Trump both literally and seriously. The WH will feign outrage when this obvious point is made.
Trump has stoked a cold civil war in this Country.  His rallies brim with menace and he has labeled journalists as enemies of the people. That someone would seek to kill their political enemies is not aberrational but rather the inevitable consequence of Trumps incitement.

@CalebHowe @TheRickWilson So obviously it would make sense for someone falsely accused about something they emphatically deny to ask that the FBI investigate all relevant information around the accusation for the purposes of demonstrating that you have nothing to hide and are telling the truth
@EmilyAnthes Should have said most people
@CalebHowe @TheRickWilson Your intellectual dishonesty and vapidity is only surpassed by your ignorance of the FBI background check process. The FBI investigation would not be criminal.  It would reopen the background check that all senior appointees submit to as a condition of their appointment.

Ed Whalen will find his way to acknowledging the grievous wrong and serious error of judgement that he made in the smearing of a middle school teacher who deserved better than to be involved in this disgusting process.  The Ed Whalen I knew  once rode far above this low road .
Of a broader discreditation strategy. No one should presume that Kavanaugh had any knowledge of the premeditated strategy being executed on his behalf. However, if he did, it utterly and irrevocably disqualifies him as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. I hope
He is a brilliant, meticulous and serious lawyer. He is not a conspiracy nut. It is inconceivable to me that Whelan published that email without discussions, debate and assistance from the WH and GOP Senators and staff.  It is not the isolated musings of one man but rather part
When I ran the Roberts and Alito confirmations  Ed Whalen was the singularly most important and effective outside advisor involved in the confirmation effort.  He knew every detail when it came to our strategy and everything he did was closely coordinated with the WH effort.
People drown because they panic, not because they can’t swim. The Whelan email is symptomatic of the utter panic consuming a nomination that hangs by the thinnest of threads and the looming spectacle of out of touch octogenarians like Orin Hatch interrogating Dr. Ford.
I’m thinking this might be why the Senators want to abdicate their duty and have a woman litigator question Dr. Ford. https://t.co/0DgtpPSK5J

@lakewizz It’s not a criminal investigation. It’s a background investigation.  The issue isn’t what happened in the room 36 years ago. No one who wasn’t there will ever know. The issue is who is lying now. Lying is disqualifying and the FBI will likely be able to shed light on that

It is a tragedy that few people beyond @benjaminwittes and @Susan_Hennessey talk about the most essential issue. The Supreme Court as an institution is being discredited by partisan politics. McConnell has guaranteed this seat will always be seen as illegitimate. https://t.co/z399YZW6wb
I believe the John Tower hearings set the precedent here.  New information was introduced late in the process that had not been uncovered in the FBI background check. The Chairman, Sam Nunn, immediately referred the matter to the FBI Director to reopen the back ground check.
Every Competent GOP strategist knows the optics of octogenarians like Grassley and Hatch interrogating Dr. Ford as if they were commanders from the Handmaids Tale will create an electoral disaster in Nov.  McConnell is first among them. Of course they don’t want her to testify https://t.co/vSR5855XhV

@KerryPicket Actually, I ran the last successful GOP race for Gov in the state of California. Probably in our life time. Now I’m going to follow Mark Twain’s advice “ Never argue with stupid people.  They will drag you down and beat you with the experience” Good bye
@KerryPicket Really bad. Because of people like you it’s now the third party in the state. Filled with kooks and cranks and utterly irrelevant. That is what Trumpism will do to the GOP
@KerryPicket You know nothing about me. We have never met. A bit presumptuous ? N’est pas ?
@KerryPicket In fact I was the American Association of Political Consultants campaign manager of the year (schwarzenneger.) plus pretty sure Bush and McCain would count and the NRCC.

@JayCostTWS It’s a tweet of someone who ran the alito and Roberts confirmations

Of people for a long time but like all cons the day always comes where the curtain is pulled back. My objection to them isn’t on the basis of a belief. It’s on the basis of how dishonest and full of shit they are
They built their political careers around the premise that they are tough and independent leaders who will defend Roe v Wade.  Turns out that was a con on the level of Trump University. In the end they will be the architects of the repeal of Roe v Wade. They conned a lot
The point about Colin’s and Murkowski’s impending vote for Kavanaugh exposes them as titanic frauds who have gamed the choice issue for their personal benefit for decades. Sincere people have committed points of view on this difficult issue. These two are not amongst them .

Worse because these cowards have chosen their tribe and personal ambitions over America and have failed their oaths to defend the Constitution.  They refuse to fulfill their oversight obligations as a coequal branch of government and have effectively obliterated the system of
The crisis is different than the emergency. There is a crisis of cowardice. The GOP majority are complicit quislings enthralled to a dime store Mussolini who they know is morally, intellectually and mentally unfit for his office. This crisis of cowardice is making the emergency
This National emergency has every potential to cause a disaster of immense proportions. Should that happen generations will look back with wonder that people didn’t proactively understand the causal effect of the emergency to the disaster. There is also a crisis in America.
Trump is vile, dishonest and corrupt. He is stoking a cold civil war in our land. He is assailing our institutions, traditions, alliances and is a party to the global regression of democracy. He is incompetent and mentally unfit. This is a national emergency.

John McCain belongs to the ages. He perfectly loved this country and served it with valor, courage and integrity for 60 years. He was a patriot and a hero and America will never see a political leader like him again. He was the greatest man I’ve ever known. Godspeed John McCain
This means Trump’s Presidency is not only illegitimate but criminal. It means a Presidential election was compromised by the most insidious criminal conspiracy in American History. It means Trump is a traitor and Putin determined the outcome. The impeachment bar has been reached https://t.co/xOTDd49DV8

So ..... was not the contempt that Peter Strzok demonstrated in his PRIVATE emails ( 0 evidence of ANY abuse of POWER) about Trumpism, Russia and the dishonesty of so many of our elected officials proven beyond a reasonable doubt today?  They have earned our contempt and disdain
The moral preening by Louis Gohmert is literally too much to take. By all means let’s line up the GOP conference and let wacky Louis walk the line and deliver his thunderous moral outrage one by one for each of his hypocritical colleagues.  What a joke.
I bet one gazillion dollars that if you took “ wack job “ Louis Gohmerts’, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan’s; Devin Nunes’ and name one other random Freedom Caucus member’s emails and made them public that Peter Strzok would come out better seven days a week and twice on Sunday.
Rallies, scapegoating vulnerable minority populations, alleging nefarious deep state conspiracies and creating a shared sense of victimization amongst an aggrieved population that can only be protected by the leader and his exercise of new and extraordinary power. Hope that helps
American ideals while simultaneously dishonoring and debasing his office and embarassing the country with every public utterance. He makes no pretense of leading the American people. He is the leader of a minority faction which he incites fervor in by constant lying at mass
Delusions, illusions or derangement over the vile leader you serve with slobbering sycophancy and dishonesty.  I am quite clear eyed about who and what he is. He is no friend of democracy and the US led liberal global order.  He fetishizes every autocrat he meets and undermines
Over the last 80 years but I doubt she ever conjured, even in her most fevered imaginings, that the dime store Mussolini standing in front of her could possibly be the President of the United States.  I hope this clears it up Boris. Oh by the way, please know I suffer neither
Of a Russian autocrat while attacking the Western Alliance , NATO and the European Union. She probably never imagined an American President could be so small, cruel, mean, ignorant, debased, dishonest and corrupt. She has met all of the great statesmen and women of the world
She has seen much of the history of the 20th century. She has witnessed triumph, sacrifice and great tragedy. She has met great leaders and bad one’s, Despots and Democrats but she probably could never have imagined an American President supplicating himself at the feet
Ladies and Gentlemen!  BORIS EPSHTEYN, Sinclair Broadcasting’s  leading local news propagandist. A real life Baghdad Bob for the Trump era.

The American people have watched an extraordinary clinic on the rot, decay, indecency, dishonesty and corruption of the TRUMP/GOP on live TV. The malice of most questions was only outdone by their stupidity, venality and dishonesty. May the stench of this disgrace long linger
Peter Strzok conducted himself with integrity and honor at this disgraceful kangaroo court star chamber. The conduct of the GOP majority is despicable, dishonest and dishonorable. Strzok has served America much more honorably than his mendacious harassers.
@RepKHandel WOW!  The hypocrisy of Karen Handel (Ga-6) is STUPEFYING!! Nasty, Arrogant and just plain dumb, all at the same time. Does she not understand the degree to which she indicted Trump and his administration on their fitness to handle classified information?
This hearing is a farce and a joke. No doubt the TRUMP propaganda/media axis will spin a magic tale turning these GOP loons, buffoons and grandstanders into some type of fearsome legion defending Trumps’ Army of victims from the deep state conspiracy and invading children
imagine it’s 1000 years from now and video of this hearing is the only surviving artifact of American civilization. Generations would study the idiocy, dishonesty, looniness, loathsomeness and bad faith of this GOP kangaroo court.  They are avatars of American decay and decline

The lives of many young men were profoundly devastated by the sexual abuse they were subjected to in the Ohio State wresting program. Jim Jordan’s lies and cowardice are another form of abuse against the victims. Looking forward to seeing his smirk get wiped off his face.
Reading the character testimonials about Jordan from McCarthy and Scalia is enough to make one vomit. It speaks to the utter corruption of the GOP majority.

Soon the world will see the remarkable spectacle of a servile and obedient American President lavishing praise on the Russian Autocrat as America’s allies inventory Trumps vandalism of essential western institutions
His ignorance, buffoonery and utter unpreparedness are on full display at the NATO summit. He has stained our national honor, humiliated America, disgraced his office and fueled the tide of rising autocracies with his imbecilic ravings.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”  These two men, of different parties were part of a continuum of American leadership that spanned nearly 80 years from FDR to Obama. Watching Trump degrade and sunder the western alliance isn’t just tragic, it is profoundly dangerous.
I’m thinking about John Kennedy speaking at the Berlin Wall, rallying and electrifying the free people of the world against Soviet Totalitarianism with his immortal line “ ICH BIN EIN BERLINER.” I’m thinking about Reagan, a generation later, on the same ground saying,
Jordan is going with the Sergeant Schultz “ I know nothing “ defense, for now. A dime gets you a dollar that this nonsense crumbles as fast as well ..... all the other nonsense that he spews . https://t.co/W8r5KNLsV7

Efficiency and metrics. I think we should demand excellence and efficiency in the delivery of all and any government service .  What do you think?
This includes a willingness to try and see if federal govt programs,  that I would have a tendency to view skeptically, could be engaged in the fix. I would insist though, that any spending of tax payer dollars for the type of programs we are discussing be accompanied by ruthless
There are more predatory pay day lenders in this country than there are Starbucks. Blue collar workers haven’t seen a real wage increase in 25 years. This is both immoral and wrong but also fundamentally destabilizing to our Republic.
If the outcome you seek can only be achieved with 75 percent tax rates then make the case. My criticism is around making promises that are unaffordable in the present system. 40 percent of the population doesn’t have $400 dollars cash available for an emergency .
While I disagree with the idea that Govt should do all of this I would never say that people who do are dishonest. What I termed “ dishonest progressivism” is the  notion that we can do all of these things by simply undoing Trumps tax cuts. We are in need of brutal honesty
Day care, Health Care, retirement, free college , guaranteed jobs, student loan forgiveness and meet the current entitlement obligations there is going to need to be a radical reimagining of our tax and govt revenue system.
Many progressives aligned behind a single payer proposal that was scored at 450 billion a year.  How is that any less dishonest than the nonsense that comes out of Trumps mouth. If the proposal is to give every American cradle to grave government benefits.
How do we pay for it all without bankrupting the country and beggaring the next generation.  I view this as a legitimate question worthy of honest debate. Here is an example. The state of California has an annual budget of $ 145 billion. It is the largest in the country.
Generally speaking I am opposed to a progressive agenda but acknowledge the legitimacy and seriousness of many of the policy ideas and I do not question the good intentions and motives of people supporting ideas under the progressive agenda. I have a serious question.
Let’s try and do something rare on twitter and have a civil and honest conversation ? Hope you are game. First, please watch what I said. I praised her.  I didn’t attack her. My attack was on what I called dishonest progressivism which is not an attack on progressivism. https://t.co/RCKDL6BrUp

@cenkuygur I’ll give an example of what I meant by “ dishonest progressivism “. Which isn’t an attack on well intentioned Progressives. California state budget is 145 billion a year all in. single payer proposal was 450 billion per  year. How is that real ? Or honest ?
@cenkuygur Which I opposed  because it added trillions to the debt and did nothing to increase wage growth. I’ve talked about the need to deal with unconscionable debt levels on millenials and the need for affordable education and training.
I promise this.Your complete intolerance for any criticism and illiberalism towards any point of view you don’t share is a gift beyond measure to the GOP majority and Trump. By all means attack and impose purity tests on all who disagree with your ideology but stand for democracy https://t.co/7N7W282aRS
Anthony Kennedy has ended his tenure on the Supreme Court by giving Trump the greatest political gift imaginable in 2018. GOP consultants are rejoicing right now. This is as big a political gift as the one Trump got from Comey in the final week of 16
@cenkuygur @MSNBC I didn’t attack her motives or her intentions. Your anger and intolerance and dishonesty are simply the mirror of Trump’s. You are as smug , arrogant and nasty as Stephen Miller and all the rest. You just wear a different Jersey.
@cenkuygur @MSNBC I actually praised her. I made a strategic point about Pie in the Sky promises with no thought given to how they are paid for. It was a broad indictment, not of progressivism which is an ideology I don’t share but of a policy dishonesty that helps Trump.

@clevertrope @NaveedAJamali How high ?
@MrRobotCodeBrkr @NaveedAJamali We could find a lot of space to compromise in here
@Bertiwooster111 @NaveedAJamali Agree
@NaveedAJamali Of course. When 40 percent don’t have $ 400 and there has been no wage growth in 25 years we have a problem big enough to stabilize our political system. My point isn’t to question the good  intentions of people who have a progressive solution it is to ask how can we pay for it
@KyleKulinski You make trump possible. Look in the mirror. You see trump staring back. ?
@NaveedAJamali I think we need a season of brutal honesty in politics. The country is careening towards 30 trillion in debt. Both sides are at fault. It’s a moral issue to me. How are you going to pay for it ? Is a legit question. If the answer is 70 % tax rates, make the case .

It wasn’t that CUBA and Venezuela are good. They aren’t. But they don’t have toddler internment camps. We do because of Trump.  That is sad
@DrZuhdiJasser @GOP That’s a pretty dumb attack n’est pas? bin Laden’s strategic goal was to precipitate a war of civilizations. Don’t you think Trumps anti -Muslim rhetoric and Muslim ban plays into that. He weakened our security and emboldened the extremists.
@mschlapp Matt , stop being dishonest. I said there are no baby internment camps in Venezuela and Cuba. Disagree ? Happy to debate the degeneracy of the conservative movement and your role in it any time. Maybe by radio when you are in a limo on the way to an MSNBC after party.

@ggreenwald Your diagnosis is made on the basis of omissions from my point. Lack of wage growth, rapid technological change and globalization have all played a part.  However, it is naive to believe that Putin has not in fact achieved his goal of undermining fidelity to our institutions
TRUMP disgraced the Presidency and the United States at the G-7 summit. From his slovenly appearance to his unpreparedness, ignorance  and arrogance, he beclowned himself. The Republican majority is filled with cowards who are servile supplicants to the most unfit POTUS ever
I think it’s time we give Vladimir Putin his due. He is clearly the greatest intelligence agent —ever .  He has engineered the unraveling of the western alliance, fidelity to democracy in the United States and the severing of the UK from the EU.  It’s a remarkable achievement
The battle lines are being drawn for the most important political fight of this generation.   Liberal Democracy is in retreat and decline around the world.  The post world war 2 US led liberal Global order is crumbling. It must be preserved
@davidaxelrod @POTUS It is past time to starting talking clearly about what is uncomfortable but clearly obvious.
It does if you consider the unthinkable. If he behaves like a Russian asset maybe it’s because he is one. https://t.co/Pb2wFsOdRP
I helped lead the Roberts and Alito nominations. Watching her get questioned at the Judiciary Committee hearings would be a clinic on incompetence. The greatest since whenever Trump last spoke https://t.co/FkZ9ZwwViu
@TheRickWilson LOL .
With regard to Ted Cruz’s demagoguery and his use of the military as a political prop I wonder what @sethmoulton might have to say. I’m thinking he might have a point of view about the ideas and ideals our flag represents
@TheRickWilson And just to prove Rick’s point about your stupidity, you should wrap your head around the fact that nearly a million Puerto Rican’s will be voting in the next Presidential election. These citizens used to live on their neglected island before they came to Florida
Those soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are the sentinels of American liberty and our Constitutional Republic. Cruz couldn’t muster the guts in 18 silent seconds to say Trump isn’t a king and can’t pardon himself. This is INCITEMENT politics. Demagoguery and dog whistles https://t.co/bhdi6q9klb

@AmazingDouglass He doesn’t
Today my 12 year old son and I had the great honor to meet a combat veteran of the 82nd Airborne who jumped on DDay. When my son is his age the day of days will be 157 years in the past.

@BruceMctague @TheOnion @webradius @MalcolmNance @MarkHertling @rickwtyler @TheRickWilson @pptsapper Wow. What a total Moron. That Harry Truman quote which is inscribed on the wall of our national WW2 Memorial has special meaning as Trump attacks our Allies and sunders our relationships
St Mere Eglise. 6 June 2018. The first village liberated in France 🇫🇷 by the brave men of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne division. https://t.co/0WVCxVbOiz
The American Cemetery. 6 June 2018. Each grave faces west towards  America. This silent Army at eternal rest looks back across the Ocean they did not return from. We must ponder our worthiness of their sacrifice. What contempt they must have looking down from heaven at Trump https://t.co/uKmcVRX48r
Juno Beach. 6 June 2018. This is where the heroic men of the Canadian 3rd Infantry division fought and died to save the world from slavery and darkness. Canadians are not threats.

Certainly one of America’s providential blessings is sharing the longest, peaceful, undefended border in the history of the world with our great ally CANADA 🇨🇦.

This interview is as outlandish as it is dangerous. The US Ambassador to Germany is taking a rooting interest in German domestic politics and seems to have a fetish for blood and soil European nationalists with autocratic impulses. Trumps’ America alone strategy will cost us https://t.co/Etr1M28Onf

@TheRickWilson @ElectSanePeople The Americans has concluded its’ brilliant run on FX with a finale that may be the greatest in TV history. It has cemented its place as one of the greatest TV series of all time. There will never be any debate about the stupidest show in tv history.  Fox n Friends has it locked

George Washington’s greatest legacy is that he was the first human being in thousands of years who could have been a King or Emperor and chose instead to be a President with limited Powers . We don’t have Kings in America. If we did, I’d much rather it be Elizabeth  than Trump
@POLITICOMag @joncoopertweets So .... translating this into Korean ...Kim Jong Un will keep his nukes and American forces will depart South Korea.
The American people will now get to watch a disgusting display of political cowardice as Paul Ryan  and all the rest line up behind Trumps assertion of absolute power like Vichy Sheep. Freedom is being attacked by the very people sworn to preserve it.
Sinclair Lewis said “ when fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross”.  Make no mistake about the intentions of the men making this argument. They are trying to radically change the nature of American democracy. Their arguments are unpatriotic
Any member of Congress that supports the legal thesis of the Trump letter is a friend of illiberalism and unfaithful to their constitutional oaths. There is no room for debate or disagreement here. Supporting this crazy theory is an assault on the Republic.
A clear line has been drawn with the release of Trumps legal memo. Make no mistake, it is a direct attack on the rule of law and a declaration of absolute power on the part of the President. It’s thesis must be attacked relentlessly. The American Republic is worth fighting for.
This is a great column from my friend Bob Shrum. It should be read by every person who stands against the vile winds of this mendacious and corrupt Presidency. America badly needs a candidate who inhabits the spirit of Robert Kennedy. Please read and watch the Netflix documentary https://t.co/YpRd7sawzU
@MSignorile On bender knee in a pose of cowardly submission to their leader. Fidelity to their oath and our flag is now subordinate to the Trump banner. It’s as despicable as it is cowardly
@SiochanaPMC No
Trump is hostile to American ideals ,the US led liberal global order, our Allies, the rule of law and the  very idea of liberal democracy. He is a coddler of authoritarian leaders and regimes. He is the greatest divider ever to be President
There is not enough discussion about Trumps use of mass rallies to incite his base.These rallies are fueled by lies, scapegoating, and communal victimization. Trumps lies require his followers to submit to a dystopian reality where truth is defined by what the leader says is true
Please take the time to read Andrew Sullivan’s brilliant piece about the crisis in liberal democracy. It is under siege and illiberal movements, parties and leaders are gaining strength. Trumps use of mass rallies to incite fervor with lie after lie is bad https://t.co/xdfuXSBPMC
@AshaRangappa_ $25 !!  That’s a lot. Are you sure that isn’t the price for the deep -deep or double deep state membership ?

We are entering the consequences stage of this imbecilic administration. There has been great suffering and death in Puerto Rico but soon the suffering will spread to every corner of this country because of Trumps ignorance and venality https://t.co/aXKHwBFqjn
Canada is the largest trading partner for 35 out of our 50 states. It’s #2 for most of the rest. It will be interesting to see how GOP Governors react to this stupidity.
159 Canadian Forces personnel have been killed in action in Afghanistan fighting side by side with Americans after our country was attacked on 9/11. That Trump would say CANADA is a security threat to America is as loathsome as it is stupid. Trump is doing tremendous damage
Thousands of our fellow Americans are dead in PuertoRico because of the total incompetence and ineptitude of this administration.  It is a national disgrace
Trump thinks Putin is his friend and that Canada is a national security threat. These policies are imbecilic
Trump is assaulting our closest allies with his reckless and profoundly stupid trade war. The American people will pay the price.
Looking forward to actually being on set with Nicolle. ! https://t.co/LUM1Lo0OPL
This sacred day of remembrance was defiled by Trump and his vulgar expressions of self interest. It is truly a disgrace. Trump processes no capacity for dignity.  None.  His unworthiness of the Presidency of the United States could not have been more clear today.

@CardinalDolan.  Your Eminence, when will the church and her Bishops condemn the immoral policy of separating mothers from their children on our southern border?  Is this immoral policy not an affront to the face of god ? Is it not worthy of condemnation from the church ?
“ Oh God I was a prisoner too-could not recognize the faces standing over me.  They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality...” BOB MARLEY.  Shameful that these words can be applied to ICE agents as the separate Moms from their children. This policy is a moral outrage

@DawneSurley Don’t give in.  Never give up. Get in the fight. We will not lose America to Trump.
The newly commissioned officers of the US Navy and USMC have received one of the worlds best educations at Annapolis. They have been meticulously trained to become selfless leaders with integrity, decency and courage. In other words to be the opposite of the disgraceful Trump
The separation of children from parents is something that happens in Gilead ( handmaids tale ) and Auschwitz. This is should not be happening in America. Disgusting
@KazmierskiR You are obviously a cruel and vicious person who has no sense of decency and no sense of American ideals. This policy of separation is profoundly immoral and Un-American.
News organizations should be covering this and showing the American people the evil that is being done in their name. That Uniformed govt agents with American flags on their shoulders are executing these immoral acts is atrocious. This should be opposed by every decent American
This policy is immoral and shameful. It is a disgrace that stains the soul of this nation. It is an injustice as profound as internment camps and the refusal to admit Jewish refugees into the country before WW2. https://t.co/s120tkJSSQ

@MollyJongFast @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Byron York is someone I’ve always liked interacting with.  I do believe he is being disingenuous here. There is nuance to our foreign policy in this part of the world because it is life and death. My point is Trump departed from the status quo in a stupid and self glorying way
@jonfavs At least we now know for certain the 18 dumbest members of Congress,  ( all GOP ) who nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. We should cross reference that list for Senate candidates ( Marsha Blackburn ) and make sure none of them go any higher
In the meantime we are diplomatically isolated from our European allies who are being threatened with sanctions by an administration that seems in lock step with the Kremlin policy of sundering the Atlantic alliance and EU. This is all about Nov 18 for Trump. Domestic politics.
War drums are beating in the Middle East. Iranian aggression is fomenting both a Shia Sunni civil war and a new alliance with the United States, Israel , Saudi Arabia, UAE  and other Sunni countries on one side and Russia, Iran , Syria, and other Shi’a nations on the other. 2.
Trump destabilized the Middle East with his decision to move the embassy.  His abject ignorance of the history and religions that have shaped this moment have given succor to the agents of terror and chaos. Trump destabilizes,  Hamas terrorists provoke, Israel responds. Repeat 1.
@CoeD1972 @lf092313 @electweissman1 @trawetsla When people who may be your allies against the lawlessness and vileness of this administration hear people fighting about the 40th President and disparaging a hero in their eyes their first instinct is to tell you to F off as opposed to how can we work together. Just a thought.
@CoeD1972 @lf092313 @electweissman1 @trawetsla When he died it was an enormous event in this country. He presided over a time where American confidence was restored,the economy grew for working people,  the Cold War was won and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were decommissioned. He represented the opposite of Trump. 2.
@CoeD1972 @lf092313 @electweissman1 @trawetsla The task is too urgent to argue about the Reagan Presidency. History will be the judge.  This is about politics and the following things are true.

@TeddyBklyn1 It is a regimental battle colors of a us army regiment .  It is from 1890. The pattern is medallion wreath. Wyoming statehood flag
Tomorrow more people will die in the Middle East because Trump ‘s ego.  The price of Trumpism is going to grow. It will include death and suffering and real economic harm for workers caught up in the stupidity of his stumble-bumble trade war.
It is beyond my comprehension that anybody could look at Pence with his practiced squint, Stepford wife gaze and oozing insincerity and think he is on the level.

@greenhousenyt @leonab1234 Corruption at an epic level
But then again Jared and Ivanka got to seem relevant and important and their ego’s were massaged, The RNC made Sheldon happy, Hypocritical theocrats think the rapture is closer and only 1300 people were shot at the cost of our being able to be an honest broker . Sounds like a win
This is a part of the world where a wrong word can get people killed. By definition if you don’t have a clearance it is not possible to have the necessary information to safely open your mouth as a spokesman for the United States. Again: this is why nepotism laws are a good idea
Kushner and Ivanka’s presence and public roles at this Jerusalem embassy opening are outlandish. They are Assistants to the President. They have no business and no rank to be speaking for the country at a geopolitical flash point. We don’t have Princes and princesses in America

@samstein Propaganda is harder than it seems
@PhilipRucker @KatyTurNBC Decency and indecency are in contest and conflict.Trump represents indecency and it is everywhere but so is basic decency. There are thousands of acts of kindness and decency taking place everyday. Just not in our Politics and certainly not in the TRUMP/GOP axis. Far from decided
@BillKristol Should honor be found there, it will be a most elusive quarry. A Sumatran Rhino, though rare in the wild, would for purposes of comparison, be nearly as abundant as the proverbial cats and rats scurrying about the West Wing putting the country —-well, I guess last.
@tripgabriel What’s a little fraud between Fake Universities. You to need to think about Devry and Trump U as the fraud version of football for Harvard/Yale or Army/Navy
One of the great blessings of the Roy Moore candidacy besides its crushing defeat was the exposure of Graham , Falwell , Robertson and 100 more as carnival barkers and frauds.  No one need ever pretend these conmen are on the level at any level ever again. They thirst for power
@ericlevai @kumailn perhaps you will be open to this as a persuasive argument.  Is not what John Mccain actually did do , enough? How do you want to be remembered ? By what you didn’t do? Where you fell short ? On the basis of others expectations? Plus here on these nuts he spoke early and often ?
@JRubinBlogger Take a look at the other nut preacher with him, Hagee. Virulently anti-catholic. Gingrich has always fancied himself a world historical figure. Maybe his diplomatic derring-do can prevent any blow up in relations with the Vatican. Behind the curtain of course
Wherever you see the fusion of religion with political power there ends up being less freedom.  In fact, this fusion is a hallmark of Autocracy. From Russia and the relationship between church/state to here, a hallmark of all these movements is a virulent hatred of Gay people . https://t.co/YUBCzpOyUZ
Jeffress and Hagee are both religious bigots, in fact theocratic nut jobs is the more apt description. Falwell jr, Franklin Graham et al....use religion to taste, for them, the sweet nectar of political power. They are in business...not for Christianity but money and power. https://t.co/YUBCzpOyUZ
@JanzforCongress @MichaelKotick I couldn’t think of a better way to start a Monday than by figuring out how to support devin Nunes OPPONENT with some money$
@Ali_H_Soufan America has shined a light to the world as a beacon of hope because of the power of the idea of freedom. Freedom shows anything is possible for anyone in this country. Lahren/waters engaged in one of the most Un American diatribes I have ever seen.##
@Ali_H_Soufan Much rather live in a country with a million Ali Soufan’s than with two mean spirited ignoramuses like Waters and Lahren who seem to know nothing about anything that really matters. Certainly they are ignorant of their country
@Ali_H_Soufan And hard work to lift people up , to create a better life, to fulfill the American dream. Waters and Lahren don’t know their country and they are harming her for fame and money and things that are bad and shouldn’t matter. Ali Soufan can to this country as an immigrant and I’d
@Ali_H_Soufan Everything to come here. We should have a smart immigration policy that makes it easy for the best and the brightest to study here and stay here. But we must never lose faith in the power of freedom to combine with the qualities of vision , ambition, perseverance, grit , valor 5.
@Ali_H_Soufan Again this has been proven. Each time a new citizen raises their hand and swears the oath the lifeblood of the nation is refreshed. America is not just a place where people live and things happen; it is an idea that is so powerful that people all over the world have risked 5.
@Ali_H_Soufan The story of the country is rooted in the miracles that have happened because of belief in the American ideal, the promise of America is rooted in the notion that if you embrace liberty and freedom that people can rise. There is no dream too big in this country and over and over4
@Ali_H_Soufan That over time has become closer but hasn’t been reached.  The story of the country is the fight to realize that idea and ideal through profound struggle and immense suffering. Any one can be an American if they believe in this idea and swear allegiance to the Constitution 3.
@Ali_H_Soufan America is a flawed nation made up of flawed people.  It is the only nation in the world founded on the power of an idea “ All men are created equal and endowed by the creator with inalienable rights which include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” It is a perfect idea 2
@Ali_H_Soufan Waters and Lahren are two nitwits broadcasting a cruel, mean, dishonest view of America. They are either profoundly ignorant or staggeringly corrupted. They are selling a vision of America that aligns with what are enemies have always said about us; that America isn’t special 1.

@Swopa It was part of the contest. It wasn’t connected to an illiberal assault on the first amendment. There is a material difference
There is a systematic effort underway by this administration to choke the 1st amendment. Every day,Trump and his axis of corruption seek to shield themselves from accountability by assaulting the free press. Today it was Nicolle’s turn. Tmrw someone else’s and maybe soon —your’s
That of course is a threat to this WH so by any means necessary this cabal will look to strike at people who hold them accountable in public.  This is such a case. The Crocodile tears and faux umbrage are predictable but yet, stunning. Positively Pence like in its fraudulence
4. This is propaganda. Period.  It is indistinguishable from what people would be subjected to in an autocratic country.The accumulation and constancy of Trumps’ lies is harming our country and our character. The truth is Nicolle Wallace has done nothing but be honest and real.
3. Of the most mendacious administration in US History is obscured in a fog of nonsense, grievance and the fiction of a conspiracy that never rests. No apology is owed to Sarah Sanders.  There is however an apology owed to the American people for the conduct of this feculent WH
2. It’s strategic purpose is to incite the most intense part of Trumps base to the ecstasy of collective victimhood. There is no greater achievement in Trumpistan than to wear the cloak of victimhood. Sarah Sanders role in the debasement of the country as the propaganda minister
1. It’s important to understand the deliberateness of the misinformation campaign being waged against Nicolle Wallace by Trump media after she used a common and benign idiom to express her dismay around the venality of Sarah Sanders responses to ?’s about this disgraceful WH
STOP THE GAS LIGHTING. THESE PEOPLE ARE PROFESSIONAL LIARS and VICTIMS. DONT BUY THE BS. IT IS URGENT THAT THIS IS UNDERSTOOD. Ps.  The Aunt Lydia joke was spot on and genius. It’s about the complicity in service of everything that is wrong in our land. https://t.co/d0zSjS8PUX
@EvanHandler @Iambjl @DiDi2009 @MichaelAvenatti I agree and missed that in the fray.
@AllisonMickey1 @JohnJHarwood @NicolleDWallace I have done my best to speak out against it for the last ten years. From birtherism to Limbaugh, Levin and Ingraham ect. I denounced Trump as far back as 12. I’ve talked about this for a long time
@jaricadavis @crkuhl @stabmarine He was a perfect fit within their billion dollar business of dividing the nation with rancid conspiracy theories and crack pot hosts that run down the rule of law, assault the US Justice Dept , FBI, Intelligence agencies and call for the jailing of political opponents.
For those that forgot. This is what decency looks like in a political leader. I was off stage. I was incredibly proud https://t.co/LPJHQdtFCb
@aravosis @NicolleDWallace @HeidiPrzybyla Defined as what is pleasing to the leaders narcissistic erogenous zones.  The Free press is essential to the American Press and Trump is inimically hostile to it even arguing that negative stories are fake and reporters should be jailed. This is Un American and fascistic
@aravosis @NicolleDWallace @HeidiPrzybyla Manipulate the English language, by changing the meaning of old fashioned sayings by autocratic diktat, to people who know full well the benign intent of the saying, then you are one giant step closer to our dime store Mussolini’s vision of an America where freedom of speech is 2
@aravosis @NicolleDWallace @HeidiPrzybyla There is a much broader point here.  This is another example of the illiberalism that surrounds Trump and his agents. If you can insist that the photo of the smaller crowd size is larger, redefine truth as what the leader believes, assign blame to dark conspiracies and  1.
@LeeanOhSee I have two daughters and think you are correct. I was thinking very specifically about my son because I had been talking to him about the Senator. I’ll do better
@truespartan01 @NicolleDWallace @HeidiPrzybyla It’s an expression in the English language. It’s a common saying and completely appropriate as a way of communicating unfathomable dismay about the inability of Sarah Sanders to communicate even the slightest scintilla of decency from that podium.
@NicolleDWallace @HeidiPrzybyla This attack on you is nonsense. Complete and total. We are watching in real time how the Trump media works. The criticism of you is dishonest, out of context and part of an ongoing misinformation campaign aimed at the american people. It is fueled by a sense of victimization. BS!
This a brilliant column that perfectly describes the vandals, quislings and lightweights that comprise the leadership of the Majority party in Washington. However I have one point of difference with my good friend Mike Lupica. It is my disputation with his final sentence. https://t.co/RLPvpNgEg0
@kumailn Like when he was outraged about the vile things said about his daughter Bridgette ?  I think you are being extremely unfair to John McCain. May I ask you to find and watch the video from late in the 08 campaign when Mccain is confronted with a bigoted question
@EvanHandler @DiDi2009 @MichaelAvenatti I guess my view and advice, which is worth what you pay for it, would be this. Elections are about the future and are always a choice. Looking forward is how you cross the finish line first. Arguing about elections past helps Trump
@HRC @mike_pence Lest we forget I’m sure he had the same faux sincerity etched on his face, with the practiced squint included, when he was schilling for the Cigarette companies. No doubt tobacco executives would recognize his Stepford wife gaze.

@RonaldKlain @BrunoAmato_1 Disgusting.
@PreetBharara @BrunoAmato_1 He is brilliant as a Stepford wife. Role of a lifetime for him.
@BrunoAmato_1 This is tradition. The commander in chief rotates through each Academy. Does all in the course of their term. Of course,  since irony is lost on Trump, the graduates and new officers have been trained to have the exact opposite values of their vile speaker and Cmdr in Chief .
@RoySekoff Thank you but I think I may have been imprecise. With time to reflect he may be more Stepford wife than anything else
@attackerman @LizMair This policy is immoral. Sounds like The Republic of Gilead not the United States. This disgraces and dishonors our country and that it is done by men in uniform with an American flag on the arm is tragic and evidence of the renewal we must choose or risk being less than we were
@PaulJacobsMedia @NicolleDWallace Thank you.
@AmericaFirstTV @MSNBC @DeadlineWH This is how it works. THE outrage machine of right wing propaganda is spinning up to attack Nicole Wallace for saying something she didn’t say. This is misinformation. A big lie.
@AmericaFirstTV @MSNBC @DeadlineWH Here is a case study in propaganda and misinformation that surrounds the Trump cabal in a cocoon of lies and nonsense. Nicolle used a figure of speech to describe Sanders stunning evasions and repugnant nonsense.  The Victim card is their specialty.  This is what state media is
This is the citation for the award of the Silver Star to Commander John Mccain.  This is real. This happened. Later he helped reconcile relations between our countries as a man of peace who knew war too well. Shame on John Kelly for tolerating this .  https://t.co/o9ZG080fiA

Why have no REPUBLICAN US SENATORS stepped forward and expressed their Absolute F’ing outrage about these attacks on AMERICAN HERO JOHN MCCAIN by a WH staffer?  It is despicable and the cowardice is nauseating.

@greenfield64 A candidate you once worked for tried to lift up this country at a moment of tumult.  He talked about a better politics and and he imagined things that never were but could be. Trumpism and idealism are at war.  Hopelessness and cynicism are the handmaidens of trumpism.
@chickiej1 Let’s promise to never forget it so we don’t ever repeat it.
We Americans are connected to each other through the generations. We have work to do and it is time to begin it. We should be happy that looking back from the end of our lives that we will have played a part in washing away the sewer that is this administration.
They have no shame. I pray a righteous rage and anger is swelling in the hearts of every decent person in this country around the desecration of our country and values by team Trump. Let us repudiate these terrible people. Let’s do it with joy and gratitude for the privilege. 3.
The putrid stench of this immoral, corrupt and indecent Trump WH will linger through the ages. Every single person who serves TRUMP POLITICALLY is part of a cabal that is harming America. At the hour of their deaths their legacy will be one of ignominy as despoilers of America.
Kelly Sadler, the WH Aide who joked about and revelled in joy  about the fact that John Mccain is approaching the hour that will come for us all is a disgrace. She is vile, cruel, and indecent.  She is a perfect fit for this loathsome cabal that is rotten from Trump down 1.

@coachbradshaw76 @louis_conan @garywingate US members of Congress weren’t the people nominating.
@dtheavenger “ The only thing we have to fear is fear itself “ FDR .  Fear is toxic and contagious. Push it away. Don’t fear Trump. Be resolved to fight back against all the indecency and all those who are complicit in the harm he is doing to the country
@coachbradshaw76 @louis_conan @garywingate Just like Chamberlin and Hitler did in 1938. “ peace is at hand” was the declaration. Today, 18 of our most profoundly stupid members of Congress have nominated Trump for a Noble Peace Prize for two Koreans shaking hands. Be hopeful but peace is not yet at hand.  Read some books
It’s important for Americans who are disgusted and feeling helpless about Trumps vile assaults and degradations of our institutions to remember that no one is expecting us to storm Omaha Beach.The fight is with a reality TV host/con man and his lawless clowns. Vote and repudiate
@LCunninghamII2 “Nuts!”
On this day pause and remember the 407,000 Americans who gave the “ last full measure of devotion” to our nation so that we could live in peace and freedom. Remember the sacrifices of our Allies in the UK, France,Canada.Poland, Australia, and all the rest of the Allied Forces.
The war in Europe was over. VE Day was declared for May 8th. NAZISM had been crushed by an army of liberation. Peace was at hand. The cost was staggering. 60 to 80 million people were killed globally.  The Jews of Europe were nearly exterminated. There are no good Nazis. Remember
Americans are connected to each other through the generations. Here is the message from The Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, Dwight Eisenhower 73 years ago today “The mission of this allied force was fulfilled at 0241 local time, May 7, 1945”🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷🇨🇦
@Melinda_McGraw This is very American. Americans rise and fight against what is plainly wrong. We are not a surrendering people. The American project will it be conquered by a reality show host and his band of misfit toys and feckless enablers
@shannonopry @evanasmith @BetoORourke @SHO_TheCircus @alexwagner He had it correct. The House does. Senate removes.
@EllenMorris1222 @JoeNBC I’d bet my right arm that he couldn’t
@JoeNBC I’d settle for him reading the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural.  Sadly, he doesn’t know our history and has no concept of the idea and ideal of America and the struggle by patriots from Lincoln to FDR to MLK to fulfill it and preserve it. His ignorance is appalling
Thank you! to the great crew and team at @SHO_TheCircus and @jheil, @alexwagner and @mmckinnon for having me along for the ride. It’s a great episode and I hope you will take time to watch if you missed it live!  Thanks again ! Amazing to watch it all come together!
@ivanjohnson I think it is an important and necessary discussion. The late great Sen DP Moynihan said “ Americans are entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts.” We objectively don’t live in that country anymore and that isn’t just tragic it’s dangerous to democracy .
@ivanjohnson I have the deepest respect for the reporters particularly at the NYT and Washington Post who are breaking story after story in this deranged era of American politics. The Pulitzer’s were well earned.M. Shear is someone I deeply respect and we have always disagreed agreeably.

@NicolleDWallace @nytimes This is a beautiful column by the always outstanding Frank Bruni about the American Hero, Warrior, Peacemaker, Statesman and living legend; United States Senator John Mccain. One thing is certainly true, Trump is profoundly unworthy to say this great man’s name out loud .
@MalcolmNance This story is utterly shocking. We must have more details in this. If this was sanctioned from the WH it represents one of the most scandalous acts ever perpetrated by an administration
@dandrezner This guy is a complete and total fraud.
@ABC @jonkarl Robert Mueller has been shot at for real in his life. In fact, he was wounded,  but left no man behind and never retreated. The clown posse attacking him is something I doubt causes him much loss of sleep.
@shearm Never seen anything like this and this unique moment requires reconsideration about how to define things that are plainly true and one simple truth is that this admin is stocked with pathological liars #
@shearm About that is dangerous in a democratic republic. Journalists play an indispensable role in our democratic society as sentinels of truth.  Yes , I’ve spun, evaded , complained and spoke both for affect and with sincerity about bias in the media but the plain truth is we have 5.
@shearm Not defined by what the leader says but rather by objective fact. I understand your points and I would generally agree that the term should not be used lightly since intent does matter.  However, TRUMP represents a radical departure from normal. The failure to speak plainly 4.
@shearm Administration. Trumps lies are lies of authority. They are the lies of an autocrat and his factotum that require submission and obedience to the leaders alternate reality. It’s straight out of 1984 where Winston is forced by the party to say four fingers are three. Truth is 2.
@shearm We are not talking about misstatements or good faith errors here. We are not talking about spin or tap dancing onthe north lawn of the WH which both Dan and I have done. We are talking about the non stop deliberate lying that is the hallmark of this unprecedentedly mendacious 1.
@JohnRJohnson @timfblogger It’s in the movie
The Republican Congress is ground zero in this country for an epidemic of public cowardice. Ryan and the rest surrendered to Trumpism without a fight. They watch in complicit silence as Trump sunders the nation. They are faithless to their oaths of office and the American people
@jmartNYT @yashar @SenatorDole @SenJohnMcCain John Mccain is a man with guts and courage.  One of his greatest legacies will be his work with his fellow combat veteran Sec. John Kerry to reestablish relations between the US and Vietnam. Reconciliation and the grace of forgiveness are hallmarks of this great mans life .
@Kddid15 The https://t.co/9vjrQeGYZh is fantastic
This corrupt administration is waging war against the idea of objective truth. Democracy does indeed die in darkness, smothered under a blanket of lies. Calling a lie and a liar out directly are essential in this moment.
Lie and Liar. These words have a plain and simple meaning in the English language. Media organizations should use them in describing the mendacity of this administration. Sarah Sanders is America’s second most prolific public liar falling behind only her repugnant liar-in Chief.

@Maxielu I am
Trump has debased his office, our institutions and our culture.  His top staffers are his accomplices in that debasement.  They are certainly not victims and media executives should show absolute fidelity to the free speech rights of a comic whose work stands on its own merits
The first amendment protects the right of speech. That includes comics, reporters and plain old everyday citizens.  There is no right in America to not be offended. The WHCD should be a celebration of the first amendment and its absolute indispensability to the American republic.
“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech; or of the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble; and to petition the government for a redress of grievances” 1/3
The one thing no autocrat can tolerate, and this is especially true of our dime store Mussolini and his factotum, is to be Laughed at. Nothing cuts deeper than truth that pierces the lies and pretensions with laughter. Autocrats and their followers are always victims. Ask them.
@PunkRockPoddle It is working. Look at the special election results and what is building for November
@NeverTrumpMMXVI @tedcruz The hypocrisy should always be called out .
@uncbare Of course. Sanders and Conway are in a perpetual battle for the silver and bronze as America’s second and third most prolific liars behind gold medalist Trump. They are faithless to their duty and oaths and deserve comedic scorn and mockery.They are extremely Sr govt officials
Cauldron of race baiting, division , meanness and cruelty that is Trumpism.
Understanding that toughness and hardness is essential but the movement must be fueled by love of country and American ideals and the qualities of gentleness, kindness and decency. Faith, trust and belief are the lubricants of democracy. They thrive in the light not the dark 3/4
The qualities of gentleness and kindness are not weak virtues but strong ones. Standing for those who cannot fight for themselves and having admiration for the indomitable qualities of the human spirit (Paralympic Games—easy to watch) are signs of strength. Fighting Trump means
Couple of thoughts.  Toughness and meanness are not the same. Meanness is the domain of the phoney tough and school yard bully. Trump is mean but weak. Case in point. He sent Conway and Sanders in his place to take the fire   Just like someone went in his place to Vietnam.  1/3
@WeirAisling Not sure where you read a criticism of the comic from me.
@matthewjdowd Basis of reciprocal hate but rather on the high ground of decency and  what is right and just. The struggle towards our ideals is a permanent one and the work of each generation.
@matthewjdowd Or that Madison square garden was filled to the rafters in 1938 with ecstatic members of the bund or that construction of the Washington Monument was stopped for a 1/4 century because of a donation of catholic marble. The point is these forces have always lost and not on the ....
@EWErickson @JeffreyGoldberg @RosieGray Conformity, obedience and unqualified faithfulness to the supreme leader are the requirements of modern conservatism. The staggering intellectual and moral corruption of much of the evangelical movement is a case in point. This “conservatism” is no such thing. It is illiberal .
Anybody who stands in opposition to Trump and his degradation of our institutions,liberties, laws and norms should pledge to refuse to do one thing that makes our toxic civil culture worse. Whataboutism and wallowing in Trumps toxic swamp of cruelty and meanness helps Trump .
@prosediva @WhitfordBradley I hope everybody watches it.
@OmnipotensGamer It is appalling. I oppose illiberalism in all its many forms.
@sunvalleyid @NicolleDWallace Thanks. It’s worth every penny.
@WhitfordBradley The scenes at the airport where ICE and TSA and national guard uniformed have become uniforms of oppression, dictatorship, theocracy are shocking, upsetting and deeply unsettling. Wow. There has never been anything on TV like it.
One Question never asked around “Lock them Up” rhetoric aimed at journalists, political opponents and career Law enforcement officials by Trump, FNC/Sinclair  propagandists, GOP members, and theocratic hypocrites like Moore, Falwell and Graham is what would the prisons look like?
@DivaDi95 The show is brilliant and the book is as well. You need to start on season 1.
@Ali_H_Soufan @reid_bj No sir ,  thank you .
I’ve just finished watching the first two episodes of season 2 of the Handmaids Tale. Without a doubt it is the most disturbing and frightening thing I have ever seen on TV. The acting of Elizabeth Moss and Alexis Bledel is intense, shocking and indescribably good.
The gutless Speaker of the House just asserted his prerogatives and asserted his power, not to assail this administrations corruption, indecency and assault on vital institutions but rather to fire the Catholic Priest serving as Chaplain of the House. Terrible.
Just finished watching HULU’s brilliant rendering of Lawrence Wright’s the Looming Tower. The performance by Jeff Daniels as John O’Neill is incredible. Trumps appalling Muslim bigotry and anti immigrant bile should be contemplated through the story of American hero Ali Soufan
@JillSorbie @TheRickWilson Potent and nuclear
@MSNBC Completely unprecedented for the President’ s personal Attorney to take the 5th, but then again, we have never had an orange president before. I suspect those red MAGA hats are going to yield to orange. I predict it will be an increasingly fashionable color around Trump.
@Alexinthecenter Do you think Trump knows there is no such thing as dragon energy ?  On the other hand maybe if the staff uses more images of dragons in his Intel briefings he will be able to focus more.
@janiemolloy University of Delaware but full on jersey native
Growing up in New Jersey I loved the spectacle of mob trials. When John Gotti was on trial the question was never about whether he was guilty or not,it was about whether he would get away with it. There isn’t even a pretense of “we didn’t do anything criminal” around Trump’s gang

@JohnDalyBooks @JonahNRO Jonah Goldberg is brilliant in this interview. I’m looking forward to getting his new book. It’s amazing to watch the lost art of persuasion at work. Politics has become a business of incitement to our great national detriment.
@PattySantv @Lonestarmomcom Seriously , how profoundly stupid would a Mayor have to be to go into business with Trump inc with bazillions of taxpayer dollars at stake. It’s amazing. Why does literally every person around TRUMP think they are the exception to the screw job. That may be his greatest talent
@JRubinBlogger Our Constitutional Republic is under threat from a government that has become profoundly corrupted. The scandal is that this is legal.
@moxfyre You are correct. The chancellor is technically -# 3 in a protocol sense
@moxfyre She is chancellor.
@JudyMcLarty He is not. He is the head of government. The queen is CANADA ‘s head of state.
@ttttrasher37 They are heads of government. Queen Elizabeth is the head of state. The President is the head of the Executive branch ; commander in chief of the armed forces and the Head of State.
@GCasale A potent one.
@NotoriousSDA The Unites States is much greater than our incompetent, incoherent, malfeasant and illiberal President.
Emanuel Macron gave an extremely important speech before Congress where he made the case for the defense, preservation and strengthening of the rules based liberal global order built by the US and her allies from the ashes and ruin of the Second World War.
With his speech before Congress Emanuel Macron has declared himself a friend of freedom and liberty. Given that May,Trudeau and Turnbull are not heads of state and Merkel commands a weak military it is perfectly clear that Macron is leader of the free world. Trump vacated the job
@matthewamiller I always heard Goering was a great raconteur with a great taste for wine and a profound talent for schnitzel !!
@ProfSommerville @RepTenney @ABrindisiNY Seriously,  this terrible Congresswoman is calling for the imprisonment of political opponents and law enforcement officials in the United States. Voters should drop her like a bad habit. She is as toxic for our political system as a Marlboro is for your lungs.
@macsmith413 @NicolleDWallace Hopefully, people will put American before their party identity in a not too distant future and remember we are on Team USA. Political opponents needs not be enemies. Dissent is American and we need different points of view in a healthy system
@leahaskarinam @alexburnsNYT This portends disaster for the House GOP majority. This is an overwhelming GOP district. The message for GOP members is that unless your baseline is 25 + R nobody is safe. Signed; Former Communications Director NRCC
@RealPaulKeane This is a very provocative question. It is like telling someone what the birthday wish was. I’m pretty certain they will screw it up. I have seen no signs that the miracle is drawing close. You ?
@RonaldKlain This person is unfit to serve in the United States Congress. She is faithless to the US Constitution and the rule of law. She is bewitched by her cult leader, a dime store Mussolini. A great way to tell her we don’t want to live in Trumpistan is to donate to her opponent .
@katiepack C’est Possible ?  Mon Dieu !! Vive Le Spicer!
@kylegriffin1 @BGHeaven Sounds like a straight up Kamikazee attack is coming !!  On the other hand “ I don’t need no stinkin’ help” is perfectly understandable when you look at the Great job WH Comms is doing with Jackson and every other thing it goes near
@TopherSpiro @JRubinBlogger If true it’s over for him. He’ll have to retire from the Navy and drop out of the confirmation process which he should do anyway because he is unqualified for it and should know better
@hughhewitt @USOPM Of course the Presidential Personnel Office wasn’t sitting around in the White House Vaping and playing the “icing “ drinking game in the Reagan White House or any other for that matter .
One last thing on this. It is absolutely inappropriate for Jackson to be wearing his uniform while meeting with Senators. He should be in business attire. He is a nominee for a civilian cabinet position.
4.  If jackson was drinking on duty and this was known by his chain of command then this will become a huge scandal within Navy medicine. Hearings before the Armed Forces committees will quickly follow. 5.  This entire fiasco shows that Trump could care less about the VA and vets
Some thoughts on the Dr. Jackson debacle.  He is completely unqualified to lead the VA.  2.  Clearly the WH learned zero lessons from “wifebeatergate” 3.  Command climate is the responsibility of the commander who was Jackson’s superior officer .
@LorrieScott @JRubinBlogger Here’s my only point. The media should publically vet him. The only thing Tester et al should say is “ there have been serious allegations made. The committee is investigating them. We will report back“ No doubt this is another huge Trump/Kelly debacle and clinic on mismanagement
@JRubinBlogger The allegation that he improperly prescribed medication seems ludicrous to me. The attending Physician routinely prescribes medication to WH Staff on international travel with POTUS for help with managing jet lag and vast time changes. I am really skeptical about this
@JRubinBlogger I believe Senator Tester and others commenting on this are acting deplorably. Jackson is a Navy Admiral. He is entitled to discretion with regard to explosive allegations Tester is repeating allegations and rumor mongering . They should talk when rumors are proven as fact.
@jookyhc @mopenshaw @JustD53 Let’s just say every AMERICAN has a rooting interest in this one. The office is UNITED STATES SENATOR.  I do wonder how much non Texas money Cruz has taken in?  Lastly, your strong majority seems recently smaller , n’est pas ?
@ananavarro Given that they gave us a gift as magnificent as the Statue of Liberty,  is this Macrons’ way of saying “you are the worst president in history and every western leader believes the most appropriate gift is this weak and sickly Charlie Brown Christmas tree version of an Oak tree”
@brhodes @MalcolmNance I am old enough to remember when Rand Paul was occasionally interesting and unpredictable. I wonder what the award for most improved in marching in a straight line is called at the senate gop lunch.
@BillKristol Again, what a disgrace she is. What a profoundly Un American thing to say from the West Wing of the White House. I’ll give her this though, becoming more detestable than her hypocrite father was no small mountain to climb.
@PaineFan01 @NicolleDWallace What a beautiful picture. Two men. One woman. One is a grieving son.  The other a friend. Magnanimous , gracious, classy and comforting.  The woman is decent and filled with empathy. Two imperfect men who were fidelitous to their oaths.  American Presidents and a great 1st lady.
Lafayette, the last surviving General , of the American Revolution toured the US on our 50th birthday to see the young country he helped create. He would be appalled that Trump, an illiberal clown, occupies  the office held by his friends Washington, Adams and Jefferson
The relationship between the US and France, our first and oldest ally  will be celebrated tonight at a State dinner. That not a single leader of the Democratic Party is invited is another Trump assault on the dignity of his office and our country. Lafayette must be weeping.
@JoyceWhiteVance He makes no pretense about it. He is the leader of a tribe. He looks at the majority of Americans with contempt and a hard heart. His incompetence is so stupendous he has can’t even get a state dinner right
@PhilippeReines @lorrainztweetz @NicolleDWallace @DanaBashCNN Maybe its something like when one spouse withdraws most of the joint savings to build a giant ice sculpture of Trumps Head for the first Fox n Friends of the new month where all of the folks from the retirement community can sit around and talk about the deep state ? Just a guess
From Col. Travis to Audie Murphy, Earl Rudder and millions of everyday people Texans are famous for doing their duty. How can a state known throughout the world for toughness and patriotism have a supine Senator( Cruz )that is too cowed and cowardly to defend our institutions ?
Thinking about Ted Cruz’s slobbering Paean to Trump and the closeness of his race to the exciting and decent Beto O’Rourke one thing should be clear to Texans. If Ted Cruz won’t protect the backs of his Dad and wife he won’t have your back. I think Sam Houston would be for Beto!

@SalenaZito This is what a GREAT and BRAVE AMERICAN looks like. It really puts a spotlight on the weakness and fecklessness of leaders like Paul Ryan and the detestable Ted Cruz who know right from wrong when it comes to Trump but lack the guts and spine to stand up and do the right thing
@RLandwat @KatyTurNBC Be back soon!

@KatyTurNBC Couldn’t someone just go outside and pick some fresh from the tree or are they not in season ?
@NicolleDWallace @DanaBashCNN Conway likely flipped out because she knows Trump will be watching her performance from bed with his clicker in one hand and a filet of fish and a Big Mac in the other when he learns for the first time that George Conway isn’t in the cult. So sad
@NicolleDWallace @DanaBashCNN Dana Bash, cool under fire as usual . Kellyanne Conway has long been for liars what Joe Montana was for quarterbacks but now, with this interview she shows that she is also the Babe Ruth of petulant professional victims.
@juliehdavis @Lonestarmomcom 1.  It’s amazing that Trump can literally lie 5 times in 280 characters. 2.  From a career comparison perspective Pulitzer Prize winner Maggie Haberman is just getting started while Trump will go down as the worst President in history ( Buchanan included )
@BennCalissi Pruitt is dirty. He is clearly a crook and should absolutely not be in government service. unbelievable

@neilvogel Neil, is there ?  One that is on the level ?
@anneapplebaum This Buchanan column is as un American as anything you will ever read. The reaction to it and the dark forces he is speaking to and for must be confronted with the power and the glory of the idea of liberal democracy. Complacency has always been an Achilles heel of our system.
@anneapplebaum Buchanan is faithless to American ideas and ideals and is part of a growing movement across the West that has become enamored of a creeping authoritarianism and illiberalism that has never brought the world anything other than grief, tragedy and misery. It must be confronted.
@anneapplebaum People should treat this column as seriously as they would a heart attack. Buchanan has ripped away any pretense about what it is he believes and he is far from alone. America is not just a place where people live and things happen. It is an idea and ideal.
@BrunoAmato_1 Sadly, this is the tradition. The President rotates through each service academy once for commencement during their four year term. Sadly, the class of 18 at Annapolis will have theirs desecrated by this unfit Commander in Chief.

@NicolleDWallace Fight night in dc is the largest Children’s fundraiser of the year in DC .  It takes place in November. If Stone is out on bail we could do it then.
@NicolleDWallace Yes. 3 rounds = 3 minutes. There is one minute rest. That is an amateur fight. Head gear required. boxing is a great though under appreciated sport these days. It’s charity potential is under utilized. For some one like stone who likes throwing low blows it seems appropriate
@masg66 @NicolleDWallace @krassenstein He can sub in Gorka if he likes
@masg66 @NicolleDWallace @krassenstein Mrs. Bush raised over a billion  dollars for charity. I have an idea though it may be flawed because Stone is too old for it to be fair. Let’s do a three round charity boxing match. We can raise a lot of $ while I give this piece of shit the beating he deserves. Challenge is real

@LilybytheBay Only if she stays. Her response was brilliant. However UN Ambassadors communicate policy. They don’t set it. How can she ever credibly communicate administration policy again ?  He cut her off at the knees
@JeanConnell9 @davidaxelrod Good for you !  All who oppose Trump, me included , should be resolved to make sure we do not do one thing to make our Politics worse. We must be on the side of making it better. None of us are perfect but Trumpism thrives on reciprocal anger. It is decency that will kill it .
@MarlaHooch1 Read Lincoln’s second inaugural. Fight for what is right but do it with joy and purpose. Read MLK’s last speech in Memphis.  Trumpism will be snuffed out with the values embodied in those great men’s important words .
@CheriJacobus @mfrost11 Serious question. If ISIS prisoners were forced to watch her would it be a violation of anti-torture laws ?
I don’t understand why people feel the need to declare their Politics when they salute and mourn Mrs. Bush.  We are Americans before we are partisans.  We can be opponents and remain friends. We are all in it together and her great American life transcends tribal sensibilities .
@JeanConnell9 @davidaxelrod One important antidote to toxic trumpism is less hate and more love. George Herbert Walker Bush is an honorable and admirable man. He is a legitimate war hero and I would hope he feels the love of the nation he has well served in his hour of grief.
@danpfeiffer This ☝️
@DSPollack No
Understanding what Trump did to Haley requires a leap of imagination to the surreal where after Adlai Stevenson delivers his brilliant exposition of Soviet lies, Bobby Kennedy calls the Kremlin and says don’t worry about it, we don’t mean it, and then JFK takes Zorins’ side.
@LisaBak42791930 Every other UN ambassador knows her authority has been decimated. There is one and only one indispensable person in this administration. That would be Jim Mattis. His departure would literally unleash panic in Capitol’s around the world.

The first person to resign from this cancerous administration on principle will look back on that day the same way powerball winners look back on the moment they bought their golden ticket. Trump has made Haley look like a fool. If she stays it will be at the cost of her dignity
Trump has obliterated Nikki Haley’s ability to credibly represent and speak for the United States. She should resign and relax for a couple of weeks before she enjoys a bit of New England springtime. I’m thinking New Hampshire might be nice in late May.
Trump has shattered Nikki Haley’s credibility as irrevocably as he obliterated his moral authority after Charlottesville.  Trump has humiliated her and she is at a fork in the road. Her choice is either to resign or take on the permanent stench of one more tainted factotum .
@thehill As the outrages, scandals, incompetence and malfeasance build upon each other into the largest mound of toxic political excrement ever seen in this country we should not lose sight of  the most corrupt member of this cabal who is not a member of the Trump clan. PRUITT IS A CROOK

@jimstinson @brithume This is the gravesite of General Teddy Roosevelt Jr, recipient of the Medal of Honor.

I wonder what these sons of a POTUS would think of Trump jr and kushner meeting Russian intel agents https://t.co/12jZfSUoVU
@tomricks1 One thing I can’t stop thinking about is this. Before the next Presidential election It is almost certain that the first American soldier, sailor, airmen or marine will be killed in action somewhere in the Middle East who was born AFTER the 9/11 attacks .
@mettawren8 @JamesMartinSJ @JWGOP Obviously a different version of the same. Respectfully, I think you are missing the point
@brithume Are you suggesting there are no ties between Russians and the Presidents inner circle ? I don’t understand your point
@JamesMartinSJ @JWGOP Take a second to watch a man of god at work. Whether you believe or not it is hard to miss the grace and goodness of Pope Francis. What a contrast to the frauds, hypocrites and wack jobs like Perkins, Falwell jr , Franklin Graham, Robertson , Hagee , ect.

@jdawsey1 Every Psychology text book will have to be rewritten so this incomparable example of projection can be included.
Standing up to Trump’s lies, delusions, cruelty, divisiveness  and constant assault  on the Intelligence community and the Justice Dept should not have been a “ hard call” for Ryan. He should have understood it was his duty and obligation as Speaker of the House.
I don’t know Paul Ryan and don’t really care whether he is a “ good guy “or not. He is third in line to the Presidency.  Why is he being infantized and talked about like he is the outgoing Rotary Club President. He failed to stand up for civility, decency and impt US institutions
@craigstewart101 BOTH. Absolutely.
@DrRLRussell @jdawsey1 No sir, they look like his accomplices
Paul Ryan’s monument will be the the putrid and smoldering ruins of the Republican Party and conservative movement that he betrayed with his complicity and cowardice. He lacked the guts to stand for decency and the wisdom to confront the threat of Trumpism.
Paul Ryan is responsible for adding TRILLIONS to the national debt.  It’s hard to understand what a trillion is. Maybe this helps. A million seconds=12 days. A billion seconds=30 years.  A trillion seconds = 30,000 years.
@jdawsey1 Team Trump !  It’s amazing to me that they released this on purpose. The joy and happiness at the DCCC and the DSCC must be hard to describe .

Should the firing come it will be time for the American people to engage in the largest peaceful civil demonstrations in the countries history. Trump will have crossed a line that demands his impeachment and removal from office. Failure to do so will betray America
2.  To do our duty as the generations that came before us did theirs . American Liberty has been preserved by sacrifices that beggar the imagination. America is a nation where the rule of law is supreme.  The United States must not turn into a lawless and corrupt Trumpistan. ..

The firing of Andrew McCabe was political. Period. This is an assault on the rule of law by an erratic, lawless, corrupt and dishonest regime. The character assassination of this American patriot is outlandish.  Show me the evidence of wrong doing!
LTG HR McMaster, Author of “Dereliction of Duty”  looks like the next to go. Will he take a four star bribe to be quiet, or retire at 3 star rank and tell us the truth about the dangerous shit show he saw?
Seriously, someone who is more technologically competent than me should set up a mechanism where good Americans can fund this great patriots full pension .
This American citizen demands to know the precise evidence that led to the termination of a 21 year FBI senior leader with a reputation for probity and rectitude two days before his reaching pension eligibility. Disgraceful. This is an abuse of power and pure bananarepublicanism
ANDREW MCCABE,  thank you for your 21 years of faithful service to the United States of America. I hope all within reach of this tweet will donate what they can and fund this patriots deserved pension. You have to be a 7th degree stupid belt to believe this isn’t political.

When pondering Trumps unconscionable provocations towards CANADA, our great ally and essential economic and military partner, Americans should remember the great sacrifice made by Canadian Forces post 9/11 and the tremendous kindness of the people of Gander Newfoundland on 9/11
Trumps’ felony stupid trade provocations towards CANADA will hurt Every American. Canada is the largest trading partner for 35 states and #2 for 13.  Cross border Supply chains are deeply integrated and tens of millions of jobs dependent on the $1t trade relationship.
US is under attack by Russia and other actors in a global information/cyber war. Trump and his rancid confederacy of congressional and media conspiracy theorists refuse to defend the nation while at the same time abetting the Russian attack by smearing DOJ, FBI, CIA and Steele.
The United States has a trade surplus with Canada. The border represents the longest, peaceful, undefended border in the history of the world. Our militaries are deployed together and nearly $1trillion in commerce flows between our countries. Canada is a friend. The Russians not.
@CNBC Declaring Trump a “master negotiator”is ludicrous. He has shown beyond all and any doubt through his immigration and gun negotiation stunts that he is a supernova of ignorance, incompetence and ineptitude.  His tariffs and looming trade war are just the latest WH stupidity.
@michikokakutani @ProPublica The corruption and defiling of the Presidency by this Hyena pack of grifters, crooks and opportunists is breathtaking.
@KenDilanianNBC It is profoundly important that more information be revealed with regard to the allegations that the Russians vetoed Mitt Romney as Secretary of State. If that is true, if Russia/Putin influenced that decision, it represents clear grounds for Trumps removal from office
@MalcolmNance @JaneMayerNYer Should read oaths not paths. Auto correct and Middle Ages eyes are not working well together !
@MalcolmNance @JaneMayerNYer This is essential reading. Wow !  THE American people owe a great debt of gratitude to our faithful ally Christopher Steele. McConnell, Grassley and Graham’s actions on this matter demonstrate faithlessness to their paths and duty. Truly shameful
@MalcolmNance @JaneMayerNYer This is essential reading. Wow !  THE American people owe a great debt of gratitude to our faithful ally Christopher Steele.
@NatashaBertrand This is an absurd statement. Casualty estimates range as high as one million. War in Korea would be an epic tragedy and the sacrifice required by American forces should not be discussed blithely
@crampell You can’t fix stupid or crazy .
@JohnWDean This is a must read column from the experienced, wise and indispensable Eugene Robinson.  We are witnessing levels of corruption by Trump and Kushner that are simply astonishing.  It is neither normal or right.
@NBCNews So ... according to those around the WH, we should all be concerned, because the absence of Hope Hicks means that soon there will no longer be a restraint on Trumps impulsive Twittering ? Really ?
@ananavarro POLITICIZE !!!!!  My god -oh no ! Hundreds of American kids have been hunted and killed in their schools. Politics is how we fix injustice and systemic stupidity in this country. What a stupid thing for Rubio to say
@DebThobe A double dog dare is extremely serious business!
@Marc_Kenyon Straight through until the moment of electoral repudiation.
@krassenstein This is an enormously significant and deeply disturbing development. This is a political investigation of the type most commonly seen in Banana Republics and autocratic systems. It was mandated by right wing media and fueled by conspiracy theories. The rule of law is under attack
@NMc_NorCal @kleptocracynow Treason has a precise legal and constitutional definition.  I don’t want to be imprecise with language.
@NicolleDWallace It would be excellent if there was some type of betting pool where we could bet which Trump 2020 staffer will be the first to be indicted.  Though I know I am destined to never win the lottery I think I can pull off a trifecta on this and win lots of money !
@buzzblog @JRubinBlogger @RadioFreeTom @NicolleDWallace @GeorgeWill @TheRickWilson Another great 👍 column by Jennifer Rubin. America and “Americanism” will be defended by a massive alliance of Democrats, independents and Republicans in 2018. GOP voters will be the smallest part of the coalition but a 15 to 20% defection rate towards Dems creates a super wave
@TexasBred323 That fish was a Canadian !
@perlmutations I understand your incredulity at that number, but remember Nixon was at 29% on the day he resigned. The more impt # is the opposition number.  That number far exceeds the 30%.  Come November Trump and his cultists will be surrounded by all of us much like Custer was.
Common sense would suggest that our bone spur addled, draft dodging, stair and germ phobic  President, who refuses to defend American democracy from Russian attack, would be highly unlikely to charge a mass shooter without a gun.
There has never been a President who refuses to defend America. Ever. He has been abetted by a deeply corrupted Republican majority in Congress and a profoundly dishonest right wing propaganda campaign. Their perfidy affronts the memory of all those who died so that we are free
Trumps’ refusal to defend the integrity of the US election system and our Democracy from Russian attack represents an unconscionable dereliction of duty and utter faithlessness to his oath of office. This betrayal is unprecedented in American history. 1/2
@BillKristol Wouldn’t it be great if a member of Congress  introduced a modernized Nepotism bill ? This should never ever be allowed to happen again.
@JoeGonz06607997 @JoeNBC No. Anyone who says guns are not part of this issue or discussion is a fool. Anybody who can’t see the other 20 contributing factors with regard to making this monster is also a fool. Anybody who can’t see the incompetence across our govt everywhere you look is also a fool
@GMCI5 @stevesingiser @JoeNBC Under Florida law. It’s not a theoretical point. Fl Gov has that authority
@jimpiasecki93 @JoeNBC The failures are systemic. The sheriffs responsibility here is singular. Absolute and complete failure by law enforcement. More troubling details will emerge. Listen to the Sheriff I’m the interview. It’s all about him and his job.
@stevesingiser @JoeNBC Yes
@JoeNBC It was themost devastating cross exam since Lt. Caffey took on Colonel Jessup. Sheriff Israel exposed himself as a horrendous leader with no sense of accountability or responsibility. His department is riddled by cowardice and incompetence and he is in charge. Scott should fire .
@matthewamiller Exactly. The Chairman of the House Intelligence committee is a complete and total monkey
@mattmfm Disgusting.
@CoreyClayton It’s a great flag depicting a timber rattlesnake with 13 rattles. A Timber rattlesnake does not strike unless provoked. It was a symbol of resistance and a warning to the British. That’s not what Trump was talking about today.
@McNicollb I think you might be projecting
Here is a Nazi propaganda poster from 1928. The words are Marxism and capitalism. Serpent iconography was used to depict Jews and foreigners as threats and infiltrators.  Enemies of the people and State. Shame on Trump. https://t.co/YWnXEYJLE1
@Deplorablesrme Here is the thing Mike.  Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes and pulled an inside straight to win by 78k over 3 States.  His approval is 32-35 percent. That means you are increasingly surrounded—like Custer— by all the rest of us. 😢
@SRuhle That snake story Trump told would have fit perfectly and been perfectly understood if it was delivered in German at a rally in Nuremberg in 1935.  I don’t say this lightly.  A disgusting display by an American President.
@anamariecox Challenge for you Ms. Cox 😀.  Outside of a bar where are the 3 most likely places excluding bus stations where you would be most likely to hear something as imbecilic as this ?
Trumps snake story is vicious, disgraceful, utterly racist and profoundly Un-American. That this is how an American President speaks of immigration is a tragedy.  This crowd of cheering extremists are the heirs of the Know-Nothing’s and nativists that have always plagued us .
Trumps leaving TPP was the greatest geopolitical gift given to the Chinese in 1000 years. It signals American retreat and decline in the Pacific.  The Chinese have announced 1 trillion in infrastructure investments along the old Silk Road.  What is this CPAC crowd cheering for.
@thehill That survivor, whether they know it or not, just wrote a devastating attack ad. That formulation can be used against scores of GOP incumbents to devastating effect with millennials and suburban women.
This speech at CPAC is demagogic, vapid, intellectually dishonest and just plain old fashioned idiotic.  If someone delivered this speech from the end of a bar most people would think that person was an imbecile.
@cherylberklich Lol. On TV !  Not my crowd !
Watching LaPierre at CPAC today was disturbing and frightening. It reminded me of the quote often misattributed to Sinclair Lewis, “When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross”.  There was an illiberal wind blowing today. It was ominous
@BestRelaEver @NBCNews Many schools will threaten this. This is a great opportunity for parents to read MLK’s letter from a Birmingham jail with their kids. Some laws and rules are unjust and sometimes a cause is worth breaking laws and rules. Take the suspension with pride, a smile and stoic resolve
@jeremyweller @AshaRangappa_ Well I suspect if you understood small bullet ballistics, cavitation caused by round velocity or perhaps ever fired this type of weapon you would understand that the first person account of a treating physician who tried to save these slaughtered kids is evidence not opinion
@dhfsfc @bariweiss You seem quite intolerant of the possibility that people might have different view points or that your political opponents might be well intentioned. You may believe your ideology makes you virtuous but you come across much like Trump cult members do.
@JWGOP They are disturbing.  CPAC is profoundly outside the mainstream of American Politics. Each year it becomes more extreme, the rhetoric more ominous and the characters more strange. It certainly has nothing to do with conservatism as it was previously understood
@mbergs12 @bariweiss @GOP I didn’t vote for him
@AshaRangappa_ And thus ends the debate about whether it is a “ military” weapon. It is. It is built to kill - people. News orgs should ask combat medics and military surgeons who have served in combat theaters whether they think it is a weapon of war or not
@VforVictory1 @bariweiss We have popularized for civilian use a category of weapons that are essentially military weapons.  The AR -15 falls in this category as do many other types of semi automatic rifles. The aquisition process for this type of gun should , at a minimum, be extremely rigorous
@bariweiss @yhazony One thing about Le Pen and her party philosophy. They are Nationalists and Socialists. National Socialism has a very very bad track record in Europe and has no correlation with traditional AMERICAN conservatism and the vestiges of the GOP
@bariweiss I think about this constantly. It is beyond shocking to me. The utter capitulation to it and the absolute abandonment of any principle. Sometimes I feel like a sucker who got conned by the shady salesman .  I actually believed in a lot of what we were supposed to believe in
@calebecarma 1.  Caleb looks tough. Doesn’t back up one inch when someone 5 inches taller and 400 pounds heavier gets in his face.  2.  Police should be called. The word for the shove is ASSault
@ericlobes @chrislhayes Fiscal restraint , public virtues like rectitude and probity , defense of the nation from foreign adversaries , commitment to the rule of law, fidelity to democratic norms and essential institutions. Decency, rigor, competence and preparedness. Just a few. You are a cult member
@chrislhayes Speech from an NRA President 30 years ago. It will shed light on the transformation of this group from a gun safety and hunters rights org to a radical one where paramilitary fetishists are more at home than hunters and sportsmen/women
@chrislhayes It is worth pondering LaPierres speech today if for no other reason than to understand how bat shit crazy it is .  Conspiracies! Sedition ! Enemies at the gates! He seems on the edge of calling for civil war. Someone should do some sleuthing and come up with the equivalent 1/2
@thehill She should bequeath her brain 🧠 to research at the Institute for the Advanced Study of Stupid People. When I first watched Idiocracy years ago I didn’t realize it was a work of prophesy
@Official_PeterJ This is a great show and worth binge watching to catch up on. It is a brilliant meditation on the fragility of institutions and the fallibility of individuals who choose expediency and collaboration over principle and resistance. It’s a show that makes you think about tyranny.
@Official_PeterJ When is the premier. ?
@AutumndiPace1 That’s a good looking guy !
@DineshDSouza Amazing arrogance from this convicted felon .
@RonCohenUS17 @SueCaro1 You mean “ the good Nazis ? “. You are unfit to serve in Congress which is why you will be crushed .
@thehill The profoundly stupid were well represented when Jack Kingston sat in the Congress.
@SRuhle @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Don Jr. seems to be pulling away from the pack, Usain Bolt style, for the ignominious distinction of worst first family member ever. Definitely the worst since Sherry Palmer was First Lady.
@SRuhle @RonaldKlain @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Jr. Sounds panicked about something. I wonder what it could be? I often remind clients in crisis situations that people don’t drown because they can’t swim, they drown because they panic.

@jaketapper I believe the Governor of Florida has the power to commission him posthumously with a brevet rank of second lieutenant in the Florida National Guard. This would entitle him to a funeral with full military honors. It would be a worthy honor for a heroic young man .
@BanditRandom @PressSec @POTUS You are an Assistant to the President and the White House Press Secretary. Show some class and respect. His name is PRESIDENT Obama
@TheRickWilson With 5 rounds loaded
@ImwithTrump2 @Finn_aka_Jeremy I think I’ll stay. I’m anxious to vote .
@MichaelRCaputo And again you are a Russian useful idiot.  When I think about the Star Wars Creature Cantina that is this WH and it’s menagerie of outside crooks,scammers and career D listers like you, I wonder what type of alien you would be in that bar. Something small, nervous, dumb, I guess
@MichaelRCaputo You are what most people who have worked in Politics would call a D lister. Or maybe a Russian stooge.  What is it like to work for Gazprom ?
@MichaelRCaputo Really. Lighten up Francis. “Once in a while you get shown the light.  In the strangest of  places if you look it right.” Jerry Garcia .  You should read the indictment and ask yourself how you wound up as a shill attacking the FBI and Justice   Dept. Perfect alignment with FSB
@GrandaddyLeech @MichaelRCaputo No. I don’t think so. Not in the part of the country Mike and I are from.
@MichaelRCaputo Lighten up Francis.
@WillMcAvoy_ @seanmdav Disagree.  It’s the combination of high powered rifle and small bullet ballistics that makes them so deadly
@seanmdav Perhaps it might be possible to engage in a conversation about this over Twitter ?  Are you familiar with small bullet ballistics ? Can we agree that this shooter had no business being within a mile of that weapon ? If yes,is there nothing that can be done to reduce that contact?
Trump shattered the moral authority of his Presidency during Charlottesville.  It can never be restored. We live in the surreal world where the words of the POTUS have no meaning.  His presence brings no comfort.  He is an avatar of disunion, division; selfishness and immorality
@Ihate_Airplanes And unconstitutional.
@KFILE So ....if there were to be a teaching example about the perniciousness of propaganda and how familiar and credible state media could look in a retreating democracy one would have to look no further .
@GrimmTale21 @VonnieCalland @DonnaFEdwards @GOP @Strike4Change You are a NAZI
@rogerthatone @Michael_Faherty The mini 14 and ar 15 pictures are substantially the same weapon. The magazine is smaller on the mini and it is generally considered a less accurate weapon
@RCannon74 The more familiar people are with firearms the more they appreciate the singular lethality of this category of weapon. What is sold currently belongs in the category of currently restricted automatic weapons.  Minimum age for any purchase should be 21 and magazine size restricted
The President of the United States is faithless to his oath to “ preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States”.   Conspiracy Republicans like Garry, Meadows, Jordan and Nunes have positions aligned with the FSB.  They refuse to protect America
Trust, Faith and Belief are essential lubricants in a constitutional republic like the United States.  Trust in each other, Faith in the American system and belief in the future are all under attack from Russia. This Global information war is real. Appeasement will not win it.
@woodruffbets The Russians have always been adept at finding Americans like Conway and Trump jr to serve as their witting or unwitting dupes. “ Useful Idiot” is how the Russians describe these people .  The heirs of Duranty.
@ExumAM I believe the Governor of Florida has the power to posthumously commission this young man with a brevet rank in the Florida National Guard. It would be a worthy honor for a young man who died heroically  on the battlefield that American schools have become .
Meddling is a proper description of In Law behavior .  What Russia did is ATTACK the United States.  Trump and the Corrupted GOP majority refuse to defend the sovereignty of the country from this outside THREAT from a hostile state actor .
@ColtonBrey But M-16’s are.  Same weapon. Only difference is that it is semi automatic.
Since some categories of weapons are already banned under federal law it means more weapons can be added to that list. The AR-15, the weapon of choice for most mass shooters, is the semi automatic version of an M16 which is illegal to buy. Both are devastating weapons of war.
@JedKatz I am a gun owner whose position has changed over recent years on this issue.  I’m in the 85 percent that supports common sense change.  I have a hardened, cold and different view of the NRA than I once did.
@Ingersol4Janice @Susan_Hennessey What I said is that active shooter drills are not routine in Canadian schools. The students don’t live in a country where they are routinely shot in school. This was #18 this year. It’s Feb 15th
@Susan_Hennessey A new American rite of passage. The first active shooter drill for our little kids.  We don’t have to stand for this. There is a giant question in the air .  What kind of country do we want to live in?
@danpfeiffer Or sudafed
@OnlyRealFred @2017whyjeebus This is a 45 Star flag from 1895. It is indeed the Utah statehood flag. The stars are aligned in a medallion wreath pattern. The current configuration of stars was mandated in 1912. Before then there were many interesting star patterns
@lfomurchu @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @HallieJackson I said on the one WEEK anniversary.
@chelleinchicago @jheil @Magsthebookie I’m a gun owner.  We need to have a serious discussion about what to do about this national emergency. I’ll listen to any idea.  There were no active shooter drills in schools when I was growing up. There is a sickness in the land and we have to talk about all of it .
@jheil @Magsthebookie Very
@SarahNoah9 @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @HallieJackson The one thing we don’t need in this country is more stupid people !  A one day walkout will send a powerful message.
@jheil Not a lot.
@lividdelight @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @HallieJackson My free advice would be to keep it simple.  At an exact moment every student should walk out of their classrooms and sit silently in the hallways. There has been enough talking. Let silence ring out in memory of every slaughtered child and in contempt for our corrupted leaders
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @HallieJackson Here is an idea. Every High school student in America so inclined should come to school on the 1 week anniversary of this shooting and refuse to enter classrooms. Sit silently in the hallway for a day.  Protest.This is America. We can change this.  We don’t have to accept this .
@mattyglesias Yes,  of course,  but it is profoundly illiberal and antithetical to the tenants of a liberal education.
@JohnJHarwood I can’t believe you forgot that Mitch McConnell cover !  I framed mine !
@AshleyRParker Free advice is worth what you pay for it. With that being said I am going to offer some to Ms. Linton. You should never ever ever ever ever talk to a reporter on the record again for any reason at any time.

@cnni She is a member of the senior leadership of a murdering slave regime where millions have died of starvation. Treating her like a North Korean Kardashian isn’t just ludicrous it is immoral
If John Kelly displayed his current levels of mendacity, incompetence, bad judgement and arrogance as a USMC Captain he would have been relieved of duty.
@JonLemire When we ponder the massive incompetence, ineptitude and malfeasance of this administration it is impt that we give the frm cigarette industry apologist and current VP his due. We could have sent BOO BOO the Clown over there and he wouldn’t have screwed up the Olympic opening
@JoeNBC An amazing insight into the the advice Trump gets and the extraordinary role that the sycophancy and servility of his advisors has played in weakening our country , our institutions and dividing the American people .
@JRubinBlogger You are probably right. We should attempt a top ten list of their most odious figures
John Kelly is as bad at Chief of Staffing as Rex Tillerson is at Secretary of State-ing .
Rachel Brand is brilliant and known for her impeccable integrity and fidelity to the rule of law and institutions of the country. Her departure is significant and worrisome. A bad omen for sure
COS Kelley should reflect upon this quote from Ronald Reagan on the occasion of his 107fh birthday. It reads “I know in my heart that man is good.  That what is right will always eventually triumph and there’s purpose and worth in each and every human life” etched at his grave .
@SpeakerRyan He would be extremely pissed at you. Extremely.

@BillKristol @EliotACohen Essential reading. Cohen makes a powerful argument about the importance of believing in America and believing in Americans during this era of loathsome and gutless leadership from Trump and the sewer Republicans of Washington
@NBCPolitics This is a must read story by Carol Lee that offers new details about Trumps rage at the investigations.  It reveals a small and petty man who feels cornered and enraged by the constitutional checks on his power. This resignation is the culmination of a POTUS led smear campaign.
@JRubinBlogger @NormOrnstein @RonBrownstein @SpeakerRyan I agree completely with the exception of the use of the word likely in the last sentence.
@sabresnc Understanding this is key to understanding the difference between a cabal and a political party and between a regime and an administration. Democracies require accountability. It is the oil that keeps the engine from seizing.  Without accountability there can be no democracy
@PhilipRucker @chefjoseandres Her entitlement, arrogance and fragility are revealed in this story. The larger issue is that she is a White House staffer.  Her demand for removal is outrageous as such. She is an Asst. to the President, not Her Royal Highness
@EJDionne @Milbank Fidelity to a cult of personality and the gravitational pull towards conformity, obedience and the necessary abandonment of previously held principles is both illiberal and ominous. The question soon before us will be if 80%of the GOP is ready to abandon the rule of law and Const
Even now, Republicans are ignoring the storm clouds.  This is a great and true column.  https://t.co/uWW06OGmnS
Republicans redefine morality as whatever Trump does. A great piece by Dana Milbank. This is a tragedy for this country. This is the story of a dangerous malignancy in a constitutional republic.  Fidelity to any leader at this level is deeply troubling https://t.co/J2KBcrWAkW
@SimerRobert @drawandstrike This is all propaganda. Complete nonsense
@katgal2 @Amy_Siskind @NBCNightlyNews Yes it is. Her candidacy provided an opportunity for their to be a candid discussion around the millions of dollars the Bachmanns made with this snake oil abuse of vulnerable teens and others. Conversion therapy should be illegal.
@NBCNightlyNews There is another term appropriate for “ conversion therapy “. It is CHILD ABUSE.  Here in Utah there is a suicide epidemic caused in part over sexual shaming of LDS teens and failed conversions. Imagine Dragons, Dan Reynolds has a Sundance doc on this tragic reality
@rainpanda By me. In the saddle in Iceland
@HandRC405 @tripgabriel Which he regretted the rest of his life and likely had much to do with his fathers business associates. He received wide praise from Jewish leaders during his presidency.

@debb_imm That is a 45 Star Utah statehood flag from 1895. It’s a medallion wreath pattern of stars. The current configuration want set until 1912
@esglaude holy guacamole. What a fraud
@Amy_Siskind The Russian propaganda machine opens a new front in their misinformation war against American institutions.  They are all in for the Chairman of the Intelligence committee who is pedaling wild conspiracy theories aimed at discrediting a vital intelligence agency , the FBI .
@NBL2006 The board should vote immediately to waive the non disclosure requirements
‘Worse than our own worst fears’: USOC apologizes to Team USA for Larry Nassar’s abuse. The call for the entire USGT board  to resign is appropriate.   Who know what and when is essential.  https://t.co/vaaMOU4Nng
@BillKristol Holy-Moly ! What a fraud
@MalcolmNance Modern day Mcarthyism. At the same time there are demands for Political arrests emanating from right wing media.
@PhilipRucker The abuse happened in multiple jurisdictions. State Attorney Generals should assert jurisdiction. This story should not fade. It should move to the governing bodies including the USOC and NCAA.  The corporate sponsors should be forced to demand accountability.
There should be a US Olympic committee mandated independent investigation about who knew what //when. Congress should assert jurisdiction in this matter and investigate. Seems like there should be many more resignations.  The fallout from this abuse should be growing. Total fail
A terrorist attack targeting CNN was averted. Thank God. It was bad enough before, but the next time this President or any one in his WH engages in attacks on the FAKE NEWS AS ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE they do so with the full knowledge that the blood will be on their hands next time
@mmfa This is what the American version of the propaganda that followed the Reichstag fire looks like.  Demands to lock up opponents in the name of state security. Denunciations of hidden conspiracies and the plots from within.  Scapegoating of racial minorities.  Fidelity to the ldr.
@RawStory I get it. Excited and over stimulated after reopening government following the imbecilic shut down, Wicker decided to role play some scenes from next seasons Handmaids Tale.
@DisciplesPoker Also predicted trump would be the nominee when he came down the escalators
@katieg327 @NicolleDWallace Park city UT
@AynRandPaulRyan This is a moral outrage. Terrible.
@davidaxelrod These television ads placed by team Trump are a full and complete embrace of the spirit of George Wallace. Disgraceful. Republicans would be smart to study the political fallout for the GOP in Ca after Prop 187 in 1994. It led to political obliteration
@SamuelBernstein Extraordinary lack of any informed discussions about national security   Taking place in our everyday political discourse. This is essential question in national life has disappeared from the political debate
Losing our competitive edge against potential adversaries. This government shutdown illuminates the ineptitude of the White House and Majority in the Congress and makes the country look like a banana republic on the Global stage. Our Trumpian crisis makes us look weak
What specifically are the threats to peace?  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff basically just said the malfeasance and ineptitude of the Congress when it comes to establishing a rationale budget process has done damage to war fighting readiness. Mattis said we are 3.
Of the end of the War on Terror in its’ 17th year?  What is the current global deployment of the Armed Forces engaged in anti-terror operations?  What is the cost of those operations against the total budget? What is it precisely that we are preparing for?  2.
The Secretary of Defense said the following on Friday “ We will continue to prosecute the campaign against the terrorists that we are engaged in today, but great power competition, not terrorism, is the focus of US national security” Was that it ? Was that the announcement ( 1.)
The Senate and House Commerce Committees have previously asserted jurisdiction around the USOC , IOC and other corrupted sports federations. The Chairman and ranking members of the Commerce Cmte should launch investigations .
@PuckerSjb You couldn’t be more right Karoli’s, USA Gymnastics Board, US Olympic Committee, NCAA, Michigan State ect. Who am I missing ?  Also Corporate Sponsors should be demanding facts. All of these people/groups have questions to answer
The board of USA gymnastics as well as the US Olympic committee should be under severe scrutiny in this shameful sexual abuse scandal. From the Karoli’s to the Board to the US Olympic committee I promise someone knew something.
There should be a thorough, independent investigation  into the culture of abuse at USA gymnastics headed by someone of impeccable stature like George Mitchell or Billy Jean King. ( insert others) 1/2
@lilithinzion I live in Park city.
The sexual abuse scandal at USA gymnastics is being under covered. Who knew what and when?  This includes both Karoli’s .  No American gymnast should be forced to train at a crime scene. USA gymnastics handling of this is atrocious
@danielggarza @AliVelshi @SRuhle Most corporate profits will be invested into capital improvements with specific focus on artificial intelligence; machine learning capabilities that displace workers.

Shame on everybody involved in the execution of this travesty
@SarahNoah9 @HuffPost I’m offended this professional toady and lackey is the Secretary of Homeland Security. It is a job she is as unqualified and unfit for. Quite a downgrade from Ridge, Chertoff, Napolitano and Johnson.

@imillhiser Completely inappropriate from an Assistant to the President of the United States.  None of this is too small. It all matters.  The assault on ethics is not normal in a healthy democracy.

Together to deliver a message to the world that the American people will defend our Republic and the inheritance bequeathed to us by previous generations. A righteous anger is building in this country and it must be channeled in to the 2018 elections. Enough.  Defeat them all
The corrupted, rotten and complicit Republican majority that is abetting this Presidents damage to our institutions, national security and domestic tranquility must face electoral anhialation.  A massive coalition of Democrats, independent and appalled Republicans must come 3.
Repudiation of Trumpism. Fire is part of the natural life cycle of the forest. It destroys the forest but also purifies and renews it so that the cycle of life can begin again. So it must be for the Trump-Republican party.  Only through repudiation and defeat can it be renewed 2.
The Trump faction in America accounts for between 32-36 percent of voters. The overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens are aghast at the racism, malevolence, chaos and corruption of this administration.  November 2018 will present an opportunity to deliver a massive 1/3
The debasement of the office of the President of the United States of America is a tragedy.  Trump has stained our national honor with his overt and unabashed racism. The people defending him on TV look like fools
Enjoyed getting to spend some time speaking with a friend of mine this morning. He works his ass off as a doorman at a Manhattan hotel.  He is an immigrant from Ghana and a US citizen. His son is finishing college and getting ready to begin officer candidate school in the army
@Plain_Loco @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace It would definitely be Wallace -schmidt
@jbarro Off shore drilling is as politically catastrophic in Florida as it is in California. This is about 2020 politics.  Trumps biggest problem in Florida are the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rican’s who have moved to the state and won’t soon forget Trumps deadly incompetence
@Lawrence A mall Santa 10 months away from the next gig
@pnehlen @AnnCoulter You are a Nazi scumbag. I’m looking forward to Paul Ryan kicking your ass in the primary. I’m going to block you in a moment because I believe the only good Nazi is a dead one.

@advicern @CillizzaCNN McClintock is beatable in CA 4 but not top of the list vulnerable. A smart race could take this career politician/carpetbagger out.
@CillizzaCNN There is going to be a GOP congressional wipeout in California in 2018. Turnout will be driven by the Gov race which will be between two Dems.  This further depresses GOP turnout

@kaitlancollins What a profoundly stupid thing to say. They have sacrificed NOTHING for this country. They have rendered no discernible service to America.  Not public, philanthropic or military.  They serve themselves and their self interest-nothing more. Privileged, entitled and delusional
@KFILE “Magnificent in meanness. Contemtible in cuisine”.               That was Lincoln’s private secretary, John Hays, description of the Willard Hotel in 1864. Seems a perfect description for Trumps Maro Lago in 2018.
Trump’s military option for North Korea is not an option https://t.co/0w45h6CpOc. Take the time to read this. I think it is the singularly most important thing that was written today.
@JoyAnnReid Maybe it’s what you call a situation where a mentally addled President is petted, stroked and flattered by a sycophantic staff in public that denounces him as crazy in private and acknowledges that they in fact are making the decisions that matter. Just spitballing
@thatbillokeefe Perfect !  Maybe he can show up in one of the Red Robes that judges from Nazi Germany wore
@LongsPeak14259 @AnnCoulter They both like to read so I’m not worried
@unhipcat @EricBoehlert @AnnCoulter She reminds me so much of the Nora Desmond character from Sunset Boulevard. Old, tired and delusional about her relevancy.  She literally is without a single accomplishment of any meaning in her professional life.  Just another bearded lady in the toxic circus that is our culture
@peld41 @AnnCoulter She is a grifter and a scammer
@AnnCoulter Because I have two daughters I appreciate Ann Coulter. Coulter stands as a shining example of everything I hope  they will not be.  Coulter is nasty, cruel, vicious and racist.  She has accomplished nothing of meaning-ever and she has stained and harmed the fabric of America
@GAKechnie @jonathanalter @jaketapper Yes
@GaryRGamble @MSNBC The congressional investigations have been corrupted by the GOP majority. They are a side show. The action is with Mueller. No one who is opposed to Trumps assaults on the rule of law and Banana Republican chants of “lock her up” should be patient with this impt. investigation
@jonathanalter @jaketapper It is an interview that confirms the thesis of the book. Thanks to Jake Tapper we saw the key staff requirement. Complete obedience and servility to POTUS’s giant fragile ego. Potus received his ego massage from a peerless sycophant. His ego was massaged the way Wagyu cattle are.
@MSNBC Yes. They are.
@RobertWWatkins @SenJohnMcCain Was an incredible honor to serve on a senior staff in the WH. Any body who ever has had that honor is aghast at this disgrace

The mendacious Attorney General who  is reported to have ordered a political smear of the FBI director presides over a Justice Department that has opened up a Fox News, Breitbart, Alex Jones  mandated, Banana Republican criminal investigation of the Presidents frmr opponent. 1/2
The same people who are claiming the book isn’t true are the very same who: 1.  Claimed Trumps crowd size was bigger than Obama’s 2. Claimed millions voted illegally 3. And helped Trump claim it wasn’t him on the Access Hollywood tape .
The servile lap-doggery and personal debasement of the Vice President and Cabinet (Mattis not included) with their public displays of sycophancy towards Trump are even more detestable given the Wolff book.
@BillKristol How about never forgiven. What they have done to this country and our politics is contemptible.

2/2. With few exceptions (Baier, Smith, CW)FNC has become a vessel of propaganda and misinformation, large numbers of elected GOP officials are assaulting vital US institutions and engaged in conspiracy mongering. Trump vs.Bannon shines a light on the deadly dysfunction in the WH
Iran,Saudi,Pakistan,North Korea. The world boils while Trump engages in digital McCarthyism with his “deep state” conspiracy nonsense, attacks the concept of objective truth and a free press and blusters about Nuclear War. The GOP majority has abdicated its Article 1 duties 1/2

@FallingOffEarth That’s not why I called you Trumpian. Obviously you cannot accommodate the hate and other noxious elements of the Trump coalition. They must be opposed, defeated and discredited.
@LisaTJohansen I would argue that the foundation of that plan for the future can be found in our past. There are wise voices and important messages that reach out to us from across the ages.  They can help us understand our duty and light the way

@IngaZorin111 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I thought about it for a minute as requested. On second thought I did not disparage Huckabees abject historical ignorance enough.     Churchill was many things. A bone spur type of guy he was not .
@oliverdarcy The Schilling standard seems to be  that it is ok 👍 to be a fascist so long as you appropriately conceal your true beliefs. The wink and nod to white supremacists and  perverse game of footsie between Trump, Breitbart and white nationalists( Neo nazis) needs to be talked about.
@NatashaBertrand @Twitter @jack @TwitterSupport This is a “Law Enforcement Official” ( I use the term loosely) inciting violence. This is what right wing political thuggery looks like. Anybody who thinks we are immune to this cancer in America needs to wake up

Free advice for Reumps cabinet. If he ever offers a cup of cool aid at the meeting don’t drink it.
The appalling sycophancy led by the Vice President at yesterday’s cabinet meeting is an affront to our Democratic norms. The President should not be venerated by his cabinet the way a pack of miscreant cronies would bow and scrape to an autocrat leading a banana republic.
@MiaFarrow Utah can do better than an 83 year old sycophant who has been in Congress for 40 years after winning an election in 1976 with the tag line “ what do you call a Senator who has been in Washington for 18 years?  You call him home”

@pragmaticNYC I agree with you at a high level. If we were in congress together I would be very flinty with the tax payer dollar and focused on spending. However, once the decision to spend is made you have to pay for it. We tax at about 18% of gdp and spend at 21%

@Elise_Jordan The projection of force by the state must be carried out by a lawful military which has allegiance to the Constitution and the people.  What Prince proposes is dangerous in a democratic republic. It should be debated and vociferously opposed

Serious question. Should Roy Moore win, will the Sergeant  at Arms and the Sec. of the Senate take any specific actions to protect the minor US Senate page’s from a credible accused serial child molester.?  What about the organization that gives accreditation to the Page school?

@chrislhayes The United States Senate has gone completely off the rails.  Lobbyists are writing the bill in secret and duly elected Democratic US Senators have no idea what's in it. The corruption of what used to be the worlds greatest deliberative body is a tragedy.

When Ty Cobb says there is nothing to see here remember he is the same guy who says this investigation will be wrapped by Christmas. Delusion tends to have a constancy to it
@djbeema @SirEdmundBurke They are not remotely analogous.
When GOP Senators vote for this Tax bill and pay for it with almost 2 trillion in new debt on the national credit card it means that everything everyone of them has ever said about spending was simply performance theater.  Plus for millions of Americans it's a tax HIKE
The tax cut has a 25% national approval level. The GOP Frenzy to pass "something" and have a "win" shows how cloistered and profoundly out of touch the average GOP member has become in the hermetically sealed, donor funded D.C. "BUbbletopia".  Nov 18 comes soon

There isn't one single GOP Senator who could forthrightly and competently answer this question--- What is it that you are voting for ? They have 0 idea. None
Every Republican member who has spoken passionately about out of control spending or the importance of a return to the regular order who votes for this appalling Tax  bill was simply conning the American people .
This tax bill demonstrates,once again, the total collapse of all and any rigor around the policy making process in the GOP congress.  It is built on a foundation of lies.  It adds more than a trillion to the debt. No real conservative should vote for this
@carlbildt Donald Trump has stained the honor of the United States of America.

@Acosta Yet another moment of disgrace for this President. Trump degrades his office by standing next to the murderer Duterte .  He assaults America's values by laughing  at the attacks on a free American press. Shame.
@no2libs007 I'm quite comfortable with my point and quite calm.
Roy Moore , Pedophile, bigot  and all around extremist nut job is now behind Doug Jones in multiple polls. There is to much defeatism in the air over Jones'chances. Dems, Independents and enough R's can say NO to a Pedophile in the US Senate
Every GOP Member of Congress should be asked about Trump's Putin fetish and his disparagement of the US Intelligence community from foreign shores.  The answer to this and the Moore question will be illuminating.
The Fascist march in Poland should receive significant world wide media attention. 60,000 people is a frighteningly large number.

@john_sipher Absolute must read piece
@SaraMurray Fool is precisely what every world leaders think of the President of the United States. Taking the word of the Russian autocrat against the evidence processed by our IC. Reckless, ignorant, incompetent and easily manipulated. That's what they see in Trump
@davidaxelrod @CheriJacobus Republican elected officials have largely made this choice.  As Paul Ryan said , "We're with Trump". How many GOP Voters will inflict electoral punishment on the complicit cowards remains in the air.

@twobridgesmgmt Which is important to know for 2018. 100 percent of the D's, 65 % of the independents and 25 percent of the Republicans are going to form a righteous tidal wave that cleans out this toxic, cancerous rat nest.
Every Alabama Republican who processes an ounce of decency will vote for Doug Jones on December 12th. Every GOP member of Congress with an ounce of decency will 1. unendorse 2. demand no party money is spent. 3.refuse to caucus with Moore 4. Call for Moore to drop out.

@bethmyers201 @katiepack Orrin Hatch has had a long career. I hope he will retire so Mitt Romney can run for the Senate. The GOP needs a figure of towering rectitude, probity and decency to be in the fight as the party descends into a moral abyss.

Roy Moore is a sick man. He is a pedophile. This story is deeply sourced. It is credible and I believe the women.
I'd like to see Roy Moore take a polygraph. All spending by the national party and affiliated superpacs should cease immediately. Every D.C. PAC should demand return of their donations.

Mr. Speaker, Please read the Bannon interview.  He frames a choice that you must address. He essentially calls for the repudiation of 1/3
The Bannon interview is nuts.  It's also insubordinate and contemptuous of the President, the National Security Adviser and Sec of State

@jefftompkins Ashcroft savaged by left when nominated. Conducted himself as AG with unquestioned integrity
@bennie2128 impeccable choice along with Meyers and Pace. Tremendous seriousness and integrity.
@ericgmerten @GenMhayden he would be great. Michelle Flournoy , Ted Olsen
@deerhodson he was a very effective Governor of the 8 th largest economy of world
@DylanDevenyi Hadley would be great.
@thestustein @PreetBharara yes excellent pick
Some more.  Bob Kerrey, John Ashcroft, Stan McChrystal, Ray Odeirno, Tom Ridge, Bill Cohen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Daley, Richard Haas
Some co chair names for independent commission on Russia. [ no order ] James Baker , Panetta , Gates , Jim Webb, Powell , C Rice, B. Bradley
If Nunes conduct does not meet threshold for recusal what behavior possibly could ? Schiff statement spot on. Looks like rare DC adult
The idea that disclosing the person who cleared Nunes into WW/EEOB compromises sources and methods vital to national security is absurd.
@tedlieu @CheriJacobus to grasp .No understanding of sep. of powers ?No concept of oversight role of Congress?His credibility is shattered
@tedlieu @CheriJacobus serious question?  What the hell is wrong with Nunes?Does he not grasp the concept of a conflict? Ineptitude hard 1/2

@SecherNbiw Less than 100 days in Dems are unified and fired up. GOP and Trump coalition have cracked up over the Number one issue
Will be interesting to see how long it takes Wall Street to figure out the domestic agenda fueling the rally isn't actually going to happen
HOUSE GOP message of " We need more time to learn to govern " is not where I think they were hoping to be heading into First week of April
POTUS party has lost seats in first midterm in all but three elections over the last 116 years
Trump voters will not blame Democrats or Trump. They will blame the House GOP.  This is a political disaster for Congressional GOP
@politikale of course not. They have been talking about this for seven years.!!!
The first hundred days are shaping up as a historic debacle.
The repeal of ObamaCare on day one scam will go down as one of the greatest broken promises of all time.. Truly amazing .
listening to Speaker Ryan Sounds like the GOP congress is going to get a participation ribbon and effort trophy."Governing is Hard!" 2018

@kurteichenwald @PamelaMauriell1 reviewed by whom ? What does that even mean. He is a US citizen. Who contacted him?  What agency ?
Support for POTUS increasingly requires obedience to the idea that what the leader believes is truth. Dangerous concept in healthy system
US Institutions lack the basic trust levels to communicate clearly when this 45 days of chaos yields to the inevitable disaster.
Performance by WH spokespeople this AM was an abomination.  Out of the loop, dishonest , conspiratorial and obedient to a smear by POTUS
The collapse of trust in core US Institutions is a real crisis. This issue will need to be at the center of campaign 2020
@NicolleDWallace Pure propaganda by a WH spokesperson. Every WH spokesperson has shattered their credibility.Dishonesty and delusion.
The ambassador didn't take the chance to ask a top Trump advisor about the number one story in the world ? Really ?  Not believable ?
Sessions claim that he did not discuss campaign with Russian Amb is not credible .  The ambassador didn't ask how it was going ? Ridiculous
@melissavotes great movie!

I wonder what would happen to the captain of The Aircraft carrier POTUS visited if he woke up this morning and began crazy tweeting ??
@21412USA detaining an American citizen and asking about their religion
@21412USA nope. I was running Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Won by 18 points in a year GOP was wiped out
The last time GOP lost control of the house was 2006. D's nationalized the election against an unpopular POTUS +congressional corruption
I have served at senior levels on two POTUS campaigns.  Won one and lost one but no one on either one was talking to the Russians .
Any member of congress that does not think the Russia issue deserves serious investigation is putting partisanship over country
@CheriJacobus has there been any tic toc reporting on this ?
@JoshTewsley faces.  Kentucky is an interesting state. Increasingly red but with a history of dem govs nunn, fletcher Bevins only Gopers

@internetrambo obviously not. Ali is a us citizen. The govt has no right and no authority to question him about his religious faith
@litknitgrit if I was asked by CPB to present papers while deplaning on a domestic flight I would refuse and I would be readyto be arrested

@ricker1967 @dcaraviello are you troubled by a US citizen detained for hours and questioned about his religious faith ? Is that ok with you?
Ali story should trigger wide spread media coverage, a law suit and congressional oversight. Absolute abuse of power by CPB.
WH correspondents dinner should be refocused to a celebration of the First amendment. These freedoms came at great cost. Celebrate them .
The freedoms of the press, speech and religion are inexorably linked.  FIRST amendment for a reason. Time for a national civics lesson
There should be tremendous focus on demanding accountability for the Ali outrage. It is illegal . Govt " no comment" is not ok.

NO American President has EVER comported themselves like this. Endless self pity , Dishonest assertions and scapegoating .
@MSNBC absolutely a 100 percent truthful statement .
@jessicarogers72 tomorrow!
@brhodes it's beyond laughable. His Russia ties are long and deep
23 days of constant lying by the WH means their account/s have 0 credibility. None .  That is why there must be real Senate investigation

@lakeshorejimmy Don't feel shame . But remember you get a clean slate in four years

Now I understand WH policy. LIE to POTUS//VPOTUS -YOU'RE fired.!  LIE TO AMERICAN PEOPLE --GOOD JOB!!!!!!!
@Chiara09 @VFHIVE I think we will learn that it was he plays a big role in this removal
@Chiara09 @VFHIVE  I don't buy it
GOP congress has an obligation to investigate this matter .  Refusal to do so is a betrayal of their duty and oaths .

@sbepstein Great movie. Who is the Trump Eva Braun ?  she was the life of the bunker !!
@tjd29991 corrupt is the wrong word. Politicized. And being politicized like this is inherently corrupting. Not good. We don't do this inUS
@tjd29991Lynch on plane outlandish. Comey even worse. Can disagree on politics but this stuff is bad. Very very very bad .
@TheSpringChickn Comey should pi country ahead of ego and resign. He lost control of the Bureau. No moral authority to lead
@djolder Daniel !  I hope more then once !
@ExecCounselAust Thanks Jeanette. The US Australia bilateral relationship transcends elections. great respect to Oz .
@stuartpstevens only thing missing from this story was a white cat in his lap while he was plotting his revenge
@murphymike nothing trumps the bias for conflict
@ctvqp said GOP would lose house seats. 10 to 15 but retain the majority.

@davidbewart going to work hard on being a light heavyweight when the election is over !!  Best to you
@LiberalPhenom with desire for change .  His numbers are high because of his bearing and dignity compared to the disgrace of this election
@LiberalPhenom with DJT. Shared belief in rigged system. One set of rules for people at top. Different from bottom. Don't mix up POTUS fav
@LiberalPhenom I think it's a bit more complicated then that. Hard to make point in 140 words but look at sanders voters.  Much in common
@THEToughCookie here I am. Hi !
@BobinBay never ?  How about when I was about the first analyst on tv to say Teump should be taken seriously ?  Could win , was winning ?
@51Allgood I'm fantasizing about getting to debate you for 30 minutes about the GOP , it's history and future. How do you think you would do
@KeystonePundit no one will ever no your name. Why do you attack gay people. ?  Self loathing would be my guess
@DrPelt nice spelling.!
@kikiallus worth fighting for.
@kikiallus fact. Never made a dime working for McCain. Volunteer .  Opposite mercenary   I love the GOP. It is an IMPT inst
@Goosifer01 only oath I've ever taken was to the constitution of the United States .  I look forward to fighting the alt right cancer
@51Allgood ran the confirmation process for those great liberals Roberts and Alito. !
@rightvoicenow What does the purge look like. You thinking reeducation camp ? More old school concentration camp or summary execution ?
@jacobmathews Orcas should not be held in captivity. Here is what they look like in the wild. British Columbia #supernatural https://t.co/tfdxb7v9y3
@Cyninbend lighten up Cynthia. Did you listen to what she said today ?  Accidental ? Coincidental ?dont  think so !  Open your Mind to msg

@NicolleDWallace and yes he likes to throw people. !!
@NicolleDWallace You know I love that Horse !
@TADAD2001 it's terrific. grants memoirs, written as he was dying and edited by mark twaine are the best ever by a President
@EBOlady hi. It is me. No parody acct
@RalstonReports Jon , national media CW is DJT can win NV. Looks very very very narrow to me ??
@alisseytwit I'll be on Brian Williams at 11 pm tonight and with Stephanie Ruhle tomorrow .  Just returning to the states from overseas
@RalstonReports Jon Ralston is the best state focused analyst / reporter in American politics.
@jayrosen_nyu @NicolleDWallace this is far outside the boundaries of normal in American politics.
@jayrosen_nyu @NicolleDWallace  Yet another assault on foundational pillars of American democracy. intimidation towards a free press is bad
@jayrosen_nyu @NicolleDWallace Katy Tur is a smart , tough , classy professional journalist. This is not bullying. It is thuggery.
@BrettLoGiurato @jbarro Neither the Republican or Democratic candidates should have appeared with Duke. They should have found new forum
@EJP_2012_CPA about the first to say trump could win ,was winning and would win in the primaries. Going to be a long night for you tues
@IrishGreens1 good we agree. No room for the alt right in the GOP :  we must be clear and strong on that point or the GOP will die
@IrishGreens1 reading is tough for you ? I said there can be no alliance which is what is happening now. They must be expelled and confronte
@politico2016 @politico Between these cancerous groups and the Republican Party and the conservative movement. This is a fight worth having
@politico2016 @politico This is actually happening in real life in America in 2016. There can be no alliance,no coalition , no common cause
@ezta_lavista Thanks Ezta. It was great getting to visit Singapore and Jakarta to talk US elections .  Starting the long flight home !
RT @ezta_lavista: Learning something new everyday in #EdelmanID breakfast session with Steve Schmidt https://t.co/pR4BXJISHv
@politico McMullen has a real shot in Utah.
@politico Can't tell you how happy I am to live in a state with an option that includes a genuine conservative and a real American hero.
@GRYKING @matthewjdowd Post fact America. !
@johnreina79 it's me!
@MJosephSheppard @MalShelbourne downward pressure on her since the race became focused on her. I think the floor is 324/ceiling 350ish
@stuartpstevens @hwaadt Think of it as an alternate reality delusion sphere that his heading towards a collision with reality at warp speed
@CBSNews the qualities of gentleness and kindness are alive and well in America if we open our eyes. What an impressive young lady.
@EBOlady it is
@EBOlady hi. Here is my Twitter
@BenWils76397835 no
James Comey just unmasked himself https://t.co/X91BNgjUZM # via @HuffPostPol. Bingo. Howard Fineman hits the nail on the head.
@SpeakerRyan all true mr speaker. If u al had the guts to stand against this disgrace we would have won. Instead MjrLdr Schmr and --20 rep
@lpont117 question was what I would  do my hands are not on the wheel.
@BrianChinActor prosecute trumpism and don't panic .  Shut Harry Reid up .  People are tired and overreacting. Emails are baked in by now
@johnreina79 not a lot of hair to let down !
@jonathanchait IMPT piece of writing. Paints with too broad a brush at times and unfairly hits Reagan and Bush 43 but is more right then not
@NateSilver538 whomever the race has been about has had downward pressure on their ballot. Team D approach made the race about her not him
@NateSilver538 that seems right to me. Trended down when focus came off trumpism and expanded to down ballot pickups. She made it about her
@kingsthings @MittRomney I phone !  Live and McMullin
@kingsthings @MittRomney he loves in Utah. Bet he is voting for Evan McMillan
@johnreina79 mahi mahi , grouper and sailfish
@J_A_E_4 yes
@stuartpstevens @Airbnb @christinawilkie @realDonaldTrump but an enormous strain at Laguardia.
@LaurenNapier Believe me !  Doesn't feel great. If you come to Singapore and go fishing you can't put too much sun screen on. !
@mattyglesias think you mean j Edgar
@Shgladd it was but if you watched it or read the book it is pretty clear I was after the fact when it came to her deficiencies.
@Shgladd the two authorities I was not given when taking over mccain were 1. Vp selection and 2. Vetting. Read the book. Pretty clear
@1776Libertarian I said she was trending towards 400. North of 350. I said dens would get senate and take a big bite out of house majority
@stuartpstevens @NYTnickc no sir it didn't.
3 TVs and No Food: Growing Up Poor in America https://t.co/Qoouj6dInN column and a must read.
@brianstelter by way of Anthony Weiner !
@jaketapper really outrageous. These men were Giants. Most members not so much. Move the bill Kevin McCarthy
@thehill sounds a lot like levin and trump--not !  One of the finest toughest journalists of her generation. Newt looked like a fool
@thehill will always eventually triumph, and there is purpose and worth to each and every life .
@thehill toxic Levin is the antithesis of Reagan. His grave stone reads " I know I'm my heart that man is good . That what is right will
@mattyglesias the question we should be debating is about what to do about blue collar jobs in an era of robotics , automation and AI .
@KFILE but at least he kept his promise to GOP voters to never let them down
@chrislhayes so I guess he would vote for Mussolini ?  What a profile in courage ! Constituents must be proud. !
@thehill DISGRACEFUL. He is a nut job .  He represents the Rot I have talked about
@denisermt always wondered if there is a prize for reading pinkalicious 1000x
@Danartman it's about 7.5 to 8. Big lead.
@httptwite @chrislhayes not giving advice. Giving analysis . Big difference
@jennerific713 it's me.
Trump TV’s First Nightly News Report Was Unwatchable—and Addictive https://t.co/qh9CHgtmlU via @thedailybeast Amazing !
@joanwalsh @amandacarpenter another must read today from Amanda Carpenter. The political cowardice will cost a great Deal.
My Former Republican Party - WSJ .  He is not alone .  https://t.co/6FJdGP82US
@Danartman yes. For sure
@armandodkos @SteveInBrooklyn I think that's right. The result she seeks is found through trump. Expanding the message may give gop lift
@SteveInBrooklyn @armandodkos that was what I said. Be aware of unintended consequence. What path has the best strategic result. ??
@SteveInBrooklyn @armandodkos pretty clear DJT focus had led to inevitable senate switch. Does this new focus keep that trend , stall it ?
@SteveInBrooklyn @armandodkos inevitable consequence of new focus is it makes the race about HRC as opposed to singularly about DJT.
@SteveInBrooklyn @armandodkos going onto other targets. 2 most unpopular candidates ever. The 1 who has been losing  is the 1 it is about.
@SteveInBrooklyn @armandodkos clear strategic shift. Focus has been on trump and trumpism. So has coverage .  Now focus coming off trump
@MatManz have a great evening. You seem lovely. Mom and dad and kids must be proud of you
@GolfFanPC @chrislhayes I've been trying. I have heard you all and have been doing some home speech therapy. Jersey. What can I say!
@1SquillionStars for many years. Signed a Supreme Court amicus Brief and believe in equality for everyone.
@1SquillionStars was proud to give a speech called the conservative case for gay marriage in 09. Worked with the ACLU on marriage equality
@Laurasenio the great bill Morgan is right !  My kids don't believe I once had hair. !  Be well
@Danartman she will be north of 350 ev's and trending towards 400. Your painting is great
@RoseTwete The name of the party is Democratic. I believe it is an institution worthy of respect
@1776Libertarian I'll do it and I hope you are right .   Not looking good in the senate + the house is getting dodgy
@NancyCallan They are the best !
