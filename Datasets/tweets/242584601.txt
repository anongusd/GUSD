We thank each and everyone of you who have supported QCYD and this board from the start. We look forward to the year ahead and working together to strengthen the 2018 ​#BlueWave
The role of QCYD's Communications Director will be left vacant.
QCYD is now one of the only chapters in New York State led by women, and we are extremely proud Queens is at the forefront of progress.
The Board has motioned to approve @BreeanaMulligan, elected as Communications Directorlast month, to fill in the role of Executive Vice President of QCYD.
.@dapliska, elected as Executive Vice President last month with the rest of the board, will now	take on the role as President of QCYD.
It is unfortunate that we announce that due to personal reasons, Adrian Drepaul has resignedas President of QCYD. We are saddened to say goodbye to Adrian, and we thank him for hisyears of service + dedication to the organization.
Last month, you all gathered to voice your unwavering support for us, the #QueensTogether	team. Although it was an uncontested election, we are grateful to each and every one of youwho came to vote for us, the next generation of Queens County Young Democrats.
