Couldn't agree with @BillGates more.  There are a lot of important pieces to the climate puzzle https://t.co/Hm9z594zo9.  Wind and solar are only a couple of them.
To put in baseball terms - we hit singles, doubles &amp; even a triple or 2 toward addressing climate and a cleaner economy just this Congress. I’d rather get on base and score some runs now than constantly strike out while swinging for the fences. Couldn’t be prouder of our efforts
Thankfully, these positive steps often earned broad support across the ideological line and I expect that to continue for our clean energy agenda in the next Congress regardless of which party is in control.
#45Q, #45J, Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, major hydro reform, accelerated energy storage R&amp;D and record clean innovation investments were all done just this year. Other plans such as @lisamurkowski’s #NELA2018 and @SenJohnBarrasso's USE IT Act also wait in the wings
These and other Republicans were among those leading a SIGNIFICANT set of actions this Congress to incentivize a cleaner economy. They -and we - are in the technology-push camp and are getting things done
The GOP clean energy leaders -including those ClearPath endorsed - who voters wisely are sending back to Congress will be needed now more than ever to continue championing aggressive AND pragmatic policies that expand clean AND reliable power
As the administration's critical ongoing review of the #nuclear power sector continues, just a friendly reminder of what we at ClearPath are calling NuclearVision, a set of ideas I'm helping bring to the table as part of @ENERGY's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee

So glad that Vogtle survived yesterday's vote to continue build out. Way to go @SouthernCompany!  So critical for keeping the nuclear supply chain going as companies like @NuScale_Power start building their reactor!

Stop Prioritizing Solar and Wind Energy Over Nuclear Power | US News Opinion -https://t.co/ma41aKZ1o9 - AGREED!
Another good article on CCS (carbon capture and storage) - https://t.co/DZEm5RKvQW - it's way to early to give up.
If we just shut down U.S. coal, we make it substantially tougher for U.S. to innovate in cleaner energy technologies https://t.co/yC7bOVdt0I

I have no idea what to expect from our presumptive nominee on clean energy - https://t.co/Zw7wDNCwD1 - but I'm sure our platform would help.
One more thing on CCS (carbon capture and storage), it's still early days.  We need to keep innovating into better and cheaper technology.
If we are serious about carbon emissions, we have to capture carbon (from coal and gas) cheaply -  https://t.co/52BXmZ1C6f - it's doable
