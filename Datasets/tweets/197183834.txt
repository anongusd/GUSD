EPA's carbon proposal says implementation of partial capture CCS tech is the "best system of emissions reduction" under the Clean Air Act
New coal plants would still need to install carbon capture and storage tech to meet the retooled EPA standard, despite it being more lenient
CO2 limit of 1,000 lbs/MWh for new large gas units. New coal plants must meet 1100 lbs/MWh standard. Slightly more lenient than 1st proposal
