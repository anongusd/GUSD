it wasn’t pretty but it’s a win. A very necessary win. 		Tonight is the night I changed my mind about Akinjo. His energy, his take no bullshit attitude &amp; that freshman cockiness powered Georgetown. Nobody else brings that. 	#HoyaSaxa  @GeorgetownHoyas

Deja vu all over again...congressional leaders sound confident they’ll be able to avert a govt shutdown. But Pres Trump could throw a wrench in the process. 		In December he said he would be “proud” to shutdown govt over border security. This time he says he won’t take the blame. https://t.co/eSPf3x56b2
Will there be another govt shutdown? 		"I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown. If you did have it, it’s the democrats fault. And I accepted the first shutdown. But  I don’t expect it to happen," the president says (per pooler @PeterAlexander)

RT @benyc: .@SenSchumer: “Nobody should underestimate the Speaker as Donald Trump has learned.”
KEY LINE from Pres Trump was the last thing he said:  		If he doesn't get a fair deal from Congress the government will either shut down again in 3 weeks or he will declare a national emergency to try and move money toward a border wall.
"No border security plan can ever work without a physical barrier," Pres Trump says. 		This is a LOT of wall talk from the President...as he announces a short term deal that we are told includes NO funding for a border wall.
Right out of the gate, Pres Trump talks to federal workers impacted by 35 day shutdown:		He thanks workers and their families for "such devotion in face of this recent hardship." 		"You are fantastic people...incredible patriots."

Ford is talking in very personal terms about what she says she went through, how it has stayed with her. 		But she's also speaking in scientific terms about that experience, her memories and trauma.
So much said ahead of this hearing about Ford’s credibility, how convincing she would be.  		Wash Post wrote last wk Ford “garnered a reputation for her research on depression, anxiety and resilience after trauma.” 		At times Ford seems to be acting as her own expert witness

President Trump is facing backlash for not highlighting John McCain’s service to the country, the short period the WH flag first flew at half staff and for ignoring Qs today about McCain’s legacy.		Our recap &amp; where things stand now: https://t.co/MVLCU5Tfd9
2 men arrested in connection to the murder of a 10 year old girl in Washington DC. 		Makiyah Wilson's killing - as she went to buy ice cream - shocked and horrified a city that has seen 101 homicides so far in 2018. https://t.co/ikOLTxQRmq
Pres Trump also says that at the request of the McCain family, he authorized military transportation of McCain’s remains from AZ to DC, military pallbearers and band support, and a horse and caisson transport during the service at the Naval Academy.
MORE: Trump says he has asked VP Pence to speak at ceremony for McCain at the Capitol Friday. 		The president says he has asked John Kelly, Defense Secretary Mattis &amp; National Security Advisor Bolton to represent the administration at McCain's services.  (doesn't say which ones)
NEW-statement from Pres Trump on McCain		“Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain’s service to our country and, in his honor, have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment.” https://t.co/XDAkssrk3S

President Trump's 1-on-1 meeting with Pres Putin lasted more than 2 hours (scheduled for 90 minutes). 		At the beginning of a working lunch, he gave no hint of what they spoke about. 	 	"I think it's a good start, a very good start for everybody."
FaceTimed my kids in between @ABCNewsRadio live two-ways. 		Their big Qs:	-have you seen any reindeer? (No-it's 80 degrees)		-have you seen Olaf from Frozen? (No and that movie was supposed to be set in Norway)
My smart colleague @chrisdonovan reminds me of this Trump tweet from 2012		"Putin has no respect for our President --- really bad body language."		https://t.co/v61LXD7zFa https://t.co/rXzYus4iE3
The body language of Pres Trump &amp; Pres Putin is fascinating to observe-I'll leave it to the experts to say what it means.		Trump is leaning forward, tapping his finger tips together as he listens, talks. Putin is slouching in his chair, one arm leaning on the arm rest.
