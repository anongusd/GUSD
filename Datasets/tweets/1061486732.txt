@JessicaValenti ...Maybe there is one difference.   Those planning the abortion are the ones who are supposed to be responsible for the safety and well being of the life they are ending.
@JessicaValenti There is no difference between planning an abortion and a serial killer planning their next attack.  Both are sociopaths intentionally and deliberately murdering the most defenseless and vulnerable...ok, maybe there is one difference...
@allidoisowen Yes.		Democrats only support criminals, deviants, noncontributors, and those sworn to destroy America.   The word democrat is synonymous with antisocial, delusional, and dishonest behavior.

@shaunduke @Hazbizzle @elethewaytobe @davidhogg111 ...every civilian class I've ever attended, in any state,at any time has always stated to not have a gun in your hand when police arrive.  It's standard training for every armed civilian to not have a gun in your hand when police arrive.   It's referred to as common knowledge.
@shaunduke @Hazbizzle @elethewaytobe @davidhogg111 I've worked armed security on a couple of occasions, in different states.  I've gone through executive protection training, private investigations training,  and been through CCW training in three states over the last 29 years...

@GretzStephen @realDonaldTrump In short, I'd apply that reasoning to judges who rule against the second amendment.
@GretzStephen @realDonaldTrump "Gun control" only benefits the criminal. It's a lie based on the delusion of entitlement, that requires the belief of inanimate objects demonstrating intent and volition.
@GretzStephen @realDonaldTrump Serious answer.  Show me one gun in the 700 year history of guns that has ever caused a death.  Rights cannot be legislated, any ruling against the second amendment is unconstitutional.
@NorfolkWomble Please, show me a single gun, in the history of guns, that has ever hurt anyone.  Please, show me a single person, in the history of guns, that has ever been hurt by a gun.
@realDonaldTrump Courts should be held liable for their decisions. They should be held culpable for any damages or crimes committed as a result of their judgement.
@PhlawlessPharm @AmySwearer @mackattack0108 Dear heavens.  There's no such thing as gun violence.  Say it with me...Inanimate objects are incapable of action or intent. Guns are inanimate objects and as such are incapable of violence. Guns cannot be violent. 		How many times and in how many ways does it have to be said!

@ShawnDorschner @ChrisLoesch @benshapiro @DLoesch @KayHansenMMA Easy stretch, nobody said anything about murder. I do think its "ok" to defend yourself even if it means shooting your attacker in the face.		The word democrat is synonymous with antisocial behavior, sociopaths,  psychopaths, and entitled little bitches.  Sorry, thought you knew.
@ShawnDorschner @ChrisLoesch @benshapiro @DLoesch @KayHansenMMA ...gun control only benefits the criminal, its basic biology that predators target the weakest &amp; most defenseless prey. It only allows the criminals to target the weakest &amp; poorest members of society. Disarming the most vulnerable only allows for easier exploitation by democrats
@ShawnDorschner @ChrisLoesch @benshapiro @DLoesch @KayHansenMMA There is no difference between the planning of an abortion and a serial killer planning their next attack.  Both involve the elements of sociopaths expressing entitlement to murder the most innocent and defenseless members of society they can find...
@ShawnDorschner @ChrisLoesch @benshapiro @DLoesch @KayHansenMMA It's not a paradox.  Both are centralized on the idea of protecting the innocent and defenseless from democrats.

@kimvallejo @DrLeanaWen @PPact I'll make it easy for you.  Gun control only benefits the criminals.  Restrictions on the innocent are opportunity for exploitation by predators.  Predators always target the weakest, and in our society, so does gun control.
@kimvallejo @DrLeanaWen @PPact LOL really doubt you learned the law last  week.		Please explain how all those requirements benefits the widow on a fixed income on her way home from the pharmacy, or the single mom of three with the sociopath following her home from work.
@deneen_clary @JakeMcMeFace1 @AmandaPresto Gave enough information for the patient to be identified.This is not only a HIPPA violation but  against Acceptable use of social media policy of every hospital I've ever worked in. The question is, what other policies does he disregard to manipulate acceptance for his delusions
@jlburgess1987 @2shotOlympia @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen Not once, in the history of edged weapons, has anybody every been killed by a blade.  Never.  No one has ever been shot by a gun. Never.  Your premise is designed to be manipulative, it's meant to reinforce a delusion. The UK can not have a "knife crime problem".
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen ...What gives people trouble is the lack of understanding of what motivates criminals, how they select victims, &amp; what they perceive as a capable guardian.  Detractors tend to argue against it from their own point of view, without accounting for, or accepting the criminals view.
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen RAT states that three things are needed for a crime to occur. A likely offender, suitable target, and the absence of a capable guardian...
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen This is shown by behavior like driving by multiple movie theaters to shoot up the only one that's gun free.  		It's well articulated by criminals being interviewed concerning their victim selection process, what we call the interview.
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen Look deeper.  RCT basically states that a criminal will only commit crimes when they have a high expectation for success.  They measure success by ease of completion of their crime without discovery or injury...
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen It's common knowledge now that there are reduced instances of PTSD among victims who resist, fewer still among those who successfully defend themselves.   Add that to the knowledge that firearms are distance weapons that allow for psych/emotional disconnect from harm being caused
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen I'm glad you enjoyed the link on PTSD, I hope you can utilize it.		No , It doesn't mention guns, what it does mention is...	Identifying as a survivor as opposed to a victim	Use of positive emotion and laughter	Finding positive meaning in the trauma..
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen You're damn right I won't. I refuse to expect mercy, I'm unable to abandon responsibility for my own safety, and I always expect for predators to exploit any perception of weakness.  I'll keep my guns.
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen As expected, remember what I said about regrets?  I refrained from questioning your ability to extrapolate information, apply critical thinking, or to logically apply information.  Apparently,  you refused to process information in your search for an argument.
@jlburgess1987 @2shotOlympia @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen Since 1990, the number of legal guns in the US has increased almost 400%.	Since 1990, the number of violent gun crimes in the US has dropped almost 65% .	4 times more guns, 1/3 the violent crime.
@davidhogg111 It's only a delusion if it's not popular. 		I'll take, what's an inanimate object for $200 Alex.
@WhiteHouse Only 40 percent? Not believing it.  What helps no one is turning predators back on the street.  If you want to change it, quit giving repeated second chances, quit allowing judges to not be accountable for their decisions. Quit punishing the innocent by rewarding the criminals.
@WhiteHouse 8. Recognition of drug manufacturing,  trafficking,  and sales as predatory crime.	9. Reforming Correctional Facilities so that incarceration is actual punishment.

@jlburgess1987 @BillLiggan @DrLeanaWen It's apparent that there's many things you're unaware of.		For instance, you're obviously unaware of the irrelevance of your opinion there in England to my freedoms here in America.
@jlburgess1987 The argument was in response to your accusation that I was unable to to hear a victims response,and implication that all gunshot victims die from their wounds.
@PSC_MED @MrColionNoir Consider.  Vocalizing intent, directing officer and bystander attention to the offender.  Projecting in a command voice "watch them, dont shoot"  or "help me"...
@jlburgess1987 @areasonablegent @DrLeanaWen Forensics, victimology, criminology, and pathology are often able to give us a victims states of mind at the time they are murdered.  Defensive wounds, crime scene analysis,  and use of make shift weapons frequently tell us that victims prefer to have the ability to fight back.
@TomNwainwright @jlburgess1987 It's not a punchline, merely the presentation of facts in contrast to delusions.

@BillLiggan @jlburgess1987 @DrLeanaWen Weirdly, I'm never unarmed, and countless people are "still here" because I am, and a few despite it.  		It must be nice to live a life of such security that you can be critical of the ones who allow you the freedom to embrace your delusions.
@jlburgess1987 @DrLeanaWen More people live after being shot than die.  Even on a battlefield. Or a Democrat run city.
@LAKERMITCH @TheChatoff @KaitMarieox Or just one person willing to stop the shooter. Tools are force multipliers, a gun is tool used to extend the range of force.  You have to be willing to generate force before you can multiply it.
@TheChatoff @KaitMarieox It's not about the gun...6 off duty cops,  a navy vet, a Marine,  a Taekwondo instructor, along with 200 people and the skidmark wasn't stopped, arrested, or killed...he was found.  The "heroes" took advantage of a lull in the shooting to kneel between the shooter and the crowd.

@RealBrittHughes 100s of people crowded in the room, and the guys probably got to kill himself.  I'll never understand the level of cowardice accepted by todays society.  That Democrat should have been stomped into an unrecognizable puddle long before the first office responding hung up his cell.

@TheTarlaMakaeff @ACTBrigitte He was known by the police.  Used an illegal magazine, in a gun illegally carried, to illegally kill 12 people. https://t.co/qwKlkek8JA
@DetroitStrong01 @ShenanigansFL Yes Ma'am,  11 other innocent people, with families died as well.  In the end, the shitbag who killed them was found dead.  Not arrested, stopped, or killed, but found.  Sgt Helus was a hero, and did more more than the 100s of others on scene, but the gunman was found dead.
@DetroitStrong01 @ShenanigansFL ...time is damage.  One person, with the right mindset and minimal abilities would have changed the entire narrative.  I prefer to live by Graham's Killhouse Rules, they to rely on somebody, anybody else for safety.  I know who I am and what I'm capable of.
@DetroitStrong01 @ShenanigansFL Guys, you cannot get around the fact that it took the police 6 minutes to respond to the Borderline bar.  The officer who was killed, and this is not criticism, took the time to tell his wife he was responding to a call and that he loved her...
@catheri48080862 @MsAvaArmstrong And what about the 7 minutes before they arrive.  If they come at all.
@MsAvaArmstrong Don't threaten me with a good time.  I spent a lifetime doing bad things to bad people to protect people I didn't know and don't care about.		Threaten my family, I'll make Nietzsche's Total War look like a Disney classic.
@KaitMarieox 6 minutes, and nobody took this skidmark down?  6 minutes, in a room packed with people and this democrat gets to commit suicide.  It's not about guns.  It's about cowardice, entitlement, and ignorance.
@RealBrittHughes I wish some of these skidmarks would show up at my door...
@ShitIHearOnDuty @nowthisnews ...Both require escalation and a total commitment to being a grade A shitbag.
@ShitIHearOnDuty @nowthisnews ...there are only two ways to be convicted of a felony in todays courts.  Exhaust the system with repeated offenses that show a total disregard for others, or to commit an act that is "a shock to the conciousness"...
@ShitIHearOnDuty @nowthisnews It's funny how people act like you can be arrested, sentenced, and incarcerated for making a mistake or a bad choice.  It's hard to get a felony, it's hard to go to jail. It's called the Criminal Justice System for a reason.  Its designed to protect the criminal...

@RealBrittHughes Democrats have a long history of attacking the 1st and 2nd amendments.  Is anyone really surprised that they'd now assault the 5th and 14th.
@RealBrittHughes Don't threaten me with a good time.  The veil of civility is thin and heavy.
@zerogenamerican @bigricanman This is a witch hunt, not a job interview.	This is a public, personal attack without presumption of innocence.	This is another political attack on the bill of rights, &amp;an attempt to outmaneuver POTUS. 	This is a moral attack in support of sociopaths "right" to commit infanticide
@conservmillen That feeling of a pit in your stomach, is a sign that you are dealing with someone with Borderline Personality Disorder.
@conservmillen Personally, I don't care why.  The only thing I care about is does she have any proof to support the accusations she has publicly made.   		All I saw from her was evasiveness,  inconsistency, and a lack of commitment.

@_SJPeace_ LOL he was recognized.  He was a known thief, and was being checked for active warrants.  It's called "police work".  I know, I know both of those words are offensive to democrats who think "criminal rights" extend to uninterrupted criminal activities.   That's why they kneel.

@Graham5York @DarrenStrazek @BappleBusiness @davidhogg111 @NRA I think, he should either validate his statements with actual facts, sources, and verifiable sources to support them, which can't be done, or stop his communist ideology and propaganda.  David Hogg is a charlatan, and a pathological liar.  As far as better things...

@BappleBusiness @DarrenStrazek @davidhogg111 @NRA Maybe, if we required teachers to have an education and to achieve certifications instead of forcing them into the classroom at gunpoint, we would have some choose to be teachers and less that are forced into it.
@BappleBusiness @DarrenStrazek @davidhogg111 @NRA Yes, I know teachers in their first few years who are struggling, just as I know doctors, lawyers, plumbers, and carpenters, who have not worked their way into their full earning potential.  Key words there are "work" and "earning". "Teachers" as a collective are well  paid.
@BappleBusiness @DarrenStrazek @davidhogg111 @NRA You asked what was a lie.   Hogg stated "we can arm" that is a lie.  It's manipulating the ignorant into believing that we are arming teachers.  We don't want to arm them, to require them to be armed.  We want them to be allowed to be armed.  Big difference.

@SymoneDSanders "Toxic Masculinity" has the exact same meaning as "gender fluid", "tolerance and acceptance", "global warming", and "common sense gun control".  They all mean that the user has to rely on ignorance of their audience to manipulate for profit and dominance. Lies.  They're all lies.
@SymoneDSanders He killed her because he's an insignificant,  piece of human garbage who should have had long been dead.  Then kindred spirits advocate that it's a "race" issue; that democrat would've killed a black woman just as happily as he did a white woman.

@ShitIHearOnDuty Gun control is not about "illegal guns" it's about making guns illegal. It's a romanticized delusion of legislating morality, it's an illusion of safety at the expense of hard won freedom.   "Gun control" has a long and dismal history of inverse results.

@RealBrittHughes Can I use bad words in this thread?  It's really hard to talk about Acosta without using bad words.  I mean sometimes the only descriptive terms that really convey the intended effect is "F'ing Biotch".  Sometimes not even the word "democrat" is insulting enough.

@ShaunKing I've often heard inmates say how exhausting it was trying to avoid being arrested and how restful their jail time was because they didn't have to spend so much energy worrying about getting caught.  Funny, everything I hear from you reminds me of things I've heard inmates say.
@ShaunKing Maybe if you tried being honest? It's hard keeping up with all your delusions, lies, and entitlements.  Maybe if you tried earning something instead of constantly trying to manipulate others, you'd feel more accomplished and fulfilled...

@brianefallon The fact is that abortion is not respectable.  Sociopaths committing infanticide do not deserve respect.

@PhilBryantMS I've never in my life, any where I've been, ever seen an organization as inept, irresponsible, or disrespectful as @MissDPS. Absolutely, shameful, inexcusable behavior and conduct. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't experience it.

@AmandaMarcotte That's a whole lot of words to excuse and rationalize being a sociopath.  We oppose abortion because we believe its murder.  We don't "believe women should be forced", we believe people should want to be responsible for the sacred life they created and not want to choose murder.

@Winter8905 @Bigmoney1960 @DUBYA_BLOCKED @TheJimCornette @ChrisLoesch The "damage" comes from the intent of the criminal, not the weapon they use.  They choose the time and place that allows them to conduct whatever activities they've determined to do.  Again, it's about the job not the tool.
@Winter8905 @Bigmoney1960 @DUBYA_BLOCKED @TheJimCornette @ChrisLoesch LOL.  5.56mm/.223 cal.  Just for reference 9mm, .45 cal is 11mm, .40 cal is 10mm.  ARs do come in .308, 6.8, and .50 cal s well as some wild cat rounds, but predominantly they're 5.56mm.  About the size of one of the keys on your phones keyboard.

@GoldenGuido @dorsten_marsha @70s_Hope @Scaramucci @CNN @ChrisCuomo Again, it's not about their right.  It's about the disrespect, manipulation, entitlement, and general dumbassery of the protesting of dead criminals by disrespecting those who died in selfless sacrifice.   I get it, you don't know and can't understand.
@GoldenGuido @dorsten_marsha @70s_Hope @Scaramucci @CNN @ChrisCuomo This started with Trayvon Martin, escalated with Mike Brown and has been manipulated to make the ignorant believe that criminals being shot by police is a "social injustice".  Yes, more criminals are killed by cops than honest citizens and it should be celebrated not protested
@GoldenGuido @dorsten_marsha @70s_Hope @Scaramucci @CNN @ChrisCuomo Kneeling during the national anthem is a direct insult to those who have served and died in defense of the nation and the ideas and principles represented by the Flag of the United States of America.  It's that simple.
@GoldenGuido @dorsten_marsha @70s_Hope @Scaramucci @CNN @ChrisCuomo No, it's not a choice to take it as disrespect.   It's a historical and traditional form of insult.		Fuck no, I don't support equality. Criminals are NOT equal to honest citizens. Feeling entitled to something you didn't earn is not equal to those who work for what they have.

@dorsten_marsha @GoldenGuido @70s_Hope @Scaramucci @CNN @ChrisCuomo Saying it's not disrespectful,  doesn't change make it being disrespectful.  Tradition &amp; protocol state that you stand, remove your hat, &amp; place your hand over your heart during the anthem and pledge of allegiance as a sign of respect.  Not doing so is disrespectful.

@70s_Hope @Scaramucci @CNN @ChrisCuomo It's not a question of "rights". Yes, they have the right to be disrespectful shitbags who consider disrespecting those who have died to give them those rights to be a form of protest against criminals being shot.

@RealJamesWoods Isn't "comedy" supposed to be funny?
@Education4Libs A judge in Massachusetts was paid to rule that AR-15’s are weapons of war &amp; not protected by the 2nd Amendment.		There, fixed it.		Any bets that this "judge" is ignorant of weapons, war, and warriors. I'd bet, that this "judge" is absolutely unqualified to make that decision

@realDonaldTrump There is no truth in the news, no news in the truth.
@carcasmm @Glitchfaction1 @sabbysully2 @realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld The phrase " Russian influence" has as much value as the phrases "gender fluid" &amp; "assault weapons".  Lies designed to manipulate the ignorant into accepting a delusion.
@carcasmm @Glitchfaction1 @sabbysully2 @realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld He won because we we're sick of the democrats support of criminals, deviants, noncontributors, &amp; those sworn to destroy America.  There was no "Russian" influence" President Trump won because, his opponent is a loser who's only accomplishment is avoiding prosecution.
@carcasmm @Glitchfaction1 @sabbysully2 @realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld Reality matters.  President Trump was elected because the bitch who lost (again),  is the icon of corruption, incompetence, irresponsibility, and dishonesty.
@jack The thing is Mr. Off, I don't think a civil war between liberals and conservatives would end the way you're imagining.  We have all the booms, and you have all the whimpers.  But hey, it's your fantasy...
@Lindafblue @AP Decreased training and maintenance over the last decade have degraded our military capabilities. Lowered standards lead to lowered capabilities which results in deaths of our service members.
@SenGillibrand Defenseless prey only benefits predators, gun control only benefits criminals.  How about some policies and legislation that limits criminal abilities to prey on the innocent, instead of the victims abilities to defend themselves against the criminals.
@SenGillibrand How about some policies that actually effect criminals instead of victims and honest citizens.  How about doing what's right for the honest and making criminals the ones taking the risk.  How about making criminals more afraid of the law than honest citizens are?
@SenGillibrand If you want to do what's right:	1. National Constitutional Carry	2. Ban NPEs	3. Legislation for Judges &amp; Lawyers to be accountable &amp; liable for their decisions.	4. Corrections reform.	5. Legislation to strengthen victims &amp; witnessess protections and rights. 	6. Assured punishment
@Veteran4Trump It's been well known that the cartels have been using their smuggling routes to assist Jihadist in infiltration of the US.  There have been multiple cases of jihadis and cartels working together for more than a decade.

@KurtSchlichter Liberals believe the only people who have rights are criminals, deviants, noncontributors, and those sworn to destroy America. Democrats don't understand honesty, hardwork, or success so are unable to support anything that doesn't match their delusions.
@realDonaldTrump Place troops on the border with nonrestrictive ROEs.  Don't put our soldiers in harm's way without the ability to do their jobs.
@RyanAFournier It's called the "criminal justice system" because it's designed to protect the criminal.  We need a victims just system to protect against criminals.  To make criminals the one taking the risk, and make criminals the one afraid of the law.
@RyanAFournier To disarm criminals we need:	1. National Constitutional Carry	2. Ban NPEs.	3. Legislation for Judges &amp; Lawyers to be accountable &amp; liable for their decisions.	4. Corrections reform.	5. Legislation to strengthen victims and witnessess protections and rights. 	6. Assured punishment

@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump There's always been a war on cops, Obama can't be credited for starting that.  All he did was give it his approval and encouragement.
@PressSec @WhiteHouse Poor democrats, all that work they did to support criminals, deviants, noncontributors, and those sworn to destroy America is all ending.  Too slowly, but ending.
@SuanneMarie_ @mikeleitl11 @3eliev @PressSec The stupid would be funny if it weren't so tragic.  Nevermind kissing, who ties your shoes? https://t.co/P1tm7mSc4Q
@WhiteHouse Why are democrats always more interested in protecting criminals, deviants, noncontributors, and those sworn to destroy America than they are honest, hard-working, Americans?
@WalshFreedom The only people Barack was good for was criminals, deviants, noncontributors, and those sworn to destroy America.  I don't need parents and you can buy your own carrots.

@AngryAnok @Janjanovitch @EWErickson *US again.
@Joshua_G_Media @Janjanovitch @EWErickson Personally, I've seen pregnant rape survivors keep the child, give up for adoption, and abort.  The survivors who gave for adoption recovered  better.  Unequivocally, seeking abortion is a sign of personality disorders.
@Joshua_G_Media @Janjanovitch @EWErickson As a carte blanche statement, I disagree with all abortions. The basis for abortion after rape is that it's harmful to the mothers recovery.  There's also the nature vs nurture argument. Both are controversial.

@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 LOL reality sucks.  Stereotypes exist, and for a reason.  Your acceptance isn't required.  Your approval isn't even a consideration.
@AngryAnok @Janjanovitch @EWErickson Absolute pure manipulation. With no basis in fact.  My concern for innocent and defenseless life is well documented and chronicled in multiple records around the world.
@AngryAnok @Janjanovitch @EWErickson A *fetus is a child. It's a life, it has biological functions including heartbeats, and brain function.  A fetus responds to stimulation including pain.  Your *God argument is as asinine as your uterus argument.
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 Her being a democrat explains her delusion of entitlement to resorting to violence as manipulation because she perceived she was being treated unfairly.  Vegans are seen as democrats, &amp; democrats are seen as I've repeatedly described.
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 So let's break it down Barney style.  Her being a vegan sterotypyes her as a Democrat.  Democrats policies support criminals, deviants, noncontributors, and those sworn to destroy America. . .

@KTHopkins Don't pretend this doesn't happen here as well.  The laws protect the criminal.  It's passed time for the criminals to be taking the risk, and for our courts to be held accountable and liable for their decisions.

@Joshua_G_Media @Janjanovitch @EWErickson Medical Necessity is a joke.  Rape/incest I can understand, disagree with, but understand.  The condom broke is an excuse, only given by the worse of humanity.  I've stated my view in unmistakable terms.
@T_Bake7 @Janjanovitch @EWErickson And what, not having a uterus denies me the ability to value life? To accept responsibility for my actions, and choices?  To not understand consequences?  Your statement is asinine.
@AngryAnok @Janjanovitch @EWErickson No, I'm fine with killing.  There are more than enough criminals that thoroughly need killing.  Predators, who attack the innocent or the defenseless for pleasure and profit. 		 There is a huge difference between killing a predator, and dismemberment of child.
@Joshua_G_Media @Janjanovitch @EWErickson You know the risk of protection failing since grade school.  That's an excuse, that's killing for convenience, murder.  Don't have sex if you don't want a kid.
@Joshua_G_Media @Janjanovitch @EWErickson Not "easy" but, Show me a case of medically necessary abortion.  Rape/incest, I'll entertain.  I'll argue against vehemently but I'll at least not lose all respect or doubt your humanity.
@Janjanovitch @EWErickson The taking of a life without the intent of defense is murder.  If you kill someone that is not an imminent threat, that does not have the ability and opportunity to place you in immediate jeopardy is called murder.  To schedule it is called pre-planning.
@Janjanovitch @EWErickson What's the difference between the planning of an abortion, and the planning of a terrorist attack, or a serial killer planning their next murder?  They are all three the deliberate and intentional ending of the lives of the innocent and defenseless.
@esjacobs Aww, are you damaged?  I don't hate you, I pity you.  You only hate those who hurt you.  I pity your weakness, fears, and incapabilities. I pity your inability to contribute and reliance on others that you're incapable of appreciating.
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 Those were literally not my words.  You literally are manipulating my words to meet your perception, of what you want to think I'm saying. https://t.co/yHe5XNAARS
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 I'm not dictating how you should feel, I don't care how you feel. Squiggly asked a public question, I publicly answered.  Don't act like a democrat, I won't think of you as a democrat.
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 It's not politics, it's behaviors.  I don't assign anything, simply acknowledge self identification, and express my observations and feelings about that identification.  If you don't like the way I feel about you it's your problem. Get on or get over it.
@esjacobs No Dude. Authority is not dictated by weakness.  Your value is determined  by your  contributions,  what do you give? How are you a benefit to anyone else?  How many people can say they have a better life, or a life at all because of your existence?
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 You can't say "I'm a democrat, but don't support criminals, deviants, noncontributors, or those sworn to destroy America". That's what democrats do.  It's like saying that's dry water, or wet fire.
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 It's about behavior, and identification of patterns of behaviors.  Ducks don't act like cats.  People identify themselves by actions as well as words.  It's not generalization, it's identification.
@Ellis_Millshire @Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 It's a simple choice.  Disassociate with a group, or accept that that you're going to be expected to share the views and behaviors of that group.  Humans are social animals that associate with others they view as similar to themselves.  We gravitate towards those we share with.
@Raniaxoo @PeterSweden7 Prove me wrong.
@esjacobs You're a charlatan.  Your best isn't as good as the worse of the ones you're insulting.  		Work for you? LOL Yes, the least of them is still  "above" you.
@esjacobs Again, your point is you have no idea what your talking about. Your regurgitating words you don't understand, and concepts you can't comprehend.  You've proven you don't know what respect, accountability, integrity, credibility, service, or sacrifice means.
@diver0129 @KassyDillon @cheesetrader1 She would end up with a syncopal episode from the hypoxia.
@JesseKellyDC Expecting sanity from democrats is like expecting water to be dry.
@chadfelixg Liberalism is a mental disorder, a social disease. The word democrat is synonymous with antisocial and psychotic behavior and delusional thinking.
