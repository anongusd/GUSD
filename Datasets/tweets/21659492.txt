.@myownpetard Was this http://bit.ly/lX5d6f the particular Florida man?
.@myownpetard .@shortstack81 That goat sob story sounds more like a case for PETA, SPCA, not a bestiality law.
RT @shortstack81: What gets me is that Florida had to make a specific law about bestiality. What sparked this?
@LiberalJaxx Yes, schools are highly variable - then there's the Texas School Book Commission. You aint in no nanny state no more!
@LiberalJaxx A lot of folk do moor their yachts in Lake Texoma. Some live in them year round. LOL
.@LiberalJaxx SUV might work too - if interior upholstery is stained, ripped, dried clay on floormats and it has a couple external dents.
@LiberalJaxx Maybe you can get away with the Harley - no helmet, just a bandana - remember it's freakin' TEXAS, no intrusive helmet laws.
@LiberalJaxx Also, you need to get a pick up truck for a road trip like that.
.@LiberalJaxx Houston to Lubbock would be about a 3 day road trip. You'd need more than a case.
@LiberalJaxx Example: Lubbock is 3 six-packs west of Fort Worth.
@LiberalJaxx You measure distances bet TX cities by how many empty cans or bottles (fifths) are in pickup payload at end of trip.
@LiberalJaxx Assumed you were already there....
