@AndyHessick @CBHessick @barryfriedman1 @michaelmorley11 I agree ‚Äî preaching to the choir here. This is indeed why Dershowitz is wrong. What I was thinking about is something quite different from Dershowitz‚Äôs point. In any event, it was just an idle, half-articulated thought, not an argument for or against anything.
@barryfriedman1 @CBHessick @michaelmorley11 Agreed. I should have been more precise. Dershowitz‚Äôs tweet itself is plainly wrong. It just happened to get me thinking idly about what purely legal barriers there are to prosecutors creating a (disturbing) system that end-runs a judge‚Äôs sentencing discretion, a la an NPA/DPA
@BoutrousTed @AlanDersh Hah thanks. I try. I think the dunking on him was/is totally justified. His tweet just got me thinking about something only tangentially related to its actual content
@BoutrousTed I was thinking something like an NPA/DPA ‚Äî if a defendant agreed to spend X months in a BOP facility and prosecutors agreed to drop charges. That‚Äôd be a very troubling system, but would it be unconstitutional? Probably, but I‚Äôd never thought about it till Dershowitz‚Äôs silly tweet

@JEMesserschmidt The floor clearing yes, but most of these appeals garner zero press attention ‚Äî let alone a ton of press attention ‚Äî and so clearing the floor isn‚Äôt necessary. What else made the procedure here any different from any other appeal of a grand jury subpoena decision?

/end We @ProPublica are continuing to pursue this story. If you have any information about McKinsey‚Äôs bankruptcy practice, you can reach me confidentially on Signal or WhatsApp, at 202-714-3777.
/12 McKinsey said it will cooperate with DOJ in the Houston case. ‚ÄúWe believe our disclosures have always complied with the law and are confident they will be found appropriate here as well,‚Äù it wrote. Here‚Äôs the full statement: https://t.co/igLvngjH23
/11 The order came in response to claims raised by Mar-Bow Value Partners. The company was formed by Jay Alix, who founded and used to own restructuring firm AlixPartners, a McKinsey competitor. Alix has taken on McKinsey in several bankruptcy cases, including the Alpha case.
/10 The allegations, the judge wrote, ‚Äúif true, could violate Title 18‚Äù ‚Äî the federal criminal code ‚Äî ‚Äúand otherwise impugn the integrity of the bankruptcy process.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the order: https://t.co/OEK4pLUYFT
/9 That wasn‚Äôt the only grief McKinsey faced Friday. Just a few hours earlier, a bankruptcy judge in Houston had called on DOJ to examine a creditor‚Äôs claims that the firm had taken improper steps to hide conflicts of interest in two bankruptcy cases before the judge.
/8 It‚Äôs not the first time DOJ has raised concerns about McKinsey‚Äôs bankruptcy practice, and creditors in the Alpha case and others have accused the firm of covering up conflicts. But Friday‚Äôs filing marks a significant escalation in DOJ‚Äôs criticism of McKinsey.
/7 McKinsey earned millions advising Alpha, which declared bankruptcy in 2015. On Friday, DOJ asked the judge that oversaw the bankruptcy to reopen the case and order McKinsey to return its consulting fees.
/6 In a statement Friday, McKinsey said it had been transparent about ties to creditors and defended its disclosures as fully complying with federal law. The firm pledged to ‚Äúcontinue to fully and frankly cooperate‚Äù with DOJ. The full statement is here: https://t.co/C1CE4jIW0o
/5 Here‚Äôs a copy of the filing: https://t.co/HqZQzkpQiB
/4 Attorneys for DOJ‚Äôs bankruptcy monitor said McKinsey was ‚Äúnot forthcoming‚Äù with them. And the consultancy, they wrote, had repeatedly given the court sworn statements that were, ‚Äúat best, misleading‚Äù and concealed possible conflicts tied to investments in Alpha‚Äôs creditors.
/3 Under federal law, bankruptcy consultants have to disclose potential conflicts of interest, and conflicts can result in a firm being kicked off a case.
/2 In court papers filed Friday afternoon, DOJ stopped just short of accusing McKinsey of lying about potential conflicts of interest in the bankruptcy of coal giant Alpha Natural Resources. The firm‚Äôs restructuring arm advised Alpha before and during the bankruptcy.
/1 It‚Äôs been a tough day in court for McKinsey &amp; Company. In a case in Virginia, Justice Department officials accused the global consulting firm of misleading them and a federal judge. Meanwhile, a judge in Texas asked DOJ to look into similar allegations in two other cases.

9/ You can read that ProPublica investigation here https://t.co/tjtjp4Wh7g
8/ In a statement appended to the report, the Commission‚Äôs chair, Catherine Lhamon, cites an August ProPublica investigation of a small town in Cajun Louisiana to illustrate the human cost of DOJ‚Äôs retreat from police reform. https://t.co/5fnYHOmjf6
7/ DOJ all but gave up on police oversight under Sessions, who felt it fell outside DOJ‚Äôs job description and undermined law enforcement. (He‚Äôs not alone. Two members of the eight-member Commission voiced similar concerns in separate statements Thursday.)
6/ One way to improve police practices, the Commission‚Äôs report says, is for DOJ to return to the robust police-reform work of the Obama era. https://t.co/mp0svodSTa
5/ But as both that ProPublica investigation and the Commission‚Äôs report lament, the absence of a complete, reliable dataset permits only a partial view of how police use force in the U.S. https://t.co/WdfLdemAXv
4/ For example, a 2014 ProPublica investigation cited by the Commission found that young black men were vastly more likely to be shot dead by police than were young white men. https://t.co/ijHKqygerV

@dgtokar On the Chamber point, too: I wouldn‚Äôt view their devotion of resources to opposing Chevron as siloed. That‚Äôs just a placeholder for an overall judicial ethic they‚Äôre supporting when it comes to economic regulation
@dgtokar Also, for the record, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being cynical. In my view, how Chevron operates is fine. I just think notions like ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù and ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù inherently allow for a lot of subjective judgment. Nothing wrong with that, as such.
@dgtokar Well, the special interest groups already take them to court for everything they do. It‚Äôs more agency attorneys‚Äô lawyerly wariness of how their interpretation will fare in court, even if in most cases the absence of Chevron won‚Äôt make much of a difference
@dgtokar On your earlier points, it‚Äôs a longer conversation. But I‚Äôve worked with the Chevron framework a lot as a lawyer, and I don‚Äôt think the original Chevron case gives much of a sense of how it operates in practice after Mead/Christensen/a bunch of DC Circuit ops
@dgtokar That last point is the key to your second-to-last one. It will potentially make agencies interpret their organic statutes more narrowly/conservatively. That‚Äôs chiefly what the Chamber is banking on.

@dgtokar I realize I‚Äôm eliding certain things and risk sounding like a knee-jerk legal realist. But I don‚Äôt mean Chevron is meaningless. I just mean if you got rid of Chevron, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd see different outcomes ‚Äî just different explanations for how judges got there
@dgtokar In theory, Chevron matters where a court thinks the agency interpretation isn‚Äôt the best but falls within the bounds of reason. But in practice, it seems to me largely a rhetorical tool‚Äîalbeit an important one‚Äîthat justifies that outcome, rather than a tool that guides outcomes
@dgtokar Sorry for the slow reply. This is a longer conversation but what I mean is: from what I‚Äôve seen, judges treat agency interpretations the same as they treat any party‚Äôs. If another party puts fwd what they view as a better reading, they tend to find against the agency &amp; vice versa

@NoWayTheycanWin https://t.co/BYL5Xg4fXn
@NoWayTheycanWin @CarrieSweet2017 That‚Äôs a complicated one. Though counterintuitive, it‚Äôs often best not to put on an affirmative defense case‚ÄîI‚Äôll send you a good thread about it. I suspect Manafort‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs made the right call strategically‚Äîthe best of a lot of bad options
@NoWayTheycanWin @CarrieSweet2017 Hah that‚Äôs probably true of me too. I‚Äôve never been on one but I think it‚Äôd be an agonizing process. I‚Äôm very curious about the experience though
@NoWayTheycanWin @CarrieSweet2017 But the burden is on the government - so the defense doesn‚Äôt need to disprove the charge
@NoWayTheycanWin @CarrieSweet2017 Yeah many courts agree and don‚Äôt instruct the jury as to the definition unless asked to. The idea being a juror will use his or her common sense. But when somebody‚Äôs liberty is at stake, I see why jurors might want a more precise definition, even if it‚Äôs probably not very helpful
@NoWayTheycanWin @CarrieSweet2017 I don‚Äôt know. At what point is the doubt you have about whether the gov‚Äôt proved an element of a charged crime so minimal that you‚Äôre degree of uncertainty ceases to be ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù?  At what point is the doubt you have unreasonable?
