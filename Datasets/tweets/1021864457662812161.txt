I live in Oklahoma @realDonaldTrump I see illegals come up here from Texas all the time especially with dangerous drugs, these are murderers too. Please stand up and Protect my family and all my fellow Americans President Trump, we need you at this time, please don't let us down
This is outrageous! Shut it down @realDonaldTrump. @IngrahamAngle is right stand up to these people. I am a Trump supporter and if the there is no wall then shutdown the government. It will be very disappointing and hurtful  if we cave in and dont fight. President Trump stand up.
I'm saying this now if @realDonaldTrump fails to get the border wall funding and caves in. There will be Republicans falling as a Trump supporter I want my President to stand tall @WhiteHouse 1.6 billion is laughable for Trump supporters. @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer is smiling now
I have a suggestion for @NancyPelosi let President Trump know what you want out of the shutdown showdown. Like DACA ect. @chuckschumer can get on board. Give @realDonaldTrump his funding, plus get what you ask for. It doesn't hurt to work together. You can go home for Christmas.
RT @realDonaldTrump: Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just anoth…
@realDonaldTrump It's very wrong mr President and most Americans get it. We are disgusted with the DOJ. Declassify all documents that you said you would. We need them now
" Its in the public interest that @realDonaldTrump has an obligation to declassify and disclose the FBI documents related to the FBI probe" @WSJ

Who wants more of the full unredacted fisa? Its 471 pages long and omg you wouldn't believe what's in it! Let me know if you want it posted.
I'm fixing to do a story on my Local fox news About the full unredacted FISA WARRANTS please stay tuned And also the Mueller mandate Please pay attention MSM and other media! @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @ABC @NBCNews @SaraCarterDC @CBSNews @washingtonpost @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @GOP
Who wants more of the unredacted fisa
@MSNBC https://t.co/TgNNTwWhje
The unredacted fisa app and Robert Mueller mandate! Is about to break on my local news channel 10:10. I have to call back and send the paper work. So media still wants the story call me at 4058826436. @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @CBSNews @ABC  @NBCNews @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump
@BryanWimpy @realDonaldTrump Rt the photo I just posted and share them around
@BryanWimpy @realDonaldTrump I am I just posted something huge
This right here looks like they denied the fisa the first time. Then had to file another one
People dont understand under the Patriot act 702 fisa statute! That anyone who provide info to the court  has full immunity! Carter page could have told them anything but can't be prosecuted for it! One reason they haven't went after him! I reserve judgment. But just to say!
We have more to come!
Out of unredacted fisa! Obama was controlling surveillance out of the white house by putting his name up for the spying of Trump campaign officials! This is why prestap and struzk. Went to the white house all the time! Because Obama had Google under his belt
Out of unredacted FISA! The judge for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court held these hearings about Obama intel “702” surveillance violations. The judge criticized NSA for “institutional lack of candor” and states “this is a very serious Fourth Amendment issue.”
I'm reading from the full unredacted FISA report. I rather type it than posted classified docs
Out of Full unredacted FISA! Peter strzok went to the white house in October and Obama gave permission in the fisa court to surveil. Joseph schmitz is in the fisa to he is the redacted spy in Mueller mandate he is obsessed with spying go look at his BG. He work with blackwater
From unredacted FISA! Oct. 21, 2016, for the second time in several months, the Justice Department and FBI applied to wiretap former Trump campaign adviser (later discovered to be an FBI asset) Carter W. Page. This time, the request was approved based on new FBI “evidence,”
Out of Fisa! the FBI in June 2016 not oct obtained a secret FISA court order to monitor communications of Trump adviser Carter Page, convincing a judge there wass probable cause to believe Page is acting as a Russian agent. Surveillance of Page theoretically it was denied!
I have been reading the unredacted full version of all FISA WARRANTS I got from my doj friend They was denied the the first fisa application. The fisa court had to have permission from President Obama to spy So Obama ordered the whole thing I will release it soon going through it
KEY POINT:  Obama also pushed for more aggressive information sharing in the final days of his administration when he authorized all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to access raw NSA data through Executive Order 12333. So this is why Obama is in the fisa that's coming!
I'm here media I have full fisa docs all unredacted I have secret recordings I have everything Mueller has been keeping from us including his full unredacted mandate! Everything about Trump tower the real truth! I have eyes and ears of it. #Transparent
My doj friend wants me to get the truth out! This could be the biggest story of your lifes. Because what I have will blow the lid off everything! I'm here
Media do you want the full unredacted fisa warrant and the redacted spy. And all the trump tower recordings! And the unredacted of Mueller mandate! I have everything from a source that was given to me. I'm really close with a doj official that wants the truth out. I'm here
Let me know media if you want the story I have my dm open
I have the full FISA WARRANTS apps. Who wants the posted? (For real)
I can't say how I got the full FISA's but I'm thinking if I post them on here would I be arrested. Should I post them!
I'm am 100 percent that Joseph E. Schmitz who was a campaign adviser who delivered Hillary's emails on July 31 2016 to the FBI  is a redacted spy and came back out to spy further his history says he's obsessed with spying Obama is in the fisa I'm looking at it right now.
I'll give you a secret who the redacted spy is. He delivered emails of Hillary Clinton on July 31 2016. Which is the date the Russian investigation started
I also have a copy of the full fisa WARRANTS!
I want to expose everything I know I need a bigger platform!
I also know the redacted spy in the Trump campaign they have been hiding
Remember hope hicks I have a secret recording! One of her white lies about Trump tower
Who remembers hope hicks? Their is a big secret white lie that has never been exposed I have it on recordings!
I'm askin all media who wants the story? @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @washingtonpost @WSJ @MSNBC @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @SaraCarterDC @seanhannity! I have documents and recordings! A big Trump Tower Story unedited! I have the secrets. You better get to me before doj does
@sunshinette Do you really want to know it all? Because its goes very deep within
Their is two major names on how the Trump tower was set up! And what was told in the meeting and the secret. Should I tell it all. And be full transparent?
They haven't asked me what went on in the Trump tower meeting. I know everything that went on I had eyes and ears in their.1 the MSM wouldn't like it 2 I know something never been told before 2 it's a very big secret that's not being told 4 on how it was really setup!
MSM and real news @CNN @washingtonpost @nytimes @MSNBC @CBSNews @NBCNews @ABC @FoxNews @SaraCarterDC @seanhannity
They haven't asked me about the Trump tower meeting. I know alot more than what's out there. I could tell you everything that happened. But the Mainstream media wouldn't like it. 1 I had eyes in the meeting 2 I know exactly what was said 3 I know a very big thing no one knows
Who's ready for Saturday? Oklahoma  vs texas, and Ohio state vs northwestern dont let me forget Alabama vs Georgia. Alabama has to win and Ohio state has to do poor or loose, and Oklahoma has to beat Texas for my Oklahoma Sooners to be for in the playoffs! Sooner born and bread!
Update! @FoxNews said" active shooter at Walter Reed Medical Center was a drill"
@FoxNews reporting " active shooter lockdown at Walter Reed Medical Center a Cold White"

If @federalreserve better stop rising interest rates. @realDonaldTrump has plans to replace the fed chairman if they keep trying to screw up his great economy. And the President has the authority to fire the fed guy if the President thinks it is appropriate! @GOP

@NBCNews What a idiot! Fake news CNN words matter to!
The fact that this person is doing this on October 24 which is a FULL MOON, is weird. Also the full moon in October is called a (HUNTERS MOON) its like someone is hunting their Prey today and they have Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN and George soros, and DW on the list WHOS NEXT!
@realDonaldTrump said "we should unify and political violence has no place in the US" @CNN Is still going after President Trump no matter what he says. Just like @seanhannity has said if President Trump cures cancer the MSM will still go after him! Outrageous!
@sherry50waldie @RonDeSantisFL But if it's a real attack then they should go after who doing this!
@sherry50waldie @RonDeSantisFL I know Republicans early voting is out beating Democrats big time. I just have a feeling this might be a false flag attack to change the narrative. If it is President Trump needs to change the narrative again.
@RonDeSantisFL Amen thank you Ron

2 weeks before the election @Twitter suppressing voices. I've had tweets deleted, accounts added to both followers and following list so it can control my account. I believe @realDonaldTrump needs to say something about this again. He has already warn them a couple of times!
@gregg_re I read your piece @FoxNews you basically said the national guard is restricted from law enforcement actions! That is correct under title 32. But under title 10 under the national guard act the President has authority to use them as federal troops in borders.
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight He Also said he talked to President Trump about him having the authority under Hawaii vs Trump the travel ban to shutdown border crossings and stopping these people from coming into the country.
Amen! @DanPatrick Texas Lt. Governor said on @FoxNews "this caravan will not come into this country shutdown all border crossings, @realDonaldTrump has authority under, Hawaii vs Trump (Travel Ban) to prevent these people from coming in the country"
@FoxNews @GOPChairwoman We need the whole Trump movement of 2016!
I was watching @donlemon on @CNN he said "the posse comitatus act prevents @realDonaldTrump from sending military to the border" As that might by 10 percent right but DON you need to go read the insurrection act and national guard title 10 it gives PT authority at a GOV request!
A message to @ChrisCuomo you want to call my President a liar! Your channel @CNN is full of fake news and lies told by liars everyday Your nose has grown pinocchio 2 years ago. First you started with Russia and when you are dropping ratings at unprecedented pace! You are the LIAR
@WSJ God sending his army to stop the caravan!
Hurricane (Willa) The name is derived from the Germanic words “wil” meaning “will, desire” and “helm” meaning “helmet, protection”; therefore, William essentially means “valiant protector”.  Even though @realDonaldTrump is sending the military to! is God sending his! @GOP https://t.co/CvIH52KbGG

Obama did evil Trump is good.

@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK The Insurrection Act (Title 10 USC, Sections 331-335). This act allows the president to use U.S. military personnel at the request of a state legislature or governor to suppress insurrections. It also allows the president to use federal troops to enforce federal laws.

@KyserBrewer @CNN So one saying almost 5000 and the other one saying 2975 someone ain't got their facts right and keeps spreading fake news these research study's are BS they are counting people dieing months after the storm not right after or during!
@Ian2713 @CNN My facts are right CNN reported fake news in may of 2018 and the fake news from yesterday! The number can't be almost 5000 when they said 2975 most people died a couple months after the storm hit. Its why its fake news trying to Boast it against President Trump
@CNN https://t.co/G1iegppThw.    CNN fake news of may 2018. Now they posted fake news again yesterday just to boast bad news at President Trump! The majority of the people that died was months after the storm. CNN caught yet again spreading fake news just to hurt President Trump!

@MSNBC John McCain will no doubt be remembered as a hero. And he did serve our country with honor but I believe he also tried to take out President Trump and was secretly colluding with James comey trying to get hillary elected no one talks about McCains secret dark side!
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump No rocket launch in almost a year no testing. Launch site dismantled! Ya the threat has diminish from to where we was days from a ballistic  missile getting shots at us and a nuclear explosion off the West coast! I say we are better off today than 1 year ago

@washingtonpost No Washington post we Americans are sick and tired of illegals coming in our country killing us!
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Michael Cohen plead to something that wasn't even a crime! For one it is not illegal to pay for fake lies from women as long as you say it for personal reasons. And 2 It's not a campaign finance  violation if your doing it for that personal reasons! For read the dang  law
@mccainin4 @CNN @PaulManafort $100 bill are being destroyed now and replaced by the hybrid FRN-USTN On the right side we have the new currency hiding in plain sight It is the right side of the $100 bill that is now legal tender for all debt public and private statement is no longer on the FRN side of the bill https://t.co/l5pdiOvZly
@mccainin4 @CNN @PaulManafort Actually we are fixing to do?away with all that debt the federal reserve notes are fixing to be more more. I suspect in the near future the fed will be embolished and the treasury department will control the banks like the constitution says.
@SDNYnews You are allowed to protect your family. So if he did pay off women it was done for personal family reasons it had nothing to do with the election it was done to protect his family from embarrassment of the women lies. Stupid us attorneys needs to go read the law.
@SDNYnews Worse work ever! This has nothing to emplicate a President you don't violate campaign finance if it was done for family reasons! You are allowed to protect your family when it becomes to campaign finance expenses! So these us attorneys hasn't pulled a wool over no ones head
@SDNYnews Hey if our nation laws apply to everyone. Get Rod rosenstein and his lisa Barsoomian ready get Robert Mueller ready because their corruption goes back to the 90s and it gets worse protecting Clinton and Obama corruption plus uraniom one. I have documents of it all! Its going down https://t.co/v4l4pgvZXh
@CNN My take away from today! Just shows me how bad Mueller wants to setup Trump to cover up his and rod rosenstein corruption going back to the 90s and rosenstein wife lisa Barsoomian is apart of it. She is the wife holding it all together! https://t.co/8FDDt2fYcZ
@LannyDavis Rod rosenstein corruption goes back to 90s when he first falsely got Hillary out of a investigation. Rod rosenstein wife lisa Barsoomian is a crooked lawyer of corruption protecting Obama and Clinton and Mueller and comey even Jeff sessions chuck cooper the whole doj corrupt https://t.co/fN4ctruDmc
@LannyDavis Lanny! To when a sleepy Clinton lover like you represents a sleepy pathological liar like coen reminds me that, all this is to setup Trump and protect all the corruption that lies beneath rosenstein and Mueller, and rosenstein wife Lisa who represented bill Clinton!
@LannyDavis @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Lanny! I feel sorry for you after Nov election once the Republicans keep the house. Mueller will be done with his bone of thugs and if you had anything to do with to try and setup trump by havin coen to lie in open court. I dnt think any lawyer would get you out that one
@LannyDavis @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Hey lanny! Do your 15 min of fame please get it over with, guess what President Trump will gain support just this past week 39% blacks from dems to Trump! Blue wave dieing, red rave coming! Because America sees through the Mueller setup To make people compose to get trump
@LannyDavis @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 could have gotten bette representation from a first year law student! @marklevinshow said it best Michael didn't even commit campaign finance law it was coordinated to have Cohen to compose because they can't get Trump under a perjury Trap.B4 Sept 1 spc deadline
@ChelseaClinton @Vrtlmrk America will not stand for another Clinton in office! And after the revelations coming from the emails your mom deleted and the fbi recovered and judicial watch is getting from the state department every month after classified information is in there. We will never trust Clintons
@ChelseaClinton @Vrtlmrk And you payed for your wedding with the Clinton Foundation which the foundation got money from foreign governments who bought your mom in 2016! O its all coming out my dear just wait until after the Republicans keep the house and everything will be revealed after the midterms!
@ChelseaClinton @Vrtlmrk Chelsea! I don't think you should embarrass yourself, or your family by running for office like your parents,  your mom broke laws in this country why would we elect another Clinton when the other one is a criminal, her fate is TBD, and she will be prosecuted for other crimes and
@vanbadham @realDonaldTrump Idiot

@GregShugar @realDonaldTrump I would be angry to he has ever rite to be! And my President is fighting back and we will fight back with him!
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega I've already read it bunch of times
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega Ya it will and President Trump gave Sessions a choice either do something, or go down with the corrupted rod rosenstein and robert Mueller!!
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega Ya but sessions has caved and gone to the other side. I'm glad you support Mr President he's the best. But rod rosenstein and Mueller has threatening sessions in private, sessions is a scared little bat!
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega And you live in a different country so you really don't know what's going on! I've been following everything since President Trump said he was running for President
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega And something else sessions got his name from the confederate Jefferson Davis who tried to take down the republic of America!
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega Well you can disagree but we know the truth and if you go to https://t.co/rTzPeLKAH0 it tells how sessions has dug in with the deep state
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump order the national guard in Chicago! Use (TITLE TEN) of the national guard act, it gives you full authority! We need to do something Mr President!
@stevenlissner @bbusa617 @FirestormOmega I'm sorry to say but sessions has gone to the other side? He has cross over to the deep state. They bought him out!
@l_ylvisaker @bbusa617 @AnnaApp91838450 But I don't like the liberals on fox! I prefer Hannity or judge jenine or Lara Ingram or Shannon breame
@l_ylvisaker @bbusa617 @AnnaApp91838450 Wrong! Fox is the number 1 news show in the country. CNN and everyone else are not even in the top ten!
@FoxNews @RealCandaceO @MariaBartiromo They will not succeed, if they even do it I will lead the way of 60 million people and march to Washington and they will pay big time we need to protect our President at all cost!
@Cogadh_Ghrian @AngeleStar11 @CNN If they even try to take down President Trump in anyway they will feel and see the full force of 60 million people rising up!
@washingtonpost The catholic church is being embarrassed and destroyed with all these sex scandals, I believe a lot of people thinking really hard on this, they have no one to blame but there selves, God disapproves of it.
RT @FreedomWorks: .@RepDeSantis and @RepMattGaetz to launch a #FreedomTour campaign for House Freedom Caucus founder @Jim_Jordan for Speake…
@washingtonpost So any Mueller subpoenas would be a distraction to the president to. If they are going to do it on this one. Than they should do it on the witch hunt too
@BeckyChill @thatTronaldDump @realDonaldTrump I live in a real world right in middle America! You are just a liberal quack
@washingtonpost THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT USES SES, SERCO, AND OPIC AS PORTALS INTO UNSPEAKABLE CORRUPTION https://t.co/eeeYlhgbor via @wordpressdotcom
@BeckyChill @thatTronaldDump @realDonaldTrump Its real news
@ABC 2020 is no more!
@realDonaldTrump The Senior Executive Services (SES) includes over 8,000 Obama stay-behind senior federal employees in all agencies of the U.S. government. They openly state that they cannot be fired by the President
@thatTronaldDump @realDonaldTrump Obama apologized to dictators and gave terrorist 150 billion dollars! President Trump leading from the front and the world leaders listens when he talks and roles out the red carpet. To bad Obama didn't get the same treatment
@h3lp_m3_l3arn @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You wish My great President wouldn't give you the time or day if you are a hater liberal quack
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump The best President ever! We are a great nation again and the whole world bows down to President Trump!
@stopthenutjob @realDonaldTrump President Trump is bringing the deep state out in the open he really got under their skin and they are going down down! And my President Trump dosnt give a crap what former Intel people think. Brennan is drowning Mueller case is blowing up in Virginia and MSM is 😢
@realDonaldTrump Ya hes a distain to our country peddling Russian lies! And fake dossier
@CNN The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment
@CNN Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.
@FoxNews @OMAROSA get off stage your 15 min are up! People on both sides are talking crap about you! You are ruining what image you have left! Your book is not doing great your just another news story that already passed You can not hurt my President peddling your BS lies will destroy you
@NBCNews @andrewcuomo your political career ambitions are gone! Its like the @MittRomney 47% in 2012.
@FoxNews Bye bye @RahmEmanuel get out now you low life! You have turned Chicago against each other! You are a distain of the office! Your time up, put in your resignation now before it gets worse! You are not fit to lead Chicago anymore!
@JohnBrennan is a embarrassment to what our nations four father's built this nation for! He's @BarackObama Russian lies peddle. They both didn't do anything to stop the so called Russian hoax. They planted the evidence to destroy President Trump "Insurance Policy Overthrow Trump" https://t.co/FTlzjEEVBe
@ShawnRouney999 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK @RealAlexJones @MattLaslo You too, May peace be with you!
@ShawnRouney999 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK @RealAlexJones @MattLaslo JFK once said!  not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply "give the public what it wants"--but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers.
@ShawnRouney999 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK @RealAlexJones @MattLaslo What you dear lord about! My point is the Press should never engage in behavior to change the constitution! The press reports the news not to make it a town hall out of it with play parts when people are hurting. It seem like a movie. JFK *
@NBCNews So when @JohnBrennan say's @realDonaldTrump committed treason. He should look in the mirror and look at the distain he put our great nation through. He is "HOGWASH" "that should remain silent anything he says will be held against him in a court of law". When Mueller case blows up
@NBCNews I call @JohnBrennan a 🐖 who has lipstick on! He peddled the Russian lies through the CIA and FBI and DOJ. He has voted communist for a foreign power in the past. He leaked classified info to the media in Obama admin! He should of never had clearance in the first place
@ShawnRouney999 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK @RealAlexJones @MattLaslo I never said sandy hook was a hoax. I just watched what everyone watched  on the news! But after the Florida shooting, I do believe that the Press did bring about activism which shifted gun policy. But one may think is that what the Press is for to not be independent! To engage?
@MattLaslo @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK @RealAlexJones JFK once said!  And so it is to the printing press--to the recorder of man's deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be, free and independent.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK "Opinion" and free speech can not be curtailed. @RealAlexJones  has every right to state his "free speech opinions" and hating liberals can either turn the page, change the channel, or deal with it. You could be next @MattLaslo than how would you feel?
@MSNBC As long as the voting  machines arn't connected online like smartmatic! Which	@MittRomney	 has a cash investment in these smart voting machines he can rig Utah's election it all leads back to England! "Ask for bipartisan vote count in your state for fair elections call STATE AG"
@CBSNews The deep state rearing its head against! Trump dose not give a sh*t about a stupid letter from former intell people who is not part of the administration. What you think going to do with the letter try and override P Trump he's just going to rip it up and throw it on the ground.
@FoxNews @SteveScalise @WalshFreedom	on CNN blowing up a 5 min segment to trash 	@realDonaldTrump	 and saying Republicans have been trashing trump privately and making 	@JohnBrennan look good! looks like your wrong Walsh most republicans are coming out against Brennan! Learn to not peddle liberal lies
@RadioFreeTom @WalshFreedom So stay in liberal Chicago and the next time you get the need to show how a traitor to the party you once claim and to rebuke @realDonaldTrump Please IM me I give "Trump derangement syndrome sessions 2 for1" other than that put a lipstick on that 🐖!
@RadioFreeTom @WalshFreedom You are out of touch sir @realDonaldTrump carries heavy weight and for you to say that most of the Republican congress rebukes trump in private is just stupid and wrong! Example @JohnKennedyLA called @JohnBrennan a "butthead and should of never had clearance" @RandPaul said same!
@RadioFreeTom @WalshFreedom Hey Joe Walsh never trumper you are out of touch with most republicans. This isn't the establishment party anymore. I rebuke your interview @CNN against  President Trump! Their is 60 million of us and more including 39% of the black vote jumping from dems to Trump. You
@lapilkington @MSNBC @maddow @JudicialWatch Lmao you talking about Michael Horowitz he is deep state. He's George Soros clean up buddy.
@MSNBC Ill sign! To slap a lipstick on that  🐖	@JohnBrennan		 come on bring it on you fat tub! Roll over! "YOU HOGWASH"
@soozschmooze @washingtonpost @TheJusticeDept I'm going to arrest Mueller and his cronies! https://t.co/MhveJcM1i6
@lapilkington @MSNBC @maddow @JudicialWatch Lmao Hillary investigation was a cover-up to protect her from prosecution so she could get rigged elected you sure didn't follow the 2016 election. You are a brainwash liberal!
@washingtonpost Sounds like Mueller trying to show something because he's fixing to have a big blow dealt to him from the manafort trial. In sorry Mueller your through. "Get ready to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law" @TheJusticeDept
@Real_PeachyKeen Ya and declassified all Obama's records in the Obama library where Obama transfer them to
@lapilkington @MSNBC @maddow @JudicialWatch Trump is the best President ever and nothing will take him down! We are winning again. Obama apologized to terrorists and gave them 150 billion dollars. Obama was passing classified emails with Hillary is yet to be all revealed in lawsuits to get records
@lapilkington @MSNBC @maddow @JudicialWatch Clinton hired fusion GPS and Christopher Steele to go to Russia to get dirt on trump and crest a fake dossier. That the real collusion Obama and Clinton played you liberals like a fiddle. Hillary had her campaign paid for by evil dictators she owes them billions they bought her
@afrommi @MSNBC @maddow @BarackObama Are you that dumb he is not silence them he said today they can talk all they want but not with a security clearance that is a curtisty @JohnBrennan was abusing it on line 29 on form. You can not use it to go after a us President or to try and overthrow him
@afrommi @MSNBC @maddow @BarackObama Trump said something but his actions didn't do anything! Obama administration set this insurance policy to overthrow trump if he was elected? Main stream media narrative is collapsing and when this jury comes back and deals a blow to Mueller than that will be it Mueller bow out
@lapilkington @MSNBC @maddow @JudicialWatch Obama administration setup trump to catch trump in a conspiracy. Obama met with intell in march 2016 out of country to set it all in play.
@MSNBC @maddow @JohnBrennan don't have clearance no more so he can't peddle his Russian lies to the media. This is why President Trump calls msm enemy of the people. Because they are using former intell officials to try and overthrow a sitting president! You will lose MSM &amp; truth to be revealed
@MSNBC @maddow Of what's coming next. The  media CNN trying to expose the jury to get info to send threats to their families! Because the jury came back with a surprise question what is reasonable doubt. The MSM Deep state and their Russian collusion narrative is collapseing in front of them
@MSNBC @maddow This all came out in court documents gathered by @JudicialWatch!  Rod rosenstein is conflicted for signing fisa app against carter page and firing comey he sign the letter. Mueller is conflicted. The probably deep state threatening the manafort judge and jurors. They are scared
@MSNBC @maddow @BarackObama doj and fbi and intell agencies created a fake dossier to peddle to the media to trap trump. They even had fire walls setup. Christopher Steele was worried of breaking laws with Bruce ore. They met with Russian oligarchs. It's a conspiracy to catch trump in espionage
@MSNBC @maddow The collusion is with Bruce ore and Christopher Steele and fbi meeting with Russian lawyer before and after trump tower meeting to setup a picture of collusion. @JohnBrennan help created this fake dossier. He is a lier and a communist who has distain for America. @BarackObama doj
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm with you gop all the way to save my family my constitution my government from evil democrats who hate America and want to destroy America and give it to evil people including Obama and Clinton
@MSNBC @AliVelshi Watch @seanhannity on tv to find the real truth. About it all
@NBCNews Our soliders need to come home! We have won this war the objective was to kill osama bin Laden and we did. Time to end the dang thing and take care of our own country and vets.
@NBCNews I say do it because Bruce ore and Christopher Steele and the fbi used a Russian lawyer before the Trump tower meeting and after to setup the picture at the meeting! This came all from the court with foia request!  real collusion is from @BarackObama doj to setup @realDonaldTrump
@nytimes Wow is new York Times quietly praising @realDonaldTrump am I reading this correctly!
@ABC https://t.co/t8MQ4ryecs
@NBCNews I'm giving liberals, Trump derangement syndrome counceling 2-for1 Friday. Im me and we will get to work!
@washingtonpost It shows President Trump agenda is working!
@washingtonpost effort based largely on self-discipline, to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of "clear and present danger," the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public's need for national security.
@washingtonpost then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of "clear and present danger," then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.
@washingtonpost their use, have all been pinpointed in the press and other news media to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power; and that, in at least in one case, the publication of details concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed required its alteration
@washingtonpost that details of this nation's covert preparations to counter the enemy's covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader, friend and foe alike; that the size, the strength, the location and the nature of our forces and weapons, and our plans and strategy for their
@washingtonpost For the facts of the matter are that this nation's foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery or espionage; that details of this nation's covert preparations to counter the enemy's
@CNN You can not block article 2 power! You don't have the numbers to pass a bill. And Republicans will not short change Trump right now! @MarkWarner nice try go back peddling your Russian lies on the Facebook platform
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox Ya i understand that! But theirs one thing that is acceptable, the pledge of allegiance, it has been in school since I was in first grade! All your doing is respecting our flag! I don't see why people take issue with that.
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox It made me sick about Arkansas's capital! But they removed it thank God!
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox Yes we agree on President Trump! I understand what your saying about god! Because what happened in Arkansas today if we put god in everywhere than people want to put satan everywhere. We have our beliefs but keep it neutral!
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox Well I'll pray for you
@DinosaurSaddle @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox My faith is strong in the lord and Jesus Christ I will never cross over to the evil side! Jesus died on the cross for my sins. That what I believe and nothing will ever change that ever. Not you not satan not anyone
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox God is going to be where people want him and where he will be accepted! But I'm stating god is my god. If you chose different that going to be between you and god and Jesus.
@FoxNews Obama's little pet destroying Chicago! Needs to be gone!
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox I'm not talking about satan! I'm talking about god Jesus lord and savior. I cast satan into the he'll of fire. Satan is not my god. The lord Jesus Christ is my god
@DinosaurSaddle @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox God is not a cult. Take your demons and be gone. I rebuke satan. And god is my refuge! Jesus is lord!
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox You are sick! God is real! Their is only one god! God who created heaven and earth is god! That the god I serve! First commandment tho shall serve only one God! And theres only one god! If you serve another! I feel sorry for you and ill pray for you!
@DinosaurSaddle @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox God is real. You sick bot! I rebuke satan!
@StoppingLies @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox There's only one god! The god who created the world and humans and everything. God is god and that's it
@DinosaurSaddle @FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox And you are a computer augrithom bot
@historBilia @ABC @PierreTABC I don't need to because its right in my head
@FoxNews @LaurenGreenFox We should do it in every school and every capital. This is gods country and his world.
@CNN Good we need to bring that money home to rebuild our country. I'm with Trump we spent to much in the middle east and don't have anything to show for it! You can't force another country to end their wars if they won't do it. And its their responsibility not the US
@historBilia @ABC @PierreTABC Yes it really does, the liberal mainstream press has been pushing the manafort case as the trial of the century for months they said its Mueller gotcha case and when they look like their about to end up in a blow they want to run scared even trying getting jurors info before done
@historBilia @ABC @PierreTABC Most of the whole country thought it was going to be a guilty verdict! In stating just an example! And the manafort case is all about Mueller if he loses this battle his Russian case against trump will be a blow. Time will tell
@CNN Bye bye Mueller President Trump has full constitutional authority under article 2 but its coming down the pike very soon. Just like Rudy Giuliani said we are going to unload on you with a ton of bricks! I'm loving it!
@CNN @CNNOpinion And the head of CNN is fair game of enemy of the people. So if the press wants war than they should watch who they prevoke!
@CarlyJA22 @realDonaldTrump Well I can look through your liberal BS lies most Americans can!
@MSNBC @maddow How about the fbi and Christopher Steele and Bruce ore meeting with the Russian lawyer before and after the Trump tower meeting via Bruce ores emails and Steele and the fbi uncovered by @JudicialWatch in court! It proves Obama admin! Conspiring with Russians. Write that msnbc
@SaraCarterDC Omg CNN is so nervous. They have no right to publish the jurors even with the deliberations to going. CNN should be charged with a crime if anything happens to this jurors or their families. Crooked News Network
@CarlyJA22 @realDonaldTrump And his base is stronger than ever their probably 60 percent of the country strong
@CarlyJA22 @realDonaldTrump A bot a computer authroithum I'm a live human.
@ABC @PierreTABC Sounds like the deep state Mueller team getting nervous. Remember the Casey Anthony case everyone says she going to found guilty most of the whole country did, this could be a surprising verdict like Anthony!
@ABC @JohnBrennan has already weakened this country when he did NOTHING about the so called Russians in 2016. He is a distain on this nation for years to come! Thank you @realDonaldTrump for making us more saffer from this communist!
@FrankDangelo23 @realDonaldTrump My President Trump will never go to jail and who ever trys to even take him out of office 64 million of us will rise to the occasion! To protect him at all cost!
@CarlyJA22 @realDonaldTrump Of course u got that from a UK website. Mind your own country and leave my President alone! He is the best President ever and means business and the whole world is listening to him and gives and bows down to him!
@satya_or_bust @washingtonpost JFK! Who was a Democrat said this! And @JohnBrennan presents a clear and present danger he is known to leak classified info to the press in the past and give classified info to our advisory!
@washingtonpost to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of "clear and present danger," the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public's need for national security.
@JanetPursley @CamilleGtine @secupp Ya I know! I offered the left. Trump derangement syndrome counceling, told them they could get 2 for 1 Friday!
@JanetPursley @CamilleGtine @secupp Se cupp used to be a Republican!  what happened to her she must of got some of that liberal hogwash.
@washingtonpost @JRubinBlogger Washington post goes the way of a secret society trying to destroy President Trump
@GOP RED WAVE BABY!
@foxandfriends @GeraldoRivera Great cia director for real? Maybe in another world!
@marklevinshow Lol what that they go low we go high CNN you are at you're lowest. Trump derangement syndrome at it finest. I offer 2 for 1 sessions @CNN counceling for the press
@secupp Se! And so it is to the printing press--to the recorder of man's deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news--that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be: free and independent.  It is not MSM today
@secupp Se! not the tests of national security.
@secupp Se! The newspapers which printed these stories were loyal, patriotic, responsible and well-meaning. Had we been engaged in open warfare, they undoubtedly would not have published such items. But in the absence of open warfare, they recognized only the tests of journalism
@secupp Se! Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed
@secupp Se! It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.
@secupp Se! to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of "clear and present danger," the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public's need for national security.
@secupp Se! But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standards, and to recognize the nature of our country's peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on self-discipline,
@secupp Se! We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
@secupp Se!  The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.
@Ohio_Buckeye_US @RealCharlesMoon @realDonaldTrump JFK to the press!The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.
@Ohio_Buckeye_US @RealCharlesMoon @realDonaldTrump We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it
@gilmcdowell @CBSNews I'm saying where I get my stuff from is right out of the newspaper
@MSNBC @maddow @AriMelber @JohnBrennan We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it
@MSNBC @maddow @AriMelber @JohnBrennan The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment
@gilmcdowell @CBSNews Better than fake news Msm!
@MSNBC @maddow @AriMelber @JohnBrennan This is true right out of court documents! But it will tear down the media Russian collusion hoax narrative!
@MSNBC @maddow @AriMelber Put lipstick on your 🐖 @JohnBrennan . why don't you go with that the fbi Christopher Steele and Bruce ore met with Russian lawyer before the Trump tower meeting and after! They setup the whole thing to pedal the fake Russian dossier by Brennan and Christopher Steele!
@NBCNews Because Its Trump derangement syndrome! I give free counceling for democrats that are going crazy! 2 for 1!
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Crybaby democrats are already losing a majority of their base! By November there will be a huge red wave. Pelosi crumbs socialist free everything. Impeachment waters. What the Heck happened 2018
@RickKyker @realDonaldTrump Democrats are going to be in tears November 7 2018! They are going to break down just like in 2016 saying! WHAT HAPPENED we had this bought!
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Democrats don't know what America stands for anymore! I think they want to give our nation back to the Queen of England. We need to have a class on revolutionary war and the war how America won its independence!
@GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Get on your knees and you hired!
@freedom2marry @iamsrknFC @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Are you dumb Hillary could have gotten 50 million more votes than Trump and still lose! The constitution is about the electoral college not popular votes! Democrats where did you go to school. University for dummies!
@realDonaldTrump Venezuela is taking applications for moving Andrew Cuomo!
@NPR @OMAROSA i have a job for you it requires you to stick it where the sun don't shine. Boot boot!
@NBCNews @NBCFirstRead Like President Trump gives a Crap! Put lipstick on that 🐖 @JohnBrennan before I take him behind the barn and revoke his English!
@foxnewspolitics @SaraCarterDC @AdamShawNY Cuomo 2020 puck up! Retire lay down @NYGovCuomo and vanish from the fray! Your done!
@CNN It would be more accurate that way!
@washingtonpost 39% supports trump. Fake news you got it wrong in 2016. Rasmussen got it right out every Democrat skewed polls
@a_padeo @lite2840 @kasie @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JohnBrennan Nope! Gop keeps the house. Democrats are losing black support by the day! There will be no impeachment and Trump wins 2020 by a landslide!
@gilmcdowell @CBSNews He is making America great again its way better than pos Obama! Who apologize to foreign dictators and who gave 150 billion to terrorists that shout death to America and Israel. President Trump would have never let our soldiers bow down to Iran to appease them!
@marklevinshow The gift that keeps on giving! Red Wave!
@BubblegumOut @NBCNews You want to know what's lame, Democrats using the black vote for votes and Trump gaining ground among blacks 39% democrats need to be worried
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Amen thank you President Trump the best President in my life time.
@The_Trump_Train @BNJenkins39 @realDonaldTrump The democrats are going down down down in flames
@BubblegumOut @NBCNews Bubble gumpy
@washingtonpost comey -Republican. Bruce ore, peter strzok, sally Yates, Andrew McCabe, suszan rice, James clapper, Michael Hayden Lisa page

@CNN CNN and @maggieNYT already trying to down play the manafort trial after weeks of o this is going to be Mueller gotcha trump case prompting it for months. Just shows how afraid they are! If Mueller loses well Maggie you are a double standard of a secret society like JFK talk about
@BubblegumOut @NBCNews He sure does its why that so many of us are doing great.  Unlike the talking point lies the democrats are trying to push! Who is the leader of the liberal party? Crumbs Pelosi, maxine impeachment waters, socialist government owes you- Alexandria Cortez. No America Cuomo
@Rosemarie4311 @NBCNews Real American
@NBCNews Do you think my President Trump going to give a crap! I think not!
@washingtonpost Winning! Winning! Winning!
@a_padeo @lite2840 @kasie @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JohnBrennan O how's @BarackObama  Chicago doing! Last I've heard horrible and poor and in deep poverty to everyone! Gun violence everywhere bloodshed! Just how Obama left the rest of the country! Now its in his backyard! What a disgrace to the corrupt peice of garbage! Obama's a Traitor!
@a_padeo @kasie @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JohnBrennan Actually I do it on purpose, it makes me more real and not politically correct! So go put lipstick on that 🐖 Brennan! I would take him behind the school and ground him to the pulp and pull his pantyhose over his head!
@marklevinshow His father would be so ashamed of him even his father fought for our great country and praised our great nation all the time! The dems can thank Andrew Cuomo for their house hopes
@a_padeo @kasie @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JohnBrennan Brennan is a liar. Havnt you heard that the Trump tower meeting was setup by Bruce ore Christopher Steele and fbi who was in contact with the Russian lawyer before and after the meeting. Ore and Steele txt prove this! MSM won't tell because it changes their Russian collusion hoax
@CBSNews Maybe he should if he ever tries to use his clearance to overthrow a President of the United States. And to all the liberals who thinks it is a partisan thing! Remember James comey is a Republican or have you forgot!
@kasie @MSNBC @Morning_Joe Conspiracy msnbc! Isn't a good morning for you because you can't get top secret access since your Russian lie peddler  @JohnBrennan lost his clearance! What you going to do o no! Here one! Christopher Steele fbi Bruce ore and used the Russian lawyer to setup tower meet! Ores txt!
@writerhaha @NBCNews You sure don't know much about the US o you had to Google it. You probably don't live here.
@RepCicilline Hey you liberal lying pos! President Trump is winning for America 100 times by far than corrupt Obama I just watched your 5 min of fame with @ShannonBream  yoh are so out of touch with middle America go back to tiny road island and stay U are sick of dismay to the American people
@writerhaha @NBCNews You are an idiot they let you manage it youselfs but like I've said its not free everyone that works pays for it. Only exception to the blind and disabled! And its mostly retirement anyways. Ya there is fraud and abuse sometimes but they do a good job of catching it
@writerhaha @NBCNews I have said the Eceptions and that is for the blind or disabled and I don't mind helping people who are not a abaled body or the elderly! But to make it available for a able body if they can still work pushing it to far. But like I said its not free
@writerhaha @NBCNews I get it back into retirement or a future disability, like I said I pay for it. Its not a free government hand out!
@BMWmermaid @washingtonpost @JohnBrennan Yep at least I speak better English than communist Brennan. If he was in my class I would shove every English word right down is fake peice of throat and make him S***t it out! What a idiot
@AmericanVoterUS @DHSBlueCampaign Ask Hillary about that one!
@writerhaha @NBCNews Social security administration duh! But its mostly based on work credits you have put in. Eception on SSI which is based on household income!
@writerhaha @NBCNews Are you that dumb everyone that works pays in social security and to get social security you have to have enough work credits built up. Except people who are blind and disabled. They either get SSI which is based on total household income. Social security disability is work creds
@writerhaha @NBCNews Social security is retirement people has paid in. Like I said we pay for our way!
@KMGGaryde @BattleBornThom Yes we will ride that red wave big time, as Andrew Cuomo has given us a birthday present in August! Thank you @nycgov who hates America boy your father would be disappointed in you at least he fought for this great nation and has always considered America the greatest on earth!
@CNN Fake news is peddling fake news poll skewed with all democrats and when they couldn't get a Republican to poll they just made it up!  When you go across this country millions are going spaceforce, spaceforce
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @JohnBrennan sometimes I think about, if we was in school, is take you behind the barn and unload a tone of bricks on you! Than pull you by your underwear and dunk you in the commode for just a curtisy flush!!
@washingtonpost @JohnBrennan sometimes I think about, if we was in school, is take you behind the barn and unload a tone of bricks on you! Than pull you by your underwear and dunk you in the commode for just a curtisy flush!
@writerhaha @NBCNews We don't have free things we pay our way! Socialism is denied and will always be denied! Ask Venezuela how it turned out for them! When their people trying to illegally come here because their own socialist country screwed them over
@writerhaha @NBCNews At least we pay our way! That why socialism is getting denied everywhere democrats turn they can barely win just one election!
@MSNBC Conspiracy msnbc! It makes a distain on our constitution peddling your Russian fake lies! Now you don't have at fake @JohnBrennan to feed your load of BS! Who was legally revoked by P Trump! Who is the commander and chief of all executive power! Put a lipstick on your pig Brennan
@writerhaha @NBCNews We have plenty of doctors whose willing to pay their own way to achieve the American dream! Nothing is free in this world unless your a democrat who thinks our freedoms was just given to us! Socialism is a embarrassment to the men and women who fought for our freedoms!
@AmericanVoterUS The corruption didn't start at Obama but got really bad under him. JFK was killed trying to expose the deep state and was going to bring them in the open. We need to see everything they have on JFK even though it will embarrass the deep state.
@NBCNews Socialism at its best!
@CNN @nycgov has already pucked up the democrats by Andrew Cuomo remarks that America was never great comment. House is staying in gop hands. Sucks for the so called blue wave P Trump is already winning in the last two weeks big time. RED WAVE
@ChelseaClinton @thehill O and your mom owes a lot of money to dictators who payed for her to win. Its why she wants to run again in 2020. Because she owes a lot to foreign powers who dumped a trillion to her in 2016. Shes probably already got death threats. That's why she scared into hiding.
@ChelseaClinton @thehill I bet your dad slaved you around peddling cocaine out of Arkansas. O that's right you was a two timing drug mule. The wicked dog of the south. Clintons fall to suicide- murder ECT. Clintons owe so many dictators who tried to rig a already bought election
@RKJ65 @realDonaldTrump The popular vote does not get to be President of the United States Hillary could of had 50 million votes, above President Trump and still lose the election In the constitution it is all about having the electoral college vote to become President so you uneducated liberals READ IT
@KASDad @JohnBrennan Go look it up he wanted a communist in power back in the old days
@KASDad @JohnBrennan Using his security clearance going on tv to try and use it against a sitting us President is attempting to overthrowing the us government and dumb a** Brennan has blantly said he wants to get trump out of the oval office. If he even true there will be 64 million of us to rise up
@ABC Mueller can try and subpoena President Trump but I guarantee he will lose it in the supreme court and plus it gives us ammunition to have a huge red rave in November
@KASDad It states on line 29 of the security clearance form " using your clearance to try and overthrow the us government is grounds to revoke" and that is what @JohnBrennan who voted for a communist tried to do! Liberals need to read their constitution! And stop trying to make it up
@gregpmiller If you use your clearance to try and overthrow the us government, than you will get revoked! And the President has a constitutional right under article 2 who is Commander and chief of all executive so he is well with in his authority to revoke or fire people anytime your hogwash
@KASDad This guy should have his clearance revoked if he plans to have it to overthrow the President! President Trump is well with in his constitutional authority to revoke clearances or fire anyone! I don't know where liberals get their constitution from. Maybe a cracker jack box
@Reuters No one trying to scar the who voted for communist into silence. On line 29 of the security clearance form it ask " are you going to use your clearance to overthrow the US government" and that what you are trying to do @JohnBrennan u can talk all you want hat not with top secret!
@ShepNewsTeam Sheppard you want the truth of how the Russian probe got started! Christopher Steele was peddling his Russian lies to FBI and Bruce ore and he also worked with the FBI and Bruce ore to setup the trump tower meeting with Russian lawyer. It was proved through ores txts. Stop lying
@ShepNewsTeam You are a dumb liberal who needs to go to work for CNN or conspiracy tv msnbc. Sheppard smith does not need to peddle his lies on tv anymore
@NBCNews Omarosa's new story teller of salacious lies!
@CNN And I pushed back against CNN, the top fake news network!
@AzRealtorLynn @Top_Sergeant @realDonaldTrump The left don't know how to keep from embarrassing themselves! When the Mueller investigations blow up, I won't feel sorry for them!

@cnnbrk I reject CNN gangster like fake news!
@FoxNews Bye bye  Rahman Emanuel!
@washingtonpost We will for the next 6 years or so!
@FoxNews @SteveHiltonx @Comey Mueller and Obama have a secret plan to pick Obama choice for President in 2020! That's why Mueller wants to get at Trump!

@CNN See what happens when the left started the abolish ice campaign. What a disgrace!
@CNN @facebook put infowars back!
@washingtonpost Lol the only way to defeat democrats is to keep President Trump
@FoxNews @AlanDersh Nope it won't! Mueller can not ask questions that has to do with article 2 Presidential powers.
@FoxNews Ramp up the military exercise again
@morten @realDonaldTrump Who is a traitor to the country and part of the deep state who botched the 9/11 commission report. And who covered it up. And who works for Obama to stop trump

@washingtonpost Why don't you talk about Senator Mark Warner and Obama forcing tech giants to find made up Russian collusion on their platforms, to make the American public to believe their Russian lies. To use against President Trump and to keep Mueller investigations going And ban republicans
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations! red wave on its way!
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump It's doesn't matter a win a win. Democrats are trying to make stupid excuses for their poor loss! A Democrat that almost wins does not get to have a vote in Congress. That's what it's all about!
@FoxNews @KarlRove Democrats are already trying to down play it if they lose tonight! A loss is still a loss
@LGillon2 @harvey_meade @FoxNews @Judgenap Hillary is as crooked as it gets she has broken more laws than anybody.Lets see with her emails plus conspiracy to defraud the United States with Obama it takes two or more persons to prove conspiracy and Obama knew about the classified emails being sent through her emails server
@FoxNews President Trump needs to send in the national guard under title 10 of the national guard act
