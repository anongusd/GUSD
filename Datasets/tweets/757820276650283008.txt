@RLHotchkiss @SallyAlbright I absolutely agree but I'm having trouble understanding why this problem belongs in this convo. Dems oppose these discriminatory laws

@SenatorBaldwin I'm so proud you're my senator. Looking forward to knocking doors for you in the upcoming race.
@MackayIM I tussled with this person earlier. They don't believe in germ theory. It's not going anywhere.
@Cattlechildren Just being around a sick person does not always result in transmission, and many are not very transmissible or dangerous
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison no, they can't.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison I've studied immunology and have no idea what you're talking about. It may just be that twitter isn't the way
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Please provide evidence to support your claims
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison No. This is a separate question. Why don't you believe disease is communicable?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Many docs and nurses from Sierra Leone died. Of Ebola
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison What about the immune system involves + feedback? How do you interpret that term?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Please explain germ theory as you understand it
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Or can be contained by PPE (flu). But lots of the docs treating ebola patients put their lives in danger
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Many of the diseases doctors confront are not readily communicable in context (eg malaria, need mosquitoes)
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison The number and degree depend on the "germ" in question. That makes a complex field of study, not a moot point
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Those circumstances lead to competition, not clearance of infection. And why shouldn't viruses compete?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Nothing of the sort. They're a necessary but not sufficient contributor.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Where are you getting that? Chronic worm infections are very, very common.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Not every expowed person gets infected. Not every infected person gets sick. Complexity doesn't undermine it
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison They're also generally healthy and well nourished, and sick peoples' families were the primary caretakers.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Please elaborate. Why couldn't infection be part of a sustainable system? Wildlife are chock full of worms...
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Like what?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Wearing PPE, washing their hands, fully vaxed... and exposure =/= infection, especially if you're healthy
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison What kind of evidence, if any, would convince you that "germs" cause disease?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Why's that?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Why do you believe germ theory is a lie?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 But they can and do, demonstrably. What logic?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison What virus? Are you suggesting immunity should be hereditary?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Why do you believe this?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 No. But they were hard to make. Target infected cells
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison  Virus is outside cells first.we develop vax for virus (prevent infection) or infected cells (end infection)
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Nope. But it's one reason why it is difficult to develop vax for eg HPV
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison ...the immune system has no way of knowing it's there
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison If a virus stays inside of cells, quietly reproducing without bursting out or making recognizable proteins
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Is this the complete definition?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Chronic infections exist, sure. So what, though?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison They don't act like vaccines, which are designed to evoke lasting responses against free microbes
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Chronic infections last because the virus is evading effective immune responses
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit  ...some don't. Some work against viruses outside cells; some work against free virions.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 The immune system  includes a lot of different mechanisms. Some last long-term
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Oh! I think I see the problem . This is a really complex immunological question.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 And measles and rashes? Walk me through it like I'm an idiot.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 What are you seeing as the link between chronic infections and vaccines?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Could you please describe what "measles" means to you?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison I'm trying to understand you here. Do you believe that all cases of rash were diagnosed as measles?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 We can have a dialogue, or you can continue to be insulting. Civility matters.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 That question isn't medically coherent. Could you provide a link or something?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison Lots of things cause rashes. Like poison ivy. And smallpox. And wool sweaters. They aren't all related.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Because disease prevention is my field; I want to understand how to communicate
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Because I'm genuinely curious about your thought process and evidence.
@Awithonelison @Cattlechildren @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Ooof. I don't think this is going anywhere.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 That is very interesting. What do you think causes disease?
@Awithonelison @Cattlechildren @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS PERSON
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 ...you'll have to clarify your point. And be less rude.
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Do you believe the disease known as "measles" is not caused by measles virus?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Huh? No. Why do you ask? What point are you trying to make?
@Cattlechildren @Awithonelison @HenningTveit @biker_bowen83 Measles is a virus. Rash is a symptom of infection. Why are you saying this?

@MackayIM @EntomoLogical If science is politicized, though, I'd argue it's not the scientists' fault. We just want reality-based policy.
@MackayIM @EntomoLogical I think the question is whether politics (jockeying for power) and policy (applying science) are different.
