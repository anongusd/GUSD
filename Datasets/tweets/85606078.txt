The key findings from this poll found that a) most Americans don’t fully understand what “Medicare for All” really means, b) when informed, most don’t actually support it, and c) what they truly want is lower costs, not government-run health care. https://t.co/QvpuvfrphU https://t.co/7DA8iyVlFB
What people really want is for Congress to lower health care costs, rather than create a new government-run health care system. See more poll results: https://t.co/QvpuvfrphU https://t.co/IAjJnaRFAV

Two sets of rules – one for U.S.-Canada trade and another for U.S.-Mexico trade – would be costly for U.S. companies and could erode America’s global competitiveness. We shouldn’t backtrack on the regulatory relief the administration has already put in place. #TrilateralTuesday
