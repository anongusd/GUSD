@DavidLimbaugh It's mutual!
I'm on @seanhannity tonight discussing Obama admin plan to sell F-16s to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood government. They never cease to amaze.
Sec Clinton just said, "What difference does it make?" if the administration lied to the American people re Benghazi. Truly stunning.
Too bad President Obama isn't as dedicated to disarming al Qaeda as he is to disarming law-abiding Americans.
I'll be on @seanhannity tonight discussing al Qaeda taking American hostages in Algeria. Seems Obama was wrong--al Qaeda not in retreat.
Here in Wyoming: among highest # gun owners per capita, and among lowest # incidents of gun violence. Infringing 2nd Amend. not the answer.
Obama believes if you can't pay your bills, you just borrow more. Most Americans know if you can't pay your bills, you stop spending.
Obama says Congress is "ordering" him to spend. And borrowing more $ is only option. This is a true addiction. GOP must stop him. Now.

On this day in 1924, Nellie Tayloe Ross was elected Governor of Wyoming - first woman ever elected Governor of a U.S. State. #EqualityState.
Benghazi - Increasingly clear Obama more committed to protecting false image that he defeated al Qaeda than he was w/protecting our people.
Just about to join @seanhannity to discuss lack of Obama administration action while attack on Benghazi was underway. Please tune in.
@PressSec should be asked today - did Obama go to bed 9/11/12 knowing Benghazi attack ongoing without taking any action to save our people?
POTUS, VP, SecDef in Oval Office as White House rec'd real time reports about Benghazi attack.  Attack lasted 7 hours. Obama did nothing.
Breaking on @gretawire: Emails show White House knew, while Benghazi attack underway,that al Qaeda linked group had claimed responsibility.

Just turned on CSPAN in my NYC hotel room to find Dick Cheney thrashing John Edwards in 2004 VP debate. As I've said before - Best VP Ever!
Sec Clinton needs to explain why she blamed video for Benghazi attacks since State Dept knew then that wasn't true. http://t.co/CAYZKmG7
Watching news today, our 8-yr-old asked, "Mom, is Big Bird a Republican?" 	12-yr-old answered, "When he grows up he will be." Exactly.

Tune in to @gretawire tonight. I'll be on with Greta discussing latest developments in the Middle East &amp; Obama Admin response.
Despite apparent al Qaeda role, Obama says attacks "spontaneous" &amp; not about U.S. "See no evil" is not effective national security policy.
Reports Al Qaeda affiliates behind Libya attack. Despite death of UBL, al Qaeda still active &amp; Obama has no terrorist interrogation program.
@TexasLeftist
They kill US diplomats, attack US embassies, replace US flag with al Qaeda flag. WH says "protests not directed at US." http://t.co/6zCG8usp

VP Cheney-If Obama had participated in daily intel brief he'd realize who really deserves credit for getting bin laden. http://t.co/Jc40H6M1
Obama has skipped more than half his daily intelligence briefs - what do you suppose he is doing instead? http://t.co/SaVAxEtR
@seanhannity tonight-If Obama had been POTUS on 9/11, he wouldn't have implemented key intel program that prevented further attacks on U.S.
Think Dems are strong supporters of Israel? Watch replay of #DNC2012 delegates booing Jerusalem as Israel's capital at today's convention.
