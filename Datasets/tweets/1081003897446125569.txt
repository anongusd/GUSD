@NickJFuentes  hey nick, I am a fan of your show and I had an idea for a show.		For the day of the Jussie Smollet verdict, you talk all about that specific hoax. The day (or show) after, you talk about all the other hatecrime hoaxes.		If you need help, I can provide it.

@ava The idea of a hate-crime is complete bullshit. There are lord knows how many of unsolved murders in Chicago and one assault (assuming its real, unlike Jussie Smollett) based on race garners 12 detectives and who knows how many police officers.	Fuck off with your bullshit.
@shannonrwatts Most of these people also come from single-mother backgrounds. Kids need both parents

@cody1mac @iamebonylaquise You have devolved into just bitching about spelling, keep it up bud.	Focus on that instead of important shit.
@cody1mac @iamebonylaquise Congratulations pal, you know your shit. Do you go onto the blacker parts of twitter and correct their Ebonics. Do you correct people on the street when a black person goes ‚Äúamberlampce‚Äù or ‚Äúwuz‚Äù.
@cody1mac @iamebonylaquise I admit I‚Äôm not the best at my typing, but it‚Äôs Twitter for fucks sake. 		So you assume that just because someone disagrees with you, and there is a ‚ÄúRussian funded Troll Farm‚Äù, that makes it so that EVERYONE who disagrees with you is now a Russian bot.		Your fucking nuts man
@cody1mac @iamebonylaquise I‚Äôve simply directed this conversation to what I view as the largest problem 	Yes we agree that Jared is a fucking asshole, but what‚Äôs with all this Russian talk. 	Do you call anyone you don‚Äôt like a Russian? Because if so your actually pretty racist yourself
@cody1mac @iamebonylaquise 1. What the fuck are you even talking about, the Soros situation is a Democrat thing.	2. I am guessing that you are calling Trump a puppet based on actions favorable towards Russia, The overwhelming majority of Trump‚Äôs policy is dedicated to Israel and their racial supremacy.

RT @NickJFuentes: AOC is such a bitch, fuck you
@cody1mac @iamebonylaquise You certainly make a lot of assumptions about my political alignment.	If you want I can give you an education in real politics but if you want to be correct in your claims, Trump is MUCH more of an Israeli ‚Äúinstalled meat-puppet‚Äù.	Also check your grammar, meat-puppet is hyphened.
