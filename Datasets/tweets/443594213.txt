@DeleMomodu @www The message is discordant, and does not appreciate the grievances of the yearning masses who are at the receiving end of bad leadership. To deny that corruption was never responsible for hardship in the country is wilful distortion of reality.
@guypbenson Miss/Mrs Omar needs to understand that US:Israel relationship is close to being sacred and any right or wrong condemnation of Israel's behavior is like committing political suicide for any US politicians.
@renoomokri @MBuhari Successful people don't engage the populace the way you do,  a sign that you are just a Trojan horse and like a tortoise, you had help climbing a fence. You are an embodiment of everything that ails this country.
@renoomokri This is the only thing you know how to do best, it is a pity that you get to have pulpit to expose your dark and irredeemable soul.
@atiku We will overlook this low bar status you took because you are still healing.
@DeleMomodu We don't have electoral college in Nigeria and Atiku didn't win the popular votes, so why is Bush/Gore's election similar to this one? There is no recount and no Florida's scenario here
@DeleMomodu @www to speak
@DeleMomodu @www I think the word (we) should not be used because it sounds too contemptible for you speak for all Nigerians. We certainly don't see things the same way and majority of the people just gave another mandate.
@DeleMomodu The Buhari's voters that you soiled, toiled and dehumanized as church rats in various unsolicited pendulum Opeds
@benmurraybruce @OfficialPDPNig You are just a trouble maker,  nothing  is substantive about your silence. We are divided but not as extremely polarized as you expected us to be.  So your wishful hatred didn't give you the victory.
@daily_trust Even GEJ can't  forget this Kano's post traumatic stress disorder.
@renoomokri @MBuhari People like Reno are only relevant because  there is so much polarization in this country. He is like Medusa's head to any moving ambition. Once you  enlist Reno,  your ambition is stagnated.
@VerityOracle I am not getting  rewarded despite being part of consensus?
@DeleMomodu Do you mean the scripted candidate with lots of same old political and deceptive theatrical statements filled with I will(s) and I can(s). Theatrics that continue to fail us because they grossly under appreciate the intractable problems of NGA.
@DeleMomodu @Olusegunverdict @DeleMomodu  There is a big difference between I will do this and how I will do this, the former is vague and may never happen but the latter is sound and analytically  prepared with a template at hand. Atiku belongs to the former.
@atiku @EbubeIsaac There have been numerous violations of the constitution in this country by all branches of government. What baffles me is that, when an everyday Nigerian is denied justice, we don't get this kind of uproar... from concerned citizens or PDP.  Why now ?
@lary101 @GhenhisKhan @EbubeIsaac @MBuhari @ReutersAfrica @KakaakiSocial @MrFixNigeria @AIT_Online @channelstv Let me tell you this, in an advanced democracy like U..S.A., during 2008 election, some Republicans voted for Obama and that does not make them Democrats or lesser Republicans
@lary101 @GhenhisKhan @EbubeIsaac @MBuhari @ReutersAfrica @KakaakiSocial @MrFixNigeria @AIT_Online @channelstv The Northerner factor has always been part of our politics for so long and no matter how suspicious it may seem, the president should have around him people he can trust. It is his administration...I  have not seen any red flag from this president based on his character (only).
@lary101 @GhenhisKhan @EbubeIsaac @MBuhari @ReutersAfrica @KakaakiSocial @MrFixNigeria @AIT_Online @channelstv Bro, stop making the mistake of addressing people who favour one party figure from APC as APC members. I want PMB doesn't mean that I am an APC member. I only support Buhari not APC.
The federal character that has failed this country for so long is what you are worried about.We allow bad people to reap from our identity crisis, loot our future, miscarry justice and still defend them while we bleed because they come from our tribes.I can't help but shed tears.

@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu I just can't wait for you to congratulate the APC mob on its looming larger than expected margin of victory. I hope you will embrace the spirit of sportsmanship that GEJ showed us. GEJ is a true sportsman.
@A_AJIMUTABA @benmurraybruce @OfficialPDPNig No country can totally eradicate terrorism, it can only be mitigated. I say without equivocation that the capabilities of the Boko Haram sect to conduct large scale attacks, the likes of those that happened under PDP's watch have been diminished. Thanks to PMB.
@benmurraybruce @OfficialPDPNig  When your party is so clueless about Boko Haram and terrorism, it is logical that you will spin innuendos about Boko Haram for political gains.
@holiomogbe @theshadyexpress The tremor would strike you soon, PMB will cruise to victory  and your hateful and smear campaign is going to be rewarded with gloat.

@EmmyReggie @Ifeabunike @henryshield @henry I understand you too bro. Honestly Buhari does not have the capacity to govern but he is disciplinary. I have courage in his vice and members of his cabinet. Voting Atiku is taking a step backward.
@FMac_Mayor @EmmyReggie @Ifeabunike @henryshield @henry PMB and Atiku know too well that tribalism, religion, ethnicity and patriarchy are factors that pull votes. A debate is too artificial nd rigorous 4 their worst natural appeal to an identity politics that requires no skill, intelligence other than who am I and who is in majority?
@FMac_Mayor @EmmyReggie @Ifeabunike @henryshield @henry Brother, if things were right, APC won't be a party where I had chosen my preferred candidate. I clearly don't have a choice since PDP chose Atiku.
@FMac_Mayor @Ifeabunike @EmmyReggie @henryshield @henry I know you support Atiku, let us leave the judgement to our so called voters from different geopolitical zones. I am sorry you will be hit so hard by the Buhari's tremor.

@pastoroladipo @DeleMomodu The consequences of this ur so called mirage takes a four year toll on the people and you think we should keep experimenting with our lives. How long do we have to live for before realizing that we are surrendering our future to bad judgements from so called experts.

@pastoroladipo @DeleMomodu Are you going to always trust the judgement of the same man who told you to oppose Jonathan and vote Buhari, only to turn around again by asking you to vote Atiku because he misunderstood Buhari too? We know same will happen to Atiku in the end.
RT @ColeSeyeAdebayo: @AregeOlamide @DeleMomodu Thank you for this... Very apt!
@Ifeabunike @henryshield @henry Very correct about strengthening our democratic institutions just like what we have happening with the various checks on his unconstitutional actions. My opinion is that Atiku looks like a leader who will compromise our withering and very weak institutions.
@Ifeabunike @henryshield @henry I like you for being realistic, in reference to the best, we do have more competent people than this two but our  shady politics and divisive country do not guarantee an affordable and fair process to have the competent ones on the platform.
@DeleMomodu I have said it many times, Nigerian democracy is controlled by tricksters, Atiku being a player is not politically savvy, same reason he fell out of favor from the grand patron (OBJ) some years back until now. He commits political suicides a lot.
@DeleMomodu Nigerians, do not allow uncle Dele be your everyday morning coffee, he will defend anything as long as it is in his interest to do so. Democracy in Nigeria has been hijacked from the people by a microscopic few. This contest is a battle of two entitled personalities.
@Ifeabunike @henryshield @henry Then you are telling me that Atiku is the best choice and the most qualified candidate in the country to lead us.
@henryshield @Henry Stop this rubbish, you know better that our politics has always been about identity not issues. Usman in Kano is devoted to Buhari like a cult because he sees himself in Buhari, and Nweke from Ebonyi wants Atiku because  Peter Obi is his man from East. PMB and Atiku know.

@benmurraybruce @GEJonathan @ProfOsinbajo Over five hundred thousand youths are  currently empowered receiving close to hundred dollars as monthly stipends, spread across thirty six states.

@benmurraybruce @MBuhari Dear voters, follow the substance of what is happening in the country, don't be fooled by PDP's sudden amnesia. PDP is using fear mongering and tapping into the anger of identity politics to steal your mandate.

@AriwoolaAkinwa1 @DeleMomodu Being democratic is beyond accepting the result of a true and fair election but also the democratic conduct of engaging your opponent.
@BayoOmobepade @DeleMomodu @BBayo I think you need to learn more to grow, Hillary Clinton made the same mistake by calling Trump's supporters 'Basket of deplorables' and that statement hurts her candidacy. Political campaign is about issues not pettiness.
@AriwoolaAkinwa1 @DeleMomodu I admire Dele Momodu, in fact I tag him my best syndicate columnist in Africa. I am not a fan of blind followership,it is healthy for us to have differing views about something if not anything.
@AriwoolaAkinwa1 @DeleMomodu In a Democracy, hate speeches by citizens against an authority or any entity are countered by love speeches from well meaning people, and only prosecuted if they constitute threats to public safety or lives and properties of the targets.
@AriwoolaAkinwa1 @DeleMomodu It shows that you are either ignorant about why the founders of democracy prioritized free speech or you claim to like what you dislike(so...so.. dishonest)
@DeleMomodu Politics is about passionate disagreement that is settled at the ballot box. We settle the fight over the future of the country on election day, irrespective of whose view got a mandate. We come together, unite and move forward.
@DeleMomodu If u claim to be a true democrat as you said in today's pendulum, then act like one sir. Dehumanizing Buhari's supporters as poor people trying to tear down rich people is not only undemocratic but a disservice to democracy. The right to vote ur choice!!!!
@benmurraybruce @OfficialPDPNig @inecnigeria @OfficialAPCNg Election is only rigged when PDP is not winning or going to win.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu They created an alternate reality for you to live in,  morosed you with sham achievements and now you are a victim of moral bankruptcy.	I really enjoyed our back and forth, though we happen to be on different sides of the aisle. We both love our country indeed, just disagreement.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu You have also proven to me why a con artist is successful because he enjoys the support of people like you.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu America's economy started taking that great economic  road under Obama and extended under Trump. But look at the stock market now, u will realize how bad it has become bcoz of Trump's style of leadership and hurtful trade wars he has engaged US into.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu What is your evidence of crime against Buhari?
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu We had more than one coup in the history of this country. That was the practice of governing under military rule.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu Your charges and allegations are flimsy,   this is a desperate attempt to defame a good man when there is nothing bad to scoop from his upright legacy. If you want to smear  Buhari,  then you need to frame him up for a crime he didn't commit.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu What you have failed to grasp is that politics  can't be removed from governing. Democracy is a form of government and politics is the axis of democracy. Win the votes and govern.
@iamTobounty @DeleMomodu Really deep bro
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu The only caricature being peddled by Atiku supporters is his Management and business skills.  So he is  the new Dangote or Otedola? don't insult our collective intelligence by parading his thin resume as godly achievements.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu Atiku can't  stand Buhari also if their history of patriotism is to go by. Look at at his military credentials, he honored his duty, fought alongside other patriots to defend his country.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu We don't trust him, we have no reasons to trust him and he has helped to expand our distrust in him by his inter party  defections.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu Winning primaries requires currying favor from delegates or donors alike. That means waging a methodical campaign not picking up dumb fights that alienates the party's base...
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu I think your problem is wilful ignorance,  based on what you said, is Atiku politically savvy? if you have to  commit political suicide to win in politics then your game will always be a dead end. Politics has always been a compelling  game for men of wits.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu I have said it in the past that the party is no longer itself anymore, Obj left bcoz of this. If FFK, Reno, Fayose, and Dancing senator are voices of the party, then there is still a need for redemption. For now, the incumbent's party seem less dangerous.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu Presidents get credit for a good economy and they own the legacies. Same reason Jonathan didn't get credited for Yaradua's minimal achievements while he was the Vice president. If Atiku had a new road to take us through, then he could have won d party's primary not Jonathan .
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu Don't  distort facts, I am not comparing Obasanjo's achievements against Buhari's. The whole anti corruption  crusade started with Obasanjo (EFCC e. t. c. ) Even Yaradua despite being forced on us was a good pick by OBJ. Economic metrics under Obj was greater dan what we have now
@henryshield Why don't you run for office to start with, instead of being a critic with an empty political resume.
@theshadyexpress @DeleMomodu In fact, they missed a generational opportunity that could have shaped this nation by reclaiming its rightful spot in the world.
@gwamnasrule @GabrielChima3 @JustHezy @bashcaliz4u @DeleMomodu @atiku What is new about the road, we had this guy as VP for 8yrs....he has been the face of cross party defections...Atiku has likability problem just like any establishment candidate.

@DeleMomodu It hurts, very painful but it is the people's house. Leadership is more than occasional praises from supporters, criticism from opposition or dissenters and personal insults from unhinged citizens.
@DeleMomodu Is that the highest road you can walk...?       If u are democratic, then being in the nation's greatest house bears a great burden. In great democracies around the world, citizens call their presidents awful names and presidents defend their right to do so under free speech.

@Viva56860733 @oladipo75261853 @DeleMomodu @Oladipo Your stance is unfair,  PDP had sixteen years in power and APC barely had four and yet PDP is struggling to compete with APC on minimal achievements. That says it all........
@DeleMomodu Sixteen good years of corruption,  nobody took responsibility,  no redemption, no apology yet we are still recovering stashed away  money.
@DeleMomodu I am a firm believer in the rule of law, I've never accused Atiku of any crime without  evidence. In fact, I don't ve any  evidence of crime against Atiku. I don't agree with the entire PDP's apparatus due to sixteen years of misrule.
@DeleMomodu It is the Atiku's effect, Uncle Dele has a reset button when things don't go as expected.
@DeleMomodu What we envy about the US or any European country is their patriotism not foreign policy or defense of the nation's interest abroad.
@oladipo75261853 @DeleMomodu @oladipo, U.S.A. is a perfect example of such country but uncle Dele does not need to go tru that morally rotten path to justify why we should take a second look at Atiku's candidacy.
@DeleMomodu How can this man be uttering nonsense, did China build wealth from proceeds of slavery, corruption blah blah blah. If some people did those things must we go down that path?
@DeleMomodu Self advertised pauper!!! what a better way to describe a former military head of state, another sign of when a good man is broken by a poisonous presidential aspirant who is without remorse.
@DeleMomodu Stop this trash talk, the president has the right to hire the best brains in the country. He has advisers and appointees from all spheres of life. Parading sainthood is a distraction from what ails Nigeria which is as PMB correctly understands it 'Anemic And Endemic Corruption.

@obyezeks I am convinced at this point that your campaign is all about getting a seat at the table from whosoever wins the presidency. A movement is what you are interested in creating not a serious contest. I think you are successful at creating the platform.
@obyezeks One important question, as a presidential candidate, how do you intend to achieve your vision of the country in the presence of a disoriented legislature(NGR Senate &amp; house of Rep) knowing that governing is interdependent among the various arms?
@obyezeks Your campaign slogans and team should reflect our diversity..the interest of ordinary Nigerians from North, South and East of different creed, status, tribe, religion, educated and uneducated should be represented. Winning would be difficult if you don't capture core voting blocs
@obyezeks I am enthralled by your candidacy, your grasp of issues affecting this country is mind blowing but beyond this informative campaign of yours, there is a political ingredient missing in your winning strategy which is courting the people who truly vote.
@benmurraybruce I am sorry sir, you  are smart, brilliant and well informed than the average Nigerian politician but the party you identify with including some members of your party wouldn't let the little light of yours shine or lit...we need patriots not federal characters (informal usage).
@jaketapper I think the media helped Trump win in 2016 by continually looping Trump's hateful speeches and HRC's empty emails instead of educating voters on the need for truthful messages. The media took Trump's bait in 2016...2018 mdtrm election is a time to fight...

@DeleMomodu Look at true democracies around the world, people bled, died, and sacrificed from Selma, Montgomery,American civil war, Gwanju struggle -candle light struggle (S.korea). They earned their freedom to shape their destinies through prayers and actions not prayer only as in Nigerians
@DeleMomodu True democracy relies on the choices of an awakened, functionally educated, enlightened and actively participating electorate. There are fundamental qualities electorate should possess, otherwise democracy will only be a stage act not power of choices.

@bukolasaraki If this is true sir, then it is deeply disturbing. We should not keep quiet as our silence on this situation will be an encouragement.

@TheYinkaShitta_ @DeleMomodu To keep us safe... sorry not save
@TheYinkaShitta_ @DeleMomodu Brother, considering  defense spending and relating it to our overall budget, we either don't have the money or our generated revenues not enough to give us the level of security required to keep us save.
@DeleMomodu I don't think we can counter the forces that suborn our citizens or  arming foreign nationals or rogue political office holders bleeding us to death for personal and capital gains.
@DeleMomodu Good and insightful opinion but sir, if you would indulge me, I think no matter who we elect as president in this country, insecurity will always be his/her political demise just because we don't have the resources and training to gather intelligence.

@EbubeIsaac I would like to know your political principle and where you stand. Is your  world view on justice, standard behavior hinged on whom world power you approve or disapprove?
@EbubeIsaac That is a genuine concern looking at the state of these countries after America's invasion and intervention in some. I believe in competition between superpowers to achieve lasting peace by preventing hegemony but Russia lacks a democratic dialogue for that.
@EbubeIsaac I understand why Russia should be worried about America's foreign policy but I am more focused on Russia' s sham democracy and Prez. Putin using the antagonism of the West to solidify his hold on power. That is ruthless, inimical to freedom and  universal human rights.
@EbubeIsaac I understand that America has failed in many unimaginable ways as regard the pursuit of national interest and violation of international laws but the greatness of the country is its enduring capacity to admit its mistakes, seek a new path forward and lead .
@EbubeIsaac I also think he is a brilliant diplomat, but at what point does a man choose valued principles over moral turpitude when working for a murderous regime? You can spin it whichever way but  you don't do good work for the devil and be proud of it.
@EbubeIsaac I admire the depth of knowledge you display in the legal profession and world politics but it is sad that with your     verbally fierce activism,good understanding of healthy competition, you have chosen to sympathize with bad state actors who silence critics and jail opponents.

@kiikersneaker @SenatorCollins From a moral perspective, does your concern over illegal immigration justifies why innocent children who had no hands in their parents adventures be thrown out of the only country they know, sacrificed and proud of? #Home of the brave; nation of immigrants.
@kiikersneaker @SenatorCollins The same way CHIP expired because GOP failed to work on the deadline so is DACA doomed to expire under GOP's watch. Dems are trying to prevent another crisis since GOP cannot commit to anything apart from extreme right wing policies.
@SenatorCollins That is the problem, CHIP can be funded separately and not attached to spending bill and it expired under GOP's nose.
@SenateMajLdr Fund CHIP separately, must it be attached to the spending bill?

Fear, uncertainty and doubt is what the government is creating to discourage investors on cryptos. They would face hell from us and we've got no fear.

@gcg_matix I hope so sir and I appreciate the seeming love we both have for our country.
@gcg_matix It is true that the president could have abused his powers but peaceful dialogue is the only feasible solution. IPOB needs to drop secession
@gcg_matix Threat pose by Fulani herdsmen is worrisome, the govt. shld be criticized&amp; held reponsible for this but we shld not use it to justify IPOB.
