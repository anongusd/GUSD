"you do not understand," @tedcruz to @realDonaldTrump on #iran and other global challenges. #GOPDebate
#CUBA #GOPDebate clash gives @marcorubio a #FloridaPrimary play against @realDonaldTrump. @tedcruz says trump no diff than @JohnKerry
and @tedcruz  joins anti @realdonaldtrump commander in chief chorus: "the answer isn't to yell, 'china bad,' 'muslim bad'" #GOPDebate
Clear @realDonaldTrump prefers Hammurabi's Code 2 current law for counter terror strategey; says US being treated "like suckers" #GOPDebate
"i'm not interested in being political correct - I'm interested in being correct," @marcorubio back at @realDonaldTrump. #GOPDebate
asked 2 clarify, @realDonaldTrump stands by "Islam hates us." @marcorubio retort: "Presidents cant just say what they want." #GOPDebate
#immigration focus early weeks got @realDonaldTrump started, but his trade talk critical to expanding his appeal. #GOPDebate
"I cant get over how civil it is up here" - @realDonaldTrump as he pretty gently pushes back @tedcruz #GOPDebate
9:32pE .. @tedcruz adds a little spice and suggests @realDonaldTrump shouldn't be GOP nominee bc history of $$ to DEMS. #GOPDebate
military bidding process and self funding campaigns apparently part of @realDonaldTrump plan 2 fix #SocialSecurity #GOPDebate
again "waste, fraud and abuse" from @realDonaldTrump but no specifics as to how to not bankrupt Soc Security by not changing it. #GOPDebate
yes, a policy beginning, but several openings to spice it up w contrasts, but seems no one wants to go on attack first. so far. #CNNDebate

A lot switched from @HillaryClinton to @BarackObama late '08. Possible, but would take major shift in race.  https://t.co/UZSGdUSOWr

DEM pledged delegate math: needed to clinch.                                   		HC: needs 59.1% 	BS: Needs 67.0% 	This is pledged only
GOP math: % delegates won then % of remaining to clinch 	 DT: 44.3% needs 54.2%	 TC 34.6%  - 61.3% 	MR 14.8%  - 75.7 %	JK 5.2%  - 82.7%
