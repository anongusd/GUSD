Dear @DonaldJTrumpJr, why is no one talking about 3.2% beer that they sold in 1982 to the kids between 18 and 20?  Typical beer today is 6% or greater if a malt liquor.  Back then you could drink a 12 pack and be fine after an hour of no drinking, urinating or #ralphing.
In 1982 my uncle tells me he went to a bar where for $3 they would lock the front door and everyone drank for free until someone had to use the bathroom, then it ended.  How? 3.2 Beer !!		Why is no one talking about 3.2 Beer?
When my uncle was a senior in 1982 he used to take a bus to the bar on Thursday nights for $5 Drink and Drown night.  All the seniors were there drinking all night long.  All went to class the next day.  How? 3.2 Beer !!!

3.2 beer was created for 18 to 20 year olds so they could drink but with a throddle.  Why? Because they knew high schoolers and college kids were not as mature as a 21 year old.  You litterally had to drink continuously to keep a big buzz on.  And it wore off much faster.
VERY IMPORTANT!!!		Dear @BrettKavanaugh &amp; #MAGA, why is it no one has brought up the fact that the beer Judge K was drinking in high school was 3.2% beer not 6% beer?  This is a huge fact that has been overlooked.		It takes double the quantity to get the same buzz on 3.2 beer!!
