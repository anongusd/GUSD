@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda The people who come to our food pantry say that they get more from the govt then if they got a job.  Another problem Congress doesn't seem to care about
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda I am glad you help others.  We all need to help one another.  No 2 situations are the same.  &amp; for me if Americans are struggling with homelessness or lack of food we need to help them before helping other countries.  Hope you have a good day.  Stay warm
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda Sorry for assuming then.  I misunderstood.  You can have a civil conversation if you respect both parties involved.
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda Thank you Trump

@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda She's speaking her truth.  Have a heart or is that just for those breaking our laws &amp; taking advantage of our country
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda U CANNOT get a job without an address.  I have studied &amp; worked with homeless.  I am also a social worker.  We are talking about KIDS not grown adults.  Kids
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda That's your comment.  Really?
@ABC Where was it asked?
@ABC Who voted in this poll?  Not me?
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda Do you live in a bubble?  Have a heart.  Our vets are homeless because they dont get the help they deserve,  people with addictions are homeless (need help), &amp; many others who dont have a home.  Can't get a job if you dont have an address
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda We are talking about kids.  Kids in America who don't have both parents involved often have a parent who's not around because they are working 2/3 jobs to make ends meet.  Those kids end up in gangs.  Those kids suffer.  Those kids need us
@faithkayy @TheRightMelissa @NancyKoda I never blamed anyone.  I wouldn't blame them.  I said it's not fair we take care of them when we have plenty of people in America who need us
@RealSaavedra Someone ask her if she has a fence up around her property?

@BGugelman @pamelapersinger @mrshellwinger @SenSchumer @DHSgov Being in custody getting to care can't stop irreversible damage.  Come on.  Dehydration takes days to kill you, not as few hrs.  So yes her parents murdered her &amp; should be held accountable
@Josi67386071 @SenSchumer @DHSgov I never sad it wasn't sad.  Heartbreaking but blaming people aren't at fault is wrong. Her parents had responsibility of her.  Fact she was dehydrated.  Death from dehydration takes days, on average 10 days. She was suffering for days with no help.  Sounds like murder by parents
@Josi67386071 @SenSchumer @DHSgov At the end.  Not for days or weeks.  A few hrs.  You don't die from dehydration in a few hrs
@mt_02125 @SenSchumer @DHSgov We told them to turn back.  They cannot be responsible when they are given someone in septic.  The damage was done days before.  Her parents killed her
@SecNielsen u &amp; our border patrol are NOT at fault for this young girls death.  Those who paid for the people to come here are.  Parents who didn't feed or give drink to her are
@BGugelman @pamelapersinger @mrshellwinger @SenSchumer @DHSgov No blaming her parents for not giving her food or drink long enough that she went septic.  Dehydration won't kill u in 8 hrs but parents who don't feed you or give u drink for days will
@vickiemwv @SenSchumer @vmpalmerton @DHSgov Not the father who starved her right?
@Josi67386071 @SenSchumer @DHSgov By the father not our people.  Come on.  Research death by dehydration.  Doesn't happen in 8 hrs
@Lizbeth9753 @SenSchumer @DHSgov He can't.  He helped pay for them to come
@TLY540 @SenSchumer @DHSgov How.  He didnt pay for them to come
@GaussJylle @SenSchumer @DHSgov Against the father
@BGStJohn @SenSchumer @DHSgov How do you know these are facts?  How do you know they are actually their children?
@Thru_Hiker09 @SenSchumer @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump Her father is the only one at fault
@jambie61 @SenSchumer @DHSgov @washingtonpost Democrat Congress brought &amp; paid for this
@jambie61 @SenSchumer @DHSgov @washingtonpost It's not correct.  No way do you get dehydration so bad you go septic in 8 hrs.  No way.  Her father murder her
@lexicorona2 @tibbs_m249 @SenSchumer @DHSgov U r kidding right.  You don't die of dehydration in only 8 hrs.  Way to have faith in lies then in our own workers
@SenSchumer @DHSgov R u kidding me?  Not her father right?  She got dehydration so bad and died in only 8 hrs right? If someone should be held accountable how about those who paid them to come here or her father who didn't feed her or give her drink. Not the people who airlifted her to the hospital
@SharkScareTrump It shouldn't be about him.  It should be about our country
@SharkScareTrump Who is?
@gzuckier @ducatipace1 @Alyssa_Milano She was already dehydrated then
@IndyaMoore @jpmead1985 @Alyssa_Milano She was already dying.  We did what we could for her.  Father is to blame
@Alyssa_Milano Because her father did not feed her or give her water.  Her father is to blame

@CNNTonight Where is the actual blame on those actually at fault?  You are causing hate for people trying to protect us.  Our agents did NOT cause her deyrdration

@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Yes you are ridicule me but that is ok.  I can handle it.
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily I get a feeling that you have been through a lot &amp; have a lot of heartache.  You seem bitter &amp; closed off.  Broken almost.  For all of th as t I am sorry
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily I don't hate you.  I don't know u.  I don't persecute you.
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily God.  U?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Many prayers for you.  I am truly sorry for the pain you have experienced in your life.  God loves you always
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Your words.....So your worship includes unbiblical practices then? https://t.co/EbC1yxrM1M
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Yes you did
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily R u kidding me?  The more you say the more sorry I feel for you.  What happened to you?  Whatever it is I am sorry for your pain
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily It's your word
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily I do not worship my Christmas tree or my decorations.  This is absurd.  Please move on
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily A form created by man
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Do you follow a man made religion?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily What is your religion?  Do you know?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily And I said I worship where?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Based on your interpretation which may not be right
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Then what is it?  I am trying to educate myself
@Curts33 @kaitogaius I just want to say it gives me great hope just to hear that young Catholics want to go to mass &amp; are upset that they can't.  I am so happy.  Thank you.  God bless all of you
I loved being attacked by so called religious people who when asked what their faith or religion is won't answer. 1 simple question
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily When did I say I worship unbiblical pagan traditions.  Never said that
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily We?  Who are 'we'?  Those who make their own beliefs
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily The truth of the bible as you know it.  As a person of their own religion
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily So you have no religion but your own?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Have a wonderful day.  May God soften your heart &amp; open it his truth
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily https://t.co/TheJSrEBBQ
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Jesus taught the Apostles.  Jesus ask them to lead people to him.  Your leader was ask by God to start a new religion?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily So one of those you follow?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily You follow a man made religion?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Is it yours?  Born again huh?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily My worship?  I do not worship anyone or thing but God
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily But a man started it.  Not God
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Do you have a relationship with God
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Why do I continue to communicate with someone closed minded?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Follow a religion founded by man
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Yet has no name
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Just as Jesus said follow me not man made religion
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily You cannot prove God doesn't authorize practice or that he doesn't approve.  Good day
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Founded by who? https://t.co/E1WQRdSwqo
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily You won't tell me your religion because it is founded by man not God.  Jesus Christ founded the Catholic church.  Have a pleasant day
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Still does not say bible alone.  Please if you can't have the decency to tell me your religion move on.  You are obviously not open to a true discussion
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily What religion are you?  I am Catholic.  I am Christian because I believe in Jesus Christ.  Christian does not mean bible alone
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Where in the bible does it say bible alone?  Why did Jesus send the 12 Apostles off to spread the good news?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Again my faith is not bible alone.  So you must be born again?  Am I right?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily What is your faith?  I never said to only take care of those less fortunate at Christmas.  Never...ever did I say that
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Who tried to murder Jesus on Dec 25th?  What religion are you?  Why continue to ask me questions that I answer when u won't have the decency to answer my 1 question?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily What is your faith?  God asks me to love others as he loves me &amp; treat others so they may see Christ in my words &amp; actions
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily My religion is not 'bible alone' BUT Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Christ which is absolutely biblical.  What religion are you?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Christian means a follower of Christ it does not mean sola scriptura.  That comes from man.  They are no longer pagan traditions.  They are given new meaning
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily What religion are you?  What training of the bible have you had?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Just because something isn't in the bible doesn't mean it's not from God.  Jesus is from the bible.  His birth is from the bible.  How someone chooses to celebrate his birth is their own.  What religion are you?
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily we always take care of those less fortunate through out the year but it's extra special for all of us to receive a present for Jesus' birth.  Jesus loves seeing his children smiling &amp; happy
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Jesus was born just not in Dec.  For us when isn't what's important.  The church settled on December 25 at the end of the third century, so that the date coincideed with the existing pagan festivals. That way, it was easier to convince pagans to accept Christianity
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily Can't have his death if he was not born.  You are clearly not Catholic or open minded to others views

They also know we always take care of those less fortunate but it's extra special for all of us to receive a present for Jesus' birth.  Jesus loves seeing his children smiling &amp; happy
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily 2/2 I have the Nativity and advent wreath as focal points in our house.  My children know what is most important about it all.  I am so sorry u r so bah humbug
@sknws @FlushRivet @GKCdaily 1/2 I'm Catholic.  We follow the bible &amp; also have tradition.  We took pagan 'holidays' &amp; 'tradition' &amp; put Christian significance in order to convert them.  Bible - Jesus was born. Jesus tells us to love one another &amp; take care of those less fortunate

@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter I believe all people are children of God.  All people have free will.  All people will be judge.  I am not to judge since I am a sinner but to love others &amp; show others God's love
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter So very judgemental. Martin Luther was right in calling out what the church was doing wrong. Remember man is flawed. Selling indulgences is not ok but our leaders did it. Allowing children 2 be molested is NOT ok. The core/foundation will always remain true. The creed is my faith
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter I DO NOT reject the church that Jesus found.  My eyes were open &amp; I was brought home.  The Apostles creed &amp; Nicene creed are my faith.  I try to live the 10 commandments &amp; love others as God loves me.  He created us all &amp; loves all of us
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter This is s horrible post.  We each have to answer to God &amp; be accountable for our choices
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter Wow.  You are blinded &amp; for that I am truly sorry.  I truly hope God softens your heart to be a little less judgemental

@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter I am Roman Catholic.  I am NOT Protestant.  You keep posting the same thing over &amp; over.  Fact Jesus founded the church.  Fact Jesus asks us to love one another as I love you.  I chose to do that.  I will not judge u but love u &amp; pray God guides u.
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter He again never said he approves hid choices he saying that his friend is showing love &amp; where there is love there is God.
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter Both of those r a verse out of a book. You have 2 look at who the author was writing 2 &amp; why. Have u had training on studying the bible? All I can say is 2 pray to God to guide you. I know plenty of people &amp; they are not bad people. They are children of God that need our prayers
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter All those are false.  He doesn't reject Catholic teaching.  He cannot keep people in mortal sin only we can keep ourselves there.  How did he altar them?  He simply is asking us to pray for those he knows really need our prayers
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter If they are calling homosexuals evil then yes but guess what?  Jesus founded the church.  He never said homosexuals are evil.  The people that make up the church are far from perfect &amp; do get things wrong
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter I did read that.  And I am not sure what my problem is.  Is it praying for those I know are struggling?  Or is it me choosing to show love to those others see as evil?
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter Moral evil?  They are not evil.  Give me a break.  Usually when a question is asked an answer follows.  My questions were never answered
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter That is all Father Martin is asking of us.  To pray for them &amp; love them (not the sin).  Ask that God leads them to make the right choices.  That God will lead them from sin
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter I never said I reject scripture.  I have actually been studying it &amp; have learned a lot.  That is why I ask the questions u aren't answering.  Why aren't u answering the questions?
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter They received their own due penalty.  Doesn't say you shouldn't pray for them or you should judge them.  Seems this is about a certain group that doesn't believe in God.  Just because u consider yourself part of LGBT doesn't mean u don't believe in God.
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter Can you please tell me more about the rest of this book &amp; who the intended audience was?  Let me guess you believe everything in the bible is fact &amp; not just stories to guide us right?
I'm watching @AETV on cults, esp Jehovah witnesses &amp; it sounds so much like what is happening in the Catholic Church.  We are the Church &amp; we should demand change.  Jesus founded our church &amp; he would not want any of this.  Do what's right @USCCB
@ArchbishopGomez Wow.  Thank you for this.  I have been so very angry &amp; you have given me hope in our future.  Thank you for doing the right thing
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter Again u r taking 1 verse out of 1 book without relating it to the author or the intended audience.  This has nothing to do with people's sexual orientation or their identity.  These people suffer day in &amp; day out.  Whether we agree with their choices or not we should pray 4 them
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter I am so sorry you feel it's your job to judge others.  I am a part of the Catholic church because it began with Jesus &amp; I can receive him in communion.  All these 'rules' were not given to us by Jesus.  He asks us to love one another &amp; to be Christ like.  I hope your heart opens
@RealMattCouch Goodbye!  Goodbye!  She should have been fired so very long ago
@GKCdaily Lol.  They can't handle hearing that.  My nephews were told from the get go there was no Santa.  They never had any Christmas magic in their lives.  Every Christmas was a let down for them
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter God doesn't ask us to take 1 verse out of the whole bible &amp; use it to persecute others.  He gives it to us as a tool to be the best we can be.  There is background about each book.  There is an audience for each book.
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter You can love someone &amp; not accept their sins.  We should pray for them.  You have no clue what they live through.
@CtCathCorner @schoolofprayerh @BenignoVito @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter The Catholic Church teaching is to love one another.
@CtCathCorner @schoolofprayerh @BenignoVito @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter The date is 2003.  In 2003 that is what the Vatican said.  The Vatican can change what is says.  Our church is founded by Jesus Christ.  Our faith is to love one another as God loves us.

@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter Full acceptance as PEOPLE.  Not as sin
@CtCathCorner @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter No one said accept their sin.  Accept that they are a child of God.  God created them &amp; God can judge them.  Ye who has not sinned may cast the 1st stone
@CtCathCorner @schoolofprayerh @BenignoVito @CanonTwoTwelve @Michael_Voris @ChristineNiles1 @Church_Militant @BigPulpit @Pontifex @RaymondArroyo @EWTN @Pewsitter No where does it say he accepts their 'sin' or they should be kept in sin.

@Sonoel90 @JamesMartinSJ When you compare it like that I get it.  While Religion is separate when inhumane things are happening it is our job as Catholics to speak up against them.

@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel She lied.  Why would they?  I come from a family of lawyers I understand very well.  She is not credible.  She is a paid liar
@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel 18 was legal age then.  Not a lie.  Those other sayings could easily be inside jokes with friends.  Me &amp; my friends had sayings just between us.  Just because the sleazy internet says it means something now doesn't make it true either.  No proof.  I drank &amp; drank.  1/3
@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel His dreamer when being attacked &amp; destroyed off lies was understandable.  When he over stepped he apologized.  A job interview looks at references &amp; not false accusations.  His job interview was weeks ago &amp; he passed with flying colors.  Let's keep being unfair though. 3/3
@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel I don't really drink anymore.  Does that mean I have a drinking problem?  When you have alcoholics in your family you know what a drinking problem is &amp; you know what a drunk is.  He is neither.  His demeanor as a judge in court has never been an issue.  His demeanor 2/3
@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel Because news won't report it doesn't mean it's not true.  How can they?  If they say anything about her then they are attacking a 'victim'.

@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel Why would she have something different to say that she didn't say under oath?  She lied under oath actual.  What did he lie about?  He was defensive.  Very justifiable &amp; he apologized twice for it

@iant1337 @7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP I was not in his shoes.  I can't imagine.  Seeing a grown man crying is not someone who thinks he already has the job.  Shows a broken man fighting for his reputation.  He apolgized then and even now he wrote an apology.  I think that is huge.
@iant1337 @7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP I honestly don't think it's that at all.  If he is who he says he is to be accused of something so heinous and have your young vulnerable daughter hear such horrible things would rip you apart.  He was defensive.  Rightly so.  Do I think he could of toned it down? Yes but 1/2
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN He had to prepare for his own testimony.  Try and put yourself in his shoes.  He did apologize for over stepping and now he even apologizes again for it.  No one can imagine what he was feeling.  Having your daughters here such horrible things must have crushed him
@tpotanos @DanaGuefen @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN How am I focused on the wrong things?  Facts is wrong now? I am confused.  Thanks for being civil :)  Have a good night
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN judicial temperament and drinking in college do not relate
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Why would they.  Drinking in college should not affect 20 yrs later.  I would be screwed if it did.  Drinking wasn't under investigation.  Sexual assault was.  Who are the witnesses for that??
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Who are they?
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN When he was in application he passed with flying questions.  This last hearing wasn't for SCOTUS it was are you a rapist?  All the years he was a lawyer &amp; judge are pristine.  People will say &amp; do anything for money or propaganda
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins There isn't a formula but more times than not you play it over &amp; over.  What did I do? Was it my fault?

@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins I apologize for assuming.  Doesn't make me partisan just defensive.  Sorry.
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Same can be said for dems.  Oh wait.  Rep have never paid people to spread vicious lies or withhold information.  Dems do that
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Allegations with no evidence or proof.  If he did it go press charges &amp; lock him up.  I never said victims shouldn't be heard or respected.  She was given a chance &amp; produced nothing.  Corroborating witnesses?  Who?
@DanaGuefen @tpotanos @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN If u r falsely accused u would be too.  Was not out of control.  Lies wouldn't be involved in a job.  A police record would be.  But she didn't involve the police...why?

@tpotanos @DanaGuefen @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Sorry but no?  It's not my opinion it's fact.  If it wasn't fact why doesn't she press charges?  Because there is nothing.  Thank you for sharing that.  Shows he is more than qualified.  He didn't worry about being accused either.
@iant1337 @7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP But they won't accept it.  That's what's unfair.  Nothing can be proven.  No evidence but yet a man &amp; his family are still being prosecuted.  So wrong
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins HRC isn't Pres but she should be locked up too
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Dif u see the polygraph?  I thought no one has seen it.  She also trained her friend on how to take a polygraph test.  Not proof.  No point in an investigation into a bunch of nothing.  What did he lie about?  She did plenty of lying.
@William79278472 @GunPackingLib @GarrettHaake @daveweigel Actually they would just ask questions but she has no answers so questioning would go no where.
@iant1337 @7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP They weren't falsely accused.  I never called them scumbags.  I wouldn't

If u were a virgin til later &amp; treated people respectfully &amp; out of no where r accused of assault &amp; gang raping.  U have 2 daughters who hear things from their friends &amp; their parents.  U would be defensive but he even apologized when he overstepped
@iant1337 @7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP He didn't either.  He said he drank.  He said he even drank a lot at times.  Doesn't make u a drunk &amp; doesn't mean you blacked out.  Trust me if the background checks found ANYTHING suspicious he would not be up for confirmation. But if it's he said she said why is he guilty
@BrinaBrady She had her own hearing.  Questions were asked.  In the end she said she had nothing more.
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins A job interview checks references.  His checked out.  Hers did not.  A job is not gonna give weight to a non-factual story.  I hope he presses charges
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins They questioned credible sources.  She doesn't want to turn over her test then no interviews.  Seriously.  I'm sticking to facts.  Fact Ford profited big time for these false accusations
@DanaScottLO @KHagenJohnson @SenatorHeitkamp 2/2 absolutely.  He wasn't drunk or belligerent.  Be around drinks 1st &amp; then call him a drunk.  Ignorant.  Get out of here.  I am wide open.  Oh Ford made over $900,000 off her lies
@DanaScottLO @KHagenJohnson @SenatorHeitkamp How is it checked?  What proof is there he choked her? Witness...no....police report...no.  he didnt start a bar fight.  He threw ice in college. Doesn't make him a rapist.  R u kidding me.  Belligerent alcoholic during hearing? He is accused of something horrible.  Defensive 1/2
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins It's not criminal.  Why not?  She could press charges &amp; she could have him arrested.  Why wouldn't she do that?
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins She refused to turn over the polygraph.  No one ever saw it.  Was it made up?  Hmmmmm

@DaveyXCX @gerbskiee @jammin_son @emrata She had a hearing.  R u kidding me
@emrata He was found innocent bc there is no proof no nothing.  If he is so guilty why doesn't she press charges &amp; have him arrested?
@carolinesimon66 What facts do they believe?  Wow fight for women's rights but who cares about men?
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins She is an expert on polygraph testing.  She trained her friend (I think now in the FBI) on how to test.  No one has ever seen her test by the way.  Why should he take one?  She has to prove him guilty not him prove he's innocent.
@iant1337 @7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP Bc dems are trying to drag it out through elections bc they think they r going to win &amp; they will have majority.  We do know he isn't guilty come on.  Seriously?  Honestly?
@bobbitalk By falsely accusing him.That mocks actual victims &amp; pisses off the rest of us. I don't think any threats r ok or justified but I can't stop thinking of his girls. They r old enough to be scared off lies.  They r the real victims
@Sen_JoeManchin please show that there are fair dems out there.  Vote based on what you were going to do before this circus started.
@Lettersfromerin Why?
#ImWithDrFord she needs to be held accountable.  #ConfirmKavanaugh #Kavanaugh needs to sue all involved in destroying him.
@tpotanos @DanaGuefen @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN R u kidding me?  Let someone accuse you of assault nationally when you know you would never do such a thing.
@bobbitalk She brought those threats on herself.  #Kavanaugh did NOT
@ActionAnnapolis @Sen_JoeManchin It's absolutely different.  How dare you use people of assault like that.  FORD is a LIAR
@debng Dems decided not to allow a Pres to elect one when there is a Presidential election taking place
@nocapsplz But will she be held accountable?  If she is not it does nothing to stop others
@atxmrst @FoxNews @dbongino @DiamondandSilk @TomiLahren YES
@bobbitalk What proof do you have?  NONE.  Plenty that he is innocent.  Hope you are never falsely accused
@SenatorHeitkamp What made her testimony credible?  Her ability to lie?  Yes she did awesome with her lies
@SenatorHeitkamp You will be voted out next month
@KamalaHarris Even before you heard anything on #Kavanaugh you decided not to vote.  That's what we elected you to do?  #votekamalaharrisout
@CeleryCaraway @pocho_956 @CNNPolitics @CarmenYulinCruz @FBI Wait what about all her lies?
@pocho_956 @CeleryCaraway @CNNPolitics @CarmenYulinCruz @FBI How about all her lies?
@7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP Bill clinton?  He was proven guilty.  Plenty of evidence.  None on Kavanaugh
@NancyKoda @AppSame Really?  I didnt know that.  @BobMenendezNJ who I sadly voted 4 once upon a time was under investigation for being corrupt &amp; yet people will still vote 4 him.  I'm voting 4 veteran @BobHugin
@GilRiveraPhotos @NYDailyNews @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins She lied.  She has no proof.  She lied.  She profited off accusing him
@NancyKoda @AppSame Corrupt NJ.  Not from here &amp; can't wait to leave.
@NancyKoda @AppSame Hope we can celebrate again.  We have to win otherwise we truly are going to hell in a giant hand basket
@NancyKoda @AppSame I have voted since I was 18.  Usually independents but never ever had someone I voted for win.  It really was such a glorious feeling.  I only hope it happens again.  We deserve people who fight for the best USA not who pays them the most
@SenFeinstein u were not given 5 mins to interview #Kavanaugh #u had lots of opportunities to interview him but you chose not to bring up these false allegations
Haha @SenFeinstein you can't speak because it's confidential....why start now?  They had their own hearing...what more do you want?  Investigation was into credible allegations.  None are credible
@RyanAFournier Oh please...please
@ChuckGrassley Don't listen to all these people who condemn an innocent man.  Their hatred blinds them.
@SCalaisS @ChuckGrassley @FBI Wait Kavanaugh's friend.....what about Ford &amp; her lawyers friends??
@J__A__G @ChuckGrassley He had 6 background checks all ready
@KeithRedman5 @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley U do know Ford made more than $900,000 off her false claims.  You speak of Dems not most of the Republicans
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Oh give us a break.  You are a disgrace
@AppSame @NancyKoda Oh it will be like 2016 all over again.  One of the greatest nights of my life.  Hope came back to AMERICA
@tpotanos @DanaGuefen @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN R u kidding me?  1st it was used by Democrats too.  2.  His demeanor during his hearing.  He was being accused of trying to rape a woman &amp; gang raping when he has done NOTHING.  He had every right to be angry &amp; anyone who disagrees has issues.  His testimony was heart breaking.
@tpotanos @DanaGuefen @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Presidental... In 1992, then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) gave a speech calling for Congress to delay any prospective SCOTUS pick until after then-Pres George Bush's reelection bid.¬†This yr is NOT Pres election.  Dems want to prolong to until after bc they hope to gain control
@skip_truman I believe she was assaulted but it was not Kavanaugh cause there is no proof.  Her testimony had too many holes &amp; lies.  There are seldom witnesses but she is the one who said there were witnesses.  She did.
@skip_truman Please share with me the proof cause I haven't seen or heard any.  Someone who drinks does not make them a drunk.  I drank in college &amp; I am not a drunk.
@TheMmk5258 @MattWolking @DonaldJTrumpJr The ABA is absolutely not against him.  Their rating of him has not changed.  But still where is proof.  Proof so far is that he is innocent
@DavidLBrownMD @thehill Seriously?
@skip_truman Where is the proof he did it?  Plenty of proof he didn't
@VMeier50 Yes Dems should be ashamed of themselves.  They will do anything.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
@AmericanVet15 @ChuckGrassley @marcorubio @SenatorCollins @senorrinhatch @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski Are you serious?  Your @SenFeinstein will do anything...pay anyone to stop a wonderful man.  There is NO proof ANYWHERE.  Side note...thank you for your service to our country
@RaquelCepeda @WSJ They were interviewed for hours in Congress.  She said she had nothing more to add.
@hfleet03 Welcome to the winning side &amp; more fair
@thecjpearson AMEN
@maziehirono How about paying off sex cases.  How much has the senate spent?  Let's look into all Congress taxes
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Then we should look into all members of Congress too
@ChrisMurphyCT Your kidding right?  Where is your anger at @SenFeinstein?  You had hours to interview him.  7 background checks &amp; no proof to any allegations.  You will never be satisfied.
@DanaGuefen @RVAwonk @cakes_iam @CNN Garland was never given a chance because Obama wasn't suppose to nominate someone during an election period.  Joe Biden created that &amp; Dems voted on it.  So blame the Dems
@TheRaginAsian92 @jffeeney3rd @RVAwonk @CNN Wow a fair statement.  I applaud you for that.  Sadly I believe something did happen to her in her life but more sadly I do not think it was him.  There was way to much missing
@RVAwonk @CNN No ONE can collaborate her testimony
@TwitterMoments @WSJ A day earlier is not much earlier.  Monday would have been much earlier
@danyelly_x Are you serious.  He doesn't have to prove anything.  She is accusing.  Come on you do know there were plenty of holes to start but now there is proof to back she is lying.
@UTAustin u need to take action against the girl who assaulted #Kavanaugh supporters
He didn't mock her.  He stated how she has nothing.  Said thing is even if he is #NotMyPresident he is still gonna make America &amp; the world better for all of us.  Even those who hate him.  #mypresident
@_False_Indigo_ @realDonaldTrump Proof?  What proof?  She is a lying fraud who has destroyed lives &amp; needs to be held accountable
@danyelly_x She wasn't assaulted.  No proof.  No evidence.  He also didn't mock or belittle her.  He showed she has nothing
@bookgirl8 AMEN
@ctrlamb @JamesMartinSJ Better fix a very broken organization
@RyanAFournier I just learned that what the Republicans did was put in place by Joe Biden.  During an election a President can not chose a SCOTUS.  Once again #Obama tried to break the law not Republicans
@kayrenee138 blocked me because I showed her the actual truth about #BrettKavanaugh.  Don't come to me with lies &amp; no proof.  Only truth
@kayrenee138 @ProudResister Says who?  When I was in high school/ college my group of friends had our own lingo for things.  This was in the 80's. Of course now it would be something totally different with this messed up society
@kayrenee138 @ProudResister Thank you for assuming things about me.  Are these articles from NBC who print anything without fact checking?
@kayrenee138 @ProudResister If there was evidence he lied he would not be voted in.
@kayrenee138 @ProudResister How so?  Oh &amp; she didn't?  There is evidence that she did.
@Yamiche Truth
@ProudResister He didnt mock.  He showed America how she has no facts...no evidence...no NOTHING
@kylegriffin1 Who cares.  What does this have to do with him being Pres?
@thebradfordfile @Kjmastaw No.  They need to open their eyes &amp; vote new people in
@JamesMartinSJ He's not mocking her.  He's pointing out how absurd the allegations are
#BretKavanaugh #KavanaughHearings #ImWithDrFord  the worst part of all of this is his poor daughters 10 &amp; 13.  Kids can be so mean.  Everyone is talking about this.  Who knows what is being said to those girls.  They need our prayers.  The are innocent
@GreysABC @amazonmusic Second year boycotting it.  Tell your actors &amp; actresses to stay out of politics
@JamesWoodsAlt @Kjmastaw Welcome back

@yeselson So what
@maggieserota I did stupid things &amp; sometimes drank more than I should.  I never blacked out.  Ever
Oh my.  If we are going to hold #Kavanaugh back from being SCOTUS because he threw ice at a guy I think we are all screwed.  How many people didn't do something stupid in high school or college?  Anyone?  Anyone?

If the gov't gives you a #Polygraph they don't just ask 2 questions.  1st they est a baseline by asking simple questions &amp; then a multitude of other questions.  Why asks just 2 questions?  Where's the baseline?

@magsster1 @shannonrwatts Well if they are lying then these horrible things didnt happen &amp; I don't wish an assault on anyone but there will be horrible repercussions for all if they are so for that reason I hope they aren't.  I am glad people have been sharing their stories though because of this

@magsster1 @shannonrwatts Gone under oath?  When did that happen?  If he is so guilty have the police dept investigate him &amp; arrest him.  There is no statute of limitations where they were.  Police are waiting to get a report of assault but they won't why?

@dontlookworld @UncleMary_ @lisamurkowski It isn't forced.  We know our choices before conception.  Lots of choices.  But deciding who lives or dies is no ones choice or right.
@dontlookworld @UncleMary_ @lisamurkowski It's no one's choice.  It's the universe's decision if we conceive or not &amp; if a baby lives or not.  Not mine, yours or any person.  Love the friendly debate though.  :)  did I convince you :)

@dontlookworld @UncleMary_ @lisamurkowski It's ok to disagree but it's not about our lives.  It's about those without a voice to say what they want.  Meet a girl who had an abortion.  It isn't black &amp; white. Scars remain forever &amp; lives are gone forever.  Ty for a civil convoy though :)
@dontlookworld @UncleMary_ @lisamurkowski What is your choice.  A baby is NOT your body.  They have their own body.  My choice is before. Sex/no sex, protection/none, raise the baby/ give it up.  Lots of choices.  Killing isn't one of them
