What a miss. With a gallery of many gun violence survivors @realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt say a single word about stopping the most dangerous people from getting the most dangerous weapons. Well @HouseDemocrats will. In less than 12 hours we have a hearing on background checks. #SOTU
And @realDonaldTrump could improve #healthcare by halting his constant efforts to sabotage a law that insured more Americans than ever before. No American should go broke due to illness or injury. We need #MedicareForAll. #SOTU

Those days are over. Your life matters. Your child‚Äôs freedom to learn without fear matters. Your ability to go to church without going through a metal detector matters. And young black men, who we lose every day in our cities to gun violence, matter. #EnoughIsEnough
For too long, an NRA-controlled Congress failed to pass common sense gun laws, instead allowing the most dangerous weapons to be in the hands of the most dangerous people. Predictably, thousands have died. &amp; Congress would respond w/ moments of silence &amp; zero moments of action.
Next week will be the first House hearing on reducing gun violence in 8 years. What areas would you focus on to keep us safer in our communities? #EnoughIsEnough
It‚Äôs Friday, so call me crazy, but I can‚Äôt wait for next week. On Wednesday, our @HouseJudiciary Committee will have the first hearing on gun violence in 8 years. A new Congress is putting your right to be safe over any other rights. #EnoughIsEnough #HR8

@debrajsaunders Debra, the GOP Senate passed a bill 100-0 to keep government open that @realDonaldTrump said he would sign. A similar fate awaited that bill in the GOP House. Until a small band of misfits convinced the ‚Äúgreat dealmaker‚Äù to walk away from the deal. So yes, it‚Äôs just him.
Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to re-open government.

@BenjySarlin He said if there was an assault weapons ban he‚Äôd go to war with his government. I made the point that it‚Äôs not the 18th century anymore.
@RepThomasMassie Read the thread. He‚Äôs being dramatic.
@DLoesch Fair question. Rifles. They‚Äôre more powerful and cause more carnage when used with a pistol-grip. See @ScottPelley @60Minutes piece. To reduce semi-auto pistol deaths I‚Äôd have universal background checks and mandatory reporting on mental health.
Don‚Äôt be so dramatic. No one is nuking anyone or threatening that. I‚Äôm telling you this is not the 18th Century. The argument that you would go to war with your government if an assault weapons ban was in place is ludicrous and inflames the gun debate. Which is what you want. https://t.co/oX0rY7Nbs1
She‚Äôs not lying. We should ban assault weapons by buying them  back or restricting them to ranges/clubs. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/XbRpOvXlF3
@Rambobiggs No. I prosecuted those gun crimes. The guns too often come from neighbors like Arizona and Nevada with weak laws. We are as safe as the porous borders around us. Make the laws federal, then we get safer.
@Rambobiggs Don‚Äôt be so angry pal. We can talk like adults.
@Rambobiggs Don‚Äôt be so dramatic. You claiming you need a gun to protect yourself against the government is ludicrous. But you seem like a reasonable person. If an assault weapons ban happens, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll follow law.
@Rambobiggs And it would be a short war my friend. The government has nukes. Too many of them. But they‚Äôre legit. I‚Äôm sure if we talked we could find common ground to protect our families and communities.
@Rambobiggs Wrong. Just assault weapons. Keep rifles, shotguns, pistols (if you‚Äôre not a criminal and not mentally ill). Basically, the weapons that allow you to hunt, shoot for sport, and protect your house.

The #Kavanaugh confirmation should be delayed until the sexual assault allegation against him is fully investigated. The Supreme Court, during President Obama‚Äôs last year, functioned with just 8 justices. There should be no rush to fill it now.
The promise of America is freedom. But how free are we if we pay more for a pre-existing condition? Or if we work hard but tax cuts go to the top? And when our kids are killed at their schools? Under GOP Congress, freedom has been reduced, with all the benefits going to the few.

After #AYearOfTrump, @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs agenda continues to cost young people dearly. #Millennials deserve #ABetterDeal - a promise of better jobs, better wages, and a better future.
#Millennials benefitted from the Affordable Care Act, but @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #GOPTaxScam undermines it and makes health care less affordable.
#ClimateChange will cost future generations hundreds of billions of $$$ unless we act now. Instead of investing in our future, @realDonaldTrump is setting us back.
The @realDonaldTrump #GOPTaxScam amounts to a big cutback on tax credits for investment in affordable housing, just as many low-income #millennials are entering the rental market.
By cutting the mortgage interest deduction, @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #GOPTaxScam makes it harder for #millennials ‚Äì especially in high-cost areas - to achieve the American dream of home ownership.
Weighed down by #studentdebt, #millennials struggle to save up to buy a home or start a business. @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs agenda has just set them further back. Where‚Äôs his agenda for a brighter future?
Too many #millennials are crushed by #StudentDebt, but all @realDonaldTrump has done is tried to kill the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program ‚Äì a step in the entirely wrong direction.

Under #GOPTaxScam, 13 million Americans will no longer have healthcare coverage, driving up healthcare premiums by an additional 10% every year. The premium increase will result in Americans with pre-existing conditions losing access to affordable coverage. #MakeAmericaSickAgain
#GOPTaxScam gives corporations a huge tax break in &lt;hope&gt; they‚Äôll create jobs, but most say they‚Äôll use the money for dividends &amp; share buybacks instead.	Why not just give middle class a permanent break, rather than &lt;hoping&gt; for trickle-down that won‚Äôt happen?
#GOPTaxScam forces families to pay taxes twice on much of their income by scaling back ability to write off all of their state &amp; local taxes, yet doubles the estate tax exemption to give a big cut to heirs of the wealthiest 0.2% of estates. #MakeAmericaPlutocraticAgain
