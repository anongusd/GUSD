The point is that the GOP has no business claiming it cares about families and babies while bankrupting parents with critically ill children https://t.co/97gDtqX40H
@samthielman oh yeah, there's a reason I honed in on the editor lol
This complete disconnect from the reality of pregnancy, childbirth &amp; family tragedy is exactly how you know this has nothing to do with what's best for women or children.
First of all, the GOP is bankrupting parents with kids in the NICU - stays that cost literally millions of dollars. 		And the incredibly complex moral decision to extend or withdraw care to a preemie that young can never be made by lawmakers. The idea is vile.
As the mom of a 28 week preemie, tho, it was this I found most galling: "At 24 weeks, and now even as early as 21 weeks, newborn infants have survived outside the womb with the help of neonatal intensive care." 		You have no idea what it means to have a child that early. NONE.
Most amazingly, there is no mention that the study linked to shows that women seek out abortions after 20 weeks BECAUSE of the limitations created by Republicans: insurance probs, geographical access, delays, etc
That's either a very sloppy mistake or a deliberate attempt to define abortions at 20 weeks as "late term"
In addition to obvious errors that could have been prevented with some fact-checking, the author writes about "third trimester abortions" while linking to research about abortion post-20 weeks (which is about when you get an ultrasound for fetal abnormalities)
Who ever edited that Atlantic piece on "late-term abortions" should be embarrassed

They know that late term abortions are incredible rare and done to save women's lives or because of severe fetal abnormalities. But so long as people are talking about "abortion at nine months!" no one is thinking about the laws they're writing to mandate motherhood
It's telling that conservative men are tweeting about nonexistent abortions at "40 weeks" or "outside the womb" (?!) as the GOP pushes deeply unpopular 6 week bans - it's a strategy to distract from the fact that they're trying to outlaw all abortion under any circumstances
Never trust a man who uses the word 'womb'
