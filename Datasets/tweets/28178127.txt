"What we need is not to disagree less, but to disagree better. And that starts when you turn away the rhetorical dope peddlers — the powerful people on your own side who are profiting from the culture of contempt." https://t.co/9tFhwDyxZm
"Contempt makes persuasion impossible — no one has ever been hated into agreement, after all — so its expression is either petty self-indulgence or cheap virtue signaling, neither of which wins converts." https://t.co/9tFhwDyxZm
@TPCarney @literaryeric Fantastic!
"You might be tempted to say we need to find ways to disagree less, but that is incorrect. Disagreement is good because competition is good. Competition lies behind democracy in politics and markets in the economy, which bring about excellence." https://t.co/9tFhwDgWAM
"As satisfying as it can feel to hear that your foes are irredeemable, stupid and deviant, remember: When you find yourself hating something, someone is making money or winning elections or getting more famous and powerful." https://t.co/9tFhwDyxZm
@PamelaParesky @MichaelRStrain @JonHaidt @guardian @AEI @NRO It is an excellent and important essay.
@BretStephensNYT Thank you Bret.
The practical strategies above and many more are the subject of my new book LOVE YOUR ENEMIES: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt, coming next week. Order now and get it the first day. https://t.co/YbOGYqeQBv
You can help solve our nation’s problems one person at a time, while dramatically improving your quality of life, starting today. These ideas are the subject of my @nytimes essay today: https://t.co/RW1Kk7V40c 9/9
Third, see contempt toward you as an opportunity to exhibit grace and compassion. Through your actions, you may not change the other person’s heart, but you will change your own. This will make you happier and more successful. 8/9
Second, commit to not treating others with contempt. This doesn’t mean you have to agree with them, just that you separate their ideas from their worth as people. And if you’ve ruined a friendship over politics, make amends—that’s how we break the cycle of contempt. 7/9
What can we do? First, fight against the rhetorical dope dealers. If a public figure isn’t teaching you something new or expanding your moral outlook, put them on mute. Stop letting the outrage industrial complex use your bad feelings for its own gain. 6/9
Unfortunately, the other 7%—the people who profit and prosper from the culture of contempt—wield tremendous cultural and political power today. They hold millions of Americans in the grip of a miserable addiction to hatred. 5/9
This gives way to a culture of contempt in which we treat people on the other side not as not just wrong, but worthless. This is where we are in America today, but we don't like it. Surveys show that 93% of Americans hate how divided we have become. 4/9
Scholars find motive attribution asymmetry is currently as intense between Democrats and Republicans as it is between Israelis and Palestinians. This explains why so many people see the other side not merely as ideological opponents, but as literal enemies. 3/9
Let's start by diagnosing the problem. Political scientists talk about "motive attribution asymmetry," which occurs when both sides of a dispute believe their side is motivated by love for humanity, but the other side is motivated by hatred. 2/9
I spend my days in the climate of ideas, not the weather of politics. But you can't ignore the weather when a hurricane comes ashore. That's what's happening in America: historic polarization, hatred on social media, fractured relationships. So how can we improve the weather? 1/9
The problem in America today is not incivility or intolerance. It’s something far worse. My thoughts on the culture of contempt in today's @nytopinion: https://t.co/9tFhwDyxZm

Here’s a 5-minute animated video I shot that gives you more detailed instructions on how to persuade others using these three principles. You will like the results! https://t.co/0Thl7HSB93 (7/8)
3. Use your values as a gift, not a weapon. What you believe about politics is infused with your personal values. If you weaponize your values by using them to attack others, you neutralize their moral content. Instead, share your values as something beautiful and special. (6/8)
2. Don’t assume anyone’s motives. In today’s debates, we dismiss people’s arguments not because the arguments are bad, but because we make assumptions about the motives of the people making those arguments. This is intellectually weak and often based on factual errors. (5/8)
1. Don’t try to insult others into agreement. That usually makes things worse. Research shows that when people are insulted for their beliefs, if they change their minds about the issue at all, odds are more than 3:1 that they become more extreme in their original beliefs. (4/8)
If you want to persuade others, you need to do things very differently than what you usually see on Twitter. There are three simple rules for debate that will make your arguments more persuasive to others. (3/8)
In most of our debates, no one is really convincing anyone else. Why not? One possibility is that persuasion is not our objective. It is something else, like emotional self-indulgence or virtue signaling. Another possibility is that we’ve simply lost the art of persuasion. (2/8)
We have more ways than ever before to debate one another in public, from social media to the comment sections of newspapers. But at the same time, we are getting more and more ideologically divided. Lots of data show this. (1/8)

Not that we should agree or stay silent when others say things that we disagree with. But how we disagree matters if we hope to be effective at making our case to people who don’t already agree with us (and bystanders watching the debate). 6/7
When we forget this and treat others with contempt, it turns them into permanent enemies, something social scientists call the “boomerang effect.” This makes things worse. 5/7
Furthermore, 93% of Americans believe the country is too divided. Unfortunately, the other 7% are driving the debate, ginning up fear and hatred, and profiting from it. 4/7
But the data show that this is an inaccurate portrayal of the motivations of most Americans. While there’s a lot of disagreement, only a small minority (and Twitter bots) have genuinely radical views or wish harm upon their ideological foes. 3/7
The Outrage Industrial Complex has convinced us that our ideological compatriots are motivated by love for humanity, but those on the other side are motivated by hatred for you. Social scientists call this “political motive asymmetry.” 2/7
Last week I made the argument not to express contempt for people who disagree with us. This was a common response: “They hate people like me, so they deserve contempt.” But by and large, this is based on a key error. 1/7

Contempt is highly destructive for our relationships and our health. It leads us to believe kindness, good faith debate, and reconciliation are impossible. It is a threat to our freedom and prosperity. 4/5
A “culture of contempt” has formed—a habit of seeing people who disagree with us not as merely incorrect or misguided, but as worthless. When someone treats you with contempt, you never quite forget it. It creates a permanent enemy. 3/5
One in six Americans have stopped talking to close friends and family members over politics. Millions are organizing their lives to avoid hearing viewpoints differing from their own. Ideological polarization is at higher levels than at any time since the Civil War. 2/5
Today in America, there is an “outrage industrial complex” that profits by setting us against each other. It’s impossible to miss—on TV, Twitter, politics, campus. Most of us hate it, because it’s making us miserable. 1/5

The things we can count on for deep satisfaction are the same as they have always been: faith, family, friendship, and work that serves others. Invest in these things and not only will you have what you want, you will want what you have. (6/6)
Something that always makes people smile ironically: Next time you hear about some incredible new technological innovation, say, “Finally, we will all be happy!” (5/6)
But the fact remains that we need more than innovation and material progress to build fulfilling lives. This includes those of us lucky to be living in relative abundance. (4/6)
Of course, innovation and material progress are blessings we should celebrate. They have given us comfortable lives and pulled billions of our brothers and sisters out of poverty. (3/6)
This is a timeless concept warning us that beyond a basic standard of living, greater happiness will never come from the acquisition of more and more material things. (2/6)
A Sunday reflection to get your mind off of politics for a minute. 		His Holiness @dalailama often says that the key to happiness is not having what you want, but rather, wanting what you have. (1/6)
@hangingnoodles @aClassicLiberal @robertwrighter Great references—thank you!

Remember today that all work—in the market, in the home, paid, unpaid, highly-skilled, unskilled—can and should show people their dignity through being needed by others. Celebrate Labor Day all year by giving all work the respect it demands. (10/10)
Does that sound like your family, too? If so, say a prayer of gratitude for the ambitious riffraff before you who, through dignified, ordinary work, gave you a good life. (9/10)
But they had start-up lives. They earned their success each day through hard work. They picked up and moved when necessary to support themselves and their families. (And at times, maybe, one step ahead of the law.) (8/10)
I am the descendant of people who sanctified their honest, ordinary work every day. They were not famous, or wealthy, or create any start-up companies. (7/10)
Today we worship the celebrity and the wealthy entrepreneur, as if their work were somehow worthy of greater respect than that of a guy working at a supermarket. This is a moral error. (6/10)
Our culture has turned away from the dignity of all work. Consider that this weekend a remarkably squalid trending theme was the “news” that a former popular actor was spotted working in a supermarket. (5/10)
The goal of making all people needed is why we must always focus on policies that encourage work, the acquisition of skills, and the creation of jobs. 		But there’s something even more important than policy. (4/10)
A great moral goal is to give others’ the sense of their inherent dignity. But how? The key to sensing one’s dignity is to be needed by others. (3/10)
But what is dignity? It is to be worthy of respect. Most people believe that dignity is inherent. I believe it is also radically equal. What is not equal, unfortunately, is the sense of self dignity each person possesses. (2/10)
A short Labor Day meditation. 		We often hear that work is the source of people’s dignity. (1/10)

People who say right and left can’t agree on policy should read this important piece from @aei ’s @dpletka and @amprog ‘s @VJS_Policy  https://t.co/H46dsSjCKf
@stevereid100 Yes, competition requires rules of fair play and basic morality. Violence and cheating are common ways people circumvent true competition.
@InspiringWhyNot Thank you for demonstrating the competition of ideas, my friend! Iron sharpens iron.
@AMB_London @NASA Indeed. Lots of other examples (e.g. GI Bill, interstate highways). To be pro-competition does not mean there are no public goods or claim the government is never beneficial. But also note that NASA’s geniuses were at the center of the global competition of ideas.
@RogerBanksEsq Nor am I, brother, nor am I.
@InspiringWhyNot Yes!
@RogerBanksEsq Very true
@InspiringWhyNot That is because the current environment rewards shutting down the competition of ideas. True competition requires rules of the road and basic morality. And that means respect for others, which yields solutions.
@RogerBanksEsq Idea has been articulated many times, but widely accepted much more recently.
One question for consideration: Are you grateful you don’t live in a one-party state? If so, should you be tolerant of—even grateful for?—the other party, even if you vehemently disagree and try to persuade people your ideas are better? This is how competition can unite us. (4/4)
The competition of ideas is fundamental to progress and a free society. Conformity of ideas leads to stagnation and mediocrity. On social media and elsewhere, are you trying to win the competition of ideas through persuasion, or shut it down with attacks and insults? (3/4)
There are really only two types of people: those who want to win in competition, and those who would prefer to shut competition down. The former are the strivers and entrepreneurs; the latter the monopolists and cronies. Philosophically, which are you? (2/4)
One of the greatest philosophical advances of the past century has been the recognition that competition per se creates excellence. This is true not just in sports and business, but also in politics and religion. (1/4)

If your goal is to belittle, ask, “Do I treat people on Twitter the way I would treat them in person?" If the answer is no, why not? (3/3)
If your goal is to belittle someone, then sarcasm and dismissiveness will succeed. If your goal is to persuade, then you will fail. (2/3)
Communications pro-tip: Consider the tweet you are about to send. Is it sarcastic and dismissive? Will that help achieve your goal? (1/3)
