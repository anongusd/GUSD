Notice how the problem is worst in large cities.		I think a small community with more political power could dictate better how they wish police action to be
@Kearns_SL @yarmiganosca @adjectivalnoun @jimmychamp44 @ScottHech They are a force for good or evil, is the interaction what counts.		And there’s a disconnection between expectation by the community and the rules by which cops engage ... it’ll never be perfect, but cannot be this bad.

@democraticJon What makes you think that there’s a difference between those two, other than your perspective?		I have no control over how the military operates.
@democraticJon People who control the government beg to differ.		I for one welcome paradox and contradictions, because it allows me to recognize that even the most well meaning military missions can cause unnecessary suffering, make a bad situation worst.
The most destructive effect of QE wasn’t inflation or inequality.	Is that it changed the relationship between resources and money, it opened the door for infinite debt, for people and governments.

@DiMartinoBooth The something for nothing party.
@democraticJon You realize the paradox right?		You crave for a, possibly military, intervention in Rwanda to stop a unnecessary suffering, but condemn the outsized role the military has in decision making.		Diplomacy was tried in Rwanda, the UN was present but innefective, or just too late.
@democraticJon I disagree, most mass murders in the modern age were still accomplished with cutting weapons and firearms (Rwanda for example)		Yet with all this information, we still choose what to believe and what to see.		Information alone does not bring charity into being.
@jrella75 @KamalaHarris I disagree 	There’s plenty of self medication going on for sure.		But most addicts and user do it because it feels amazing and it becomes a lifestyle.		By taking away choice, you’re also stripping away their humanity.		A judge and a psychiatrist can deprive them of rights.
@illlmattic @ScottHech We can definitely agree on that.		I’ve never understood why municipalities tailor education, health to the communities they serve... but they insist in enforcing the same rules of engagement everywhere
@democraticJon That’s true 		It’s a inescapable problem of all organized states		Mongols I’m sure where concerned about devoting too much resources to arrow making and not enough to herding.
@illlmattic @ScottHech I mean that the way cops behave and the expectations from the community they serve are different.		There’s a break in communication, whatever rules they uphold does not match expectations in the streets
@Kearns_SL @yarmiganosca @adjectivalnoun @jimmychamp44 @ScottHech It is legal for you to shot me if you can prove that invaded your home or car, or that I’m about or in the process of hurting you.		Cops are above the law, they are treated differently by judges and prosecutors.
@Kearns_SL @yarmiganosca @adjectivalnoun @jimmychamp44 @ScottHech Only if they have a way of proving reasonable threat.
@illlmattic @ScottHech Because even cops don’t enjoy killing and consider the alternative of shooting someone as a last resource that must be justified only if a imminent threat can be reasonably proven.		You’re right, community engagement could be better.

@Bridget02576477 It’s sad for sure	And I would be suing the city as well	There was a reason for shooting him, a prosecutor just acknowledged it.		If you want to prevent this in the future, ask cops what to do different to avoid being in a situation where they reasonably feared for their lives.
@Bridget02576477 They number of bullets that actually injured the victim was a small percentage of the shots fired, underscoring the low accuracy in shooting incidents and the need from law enforcement point of view of emptying their clips

@Bridget02576477 Yes, but for the pit bull or cop makes no difference.

@Bridget02576477 They could’ve used non-lethal, however that’s not as effective	They’ve could’ve disengaged, and not pursue, with the potential of leaving a dangerous criminal on the street.	They could’ve shot once, but chances are they would’ve missed (22 shots fired, 8 struck him)

@NickWhi78498155 @ScottHech Perhaps with the benefit of hindsight. But the standard of intent is to consider the state of mind and information available at the time of the shooting.		And in this case the cops were pursuing a carjacking suspect that invaded a neighbors yard, unclear if he was armed.

@patmichalina @WheresWaldoBeen @jeffdeist What exactly?
@BooRadleyHere Legally is justified in self defense, war and as a result of appropriate police action.		When the cops kill a school shooter is legal and justified because it prevents further loss of life.
@JStaggsy @jimmychamp44 @ScottHech At the time there’s  no way to know if he was unarmed.	Cops are trained to empty their clips in a shootout, since the accuracy diminishes with stress at a range of a few feet.	Is not a strong case, prosecutors have political ambitions as well, Mrs Kamala Harris started as one.
@BooRadleyHere The cops killed that man, that’s not in question.		The legal question is if it’s justified or not, like in self defense or in the context of appropriate police action.		The moral question is if it’s product of a unjustified animus against a race or minority.

@opinonhaver @aaforringer @radleybalko What’s racist is to assume that the US or it’s intelligentsia has the power to manipulate the world like chess pieces, including the decision to wage wars		It is within your power not to wage war against a foreign nation		It is not within your power to direct foreign policy
The isolationist and the neocon both make the same assumption, the interventionist power will affect the course of events, those in the ground have no say in the matter, only they can affect history ergo only they can decide and the world can be manipulated or in need of rescuing
The atheist and the fundamentalist both make the same assumption, that the religious texts are to be understood in a non-metaphorical way
@opinonhaver @aaforringer @radleybalko You assume that the intervention will change the course of history, that the cia is all powerful.		that the minds and wills of all “those” people (third world, banana rep, brown, underdeveloped) are malleable. the noble simple folk, who need your rescuing from your intervention.
@PharmaLarge @radleybalko what do you mean by “reverse tankie”?	What about the cia files?	... my point is, if a cia agent gave you money, would you betray your beliefs? 	... Why not? Only you and all Americans the only ones allowed to act in the interest of a cause without being orchestrated by someone?
@PharmaLarge @radleybalko Even dictatorships require some local support... where did it all came from? Was the cia able to convince millions of people to collaborate?
@PharmaLarge @radleybalko Consider the possibility ... just as a mental excercise... you are a CIA agent, and you’re in the middle of Nicaragua ... now what would you do every day to elect a president.		Surely if everyone around you rejected it, you couldn’t do much, right?

@Mark_Routon96 @AndyFazliu @BernieSanders Some events seem to happen	- large influx of low wage workers drives down the price	- subsidized products to destroy competition works when China does it	- free trade with a cheater leaves everyone poorer 	- work is more than money, it’s identity and community building		(3/n)
@Mark_Routon96 @AndyFazliu @BernieSanders Macro there’s very few things we know	- free trade is better than cronyism	- price control = shortages	- restricted markets = corruption and black markets	- too much inequality = political unrest		(2/n)
@Mark_Routon96 @AndyFazliu @BernieSanders No one can answer that question scientifically only ideologically 	- sanders: socialism 	- trump: protectionism	- dogmatic free trade		The end result is ... almost random, but western approach is better than socialist good intentions.		(1/n)

@JeremyBrace @hassc @ErikVoorhees I’m not sure amazon is the best employer around. They do “almost” criminally persecute their employees that try to unionize until they got called out by regulators.	And their environment is a toxic one, I personally would not work for them, given the choice.
@hassc @JeremyBrace @ErikVoorhees Not really, several millionaires, billionaires and wealthy people in general are also college dropouts, unemployed and former criminals.	... although an example don’t make a theory, one data point can refute a absolute.

@CollinBrandt1 @Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders Does that ever happened... a starving Walmart employee?

Yes, there’s always a choice, even when there’s a gun pointed at you.
RT @jeffreyatucker: Hating Amazon: where AOC and Trump completely agree.
@eastbaycalifa @AlexAanselm06 @BernieSanders I understand.	I don’t like to be in the position to having to defent Walmart either.	However I don’t think that they represent anything specially good nor evil in society, as long as people are free to not buy their products or to quit or unionize their employement.
@eastbaycalifa @AlexAanselm06 @BernieSanders I don’t like when regulators target a company, like trump with amazon.		But that doesn’t mean, their sins should go unpunished.		The labor board should defend the employees right to unionize.		And amazon should pay federal taxes.		But all companies should do that regardless
@eastbaycalifa @AlexAanselm06 @BernieSanders Yes, I’ve heard about that as well, Wallmart as McDonalds has always given me the impression of being a bad first job.	Like something you do to never come back.		I hope you are at a better place right now.
@eastbaycalifa @AlexAanselm06 @BernieSanders But you realize that not all of that is profit, I mean there’s supply chains and administrative services to pay up.
@eastbaycalifa @AlexAanselm06 @BernieSanders I don’t know Walmart as well as you, I don’t know how much of productivity goes where, but from the perspective of the employee, unless he is being forced to do it, I don’t see why someone can’t just ask for a raise.

@21huxtable @Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders Ok
@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders Yes	Evetually other competitors were able to replicate their kerosene distribution.		Regulators had a say in the matter as well, but my faith in the “disinterested” action of politicians is not as strong as yours.		Jeff Bezos fears the government now that he has enemies in it.
@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders noble objectives for sure, but a company that doesn’t produce a profit, even at the expense of direct competition with other businesses is doomed to fail.	Eventually only companies willing to grow and compete will survive.		If you look for virtue, gaze not at business leadership.
@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders Yet they did not... same with IBM, standard oil, A&amp;P, Sears and AT&amp;T.	Monopolies are almost impossible and always short lived.		Microsoft’s poor business practices were punished by the market, quickly being replaced by apple and attracted unwanted political attention.

@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders I don’t know you that well, but how can you know what is good or bad for me?	The purpose of a successful company is to destroy the competition.	Bad HR management usually doesn’t produce successful companies, high turnover is not profitable.	Tax avoidance is a crime.

@zerohedge The link for the article is not working.
@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders All companies protect they’re own interests, that is true.	And if you think they do it in a inmoral way, you should not support them.	However I don’t think Walmart is a monopoly, in fact retail is a crowded field.	Big box, online, concierge and neighborhood shops.
@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders I don’t know who of what is worth a billion, otherwise I would be a billionaire.	Resources are ilimited, because the uses we give to them did not existed in the past. What was useless now is useful.	Yes ... all powerful bodies promote themselves
@Mark_Routon96 @BernieSanders Unfairness is part of the human condition, the problem is always the same, who gets to decide... when a committee, king or president with the power to expropriate, no matter how well intentioned, has always ended in bloodshed and famine.

@IlvesToomas Yeah... I don’t know if you ever met a citizen of the US, but they don’t really lose any sleep thinking of what Mrs Merkel will think of them.	Foreign relations are divided in who to trust and who to keep in check by a show of force. 	Neither requires likability.
@IlvesToomas Circular logic:	There’s no way people could reasonably vote for Donald trump or the yellow vests, ergo the fact that they are popular on social media is evidence that the trolling campaign work.		But what’s the metric? That they are popular.

@NatCounterPunch Translation:	Dictatorships and repression are ok if we mean to redistribute wealth and reject Anglo traditional culture.
@chrissmid @donmoyn @AOC Also under that logic, there should be a economic stagnation that traces decreasing tax rates.		The correlation is not there.		I suspect that prevailing political ideas are more important than economical consequences, it was called the progressive era.	But now we live with Trumps
@chrissmid @donmoyn @AOC During and after the world wars, when it became the largest producer of goods when all the competition literally got wiped out.		Also the great depression was temporally connected with that policy		Sounds like the hardships made national cohesion a priority,then quickly forgotten
@BenjaminNorton Most of your thread is accurate.		If the US has such infinite power why don’t they use it more often?		Also, where does that leave the actual people in Venezuela? Are you just going to ignore them?		Have you ever been wrong about something you were certain? How did you found out?

@JamesMartinSJ The only lesson to be learned here is that to pass judgement you need “skin in the game”	Moralistic heights are better left to saints.
@JamesMartinSJ This is just intellectual dishonesty. Appropriating the victims of history to excuse the sins of the present.
@JamesMartinSJ The dialogue that must happen is between you and the boys, whose life you have changed for the worst.	Out of a lack of charity to your brethren.
@JamesMartinSJ Again with deflecting guilt.	Rashamon is about a king and a judge’s path in finding the truth because he has to pass judgement.	You’re not king, judge and you’re not supposed to pass judgement.
@JamesMartinSJ Public gatherings are as American as the revolution and common sense.	No, a public gathering is not guilty of the conscious (if well intentioned) actions of a grown man and his following.
@JamesMartinSJ Don’t deflect guilt to a higher institution. God doesn’t judge buildings or public charters. Only humans have souls.
@JamesMartinSJ You’re a priest, not a judge a juror or a FBI agent.	It’s not your job to find the truth and pass judgement.	You already passed judgement, because you were possessed by ideology.	You did not welcomed the stranger, and extended a trusting hand, you assumed the worst.
@JamesMartinSJ Excuses, jumping to conclusions is a rational and human thing to do. But consequences are not erased by how well you justify your reckless actions.
@JamesMartinSJ False attrition. Since it’s not regarding this particular event but a abstract event with no reali life consequences.
@JamesMartinSJ A wonderful non-apology
