Ivanka's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over. Who would trust these people with national security?
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Ivanka in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Ivanka Trump. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be a senior adviser to the president?
One of the reasons Ivanka hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.
Ivanka was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
