@FingerootB Go back and watch the games and stop googling. They benched him for Henson. The started him for a play and ripped him out. It was widely known, and why Brady was drafted in the 6th round.
@peonpaul *partially benched = benched when you are an athlete. He won it back, but they benched him.
@FingerootB He started his junior year, he was QB2 in favor of Drew Henson his senior year. That‚Äôs how I define it.
@JimMerrillNH I understand your position. I just can‚Äôt agree with it.
If there is a God, Belichick will announce his retirement.

@geofforeal Clients say a lot of things. Many dumb things. Including this.
@geofforeal Awesome. So in the 8 month difference, the lexicon apparently changed. No matter what, if you call it ‚Äúoppo research‚Äù - you are a loser.
@BasedKashiBar Well, from a partisan angle, it‚Äôs not a given until it happens. Second, I‚Äôm watching CNN, and the overwhelming consensus is  aggressively calling for resignation. So the chyron seems largely irrelevant beyond people tweeting a 3 second error.
@geofforeal 2016 Presidential. You?
@bronx_bombers99 CNN hosts are actively calling for his resignation and calling out Hypocrisy if he does not. Are you watching?
@BasedKashiBar Literally all three networks have covered it wall to wall - clearly identifying the Embattled governor as a Democrat in the actual segments. Have you watched it?
@bronx_bombers99 One a bit more than the other. Clown.
@UntraceableMC Can‚Äôt speak to whether it was or not. But on the scale of outrage, I‚Äôd suggest it‚Äôs a distant 2nd. Or 200th.

@geofforeal Are you honestly lecturing me on campaigns? GTFO.
@KatMcKinley I think you missed ‚Äúare now‚Äù in my post. I‚Äôm not making a judgement, rather than saying there seems to be a fairly clear distraction from the original target. Of course you can be upset about both.
@AmyOtto8 Not gonna argue that.
@geofforeal I‚Äôve done this longer and ‚Äúoppo research‚Äù is not a thing.
@KatMcKinley Huh?
The conservatives in my feed are now more fired up about about CNN incorrectly labeling Northam as an R than pressuring his resignation. Not saying wrong or right, just an observation.
@EsotericCD Agree. But ‚Äúopp research‚Äù &gt; ‚Äúoppo research.‚Äù

@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Cool. Now do every year from 1980 until 2018. And tell me the odds. (plus completely ignore the fact that the game has changed.).
@brianros1 Ok.... but she probably should be aware that he's a teetotaler, no?
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR It's not hard to say that at all. I see this argument is futile, given you just want to spend no matter what it's on. So good luck with that. Maybe become a Phillies fan. Or watch the 1988 Yankees.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Um.. yah. the Yankees lack star power. Good take.
(That feeling when two friends are live grammin' the same thins all day and you realize they are an item)
@timgrieve The classic! Can't go wrong. Give a try to Plymouth gin. Thank me later.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Corbin is the DEFINITION of mediocrity.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR What happens is they have the flexibility to build around them because you don't have Machado at $30 million per sucking funds or average players like Corbin vamping $25 million per year.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Corbin is a disaster on that contract. One good season. Otherwise average, below. "Why do I care..." Cause signing overpriced players is not how you win in sports.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Let me ask you...what front line stater would you have signed? Corbin for the idiotic contract the Nats gave him? Or would you have made a trade for Kluber/other that would have cost you Andujar + +...Team building takes time. Or don't you remember the 1982-92 quick fix decade?
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR OH MY GOD... PANIC AND SIGN EVERYONE TO MASSIVE DEALS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE GOOD
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR They have as good a shot as anyone. And the roster flexibility to make changes IF needed in July.
@morningmoneyben @hunterw @YankeesPR A smart take.
@hunterw @YankeesPR Dude, save it. I've forgotten more about the Yankees in the last week than you know.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR CC is a 6th starer. Loaisiga will take his spot. The team is FAR better.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Want to bet on an improvement over last year's performance?
@hunterw @YankeesPR "Team doesn't need to be shrewd." - Great take.
@hunterw @YankeesPR It's not about money, it's about flexibility. I didn't want Machado on a 10 year deal. It's idiotic. And no, you can't work around it. See the Yankees circa 2010-2015.
@hunterw @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Paxton IS an upgrade. Is it enough, most likely not, but they have plenty of flexibility to make a move in July.
@hunterw @YankeesPR 2/2:  LeMahieu is an incredibly shrewd signing as a super utility player, and the best fielder in that infield, and gives them the flexibility to trade Andujar for a front line starter in July IF that is needed.
@hunterw @YankeesPR 1/2: No, but I prefer them to massive 8-10 year contracts that cripple the organization in years 4-10, especially when given to players with attitude problems. I do like picking up a front line starter, and, assuming Ottavino is signed, maintaining a dominant bullpen.
@hunterw @YankeesPR I'm a huge Yankee fan.

@AlexaMRomero @JohnJHarwood @morningmoneyben It‚Äôs not anyone else. It‚Äôs the dirtiest player in the league already on probation. Whataboutism doesn‚Äôt fly with me.
@AlexaMRomero @JohnJHarwood @morningmoneyben Contact was not limited to head. Player clearly had head contact though, watch his reaction - it‚Äôs not cause if shoulder. It‚Äôs fine, if the league doesn‚Äôt ban Wilson now, he‚Äôll hurt another guy w/ a head shot in a few weeks and they can ban him then. Complete garbage individual.
@AlexaMRomero @JohnJHarwood @morningmoneyben Hits the player right in the temple. Which is why the player reacted as he did. Everyone on earth but capitals fans can see that, and how awful Wilson is, apparently.
@JohnJHarwood @morningmoneyben The fact that the player had released the puck more than two strides distance away from Wilson makes it even worse. Even if the hit was below the shoulder, it‚Äôs a borderline interference call (hitting player without the puck) amplified by the fact that it‚Äôs from behind.
@JohnJHarwood @morningmoneyben Defenseless player, blindsided with contact above the shoulder. Add that to the fact that Wilson is the worst repeat offender in the league  and was already playing on probation. Played hockey through college. Love toughness. Wilson is garbage.

üíØ understandable to not remember a random high school party 35 years ago.

@StevenTDennis @Brian_Riedl I can‚Äôt speak for them Steve. But, curiously, what good would calling them to testify do if all say they have no recollection of said party (and in the latest case, witness doesn‚Äôt know Kavanaugh)? They are already punishable by law through their statements.
@StevenTDennis @Brian_Riedl One nuance is that statement to committee carries legal consequences-it‚Äôs treated the same as testimony.

@NathanKleinDC @NumbersMuncher I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs perceived that way, in no small part, due to Trump/allies messaging and attempts to undermine the fact of Russian interference in the election. But true, it‚Äôs not in a vacuum.
@NathanKleinDC @NumbersMuncher I get the shorthand, But those numbers were far lower a year ago, meaning Trump/allies have likely impacted individual beliefs. Aka, most wouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù a year ago.
@NathanKleinDC @NumbersMuncher But that‚Äôs the point. Conflating an attack on the US with a personal attack on trump is the direct result of Trump/allies messaging/actions, which I think is the point
@NathanKleinDC @NumbersMuncher Isn‚Äôt that a distinction without a difference? Aka, people consider any reference to Russian meddling a personal attack rather than a collective attack on the USA, thus willing to discount it?

@farhip @ShannonBream I can tell you that I did press advance for several years at the WH and anyone disrupting a reporter‚Äôs live shot would have been politely asked to stop, and if they refused politely asked to leave.
@farhip @ShannonBream Ok. Still unclear why political events/rallies are off limits for tv journalists (or, if not off limits, they deserve to be disrupted trying to report) but a-ok for print journalists... seems to me platform shouldn‚Äôt determine ones ability to do their job. 1/2
@farhip I guess you‚Äôd have to talk to the producer to ask what the segment was trying to convey to the viewer. My guess is the noisy protests were kinda the point. But just a guess. See @ShannonBream‚Äôs feed for her experience tonight.
@farhip Fair enough. Going live to bring viewers to the scene of an event is no different than a print reporter chronicling it for their publication. IMO neither deserves to be disrupted, yet both too often are in this environment. I guess we‚Äôll have to peacefully agree to disagree!
@farhip And FWIW, that political events seem different than interviewing drunken, celebratory fans at the bar after a big game. The current environment at political events is different than the ESPN college game day broadcast.
@farhip You literally said journalists conducting TV interviews at political events/rallies deserve to be disrupted by whatever means, on a night when a TV journalist had to leave Supreme Court feeling unsafe. If that‚Äôs not what you meant, ok.
@farhip Print journalists also face harassment in the current environment if you haven‚Äôt noticed. What‚Äôs odd is that you seem to advocate for the disruption of other journalists doing their job (they ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it). That seems strange regardless of the motives of the disruptor.

@MrWalterShapiro @morningmoneyben You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs a totally meaningless event. üôÑ
@AndrewBHanna @morningmoneyben Waaaaaay oversimplified and the one shouldn‚Äôt make the mistake of saying, for electoral purposes, the GOP base &amp; Dem base (and fractions thereof) are similar.
@morningmoneyben It will mean decision makers at the DCCC &amp; DSCC (and individual campaign consultants)are going to adjust start recommending new tactics to appease and/or cultivate the voters you reference. Which means a leftward lurch.
@morningmoneyben Until you consider what it means for national (2020) positioning and reflexive action to appease a fired up, liberal base demanding action.

@morningmoneyben Shoulder to shoulder. The head, yes, is connected to the upper torso but it was not the point of contact, which is why the injury was the shoulder. Watch him leave the ice, it‚Äôs a separated shoulder. Painful, been there.
@morningmoneyben It‚Äôs not, look at other angle. Shoulder is first impact.
@morningmoneyben The head was secondary. Impact directly at the shoulder. At these speeds, head will always snap. Next time you are in the office, I‚Äôll show you my shoulder, it‚Äôs still out of the the socket because I played thru injury and never let heal. Tough injury, but not a dirty hit.
@morningmoneyben I played the game for 35 years, I know exactly what was injured - have had that same injury multiple times. Watch the reverse angle (#2 in this sequence). Separated shoulder.

@morningmoneyben @craighulse @GoldenKnights Doesn‚Äôt really matter if it was all body. It was a suspendible hit given that it was a blindsided charge thrown by a repeat offender. That kind of shot can do serious damage, and is something kids are taught not to do at the youngest levels.

@devin_omalley Because the NHL is the most inconsistent and inept league in professional sports? I played college hockey &amp; was spit on by the opponent. Player was thrown out of game and suspended for five. Marchand has been repeatedly suspended &amp; was warned against licking a few days ago.
@rorycooper I agree. But that NHL, which I prefer, is long gone. Given that, suspend the guy for the playoffs. No one will lick a player again after that. More broadly, there is clearly something wrong with Marchand and it should be addressed off the ice.
@devin_omalley It‚Äôs arguably worse. And you‚Äôre right, the nhl has a long history of doing the wrong thing.
@rorycooper Yup. In the days of Marty Mcsorley, John Kordic, Probert and Joey Kocur, he would have been beaten into line. But given where we are, suspend the guy forever.
It‚Äôs ridiculous and is no different than spitting on an opponent. Given his history &amp; the fact that NHL warned him a few days ago about this, Marchand  should be suspended for the duration of the playoffs and sent for counseling. https://t.co/ui1lDtxNEX
