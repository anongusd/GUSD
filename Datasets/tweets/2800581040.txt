If  Bezos suspects what he seems to suspect‚Äîa Saudi-Trump-AMI criminal conspiracy‚Äîhe‚Äôll presumably have his investigators turn over whatever evidence he has to the FBI and Justice Department. Or has he already?
The exposure of Saudi collusion may turn out to be as threatening to Trump as that of Russia collusion.
If Bezos‚Äôs investigator was getting close to exposing collusion between AMI, the Saudis, and Kushner-Trump in illegal hacking of Bezos‚Äôs phone, that would explain the panic at AMI.

I've assumed GOP senators would break with Trump by now on the shutdown and I've been wrong. But perhaps McConnell brings up Trump's proposal this week, falls short of 60 votes--then McConnell says no choice left but to reopen the government now and address border security later?
"Recent trends herald the return of sizable blocks of both socialist and nativist constituencies not seen since the 1920s." Interesting from James R. Rogers.	https://t.co/vpeqr8ZY3O
"Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else." Excellent.

As a non-Democrat, I'm struck by how much the media seem obsessed by possible rifts among Democrats, narrow lines they'll have to walk, stray utterances of their backbenchers, etc, than by the rather more massive fact that we have a president and administration in total meltdown.

10. Freedom isn't our only goal. But it is our key political goal. And it is the goal of freedom not just for us but for all people everywhere, the goal of freedom with its noble simplicity and even quiet grandeur, that gives meaning and elevation to the American experiment. 	END
9. The people of China deserve to be free. The people of Saudi Arabia deserve to be free. This means, ultimately, regime change. How to help different peoples achieve freedom is a complicated question. The conditions of freedom and the paths to freedom are challenging.
8. ...to diverse circumstances. We can always recall "the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God," or by the dictates of History or Science.
7. Those choices will always depend on the weighing of particular circumstances. This will often be difficult and controversial. But having the goal in mind would, I think, clarify and elevate our view. It would be a north star to help guide our reactions...
6. ...sometimes, in the way the world works, sudden. I do think a relatively open embrace of freedom as our goal, and a relatively candid debate over means, would serve the nation well. Such a debate will resolve very few of the particular choices facing us.
5. ...for a long time (Saudi Arabia). But surely our ultimate goal, after preserving and securing our and freedom, is to be a force for freedom in the world. And this means changing un-free regimes to free ones, or freer ones. This means regime change, sometimes gradual,...
4. We sometimes use political or economic pressure. We rarely use and should  rarely use military force. And of course we realize that in the real world prudence requires that we be allied with oppressive regimes, sometimes terrible regimes (the Soviet Union), and sometimes...
3. Now it goes without saying there are practical limits to what we can and should do to make this happen. Much of what we do is simply to serve as an example. We use diplomacy, public and private, to persuade other nations to move toward freedom. We help civil society abroad.
2. I'm glad to have stimulated some debate, and I hope some re-thinking. I'll put my position simply. The case for regime change shouldn't really be controversial. The U.S. at its best has always stood for the proposition that all people everywhere deserve to be free.
1. A short thread on regime change	Yesterday I asked "Shouldn‚Äôt an important U.S. foreign policy goal of the next couple of decades be regime change in China?" The question implies that I think the right answer is Yes. I gather there's been a bit of a reaction to this suggestion.

What if the Acting Attorney General refuses to offer Congress assurances on the record and under oath about maintaining the integrity of the Special Counsel investigation? Two GOP Senators (five in the new Congress) could refuse to vote to confirm Trump judges, among other steps.

New Hampshire Journal poll from August 2018: 40% of Granite State Republicans believe it would be "a good thing" for Donald Trump to have a GOP primary opponent (and 13% are unsure). 60% of unaffiliated voters‚Äîwho can also vote in the GOP primary‚Äîthink it would be a good thing.
In the 2016 New Hampshire Republican primary, Donald Trump won 100,406 out of 284,120 votes cast.
It's almost as improbable that Donald Trump be denied the nomination in 2020 as it was that he would win it in 2016.
Only 462 days until Feb. 11, 2020--the date the New Hampshire primary is currently scheduled for (it can move earlier if other states try to leapfrog). Granite Staters deserve good contests in both parties.
Terrific to wake up in Manchester and see out of my hotel window the lovely baseball field of the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. I hope to go to a game this summer. But why did they give up on the excellent name they originally took when they moved here: The New Hampshire Primaries?

The next two months are a time of peril for the Mueller investigation.
One can argue Republicans didn‚Äôt really do that well given the strong economy. One can argue Trump is on net a burden to the party and that in the long term he‚Äôll do great damage. But one must also admit the public did not rise up as one yesterday to repudiate Trump and Trumpism.
Looks like Democrats will control about 53% of the House, Republicans about 53% of the Senate. Democratic and Republican governors will govern roughly 50% of the population each. It's a pretty evenly divided country.
I assume the election will embolden Trump. His political strategy of focusing on Senate victories in red states will have worked. He'll have no incentive not to continue demagoguing immigration. He'll be tempted to fire Cabinet members and others he regards as not true loyalists.
We're running a census every two years as much as an election.

The question is just how much Democrats can expand the normal midterm electorate. It's usually safe to bet against the success of such efforts. But if not this year, when?
A fair amount of cross-cutting polling data right now. My guess: The mini-GOP rally is ending, those Republicans who are coming home have done so, and, as was the case in 1994 and 2010, in the last couple of weeks the major trend will reassert itself and the wave will get bigger.

"I believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our Government but civilization itself....Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule."	-- President Gerald Ford, August 9, 1974
Trump's claim that he can personally choose to remove individuals' clearances without consulting the agencies at which they work or used to work, without going through any of the normal procedures, with no documented showing of cause, etc., is another blow to the rule of law.
Trump was much more eager to take action against John Brennan than against Vladimir Putin.
Trump on a career DOJ attorney's security clearance: ‚ÄúI suspect I‚Äôll be taking it away very quickly.‚Äù But it's not clear Trump can legally do this. The president has broad authority but he's not unfettered by laws, rules and procedures. The rule of law constrains the president.

There is a resistance to--or skepticism of--change that characterizes traditional conservatism.

If Trump would just rename his party the Know Nothings, we could take back the honorable name of Republican for a non-nativist, non-authoritarian, liberty-loving party. https://t.co/6GCd9qMWMV
Pelosi would do her party a favor by announcing that though she looks forward to being part of a Democratic majority, she thinks it's time for a new leader, that she won't stand for Speaker, and that she's urging her fellow 75-and-over colleagues in leadership not do so as well.
I assume every Democratic House challenger will run against the culture of insider corruption that Collins exemplifies--and to make that credible, she'll have to pledge to take on all the powers that be in D.C., including in her own party.
What's amazing about the Collins scandal is what was (apparently) business as usual: he could sit on a company board, advance legislation to benefit that company, and buy and sell its stock as he wished.

By the way: I like the national anthem, I've always enjoyed singing it at ballgames and elsewhere, and I'm a particular fan of the under-appreciated fourth stanza. But Trump's demagoguery is so sickening that I think the question is a legitimate one.
The widespread playing of the national anthem before sports events began during World War II. The greatest generation, who fought so bravely in that war, grew up without benefit of this custom. Given that, and given how Trump has besmirched the practice, is it time to retire it?
