@ElliottOwensby 7/7 I put "From Russia With Love" over "Goldfinger" but this is an unpopular opinion. It should be clear, though, that  "Thunderball" is the 3rd-best Connery film, and "Diamonds are Forever" is the worst. Also, ranking ANY Moore film ahead of "Dr. No" is completely wrong
@ElliottOwensby 6/7 George Lazenby's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" was not good - but it was better than several of the Moore films (and shouldn't beat any of Craig's)
@ElliottOwensby 5/7 The Roger Moore years are generally pretty cringe-worthy, in retrospect. "Live &amp; Let Die" is not nearly as good as "The Spy Who Loved Me," which was Moore's best. I appreciate the relatively high ranking for "For Your Eyes Only," but "Moonraker" was dreck
@ElliottOwensby 4/7 In the Timothy Dalton years, it is utterly absurd to rank "Living Daylights" (which is a very solid film) below "License to Kill" - which is probably my overall pick for worst Bond movie.
@ElliottOwensby 3/7 Better on Pierce Brosnan's  films.  Good job ranking "Tomorrow Never Dies" above both "Die Another Day" &amp; "Goldeneye" (which is generally overrated b/c of the great videogame) - but "The World is Not Enough" is not better than any of the Craig films.
@ElliottOwensby 2/7 The Daniel Craig movies are generally ranked too low, and they are out of order.  "Quantum of Solace" is far, far worse than "Spectre"
