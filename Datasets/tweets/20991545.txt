Finally, wee pastry pillows filled with caramel to dander home with ♥️ https://t.co/P24C8uq7RH
Final course was this brilliant reimagining of a Black Forrest Gâteau - divine. Sharp, sharp damson and vinegar gel sitting underneath a bed of different textures of chocolate and all topped with sweet cicily. So balanced, so light. A great way to finish 7 (and a bit) courses. https://t.co/UJb7prWu8T
This cheeky pot had oodles of rhubarb, quite crisp, with white chocolate mousse and meadowsweet. The latter a total new flavour for me and holy shit it is killer. Blew my mind. https://t.co/ntUF6seTIx
Then, because we are greedy bastards, we ordered a cheese board too. Isle of mull cheddar, (I think) sheep's milk cheese and the most insanely good blue cheese. All Scottish and the French lady on our table was raving about how ace they were too. Winner winner. https://t.co/SXwZTtv4ar
Then brilliantly cooked lamb with really acidic carrots, a rich jus and I can't remember what the delicious dollop was but it was, you know, delicious. https://t.co/QXlSRHfLG8
Then hispi cabbage, which had been marinated overnight in buttermilk and just simply finished in the oven apparently, with truffle and all topped with lashings of pecorino. This packed a WALLOP. https://t.co/ZrHgP52oO0
And then delicious buttery chanterelles with an amazing beef tartare, mushroom ketchup and chopped hazelnuts. https://t.co/pqSe7dSEYT
Then monkfish, burnt cauliflower purée, cauliflower and a light lemon &amp; caper sauce. I could have lived off that cauliflower for the rest of my life. https://t.co/xZf9LBIC9l

Toby deeply unhappy at cold chill from snowy Scotland - spent the am hiding under duvet &amp; refusing to leave bed (wouldn't we all like that?)
@Jeff_C_Higgins Ha, I suspect so! Next time 😊 Have a lovely day!
@Jeff_C_Higgins 100% agree - it's v complex&amp;emotionally v difficult (but I think that's why we need to support the woman not criminalise 😊)
@Jeff_C_Higgins ...that's why we have the limits and restrictions we do. It provides safety and humanity to the process.
@Jeff_C_Higgins I wasn't saying that(?) but regardless why is that a bad argument? It's safe, available and medically the evidence is there
@Jeff_C_Higgins I'll back off now 😳😅 (I suspect we agree on much of this more than we might think, bar the actual right to an abortion!).
@Jeff_C_Higgins 5) There has to be a safe route for this procedure and the appropriate emotional &amp; financial assistance for women in need
@Jeff_C_Higgins 4) BUT undoubtedly awful experience for the poor woman in this situation - making her a criminal does not abate her trauma!
@Jeff_C_Higgins 3) All q's of morality aside, I can't countenance a world in which the state can tell a woman what to do with her body.
@Jeff_C_Higgins 2) If less stigma around abortion then they would be performed earlier, better and with less emotional trauma to all
@Jeff_C_Higgins 1) Churches are part of the problem here &amp; if they embraced sex ed (not just abstinence) it might not be an issue.
