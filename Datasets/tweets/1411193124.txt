In addition to fines from companies not complying with the small 5% tax, our plan is self-enforcing. Since the workers’ lives will improve dramatically with the #REALcard, they will likely refuse to work for non-complying employers. https://t.co/jne0IVxRaB
In contradiction to the current system, an important and desired benefit of the #REALcard permit is that it allows unauthorized immigrants to apply for a visa to return to their country of origin and re-enter the United States - this is a pro-family stance. https://t.co/lkj944XbjM
For immigrants, the benefits made available with our #REALcard are unequaled and will draw the cash economy workers “out of the shadows.” Learn more about the benefits. https://t.co/V6l6EDVOSU https://t.co/lmmiwpBeGm
The only logical source of revenue when working with the stress caused by #immigration costs is the income derived from a small but effective tax levied on our unauthorized immigrants and their employer. Read about Five + Five. https://t.co/RNt5b9EnKs
Nearly half of our unauthorized #immigrants work in the cash economy and any attempt to have them pay income taxes has been futile. ITIG's plan? A simple 5% tax on these immigrants and their employers allows them to work without fear of being punished. https://t.co/V6l6EEdpKs https://t.co/vN9bs4EfP6
The 10-year, renewable #REALCard will improve the lives of #Immigrants and is designed to bring them respect and dignity, allowing them to assimilate more easily into society, which will eliminate the two-class issue. https://t.co/8TkDcGzaFm
Our current #ImmigrationSystem has created serious backlogs in our #ImmigrationCourts, as they are flooded with applications from people throughout the world. ITIG’s approach allows for people fleeing dire circumstances to find a safe haven while they apply for #citizenship. https://t.co/OGaAxthHK4

Unfortunatly most #immigrationreform plans are “my way or the highway”. What if rather than mass deportation or mass citizenship, we give those who want to be a citizen a route to do so, and those who don’t the ability to work here and travel back to their home countries.
A question from the audience. “This seems beneficial to all those involved. What is holding this back?”
Politics sometimes holds more place than policy. But with Five + Five #immigrationreform is a non-partisan, effective and compassionate solution.

Mark Jason in @thehill — It's not personal, it's just business: A non-partisan solution for our unauthorized immigrants. https://t.co/b7yzTBbxqS
America needs a simple solution to #immigrationreform, a third way between the two extremes of mass #citizenship and mass #deportation. https://t.co/RNt5b9VZ92
The penalties in place for hiring unauthorized #immigrants are not currently well enforced because existing policies don’t adequately fund enforcement. ITIG has found a solution. A small tax on these immigrants and their employers in exchange for REAL benefits.
An immigrant who is paying taxes and earning the 10-year REALcard work permit (staying on the right side of the law) will be able to freely travel to their home country and return. It’s an #immigration win-win for the U.S.
During our research, there was a consensus that unauthorized #immigrants and their employers should share in the responsibility of mitigating issues caused by unauthorized immigration. Our simple solution is a small tax of 5 cents for every dollar.  https://t.co/PKkidqM3M8
During the @DHSgov budget review, @SenatorShaheen explains employers are in “desperate need” of workers. ITIG’s #immigrationreform plan gives individuals a renewable 10-year #REALcard permit and the ability to travel to and from their home country while working in the U.S.
ICE policy changes no longer exempt classes, such as pregnant women, from detainment. ITIG’s #REALcard lessens the burden on the #immigration process and allows unauthorized immigrants to come out of the shadows and be treated with Respect, Equality, Accountability and Legality.
The 2019 @DHSgov budget is requesting $47 billion. Americans are already paying for burdens unauthorized #immigration places on schools, #healthcare, &amp; other essential social services. ITIG has a solution that funds systems through unauthorized #immigrants and their employers.
We'll be tuning in to the @DHSgov Subcommittee Panel on @cspan in 30 mins. We're looking forward to hearing from @SenCapito on the funding request and budget justification for #homelandsecurity. https://t.co/6Iz2fmXPxe
American Citizenship needs to be merit-based, and most likely with the improved conditions our REALcard offers, fewer workers will be interested in becoming citizens.
In the event, a worker leaves a position, either by being fired or quitting, our #REALcard program allows them the freedom to switch employers or return to their country of origin.
Many unauthorized #immigrants have domestic &amp; journeyman skills that are badly needed in domestic work, infrastructure #construction, #farming &amp; food processing.

The 10-year #Realcard eliminates the incredible stress on our #immigration court systems, provides an initial avenue for those who wish to become #citizens, and cleans up Social Security and #Medicare records. https://t.co/RNt5b9VZ92
Mark Jason in @InsideSourcesDC: “Eleven million unauthorized #immigrants crowd our classrooms and fill our #emergencyrooms, and in some cases take jobs, and #Americantaxpayers pay the price.” Find out how his Five + Five plan willfix the broken system. https://t.co/R0cc2ElkBm
In contradiction to the current system, an important and desired benefit of the #REALcard permit is that it allows unauthorized #immigrants to apply for a visa to return to their country of origin and re-enter the United States - this is a #profamily stance.
We have a plan that boosts the US #economy while enabling unauthorized #Immigrants to productively assimilate into American society.
For immigrants, the benefits made available with our #REALcard are unequaled and will draw the cash economy workers “out of the shadows.” Learn more about the benefits. https://t.co/RNt5b9EnKs
With only a 5% tax on unauthorized immigrants combined with a 5% tax on their employers, billions can be filtered back into social systems in need. https://t.co/kJGr8KSxbz

Employers will be responsible for seeing that the split tax is paid to the #IRS Subcontractors, if used, will ensure the #REALcard documentation is accurate, and workers’ accounts credited.
E-Verify, biometrics and ITIG’s third way complement each other. With additional revenue being filtered into homeland security we can fix this broken system. Find out more https://t.co/V6l6EEdpKs

Take a moment to review our petition for #immigrationreform. Now’s the time - our third way is the solution. Please take the time to sign our petition if you agree. 	https://t.co/kJGr8KSxbz
When the #REALcard is earned by the unauthorized workers paying their 5 percent share of the tax, they will be free and independent. Multiple employers are supported using ITIG’s plan and workers may stay with one employer or change jobs.
The #REALcard provides an simple solution - a 10-year special work permit with the possibility of renewing that would allow #immigrants to self-realize, settle-in and engage in the pursuit of happiness.
By effectively sponsoring employees for the #REALcard and taking responsibility for their share of the tax, employers will be in compliance with the law and no longer be subject to fines or penalties.

The difficulty in taxing domestic and other cash economy workers is not new. The IRS has always wrestled with this issue in dealing with this almost 50% of the unauthorized workforce. But ITIG has found the solution https://t.co/RNt5b9EnKs
The #REALcard, a renewable, 10-year special work permit, represents a societal change where 5% contributions from unauthorized immigrants and 5% from their employers will fund many of the areas affected by unauthorized immigration: #Education &amp; #Healthcare.
In the event, a worker leaves a position, either by being fired or quitting, our #REALcard program allows them the freedom to switch employers or return to their country of origin. Learn more about the other REALcard benefits https://t.co/RNt5b9EnKs

Our current system has created serious backlogs in our #immigrationcourts, as they are flooded with applications from people throughout the world. ITIG’s approach allows for people fleeing dire circumstances to find a safe haven while they apply for #citizenship
The penalties in place for hiring unauthorized #immigrants are not currently well enforced because existing policies don’t adequately fund enforcement. ITIG has found a solution. A small tax on these immigrants and their employers in exchange for big benefits.
The advantages of our #REALcard are unprecedented and will inspire #immigrants and employers alike to pay the minimal tax of 5%.
Our work is ongoing and evolving. We’ve spoken with Washington staff and NGO’s on #immigrationissues and have revised our plan to incorporate and address many of their suggestions and concerns. Check out our third-way solution : https://t.co/RNt5b9EnKs
With our #REALcard bringing in an estimated $210 billion in 10 years $10 billion would be allocated for government services including: #homelandsecurity, IRS administration, securing the borders &amp; biometric identification.
Our REALcard is compassionate and will allow immigrants to apply for a visa and travel freely to and from their country of origin. #ImmigrationReform
By paying a very small tax of 5% in return for receiving a 10-year renewable #REALcard work permit unauthorized #immigrants &amp; the economy will receive real benefits. You’ll see more details on our Solution page https://t.co/RNt5b9VZ92
The third way is a solution between the two extremes of mass deportation &amp; mass #citizenship. Starting with a small payment from #immigrants &amp; their employers. https://t.co/RNt5b9VZ92
RT @arunNYC: Even 61% of Republicans support citizenship for Dreamers -- Durbin.	Hard to find an issue that unites Americans as much.
With the #REALcard Five + Five program, employers will enjoy an easy-pay system and no tax forms, and reap the benefits of a transparent, accountable #immigration system.
The origin of this nation’s largest source of continuing tax fraud is tax policies built into our Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) system, costing American taxpayers $6 billion in 2015. Our third-way model eliminates this problem. Find out more: https://t.co/RNt5b9EnKs
Immigration is not only about how we define ourselves but also how we build a vibrant future of promise and freedom. #Immigrants themselves will play a central role in that process. Contributing 5 cents of every dollar can put billions of dollars into systems in desperate need.
Here at ITIG we want #America to be a better place, a bigger-hearted place. A place that recognizes it is #stronger thanks to the contributions we all make through our labor and our lives.

There’s a third way between the two extremes on #immigration reform. Mass citizenship and mass deportation are not the only solutions.
With only 5% of their wages plus 5% matched by their employer, unauthorized #immigrants will be contributing billions in new revenue to overburdened local services such as #education and #healthcare
Our proposed 10-year #workpermit will remove fear from the lives of millions of unauthorized #immigrants.
Mass #citizenship and mass #deportation are too extreme. We have a third way toward #immigration reform.
Our #REALcard 10-year work permit allows immigrants to pursue happiness while contributing to society.
Our Five + Five plan is bridging the gap between the two extremes in the #immigration debate.
1.7 million #newjobs and $210 billion in a 10-year period would give relief to the overextended #immigration system and put funding back into public services in need.
#Education, #healthcare, homeland #security and the legal system are currently overwhelmed. Our #immigration reform proposal will help put finding back into these services.

America needs a simple solution to #immigrationreform, a third way between the two extremes of mass #citizenship and mass #deportation. https://t.co/RNt5b9VZ92
An immigrant who is paying taxes and earning the 10-year #REALcard work permit (staying on the right side of the law) will be able to freely travel to their home country and return. It’s an #immigration win-win for the U.S.
Monetize the 10-year REALcard work permit by having both worker and employer chip in a nickel for every dollar of #immigrant wages earned. That will generate $210 billion over 10 years.
Our 10-year REALcard work permit would enable currently unauthorized #immigrants to pay their fair share toward American taxpayers’ priorities.
Unauthorized #immigrants earn over $2 trillion every 10 years. A tiny piece of that income would fund many vital services in America.
Mass #citizenship isn’t the answer to America’s broken #immigration system. There is a third way: Have those responsible for the problem be part of the solution.

Republicanism can bend but not break, we will accept Immigration Reform and reform immigration taxes too!  Stay in the game save the party!
Reject Republican extremist who care little for the party are stopping Immigration Reform and keeping us from a bright future free of hate!
The future of the Repblican party will be written in the Immigration Reform bill, if we are on the right side we will be here a long time!
Immigration Reform will save the Republican party without it a long slow decline into insignificance save the party now reject the extremist
It is the time of decision for the Republican party, Immigration Reform will keep us in the game, don't listen to angry loosers, win Now!
Do you really care about the future of the Republican party?  If you did you would support Immigration Reform.  Save the future of the party
You may not like it but Immigration Reform is the deciding issue for the Republican party wake up understand that we will lose if we don't!
The Republican party is deciding it's fate in American history, not it's finest hour, now it depends  on Immigration Reform is it up or down
Ideas matter in the Immigration debate, but hate talk under your breath is not an idea when the future of the Republican party is at stake!
The future of the Republican party is being decide by Immigration Reform some Republican do not care about the future, a danger to the party
Republicans must choose between the Extreme Right and being right on Immigration Reform!  One way there is a a furture for the party or not!
A Republican future can only be assured through correct Immigration Reform, we have to be on the right side of history this time, no doubt!
Republican women have to let their feelings about Immigration Reform be known at the highest circles, it is a decisive issue for the party!
Republicans at the crossroads, it happens that crossroads is Immigration Reform, just one more bill yes, but this will be a tipping point

@PewHispanic In A Fiscal and Social Model for Immigration Reform, $10 Billion is made available by those who hire them, check out page 9.
@PewHispanic Costs of detaining and incarcerating undocumented immigrants is nearly impossible to calculate but $10 billion ought to help
Who should pay for immigrant services  health and education?  Well, after all, the employer is the one who benefits from their cheap labor
First step provide undocumented immigrants with medical, educational other needs in a way that no longer burdens American taxpayers SEE PLAN
We developed an enforceable methodology to provide over $100 billion to fund reform and needed services health care, education SEE THE PLAN!
We have a plan that will create 50,000 new jobs and provide $103 billion to reform immigration now, both parties can accept it SEE PLAN.
Within our report, A Fiscal and Social Model for Immigration Reform, we offer a turnkey model that can change the face of immigration!
Once we grandfather out immigrant taxes that do not work, we can contemplate the solution of having employers of undocumented Immigrants pay
25% of undocumented immigrants claimed little or no income taxes with almost no revenue collected from nearly 2 million immigrants SEE PLAN!
A compromise solution to legislative deadlock on Immigration Reform does exist.  Replace our inadequate immigrant tax system SEE THE PLAN!
We found that by carefully reforming some of our most ineffective immigrant tax codes, many immigration issues would just dissolve SEE PLAN!
75% of working undocumented immigrants 6.5 million already pay withholding taxes not eligible to collect but in 10-years give  $224 B to SS
Our Self-employment taxes are not in tune with SS/Medicare benefit i.e. immigrants work only 10 years they retire and we subsidize $217,000!
Immigrants use (ITIN) system to avoid paying over $4.4 billion annually by declaring excessive and most possibly fraudulent exemptions.
Congress made a grave error in the 1986 Amnesty that must be corrected allowing cash economy workers to file tax returns as Contractors!
Tax Identification Number system (ITIN), designed for individuals without SS#'s to pay taxes. Immigrants use system to avoid paying taxes!
25% of undocumented immigrants claimed little or no income taxes with almost no revenue collected from 2 mil, there is a plan to correct it!

@ITR We are moving the immigration discussion forward from why to how to pay for immigration reform #imigrationinquirygroup
ITIG believes that a token about of money from the 30 million Americans who hire them can heal much of what is wrong with immigration
This hard working group is underpaid and under-respected.  ITIG has a plan that calls on employers to help with the immigration dilemma
What’s missing in the immigration debate is how we can improve the lives of our immigrants.
Look though an ITIG plan to have undocumented immigrant employers support their children’s education—not as hard as it sounds!
What does Immigration Reform have to do with education? Possibly a $40 billion cash infusion into area most affected by immigrants
Change our tax codes to shift the cost of providing public services to undocumented immigrants from American taxpayers to their employers
If they live 18 years after retirement, they would have enjoyed Social Security and Medicare benefits of $250,000 over their contributions
Independent contractors are required to pay 15.3% of income.  This is the best investment in the world #Independent contractors
There are 2 million undocumented immigrants now, a better tax policy is obviously needed  #tax policy
An immigrant earning $25K all year by cleaning houses and saving $5,000 to pay taxes on April 15th is not a realistic expectation?
This guaranteed that thousands of working class immigrants were made tax felons by submitting fraudulent tax returns #tax felons
A tax loophole was created by the IRS post  1986 amnesty that allowed workers to file tax returns as independent contractors #1986amnesty
Line up and pay taxes” is a myth. Our 2 million cash economy undocumented immigrants are un-taxable
There are 6.5 million who pay taxes with false ID’s and 2 million who work in the cash economy.
To solve our immigration problem, several conversations need to take place.
@argoray
Independent contractors are required to pay 15.3% of income of whatever #income given. This is the best investment in the world.

Citizenship is highly over rated because it provides legal status without economic benefits except for retirement years.
What does this plan mean to the future of our country, its citizens, and its #immigrant population? http://t.co/F1csRIh1CH
If employers were assessed from 5%-10% of the immigrant labor costs, it could generate $103.125 billion in new revenue over a 10-year period

How will this program impact companies who hire undocumented workers?.. http://t.co/95HQfhL5rs
The 10-year plan we are proposing changes that &amp; was designed to bring respect and dignity to these #immigrants today.
The challenge then, is to examine our existing tax code &amp; make adjustments for the conditions which currently exist http://t.co/wwj4gY741K
Federal Government’s Department of Homeland Security indicates that there are currently an estimated 11.5 million undocumented #immigrants.
As of the publishing of this report, a bill-H.R. 1956 is working its way through Congress &amp; should mitigate problem if it becomes #law.
Combined with the #tax loophole, the total amount would be over twice the cost of the “sequester”.
Gross annual net benefits upon retirement in this situation are $24,329. Over an average 18 year retirement period.
A $2.2 trillion consequence of legalizing the existing 6.5 million falsely documented company employees who pay #taxes.

A ten-year Special Work #Permit #Immigration is an important element of the new immigration reform concept..http://t.co/c0WM2OOVj3
Issuance of #immigration work permit application is predicated on the sponsoring employer paying the stipulated tax on the employee income.
Immigrant’s employer pays the taxes; the worker becomes eligible for the ten years Special Work Permit, giving him/her family great freedom.
The revenue is earmarked to help fund Obama #immigration reform details as well as social service needs that improve society as a whole.
Employers were taxed from five to ten percent of the #immigrant labor costs, it could generate over $100 billion in new revenue.
Federal Government’s Department of Homeland Security indicates that there are currently an estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants.
By 2020 there may be as many as 20 million people living in countries other than their nation of origin, fleeing intolerant governments
$2.2 trillion consequence of legalizing the existing 6.5 million falsely #documented company employees who pay taxes #immigranttaxgroup.org
Using $22,500 as the average annual earnings of #undocumented employees, for our 6.5 million #employees that fall into this classification
Properly enforcing a 10% tax on the #employers of these #workers would generate approximately $30 billion over a 10-year period.
The Individual #Tax Identification Number system, ostensibly designed as a convenient way for someone who is #undocumented to pay taxes.
$500 billion tax loophole and the $2.2 trillion consequence related to the inappropriate taxes for #employees http://t.co/wwj4gY741K
A ten-year Special Work #Permit is an important element of the new #immigration reform concept. http://t.co/Kd5KddXSIK
Replace the fear of fines and penalties for hiring #undocumented immigrants with a fair and equitable method of tax collecting &amp; legal work
Shifting the burden of tax collecting from the #immigrant to the employer will generate over $100 billion in new revenues
The problem is not the immigrant who wants to better their life, it’s their exploitation and the subsequent social burden to taxpayers
