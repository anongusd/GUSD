I encourage @realDonaldTrump and the Administration to take a more responsible and realistic approach that brings us closer to our goals with North Korea and reflects the gravity of this issue.
.@realDonaldTrump must understand that these summits are more than just a photo op. We cannot present any leniency or pander to a country unwilling to commit to denuclearization.
Decommissioning North Korea’s short-range and long-range missiles should be at the forefront of any conversation between the U.S. and North Korea. While I am a firm believer in diplomacy, this meeting was inherently premature.
As a proud member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, I stand by this effort to safeguard Constitutional Congressional authority. Read more by clicking here: https://t.co/WiDbNXgRe5
Congress must reassert its vested powers and uphold its duty to check the power of the Executive and provide oversight when a sitting President attempts to circumvent the power of the purse via a national emergency declaration.
Proud to join the bipartisan effort, led by @RepTomReed/@RepJoshG, to claw back power from the Executive Branch. By amending the National Emergencies Act, Congress will have to approve emergency declarations within 60 days – similar to the War Powers Act. https://t.co/EYJzfGKVcw

The 15th District of Texas, which is located on the U.S.-Mexico Border, does not need a border wall to enhance safety. We needs smart, practical border security solutions. I call on my Senate colleagues, @JohnCornyn and @SenTedCruz to stand with us and reject the #FakeEmergency.
Trump’s #FakeEmergency makes America less safe by stealing billions from crucial military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness, and quality of life necessary to do their jobs effectively.

I urge my colleagues to join in this argument and utilize their powers of congressional oversight to call for an end to this practice.
I am calling on the administration to provide the American people with an explanation for this inhumane treatment of children. Neither the administration, nor agencies therein, can hide behind subcontractors.

Ahead of the 2018 elections, it is crucial that both Congress and the administration hold the Russian government accountable for meddling in the 2016 elections that destabilized the world order.
It would be my hope that @POTUS would display greater strength and resolve when side-by-side with a foreign leader who has actively threatened our national security and the integrity of our electoral process.
Congress and the administration must let this independent investigation continue, hold the Russian government accountable, and pass legislation that secures American elections from foreign interference.
Today’s indictment by the Special Counsel of 12 Russian military officers further demonstrates the Russian government’s intent to meddle in the 2016 elections.

Today, I sent a second letter to both @POTUS  and @FEMA_Brock requesting that federal disaster assistance be granted for Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and Coastal Bend. The time to act is now.
I encourage @DISH and @Univision to continue to negotiate and come to an agreement. The Hispanic community in South Texas, and across the country, rely on Univision for news, weather, and day-to-day information. Not having them on DISH would be unfortunate.
Members of Congress should be calling for more transparency, accountability, and exercising their congressional power of oversight. Watch the full interview with @MSNBC's @ChrisJansing here: https://t.co/dZ3QEL2Yww
On Wednesday, I spoke with @MSNBC ’s @ChrisJansing about the growing call to “abolish” the @ICEgov division of @DHSgov. This is emblematic of a complete lack of understanding of how our country’s immigration enforcement apparatus functions.
