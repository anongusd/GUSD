@caseykassidy @carpinsandiego @stillwaters1990 @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX You have a point, but, I still believe that, at the core, people want to hold onto the idea that hard work can make a difference. And taxes that increase exponentially with your income are the opposite of that. Instead of a reward for hard work, it‚Äôs a penalty.
@caseykassidy @carpinsandiego @stillwaters1990 @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX I actually would, yes. That, or a consumption tax.
@carpinsandiego @caseykassidy @stillwaters1990 @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX I‚Äôm not a fan of progressive taxes, in general, and especially one that takes over half, no matter what the ceiling. It‚Äôs a penalty for being successful, and it‚Äôs the opposite of what this country is supposed to be about.
@SenFeinstein So, apparently, a candidate for a judicial appointment who says she‚Äôs going to follow the law isn‚Äôt enough? She has to parrot the answer you want to hear, no matter what? Senator, I am continually surprised at your ridiculousness.
@carpinsandiego @caseykassidy @stillwaters1990 @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX To my knowledge, we have never taxed assets at the federal level, only income. The closest we have come to that is the estate tax, I believe.
@carpinsandiego @caseykassidy @stillwaters1990 @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Even though I know it will never affect me, it still bothers me. We are already double taxed so many other ways. It feels like a slippery slope.
@caseykassidy @stillwaters1990 @carpinsandiego @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX That‚Äôs one proposal I have heard, but Warren wants to tax wealth, i.e. assets, over a certain threshold. That‚Äôs double taxation. And the 70% marginal income tax, to me, has its own set of issues. Too many ways around it.
@caseykassidy @stillwaters1990 @carpinsandiego @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX So, what do we do? Start taxing assets? Seizing everything over a certain dollar amount? 	I wouldn‚Äôt be against taxing an increase in net worth year over year, but taxing the same assets every year doesn‚Äôt sound right to me.
@caseykassidy @stillwaters1990 @carpinsandiego @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Let‚Äôs go back to your previous statement. ‚Äú47% of people who collect assistance are employed.‚Äù	That means over half aren‚Äôt employed. Put those people to work. 	As for the Walmart issue, I have my own problems with that, part of which is that we, as consumers, help encourage it.
@stillwaters1990 @carpinsandiego @caseykassidy @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX I have nothing against helping people in need. What I have an issue with is helping people unwilling to help themselves. If we are going to give public money to people, then put them to work. Let them work on the infrastructure that we are hiring others for.
@carpinsandiego @caseykassidy @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Oh, understand economics just fine. But the cost of the safety net is growing because more people are using it, but as a way of life instead of a safety net. A ‚Äústep up‚Äù to get back on your feet stops being a step up when you don‚Äôt take the second step.
@carpinsandiego @caseykassidy @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX My point is that those social programs have helped to create a permanent underclass that keeps growing. By continuing to increase government welfare, we are exacerbating the problem instead of fixing it.
@caseykassidy @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Tax revenue has increased by more than 6x since 1980, and SS/Medicare/Medicaid consume over half of that. I‚Äôd say they are plenty funded.
@caseykassidy @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Those social welfare programs are the type of spending that the government can always ratchet up, but find almost impossible to ratchet down. They have done nothing but grow since their inception, taking bigger bites out of the budget. We need to tax less AND spend less.
@caseykassidy @melsos @podmahoney @KevinMKruse @DanCrenshawTX Yes, but, if you want to make a fair comparison, look at cost of living at that same time. 1950, median house cost - $7,534 ($44,600 in 2000 $‚Äôs). 2000, median house cost - $119,600. And other prices have risen comparably. It just costs more to live, these days.

@iusehttps @SenKamalaHarris I have no issues with the census. I do, however, believe that it should be allowed to ask if someone is a U.S. citizen. I don‚Äôt think that question is out of line. And, yes, I believe that representatives should be apportioned based on numbers of legal residents in each state.
@iusehttps @SenKamalaHarris I love the fact that you quoted a group that seeks to change the very thing that I am arguing against. They also said, ‚Äú... the apportionment of seats in Congress should be done on the basis of the number of citizens in each state.‚Äù	https://t.co/7jUTag6gTz
@iusehttps @SenKamalaHarris You‚Äôre missing my point. Population determines number of representatives. If you have a high concentration of non citizens, and they are counted in the census and assumed to be citizens, that could unfairly skew congressional allocation.
@iusehttps @SenKamalaHarris Citizens vote for Congress, and Congress helps determine policy. Non-citizens shouldn‚Äôt be able to influence policy decisions, which they would be if they were counted as citizens in the census.
@iusehttps @SenKamalaHarris ‚ÄúDe facto right to vote‚Äù, not actual right to vote. By being counted as a citizen in the census, they influence representation in Congress. Non-citizens shouldn‚Äôt be counted toward Congressional representation. By leaving that question off the census, they can‚Äôt differentiate.
@iusehttps @SenKamalaHarris ‚ÄúThe census ensures that each community gets the right number of representatives in government."	The census numbers determine representation in Congress. By not distinguishing between citizens/non-citizens, non-citizens get a de facto vote, which they aren‚Äôt entitled to.

@cameronkeys 	Please model that T-shirt for IDLYITW. We would all love it.
@katyperry Please put those on and come over and party with us for the 4th!
@cecestone I'm sure all the major leaguers will be wearing them soon.
@SummerBailey I dunno. Monopoly. Or maybe we could build a blanket fort.
@TaraLynnFoxx They call them "adios motherfucker" for a reason!
@andysandimas And we are all very thankful for that.
@LRJD hahaha. I read "mifi" as "milf" the first time through.
Damn right!  RT @Magalomania Even the hottest chick had someone who eventually refused to put up with their shit.
From the @TFLN iPhone app: (216): Does my surprise involve the use of a safe word?	(440): Probably.	(216): I
@thejessicadrake Amen to that.
@thejessicadrake Hello, I'm Mr. Vodka. Caramel Vodka. Nice to meecha.
Today, I realized that if "con" is the opposite of "pro", then "congress" is the opposite of "progress". Mind. Blown. MLIA.
Fuck Georgetown. 	Thanks Washington.
@Ashweez Well done. Next time we will work on colors!
@Vukizzle Maybe those two guys are into each other instead.

This is awesome!!!!!!  http://www.stupidvideos.com/video/just_plain_stupid/DUI/#1002
@AvaAddams come on by. I'll work out with you.
@JennaPics4U Work from the hot tub.
@Ashweez D may be giving them a little too much credit.
Shocking.  RT @LizzXXXTayler And a bunch of Daiquiri's later....I'm pretty drunk!
@AvaAddams Houston is warm right now! Rainy, though.
Must be nice  RT @NathanFillion This is someone's backyard. For reals.  http://yfrog.com/3lpe6yj
Awesome  RT @ebertchicago http://twitpic.com/yvuqd - It would cheer me up immensely to learn this isn't a Photoshop gag.
@its_kristi The pics are amazing. And so is the butthole. :)
24 starts tonight!!!!!
@Ashweez Try that old movie Ice Pirates with Robert Urich. Cheesy as hell, but hilarious.
@AmyDeWitt Purple? Really? Are you channeling Barney?
@meowmistidawn Not till tomorrow.
Is Shannon Sharp seriously wearing VELVET???
@Ashweez Let me guess. All you pay is shipping and a "minimal" deposit.
"Bring The Wood!"
http://twitpic.com/yel9n - Go Saints! Kick that ass!
@sophiedee That dog looks PISSED.
@PlaymateValerie Lucky? Really? I guess that all the work you did to get there was incidental? :)
@AmyDeWitt don't take the red out. You can claim that your little devil was peeking out.
@crissyhilton Fathers tend to accommodate daughters more. This is coming from a guy with two daughters.
@crissyhilton Yes.  There are more chances for conflict with women in similar circumstances and common interests.
@misscrash I love your Zippo too.
RT @TiffanySelby RT @RevRunWisdom: If u get cheated twice by the same dude,, you assisted him the 2nd time.. real talk
@AmyDeWitt You know that you secretly hope they do!
The house is quiet. Too quiet. Bad things must be about to happen.
@AmyDeWitt You should take a hint. The cosmos wants you nude.
@lindsex Not boo. Trust me.
Awesome cashier.
RT @creepycupid Guys, never use the term 'yay!' when you text her.  You want to get laid?  Do you?  Don't ever 'yay'.
Agreed.  RT @AdrianneCurry This would only b better if Olivia's boobs were on mine http://bit.ly/8jwv5g
Dog came back this morning. Wife is happy. Me, not so much.
Agreed! RT @drunkstepfather Stacey's mom is one of the best love songs of our time...
@Ashweez Minature pinscer. The little shit hovers by the front door and tries to get out. He finally succeeded. Dammit.
Dog ran out the front door. I chased him but I lost him. I got outsmarted by an oversized rat. The wife is not happy.
@Ashlynn_Brooke How about a hot lesbian movie about dolls that come to life in a psych ward and get it on with patients?
Hooray for vagazzle!! RT @CelebNewsWire Jennifer Love Hewitt bedazzles her vagine. http://kl.am/vagazzle
Kids need to have both a snooze button and mute button. Too fucking early.
Throwin bones!
@AdrianneCurry Leia, of course! Any boy who grew up on Star Wars would say the same.
Fuck Bama.
The Horns better pull some shit out in the second half.
Greg Davis is a fucking chickenshit. Let gilbert run the standard offense. Otherwise just forfeit. Asshole.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Oh shit. McCoy is hurt.
Hell yeah!!!!  RT @clubalektrablue Hook'em motherfkn horns!!!!!!
Musburger irritates the shit out of me. He says dumb shit all the time and he sounds like he's talking from inside a bong.
From the @TFLN iPhone app: (818): I just blindly shoved it in. I'm still not sure which hole I got.
That's what she said!
Now I remember why I don't watch awards shows. How did "The Proposal" beat "The Hangover" for Favorite Comedy??? Fucking lame.
@AdrianneCurry twice a week. Doesn't happen, but I can try!
@undeux The spray tan looks awesome. Stop fishing for compliments! :)
@Kirsten_Price Robin Thicke???? Really?!!!
I like my new pillow, though. Better than the rock-hard piece of shit I had before.
Can't sleep. Thinking about pickle juice. I drink it straight, or mixed with vodka, or in Bloody Marys, or in beer. Yum. Don't judge.
@AdrianneCurry Women get bigger boobs at "that time" because God loves to tease men with something they can't have.
How bout them #Cowboys!!!!!!!!

#in2010 I'm getting my shit together and getting back to pre-marriage shape.  Nine years of sitting on my ass have taken their toll.
I hate the effing #RedRaiders.
Those Texas Tech receivers are freakishly fast.

#TrueBlood is awesome!  Just finished the first season on DVD and can't wait for Season 2.

@xoxoxalex now who so you really expect to say "no"?????
I guess a field goal is better than losing yardage on that fucking inside run again.
What the fuck?????	The Cowboys have been stopped on that inside run almost every time they run it!! why run it again?!
Barber TD, yeah!!!!!
Go Cowboys!  I hate the freakin Redskins.
@Darenzia spectacular!
Presents opened. Lunch eaten. Let the napping commence!
Santa has come. My work here is done. Now for Star Wars.
Pneumonia. Bad things.
The youngest is on his way to urgent care. Fever and cough, along with wheezing, equals worry.
Nine years of marriage today.  Win or fail?
I found out that the reason I was sick to my stomach the other day. I ate a piece of fudge made by our floor's resident non-hand-washer.
@AdrianneCurry :  I mysterygoogled your WOW question.  Let's see if it works.
Ugh. I want to rip my stomach out and replace it with something that doesn't feel like shit.
Fuck Mondays. I need sleep.
Why, oh why, do my Cowboys suck so bad?
Okay. I confess. The Suicide Girls are hot.
Fuck the Heisman. It's a political award. All of the awards that reflect actual ability went to McCoy.
Tiger taking a leave of absence?  Can't happen.  He needs to keep up the income for the legal fees alone.
