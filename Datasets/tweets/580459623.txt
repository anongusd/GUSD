I miss hanging out with my school friends

@paganmo0n when someone asks you that just say no and see their reaction.
it's just starting to sink in that I'm done with high school
@paganmo0n Is it bad that I'm seriously thinking of coming into school early to beat it?
@paganmo0n It seriously is, I am not lying.
http://t.co/xocwlvYr

@paganmo0n I have one of the portable mouses that you plug into a laptop. I have proof.
@paganmo0n I just got 90!
@paganmo0n I'm so mad at you for breaking the school record today.
@paganmo0n I will tell him that he disappointed me by saying he thought the concert was "good except for the middle school choir"
@rcoleman_ @paganmo0n Doesn't anyone in the audience realize that the rain song was an elementary kid thing?

Choir Concert today, cover your ears
Nice surprise visit from Rachel and Pagan tonight #funmemories
