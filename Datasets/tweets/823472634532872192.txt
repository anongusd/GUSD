@Jimmy_castor @JaysOnAHill @JavyRuiz_2 @News4SA @JeffGSpursZone True but you can have two mentors ok.  And remember Pau in his prime, he had such a sweet passing game that Duncan never had. Poeltl could definitely benefit from that.  So I don't get your comment, are you implying Pau has nothing to offer in practice because Duncan is there?
@JaysOnAHill @JavyRuiz_2 @News4SA @JeffGSpursZone Probably a good mentor for Poeltl too but still that doesn't justify the money

@spurs @aldridge_12 @DeMar_DeRozan @RudyGay @BrynjForbes @marcobelinelli @Patty_Mills I'll be honest, I didn't think they were going to win when the game went into overtime on the road. Against LeBron. Especially not when the Lakers took a 4 point lead. What a gutsy win.
@Adam_Meiklejohn @TheSteinLine Heh he was close to a triple double tonight
@SASpurs5 Oh man I can't believe LeBron missed those FT's

@StandWithAZ @johncardillo Just what the US needs, more men of military age who have no money or skills or any reason to abide by the law.
@mySA Sounds perfect
@joshgrothues @mloading3_ @JMcDonald_SAEN Well we'll know for sure what the front office wants to do if they tank this year. Spurs fans won't accept multiple losing seasons, that's for sure! I don't think they'll do that!
@joshgrothues @mloading3_ @JMcDonald_SAEN "if we're not building towards a championship it's all pointless." Most teams are just building to be profitable, especially small market teams like San Antonio. That's the best we can hope for otherwise the owners will sell to somebody who wants to move the team to Seattle.
@joshgrothues @mloading3_ @JMcDonald_SAEN Josh don't forget about the draft picks we got. That is a lot to build with. Even if we have to trade Poeltl in a couple years we'll still get something out of him too.
@SkywardShield @DoubleAVI Excellent take. I am sure Poeltl will be good for us long-term (LA, Gasol and Tim, maybe even @DavidtheAdmiral can teach him) but I was always saying the first round picks we got are GOLD. RC Buford will get a winner for us.
@DoubleAVI I definitely want to see more from Jakob Poeltl but remember he's 23 and full centers don't peak until they're 30. I think he'll come good for us. He's a keeper I'm sure of it.
@JMcDonald_SAEN Kawhi is a really good player but it's a little embarrassing to still be talking about him. Spurs fans can be so cringey some times. Look not every guy we sign is going to be a saint. We got spoiled.
@xcharomii @JMcDonald_SAEN He's just so French.
@SpursFan1313 @JMcDonald_SAEN Maybe but @seanelliott_32 was killer from 3-point land (remember the Memorial Day Miracle against the Blazers?) and had outstanding defense too. Maybe not the pure scorer @DeMar_DeRozan is. Both excellent players.
@ThaNowhereMan @JMcDonald_SAEN Should bring him back for an HEB commercial, he was dynamite with Sean @seanelliott_32 and @DavidtheAdmiral
@ThaNowhereMan @JMcDonald_SAEN Good call.

@chris_hagy @DeeGreatest11 @taniaganguli @PaulGarciaNBA @ramonashelburne He's 33. He probably wants to do what Karl Malone did with the Lakers -- join a ready-made team where the pressure is off him. Not carry a team.
@Farnsworthdill @ladyxyx @AthleteTweetsO @FSDSports I trust RC Buford to do serious damage in the draft with all the draft picks the Lakers seem poised to give us. We might have a sub-30 win season or two though.
@theupxyde @News4SA If we can get rid of an expensive contract (Gasol) and pick up some 1st and 2nd round draft picks from the Lakers I'd say that's very sensible.

@NewYorker "This emphasis on community, especially in the misguided nod to 9/11, suggests an ulterior motive." Do you realize how deranged you sound?
@SlashLurk Yeah they work pretty well and are really easy to set up. A lot easier than running CAT 5 cable through the walls.
@KENS5 Needs a remodel.
@KENS5 Wow this mugshot makes me want to vomit.
@AmySotoxxx @ksatnews @nigel_rojo I don't understand how this has anything to do with "snowflakes". Can you rephrase your tweet in a way that makes sense?
@ksatnews It's a harmless joke. Just make the kid turn the shirt inside out and move on. If only "educators" took academics as seriously as the content of their students' t-shirts.
@KENS5 Another good reason not to do business with BofA.
@ksatnews I'm not sure it's fair to call these actions aggressive. Steel and aluminum are the two most important metals industries for almost any nation, and protecting those industries through tariffs could well be called defensive.
@ksatnews Get it while you can, the playoffs won't last long this year.

@ksatnews I grew up just outside of Leon Valley's city limits, and I just do not understand why there is a need for this place to exist and not be San Antonio.
@dodo People who do stuff like this deserve bludgeoning.
@DailyMailUK Pretty obvious who is to blame for causing Western society to have to be this way. Not the police's fault.

@WalshFreedom @SarahHuckabee Your hardline devotion to law enforcement has blinded you. The FBI is not infallible. There are serious questions that need to be answered for the American people!
@WalshFreedom Meeting with somebody isn't traitorous at all. Americans have the right to assemble with anyone freely.  You throw that word, traitor, around so cheaply, I lose respect for you. Get off your high horse! You just lost a follower.
@RealJamesWoods Trump Derangement Syndrome is real!
@WalshFreedom Joe,  you forget that questioning authority is a worthy endeavor. The FBI is not infallible, and they should be questioned. There may indeed be a situation where the government is the enemy of the people! It's not wrong to ask that question!

@ksatnews I'd also like to point out how easy it is to get 80% lowers. There is no background check required and they can be ordered over the internet in quantity. I have never done so myself but as reporters you should be aware of how this works without taking my word for it.
@ksatnews Based on what I know machining 80% lowers in to fully functional AR lower receivers is not hard to do for a craftsman but requires that you get it a serial number for compliance with federal law. This old man was abusing the law and his expertise to make a quick buck w/o question
@ksatnews I would like more technical details on this. Sounds like this guy was taking what are called 80% lowers and them finishing them into full lower receivers, which is the part that bears the SN#. Technically easy to do but highly illegal.
@AggieFootball As a Longhorn, I have to say it is special to see this at Kyle Field under any circumstances, and it would be more special to see this during a game! But even most special if it was Longhorns vs Aggies! Could you imagine?
@_wintergirl93 We know what it is. It's rare here. The Hill Country and High Plains see it every other year but in the lower elevations it's a special moment. Some might say God is smiling upon us.
@NISD This is absolutely outrageous. The roads are far too warm and covered in oil and dirt to ice over or see an accumulation of snow or ice, and the temperatures will quickly rise above freezing when the sun comes up even if there is light icing. Just wake up 30 minutes earlier.
