However I wish she had the guts to look me in the eyes &amp;tell me her plan all along was to bring more guns onto a school campus. Her plan was to arm teachers, not with school supplies, but with guns. @BetsyDeVosED, is this what you really find appropriate in a school surrounding?
Of course, I was left disappointed. Her vague answer left me in the dark. She ensured me that she would do everything in her role to bring solutions for what is appropriate in a school surrounding.
I asked her what her personal agenda was to prevent another shooting on a school campus. I told her about the pain &amp; heartbreak of what it‚Äôs like to lose classmates to preventable gun violence. I needed to know that the Secretary of Education had a step by step plan of action.

@KyleKashuv @PollackHunter Either way, MFOL doesn‚Äôt endorse candidates. from day one, they‚Äôve preached this. but I guess since you bash them so much, you never took the time to listen.
@KyleKashuv @PollackHunter no surprise you‚Äôre putting words in my mouth Kyle once again. I‚Äôm well aware of my circumstance after losing my own friends  and have used my platform for what I consider can prevent another shooting, as you have too. And a blue check mark isn‚Äôt fame. yours isn‚Äôt either.
@PollackHunter I received a platform after I spoke for what I felt was right when I lost my own friends and classmates. And while incompetency is an issue, we can also use our platform to speak out for those who weren‚Äôt offered a platform and are effected by gun violence everyday.
@PollackHunter From recent and continuous bashing on their organization on your part, it‚Äôs been very unclear whether you‚Äôve been asking for the organization to endorse. on top of that, no one owes anyone anything.

The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas have been betrayed, by the ones who were supposed to keep us safe. We deserve an education in America where we don‚Äôt have to fear if we will be killed in a desk. We just want to be safe. is that too much to ask for?
I think people sometimes forget we are between the ages of 14-18. We are navigating through the hard truths. we are navigating through the aftermath of gun violence. A massacre. there‚Äôs students with PTSD. And this whole process has been so FRUSTRATING.
Every day is so heartbreaking. it‚Äôs exhausting, it‚Äôs a pain like no other. Stoneman Douglas students have to face the reality of who failed us on Valentine‚Äôs Day. We embrace ourselves for the heart break we endure when the public records come out to the media. This was our Home.
this interview of Scot Peterson is disgraceful. And no, Peterson, we aren‚Äôt ‚Äúyour kids‚Äù. You sat in your office everyday for the past four years I‚Äôve been at douglas.

I find this so important to talk about. The promise program, that the school board has put into place, to receive federal money, is why Cruz passed a background check for a gun. The school board has blood on their hands. (END THREAD))
And in particular, for Stoneman Douglas, being a top ranked school, they never wanted to expel Nikolas Cruz, because they worried it would affect our ranking.
The district created the promise program. Allowing individuals in school to have a clean background, even if they have done a wrong doing. Which, will allow the district to have low crime rates within schools, so they can receive more federal money.
