Why do we have a Congress?
1. It'll likely get tied up in the courts; 		2. They didn’t like it when Obama did everything through Executive fiat;		3. They'll not like it when a future Democratic president declares a climate emergency to seize airplanes and farting cows. 		This is bad policy and bad process.
Conservatives celebrating the emergency declaration should pause and consider the following:
This vote also sets the stage for an emergency declaration that will further undermine Congress’s much-diminished capacity for legislating.
And obviously the bill does not solve the border security problem, it merely punts this problem to the 2020 election, meaning the problem will only get worse.
The appropriators released a 1100+ page omnibus bill after midnight today. 		We suspended (i.e. violated) the rules to vote on it less than 24 hours later with no real deliberation or debate.
Why do we have a Congress?		Presumably we have a Congress to deliberate, debate, and legislate. When it comes to border security, Congress has done none of these things.
A top-down approach to policy problems does not work.		We shouldn’t be surprised when this process results in a last second vote on legislation that we have little to no time at all to evaluate. https://t.co/LPRVxpAZqU
Later tonight we’ll be voting on a 1,159 page bill that we had less than 24 hours to read. This is bad process. And as we’ve learned the hard way, bad process leads to bad policy.		Congress must do better. https://t.co/VH8Nw9IFvQ

Lesson #3 is simple: Problems don’t age well. 		That’s true in life and particularly true in politics. We can’t punt the problem of border security to the next generation. So let’s work together over these next two weeks with a sense of urgency to fix it.
Until we change the way Congress operates, we’ll be right back where we started: satisfying the literal definition of insanity by doing the same things and expecting different results. 		At a minimum, we should demand that Congress avoid insanity. https://t.co/pKAicWQgDS
It's no surprise when this process results in a hurried vote on a bill that we had no opportunity to amend. 		We should instead work from the ground up, starting with the relevant committees &amp; ordinary members. This will increase the likelihood of achieving long-lasting policies.
Lesson #2: A top-down approach to policy problems does not work.		It seems we routinely let the President and the most powerful members of Congress negotiate in secret, while the rest of us wait for white smoke to emerge from the White House chimney.
In other words, the debate over border security is the best kind of debate to have. It’s not about irreconcilable, abstract principles. It’s about specific requirements that we can measure in terms of geography, human resources and cost.
Perhaps Democrats disagree with this proposal. But assuming everyone agrees on the long-term goal of gaining 100 percent operational control of the border, then the only question is: how do we do it more effectively? What is the right mix of barriers, technology and people?
Lesson #1: There's massive miscommunication on border security that must be cleared up.

Rather, the administration wants a comprehensive package that provides for: https://t.co/JmVQMmYJ6y

US security increasingly depends upon command of the seas. It is not a birthright and is being challenged by China and Russia every day. This is not a 30-year out problem. This is a here and now problem. The Navy the nation needs is the biggest one it can possibly build—now.

We need a long-term strategy in Syria that advances our interests and protects our allies. Virtual presence will translate into actual absence. I'm afraid we will soon regret a hasty retreat.
Long-term, I’m concerned about the growing Russian military presence in Syria. If we are not careful, Russia could grow its new naval and air bases to threaten our access in the eastern Mediterranean, and perhaps even Suez.
The administration is right to want to roll back Iranian influence in the region, but we can’t do that if we aren’t engaged on the ground in support of our allies. Handing Syria to the Assad/Putin/Iranian axis is no way to bring stability to Syria, or to the region.
President Obama found out the hard way that withdrawing unilaterally from Middle East hotspots tends to leave power vacuums that are filled by actors that do not share our interests. In the case of our exit from Iraq, we only ended up emboldening Iran.
"What a country, where someone of an unassuming Midwest upbringing gets a chance to be part of all of this...You can pursue whatever your passion is, wherever it takes you.

We’ll see what happens in 60 days. But for now, all Americans should take heart that we are holding Russia accountable for its actions and paving the way for a more secure future in the Indo-Pacific, all while working closely with our allies.
Just as importantly, our @NATO allies have released a unanimous statement concurring with the administration’s assessment of Russia’s material breach. So let’s be clear: this is not a unilateral step away from arms control. This is a consensus finding coordinated with our allies.
Today, @SecPompeo delivered an unequivocal finding that Russia’s actions constitute a material breach of INF. If Russia fails to verifiably return to its obligations under the agreement, in 60 days, the US will suspend its compliance with the treaty.
Recognizing these realities, my amendment to the FY19 NDAA gave @POTUS until January to make a final determination of whether Russia is in material breach of its INF obligations. In the event of a positive material breach determination, the amendment set a path to exit the treaty
Meanwhile, China has never been part of the treaty and has amassed an arsenal over 2,000 ballistic and cruise missiles—about 95% of which fall under INF ranges. These missiles are far cheaper than our ships and planes, meaning we are increasingly priced out of the competition.
Although we did not realize it at the time, we know from former Obama administration officials that Russia began testing INF-prohibited ground-launched cruise missiles in 2008. Every year since 2014, the @StateDept has found Russia to be in violation of its INF obligations.
.@SecPompeo deserves enormous credit for today’s announcement. Not only are we moving forward on INF in a way that makes clear Russia is the party acting in bad faith, but we are doing so in close coordination with our @NATO allies. A quick recap:

This may negatively impact bottom lines, but the government &amp; private sector must get on the same page. Throughout our history, American industry has been central to the security of our nation--and our prosperity has depended on our security. It is time we recapture that spirit.
I'd argue that moving forward, an important part of corporate social responsibility should be evaluating how business partnerships with authoritarian nations could contribute to oppression abroad or put American lives at risk.
Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of corporate social responsibility policies. In light of how countries like the PRC are using technological innovation for highly unethical purposes, it is time to rethink what corporate social responsibility includes.
Another example: the @WSJ just published an important story about @nvidia's highly questionable partners in the PRC, including some involved in the mass oppression in Xinjiang. https://t.co/klG2WaHS9n
Take @Google. Even more than developing a censored search engine, I'm concerned about its AI research center in China. At best, the CCP will use AI to expand its control over the lives of its citizens. At worst, it may one day be used in combat against US forces or our allies.
What General Dunford laid out in Halifax over the weekend about Google working with China but not the Pentagon gets at a broader problem for Silicon Valley: the ethics of expanding the technological capabilities of authoritarian regimes. https://t.co/k6ekBXfbhO
Agree with my friend @TomTugendhat. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has habitually abused international law enforcement to advance its political objectives. It must not be entrusted with Interpol. https://t.co/o8y5oKS7qD

As we begin a new Congress, I hope we can avoid this trap and approach debates with open minds, focusing not on partisan bickering but rather on getting stuff done for the American people.
It's no surprise that as the volume of negative ads increases, our political environment becomes more toxic. It can be easy to respond in kind when you're faced with negativity. But this only exacerbates the hostility and vitriol in our politics.
And over $3 billion was spent on TV/radio ads, setting the record for a midterm election. Too many of these wasteful ads served only to drag down public discourse and diverted attention from finding solutions to real problems. https://t.co/9OSWDCz5nh
Over the last few months, I’ve heard from many people across Northeast Wisconsin who are concerned by the volume of negative ads they saw this election cycle—as they should be. The number of negative ads aired in 2018 went up an alarming 61% from 2014. https://t.co/LnhgkfqnMy

Whatever the answers, what is clear is that demands on the Navy are only set to grow in the future. Let's not let perfect be the enemy of good. Let's get building. The Navy the nation needs is the biggest one it can possibly build—now.
What's the Navy been up to in the six months since we first heard about a new assessment in March? And why will the new assessment not be ready until more than a year after the new defense strategy?
The problem is the way in which this is happening. In March, the Navy told us that they were planning on conducting a new force structure assessment. Then, the Navy re-announced a forthcoming new assessment just last month, due “some time” in 2019.
Back in December 2016, the Navy released a force structure assessment that called for a 355-ship fleet. Given the change in administration and defense strategy since then, it makes sense that the Navy wants to review the size and composition of its future fleet.
Thanks @JerryHendrixII.

It takes a closer look to see how what we do in Northeast Wisconsin matters in a broader national context, but it matters a great deal. From our schools, to our businesses, to our workers, #WI08 plays an indispensable role in keeping the country safe.
But ultimately, this issue reaches beyond the 8th District. A skilled and robust work force in Northeast Wisconsin is critical to our military strength and defense industrial base.
The success of our local businesses and economy hinges on training the next generation of skilled workers to fill this shortage. And we’re lucky to have outstanding tech schools like @NWTC and @FoxValleyTech leading the way.
Like so many other manufacturers and business owners tell me, the skilled worker shortage in Northeast Wisconsin is limiting the company’s ability to grow and has led to a serious backlog of work orders.

Today’s conversation is just one of many that I will be having with the administration, and my colleagues in Congress, to help prevent Northeast Wisconsin from getting caught in the crossfire of any trade disputes.
The health of our economy in #WI08 depends on local farmers and manufacturers being able to sell their goods abroad and on a level-playing field. This is why we should be working with our allies to open markets and get tough on countries like China who cheat the system.
I also urged Ambassador Lighthizer to continue pushing Canada to get rid of its unfair trade barriers on our dairy products.
During our meeting, I urged the administration to re-consider any policy changes that risk forcing great Wisconsin companies, like @harleydavidson, to produce less in our state and more overseas.

I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop the finger pointing and grandstanding, and get to work.
Until the House and Senate pass legislation that fulfills all three duties and protects families, Congress should stay in session. And yes, that means cancelling the August recess if necessary.
Congress has a constitutional duty to legislate and fix ambiguities in the law, secure our borders, and protect those with legitimate asylum claims in the land of the free.
These sweeping policy changes that occur with each new administration are the result of Congress, over the course of decades, ceding too much of its lawmaking power to the executive branch.
In just ten years, we have swung from one end of the pendulum to the other; from catch-and-release to needlessly separating children from their parents at the border.

A year ago this month Otto Warmbier died. He was killed by the Kim regime. I’m not naïve. I recognize that sometimes we have to talk to unsavory people, but future negotiations should minimize pageantry &amp; maximize focus on KJU’s abysmal human rights record.https://t.co/bXl4PDi3tf
Man I hope I’m wrong. I want @POTUS to succeed. Toward that end I’ll be pushing Congress to 1) play an active role in the negotiations; 2) reject any deal that doesn’t achieve CVID; and 3) ensure US forces in SK continue to be an enduring force for peace and stability in NE Asia.
5) Of course media and many politicos are drowning in hypocrisy if you compare their past positions on Iran and Cuba. But to be intellectually honest, those of us critical of the Iran deal must also apply the same standards to these negotiations.
4) A year ago this month Otto Warmbier died. He was killed by the Kim regime. I’m not naïve. I recognize that sometimes we have to talk to some unsavory people, but any future negotiations should minimize pageantry and maximize focus on KJU’s abysmal human rights record.
3) Our presence on the Korean Peninsula is non-negotiable and should not be a part of denuclearization. KJU must be made to understand his regime’s survival depends on dismantlement. It’s not easy but it is simple.
2) While the suspension of our military exercises is easily reversible, we shouldn’t be stopping any joint exercises with our allies. These exercises are important to countering China’s regional aggression, in addition to Kim Jong-un's hostility.
In fact, a few things seem obvious causes for greater skepticism:	 	1) Any drawn-out process plays to North Korea's and China’s advantage, as it saps energy from the maximum pressure campaign and allows Kim to create pressure for peace at any price.
But unless the subsequent Pompeo-led negotiations compel the Kim regime to make new &amp; concrete concessions, count me a skeptic when it comes to whether yesterday’s agreement advanced the ball down the field toward CVID in any meaningful way.
We all want to see the North Korean crisis resolved diplomatically and the administration deserves enormous credit for the maximum pressure campaign. In the last 16 months alone, @POTUS has designated more North Korean entities for sanctions than in the previous 8 years.

This short-lived agreement between the previous administration and Iran’s Supreme Leader should serve as a reminder that, in order to stand the test of time and out of respect for the Constitution, comprehensive arms treaties should be submitted to Congress for ratification.
Now we must work to apply max. pressure on Iran until it agrees to irreversibly dismantle its illicit nuclear infrastructure, disclose the extent of its program to IAEA and allow for inspections, and stop its development of ballistic missiles and destabilizing regional activity.
It offered permanent concessions for temporary restrictions, ignored the possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program, and undermined the Nonproliferation Treaty and six UN Security Council Resolutions.

Maybe the best place to start is by setting an example for younger generations. Through both limiting our screen time and thinking twice before we hit send on that comment we wouldn’t want our parents to see, we can all play a more positive role.
I understand the irony of saying all this on Twitter (and candidly, this is something I struggle with). While I value the role that social media plays in helping me hear from and connect with #WI08, I also know it can help drive the ugly and divisive discourse we see too often.
This report reminds us that now more than ever, we need to set down our phones and computers, and have more meaningful conversations with our friends, family and community.
In the digital age, we’ve seen historic growth in connectivity. So why then are people—especially younger generations—feeling so alone? This report begs the increasingly important question of the role played by social media and the internet in our nation’s mental health crisis.

What does the new tax code mean for working families? As @SpeakerRyan put it in his new op-ed: "...more money and less hassle." https://t.co/hlpucgnpXf
Most importantly, the new tax code allows families to make choices on how they spend their money, rather than laundering their money through special interests in Washington, D.C. After all, D.C. is the last thing people need more of in their lives.
Today marks the LAST day you will have to file your taxes under our old, outdated tax code.

We need to adjust course instead of potentially decimating local industry in Northeast Wisconsin, like our beer producers and dairy farmers who could effectively be unable to sell their products abroad.
Rather than punishing the Chinese like they were intended to do, I’m afraid these catch-all tariffs will hurt hardworking Wisconsin families and businesses.
These tariffs will also have downstream impacts on other Wisconsin goods—from our manufacturers, all the way to beer cans. Early estimates show the tariffs will cost the beer industry over $300 million... a cost that will be passed on to the American consumer.
As history has shown—as recently as 2002—this type of indelicate protectionism rarely, if ever, works. Already we have seen the EU threaten reciprocal tariffs on Wisconsin goods, such as dairy and cranberries.
I have serious concerns with the administration’s overly broad tariffs on steel and aluminum, which is why over 100 of my House colleagues and I urged the President to reconsider this decision.

We cannot afford to lose #GLRI’s help in the fight for clean water. Green Bay and Lake Michigan are some of #WI08’s most treasured assets, and I’ll continue to fight on their behalf until the necessary funding is secured. Future generations depend on it. https://t.co/nzrUB78NGi

Community Health Centers provide healthcare for over 24,000 people in #WI08. Last night in the House I voted for—and the House passed—legislation that protects funding for our Community Health Centers, and I hope that my colleagues in the Senate do the same. https://t.co/A9vdEyX9Wl

Today, we heard Sec. Mattis' starkest warning yet about the dangers of failing to fund our military. After the House once again passed full-year defense spending, it is up to my colleagues in the Senate to act decisively to give our troops the resources they need.
Sec. Mattis ends with a stark warning to @HASCRepublicans: "Congress must take action now... I ask that you not let disagreements on domestic policy continue to hold our Nation’s defense hostage."
As we debate government funding this week, I hope my colleagues keep in mind Secretary Mattis' warning to @HASCRepublicans: "We all know America can afford survival."
More Sec. Mattis @HASCRepublicans: "Congress mandated this National Defense Strategy—the first one in a decade—then shut down the government the day of its release."
Sec. Mattis @HASCRepublicans hearing: servicemembers "are putting themselves in harm’s way, in effect signing a blank check payable to the American people with their lives. They do so despite Congress’ abrogation of its Constitutional responsibility to provide stable funding."

My latest thoughts on the shutdown: https://t.co/NgNEHSxXUG
If other federal employees—if our troops—aren’t getting paid, then neither should Congress which is why I’m sponsoring the Pay Our Protectors, Not Our Politicians Act. During the shutdown I’ll be donating the pay I receive to charity, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.
By doing so, Senate Democrats have put children, families, and veterans at risk of losing access to vital programs they depend on for their livelihoods. This failure is unacceptable and we cannot continue this constant cycle of careening from one budgetary crisis to the next.
I’m disappointed by Senate Democrats’ reckless decision to do the opposite and hold all our nation’s priorities hostage to DACA—an important issue, but one that should be negotiated separately.
Two days ago in the House, we did our part to keep the U.S. government open, and work toward an agreement that will get us out from under budgetary dysfunction.
Your #GhostFleet article of the week is from the remarkable new National Defense Strategy, which finds, "Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security." https://t.co/JGyy1tdwFL
Last night we voted to fund the gov't for just 28 days. Whether or not the Senate votes to shut it down, it's irresponsible for Congress to go home for 9 of them. We should stay here and get our work done for the American people.		Lock us in the Capitol until we do.
Could not agree more @SpeakerRyan.

3/3: The lesson of 1941 is that we can never allow our adversaries to believe the potential gains from aggression are worth the inevitable cost. The world looks to the U.S. to defend the peace for which so many fought and died. Let's honor their sacrifice through our actions.
2/3: Instead, aggression was met by the courage and steadfast determination of the American people. We won, but at great cost, including those who perished 76 years ago today.
1/3: On December 7th, 1941, the United States was caught off guard by a sudden and far-reaching campaign of aggression in the Asia-Pacific. Our enemy calculated that a swift blow and public pressure would cause us to quickly sue for peace.

@POTUS 7/7: We need to give the North Korean people that most dangerous of weapons—hope. The Kim regime cannot last forever. We must empower and give strength to those courageous enough to push for change.
@POTUS 6/7: The Kim regime is built on a series of lies about the outside world, and no lie is strong enough to last forever. Until the Kim regime one day falls, America will be on the side of the North Korean people, and not their corrupt and abusive leaders.
@POTUS 5/7: We seek not to impose our way of life on North Korea, but rather, to see all Koreans be able to one day express themselves in an open society of their own choosing, with leaders accountable to the population.
@POTUS 4/7: The President should use his platform to make clear that the American people do not desire war with North Korea. What we desire is that all the Korean people live free, prosperous, and peaceful lives. The US is not alone: many in South Korea and Japan agree!
@POTUS 3/7: @POTUS could turn a source of frequent criticism into a catalyst for change in North Korea that would benefit the US &amp; our allies. His message would assuredly reach into North Korea, just as all revolutionary ideas throughout history have not been confined by borders.
@POTUS 2/7: I know, few people think the White House should spend more time on Twitter. And North Koreans don’t have access to Twitter in the first place.
1/7: While @POTUS is in South Korea tomorrow, he should take the opportunity to speak to the North Korean people via Twitter, much like President Reagan bypassed the Soviet regime to speak to the people of the Soviet Union. 		So, you’re probably thinking... Twitter? Hear me out.

The SHIELDS Act is a vital and bipartisan bill that advances American interests, punishes those who support and enable Hizballah’s barbaric practices, and protects our allies in the region.
From its bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in 1983, to its rocket attacks against Israel, to its expanding influence in Syria today, Hizballah’s terrorist activities have served as a direct challenge to the United States and our allies.
Since its creation, Hizballah has been an Iranian proxy dedicated to destroying Israel and combating American interests in the Middle East.

Today in @HouseHomeland we voted to advance the #BorderSecurityForAmerica Act to the House floor -- a significant step in securing our Southern border. 		Read my full statement here → https://t.co/dQwmByGEWu https://t.co/3zWHwuCs8t
@RepMcCaul There's no question about it--as a matter of national security we MUST secure the border &amp; ports of entry. Today, @HouseHomeland is doing its part to get the job done.
To achieve full control and situational awareness of the border, we need tactical infrastructure (think fencing, a wall, air assets &amp; other barriers) and advanced technology (like a Bio-metric Entry-Exit System). All of which are included in Chairman @RepMcCaul's bill.
Right now the majority of drugs in the US are trafficked across the Southern border from Mexico. If we are going to eliminate the opioid epidemic that is destroying communities across the country, then securing the border has to be a priority.
During my time in the Marines, I was assigned to the DEA doing counternarcotic work and saw firsthand how porous the Southern border is.

Current proposals are too focused on the insurance market and not the cost of care itself. We need to think big &amp; innovate- not just tinker.
I think most members of my generation would welcome a more transparent &amp; flexible model, even if certain proposals challenge the orthodoxy.
In doing so Drs. can focus on caring for their patients instead of having to order a battery of tests to protect themselves from litigation.
Let’s focus on driving down the price of pharmaceutical drugs. While we’re at it let's realign doctors’ incentives.
To do this, let’s focus on transparency—what other industry in America do you buy something without having any clue what you’re paying for?
After all, insurance coverage is meaningless if your plan doesn’t allow you to get the quality, timely, and affordable care you need.
Lost in the national debate on the future of healthcare is how we actually drive down costs and improve outcomes. https://t.co/sf0KpyuYGZ

The challenges are great, and I am optimistic we can meet them. Mr. Spencer will find many allies in Congress. But we must get to work now.
We cannot delay or talk in platitudes about capability substituting for capacity. We tried that during the Obama administration. It failed.
For Mr. Spencer, there is no time to lose. The administration has a very limited window to enact real change to grow the fleet to 355.
Secretary Lehman ultimately succeeded. But it took personal leadership and work every day in service of a 600 ship Navy.
As he later reflected, by the end of the admin's 2nd year, "the defense bureaucracy had reasserted its hold over the policy process."
Predictably, he hit obstacles. Much of the defense bureaucracy resisted his vision and wanted to go about business as usual.
Sec Lehman grounded the case for 600 ships in the geography of the NATO alliance and its military imperative for sea control.
During the Reagan administration, a 600 ship Navy did not appear out of thin air. Secretary Lehman willed it into being.
A 355 ship Navy is a strategic imperative &amp; the admin’s defining promise. We cannot allow it to slip from our grasp. https://t.co/pHeuL291Jh

I appreciate Pres Trump’s desire to chart a more realistic course for US foreign policy. But this requires seeing Russia as it is. 10/10
Congress has a role to play here: we must pass tougher Iran/Russia	sanctions, &amp; a new AUMF (w/ oversight provisions) is long overdue 9/10
So it’s a fantasy that US can strike a grand CT bargain w/ Russia, which backs Iran &amp; hopes to destabilize US allies &amp; Europe. 8/10
No easy solutions in Syria, but we have interests in defeating ISIS, thwarting Iran’s hegemonic aims, &amp; limiting war’s impact &amp; reach. 7/10
Coordinating w/ Russia also risks glossing over serious US concerns re: Russian behavior, such as Ukraine invasion &amp; cyber aggression. 6/10
We need regional strategy to destroy ISIS AND rollback Iran. Coordination w/Russia does the opposite: bolsters Iran &amp; ultimately ISIS. 5/10
Focusing solely on ISIS in Syria emboldens Iran and deepens the	sectarian atmosphere off of which ISIS/AQ feed. 4/10
Obama ceded a Syrian sphere of influence to Russia &amp; Iran. Result =	our allies grew weaker &amp; our adversaries grew stronger --&gt; chaos. 3/10
Russia has abetted the Iran-backed Assad regime's genocide for yrs. It	has also frequently hit rebel groups that US supports, not ISIS. 2/10
It should be obvious that our objectives and Russia’s are NOT “exactly	the same” in Syria, as Sec Tillerson said Friday. 1/10

As we work with our regional partners to stabilize the region and secure our shared interests, America must once again lead from the front.
Yesterday in Saudi Arabia, the President struck exactly the right tone when it comes to strengthening cooperation with our allies.
The problems of the Middle East run much deeper than ISIS. We cannot solve them without rolling back Iran's campaign of terror &amp; radicalism.
The President's visit to the Middle East marks an important shift from eight years of putting Iran's interests ahead of those of our allies.

The sooner we abandon this fantasy and work with our allies to oppose the Russian-Iranian axis throughout the Middle East, the better.
Regardless of what was shared in the meeting, it's dangerous to believe that Russia can be a reliable counterterrorism partner.
Our allies and partners must have the utmost confidence that sensitive information they share with us will not be disclosed.
As an intelligence officer by training, I know firsthand the life and death implications of safeguarding classified information.
For the purpose of transparency, the White House should share a transcript of the meeting with the House and Senate intelligence committees.
While POTUS possesses the authority to disclose classified, even top secret, information, there’s a separate question of whether he should.

I look forward to working with my colleagues as we conduct our constitutionally-mandated oversight responsibilities.
We cannot afford any lingering questions. The legitimacy of our democracy and the sanctity of the rule of law is too important.
Americans deserve a full, fair, and honest account of what happened. They deserve the confidence that their government is telling the truth.
What we need now is a fearless, strong, and independent Director for the FBI. We must keep the faith with the American people.
The next steps from the President, the Department of Justice, and the Attorney General will say a great deal.
This goes for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The American people deserve the truth, not politically-driven talking points.
We must put the sanctity of our democracy far, far above partisan interest.
As we continue these critical investigations, we must ruthlessly pursue the true, wherever it may lead.
As I've discussed, Russia is no friend to the US. Its malicious activities here and abroad must not go unanswered. https://t.co/7xDb4x6qfx
