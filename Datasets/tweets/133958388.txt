@rmayemsinger @MollyJongFast Wait what!  McTurtle looks a bit rough.  Harrison Ford still has appeal.
@ananavarro Congratulations
@Stop_Trump20 They don’t my guess she has her own room with a sturdy lock!
@marama_ann @AngrierWHStaff That is the said part.  A major reason I stopped voting GOP is the shear stupidity going on.
@AngrierWHStaff I am waiting for the GOP to finally grow a step of balls and do what is right!
@MollyJongFast Wow.  He is behaving like a little baby bitch snowflake.
@SykesCharlie That would be my house.  My husband too has said only two dogs.
@KatiePhang Someone get grandpa.  He’s doing it again.
Tuesday cannot get here fast enough!  Finally will get the shoulder repaired!
@DrDenaGrayson @karolcummins @GOPLeader Good god.  Is he really that stupid?  WOW!
@EdKrassen I think he skipped that lesson.  His elevator is stuck in the basement
@TrueFactsStated I think Jim needs to put down the crack pipe!
@aravosis I totally agree.  Not worth the money
@Stop_Trump20 He looks like Beavis from Beavis and Butthead...Or is he Butthead!
@ChocaholicBrit I didn't follow him.  Cleaned up the house did some shopping.  Preparing for 10 days of not being able to use the right arm and shoulder due to rotator surgery!
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump I'll be cleaning the house instead.
@ChocaholicBrit @POTUS It sickens me that Jared gets a security clearance with his flags.  Normal Federal Workers have been fired and or referred to law enforcement for doing the same thing.
@WestWingReport Will this mean the baby will need extra naps.
@AngrierWHStaff They finally came to their senses and are trying to get off the damn crazy train!
@bryanbehar @Astrearedux Oh those two would lose their minds!  Double standards all the way for Meadows and Jordan
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The new low is you not wanting to uphold the Constitution and the Rule of Law.
@mattgaetz Too late.  It is still all over Twitter.  You may have deleted but someone is always watching.
@Zac_Petkanas @ZoeTillman He can have a cell to cell talk with Manafort now!
@kylegriffin1 Oh that was some serious shade thrown by Cohen.
@AngrierWHStaff Damn that was a seriousBURN!
@PalmerReport Jim’s elevator is stuck in the basement!
@TrueFactsStated @TheFlaBar @mattgaetz He is as attorney!  Gaetz actually graduated law school and became licensed in FL!   OMFG!  How stupid is he!
@TrueFactsStated So he's going to get away with creating another account while our fearless Spicy is suspended forever.
@maggieNYT So Parscale is consulting the village idiots!
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Really!   Really! Are you THAT Stupid to say something like that!  The day before he testifies?
@senatemajldr It's a federal holiday so people can vote and not miss work you MORON!
@Catheri60048274 @AngrierWHStaff Oh goodie!  I'll have to stream it from my computer at work!
@AngrierWHStaff What time does the ShitShow start so I can have popcorn on the standby
@AngrierWHStaff It's Five O'Clock Somewhere!  Go For it!
@Freedland WTF?
@badisnotgood45 How far is the Port in Georgia from Texas?  Remember the seizure of drugs at the Port of Philadelphia? How far is Philly from Texas, and the other southern border states?  A long way.
@Stop_Trump20 Uncle Fester with a wig and make up.
3:50 in the morning and I’m up watching Indiana Jones.  Insomnia sucks.
@aravosis She would have chewed him up and spit him out.  She was a tough lady.
@mattgaetz This is the one time I agree with you.  She needs to stay out of politics.
Going to take a break from Twitter today.  Had a long work week and the shoulder is not doing well today.  So it will be lots of rest and heat to make it feel better.
@TrueFactsStated What happened!  How long is she suspended!
@RiegerReport Tucker needs to put down the crack pipe!
Crawfish dinner!  Get in my belly!😂😂😂😂
@funder I give him 24 hours before he blows it and gets locked up
@kylegriffin1 WTF!  Did he forget he mentioned it?
@SpicyFiles I'm calling horse shit!  I think his attorneys are lazy as hell!  Again Horse Shit!
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump Wow.  Just wow.
@ChocaholicBrit @waltshaub @CREWcrew Take Care Sir.  We'll keep the watch.
@SpicyFiles @DevinNunes @OversightDems Girl you are on a roll tonight.  I bet Mueller has the receipts on this little bit of information.  Knew Nunes was dirty.  Dirty Bird Nunes will have his time in the barrel soon.
@DevinNunes I think you have your tinfoil hat on too tight!
@RealMuckmaker Nunes!
@AngrierWHStaff He is going to get his bail revoked.  Roger is so screwed!
@brownlegal @renato_mariotti @aliasvaughn That will be a glorious sight.
@renato_mariotti @aliasvaughn Same for this Paralegal.  The firms I worked for would have dropped him and returned his money.
@WritesTruths I wonder what the Judge will say tomorrow
@RMac18 Roger is not going to slither out of this.  Hope he likes the jailhouse jumpsuit.  Orange will look amazing on him.  He can spend his one hour a day walking the yard.
@Amy_Siskind I think he will get the cell next to Paul Manfort
@911CORLEBRA777 @LouiseMensch @FelisDave @thespybrief @ericgarland @JamesFourM @SpicyFiles @lauferlaw Also never heard of a Notice of Apology.  Kiss that bail money good bye Roger.  You are going to have a lot of time on your hands in jail.
@bradheath Hey @SpicyFiles take a look at this.  Never seen a Notice of Apology before.
@911CORLEBRA777 @LouiseMensch @FelisDave @thespybrief @ericgarland @JamesFourM @SpicyFiles @lauferlaw Looks like his attorneys filed a Notice of Apology with the courts.  Still think he is up the creek without a paddle.
@NatashaBertrand Oh this is good.  His ass is grass and the Judge is the lawnmower.  Hope he likes Orange because that will be his new color in jail.
@AngrierWHStaff I think Roger will have a cell next to Paulie soon.  Knew he could not keep his mouth shut.  I hope the judge throws the book at him.
@NYinLA2121 @TheRickWilson He is stupid.
@TeaPainUSA Good grief.  Stone is asking to have a jail cell next to Paulie "Walnut" Manafort!
@davidcicilline It was created to deflect from what is going on.  Something is coming from Mueller.  We just don't know what it exactly is.
@AngrierWHStaff Wonder who will be next for the courthouse perp walk.  Mueller has to have a big fat juicy one coming!
@SpicyFiles @TrueFactsStated @ericgarland @t_pletch How in the world was he EVER a member of the United States Secret Service?  HOW!  He comes across as a flaming moron (that is being nice as to not get me in twitter jail).
@PhilippeReines You may need a Brillo pad and bleach to get Miller’s stench off.
@kylegriffin1 He needs that golf fix.  We know he cheats.  Which golf greats donated to his re-election campaign to golf with him.
@AngrierWHStaff @TheRickWilson Diamond and Silk are a joke.
@kylegriffin1 Good grief. AGAIN!
@HillReporter Don't forget Mar-a=Lago had it's own bad marks by Health Inspectors too.
@Stop_Trump20 He's jealous because they didn't invite him to host SNL.
@AngrierWHStaff I thought it was hilarious!  He paused expecting applause and got nothing.
@MollyJongFast Wow.  That is his story?  You know Nixon tried that and he had the balls to resign when it was clear he was screwed.
@AngrierWHStaff Why did you have to wake the baby.  Now it will take forever to put the baby back to sleep!
@kylegriffin1 It is an eye opener for many people.  Even my spouse who is drunk on the orange kool-aid.  Our accountant said he needs to change his withholdings. He's not taking enough out!  Then he had the nerve to ask what if we file married separately.  The accountant said no bigger penalty
@PhilippeReines @realDonaldTrump Don’t wake the baby.  Let the baby sleep. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@ChocaholicBrit Something is going down and the Man-Baby is in a snit.  I wonder if Mueller is ready to drop another surprise.
Just me, the dogs and a raging headache watching movie.
@politico Someone needs to shove Miller back into the hole he slithered out of.
@LouiseMensch @karolcummins @MingGao26 @realDonaldTrump @Comey He of all people has to know, there is always someone listening.  Oh Lordy the tapes are probably a mine-field of information on the rats.  At least Nixon had the balls to reign when the writing was on the wall.  This one.  He is too stupid to know Mueller has him by the balls.
@aravosis I wonder if a big fat juicy indictment is going to drop that has set off the man-child.
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump I may have to update my alerts on WaPo breaking news!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump I'm wondering if Mueller is getting ready to drop a big fat juicy indictment.  Something has set off the man-baby.
@MollyJongFast @Redpainter1 Seems she has bigger air bags.
@TrueFactsStated Wow.  That is just tacky.  Can we all say Trump is 100% trailer trash
@ChocaholicBrit Watching movies here.
@MollyJongFast Can we send him back to the hole he slithered from.
@kylegriffin1 God POTUS is such a petty, fickle snowflake.  Like a bad episode of Mean Girls.
@TimOBrien She is a grifter trying to get those Patents to peddle her lifted designer bag and shoes.  Think her Daddy needs to get his money back on her college degree.  It is clearly a waste of money.  Ivanka strikers me as a gold digger and plastic Barbie.
@PalmerReport My guess it is more than the Nanny issue.  She has some scary skeletons in her closet!
@MollyJongFast Can we send Miller back to whatever hell hole he slithered out of.  Just looking at him makes me want to scrub myself with a Brillo Pad and Bleach to get his stench off the nation.
@morethanmySLE @4everNeverTrump @4everNeverTrum Done.  Good Luck @4everNeverTrump in getting the imposter shutdown.
@AngrierWHStaff Bernie needs to just go away.  He's a nuisance.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Your party controls the Senate.  Maybe your own party has issues with your nominees.
@mattgaetz You didn’t have the votes in your own damn party.
@kylegriffin1 He declared a national emergency and what does he do leave DC and goes GOLFING!  WTF!
@antitheticate @StahlGilda Thanks.
@StahlGilda Maybe because Nauert wasn't qualified to fill the position.  I thought he hired the best people.  I'm being to think only the most corrupted people are hired!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Moron...I wasn't forced to sign up for The Affordable Care Act.  I was able to keep my healthcare.
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump He's not looking well.  His facial expression is very much like my father who has Alzheimers.
@AltUSPressSec Bernie needs to go away!  He is nothing but trouble.
@MollyJongFast Hot Sauce here but never Ketchup.  Remember this is the same man who puts Ketchup on his STEAK that is cook WELL DONE!
@SpicyFiles @TrueFactsStated @aliasvaughn @DonaldJTrumpJr @lauferlaw @xtrixcyclex Stone and company could be their own episode of World's Dumbest Criminals!
@911CORLEBRA777 @LouiseMensch @thespybrief @ericgarland She shouldn’t. She isn’t qualified to walk my dogs!
Trying to figure out why I’m awake at 1:30 in the morning?  Yeah, battling whatever crud i have going around the office.
@ChocaholicBrit @ColMorrisDavis Oh I think the Commander will win!  LOL!!!!
@joshtpm There is some secret so bad that Lindsey is this complicit.  I wonder how bad it is.
@aawayne How in the HELL does that many have a security clearance.
@SenShelby @realDonaldTrump Last time I vote for you.  Coward.
@ALT_DOJ @AOC @RepAOC @politico I too think she is arrogant.  She has some great ideas, she needs to truly think before she speaks!
@kylegriffin1 I hate to say this.  She’s right.
@funder About damn time the courts shut Roger Stone down
@Stop_Trump20 You’re joking? Is this from the satire site The Onion?
@LindseyGrahamSC Coward.  You use to be for Rule of Law.  Now you are save your own arse.  What are they holding over your held to make you behave like this.
@MollyJongFast The GOP had BOTH Chambers of Congress for two years and could not get their shit in order.  This is all on McConnell
@davidcicilline Thank you for protecting the rule of law.  There are few GOP members who are Country first Party second.
@senatemajldr @POTUS You complicit coward.  Had two years to do the funding and NOW it is a crisis!  Sold your soul for seven pieces of silver
@PressSec @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why is he going to Florida if there is a big crisis.  You don’t declare a national emergency then leave town!
@cmclymer How about a baby bottle with Diet Coke and Valium
@AngrierWHStaff Off the rails andoverthe CLIFF!
@PhilipRucker @maggieNYT @KellyO If this were DEM president the GOP would be furious!  This is not normal!  I bet he is talking to these people on his insecure IPhone too
@AngrierWHStaff Wow.  Let’s see how that holds up in court
@TheRickWilson Oh snap Ann is going to light him up!  If she’s not on his side then it’s on like Donkey King!
@ChocaholicBrit Takes money from MILCON to find the wall.  We have buildings on military bases falling apart!  WTF!
@AngrierWHStaff Deal lord.  Why do they tolerate this crap!
@aravosis One Big Mac away from super morbidly obese he is
@BillKristol They are complicit that is for sure.  History will remember this day
@AngrierWHStaff Shit is being flung at every turn.
@TheRickWilson It is going to be a rough one.
@aravosis By saying he is 6’3” he is only overweight but he really is only 6’1” and obese.  He is seriously unhealthy and people are lying to make him feel good.
@TrueFactsStated So he claims there is a National Emergency when there is no Emergency.  So now he’s flying to Florida to get his golfing fix
@TheRickWilson On what planet?  He is a wannabe PH.d
@PalmerReport How in the hell does he have a security clearance?
@LouiseMensch @karolcummins @AltNellGwyn @donna_spackman @JordanaChe @DougJones @RandPaul @Comey So by baiting POTUS, he would pick someone who would dare I say follow the rule of law?
@WestWingReport Of course his cholesterol is good with that dosage of statins.  There is more they are hiding.
@AngrierWHStaff My son is the same height and weights 187 pounds!
@AngrierWHStaff There has to be more they are not telling us.
@TrueFactsStated Nope he's well over three hundred!  I don't believe his BP is that.  It has to be WITH BP Meds.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS I hope it will be challenged in court.  You know if a GOP President does this what is to stop a DEM president.  You are setting a very dangerous precedent
@CarvemupJames @kylegriffin1 EXACTLY.
@AaronBlake Wow.  Speechless
@CarvemupJames @kylegriffin1 They way he talks is very similar to my father who suffers from Alzheimers.  They are covering it up big time.
@kylegriffin1 He's really over 300 pounds, his bloodwork is a mess and he is showing signs of dementia.  They don't want the truth to come out.  He's very unhealthy and very sick.
@GOP @VP Clean up you own damn party first!
@AmandiOnAir Three stooges up to their neck in Rubles.
@ewarren We all know his daddy paid off teachers to make Jr look smart.  Junior is dumb as a rock and a dim-wit.
@VP @IlhanMN How about cleaning up your own party FIRST!
@TrueFactsStated He’s over 300 pounds, a cheeseburger away from a heart attack and very possibly has dementia!
@SpicyFiles @CNNPolitics He's going away for a very long time.  I wonder if Stone and the other rats will be sharing with Paulie too?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh honey....He's saving his best cards for the last hand.  You're up the creek without a paddle when it hits the fan.
@funder Manafort, Stone, Pence and Flynn.  ALL need to share a cell.
@SpicyFiles @GOP @AudreyGarden @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner @aliasvaughn Isn't this the same property owned by Frog Prince Jared?  Oh how deliciously interesting.  I hope Jared is nailed to the wall on this.  You know he's up to his neck in Borscht!
@TrueFactsStated No, Someone has dirt on Lindsey Graham.  Whatever the dirt is, it must be very bad and damaging to him.  He is complicit as hell in his behaviors.
@funder @realDonaldTrump He doesn't want the country know he's over 300 pounds, he's unhealthy, and very possibly suffering from dementia.  They pressured the Navy Commander to lie in that memo too.
@SpicyFiles @GOP @HouseGOP @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump I'm old enough to remember when Nixon was running around saying "WITCH HUNT" and his party supported impeaching him!  Back when the GOP put Country before Party!  Geez.....I'm old!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Has anyone educated POTUS on the laws.
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump We all know the campaign used a craigslist ad to get all those people to attend.
@mawarmuth @SpicyFiles LOL 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
@JDiamond1 @realDonaldTrump Need a wider show to see the small crowd!  Or does the camera adds more people!
@SpicyFiles WOW!!  He really doesn't want people to know his dirty little secrets.
@SpicyFiles I have no clue what in the hell grandpa is doing.  Someone needs to take the phones away and thrown them into the Potomac!  FAST!
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump God he's lazy as hell.
@davidfrum I’m not a crook.  Heard that before.  Even Jared’s  “I did not collude with ....”;  to match Clinton’s “ I didn’t have sexual relations.” Is a classic
@samstein You know the fork and knife are for show.  I bet he picked that chicken up with his fingers.
@MalcolmNance Why can’t Prince and his sister Betsy just go away.
@Stop_Trump20 Didn’t she pull a similar stunt at another awards show.  My inner Yoda is wanting to appear.
@AngrierWHStaff Keep up the good work.  Love your blog.
@Stop_Trump20 Oh dear.   Keep us posted.  Twitter is doing some strange crap lately.
@karolcummins Geez there is some crazy shit going on.
@PalmerReport He was also afraid of the rain in Paris!  I'm beginning to think he's is a very lazy person with the energy of a SLOTH!
@karolcummins Wait?  WHAT?   He's leaving?  As in Retiring?
@DNCpeep @realDonaldTrump Executive Time is Private Time.  Means he's watching Fox News and god knows what else.  He keeps banker's hours!
@WestWingReport There is a pictures for every event!  WOW!!!
This is some funny shit!		https://t.co/bBxr1m7QD9
@maryhh44 @tribelaw True very true.  He has the attention span of a 2 year old.
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump @ericgarland Wow is that the story AMI is going with?  I guess there will be a lot of AMI executives joining Pecker in Federal Prison.  So many dumb criminals.
@tribelaw I don’t know how many times the attorneys I work for tell people “No you can’t do that with the money. You do that it will trigger Anti-Deficiency Act violation.” It’s clear how the appropriated funds are to be used. If POTUS had advisors worth a damn they would tell him this.
@yashar She is not afraid of snow and cold temps like POTUS.  I think she is going to hold her own for 2020
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump Oh geez hate autocorrect that should be binky
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump Someone forgot to give his binary and a clean diaper!
@realDonaldTrump Executive time is used frequently in the government by officials as private time.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/LLQyULMVQP
@PalmerReport They are deflecting everything.  They are hoping people take the bait.  Also with many candidates being female the GOP will be even more nasty in their attacks.  The fox blaming the weasel for attacking the hen house. When it was the fox who attacked the hen house.
@CREWcrew How are any of these members qualified for any post?  They are not qualified to watch my kid, dogs or house!  They are not qualified to pick up trash!
Clearly Raven doesn’t understand she is not a lap dog! https://t.co/IhO1ZfS37X
@SpicyFiles You’re on fire today Spicy.....keep up the good work!
@Lady_Star_Gem @DearAuntCrabby They became complicit in their quest to win the WH.  Sold their souls to the devil and now the bill is due.  History will remember their actions.
@naretevduorp Wait?  Wasn't his various business found to have employed undocumented people?  His business seeks special visas for workers  to be employed at his vineyards, hotels, and clubs?  WOW!  This administration is filled with a bunch of HYPOCRITES!
@Misssusannahf Is the guy sitting trying to put a pair of PANTS on like a SHIRT!  OH MY GOD!
@Acosta I’m going to call BS!  He is obese, he is not239 pounds, he is not is excellent health he is sick,and possible showing signs of dementia.  The doctors have to stop sugar coating his exam results.
@TrueFactsStated As someone who has received care at many military treatment facilities.  This is an utter disgrace of military medicine.  His fellow military doctors should be ashamed of his conduct.  We all know POTUS is not in good healthy and likely VERY obese!  This is sad.  Very sad.
@mattgaetz They call to impeach the LT Gov but not the Gov?  The optics is very bad here.
@TrueFactsStated How stupid are the people at AMI?  I suspect the immunity deal is going to be voided and Pecker will be seeing prison time.
@RobLowe Complicit much?
@williamlegate Was the Judge drinking on air?  Did she have one too many glasses of Vino.  Nothing makes sense on her show.
Alright Twitter Fam.  Body is saying slow down and rest.  Find out later this month what plan b is for my shoulder.  Night all and stay out of trouble.
@aravosis They would have subpoenaed them.  Also “but her email” hearings, no SCJ to replace Scalia.  More hearings over Uranium One.  That is what would have happened.  When the shoe is on the other foot the GOP makes excuse after excuse why they will not comply!
@maydaymindy9 @DearAuntCrabby All the above!
Who needs a doorbell when the four legged doorbells alert you someone is at the front door!
@Stop_Trump20 You know that is funny.  They were calling people who would not embrace Trump as Snowflakes.  Why is it THEY are the ones blocking people the most.
@williamlegate They needed a bigger scale
@realDonaldTrump It is called OVERSIGHT.  Something the GOP ran from for 2 years.
@StopTrump2020 And even more trashy.  Hell trailer trash wouldn’t welcome them to the neighborhood.
@AngrierWHStaff It was too cold for golfing so he was pouting in the WH watching Fox News of course.
@EdKrassen I’m not looking forward to doing my taxes.
@JohnWDean Hoping AMI and company have their immunity’s deal torn up and they go to prison for a very long time.
A very quiet evening here.  Kiddo and pups decided to nap so watching the newer version of Oceans 11.  Took the daughter and daughter in law to a nice lunch before the granddaughter arrives. All in all a good day.
@renato_mariotti They are using other people’s money to pay for their dirty deeds.  Kremlin Barbie and Prince Toad are in it deep.  Mueller indicts her daddy will cave.  He loves his Princess.
@ChocaholicBrit LOL...I know!
@Stop_Trump20 We all know Tomi’s elevator is stuck in the basement.  She’s dumbass a brick.
@B52Malmet We all know he is over 300 pounds and in poor health.  You can put lipstick on a pig still makes it a pig.  Wonder if RADM Jackson wrote it and told him (the Commander) to sign it.
@ChocaholicBrit We love you.  You keep us grounded.
@Stop_Trump20 So if we stick a light bulb in her mouth will it light up?
@MollyJongFast An O5 will obey the O7 to make it look positive.  We all know he’s well over 300 pounds and in bad health
@DaraHasWords @politico Interesting
@cynnebelle @kylegriffin1 Exactly!
@realDonaldTrFan 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
@JuddLegum Which Admiral pressured the Commander to write that?
@tedlieu @VP @mike_pence @POTUS At some point in time the light bulb will come on for Pence.  His elevator is stuck in the basement.  Pence isn’t too bright.
@JoyceWhiteVance Notice the doctor is an O5 (Commander).  He could be forced to tow the line with a Rear Admiral hovering over you.  The doctors need to be able to be transparent.  I think he is ill and they are covering this up.  There is no way he was 239 last year.  I do believe he is over 300
@HomelandDems @StormResist @VP Nah lets see how long it takes him to figure it out.  He is a few bricks shy of a wall.  LOL
@Stop_Trump20 Oh Lordy.....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@MollyJongFast Does Tomi's elevator go all the way to the top floor OR does it stop halfway up.  She seems like a not so bright individual.
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump While it appears no Appropriated monies were used for said event.  The optics are VERY BAD!  I know my ethics attorney would be pulling what is left of his hair out over that decision.
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/wiBfuZk0UU
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump I'll have to find the article and post it.
@politico Wait....I thought she had Secret Service protection?  Did she give them the night off?
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump I heard a US Army Unit had a military ball there?  WTF!
@MollyJongFast Wow!  who's runner up?
@DearAuntCrabby @NBCNews I'm calling BS!  They had a Navy Commander complete the exam which means officers higher than him can apply pressure to make it look like CIC is in great health!  We all know something is wrong with him.  Carly Simon's song "You're so Vain" comes to mind.
@kylegriffin1 Good.  We don't need shadow advisors dictating policy and contracts regarding healthcare for our veterans!
@MollyJongFast Cry me a f**king river Roger.  You may have slithered your way out of the WaterGate.  You will not with Mueller he has ALL the receipts
@Stop_Trump20 Agreed.  You know they looked the other way on their very serious flags.
@MollyJongFast Jim Jordan
@BradMossEsq Double standards again.  Regular Feds are fired!
@RepMattGaetz @KennedyNation Like yourself.  You seem to be on the airwaves move than legislating.
@kylegriffin1 What?  I hope he misspoke?
@mkraju I have swamp land in the Sahara to sell too.
@renato_mariotti What does McCarthy have hiding in his closet.  This means he has secrets and he is afraid of them coming to light.
@EdKrassen If they are so hell-bent on protecting life.  I want Pence and his cohorts to go out there adopting the babies and children who need families.  Oh wait...They won't cause Pence and company are a bunch of hypocrites!
@mkraju @jeremyherb OMFG!  Are they for real?  Nunes and Company had their chance.  They didn't find crap.  All they did was deflect from the real issue.
@MollyJongFast Lord help us all Rick’s elevator doesn’t go all the way to the top floor.
@Dax_x98 Watching Lord of the Rings.
@BlueGhost40_ I want to know what skeletons are hiding in Grahams closet.  These must be bad for him to be complicit.
@Acosta Oh god what in the Hell has Miller cooked up.  Whatever it is it will be horrid!
@BBuchman_CNS @CourthouseNews Yeah I'm going to be watching something else.  I'll get the cliff note version later.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Watching Hunger Games or Star Wars.
@RealMuckmaker Going to watch Hunger Games or Star Wars and catch up on Twitter for the coverage from the usual crowd.
@steve_vladeck @MollyJongFast Do any of those morons understand Presidential Records Act!  My god this is a nightmare!
Well hell.  Brady gets another damn ring.
Well decided the Super Bowl was boring watching Hunger Games marathon
@ChocaholicBrit I was so bored watching a Hunger Games Marathon now.
@cmclymer I like the NFL 100 one.
@DearAuntCrabby I say 340
@TrueFactsStated Camera adds 30 pounds!  Thinking more 340
Oh this is so funny! https://t.co/MZn3FIHzj7
@TrueFactsStated Yeah it was pretty sucky.
@2020willbeblue @SassyKadiK @Elwood_R Geez!  That is bad.
@Stop_Trump20 Is that what I think they are?  Whoever made these needs an award.
@cmclymer I'm loving this.  I'm rooting for the underdog Rams.
Loving the game.  Wade Phillips is showing the Patriots his defense is in it for the LONG HAUL.  Gronk is already limping off.  Brady sacked fumbled but Patriots got the ball back.  Love it!
@AngrierWHStaff Bull Shit!  Mattis is a patriot.  Mattis is a man of beliefs.
@MollyJongFast If we are talking Brady.  He is an arrogant SOB that thinks his crap doesn’t stink.  I want the Rams defense to shut him down!
@pattyjoe24 @CaptainsLogAz @StormResist @TheSWPrincess @ManInTheHoody @B52Malmet @ListenToEzra @ProudResister @exoticgamora @DanaScottLO @Lady_Star_Gem @wesley_jordan I want Suh and Arnold to sack Brady!
@CaptainsLogAz @StormResist @TheSWPrincess @ManInTheHoody @B52Malmet @ListenToEzra @ProudResister @exoticgamora @DanaScottLO @Lady_Star_Gem @wesley_jordan 👏👏👏👏👏👏Well said.  I am cheering for the Rams!
@SassyKadiK @Elwood_R Oh crap.  Me and my husband could be in trouble.
@Stop_Trump20 Yeah he needs to step away from the spray tan.  He looks like am Oompa Loompa!
@EdKrassen That should be company.  Typing and snacking a bad options.
@EdKrassen I am waiting for Suh and coming to sack the crap out of Brady!
@Stop_Trump20 What’s the difference both suck
@AngrierWHStaff Right now we are being tortured by clips of the interview and it is already painful!
@JuddLegum It’s in now and I want to poke my eyes out!  He is rambling.
Oh lord help us.  Super Bowl coverage interrupted for the interview with CIC!  I can’t change or mute it.
@CREWcrew Makes you wonder what will happen when he is back in court Friday?  Will the judge revoke his bail and have him in a cell near Paul Manafort?
@AngrierWHStaff Rooting for the Rams here!
@HillReporter That is a very bad spray tan.
@stonecold2050 Scary part.  The man has a license to practice MEDICINE and was a Surgeon.  That is a scary thought!
@TopRopeTravis Oh my he could be in a cell next to Manafort if he’s not careful.  The judge warned him.
@Stop_Trump20 He was having massive golfing withdrawals
RT @verizon: For every RT we’ll donate $1, up to $1.5M, in support of first responders to the @GarySiniseFound (1.18.19 – 2.8.19). At age 5…
@MalcolmNance Oh more juicy details!
@SpicyFiles Broke and seriously in debt with all the wrong people.  The bills are coming due.
@SpicyFiles My guess he is broke and in debt to his neck.
@kylegriffin1 Oh joy.  Wonder which “unofficial” advisers are with him.
@TeaPainUSA Response should be.  We know his lying ass would destroy evidence if he received prior knowledge of his arrest Senator Dumbass Graham.
@LouiseMensch Hum....people wonder WHY a judge signed off on the early morning arrest.  To keep Stone from destroying evidence!  Oh Lordy Mueller has all the receipts
@SaysHummingbird Mick already tired of the shit sandwich?
@AaronBlake Did he forget to mention the 1.3 million dollars of the same drug seized at the Port of Philadelphia in December?  Again another port of entry?
@SenTomCotton What about the 1.3 million in Fentanyl seized at the Port of Philadelphia?  Again another port of entry where this was seized.
@MelissaBallardJ @morethanmySLE @GOPLeader @HouseGOP @RepMoBrooks @USRepGaryPalmer Both of them LOVE to come to the bases in North Alabama for photo-ops while stabbing them in the back.
@morethanmySLE @GOPLeader @HouseGOP @RepMoBrooks voted NO!  Considering Alabama receives a LARGE portion of it's money from several Department of Defense BASES!  Not to mention a HUGE NASA complex?  Mo is a Hypocrite.
@Stop_Trump20 Once Junior finds out Daddy will only save Ivanka!  That is when Junior will sing like a little bird.
@MollyJongFast I wonder what he's hiding?  He looks nervous.
@tedlieu Good JOB!  Love it.
@SpicyFiles Oh lordy what in the hell is going on?  Stone must be the biggest IDIOT on the face of the planet!  I hope he has a cell next to Paulie Manafort.
@MollyJongFast Who in the hell proof reads these letter!
@lauferlaw @DrDenaGrayson Does this mean Stone and Paulie will be roomies in the local lock up! Guess he will be trading in those tacky suits for an Orange or Green jumpsuit! I think the Judge will rip him a new one over the stunt he pulled over the weekend.  I feel a gag order coming his way.
@AngrierWHStaff Haven't you heard?  The WH only hires the "Best" people!  ROFLMAO!
@SpicyFiles @Cocacolakid @911CORLEBRA777 @LouiseMensch @lauferlaw @DirkSchwenk @thespybrief @ericgarland Does this mean Roger and Paulie Manafort may be roomies in the local lock-up because Roger can't mind the conditions of bail?  Who in the bloody hell is his attorney and why hasn't he told the moron to keep his pie-hole shut!
@TheRickWilson 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
@kenolin1 Leavenworth
@SpicyFiles My oh my I say...I say I do believe there is a fox in the Hen house.  Oh Lordy there are receipts!
@SpicyFiles I see a freshman Congresswoman and a few Senators who received $$$$$
@SpicyFiles You are on fire tonight
@SandraBernhard Bernie Sanders is like a bad rash.  You can never get rid of it.
@MollyJongFast Didn’t six of his siblings support his opponent?
@Kris_Sacrebleu He will end up sharing a cell with Paulie Manafort if he keeps it up.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Mueller knows everything.  He has the receipts.
@joncoopertweets All three on the same day would be EPIC!
@joshscampbell Good God....and Huckabee was governor of WHAT state?  Geez
@SpicyFiles @SHO_TheCircus @jheil @mmckinnon @alexwagner @SpicyFiles did you see SNL’s take on Stone!  It is hilarious
@TrueFactsStated Just like the Nixon Foundation statement distancing themselves from Stone. 😹😹😹😹😹
@amjoyshow @MalcolmNance Nope you get one bite at that apple!
@PalmerReport Wait what? McTurtle McConnell is in the hot seat.  So he has been found!
@ChocaholicBrit @realDonaldTrump Who is feeding him these figures?  The squirrels on th WH grounds?
@TeaPainUSA Why are these programs booking that moron.  He is just digging the hole deeper.
@TeaPainUSA Oh the old coffee boy line.  Bless his heart.
@justinamash Love it! https://t.co/dBB01vVwPa
@AnneBowen20 @WMN4SRVL @ProudResister No kidding.  Why is it the hard core ones have the biggest skeletons in hiding in their closets.  Makes you wonder what is behind door number 1 for Pence and company.
@maddogpac Oh Lordy....Should have attached a warning to that.  My EYES!!!! It BURNS!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@AnneBowen20 @WMN4SRVL @ProudResister Lord Help Us.  Pence is a different kind of something.  Will be a horrible episode of The Handmaid's Tale!
@gtconway3d Someone else behaved like that.  Oh yeah NIXON as he left the WH when he resigned.  I predict Stone will fold like a house of cards.
@brianstelter @KatiePavlich @hogangidley45 Sounds like he caved.
@DavidAFrench If World's Dumbest was still on Tru TV Roger Stone and Company would be an entire episode!
Wow.  This is major shade. https://t.co/UPA3dmNVyK
@ProudResister So what happens when the Golden Calf is removed from office before Primaries?  Inquiring minds would like to know.  They won't have the Golden Calf to worship.
@SaysHummingbird Does he not have an attorney?  Shouldn't his attorney be telling him STAY OFF TV!  Let Stone keep running his mouth on TV just gives Mueller more ammo to nail his ass further.  I'm beginning to think this is an episode of Dumb Criminals!
@justinbaragona Fox likes to deflect from the truth.  RBG where do I buy one!
@DearAuntCrabby She needs a couple of cheeseburgers along with way.  Ann is bat shit crazy.
@ddale8 @soledadobrien Please tell me they put some sort of GPS on Stone.
@ericgarland @jeaniebt57 That is the start of my day!  I have work with attorneys all day long. LOL!🤣🤣
@jeaniebt57 @ericgarland LOL....I know.  I'll have to have a glass when I get home from work.
@EdKrassen Of course Fox will air something to deflect.  Won't be able to check Twitter at work so will have to wait for the tantrums when I get home.
@EdKrassen I was wondering who Person 2 was.  Thanks @EdKrassen for the reminder!
@AngrierWHStaff I read it and love it.  Means more members of the Flying Monkey Brigade will be grounded soon.  Stand-by for the major temper-tantrum.  You know it is coming!
@ericgarland Is it too early for a glass of scotch to celebrate!
@TrueFactsStated Stone is up the creek without a paddle!  Downside, what will the WH do to deflect?  We all know when it goes down like this there will be an act to deflect the public.
@KenDilanianNBC @strickdc @PeterAlexander Sad part normal Feds are fired if they can’t get a security clearance.  Dislike the double standards!
@ChocaholicBrit Thinking the same thing.
@SpicyFiles @ChiefCovfefe @Alyssa_Milano @lauferlaw @tribelaw @realDonaldTrump If he had attorneys worth a damn they would tell him he can’t do it.  Oh wait no respectable attorney wants to be part of the flying monkey brigade!
@WestWingReport New bottle of scotch?
@waltshaub This has been a nightmare for those wanting to help and being mindful of the ethics rules.
@MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump Yeah I blocked that Artem dude when he popped in as a follower.
@ChocaholicBrit Pup is a cutie.   Mini-stress relief.
@ChocaholicBrit New Fur Baby?
@TheRickWilson Rudy is going to need a bigger damn shovel for the hole he keeps digging!
@kylegriffin1 Does he not read or listen the the reports?  Of course not.  He has to have it in picture form with his name repeated over and over to keep his damn attention
@jaketapper @gtconway3d Oh lord help us.  Someone show POTUS a damn map of the United States!  That is just sad
@RealKellyJones Just looking at the video felt the IQ go down a few points!
@chucktodd @MeetThePress @RudyGiuliani @MarkWarner @Liz_Cheney Why are you having that clown Rudy on your show!  He is a boil on society.  Everything out of his mouth is lies.
So far this is keeping the shoulder pain at bay till I see the specialist.  MRI shows partially torn tendon and shoulder muscle.  Don’t know is the shoulder needs surgery. https://t.co/ipK4KOwJnU
@RogueFirstLady @ABC @ABCPolitics @netflix That’s what I’m doing.  Netflix and lots of binge watching.
Cold rainy day in Northern Alabama so movies it is while nursing a banged up shoulder.
@senatemajldr No you will not bring the bill approved by the ?HOUSE to the floor for a vote.  You have the votes for a veto override also!
@AngrierWHStaff Excuse me while I laugh at Rudy’s pathetic appearance.  Chris made Rudy is bitch!
@SpoxDHS @CNN @TSA God you are suck a terrible liar!
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Coward.
@SpicyFiles @DevinNunes You are on fire Spicy!  Welcome back!
@tedlieu For a man who boasts he's a billionaire....He could have paid for a catered event!  That was just plain TACKY!  That is some trailer trash crap.
@AdamParkhomenko That line is up there with Nixon  "I'm not a crook" and Clinton "I didn't have sexual relations!"  Geez....I cannot wait for the Mueller report!
@spookperson Overrun by trailer trash and wack-a-nuts!
@tbogg @aravosis The man was too cheap to order GrubHub or UberEats!
@nedprice @SpicyFiles
@LoverOfBooks123 @ALT_uscis Here is a fitting video to match that photo! 	https://t.co/IH31ayBQur
@cbouzy @TyHyCHI @hunterw WTH?
@ALT_uscis Did anyone think about using Uber Eats, GrubHub?  WOW!
@ALT_uscis I thought there were Navy Chefs there too.  I’m sorry this is trailer trash crap!
I don’t know what to say about this photo.  REALLY fast food?  Couldn’t pay for Uber Eats to bring something better! https://t.co/J7YtgL0b9J
OMG!  Seriously!  Lighting candles! https://t.co/WhmUHGCZqf
WTF!!!! https://t.co/Q4vsgKokXV
@billprady Please tell me this is a joke!  Got he is such trailer trash!
@vinctee @GLSCHWALL Puppets!
@janznsea @LAFinTexas @AngrierWHStaff Thanks.  Typed the Tweet after having a medical procedure!
RT @According2Luke: Must watch. Journalist drops hammer on Breitbart editor.	Dr. Sarah Kendzior with 60 seconds that needed to be said.	BOO…
@RepMarkMeadows You had control of both chambers of Congress to push the funds for a wall.  You pick the day you lose control to need the money!  We need security funding not a damn wall.
@krassenstein The baby sitters have left the building and the man-child is running wild!
@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler @POTUS You mad Bro!  Suck it up you lost the majority deal with it.  This is why I am an independent.  I like my GOP members to put Country before Party!
@trumptheshitsho Oh lord.
@AdamParkhomenko @ananavarro Diamond and Silk are trailer trash.
@KellyO Is KAC shoveling snow like she shovels crap?
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Port of of Philadelphia seized more than a million dollars in fentayl that is no where near the southern border.  There are other areas this is happening at.
@ealight461 @LAFinTexas @AngrierWHStaff Thanks.
@LAFinTexas @AngrierWHStaff It has been radio silence on Sessions here in Alabama.   He is back but not poking his head out at all.  Agree Sessions is up to his eyes I. Trouble. Think McGahn will be the new James Dean.
@AngrierWHStaff Notice how McGahn and Sessions have been out of sight?  Could they be somewhere singing their little hearts out?
@Stop_Trump20 My dogs are smarter than him.
@LouDobbs @DearAuntCrabby How is NOW people are realizing we elected a con man!  His own home state hates him!
@thehill Nope not going to happen Rudy.  Doesn’t work like that
@TheRynheart I blocked that guy.  He showed up in my Twitter followers and it didn’t smell right.
@fawfulfan I would block Artem.  I did.
@AngrierWHStaff I think the IC is waiting for the right time to spring the trap.
@RepMarkMeadows Hypocrite
@AngrierWHStaff I blocked Artem.  He popped into my followers
@Stop_Trump20 I think I’m going to be sick 🤢
@JCBua My bet is KAC.  She is and expert at shoveling crap.  Snow shouldn’t be an issue!
@HarrenGWarding @ALT_uscis It is tricky with the ethics rules.  I would think a co pay under ten would be fine.  Any government ethics attorneys floating around?  I don’t have access to my files
@MollyJongFast Maybe KAC can shovel it.  She is good at shoveling crap.  Snow will be easy for her.
@TrueFactsStated @TwitterSupport The person Artem who tweeted that I to block him.  He popped up as a follower on my account.
@SaysHummingbird My blind dog is more qualified!
@ericgarland Wow...He keeps giving Mueller more and more evidence!
@essenviews @GLSCHWALL WTF?  These people are home trying to keep the lights on, keep their homes, feed their families!  These guys are so out of touch! This is not a vacation.  This is will I need to find a temp job!
@GOP @parscale https://t.co/gUmKthB9W1		Explain how you will stop the tunnels UNDER the walls
@seungminkim @PhilipRucker He will stew and fume in the residence.  Wonder which staffer will make the McDonald’s run
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/gUmKthB9W1		Explain how you will combat the tunnels.
@TheRickWilson Disclaimer found pic of Cam Newton on Google.
@TheRickWilson ☝️Cam Newton is 245 and six feet five.  No way Trump is 239! https://t.co/AcIxL5b1DK
@TheRickWilson Think he is close to 300
@amandablount2 Know they feeling.  Mine ended up with an MRI scan
@morethanmySLE Take it easy Peter.  We need you to keep up the fight for all
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Give them hell Spicy!
@BlueP_NutGalery @kylegriffin1 @justinamash @andybiggs4az @RepGosar @RepGrothman @RepThomasMassie @chiproytx @RepTedYoho Figures.
@kylegriffin1 Which seven voted no?
@AynRandPaulRyan @JohnBerman Mo Brooks need to go.  Many of us in Alabama dislike him.
@GOP How are you going to ensure they don’t start creating TUNNELS!  Need equipment to catch the diggers!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @Acosta Sarah explain how border patrol is now finding evidence they are digging tunnels.  Explain that.
When you’re home due to back issues what does one do.....binge watch Game of Thrones.
@AngrierWHStaff @DevinNunes Someone needs to remind Devin his party is not the minority in the House.  I think he will be on the wrong side of things when the report drops!
@MonicaH028 @RepMarkMeadows Good grief.  All 100 need to grow the hell up!
@RepMarkMeadows Geez the first line should be bill first voted on the GOP owned both chambers.  Blame it on the meds for my back and shoulder. LOL
@RepMarkMeadows Should be on not own.
@RepMarkMeadows When the bill first was voted own the GOP opened BOTH chambers.  Ryan refused to bring it to the house.  The house approved said same bill McConnell refuses to bring this and others to the Senate for a vote.  Go back and read the facts!
@erichards24 @Stop_Trump20 My bet they are one step closer from being disbarred and have no morals
@Alyssa_Milano @Stop_Trump20 The fact that 28.1 million watched is sad.
@SpicyFiles @TrueFactsStated @maddogpac Why is Uncle Fester there looking important
@Stonekettle Okay he is talking out his butt now.  He doesn’t know if he should wind his butt or scratch his watch!  Someone please give him a Valium and a bottle of Diet Coke!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Explain this article.  This is not the Southern Border.	https://t.co/3dowCEWTny
@GOP @SecNielsen Explain this news story.	https://t.co/3dowCEWTny
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @SteveDoocy https://t.co/3dowCEWTny		Can you explain this?  How many miles is Philly from Texas?
@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump We know that!  Twitter needs to do something about it!
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @seanhannity Hey Jim!  What about this report!  https://t.co/3dowCEWTny
@ericgarland Philadelphia is a LONG way from the Southern Border of the Country.
@funder I think he can barely read and comprehend the English language.
@funder Question is did Pascale pass this on to the puppet master?
@TeaPainUSA Think the tin-foil hat is on a little too tight for him.  WOW.  That is bad.
@AynRandPaulRyan Wow!  What a moron.  He really wants to have the courts to shut him down like President's before him.  Whoever is advising him needs to resign immediately.
@RogueSNRadvisor Why must the shutdown be on the backs of the Federal Workers!
@senatemajldr @SenThomTillis Spineless cowards
@PressSec @marcthiessen How is the job search going Sarah!
@ChocaholicBrit Over before it began some are saying
@AngrierWHStaff How m of want to guess he is also taking Aricept.
Midnight and hour six of migraine WITH meds on board.  Now using heat and cold compresses to knock this down.
@RealMuckmaker Brown nosing idiot
@PaulaReidCBS @brianstelter @CBS @realDonaldTrump Cowards
@realDonaldTrump Won’t be watching.
@NBCNews No
@funder I’ll be watching a movie
@tonyposnanski Trailer trash that needs to go back to the trailer park!
@yashar Did Ann come to her senses?
@SenatorCardin @realDonaldTrump While All of you point fingers and blame each other loyal federal workers are worried about rent, mortgage, car payments etc.  Someone needs to To GROW THE HELL UP and do their JOB in Congress.  Bring the Bill the House passed forward for a VOTE!  McConnell needs to grow a set!
@krassenstein It is not a minor inconvenience.  It is a MAJOR inconvenience.  Will it be a bigger matter come September of this year?  When the next spending comes up will Department of Defense not be funded?  Should those in DOD start saving NOW? This temper-tantrum is going to affect me soon
@jaketapper Is he THAT paranoid?  Notice a pattern?  People who know how government works or perceived loyal to the prior holder of the position are forced out!
@dragonflytatt2 @ThoughtsOfSAND @Stop_Trump20 That is nuts.  Makes me wonder if in 10 months my agency be battling the same thing.
@RepKarenBass I read about a federal worker make a decision between insulin and bills.  Wish I could find the story to share.
@ThoughtsOfSAND @Stop_Trump20 That is bad.  Wow!  I was deciding on catch up payments for my TSP.  I will have to wait.
@mitchellreports Someone should tag POTUS to show proof of the nightmare he started.
@SpicyFiles @StateDept Jesus H Christ on a friggin Po-Go stick.  How stupid is Sanders and company.
@ThoughtsOfSAND @Stop_Trump20 What?  Holy crap!  I thought they would let you do a TSP loan.  Wow.
@Stop_Trump20 Many are getting TSP loans to survive
@AltUSPressSec I’ve been wondering how many of these food recipients are MAGA supporters will feel the squeeze with to shutdown.
@h8Wankmaggot45 A lot. They will be the first MF to complain about taking a minimum wage job or pick crops!
@mkraju Many are running out of resources to keep the lights on borrowing against their TSP and getting another job!
@krassenstein Someone should tell him how much the Coast Guard seizes on our waters!  How many people they intercept trying to enter the country by water!
@MollyJongFast Oh lord what did I just watch?  He’s openly carrying AND drinking?
@ellievan65 @Lady_Sisyphus22 Wow. Digging that hole deeper with his response.
@AngrierWHStaff This is a lapse in funding so it is a shutdown.  Strike would infer union members voted for this.  Last I checked most of the Federal Unions do not have this ability.  Again he’s talking out his ass.
@The_UnSilent_ Those two are oxygen thieves and mouth-breathers.  Not worth any airtime
@morethanmySLE You are amazing Peter keep up the good work and keep fighting for everyone with pre-existing conditions and chronic illnesses
@RogueUSMint Right now I’m having red beans and rice!
@RogueUSMint Chicken and dumplings and my father’s corned beef gravy
@realDonaldTrump This is one thing I agree with.  Drug prices are too high
@Brianjl61 @realDonaldTrump You’ll be sober a long time then.
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to do the same thing to the borders up North!  Are you going to deal with the people who have overstayed their Visas!  People enter this county illegally from points all over the USA.  The Coast Guard seizes MORE  at our shores!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump Oh hell no!  We have dealt with hiring freezes, pay freezes, and furloughs!  We took an oath to the Constitution and support our agencies missions.  You snuck a raises for your swamp creatures in while telling us we can’t afford a lousy 2.1% raise.  Hypocrite you are POTUS
@DanDavenport16 @jmwcentralFLA @realDonaldTrump Good one Dave.
The morning has been filled with apple stealing pups, pup with no sense of personal space and the cranky old lady pup.  Managed to get a pot of red beans in the stove for playoff games!
@RogueUSMint @realDonaldTrump Has to be via picture book for comprehension by him.
@realDonaldTrump Can some one take his phone from him?
@holleyr @rh2wild @realDonaldTrump Exactly!
@matthewjdowd If she were a man would you be saying the SAME thing?  Tired of the double standards!
@AynRandPaulRyan Can someone use a pop-up picture book to explain how this works?
@realDonaldTrump What about the borders in Michigan, New York, Montana and Washington State?  Are you going to secure those too?  The men and women of the federal workforce are tired of being used as pawns in this mess.  Vital services are being curtailed.  They had a bill YOU bailed on it!
@B52Malmet There are those of us working with a budget pissed off at Pence and Cogetting pay raises.  The president said there was no room for a raise and the SOB snuck this one it.
@morethanmySLE She is so adorable,
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump Yeah I am one of those federal workers NOT getting a pay raise thanks to the orange moron
@realDonaldTrump Can someone give him a lesson on how this is collected?  It is paid by the consumer!
@cathymcmorris While Congress acts like children.  Federal workers received what could be their last paycheck for a while.  National parks are not staffed to curb vandalism and repair said damage.  Other functions are halted also.  Get it together and reopen the government ALL Parties.
@Jim_Jordan https://t.co/WCKoB5y4Ud
@VP @TuckerCarlson @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FoxNews https://t.co/vN7U5SxE0t
@TrueFactsStated The walk of shame.
@GOPLeader @SpeakerPelosi The senate passed a bill to fund the government it was PAUL RYAN who refused to bring it to the House for a vote!
@essenviews On the backs of civil servants.  This will not bode well come election time
@realDonaldTrump You are screwing over loyal civil servants for what!  Take the lower amount to hire more CBP agents and monitoring equipment!
@SpicyFiles @TPM They walk of SHAME! ROFLMAO!
@SpicyFiles @SpicyFiles how will those $$ affect Sean Spicer?  He’s technically still a Commissioned Officer in the US Navy.  Is he reporting this?
@VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Shouldn't you be talking to McConnell also.  If the House votes for a bill to reopen the government and McConnell won't bring it before the Senate for a vote it is ALL on him.  Stop holding Federal Workers Hostage.
@amandablount2 I know.
@amandablount2 It was great @amandablount2 .  First Grandchild (a girl) arrives mid-late April!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump Remember they have to use pictures in a pop-up book for him to comprehend the information.  My blind Bassett Hound could read it better than him!
@AngrierWHStaff I have some swamp land in the Sahara I'll sell you, if you think North Korea is complying.  That is some funny shit!
@realDonaldTrump Gas was still high where I live.  Put down the Diet Coke.
@counterchekist @lauriebrenner @clark85 @realDonaldTrump Also they need to fully screen those being hired.  Full background colonoscopy screening must be done.  No waivers of this
@TheRickWilson They are going to need a bigger baby bottle for his Diet Coke!
@stonecold2050 Maybe she shouldn’t LIE so much.  She can work for her daddy.
@EdKrassen Yikes!
@realDonaldTrump GEN McChrystal answered the call and served his country with honor.  You avoided service five times!
@essenviews On what planet was Trump a successful businessman!
@amandablount2 Hi Amanda how are you doing?
@JeremyLittau You’re welcome.  I use my Instapot for hard cooked eggs.  Six minutes cooked perfectly.  There is a YouTube video on how to do it!
@realDonaldTrump Yo mad Bro?
@krassenstein @FoxNews Hum...wonder if Rupert Murdock is preparing the end game for Trump.
@JeremyLittau Look up Pressure Luck on You Tube.
@waltshaub @alanap98 @realDonaldTrump Who forgot to give he baby his bottle!
@realDonaldTrump This is you first tweet of 2019!  Assign blame.
@kylegriffin1 He is a little whiny baby who needs his Diet Coke bottle and a diaper change!
@67jewelCDH The GOP needs to find a collective set of BALLS and do their JOBS!  Surely, one of the GOP members has the balls to do what is right!
@RepMarkMeadows Congress is holding Federal Workers hostage for a wall.  There are other ways to get secure borders.  This is not fair to them.  Take the damn deal and get people back to work!
@funder @realDonaldTrump Idiot!
@Merbabe71 @morpjh @funder @CBSNews @corvowine It must be something so embarrassing he is this compliant with the shit sandwich being tossed around
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/XPqvzh5kJg
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump What are they holding over your head to make you behave like this?
@realDonaldTrump Someone give him a pacifier please.
@AngrierWHStaff @DevinNunes Shocking?  I’m not they are hypocrites Nunes and his family the biggest violators behind Don Jr and Company.
@SteveScalise Ask Ryan why he didn’t want to bring the Senate bill to the House or a vote?  Senate passed a bill.
@funder @CBSNews @corvowine What are they holding over Graham’s head to make him this damn complicit
@RudyGiuliani She’s not the Speaker of the House you complicit IDIOT!  Why are you not blasting Paul Ryan!
@Stop_Trump20 @realDonaldTrump More like he needs a pacifier and a diaper change!
@realDonaldTrump Paul Ryan and the House OWNS this along with you.
@TheTweetwit Cryptkeeper
@funder No! There is actual proof Trump Businesses are cheating at the the green card/visa business!  This is getting good!  Their Asses can’t lie about this.
@SpicyFiles @TrueFactsStated @maddogpac So the whole blame Uranium One on HRC was a smoke screen for Flynn and company trying to help our enemy?
@kylegriffin1 He wants how many billions of dollars for the stupid WALL!  I am calling BS on this executive order.
@morethanmySLE Keep up the fight Peter.  Those of us battling a chronic illness feels you pain.
@realDonaldTrump Someone give him a baby bottle of Diet Coke and put him to bed.
@AdamParkhomenko He will find a way to pressure the military doctors to alter the results.
@GOP You control BOTH chambers and STILL could get it right!  Wake up
@AdamParkhomenko He’ll get someone to make it look as if he is in great health.  We know he isn’t healthy.
@SirDanielJ @SteveScalise Good god!  WTF!
@realDonaldTrump So you cancelled federal workers pay raise while the wealthy 1% got huge taxes breaks and you want money for a wall.  Also, you stil control the house, senate and WH still can’t get crap done!
@realDonaldTrump The text were saved.  You are making a mountain out of a molehill.
@treasonstickers In his mind he's the "Healthiest" President EVER!  I've seen mean his age in MUCH better shape!
@SteveScalise The Senate did not have the votes.  Look it up.
@New_Narrative @maggieNYT Can someone please change Rudy’s diaper and given him a bottle.
@funder Sounds like he needs a diaper change and burping before a nap.
@lisastark351 Maybe she is hiding her lying eyes.she is hiding her lying eyes.
@LindseyGrahamSC We will vote all of you out of off in 2020 for being childish morons
@SethAbramson Has Rudy abandoned all legal logic for money or is he also guilty as hell!
I’ve come to believe my daughter’s dog is an odd duck.  She licks the floor trying to attack shadows to barking at the oddest things.  The kicker.....she’s deaf!
@AshaRangappa_ That is too cute!
@JRubinBlogger I wouldn’t hire him at my Agency.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump While federal workers wonder if they will get a paycheck after 3 Jan.  That is they las funded paycheck!  This is not fair to civil servants.
@lauferlaw @TrueFactsStated @ericgarland @AshaRangappa_ Oh god...🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
@AynRandPaulRyan Question is which passport was he using?  Somehow these rats have multiple passports.
@KevinMKruse What don’t those mouth-breathers understand.  Non-essential is not the same in private sector.
@marcorubio You coward!  You won’t even stand up to the leaders of your own damn party.  You are a feckle spineless coward.
@funder It is sad.
@TrueFactsStated We love you Claude!  Keep up the good work!
@realDonaldTrump Ask the 5 GOP members why they didn't vote on the bill?  No one is asking that question.
@tedlieu @davidcicilline @DHSgov How about all of the above.
@SethAbramson None of us said this.  He's talking out both sides of his mouth
@SpicyFiles check out his height also.  He now says he's six feet three when his SSS Card says six feet two.  He is such a thin-skinned fickle moron.
@kylegriffin1 That is some BS.  They don't do a damn thing but make a lot of noise!
@morethanmySLE That is great news!
@TrueFactsStated From his selective service card he’s grown an inch from then to now.
Early in the morning here in Alabama and the heating pad is my new friend.  Arthritis sucks, battling a massive flare up sucks even worse
@PrincessBravato @SpicyFiles @dcpoll @kelly2277 @Delavegalaw @kylegriffin1 @CREWcrew I don’t have access from home to look.
@abbydphillip He needs to back this up with facts.
@SaysHummingbird Costing the taxpayers how much money?  I bet you he flew on a military jet.
RT @GenMhayden: Merry Christmas!  Many thanks for all the prayers and good wishes.  It’s humbling and overwhelming.  Had yesterday evening…
@GlennKesslerWP Uh no.  We would rather go to work.
@Stop_Trump20 Who wore it better.  Moron on the left or moron on the right?
@waltshaub @MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump I’m guessing violations of laws.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump There will be no contract award with a partial shutdown AND I bet it would be in violation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation if he signed one without competition
@BradMossEsq Not even close.   This is how the government ends up in massive litigation for stupidity in contract awards!
@realDonaldTrump I thought we didn’t do no bid contracts plus who is around the write it? How much you wanna bet it is overpriced and screws the government over
Oh dear lord.  I have an OCD dog who is chasing shadows!
@RedTRaccoon I’m going to go out on a limb to say yes along with the Saudis
@CREWcrew We make military leaders divest themselves of stocks and other conflicts.  He needs to do the same!
Rum cake done.  The race is on to thaw the beef for its slow roasting tomorrow
@realDonaldTrump Stop watching Fox News!
@realDonaldTrump The bill always comes due.  What did you give up for this?
@GopherGrad Everything.  That’s what.
@flyaway_k He is rich tacky trash too cheap to hire a good tailor
@realDonaldTrump Oh look he is probably using his unsecured IPhone to Tweet.
@LindseyGrahamSC Grow a set of balls and do the right thing.
@realDonaldTrump What are you 12!
@funder Con Man
@renato_mariotti Has Dersh lost his mind! He and Rudy are channeling each other.  Both men’s elevator do not go all the way to the top floor.
@TheRickWilson So he sends the Acting Chief of Staff to do his dirty work.  This administration is filled with cowards and snowflakes.
@SarahBurris @MalcolmNance How much is this costing the US taxpayers?
@PalmerReport We are royal screwed in the DOD.  I can see that now
@SpicyFiles @stevenmnuchin1 It smelly like a rat looks like a rat Mnuchin is one of the biggest rats of them all
@leahmcelrath My basset hound has more experience than the Acting SECDEF
@RogueSNRadvisor @stevenmnuchin1 I’m calling bullshit on the call.  He’s up to something and I bet you begging is involved!
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Good grief.  Clearly he doesn’t understand appropriated funding.  Not going to happen!
@PalmerReport Where does he find these people!
@RawStory He’s illiterate he heard it on tv.
@jdawsey1 @Bencjacobs What a coward?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Tired of this administration treating the federal workforce and agencies like they are nothing.  Our loyalty is to the Constitution NOT to a person.
@mkraju We have a petty man-child as President who hates people calling out his BS.
@realDonaldTrump You are petty.
@funder He is a petty man-child.
@FaceTheNation @CBSDavidMartin @realDonaldTrump How fucking petty is this man!
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS This shutdown means federal retirees may not receive their paychecks, Federal Workers no paycheck, Federal Workers having to work with NO PAY, visas are not processed, passports etc.  All because both chambers of Congress and the White House can’t get their damn act together.
@AngrierWHStaff I don’t think so, but no US bank will lend him money.
@RepMarkMeadows The Senate did not have the votes from their OWN PARTY!  There were a few Dems who voted with the GOP.  This is not on Schumer this is ALL on the GOP.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Think you forgot this is 2018 NOT 1900.
@RWPUSA Good Grief.
@RepMarkMeadows You could not get members of your OWN party to vote!
@ChuckGrassley Oh no don’t blame it on him.  You did not have enough votes from your own party
@maggieNYT He is a con man.
@TheRickWilson @ChiefCovfefe Still sitting in jail waiting for his final fate.
@GOP You control both chambers!  You had some dems vote with you.  Wake up and do a better damn job securing the votes.  You all are ADULTS start acting like it!
Never have I been so pissed about a government shutdown now my packages will not arrive on time
@senatemajldr @POTUS You control BOTH chambers of Congress and you STILL could not get your shit together and pass a bill!  Resign you turtle-head
@realDonaldTrump Dumbass
@rep_stevewomack You control BOTH chambers of Congress and the White House.  You could not work together to pass this bill.  This is on ALL of you.  Every Senator and Congresspersons.  Don’t blame one party BOTH PARTIES are at fault.  Grow up and be adults.
@kylegriffin1 @AmazingDouglass I can’t watch the clip her voice makes me want to rip my eyes out!
@peterdaou Ivanka, Betsy, Ben Carson, that lapdog Whitaker.  I have more
@CapLounge @jaketapper Love the drinks!
@JeffFlake Coward
@KatrinaPierson You dumb twit.  What rock have you been under.
@realDonaldTrump You own the shutdown.  You own this 100 percent.  Good Faithful Civil Servants are being treated like crap because of childish behaviors of our elected leaders.  Our elected leaders need to GROW THE HELL UP! Stop behaving like toddlers!
Going to finish my beer and relax.
@LindseyGrahamSC So NOW you're showing a damn spine!  It takes Mattis resigning to show you're not the biggest paid off TOOL!  To you damn job and fix this dumpster fire you and the rest of Congress CREATED!
@marcorubio Do your damn job as a Senator and stop this train wreck.  Or are you a complicit moron!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Brian....you know it has to be in the form of pictures for him to understand
@SpeakerRyan You have a legacy of being a coward and a "Yes-Man".
@kathygriffin @FLOTUS We all know she married the Don to get a green card.  Then used it to bring her parents to the USA for their green card.  All of them are grifters.
@nibrtv2 @TrueFactsStated Think he picked up that spray on hair crap!
@realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum @RodBlagojevich @trishregan Bitch, Whine, Moan, Complaing is the common theme
@realDonaldTrump Common theme.  Bitch, Whine, Moan and Complain.  Like a bad scene from Groundhog Day!
@SpicyFiles @MickMulvaneyOMB @realDonaldTrump He hires only the “Best” attorneys.   More like Attorneys who are one step from being disbarred!  I’m loving this.  This is so priceless!
@realDonaldTrump They had a damn warrant!
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Who hired Rudy, who married his cousin and like his client married multiple times AND had multiple affairs!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @EdKrassen they would have to turn the report into a picture book.  That would be the only way he could understand the report.
@ThisWeekABC Why are you giving him any airtime to spew his nonsense!
@MSNBC @MalcolmNance Like her own step children!
@Newsweek I’m betting overpriced rooms and spaces to line their pockets.
@TrueFactsStated You didn’t lose me.  We love you
@nathan_nye Hey isn’t that @GovWalker the same person who signed a bill to strip the new Governor of power!  The same Scott Walker who is a giant pouty loser!  Wonder if Mueller has all the receipts!
@KatrinaPierson Deflection once again.  SQUIRREL 🐿
@KellyannePolls @MickMulvaneyOMB @POTUS @WhiteHouse Are you sure it was your “volun-told”?
@ScottWalker Should have ordered the crow.
@lisamurkowski @Interior @SecretaryZinke Damn autocorrect Zinke that should be.
@Lady_Sisyphus22 @politico @SpeakerRyan Does that make Ted Cruz Grandpa Munster!
@lisamurkowski @Interior @SecretaryZinke What damn universe is she in.  Zinger was all about himself!
@ChuckGrassley It means I could be denied vital coverage for my pre existing conditions you egghead!
@Goss30Goss How many of those idiots have a pre-existing condition.  Oh wait they use the same healthcare as the military!  They don’t have to worry about being denied coverage!  They (Congress) should have to purchase their healthcare like the rest of the USA!
@SaysHummingbird I wonder how many in the GOP will be indicated.  The rats will get trapped when this goes down.
@PhilipRucker @eilperin @jdawsey1 He had issues on active duty of unethical behaviors
@LisPower1 @SRuhle When he too is indicted to save his own shell!
@parscale @realDonaldTrump Why must they find every reason to deflect the truth with lies!
@RudyGiuliani The text were recovered you moron
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump He barely can read!  They didn’t make a picture box for him to understand the materials!
@CREWcrew I really don't understand the logic.  Every damn year me and my spouse write a check to the IRS.  We both withhold the maximum from our paychecks.  Those two idiots (Ivanka and Jared) get away with paying little to no tax OR somehow get money back!  WTF!
@realDonaldTrump The money was seized by the USA!
@TrueFactsStated Claude is one clever man.
@MollyJongFast Looks like I'll need to buy a lot of bottled water thanks to the EPA morons.
@MollyJongFast Don't forget nose.  That nose has been altered!
@Amy_Siskind No one wants to be on the crazy train!
@AltNatSecAgency Who forgot to give grandpa his Valium!
@realDonaldTrump Why do you talk in the 3rd person persona?
@DearAuntCrabby Damn those Trolls.  Welcome back Auntie!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Why is Jared and Ivanka employed there?  Neither are qualified to walk a dog!
@jfreewright My bassett hound could have done a better job and she's BLIND!!!
I cast my Heisman ballot for #TuaTagovailoa! Click the player you think deserves the Heisman House vote. (📍@NissanUSA)
@realDonaldTrump Grow the hell up!  You're not in elementary school.  God you're a thin-skinned child.
@RudyGiuliani Ask for a refund from your law school and state bar.  It's clear yo are not providing sound legal advice!
@realDonaldTrump What in the bloody HELL!
@realDonaldTrump Did you forget to read your pop-up book at Breakfast.  It would help you understand the law.
@SpicyFiles @USATODAY Adult supervision?   You mean zoo keeper?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Grandpa didn’t read his pop-up book of facts at breakfast.
@RudyGiuliani Rudy turn off your phone you’re acting like a village idiot!  Mueller has all the cards and is going to call your bluff
@ScottWalker Your legacy will be remembered as a thin skin petty man over losing an election
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera Then shut up and let the report come out to vindicate you.  You behave as if you have something hide
@realDonaldTrump What planet on you on!
@RepMattGaetz Do shut up you are not needed
@AngrierWHStaff Will members of the GOP go to prison?
@RepMattGaetz @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Why are you discussing a closed door session.  Shut up and go away.
@realDonaldTrump Are you this childish and fickle?  What are you 5!
@krassenstein I’m sorry if my husband had an affair there will be war!
@CREWcrew She is an unqualified handbag designer stealer!
@Wojadubakowske @nadabakos Frustrating to know this is very true.
@nadabakos Flynn is now a felon, what will the Army do with this new information.  Will he stay a retired a Lieutenant General or be demoted like the Retired Air For e General.  Interesting times.
@altNOAA Looks like a petulant man-child throwing a silent tantrum.
@AynRandPaulRyan Function illiterate I believe
@yogajuliette @tamara_muyskens @mmpadellan He declared in 2016 he was the healthiest presidential candidate!  He got a One Star Admiral to sugar coat hi medical examine!  What is he hiding!  That he is actually very ill!
@funder The Orange 🤡🐒
@girlsreallyrule @AdamParkhomenko I love Dick Cheney glaring at the orange one.
@Goss30Goss @DNCpeep Oh they are they are looking at him very closely.
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump Oh I am loving Dick Cheney’s meancing Stare!  Waiting for someone to give him the dreaded side eye of disgust
@kylegriffin1 God he can be a petty baby.
@RepMattGaetz Do shut up you moron.
@TeaPainUSA Oh I think things are afoot.  Interesting to see what is behind Door #1.
@RudyGiuliani Stop you whining.   How about we call you a Wambulance!  What some cheese with that Whine!
@AngrierWHStaff Some one post the damn document!  Don’t keep us in suspense!
@DavidNakamura But he’s the healthiest President ever!  That’s what his quack of a doctor said in 2016!
@RandPaul Maybe because they think you will leak the information.
@CREWcrew I am tired of the double standards. Normal Federal Workers are terminated for these violations. Other administrations terminated people who behaved like them.This is more than the Hatch Act Violations.  Tired of the lying on financial disclosure forms and SF-86 form.
@MillenPolitics Oh dear Lord!  Did they not think about placing a "SIGN HERE" tab on the agreement! Grandpa needs his memory pills!
@Brian_Riedl I have concerns about her.
@TIME Bernie needs to stop.  We don’t need him.
@ProudResister Abuse of power too.
@EPAAWheeler Fraud and sell-out!
@RudyGiuliani Oh god!  Go back to law school!
@ChiefCovfefe @SpicyFiles What is wrong with these people!  Kremlin Barbie and her Toad Jared need to go to jail!
@itsJeffTiedrich Love it!  Fucktangle and shitweasels!
@dzalcman Biweekly premiums are upwards of 600 for some families!
@AshaRangappa_ His finances alone would be suspect!
@maddogpac @wickedlilmis Someone forgot to tell Grandpa to count to 10 Mississippi’s
@ChocaholicBrit Grandpa let brain in his tacky luggage!
@h0n3y_73 God He (Mulvaney) is a F**king Moron!
@jonallendc He lost the house majority.
@realDonaldTrump Isn’t it past your bedtime!
@JustClaudia3 And screw me out of a 1.9% pay Raise!  Greedy bastards!
@UROCKlive1 Good lord what fresh he’ll is this now!
@CREWcrew Normal Feds are suspended or FIRED!  They are a rolling Ethics and Hatch Act Violation with no consequences!
@waltshaub I don't understand this at all.  Normal Federal Workers are disciplined for this.  These morons all 10 plus need the same punishment.  Lacks teeth if you don't discipline them.
@RogueUSMint I'll provide Paralegal support!
@RogueUSMint Oh snap.  Shit just got real!  You have my support!
@realDonaldTrump Really?  Tell that to the factory my daughter works at!  They just gave her notice of a three week layoff because of the tariffs!
@ReneeLibby2 On YouTube look up F*ck You by CeeLo Green.
@frankthorp @JasonMillerinDC @SenShelby At what cost?
@TrueFactsStated Like a bad scene from the Shining!
@CahnEmily Hello Danny!  Come play with us!
@realDonaldTrump Who gave him back his unsecured phone!  Some put him in time out.
I cast my Heisman ballot for #TuaTagovailoa! Click the player you think deserves the Heisman House vote. (📍@NissanUSA)
@DearAuntCrabby Where ever he builds it, it will be a tacky decorated monstrosity!
@BarneysNose He bashes immigrants but turns around hires immigrants at his hotels, winery and Mar-A-Largo.  Not to mention I bet immigrants cut grass at his golf courses TOO.  HYPOCRITE he is.  He only likes immigrants if they work at his properties.
@MollyJongFast Trouble in paradise for Barbie and Ken?
@ReneeLibby2 Grandpa is off his meds again.
@SpicyFiles @jimsciutto @CNN Good grief, has he been reading the Nixon playbook of stupid shit to do!  One White House and it's in DC.  That monstrosity in Florida is a an over-paid tacky club.
@DearAuntCrabby He wants to shut the government down for not getting money for his wall. Many of us lived the 2013 nightmare of a shutdown. We sat at home for 10 days wondering if we would get back-pay and when we would return. I will leave early pension be damned if this crap continues.
@JohnWDean When will the GOP stand up and deal with this!  What does he have on them to make them so complicit in their inaction!  The GOP needs to grow a spine and set of BALLS to put an end to this train wreck dumpster fire administration.
@thehill How much is this little trip to the privately owned country club costing the taxpayers?  How much is this lining the pockets of the family?  A LOT!  The GOP is filled with a bunch of HYPOCRITES!
@kylegriffin1 Good grief what in the hell is going in!  Is this the Twilight Zone!
@realDonaldTrump Grandpa is up from his nap!  Who gave him his unsecured phone
@EndDeportations Complicit
@TrueFactsStated Yeah my daughter who works for Polaris is looking a December being out of work because of the tariffs
@JoanieVee1 @SpicyFiles @jedshug LOL....I'm being nice.  Whitaker and company get away with lying and Federal Workers are fired.  Same standard for all of them.
@SpicyFiles @jedshug Again....Normal DOJ and Federal Workers would be fired and hauled to prison for lying.  WHY do they keep using a different standard for these morons!  I hate double standards!
@krassenstein Normal Federal workers are fired but NOT others like Ivanka who get a PASS.  WTF!
@GlennKesslerWP How about not showing up at all.  He likes big numbers and crowds.  Don't bother to show up.
@CREWcrew He has something.   This is not right.
@WestWingReport Oh Dear Lord.  So glad my daughter does not have cable or internet.  Also, cell phone reception is spotty too.
@SassyKadiK Welcome to my world.  I feel for you.  Sending you hugs.
@TrueFactsStated I’ve never seen raccoon eyes like that.
@IvankaTrump But her emails!!!  Hypocrite
@SpicyFiles @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Kremlin Barbie needs to sit her ass jail.  She is complicit in her actions and a hypocrite.  Her Frog Prince Jared needs to be in jail too.
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MattWhitaker46 @HouseDemocrats @OversightDems @RepMaxineWaters @AdamSchiff @SenateDems Normal feds don’t get a damn clearance.  If I were a fed denied a clearance I would appeal citing all those morons granted a clearance defaulting on Millions of dollars in loans.  Tired of the double freaking standards.  Oh normal feds with foreign contacts get extra reviews
@realDonaldTrump Spell check!
@wvwscienceguy @TrueFactsStated This is not Gilead!  Pence and his fellow morons are hypocrites
@TrueFactsStated The money that he cut out of the budget FOR forest management!  Wow...that man is a moron!
@DrDenaGrayson @CNN I’m calling BS.  He knew it .
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Will be watching NFL games instead!
@traciemac_Bmore Was he dropped on his head as a child.  He has to be the stupidest of the kids.  The only smart ones are the two youngest
@AynRandPaulRyan Think he forget to take his meds.
WTF?		https://t.co/4KnjVixEqE
@waltshaub I spent hours combing through reports compiling it for disclosure to OGE.  Going back getting clarification.  They need to release Whitaker’s disclosures.  What is they hiding!
@DearAuntCrabby @highbrow_nobrow 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That is some funny SHIT!  Franklin Graham is full of it!
@stonecold2050 She needs to get a better plastic surgeon who doesn’t make her look so fake and stretched.
I cast my Heisman ballot for #TuaTagovailoa! Click the player you think deserves the Heisman House vote. (📍@NissanUSA)
@realDonaldTrump I bet that hurt when you had to call him.  Stop lying.
@marcorubio Judas!
@renato_mariotti Think he forgot the memo.  He knows Mueller has all the receipts
@TrueFactsStated I need a drink!
@truthtalk4once @FS_UA_GA @GOPLeader Alright.  Everyone calm down.  Enough.  Shake hands and agree to disagree.  Don't need a fifty tweet post on this.
@truthtalk4once @FS_UA_GA @GOPLeader I think that is what is being suggested.  Means more unemployment for those being displaced by privatization.  Many who are veterans
@NYDailyNews Good grief.  The area needs ALL the firefighters they can spare.  Several other celebrities have lost their homes too.
@GOPLeader You took an oath to support and defend the CONSTITUTION.  You did not take an oath of loyalty to your donors.  The country comes first
@IvankaTrump These people and first responders need support with donations.  I don’t see you asking for donations or helping to find them housing.
@realDonaldTrump You need to provide PROOF this is happening!
@realDonaldTrump What happened to all votes be counted or is that ONLY when you are winning!
@AltNatSecAgency @realDonaldTrump Tariffs are the reason my daughter will be laid off for the entire month of DECEMBER!  The company she works for is trying to do their best to ensure they get some pay.
@ETNNash @Everything_TN 😹😹😹😹😹😹
@maggieNYT There is no freaking First Daughter title.  Ivanka needs to go back to selling her lifted designer purses!
@AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump It's because they probably won't allow golf carts on the hollowed grounds to transport his lazy ass!
@AngrierWHStaff He would have had to WALK from the vehicle to the site.  They would need a golf cart to transport him. He's that lazy.  There is no way in hell he is 239.
@WestWingReport So he gets in his motorcade and is driven to the site.  What a lazy orange baby.
@joncoopertweets I'll believe it when i see the perp walk and mug shot!
@PressSec Stop doctoring videos!  You consistently lie
@PressSec Moron and liar.
@SenatorCardin @POTUS You had the chance to do this and you rolled over showing your belly.  Actions not words.
@elianayjohnson @maggieNYT Does that mean Kelly will resign?
@MSNBC What is MSNBC doing to support Jim?
@PressSec Coward you tater-tot!
@PressSec Liar liar pants on fire
@SenAlexander Why didn't you pass legislation to protect Mueller.  You and the others in the Senate are a bunch of spineless cowards!  Country before Party all the time.
@TeaPainUSA Whitaker will probably do the WH's bidding.  McConnell and company didn't have the BALLS to protect Mueller. McConnell was too busy kissing everyones ass.   We all know Bobby (Three Sticks) Mueller has a contingency plan for this occasion.
@LindseyGrahamSC Coward.
@oliverdarcy @LauraAJarrett So he didn't have the balls to call Sessions himself.  He had the Chief of Staff do his dirty work?  JFC!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump We are screwed.
@WestWingReport Which aide is making the McDonald’s run!
@DearAuntCrabby @ida_skibenes Have a glass of Bourbon on me Auntie.  I’m trying not to raid the box of cookies in the pantry!
@AngrierWHStaff @waltshaub I live in North Alabama longest part was finding a parking space!  My city is considered more Tennessee than Alabama!
@ChocaholicBrit Have Lunesta would have to FedEx it
@TeaPainUSA Wonder when Rybolovlev will be on a plane for the US to answer to his actions!
@SpicyFiles Karma is a BITCH!  He needs to recuse himself from this crap.
@ShawleyCoker Duke v Kentucky...better option.
@maggieNYT Did he fill it out correctly?  That seems to be a problem for the family.
@CLewandowski_ @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Going to be watching Football and sleep afterwards.  Gaslight much!
@ddale8 That’s it?  That was a quick rally.  Does he need to fly home to rest?  Thought he had the stamina of a man half his age!  Hopeful someone hid his phones.
@IvankaTrump @KellyannePolls @WSJ I did not benefit from this tax reform.  I am paying more in taxes with less take home pay.  I already withhold at the max and STILL pay!  Not to mentioning my healthcare premiums have increased along with my retirement withholding.
@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Gaslight much!
@ddale8 Maybe he’ll be too tired to tweet from one of his three unsecure IPhones!
@SpicyFiles When do you sleep Spicy!  How many keyboards and monitors have you used for research!
@DrDenaGrayson @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain I think they have some dirt on the good senator to make him some damn complicit!
@senorrinhatch I didn’t see an increase in my pay.  You raised by taxes with the Tax Bill.
@marinafang Aka foot in mouth disease
@PalmerReport Wondering if Nunez was dropped too much as a child.
@JoyAnnReid McConnell himself has a pre-existing medical condition.  If I remember he had Polio as a child. If he didn’t have the same insurance as the military his ass would be paying more.  He is a hypocrite and coward.
@Stonekettle It’s 5 O’clock somewhere.  Enjoy.
@MingGao26 God yes I remember.  I sat at home furious wondering when I would go back to work.
@marcorubio History will remember you as a complicit coward
@DrDenaGrayson These morons have to be the Worlds Worst Criminals! Many of them have college degrees AND Law degrees!
@SpicyFiles @911CORLEBRA777 @JonNiola Get well soon
@tparti @maggieNYT Who?  Tucker?  God what a moron
@DearAuntCrabby I think I’m going to be sick.
@realDonaldTrump That means your properties will lose money because rich pregnant foreign ladies won’t be able to have their anchor babies!
@realDonaldTrump Prove it!
@ScottMStedman Good grief!
@SenatorMenendez You know he'll create a loop-hole for Russian Women who come to America to have their babies.
@HoarseWisperer Now all those Russian women won't be able to come to his properties and have their babies who will be US Citizens.  We'll see how long it last when it affects his bottom line financially.
@AngrierWHStaff Someone should explain to POTUS his properties are being used by women to have their children.
@LindseyGrahamSC Explain this too	https://t.co/Kno9dAYnj8
@LindseyGrahamSC How about this story.	https://t.co/L6zhC04aSL
@LindseyGrahamSC Explain this little article.	https://t.co/Dt9BrUQuGS
@MollyJongFast Oh god....my eyes!
@realDonaldTrump Liar liar pants on fire!
@RepMattGaetz @HouseGOP Explain how my tax bracket didn’t decrease!  I saw a paultry increase while insurance premiums increased.  God you are tone deaf
@passantino @maggieNYT The only sane person left there
@ALT_uscis @PressSec @GovMikeHuckabee That nose has to be halfway to Kansas by now!
@WestWingReport I’m surprised her nose isn’t three feet long from the lying!
@realDonaldTrump Most of your followers are BOTS!  That is why they have been removed
@amandablount2 iPhones and androids makes my life a living hell for issuing them!
@MikeLevinCA Almonds from California too.  I love avocado toast.  SO good with a sprinkling of salt and pepper!
@ddale8 These tariff's are affecting my family.  My daughter who works for Polaris was just told she will not be working OR have a paycheck for the month of December.  The reason!  The tariff's on goods and materials! This affects real families when businesses have to scale back!
@SpicyFiles You read my mind Spicy.  Headed to a Blood Pressure break myself soon.
@RealMuckmaker @ItsMeCathi https://t.co/cpndI76ISm
@realDonaldTrump You control the House, Senate AND WH.  What is the real issue?  Is it other GOP members do not buy the BS?  Read the Constitution
@realDonaldTrump You hold both chambers of Congress AND the WH.  Maybe the reason is your OWN party?
@realDonaldTrump If you have time to travel and campaign, then you have time to visit the troops in Afghanistan.
@CREWcrew This is ridiculous!  Too busy to see the troops in Afghanistan while once again heads to the golf course OR some campaign rally!  Hypocrite.
@DogginTrump https://t.co/uMSV0V1nZk
@SenKamalaHarris Last time I checked I pay into Social Security and Medicare!  That was the offset of me being in the newer pension program.  Pay INTO Social Security for a lower retirement payment from my employer.  Congress fix this mess you all have caused.  Stop messing with my paycheck!
@Stonekettle Still down in Alabama
@SenJackReed Well think you need to have a discussion the Senator McConnell on this. He is thinking SSI (Disability) NOT Social Security (Retirement).
@ChocaholicBrit @60Minutes Not this person.  Trying to beat this cold before going on vacation in one week!
@Amy_Siskind I’m watching the Kansas City game while nursing a cold
@realDonaldTrump Watching the Patriots and Chiefs game tonight.
@jordanwfisher_ @Sannbailey Many of us have asked the same question.  It isn’t on his financial disclosures.
@LouiseMensch @GeorgePapa19 Wow.  Is this guy really this stupid!
@ForrestBennett @Jandelliott More needs to be done.  More needs to be done to make medications affordable.
@CatintheHome @JackMCarey1 @FrankCiancanel1 @tedlieu Very true.
@EricLiptonNYT Did anyone receive ANY briefing on what Hatch Act exactly is and how it applies to them? Maybe someone should send them to the link to the US Code on the subject.  Their Ethics Attorney is a moron!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner That just just make me mad.  Every damn year me and my husband write a damn check to the IRS for taxes.  We withhold the maximum and still owe!  Frog Prince Jared and his Kremlin Barbie get away with paying little to no tax!  WTF!!!
@JackMCarey1 @tedlieu Exactly.  Thank you
@TrueFactsStated Maybe we should find Kanye's Gold Digger Video and post it.
@bingybingyfoo @fawfulfan Sad part is what happened to have that many of the siblings campaign against him?
@fawfulfan Yep. One n the same!
@fawfulfan Forgot the Congressman who had all 6 of his siblings campaign AGAINST him.
@tedlieu I am tired of the nepotism, Hatch Act Violations and numerous Ethics Violations. This sends a message of double standards from the WH.  The Federal Workforce complies with the rules. Federal Workers are punished for violating these rules while people like Jared walk unpunished
@NormEisen @CREWcrew The sad part is normal Federal Workers are terminated for violating the Hatch Act while Mrs. Sanders is allowed to continue this behavior unchecked by the administration.  She's not exempt and needs to be held accountable like the rest of the Federal Workforce!
@SenatorCollins That will be great once the cost goes down for the medications.  Some can't afford 500 for one medication.
@ericgarland Wait....What did I miss?  Kremlin Barbie is dirtier than a pig in poo?
@ChocaholicBrit @Twitter I know.  We’ll see why shakes out with the latest purge.
@ChocaholicBrit @Twitter Lost a few here
@RepAdamSchiff How about you and the rest of the DEMS get you act together.  You are falling for their traps.  Focus on the facts and truth.  Stop going too far down the rabbit holes.
@JasonHalle Also who got to the Senator from WVA for his vote.
3.  This is the one time I truly dislike battling Military Treatment Facilities and Tricare! end
2.  I am required to mail in the receipts to be reimbursed the Co-Pay. Why? The MTF refused to fill the prescription because the MTF's form was not used! Then put this crap on your WEBSITE!  This medication is expensive there is NO GENERIC option.  Come on get your crap together!
1. I dislike red tape for prescription medication. Why do I need not 1 but 2 prior authorizations for eye drops. Why can't the prescription provider communicate with the Military Treatment Facility to say,"Medication has Prior Authorization on file please order! OH NO too Simple!
@Ashley_MeKell @HillReporter Exactly!
@WestWingReport I know.  I shake my head at the silence on the subject.  Is it Five O'Clock somewhere because the frustration is building.
@SenBobCorker @washingtonpost More needs to be done to find out what happened to him.
@ellievan65 WTF did I just see?  Are these people really walking around America?  They ACTUALLY graduated from high school and college!
@dtxErgaOmnes really....WOW!  I had a Ted Cruz supporter tell me I work for him!
@joanwalsh I had a few on my page.  I did a short lock-down to filter requests.
@HillReporter Should have been investigating while the nomination hearing was happening.  You ALL dropped the ball on this one.  Congress failed to get their crap together.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BobCorker @BenCardinforMD So now you are concerned! Glad you decided to crawl out of your hole to give a shit.
@Sannbailey Thanks.  Had to lock down my account temporarily to keep a little more control of things.
The reason for posting this reminder is there are people who sit on the sidelines and never vote.  People need to be reminded to get out and vote!
Thanks for the retweet @Sannbailey.  Had a few problem children who dared to say I was a hypocrite.  Think they were trolling.
https://t.co/xnMd0pOsc0
This is pinned to remind people if you want change you have to VOTE.  You can’t sit on the sidelines and hope for the best.  I am fairly tolerant but now not so much.  I do not like to block but I will if needed.
@Stop_Trump20 I can see your tweet.
@SenatorCollins Hypocrite
@SteveScalise How about you all stop acting like spoiled brats work together and fix this mess!
@SteveKingIA Welcome to Gilead.
@WestWingReport Try living with someone who has been drinking the Orange-Kool Aid!  I'm sitting at my computer angry with them.
@MollyJongFast I'm so sick and tired of these moronic GOP Congressmen and Senators thinking they know what is best for women.  We will not be silenced.
I hate Twitter trolls!
RT @lillwild1: This is my daughter Amy. She was sexually assaulted at 5. I did the right thing. She was questioned w/o me. A colposcope exa…
@KellyannePolls Welcome to Gilead.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Welcome to Gilead.  Moron.
@KatrinaPierson Under his eye.  May the Lord open.  Welcome to Gilead.
Good Night my Twitter Family.  Need to get some sleep before a day of football.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Your own party wants to do that.  NOT The Democrats.
@SpicyFiles @OversightDems @HouseDemocrats OH!!! If he had a security clearance that shit would have been under review. This whole think stinks like a dead fish left in the sun for MONTHS!
@SpicyFiles @OversightDems @HouseDemocrats He is dirtier than a pig in shit!  How in the hell did his financial disclosure pass the ethics official.  I know my ethics official would have been asking ALL kinds of questions.  It's not looking like a duck or quacking like a duck. It's sounding and smelling like a rat!
@LindseyGrahamSC The women of the United States will speak in November when we vote.  We will vote you and the others out of office.  You are a disgrace to the institution of Congress.
@amandablount2 We will speak in November when we vote. Without a woman their dumbasses would not have been born.  My mind is going to a scene in Diary of a Mad Black Woman.  The scene where the scorned woman burned a her husband's car, clothes and got her groove back!
@HuffPost I've raised two sons.  They were raised to respect people.  They knew your commit a crime.  They will be staying there and we will not be kind if they are released.  I am thankful my sons have never been arrested.
@AriFleischer Your words are why we don't report. Your shaming is why we don't report. Calling us liars is why we don't report. We live with the assault for decades in silence because of your words. How about you shut up and listen to these victims! This is someones daughter, wife or mother!
@WestWingReport Jeff Sessions job?
@ChuckGrassley https://t.co/VcEl8UczxK
@SenWhitehouse If he was interviewing for a job where I work and behaved like that.  He would never be hired or granted a security clearance. Congress as a whole FAILED the United States.
@SenJohnHoeven You voted to silence women.  You voted to roll back Pre-existing conditions.  You voted to overturn Roe v Wade.  You are a hypocrite paid by corporate donors and lobbyist to do THEIR bidding.  Coward and Fraud!
@rebeccaballhaus Happy?  Happy they confirmed a man with serious financial flags AND misconduct!  What we witnessed was a group of people in Congress who put PARTY before COUNTRY!
@RepAndreCarson BULLCRAP.  He sided with Corporate every time!
@seanspicer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Shut up Judas.  You took an oath to defend the Constitution.  Remember that.  Can’t believe you are a Naval Officer.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Idiot.
@TeaPainUSA Tea Pain we need some good news from Team Mueller.  I’m going to exhaust my wine collection with this shit
@ChocaholicBrit LOL.  I had a cupcake wine is still chilling.
@NancyPelosi @SenateGOP You and a complicit idiot too
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Under his eye.  You morons are creating a Gilead.  Just resign!
@marcorubio Coward! https://t.co/iOTskqFbno
@LindseyGrahamSC Tater-tot Judas.  Was it worth the 30 Pieces of Silver!  Was it worth telling women you don’t give a damn.  You are the worst human being on the planet.  We will vote for change in November.  This GOP voter is done with the stupidity and cowardice you and the others are doing
@ChocaholicBrit It’s Five O’clock somewhere time to have wine!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Liar liar pants on fire.
@senatemajldr Coward
@RepBillJohnson Dumbass.
@MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins when you revealed yourself in this matter you gave them the keys to confirm him.  Just stop with the Ambulance Chasing.
Okay taking a break before I end up in Twitter time-out.
@LindseyGrahamSC Screw you and resign.
@SenSanders Shut up.  You are part of the problem you moron.
@RepMarthaRoby I hope you get voted out.  You are a coward!
@SenDeanHeller Benedict Arnold.
@newtgingrich Shut up.  You idiot
@lisamurkowski Liar!
@ChuckGrassley Just retire.
@SenAlexander Screw you.  You complicit Benedict Arnold.  You just made women second class citizens.
@sendavidperdue No he won’t.  You know he lied about his finances and his conduct.  November we will vote for change.  You coward and complicit hypocrite
@SenatorBurr You essentially told victims of sexual assaults they are liars.  Shame on you and Congress.  We will vote your ass out of office next month.  JUDAS!
@GOPLeader We will vote for change in November.  We will vote for people NOT paid for my corporate donors and lobbyist or dark money.  Coward.  You just told victims of sexual assault you don’t give a damn!
@JimInhofe We will vote for change too.
@amyklobuchar Yep we are going to vote a lot of complicit members of Congress out.
@senatemajldr Shut up you spineless, complicit turtlehead.  You made it clear you serve corporate donors, lobbyist and yourself.  You do not serve the people of Kentucky.
@Amy_Siskind You know he won't do a damn thing about it.  He will sit on these complaints.  They are all complicit morons in their inaction to investigate the allegations.  His finances alone are suspect.
@AnnGerhart So in other words.  Not a damn thing will be done to him.
Naptime!  Roll Tide!
@senorrinhatch You were elected to serve the people NOT special interest, not corporate donors and not lobbyist.  You are a complicit, spineless coward.  You have betrayed the people of the United States.  I'm glad you are retiring.  I hope Utah votes a better person to replace you.
@KatrinaPierson Good god.  What the hell is going on!
@bestifusedby55 @amandablount2 @ericgarland I'm hanging on till minimum retirement age and will leave.  I am tired of being vilified by Congress when I'm doing the work of TWO people in addition to my own job.  NOW they want do not give us a 1.9% pay raise with rising premiums?  We are pissed with Congress and the WH.
It’s going down.  Cupcake and football! https://t.co/36t1KjUg9n
@amandablount2 I'm going to eat a cupcake from small cakes, watch Alabama Football and maybe play some Command and Conquer.  Trying not to let the Keystone Cop Senate ruin my holiday weekend.
@bestifusedby55 @amandablount2 @ericgarland As someone who helps manage an Ethics Program.  I would be sitting in my Ethic's Attorney's Office with this stuff highlighted.  I don't get it!
@nytimes He would be trailer trash in other parts of the United States.
@mkraju Maybe they should have focused on the money questions.  Who paid off all that credit card debt.  How he afforded those expensive initial membership fees.  Why there is no record of the credit card payment, loan etc!
@amandablount2 Time to start looking at her donor list.  Makes me wonder who has been donating to the good Senator to make her vote yes.
@tedcruz The head of the agency I worked at stood in the lobby shook everyone's hand telling us "I'm sorry this is happening to you. We are working to get you back to work." He looked as if he had not slept. You got paid during that shutdown We didn't! We did get paid after the shutdown!
@marcorubio It was hampered by the WH meddling.  They did not interview EVERYONE.  You are a liar and complicit JUDAS.  I hope it was worth those thirty pieces of silver.  November we will vote to flip Congress.  We will have people your work FOR the people and not for Donors!
@tedcruz Be quiet you complicit, corporate politician!  You only serve your donors NOT the people of Texas!  I remember when you caused the Federal Government down in 2013 with your behavior. You showed your true colors. Texas has a large Federal Workforce population. We will vote you out
@911CORLEBRA777 @thespybrief It will come out someone paid off the debt for something in return.  How in the hell do they find these flawed nominees?  This goes for Congress.  Something is smelling more and more like a rat.
@AynRandPaulRyan I wonder if she was FORCED to make that statement!  God I need a drink and it's not even NOON.
@MichaelAvenatti Good grief.  The issue is you sound like a bad episode of "Better Call Saul" and the Personal Injury Attorney Commercials.  Less is more Michael.
@GOP Time to vote you ALL out of office in November for being complicit morons.  We will this November for change.
@CREWcrew They will go after little fish who owe a small amount but NEVER some of the bigger fish.
Really!  He wants to go with that line of BULLSHIT!  How about no woman with a soul would work for his backwards thinking dumbass!	https://t.co/vgZrRdobaW
@SenatorCollins You literally just told women on the Senate Floor, we don't mean a thing. You just told victims of sexual assault you don't care.  You are a hypocrite.  You talk about being a champion for women but you are a coward.  Shame on you.  How much did you get for betraying the country.
@KatrinaPierson Fear is what keeps these victims from reporting.  Shame is what keeps these victims from reporting.  What victims don't need is people shaming them. More needs to be done. You are not helping the matter.  When these are reported they must be investigate! You are a hypocrite!
@SpicyFiles He lied on his financial disclosures and to Congress. The GOP is so damn complicit to see the other serious red flags. If he was a normal GOVT worker and this came up, Kavanaugh would be out of a job and prosecuted! I hate double standards this is a shining example of it
@SenateGOP No you will turn this nation into an episode of The Handmaid's Tale.  You will make it that women are second class citizens.  You don't give a damn about women only which donors will give you the most money for their agenda.  You lost this GOP Voter.
@LindseyGrahamSC @Mediaite Judas.  Betrayed the country for thirty pieces of silver.
@KellyannePolls @CNN @realDonaldTrump You say you understand but behave like you don't believe them. You are complicit in your behavior and inaction. You and others are WHY we do not report these crimes. You and others are the reason WHY we are fearful.  You are part of the problem not the solution to fix it!
@FranTownsend @DavidCornDC @FBI They did not want the truth to come out.  They were hell-bent on confirming a highly flawed nominee.  This is a slap in the face of Govt workers with background checks and security clearances of double standards!
@senorrinhatch Complicit coward.
@SenatorCollins You are a disgrace.  You should be voted out of office.  You threw victims of sexual assault to the curb for your own power.  Never have I seen so much disgraceful behavior.  Resign!
@senatemajldr Liar, Liar pants on fire.  Owned by the highest donor and dirty money!
@senorrinhatch You refused to have anything done!
@ChuckGrassley Under the cover of darkness you will bury the truth of a sham investigation. ShMe on you.  You are a coward
@MSNBC How about raise your sons to respect all people.
@naretevduorp @GOP On no not all of use GOP women want him.
@senatemajldr We have watched your behavior.  You are a complicit and compromised man. Shame on you for ignoring the facts.
@senatemajldr Why the rush!  What are you rushing what are you hiding.
@missc0nstrued I have Verizon and I received the message.
@senatemajldr Oh be quiet you Turtle Head!  You SAT on Garland's nomination.  You boasted proudly you obstructed the last President!  You are a complicit, donor paid for lapdog and a douchebag!  Just resign!
@LindseyGrahamSC Wow....What kind of dirt do they have on you? You have completely sold you damn soul to the devil.  If someone is putting you up to this it's okay to tell the FBI.
@ColMorrisDavis It is hard.  My fur-baby Hickory has been gone almost three years, while we adopted a new fur-baby to join the family, I still miss him.  Raven in many ways is reincarnation of Hickory in Labrador form.  I miss him but remember all the great stories I would post and photos.
@senorrinhatch What did they find in your emails to make you this complicit in your behavior.
@DonaldJTrumpJr How about you spend more time with your children.  Your children needs you more than Twitter.
@LindseyGrahamSC Oh dear lord.  How complicit are you?  How can you not see the flags with this nominee!
@tedcruz You moron.  I have not received ANY benefit from this Tax Bill.  You're freezing my pay while my healthcare premiums rise.  I hope you get voted out in 30 days.  You are a boil on the backside of society!
@DoreenRudolph3 This is what worries me if I have to make the transition from oral medication to insulin.  Will my insurance start telling me which ones they will cover and which ones they won't.  I was just told I have to show poor control to be approved for a Continuous Glucose Monitor!
@funder Here is more from CNN		https://t.co/u3wKzXDbzP
@funder She said that?  After this article from the WaPo was published? Did I miss something!	  https://t.co/WLZGiXsLA9
@RealMuckmaker Wow.  The orange kool-aid is strong there.  WOW!
@RealMuckmaker I would like to know what dirt they have on him to make him complicit.  There is no shame in going to the FBI and telling them what happened Senator Graham.
@SpicyFiles @KellyannePolls Should have read her response on what she would tell her Almost 14 year old son. I was disgusted. I have two sons who were raised to respect everyone. If they screwed up and did not take responsibility there would be hell at home. I've told my kids get arrested you stay there.
@AnnCoulter Who CARES if she is an immigrant or not!  She was telling him her story of Sexual Assault.
@TeaPainUSA The GOP states but he passed multiple background investigations.  Well the past caught up with SEVERAL Army Generals over conduct in the past.  You know what happened to those Generals. They are no longer in the Army and many demoted!  GOP try that again!  The GOP are hypocrites!
@ThisWeekABC Tell that to the Army General who like Kavanaugh have MULTIPLE Background Investigations over DECADES! 	https://t.co/idhWLUmoRe
@sahilkapur How about she tells her son to treat women with respect and take responsibility for ones actions. I have two sons who are adults they still hold the door open for me, treat people with respect and they know if they disrespect ANYONE Mom knows all.  Mom will put you back in line.
@LindseyGrahamSC Complicit Coward.
@Jim_Jordan This is not some damn episode of The Handmaid's Tale.  This is real life.  What has made ALL of the GOP a bunch of complicit MORONS!
@NateSilver538 I think he still drinks AND is in denial he has a drinking problem.
@ThisWeekABC Her attorney sent SEVERAL emails with no damn response.  Graham and Company are compromised.  Something or someone has made them behave like this.
@AltNatSecAgency WTF! How is overturning it great for women!  Women will died getting back-alley abortions.  You know I'm tired of men like that dingleberry trying to dictate women's reproductive rights.  Without a woman dingleberry would have never been born.
@ChocaholicBrit @ColMorrisDavis Our pets are family.  I keep my big guy Hickory's urn in my curio cabinet. Miss my big boy and remember the great stories of his adventures.
@AltNatSecAgency You have to be kidding!  You know they will spin this!  People need to stay frosty.  This is going to be a bumpy ride with a side of mud slinging.
@krassenstein Kavanaugh's behavior is clearly partisan.  Judges must be non-partisan. I'm so tired of the "Whataboutism". Kavanaugh should be happy the FBI investigation. What we are seeing is someone with something to hide. The FBI will find out the story and issue their findings.
@DearAuntCrabby I was watching The House with A Clock in its Walls.  Needed a TV/Social Media break
@SpicyFiles @ericgarland @susanlvs2jmp @ninaandtito @LouiseMensch @gregdoolan @ThePlumLineGS @Acosta @FBI Keep up the good fight Spicy!
@ColMorrisDavis @ChocaholicBrit Sorry to hear about your fur-baby.  We lost our big guy almost three years ago and still hurts.
@LouiseMensch @FBI The FBI will do their job and properly investigate the matter
@NBCNews He is interfering in the FBI doing their job!
@TeaPainUSA Since when do the inmates run the show!
@realDonaldTrump At least he served in uniform
@lauferlaw I would imagine they paid off ALL his credit card debt.
@newtgingrich Says the man who cheated on TWO of his wives and married for the 3rd time.  Go away.
@Jim_Jordan Remove the tin-foil hat.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Wait for the DAMN FBI report.  Who's in your wallets!
@marthamaccallum As the mother of two sons, they were raised to RESPECT people.
@senorrinhatch Who made you the Director of the FBI!  Let them do their investigation without pressure.
@SpicyFiles Hey @SpicyFiles found another nugget if regarding Georgetown Prep!
@MarkJKremer @alanap98 All of the above.
@SpicyFiles @BrianKarem Hey Spicy check this article out.  https://t.co/vWCSDk5cUc
@SpicyFiles Have to dig up the article.
@SpicyFiles Hey Spicy there is another article about a priest from 1989-2003 dismissed for sex crimes
@DoreenRudolph3 Thank you for being a champion for those with Diabetes.
@KerryLynn0 @naretevduorp The even sadder part?  I've seen this behavior in my line of work.  It did not end well for those who misled the investigators.
@naretevduorp If you feel you did nothing wrong then you sit for an interview.  People who have something to hide stall and whine about the investigation and the investigators.  Sounds like there were a lot of bad behaviors at his school and NO ONE did a damn thing.
@MaryMglesch @RealMuckmaker @TheCut Makes you wonder?  My thoughts exactly.  Remember Penn State's mess?
@foxandfriends @LindseyGrahamSC This is exactly why these crimes go unreported.  The mindset of blame the victim.  These men and women already are ashamed it happened to them.  They trust Law Enforcement and the Prosecutors will treat them with respect. They need compassion and respect to make it through this.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC There are serious concerns about his financial disclosures, and behaviors. You need a full report from the FBI. Why the rush? the GOP forgets without a woman none of you idiots would be born! Unless men develop a uterus you need to listen to the women of this country more.
@bessbell Where in the hell where his parents when he was doing this crap!  Where they MIA?  Seems to me there was NO parental supervision of him during his high school years!
@RealMuckmaker @TheCut If you like that story.  Found this story on the internet	https://t.co/GFS7xZeoKx
@SpicyFiles Here is what I am not understanding.  How in the hell did he manage to get away with the financial issues!  If I did what he did on my SF-86 or financial disclosure forms, I would be fired my office packed up and mailed to me!  WTF!
@tracygreen Here is another story on the Orr mess.	https://t.co/GFS7xZeoKx
@tracygreen https://t.co/FSAFgR14bM
@tracygreen I read a story about the Orr mess.
@kenvogel God that is a lot of gold everything.  Even Liberace would have toned the hue down.  Looks like something out of the 60-70's!
Think it is time to invest in a wildlife camera.  I have a Barred Owl in my backyard somewhere.
@RepMattGaetz This is to serious of a nomination and everyone doesn't want to end up with egg over everyone's face if this goes bad.  There are issues about his finances that must be cleared up and conduct.  Shut up let the people who manage security investigations do their work!
@KatrinaPierson There has to be due diligence.  This is a nomination for a high position.  He has to be cleared by the FBI.  New information has come to light and There are questions about finances and his conduct.  If he has nothing to hide then he should be able to cooperate with no problem.
@SenAlexander You are an ignorant MORON!
@SnakeOilPrez All of the above
@RepGosar So you would rather send loyal civil servants home with NO Pay over your stupidity.  I hope you get voted the hell out!
@LindseyGrahamSC What you did today was a shameful act.  You are a worthless piece of scum.  You need to resign immediately!
@AngrierWHStaff There should have been on weeks ago.
@RoguePOTUSStaff Good god how stupid is this WH!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your conduct and actions is exactly why victims never report.  Fear of being made out to be liars.  Whatever happened to investigating this allegations and treating everyone with respect and dignity!  Clearly you don't see that and just throw more fuel on the file.
@senorrinhatch You just made it hard for victims to report crimes with this behaviors.  I don't care who withheld what!  Treat the victims with respect while this is being investigated you idiot!
@maggieNYT @MaddowBlog Gaslight much?  I don’t trust a single thing you right.
@AngrierWHStaff He is guilty as hell.
@ALT_uscis @LindseyGrahamSC What is wrong with these senators!
@mflynnJR @MichaelAvenatti See this is why victims of sexual assault never report.  People like you who vilify them.  Investigated and find out the truth. This should not be playing out isn’t the media but by law enforcement.  You too need to stop it.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Shut up madam chairperson. You vilified these women.
@SteveScalise You treat ALL involved with dignity and respect.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Moron!
@senatemajldr Neither did you.  You and others called her a liar.  Resign now
@senatemajldr Lesson learned.  Treat victims with respect!
@senorrinhatch You too ignore things also.  Blame all around.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You need to be spending time with your children.
@ChuckGrassley What would you do if this happened to a member of your family.  Would you behave the same way?  I think not.  You would want to have the person who did this to your family held accountable.  You are so blinded to do what is right
@senatemajldr Shut up you lying turtle head.
@KatrinaPierson @ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr You don’t understand these men and women are scared to come forward because of people like YOU.  It’s not that simple you twit.  Fear and threat drive them not to report.  Go back to your damn ignorant hole.
@maggieNYT Why should we trust your scoop on a story?
@EdKrassen A court just sentenced Bill Cosby to 3-10 years for this!  Those were for older crimes!  Sorry this should be disqualifying
@LindseyGrahamSC @LouiseMensch @marthamaccallum Coward and feckless moron!
@ChuckGrassley Need to find your damn spine in the process.  Coward and Benedict Arnold
@AngrierWHStaff I will wait to read it when I don’t have a full stomach.
@senorrinhatch So what
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Without women you would not be born.  Woman changed your diapers, cooked your meals, washed your clothes etc.  You repay women by treating us like dog shit.  Just resign.  You lost your spine and dignity.  Coward!
@maggieNYT Once again being a biased journalist.  I don’t trust you to be fair,
@KatrinaPierson You are part of the problem.  Stop gaslighting
@realDonaldTrump Maybe the staff should have vetted him better.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews You need to get off Twitter and spend more time with your children.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Nice to know you sold your soul to the devil for power.  You are a coward.  RESIGN!
@senorrinhatch What about these women who had to flee their homes.  You vilified the victims stead of investigating these allegation.  What does is he hiding?
@SenateMajLdr You moron.  This behavior makes victims want to hide and never report sexual assault crimes.  Shame on you.
@marthamaccallum Watching the NFL Game.  Keep spinning that web of lies.
@nytmike You and The NY Times are so biased.
@counterchekist They are complicit in their biased coverage at the New York Times.
@GOPChairwoman @GOP If he wants to clear his name then have this investigated!  Your actions make it harder for these crimes to be reported and investigated.  Don’t make this harder on these people who have been suffering in silence fearful to report these crimes
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr Who is will help the people who have been sexual assaulted in filing a report.  Are they going to be treated with respect and compassion or like chattel.  You make it very hard for people to come forward and report these crimes.  These must be reported and investigation.
@realDonaldTrump @AbeShinzo You can’t hide you lyin eyes....and your smile is a thin disguise......I thought by now you’d realize....there ain’t no way to hide you lyin eyes
@Hegemommy @Lady_Sisyphus22 I will pass headed to watch pre-game for football
@TeaPainUSA Those men on the Judiciary committee need a reminder, without a woman their dumbasses would have not been born.  Last I checked they don’t have artificial wombs to grow humans.
@mschlapp Your words are why victims never come forward and report these crimes.  If he did Nothing wrong then he should welcome an investigation to find out the truth.  Refusing makes him look guilty as hell. This about making sure the right decision is made.
@SenatorCollins Big words from a complicit coward.  You don’t lift a single finger to do the right thing.  You vote on party lines ALL the time!  Big words and no action from you.  Are you going to stand up and protect Mueller, protect sexual assault victims and the truth?
@Amy_Siskind They may run out of space posting it.
@ChocaholicBrit I miss the Fairness Doctrine in reporting the news.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump We are witnessing a bunch of spineless cowards be complicit in their behavior.  You lost this GOP voter.  You have no respect for women and victims of sexual assault.  This is exactly why they do not come forward and report.  SHAME ON YOU!  Coward
@SenateMajLdr Where is your damn spine!  Must be kept in the WH your coward.
@TIME LOL!   Stick to that story buddy.  It will be you undoing!  That is some funny shit.
@maggieNYT Just a thought you should be unbiased in your reporting.
@scotusreporter I’ll be watching NFL football.
@KatrinaPierson Stop gaslighting
@nedprice This is why these people (men and women) never come forward!  The first thing they do is attack the victim instead of getting to the bottom of the allegations and investigate.  We prosecuted Bill Cosby on older allegations whey is this different
@DearAuntCrabby Sick and want to throw up.
@RealMuckmaker He needs to retire and do it NOW!
@freddyatton @GLSCHWALL @realDonaldTrump All of the above!
@ChuckGrassley Oh be quiet
@SpicyFiles Well I think Twitter put me the Shadow Ban Time-Out.
@electcharles Do shut up you Party over Country complicit moron.  You don't have the guts to do what is right.
@aravosis I'm calling the Bullshit Flag on this.  Something is very damn fishy with Kavanaugh. What in the hell is he hiding?  He has to be on the take.
@SpicyFiles I don't have calendars from 30 years ago.  What kind of horse shit is going on!  Who neutered the entire Judiciary Committee to not see this is a BS thing.  God I need a drink.
@MollyJongFast I'm old enough to remember when the GOP had BALLS and put Country before party.  Now Graham and company have been neutered and complicit in their actions.
@ChocaholicBrit @LindseyGrahamSC Last seen with the WH I hear
@maggieNYT You are so biased.  Why should we trust your reporting.
@ChocaholicBrit @LindseyGrahamSC I believe someone has the goods on Graham and they are forcing him to be complicit in his behavior.  He should man up grow a set of balls go to the FBI and report it.  Or is the Good Senator ashamed of what they may have on him.  This is so disgusting his behavior.
@maggieNYT I seriously question if you can be unbiased in your reporting.  You have been known to support the WH.
@peterbakernyt @NBCNews @HeidiPrzybyla Does anyone in DC get vetted anymore!  What the HELL!
@RepGosar Resign.
@counterchekist My sons didn't behave like that in High School.  My sons were busy studying!
@senorrinhatch You are not asking the serious questions on this nominee.  You're ramming it through before all the questions are answered.  There are serious flags about financial disclosures and conduct.  When you do things half-baked you come out with egg on your face.
@DrPaulGosar Enjoy the holidays with your family.  You must the be most hated person in your family to have ALL SIX of your siblings blast you.
@SpockResists As the mom of two adult sons.  My sons when they were teenagers were at home with their nose in a book learning.  One served in the military and will get his degree this December and the other is in College.  My sons were raised to respect women!
@AriFleischer You are a moron.  It is talk like this that make victims not report these crimes.  So sick of this crap.
@AnnCoulter Moron!
@tedcruz I hope you get voted out of office. You are a complicit moron and coward!
@goldengateblond @GOP What is wrong with them!  Teach your sons to RESPECT WOMEN!
@thehill Teach you sons to respect women!
@KatrinaPierson @SenGillibrand @SenFeinstein This is exact why victims never come forward and report these crimes.  Fear of being attacked, shamed and bullied.  Investigate the allegation and let the courts decide!  Not the court of public opinion!  Shame in you.
@JudgeJeanine @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Please shut up.
@realDonaldTrump Who paid off his mountain of debt!  We want to know!
@RalphNorman How would you feel is your wife, daughter, niece told you someone sexually assaulted them!  Would you joke in the same manner?  I think not.  This is not a joking matter.  These women live in fear and embarrassment for DECADES before being able to speak up!  WAKE THE HELL!
@HillReporter That is a failing mission
@TIME Who is investigating the threats against Dr Ford!
@realDonaldTrump She was 15 years old!  People who are sexually assaulted are fearful of coming forward because of the attitude like yours!
@realDonaldTrump This is WHY women do not report these crimes.  Fear of being vilified about reporting it.  Fear of being shamed or called names.  You investigate treat everyone with respect and find out the truth.  Teach men to RESPECT women.  You do not threaten people that they have to flee
@DoreenRudolph3 People should not have to file bankruptcy because of medical bills and medicine.
@CNNPolitics I hope McConnell has to appear before a GJ to answer for his complicit behavior and accepting dark money from foreign entities
@SteveScalise So what about Dr. Ford who had to flee her home with her family because of threats!
@ChuckGrassley You complicit coward.  You are a disgrace to the Senate.  Just resign.  You need to investigate this like Anita Hill.
@SheriffClarke This is exactly WHY women do not come forward for fear of people  attacking them.  You were a damn law enforcement officer.  Sworn to protect and uphold the law.  Shame on you.  They deserve to be heard and this investigate.  Not shamed into staying in the dark.
@KatrinaPierson He will be protecting an active criminal investigation you tater tot!  This compromises assets assisting in the investigation.
@ChuckGrassley So now you have a spine!
@senorrinhatch You and the GOP are doing the same damn thing.  Hypocrites
@DonaldJTrumpJr Stick to running the Trump Organization
@ChuckGrassley This is why women do not come forward to report these crimes.  It is because idiots like you smear them and call them names.  Do your jobs investigate this and hear her claim.  You are a complicit moron for not doing what is right
@LindseyGrahamSC You did the same thing for Anita Hill.  You are trying the ram this down everyone’s throat
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Do us a favor stick to your day job and stay out of politics.  Or spend more time with your kids!
@tedcruz @peta Oh you are a broken record of stupidity
@RepublicanSwine Someone needs to tell Uncle Fester Ted Cruz to stop his lying.
@GOPChairwoman Complicit GOP.  Ever think about placing COUNTRY before PARTY!  No....Who's in your wallet?  What has made you so damn complicit.  Thirty Pieces of Silver to dance with the Devil.  Hope it was worth it Judas!
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Complicit Benedict Arnold
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept @FBI No you screwed people and possible endangered others.  All for your complicit behavior.  Couldn't wait for the investigation to be completed.  I hope you get voted out of office your Benedict Fing Arnold!
@Jim_Jordan You realize this screws the entire investigation!  You complicit moron.
@KFILE This is why women stay silent about this.  When they come forward and are attacked.  SHAME on the WH and others attacking this woman.
@LindseyGrahamSC You use to be a respectable Senator.  Now I think you're a complicit moron.  Who is paying you to be complicit?  You use to work in a bipartisan manner.  Now!  not so much.  WAKE UP!
@RudyGiuliani I would be worried about the evidence MUELLER has.  He will be the one to prove Conspiracy not collusion CONSPIRACY!.  Those who plead guilty are talking.  Tell your client to stay off Twitter and stop digging the hole deeper!
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews @FoxBusiness Nope going to watch Sunday night football.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @DailyCaller Spend time with your kids.  Get off Twitter!
@realDonaldTrump We are waiting for the report.  Several witches have pleaded guilty.  Several witches granted immunity.  Several witches have been sentenced.  Listen to counsel stay off Twitter before you dig a bigger damn whole!
@MeetThePress @AlanDersh So what has changed Alan?  He realized he was on a sinking ship and would be on the wrong side of history when this hits the fan?
@parscale @realDonaldTrump You mean more disinformation and voter suppression!
@amandablount2 I love having an Apple Watch for those times I can’t find my IPhone!
@politvidchannel @Lady_Sisyphus22 How much you want to bet those getting cut are in Red States!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP It took four years for my home to recover!  I’m breaking even on equity.
@MeetThePress @FEMA_Brock First what’s his face from Katrina (the horse association executive) to Brock the wasteful director.  This is horse crap.  Why is this man still running FEMA.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why are you on a Twitter!  You need to spend time with your KIDS!
@RudyGiuliani Someone forgot how to spell cooperation!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You need to spend more time with your children than on Twitter!
@RealMuckmaker ADX Florence
@PhilippeReines Is there a both?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do us a favor just concentrate on your kids.
@DevinNunes Oh be quiet you Benedict Arnold.  You sold your soul for 30 Pieces of Silver.  JUDAS!
@NormEisen These are the same people who say we can't afford to give Civil Servants a pay raise.
@FOX4 He was shot in HIS OWN APARTMENT!
@maddogpac Look!  You're famous again!!!!!  Love you guys! https://t.co/IWc3fUfHDX
@RepKevinBrady Bull!  You and congress are cutting my pay!
@SpeakerRyan @wispolitics Just resign
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch You are a person spreading fear
@Jim_Jordan @theMRC Complicit moron
@HouseGOP My house I’ve seen a drop and still have high taxes!  Step away from the BS
@SpeakerRyan Rose!  Are you HIGH!
@SteveScalise So are you going to stick it to tax payers like me who are already in a high tax bracket!  You won't give me a cost of living increase.  Doing more work with less people.  Taking work home just to keep the mission going and not getting paid for it.  Complicit much!
@IvankaTrump You can never relate to the normal US Worker!  You have never had to decide which bill to pay with 20% pay cut because Congress couldn't get their act together.  You didn't go home for 10 day with NO PAY because of Congress couldn't get their act together.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Shame on you spreading a conspiracy theory.
@Jim_Jordan @TomFitton No one is censoring you.  You put crap up that violates terms of service they will respond according to policy!
@LindseyGrahamSC So you are for ruining an active criminal investigation.  You fucking coward!   Resign!
@AynRandPaulRyan Small world.  I ended up working on Bainbridge Island a few years later for a small law firm!
@MollyJongFast God what is wrong with his staff.  So far 4 pleaded guilty, 1 convicted on 8 counts, over 2 dozen indicted and who knows how many more have indictments pending.  Lets not forget the little lady arrested and sitting in the same jail as Paulie.  Wonder what she will plea too.
@AynRandPaulRyan Silverdale, WA at home with the kids when husband just came home from the base gym told me to turn on the TV.
@krassenstein Ryan is a complicit moron and coward!
@SpicyFiles @KenPaxtonTX @NRA How in all that is Holy do they still get to run for office while under INDICTMENT!  Normal citizen would be out of a JOB!
@TheRickWilson Roy Moore is scum and a piece of 💩.  I'm still wondering HOW he was elected to Chief Justice TWICE!  Each time he was removed from the bench for his unethical behavior.  Thank god he can't run again because of his damn age!
@GOP @tedcruz We also want politicians who uphold the Constitution and their oath of office.  We don’t need cowards who fold to the biggest donor!
@RudyGiuliani Are you that stupid?
@NicolleDWallace I think someone has dirt on Graham to make him a complicit puppet
@TrueFactsStated Uh hell no.  Don’t bring that up. Don’t give them any damn ides!
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Coward.  Thirty pieces of Silver cemented you as someone who has forgotten their oath.  You are a Benedict Arnold.  We the people will speak at the ballot box in November.
@amandablount2 Tired of these men in Congress deciding what is best for a woman’s body.  Hands off McConnell and company.  My body my decision. I have no desire of becoming a Martha!
@maralagofucku @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I know that is some funny 💩
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes I thought you said the New York Times was failing?  Now you are praising them?
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump What part of active criminal investigation do you not get!  This is a sure way to get any charges tossed!  Let them finish the investigation and then you can see the documents.
@MollyJongFast Man isn’t even divorced.  Some much for family values!
@realDonaldTrump Oh, are you and Ivanka going to manufacture you goods in the USA?  Hypocrites
@realDonaldTrump What universe is this going on in!
@RudyGiuliani Complicit Benedict Arnold.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump He’s doing that all by himself.  Wish you would stop lying all the time.
@seungminkim We terminate employment for Federal Worlers with that kind of debt and sudden pay off.  That guy should be held to the same standard!
@mschlapp Complicit Moron.
@poorhag No one should have to ration medication to stay alive.  This is horrible.  Prayers to you family.  There has to be a way to lower the price of insulin and other medications.
@ALT_uscis I tell you this is a bad episode of The Handmaid’s Tale.  Under his eye.  May the Lord Open.
Oh lord.....Alex Jones vitriol nonsense has invaded Huntsville, AL.  Just spotted one of their bumper stickers on a van!
@MollyJongFast Nope he couldn’t get past initial screening!
@foxandfriends @PeteHegseth Why must a Congress and the WH keep screwing over the Federal Workforce with shutdowns!  This means no claims being processed, national parks closed, etc.  These workers do their jobs and stay loyal to their agency mission.  Stop doing this to them.
@TeaPainUSA If this is true.  The s**t is about to hit the fan.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump What happened to honoring Senator McCain’s memory and patriotism.  All words you complicit moron.  You have betrayed this country and values for Thirty Pieces of Silver and your soul owned by a puppet master.  You dishonor his memory with this behavior.
@GovMikeHuckabee Hard to believe you use to a Governor!   This is not High School!  You are not helping the matter.  You are part of this problem.
@DaddyDaddymac @Lady_Sisyphus22 Close minded
@senrobportman Under his eye.....
@GOPLeader Judas!  Took 30 pieces of silver to betray the country!
@senorrinhatch Benedict Arnold.  Hope this betrayal was worth the thirty pieces of silver you took.  Complicit coward!  I thought you were country before party.  No donors over country.
@KatrinaPierson Gaslight much.  Sold your soul for thirty pieces of silver.
@TheRickWilson Give them time....foot in mouth will happen.
@Jim_Jordan This is an active criminal investigation you don’t get the damn documents until it is finished.
@funder For what.  Oh my f**king god who is advising him...Bobo the Monkey!
@funder @realDonaldTrump I thought Lie Detector tests were inadmissible in court? What crime did they commit?  Did they leak sensitive information or did they tell the truth?  I thought they were telling the truth?
I don't care what anyone says.  I'm going to listen to the NFL games on Sirius Radio.  That is what headphones are for!
@ScottWalker Where was the outrage when Tim Tebow was kneeling?  Hypocrite much!
@TrueFactsStated Then someone in Congress needs to grow a giant set and do something.  If not they are complicit in their inaction!  Start lining up the damn specialist now!
@SecretaryPerry We're you pressured in making this statement.  Complicit much!
@PressSec Benedict Arnold....Sold your country out for thirty pieces of silver.
@LindseyGrahamSC We know you are a complicit coward.  Sold your soul for money or do they have something else on you?  You say you were Senator McCain's friend but we know you are Judas who betrayed all for a price.  Coward.
@SenateMajLdr Complicit Coward and Benedict Arnold.  You betrayed your country for thirty pieces of silver!  Judas!
@PressSec You are a cowards and liar.
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP You are such a lying coward.
@senorrinhatch God you are a complicit coward.  You are placing party before country.  You are not upholding the memory of John McCain by doing what is right. Benedict Arnold!  Complicit in everything that you say and do.  You are no patriot.
@GovMikeHuckabee Breaks my heart you are a complicit coward.  Who is paying you to betray your country.
@JeffreyToobin The indictment of the two congressmen happened int 2017 during the current administrations watch.  This did not happen on the prior administrations watch.
@SpicyFiles Awesome!
@realDonaldTrump Collins and Hunter will have their day in court  to argue their case before a jury.  The DOJ is NOT your private law firm.  They serve the people of the United States! FYI...They were being investigated in 2017.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Economy is booming but the President says we can’t afford a pay raise for federal workers which includes you.  Not all government workers make 100k a year average make less.  Stop attacking the loyal civil servants who work very hard for their country.  Many are also Veterans!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain Honor his legacy by standing up placing COUNTRY before Party.   Protect Mueller's investigation and uphold the law.  Call out the lies and false statements, the name calling.  Honor Senator McCain's memory by doing what is right and protect this nation!
@SpeakerRyan @HouseVetAffairs @RepMikeCoffman Spineless coward. You say you are for helping the vets but treat the vets like crap.  You have NEVER served in uniform. You do not know anything about selfless service at all. You are selfish and only serve your own interest. You want to do something! Country before Party Coward!
@Newsweek They were there because the family allowed them to be there.  They had no business being there.
@JoyAnnReid Zero margin of error.
@RudyGiuliani Where in hell did you get your law degree.  You are a disgrace!
@MajorCBS @CNN 1st we were furlough with 20% pay cuts, 2nd shutdown for 10 days, 3rd no performance bonus, 4th cuts in manpower, 5th Congress calling us lazy and 6th no raises! We help you many things for the public.  We have  families too! Many are low graded positions.  We are veterans too.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Gaslight much?
@NatashaBertrand There had to be some knowledge.  Think about it.
@realDonaldTrump Give it a break.  Innocent people don’t behave like this!
@GOP Yet we don’t have money for a 1.9% pay raise for federal workers.  8 years I can retire.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @SteveScalise The economy is booming but the President says We can’t afford a lousy 1.9% pay raise for federal workers?  We have been betrayed by congress and the WH
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain You coward!  You say kind words about McCain but do the opposite in private.
@ColMorrisDavis More than likely to the Golf Course to sulk and pout.
@hintofsarcasm I'm tripping over the dogs and basket of clothes still needing to be folded and put away.  There is NO WAY my bed looks this perfect!
@BeautifulRed7 @EdKrassen Welcome.
@BeautifulRed7 @EdKrassen Not to the same extent as private unions.  Mostly for personnel problems.
@EdKrassen We know.  In one breath says economy is booming and another breath can’t afford it.  Which is it?  Furloughs, shutdowns and loss of positions, many are retiring.  We are mad as hell at this.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Did you stop to think this could be part of an ongoing investigation and they are unable to release it! Let the FBI continue their investigation got christ sake!
@RepMattGaetz I want congressmen and senators not paid off by foreign governments or agents.  I want Country before Party candidates.  Something you are not you Benedict Arnold and Coward
@SpeakerRyan You spineless coward.  John McCain always was and is a hero and Patriot.  You betrayed the US for money!
@DevinNunes @kevinomccarthy @GOPLeader You are not worthy to be at the memorial service for the late Senator.  He was a patriot and war hero. You neither.  You have betrayed our country and the good people of the Department of Justice and FBI with your lies and actions.  Senator McCain was a true statesman and patriot
@SpicyFiles @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Yep.  Just made up my mind for midterms.  They are messing around with my GD pay.  Tired of being their punching bag.  I will speak at the ballot box!
@bluemtsun @ALT_uscis Think it is shitty what they are doing.
@votevets A large percentage are GS 12 and below!  This hurts us. I'm tired of the way they treat us!
@sahilkapur We are doing more with less! Positions Cut. Premiums rising, retirement benefits dropping, taxes rising. We are not a punching bag. Morale low! There is no one to replace these people leaving.  For What!  The top 1 percent getting a break!  Many of us are not high wage earners!
@mattgaetz Tater tot Benedict Arnold.
@ALT_uscis I am one who is getting the short end of the stick.  Good luck getting SSI, mail and other stuff there will be no one to do it when people retire.  We can’t recruit without incentives.  We are middle class.
@Jim_Jordan You are a disgrace.  You are not obeying the oath you took!
@AngrierWHStaff As we federal workers do more with less.  No one wants to work for the federal government with the stupidity running around and threat of losing retirement benefits.  Stop mucking with my damn retirement!
@realDonaldTrump Why are you harassing a career civil servant!
@counterchekist @DevinNunes Nunes is guilty as hell.  No Foreign Intelligence official wouldn't give him the time of day.  Nunes needs to see the inside of a courtroom for his day in court.
@SteveScalise Nobody is targeting them. Stop gaslighting.
@Jim_Jordan Moron!  I got shadowed banned.  Maybe if you didn't behave like a complicit tater tot you wouldn't get restricted!
@SenTomCotton @SenJohnMcCain Now you have found your spine Senator Cotton!
@LindseyGrahamSC Do the right thing show that you have a spine and put Country before Party!  Stop looking like a complicit Tater-Tot and be an adult and do your job to save America.  That is how you can honor Senator McCain's memory by standing up and doing what is right.
@TomFitton Complicit Coward.
@LindseyGrahamSC Senator McCain will always remain a patriot.  He was Country before Party.  He believed in working with his fellow members in the Senate.  He served with courage and pride. He thought of others.  You Senator Graham are no patriot you should us you are complicit in your actions.
@morethanmySLE @SenJohnMcCain Senator McCain's vote helped people on ACA keep their coverage.  He was a true statesman and patriot.  He could worked with people on both sides of the aisle.  First and foremost he put Country before Party.  He and Ted Kennedy were the last honest patriots in the Senate.
@TheRickWilson Sleep?  What's that?  I long for six hours of uninterrupted sleep.
@realDonaldTrump Senator McCain served his country with honor and pride.  He continued serving event after he took the uniform off.  He worked with members of the Senate in a bipartisan way.  He is a patriot and hero.  He always put Country first and Party second!
@MeghanMcCain Your father is a true patriot.  He served his country proudly in uniform and as a US Senator.  He had the ability to work with others regardless of party affiliation.  He will be missed.  He is a hero who thought about his country first and foremost.
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain Senator McCain was a great man!  He served his country faithfully and with great honor.  He always put Country before Party.  He showed he had a back bone and wasn't afraid to stand up for the Country!
@SpeakerRyan You should honor his memory by standing up and protecting the country.  Senator McCain is a true patriot who put Country before Party EVERY Time.
@peterdaou @LindseyGrahamSC He has skeletons in his closet and they have him by the balls to be complicit!  Graham is another party before country weasel.
@RandPaul Sell out and coward.  You have betrayed your country!
@PreetBharara I'm beginning to think Alan Dershowitz has lost his marbles.  Or did he have any to begin with!
@MajorCBS @RepSteveStivers @NRCC @Rep_Hunter How about Congressman Stivers read the damn charging documents!  That is their standard BS statement.  Heaven forbid if it was the other side of the aisle they would be standing with pitchforks and torches demanding a resignation.  What happened to having morals.
@BernieSanders He has a successful business.  What do you have against him?
@Jandelliott Good God.  What is wrong with the world.
@MajorCBS @SpeakerRyan @Rep_Hunter Pending resolution!  The Good Congressman was INDICTED!  How many more need to be indicted for Speaker Ryan to do his damn job have these people removed!
@BrianKarem I think Rolling Stones need to send a letter telling him to stop using the song.
@jdawsey1 How much more information does Ryan and Company need!  Really!  Is Ryan THAT stupid!
@DoreenRudolph3 @Lunch Oh my.  That is a very hard time.  I'm researching the various monitors it's a battle for coverage.  My doctor feels I'm an ideal candidate but insurance says no.  I'm not a T1D I am a T2D who is responding very well to treatment.  It is a struggle but we keep fighting!
@DoreenRudolph3 @Lunch I've been researching two types one is by Dexcom and the other is Freestyle Libre.  The Dexcom is preferred but I am dealing with issues getting my insurance to cover it.  The rule with them I have to be in Poor Control to be eligible.
RT @DoreenRudolph3: @howiemandel @mbpatricia1 #insulin4all
@DoreenRudolph3 @Lunch Continuous Glucose Monitor is a CGM
@ChuckGrassley What dirt do they have on you!  You use to put country before Party.  Now you put DONORS before country!  Complicit coward
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS @ICEgov No they do not.  They want strong borders just doing it in a logical manner!
@DoreenRudolph3 @Lunch I am fighting to get a CGM!  Can only get one if I show poor control!  If I had a CGM would have found out my medication needed to be adjusted sooner.
@DoreenRudolph3 @Lunch Some people think they should lord over others.  It makes me furious when people say that crap!
@Acosta @Lady_Sisyphus22 Manafort is a liar and a cheat.  He lied to get money and lied about his accounts overseas and created shell companies to hide money.  Manafort is a very bad man!
@abbydphillip @Lady_Sisyphus22 Very sad?  Maybe Manafort shouldn’t have defrauded lenders to get money.  Maybe he should have disclosed ALL of his foreign accounts and been honest on the applications!  Manaforts downfall will be his greed!
@SpeakerRyan @RepBillFlores Really utility bills going down?  I haven’t seen any sign of this magical drop in utility bill prices.  Stop lying coward!
@alsosusieq2 @amandablount2 Insomnia sucks.
@amandablount2 I’ve wondered that myself.  Here I am struggling to go back to sleep watching movies surfing Twitter!
@realDonaldTrump When will you visit the troops in Afghanistan!
@TeaPainUSA I know Mueller is building his case.  Will there be a country left when he's done?

@TeaPainUSA @realDonaldTrump He knows he is guilty as hell and will perjury himself on the first question!
@realDonaldTrump Give it a break
@realDonaldTrump @MarkBurnettTV Maybe Mueller already has them.
@PostOpinions @JoeNBC All of them had something so bad in the closet that made them complicit puppets!
@krassenstein Never once did those moron's think to report this to the FBI!  They need to get refunds on all of their college degrees and LAW DEGREES.
@KatrinaPierson @FoxNews Will be sleep by then.  Have fun gaslighting
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Like watching a very bad reality TV Show.
Okay I really need to think about going to bed.  Twitter is on fire.  Like watching the People of Walmart!  Sad part....The people going to Walmart will at least look at the mirror before leaving the house!

Going to log off Twitter and pack for my trip.  Getting really tired of the morons and whack-a-nuts.
@Robert_Aderholt @POTUS How many veteran's could be housed by this bailout!  How many children could be covered under CHIP by this bailout.  You blasted President Obama and others over these bailouts.  Why is it okay NOW!
@RepMarkMeadows Complicit Tater-Tot Coward.  I bet if we look at your FEC filings we'll find your hand has been in the Russian cookie jar!
@SenateMajLdr You are a complicit Tater-Tot Coward.  You have failed the people of Kentucky!  You took dark money to stay in power.  I hope you get voted out and lose the majority in the Senate.  You refuse to do the right thing and enable all those Drama Llamas in the WH.
The day is not complete without a salesman ringing the doorbell setting off the dogs.  This is the one time I wish Hickory were alive to scare the crap out of them!
@realDonaldTrump How much of a reduction is it going to be in price?  You're raising premiums, reducing coverage and taking away pre-existing conditions.  People are filing bankruptcy to get relief from medical expenses your tater-tot!  All you seem to care about is who has the biggest DONATION!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Start by hiring more AMERICAN workers at your properties!  No more foreign visas for waitstaff, housekeepers and cooks!  Bring your products back to the United States to be made by AMERICAN workers and plants!
@Jim_Jordan You stood by and did nothing when people reported abuse.  SHAME ON YOU!

@IvankaTrump Shame on you.  Sell out
@DoreenRudolph3 Situations like yours are so heart breaking.  I don't understand how medications that once were inexpensive are price gouged to unaffordable prices WITH Insurance!  No one should have to decided between medicine or eating!  These drug prices need to come down.

@realDonaldTrump THEY HAD A SEARCH WARRANT!
@HouseGOP You have lost this GOP voter.  You are trying us into Gilead.  You sold yourselves to the highest donor.  You have accepted dirty money and are complicit in your actions.  What happened to the GOP who ALWAYS placed COUNTRY before Party!  WAKE UP do your jobs!  Protect the USA!
@realDonaldTrump Are you still upset over the fact you were not successful in purchasing the Buffalo Bills!
@SenateMajLdr Another Day and you still haven't grown a spine or a set of BALLS to stand up to bullies!  You have sold out your country for donor $$$$.
@missc0nstrued I feel the same way and I am a Sagittarius
@realDonaldTrump Who are these people?  Name them?
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @SandraSmithFox @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews Oh dear lord.  What part of ACTIVE investigation do you NOT understand!  The information cannot be released
@counterchekist Sounds exciting!
@amandablount2 Love your tattoo.
@SpeakerRyan @RepHensarling @FinancialCmte Overwhelmingly you have placed Party over Country you complicit coward.  Grow a damn spine and put COUNTRY first!
@BillPascrell I thought the President didn’t have an interpreter there it was him and Putin?
@RepMarkMeadows This is an active criminal investigation you will not get them until the investigation is done!
@RepComstock Grow a spine and put COUNTRY before Party!!!!
@DevinNunes @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes You sold out the country for WHAT!  I hope you get voted out of office.
@20committee The men and women of the Intelligence Community have to be angry about this.  These brave men and women collect information while risking their lives. Something has to be done to combat these complicit wombats! How much more can we take before the orange baboon destroys the U.S.!
@amandablount2 McConnell and Company are a bunch of complicit morons!
@LindseyGrahamSC Complicit moron.  You are a coward.  You need to resign now.  You do not have the interest of the United States at heart.  You are betraying the United States. COWARD!
@realDonaldTrump Oh dear god.  McConnell shut down the whole thing for fear of appearing too partisan!
@counterchekist They may need more space for they new “guests”. Wonder  many members of congress will be permanent residence when all is said and done.  Run with the dogs you get fleas.
@TrueFactsStated Why does his suit look so ill fitting.  With ALL the money he has surely he can afford a tailored suit that fits properly.
@funder I hope he names the congressional candidate AND the campaign person who facilitated the contact!
@ChadGoebert @JonAcuff @jaketapper @JeffGoins Let me Guess.  Sarah's brother lives close by!
@kylegriffin1 What the hell is he trying to say.  It doesn't make any sense.  Sounds like a rambling baboon!
@PressSec @CNN @POTUS Stop lying ma’am.  You are gaslighting
@SpicyFiles Kremlin Barbie (aka Ivanka) needs to have a long chat with Mueller if she wants to keep her family together and maybe keep some of her assets.  Only a matter of time before lands in a cell at Camp Cupcake like Martha Stewart! Only a longer stay.
@GOP Once upon a time the GOP put country before Party.  Now you take dirty donor money over country!  Complicit much!  Lost this voter due to your lack of a spine to do what is right.
@SevernAmber Time to buy more popcorn!
@Bornabrit1 @SevernAmber Can’t wait to find out who the unnamed congressional candidate is mentioned in the indictments.  GOP members are dirty as hell on this.  No wonder so many are “retiring”
@AngrierWHStaff Need to fire the protocol specialist.  They suck or did they forget to use pictures to show hi. What to do.
@AngrierWHStaff Wonder if she is thinking it is easier to train her Corgis than the orange moron!  The corgis listen better!
@FoxNews @RepAndyBiggsAZ So using this same theory prosecutors should be removed for the same thing.  Ever think peop,e set aside biases and do their DAMN Jobs!
@realDonaldTrump Again ask Mitchell McConnell.  He did not want to upset the apple cart!
@realDonaldTrump Facts matter.  Mitchell McConnell played the coward didn't want to upset the apple cart.  This is on the Senate Majority Leader.  Who is the unnamed Congressional Candidate who received the information!
@BeardedGenius I was waiting for the rolled-up newspaper or spray bottle to come out to get him back in line!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr I wonder where Roger Stone fits in the crap-storm?  You know he was thick as thieves in this mess!  I'm interested to find out who in Congress is also up to their eyeballs in Borscht!
@jasoninthehouse Did you talk it Senator McCain!
@DrDenaGrayson Jared doesn't even deserve a Secret security clearance!  He has lied on so many forms!
@20committee Jared doesn't deserve to have the TS with the issues he has!
@thehill He shouldn't even have a secret with his background and SF 86 issues.  Tired of the damn double standards.  Normal Federal Workers AND Military would be gone security clearance revoked if they did what Kushner did which is LIE on the forms.  This is BS!
@RepMarkWalker @GOPoversight You don't get to ask questions regarding an active criminal investigation.
@Jim_Jordan Talk to Senator McCain.
@DearAuntCrabby He doesn't not have the best team preparing him for these situations.  My Basset Hound could do a better job speaking than POTUS.
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @MacTXPress @RepStefanik @RepJoeWilson @RepDLamborn @RepMikeTurner @RepPaulCook @boblatta @RepBillJohnson @HASCRepublicans You and others said sequestration and cut personnel!  The Military is falling short on recruitment numbers. Can't replace retiring civil servants because of cuts. Military Personnel and Civil Servants bust their asses for this country everyday and get crapped on by Congress!
@mfrost11 Shouldn't he like I don't know.... Be divorced FIRST before assaulting us with photos of him and the mistress!
@lauferlaw Flynn’s kid needs to stop running his pie hole and realize his father is keeping Junior out of prison.  Junior is dirty too daddy is at least being a man and accepting his fate!
@AndrewCMcCarthy Civil rights will be over turned with this nomination.  Everything people worked on gone.  What’s next? Telling me I can’t work because I am a woman.  Make me a Martha like in the Handmaid’s Tale.  The US is looking like Gilead just like the show!  Wake up people!  Vote!
@SpeakerRyan Welcome to Gilead courtesy of Ryan and Company.
@sendavidperdue @POTUS Under his Eye.....Turning us into Gilead from Handmaid's Tale.
@SenateMajLdr Coward.  Always hiding in your shell instead of doing what is right for the Country.
@TeaPainUSA We are royally screw Tea.  You know Turtlehead McConnell will ram this nomination down the Senate's throat to confirm.  This is such a bad episode of Handmaid's Tale.  We'll all be saying "Under his Eye" and women will have no rights.  People need to get out and vote in November.
@PalmerReport This is a bad episode of Handmaid's Tale.  Clown shoe Congress complicit in their actions.  ALL of them.
@missc0nstrued No kidding.  Gilead is upon us.
@SenateMajLdr You are a coward.  You put Party before Country.  You have lost this GOP Voter.
@SenShelby I have lost all respect for you.  You have lost my vote.
@realDonaldTrump @USNavy When will you visit the troops in Afghanistan?
@funder @TopRopeTravis oh dear lord.  Where in the hell did you get his law degree from?  A box of Cracker Jacks!  Rudy is an incompetent attorney who needs to be suspended and have an mental health examin ASAP!
@aliasvaughn Wow.  What is Rudy smoking!  That is some funny stuff!
@BillPalmer Will Cohen become the new John Dean?  This is getting interesting
@DrDenaGrayson @SenShelby @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yeah...Senator Shelby just lost my vote.  He put Party before Country.
@kylegriffin1 So are they going to investigate Melania too?  Seems she possible provided false information on her forms!
@amandablount2 Because they don’t want the world know they are being extremely naughty!
@AriFleischer You don't get to pick and chose crap.  You and the rest of the GOP own the crap storm.  You deal with the clean up from this mess.
@krassenstein What the hell is going on!  This is not Gilead or an episode of The Handmaid's Tale.  These Congressional morons can't even keep it in their damn PANTS!  They do not get to tell women what to do with their bodies or careers!
@NeilSteinberg She lost both legs serving her damn country!
@DearAuntCrabby Alex needs to put the tin foil hat and shower cap away.  He is talking like a man a few cards shy of a full deck.  He is a nut job.
@amandablount2 Take it easy and enjoy the cool AC.  I know my crew enjoyed the cool air.
@amandablount2 @TheExpanseWR Same here going to watch a Hunger Games movies
@amandablount2 How are you doing?
@AynRandPaulRyan Yep a friend of mine was at that gathering when it happened.
@AltUSPressSec One of the assholes is the Senator from Alabama.  Shelby who is afraid of hosting town halls and won’t respond to constituents
@CREWcrew He is retired military and knows better.  I know that I can't do this in my office!  Damn I get the reminder email every year and election!
@jdawsey1 How stupid is the staff!  The call should have been ended before it got that far.
@SpicyFiles Is Flynn’s son that stupid!  He is running his mouth and digg bigger holes.  His family needs to tell Jr to shut up! Or let the little greedy son run his mouth all the way to prison!  His kid is so stupid!  Yes the stupid is strong with Jr...very strong!
@bessbell WORSE!
@SenateMajLdr Hypocrite.  You are the problem.  I hope you are voted out of the majority.  We need people in Congress who work for the People NOT for Special Interest and Corporate Donors!
@PressSec Why do you continue to spread lies when presented with the truth!
@SpicyFiles Manafort should sit in jail until trial.  His legal counsel can drive their asses there and meet.  He committed crimes against the United States.  Let him sit until trial then he can be transferred to a Federal Prison when found guilty.  These dirty rats need to be locked up!
@SpeakerRyan They don't need you prayers.  They need you and Congress to grow a spine and do something about this.  You have the power to stop this but you do nothing.  Do the right thing and do right by the people of the USA.
@Robert_Aderholt @POTUS @USDA Bull.  This Tax Cuts and Job Act did not put more money in my pocket.  I didn't see ANYTHING from this cut.  All I am going to see is having to adjust my withholdings to ensure I can break even!  I already file single ZERO and still have to PAY the IRS each year!
@rolandscahill What was you first clue?  He and others are trying to vilify the agents of the FBI to protect guilty people.  Tells you were Jordan's loyalties lie.  Not with the oath he took to support the Constitution.
@SpeakerRyan You are a coward.  You cut SNAP to many military who use this.  You vilify Civil Servants who work hard to support the men and women of the military and the people of USA.  Who is paying you to betray the United States!  We want to know!
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan You and others are doing everything possible to kill this investigation.  What are you afraid of?  The truth that many of you are guilty of betraying the USA!  I think several of you don't want to find out the Truth about what happened.  You have betrayed the people of the USA!
@cathymcmorris How is this fair!  I look at my paystub and it shows I give the USA Government over 1200 A MONTH in TAXES!  I still have to pay the IRS.  Stop lying!  You also TAX my bonus!  I'm so tired of being middle class and getting taxes to death!  This was a tax cut for the top 1%!
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan This is an ACTIVE investigation.  This is going to jeopardize evidence.  Let Mueller do his work!  Just knock the crap off and let him do the work!
@RepMattGaetz I think he already asked those questions.  He REMOVED those involved.  I am so tired of you dragging the good agents of the FBI through the mud over the actions of the 1%.  99% are honest, loyal and good civil servants.
@CAPAction Welcome to Gilead.  Courtesy of McConnell and Company.  November I am hoping for a tide of change.  They are destroying the Checks and Balances.
@realDonaldTrump Why are you telling!
@SteveScalise @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yeah to screw over people with outdated mindsets. America is going to end up like Gilead in Handmaid’s Tale.  Country before Party!
@RepMattGaetz Do you ever do legislative work?  You spend more time on Twitter than doing the work of the people.  Why do people still elect you.
@ChuckGrassley You are a sell out.  How much dark money did you accept to be complacent!  You have put party before country.
@WestWingReport @realDonaldTrump This is unbelievable!  BMW, Mercedes and VW all have plants in the US employing thousands of US workers.  Shows how much POTUS and company are out of touch with real life!
@RepMattGaetz @RepAndyBiggsAZ Let Mueller complete the job and issue his report.  What are you afraid of?  The truth.  You behave like you have been caught with your hand in the cookie jar!  If this was another party it would be very different.  Hypocrite
@realDonaldTrump You have to stay out of it.
@realDonaldTrump Members of your OWN PARTY voted against the bill.  Look up the damn ROLL CALL!
@politico Here is hoping Mueller blessed off on the documents before release.
@TrueFactsStated Senator Shelby from Alabama is going.  I forget who the others are.  They are going with Bolton I understand.
@PressSec @POTUS Did you use the wrong social media account?  Think you are using the WRONG one.
@ShawleyCoker Awesome!
@ShawleyCoker Hi Shawley.  Tried to watch your YouTube video says it is blocked on copyright grounds
@SenShelby You are not serving the people of Alabama.  You only serve your donors.  Shame on you Country before Party!
@RepMattGaetz You would compromise an active criminal investigation for the documents!  Shame on you.
@LindseyGrahamSC How much did it cost for you to sell your soul to the devil!  You coward and spineless moron.
Help Megan Marshall take home $20,000 in cash and be featured in Muscle and Fitness Hers! https://t.co/Ls6nKcYDRq
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Do you realize some of those people could be part of the investigation and need to be protected.  Let all the investigations complete then allow the names to be revealed.
@SenTedCruz Grow a damn spine and do the right thing.  Stop being a moron do the right thing!
@amandablount2 All three?  Just saying
@JamilSmith @MalcolmNance @WhiteHouse Does this mean his wife and in laws are affected by this?
@ABCPolitics You don’t hand over documents in and active investigation !
@MeetThePress @chucktodd @KellyannePolls It is probably coming from that freak show Miller!  Maybe she needs to talk to him!
@MollyJongFast Miller is Riff-Raff from Rocky Horror Picture Show!
Only my dog can chew up an unopened bottle of water, chew a shaker cup AND my container of Fat Burner that I just purchased.  I love Raven Dog, but she can be one destructive pup.  (Not a product endorsement) https://t.co/OjbihZpnt1
@amandablount2 Miller that Riff-Raff Looking SOB is behind this horrible Immigration policy.  Someone needs to put him in his place or take him behind the woodshed and flog him.
@RVAwonk Powder Eggs and mystery meat with a side of powdered milk!
@foxandfriends @AlanDersh Manafort violated the terms of his BAIL!  That is why he gets to sit in jail till his trial!
@ericgarland I don't think it's going to be next door to NASA.  Don't think Facebook qualifies to be on a base.
@MollyJongFast I’m sorry what woman would want to have an affair with Rudy.  Sorry not enough booze or money to think about that!
@MalcolmNance Didn’t see anything about oversight too.  This agreement I think gave too much away?  This will bite us in the ass big time I feel.
@brianstelter What could possibly go wrong with the interview?  Everything starting with lies and brown-nosing by Hannity!
@bartongellman No thank you.  That USB probably has more bugs than a flea-bag hotel!
@ColMorrisDavis I like to call them Kremlin Barbie and Moscow Ken or is Jared the Toad Prince!
@anniekarni What is wrong with these people!  I have to hold on to crap that is 50 years old because of laws.
@SenatorCollins You and the rest of Congress need to grow a spine and handle this mess.  You and the flying circus monkeys need to get it together!
@Robert_E_Kelly Who is advising him?  A Golden Retriever!  There needs to be a competent adviser in the room.  Good god we are royally screwed!
@CREWcrew This is why I am passionate about Government Ethics and being good stewards of the Federal Governments money.  To prevent people like Pruitt, Ivanka and others from making it a mockery of ethics. The rest of the Federal Government comply.  She and others are not above the law.
@cathymcmorris @HouseGOP I did not see any benefit from this tax cut. Stop lying to the American People and call it what it is "Corporate Tax Welfare!"  Now there is a pending Trade War.  Goods and Materials care going to get more expensive thanks to the rampant stupidity with our leaders.
@karolcummins I have a swamp in the Desert to sell you too.  Putin cannot be trusted AT ALL!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP @SecPompeo What's next?  Telling me and my husband we can't have a room we reserved because we are an interracial couple?  Can't buy from this establishment because it goes against the shop owners religion!  This is so wrong in what you are doing.  What happened to Country before Party.
@fawfulfan Things are going to get expensive FAST!  Great
@DrDenaGrayson @karolcummins We’re not claiming him like Moore.
@kylegriffin1 LOL.   That will be interesting.  I don’t think NK can be trusted.
@BillPalmer I hope he gets hauled off to prison for that.  Hannity is a cancer!
@SenateMajLdr @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Have you found your spine?  Country Before Party!
@lauferlaw Hell now.  We don’t want them here in Alabama!  Pick another Federal Prison.
@realDonaldTrump Nixon said the same thing and then resigned.
@realDonaldTrump VA Choice is still screwing over my son who is a vet!
@amandablount2 We also ensured they were destroyed per regulation at the appropriate time.
@LouiseMensch @realDonaldTrump Dr Ronny is no longer there to dish out meds like tic tacs!
@Amy_Siskind This double standards is pissing me off. Normal Federal Workers would be gone if they pulled that stuff lying on SF-86.  No, those two are a risk and get one with all the damn red flags. Not to mention the dear Princess is violating the Hatch Act campaigning for Nunes!  It is BS!
@realDonaldTrump You can have it both ways.  You were briefed and chose to ignore it.
@amandablount2 I got my first tattoo in my 30’s and my other three in my early and late 40’s!
@amandablount2 Wow.  That person is and A-hole!
@amandablount2 Tattoos can be addictive.  I'm planning for a shoulder piece.
@amandablount2 I hate these double standards.  Normal Feds would be out of a damn job for a tenth of what that Frog Prince (Jared) lied about.
@ericgarland I stopped following the Hill when I learned who is on the board.  No wonder the news was becoming slanted.
@thehill Just lost a follower.  Thought you were unbiased but come to find out you are biased as hell in your reporting.
@RepDavidEPrice You know they are too afraid to do anything.  What are you going to do?
@thehill Fine Nunes I hope you receive a subpoena from Mueller to testify about your involvement.  You behave like a man who is guilty as hell.
@KenDilanianNBC You revealed this person endangering them.  Shame on you.
@RVAwonk Seems a NBC person ratted out the name.  This is just disgraceful.  This will damage the IC community
@RepMarkWalker @POTUS What is this a bad episode of the handmaid’s tale.  Are you going to punish women who can’t have children or chose not to have children! Who made you lord over what women can and cannot do with their bodies! This is a decision between the woman, their doctor and significant other
@HouseGOP @ConawayTX11 Are you going to say the same thing to the military who are on these programs.  Many are people already working!  Get your facts straight!  There are military who get WIC and food stamps.
@thehill Sadly KAC is probably in the category too.
@HouseGOP @DeptVetAffairs Why does my son have to wait 30 days to see a mental health counselor!  Why does he have to have medication prescribed from a stay at a non-VA hospital APPROVED by a VA doctor before filling at the clinic!  We need more medical personnel hired!
@realDonaldTrump I spent several hours at a VA Clinic with my son trying to get his medication filled from a stay at a Non-VA hospital.  They took several hours to approve the medication!  He will not see a mental health counselor till JUNE!  Need more medical personnel at the clinics!
@HouseGOP @ConawayTX11 There are active duty on SNAP!  For some military this is how they feed their families!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I've lost all respect for you Senator.  You are like the others Party before Country!  Grow a spine.
The VA you are horribly failing your Vets!
@kylegriffin1 So they can screw over federal retirees!  What is wrong with them
@RepMattGaetz I’m sick of Congress being paid off my big donors.
@aravosis This is why we need a State Department properly staffed to prevent moments like that. Barbie and Ken need to stay out of politics
@realDonaldTrump Get off Twitter and be with your WIFE as she recovers from SURGERY!
@Sarah_Boxer @NewDay @mschlapp Did Matt tell Mr. Steele the former RNC Chairman to suck it up buttercup and take the comment did at the CPAC event.  He and his wife are hypocrites
@SpeakerRyan @DeptVetAffairs Why is it going to take my son who is a vet nearly 5 months to get a damn appointment!  Oh some to get a VA rating.  My son is worried how much his hospital stay is going to cost him if not fully covered by the VA!
@GOP I don’t remember you morons confirming her and Jared to be a cabinet member?
@MSNBC Who made Jared the Secretary of State.  Don’t remember him being nominated and confirmed by the Senate.  He doesn’t have a proper security clearance.  He needs to go run his real estate company and stay out of politics!  He can take his wife with him in the process
@kylegriffin1 Instead of spending time with the mother of his son.  He is playing golf.  His priorities are very flawed!
@thehill What BS is she slinging now,
@SpeakerRyan @Heritage @KayColesJames Cutting benefits to children?  You benefited from Social Security Benefits to fund college!  Grow a spine!
@WestWingReport Why in the Hell is Ivanka there?  I am a military spouse and I'm disgusted that she's sitting with the military spouses.
@amandablount2 I love it here!
@washingtonpost He behaves like Trailer Trash!
@alt_labor Ryan is a MORON. We work to keep the mission afloat with these cuts!	Three years of pay freezes.  Years of congress calling us lazy.  We kept going doing the mission for the people of the United States and THIS is how they repay us!  Congress get a spine!
@alt_labor I bust my ass everyday doing the work of THREE people because of cuts! I'm watching good people LEAVE because of these cuts! You want to bring pension in line with private industry! MOST DON'T HAVE RETIREMENT BENEFITS SPEAKER RYAN!  Congress you are idiots!
@treasonstickers I've NEVER heard of that many amendments on a financial disclosure.  This would have the ethics attorney I work for asking serious questions and a report to higher ups on this.
@cathymcmorris Really?  My big savings was eaten up by Higher tax rate, increase in health care premium AND increase in my portion of retirement contributions!  Not to mention, you and the rest of congress call us LAZY. Take off the rose colored glasses.  I'm tired of paying the way for others!
@amandablount2 @WilburRoss What is wrong with these baboons!  They want us to feel some pain!  I look at my damn pay check every two weeks to see just how much Uncle Sam takes out and they want to take away my god damn retirement that I'm paying for!  Ross and company are so out of touch with reality.
@bethreinhard We just want Moore to GO AWAY!
Only in Alabama can  this shit be happening!  Unbelievable.  Why can't this man just GO AWAY!	https://t.co/TYXxRc5x5E
@RepSwalwell Yeah.  After off setting it with increased premiums wasn’t much moron.
@TeaPainUSA WTF!  Some of these people he's looking to raise the rent ALREADY WORK!  Is this a dream and the village idiots are running wild?  Carson is the ring leader of village idiots!
@mschroed99 @realDonaldTrump Don't know what to think anymore.  Just trying to hold on tight and hope we don't fall off a CLIFF!
@realDonaldTrump Online websites DO collect taxes!  Oh my god.  Do you not ready your staff's briefings!
@FoxNews @KatiePavlich @IngrahamAngle If you mean getting a whole $60 dollars a month is an increase.  Keeping smoking whatever you are smoking.  That raise was off-set by increased Healthcare premiums, Retirement Contributions and oh TAXES!
@AngrierWHStaff I'll believe this when I actually see it in my paycheck and taxes!  All I know is no matter how much i withhold, I still owe!
@aravosis What the hell is this?  Better Call Saul shady practice of law!  Geez...now I know where the writers of the show get their material!  From Cohen’s behavior!
@amandablount2 He looks more like Holy Crap I didn't sign up for this!
@JessicaTaylor Caption this.....oh my Fxxck my life Kelly is saying.
@ZekeJMiller @AP Where is this money coming from to pay off all these people?  Time to follow the money.
@krassenstein Good god.  Are they trying to dig the hole a little more DEEPER!  I keep hearing the Obstruction Alarm on All of this!
@amandablount2 Oh gosh.  Take care of yourself!
@kylegriffin1 Geez..that might lead to a damn GJ visit.  How stupid are these morons!
@WestWingReport Wonder which intern had to make a run to the Golden Arches!
@AltUSPressSec For all the money in the world.  He can't find a tailor to alter the suit to make it look like it properly fits!  Looks like some of the men where I work who buy cheap and look cheap!
@Amy_Siskind I’ve heard of having a fire sale this is taking it to the extreme!
@ABC Wow.  She's getting high on whatever BS is being pushed!
@RVAwonk @TwitterSupport @jack I unfollowed them too.  Don’t know is they are aware of it yet.
How I spent my evening.  Trying to tough it out with a tension headache and had to throw in the towel.  So rest, dark room and meds.  Stress does a number on you.
@lauferlaw Poor Manafort.  Guess he should have call Saul Goodman!  🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/Fy8qp0Ucwz
Star Wars movies and Halo Top Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Life is good.
@TheRickyDavila He has enough money to have a tailor alter his suits to fit right.  That suit looks horrible on him.
@AngrierWHStaff Nope.  It's Five O'Clock somewhere!
@RedTRaccoon Did the President ever think about reading the Damn Constitution!  There are rules about this.
6.  My point is.  If you can't back it up with truth then don't say the shit at all!  Facts are very important! End
5.  Voters need to take the time to research shit.  Research the shit and they would find the truth. God I get so tired of people saying half-truths and nothing to back it up. Of drinking the Fox News Kool-Aid or some of those other stations that have the Conspiracy Kool-Aid!
4.  People.  Wake the hell up!  Do a little research.  I'm not a Liberal or Conservative because I research the information to make an informed decision. I will download the files and information from FEC, OGE and other public records to find the truth.
3.  All it takes people is doing a search to find out the truth.  God, in my regular job.  I have to do this all the time call a Bar Association or State Supreme Court to verify someone's status.  I hate it when people rely on news from Fox News, InfoWars etc and believe it.
2.  The response was "Well Obama was disbarred!" If my memory serves me correct.  He retired from practicing law to avoid the crap load of money associated with keeping a license active when you're not practice.  Fun when you search you find ALL this Conspiracy Theories about it.
1.  I am so tired of people NOT researching facts.  People who blindly listen to conspiracy theories.  There was a discussion with the hubby about Special Elections and voting.  I mentioned Roy Moore who was removed as Chief Justice   Because he couldn't follow the rules.
@thehill His Campaign Managers should be afraid of Mueller in the rear view mirror.
@Newsweek I wonder if his brother ripped him about the stupid tweet!
Lazy Easter Sunday.  Ham is cooked, cake frosted.  Sweet potatoe cooking.  Only thing left is kale to be cookie.
@SpicyFiles I call her husband Toad Prince!  Barbie and her toad need to see the inside of a cell.
@amyfiscus Says the man who blackmailed his sister.  Daddy Kushner STILL went to prison!
@seanspicer @KCkid @smerconish @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne I am middle class and I am tired of owing every god damn year to the IRS!  No matter how much extra I withhold!
@realDonaldTrump It’s called bulk shipping discount.
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to go after Walmart, Target, Barnes and Noble etc for abusing USPS!  What about UPS?  Moron
@realDonaldTrump USPS is used by ALL companies!  That is How they make their money!  USOS is losing money because of the amounts the pay in pensions and being robbed blind by congress.  USPS GENERATES money through package delivery, stamps etc!  Oh and money orders.
@thehill Third year in a row have to pay the IRS.  I have the maximum withheld for taxes Single zero.  Still I have to pay.  Means I will have to have extra money withheld from paycheck to try and break even in 2018!  They knew exactly what the hell they were doing.
@thehill By the time you factor in increase healthcare premiums, increases to employee retirement contributions, and taxes there is no increase it is a decrease!
@krassenstein He would have been investigated and impeached!  Bunch of hypocrites in congress at the moment
@RVAwonk @SteveSchmidtSES I thought POTUS hired only the best?  Nope Better Call Saul Attorneys, family (Nepotism Anyone), and all around creeps.   They ones that make me want to shower with Comet and a Brillo pad to scrub the extra strength creep stench off!
@SpicyFiles @realDonaldTrump I donated to the fund.  I think it was wrong!  he gave the federal government 20 plus years.  You don't treat career civil servants like that!
@RepStephenLynch @Morning_Joe Congress left their spines at the door.  There is no Oversight just a bunch of compromised morons!
@lauferlaw @PressSec When do we cross from colluding to say conspiracy?  That is what this case is looking more and more like.
@Kris_Sacrebleu I am one that did not benefit from this "Increase"  It was off-set by taxes, Insurance Premiums or and increased contributions to my retirement!
@SpicyFiles @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I'm thinking of an Eagle's song that would best describe Sarah Sanders.  Her nose has to be all the way to California by now with the lies.
@kelly2277 Sounds like another "Better Call Saul" attorney!
@lauferlaw No the WH Counsel is sniffing cans of PAINT!
@kylegriffin1 Say it isn't so!  The Toad Prince is really a swamp frog enriching himself while working for his father in law?  Some one needs to show him and his Kremlin Barbie the door.  They need to go back to NYC!
@mattyglesias Similar thing happened in Alabama with the Governor.  Used campaign $$$ to hide an affair.  He resigned plea guilty to the campaign violation too.
@CREWcrew What is her actual experience?  She is not qualified to negotiate anything!  This is Nepotism on steroid!  I don't care if it's a paid or unpaid position.  She doesn't belong there or anywhere!
@WestWingReport @60Minutes Wonder what the First Lady will be up to?  Like to be the fly on the wall for that!
@pptsapper You have people leaving Federal Service!  Congress and the WH want to strip benefits that would attract good workers.  These people now are joining Private Corporations.  Invest in the workers and they will give you 100% or more in return!  Treat them like garbage they leave!
@SpicyFiles True...Forgot about Cohen who's slithering in the shadows.
@SpicyFiles Hence why he's trying to hire a "Better Call Saul!" type attorney.  The type of attorney who is one or two steps away from being disbarred for unethical behaviors.
@DrDenaGrayson Toensing I thought had a massive conflict?
@TheRickWilson @911CORLEBRA777 I thought there was no funds in the spending bill for the “Precious” wall?  Trump needs to back away from the Big Mac’s
@funder I think he is going to do something really stupid to tank the Stormy 60 Minute piece.
@lauferlaw I fear Trump will pardon Flynn Senior to distract from Stormy’s interview!
@20committee His possible new attorney’s wife had a conflict she was/is representing someone who took a plea.  No one wants to be associated with a client like Trump.  Doesn’t listen to Counsel to shut up and stop tweeting. Doesn’t pay them on time and lies about everything!
@jasoninthehouse Maybe he is but not saying a god damn word about it.
@_NotFakeNews_ Someone please adopt his dog.  I feel sorry for the dog dressed like that.
@thehill I hope none of these people are career civil servants.  Could run afoul with the law.
@mflynnJR I really wish people would stop painting the entire FBI as bad.  Many of the people are loyal and dedicated to the FBI Mission and duty.  Do not paint them with the same brush as McCabe. They are career civil servants loyal to the Constitution of the United States.
@DevinNunes Good god man.  Give it a break.  You made a report after reviewing a SMALL portion of the evidence and interviewing people who would sell granny down the river to protect their asses.  WAKE UP!
@realDonaldTrump If you are truly innocent, why do you feel you need to tweet about this every two seconds.  Shut up listen to your legal counsel and wait for the final report.  You tweet like a guilty person!
@realDonaldTrump Most firms what to keep their reputations on the positive.  They will not take on clients who don't listen!  Stay off Twitter and listen to your legal counsel.  You are digging a bigger hole!
@krassenstein Those people took an oath to the Constitution NOT to a person.  When will those morons in the WH realized this.  These moronic people are what is driving loyal civil servants out!  Mueller is coming to bring back the Rule of Law.  The good pleas are gone by now.
@CREWcrew What is wrong with these people?  Do they not have an Ethics Attorney to say "Knock it off Your wife is not an Employee of the CIA"  Between Zinke, Pruett, Mnuchin, Carson and Now Pompeo.  They seem to be all enriching themselves!
@CREWcrew Is it me or does Kellyanne look like the creature in Alien!
@JohnGuandolo @realDonaldTrump @JewhadiTM @THEHermanCain @1776Stonewall @TomFitton @AmbJohnBolton @DHSgov Hypocrite!
@amperssand @realDonaldTrump He thinks the cost of Transgender treatment is too much but overlooks the Military Treatment Facilities spend 84 Million on Boner Pill prescriptions!	https://t.co/tQk72dSiLm
@maggieNYT Who is leaving now?  GEN Kelly?  Need a score card to keep up.  Only hires the best?  More like rocks stuck in the 1950's or family who don't know crap about the government!
@GovMikeHuckabee You flaming hypocrite.  Won't condemn a man who betrayed his marriage vows on multiple occasions.  If this was someone else from the opposite part you would be out with torches and pitchforks demanding Justice.  Just be quiet you don't help matters!
@cmclymer This makes me mad. Department of Defense Healthcare spends close to 84 MILLION on ED on boner pills. The WH is all up in arms and mad over the 2-8 million spent on medication and other services for trangender personnel who volunteered to join! They deserve to stay!
@AdamsFlaFan @TheWeek 84 Million on ED Pills ALONE for the Department of Defense compared to 2-8 Million for Transgender personnel.  COME ON!
@AdamsFlaFan @TheWeek Give me a flipping break! Military Treatment Facilities spend more money on Viagra pills than the medication for Transgender personnel.	https://t.co/tQk72dSiLm
@CREWcrew Convenient that the family clothing line is exempt from this tariff and now they are saying foreign workers are needed for their clubs?  What special skill does one need to be wait staff, cooks etc?  They are not even trying to practice what they preach.
@Bipartisanism Code word for playing golf?
@SpicyFiles @maddogpac @ushadrons Where I work he would be part of the Wacko File!
@SpicyFiles @maddogpac @ushadrons Oh my god?  Where did that nutcase come from?  I would not hire him if he was the last Attorney standing.
@LouiseBagshawe Everything that could go wrong WILL go wrong with that move.  He has to stop listening to the hamsters in his head!
@WilDonnelly Of Course how convenient of him to leave the family clothing line OFF the list.
@KremlinTrolls Ted Cruz looks like the Grandfather from the Munsters!

@DrDenaGrayson @aliasvaughn @TheRickWilson Refresh my memory.....Wasn't Gotti finally sent to prison by a certain Robert S Mueller, III?
@missc0nstrued @LouiseMensch @LouiseBagshawe @thespybrief Yeah I blocked him too
@amandablount2 Oh I think we will be royally fucked.  That is not how you treat a General Officer.  If I were the Secretary of Defense I would be pissed at this treatment.
@NBCNews Does that include the trump clothing line?
@cnni So a congressman was offended and like a snowflake got the kid suspended?  What will this Congressman do if it was an adult?  Get them fired?  Thin skinned congressman who can’t take the heat.

@SenateMajLdr Be a god damn leader and Protect Robert Mueller, The Special Counsel! Grow a set of BALLS and a SPINE and protect the damn Constitution!  History will judge you on the action or inaction you do.
@amandablount2 Thanks.  I love Huntsville.  Reminds me of my hometown only larger!  Things are calm for now but I know the storms will be here soon.
@amandablount2 Amanda I am and I’m stuck trying to get off base
@amandablount2 Yeah I'm headed home after my meeting.  Our base is possibly closing here.
@JoyAnnReid Flynn isn’t off the hook.  If I was a betting person...I would wager the DoD and the Army are probably looking at that carefully.
@JuddLegum @MalcolmNance The rest of the GOP have been neutered.
@justinjm1 What was their first clue?  Systematically destroying the constitution or praises dictators
@amandablount2 That Keebler Elf Sessions is a moron.  Is he going to change the federal statutes too?
@JasonMillerinDC Just like Nunes selective use of facts to spin it.  Wait for the actual report then make an educated opinion.  This will still be litigated.
@SpeakerRyan iheart radio bankruptcy reorganization, Toys r Us shutting down liquidating, Harley Davidson lay offs, Carrier lay offs, Walmart closing Sams Club sites.  Corporations doing buy backs to CEO’s.  Workers Screwed by you and others.  Coward
@DevinNunes @JesseBWatters @WattersWorld Liar liar pants on fire.  You are a Benedict Arnold!  You made a report off evidence you did not view!  I hope you get voted out you.
@HouseInSession Pretty freaking weak coming from Spineless as Hell @SpeakerRyan.  If he had a spine he would be leading the charge to protect Mueller.  Instead what is Ryan doing.  Hiding like a pansy.  Hope Ryan ultimately gets voted out of office.

@Lawrence Yet Sessions still has a job!  How is that freaking fair!
@RandPaul You are the biggest hypocrite walking the planet.  You sit there and will do nothing to protect Mueller.  How much Russian Dressing was donated to your campaign. You are a spineless coward. All talk and won’t back anything up unless it helps YOU. Save the Constitution and the USA
@mkraju @jaketapper @LindseyGrahamSC isn't going to do a damn thing.  They are so afraid to do what is right for America. We know the GOP took money to keep their mouths shut.  They lost this moderate GOP voter because they FAILED to do what is right.  They placed party before country!
@TeaPainUSA I'm tired of the constant attacks on Career Civil Servants, Law Enforcement and The Intelligence Community.  At what point do the gloves come off and the shit starts hitting the fan.  There is only so much we can take when we do our jobs faithfully and with great honor.
@waltshaub This is ridiculous!  What's next for this administration?  Remove ALL Merit Protections for civil servants and remove them if they don't agree?  So sick of the career civil servants being targeted.  I happen to be one of them AND a Veteran!
@CNNPolitics For what?  The people in that district ACTUALLY want change!  I am sick of people not owning up to their mistakes.  The GOP had a weak candidate.
@jasoninthehouse @FoxNews @FoxNewsSunday @TGowdySC @DickDurbin You Benedict Arnold who sold your soul to the devil.  You are part of the disinformation business.  You don't realize you helped to create this mess.
@mflynnJR What is wrong with everyone?  This is not the America I raised my hand to defend!  I took an oath to the CONSTITUTION of the United States?  Not to a party or person!  We let the laws and the Constitution speak?
@realDonaldTrump Please stop talking.  This makes you sounds like a guilty person!  You're only digging a deeper hole for yourself.
@realDonaldTrump If you are innocent stop behaving like you are guilty as HELL!  Shut up and stop digging the whole deeper!
@JasonMillerinDC You also don’t make it appear to be political in nature.  He is a career civil servant with protections.  He could take this to court.  He could win.  This sends a bad message.  It should have been handled better.
@KatrinaPierson Do us all a favor. Shut up and the career civil servants handle this.  People like you is why why we can’t recruit talent.
@realDonaldTrump They covered up the truth that is what Nunes and his kind did.  If you claim to be innocent then shut up and let Mueller finish his work in the hopes to prove you innocent.  You are behave like a guilty as hell person.  Shut up and stay off Twitter about the Mueller probe!
@realDonaldTrump You have complicit morons who are tarnishing the great work of the men and women FBI.  He has protections under MDPB over this firing and they will allow him to retire
@tarapalmeri You don't do this to a career federal worker.  This was done for clear political reasons.

@PressSec If there is a loss of jobs due to tariff's that will affect the numbers
@CLewandowski_ A tariff will make purchasing a car more expensive, beverages, food etc MORE expensive.  Companies that build pipelines will cost more. This was NOT a smart move it was a stupid move. There are not enough steel plants in the US to keep up with production.
@realDonaldTrump How many jobs will be lost with a tariff on steel?  How much higher will it cost to purchase a car, food (canned items), beverages (canned), aluminum foil?  Every Hershey Chocolate bars uses a foil wrapper!  This was not a smart move.  Should have listened to Mr. Gary Cohn!

@Alt_Spicerlies @TheRickWilson Normal people of the Federal Government would be fired, but this WH is not normal.  If he can't secure a permanent secret the most basic of the security clearance then he is really screwed.
@Alt_Spicerlies We still love you mic
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Newsflash you all are cowards!  Country before Party!
@ALT_uscis If he screws up he'll still be up the creek without a paddle.  Gates is still not out of the woods YET. If he doesn't behave he'll be back in the same boat as Manafort.
@Lady_Sisyphus22 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Someone should ask how his in laws came to the US.  My guess Family Reunification
@funder Got it was like watching a ungrateful child.  How immature!
@RogueSNRadvisor Really?  Good Lord.
@ChrisLu44 @politico Jared doesn't get a pass on this. Others in his situation have access revoked then removed from their JOBS! He should get the same treatment. He will set a precedent of DOUBLE STANDARDS if not removed! Tired of idiots like him getting a slap on the wrist and others see jail time.
@MollyJongFast God Ivanka is a huge media whore.  I wonder is she was wearing her overpriced frocks for free advertisements.
@AngrierWHStaff Nah....he must have skipped US History 101 in school.  He would know about the Interment camps,
@Alt_Spicerlies Hey mic.  Any juicy news out there?
@DevinNunes @NRO Benedict Arnold.  What are you afraid of?  Who has dirt on you to make you betray your country.  Who has donated dirty money to you.  Hypocrite
@chrisgeidner Big Mac and a Diet Coke in exchange for the phone.  Maybe toss in some Arby’s
@funder That is just tacky as hell.  What kind of trailer trash is the family!
@brianstelter @realDonaldTrump Maybe his attorneys told him to shut up before digs a deeper hole.  Another theory some one hid the phone!
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @apsFYI Haven't seen mine drop yet.  Liars!
@kylegriffin1 He is making a HUGE Mockery of the Security Clearance process. If a regular federal worker did the same thing, they would be out of a job. Same standards, he should have never been given an interim in the first place. Send him and Ivanka packing to NYC.
@JoyAnnReid Those two don't belong there.  Thanks to the stupidity of their appointments, people who have a security clearance will have to go through MORE hurdles because of those two wannabees.
@RadioFreeTom He was a problem in uniform.  Instead of them doing something they promoted his ass.  You know the signs were there everyone ignored them.  Flynn dug himself in this hole.
@DevinNunes Benedict Arnold.  Sound the country for what?  Just resign.
@Alt_Spicerlies @CREWcrew I think it is completely embarrassing.  She has no experience in anything for the position.  She and her husband are in it for themselves.  They would not have gotten an interim if they were normal federal workers. They should be shown the damn door.  They need to be escorted out
@JRubinBlogger This is what happens when the idiots come to town. They didn't listen to the experts who said NO. Ivanka and Jared should have never been allowed to step foot in the WH as staff. They should have never been given interim security clearances also. The whole thing stinks!
@RVAwonk They didn't provide the pop-up picture book to ease of understanding!
@thehill On what planet would General's say that?  They are more worried about ensuring the troops have the equipment needed for the mission.
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump It what planet or universe is Jared "Toad Prince" Kushner qualified to be an Ambassador?  He is not qualified to walk my dog!
@Alt_Spicerlies Oh dear.
@Alt_Spicerlies @Policy @TwitterSafety @TwitterSupport I don’t get it.  Twitter has some screwball rules.
@AngrierWHStaff Something has to be done.  The behaviors of Kushner will be felt for years! He and other bad actors make it worse.  His behaviors will add another damn layer on the the already long process of a clearance. Kushner should not have a clearance and should be escorted out of a job!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @OpIndia_com You are the biggest hypocrite on the planet.
@essenviews Enough is enough. why are these morons allowed to thumb their noses at Government Ethics while the rest of the Federal Government obeys!  Wake the hell up OGE and do your JOB!
@thehill I think I’m going to be sick.  Why is Gorka allowed on TV?  What is his purpose?  He must be the village idiot!
@kylegriffin1 Lets not forget she was married to a man who was sent to federal prison for a host of crimes.  That divorce was finalized in 2013!  She is not princess that woman has a black heart and is cold as ice. I'm surprised she can still practice law!
@Billbrowder Why is this man still a congressman still?  He keeps popping up like some damn cockroach every time when it comes to meetings with the Russians!
@amandablount2 Take it easy and rest up.
@WestWingReport So who made the McDonald's run or Arby's run?
@Alt_Spicerlies @IvankaTrump I dislike her and her Toad Prince JARED!
@DearAuntCrabby A lot of things could go wrong.
@thehill Oh god.  We already have one.  Someone in the WH should tell him that.
@DLoesch Sold your soul to the devil to lie.
I really should be sleep but I am not.  Up watching Netflix and having Ramen noodle cup.  Damn dog won’t come inside.
@RepMattGaetz I receive a small increase AFTER healthcare premiums were raised along with increased contributions for retirement.  I saw 36 dollar increase
@Alt_Spicerlies @ChiefPGPD @PGPDNews I have a huge question and I hope people can answer.  Is Gorka a naturalized citizen or legal resident.  If is a legal resident why hasn't he been sent packing.  This man has a warrant out of Hungary for his ARREST!
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @nbc You were baited by a headline.  Come on.  Read the damn story FIRST!
@oliverdarcy @SebGorka Okay is the crumbs at the bottom of the bag.  Gorka is a poser and mouth breather!
@oliverdarcy @SebGorka He things he's all that and a bag of chips.  Well Gorka are the crumbs at the bottom of the bag.
@Alt_Spicerlies @marcorubio @BillNelsonJrFL @RepTedDeutch Has anyone called Rubio a Coward yet!
So watching this townhall in Florida.  Rubio is getting throttled by a father who lost his daughter.  This father is angry as hell.  He did not come out and say it but he looks like he wanted to call Rubio a COWARD!
@ColMorrisDavis Clearly the two moron's are the danger.  Not the woman.  Moral values have gone side-ways in Florida!
@AngrierWHStaff What hasn't he branded!  Now his shirts?  Dare I say.  Is he going to auction these shirts off to the highest bidder?  Orange Spray Tan on the collar included with your bid!
@DevinNunes @FDRLST Just resign.  You are not working for the people of California.
@thehill You hold others in the executive branch to one standard and the WH to another.  Sorry, if the investigation says the person is not to be given a permanent clearance.  I'm sorry have a nice day you're fired. Don't care who they are related to.
@CREWcrew They (White House) will find a way to keep Jared and Ivanka on.
@Alt_Spicerlies @Reuters @OfficeGovEthics I’m calling Bullshit.  Toad Prince and his kremlin barbie but go!
@kylegriffin1 Sorry Jared, doesn't work like that.  If the policy is no permanent clearance no access.  Sucks to be you.
@DearAuntCrabby Rudy is probably wondering if he can cut a deal with Mueller.  Rats are leaving the sinking ship FAST!
Well today has been a some what good day
@Alt_Spicerlies Looks like Mueller has been very busy.  Who's next?
@SpeakerRyan Coward!
@lauferlaw @AddieWoolf He's not behaving like one.  That is the problem.
@lauferlaw Will it be enough to toss Toad Prince (Kushner) and Barbie (Ivanka) out for not having a permanent clearance?  Or will Daddy save them and keep them on?
@lauferlaw Let us not forget.  Majority Leader McTurtle (aka McConnell) wouldn't allow then President Obama to make a comment so close to the election on this too!
@KatrinaPierson At least Bill Gates pays his taxes.  Unlike others in the WH.
@seanspicer @JasonMillerinDC At least Bill Gates PAYS his taxes.
@realDonaldTrump Ask the Majority Leader !cConnell.  He clearly stopped the WH for making a statement
@RepRubenGallego @SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan is on a fundraising tour in Florida.
@tedcruz @mike_pence You are a damn coward!
@VP You are the typical hypocritical Christian.  You twist the bible for your view.
@foxandfriends McConnel said NO we want do that.  This is on the majority leader
@realDonaldTrump What are you 5?  Grow up!
@CREWcrew Brian France has been running NASCAR in the ground ever since he took over for his daddy.
@Alt_Spicerlies Baby Flynn is going to find himself in the same boat as Daddy.  Daddy Flynn is probably hoping the Army doesn't throw the book at him over his guilty plea.
@marcorubio How much money has the NRA paid you to look the other way with Gun Laws?  You and the rest of Congress have failed to do your job!  How many more families need to be torn apart because Congress can't do their JOBS!
@brianstelter @realDonaldTrump Nope.  Too many pages.  It's not a PowerPoint presentation with pretty graphics and simple sentences.
@realDonaldTrump Let Mueller FINISH his investigation!  Listen to your counsel and shut up!
@realDonaldTrump What are you FIVE!  Act your age PLEASE
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump These indictments didn't, but what about the others still waiting to be unsealed?  Who are the others who were involved.  This is only the beginning.
@realDonaldTrump The money was Iran's that the US had SEIZED!
@realDonaldTrump Good grief.
@realDonaldTrump It just means these 13 unsealed do not.  The others MAY have Americans.  Again if you did nothing wrong then shut up and let Mueller complete his investigation and report.
@DevinNunes @LeeSmithDC @FDRLST Shut up Benedict Arnold. You betrayed your country by taking blood money.
@RepDeSantis How much money did the NRA give you?  What have you and congress done to prevent these?
@SaysHummingbird @TyHyCHI Barbie and the Toad Prince (Jared) need to pack up and head back to NYC!  They have no business in the White House.
@PalmerReport They have more scandals that the Kardashian’s!
@GovMikeHuckabee Uh no....talk to MCConnell who had a hand in this too.
@shanvav I heard it loud and clear other indictments may have Americans named.  Just not the 13 issued on Friday.  This is getting good make the rats squirm.   Some rats are singing tell all the dirt on them.
@jasoninthehouse Hypocritical moron.  You lack a spine.
@marcorubio Why do they still elect you? You have been worthless and complicit.  Who has been donating to your campaign? Who has paid you to destroy the USA for profit?  Grow a spine country before party.  You work for the people not corporations.
@seanhannity @seanspicer Wake the hell up!  Stop spreading lies and conspiracy theories.  Read the damn indictments
@counterchekist Well looks like Paul Manafort is up shit creek without a paddle!  Mueller is closing in.  Show me the money laundry trail and it will lead to the head Rat.
@maggieNYT If that Toad Kushner and his Barbie Wife were DOD employees they would be out of a job on the lying on the SF 86 ALONE!  Those two have no business in the WH giving advice on anything.  Send them packing back to NY with the rest of the Trailer Trash Family.
@CREWcrew Why is this Toad Kushner still there?  It's very apparent he will not get a permanent clearance and can't seem to file his OGE 278 right.  If he were a regular Federal Worker he would be out of a job and facing charges.  Why is the WH using double standards.  Kushner needs to go.
@counterchekist I've been trying to watch who follows me closely.  I don't have many followers but Watch for the odd ducks.
@newtgingrich @facebook You are part of the divide in America.  Stop gaslighting everything.
@DevinNunes @WashTimes God You can be so annoying.  Just resign.  Your turned your back on the American people with your complicit, conspiracy ways.  How much money was given to you to betray the People.
@kylegriffin1 Will Kremlin Barbie and her Toad Prince be included or will Daddy overrule GEN Kelly?
@EricTrump God why do you ignore the advice of counsel and keep your mouth shut!  You are just feeding investigators more and more useful information.  Morons
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump My god.  Why can’t you list to your attorney and shut the hell up!  Dude you are digging yourself into a bigger hole!
@KatrinaPierson Oh for freaking god.  Stop the gaslighting.  You are part of the problem.
@KatrinaPierson @RepAdamSchiff Do us all a favor and shut up.  We don’t need you gaslighting all the damn time.
@JRubinBlogger There is always a "Patient Zero" who facilitated this.  That person will remain a secret for a very long time.
@politico How many bills the the Florida Governor sign making it easier for guns to be purchased?  He needs to get his own house in order before he goes barking at the damn Big Dogs!  The FL Governor is a moron and hypocrite.
@BillPascrell @GOP How many in the GOP took money that was tainted.  Tainted as in Russian money to shut them up.  That is what we want to know.  Is this why the GOP has been soft on the WH!
@Alt_Spicerlies @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump As some one who has a clearance.  This pisses me off so much.  Double standards for DOD and the WH.  Barbie and her Toad Prince need to be sent packing back to NY.
@mitchellreports You know Daddy will arrange to keep his Princess and her Toad Prince on staff regardless of what GEN Kelly says.
@DevinNunes Just shut up.  You and others are part of this mess too.
@dodi70 @Alt_Spicerlies @ericgarland @LouiseMensch @ninaandtito @traciemac_Bmore @TheRickWilson @aliasvaughn @WendySiegelman @AngrierWHStaff @TrueFactsStated I totally forgot about Mr. Turtle (aka McConnell), oh and that freaking Keebler Elf Sessions!  They all took the money to be complicit in their behaviors.
@Evan_Rosenfeld Still means Barbie and Ken (Ivanka and Jared) will remain with an interim.  That is some horse crap.  They should be given the pink slip too.
@costareports So Kremlin Barbie and Ken (AKA Ivanka and Jared) get a free pass.  Their investigations started January 2017.  that is some Horse Crap!
@Alt_Spicerlies @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump So is Jared and Ivanka going to get a pink slip.  I'm sorry others comply with the rules and get a final adjudication in a timely manner.  Those two do not need to be in the White House or touching sensitive materials.  They make everyone who has a clearance look bad.  Fire them!
@keeper_of_inns @Alt_Spicerlies @ericgarland @LouiseMensch @ninaandtito @traciemac_Bmore @TheRickWilson @aliasvaughn @WendySiegelman @AngrierWHStaff @TrueFactsStated Is this person the new Deep Throat.  Inquiring minds would like to know.  For now.  I am going to enjoy the wonderful.
@JuddLegum Yeah POTUS needs to step away from the Big Mac.  It's making him talk like a Crazed Junk Food Junkie!
@keeper_of_inns @Alt_Spicerlies @ericgarland @LouiseMensch @ninaandtito @traciemac_Bmore @TheRickWilson @aliasvaughn @WendySiegelman @AngrierWHStaff @TrueFactsStated So....Who is the person who we can call "Patient Zero".  That person needs drinks paid for life!
@mkraju @KateBennett_DC Right....That is code for.  I don't want to be near my husband with a ten foot pool.
@Alt_Spicerlies @ericgarland @LouiseMensch @ninaandtito @traciemac_Bmore @TheRickWilson @aliasvaughn @WendySiegelman @AngrierWHStaff @TrueFactsStated This is getting good.  Makes you wonder who on the Trump team was in the thick of this storm and how much money was funneled into the GOP.  We all know money was flowing to Ryan and company.
@Alt_Spicerlies You tell them Spicy...You're on fire today!
@SpeakerRyan You are a spineless Coward who will not force the President to put sanctions in place.  Resign! You know you too money from them.
@realDonaldTrump Stay off Twitte.  Stop digging the hole a little deeper!
@RepSwalwell Well the President is already spinning the story.
@benjaminwittes Yes.  reading materials for the weekend!!!!!
@tedcruz Is that before or after you were paid off by the NRA!  You talk a very good game but you're weak to do what is right
@DrDenaGrayson Welcome to my world.  That is me everyday with what I deal with.
@jaketapper @ChuckGrassley POTUS relaxed the rule on this.  He made it easier for people with Mental Illness to PURCHASE guns.  Nice spin Senator Grassley.
@RepMattGaetz Moron!
@MSNBC Senator POTUS repealed the provision of the law that made this harder!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS How about this. Enforce the current laws, expand the scope of background checks, make it harder for people with mental illness to purchase firearms, expand waiting periods for people to purchase firearms and punish gun store owners who violate the law.
@realDonaldTrump Pointing fingers and name calling is not the answer.  How are more comprehensive background checks, more mental health facilities for treating people.  Even better enforcing the current laws!
@marcorubio How much money did you receive from the NRA?   Do something to prevent these tragic events.
@ColMorrisDavis @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @Morning_Joe My god.  Cohen and company yell and scream they did nothing wrong.  Why are they behaving like they are guilty as hell. How is Cohen still an attorney with this behavior.
@MaddowBlog Bullshit!  What are they afraid of.  Do their damn jobs!
@maggieNYT I wonder where he got the 130k?  I bet you a lot of Russian Water(aka Vodka) it came from someone else
@Alt_Spicerlies What is wrong with the White House!  They scream But Her Email!  Susan Rice is CYA on the email.  Then reports WH staff removes docs from a SCIF!  The are a bunch of moron running the WH!
@Snowden You are the reason it takes nearly a year to hire people!
@KellyannePolls @jaketapper Make a stand and support.
@AshaRangappa_ I wonder if Flynn has Nunes hands in the Russian cookie jar.  Part of Flynn’s deal is to cooperate to the fullest or risk having the book thrown at time..
@DevinNunes Benedict Arnold.
RT @krassenstein: Who is the real 'stable genius' ?		Retweet = Obama	Like = Trump https://t.co/RKf1DpJZZs
@MollyJongFast What he posted was vile.
@amandablount2 @MollyJongFast @EsotericCD @EmericaFirst I'm blocked too which is odd.
@jasoninthehouse @NPR Too many people have them that DO NOT need them.  Their jobs do not require one.  Many have NEVER handled a piece of classified materials their entire CAREERS!
@CREWcrew Because the best and brightest are not being hired.  The Best and Brightest are wise to not sign onboard this train-wreck. These individuals have questionable backgrounds and behaviors that wouldn't get them a federal job in the first place.  Ethics is not the strong with the WH.
@BillOReilly You paid several women a lot of money to stay quiet.  You are a flaming hypocrite.
@DevinNunes Mouth breather
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Can someone deactivate his phone so the rest of Twitter can get a break from the conspiracy theories
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you have an off switch?  Always spreading misinformation.
@MalcolmNance I'm troubled that waiting in the wings when this hits the fan is Betsy's brother and the promise to set up a private IC.  You know the same man that had private security personnel running wild in Iraq years ago!
@MSNBC Someone needs to ask the President how his Father in Law, Mother in Law and Sister in Law ALL came to the US? Was it because of his third wife's status? Merits does his In Laws bring to the US? Who's paying the bills? People bitched when Michelle Obama moved her mother in the WH!
@krassenstein @RepMattGaetz He won't even come clean on how many DUI's his father paid to disappear. The good Congressman doesn't understand, they will throw him under the bus to save their own ass.  If he thinks he has top cover from this 💩 show?  There will be none.  I hope he is voted out in November.
@kenvogel Is this the same Speechwriter that says the vase hit her?  She fell into my fist?  I thought they hired the best and brightest!  sounds like the dumb and dumbest.
@realDonaldTrump So now you want certain classes to have due process and the others get chopped liver.  God you can be a hypocrite.
@WhiteHouse Considering the first family has greatly benefited from this form of immigration?  That is very hypocritical of them.
@DevinNunes Complicit idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Release the memo and be transparent.  This is showing you're cherry picking what you will release.
@justinamash Stand up and put an end to this crap your party is doing.  Sounds like you are the only one in the house with a spine to speak out.  Speaker Ryan has FAILED you.  Are you a people before party or party before country.  Fix the disinformation Nunes and company are spreading!
@Alt_Spicerlies Most of the staff shouldn't have been given the interim!  Double Standards much WH?
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Double standards for the WH and the rest of the Federal Government.  Porter would have NEVER been granted an interim in DoD.  So because of those morons lying on their forms the rest of us WITH clearance are lumped in the same bucket.  GUESS what.  Can't get an interim go bye.
@KatrinaPierson @Snapchat @instagram Take you conspiracy theories and go way.  You are annoying.
@DrDenaGrayson No....The Coward of revealing the damn truth.  So much for his transparency.  he will only allow it when it suits his narrative!  I'm going to log off before I get an all out Twitter Time Out.
@MajorCBS @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff @FaceTheNation What is POTUS afraid of the TRUTH!  He wants transparency on his terms.  What a hypocrite!
@kylegriffin1 McGahn and company are complicit in their cover up behavior.  Those Tater Tots need to be be fired!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do shut up!  Stop with the conspiracy theory crap
@Alt_Spicerlies Yes.
@seanspicer @FoxNews @JoeConchaTV @seanhannity You are a goddamn Naval Reserve Officer!  Behave like one with integrity and honor. I wonder what The Wardroom thinks of you?
@Shareblue @DNCpeep Betsy is a freaking cockroach.  She cares about lining her own pockets!  Her brother is a crook too.
@Alt_Spicerlies @lauferlaw @Kitten0409 Deep breath Mic pour a drink and relax.
@NormEisen @ktbenner We know later in his career Bork never got a seat on a bench because of it!
@Alt_Spicerlies @Well_RN @realDonaldTrump This is wrong on so many levels.  The GOP are complicit in their behavior by ignoring it. I just hope Mueller can finish the work before all hell breaks loose.  Nixon as bad as he was, saw the writing on the wall and resigned. Trump will have to be removed kicking and screaming.
@Well_RN @Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump I'm hoping that is the plan.  I am worried we are looking at Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre ALL over again.  History is repeating itself.  Sad part, the Majority is not there to act like they did decades ago.
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump WTF!   This really can't be happening.
@EricTrump Just keep your mouth closed and focus on running a business.  You are not a politician.
@TrueFactsStated What's next.  I need to keep a copy of my damn passport and birth certificate on me to PROVE I was born in the US?
@cathymcmorris So you and the others were praising ALL This extra money in the taxpayers paychecks.  Well guess what Ma'am.  Even with the lousy raise I just received STILL means in 2019 I'll have to write a check to the IRS because of the ridiculous tax brackets.  Stop lying to people.
@CNBC They never do.  Any bonus I received was taxed at a much higher rate and saw about HALF of it.  That is what they don't see.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do us a favor stay out of politics.  You wouldn't know how to behave ethically if it was staring you straight in the face!
@RepMattGaetz How about starting with your own party and their lack of transparency!
@AltScalesOfJust @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Exactly.   However we are not dealing with the typical administration who understands this.
@aravosis I'm going for Pence is the biggest liar.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He had ALREADY made the disclosure Months ago!
@marcorubio Then do something about Hannity and that crazy man hiding I the Ecuadorian Embassy.  They are conspiring to destroy the US Government
@nickgillespie @RandPaul @reason @EricBoehm87 First Ted Cruz NOW Rand Paul.  I will NOT be happy about going to work and having to sign a damn Furlough letter.  He needs to grow the hell up and so his JOB!
@WestWingReport Some of us are trying to eat over here.  That is so gross.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So now you're attacking the person your father picked to head the FBI!  You who claims "Attorney Client Privilege!"  You are a gaslighting moron!
@RandPaul What in the world is going on!  You control the White House, House and Senate.  Still you can't get your crap together.  You and Congress are playing with the pay checks of the men and women of the federal government.  Military AND the Civil Servants.  GROW UP!
@KatrinaPierson Will you please stop talking about conspiracy theories.  You are not helping things.
@realDonaldTrump Look at your own family first.  Who was a chain immigration and who was a visa lottery?
@SenBlumenthal This is what bothers me.  Double standards.  What you do for the rest of the Federal Government you do for the White House.  No "Get a Pass" from the President.  Same standards!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ugh.   Do you have an Off Switch for your Conspiracy Thoughts!  You are gaslighting AGAIN!
@TrueFactsStated I'm sorry.  They should get the same treatment as the civilians in Department of Defense and other Federal organizations!   That is some BS!
@RepMattGaetz Only the WH can approve these.  The State department is one of eight who agrees.  The nine members must be in an agreement before it goes to the WH!
Amazing.  Once again shadow banned!
@RepMattGaetz @HillaryClinton You idiot.  Nine people have to say yes before the PRESIDENT approves it.  Also nothing was sent to Russia.  Stop with the conspiracy theory and read the facts.  You don't understand how the process works.
@RepMattGaetz Do you have a damn OFF Switch!
@RepMattGaetz You are the biggest misinformed Congressman on the planet.
@cathymcmorris Lower the standards and what the defaults happened?  Idiot.
@cathymcmorris @RepHuizenga Like the Mortgage lender in 2006 that was trying to push me and my husband that was WAY above our income! We walked away.  Friends you did that same thing stuck with a house they are upside down in.  God you are living in an alternate universe.  Moron!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @WSJ Funny that you cite stories from businesses owned by the Murdoch family.
@RepMattGaetz Moron.

@KatrinaRulz @ProudResister I know.  Gross!!!
@ProudResister Rumor has it She's dating the serial wife beater.
@RepMattGaetz How many DUI's have you had?  How many of those your father paid people to drop?  Stop being a hypocrite.
@RepMattGaetz Oh dear god.  Are you this much of an idiot.  Have you not taken the time to understand how these are issued?
@DonaldJTrumpJr When will you learn.  Stop with all this conspiracy theory crap.  Let Mueller finish his investigation.  He will issue a report and it will determine who is cleared of allegations and who is guilty as hell.  You are part of the problem with the disinformation reporting.  Moron.
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS @PressSec @VP @SecondLady How in the hell do these people get tired in this Administration?
@RepMattGaetz @HillaryClinton How many DUI's did you get a free pass on?
@DevinNunes Benedict Arnold
@RepAndyBiggsAZ You really need to stop spreading disinformation.  You are being a conspiracy theorist.
@KatrinaPierson Do us a favor stop spreading this conspiracy theory stuff.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Stick to running a business and stay out of the government sector.
@KatrinaPierson Gaslighting much?
@PressSec How many companies paid bonuses then followed up with laying off hundreds?  Stop lying.
@RepMattGaetz How many DUI's did your father pay people to drop!
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness How many DUI’s did your family pay to go away?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Shut up Junior and stick to your day job.
@SpeakerRyan You and All of Congress are using the Military and Federal Workers as pawns.  This is not restricted to one party.  You both stand there and smile claiming to support but cut services and pay.
@jimsciutto @mkraju @KaraScannell Bannon's not stupid.  Wonder if he's working a deal with Mueller.
@cathymcmorris How much of that increase was off-set by rising healthcare premiums.
@realDonaldTrump Act like a grown ass man and stop calling adult men childish names.  If you did nothing then let the investigation continue and to prove you are right. You are behaving like a child caught with their hand in the cookie jar trying to blame it on little brother!

@kallcasey @Naomismommie @alt_fda @altUSEPA @altNOAA @Alt_NASA @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems We’ve been dragged through the mud by Congress and the WH.  Good people are leaving.  I will take a cut in pay and work private sector to reduce the stress
@CLewandowski_ @TGowdySC Just be quiet.  You are not making things better.
@HouseGOP While you Sessions and his idiot miller turn back the damn civil rights clock.  How many of you received money from the Koch’s to betray the people of the United States?  I am a GOP voter and am ashamed at the lack of spine to deal with misconduct in your own party.  Fix this now
@JasonMillerinDC @ChrisRuddyNMX @realDonaldTrump @ReliableSources Follow the money you find the Rats.
@911CORLEBRA777 @LouiseMensch @thespybrief @ericgarland WTF?  That plant is 45 minutes from where I live?  Who agreed on this?
@Alt_Spicerlies @SecretaryZinke Forgot the fact he was cooking his travel vouchers while in the Navy!
@PreetBharara Did Snowflake Gorka block you?  Funny how they called others Snowflakes but the minute you call their bullshit they block someone.   You're my hero Mr. Bharara!
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump I research the candidates to make an informed decision.  If someone wants my vote treat it like a job.  I don't want empty promises or lies.  I want a candidate that isn't getting paid 500k from the Koch's OR Soro's to pass law benefiting Corporations.  The people come first.
@waltshaub Someone needs to file a complaint with McGahn's bar.  His behavior as an attorney is horrible!
@SpeakerRyan You and Congress don't get to play the deflect game! You are a two faced hypocrite!  You want to cut Social Security calling it an entitlement. The same Social Security that paid for your college? We pay for Social Security through payroll taxes you moron. Just resign you coward.
@PressSec Those bonuses are still taxed. Many received these bonuses and a layoff notice. Many bonuses were already agreed on by Collective Bargaining Agreements. Many are not seeing these big increases in pay. The increases are being off set by increased healthcare premiums.
@krassenstein Also congress delayed implementation of PTC (Positive Train Control) that could have prevented some of the accidents. https://t.co/bKW227Rkrz
@JacobAWohl Chief Justice Roberts appointed him to FISA.
@TeaPainUSA The sheep on that thread are idiots.  The facts don’t matter to them!
@TomFitton You are not understanding crap.  There was OTHER information from IC sources that triggered this.  It is in Nunes memo.  Stop this conspiracy theory crap.  We all want to get to the bottom of this let the Special Counsel do their job.
@RandPaul @justinamash Go back to your day job of being a Doctor!
@realDonaldTrump Marcia,Marcia, Marcia.  God it’s Groundhog’s Day!
@TeaPainUSA @DonaldJTrumpJr God the kids just won’t shut up!  He’ll let them talk Mueller is collecting ALL those tweets.
@DrDenaGrayson Rudy is a weasel who is up to his eye balls in Russian Dressing with a side of questionable income from certain transaction.
@SpeakerRyan Why did you and Congress delay the implementation of the PTC (Positive Train Control)?  So Now this technology will be installed hopefully by the end of this year?  This technology could have reduced the deaths. 	https://t.co/bKW227Rkrz
@ShaunKing Oh my....What is Speaker Ryan afraid of?  Ryan is a flaming coward with no spine or balls.
@SenGillibrand @GOP @SenJohnMcCain These individuals are willing to serve their country. Willing to die for this country. The vast majority of Congress and WH failed to volunteer. The Veteran's in Congress are working hard for Veteran's and our military.
@ChloeAngyal @emptywheel @HuffPost It's okay if it doesn't involve them.  I am concerned with what they may try and do to the average citizen of the USA.
@SenatorLankford Stand up and do more Mr. Senator.  This is becoming a Constitutional Crisis FAST!  Nunes and the others need to be held accountable for the reckless behavior they have caused.  Good men and women of the FBI will possible resign or retire because of them.
@senorrinhatch No matter how much I withhold on Federal Taxes I STILL OWE?  The 430 dollars a year increase in just MY PAY, won't cover the check me and my spouse must write this year!  This is a slap in the face to middle class.
@lauferlaw @FBI Many Federal Workers are really feeling beat down by Nunes and company.  This isn’t just the FBI but all agencies and DOD.  We are worn and ready to throw in the towel.  Now possibly in the 2019 budget making us all At Will for political leverage.  Congress are a bunch of morons.
@DevinNunes Really.  You are single-handedly trying to destroy federal law enforcement.  The people will vote you out for this mess.  You are a disgrace!
@TeaPainUSA @lauferlaw Give him time.  He’ll blame it on someone else.
@davidfrum @aravosis Moochie failed English in school.
@Scaramucci @davidfrum @POTUS Good god what are you 12?  Talk like one.
@realDonaldTrump Good grief.  Start listening to your counsel and stop tweeting.
@DrDenaGrayson Tater-Tot Nunes and Ryan are probably afraid Page will say how much Russian Dressing they have been getting along with Koch monies to stone-wall Mueller’s investigation.
@cathymcmorris The head of your party tanked any bipartisan help with that memo stunt.  How much Russian Dressing did you get with the Koch Brother donation?
@WalshFreedom You spoke the truth and that is why they left.  You reviewed the facts to make an informed decision.  Stay firm.
@PressSec Is this Before or After taxes are taken out?  They don't mention that.
@nytimes So it appears this staffer Patel has an axe to grind with the DOJ?  Where in the hell do these congressmen dig up these staffers?  Nunes and his staff have no ethics and morals.  Lets hope Nunes is voted out in November.
@AynRandPaulRyan @joshscampbell Sadly, This is happening all over the Federal Government.  Not just the FBI. People who took an oath to support and defend the constitution are tired of the political parties attacking their agencies and work. You serve with pride and attacked by members of Congress like Nunes.
@tedlieu @Wendys Yeah I remember that AND Watergate!  I’m showing my age!
@DevinNunes It is people like you that make good Federal Workers leave.  You tarnished a whole agency for the actions of a few.  I really hope the voters speak out and usher in a new person to represent them.
@SethAbramson Check out 5he story on The Hill.  Seems Tater-Tot Nunes is going after the Stare Department now.  When will the madness end
@Naomismommie @alt_fda @altUSEPA @altNOAA @Alt_NASA @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems We have been through a lot.  We are very loyal workers and do not like being used as pawns.
@amandablount2 @amandablount2 that tater-tot Nunes is now setting his sights on the State Department.  Why won't they put a muzzle or short leash on that man.  I was mad when I read this article!		https://t.co/Wfk0H23FZy
@Naomismommie @alt_fda @altUSEPA @altNOAA @Alt_NASA @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Thank you.  I'm trying to hold on.  Morale is very low and with the prospect of another shutdown next week, it is very somber.
@Naomismommie @alt_fda @altUSEPA @altNOAA @Alt_NASA @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Many of us are losing hope.  I'm on retirement countdown.  Seven years minimum retirement age and 20 years I'm out!  It's not worth the stress!
@RepPeterDeFazio Then Congressman explain Nunes comments in this article!	https://t.co/Wfk0H23FZy
@AltUSPressSec Here is the article where Nunes is bragging about the next phase. 	https://t.co/Wfk0H23FZy
@MollyJongFast It's getting worse.  Just saw an article from The Hill.  Seems Nunes is looking at the State Department!  I thought it was a joke till I read the article.  Nunes is stating they are in the middle of phase 2 to see if the State Department was involved.  What is wrong with this man
RT @MollyJongFast: “If thou art too stupid to lie, thou must be Devin Nunes.”  Numbers 69:98 https://t.co/sleGClbzFO
@AltUSPressSec Someone in the GOP needs to put Nunes on a short leash before he gives everyone RABIES!  He is on a one man mission to dismantle the Agencies of the Executive BRANCH!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Congressman Lieu.  Have you seen this news report?		https://t.co/Wfk0H23FZy
@benjaminwittes Nunes is back on a new quest according to The Hill!  Nunes says he and the GOP are investigating the State Department!  What is wrong with this man?
@Amy_Siskind Check out Breaking News on The Hill's twitter site.  Supposedly, Nunes is now setting his sights on the State Department.
@funder Hey @funder.  Sounds like Nunes is back to his old tricks.  Check out this from The Hill		https://t.co/LJBf0yap2t
@JoePerticone Well Nunes is now talking about a second memo against the State Department!		This article is from The Hill	https://t.co/LJBf0xSOaV
@PhilippeReines Doesn't Gorka have a warrant for his arrest?  Why do they (Fox) keep putting that worthless expert on TV?  My damn Basset Hound could give a better interview.
@WilDonnelly Now this Tater-Tot Nunes is talking to the press about they (House GOP) is investigating the State Department? What is wrong with Nunes?  Was he dropped as a child or is Nunes REALLY that stupid.  Makes you wonder if Mueller has evidence on Nunes.	https://t.co/LJBf0xSOaV
@TeaPainUSA Hey @TeaPainUSA saw an article that is saying Nunes has the State Department on his memo radar.  https://t.co/LJBf0xSOaV
@No1FinFan It gets worse....Check this article out.	https://t.co/LJBf0xSOaV
@WestWingReport Can you believe this man Nune?  Someone needs to put him on a very short leash before he spreads rabies!	https://t.co/LJBf0xSOaV
@WestWingReport Seems Village Idiot Nunes is talking about targeting the State Department now.  Trying to find the article on it
@brianstelter @BretBaier You have got to be kidding?
@thehill WTH is wrong with Nunes? When are they going to reel this village idiot in!  First the FBI and DOJ NOW the State Department!
@DevinNunes You betrayed the Men and Women of the FBI.  They are loyal to the mission and you dragged them through the mud for political game.  Shame on you.  These are loyal civil servants.  Go after the 1% bad operators NOT the 99% who are good.
@TGowdySC Bullshit congressman.  You allowed Nunes to run wild without supervision!  You and the rest of Congress need to deal with his dumbass!
@RepAndyBiggsAZ That you and the others don't give a damn about the American people.  How much Russian Dressing is on your Koch Brother donations!
@matthewamiller That Keebler Elf Sessions is trying to get back into the good graces of the WH.  That Elf is only looking out for himself and no one else.
@PRyan I am tired of writing a check EVERY April to the IRS because I owe!  I paid nearly 15,000 A YEAR in Federal taxes.  Each damn paycheck 1200 in taxes and deductions ALONE! That is roughly 2400 A MONTH in taxes and deductions!  Yet you are going to freeze my wages.  You are a moron
@DonaldJTrumpJr You're a flaming moron.  The Men and Women of the FBI and DOJ do not deserve this.
@DrDenaGrayson Thanks to those Dingleberry's in the GOP this will damage the ability to conduct counter-surveillance work.  How stupid was Nunes and company.
@RepMarkMeadows Thanks you stupid people.  They are risking the lives of people in the field collecting information.  Thanks for plunging us into a Constitutional Crisis.
@KellyannePolls Like this Tax Bill was going to bring more money in my paycheck.  Explain $36 dollars?  That's what I got.  Lie much?
@KellyannePolls We're tired of your boss trashing the FBI Agents!
@PRyan Here is the issue.  The bonuses from these people are taxed meaning they will not get the full 1,000.  Many of these bonuses were already planned by companies.  You based your bill of what you think is traditional.   Many are not traditional!
@AynRandPaulRyan Good Lord!  What the hell is going on!  There are jobs that won't pay full time wages.  This also affects Veterans too!
@TeaPainUSA Morning Pain.  Good to see you are out there keeping us informed!
@WSJ His hand-picked Director (Republican) is at the FBI! He Picked the Deputy Director (Republican and a career civil servant). The DOJ is filled with his people (ALL REPUBLICANS). Innocent people cooperate with an investigation. Guilty people  stone-wall and throw mud to stop it.
@MarkLandler @helenecooper Military intervention should be used as a last resort.  Let the State Department do their job but first the State Department needs to be fully staffed to do the mission.   The Pentagon is taking the right approach of slow planning while letting the diplomats take the lead.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Got a WHOLE $36 dollar INCREASE!
@counterchekist Morning.  It's a fine Friday Morning!
@foxandfriends His own party is also the problem.  The different factions who don’t want this and the others that DO.  In the middle?  The federal government being shut down again!
RT @snopes: Facebook Denies Censorship in Closing of Paris User’s Page https://t.co/OdlxrAyz9N
@MollyJongFast @KevinMKruse @SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan is too busy placing a bunch of Russian Dressing on those Koch donations he's receiving.
@EdKrassen @Twitter @TwitterSupport Join the crowd.  I've been shadowed banned many times!
@VP This is going to make it okay to discriminate based on religion if someone disagrees with one's gender, color and sexual orientation?  This is a slippery slope that will turn back the clock of Separation of Church and State also, Civil Rights Act.
@realDonaldTrump I am so tired of the good men and women of the FBI being dragged in this mess.  These are very loyal civil servants who put their lives on the line everyday to keep the people safe.  They do not deserve to be lumped into the 1% behaving badly.  Director Wray is doing a fine job.
@realDonaldTrump Your OWN Party originally paid for this.
@Alt_Spicerlies Hope is up to her neck in this crap.  Means Corey may have to go back to the wife and kids now.
@jasoninthehouse At least he’s not seeking re-election unlike you who quit in the middle of your term.  You are a hypocrite.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Those bonuses are still TAXED!  Those employees will not see the full 1,000.  Those bonuses are treated as added income thus taxed.  For some that money was given along with notices of layoffs.  Many bonuses were already approved!  The timing is suspect with the Tax Reform Bill.
@gary50354416 @MarkGeistSWP @DellaTolbert1 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity Did you just post a link to a satire news site?  The Onion is that satire stories.

@TeaPainUSA @DonaldJTrumpJr Man-Child Don Jr needs to taught a lesson.  I think Mr. Mueller could teach him that lesson.
@DonaldJTrumpJr What the hell!  Can this man-child shut up already.
@PRyan More and more you appear to be a sell out.  Speaker Ryan will get any bill passed for the right price.  Tax Reform he got 500k shortly after it passed.  What other money has he taken to get pad his pockets.  I wonder what Mueller has on him.
@RepJeffDuncan @jaketapper Then allow the Dems memo to be released you moron.  You are part of the problem
@NatashaBertrand Oh bullshit on Pompeo’s response.  He is not a White Hat....Pompeo is a Black Hat!
@jasoninthehouse Shut up Jason.
@PRyan Complicit in your behavior.  You took 500k from the Koch’s to pass the Tax Bill.  You are paid for by them and don’t give a damn about the people of the United States.  You won’t be a leader and put you lap dog Nunes in his damn place OFF the committee he heads on his behavior.
@DNCpeep @LindseyGrahamSC Exactly.  It is sad.
@SpeakerRyan @TaxReform Grow a set of balls and do what is right for the country.  We know the Koch’s paid you to vote yes on this bill.  You complicit moron are causing this Crisis

@DonaldJTrumpJr Men and women of the FBI died in the line of duty to protect this country. Men and women in uniform died to give you the ability to be moron.  They took an oath to defend the Constitution!  I don't recall you taking that oath.  I do TWICE!  Shame on you!
@SenateMajLdr @UPS @UPS_News Shut up Benedict Arnold McConnell.
@seanspicer @JasonMillerinDC @CNN This was NOT a happy payday for me @seanspicer!

Some maybe getting more money not this person
@foxandfriends You know.  You are a gaslighting organization.  Why are you doing this?  Use to be you were fair and balanced.  Now you're about conspiracy theories and hate.  This will damage how our Intelligence Agencies operate.  Shame on everyone at Fox News for this conspiracy mess.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Where you there?  If not, don't make assumptions.
@thehill This is McCarthy and Watergate in one storm.  Congress are a bunch of complicit morons who are turning the other cheek NOT to deal with it.  Many are old enough to remember BOTH!  Congress do your job and deal with the storm you created.  November the people will vote for change.

@foxandfriends Give us a FREAKING BREAK!  This will undermine the FBI, DOJ.  The loyal men and women who are civil servants do not need to be lumped into the bad actions of a few.  Let the FBI IG do their investigation and handle it!

@RepLeeZeldin @HouseDemocrats @RepAdamSchiff You complicit moron!  You act like you don't give a damn about the Constitution you are only concerned about Party.  You will be voted out in November you moron!  Thank you for plunging us into a Constitutional CRISIS!  Who's in your wallet!
@DevinNunes @realDonaldTrump You moron.  You are complicit in your attack on the Constitution.  You are a disgrace.  You have betrayed the oath you SWORE to protect and defend it.  You sell-out!
@RepMarkMeadows For people who say they didn't do anything wrong, why are you so hell-bent on destroying the FBI?  I hope they vote you out of office in November.  You are betraying the oath you took to support and defend the Constitution.
@LindseyGrahamSC You're like the others Complicit in your behavior.  How much did they pay you to betray the people of America!  Was it worth the power!
@RepTomRice Complicit in your acts. How much did the Koch's pay you to pass the Tax Bill?  I wonder who has paid you to betray your country and vote for special interest.  People before Party.  November you will be voted out.
@jaketapper @RepMattGaetz @TheLeadCNN The good Congressman needs to come clean on the number of DUI's his father paid to cover up.  This is an attack on the men and woman of the FBI Employees and they are not political appointees.  The FBI  independent and not subject to tampering by Congress or the WH!
@SenTedCruz Are you going to adopt these children?  Are you going to hold the mother who has to deliver a child that has a horrific defect?  Are you going to comfort that husband who lost his wife due to a medical event?  Stay out of the lives of women who have to make these choices!
@sendavidperdue Are you going to adopt all those children?  Stay out of the lives of women who are struggling with this choice!  What's next punish women who've had hysterectomies or unable to bear children?  This is not some episode of The Handmaid's Tale.
@SenateMajLdr You turtle head moron.  My "pay increase" was $36!  What am I to spend $36 on?  You are a complicit moron!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You have never been a civil servant.  Last time I checked, we PAY INTO our retirement.  We have deduction for IRA's, Pension Plan, Thrift Savings Plans. You wouldn't know this since you've never had to raise your right hand and swear and oath to defend the Constitution.
@tedlieu Why is Nunes being allowed to run around like a village idiot!
@PRyan You complicit moron.  You need to show people like me and my husband who have no children to claim!  I'm watching my taxes go up you hypocritical MORON!  Forgot my damn insurance going up, paying more for retirement.  Hope that 500k from the Koch's was worth it.  Sell out!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your words are dividing this country. Men and women have raised their hand to support and defend the Constitution. Served this country with honor. You know nothing for you have never have served your country. Military and Civil Servants are loyal to the constitution.
@orangecone21 @HouseGOP @cathymcmorris One can hope.  I've dealt with a lot over the last ten years and this has me on the fence about taking an early retirement.  I've been extremely faithful but even the faithful get burned.
@orangecone21 @HouseGOP @cathymcmorris I just got my notification of the 1 Feb pay check and its showing $36 increase.  That is what is frustrating me.
@orangecone21 @HouseGOP @cathymcmorris I as a person in the middle class am tired of paying for others.  I'm been fed up since 2008!
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump @conspirator0 @OpWolverines @JamesFourM @MingGao26 @ericgarland That is why I don't use Firefox and Chrome for .mil sites.  Someone who works for the Gov here.
@Z_Everson Which is why many of use DO NOT use it for accessing .mil addresses.
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris More jobs when Corporations are cutting jobs.  Bigger paychecks?  WHERE?  $36 dollars in not a gain and won't spur economic spending!  Corporations are looking the reward shareholders NOT the workers.
@cathymcmorris @HouseGOP I gained $36 in my February paycheck.  What the hell do I spend it on?   Where is this MAGICAL savings we're all supposed to get?
@newtgingrich Explain now my first check of the new Tax Reform was a whole $36 MORE! I went from the 25% bracket to the 22% bracket.  You're still taxing the crap out of me.  How is this helping people like me who are middle class with no more child deductions!
@LindseyGrahamSC @hughhewitt You're restricting birth control access, Planned Parenthood care, now taking a decision that is between a woman and her doctor AWAY!  What's next punishing women who had hysterectomies or are unable to bear children?  You will not decide for women how they should live their lives
@SpeakerRyan The Koch's gave you $500,000 to pass that bill. You sold the people of your State down the river for Power? We need elected officials who work for the people and defend the Constitution. We do not need an official who is sold to the highest Donor.  We will Vote you out.
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump Why are you so hellbent on stopping the investigation.  If people didn't do anything wrong, then let the investigation conclude then be vindicate everyone.  Everyone is behaving like they are guilty as sin.
@cathymcmorris I got a lousy 36 dollar increase in my damn pay!  How is that FAIR!
@realDonaldTrump Are you bringing your companies back to the USA along with your daughter's company?
@counterchekist @newtgingrich Last time I checked the oath I took was Support and Defend the CONSTITUTION @newtgingrich
@foxandfriends Look, most people who are getting  these 1000 bonuses will have it taxed! Most will not see the full amount.  There are some companies that are giving these bonuses and laying people off!  Where I work bonuses are TAXED!  Some companies are investing in people others are not.
@foxandfriends Those bonuses may still be subject to taxes.  They will not receive the full $1000.
@foxandfriends This tax payer just received their pay stub for their 1 Feb 18 Pay.  $35 DOLLARS is all I got!
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris Hey morons.  I got a whole $35 dollar increase from your Tax Reform!  My taxes WENT UP! I as in middle class did not see any noticeable increase like you said would happen!  Liar, Liar pants on fire.
@jasoninthehouse God you are annoying!
@cathymcmorris Several of your Republican members voted no.  Don't forget to include them too.
@EricTrump How many of those 400,000 will be part time or seasonal?
@AynRandPaulRyan I guess that candidate will starve.  What a moron!  Does he still live with his mother before getting married?  Is he married?
@DonaldJTrumpJr 1000 for me is taxed so all I get after taxes in 700 dollars.  It's Taxed you IDIOT!
RT @weareoversight: #documentoftheday: Receipt for reimbursement submitted by DOL employee who stayed at a Trump hotel in Florida: https://…
@KellyannePolls I haven't seen one shred of proof this new tax reform helps me.  Only thing I know I have to write a damn check to the IRS. I'm middle class, withhold at a very high rate and STILL OWE!  Hypocrite!
@KellyannePolls What about the companies who are cutting jobs as part of Tax Reform.
@SpeakerRyan Coward grow a spine to do the work of the People.  We know you took $500,000 from the Koch's after passing the Tax Reform.  Who are you working for exactly?  Not the people who elected you!  November you will be voted out of office.  COWARD!
@SenTomCotton @hughhewitt Coward and a Hypocrite.
@ALT_uscis @mmfa Yet Laura married the dumbest of the Trump Children.
@Alt_Spicerlies Oh my.  Stay frosty Mic.  You are our lifeline for news.
@jasoninthehouse Why does Jared have a one if he LIED MULTIPLE TIMES on his SF 86 AND failed to disclose income from questionable people MANY TIMES.  HYPOCRITE!
@jasoninthehouse Coward and Hypocrite
@jasoninthehouse @RepRatcliffe @TGowdySC It's people like you and others that make it hard for us to get to do our jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Let the FBI investigate and stop tainting the investigation.
@SpeakerRyan How is that 500K your received from the Koch's going?  Just happen to get it AFTER the Tax Reform Bill Passed.
@foxandfriends Oh no....You should lump Rand Paul and Mike Lee in that too.  Those two GOP Senators make 18 in the Senate who voted No.
@TrueFactsStated Welcome Back!  Heard they put you in time out!

@DrDenaGrayson Charles blackmailed his own sister in a criminal case.  Jared torpedoed Chris Christie from the Transition Team because Christie prosecuted elder Kushner.  I don't trust Jared.  I think he would throw people under the bus to save his own hide.  Jared strikes me as a weasel.
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Senator you stood on the Senate Floor reading a Dr. Seuss BOOK? You pushed to shut the government down in 2013.   You and the other 535 Members of Congress have one job to do, PASS a CR keep the government open. Members of Congress FAILED.  November we will vote you out.
@CNNPolitics Grandpa Munster needs to learn he works for the people.  I wonder which Corporation donated to his campaign in exchange for votes.  535 Members of Congress had one job.  Pass a bill.  Congress caused this.  November elections will signal change when we vote them out!
@GOP Should have never gotten to this point your morons.  All 535 members of Congress are to blame for this crap.  Get this bill passed and signed.  November Midterms will be defining when we vote you out.
@DrDenaGrayson Will the WH sign it?  As long as Miller and Kelly are lurking in the shadows it is not a done deal.  They could convince the President Veto.
@RepMattGaetz @DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Daddy paid people to look the other way for your DUI’s.
@RepMattGaetz @DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Hypocrite.
@RepMikeRogersAL @realDonaldTrump All 535 members need to get you damn act together and pass it.  If not we will vote you out of office.  How much has Corporate America paid you to screw the people of the United States over?  I bet you got a lot.  Moron!
@HouseGOP Bullshit you won’t allow the bill to be voted on.  You and the dems are a bunch of hypocrites!
@BillPascrell We don’t get back pay we will vote people out of office.
@CNNPolitics @Publici Should have voted on it at 1 AM
@SpeakerRyan Explain the 500k you received from the Koch’s?  Right after the Tax Bill was passed.  Hypocrite.
@SpeakerRyan @RepAnnWagner Do the people of America’s favor and resign.
@ABC @PressSec Just stop.  There are men and women driving to work signing a furlough letter then going home to wait.  535 Members of Congress couldn't get their crap together.  Don't shift blame.  Blame is on 535 members of Congress.
@marcorubio Because of you and 534 others I have to sign a furlough letter.  You are a hypocrite.  The Republicans and Democrats own this mess.  Fix it.  It is not the fault of the Fed Workers and Military they are not getting paid.  It is the 535 Members of Congress who did this to us.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Try being the one of many Fed Workers who are signing a furlough letter because 535 members of Congress can't get their shit together.  The worst part is not knowing if I will get a pay check as a result of this.  This shutdown is on the Republicans and Democrats!
@JasonMillerinDC Flaming moron!
@jonfavs @foxandfriends By profile.  You mean Miller’s receding hairline that make him look like Riff Raff from Rocky Horror Picture Show?

You work for the people not Corporate America.
@RepGaramendi @FoxNews @EricShawnTV 535 Members of Congress could not do their jobs to pass a budget.  This shut down is on all 535 members.

@SenatorMenendez You just need to resign.  You are not fit to be in Congress.
@RepPittenger 535 members of Congress chose to shut the government down.  535 members of Congress did not have the required voted to pass it.  535 members of Congress WAITED till the last minute to do something.  Do your job pass the bill open the government or get voted out in November
@amandablount2 @SpeakerRyan I was one of those who had to work during that 2013 shut down.  I got back pay.  This time around I'm not so sure those 535 Jackasses will do the same.
@SenateMajLdr @FoxNewsSunday 535 Members of Congress had one job.  That job was to pass a bill.  535 of you could not get your act together and do just that.  Republicans and Democrats you have failed the people of the United States.  November many of you will be voted out.  Be a leader you turtle head!

@RepEvanJenkins The 535 Members of Congress are to blame.  All of you had ONE job to do.  Secure enough votes to pass the bill.  You couldn't do that.  This Is the fault of BOTH parties.  Do your job and pass it.  Federal Workforce wants to go back to work NOT sign a damn furlough letter.
@realDonaldTrump 535 Members of Congress failed to do their jobs which was secure the necessary votes to pass it.  This is All on 535 members of Congress.

@WestWingReport @PressSec I think Spicer lost the respect of his fellow Naval Officers with his time as Press Secretary too.  I wouldn't trust him to lead with the lies he told and cover ups he was complicit with.
@DonaldJTrumpJr 535 members of Congress did this.  This all on those 535 members of Congress.  Those 535 cannot cooperate to do the right thing.  November 435 will be voted out and replaced by people who work got the People of America not Corporate America.  This all on Congress.

@foxandfriends Sorry going to avoid you like the plague.  Use to enjoy watching you.  Now I would rather read my local newspaper.  My local paper has less Drama Queen BS.
@foxandfriends 535 Members of Congress serve only to their corporate donors.  This is on all 535 members of Congress
@newtgingrich Congress will have to explain it to the Voters. This is a TWO WAY street. Explain this to the civil servant who has to sign a furlough letter tomorrow. Explain this to the military family who may not get a pay check. Explain how 535 members of Congress can't cooperate.
@GOPLeader All 535 members of Congress are behaving like petulant children. Members of Congress had one job. Pass a CR. Explain that the the military family who don't know if they will get a pay check! Explain to the civil servant who has to sign a furlough letter. Explain all that? Coward!

@SenateMajLdr These are loyal men and women who work the mission everyday in uniform and as civil servants do not deserve this. Congress you ALL shut the government down.  Congress can't work together without blaming others like petulant children.  Do you job and pass a CR!
@AltUSPressSec That’s what he gets when he let Miller aka Riff-Riff and Kelly write it.
@GOPLeader You and the rest of Congress are to blame.  Do not blame this on one individual.  Congress as a whole can’t cooperate long enough to pass a CR.  The men  and women who serve this country in uniform and as civilian workers are not you pawns.  Pass the CR!
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump People are going to get furlough letters tomorrow and you are doing a poll?  Federal workers and military don’t know when they will get their next pay check!  You want to do a poll. This is not a game this is an insult to the loyal men and women who serve our country!

@SpeakerRyan  https://t.co/gZOEwwfMe3
@LindseyGrahamSC Fix the mess.  I would like to go into work on Monday to actually work NOT signing a damn furlough letter.  Why should you punish the workers because you and the DEMS can't come to an agreement.  Midterm Elections we will speak by voting you all out!
@kylegriffin1 Why doe the ICE director look like the villain from Goldfinger?
@SecretaryZinke @NatlParkService Gee...Wasting Taxpayer dollars during a shutdown.
@DevinNunes Good people are home because congress can't work together for the PEOPLE of the United States.  Country before Party.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
@SenatorDurbin Why don't you pass a damn budget and stop kicking this down the road.  Pass a CLEAN CR.  CHiP needs to be funded.  Tackle Dream Act separately.
@SenateMajLdr How about you approve a damn BUDGET!
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Do your job.  You need to find out why four of your Senators voted against it.  You had five Dems vote for the bill still needed 10 more to come over.  Grow up and be a leader.
@PressSec Oh no....This is on the GOP.  There was a bipartisan bill and YOUR BOSS torpedoed it.  I am one of those sitting at home wondering if I'll get a damn paycheck while the work continues to pile up on my DESK.  Four GOP Senators Voted Against it, Five Dems voted for it.  Nice try.
@SpeakerRyan You couldn't get your own party to fully support this damn bill.  At least five Dems voted for it.  Clean up your own damn house FIRST.
@SusanWBrooks You realize there are Civil Servants who are also on the job during this shutdown?  What about them.  What about those of us who are sitting at home wondering if we'll get a damn paycheck?
@RepMarkMeadows But you will make federal workers sit at home.  Military not get paid along with those same civilians.  Could you please get your heads together and fix it!
@SpeakerRyan You again did not do enough.  There was a bipartisan bill that was rejected by the White House. You did even try and reach out to work together.  This is bull crap that you and leadership are forcing federal workers and military to go without pay for a game of chicken.  Grow up.
@RepPaulCook Moron.  Five Dems voted for the bill.  Four Republicans voted against.  Do the math you never had the votes!  You control all branches and still could not get it done.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse @SenatorTimScott You did not have the required votes.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse Jason do shut up.  McConnell didn’t have the damn votes.
@HouseGOP @SenDougJones Doug Jones Voted for the bill.
@RepDLamborn Flake, Lee, Paul and Graham all voted no.  Face it McConnell and Ryan are horrible leaders
@Acosta Because he is to blame.  He rejected the bipartisan bill.  The GOP lost four votes and only gained five.  McConnell didn't do enough to get the votes needed cause he's a poor leader.
@RepLouBarletta Five Dems voted WITH The GOP!  What were the four GOP Senator's thinking.  Hypocrite.  People in the Federal Government will not get paid and McConnell refused to have a vote to pay military.
@RepChrisStewart No this is on Flake, Lee, Paul and Graham.  McConnell KNEW he didn't have the damn votes.  He gained five Dems who voted yes but didn't do more to get a buffer.  This is on McConnell, Ryan and the White House.  They had a bipartisan bill and the White House rejected it.
@PressSec This is on your party.  This shutdown has a huge effect on the men and women of the Department of Defense.  Military and Civilians will not get paid.   Maybe you should ask Senator McConnell about the four in his party who voted NO.
@Scavino45 Why isn't anyone talking about Senators Flake, Lee, Paul and Graham who voted NO!
@RepMcKinley @SenateDems No sir.  Senators Flake, Lee, Paul and Graham hurt the vote.  You have five Dems vote FOR the bill.  A Graham's bipartisan bill was rejected by the White House.
@foxandfriends @jasoninthehouse The GOP didn't have the required 60.  They have 4 GOP Senators voting No.  Five Dems voting yes.  McConnell didn't do his JOB!  Look at the damn roll call Vote Jason!
@RepChrisStewart No.  Blame this on the GOP.  They didn't have the required votes out the gate.  Flake, Lee, Paul, Graham ALL voted No.  You have five Dems that voted FOR the bill.  This is all on McConnell for not securing the required votes BEFORE hand.  McConnell did a procedural No vote too.
@maggieNYT @shearm Yeah probably Kelly and Miller tanked it.  The people sitting at home while Congress gets a clue have bills to pay.  They keep this country moving but NO!! Congress uses them as pawns.  We'll remember this in November with Midterms come around.  We will vote them OUT!
@PeteSessions You're own party had FOUR vote No.  Five Dems voted yes.   All you had to do was woo those four back and two or three Dems for a buffer.  But NO! You couldn't lead yourself out of a wet paper bag.  Get back to work pass a bill.
@RepDLamborn Correction FIVE Dems helped the GOP.  Guess you and the others skipped math class!
@nursegalmom @ScottWalker Thanks Stacey.  I saw that five Dems voted yes.  It was early and I still haven't had coffee!  Agreed the GOP must have skipped Math Class on a continuous basis.  Betsy could teach her way out of a wet paper bag! 🤣🤣
@RepRatcliffe Explain this.  Explain Flake, Lee, Paul, Graham and McConnell's votes?  You probably could have gotten more if you had negotiated!
@CBSNews Along with McCain too this would have all been Avoided?
@CBSNews Okay.  So if Flake, Lee, Graham, Paul had ALL voted Yes along with McConnell the government would have been OPEN?
@WalshFreedom Why do Federal Workers have to be used as pawns in Congress' Games. 2013 was Sequestration, Shutdown, Furloughs, and 25% personnel cuts.  We've been loyal, picked up the work as people left and never were replaced. Many are retiring early.  We are burnt-out.
@RadioFreeTom Look around the DEMS and GOP couldn't lead themselves out of a wet paperbag!
@RepKevinCramer You are in charge of the House, Senate and White House.  You had MONTHS to come together for a bipartisan bill.  There was one that did just that.  You know who stopped it?  The White House.  This is ALL on the GOP.  Get to work fix this mess get the government open again.
@ScottWalker No.  There were FOUR GOP Senators who voted NO.  The Senator Majority leader voted No Too. Two DEMS voted YES.  The GOP who controls both chambers and the White House had MONTHS to work a deal and they DID.  It was the White House that killed it.  GOP owns this!
@foxandfriends This Shutdown affects many workers and military.  These are loyal people being made into a political ping-pong match.  Congress and the White House need to stop acting like children and get this cleaned up.  Both sides you can come to an agreement.  Fix it.
@jasoninthehouse @ShannonBream @FoxNews Correction...Donnelly Not Connolly voted yes.
@SpeakerRyan No you are not going there.  Flake, Lee, Paul, and Graham.  ALL voted no!  McConnell voted no as a procedural point.  You had Jones and Donnelly vote YES from the DEMS.  You control both chambers of Congress AND the White House.  You couldn't finish the deal.
@foxandfriends So not paying Department of Defense employees and military is a great idea!  They are people too!  There will be people not getting paychecks, services.  This is on the GOP controls Congress and the White House and can’t get it together.  We have Bills to pay!
@SecretaryZinke @NatlParkService @NationalMallNPS Good to see you WASTING tax payer money during a shutdown.  Your people are part of this shutdown
@RepBobGibbs @SenateDems Better toss Flake, Graham, Lee, Paul and the good Senate Leader McConnell in that bunch.  They helped tank this.
@RepDLamborn Oh no.  Lee, Flake, Pauland Graham did this.  Two Dems Helped you.  You control both chambers and the White House and you couldn’t get it done!  You own this shit!
@samstein I think it was a combination of the good General and Miller.  So mess with the people who protect this country and keep it going for a political point.  Midterm elections will be here soon.  We will remember and vote them out.
@HouseGOP @SenateDems Remember when Flake, Graham, Lee and Paul voted against you!  You control ALL of Congress AND the White House.  Work together fix this crap!  People who work for the Government are nor pawns!  They also have to pay rent.  You froze paychecks too.  Fix it!  Fix it fast.
@jasoninthehouse @ShannonBream @FoxNews You moron.  Lee, Flake, Paul and Graham ALL voted No.  Two Dems Jones and Connolly voted Yes.  Your party control the House, Senate and White House.  You STILL didn’t have enough for 60.  Your own party mucked this up!
@keithboykin @DNCpeep This is squarely on the GOP controlled Congress and the White House
@PressSec Flake, Lee, Paul and Graham had a HUGE hand in this.  Try explaining this to military and federal workers WHY they will not get  pay checks.  This HURTS the military and federal workers.  The GOP control the House, Senate and White House and still can’t get crap done!  Moron!
@sendavidperdue Hey moron!  Flake, Graham, Lee and Paul members of YOUR PARTY Voted no.  Only two DEMS voted Yes.  Do a better job of working together collaboratively.  This is ALL on the House, Senate and WH.  Now you placed the men and women of the Federal Government at risk.  Grow up!
Here is the link to the roll call.  Several from the GOP helped tanked this bill.		https://t.co/kvs6ctGc8f
So Twitter has restricted my functions for the next twenty four hours and didn't really give me a reason.  So NOW the only people who see my tweets are the folks who follow me.  That is some bull crap.
@SenDuckworth You have deprived me of my pay with this shutdown.  Now I will have to come in Monday and sign a letter and go home and wait!
@SenateMajLdr How many from YOUR party voted against this bill!
@SenatorTomUdall @POTUS No five DEMS voted FOR the measure.  It was Four GOP Flake, Lee, Graham and Paul who killed it.  Get you damn facts straight. If those 4 GOP senators said yes govt would be open.  This is all on the GOP.  You own the  House, Senate andWH.
@AV8intheblue @CBSNews He’s already been tucked into bed.  He was upset about not getting to fly to FL today for his party.
@PressSec Do shut up.  Your OWN party members voted NO.  Only 1 DEM voted Yes.  Your own party tanked this NOT the DEMS.
@TuckerCarlson @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Broken record
@SethAbramson Not in a good mood here.  The morons in Congress are messing with my pay and job for who has the bigger stick.
@RepScottPeters What about the other Civil Servants?  We are chopped liver to you?  Good luck getting a passport renewed when we are all set Home.
@SteveKingIA Drama Queen
@seanspicer @WhiteHouse @marthamaccallum @USChamber @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What do you do for a living?  Looks like nothing!
@thehill @SenTomCotton .  Your new nickname.
@SenTomCotton @marthamaccallum Steve King of the Senate.   That is What Senator called you.
@newtgingrich GOP controls both chambers AND the WH.  All you need was to woo 9 DEMS.  No that was too hard to do.  Newt go back to Italy with your wife and stay out of this.
@SenateMajLdr No five GOP members and 4 DEMS need to make the decision to make 60 votes YES!
@HouseGOP @SenateDems No, because five GOP members and four DEMS will not vote for this bill.
@LindseyGrahamSC you control the HOUSE, SENATE and WH and you still can't pass a permanent budget?  What is going on?  You lost five votes to the other side.  you needed all of your party and NINE DEMS to pass the CR.  God you can't do anything right.
@realDonaldTrump How about talking to the 5 GOP members who indicated they are voting no!  Remember it is 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.  There is no room for error.  YOU NEEDED to woo 5 republicans and 4 democrats to pass it. Work together to get it done!
@SenateMajLdr Civil Servants paychecks, Military paychecks with a shutdown.  Loss of productivity, morale and loyalty.  Talk to the numerous GOP members who have stated they will be voting NO.  That is who sunk the bill.
@SpeakerRyan You are a coward with no backbone. You sold the people of America out for power and position. You and Congress own this.  I'm talking about the GOP and the DEMS.  Country before Party!  Remember that you work for the PEOPLE.  You do not work for special interest.
@cathymcmorris You realize the Senate Republican's do not have the the votes because members of their own party have indicated they are voting NO!  Oh that slipped your mind because you have selective memory like you have selective hearing.  Both parties OWN this shutdown.
@DrDenaGrayson Pretty pissed about it.  Congress doesn’t get it and they never will.
@DrDenaGrayson Don’t like it one bit.  Just got the email and talk.
@alt_uscbp Shutdowns have second and third order effects, productive, morale and financial.  To Congress no big deal.  No harm no follow.  To that GS-7.....that is no pay for bills.
Looks like I got shadow banned!
@JudgeJeanine You are an idiot!
@SenFeinstein So you will send me home with not pay to behave like a damn child!   You and the GOP are morons.
@FoxBusiness @RepBradWenstrup Stop with the gaslighting congressman.  Let Mueller finish the job.
@RepPeterDeFazio Grow the hell up!   You are placing government workers in crisis.  We already have low morale, loss of positions and loss of benefits.  Work together and fix this mess.  I don’t get a paycheck and neither do you dumb ass.
@RepMikeCoffman You hypocrite.  Hope 2018 midterm elections see you getting a pink slip.  You are a flaming moron.  You don’t give a damn about the men and women of the DoD.  Screw us all out of a damn paycheck.  Uniformed Military and Civil Servants.
@cathymcmorris So are you going to step up and care for these children?  This a woman’s choice not you to muddle with.  You are a hypocrite.  I hope you are voted out of office.  You are Party before country.
@ChuckGrassley Talk to the 5 GOP members who are voting NO!  This is not on them. This is on YOU and your fellow GOP members.
@SenateMajLdr No 5 of your OWN PARTY are voting against this.  This is not on the DEMS.  You are so stupid.
@SpeakerRyan How about you talk to the 5 GOP members who are Voting NO!!!!  Don't blame this on the DEMS!  This is ALL on you.
@SpeakerRyan You are the WORST Speaker ever!  You and the others OWN this shutdown. Members of your OUR GOP have said no to this. WHY you are full of crap.  2018 The people will speak up at the ballot box and vote you out.  You are Party before Country, Special Interest before People.  COWARD
@WestWingReport I'm going to go on a rant.  I lived through the 2013 fulough and shut down.  I lived through Congress calling us lazy.  I lived through 25% personnel cuts.  I hit minimum retirement age, I'm gone.  I took an oath and loyal servant are beat down and tired.  I'll retire when i can.
@RepDeSantis @foxandfriends We need you to STOP dividing this country. You are not helping the country.  You are damaging the checks and balances!
@KatrinaPierson This is way we are so divide.  Gaslighting and Yellow Journalism, you are no better than the others who spew hate and discord.
@foxandfriends No your own damn party who are voting AGAINST the CR!
@SpeakerRyan You control BOTH chambers of Congress AND the White House.  This is your doing.  People in your OWN party are voting against this CR.  Wake up!  You and the Congressional Leader own this pile of poo you made!
@benjaminwittes Nunes is a moron.  I think he is a stooge and needs to be voted out.
@thehill Hannity is an idiot.
@PressSec You idiot!  The Republicans control both chambers!  This means republican members are voting NO!  Don’t blame this on the Democrats!  This is all on your party and the White House!
@SpeakerRyan You control BOTH Chambers of Congress.  How stupid can you be!
RT @CBSNews: A man left a Mason jar filled with explosive chemicals and nails at an airport in Asheville, N.C., FBI says https://t.co/Ymp8E…
@amandablount2 I'll come out and say it.  Wrong ethnic group.
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump Really?  I will very possibly have to sign a god damn furlough letter because of this Congress?  2018 midterm elections will signal change.
@kyledcheney @MajorCBS @realDonaldTrump Maybe if Mr. Cobb's Client didn't make it a habit of blabbing on TWITTER he wouldn't have to worry about perjury.  He should spend more time telling his client to shut up and stay off so twitter.
@SteveScalise Your party controls BOTH House of Congress AND the White House.  Blame your fellow GOPers who voted with the Democrats!
@SenateMajLdr You control BOTH houses of Congress!  You couldn't lead yourself out of a wet paper bag!  You are a worthless person and poor leader.  PASS the damn BILL!  We in Alabama will be affected to YOUR IDIOT!
@SenateMajLdr How is it you control both houses of Congress and STILL have in-fighting with members of your OWN DAMN PARTY!  This is not on the DEMS.  This is ALL on you, Speaker Ryan and the GOP for being idiots.  PASS THE DAMN CR!  We will vote you and the others out in November.
@SpeakerRyan MORON!  Your party controls both chambers AND the White House.  Face it members of your own damn party are voting against this CR!  This is not on the DEMS.  This is your own damn party doing this crap.
@newtgingrich @POTUS You idiot!  There are Republicans who are not in support of the CR and will voting WITH the Democrats.  Your party Controls the House, Senate AND The White House.  The GOP couldn't lead yourself out of a wet goddamn paper bag! This is not on the Dems. This is on the GOP!
@realDonaldTrump I do not like having to go in and sign a Damn FURLOUGH Letter because Congress can't get their collective heads our of their asses.  You control the House, Senate AND the White House.  Get it together and pass a damn real BUDGET TOO!  No More CR's a REAL BUDGET!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You idiot!  It means there are Republicans who are voting WITH the Democrats!  What do you not get.  The GOP doesn’t have the votes because for of their party are putting Country BEFORE Party!
@marcorubio Coward.  Politicians like you make me sick.  I hope you get voted out.  We need elected officials who serve the PEOPLE not special interest.
@IvankaTrump @tim_cook We took an oath to protect and defend.  We process passports, SSA Benefits, Tax returns and Mail.  We are proud of our jobs. We keep the mission going as appointees come and go. We are loyal to the mission. We are also tired with no help coming.  We need a budget passed.
@realDonaldTrump Gaslight Much?
@kylegriffin1 You don't make policy by TWITTER.  Got the WH is a bunch of idiots.
@senorrinhatch I won't see any increase in my paycheck.  You and the others are Liars!
@jasoninthehouse God you are a moron.
@SenatorShaheen So you will muck with my pay to prove a point?  Civil Servants are not pawns.  We are people who have to pay the damn bills!  We process Passports, SSA, deliver mail, process tax returns and you treat us like SHIT!  Pass a damn budget.
@chrisgeidner @pdmcleod They control BOTH Chambers and they can't get either act together!  I will not be happy with about a shutdown.
@cathymcmorris @jimmykimmel You control BOTH chambers of Congress.  You own this mess.  You made this mess.  FIX IT!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @VP @SenatorDole You don't deserve to be up there with the Great Senator Dole.  He served with HONOR.  He earned a Purple Heart.  He was injured for this country.  You are a disgrace!
@SpeakerRyan @SenatorDole You are not on the same playing field as Senator Dole.  He served his country with pride.  He was wounded FOR his Country.  He went to WAR for his country.  You didn't serve your country in Uniform.  You are a spoiled brat of a Politician.  I hope you are voted out.
@SpeakerRyan You control BOTH chambers of CONGRESS!  You couldn't find your head from the hole in the wall!  You own this stinking pile of POO!  Country BEFORE Party.  Stop letting special interest control you!
@SpeakerRyan Midterm elections are coming and I hope you lose your House and Speaker seat.  You are a greedy and paid for by special interest.
@IvankaTrump @SecretaryAcosta @USDOL So you can benefit from this?  You don't even make your goods in the UNITED STATES!  You are the problem with shipping jobs overseas to maximize your profits.  You need to practice what you preach.  Bring your companies back to the United States to give people JOBS! Hypocrite!
It's 1:40 in the morning and I'm awake!  Why?  Insomnia and random arm goes numb.
@MSNBC Says the man who's father got his sonny boy out of how many DUI's?  Gaetz is complicit as the others.  Who's in his wallet?  How many questionable donors?
@johncusack Lets face it.  POTUS is 6'1" and Obese.
@AynRandPaulRyan I'll be livid again if they cause another shutdown.
@ALT_uscis @ICEgov @sfchronicle The ICE Director looks like the villain from Goldfinger!
@aravosis Here is James Comey who his 6' 8" and approximately 243 next to POTUS.  Photo is from USA Today.  Want to give them credit. https://t.co/O3WK6tPCSB
@aravosis Comey is 6'8" and dwarfed the President.  Former Senator Luther Strange is 6'9".  There is NO WAY the President is 6'3".
@ALT_uscis There is now way the President 6 foot 3 a 239 pound.  He is no Dwayne Johnson.
@20committee Cool can't wait!
@IvankaTrump @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SBALinda @SecElaineChao @SBAgov @USDOT Go back to selling purses and shoes.
@WilDonnelly Well....I think Paulie Walnuts (Manafort) will have a mate in prison when they both are sent to the big house.  For people who claim to have done nothing wrong, they behave like they are guilty as hell!
@NatashaBertrand Here is what I don't get.  If the WH says they did nothing wrong.  WHY are they trying to cover up and stop people from testifying?  If they are innocent then talk freely.  They behave like they are guilty of something.
@NatashaBertrand Yeah...He plays this with Mueller's team he's going to JAIL!
@CBSNews The real President Trump?   Oh my god did he just say that?  Oh NOW he wants to grow a spine!  Good for you Senator, here is a gold star! https://t.co/GBPJt7xkdY
@WhiteHouse It is not a license to discriminate either.
@SenTomCotton @hughhewitt You are paid off by Special Interest.  You believe in Party over Country. You believe in Corporate American NOT the American People.  2018 midterm elections are coming.  I hope you are the minority party not the majority.
@cathymcmorris Yeah.  The Walmart bonuses have strings attached.  Many will not benefit from it.  How do you explain the 60 plus Sam's Clubs suddenly closing?  You tax the hell out of my bonuses!  2018 Midterm Elections are coming.
@AynRandPaulRyan Jim Acosta is on his twitter page saying it was directed at him.  This is not right.  You don't kick a journalist out because you disagree with them.
@Susan_Hennessey It's not.  The is wrong on every front.  we don't do this in America!
@CREWcrew Again!  How is this NOT a violation of the Constitution?  I'm going to say it.  If Former President Obama did this he would already be impeached.  This is not right!
@Acosta Keep doing what you do best.  Which is reporting the truth.
@BetsyDeVosED Clueless.  You are lining your damn pockets with those two contracts you awarded.  You have a vested interest in one of them.  SHAME ON YOU!  You are not fit to be Secretary of Education.
@amperssand @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth @SenFeinstein @SenWarren @RepHultgren I'm tired of Congress using us as pawns. We are over-worked, under-staffed. I can retire in five years under Minimum Retirement Age. I may do it if things do not get better.  Congress needs a kick in the shorts with midterm elections.  They all are placing party before country!
@amperssand @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth @SenFeinstein @SenWarren @RepHultgren I'm one of those affect by a shutdown. I was PISSED when furloughed with a pay cut. I was livid for the 10 day shutdown. They need to grow the hell up and behave like adults and not petty teenagers in a MOVIE! I'm not a pawn in their game who has a bigger stick!
@NewsHour I thought today was the day he would release the information?  Or is the President pressing for information to be withheld.  Transparency is not a friend to the WH.  If he says he's healthy as a freaking horse.  Release the information.
@Acosta To them the truth hurts.  The WH Aides would rather silence the truth than hear it.  Keep up the good work Mr. Acosta!
Breakfast of champions! 2 eggs with leftover roasted veggies, grilled onions and avocado!  Still have to take my fish oil, turmeric supplement and Naproxen https://t.co/j9o2dryPYr
@amandablount2 How’s the weather in your part of the stated?
@SpeakerRyan Hey moron.   How many of these companies are laying off workers, cutting hours, closing stores, closing plants and automating plants?  They are lining their pockets and share holders.  They are not helping workers.
@Alt_Spicerlies @TrueFactsStated Oh my Corey and Hope had a lovers spat in public.
@CREWcrew WTF is WRONG with these people!  How is it the alarm bells are not ringing NON-STOP!  Danger! Will Robinson!  DANGER!  Barbie and Ken need to get their damn heads out of their ASS and listen to the experts!
@kylegriffin1 Oh my god!  Why do both of those nitwits still have a clearance!
@seanspicer @CNN Stop gaslighting.  You are a damn military officer.  Behave like you have some sense of ethical behavior!
RT @loa_thesecret: Never push a loyal person to the point where they no longer care.
@Alt_Spicerlies @jaredkushner It pisses me off he and his little Barbie wife are getting a free ride on the lying!  You are correct NORMAL Federal folks are sitting in jail.
@CREWcrew No you get one bite at the apples and that goes for the SF 86 TOO.  Can't fill it out then out the door!
@TomCottonAR @RepRodBlum You control both houses!  You have the damn votes stop making excuses and pass a damn budget! You the GOP are threatening to shutdown the government.  Stop mucking with the civil servants jobs and paychecks.  Go the hell up!
@Alt_Spicerlies Is this related to the Indictment in Maryland of Mr. Lambert?
@RepRodBlum Carrier laid off people AFTER the big deal in 2016.  Walmart suddenly closed 63 Sam's Club Stores suddenly.  Other bonuses were already agreed on BEFORE the damn bill.  Negotiated BY the UNION!  Others may be bringing factories back but it will be manned by robots NOT by people!
@cathymcmorris You and many others do not treat others as equals.  Shame on you.  You and the rest of Congress are self-absorbed media hounds worried only about your own backsides.  Shame on you all.
@brianefallon That's a spoiled F***king Brat!
@WestWingReport How many days did it take for the WH to speak on this?  Too long.
@LindseyGrahamSC Strong  words when you won’t stand up to hate in your own party.  You coward!  Just admit it you took money for power!
@PRyan You are a failure.  You sold your soul to the devil for a win.  You are complicit in turning back Civil Rights Policies for that win.  Just resign.  You are a flaming Coward!
@ChuckGrassley I have lost All respect for you.  You are complicit in everything you do. Who's in your wallet?  Who's paying you to betray the Country?  Tell the truth sir.
@SpeakerRyan Layoffs, Plant Automation (aka ROBOTS), Increased Share Holder moneys.  You are a flaming coward.  You placed Party before Country.  2018 Midterms will signal change in who has the majority.  Just resign now.
@cathymcmorris Take a look in the mirror.  You need to clean up your own GOP FIRST!  Stop placing Party before Country.  You work for the PEOPLE NOT special interest.  2018 Midterms mean the people will vote you out.
@SenTomCotton You are a hypocrite.  You failed to stand up when a very hateful thing was said about the people of Haiti and Africa.  You stood there like a coward not saying a word to condemn it.  You have selective memory retention. You placed Party before Country. Resign you coward
@DonaldJTrumpJr They are also laying off people through store closures.  Some will have to reapply for lower paying jobs.  This was to line the pockets of the shareholders.
@PressSec @BillClinton @GovMikeHuckabee Why do you still lie for the WH?  When will you stop being complicit and tell the truth.  You work for someone who is turning back the clock!
@mattwaxman1 The staff in the WH do not speak for us Civil Servants.
@amandablount2 Know the feeling right.  Huddled under a blanket and heating pad.
@TomCottonAR Do shut up.  You control the House, Senate AND the WH.  If the government is shutdown it is because if you and the OTHER GOP members!
@amandablount2 Hell I will say it.  You can put lipstick on a pig and it still looks like a pig.  Mrs Sanders is a vile foul mouth woman no matter how much make up they put on her she is a liar and fraud.
@amandablount2 There isn’t enough make up to fix her.  Thinking of the comment people made about Palin.
@cathymcmorris No it means MORE Automation, less jobs and less raises.  Modernizing a factory means robots!  God you people don't learn!
@IvankaTrump I don't benefit from this tax credit.  WHY my kid is over 17!  This will NOT help me one bit!  You are not qualified to be in the WH.
@MeetThePress @RandPaul Is Senator Rand a major moron!  Does he not see the divide this Administration is causing?  He is just as complicit as the others in the GOP.  Hungry for the win you sold your soul to the devil for that win!  What dirt do they have one you Senator!  Country before Party!
@PressSec Then why didn't you set up a two step purchase process!  Why are you positing this on your official twitter account?  Don't you have a personal one?
@PressSec Isn’t this newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch?  Why are you bashing your bosses buddy?
@TrueFactsStated Ryan? Gowdy?
@DearAuntCrabby I know the WH crafted that damn note.  No Navy Doctor would sign that shit!  I know this cause I've had a few of those letters in my time in the Navy AND as a dependent!  The WH is full of shit!  They just put this Officer in a big pickle and they don't care!
@cathymcmorris How many of those bonuses were paid to people losing their jobs!  How many of  those bonuses were already decided by a Collective Bargaining Agreement!  Get your damn facts STRAIGHT!
@Scavino45 Your staff spelled the doctor's name wrong.  I'm thinking he didn't release it.
@TrueFactsStated I'm ashamed the WH is making a mockery out of the Military Treatment Facility that serves so many men and women of the military and their families.
@TrueFactsStated The WH placed the Admiral in a serious pickle with that stupid stunt.
@HuffPost The Admiral did not write that statement.  That was the WH staff trying to put a spin on the matter.  He's not in excellent health.  He guzzles Diet Coke and fast food.  My guess he's still overweight and has high cholesterol.
@RVAwonk We know he did this to make it look like he's the perfect bill of health.
@RogueSNRadvisor Why does this man think he has to fudge his medical findings to prove a point!  He's overweight and eats a poor diet!
@Ann_Early @LordDarthBob @ALT_uscis @WtfAmerica4 They put this person in an awkward pickle.  Hate the military medical system is caught in this mess that is POTUS hiding the truth about his health!  Sad times.
@MollyJongFast I had a friend tell me.  If you have to yell or curse you have lost control of the situation and respect of others.
@Ann_Early @LordDarthBob @ALT_uscis @WtfAmerica4 No problem. Ann.  Proud Navy vet here.  I’ve been treated by many a Navy Docs. They are serious about this. POTUS and Co. are spinning the healthy as a horse bit. There is no way he is healthy with his weight and BMI. Hell they couldn’t spell the Rear Admiral’s name right.
@aravosis This is the White House spinning this.  I have a hard time believing this line from a Navy Doctor!  If they rubber stamped this then I will be very disappointed
Okay I'm going to have to get off Twitter before I lose my temper with these stories.  Night all.
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump @Morning_Joe I don't believe a Military Doctor would say this.  I think it is more the WH Staff trying to put a spin on this.  I've had to get those types of letters and they don't play around.  They know it's their ass if they screw up.  Something is not right!
@thehill Because the Navy Doctor DID NOT State that.  The WH is hiding something!
@amandablount2 I don't think this is the Navy Doctor talking, this is more the WH Morons trying to spin this up.  As someone treated by Navy Doctors that is the LAST thing they want to say.
@cnni It was not issued by the doctor I am guessing.  I don’t believe a doctor would be that quick.  My letters have come days after ALL labs are completed.    This is bull crap from the WH.
@thehill Because the doctor did not issue the findings.  It was the WH spinning it!
@kylegriffin1 Means golfing!
@ColMorrisDavis @TRICARE @MilitaryOfficer Notice more being sent to MTF’s for physical therapy now along with medications.
@SenTomCotton @sendavidperdue Liar Liar Pants on Fire Coward!
@PressSec Stop lying to the American People.  We want the FULL truth Madame Press Secretary.
@SpeakerRyan Why is Carrier laying off people and Walmart closing Sam's Club if this new Bill is to help them?  Cause they are padding their share holder's wallets.
@DrDenaGrayson Did it come directly from the doctor OR the WH Staff.  If it is from the Staff I wouldn't trust it with a ten foot pool. I don't think he's in excellent health.  I think he's overweight, high cholesterol and lord knows what else is going on with him.
@Ann_Early @LordDarthBob @ALT_uscis @WtfAmerica4 The Doctor who examined him is NOT an Army Doctor but a Navy Rear Admiral.  POTUS will spin this.
@ALT_uscis Are all of his staff a bunch of snowflakes?  Seems every time you call their BS they block people.
@DearAuntCrabby So NOW he shows Ben Carson!  God what a freaking hypocrite the man is.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I thought it was recorded?
@realDonaldTrump Geez roll the video footage!
@nytimes Right.  You are one of the enablers.
@realDonaldTrump How much of the new plant will be automated by robots!
@PalmerReport I tried to view the story said your site was offline!
@SenateMajLdr Hey here is the link to the oath you took to support and defense the constitution!  https://t.co/OvCoREJzXE
@ChuckGrassley When?  I will never see this increase.  You sold your soul to the devil.  You took an oath to Support and Defend the Constitution.  In case you forgot that oath, here is the link.  https://t.co/OvCoREJzXE
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do You also know Walmart is closing stores TOO!!!  Some of those people are getting bonuses and pink slips!  This corporate tax cut is not going to spur wages, it's going to spur Share Holders pockets!
@GOPLeader If this is helping corporations, then why is Carrier, Walmart and others giving bonuses, laying off workers and closing stores!  Show us the proof this helps the American Workers!
@PressSec Yet you talk of suppressing votes and rights here!
@PressSec Sure they are giving bonuses and a pink slip to go along with that.  Do you check your facts before posting?
@SpeakerRyan How many of those bonus are related to lay-offs?  These corporations are not giving these savings to the employee they are giving it to their SHAREHOLDERS!
@KellyannePolls @ChrisCuomo Do you have an OFF switch?  Tired of you gaslighting every damn time you get on tv.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It wa originally paid for my a GOP donor.  Don’t forget that
@PressSec Where are these gains?  I haven’t seen this miracle tax reduction you moron.
@RepMattGaetz @HillaryClinton You swore to support and defend the Constitution.  Remember that oath?You serve the PEOPLE.  Not special interest.  Remember that.  Country BEFORE Party.  Let Mueller complete his investigation and present his report.  What are you afraid of?
@Alt_Spicerlies Wow.  I guess Mr. Cohen has some thin-skin!  What is up with those snowflakes!  Keep up the good work Mic!
@TrueFactsStated I'm thinking him and the former Chief of Staff have both cut a deal with Mueller and company.   I hope McGahn loses his license to practice law for his conduct!
@kurteichenwald @ChuckGrassley Hey @ChuckGrassley Here is the link to the oath you took to support and defend the Constitution!	https://t.co/OvCoREJzXE
@amperssand @LindseyGrahamSC In case you forgot the Oath you swore upon.  Here is the Link directly from the Senate website! Read it again to understand the meaning.  Country before Party.	  https://t.co/OvCoREJzXE
@amperssand @LindseyGrahamSC Senator Graham is complicit in his behavior. I use to have great respect for him and his work.  I'm ashamed of him. He placed Party before Country. He has forgotten the Oath he took to protect and defend the Constitution.  I consider him a coward. He serves the People of the USA!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Really?  Low taxes on the utility bills.  Are you truly that daft!  Again!  How are these cuts going to pay for themselves?
@SpeakerRyan @rep_stevewomack @housebudgetGOP You coward!
@GOPLeader I will not see an increase in wages because it will be off set by my rising healthcare premiums, rising contributions to retirement and the lousy 1.9% raise that was graciously given.  Doing more with less people sucks by the way.  You Congressman and Congress are to blame.
@CREWcrew BULLSHIT!  Ivanka AND Jared never served in the military and don't know sacrifice for the Nation.  They are both basking in their Daddy's Money and Position.  There are families who lost loved ones who served this country.  Barbie and her Ken need to go back to New York.
@CLewandowski_ Civilian Servants are LOYAL to the COUNTRY and CONSTITUTION!  That is the OATH they took.  Support and Defend the Constitution!  Got That!
@DonaldJTrumpJr The College players were not on the field!  He wants to prove a point?  Then Go to one of the NFL Playoff GAMES!
@Nominated @KaivanShroff @SethAbramson Realizing the players were not on the field but in the tunnels waiting to come out afterwards!
@nytimes The College Players WERE NOT on the field during the anthem!  That is the difference!
@thehill Those two do not know the first thing about sacrifice?  There are men and women who died for this country so those two spoiled brats can walk around like Leona Hemsley!  Those two never put on a uniform and served their damn country.  They basked in their daddy's money!
@SenateGOP @townhallcom How many of them are losing their jobs too
@waltshaub @tribelaw Forgot the swaying like a kid at the school music program.  At least he wasn’t picking his nose!
@WithHer2017 @realDonaldTrump Looked like a kid at a school music program who can’t stand still !
@jfreewright It was funny to watch!
@realDonaldTrump Learn the words to the National Anthem.  We all saw the video!  It will be on the highlights reel!
@AConservLiberal @williamlegate @lauferlaw Inquiring minds would LOVE to see that video!
@ActualEPAFacts It was like watching my kids when they were little at a school music program.  Couldn’t stand still like he had ants in his pants.
@KevinMKruse @BadLipReading Think my lab mix and basset hound could have lip synced it better!
@williamlegate @lauferlaw He doesn’t know the damn words.  It was sad to watch
@cmclymer He looked fucking lost.
@modernhomesla @Alt_Spicerlies @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @GOP @realDonaldTrump Congress will be in session.  My ass will be home pissed as hell at those babies in Congress messing with my god damn paycheck
@Alt_Spicerlies @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @GOP @realDonaldTrump Oh hell No.  I will not deal with another damn shutdown because those congressional babies can’t get their shit together!  We will vote their asses out!
@cmclymer He will gloat once he is back in the box suite.  Oh the players were in the locker room
@cmclymer Yeah noticed that.  Watch him tweet about the players standing!
@HouseGOP You all lack the spine to do what is right.  Too hungry for power you don't see the red flags.  You have lost this moderate GOP Voter.  I will always vote Country before Party.  2018 Midterm Elections are coming we are going to vote you OUT!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Keep smoking whatever crap you're selling.  You are not making any sense.  You too sold your soul to the devil for power.
@SenateMajLdr According to the American People you sold us out for Power and Money!  How much money did those donors give you to look the other way?  What are they holding over your head to keep you in line?  You are a Coward who lacks a Spine.  The people will speak and vote you out!
@WestWingReport @realDonaldTrump Good god.  Come on can we have our College Football without the DAMN Drama!
@TheRickWilson Miller is not Adult Supervision.  He's one of the toddlers running wild.  Kelly has his hands full keeping them ALL in line.
@TIME A REAL doctor is examining him.  Finally have REAL results into his health.  I don't think he's well.  Hopefully, this will shed some light on what really is going on.
@PressSec Why is it you stand there and fuel the flames of discord?  Whatever happened to telling the truth and being honest!  Stop gaslighting and tell the truth!  You have lost this GOP voter.  I place COUNTRY before Party.
@amandablount2 @LindseyGrahamSC Someone has dirt on the Senator.  That is the only reason why he would turn-tail and fall in line with the others.  He'll be complicit to the end.  I had a lot of respect for him.  Now?  Not so much.  He places Party before Country selling out the people he represents.
@Newsweek You mean the part where Miller went off the rails talking over the host?  Sorry he got what he deserved!
@joncoopertweets @Lady_Sisyphus22 @LindseyGrahamSC I’m thinking maybe both.  The DNC and RNC were both hacked and only the DNC emails were released.
@AltUSPressSec There is not enough make up and hairspray to pretty up some of them.  They are a hot mess.
@20committee Hopefully Mueller will take care of the cockroaches.  Place them all in orange jumpsuits.
@CREWcrew Zinke is a liar and cheat.  You know he and his wife are benefiting off this.
@RepSwalwell @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump It is because someone has something on him to keep him in line.  Congress do something!  Instead of standing around with your heads halfway up your arse!  This is NOT normal this is red flags all over the place!
@Alt_Spicerlies @IvankaTrump She learned from the best!  Her father on how to stiff your suppliers!
@Alt_Spicerlies Waiting with anticipation.  You have some of the best scoops!
@ColMorrisDavis @DearAuntCrabby Riff-Raff needs to go back to being Keebler Sessions minion.  Miller is dangerous.
@CREWcrew Why is this man STILL working in the WH.  Normal Feds would have been FIRED!  Why does he still have and interim after lying on his SF-86!  Why!
@IamHappyToast Well done! https://t.co/HvLKcQnxeY
RT @MaureenShaw: DON'T EVER ASK WHY WOMEN DON'T REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT. EVER AGAIN. https://t.co/RJfFZHszr3
@SenatorBurr @NFL @Panthers @Saints Do your job and protect Mueller from those trying to fire him.
@DearAuntCrabby If his princess is indicted I think he'll come unglued FAST.
@newtgingrich If these people did nothing wrong why are they expending SO much effort to gaslight everything.  Let Mueller finish the investigation! If they feel they are in the right then SHUT UP and let the report come out. You too have to stop gaslighting. You are not helping the situation!
@SpeakerRyan CONGRESS is at fault!  You mandated Sequestration, you mandated 25%  Government personnel cuts, you shut the government down for 10 days AND You caused a 20% pay cut to furlough. You are a self-absorbed COWARD.  You do not speak for the men and women who proudly served.
@realDonaldTrump Give it a break with the gaslighting.
@thehill If he leaves it's because he cut a deal with Mueller along with the Former Chief of Staff.
@RepKevinBrady Companies gave people bonuses and now they are being laid  off in the spring. You are a HYPOCRITE!  This is not going to spur spending?  Corporations are going to line their shareholders pockets and stiff their employees.  You are stupid.
@IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse What are your qualifications?
@AprilDRyan @CNNSotu @realDonaldTrump His father gave him money, paid for a worthless degree and he behaves like a child.   He has bankrupted business, he has been married 3 times, and has five children with three wives.  If this was Obama, the GOP would be outraged! GOP are Hypocrites and complicit enablers!
@FaceTheNation I have swamp land in the Sahara I will sell you with the Director's statement.  The President has to have pictures and bullet points to keep his attention!!!!
@amandablount2 Oh hey...Mr. Mercer I didn't mean that.  Bannon is a bald-face liar and drunk.  Mueller is coming for the rats.
@RepDLamborn You and your congressional swamp creatures gave Federal Workers a LOUSY 1.9% pay increase.  We are doing more work with less people.  We are retiring because you call us lazy.  We are people who process benefits, passports, mail etc.  WAKE UP!  You are complicit in your behavior!
@SenateGOP @MikeCrapo Last I looked I will not see these magical cuts and higher take home pay.  I will see a $100 decrease in taxes but lose it to raised healthcare premiums, retirement benefits and in the long run increased taxes.  You all are complicit in you lying to the people.  Just resign.
@arappeport Graham is a complicit idiot.  He is enabling behaviors and sold out the people of his state for Special Interest.  @LindseyGrahamSC you are a sell out and an idiot!
@GOPLeader History will remember you are a complicit follower, an enabler and do the work of the Special Interest groups.  You have consistently placed Party over Country.  You have sold your out for those Special Interest Donors. You will be voted out in November.
@SpeakerRyan @WhiteHouse Complicit moron.  Who paid you to put Party before Country!  I hope you are voted out in November.  You only listen to special interest NOT the people of your district.  COWARD.
@TVietor08 @PRyan Ryan benefited from those benefits.  It paid his college tuition!  Social Security is NOT an entitlement.  I pay that tax every damn two weeks from my pay Ryan.  He's a complicit moron.
@DrDenaGrayson @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC Graham sold his soul to the devil and it will backfire at some point.  When the shit hits the fan who will remain standing and clean.  My bet...Not Graham or Grassley to name a few will not come out smelling like a rose but horse manure!  They placed Party before Country.
@CBSNews @FaceTheNation I don't trust Pompeo.
@MSNBC I still think someone has dirt on Graham to make him complicit with the Agenda.  He and Grassley have some explaining to do, hell there is a long list of others who have a lot of explaining to do for their lapdog behaviors.
@DrDenaGrayson @TrueFactsStated That is the first thing EVERYONE in the Federal Government is taught!  Beavis and Butthead forgot to take the training.  Hell all of the staff blew off the training.  It will be their downfall.
@TeaPainUSA Someone has dirt on them.  That is the only reason why they are supporting him.  They have lost this GOP voter.  I'll vote for someone who won't be paid off.  If it means voting for the other party so be it! Graham and others are Party before Country.  I am Country before Party!
@PressSec I won't see ANY of this.
@TrueFactsStated Well I can't seem to DM you.  I would like to donate but concerned with something asking for in the form.
@TrueFactsStated Hey Claude.....I sent you a DM.  I have a question.
@TrueFactsStated He still didn't answer the question.  What is the good Congressman hiding?  Wonder if this information is public knowledge?
@KevinMKruse You forgot Riff-Raff.  I'm hearing "Lets do the Time-Warp"  He creeps me out.  I don't trust Miller.  He used to work for the Keebler Elf Sessions.
@nytimes Are you serious?  Really?
@AngrierWHStaff @jaketapper Miller is NOT the sharpest knife in the drawer in the WH.  Miller is more a dim-wit!
@realDonaldTrump Should send someone who is competent to speak about the facts. I thought you hired the best people.  Miller looked like a fool shouting over Mr. Tapper.  If you have to raise your voice you have lost control and respect of others.  Sometimes the best thing is to wait then respond
@RepDLamborn You are a moron.  You realize a majority of their services are for Wellness Examinations and Birth Control Prescriptions.  Keep believing that lie.  This is NOT some episode of The Handmaid's Tale where you can control women and believe Birth Control is bad.
@thehill The same married guy who is possibly sleeping with Hope Hicks!  God did they all leave common sense at the door when signing up for this WH?  God.
@marcorubio Who’s been donating to your campaign!  You sold the people of the United States out to special interest you idiot.  Country before Party.  Grow a spine and do what is right.  If not then we know your are a coward and complicit in this mess.
@Evan_Rosenfeld She is the biggest kiss ass on the planet.
@MeetThePress @MichaelWolffNYC Then someone with BALLS need to have the discussion if they are truly concerned!  Stop tap dancing around the subject!
@JudgeJeanine You sold your soul to the devil.  You call yourself an attorney!  Stop gaslighting!
@HouseGOP Midterm election are coming.  Country before Party.  Grow a spine and do what is right!  You work for the people not special interest!  This GOP voter will always place Country before Party!
@Evan_McMullin @LindseyGrahamSC What is someone has incriminating dirt on the Good Senator.
@CNN Great.
@amandablount2 Congrats on becoming a grandmother!
@PRyan You moron.  You and the rest of the GOP are demonizing the Federal Workforce.  A stinking lousy 1.9% increase while you raise our Health Care premiums, raise our taxes, cut positions AND cut our retirement benefits!  You and Congress KEEP Tricare for Life AND a fat pension. IDIOT
@SteveScalise You have lost this GOP Voter.  You and the rest of the GOP have placed Party before Country.  You have placed Special Interest before the American People.  Shame on you GOP for being complicit in your behavior.
@kylegriffin1 Funny that's not what his fellow classmates and professors said.  They said he was the dumbest student they ever met!
@thehill His father paid for those degrees like he paid for his kids.
@JuddLegum The best education his parents could buy!  This doesn't translate to being smart!
@KellyannePolls @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan So many of you have placed Party before Country.  Shame on ALL of you.  You are looking to line your own bank accounts.  Stop spreading lies!  This tax bill screws people like me over.  It will not lower my taxes in the long run, it will RAISE them.  MORON!
@TrueFactsStated @FrancisRooney yes....What about Dowdy?
Going to be lingering around.  Still cold here and the office crud has found its way to me.  Stay Frosty team!
@LindseyGrahamSC Can't believe you are placing Party before Country.  How much did this cost in in the amount of donor dollars! Coward!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Wages Grew?  I'm getting a lousy 1.9 percent Increase to off-set higher costs of healthcare premiums AND retirement benefits!
@TrueFactsStated Can we do one for Gowdy and company?
@SenBlumenthal More needs to be done to protect Mueller from Ryan, Nunes, Gowdy, Gaetz and others!  This is not right!  This is not NORMAL!
@NormEisen Many of us are losing hope. Just hope I have a JOB at the end of 2018.  The GOP think the Feds are useless. We are tired of doing the work of three people and paid PEANUTS! Tired of pay freezes. After taxes, pension, health care close to nothing left! This is not normal at all!
@GOP @SteveScalise You're freezing the feds pay, making us pay more in taxes, retirement and benefits.  You and your brethren call us lazy and non-essential.  We are leaving because of Congress and their lies.  People who were furloughed and home for a shut down. We have served with honor.  Morons!
@jasoninthehouse There is no systemic problem in DOJ.  You're upset that they are doing their JOBS.  Stop attacking the loyal men and women who work for the DOJ.  These are career federal workers uploading the constitution and the LAWS of the United States.  Shame on you.
@SenateMajLdr How are you helping the vets?  Do you know some of us having trying to get services only to be turned away.  You are complicit in your behavior.  You are a coward.
@GOP You are consistently placing Party before Country.  This is not the GOP I've supported.  This is elected officials serving their own special interest above the people who elected them.  You are enabling this soap opera.  Grow up and open your eyes.
@WestWingReport @realDonaldTrump WOW!!!! I'm speechless.
@kylegriffin1 Coffee boy had too much Russian Water (aka Vodka).
@amandablount2 For some it's 🍞🥛🥚 and🍺.  Priorities man!  LOL
@amandablount2 I just want it warm up so I don't ache all the damn TIME!  Don't know how many containers of Tiger Balm and Aleve we have gone through the last several weeks because of this cold snap!
@CREWcrew Normal people in the Federal Government with this many non-disclosures on their forms would be terminated!  Jared should not be working there or handling sensitive information.  Sends a very bad message to the rest of the Federal Workforce.  Double-Standards
@Alt_Spicerlies @VP @realDonaldTrump You are on a roll.
@ALT_uscis Gold Digger and her Sugar Daddy
@CREWcrew Pretty sure Mueller has several under close watch.  He isn't going to show his hand YET!  He'll let  them sweat a little longer!
@JesseFFerguson It will be like the visitor logs.  Missing.
@kylegriffin1 How about we go back to PAPER Ballots!  In other parts of the world they do this!
@20committee Could this explain why certain members of Congress are suddenly on-board with the Agenda?  Those emails have dirt on them and is being used to keep them in line?
@thehill Let's see I have payroll deductions that tell me I pay into Social Security and other benefits.
@amandablount2 LOL.  I should be sleep but still awake.
@amandablount2 Happy New Year!!!!!  Glad I'm not the only night owl up!
Happy New Year! https://t.co/TscQGyUGsU

@ReallyDontTrump @TrueFactsStated This sums up Mrs. Linton. https://t.co/xb7ZdapWOz
@thehill The Good  Senator is acting like a damn coward.  Remember the RNC was hacked too.  Wonder what they have on him and others to get them to fall in line?
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Do more with less.  Tell that to the people who need help talking to the IRS, SSA, VA State Department on problems.  Honestly, I'm sick and tired or picking up the slack for all of this horse crap.
@gbennettpost His wife looks like a gold digger.  If it wasn't for the fact he's stinking RICH she would NOT be with Mnuchin!  Sorry, There is NOT enough Alcohol in the world to be seen with him.
@thehill How about American Citizen's should be heard!
@CREWcrew I can thinking of better ways of spending that kind of money.  Like paring down bills and improvements to my HOUSE!  Sorry, Mnuchin's spouse makes me think of Kanye's song.  Gold-Digger Mrs. Linton is. https://t.co/nyMxBJNMlO
@nytimes Geez....How much did you get paid to print that headline?
Nice to have the kids over to celebrate the youngest birthday.  Sparkling Wine is chilling and in three hours New Years Eve Snacks will be warmed and ready for eating.
@kylegriffin1 No Thank you.  I can spend that amount of money on something better.
@SenateGOP Put Party Before Country 	Paid Off by Donors	Lacks the Spine to put Country FIRST
@amandablount2 Hope you feel better.  Bundle up the windchill is going to get bad today and tomorrow.
@kylegriffin1 Means he will be golfing again.
@Alt_Spicerlies His fellow Navy Seals don't respect him.  He got in trouble for submitting questionable  travel vouchers.  He is the worse Interior Secretary on the planet!
@Alt_Spicerlies I think I'm going to vomit! How much more trashy can Barbie get!
@PalmerReport He's flat broke and up to his eyeballs in debt to banks overseas!  He's filed bankruptcy how many times?  Make a deal with the Devil and the Bill comes due every time! https://t.co/ACSa5HyZG9
@funder That is some funny stuff.  Georgie can't hold his booze lets his loose lips talk and the Aussie's turns his ass in!  Love this.

@amandablount2 Had to tossed that GO piece in there!  LOL.
@amandablount2 Or in the case of some General Officers.....Pillow talk gets you in hot water too.
@amandablount2 Many things have been leaked by our members of Congress after one too many drinks.  Loose lips sinks Ships!
@benjaminwittes So Coffee Boy couldn't hold his liquor and had a chatty conversation with an Aussie who turned his ass into the FBI.  LOVE IT!!!

@ALT_uscis I hope POTUS got a legal review on that AND paid for those coins.

@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Oh dear GOD!  Stop deflecting!  You had your time to do an investigation when Obama was in the White House.  NOW you decide to do something!  Okay.  You just lost this GOP Voter.
@RepAdamSchiff So that means I'll probably have to sign a god blessed Furlough letter on CHRISTMAS!  Congress get your heads out of your collective ASSES and pass a damn BUDGET!
@HouseDemocrats Then get your collective heads out of your arse and pass a damn budget!
@HouseGOP How much of this was ALREADY PLANNED!  Get your facts straight.  Most were agreed upon by their UNIONS!
@SteveScalise @SpeakerRyan @senorrinhatch @POTUS So in 2025 the corporate tax cut will stay but taxpayers will get screwed.  How is that helping?  I drop a 3 percentage points in the new tax bracket but STILL will probably OWE!  This helps no one.  You are catering to your donors NOT THE people.  You've lost this GOP voter.
@IvankaTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Then in 2025 they will go away.  Moron!
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump I'll trust Karl Rove before I trust you.
@ChuckGrassley @POTUS What are you going to do to protect the Special Counsel?
@sam_vinograd @USTreasury @HillaryClinton As someone familiar with how these work.  There are some pretty STUPID people in DOJ and Congress who don't understand how a CFIUS matter WORKS!  Then Secretary of State Clinton didn't have the final approval!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump How many of these were already approved by the collective bargaining agreement?  You forget about that part!
Going to impose a Social Media pause.  Will be lurking but not responding much.
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris You Morons.   How in the hell is this going to benefit me.  I want honest numbers.  I want to know at the end of 2018 will I have to once again write a damn check to the IRS!  I take the max out for withholding and STILL PAY!
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump I'll be the one FUCKED because of the mouth-breathers in Congress!  I get leave cancelled and have to go in and sign a letter placing me on furlough.  Tired of their fucking shit. (Excuse the language long day dealing with idiots)
Almost my Friday!  One more day and get to enjoy the holidays with the family.
@SenateMajLdr Coward.  You placed Party over Country.  Hope it was worth it to line your damn war chest.  2018 the voters will speak when they vote in a new majority.  You moron.
@SpeakerRyan You coward.  2018 will be the year the voters remove you from office.  You sold your soul to corporate donors over the people.  You don't represent the People you represent the HIGHEST BIDDING DONOR!  Who has been donating to your campaign.
@IvankaTrump Yes it's good for you because you will greatly benefit from this bill.  The working people deserve better.  How about you start being truthful.  Start behaving ethically in your job as an employee in the executive branch.
@PressSec I will see short term cuts then a rise in my taxes. Hope this win was worth it because it's on the backs of the people who are supposed to be helping.  Hidden in there is cuts to Social Security too.
@SenDeanHeller I will maybe see initial cuts but it will go back to costing me more down the road AND I won't get Social Security when i finally retire.  You know the money I have taken out of my check every two weeks.  How much are you getting in donations from Donors.
Well bedtime for me.  Hoping insomnia will not strike again.  Tomorrow is a new day.
@PRyan Grow a spine you coward.  Sold out your country to donors and corporate America.
@SenateGOP @JimInhofe You just lost this GOP voter for independent candidates.  Sold yourself for those Damn donors.
@jasoninthehouse @FoxNews Coward.  Sold your soul to the donors.  Resigned before they punished you for leaking sensitive information
@PressSec Isn’t past your bedtime.  Just go to bed now
@SenTedCruz Oh do stop whining like a damn baby!  Separation of Church and State you moron,  Country before Party.  Sold your soul to the donors.  I hope you lose the majority in both chambers
When you leave work and wonder.  WTF happened today!
@ColMorrisDavis @facebook @Twitter My account was restricted for 12 hours one time and they didn't give me a reason.
@KellyannePolls @politico Why must we deal with your gaslighting?  Tell the truth!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You have a credibility problem.  You can’t seem to tell the truth.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Try talking the Nunes.  He seems to be a stooge.
@funder @RepMattGaetz I'm trying to figure out how this repeat DUI offender was elected?  Your average citizen would STILL be in jail.
@RepMattGaetz @ABC Okay....I'm confused.  How many times has this man been charged with a DUI?
@mitchellvii Why are you showing a photo of the team with the WORST record as proof.  Cleveland is 0 and 14!
@AngrierWHStaff The WH Counsels can try but they will lose.  If they felt it was improperly done, why go to Congress and not the Courts?  Inquiring minds want to know.
@GOP You need to protect Mueller so he can continue his work.   Country over Party.  Do what is right for the COUNTRY.
@NatashaBertrand Typically that is how they get them.  Handled a few of those type of requests.  Generates a lot of stuff to sift through.
@ABC Clearly, they don't understand.  When you get a .gov email, gov computer, on gov server in a gov building.  The little pop up banner tells you, you're accessing the US government and subject to monitoring etc.  Those emails were properly obtained.
@waltshaub Wow.  OSC is going to have fun with them.  They (WH Staff) never learn.
@Scavino45 Wow.  You are keeping OSC busy with all these Hatch Act violations.
@Mopshell @ericgarland @aliasvaughn Very similar to the banner I see.
@HouseGOP Protect the Special Counsel from being fired!  If you won't we will vote you out in 2018.
@MarkHertling Finally someone who understands!  Thank you sir.
@WilDonnelly What the HELL!  This makes it harder for some companies and the federal government to forecast travel expenses!
@SangerNYT Everyone who works for the federal government sees a pop up banner on their Government computer.  The banner informs you, you're accessing a Government site and subject to monitoring by LE etc.  Those are the governments files.  The emails and devices were legally obtained.
@Newsweek These emails were gained lawfully.   Every computer in the federal government has a pop up banner saying subject to monitoring by LE etc.  This is .gov emails, gov server, on gov equipment and in a gov building.
@RVAwonk Hence why government furnished equipment have this nice banner that lets you know.  You are accessing a government network and subject to monitoring.  There is no privacy on government networks
Mueller staying one step ahead of all of them. https://t.co/R4zHMmZtrx
@DrDenaGrayson There is a method to Mueller’s investigation.  He is already ahead of the game.
@millertimo @aliasvaughn Yeppers.  It's annoying but lets you know.
@SLSmith000 WH Counsel are clearly Better Call Saul Attorneys at Law. They will do some shady shit to win.  They didn't count on Mueller.  We know the reason why Firms in the DC/VA/MD area refused to take the case. They didn't want to be tainted by the lies and a client that will not listen.
@Plantflowes @aliasvaughn 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@TeaPainUSA Wonder who will have a cell with Big Bubba?  LOL
@Plantflowes @aliasvaughn With a nice roommate named Bubba.  😂😂😂😂
@Alt_Spicerlies @renato_mariotti This is not Mueller's first rodeo and it won't be his last rodeo. He is miles ahead of the "Better Call Saul" Attorneys at Law!  WH Counsel are out of their league.  Here is my question.  Is this a target release of information or is the WH Counsel getting desperate?
@Plantflowes @aliasvaughn Their arrogance will get them nothing.
Alright Twitter Peeps.  I'm going to head off to enjoy some Netflix movies and corral the dog inside.  Night all
@MRSSMH2 Good god.  What do those moron's not understand.  Government Email, Government Computer, Government Server.  Letter, Warrant, Subpoena or FOIA.  Mueller did it correctly to get those emails.
@lennoxskyler @aliasvaughn I've heard that before.  Didn't help them when the judge comes a calling.
@CathyLarson16 Maybe they are hoping the sheep will take pity on their stupidity.  I'm not falling for it here.  This will bite them in the ass!
@DerWouter @aliasvaughn LOL.  My 18 year old has already formed an opinion and thinks they are idiots in the WH!
@DerWouter @aliasvaughn Good God.  My 18 year old could give then better legal advice!
@aliasvaughn God what is wrong with the WH Counsel and their minions.  The Transition team had .gov email addresses, on a GSA Email server, in a GSA building, on a damn government computer.  All are subject to monitoring.  Mueller did everything right in getting those emails.
@ericgarland Mueller had the proper permissions. It is the WH Counsel that doesn't understand.  Government Systems are subject to monitoring. Meaning the Transition Team .gov email accounts. They should have sat down and completed the training on government computers to know right from wrong.
@EdKrassen Sorry Transition Team, you were accessing a government computer, using a government email. All Subject to monitoring. Mueller had the proper authority to receive the records.  Should have taking the training that would have explained it to you!
@scoonchies @williamlegate @lauferlaw My basset hound follows directions better than his people!
@VeeDub78 @williamlegate @lauferlaw Exactly!
@RadioFreeTom They impeached Clinton for lying about consensual sex with an intern.  What's going on now is Watergate on STEROIDS! The evidence is ALL over the place.
@williamlegate @lauferlaw There is a banner on government computers that tells users they could be subject to monitoring by LE etc.  Government Computer, server, office all subject to monitoring.  Mueller secured these using the proper channels.  WH Attorneys are grasping at straws.
@FoxNews You people are morons.
@chrislhayes There is a nice banner that on government computers that warns you about being subject to monitoring by LE, CI etc.  Those are government RECORDS! On a Government Computer! In a Government Building. Mueller secured the proper authority for emails.
@TeaPainUSA God are POTUS attorneys THAT Stupid.  Every Govt employee gets this banner saying subject to monitoring.  Mueller received those emails lawfully.  There is no such thing as Private Documents on a Government Computer, Office or Desk.  They are grasping for straws!
@Alt_Spicerlies For those of us who work for the government.  There is this banner that pops up telling you the user is accessing a government system.  The user is subject to monitoring by various LE, US Government agencies etc. POTUS has a bunch of idiots working for him!
@WestWingReport Clearly they don't understand.  When you work for the government.  They are not private.  These are government records and files.  Mueller received these through the proper channels.  POTUS has some stupid attorneys working for him with NO background in the government!
@MRSSMH2 He needs to get back on Sassy and ride off to his hole in the ground.  We the people of Alabama spoke and didn’t want his ass!
@FoxNews These are government files on a government server these are not Private docs.  Idiots
@DavidBahnsen How about you place Country over Party.  Do you damn job of protecting the Constitution!
@krassenstein Vote all of them out in 2018.  They are part of the problem
@KamalaHarris Please stop them from trying to remove the SC.
@EdKrassen They are complicit in their actions.  They have their hands in the Russian cookie jar
@MRSSMH2 @RepSwalwell As someone who fights this ALL the time.  POTUS attorney is a flaming idiot!
@RepSwalwell @DavidCornDC Those are government files they need a lesson government records 101.  I battle this ALL the time.
@Evan_Rosenfeld @steveholland1 Sorry try again Langhofer
@RepKevinBrady Historic day you screwed the American People over!  Midterm elections are coming the people will vote for change
@RepJasonSmith @realDonaldTrump Bullshit!
@Alt_Spicerlies @FoxNews Fox News has gone down the toilet.  They are only focused on the precious one.  The Precious One speaks of fairies and unicorns when really Precious is a Hairy Toad.
@amandablount2 WTF!  Has the GOP been watching too many episodes of The Handmaid's Tale?  Ryan and company need to get their collective heads out of their damn arses!
@FoxNews Oh for the love of Pete!  Get your facts straight.  You are feeding this misinformation campaign.
@SenBobCorker You did not write this bastardize bill under the spirit of bipartisanship.  You wrote it with the help of lobbyist and industry experts in secrecy.  You are a sell-out and snake-oil salemane.  Sold your Country out for donations!  You put Party before Country. Shame on you!
@MollyJongFast Jason is a snowflake.  The Truth burns him and his only reaction is to block!
@JohnCornyn Start with your own damn house.  You have several foxes in the hen house.  Hypocrite!  You have sold your Country out for donors!  Mueller at least has the spine to get rid of the problem.  You are complicit in your behavior and continue to allow it.  Deflect much!  Sell-Out!
@SenatorMenendez You are like the others.  Hypocrite!  Your hands are dirty from this WHOLE mess in Congress.  Resign!
@cathymcmorris Are you going to protect the Special Counsel?  or Are you going to go with the flow and turn a blind eye on everything.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump What are you going to do to protect the Mueller Investigation?  This is Nixon ALL over again.
@HouseGOP You sold the country out for donors.  I'm ashamed to call myself a GOP Voter.  Grow a damn spine and protect Mueller and the investigation
@ChuckGrassley You had my respect until you placed party before country.  You are more than old enough to remember Nixon and Watergate.  You lack the spine to stand up and save the Special Counsel.  Who has been donating to your campaign!  Coward.   COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY!
@SpeakerRyan You are a coward.  You lack a damn spine to stand up for Country. You sold this Country out for donors.  Who's been donating to your campaign! Country before Party you Moron! You are old enough to remember Nixon and Watergate.
@elizabethforma Please fight to keep the others in Congress from attempting fire those in DOJ who can stop Mueller's investigation!
@amandablount2 I know that was some funny shit!  Moore is now on the "I lost because there is voter fraud in the election" bandwagon!  Moore needs to give his speak and ride back to the hole he crawled out of!
@SLSmith000 This highly disgusts me.  Moore is being a little whiny ass baby bitch!
@EdKrassen Who will POTUS fire at DOJ to let this happen?  POTUS can't fire Mueller BUT a DOJ official can.  This is Nixon ALL Over again.
@HouseGOP You are celebrating the Bill of Rights while behind the scenes you are trying to dismantle it!  I'm now an Independent voter because of your platform of Party before Country.  SHAME ON YOU ALL!
@JohnCornyn Coward! You voted Party before Country.  You are doing the bidding of your corporate donors.  You threw the people who elected you out with the bath water.
@MRSSMH2 @JuddLegum If Flynn stops cooperating then Mueller will throw the sink, bus and law library on Flynn.  Flynn will see his  grandson on visitor's day in a federal prison
@IvankaTrump You will make a lot of money from this Tax Bill.  I will suffer from this bill.  I will have to see more money out of my paycheck, higher tax, higher tax bracket and less deductions.  Go back to selling shoes and purses.
@JohnCornyn You put Party before Country you coward!  All this squawking and chest beating is a deflection.  What are you hiding Sir?  Do you have a secret to hide?  Who is on your Campaign Donation list?  Who paid you to look the other way?
@SenatorCollins How much money was your vote worth to betray your constituents!  Country before Party.  You are a coward for not standing up to them.
@SpeakerRyan Coward.  You are selling your country down 5ge river for your damn donors
@PRyan We'll vote you out in 2018!
@marcorubio You sold your soul to the devil for $300!  I'm sorry I voted for you last year!
@jfreewright Oh what fresh hell is going on?
@LindseyGrahamSC I pay into my Social Security Retirement.  You and the others use it to pay for other crap!
@kylegriffin1 Remember that line in Flynn's document.  It may be a little troublesome.
@DrDenaGrayson Didn't Mueller place a clever statement in the agreement that would prevent a pardon?
@JuddLegum Wonder if he knows that if the crap hits the fan he'll be implicated!
@kylegriffin1 Why is he doing that!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your father appointed him.  Get your facts straight!
@MRSSMH2 I'm hearing conflicting messages.  About Mueller handing down an indictment and an attempt to fire Mueller.
@SenWhitehouse @SenJohnKennedy @realDonaldTrump I''m a damn paralegal and have done more than that man testifying!  They want to make him a JUDGE!  Where in the HELL are they finding these unqualified idiots!
@RogueSNRadvisor Will they have the Balls to stand up or tuck their tails between their legs and submit!
@TGowdySC You are placing Party before Country.
@thereaIbanksy What the hell?  Highway robbery if this shit becomes law!  What the hell is the FCC doing!
@aaronlmorrison 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump The people spoke and voted.  The people said no more of this.
@aravosis Probably a lot of stress eating and someone has probably made a run to some greasy spoon place for a snack.
@CREWcrew He's had this problem going back to his days in the military.  To him bigger budget less oversight!
@AltStateDpt @PressSec LOL that is some funny SHIT Sarah!  Oh you just made my day!
@AnnieLinskey @NormEisen LOL....That is some funny stuff coming from Sanders!  No one there has an Ethical bone in their bodies.  They can't get their Financial Disclosure Forms completed correctly!
@TeaPainUSA Freaking Keebler Elf needs to be fired for lying on his SF-86 and to Congress.  Mueller is coming for them all and their lying butts.
@KatrinaPierson @BillClinton @POTUS Investigate and find out the truth.  Stop fighting this battle on twitter.  If POTUS feels he's right then he should welcome the investigation.  He's behaving like a child caught with their hand in the cookie jar!   Grow up and take responsibility for your actions.
@NormEisen @KellyannePolls @waltshaub Let them dig that hole a little deeper for OSC to nail their backsides.
@realDonaldTrump Many will vote Country over Party.  Stop Gas lighting the narrative!
@TeaPainUSA Good God.  We are dealing with our Nixon on STEROIDS!
@MooreSenate Voting Country over Party here.
@realDonaldTrump If you did nothing wrong let the investigation move forward and vindicate you.
@realDonaldTrump Nixon said things very similar to this.  Look what happened to him.  At least he had the courage to resign with dignity than be impeached!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Some of us Alabama voters are placing COUNTRY before PARTY!  He is not what Alabama needs!
RT @funder: Serious question-if you had to choose between the two, who would you let babysit your children? Doug Jones or Roy Moore?		Retwe…
@aravosis Something is wrong with him!  If it were my father he would be in the emergency room ASAP! that is not Dentures that is something else!!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS These people are not qualified to defend my Basset Hound!  They don't deserve to be on the bench!
@KellyannePolls Honey you are a broken record with the nonsense you talk.
@LindseyGrahamSC @kilmeade Lost all respect for you with your behavior.  You put Party before Country!
@TeaPainUSA @CNN There is a pattern with Trump. Report the truth he goes off like a crazy man on crack?  Fake News!  You can trace it to the time and day the news came out with one of his tweets.
@KellyannePolls You do realize your boss bullies people?  Show him this video to show how bad bullying is and affects people.  No child should deal with people this cruel and no adult either.
@LindseyGrahamSC How much did you get in special interest money to turn your back on your country!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @danawhite Show this to your father.  Let him see what bullying does to people.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Stop Gas-Lighting.  Tell the truth.  Stop hiding behind lies.
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump Stop gas-lighting.  You do not help.
@RepMarkMeadows These men and women are in the military.  They will always stand.
@20committee Good God!  What dirt to they have on the Senator.  Mueller need to hurry up and get the cockroaches out!
@ColMorrisDavis Clearly the dear Governor didn't teach his daughter the same thing.  He and his daughter LOVE to lie.
@MooreSenate Country before Party.
@thehill There is a damn reason he was kicked of the damn State Supreme Court for his stupid view.  I am voting Country over Party.
@LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thanks for selling out your own damn party Mr. Graham.
@waltshaub Between Sessions, Kushner and His wife.  They ALL lied on their SF-86.  If us normal Feds did half of what they did, we would be FIRED!
@thehill BULLSHIT!  Oh this makes me made.  That little Keebler Elf looking MF is lying
@RVAwonk I wonder if Kelly had the weekend off.
@realDonaldTrump We don't trample on the First Amendment.  Read the Constitution OR have someone read it to you.
@CREWcrew We the tax payers paid for this dog and pony show.
@CoryBooker I don't want him around under-aged Senate Pages!
@counterchekist I'm placing Country over Party.  Moore is not getting my vote.  I'll vote Jones.
@Evan_McMullin Check out @Bencjacobs post about Moore.
Interesting.  Who paid for this little trip. https://t.co/AdLiEQcdli
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump Which baby-sitter is not with him this weekend?  Inquiring minds would like to know.
@realDonaldTrump Can someone PLEASE take his phone away from him.  He needs a nap!
@JasonMillerinDC Good Grief.
@aliasvaughn I so want to say something.  I'm trying to be nice.
@ALT_uscis @amazon @infowars Why does this man still have a show?  He's an arrogant SOB!
@lauferlaw @LouiseMensch Mueller was very crafty with Flynn's agreement.
@PressSec I remember when the Press Secretaries didn't lie for their boss!
@PressSec I remember a President resigning.  I remember a Vice President resigning.  I remember the Speaker of the House becoming the Vice President then the President!  I remember Watergate.  Why is history starting to repeat itself!
@ballpark_frank @TeaPainUSA Trump can't fire Mueller but he can fire DOJ officials until someone there does his bidding.  Look what happened to Bork when he did Nixon's bidding after many resigned for refusing to fire the SC.  Cost Bork a seat on the Supreme Court decades later.
@ColMorrisDavis @JudgeJeanine She calls herself an Attorney and Judge.  Well, I think he will spread vile lies to the highest bidder!  She has really lost her way!  I would not hire her to defend me against a speeding ticket!
@DonaldJTrumpJr There has to be an attorney out there saying.  Stay off Twitter before you find yourself in more legal hot water!
@MooreSenate Will be voting Country before Party.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why should we trust your word?  You can't even answer questions about your conduct to Congress.  If you did nothing wrong why hide behind a lie?  You are behaving like a guilty person.
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @FBI Fox News you are the problem.  You use to report honestly and fair.  You sold your soul to the devil.  Shame on you ALL
@LouiseMensch @GDouglasJones I am a GOP voter and will be voting Jones.  I will always place Country before Party.  Moore does not represent Alabama.
@PressSec You are so good at lying
@KatrinaPierson @NFL You would show the NFL team with the WORST Record and Attendance to try and prove a point.  The Browns have a losing record and nobody is attending.  Show us the Steelers/Patriots/Cowboys stadiums.
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump You know what is funny.  They people they want to catch are not the ones they catch.  I think the largest number of people on SNAP are in GOP controlled STATES!
@CREWcrew Again enriching his empire.  How much is the Federal Government paying for this adventure!  How much is Secret Service paying Trump properties for their stay.  One has to ask.
@realDonaldTrump Congress is 1) Raising my Taxes, 2) Reducing my Take Home Pay, 3) Limiting my Mortgage Deduction and 4) Moving me to A HIGHER Tax Bracket.  This is only helping the 1% and Corporations.  It's a Scam.
When you really want to make Biscuits and Gravy but it's just too damn cold to leave the house?
@realDonaldTrump Let's see how things are next year for your economy.
@TrueFactsStated Ugh.  I'm hoping we turn the tide and Jones is elected.  Moore is a cancer here in Alabama.
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump By drinking Soymilk it would be healthier than the Diet Coke!
@SenGillibrand Get to investigating All those elected leaders accused of harassment!  Starting with the Man in Charge POTUS.
@PressSec How many jobs are still moving overseas?  How much are the working people losing in take home pay because of reduced hours?  How many are STILL losing their jobs with all the boasting?  Tell us Mrs. Sanders!
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Gaslight much!
@PressSec He is not draining the swamp he is filling it with MORE swamp creatures
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine You are the problem.  Stop gaslighting
@jfreewright I will be voting for Jones.
@amandablount2 I need it warmer my joints are telling me MORE heat less cold!
@realDonaldTrump @daveweigel Well I think the adults are away and not monitoring the Twitter feed.
@KatrinaPierson Still peddling that Yellow Journalism/Gas-Lighting channel.  I remember when they use to run HONEST stories.
Today is a big day in the house.  It is Army Navy Game Day.  We are a Navy family so GO NAVY BEAT ARMY!
@naretevduorp Don't paint me in with those fucktards in that piece.  I do not share their stupid backwoods ideas.  I do not support that idiot Moore.  I'm voting Country over Party Tuesday!
@amandablount2 I will vote based on research.  I am a Republican voter and I CANNOT vote for Moore.  Moore is vile and makes me want to scrub with comet and steel-wool.  Jones I feel will work with both sides of the aisle for the people of Alabama.  I vote Country over Party in a heartbeat!
@funder So the GOP will investigate their own but demand DEMs design.  What you do for one you do for ALL
@RobertRio22 @TheRickWilson @FrankLuntz @VICE There are still people in Alabama who are fighting NOT to Elect Moore.
@yashar We are trying like hell to NOT get him elected.  I know the word is getting out there with calls, door to door canvassing, text messages and emails to vote.  I will give my vote to Jones over Moore.  We do not need someone like Moore in the Senate.
@SteveKingIA Maybe you need to look at your family tree a little closer.  You will find diversity there!
@speechboy71 Remember what happened to Nixon?  He resigned!
@Alt_Spicerlies We are trying everything to NOT Elect Moore here.  This moderate is voting for the other guy Jones.  I will gladly place Country before Party any day of the week.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You need to start being honest in your answers to CONGRESS.  No one is above the law.  You included.
@AynRandPaulRyan There are many in Alabama who do not believe that one stinking bit!  Hey those people in this would consider us folks in North Alabama to be stuck up.  Hum.....We're the ones with advance education and better JOBS!
@20committee The flags were ignored that allowed him to advance that high. There were too many questions people ignored that allowed him to advance that quickly.  Here is a thought he probably should have retired at a lower rank.  It will be 4 years or more to clean up the mess he caused!
@thehill 2.  There are members of Congress who have committed crimes that normal people are fired for.  In Congress they stay.  Stop the double standards.  Remove those people who break the law and stop catering to Corporate America.  You work for the PEOPLE of the USA
@thehill 1.  Both parties need to get their house in order.  There are members who do not need to be in the House or Senate.  They do not need to be around the many pages who come and intern.  They are held to a much higher standard.  They also are not above the law.
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump I am tired of double standards by that him. He has operated without rules and consequences.  He is not above the law. He should be held accountable for his actions. His staffers too! He is another version of Richard M NIXON. At least Nixon did the honorable thing and resigned.
@MooreSenate We need someone who will put Country BEFORE party.  You have show questionable behavior over the last several decades.  You have lost this moderates vote.
@MichaelCohen212 You're an attorney and you are behaving like this?  Unbelievable!
@KatrinaPierson @POTUS @GayleKing @Yamiche You are a pathetic person.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Moore was removed from the Alabama State Supreme Courts TWICE! for his conduct. There are questions about his conduct as a District Attorney. Can he exercise independent and unbiased judgment.  NO he can't.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Where are you about the HUGE mistake Fox news made?  Or do they get a pass.  You are showing that you are not fair in your assessment of the News Channel when they make mistakes.  You are being biased.
@realDonaldTrump I will vote Country over Party in a heart-beat.  I do my research before voting.  I want ALL the information not information from those with an agenda.
@DonaldJTrumpJr If you feel you did nothing wrong answer the questions.  You have been behaving like you were caught with your hand in the cookie jar.
@amandablount2 I think it is sick.  I didn't vote for him and I'm not voting for Moore.  Both make me want to scrub with steel wool and comet!
@TrueFactsStated We are fighting like hell in Alabama to prevent him from becoming the next Senator.  Hoping the latest polls are correct with Jones in the lead!
@CNNPolitics No struggle for this Alabama voter.  Jones will get my vote over Moore.  I'm a Moderate GOP Voter!
@Alyssa_Milano I intend to vote Jones.  I may be a Moderate GOP but I will not let Moore get elected.  Jones has ran a very honorable campaign.
@amandablount2 @GOP We knew this was coming.  Department of Defense as a whole have kept poor records on the funds.
@KellyannePolls @CNN @CNNPR @brianstelter @manuraju @DonaldJTrumpJr I am tired of the gas-lighting and whataboutism from you and others. Shut up let LE and SC do their work. I'm tired of Conservative this, Liberal that.  GOP this, DEM that.  Grow up behave like a damn adult.  Us Moderates are tired of this crap! You are losing our votes you twit!
@KatrinaPierson Will you please stop gaslighting shit.
@waltshaub @SecretaryZinke He had the same issue while on Active Duty with fudging his Travel Vouchers.  Seems he has lapsed back into his old ways.  Makes me sick that he has had ethics training in the Navy and turned his back to it.  Shame on Secretary Zinke.
@realDonaldTrump I will vote COUNTRY before Party.
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is why victims do not come forward the attacks.  Investigate and let the COURTS decide.
@DearAuntCrabby Hey Don't throw me in with those idiots who like Moore!  This person is placing Country before Party.  I am from Alabama who thinks Moore belongs in jail!
@ananavarro I'm not voting for Moore.  I'll vote Jones.  Moore is not what Congress needs
@KatrinaPierson You are fueling this crap!
@PressSec @POTUS Just in time to screw us over Christmas.  How about passing a damn budget.  We are tired of being pawns in the hate of the federal workforce!
@AngrierWHStaff Uh no!  Are we going to have a Perp walk again?
@20committee Good now to go for the fat man in the WH!
@SenateMajLdr When are you going to deal with the problem children in the GOP!  You hypocrite.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hypocrite.
@kenvogel I'm sorry Manafort has been charged with some serious crimes.  Not going to happen
@WestWingReport This shit is getting old!
@CNNPolitics I would like a clear CR.  I would like to go to work on Monday all day instead of signing a goddamn furlough letter.  You are messing with my job!
@WestWingReport As long as the President's Physical is done at Walter Reed and not by that idiot he's had.
@TrueFactsStated He hasn't submitted to a medical exam with Walter Reed so we don't know the full extent of his "Health"  That quack he has in NYC says he's extremely healthy.
@Alt_Spicerlies Oh no....did they "Shadow Ban" you?
@ChuckGrassley I have long respected you.  You have truly show us you are Party before Country.
@ericgarland What is WRONG with these people!  They will get caught in a lie.  Did he not learn from the FUBAR in Iraq!  Clearly, Prince didn't.  He's a paid mercenary looking to line his pockets or agenda.
@KellyannePolls @ChrisCuomo @SenFranken Keeping digging that hole for Office of Special Counsel for that Hatch Act Violation. You never learn.  You are subject to the Hatch Act like the others in the Federal Government.
@KellyannePolls @ChrisCuomo @SenFranken Well.  Nice of you to exercise a double standard!  Call for Franken but support someone like Moore who will have access to underage female pages!  HYPOCRITE
@ChuckGrassley Do shut up Chuck.  You threw the American People under the bus for Corporate American and the top 1% wealthy.  Where is your damn Transparency?
@SenatorHeitkamp Zero Tolerance works BOTH Ways Madame Senator when it comes to this topic!  Are you going to hold your fellow GOPers who are also accused of the same thing to the same standard?  Or are you again going to put Party before Country?  Stop being a damn hypocrite!
@Alt_Spicerlies @EdWGillespie @BarackObama @RalphNortham How in the hell is that correct?  Are they charging by the MILE!  That is the flex lanes correct @Alt_Spicerlies
@krassenstein I will be voting Jones.  I'll vote country over party in a heartbeat!
@naretevduorp This is a slippery slope we are on.  Scares the crap out of me.
@DearAuntCrabby Is KAC for real?  God she has no soul.
@naretevduorp @KellyannePolls Considering the Office of Special Counsel is investigating her for Hatch Act violation.  She keeps digging that hole.  She is bound by the law and thinks she is above them.  Have fun sitting down and talking to them @KellyannePolls !
@amandablount2 I don't trust Prince.  He is the reason behind the HUGE Eye-sore his company caused overseas.  He and North are dangerous!
@AltUSPressSec Sleep escapes me here.
@RVAwonk I hope the hell NOT!
@tedlieu Everything.  Did he not learn when his company screwed up before
@jfreewright It’s colder than hell in Alabama since Evil Bannon stepped foot in the state.
@WestWingReport The temp dropped her in Alabama when his evil ass landed.  Struggling to stay warm!
@DrDenaGrayson Gates and Pauline getting orange jumpsuits?  Good!
@SenTomCotton Sell-out sold your soul to corporate America.  Threw the people under the bus.  You coward.
@DearAuntCrabby @chrislhayes He made the temps drop to the low 40’s with this arrival.  Makes you want to scrub with steel wool and comet to get the bad omens off you?
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics I wondered why the temperature suddenly dropped.  Bannon arrived!
@whnt @MooreSenate Is he the reason the temperature suddenly dropped!
@JesseFFerguson Oh that would be AWESOME!  I bet he would be sweating and then spill the beans on EVERYONE!
@funder @realDonaldTrump Just wait.  someone will slip him his phone.   Mean while in Alabama Bannon is here and the temperature DROPPED 15 degrees or more with his arrival.  Hell must be freezing over.
So the news is saying Bannon is in Alabama stumping for Moore.  I was wondering why the temperature dropped about 15 to 20 degrees from this morning!  Could it be because he's here and hell is freezing over?
@radiochick841 Swamp Water
@PalmerReport There goes his possible Naval Reserve career.  Hope it was worth it Spicer!
@AltNatSecAgency @BetsyDeVosED Prince should be rotting away in some damn HELL!  I Think he is a very, very evil man.
@funder I had a stupid Robo Call about that damn rally on my office phone!  Deleted it clogged up my voice mail.
@AngrierWHStaff She was still married to a man who was sent to prison and it is only recently she became divorced.  She is such a Hypocrite!
@realDonaldTrump Stop Robo Calling my office phone number!  You filled up my voice mail your idiots!
@SpeakerRyan Snake Oil Salesman you are.
@JuddLegum What's next.  interracial Couple denied services because it is against an owners religion.  Slippery Slope.  Before long no one is welcomed in those businesses and they go out of business.
@Alt_Spicerlies @realDonaldTrump Looks like he just tweeted about 10 minutes or so.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You are an idiot.  Sold yourself to the Corporate Devil to get a win at all cost.  Deal with the Damn Orange Elephant in the room.  You Impeached a sitting President for FAR Less!
@ColMorrisDavis @GovernorVA I was just up there almost two years ago.  When did they start that crap?  I-66 REALLY!  How many Federal workers live on the interstate!  Sounds like Highway robbery
@realDonaldTrump Stop.
@TeaPainUSA He needs a cell with an orange jumpsuit!
@JamesFourM @LouiseMensch @counterchekist @ericgarland @20committee @911CORLEBRA777 @ninaandtito @LincolnsBible @xtrixcyclex @TrueFactsStated @TrumpPrisonDate @Grzabjj @kittenninja42 @mtylr23 Why is Roger Stone still running around like the village idiot.  He needs to be locked up somewhere.
@lauferlaw @TheRickWilson Did Paulie and Company hire Saul Goodman to represent them?  I think they need a refund.  I think Paulie may have a new wardrobe if the judge denies the bail.  I'm thinking Orange jumpsuit in solitary for his protection!
@chrislhayes What is wrong with these people?  Did Roger Stone like give the WH Nixon's  black book of paid thugs for hire?  I don't get it!
@RVAwonk @politico Can DC Keep that Keebler Elf Sessions.  We don't want him in Alabama.
@thehill Took him long enough to respond AFTER the Former FBI Director and Former AG Took the time to stand up to the Twitter Bully.
@kylegriffin1 Sessions will respond, "I don't remember that."  He can stay in DC, we don't want him in Alabama.
@SpeakerRyan How does it feel to be the biggest sell-out on the planet!  You sold out the American people for your donors and Corporate America.  Midterms will bring a new majority to the House and Senate.  You are a coward and liar.
@GOPLeader @POTUS Less take home pay and higher taxes.  Idiot!
@ColMorrisDavis @JasonIsbell I came to work and had a Damn voicemail robo call on my work phone.  MY WORK PHONE!  How the hell did they get it and my voice mail message tells you what I do and who I work for!  Robo call about that damn rally in FL by POTUS!
@RepTedLieu @realDonaldTrump He and his minions are doing all this in plain sight.  Many of us see this. They are not even attempting to hide it.  Ryan and Company are hiding in their damn turtle shells.  This administration will not save them.  He'll save family FIRST and everyone else will burn!
@CREWcrew I'm thinking one of two people.  Jared or Pence!
@Pfro I'm finding it hard to believe Carson is a doctor.  He behaves like the village idiot. '
@SenTedCruz @POTUS You are truly and idiot.
@JoyAnnReid Who in the Hell is giving the legal advice?  Must be the many village idiots running around the WH.  Sure as hell isn't McGann.
@Alt_Spicerlies Revoke is damn house arrest and GPS bracelet.  Let him sit in Federal Lock up!
@thehill Paulies Walnuts are going to be crushed!  LOL
@SenateMajLdr @FaceTheNation Good Grief are you that draft and stupid?  By giving corporate a cut you won't spur spending.  Customer demands drives economic growth.
@jaketapper She didn't learn from her boss.  There is a Tweet for Everything!
@MarchForTruth17 Yeah Nixon tried that argument.  Didn't end well for him.
@newtgingrich He admitted his guilt. He accepted responsibility for his action.  Get over it.
@kylegriffin1 Flynn ruined his own life.  No one else did that.  This is ALL Flynn's doing.
@FoxFriendsFirst @KatrinaPierson They must be really scraping the bottom of the barrel
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends So you get your legal advice from Fox news now?
@FoxNews @AlanDersh @foxandfriends What is wrong with these "Experts" they forgot how to practice LAW!
@KevinMKruse Oh how they forget history!
@kylegriffin1 Yeah Nixon tried that line.  Guess what happened to him.  He resigned.  Keep circling the wagons Dowd!
@MarchForTruth17 @mikeallen Ask Nixon about that.
@realDonaldTrump Wow.  I mean wow.
@DearAuntCrabby Obama has more REAL Followers than Trump!
@thehill Ew.....That is gross.
@TeaPainUSA Interesting. Who will do the "Walk of Shame" to the Courthouse next!
@funder It's probably because Mueller has them already.
@ChicaPeligrosa @FlacaSegals @LoolooMagdalena @slhamlet @LAWeekly @Passionweiss @Klickedy @ChiefCovfefe @LouiseMensch @TrippyBroad @lenoraclaire This is one person from Alabama who is GOP who will NOT be voting for Moore.  He is NOT what Alabama needs.  I'll vote Jones or write in Luther Strange.
@mattdizwhitlock @JoeNBC @StevenTDennis People are mad because he lied to the people with this sham of a tax bill.  He only cares about his donors.  Why hasn't CHP been renewed?  Tell the truth.
This is sad but funny. https://t.co/Uey5o4QUmf
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump @FBI If it's like his taped depositions it will be a train-wreck!
@Slate Show Horse?  Hope she's not that.  She's a stooge and liar.
@John_Hudson What is wrong with JARED!  They will find this crap out.  Disclose the crap!
@TeaPainUSA Jared can get the inside scoop for his father. I wonder if Kremlin Barbie will be swept up in this.  Will Daddy save his Princess or sell her down the river with her Beavis and Butthead Brothers.
@AynRandPaulRyan Why is he still running around trying to be the savior of the world!  He's been lying since he got in the job.  First on his SF-86 and then his financial disclosures.  If I lied on either of those forms, I would be FIRED!  He needs to go.  I hope Mueller nails his ass to the wall
@20committee He came unglued when "coffee boy" plead guilty, Manafort and Gates were indicted and arrested.  For a man who says he's innocent he keeps sticking his foot in his mouth each time.  Let POTUS dig that hole deeper for Mueller to bury him!
@SenTomCotton @SenateMajLdr Coward!  Sold yourself to your donors and corporate donors.
@sendavidperdue What about those of us who have no children due to the fact the are grown. Means you are taxes the crap out of us!
@thedailybeast Jared will end up in the same Club Fed his daddy spent time in and will probably have familiar company as in Manafort, Gates and Maybe Flynn with the Army doesn't get their hooks in Flynn first.
@tedlieu @POTUS Where is the adult in this administration.  Seems the Man-Child is running the show.
@Lawrence Comey is telling the truth and backed it up with sworn testimony.
@sendavidperdue @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews @SundayFutures Have you finished reading all 400 plus pages?  I bet you don't know what is in it.	Here is a link to it.  Happy Reading.	https://t.co/cOj0rqkMZo
@911CORLEBRA777 @TeaPainUSA I'm wondering if Ivanka will be dangled over POTUS to leave.  Hum, wonder what Flynn and the others have talked about in their Mueller meetings.  I'm sure the juicy details are coming soon.
@TeaPainUSA I'm old enough to remember "I'm not a Crook!"  History seems to be repeating itself.
@IvankaTrump @SenateMajLdr @senorrinhatch @SenateGOP Have you read the 400 plus pages?  I bet not.  This is bad for the middle class.  Why should I pay for your tax cuts! Many of us do not benefit from the child tax credit because our children are ADULTS!  The only thing left Mortgage Interest and that is being limited.
@fawfulfan The amount I pay in payroll taxes are crazy.
@SenateMajLdr @ThisWeekABC @FaceTheNation Have you read all 400 plus pages of this lobbyist written bill!
@marcorubio Moron!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @ABC Good god now you?
@TheRynheart @PattyArquette @realDonaldTrump Is Shepard Smith the only honest person at Fox?
@realDonaldTrump You’re mad because your FBI Director will not do your bidding.  Read the constitution again.
@EdKrassen His FBI director is installed and His AG.  This is all on POTUS
@thehill It’s called Conspiracy and  Obstruction  morons!  His lawyers are dumbasses
@nytmike His new FBI Director is in charge and doing oh wait HIS JOB not the bidding of POTUS.
@kylegriffin1 No Dowd is probably shaking his head I'm f**ed big time.
@KremlinTrolls @realDonaldTrump I left a link to the Constitution and Bill of Rights in case POTUS forgot his US Government 101 lessons.
@realDonaldTrump @ABC Read the Constitution please.  Here's the link!	https://t.co/3l6FYdqEAD	Oh here's the link to the Bill of Rights also!	https://t.co/Qk8cmdfpJ1
@realDonaldTrump This is a pattern.  Stop it.
@chucktodd @VP @Reince They knew they will do the walk of shame into the courthouse like Flynn, Manafort and Gates.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Give it a break.  Why are you so obsessed with her?  WHY!  This crap has been investigated and investigated.  Stop going after political opponents!
@JoeNBC @senorrinhatch @senorrinhatch These are disabled CHILDREN!  CHILDREN!  I use to respect you but that statement makes you sound so uncaring and spiteful. Shame on you!  2018 Elections are coming and I hope they vote you out of office.
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hypocritical much?
@SenatorCollins @nbc @MeetThePress @chucktodd Talking about how you turned your back on the people you represent? How you put your donors before the people?  How you are throwing people off the healthcare insurance?  Cutting entitlements and raising taxes.  Shame on you!
@ColMorrisDavis @MooreSenate Moore was removed from the Alabama State Supreme Court TWICE, thinks it's okay to date 14 year old girls.  This voter in Alabama is not voting for him.  I'll Vote Jones or write in Luther Strange.  Moore makes me what to scrub my skin with a BRILLO PAD!
@EdKrassen Watergate was amateur breaking and entering.  This is on a whole new level Watergate!
@ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump Does POTUS wake up to find someone has ALREADY pissed in his Cheerios? Someone PLEASE thrown his phone into the Potomac River!
@TrickFreee @DevinNunes Nunes is a rat, mole, stooge for the WH. He immediately ran to the WH and spilled the beans.  Others were fired for helping him but he comes out smelling like a rose.  He needs to do the walk of shame like Manafort and the others.  He is part of the problem
@marcorubio Did you actually read the 400 plus pages.  I have it on my computer and I'm going to read it.  You are a sad, sad man.  Would you blindly vote for somethings you didn't read.  Would you sign a contract without reading it?  Again MORON!
@marcorubio What about those of use who are not in that bracket?  How much will MY taxes be raised to pay for the 1% and Corporate American.  You are lying.
@marcorubio You rammed through a Bill that SHOULD have been read.  You had lobbyist and others who had no business  there writing this.  2018 Midterms will usher you out of the majority.  You are pleased your donors NOT the American people.
@realDonaldTrump You really are going down that Rabbit Hole!  Stay off twitter probably like your legal counsel told you!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Flynn ruined his own life when he decided to lie to investigators.  He  accepted the punishment for that.  We do not go after political rivals.  If you feel you did nothing wrong.  Let the investigation continue and present its final report.
@EricTrump @BrianRoss @ABC Give it a break.  You are not helping things.
RT @funder: .@SpeakerRyan-Multiple folks from the Hill tell me Trump plans on firing Mueller. Everyone who retweets this wants you to get o…
@aliasvaughn Great work @aliasvaughn.  That was fantastic.
@benjaminwittes What counsel?  He has the village idiot and his identical twin as co-counsel.  REAL attorneys would have told him if you want to stay out of prison.  Shut up and stay off twitter.  We will released the statements.  They need to grow some balls and be real attorneys.
@waltshaub I don't know what is going on with his counsel. The ones I work for would have to told him no public statements.  All statements will be cleared by counsel. Don't talk. Shut up so we can work on a plan. No his ego gets the best of him. All those tweets will be potential evidence
@JenniferJJacobs @kristinegWP Didn't Nixon's attorney go to Camp Fed for his involvement?  Is this going to happen to Trump's band of merry Attorneys?  Open mouth insert foot to the hip Mr. President.
@GOP Did you hear you rammed a flawed bill down the throats of the Senate without being allowed to read it.  Midterms are coming and you'll be voted out.
@McCormackJohn The impeached Clinton for lying about having a BJ in the Oval Office.  This hornets nest is worse than Clinton and Worse then Nixon!
@MooreSenate Think I will vote for Luther Strange by Write-in.  At least he's honest!
@senorrinhatch Did you read ALL 400 plus pages or just blindly voted?  Prove all this with the CBO analysis, JTC analysis and Treasury analysis.  OH I forgot.  You rushed this through BEFORE you had all the analysis!  You STILL have to reconcile this with the House Version.  Stop lying
@PalmerReport Flynn was FIRED by the last administration!  The last administration warned him about Flynn, Acting AG Yates also warned him about Flynn.  He hired him knowing Flynn lied and was doing the bidding of the transition team AND then President Elect!
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump Wow.  Just give Mueller the hammer to nail the coffin shut!  WOW!  Who the HELL is advising him?  A first year law school student?
@SenJohnMcCain @BrookingsInst I felt you would vote No on this bill but you threw the middle class under the bus with your "Yes" vote.  NOW middle class will pay for these cuts with lower take home pay and higher taxes.
@SheriffClarke Is there a full moon out because there are all kinds of crazies patrolling!
@newtgingrich @AndrewCMcCarthy Good Grief you sound like a broken record.  Just stop.
@HardballChris Do you think Cohen or the other WH counsel will flip soon?  This is getting good.
@funder Did he just give Mueller the final Nail AND Hammer for the coffin?  Well this will be interesting.
@realDonaldTrump Stop lying.  GOD!  your nose has to be to Florida with the lies.
@sdmarcyg @mikefarb1 We all are fucked.  We can only hope there is evidence of Pence and Ryan with their hands in the Russian cookie jar.
@MRSSMH2 WOW...What did i just read from that person?  How do you keep your sanity Mrs. SMH? https://t.co/XBIuyMt7Zp
@MattHelms There is a tweet for everything!
@RogueSNRadvisor But he's the best fit president EVER to be elected!  We know he's lives off Junk Food and soda!
@brianbeutler How is Gorka considered an "Expert"
Just a little reminder for 2018 https://t.co/ZydkiltBs2
@RepMarkMeadows Aren't you up for reelection in November 2018?  I wonder if the people will vote you out for this betrayal to them.  This increases middle class taxes to pay for the 1% and Corporate cuts.
@abbydphillip It will show there was a HUGE Conspiracy going on.  Now it is every rat for themselves to see who can get a sweet deal from Mueller.
@WestWingReport Lord.  POTUS doesn't want to understand how serious this is.  Mueller has the information needed for the investigation.  Mueller is gaining speed to hook the mother of all fishes in this investigation.
@FoxNews @CharlesHurt There is probably more information that has not been released that is more damaging to others involved.  If Flynn stops cooperating then the deal is off and he's getting the book thrown at him and facing serious time in prison.  He lied about why he was contacting those idiots.
@KatrinaPierson Go away.
@SenatorLeahy @SenateGOP Congress I have lost faith in your ability to do the people’s work.  Are you working for the people or special interest? Are you working for the wealthy 1% or the working people. This was a massive betrayal. Midterm elections are coming. How many of Congress will keep their seat.
@PressSec You are really a moron.  You know that.  This is the greatest scam on the planet.
@Acosta He was warned by several officials.  DO NOT HIRE HIM!  He was fired from DIA for his questionable behavior but POTUS STILL hired him.  No this crap is squarely on #45 and his staff.  Own that mistake.
