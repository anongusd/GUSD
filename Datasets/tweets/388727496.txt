Donald Trump's inclination to opt for using DRONE in the US-Mexico border instead of erecting 30 feet high concrete wall or steel wall is an wise idea. It may be useful for India too, especially in Jammu &amp; Kashmir or Bangladesh or at other international borders.
It is a very sad news for all of us. I salute all the CRPF jawans who have died in the explosion in J&amp;K today. 	Now, the Govt. of India should make an effort to bring lasting peace without any loss of life whether security forces or civilians through the diplomatic dealings.
CAB will not be passed this time! What are the strategies for it?

The All Assam S.S.B. Volunteers' Association is grateful to the PMO for taking up the issues of the SSB volunteers of Assam for solution and directing the MHA for its immediate follow up action.
Happy International Mother Earth Day.
Therefore, the AASSBVA requested the PM to sanction one-Time Financial Assistance to the families of each SSB volunteers of Assam and solve the other demands of the AASSBVA to enable them to continue their patriotic services in a better way.
But regrettably, after this change, the minimum facilities provided to these volunteers had also been stopped.	Many volunteers have already died and many have attained their old age. Those who are still alive, many of them are also living in pathetic conditions.
But after the change of role from *Special Security Bureau" “Stay behind role” to ‘Sashastra Seema Bal’ as “Border Guarding Force”, it has come under the Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi since 2001.
Since then, the SSB volunteers have been engaging themselves in the patriotic works and playing a vital role in the field. 	From 1963 to 2000 A.D., the SSB was looked after by the Cabinet Secretary (PMO), New Delhi.
These trained cadres came back to respective places and tens of thousands of young boys &amp; girls were imparted guerrilla trainings. Besides, they were used for spreading the message of patriotism and for upliftment of the spirit of patriotism.
It was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India at Haflong of N.C. Hills (present Dima Hasao) district of Assam on November 19, 1963. The training was first imparted by the Odissa and Madhya Pradesh Police (OMP) batch by batch.
... of the international border areas to defend our Motherland from Chinese aggression. With this great objective of “Stay behind Role”, the *Special Security Bureau (SSB) was raised for imparting training to the volunteers from civil society.
The AASSBVA stated the facts to the PM that, during the Indo-China War in 1962, when the Indian forces were defeated at the hands of the Chinese army, the Government of India seriously felt the need for a third line force involving volunteers from the civil society of ........
4. Demand to include all the names of genuine SSB volunteers of Assam in the List of 'Physical Verification'.	5. Revival of schemes for the welfare of the families of SSB volunteers;	6. One-Time Financial Grants to the families of S.S.B. Volunteers of Assam; and others.
Their demands include: 1. Pension for the families of S.S.B. Volunteers of Assam; 2. Appointment of SSB Volunteers &amp; their Kin in Military, Para-Military, Security Forces or in other Job; 3. Providing Identity Cards to SSB volunteers of Assam;
It is worth mentioning that, the AASSBVA has been demanding for solution of their issues since long years back.
Demand of SSB volunteers of Assam is likely to get resolved shortly. Being the Chief Adviser of All Assam SSB Volunteers’ Association, I had a discussion with officers of PMO, New Delhi on the issues today.The Central Government is in a mood to solve the issues of SSB volunteers.

Representatives have expressed their satisfaction over the attitude shown to them by the Governor and hoping that the Governor will take appropriate actions on the various issues basing on the reports which he has received today at Udalguri.
After hearing the view points and receiving the memorandum of various organisations, the Governor has left Udalguri for Mangaldoi in the evening today.
8. B.Ed. College &amp; Engineering College:	9. Support to Government for the War against Corruptions, Black Money etc.; 	10. Expediting of Peace Talks with Struggling Groups.
2.Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is Yet to Arrive at Udalguri;	3.Development of Roads and Communications;	4.Slow Progress of on-going Constructions;	5.Development of Education and Provincialization of Venture Schools, Colleges;	6.Completion of Dhansiri Major Irrigation Project;
During discussions with the representatives of various organisations, most of the organisations highlighted and submitted their memorandums on the following points:-	1.Stoppage of RAJDHANI EXPRESS at Udalguri Railway Station;
Then, he met representatives of various organisations, leaders from Christian Coordination Committee of Udalguri District, Biswa Hindu Parishad, Bathou, Shankari, Bodo Sahitya Sabha, Santali Sahitya Sabha, Gorkha Sanmelan, AAGSU, sports associations, media persons etc.
Prof. Jagdish Mukhi, the Governor of Assam paid a maiden visit to Udalguri district today. After attending a public meeting organised by Arya Samaj, Udalguri, he visited 200 Civil Hospital etc., discussed with departmental officers including security personnel.
Govt. has also social obligation, so considering it, the policy of the govt. should have covered those colleges through provincialisation. There is still time (few days), if the govt.....
But, what about the colleges which were established long years back on the call of local populace and have had been running pillar to post for provincialisation of their institutions?
(2) It is a good step that, the Govt. of Assam has proposed to establish several new Law Colleges, B.Ed. Colleges etc. Well, it might be an attempt to pull up the prevailing static and monotonous state of minds of the people of those areas from the present level.......
This year again, he has announced that, a Medical College will be established at Kokrajhar and an Engineering College will be established at Udalguri. We welcome the announcements. 	Let us wait &amp; see what the concerned minister and local representatives and BTC do this time!
In the Budget Session of 2017-18 (last year), the same minister announced that a B.Ed. College will be established at Udalguri.
Prior to that, in 2006 (just before the Assembly Elections), there were announcements made by the then Education Minister or present Education Minister that a Medical College will be established at Kokrajhar and an Engineering College will be established at Udalguri.
(1)Engineering College in Udalguri and Medical College in Kokrajhar:	In 2011, there was a programme for laying foundation of an Engineering College for Udalguri and a Medical College for Kokrajhar simultaneously in front of BTC Secretariat at Bodofa Nwgwr (Kodomtola), Kokrajhar.
....Nevertheless, though this budget proposal is targeting towards the 2019 General Elections, the proposal for granting compensation to the injured persons of the AASU movement and martyrs of Bodoland movement of ABSU etc. and others could be welcomed.
....Therefore, it is an appeal that, the budget proposal placed today should be reviewed and besides others, all the issues mentioned above should be included.	Nevertheless, ....
...(6) There is no proposal to provide compensation to the injured persons /persons whose properties were damaged during Bodoland movement; 	(7) There is no mention of policy decision for solution of the burning issues of the state as well as other important issues....
...(5) Though the Central Govt. has directed the state govt. to take appropriate action for solving the long standing demands/problems of the erstwhile Special Security Bureau (S.S.B.) volunteers, there is no proposal to solve the problems of S.S.B. volunteers in this Budget...
...(4) The Budget did not reflect the policy to solve the unemployment problem of youths of the state (In 2016 General Elections of Assam, they promised to solve unemployment problem of 25 Lac unemployed youths of the state within 5 years if they come to power).....
(2) The fund allocation to BTC should have been more and on the basis of ratio of population; 	(3) Industrial Policy: There is no clear cut mention for employment generation through the industrial development as it has repeatedly been announced by the minister.....
Unfortunate Budget: The Budget proposal placed by Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Finance Minister of Assam for 2018-19 today can be termed as unfortunate one. In the budget, there should have been proposal for- 	(1) Provincialisation of venture schools (educational institutions). ....

Dr. Ngwedia Paul Msiza, President of Baptist World Alliance, who supposed to attend the celebration of 150 years of Christianity among Garo Baptists at North Garo Hills of Meghalaya (India) was denied visa by the Indian Embassy in Johannesburg (South Africa). Very sad news. https://t.co/KqGjTLfKMy
The Ministry of External Affairs has committed a damnable act. 	Dr. N. P. Msiza, the head of the Baptist World Alliance, was supposed to attend the on going celebration of 150 years of Christianity among Garo Baptists at Rajasimla in North Garo Hills of Meghalaya from 7-11 Feb.
The act of rejection of visa to Dr. Ngwedia Paul Msiza, President of Baptist World Alliance (BWA) by the Indian Ambassy in Johannesburg (South Afirca) has unearthed a step motherly treatment to the leaders of Baptist World Alliance. It has disappointed us all.
Baneswar Basumati's demise is a great loss for the Bodo community in particular and the society as a whole.                                                                         Let his soul rest in peace and may the Almighty God bless upon his bereaved family.
He also served as President of Bodo Writers Academy from 1987 to 1993 as well as General Secretary of All Bathou Religious Union (ABRU) from 1992 to 1996. By profession, he was a teacher at Khokhlabari High School ( now H.S. School) since 1970.
Baneswar Basumatary matriculated from Jalahaghat High School in 1962 and passed B.A. from Cotton College in 1968. He became first President of ABSU on 15 February in 1968. He served as General Secretary of Bodo Sahitya Sabha during the Roman Script Movement in 1974.
Huge tribute to Baneswar Basumatary, who died today after his prolonged illness.	        He was the 1st President of All Bodo Students' Union (ABSU). He was born on 1st November, 1945 at Khokhlabari village of Bagsa district of BTAD (Assam).
Wishing you a Happy &amp; Blessed Sunday.

Under no reason, Christians be suppressed directly or indirectly by observing a day on its sacred day, like 'Good Friday', they expressed.
Earlier also the 25th December (Christmas Day) had been observed as Good Governance Day. Christians have helped NDA in coming to power.
Good Friday is a sacred day of the Christian people. The decision has been considered as an insult to Christians again.
The decision of the NDA Govt. to observe Digital India Day on 14 April coinciding with the 'Good Friday' has not gone in a right way.
Best wishes to you on the occasion of Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
