@taborbrown i hate using a cpap, got a new mask today, hopefully it works better
@taborbrown yeah they're tempting, but I'll buy online from a reliable store
@BMer916 obviously you have no idea what a cpap is, google it
any of my tweeps use a CPAP?
@taborbrown i'd rather pay more then use that horrible company again
@taborbrown i am not thru merchconn. they are the worst, still waiting on my poster from last year. probably buy thru amz or something
@taborbrown so did I, I wonder if they changed it or I just heard wrong
