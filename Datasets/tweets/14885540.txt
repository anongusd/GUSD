@OUSDNews Are charter schools affected?		No, Oakland charter schools are not part of the strike, nor are the teachers who work for them or the nearly 14,000 students who attend them.
@OUSDNews Where can kids eat who don't attend school?		- Free lunches and snacks will be available at Taylor Memorial United Methodist Church.		- The teachers' union is also setting up food distribution points around the city for kids who need access to lunch and snacks during the day.
and more ...		- Some @OUSDNews parents plan to host groups of students at their houses, while other parents intend to bring their children to the picket line.		- Grand Lake Theater will charge $1 admission to two special film screenings on Thursday.
@OUSDNews Where can I take my kids if I don‚Äôt want them to go to school?		- The city has designated 15 recreation centers where students can go in lieu of school.	- Oakland‚Äôs public libraries will also be open during regular hours.
How many kids will be affected, and will schools be open?		@OUSDNews has 36,300 students. The district says all schools will remain open, though it expects classes will be quite large and will likely not follow regular curriculum.
How many teachers are going on strike?	The Oakland Education Association, which called the strike, represents about 2,300 classroom teachers and hundreds more school staff, like nurses. Everyone in the union can choose to strike, although they don't have to.

@PGE4Me The story: https://t.co/6PzfwdVxJC
@PGE4Me 5. Most experts agree that it's likely that electricity rates will go up. Ratepayers are still paying off the bond from the last time @PGE4Me went bankrupt.
@PGE4Me 4. There's an order to who gets paid after a company goes bankrupt: big banks, secured creditors and then unsecured creditors, like fire victims. Even if fire victims win their cases against @PGE4Me, it's unclear if the utility could pay them.
@PGE4Me 3. PG&amp;E is doing this because it doesn't have access to credit. And @PGE4Me says it needs credit because it could have to pay out tens of billions of dollars to victims of the devastating wildfires of 2017 and 2018.
@PGE4Me 2. There are potentially 3 big winners here: @PGE4Me, big banks and lawyers. PG&amp;E emerged from its previous bankruptcy as a profitable business with one of the highest rate of returns for a utility nationwide.
5 things to know about the @PGE4Me bankruptcy: 		1. üí°The lights will stay on. You may recall the blackouts and brownouts of the 2001 energy crisis. This bankruptcy is different. @PGE4Me has access to the electricity it needs and customers shouldn't experience reduced service.

@PGE4Me Even before the filing, @PGE4Me started skipping some payments to fire victims who reached settlements with the company in the 2015 Butte County blaze.
@PGE4Me While service to the 16 million people in @PGE4Me's territory will not be interrupted, the bankruptcy filing raises questions ‚Äî for ratepayers who could end up paying more, for the wildfire victims who have sued the utility and for the company‚Äôs creditors and shareholders.
@PGE4Me Lawmakers did agree to soften the blow of those 2017 fires by creating a process for the utility to issue ratepayer-backed bonds to pay for costs related to the fires. Less than two months after Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill, the Camp Fire broke out in Butte County.
@PGE4Me .@PGE4Me stock plummeted after a series of 2017 wildfires that swept through Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties. The utility had been warning for a year that it could face bankruptcy if the state didn‚Äôt give it some relief.
@PGE4Me ‚ÄúGiven its track record of obfuscation and mismanagement, I‚Äôm not surprised @PGE4Me claims it can no longer meet its financial obligations,‚Äù he said in a written statement.
@PGE4Me Napa State Sen. Bill Dodd, who took the lead last year in negotiating a state response to wildfires, said the company needs new leadership.
@PGE4Me The bulk of that feared debt could come in the form of damage awards and settlements with the 6,000-plus plaintiffs who have filed suit against the company so far after the two seasons of fires.
@PGE4Me When @PGE4Me announced its intention to file bankruptcy on Jan. 14, the state's biggest utility said two years of horrendously costly wildfires had created such a massive potential debt that it needs a bankruptcy court to help restructure the company for its future viability.
@PGE4Me In a written statement, interim .@PGE4Me CEO John Simon said the company will continue to focus on wildfire safety, adding that leaders there have "heard the calls for change" and are committed to emerging from bankruptcy with an "energy system our customers want and deserve."
@PGE4Me As part of the filing, @PGE4Me is asking the court to approve $5.5 billion in financing from nine major banks that will allow the company to keep paying its bills.
@PGE4Me Despite that solvency, @PGE4Me officials argued that they need the Chapter 11 protections because they are unable to borrow enough cash to cover operating costs.
@PGE4Me In a simple voluntary petition filed just after midnight Tuesday morning with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, @PGE4Me estimated its liabilities at about $51 billion and its assets at more than $71 billion.
THREAD: @PGE4Me on Tuesday filed for Chapter 11 #bankruptcy  protection, a move the company insists is necessary to contend with at least $30 billion in potential liabilities growing out of the calamitous #wildfire seasons of 2017 and 2018.

At the end of his comments, @realDonaldTrump threatened to shut the government down again if a border wall deal isn't reached by Feb. 15. Story via @NPR		https://t.co/8h8sjck0E8
@realDonaldTrump But Democrats said they should reopen the government and then resume talks, which is essentially what this reported deal would do. 		Follow updates from @NPR here: https://t.co/8h8sjck0E8
@realDonaldTrump Trump and Republicans have long maintained any deal to end the shutdown must include funding for the border wall the president wants, which was his key promise during the 2016 campaign.
@realDonaldTrump The prolonged stalemate has pushed the nation's security and infrastructure to the brink, with significant flight delays at major airports due to FAA and TSA absences escalating on Friday.
@realDonaldTrump Federal employees who have been working without pay or are furloughed would also get back pay as part of the agreement. The Senate would vote first on the agreement, and Trump said he has instructed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put it on the floor immediately.
@realDonaldTrump But the three-week spending bill would would also include a deal to move forward on the longer-term Department of Homeland Security funding bill without any wall money, the source said.
@realDonaldTrump The proposal backed by congressional leaders would fund the government through a Feb. 15. The deal does not right now include funding for the wall along the Mexican border President Trump has pushed for, a House Democratic source says.
@realDonaldTrump "I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government," Trump said in the White House Rose Garden.

@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me Check back here for updates: https://t.co/QD8xSE6TUk
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me Those possible liabilities stem from other fires that started in October 2017 and from last November's Camp Fire in Butte County, which killed 86 people and destroyed nearly 14,000 homes in and around the community of Paradise.
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me In regulatory filings, PG&amp;E has said it did not believe it would be held legally liable for the Tubbs blaze. Earlier this month, the utility announced it plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because it faces at least $30 billion in potential liabilities.
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me PG&amp;E's filing said that a caretaker on the property had undertaken a series of unpermitted, unlicensed repairs on the lines and that there was evidence that equipment was involved in the start of the fire.
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me In a federal court filing last month, the company argued that privately maintained power lines at a home on Bennett Lane near Highway 128 outside Calistoga -- the point where the Tubbs Fire began just before 10 p.m. on Oct. 8, 2017 -- sparked the deadly blaze.
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me PG&amp;E, which has disputed suggestions that its power lines sparked the fire, is facing hundreds of lawsuits related to the Tubbs Fire.
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me The Cal Fire investigation found that "a private electrical system adjacent to a residential structure" caused the fire. The agency said it had not found any violations of state law connected to the fire.
@CAL_FIRE @PGE4Me The fire killed 22 people, destroyed more than 5,000 homes, and was responsible for as much as $10 billion in insured property losses.
THREAD: After a 15-month investigation into the deadliest of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, @CAL_FIRE SAYS @PGE4Me equipment was not responsible for starting the Tubbs Fire -- the catastrophic blaze that swept over the hills from just outside Calistoga into Santa Rosa.

Christianson said the suspect's name is Gustavo Perez Arriaga, 32. Arriaga's brother, Adrian Virgen, 25, and co-worker, Erik Razo Quiroz, 35, were arrested for helping the suspect and lying to authorities. Read KQED's full story here: https://t.co/t3VHODjMZz
Sheriff Christianson said Kern County Sheriff's deputies arrested the suspect earlier this morning at a residence in Bakersfield. He will be transported to Stanislaus County and charged with homicide.
The suspect has lived in the United States for several years after crossing the border into Arizona from Mexico, according to Sheriff Christianson.
Sheriff Christianson corrected his statement and said a co-worker and the suspect's brother have been arrested, not two brothers.
The suspect has two prior DUI arrests on his record, Sheriff Christianson says.
Two of the suspect's brothers have also been arrested, according to Sheriff Christianson. He said they "lied to" and "mislead" authorities.
