@LisaDayss @realDonaldTrump Then you have nothing to worry about do you. This hatred you feel toward people that disagree with you, it's not inline with the teaching of Christ. Do you use Satan's lies as an excuse to hate, does it help keep you warm at night, like a favorite blanket you refuse to give up.
@LisaDayss @realDonaldTrump Because the bible tells you so, what bible are you reading, that blinds you into following a false leader, who spreads lies and hate with every breath he takes. I'm sorry that Satan has tricked you into believing Don the Con, he stands for everything that Jesus preached against.

@growingaway @JC_Burroughs @JViscoNJ @RepJoeKennedy @Arriadna Although Hitler did ban Jewish and other "inferior" people from owning guns, he actually loosened gun laws for all other citizens in 1938. Considering the armament of the German army, I doubt pistols or hunting firearms would have saved the Jewish people from the holocaust.
@JC_Burroughs @growingaway @JViscoNJ @RepJoeKennedy @Arriadna I'll admit that you did expand you meaning in your follow up tweet, clearly I was responding to your original, disarm the citizens tweet. When I said that there was no serious threat to us becoming disarmed. Can we agree, that neither one of us want to lose any of our firearms.
@growingaway @JC_Burroughs @JViscoNJ @RepJoeKennedy @Arriadna If I have to give up some of my firearms in future, I'll blame those opposed to a few commonsense laws, and not those thst were opposed to assault style weapons and high capacity clips. If you can't see the truth in that, then your the one that hasn't been paying attention.
@JC_Burroughs @growingaway @JViscoNJ @RepJoeKennedy @Arriadna Disarming law abiding citizens to me, means taking away all guns, not just assault style weapons like the AR-15. If you don't see the difference, then I can see your point, otherwise your attempt at being witty missed its mark. I believe the difference between the two is obvious.
@JC_Burroughs @growingaway @JViscoNJ @RepJoeKennedy @Arriadna Precisely why we need common sense gun laws, if AR-15 were were not in the hands of mentally unstable people are people with a history of extreme domestic violence, there wouldn't be a big push to ban them. Those that opposed such laws, brought this on themselves.

@growingaway @JC_Burroughs @JViscoNJ @RepJoeKennedy @Arriadna There is no serious effort to disarm law abiding gun owners, that's just mostly a made up scare tactic, by people that benefit from a divided society.
