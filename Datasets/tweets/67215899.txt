The Trump administration has also pushed for more ‚Äúshort-term plans‚Äù and other options that are more accurately called ‚Äújunk insurance‚Äù because they skimp on important coverage and reject people with pre-existing conditions. (4/5)
After they failed to repeal the law in Congress, President Trump has used every power he has to sabotage the ACA, from cutting outreach &amp; enrollment to weakening the marketplace through regulation. This all has led to confusion, rising prices, and fewer people covered. (3/5)
First, the Affordable Care Act already protects people with pre-existing conditions, it‚Äôs one of the most important provisions that this law created. President Trump and Congressional Republicans have tried again and again to repeal the ACA. (2/5)

For the $5 bil. proposed to build this unnecessary wall, we could fund Pell grants for more than 1 mil. students. It‚Äôs time for Congress and the President to get their priorities straight and get back to work. Young Americans are ready for their government to work for them again.
President Trump and Congressional Republicans have now shut down the government for a third time over their overwhelmingly unpopular border wall. A recent NPR/PBS/Marist Poll found that 73% of young adults do not see construction of a border wall as a priority for Congress.

Since Congress couldn't find a way to repeal the ACA through legislation, this new guidance creates a backdoor way for states to undermine the protections of the ACA, which would make protections for people with pre-ex conditions essentially meaningless.
Today, CMS released new guidance that weakens the rules for the ACA‚Äôs 1332 innovation waiver, which are supposed to allow for flexibility to improve real health coverage. Instead, this new guidance allows states to call cut-rate plans "coverage."

Many states‚Äô #Medicaid work requirements would force part-time college students to prove they are working while attending classes, making them less likely to focus on their school work and succeed.
Among young #Medicaid recipients who aren‚Äôt working: nearly half are in college or caring for a home or family members.
Reminder: the vast majority of #Medicaid recipients who can work ARE working.

Rather than charging students more, we should be ensuring students have the resources they need to succeed in college. When students have the supports they need, they can succeed regardless of their background. https://t.co/1eq1dsR7GQ
Who the @Newsweek op-ed calls the ‚Äúweaker students‚Äù are often those who didn‚Äôt have access to the resources available that help their more affluent peers succeed and complete college programs.
Take Devon‚Äôs story for instance. Were it not for student loans, he would not have had ‚Äúthe space I needed to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, to get internships, and to make connections that enabled me to get paying gigs later on.‚Äù  https://t.co/lIjo6rWMDj
Student loans provide an entry point to earning a college degree for some students who would not be able to afford the education otherwise. For many, getting that acceptance letter does not necessarily mean they can afford to enroll.
In fact, 90% of jobs since the recession have gone to people w/ post-secondary education, and Georgetown predicts that 65% of all jobs will require a post secondary education by 2020. The value of a college degree has never been higher.. https://t.co/VZFRl4xFpQ
A college degree is and continues to be one of the key paths to economic opportunity for young people in our country. https://t.co/fdDnJ2GzKd
Earlier this week, @Newsweek published an op-ed called ‚ÄúThe Case Against Student Loans: Why Weak Students Should Pay More‚Äù - Our response:
"Any financial help plays a big role because that determines how many hours you have to work and make ends meet and know everything stays aligned." Listen to Jocelyn's story and what happens to students when state financial aid runs dry: https://t.co/eL3DgdPiye
