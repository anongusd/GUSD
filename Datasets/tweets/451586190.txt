No more tweets for ten days or ever!   Feel like the luckiest AND happiest man in world.
Consider comparative  primary turnouts for Republicans and Democrats.  @natesilver not such good prediction record these days.
If Trump nominated some Republicans may stay home, but not nearly as many Dems already abstaining or crossing over!
UK Brexit campaign gathers force as government makes obviously false claims aimed at scaring voters. Early days yet.
As predicted, Trump reaching out to make peace with Republican "establishment".  If he becomes inevitable party would be mad not to unify.
UK Labor so hopeless ruling Tories indulge in tearing each other apart over Europe..  Dangerous, even if started by Cameron.
Both "establishment" Republicans and Trump need to cool it and close ranks to fight real enemy.  Trump, Rubio, Kasich could all win general.
NYT fawning story about Hillary and Libya fails to mention resulting state of country today and rise of ISIS there.
Congratulations Michael Gove.   Friends always knew his principles would overcome his personal friendships.
Pope was wrong, but Trump moved fast to make peace!   Bet he changes tone but not policy if still winning most states by mid-March.
Tomorrow's polls. If Trump beats Cruz by ten plus or Rubio runs 2nd it's over for Cruz. And if Sanders beats Hilary in Nev curtains for her.
Trump blames me for WSJ poll, fights FoxNews. Time to calm down.  If I running anti-Trump conspiracy then doing lousy job!
Great reads in WSJ:  Charles Murray on Trumps' America and Juan Williams on pandering in the Carolinas..  Great reminders of our problems.
Tonight's  audience in S.C.  Probably rigged by party establishment.   Repeating old tricks from previous elections.
Is Hillary scared of something?  Endlessly eulogises Obama while whole world knows of their intense mutual antipathy.
Sadly UK's Independent print paper closes after about 30 years.  Any loss of diversity bad.
US race relations bad enough without Clinton, Sanders trolling for black votes trying to criminalise cops.  Worst type of pandering.
New S.C. Poll has Trump 36-19 Cruz.  Great brawl coming, plus second one between mutual hating "moderates".
Soft left softball from Clinton donor Woodruff, last night's CNN-PBS non-debate.
Chris Christie, suicide bomber.  Damages victim while blowing himself up!
Hillary speech awful point after point.  Eg, better education but against charters, rein in Wall St which she will never do, etc.
All really failed to understand immensity of global Muslim problem.  No easy answers, but Middle East just a forerunner to sub-Sahara Africa
Christie the tough bullying prosecutor. Not much on big issues.  Kasich the safe moderate, everyone's Vice President.  Carson also best yet.
Cruz a great debater performed well, but why do all long-term acquaintances distrust him?  Jeb Bush best yet.  Easily visualise him in WH.
Trump better, somewhat contained and more presidential.    Rubio inspirational speaker, a winner.  But does he have real depth of knowledge?
All candidates lifted game last night.   Everyone seemed better than alternative Dems.
@rupertmurdoch
Cameron's EU non-deal shocks UK opinion.  Now he's rumoured to be begging cabinet colleagues to put aside beliefs.
Do Obamas really want Hillary to win?
Of course Hillary's agent sought top dollar fees.  Why lie?   What she told Wall St friends IS relevant and we will never be told.
Watch Hillary's candidacy sink and sink.  Nobody buying and more big trouble coming on emails.  Dems looking for replacement.  John Kerry?
Hillary:"When I took those speaking fees I did not know I would be running for president!"   Oh yeah!!
Cameron's deal with EU a nothing.   How can sensible Cabinet colleagues accept this?  Loyalty to country more important than friendships.
Huge night for Rubio.   Plenty of room for Trump to come back while Cruz will be a big factor in South.  Now a real three horse  race.
UK-EU negotiations meaningless without complete control of borders.  Must be able to choose immigrants.
Hillary email troubles get really serious.    WH has surprising alternates if things get worse.
Hillary email breaches get very serious, even though certain Russia, China, Israel had the server hacked full time for years.
No Trump allowed several to shine.   Especially Bush, Rubio, Rand Paul.   Polls will be interesting, but Donald's figures near unassailable.
Republican candidates must be looking forward to tonight's debate.   Speaking without Donald getting all attention.  Aim for independents.
Google has cleverly planted dozens of their people in White House, Downing St, other governments.	Most brilliant new lobbying effort yet.
Tech tax breaks facilitated by politicians easily awed by Valley ambassadors like Google chairman Schmidt eg, posh boys in Downing St.@
Global tech companies making enormous profits most places, funnelling $$ thru tax havens. Unless stopped will ruin local businesses who pay.
Google et al broke no tax laws.  Now paying token amounts for p r purposes. Won't work. Need strong new laws to pay like the rest of us.
This is Bloomberg's last chance.   You never know until your hat is  in the ring!  Events change everything, especially during elections.
Allegedly Bloomberg again considering running.   If he does, may hurt Clinton more than Trump.  Seems 2016 the year for populists.
Obama says Australia second biggest anti-iSIS fighter.   So where the heck are NATO partners?
Cruz bets uniting white conservatives/evangelicals enough,   Meanwhile Trump appealing across party lines.  Surely the winning strategy.
24 hours and many influential Republicans see Trump inevitable and get ready to switch.  United by horror of Hillary whose campaign staggers
GOP debate.  All candidates do well, Rubio and Trump most effective.  Cruz brilliant debater, but what else?  Like ability still important!
Another big debate tonight.  Thanks Roger Ailes again for another great production. Keep 'em coming better and better than competitors.
O speech proclaims great virtue of Iran nuclear deal.	Tomorrow's headlines: "Iran grabs ten US sailors"!
Where to start on Obama speech?   Sounded mostly great, but totally divorced from reality.  Both US and world.  Sad.
CES 2016.   Software takes over from hardware.  Really about software created platforms.
Musk worries about AI.  hope he leads the charge, regardless of Google friendships.  Time running out.
American innovation!  Nothing beats SpaceX.   Quickly becomes world leader in massive space business. All made in US.  Triumph for Elon Musk
Life changing innovation 20th cent first Wright Bros, last the Internet. 21st cent?  Smart phones, search, social media. All shrinking world
McCullough's Wright Brothers proves human imagination with determination can achieve almost anything.   Happy and hopeful New Year!
Happy Christmas to all.   Let us take the time to ponder and celebrate the true meaning of this day.
London elites, media, etc sneering at Trump, others. No understanding of mid-America conditions or politics.
In UK prisons 5% Muslim, but Muslim 32% of "most dangerous".  Govt worried.
Bush giving much his best performance yet.  Actually most scoring very well.
Donald Trump seems to be getting even more thin  skinned!	Is flying around the country every day tiring him?  Would anybody  else.
Trump good on Internet but Kasich right on real problem: Silicon Valley encryption.   Living in a bubble ignoring all pressure.
First half most applause for Rubio and Cruz, enough for Trump, Carson.  Christie pushing hard, good debater.
Early debate, Santorum, Graham good and  effective, Huckabee ineffective, Pataki just embarrassing.  Presidential bug a terrible thing!
POTUS busy raising money for his library.  $25 mill each from top supporters!
POTUS reading Pentagon speech and Yahoo interview show one unhappy camper.    Public lost?
Politifact is Politifarce.....  NYT hails "honesty" of Bill Clinton et al and falsity of Republicans. Pants on fire!
Europe exports more to UK than reverse.   No danger of trade war. City of London well able to look after itself.
Cruz recommending "carpet bombing" ISIS.  Would only make situation worse.
UK's EU negotiation a joke. Cameron asking NY for little, now about to ask for less.  EU has made much more to lose than UK from exit.
Time to campaign to save Christians, Yazidis, facing genocide in M.E.    US, UK well aware, do nothing. All churches should unite to help
GOP mad to think of expelling Trump, or ganging up. Only justify independent run, guarantee Hilary win.  Beatable with better based ideas.
Lindsay Graham right in calling out Google, etc on encryption.  Vast majority want safety over privacy.
NOT endorsing Trump, but support Congressional vote for immediate pause to overhaul vetting process.
Has Trump gone too far?  Regardless, public is obsessed on radical Muslim  dangers,   Complete refugee pause to fix vetting makes sense.
Western civilization provocations: gender equality, gender rights, workplace diversity, the contest of ideas.
Outrageous press conference by Farook lawyers. Hope nobody believes this nonsense.
Best way to defeat ISIS and others: keep oil prices low or lower.  Liquefy all natural gas cheaply. Pollution small problem v. coal.
@Lordofmisrule79   No bid.  No interest.
Smart move by Ben Carson spending holidays with Jordanian leadership and visiting refugee camps.
Strong word Tribune newspaper group to be bought by big Wall St firm, LA Times to go to philanthropist Eli Broad and local group.
Bombing, fighting ISIS okay, but how to combat global sophisticated evangelizing on international lot harder. The bigger danger.
How ridiculous does Hilary look trying to disavow her friends and supporters on Wall St?   Somehow they will keep giving her big $$$$.
John Kerry says Charlie Hebdo not as bad as Paris massacre.  Wrong!  Recent killings mindless, Charlie was deliberate attack on freedoms.
No candidate with good foreign policy record available. Need for one with character, strength and determination.
News ISIS video directly threatens US.
Obama facing enormous opposition in accepting refugees.     Maybe make special exception for proven Christians.
Democratic debate almost too painful to watch.   Pathetic  group talking nonsense for two hours.    Is this the best Dems can do?
After Paris, Niall Ferguson in S Times compares Europe today with fall of Rome in 410 AD.  Some striking parallels. Sure to provoke debate.
Paris outrage not an attack on all humanity, but an attack on us.  ie, Western civilisation!
Trump finally loses it, in 95 minute rant calls Carson's character like a "child molester"!  Carson's beautiful put down "pray for him".
Second thoughts!  Kasich, Cruz talked nonsense on banking, Trump likewise on immigration. Fiorina best prepared. Maybe great at State Dept.
Great debate.  All did well, Carson, Bush, others did well, perhaps Rubio best of all. With all doing well Trump did not stand out like past
Undercard debate, all did better than expected, but Chris Christie seemed in different class.  Possible to see as Chief Executive.
Ash Carter may be right about Russia, not China. We are where we are because of US abdication of leadership.  Now no-one respects or fears.
Great opening for Peanuts movie.  Well deserved. Thanks to all at Blue Sky and Fox.
Facts are facts, but personal opinions and wisdom evolve with life experience.   So judge present positions and hold politicians to them.
Fair to scrutinize, but not twist findings.  No such attacks on non-religious candidates.  Even scrutiny of other leaders would help.
Carson seems to have won by standing up immediately and answering doubters.   Seems CNN/NYT etc all hate faith based people.
Note all candidates:  75% of all new US businesses coming from Latinos.   Also majority of new home mortgages.
Nat Geo 4 people let go at magazine, remainder by Society in administrative, service department.	Editorial staff, leadership firmly in place
So All Blacks were truly awesome.   Congratulations.	But Wallabies heroic in defeat.    Really great game.
Beautiful day in London.  World's best two teams playing. Praying for Wallabies win #getyourgoldon 	@FOXSportsAUS
All polls show Carson and Trump with nearly 50% of Republican votes, 80+% happy with Dr Ben!   Still long way to go.
One of greatest Aussie rugby players, Michael Lynagh, has written fascinating book on sport and life after stroke, Blindsided.   Recommend
All Blacks are awesome but naturally hoping for an Aussie upset.
@JeremyClarkson   At least we didn't run away from the Argentinians!
@BushBabeofOz @JeremyClarkson absolutely!
Great win by Australia at Twickenham.  Can't wait for final against great All Blacks next Saturday.  Ignore complaints from whinging poms.
Two reputable Iowa polls put Ben Carson well ahead of Donald Trump.   Carson, Trump and Fiorina holding more than all politicians together.
Congratulations, Paul Ryan.    Right to insist no more self destructive guerrilla warfare this Congress.
Apologies!     No offence meant.   Personally find both men charming.
Read New York magazine for minority community disappointment with POTUS
Ben and Candy Carson terrific.     What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide?  And much else.
Don't miss Ben Carson tonight on Kelly File.
Reputable IBD poll surprises with Carson at 24 and Trump at 17.     Allowing fullest possible margin of error, they would be even.
Everywhere pundits keep underestimating Ben Carson.  But public understand humility as admirable, listen to the multi-faceted strong message
What a week for Putin!      Russia back as power in Middle East for first time in over 40 years.  U.S.  left flat-footed.
Smiling, happy Holy Father leaving after most effective visit ever.
Beautiful Vespers service at St Pat's with Pope Francis. Fine homily on American priesthood and nuns.    New York in love with Holy Father.
Chinese change to consumption and services will have huge effects on commodity dependent economies. Australia, Brazil, SEAsia, etc.
Last Friday President Xi showed real determination to abolish corruption as prerequisite of further growth.  Courageous societal upheaval.
Great hour with Indian PM Modi. Best leader with best policies since independence, but massive task to achieve in most complex nation.
Popular, humble Pope Francis arrives.   Hope he notices difference between prosperous US and impoverished collectivist Cuba.  Big eye-opener
Miracles!   Clear blue skies in Beijing and New York. Only dark cloud, Giants beaten in last two minutes.
Now back to NY after China.   Country going thru huge changes from vast capital expansion to intense service economy.   Right move.
Great foreign policy follows growing economy.   Peace through Strength.  Weak economy, evascerated army leave few options beyond empty talk.
Debates empty. Only ONE issue: JOBS, creating and  training for them.  That makes America Great Again!  Everything follows.
Watch Democrats politicise 	Pope Francis visit, who has no understanding of free markets and their role in lifting billions out of poverty.
Overly flattering pic of me on today's China Daily front. Bit like Washpost and NYT coverage of a resplendent Hillary.
Watching Republicans from Beijing fascinating.  Many did better, but Rubio most of all.    Polls will tell, but still months to go.
Want to welcome the Unruly team to News team and clients with their cutting edge creativity.    Great deal, Rebekah.
Correction.    It was NYT/CBS, not ABC.
NYT/ABC poll has Carson in near tie with Trump.  	23% to 27%!      Exciting times.
Sad to see such a decent man as Abbott toppled.  Now Turnbull needs a November election before Labor sacks Shorten.
Hard left Corbyn wins in landslide, goes on TV singing "Red Flag".    How did Cameron get this lucky?  Hope he doesn't slack off.
Jeb Bush's tax proposals substantive and attractive to all.  Others note and adopt or debate.  Growth only answer to jobs, stronger America.
Trump on O'Reilly less loud and some good answers.  Carson on M Kelly impressive, humble but tough. A real vision for a great America again!
Terrific piece by Jeb Bush in today's WSJ on kicking economy into 4% growth.   Making more and better jobs for all.  2 years away.
Seems Corbyn slightly less certain of winning,   Cooper just might do it on preferences.
@KurMudGin Carson would make a great candidate.    Reading his wonderful book, One Nation.   Recommend to everybody.
@CorinneAM the Sun did not win it for David Cameron.  Nicola Sturgeon is "wot won it"!
Looks like Biden already running.  Very likely he wins nomination and be hard to beat.
@nytimes
School choice vastly improves education, thus liberating all families and forever eliminates "victim" excuse.  Only one enemy teacher unions
Choice schools ARE  state schools.   Just have to compete with each  other to live.
If Obama really looking for legacy, public school reform, ie CHOICE and CHARTERS, desperately needed nationwide, Empower all parents.
With 500 days left, POTUS right to look at criminal justice system.   Let's see what he proposes.
UK right to divert foreign aid money to refugee relief, although all numbers probably far too low.
Big military brings peace through strength.
ISIS, Putin, Iran free to run amok while all western nations continue to wind down defense abilities.
@DonaldTrump right on some things, but should not boast of bankruptcies and stiffing creditors.
Most of Syrian refugees to Europe are educated and skilled.  EU can, but won't, show it is real and welcome this first group.
Can You Trump Donald Trump on Foreign Policy? I got 6 out of 6 on this quiz http://t.co/KMILGkxUay
2 stories.  Carson, Detroit ghetto to brilliant neurosurgeon.	Obama white upbringing to community organizer.  	Sincere men, different values
Ben Carson polls improving every week.  Maybe the one to beat.  Irreproachable on background, achievements, character, vision.
Varied European responses pathetic in face of great outpouring of public sympathy.   Also consequences coming for US.
Back in U.S. after perfect break in far north Aust.   Month's biggest story ME refugee flood to Europe as anarchy follows US retreat
In spite of some blind spots, Abbott far the best alternative.   Principled and a fighter.
Only hope is new poll with govt of all the talents ready to work together with clear mandate for reform, bringing in new, young able people
One over riding social issue dominating conversation everywhere is alarm at spread of new deadly drugs, especially in rural communities.
Great progress made with Asia trade agreements by Minister Robb. Now need close China FTA.  Big chance for food, healthcare, jobs.
Seems capture of federal Labor leadership by corrupt violent unions. Govt must push on with reforms for sake of all sides or hold snap poll.
Meanwhile world commodity prices in long term collapse as outrageous construction costs kill infrastructure projects.
Extreme greenies, increasing in support hold balance. Against growth and subsequent jobs.   Seem beyond reason.
Country almost ungovernable with any Senate majority impossible for either side to execute. Bilateral agreement to change urgent if unlikely
Great month in Oz - beautiful country, gtreAt people but with large problems.
Latest Iowa poll has Carson level with Trump.  America land of hope versus fear.
Ben Carson polling.   So character DOES count.  His life story should make every American optimistic.
Iowa poll okay for Trump, if right, but terrific for Ben Carson, also topping favorability by very big margin.
This one, new technologies &amp; smart phones/internet will accelerate wealth creation, nearly abolishing poverty and disease.  With some bumps.
Ridley shows global GDP grew 5 times in 19th and 20th centuries, allowing billions to escape poverty thru inventions &amp; fossil fuels.
Re-read Matt Ridley's great book The Rational Optimist after 5 years. As stimulating as ever.  Hope next book coming soon.
Most, or all, western societies are based on Judeo-Christian values, even if currently less church going. Why deny?  We should celebrate.
Countless Middle Eastern Christians facing slaughter.  More than time for US, others to step up in face  of genocide and offer shelter.
World Heritage Fund and Queensland government doing great job preserving rain forests and Great Barrier Reef.
Just for the record, SkyNewsAust is totally independent of News Corp.
Read @peggynoonannyc in wsj online re Trump appeal.    No wonder, US media real incomes less than 10 yrs ago. Not migrants, but poor govts.
Trump's loud anti-establishment line overwhelming all except more measured #2 Carson. Rubio level with Bush, Cruz in low third place.
A climate change skeptic not a denier. Sept UN meets in NY with endless alarmist nonsense from u know whom!  Pessimists always seen as sages
In last 3 decades carbon in US air has reduced by nearly 50%.
Global growth dangerously low. Blame politicians' layers of regulations . Too hard.  US federal regs 170,000 pages before states   &amp; cities.
So markets bounce. Too much cash looking for a home.  Far too few prepared to invest and employ.  Small business the only hope for growth.
NBN may turn out ok, but nice if any govt. one day runs a project at original estimate.
Are asset values still too high?     By historic standards they are, and with global growth low everywhere, plenty to worry about.
To the naked eye reef looks fully as good as it did 50 years ago.
Tony Abbott always the happy warrior.  Win or lose, usually win, and clever fighter.
Greg Sheridan's "When we were young and foolish" great yarn about youthful friends, Abbott, Turnbull, Rudd and Carr. Irish Catholic Sydney.
of course we should do everything to preserve the reef, but first let's get all the scientific facts in a row if greens can agree anything.
Australia's Great Barrier Reef truly one of the world's great wonders.  Never more beautiful than today teeming with multi-coloured fish.
@frscmc  Yes, Free markets with a moral foundation vital.   And usually there.
NBN would be great for Foxtel, but at $56bn can nation afford it?  That's $2700 per man, woman and child. Who's in charge?
Far away from world's troubles here on Great Barrier Reef swimming and reading.  Seems irresponsible.
I did not say I would vote for him!    Just a friend I admire.
RT @VJMachiavelli: Rupert Murdoch wants Michael Bloomberg to run for president http://t.co/i5nSdScxfv 		Memo to @rupertmurdoch WRONG &amp; it's…
Agree much about Bloomberg, nannystate, etc, but still a great philanthropic executive who, with Guiliani, made NY the greatest.
With Trump becoming very serious candidate, it's time for next billionaire candidate, Mike Bloomberg to step into ring. Greatest mayor.
Smart phones give billions universal access to knowledge across national borders, hopefully bringing transparency everywhere.
Car revolution would suit Uber, whose costs 80% drivers and their cars.
If self driving electric cars take over our physical world will change, but impact still less than smart phones, which still underestimated.
Google, Apple, Uber, others fast developing new mass disruption: self driving electric cars. Cheaper, few parts, all about software.
Gates Foundation doing much good, as did Microsoft for many years with breakthrough software.
Fabulous achievers, aka Bill Gates, etc, look to be remembered for philanthropy, not enormous contributions to world through innovations.
Pope Francis attacks free markets unaware they have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty over last 25 years.
Candidate Carson attacks no others.  Being above the fray seems to be working.   Class act.
Good to see Ben Carson still gaining.  Wonderful story. 40% GOP voters remain firm for non-politicians.  Big message for both parties.
If new recession biggest nations have few tools left to fight it.  mountains of cash everywhere, but nobody investing.
All prices dropping not just shares.  Timely correction or sign of major global crisis in near future?
Corbyn increasingly likely Labor winner.  Seems only candidate who believes anything, right or wrong.
NY Times and London Sunday Telegraph with long very different views of Amazon and Bezos.  Find links on Drudge for great reads.
Organic best but very expensive in U.S.   We only drench animals once a year, which healthy but not strictly organic.
80% of Australian meat and diary products free range, v. very little in U.S.    Much healthier.@.
But great beaches and rivers should be protected for humans!  Only improve our fragile environment.
Ocean damage from waste dumping, chemical spills, huge netting of all fish  more serious to environment than any carbon emissions.
Corbyn?  Very likely win, but Cameron does not deserve such luck.
@Danny7576 Trump?    Actually a friend for many years, but disagree strongly on many issues.   But he tapping into widespread public anger.
Big week for Abbott.  Now gays can win by democratic poll, not politicians fighting in parliament.
Shark population and attacks increase as greenies stop culling, claim sharks are also "human".  What next?
Back in beautiful Australia.  Politics much simpler than US but more poisonous.
All candidates, both parties, have to expect thorough scrutiny, including many tough unexpected questions. Only way to be fair and balanced.
Congratulations to Sen Chuck Schumer on brave, principled opposition to dangerous Iran deal.  Hope he persuades others.
Baier, Kelly, Wallace great job Thursday. Fine journalism, no more, no less.  Friend Donald has to learn this is public life.
What a fantastic night for USA, democracy, freedom and incidentally Fox News.  Congratulations to all.
@nic11j  yes.
Wash Post p1 -  FBI investigating Clinton emails!    Real question should be the "destroyed private" ones.  Bet Russia &amp; China have them.
@nic11j   Father a Daily Mirror driver to turn 100.   Congratulations, Yes.
New WSJ poll shows Walker, Bush in strong place.  Interesting to see first poll after first debate.
@FidgetGray expect@Trump to dominate?   Not if others smart, which many are.
Met person worked few months for Post Office 40 yrs ago, just notified his records hacked - ie, social security number, whole life.
Fox Thursday debate vital for all candidates.  If Trump gets thru unscathed it will be big win. Time for all to understand his support.
Finally Biden may jump in as Hillary slips almost daily.  Biden decent, smart pol but gets in trouble as a motormouth! Fun ace ahead.
Actually Fed trillions ended inflating existing assets.  Stocks, real estate, art.   Is it a bubble?
@JoeTheAtheist  Not disagreeing about banks.  Issue much wider.
@graylondon explain how rich hot richer.  Easy!   Fed printed trillions but regulations scared big and small from investing. Ended in W St.
Slowest recovery in many decades.  Economy and people's lives ever more regulated. No wonder disillusionment with politicians.
Official!  Labor costs rising 0.2% in stagnant economy.  GDP up 0.9% outside of six companies.  Middle America clearly suffering.
Why are Trump and Sanders popular?   Easy.  Real median income of working Americans less than ten years ago.
When is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let 	alone the whole country?
ElPaso safest city in U.S. with over 500,000 population in 	2010,11,,12 and 13.  Figures to come for 2014.
So FBI says 267000 illegal aliens incarcerated.  Who are the other   two million presently incarcerated?   Seems like social breakdown.
Mexican immigrants, as with all immigrants, have much lower crime rates than native born. Eg El Paso safest city in U.S.  Trump wrong.
Nobody asking the real question over Clinton emails. What chance server hacked by Russians and/or Chinese.  Intel expert: 100 percent.
Trump popularity based on frustration with DC and endless regulations over people's lives.  Thought this was Rand Paul's issue.
Conclusive win for gay rights, but let's not have war on freedom of speech or religion.  Would defy all American ideals.
HillaryNo. Bashes rich banker friends without mention of 'carried interest'.  Must gave heard from moneybag Sen Chuck  Schumer.
HillaryNo Promises outlaw free speech about LGBT.  What next?	Sounds almost fascist.
HillaryNo Surely smart enough to know she was talking nonsense at yesterday's yesterday.
Welcome back, Jack Dorsey.  About time!

More nonsense in Mail on Sunday about my views on Europe. Very different in quality from Daily Mail.
Merkel, against much advice,  openly helping Greece stay in EU, but danger Greeks overplay hand.  Shows Cameron not asking enough for UK.
Fascinating two days in Berlin with great Bild editor Kai Diekmann.	Always new things to learn.
"No bias" says James Harding!   Apparently he does not read his own 	webpages.  Otherwise called "going native".
Regulations should protect competition, create conditions for start-ups and modernizing disrupters everywhere.
Vast sums printed inflate all asset values but leave wages, productivity low with record youth unemployment. Critical problem in U.S., EU.
Anemic world growth everywhere in spite of near free cash in big economies.  Why?  Ever growing regulations choking employers.
Weird leap by Mail on Sunday alleging a big u-turn by me in supporting Brit staying in EU.   Misunderstanding somewhere.
After UK Tories on 5/7 now Poland's Justice party wins presidency.  So no great global swing to left after all.  Spain just a messy mix.
U.S. nightmare:   Iraq again.  To go in again or give up. Presently doing nothing and losing.  Implications for all Western countries.
European crisis: Libyan boat people.  Can or should they distinguish Syrian political refugees from economic ones?
Now time for  UK to deregulate and lead world with strong growth in jobs and pay.  World flush with new money going nowhere but dead assets.
Cabinet picks surprisingly good.  Osborne, Duncan Smith, Gove, Javid, Whittingdale, Patel, more women.  Few toffs!  Great start.
UK poll explodes myth of social media power.  Great time for competitive free  press.
Despite universal condemnation and terrible campaign, UKIP held huge vote.  Cameron needs to remember.
So all UK polls nonsense.  Also bloody nose for BBC.
UK Polls predict closest ever result, followed by  months of instability without unlikely last minute big swing to Cameron.
Real fight in Vegas last night after endless UK elections Partisan crowd, unlike judges, thought brave Pacquiao won.  Sat behind P's mother.
Tweet responses interesting.   Maybe I guessed 10 too many Cons, but either way Scots probably will hold the balance.
@RevJFletcher @jeremy Clarkson today in ST more compassionate re immigrants.     My feelings too.
Remember business revolution from Internet  Some great disruptive coys create jobs, like Uber, others automating old jobs.
Asset inflation because "advanced" economies crippled by regulations and power crazed lawyers.
S. Times shows rich almost doubled over last few years.  Same in US.   Why?   Central bankers printing trillions, no real job creation.
Scots may be crazy or not wanting self rule, but who can deny right of self determination?    Feels inevitable over next few years.
UK. Failure to win majority against either Brown in crisis or Miliband would mean chop for Cameron. Open talk today in party and press.
UK. Likely approximate outcome, far from certain - Con 294 seats, Lab 265, SNP 48, LD. 25, odds 18.  Everything still to tight for!
UK.  Many possible outcomes.  In spite of denials, SNP still see Cameron as perfect enemy. Cleverly hurting Miliband, hinting support
UK. Polls all indicate hung parliament, possible constitutional crisis. Doubt the crisis bit.     Deals, maybe dirty, will be done.
Forget Scotland, UK already seems 2 countries, London and the rest!   Take totally new wave of entrepreneurship to correct.
@GJElvidge Brit aristos won over third of globe for UK.  No!  That was mainly the Scots.
@rayne_ea some Brit arrogance going now,  Agree,, but the alternative?  Hold your nose and hope for Boris, or anyone!
@trevzal1 many Brits also killed.   True.
Congrats FOXTEL, especially Brian Walsh and brilliant collaborators on great Deadline Gallipoli series.
Huge turnouts all over Australia for Gallipoli memorial services.
Today centenary of Gallipoli disaster.  Testament to Brit aristo arrogance, incompetence. Many thousands brave Anzac youths slaughtered.
Sturgeon won only in that she cemented already huge gains for SNP.	Knock-on effect good for Cameron who needs the help.
When are we to get some real policies from Hillary?  Dangerous  if different from Bill's  successful ones.
No show Cameron only winner in UK debate as Scot Sturgeon 	clobbers  Miliband  and Farage stumbles.
UK. Ed Milband asks who will be in Downing St when I call? Fear not! Never been there unless  invited and never in  last six years.
Guardian today suggests my dad's expose of Gallipoli fiasco led to my anti-establishment views.  Maybe, but confirmed by many later 	events.
Damning but respectful piece in today's Journal by H Kissinger and 	G Schultz on Iran "deal".    How can POTUS sign this? Awful legacy.
@Joanna Stern. Can I please have the Apple watch now?  I want to read @WSJ on it.
No reason trust terror  supporting Iran but should we gamble young emboldened by Western contact, forcing change internally? Tough question.
UK debate.  Great performances by SNP Sturgeon and UKIP Farage, Cameron sort of ok, Milliband not, Clegg pathetic.  May not count in May.
All civil libertarians should worry about doubling, world wide, of murder rate of Christians and Jews.  Just today it was Kenya.
Both sides overreacting to new Indiana/Arkansas laws, but sad to see friend Tim Cook maligned.  Great businessman, decent human being.
Great piece in Techcrunch by immigrant, PayPal founder, etc @mlevchin .  Absolutely right. http://t.co/ZSqaVFyMuA
Iran deal.  Will there be enough Senate votes to override an Obama veto?   Very possible!
Most elections are referenda on sitting governments. Cameron's mistake is insisting it is a referendum about Miliband.  No vision yet.
Whither US-Iran deal?  Meanwhile Iran backs terrorists in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Eastern Iraq, rules Qatar, Syria, etc. Does WH understand?
Just visited the fabulous, massive Getty Museum in LA - only one mile from my beautiful vineyard!   What an amazing gift to this city.
Why did Cameron agree to TV exchange?  He had everything to lose and Miliband everything to gain.  Now watch Tory panic.
Entertainment Weekly rates American Idol #1 on MUST LIST, calls 14th season "pitch perfect, contestants controlling stage".
Finally into Ron Chernow's great work on brilliant Alexander Hamilton.  Wonderful picture of US in 1780s  and 90s, esp war torn New York.
Thanks for 2 mentions, Ed Miliband.  Only met once for all of 2 minutes when you embarrassed me with over the top flattery.

How stupid can BBC be in firing Jeremy Clarkson?   Funny man with great expertise and huge following.
Rahm Emanuel pulling well ahead in Chicago mayoral race. Only hope for reform of awful schools, city's terrible finances. Good luck!

Boston Globe twice calls for Elizabeth Warren to run!  What gives?	Good idea to test Clinton.  Webb has fine message, but no traction.
Lee Kuan Yew died at 91, great uncompromising statesman, first met  50 years ago in Canberra.  Advice always wise.
Now Yemen, after Kenya, Tunisia, Afghanistan, in one week!  Are we really safer, John Kerry?
Congrats to all at Fox.  Last night's spell binding Empire won huge audience.  Deservedly.   And tonight's Idol should be great viewing too.
Good point!  Compulsory voting seems anti-First Amendment. Australians have option to vote informal, which many do.
Agree with POTUS about compulsory voting.  Works well in Australia.	But will not necessarily have the effect O expects.
Senior intelligence people say certain that Hillary's messages totally hacked by several foreign governments.

Aust!  Turnbull's plans to scrap certain rules suit buddies at Nine.  Can't oppose dumping all regs but not this. Nice to see how MT plays.
So Hillary's problems do go on and on.   Amazing vitriol from Maureen Dowd today. Almost makes one sorry for H, even ashamed for laughing!
Hillary's email problem won't just pass, but run and run. Regardless of any new shocks, this will go on for a long time.
Lucky me!   Promised ticket for Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao in Vegas May 2nd. Maybe biggest ever ppv event.
Fabulous show! Musical of Alexander Hamilton, great acting, dancing, singing. Historically accurate with lives of Washington Jefferson, etc.

Constitutional crisis ahead.  Senate will reject Iran deal or pledge to cancel with next administration.  Litmus test for all candidates.
New Pakistani "grooming" scandals in UK come as latest migration figures embarrass Cameron.   Only UKIP gains.
Netanyahu speech gets most attention and debate for decades.  Important moment for all sides.
Cameron's Tories bash vulnerable Miliband for months with no effect on polls.  Need new aspirational policies to have any hope of winning.
UK:  London elites of both parties fail to make contact with rest of country, especially Scotland.  Election shocks coming.

Putin wins again.   Western appeasers allow another huge slice of Eastern Ukraine to be grabbed.  Ignore excuses and lies. Where next?
Long term AUST optimism great, but right now all parties must engage whole public in realistic debate on present facts.
Aust needs national economic summit with real treasury figures,and all parties, labor, business etc also best brains like Costello, Keating.
@hannj666 RBA notes sounds like selective quote What about ballooning deficits, subsequent collapse in commodities - which nobody's fault.
Just a minute!   Which should I vote for movie of the year?  Birdman, Boyhood, American Sniper, Theory of Everything, etc? Anyone care?
Taxes!  We pay every penny.  And tens of thousands receive dividends from our international efforts.
Any AUST govt faces absolute necessity for tough change.   Change could bring poisoned chalice
LNP govt failed  to tell country about dire state of economy.  Gillard left manufacturing impossible, then commodities collapsed.
@DazzHassan 82-39 if Nat allies counted.  Right.   But only shows difficulties ahead, especially if TA doesn't admit few mistakes.
Abbott survives 61-39.  Now needs to say he understands complaints and will govern more inclusively, both with public and his party.
@MrBeaujanglesSA  quality of politicians stinks.    Sadly true of many countries.   Try UK, etc.
POTUS: Christians behaved terribly several centuries ago But today?  Christians, Buddhists, Jews most Moslems fine Why not name 	barbarians?
Abbott, good guy, not perfect but no case for rebellion.  Remember last one gave us Gillard disaster.   Country still paying for it.
With world infinitely more complex and dangerous,what to do?  Boots on ground sounds good, but how many and where and when?  Can't isolate.
ISIS growing more barbaric, extending into Libya, Al Q. grown fivefold, Putin on March, how can POTUS claim foreign policy success?
@JohnLacny  None!   No overseas balances.
Future corp tax rate at competitive 20%, NO special deductions, sparking investment boom and jobs all over.  Unemploy half all lobbyists!
One time repatriation of trillions at 5 % would give massive boost to whole economy.  Afterwards tax o/s profits net  14%. more
Corp tax deal should be possible. Adopt Paul/Boxer and some moderated Obama proposals- could be great.  More.

Tens of thousands of jihadi victims are Muslims and millions fighting back. But important for people of all faiths to address the threat.
Certainly did not mean all Muslims responsible for Paris attack. But Muslim community must debate and confront extremism.

Extraordinary scenes in Paris today, but do not forget the heroic sacrifice of Ahmed Merabet, Muslim police officer whose funeral was today.
NY mayor deBlasio seems hellbent on undoing all Bloomberg's great reforms.   Especially schools. Meanwhile big business fears debate.
Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US.	Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.
Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.

Potential Ebola crisis needs immediate world-wide thorough precautions, not panic.
Almost unbelievable US treating Qatar as ally when they financing most of our enemies.
Today Fox News' 18 th birthday!  Last week No I cable channel, including entertainment, Great achievement by Roger Ailes and wonderful team.

Too early to be sure, but November election shaping up as a Republican wave.  Could lead to immigration reform and some economic progress.
NY mayor deBlasio' tax and regulations will soon stop Bloomberg's progressive momentum.  Tragic for world's greatest city.

Brit Labour conference a real downer, Tories now shaping up for same.   Meanwhile UKIP surge likely guarantees Labour victory next May.
British Justice Secretary tells Scots "get off my lawn".  Will Cameron	now say the same thing to EU?  Needs to, to win coming election.
Most interesting week in British politics in memory.  Gordon Brown, a man reborn,most effective. Cameron's solo politics a knock-out.
Proposing Britain becomes a big Switzerland logical outcome of first promise to Scots, is pretty revolutionary. Many doubters, maybe delay.
Cameron's  promise of devolution, now for all parts of country, without consulting cabinet, clever politics, but divisions in all parties.
Alex Salmond's sudden resignation makes him most honest politician in Britain.   Actually he seems to have changed country's future.
Really proud of the whole team at Scottish Sun for superb coverage of referendum.   And grateful.
Exit polls sound very ominous for YES.  Now everybody on both sides must ensure Cameron and Milliband keep heir promises and not weasel out.
Nonsense reports alleging violence in Scotland, surprisingly good mannered crowds both sides. May change tonight with pubs open all night!
Scotland now voting.  Nobody can be sure of outcome, but Yes organisation likely to make it very close.  Either way, UK changes forever.
Huge AUST surprise anti-terrorist raids netted many suspects. Also seems $9m stolen and sent to ISIS.
Just saw the hilarious Simpsons short video on YouTube. Brilliant fun.
Correction.  Battle of Bannockburn was June 1314,  treaty with England signed in September!
SNP not talking about independence, but more more welfarism, expensive greenery, etc and passing sovereignty to Brussels.
Scottish economy may or may not be ready for independence, but country is ready emotionally and politically.  However.......
Coincidence or fate?   Sept 18 2014  700 years since Battle of Bannockburn threw off English yoke. But now SNP wants to swap UK rule for EU.
With all- party promises of max devolution, if kept, Britain will be a different place, certainly better managed.  Tough negotiations ahead.
That process must continue.   Despite English patronising, whatever the outcome, extremists on both sides will fade, warm feelings return.
Foundations continue to lift millions out of poverty.  World an	Immeasurably better place, living standards continue upwards for billions.
Should remember Scots invented modern world 200 odd years ago with Scottish Enlightenment.  Free people, free markets, decent restraints.
Scotland. Have to worry about some of Salmond's allies. Far left socialists and extreme greenies. Must change course to prosper if he wins.
Another ISIS beheading reminds us world's biggest crisis today is	war of barbarism v. civilisation.
NO camp counter- productive with bullying and lies,until  Brown entered. But most don't knows will vote No, on " better the devil we know".
With hundreds of thousands who never voted before, how can polls with small samples be sure.   Mixed forecasts prove nobody can tell.
Unprecedented 97 per cent registered.   Everywhere alive with debate. Democracy truly at work.  Both sides predicting victory.
Cameron and Brown have promised so much more devolution if No wins,  Britain will look like a federation.  Bet many Tories outraged.
Tried 24 hours incognito Scottish visit (failed!). No politicians, just street and pub talks.   Glasgow, Aberdeen, Rosehearty. Great people.
Congratulations to wonderful Anna Patrice Botin on appointment as Chairman of best Spanish bank, Santander.  Will do great job.
Scotland.   Sun- Times poll has four point lead for No, Guardian two,	Salmon folks tiny lead to Yes.   Nobody knows.
Shocking! Obama trouble in getting meaningful support for war on barbaric ISIS.   Allies distrustful.   US history of letting friends down.
Salmond a friend, great politician, man of the people, etc, but I would be much happier with another great Scottish AS - Adam Smith!
New poll disappointing for Salmond, but not a big deal.   Still all to play for.  But AS had a bad day, promising membership of the EU.
Okay, how would Salmond govern?     Socialist paradise no.	People need jobs, decent pay, streamline bureaucracy,new investment. No EU.
Congrats to @amplify on their new direct-to-consumer math game Twelve A Dozen, available now. More here http://t.co/DFXmgLbtQI

Piers Morgan seems unemployed after failing to attract any audience in US.   Seemed out of place.  Once talented, now safe to ignore.
Generations of Scottish  preacher forefathers came from beautiful northern fishing village, Rosehearty.   Now totally silted up. Sad.
Scots better people than to be dependants of London.   Hard choice with real pain for some time.   Maybe too much.

Scotland.  Now southern parties all promising much new autonomy if vote is No.  Problem for them now is credibility. Also too late.
Salmond's private polls predict 54-46  Yes. Desperate last ten days ahead for both sides.   Most powerful media, BBC, totally biased for No.
@DavidSenater my opinion sure to happen.  No, but Salmond very clever and sure to press on, or will Scots chicken out on the day?
Scottish poll reflects world-wide disillusion with political leaders and old establishments leaving openings for libertarians and far left.

Great to be with @nflcommish at our @FOXSports retreat. Looking forward to another fantastic season of @NFLonFOX http://t.co/tTQT55hLeE

Anti-Chinese riots and factory burnings in Vietnam serious and may spread.
RT @FLOTUS: Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls. -mo http://t.co/glDKDotJRt
Hard to believe slave trade, not just sex, still prevalent in Africa and large parts of Middle East.  UN as-ever unconcerned and useless.
Story of lipped Nigerian girls horrifying.   8 more today!   Outrage not enough.   Only safe return, justice for perpetrators.
Story of kidnapped Nigerian girls horrifying,   Another 8 today! Outrage not enough.only safe return, justice for perpetrators.
Great day at Kentucky Derby.  A real American institution.  150,000 people having a great time, but with a lot of tradition.
Warren Buffett complains about Omaha hotel rates moving.  Thought he believed in free markets, supply and demand, etc?
Silicon Valley one day, next Miami.    What a great country of booming contrasts!     Pity most of country in between not so happy.
Google attack on NSA extreme nerve.   Google has more data on all of us and uses it.   No evidence of NSA doing this. Ethical company?
Just completing week in Silicon Vy.  Exponential increase in innovation, not just here but world wide.   Implications ( jobs?) unpredictable
Google grows more exciting.   Now hiring top academics to work on anti- aging
God bless and happy Easter for all Christians, especially those suffering persecution in many countries.

Vegans wake up!    Bill Clinton looks incredibly healthy after giving up this nonsense. We all need a little red meat.
@Zarnie50 No,   Never give up.
Great morning taking young daughters to Rio2.  Fantastic animation with nice story, even if politically correct!  Idealistic , good for kids
How long before Putin moves further on Ukraine?  Kerry sounds pathetic, EU gutless.   Neighbours now terrified and seem friendless.
Stock market dive overdue, may have further to go.   Means fewer IPOs this year.   Meanwhile Alibaba getting hassled by Chinese government.
Who advised POTUS to embrace Al Sharpton on very day new scandal erupted?   Sharpton always a rogue disgraces otherwise good causes.
Microsoft moves and options for future fascinate.  Need for big clean out of bureaucracy and focus on next big tech wave.  Metadata?
Why did Al Sharpton allow FBI to wire him?   Patriotism or blackmail pressure?
Repeat Afghan election a triumph.  Country bears no resemblance to ten years ago.   Taliban reduced to small, ineffective number.
Please join Jon Stewart, Sarah Palin &amp; me in supporting returning veterans in their careers: Via @ACPUSA http://t.co/h3QYKH45ds
Afghan successful, peaceful election, taken with condition of country, will make millions of critics reconsider.  Looks like triumph.

500,000 followers on twitter! @markscordo put me over the line.  Will have to send him some @foxsportsAUS gear to say thanks.
40 per cent of early deaths caused by life style.   Left alone, insurers would soon educate people eating crap, smoking, etc.
Sick of world being run by central bankers.   Where are some strong democratic political leaders?   Let rates float and watch people save.
UKIP,Farage still making progress.   Without a deal Cameron will be dead meat after 2015 elections.  Prepare for Radical Labour.
Signs Obama's pressure on Putin friends is being felt.   Should lay it on harder.   They only understand money. And warn off Baltics.
US just finished ten days campaign of political correctness. now we should not use the word bossy.  We encourage bossy bosses of both sexes.
Where will this end?   Guinness pulls out of religious parade bullied by gay orgs who try to take it over.  Hope all Irish boycott the stuff
Charter school fight leads to greater understanding and helps all education reformers.  Issue will not go away.
de Blasio attack on charter schools  major issue. Heat  being applied by few wealthy supporters flooding effective tv.  National issue soon.
777. Still think this a reminder that US and China should be working more closely on Muslim extremist threat.
World seems transfixed by 777 disappearance.  Maybe no crash but stolen, effectively hidden, perhaps in Northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden.
777crash confirms jihadists turning to make trouble for China.   Chance for US to make common cause, befriend China while Russia bullies.
Looking to punish Putin?    Easy!   Freeze or impound all cash and assets of oligarchs in US, UK, and reachable tax havens.
NYC now totally managed by leftist activists with no experience in running anything beyond protests.  Big mess ahead.
Obama should all Chinese President following today's incident and say " we both have the problem of Muslim terrorism. Can we work together?"
Charters.  How can de Blasio do this same day Obama making major effort for disadvantaged black and Latino boys.
Charters. Mayor, WHY? This hurts poor families who only want a better school for their kids!  Parents outraged. http://t.co/ZlD2J5PPDP
Education. Private sector, churches, community organizations must all support our disadvantaged youth.
POTUS right to focus on youth education. All kids deserve good full high school ed.  Huge dropout rate enlarges underclass impoverishing	USA

Wild winter in US, UK, etc.  no respectable evidence any of this man made climate change in spite of blindly ignorant politicians.
$90 for 100&amp; 24/7 tv channels expensive? Try family outing two hour movie and compare.
Great partnership between spotify and Times of London. Fabulous tone quality.  I link spotify to my jambox.
Interesting fact.  Last 20 yrs life expectancy for women not high school graduated  has declined five years, three for men.
POTUS has called ed conference at White House this Thursday.  Hope a real effort coming with big measures.  We'll see.
Answers lie in education, where we've gone way backwards, and deregulating everywhere to allow entrepreneurship to restart. Fast too.
US recovery third straight with no job increase.  Great, enriching, innovations pushing millions out of work force.   Just starting.
UK proposing 9 hour school days, many fewer holidays.9 hrs to include homework sport etc. polls show very popular especially working mothers
Recent silence due bad back accident and other distractions.
Keenly awaiting next week's State of the Union address. Opportunity for launching real education initiatives to give equal opportunity.
Great edit in WSJ attacking DOJ for war on Apple.  Outrageous process  likely to be appealed forever.
Australia in deep economic trouble left by last six year wildly incompetent govt. New govt must take quick, painful actions.
Australia surrounded by vast gas and oil deposits. Huge developments financed by Chinese, Japanese contracts while local industries closing.
Amid Xmas extravagance and festivities, Christians should pray for millions of fellow believers being killed and persecuted in Middle East.
Just landing in Australia after endless flight.  Worth it. What's better than family Xmas, even in heat wave?
Bloomberg seems busy talking about his achievements I Why? History will do it.  Greatest mayor yet, future now frightening.
2013 ends with Paul Ryan the most respected and outstanding Republican. Principled and modest.  Trusted by all sides.
Much excitement about @Storyful. Wonderful company doing big things in digital content and video, will be a great asset to @newscorp .
Huge changes as Putin snares Ukraine after complete EU incompetence. Maybe mass protesters can hold out.
Deflation worrying world. Energy glut, disruptive techs, destroy skilled jobs.  Answer: deregulate everywhere possible, open opportunities.
NYTimes says I'm most eligible bachelor!   Wish I was forty years younger.
Money funded and raised by Mike Milken to cure prostrate cancer over twenty years sees annual death rate down from 150,000 to 29,000.
Pope Francis messages great and needed, but forgets free markets, with all their faults, have recently lifted one billion out of poverty.
Congratulations to new Twitter director.  Let's hope she does not repeat Nokia accomplishment!
Good US and UK figures this week.   Don't trust them until we see much more.  People still having  hard times. Rich richer, poor poorer.
US moving ever- faster to class society.  Equal opportunity ideal must be restored and progress made or all will suffer.
Watch new Merkel govt take mighty Germany into gentle decline. EU fast becoming leaderless bureaucratic quagmire.
Monterey Aquarium next to famous Cannery Row must be one of best in nation.    Loved it, as did party of kids. No more deep diving!
Of course Washington also very great president.  Without him and LINCOLN no US today. Few other greats &amp; plenty of well- meaning disasters.
Great time to be reading Rich Lowry's fascinating new             		Lincoln Unbound.  Surely our greatest, most interesting president.
Happy Thanksgiving all.  Busy teaching young generation it's full meaning.
Pity no action this year on immigration. Obama working with Republicans gives hope for real action early 2014, otherwise take years.
Thanks for all for attending WSJ CEO conference, especially President.
WSJ  CEO conference great success. Plenty of worries. Obama, Christie, Ryan very impressive, but Summers knockout with sheer brilliance.
Pope Francis revitalising Church worldwide with wonderful challenging statements and actions. Certainly making me, like others, rethink much
Looks like QE keeps going for long time, just making rich richer leaving masses behind, also serious global dislocations.
Reading Francis Collins in  WSJ on genetics, can we all live to 120 or more?  Probably not, but our children for sure.
Inspiring evening in North Carolina for Billy Graham's 95 th birthday. 	800 dedicated evangelicals.  Good people doing good works.
Tech driving world change ever faster.  Bill Gates, with his wonderful philanthropy argues otherwise, but using new tech in all great works.
Newscorp sad case of damage by ignorant consultants.   Fast being repaired by infusion of experienced managers.
Australia feels totally different to six months ago.  Govt will cut massive  regulations giving real optimism. Should cancel wild spending.
Townsville Bulletin excellent local paper.  All North Australia will experience booming growth with new state and federal governments.
Great to be with Frank Lowy tonight for the @LowyInstitute anniversary dinner. Honored to be a part of this event. http://t.co/XYblWDukuD
Has Cameron got no idea of effects of ever-rising power charges on masses? Lose election or stop windmill nonsense , start fracking now,
Riverina beautiful as ever, but whole state seems covered in smoke haze from big coastal forest fires.  Many homes destroyed.
Paul Ryan emerging as real leader.   Responsible, consistent and on top of big issues.
Oops! Better ignore last tweet.
"Please expose Eric Schmidt, Google " etc.   Just wait!
Big media trials in London in 2 weeks.   Remember, everyone innocent until proven guilty, entitled to fair trial in most countries.
If universal reports true, O should quickly rename Obamacare as Pelosicare.   Smart Republicans lying low, waiting for next year.
POTUS has spoken of entitlement reform and competitive corporate taxes Why wait?  Political point scoring ineffective after crisis past.
SV/SF, Israel, Beijing will remain greatest centers of innovation so long as they keep attracting most clever young techies. Change unlikely
Of course innovation is everywhere, but not great transformational work until governments get out of way.  Eg. EPA closing down nanotech.
@Mr.G.  BBC has couple hundred right wingers!   2/12 per cent.      Name them. BBC has won, what hope for UK to join 21st century? Wake up.
San Francisco - Silicon Valley spirit gives one new hope for US. World has three great innovation centres: SF, Israel, Beijing. That order.
Back in amazing Silicon Valley. Wonderful Stanford University inspires.
No deficit cuts pre fiscal cliff and both sides lose See polls. Obama ought to be happy with 80 per cent win. " I won" argument unpopular.
My very best wishes to Michael Rooney, leaving Dow Jones/WSJ for sabbatical. A great, talented ad man. And tall! http://t.co/z4e0J89okt
BBC massive taxpayer funded mouthpiece for tiny circulation leftist Guardian.  Meanwhile print media about to be gagged to protect toffs.
Huge lack of balance in UK media with 8000 BBC left wing journalists far outnumbering all national print journalists.
Let's hope POTUS has real negotiations before fiscal cliff, as all other presidents have done.   Otherwise he will be blamed for big crash.
US energy self-sufficiency and  big bi-partisan deal would lead to years of boom, job growth.  Must come next few days or we face disaster.
Govt shutdown and debt limit make for huge, dangerous crisis. Deal with plenty for both sides possible opening route to millions of jobs.
Republicans, muscle shown, now link debt  to big deal: allow Obamacare for now, get entitlements change, biz tax cut, go for growth All win
Simplicity so much easier, and both more beautiful and stronger.  Leads closer to fairness for all.
Cruz' grandstanding will cost him long-term, smarter Rand Paul silent. Meanwhile# both sides seem incapable of political deal making.
Are Republicans self-destructing just when Obama at his weakest? Partial govt shut-down small issue compared to possible default.
.@GabbyStern1 enjoy, now turn out a great wsj tomorrow!
Interesting visit from Afghan foreign minister.  Credits most progress to completely free media since2001. Election conduct next year vital.
@joey b.  am I turning libertarian?   In some respects always have been.
German,, UK. US polls all show 18-24year olds turning libertarian. Want less govt at all levels, more opportunities now.Historic moment.
Week ends with confusion about Fed policy, but growing realization most of economy, and mass of families, in bad shape, not improving.
@robert elliott.  Pope taking Church down path of Anglicans.  Wrong! Many Anglicans divided and some  really giving up all faith.
Pope Francis setting great example in humility and thought provoking  open thinking.   Really refreshing.
Great first day by PM Abbott firing top bureaucrats,merging departments and killing carbon tax.  Much more to do yet.
WH courageous in refusing greedy demands for Obamacare exemptions for big unions.   Encouraging.
Game, set and match to Putin with unknown consequences. Maybe right to arm secular rebels six months ago, now too late.
Al Gore.  Pls explain record increase in Arctic ice. Other greenies crippling US growth in opposing safe tracking for natural gas.
Unprecedented hard times for US youth generation, but nothing compared to Europe.  Euro currency discipline making for bigger social crisis.
US recovery hard to find across country.  Real wages since 2007 for under 35s down, over 35s up average less than one per cent. Really tough
Reading all the tributes to Hillary Clinton as amazingly hard working Secretary of State. But what legacy did she leave?
Congratulations to the entire @nypost team on their website relaunch.  More great things to come! http://t.co/IUFerBmgG1
As long predicted, QE2 would not create jobs, only make rich richer.Now, how to back off without further damage?
Small item:   Apart from higher pay, public workers in Australia take many more sick days than those in hard working private sector!
@nikt50 where is my evidence?   Listen to talk back radio in UK and US, see masses of letters to editors and you will be convinced.
@registradus biggest problem multinationals not paying taxes? Not biggest, but real problem. Amazon,Google, etc should pay like rest of us.
@rupertmurdoch "Tele wot won it"!   No, Australians just sick of Gillard'-Rudd incompetence and infighting wrecking great county.
@gabriellecj "Tele wot won it"!  No. Australians just sick of GilardRudd
@joelcamb believe in Paid Parental Leave?  Yes, completely, but should and could be paid for by business, not taxpayers.
Aust election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy.Others nations to follow in time
House and Senate members receiving record number of constituency calls overwhelmingly opposed to Syrian intervention.
Price of sudden US isolationism will be huge power vacuum waiting to be filled by very willing bad guys.
@BritRoyalsEire Stealth bombers too expensive?  Really?  Paid off well for Bill Clinton in Balkans.
Nobody wants invasion of Syria by US, but what will a few Tomahawks achieve?  Where are our Stealth bombers if we need them?
What is worse n Syria?  Monster Assad backed by Iran and Russia or Al Qeada and Brotherhood with even bigger ambitions?  Shame O boxed in.
Obama in huge gamble risking lame duckery. Clinton never asked before throwing missiles around. Polls will be terrible unless Assad repeats.
Fracking will make US not only energy independent but cheapest country for industry, homes, etc with massive boost for employment Wake up NY
@antonbar Google way ahead with metadata.  Yes, but not without some  interesting players competing with great leaders. Msoft cash may tempt
Microsoft change fascinating.  Big hedge funds at least partly responsible. Successor needs to get back in front of tech world. Metadata?
Obama attack on spiralling tertiary education costs right, but should focus on failing K-12 scandal, hurting especially minority kids.
Conviction politicians hard to find anywhere.  Australia's  Tony Abbott rare exception. Opponent Rudd all  over the place convincing nobody.
Good for UK Chief Rabbi Sacks!  "Let's put multiculturalism  behind us". Societies have to integrate.  Muslims find it hardest.
@tuckahoetommy FS I is channel 219 on Direct.
Saturday Fox produced 86 hours live sports on various channels, with	FSI beating ESPN in prime time.  Congrats to all.

Cutting regs needed to create opportunities for jobless graduates and middle class to start small businesses and get real growth.
Political class horrible.  Just look at NY Sate and city prospects. Pols gutless, incompetent and too many corrupt. While jobless increase.
US job crisis very serious.  Stimulus v. Deficit debate irrelevant. All levels of govt must cut regulations, company tax ( and deductions)
Oz politics!  We all like ideal of NBN, especially perfect for Foxtel. But first how can it be financed in present situation?
Over regulation, both fed, state and county, and uncertainty stopping small business start ups essential for recovery and employment.
Friday job figures terrible. Lowest percentage in work for 30 years.20pc workers on part time. Average wages going down, food etc prices up.
Consider K-12 system.  Every kid should graduate well, vs today's 30pc drop out. Let's try vouchers, like New Orleans. Great results
@mathof1 @JohnRentoul "great fortunes don't survive long".  Not talking about the Brit class system.
@NCMarrk opportunities exist, just being killed by regulations.  Right, and uncertainty.
@MatthewLumby billionaires paying almost no taxes.  How about starting killing ALL deductions and flat tax on all after first 50k?
Making rich poorer won't do much.  Giving opportunity to poor to become rich is the only way forward. Great fortunes don't survive long.
@russ_clayton am I off Capri.  No!  Working in NY.
Disparity of wealth much worse with Fed printing trillions, most of it ending up in Wall Street automatically making rich richer.
POTUS right about greater and greater disparity of wealth. Even worse societal effects than he realises. BUT curable with good education.
Job situation remains terrible.  Wide small business startups needed. Make possible by slashing regulations, fed, state and county. Only way
Polls show Congress in low public esteem.  Unfair to many good people, but problem is complete leadership vacuum except for Paul Ryan.
NY mayoral hopeful Weiner almost tragic if not so funny.   What a sicko.  Should help city by just fading away.
How come Apple profits down?,   US stores were jam- packed last weekend.   Poor economy must be forcing buyers to lower priced products.
Met PM Abe few weeks ago. Huge victory Sunday gives great opportunity to bring Japan back but it will be very tough changing culture.
Congratulations Chris Froome on great win.   Also Team Sky, second Tour de France win in succession.
@rawpest what opportunities do I give?    How about 50,000 jobs?
Obama race remarks understandable, but unwise.  Already great role model, should be preaching responsibility and equal opportunity for all.
For decades Americans been wasting billions on ethanol, either thru taxes or at the pump. Getting worse.  Both parties at fault. Corrupt.
Putin internal suppression, external trouble making getting seriously worse. Why not chuck Russia out of G8?
Sen Reid right!   Boehner should allow House of Reps to vote on immigration.  Lead, for country's sake.
Great discussion on Egypt at Allen and Co.  New coup seems just Chapter Two in move to democracy.   Let's hope.
Almost unbelievable.  Both Spitzer and Weiner running for office. Contrition apparently out of date.
Independence Day.  Immigration is our history and immigration MUST be our future.  Multi-ethnicities and equality under law for all.
Congressional Republicans may be missing great opportunity on immigration, hurt US as we'll as selves. Where's the leadership?
Thanks to good friends @JimCameron and @BrianGrazer for joining our 21st Century Fox team today. http://t.co/UKDHhhW8UB
Australian public now totally disgusted with Labor Party wrecking country with it's sordid intrigues.  Now for a quick election.
Wow!  Snow den in Moscow looking for refuge. Once again Putin testing POTUS.
Don't look for early peace in Syria.   Putin determined keep Middle East on boil to sustain oil prices essential for sick Russian economy.
@KKXG do I think $GOOG chair Eric Schmidt behind Prism?  Unlikely, but plenty of other things which may come to light soon.
Pope Francis preaches and clearly practices humility.  Doing God's work by example.  Now needs to reorganize Curia.
New NT Chief Minister Adam Giles showing leadership and courage in tackling terrible abuse of indigenous kids.  Saving a generation.
Wonderful article by Bill Cosby in NYPost today on personal responsibility.  Cosby a great iconic figure for decades.
If pay rates right, how come huge projects being cancelled, even restaurants and bars can't open on Sundays or holidays?
Sorry.  No. 2 fell off iPad somehow!  Can wait.
Australia 3. Problems ahead: falling exports, businesses contracting all over with extreme labor costs, alarming employment trends. $ diving

@Goudah what about Mexican grads?  Of course, if they want. But Mexico now growing  new president fighting for great reforms. Will take  off
@luvcomedy too many European bludgers going to UK for welfare. Will make British even more anti- European.
On way from the  Land of the Free (?) to the Lucky Country for a few days hard work.
Of course we have unemployed grads in US, but grads of what?  We're talking about high paid STEM jobs.
We have to provide path to citizenship for millions of hard working, honest Latinos.  Can only strengthen the country.
Immigration drags on. Meanwhile many millions great graduates unemployed in Europe who would enrich US. ( and Australia).1000 s of jobs open
@lisang  so does the Old Testament.   True, but we have had something called the Reformation.   Remember?
Koran(2) "except as punishment for murder or other villainy" then defined as "those who wage war against Allah" punishable by beheading.
Get real.  Koran says(1) "whoever killed a human being...it shall be regarded as having killed all mankind...
@Ifearforfuture Kelly says his success luck.   Truth is otherwise, Ray just too modest. Maybe lucky to have support from great mayor.
Many UK tweeters say no terror.  Admirable, gutsy, but get real and go listen at some mosques. Admit most okay, but others really scary.
@JamesMadeley Shame if Times backed Miliband.  Ask editor, but bet no danger.
With UK on terror alert, Cameron off on holiday in Ibiza. Unbelievable.
Ray Kelly great public servant.  Only hope of averting disaster for NY. Look at  alternatives lining up to bankrupt city , hobble cops, etc.
RT @nypmetro: Top Republicans pushing NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly to enter mayor's race http://t.co/wLiRk8fI4v
@foxesdale challenge Cameron help to RedEd. Maybe be reverse, way to give stronger alternative if given time to change course.
RT @DeepakChopra: Religion is the belief in someone else's experience.Spirituality is having your own experience #Atheism is no experience …
@stuwilkinson76 Cameron be PM next year.  Probably right, and longer.  Only pointed to sudden controversy.
UK politics suddenly very fluid.  Even Spectator magazine speculating challenge to Cameron.  After three years what will be his legacy?
Congratulations to Artsy for big success at Art Basel  in Hong Kong attracting most top Chinese collectors and best artists.
@ParvaPower outraged but not scared.   Great.  Wear Help for Heroes   T-shirts and support all troops. Lock up the evil brainwashers.
London horror killing will be big test for Cameron.   Could save him or finish him if he mishandles.   Public rightly scared and outraged.
Not up with UK details, but nothing seems to change except UKIP surge, whose immigration policies I can not buy.
@shoobert61 power of press.  You and so many tweeters plain paranoid.   Get real.
Oz polls show nothing can save this miserable govt. Election can not come soon enough.  People decided and tuned out months ago.

Laurene Powell Jobs fighting for Dream Act.   Congratulations and strength to you.
@garethsprice NYC taxes reasonable?   Yes best city, but wait for next year with Bloomberg gone and the pension bills roll in, plus, plus.
@der_herr_flick  yes, taxes on all my earnings, but not complaining. Just suggesting possible method to avoid all too obvious IRS abuses.
What is Fairtax?  Consumption tax?  Very regressive.  Here in New York I pay federal, state and city income taxes, totalling well over 50 pc
Growing IRS scandal makes perfect case for flat tax and abolition all deductions.  Nothing could be fairer and abuse free.
@leoniehaimson @amplify not losing money.  Not even in business yet.
@kidLiam Australian carbon tax a gesture to show China something.  Think one billion hungry Chinese studying us for a lesson?  Come on!
@KKXG ShouldBloomberg execs resign? Ask Mike, not my problem.
Australia itself makes no carbon problem.  China does, but what can we do other than meaningless gestures costly to every home?
@stevewalz  Australia one of best economies in world. Not now, but can and will be one day. Also one of best countries.
Tony Abbott should not be making any promises .  Carbon tax and giveaways should  be scrapped Inheriting broke country. Fix up first.
Look out Facebook!   Hours spent participating per member dropping seriously.   First really bad sign as seen by crappy MySpace years ago.
Only way to handle the  IRS story is for a special prosecutor. Else one arm of highly politicised govt investigating another arm. Bad week.
IRS story getting bigger every day. Maybe dominate ewes cycle for some time. Other biggie, Bloomberg reporters spying on financial clients!b
Somewhere IRS out of control going after not just Tea Party followers, but organisations using the word Patriot in title.Explain please.

NYT op-Ed today argues. US inhospitality to teenage migrants led to Boston terror attack.  Give us a break!  And they charge $2.00!
@ToneyMaroneyMP  unelected cultural elites ruling not just Australia.
@melcoool  what can lower m class do? Very little with new regulations every day stifling initiative.   Just too hard.
@MikeCarlton01 re class war.  Problem is the system preventing the great majority from fair opportunity.   Too much govt prevents start-ups
@gabrielroth  redistributive taxation.   We've got that.  We need great public education and opportunity for all to progress without limits.
@SongbirdIIthere need to encourage investment.  Only practical course is through massive startups of small businesses. Regulations too harsh
@markduwe when poor stop getting poorer we'll see progress.   Could not agree more.
Fed continues printing mountains of money, chasing non-existent inflation.  Rich just getting richer, rest going nowhere. Trouble inevitable
@jjarichardson  deletion of Millie Dowler's emails.   As stated by police, and properly published everywhere but Guardian, NOT done by NOTW.
Ho! Ho! Leverson becomes Loverson!   Can affirm Santorini very romantic.
Needless FAA cuts politics at their worst.   Millions will be inconvenienced.
@BobBurke prayer and meditation of God much better.   Yes, but maybe room for both.  I'll report progress.
Trying to learn transcendental meditation.  Everyone recommends, not that easy to get started, but said to improve everything!
All NYPost pics were those distributed by FBI.   And instantly withdrawn when FBI changed directions.
Why does British establishment protect famous alleged BBC paedophiles while demonising popular journalists.  Toffs for toffs, hell to public
Congratulations.  James Harding new head of BBC News. Right man for right job.  Need to cut down cultural arrogance ruining Britain.
Farewell Iron Lady. Great radical achieved huge changes, but still much to do.
Proposed immigration changes big step in right direction.  Deserves great support, although big debate inevitable.
Great idea for Thatcher "presidential" library. Important to support commemoration of great PM before EU sinks UK. She knew.
Margaret Thatcher: symbol of liberty and strength. Changed Britain and the world for the better.  May she rest in peace.
Having two days off with some colleagues and family in Australian bush.  Feels like spiritual home.  Peace and rest.
200 + protesters for my speech at IPA  Ok Bet mainly rich kids nothing better to do.  Reminds me of self 60 years ago! So what"s new?
After 3 fascinating days in newly optimistic Japan, great 24 hours in  expanding  Darwin, more work in Melbourne and Sydney, speeches, etc
Typo!  http://t.co/56lohhp0l6

Thanks to the team of Fox Sports Japan for showing me the studio last night: http://t.co/Kf1TiI4ei0
Great visit to Fox Sports last night on their first live broadcast of a baseball game.  Won by SoftBank Hawks, owned by friend Masa Son.
Attention David Cameron! Both Japanese and S Korean prime ministers claiming M. Thatcher as model with high public approval ratings.
Chinese social media emerging as a force for change, seemingly without any pushback from government. Numbers just huge.
After hard day of meetings, great tour of magnificent and huge Forbidden City.  Full of  priceless treasures. Emperors sure lived well.
Real change coming in China over time, but just beginning. Don't spect big declarations, nonetheless real.
Beijing 2013. Spirit of innovation everywhere. Big hopes for popular new president Xi. We shall see. Huge issues to tackle.
Oz media censorship beaten back.  UK holy mess with Internet unworkably included.  Cameron showing true colors shocking many supporters.
UK Royal Charter requires Queen's signature.   Unlikely without full all party support. Queen doesn't do politics.
@MIPooh Story of wsj allegiing Chinese bribery 100 per cent wrong.  Never a penny!
Attacks everywhere on Pope Francis misguided.  Jesuits were seriously split, but no evidence of being complicit in any persecutions.
Strength to humble Pope Francis.   All US cardinals voted for him in every ballot!  Faces tough,tough job.  Will be great leader.
ME getting uglier by he day.  Iran upping supplies of missiles thru Syria to Hezbollah to attack Israel, while Egypt close to food riots.
Kids enjoyed screening of new Dreamworks movie, the Croods.
@kentzimmermann Agree, of course proper legal framework needed. But stagnation leads to rich getting richer, poor getting poorer. See U.S.
History teaches nations with too many laws, endless regulations, just can not grow or generate enough jobs.
Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, few excellent, frustrated ministers. Farage reflecting  opinion. Florence mayor Renzi brilliant young Italian.
Stagnant Europe wracked by discontent and resentment of EU.  Glad we contributed to UK resisting the Euro over many years.
Few days in UK, Italy. Politics both places very fluid, economies going nowhere. New leaders emerging on distant horizon.
@Havenr64  I have nothing to do with  SMH, never have!
What is. 2.4 per cent cut, when spending will still be up?  Any blind man can see far more wasteful govt expenditure than that . Many levels
POTUS still popular, but job approval going down into the forties. People sick of false scares.
Let dept heads decide cost cuts they know are easy and relatively painless.  Politicians just dictate totals, stop log rolling.
QE, or money printing in massive scale, causing speculative inflation in oil and other commodities, all hurting recovery, negating intention
In California. Small ranchers, businesses, etc state, federal regs making desperate, depressed. Talking Wyoming , even Chile, Australia!
Keystone Pipeline not needed for energy independence.   Many opinions, let's discuss. And let's stop wasting money on ridiculous windmills.
Is Keystone Pipeline really good idea?  Bringing lots of heavy, dirty oil across country, when fracked ,  cheaper, cleaner energy available
Look at this!   Mexico corporate profits equal 24 percent of GDP versus 12 in US. No wonder poor head north for opportunity to prosper.
Here they come.  PC hypocrites scream about Sun publishing pic of murder victim in bikini after Huff Post carries 40 of same subject.
So Page 3 tweet is breaking news... Typical OTT reaction by the UK PC crew.  Just considering, as we do every page daily Buy it and see.....
@Kazipooh page three so last century!  You maybe right, don't know but considering. Perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas.
How can Hagel be confirmed after testimony showed almost total ignorance of defence issues?  Maybe Obama equally disinterested.
Drones okay, but must be used much more sparingly, otherwise every hit a huge recruiter for jihadists.
How do liberals explain complaints about Guatemala with silence on drone killing, civilians and all, without arrests, trials, etc?
@CalebRapoport what do I know about hacking?   Nothing until about two years ago.  One newspaper guilty several years ago. Nothing since.
@kgranju buying Richard III's bones.  Did we?  First I heard about it.
@LVKen7 will sharia law come to US?  No, never, I hope.  But Europe maybe where courts wild.
Chinese still hacking us, or were over weekend.
Great send off for Ed Koch in NY today.  Really important mayor. Never forget that first campaign coming from way behind. Actually fun, too.
@krONik re Morgan Poll.  It's just that  Newspoll has infinitely better record of accuracy.
@Mr_Frost_ uk economic troubles.  Fear you are all too right.
Sure spoke too soon.  Seems we have a game!
Ravens too good, too big, too fast   Hope next year's game on Fox a lot closer.  Great advts from Jeep tonight.
@shittydeath re Elia Kazan's Wild River on blu- ray.  Must get.  Great film and cranky Elia was a personal friend.
@GlaceLuxuryIce inflation here.  Just starting with massive Chinese buying of agricultural produce.  Check your supermarket bills!
@gabrielroth re stimulus. Need real growth in GDP ahead of attacking many wrong- headed and abused entitlement program's.
@gabrielroth re fiscal stimulus. No! First certainty and clear conditions for business start ups. Big revenue neutral tax reforms essential.
Inflation alert, agree with@Soros. Big central banks printing huge sums money, failing to produce jobs or manufacturing. V dangerous times.
Amazing UK High Court decision recognising rabbinical divorce law, now Sharia law certain next.  What sort of society, if any, will emerge?
At board meeting Harlem Village Academy. 5 great schools doing wonderful things for mostly critically poor kids of mainly single mothers
POTUS in Vegas to talk immigration but hasn't reached out to Rubio or Jeb Bush or anyone working to build consensus. Why not?
Gerald Scarfe has never reflected the opinions of the Sunday Times. Nevertheless, we owe major apology for grotesque, offensive cartoon.
@Amirmizroch what I have to say about Sunday Times cartoon will not be on Twitter.  Sorry.
@rodgers_duncan re Gerald Scarfe.  Yes, but what I may wish to do and can do are different. Remember those undertakings?
@smaccaroo global warming.  Any tweeters have a sense of humour?
When will a  political leader emerge who will expound strongly on the basic morality of free markets and equal opportunity?
Many governors, legislators, etc here in DC.  All talking bipartisanship on great issues of education and immigration, except maybe Obama.
Let's have petition to keep Piers Morgan in U.S.  We need him, as does CNN.
Back in US. What happened to global warming?  London, D.C, New York seem like new ice age!  Rockies too.
UK politics fascinating. Cameron flat footed  Milliband with Euro referendum promise, but still faces scepticism in own party.
Goal! We won the rights in the UK to show clips of all  380 Premier league matches on the Sun, Times &amp; Sunday Times digital/mobile apps!
@ryanp2 good immigration reform should be as open and generous as politically and economically possible. That's where I start the debate.
@slvmart Rubio proposal just.   Right on!
Hopeful good bipartisan immigration reform coming from Senate. Will precede any Obama political initiative.
Did not mean to be  unsympathetic to 400 lb lady, but fact remains unhealthy eating by rich and poor driving up premiums for all.
Constitution right about guns for self defence and hunting.  Founders did not mean modern weapons of war.
How did fat lady who fell thru street get to 400 lbs?  Welfare, stamps, etc?  Then leave us all with 20yrs immense health bills.
Hopefully we'll get some real actions on guns tomorrow, not just some stage managed stunt. This is federal imperative, not for states.
@ piers Morgan.  Glad we sorted out your problem. Welcome to the world's greatest Sunday paper.
CES confirms America still the land of innovation and entrepreneurship.
CES shows this  a time of immense change with every company at risk, but equally great opportunity.
At CES getting many brilliant presentations. So far most fun Buzzfeed @peretti http://t.co/Dn3DRu9M
Enjoying reading Nicolas Berggruen's Intelligent Governance for the 21 st Century.  Heavy going, but sweeping views, if too optimistic.
Read Matt Ridley in yesterday's WSJ.
@ThisIsBeats fossil fuels finite.  US has enough gas to be energy independent for centuries.   Cheap too.
@JimFraeErskine renewable energy.  I should have said uneconomic  and therefore wasteful, some more than others.
World growing greener with increased carbon.  Thirty years of satellite evidence.   Forests growing faster and thicker.
Why not switch from useless renewable energy investments to real job creating infrastructure projects.   Many great possibilities waiting.
Biden- McConnell deal will not help economy, jobs or deficit. Only immigration, education,innovation, entitlement reform can get thru this.
Fiscal cliff likely avoided with big victory for Obama.   Please him, but won't fix economy. Next crisis coming later runaway  inflation.
@Notintheface1 Fox News and guns.  We're all on the same page about automatic weapons.
@pasparakis Sky broadband complaint.   Sounds bad and will pass on your disappointment.
5 days to fiscal cliff Will Obama negotiate or just wait and blame Republicans for consequences?  Dangerous games.
Just saw Zero Dark Thirty.  Gripping film but could inflame Arab world. Coming debate on torture should include all sides, but won't.
@SophieRo3  education.  Yes, investing heavily.  Most US public education steadily down grading country in competitive world.
@LeUnicorn No!  Single shot hunting rifles, skeet shooting shot guns,etc ok if certificated and numbered by police
NY Xmas ruined by lunatic shooting 4 firemen,killing two. Shooter killed before, jailed, later released on medical grounds. Must wake up.
Happy Christmas to all.  Enjoy!
True. If British police can frame and destroy a Cabinet minister, what chance an ordinary citizen? Then cops do inquiry into cops.
Obama handing over gun issue management to Biden. Now Xmas and danger all anger will subside  and fade until next horror.
@P2Blogs $55mil political donation.  Not mine, not one penny! Pls stop idiot fiction.
Nice words from POTUS on shooting tragedy, but how about some bold leadership action?
Cheaper and cheaper US$ causing world inflation and currency wars as many industries become uncompetitive &amp; layoff workers.
Terrible news today. When will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons?  As in Oz after similar tragedy.
Back to basics. Sorting world's best merino wool, cooling ewe for summer. 85% goes to China. European market slides. http://t.co/lncaYPek
@stevenrobson  7 day Times okay if all retained.  Agreed, but all editors make some changes over the years. Don't expect revolution.
Bloomberg may buy FT but likes New York Times too. Both small change for him and new challenge after 12 years great public service.
Great visit with the editors in Melbourne today.  Terrific professionals.@ http://t.co/qTqMOZcI
No, 103 yo!  There are limits!
Many thanks for condolences about my Mum. A great lady, wife. mother and citizen.   193 yo, but still a blow.
Congratulations to Robert Thomson, incoming CEO of our publishing company. A special leader and great friend. Also an Aussie!
Relief!   I can now talk about what has been full- time effort two weeks.
Central NY choked with traffic and tourists, bars and restaurants over flowing.  In spite of drab weather.
Evening with some of world's top docs completed great day!
FasterCures, accelerating medical solutions by organizing the sharing of university,company and govt efforts getting amazing results.
Driving thru California Central Valley - add Silicon Valley and Hollywood   How can such a place be broke?
@123jg4 James' promotion,   Yes more tests and exams than anyone, so stop fantasizing.
@nhealey Nepotism!  My kids have worked their backsides off, and continue to. Hard work develops brains.  See Coyle.
@MurdochsU Australian cover-up.  What the hell are you all talking about?
Great reading. The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle. Forget genes!  Greatness isn't born, it's grown - the hard way.
Life of PI masterpiece movie released last night. All at Fox rightly proud. Congrats to Liz Gabler and great director Ang Lee.
Also great day to give Thanks for loving family, great colleagues, loyal friends, amazing 103 y.o. Mum still fighting for happy life.
Thanksgiving Day great for all Americans. Still the greatest for charity, innovation, opportunity and much more to perfect.
Sanctions on Iran working with economy near collapse and govt increasingly unpopular. Things in right direction at moment.
M.E.deal great news. Israeli restraint amazing. Makes Netahanyu wildly popular at home.  Pray Iran stops trouble.
Obama making excellent statements on Israeli situation, but if they don't deter Hamas and Iran more than words will be needed. Getting ugly.
LNG halves carbon emissions. So stop wasting billions on windmills now!  On climate change, China is the whole game.
",Jewish owned press" have been sternly criticised, suggesting link to Jewish reporters.  Don't see this, but apologise unreservedly.
Obama right to visit  http://t.co/DjJVPFIo.  Should have added two days for Indonesia.  Great potential ally, but needs attention.
NY state, as broke as California, or worse, still frustrating any effort to develop huge oil and gas opportunity for jobs,fortune. Explain.
Why is Cameron cheering Obama victory?  US attention now on Pacific,  rightly. Atlantic weakened, and O does not like delusional Brits..
Why Is Jewish owned press so consistently anti- Israel in every crisis?
Lincoln film magnificent .  Acting and directing best n world.  Proud to be associated, even modestly.
Can't Obama stop his friends in Egypt shelling Israel?
Middle East ready to boil over any day. Israel position precarious. Meanwhile watch CNN and AP bias to point of embarrassment.
Looking forward to seeing Lincoln film , which we partnered with Disney.  Reviews pretty fantastic.  Screening tomorrow.
Petraeus evidence confirmed all suspicions.  This story will run and run
Big majority economists all convinced 3 percent taxes on high earners, plus nearly 4 per cent health, many state lifts, etc mean no growth.
20 top business guys, not Wall Street, had two hour session with Obama, Lew, Jarrett, Geitner, etc. all spoke strongly but still pessimistic
Majority of business leaders, big and small, now convinced Obama will take us over fiscal cliff.  I hope O just negotiating.
Obama looking confident, presidential, even if not totally frank about number of issues.  He won, and sure knows it!
No doubt Obama will insist on 3 per cent tax rise.  Will have to give Republicans real offsets to avoid fiscal cliff.  Likely outcome!
BBC mess gives Cameron great opportunity to reshape and improve. And listen to non LibDem cabinet colleagues.
BBC mess gives Cameron golden opportunity properly reorganize great public broadcaster. Fast inquiry to Include both critics and supporters.
.@vbma22 Petraeus.  Yes, of course.  But should not be forgotten for great service
Benghazi hearings next week without two principals - Hillary and Petraeus.  Hillary deserves break, but next week in Australia?
Petraeus tragedy.  Probably greatest general since Patton, or even earlier.
Now BBC will probably split editor-in- chief and Director General jobs.Would be much better. Guess FT Hislop real sleeper candidate.
2012-2016 changes. Iran gets bomb, china begins major reforms, US crash as bond market revolts, N Africa explodes, etc. What next?
Right!   Newsnight did not specifically give name.  Left to twitter.
Editor- in- chief apologises and pleads total ignorance.  Press having field day! What are editors for?
BBC getting into deeper mess.   After Savile scandal, now prominent news program falsely names senior pol as paedophile.
Petraeus affair has not been a secret for months.  Must be more to story.
Petraeus will deny any mystery.  Still certain was induced to prevent embarrassing evidence at next weeks's hearings.   not idle speculation
Petraeus resignation.   Timing, everything suspicious.  There has to be more to this story.
Hillary to spend most of next week in Australia, while O hides Iran attack on drone until after election.  What next?
Election comment.  Republicans have to ignore 5 per cent nativists, embrace hispanics, welcome best Asian and European graduates.
.@PAforClive That is why we have more than twice as many readers!
Must have sweeping, generous immigration reform,make existing law- abiding Hispanics welcome. Most are hard working family people.
Well, we are where we are.  Same dangers ahead-  Iran, fiscal cliff, inflation, maybe unmanageable debt, etc. Country 50-50, must compromise
Amusing fuss over NYT public editor.  We see all two million daily subscribers as our very public editors.
Everybody searching for any scrap of news about election tomorrow.plenty of straws to grasp for Romney, probably not enough.
Could not care less about Bush tax cuts.  Issue is size of government.
Contradictory evidence from all over.  Impossible for any sensible person to make confident prediction. O's " vote for revenge" bad .
Seems slight edge to Obama, but Romney seeing small late surge. Many state polls look unreliable.
What happens if Tuesday result gives us status quo?  Congress refuses  tax increases, Obama refuses entitlement cuts. Fiscal Cliff real?
Ignore last tweet.  Sorry.  Petraeus has NOT taken fall for O.
Benghazi scandal.   Look who has taken fall for O.   America's finest non- political public servant:  CIA chief David Petraeus.
.@kingswing72 Christie changed mind on election.  Has he?
.@Mykuhl broader access to the media.  Yes, thank two major factors: the First Amendment and now the Internet, open to all. Cf. Europe.
.   @bcarthur re civil discourse.  Study history. Has much changed?
Christie doing fabulous job for state, but he was first Republican gov to support Romney, and has worked tirelessly for him Help to remind.
Just look at European welfare state and broken countries.  Some want US to follow, others not.  Why can't we debate civilly?
. @nps_ca UK politics.  Have supported Labor for more years than Conservatives. Not member of any party here or there.
Christie and Bloomberg both doing great work. Can't blame Christie for being on front page of every paper palling up withO, but misleading.
Monolithic media will spend next three days pushing Obama, but final outcome far from certain.  Early voting patterns look very different.
Here is the link for Summly app	https://t.co/4b948NG7
Beautiful new news app, Summly, launched to days ago, already no I in news apps worldwide https://t.co/4b948NG7
Thanks Bloomberg right decision.@Now Christie, while thanking O, must  re- declare for Romney, or take blame for next four dire years.
Congrats toAlan Murray on his new role at Pew.  He's a great journalist and colleague, and will be missed by us all.
People in/around NY hurting badly. Bloomberg wrong. Power diverted from freezing homes to marathon. On top of endorsing Obama!
.@Tetburyboy Bloomberg endorsement useless in swing states. Who cares in Ohio, etc?  NYalways a lock for Dems.
Mixed opinions about electoral effect of Sandy. I think big help to Obama.  Now Romney must get attention with big visionary speech 		plans

Bertelsmann- Penguin faux merger disaster. Two publishers trying to contract while saying opposite. Let's hear from authors and agents!
Benghazi scandal, lies, concerning masses, but Romney right to stick to economy for last few days.   Public smarter than WH thinks.
.@JonathanFlora @alex_stephenson whole story fabricated.  Read all court records and decisions.  Fin Review normally okay, but lost mind .
.@Alex_Stephenson Tide Is part of weather.  Read!

@rupertmurdoch  toppling builder's crane 100 floors above Carnegie Hall making all nervous. Real storm and wind yet to come. Pray okay.
@rupertmurdoch  toppling building crane hundred floors above street making everybody nervous.   Real wind and storm yet to start.  Pray ok.
Gallup still has Romney five points in front, others much less.seven more days of suspense.  Personally expect low turn out.
Today. Is anniversary of Steve Jobs' death.  We miss him, always will.
Benghazi debate still hot.  Most interesting is Obama still refusing use words " Muslim terrorism". After 4 years, now this.
New York, New Jersey shutting down for Sandy.  Eerie feeling, but kids getting ready to celebrate no school.
.@BrigidDoyle2 @jimellisforusa @djfcm What cover up?  Nothing to cover up anywhere.   Please disprove or shut up.
BBC scandal growing ever bigger.   What will happen?   Almost nothing, I bet.  Just noise for a while.
Wen story today obviously helped by enemies, but who is clean? Probably some old timers, but whole society must be boiling.
Great NYT story from China today.   When do masses explode?
Romney looking better and better while Obama seems devoid of anything new. May try October surprise, bomb someplace!  Remember Clinton?
Most of this week with Dow Jones team.   Exciting things coming soon. http://t.co/fJiYu5G1

@Sknowles3    huge, and rightly so.
.   @Chris1966 Ever heard of Brit libel laws?  Protect people like saville?
So apologizing for America did not impress!  Surprise.  Look at whole Middle East, listen to Putin, etc We are hated, despised or a joke.
So Security had drone over Benghazi throughout attack.   When will Obama come clean.  Either lying or incompetent or too busy campaigning.

Fascinating changes in China emerging.  Seems Shanghai forces coming back in ascendancy after ten dull years.  Slowly progressives	come back
Amazing Australians so into meaningless prestige.  Thought better.
Investors, pension funds keep putting vast sums into Treasuries.  No hope of getting back full value.  Printing presses guarantee inflation.
Look out!  European countries all reported Sept cliff, also China sudden slowing.   Who next?  Unlikely just a blip.
Romney started campaign dreadfully, almost asleep.  Now Obama campaign  trivial, not facing fact this is referendum  No plan for next term.
Hard to believe Gallup's seven per cent to O today.  Would mean amazing sweep.  Next seven days, especially last debate, crucial.
Maybe Rahm Emanuel will make great mayor of this city. Real sob, just what needed to face great challenges.
Big deal!  Australia gets temporary non- veto seat on Security Council.  Cost big fortune in foreign aid all over the place No Aussies care
In Windy City, Chicago.  What a truly great metropolis.  Great challenges, but great people.
Hugh Grant states that he is deeply involved in his daughter's life - I accept that,regret tweet on the matter. Apologies  to both parents.
I did not say all celebrities were scumbags.   Check my tweet. And apology to any who misunderstood.
Typical ABC in Oz.  alleged I called hacking victims "scumbags.  Direct lie.  Major correction and apology please.
.@glenferguson51 Right.  Dodd-Frank protects big banks.
Last four years.  Rich have got richer, poor poorer.  So much for "hope and change" .  What planned changes for next 4 from O?
Libya, defense, foreign policy all big issues, but pale alongside jobs and good opportunities.  In fact, dependent on this.
Romney plan to dig out of dept thru growth and education only way.
Country needs reopening with drastic cuts in regulations to allow small business get started.  Big can look after self.  One recovery path.
Americans yearning for good secure personal futures with opportunities for improved lives.  Continued unemployment. No plan from Obama.
O much livier this time, but could not promise any  better four years than last.   Surely the only big issue.
O way aloof from executive role. Eg, has not met Energy Sec for many months, nor top legislative leadership group this year. What gives?
@DrYanceY17 sure, I've been called a lot worse.
.@DesHoughton you bet!  Life of Pi coming soon, already heralded as a classic.  Let's hope.

Huge problems ahead while finance bigwigs fight and Bernanke keeps printing dollars like mad.  Talk about inviting inflation!
Back in LA. fantastic weather. No wonder people love it here.
Extreme inequality bad, and worse over last 4 years. Close tax rackets ((eg carried interest) and improve opportunity for all with schools.
Saville- BBC story long way to run.  BBC far the biggest, most powerful organization in UK.
@Selkie I never referred to any particular people, just some " dodgy" self promoting celebrities.  Repeat apology for language.
@IanRobHowell Libel laws prevented doing our job.
@nospin2012 Do not like much about equity finance business, but that is not the issue right now.
@oliver_segal Thanks.  Likes of Saville further protected if we don't fight Cameron, dodgy celebrities in UK. Could not happen in US.
RT @ninaberries: @MattGarrahan @rupertmurdoch That would be a great acquisition!
@Groovy_Retro Yes, but not for public people who sell their names.
@AbyinWindum never a secret meeting with any Prime Minister, as records show fully.
@MediaServicesAP If true, shows absurdity of British libel laws.  No transparency allowed there.
@shibleylondon " trust the toffs" means trust them to look after themselves ahead of all else!
@philipoconnor Can't comment.  Everything sub judice, but truth will come out one day in distant future.
@Groovy_Retro  Yes.  Transparency  essential any democracy. Only available in USA. Most open country in world.
@PolProfSteve  Sorry, you are right. Sometimes too angry.
@Hudsonsquawk  Except for Fannie and Fred - and blind Fed printing money and not watching banks. Next crisis inflation.

Great day in Afghanistan. First football grand final founded by friend Saad Mohseni. Very popular. Taliban promised stay away. Go Saad!

Who's heard of VICE media? Wild, interesting effort to interest millenials who don't read or watch established media.  Global success.
@sivori Obama has dozens of expert buyers, Romney just one! And paying higher prices.
China in crisis. Massive public anger at corruption.  Maybe change on way.  Nobody can make confident predictions.
@BasharAssad2012 Stop murdering your people, then tweet.
@JSmithLC Yes!  Big issues, gigantic, for whole world.  Hot spots everywhere.  Middle East afire, Russian kleptocrats flexing, Europe broke.
@AEI Much bs about green energy.  Answer easy: we have 100 years natural gas, total self sufficiency, half carbon emission. Why wait?
@AEI
Nightmare for Israel if Obama wins.  Biden outright lied about personal relations with Bibi. Susan Rice for State real nightmare.
Next debate Romney needs to ignore personal attacks and pivot to plans for millions of jobs and real opportunity for all. Only that matters.
White House still lying about Benghazi.  HAD to know truth, or is whole admin a shambles? Biden threw CIA under bus, now WH throws State!
At moment election looks like coming down to Ohio. Huge spending by both sides, but Obama tv buying operation infinitely smarter.
@anthonyleahy  CNN for one!
@anthonyleahy CNN for one.
Early polls show narrow win for Ryan.  Unimportant - will be forgotten in face of two big presidential debates coming next fortnight.
Whatever he missed, Ryan's made great closing remarks, against Biden who had to look down and read second rate stuff.
Biden clearly dissembled about the Benghazi scandal, not to mention a few other big things.  Ryan too polite to interrupt and score points.
@atlasuprising possibly, even accidentally.  But the interesting ones are the parties' own deep state by state polls that tell the story.
Pollsters for both parties agree never before seen such a sudden shift in voters' opinions.   But will it last or go further?  Too early.
@BillGrantham_ shareholders showing nearly fifty per cent profits since last meeting.
Busy preparing for next week's company AGM.   Signs pretty peaceful, but any shareholders with complaints should take profits and sell!
New tv season shows huge growth in dvr use, with viewers doing all their own scheduling, except for live sports. Giving networks fits.
After years of hard work by Wendi and others, beautiful Art.sy web site launched. Greatest database of contemporary art freely available.
Close race in CT.  $$ flowing in - Chris Dodd told me more than all 5 of his!  All local stations in most markets can't believe luck.
All holding breath for new debates. Great excitement all over. Meanwhile off to Yankee Stadium for hopefully great game.
British libel laws limit freedom of expression everywhere.  Hope Cameron keeps his promise of  major reform, but not holding breath.
Who knows which polls are right?  But they certainly point to a real contest of visions for America. Like to hear more about education.
Woe!  Pew Research has Romney up 4 points with likely voters. Wonder how big a sample.
@TheMurphstar Yes, but expensive!  Greatest experience for kids.
Look to new CEO to shake up NYT unless recalled to BBC to explain latest scandal.
Boring Sunday morning.  Practically nothing in NYT, predicable nearly unreadable Review section - even unintelligible Maureen Dowd.
So much for critics!   Taken2 took $50 million over weekend, more international.  Congratulations Fox team.
Instant polls show Romney just ahead in Ohio and Florida. But well within margin of error, and Obama will be different man next two debates
Edication2  US must give heavy push to higher STEM courses, or China, etc, will own the future. Also green cards to best foreign students.
Interesting skirmishes on education. Obama has done some good, but not enough. Pandering to all students with money wrong.
Surprise!  Romney better than strongest supporters hoped for.  Aced Obama.  All polls narrowed last few days. This may be turning point.
@charlesffenech polls on Fox agree with you.  Obviously you don't watch.  No big deal.
@bwdaly I think you are right.  People disappointed and tuned out on both sides.
Beverly  Hills, other burbs, very different to 2008 when smothered in Obama bumper stickers, now hard to find.
Thank you for all the nice comments and support for my mother.
@slone Agreed, but read it weeks ago.
@gilesbedford Thanks. Great son who makes me proud.
@tensixjages No way! That's my bet, but would be bad news for LNP.
Heading back to US after 2 weeks in Oz, largely just visiting 103 yo Mom after bad fall. Very depressing, but hoping and praying.
Hooray for Melbourne Storm, coach Craig Bellamy,  @cam_9_Smith and whole team for mighty win.  Also Sydney Swans for great footy result.
Stopped by the Melbourne Storm today to wish them good luck in the Grand Final on Sunday http://t.co/KG6wlLsa
Back in the beautiful land of Oz, especially Riverina. Dusk hike saw hundreds of kangaroos, two wombats, two foxes,two echidnas, great birds
As Clinton said, three million jobs available, no skilled to fill.  Three cheers for Rahm Emanuel standing up in Chicago.
Election: To win Romney must open big tent to sympathetic  families.  Stop fearing far right which has nowhere else to go. Otherwise no hope
Election: Romney must draw clear line: offer specific  path to restore American dream versus ugly Obama class war with jobs disappearing.
Retrospect; Conventions mixed but net big win for democrats. Michelle O and Clinton the big stars. Bill brilliant, Hillary away  until 016.
@MacDKB Saw months ago, but this is first public display.
@tonysantana786 None to either!
@Kercal Diane Von Furstenberg fashion show today.   Glasses will be very expensive, but wait for even greater improvements.
@klintberg You will be very under educated!
@masoodm3 Agree, Republicans should promise to abolish all tax deductions and loopholes.   Hurt some hard, but huge gains for great majority
Genius! Sergey Brin showing revolutionary new glasses at DVF, can take photos, receive texts, give directions, and more. Google Project X.
Overheard Dasha Zhukova’s @Garage_Magazine new online radio show. Quite a hilarious take on fashion. http://t.co/gJZJ1hdl
US jobs data terrible.   Add European slide, Brazil and Australian sharp slowdowns. Things look very shaky - and bad for Obama. Media agrees
Cameron's UK cabinet reshuffle first class and probably secures his position for full term.  Previous ditherer- in-chief looks better.
@SaraMarj Right.   Delighted public now as interested in Olympic heroes as scumbag celebrities.
Bernanke speech pretty disappointing, showing economy still very slow.  Now Brazil suddenly joining sick list.
Utterly brilliant speech by Paul Ryan. Leaders like him needed in many countries today.
Just saw 2016.  Truly scary if no answer.  Every voter should see and decide for self what future they want for America.
@quambafu Not necessarily.  Plenty of room for competition.
@ChrisFad Price matter of opinion, and hope and faith!
@CarenKhach Of course not.  Let everything be transparent - way to freedom.
@MarleneCarroll right on!
Facebook difficulty monetizing to justify market cap, especially with swing to mobile.
Apple giant deservedly, Google great and respected, but Amazon seen doing everything right.  All three very aggressive.
@jonbradburn Good one for Piers!
@JayGeraghty Very good question.  Not corrupted, but plain blind.
@Steve_Wiles No, by technology. Radio, television now Internet.  Long process, and you are only talking about print on paper.
@twwormald Maybe, in fact probably right. But branded news organizations with great journalism wii thrive on all digital devices.
@jonathanglick compare US and UK.
Simple equation:  free, open uncontrollable Internet versus   shackled newspapers equals no newspapers. Let's get real.
Only lesson for Prince Harry:  avoid playmates with cameras!
@johnprescott No contact with Neil Wallis. Decision as rightly that of the editor, and I support. I was in Silicon Valley far removed.
@SulphurCocky What about the telephone, the light bulb, mass production, the aeroplane, flight to the moon, etc?
@DaveMacMS big understatement!
Prince Harry.  Give him a break.  He may be on the public payroll one way or another, but the public loves him, even to enjoy Las Vegas.
James Garfield: a young man who has in himself the magnificent possibilities of life, it is not fitting  he should be permanently commanded.
@tracegilton Many very interesting, but not world changing.  Great things would come quickly in biotech if govt got out of the way.
Just returned after three days in Silicon V and San Fran.  Amazing sense of entrepreneurship but few new mind blowing innovations.
@sergiobichao Thanks!  Needed to demonstrate no such thing as free press in UK. Internet makes mockery of these issues. Ist amendment please
@JonathonMcNeil1 Who told you that nonsense?  Never!
@ryan_losasso Believe that and believe anything.
Tide  turning?  Romney must hit ball out of park next week. Great manager proven, now we must hear great vision for future. Must inspire.
@consequor have no idea what you are all talking about.  What Re you alleging?
@91ksjayhawk solution natural shale gas, of which we have enough for at least a century to make us totally energy independent. Huge finds.
@rantypete I hope not!
Top immigrants from everywhere the only answer to skill shortages in the short term. Then really shake up most colleges. Faculties hate idea
Only 4 per cent US graduates doing hard stuff - science, technology, engineering and maths - versus 31 per cent in China.	We HAVE to change.
Bad figures from Europe today, all going South!  Great example for US to avoid and great chance to attract best brains to this country.
Hope Romney sending Ryan everywhere full time.  Great convictions, sunny composure, fight without giving offence, all attractive to public.
Obama's love of wind farms plain crazy.  Uneconomic, inflationary, ugly, everything wrong and pure waste of taxpayer's money.
Great session with Bloomberg on immigration.  Agreed both parties too chicken to make obvious improvements, all good for economy and jobs.
Greatest news of decade: plentiful energy for century or more.  Gas means half carbon emissions and no need for ridiculous windmills.qads
@joshgreenman Misery, poverty,corruption in otherwise beautiful country.
Bravo Mexico.  Great victory over Brazil at Olympics.
Romney choice of Ryan looking better and better.  Romney re-energised and speaking better. Now we can choose between Greek and US dream.
@BouPierre   right! We should be welcoming all the best brains from anywhere, and most want to come. They also create jobs and wealth.
@MthulisiAM Right.  Also US worse.
@simonaharrison No.  Ask Cameron why six billion foreign aid ring fenced, including aid to bigger, richer countries like Brazil. Mad.
Thank God!    Now we might have a real election on the great issues of the day.  Paul Ryan almost perfect choice.
@TheMainstand Piers Morgan actually good guy, just boring as hell on CNN.
@choox75 Agreed. Olympics huge success for Britain.
Preparing for big immigration statement with Bloomberg on Monday. US policies crazy and truly damaging country, missing big opportunities.
@powellds you should see our wonderful Olympic covert in Italy and Australia
@GillieMojo agree, people want change most countries.  Screaming for leadership which not much in sight.
@choox75 I agree and certainly hope true.
@piersmorgan ok Piers, you set example first.
@Axelfinance Grow up. Chance meeting with Hunt in car park took all of thirty seconds. As for Boris, he's entertaining everyone!
RT @nickmackietv: @rupertmurdoch UK youth needs strong, never-give-up role models. This could be Britain's big pay-off from hosting 2012 ...
@awjones42 Agree. Coverage in UK terrific.	Wish we could say same in US.
@Cadoret  What chums? Blair got the Games but few remember now.
@Russtybee There are no media barons in the age of the Internet, unless you are thinking of Google.   And I'm not sure about that.
@rob__tucker I didn't say that.  Just spoke up for small neighbourhood, largely immigrant, struggling businesses.
@magapanthus You could twist anything.
Story about spelling! Tweet 30. Mins ago should read #"Romney , Obama some specifics to compare, please. Courage and honesty needed" .
NYT sounds reasonable, but effects horrible on smallest neighborhoods.  Why choose now to make things worse? Everybody has enough pressures.
Somebody needs to stand up to NYT which today editorialises strongly for absurd city council actions which will truly hurt small businesses
Reading The Quest, by Daniel Yergin. Brilliant, and great follow up to Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley.
Romney, Obama.  Some species to compare, please.  Courage and honesty needed.
Close examination US federal, state, city debts bad as Europe. Talk of cliff edge! Crash very possible, just when.
Long, long flight to LA read The Amateur (Bill Clinton's word) by Ed Klein.  Every voter should read.
British spirit shows nation transformable by strong, pragmatic no nonsense, non EU type govt. Any prospect? Miracle needed.
London Olympics great lift to UK. Low defeatist morale gone for now.  Can it last? Entire organization shows what can be done.
@yorkierosie  How does saving two newspapers and starting endless competitive tv channels dismantle democracy. Seriously?
@jimmy yes.  Tweet was awful, but not criminal.
@frankfletcher you are lucky.  Great.
@MichaelByrnes understood, I was generalising.
Police arrested at 330 am some kid for mild unpleasant tweet.   Thinking of asking for arrests of last 100 death threats on me!
Interesting today to see if any decent protests against Putin his phony trials of  dissenters. Russia  even less free speech  than here.
Sorry, it's Sebastian Coe, not Zeb!
No wonder China leading in medals while US and UK mainly teach competitive sport a bad thing. 	How many champions  state school background?1
Better enjoy Games while they last.  Hangover coming with bad economic outlook truly world- wide.
London in best shape ever.  All overboard about the Olympics, brilliantly organized by Zeb Coe and Boris Johnson.
UK and US press cooperated to exaggerate Romney off- tune gaffe, but no denying Mrs  Obama proved great ambassador, even with broccoli talk!
London Olympic opening surprisingly great, even if a little too politically correct.  Danny Boyle a creative genius.
Markets right about Amazon, I think. eCommerce  systems growing fast world wide. Big and small retailers in for very rough ride.
Great work in Aust by @heroeswalkaway. Death by drunken teenage punch ups too common.
@HillbillySkill So did Harry Evans for thalidomide scandal, Tele for MPs expense rackets. Toffs don't like free press for masses.
Who will speak up for honest underpaid Brit working families?  Tories, Lib-dems, Labour, even Church, all seem broken or breaking.
@basexperience Have every intention continue interest in your hypocritical political system even with likely little effect!
@InjusticeFacts Don't have 177 editors, maybe a dozen. And Iraq invasion right, later execution disastrous. Remember Saddam?
British ministers, others, admit paying cash for jobs. Seems black economy beats future cashless society. Maybe Square will cure.
@RevPaulCA forget empowerment of media owners.  No longer any barriers to entry.
@RevPaulCA destroying the print craft unions gave at least thirty more years life to free competitive newspapers.
@thebloke us of course, but could include uk, especially for fleeing French!
@nigelcameron we also believe in free speech.
Cavendish was explosive in the final sprint on the Champs-Élysées. Great lead into the Olympics. Will he take gold next?
Victory for @ Teamsky in Paris! Brad Wiggins first Brit to win and Froome takes second spot.proud moment for Sky and Britain.
Let's be positive.  For all our correct self-criticisms why does half the world want to come here?
@BassoonCPA who says I'm a conservative.  Have made most enemies by fighting for radical change in many areas. Eg class ridden UK.
@celebration1166 absolutely not. Way out of poverty is education.  Money not the problem.
Only way to restore American dream and have real meritocracy is fix terrible public K-12  education.   Amplify Education statement tomorrow.
@loopy tweets. We don't need AK47s to defend ourselves.  Nobody does.
Champagne on ice ready for tomorrow's finish of Tour de France.  Team Sky must be supermen, whatever result.
We have to do something about gun controls. Police license okay for hunting rifle or pistol for anyone without crim or pscho record. No more
Ed Milliband talking with Tony Blair. Progress?
Vincent Cable today declared considering leadership bid of Lib Dems.  Let's get the real deal.
Britain more an entitlement state. Bigger than ever with growing debts.  Is it too late to change culture and restore energy?
Wiggins and Froome still 1 and 2 in the Tour, but more work ahead tomorrow. Excitement building in Britain!  http://t.co/8tIYLnaa
Another great day for @TeamSky in the Tour de France. Big congrats to Mark Cavendish- what a finish for the win
Yesterday Obama went off script, showed real self ie government omnipotent, individuals secondary.  Must be big damage.
At last Romney attacks, looks better.  Keep it up! Still needs to address all Hispanics, 80 per cent Multi- cultural. Dole got 20, Bush 45.
Critical days in the Tour de France with riders in the Pyrenees, but @TeamSky doing phenomenal for Britain!
Nothing like brilliant women promoting their brilliance.  Several here in Idaho!
Bigger problem than Afghanistan is Pakistan - broken state with lots of nuclear bombs.  No- one knows future.
Watch Karzai step down next year, become Minister for mining - ie, following the money, Chinese support. Making us bigger fools.
What was wrong with Iraq war? Sad dam Hussein  evil major killer, etc.   Execution another matter..   Afghan bad every way now.l
Climate change very slow but real.  So far all cures worse than disease. Shale gas huge breakthrough for US. Half carbon of coal and oil.
Great session on cloud tech.  People underestimate effects of all tech advances on improving civilisation, general wealth, etc.
@martin_hickman anyone taking any notice of Andrew Neil on me is an idiot.  Neil treated bestof all ex-employes now shows true colors.
@HippiChickiNiki maybe Romney over confident after winning easy primaries. Should forget Mass. Governorship, this is the big one.h
@YourAnonNews not true. At least 140 papers are suburban frees with no politics.
Don't know, but suspect Diamond scapegoat used by old establishment who did not like energetic competitor.
Libor " scandal" very suspicious. 2008/9 huge crisis and Brown should defend pressure to keep rates down and prevent meltdown.
@djoddsox  2 nd chamber not democratic and should go.  Bigger issues right now. Millions our of work and struggling.
@katiek23  no, only when Thatcher fighting EU and pushing for meritocracy against terrible odds.
@daysontheroad  me too.
London. Half-baked Lords reform and MP revolt next week.  Govt preoccupation with meaningless stuff avoiding real,job creation reforms.
Romney people upset at me!  Of course I want him to win, save us from socialism, etc but should listen to good advice and get stuck in!
Do not forget July Fourth and remember to read the Declaration of Independence aloud.  At least once!
Thanks everyone for comments.  But it's Monday and time for work.  See you next weekend perhaps.
@Antibolt   No, James good friend who saw the light long time ago
@VietnamVeteran9   Are you serious.  Are these people really Scientologists?
@GeorgeHancks  Great idea.
@alansmurray   Right!  Yesterday's WSJ iPad app really great. New software, great graphics.
@UrquhartMP  Romney has all these and more, but just to see more fight.  And Hispanics a surrender to O.  Cn not afford, hurts senate too.
@scouserevo  Very aware, as countless apologies made clear.  After so many years, it's time for Kelvin and you to make peace.
@DrW_Qass   I try to be
Since Scientology tweet hundreds of attacks.  Expect they will increase and get worse and maybe threatening.   Still stick to my story.
@ROCKWITHBECK   Agreed, but it's his to lose if he doesn't get on the front foot soon
@shakirc  Mormonism a mystery to me, but Mormons certainly not evil.
@Ant_Meadows  Sure.  Kelvin wild, unpredictable but brilliant.  Good friend.
Watch Katie Holmes and Scientology story develop. Something creepy, maybe even evil, about these people.
@SettonIsaac Yes, but not the news.
@KevinGHaskell Thanks, agree about WSJ but can always get better. We're trying every day.  And I am not going anywhere!
@dr_henry77  my folks! Come off it, let's have serious discussion.
@sleepinwarrior Right. Dependency society rots aspiration, growth, energy, etc. look at Europe and much of Britain.
@teemunny  None!
@EspressoRepubli   Thank you, the door will always be open for him.
US election is referendum on Obama, all else pretty minor.
Met Romney last week.  Tough O Chicago pros will be hard to beat unless he drops old friends from team and hires some real pros. Doubtful.
@gramercypark many emerging, but Google twins, Jack Dorsey stand out. Look for next wave to be in biotech.
@DarraghOT  never best buds, not even one serious conversation.
@billymclean87 Gove nobody's stooge, just doing a brilliant job. No idea of his opinion on EU.
@jongold  no. Read them and see, that is, if you have half a mind.
Scientology back in news.  Very weird cult, but big, big money involved with Tom Cruise either number two or three in hiearchy.
Cameron again.   Missing last opportunity for devastating row with Lib Dems and winning single issue election! Govt weak bar 2 or 3 stars.
Cameron usual double talk about EU. "will consider referendum on membership after euro crisis cured" which will be never.
London again. 8 lively, different Sunday papers. Some great writing, some fun, some hysterical but happy change from boring Sunday NYT.
Tough week, but went better than I expected.
Easy for Romney to spell out restoration of the American dream and bash incompetent administration. But not a word!
When is Romney going to look like a challenger?   Seems to play everything safe, make no news except burn off Hispanics.
Understand lefties worried by Gina R. But is she, or any other single person, to be banned from buying  or starting a newspaper?  think anew
@der_herr_flick me, never.  All company returns fully audited by IRS.
@joelellisaus no interest, thanks.
@nlamba1977 what tax avoidance?
@Richotron who?  Certainly not me.  Everyone using these dodges and the Channel Islands should be stopped now.
@ProfessorRobo  seems right.  Have you read " The Amateur" be Ed Klein?   Amazing not to say highly alarming.
Hot morning in Croatia, much hotter evening in New York.   G-20 result as expected and as useless.  Outlook continues dangerously bad.
Croatia great.  Pula fantastic small city with beautifully preserved Roman ruins. Probably best preserved 2000 yo arena anywhere.
@PSbook @martin_hickman
@PSbook   Really?  Actually just reading his new book on London.  Writes like a dream.
Glorious sailing and very cold swimming in Croatia.  Big excitement tonite if they win Euro football.   Back to work in two days.
I stand by  every word is aid at Leveson.
Merkel standing very fir.  Good. Let's all take our medicine, however unpleasant, and start the long, hard rebuild of something better.
@Tuppy_G  read Major statement again!
Easiest first stage, Germany leave euro and have very strong mark.  no chance they agree, but big groundswell in Italy, Spain etc antiGerman
All world seems terrified by European crisis, nobody with a democratic solution.
Three day Newscorp board in Milan and Rome.  Sky still doing great in Italy and Germany.  Rome beautiful as ever, weekend in Venice!  Tired!

@newsmadman stories just interesting, not defensive.  But all Google data kept in cloud.
Privacy again! 15 y o kid just hacked Bank of America. Idle curiosity.  FBI visited, kid suspended from school for seven days.
Privacy!   Google just hacked millions of home computers in UK, presumably bank accounts, fotos etc while screening streets for Google maps.
Okay smarties! I'm off to Apple Store for instructions.
@ AngelicaUpstarta.   I didn't say that.
@ rathacat. Family agony awful, but caused by deleting voicemail and raising hope. NOTW wrongly accused of this by Guardian who corrected.
@Nouriel @TheEconomist
@kevingulliver  right. Now urgent job is to provide all with equal first class education, then outcome up to individuals.
@LloydxxForster  I don't know about success, but in UK have managed to smack some of the old establishments around a lot. Now payback time!
@ShantiAboobaker  nothing scandalous if done with police knowledge in searching for killer. Anyway, ask Piers Morgan.
Did White House leak highest security secret possible yesterday about cyber attacks on Iran?   If so, dangerous, maybe scandalous, game.
More WSJ:  "power comes from knowledge, information and experience".
Read WSJ's Review " Bionic Brains and Beyond". Amazing human progress continues regardless of serious bumps.
Back to LA today!   Another mess, beaches, parks being closed as counties run out of money.  School system disaster, 50 per cent drop out.
Majority of public never wanted Euro to be foisted on them by political class but nobody saw today's awful  but inevitable cost of collapse.
Why should Germans have to pay Greeks for laziness and cheating?  Now Spain in real pain, next comes shocks from France. More.
Warm congrats to Mark Zuckerberg.  Much happiness, but don't stop working!
Back from crazy California.  Cutting great universities and schools, building 10 Bn fast railway to nowhere.  Huge deficit can't fill.

@deborah KennyHVA  works tirelessly to provide students in Harlem with a great education. Check out her new book: http: http://t.co/d7n1YLDi
New subject!  Must read Bret Stephens. In today's WSJ on horrific results of most of our  "higher education". Pity impoverished parents.
RP again.  On the other hand, better if we had never built a pipeline in Saudi Arabia.
Lots of wisdom in RPaul, BUT would it be a better world if we had allowed Russia to have all of Europe, and China all of Asia and Indonesia?
Yes,too far.   But messy as hell to sort out and will never even be mentioned in an election year!
RP's isolationism too extreme for me. Complete withdrawal means next big power takes all.
POTUS seems to be allowing campaign advisors set national policy instead of listening to top professionals.  Unlike Bill Clinton or Bush.
@gadders probably agree, but there are limits.  But agree about Fed printing and likely coming crash.   Also sticking to Constitution.
Just reading new book on Ron Paul.  Fascinating.   Ron sure model of consistency, right or wrong.  Any tweeters wish to debate?
When?   Women voting is best thing in a hundred years.
@PhotogPhillip  So sell.
@newsfeedAU bull!  Opposition just inferior. Can't help if nobody buys them
One or two tweets on FCC okay, but hundreds identical Just phoney and abuses twitter.  By the way, what law?

@robdan54 right, people sick of promises. Toffs underestimate people every time.
Sorry, that was Greece!
More politics!  Two major parties total vote down from 75 percent to 36, with up to ten other parties qualifying for parliament!
So Hollande wins in France, promises "new   Europe".  We'll see. Meanwhile Le Pen prepares for leadership of Right. Not pretty prospect.
More UK. Conservatives won't be happy until promised referendum on EU.
Amazing Boris win overcoming 15 percent built in labour majority in London plus huge national swing against Tories.  Watch Cameron change.
@jonsnowC4. Absolutely right, goes for all tweeters too.
Tomorrow receiving Jewish Museum Heritage Award.  Busy preparing short speech, mainly about Israel.
@ajit8.  I don't monopolise anything but see your point about Twitter.  my complaint was about language.
Digital revenue down at Washington Post and NYT.    Up strongly at  WSJ.  What gives?
@Janiete.  See next day's Sun.  No offense taken by Woy. See football grounds. Get a life.
Anyone thinking about yesterday's terrible jobs number in US and tomorrow's French election? Italian Monti's call for growth real leadership
Looking at Arianna H self portrait.  Aren't we all evangelists?  If we don't propagate our beliefs why bother thinking?
@bkay27. Thanks
@myEnlightenment. Not worth time, sorry.
Seems impossible to have civilised debate on twitter.  Ignorant,vicious abuse lowers whole society, maybe shows real social decay.

Governments worldwide have borrowed 100 trillion last ten years. Defaults inevitable sometime soon.  Means crash, hurting rich and poor.
Of course markets stay high with central banks printing huge sums, inflating everything except jobs.
@navonpilot first let's just have two rates, 25 and 10 percent and eliminate ALL deductions.
@BonkBowl absolutely.  Rights must be matched with personal responsibility.
@Thefinnigans try Wall Street Journal.  News totally separate from opinion pages. Best written too.
@Spitfire1592 right on!
@popdeath news international no loopholes.  Not much profit to pay on.
Social fabric means all.  Must wake up before coming apart more.  That includes closing tax loopholes for rich people and companies.
I meant state of public education, especially in US.  Of course it should be free, but way better, like, say Singapore.
Europe needs growth strategies as well as scrapping entitlement culture.  Very hard with euro choking everything.
Public education real threat to social fabric, but great inventions continue.  Change coming everywhere next five to ten years.
Re-reading Rational Optimist. All should. Western world's psych needs turnaround and encouragement. Plenty to celebrate.
Friday horribly GDP numbers, yet market up.  Must be expecting Fed returning to the printing presses.    Hope not right.
Europe sliding into recession. Imminent French election with people reluctant to make choice, unhappy with status quo, frightened of change.

European crisis gets lot worse.  What now with the ten billion pounds from hard-up Britain?   Just digging bigger hole.

Elections are when you have to make a choice.   Perfection not often attainable!
@markhughes newspapers not so rich, in fact all struggling, getting overpriced as classified now on web, Amazon hurting big stores, etc.
Tweeters who don't like particular newspapers don't have to buy them. Thousands of crappy blogs available.
Economic problems made by waves of politicians making impossible promises.  Now the bills are arriving .
@saggiori thanks. Job completed already.
@blessmyliberty    No bias for Romney, but with friend Santorum out better be realistic.  Hope he takes good vp.
Don't hate Britain, quite the reverse.  But whole of Europe and US facing huge financial and social problems
Good debate on land of hope and glory tweet
What happened to "land of hope and glory" 	New poll today shows 48 percent of Brits would like to emigrate.
Sarkosy says Britain in worse shape than France.  Little or no industry, too dependent on banks, etc. Lot of truth here.
Must see great biopic, The Lady, biopic of Aung San suu kyi, the famous Burmese activist.
Now we on cusp of new wave of tech transformations  to beat last century growth.  Big data,smart manufacturing and wireless. Exciting !
Economists state Americans in real terms grew 700 per cent in last 100 years by tech inventions - electricity, cars, stainless steel etc.
NY Central Park never looked so beautiful.Full spring blooms everywhere.  Enjoying walks.  City Hall and volunteers should be congratulated.
Titanic again.  First night China $11.3m according China Film daily b.o.report v. U.S $7.1m.
Great opening for Titanic in 3D.  First time ever China box office than US.  New markets fast expanding for US films.
Obama seems to agree with consensus view obamacare going down.   Bullying supremes silly. People trust judges over politicians any time.
Big fight in UK over privacy.   Right to be concerned , but too late with tech data collection unstoppable.
Reading v interesting book on health and weight loss @KathyFreston cites good science Makes sense and seems ez	Http:// http://t.co/X15awj0i
Proof you can't trust anything in Australian Fairfax papers, unless you are just another crazy.
Let's have it on!  Choice, freedom of thought and markets, individual personal responsibility
Enemies many different agendas, but worst old toffs and right wingers who still want last century's status quo with their monoplies.
Seems every competitor and enemy piling on with lies and libels.  So bad, easy to hit back hard, which preparing.
Without trust, democracy, and order will go.
Of course there must be a full independent inquiry on both sides.   In great detail, and with consequences.  Trust must be established.
Cameron should have just followed history and flogged some seats in the Lords, if they still have value!  precedents  of  centuries .
Great Sunday Times scoop.   What was Cameron thinking?   No-one, rightly or wrongly, will believe his story.
Back in LA.   Cold  after warm London and NY.
Queensland , Oz, wipes out Labour govt.  must scare Feds.  Well deserved.
Another Russian shot down in London. Wonder what exKGB boss Lebedev could tell his paper Independent?
Happy Birthday Twitter! remarkable company that's helped change the news biz and the world. Congrats to @jack and all friends at Twitter.
Ignore stories on MSC operating under 2  ex US A Gs exactlyas I promised Parliament. Many great journos naturally unhappy. Hope time heals.
Can't wait to start reading Niall Ferguson's new book, Civilization, The West and the Rest.   Bet lots to think about.
Sun on Sunday improving every week.  See tomorrow's article by Yvette Cooper.   Should stir the pot!  Another big paper for 50p.
Wow! Qatar, Ankara, London and NY all in one week.   All fascinating in their own ways.   More later.
What will second Sunday edition of Sun sell?   My guess down fifteen per cent would be a great result.
Great few hours in Berlin.  Papers much to teach us.  Just showed what popular papers can do for public, getting rid of corrupted president.
Now they are complaining about R Brooks saving an old horse from the glue factory!
Visiting Scottish offices.   Great people, great products.  Also BSKYB employs about 6000 people here.  How do they all survive long winter?
Amazing!  The Sun confirmed sale of 3.260,000 copies yesterday.  Thanks all readers and advertisers.  Sorry if sold out - more next time.
Reports early, but new Sun edition sold 3m!
New British proposal.  Only immigrants earning 35000 allowed in.  After tax equal to  many people living on welfare maybe not seeking work.
More strange Britain.  D. Telegraph two days huge anti sex abortion headlines.   Now pushing gay marriage line. Old readers must be confused
Britain strange.  Month ago Cameron anti-business every chance, now equally pro-business.   On the road to Ed Milliband!
New Sunday edition nearly ready.   Fantastic achievement by great staff.  Many thanks.
The Sun:  great speculation, sweeps, etc on Sunday's sale.    I will be very happy at anything substantially over two million!
Oz Labor tearing themselves to pieces.  Ugly sight.  Tony Abbott should just lie low and watch.
@dafta420   Agreed.
Don't know how many meals with Gove, but not enough.    Admirable character, great work.   Education way out of mess, but takes long time.
More good Sun news.   We're completely sold out for advertising!
Regular Sunday price for The Sun only 50p....and Saturday's Sun going down to 50p too!    Great news for readers and the economy.
London Sun. Great staff tired but excited for Sunday edition.  Yougov poll shows 90pc awareness already.  Big announcements start tomorrow.
Britain can't finance NATO, and no- one else willing, including Obama. No threat from weak Russia, maybe others later who not broke.
From distance, Santorum doing great.   Values really do count in America, and not sneered at as in parts of Europe. Win Michigan game over.
Let Scotland go and compete.  Everyone would win.
What's this nonsense about British nuclear subs?  Who are  they going to nuke? Argentina, come off it. Dreams of empire should die.
Just for the record: Newscorp shares up 60c on news of Sun on Sunday.  Highest for year.
Miracles  do happen!    Sun shining in London.
Alex Salmond clearly most brilliant politician  in U.K.   Gave Cameron back of his hand this week.    Loved by Scots.
Thanks to all who sent congrats on mother's 103 rd bray.    Long way to go,I hope!
@rupertmurdoch
To hell with politicians! When are we going to find some to tell the truth in any country?	Don't hold your breath.
Santorum"Romney looks like well oiled weather vane".  Plenty of company, but not POTUS.
POTUS seems in deep trouble with all religious groups.  "worship" not the same thing as religion.
@Zindiq  of course not, but best hand up is great free education.  Come to Harlem and see charter schools and sub-poverty kids shining.
People need a hand up, nota hand out. All policy direction should be to empower individuals to run their own lives.
@CharlieHussain     Who?
Bill Clinton did well with "work for welfare".
Disagree with most of my friends, but not too troubled.   See both sides.
Yes,but we have to be sure of what we put in place.    Time ahead very, very tough and dangerous for all Americans.Nobody perfect.
@kofilee yes, but only answer is huge upgrade in public education and skills training.
Clint Eastwood's great line "second half" just beginning okay, but second half not always winning half!  Big dangers ahead, no pols admit.
OWS and Tea Party share motivation: open and real equal opportunity.  Neither should be dismissed or abused.
Wefare state great if real safety net and not so big to provide alternative life style.
Please keep tweeting.  I read all but how about cleaning up language?  Incidentally most credit me with non- existent power and money.
@Gaynor_Juice   	America thirty or forty years ago.
@friendlydugong no, both are culpable
Take your pick!  Lower big salaries, lower all taxes, lower govt payouts, encourage self reliance and thereby real happiness.
Closing the divide, returning to classless society. Not money but charities, churches, community organizations, big and small, scouts, etc.
Yes. Exceptionalism. Sorry!
Exceptalism or decline.   That is the choice. Maybe too late but can we gather forces to return social cohesion?   Close the divide.
Re-reading Charles Murray.  Profound.  Can Santorum lead moral regeneration and restoration of original American dream?	Tall order!
KRudd been promising imminent knifing for months.  Believe it when we see it.
I have nothing to do with Sky News.
Just starting on much acclaimed "The Genius in All of Us" by David Shenk.   Hard to reconcile with all these tweets, including mine!
Great game.  Great for New York, but feel little sorry for many Boston friends.
Enough!  Time to prepare for great Super Bowl.... New York seems silent today in anticipation.   Go Giants!
On M.E., Obama clearly preparing navy to keep oil supply lines open.   Hope not necessary, but good to be ready for any eventualities.
Yes, Gordon Brown deserves much credit on euro.
Economic matters interesting, but shouldn't we be preparing for likely Israeli hit on Iran very soon and unknown consequences?
If Britain had joined euro it would be in even deeper doodoo than already.  Cheap pound compared to year ago only thing keeping state going.
Euro can only work if whole euro zone becomes German, which ever-increasing productivity.   Surely impossible, may yet take years to bust.
Re growing class division / consequences.	D Brooks (NYT) advocates compulsory national service. Libertarian Charles Murray horrified.
What did I give?   Years of argument against the euro.
Only ever met PMs when asked, believe it or not.  And NEVER asked for anything.  That is, I never asked for anything!
With Internet no such thing as monopoly media. Ask Zuckerberg.
Gillard once good education minister, now prisoner of minority greenies.  Rudd still delusional who nobody could work with. Nobody else?
Don't understand Aussie politics.  Can Kevin Rudd really come back and knife Gillard?    Weird place mucking up great future.
Romney has plenty of brains, but want to see heart and stomach.
Ignore Thomson Reuters.  Thomsons chickened out of GB decades ago,except for oil money. Now control Reuters and  no idea what bias they push
What does POTUS think he's doing upsetting and energizing 77 million Catholics.   Ideology on show.  If Romney has  brains, this is a killer
Two amazing Internet events this week: Facebook flotation and the power of digital movements.
All eyes today on Facebook and sweeping statements.    But note really interesting moves by Google.   Things are buzzing.
FT editor boasts about 'revenge'. Imagine Richard Lambert or Geoff Owen engaging in such bias.
Charles Murray's big new study getting great attention.  COMING APART.  Class divide, not class war.  Strongly recommend.
Welcome tonight to new dean of Weill Cornell Medical College.Great plans for research many areas.
F.T.  Financial Times or Fawlty Towers? 	Sun on Sunday story today 100 per cent wrong.
Unemployment:  US official figures greatly underestimate real situation plus millions with part time jobs.
Wrong, sorry.   25 per cent unemployment,	48 youth.
Spanish unemployment 48 per cent, youth 25.  Sounds more like depression and socially dangerous.
Davos returnes seem unanimous no crash likely, just long recession, very bad in some places
Curious, interested great issues, ensuring alternative voices. Lucky with six great kids and wonderful, busy wife.
@SurfingPunter	Of course!
Nothing wrong with MySpace  price.  Just our totally screwing up every way.  Agree Facebook revenues will zoom, but still      Apple cheap.
Agree about scandal of prison population.  Much of it duets terrible state laws.
Facebook a brilliant achievement, but $75-100bn?  Would make Apple look really cheap.
Back in the land of the free.   First sight of blue sky in ten days.  NY beautiful.
Relax.  Never a buyer!
Absolutely pay full income taxes plus NY state plus NY city!  No joy, but no dodges.
Happy to celebrate Australia Day!
In Zurich with the big chiefs of soccer. Amazing organization with power over most of the world's football.    Now back to family and work.
In Munich for a few hours.  sky d exciting and very young.  But Munich beer best in world!
Romney's tax returns might kill his chances.  See Republican establishment panic now!
Celebrating Oscar nominations!  Both Descendants and Tree of Life.  Great year for Fox Searchlight.  Excuse the plug!
Why can't we have sensible tweets.  You're mainly just crazy and fun to read.  No loss of sleep here.
Tax defrauder?  Who?
No excuses for phone hacking. No argument.  No excuses either for copyright stealing, but plenty of ignorant argument!
Just read Religion for Atheists.  Great writing, thoughtful, disturbing.. Highly recommend.
Copyright piracy.  Everyone now agrees is stealing and wrong.   So why all the hysteria?  Why not discuss and settle on cure?
Mega loads!    One week earlier and things would be different.   Even some solons may have recovered their courage.
Carried interest tax racket.  Billions over many years.   Why and where has Obama been?
On SOPA, where are all big film stars with many millions to lose?
Romney tax uses long-term legal loophole. "carried interest" makes all fund managers rich.  Time both parties stopped selling  out to Wall S
Don't care about people not buying movies, programs or newspapers, just stealing them.
AFL-CIO supporting SOPA!
When will Romney get a manager to prepare him?   Fancy not being ready for questions about taxes or felons! Damaging.
Seems blogosphere has succeeded in terrorizing many senators and congressmen  who previously committed.  Politicians all the same.
Nonsense argument about danger to Internet.  How about Google, others blocking porn, hate speech, etc?  Internet hurt?
Big bipartisan majorities both houses sold out by POTUS for search engines.  How about 2.2 m workers in entertainment industry? Piracy rules
Gloom!  Seems all economists predict long, major recession mostly Europe. Few ideas to change course.  Poor will be hurt most. Greece worst.
Yes, thanks, of course I meant POTUS.  Somehow iPad changed my spelling. I should have checked. Sorry.
Just for the record, cinemas average well over half ticket money.
More pirates.  Whole entertainment ind employs 2.2 million ave salary 65 g. Good jobs and expanding foreign earnings. Made in America, too!
Seems like universal anger with Optus from all sorts of normal supporters.  Maybe backing pirates a rare miscalculation by friend Axelrod.
Golden Globes great night for whole creative tam at Fox.  Congrats!  Best pic Descendants, best tv show Modern Family and many other wins.
Agree about cinema prices which out of our control - but even more offensive are prices for popcorn and sodas.
The Fed is lending zillions all over the world at cheaper rates than Americans can get.  Work that out.
Sure misunderstand many things, but not plain stealing. Incidentally google blocks many other undesirable things.
Just been to google search for mission impossible. Wow, several sites offering free links.  I rest my case.
Understand more than all allege!  Google great company doing many exciting things. Only one complaint, and it's important.
Film making risky as hell. This has to lead to less, hurting writers, actors, all concerned.
Piracy leader is Google who streams movies free, sells advts around them.  No wonder pouring millions into lobbying.
So Obama has thrown in his lot withSilicon Valley paymasters who threaten all  software creators with piracy, plain thievery.	 -
Thanks AFI for three great awards to Fox - Tree of Life, Descendants and Modern Family.    Good to be back in LA and home.	.
Why is every tweet thought to conspiratorial or sexual. I was talking blackjack.  Give me a break.
Normally disapprove of casinos,but hitting 16s and 17s lot of fun.  To hell with theories!
Calling Cuomo chicken only related to teacher evaluation. He has 70 per cent approval, so let's see him use it for education.
Art market ablaze. See WSJ today on China, and eleven simultaneous Damien Hirst shows in Gargosian galleries. Flight from cash?
Last day here.  Most top Newscorp execs will huddle to review their own digital efforts and plan forward.
CES wrapping up. All talk is about coming Apple tv.   Plenty of apprehension, no firm facts but eyes on their enormous cash pile.
Many questions and jokes about My Space.simple answer -  we screwed up in every way possible, learned lots of valuable expensive lessons.
CES again.  Big three,Apple,Google and Amazon, and maybe Facebook dominant now and growing.  Plenty of others good, but not in same league.
CES coming to a close.  Seems like more innovation than ever, some great, all disruptive.  Traditional coys  feeling digital tornado
Bloomberg's bold teacher proposals today terrific.   How will chicken Cuomo respond? If UFT refuses this money good teachers will scream.
Jack. Tokyo sounds great but be careful of that full moon
Can't blame Newt G too much.  He was carpet bombed with negatives by Romney. Brilliant, visionary but just too much baggage!  And erratic.
Re education. Equality of opportunity IS possible.  Country must fix K-12 everywhere. Politicians need disconnect from rich teacher unions.
LasVegas showing amazing new gizmos, but real deals off show floor.  Google 		extremely active.  Much better company under Larry Page
Big win for Romney, now strong favorite. Owes a lot to Christie who energized R with great effect. Transformed R into real campaigner
For those interested in art try beautiful new site http://t.co/JiOXkkmS
@rupertmurdoch Merkel the boss and wrong.  Euro always a huge mistake, but free trade EU okay without one currency.
Education only way to real equality. US a disgrace. Millions every year headed for underclass or worse.   Half kids drop out  in LA , others
George Soros @WSJ.com predicting awful deflation and trouble nearly everywhere. He knows  this stuff.  Let's see if he is right again.
So Bill Daley has followed Rahm, as reported in the Journal few weeks ago ( and  denied).   What's going on, premature electioneering?
Re complaints about my spelling!    Problem is my pathetic typing.  Sorry, if anyone really cares.
Second thoughts! Content does remain king, but new tech will help improve much, especially education.
Obama out to lunch!  90 per cent right on great issues of education and immigration. Bipartisan support mostly there. Why no leadership?
Santorum right.  America a big, good society capable of anything.  Not libertarian!
Consumer electronic show this week. Expect to see amazing new tech developments like last year.  Will upend, improve delivery, not content
Ron Paul	 Good point on racism, as well as great put down to snotty Stephanopolous.  Sorry if spelling wrong!
New Hampshire primary will be interesting.  Will either Huntsman or Santorum get any traction?  Say, over 15 percent of total?
Achtung Angela! I'm now following you on@WSJDeutschland.  Check it out at www./wsj.de. Best German website.
Just visited ASPCA.   Young daughters looking for another dog to adopt!  Help!
American economy looking better. At least short term. Meanwhile Europe looks slow motion train wreck.   Hope I'm wrong.
International Court of Justice.  Will never succeed. See today's Journal book reviews.
Big reversal.  NY weather beautiful and almost warn.  Non sign of snow yet.
Read today's NYT on research proving good teachers make huge differences in graduate's earnings,early pregnancies, etc. http://t.co/kySAvJYI
Our readers in NY are fantastic.  Over two million dollars in few days for orphans of shot hero cop.  Thanks everyone!
NY gov Cuomo said to be planning big metropolitan casino development.  Surely this is big time regressive taxation.
Think!  Three richest Americans are three greatest philanthropists - Bloomberg, Gates and Buffett?
Can understand OCW resentment of extreme inequalities, but how about  fund managers only paying cap gains tax without risking a penny?
Paul too  extreme, but right to draw attention toFed.   Printing zillions can only cause inflation - the coward's way out of this mess.
Well, well!   Values DO count. Santorum result pretty amazing.   Policy very similar to Reagan.  Now start to sound like him.
Check out this great article: READ THE ARTICLE:CARDINAL RULE: St. Louis topples Texas to win 11th World S... http://t.co/mbDqzFcx via @daily

@andrew bolt
While Obama feeling courageous, why not follow his first class education policy. US' absolute biggest crisis. No read, no write, no jobs.
Can't resist this tweet, but all Iowans think about Rick Santorum.  Only candidate with genuine big vision for country.
Got to watch Foxnews at 5 EST. Liberal Bob Beckel and team great replacement for Beck and much more fun.
Obama decision on terrorist detention very courageous - and dead right! @
NY cold and empty, even central park. Nice!
Great to see Mike Bloomberg getting some rewards for being New York's best mayor in memory!
@Plaid_Page   Maybe soon, but I'm getting killed for fooling around here and friends frightened what I may really say!
@jack  you are right and we try all the time. But wait till you have53000 people across sixty countries with different laws,etc.
@jack right on  "simplify" but easier in startups. My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!
Great to see alexsalmond Briton of the year. Fellow antiestablishmentarian's Econmist piece equal very good and bs!
Back to work tomorrow.  Enough idling!
Good to see santorum surging in Iowa. Regardless of policies, all debates showed principles, consistency and humility like no other.
I LOVE the film "we bought a zoo", a great family movie. Very proud of fox team who made this great film.
Happy 2012. May itbe better than all experts predict.  Has to be!   Must change everything to create jobs for all, especiallyyoung
Saw Fox film Descendants.  Thank God, one to be proud of. Star Geo Clooney deserves Oscar, maybe film too.
Amazing!   Alexander Hamilton born (illegitimate) 40 miles away. Best man never elected president. At least, founded NY Post!
Vacations great time for thinking. St Barth's too many people. Thoughts best kept private around here. Like London!
Great oped inWSJ today on Ron Paul. Huge appeal of libertarian message.
Great time in sea with young daughters, uboating.
Steve Jobs biog interesting but unfair. Family must hate.
Have just. Read The Rational Optimist. Great book.
