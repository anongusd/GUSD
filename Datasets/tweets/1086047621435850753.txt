America is a great country, but we must still deal with the facts. Racism, exploitation, sexism, ignorance still run rampant. The tactics have changed, but these evils are still very much present. Human trafficking would not happen if it not approved of. We have to change.
The best thing Americans can do is be true to themselves and spread peace coupled with love. We have been infected with hate, mistreatment, and disrespect at the highest levels. It's time for our healing. No one has the right to violate anyone for any reason. It's wrong.
You must be careful of how you treat people. Just because you are up today, does not mean that will be the case tomorrow. Unforgiveness, spite, hate, envy, jealousy all make you really ugly or sick with diverse health issues.
My observation is that trump likes to be the only one allowed to dish it and not receive any recompense for his actions. He has always had servants or staff who had to put up with the idiotic statements he made because they needed their jobs. He looks at Americans the same way. https://t.co/CEtd0DyWvK

Sex trafficking is the systematic abuse of children stolen from their homes. They are transported through various parts of the country. They are beaten, raped, molested, and sodomized. They are then handed over to "clients" to be further tortured and turned out. Drugs and alcohol

@MnnMcG @thehill I know it's not conditional, but my point is, they are not fulfilling the requirements of the position that they took oath to uphold on our behalf. They enacted legislation that is against the interests of the people. We have authority and nees to exercise it.

@senatemajldr Mr. McConnell, get his tail out of office immediately. He has made a mockery of this country and y'all dragging your damn feet. America needs strong faithful leadership.
I am an advocate for the people od this country to be treated right. Our leadership has failed us as the citizens. We can no longer afford to sit back and leave our welfare to others. People wake up and secure your own. 	# Country at sleep.
@realDonaldTrump Are you sending your wives out of the country because they were immigrants? As well as your children? They shouldn't receive any benefits from this country either. If immigration applies to one it applies to all.
Who is really protecting America?	We are no longer the land of the brave and home of the free. We are everything we criticized other countries for being. No fear of God. No respect for his rules.
What's going on with all the children who are missing and kidnapped in the country? Where is the remedy for that? They have not dried up the sex trade and human trafficking.
Trump is securing the borders, but what about the ones already here? Have you evicted or prosecuted them yet?
