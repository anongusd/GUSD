@tedlieu you.
What's wrong with a 3-party electoral system?  Not sure, but Democrats and Republicans are making sure it will happen.  I'm okay with that.

@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi I guess that's about all you have to be proud of.
@WalshFreedom They wanted to believe so badly that they latch on to anything to end their nightmare.   Why is that so hard to understand.  Come on, they wear it on their sleeve and as a badge of honor.  They want to overthrow the one who threatens their establishment,  dems and reps.
@WalshFreedom The fish was rotting from the head down.
@WalshFreedom They wanted to believe it was true.  Was the "evidence" real?  Sounds like it was what's her names "opposition research" to me.
@WalshFreedom Yup.  Exactly.  How many times has this happened in the past 2 years?  Journalists where?
@BuzzPatterson Yes, I'm afraid she is that ignorant.

@RepAdamSchiff You sir, are wrong.  You don't like a wall because you know it will work to keep your new dem voters away.  You should pay attention to how many Hispanic people support Mr Trump on this issue.  Are you really as stupid as you seem?  You must be a real moron.
@WalshFreedom So they attacked us AGAIN.  What is actually being done to keep it from happening again?  NOTHING!  You don't really believe that this was the first time, do you?
@WalshFreedom They're desperate for ANY WAY to get him out. Really, you don't know that?  I don't even follow these idiots and I can see that hate is driving their behavior.  Are you as stupid as you just sounded?
@PattyMurray From one of your constituents, you're an idiot.  Where were your "abuse of power" comments with the former president when he implemented DACA?  Allow IRS to target conservative orgs? Allowed FBI to spy on the opposition party in an election.  You're pethetic.
@PattyMurray It's too bad that you really don't care about working Americans.   We know you really don't care.
@tribelaw I'm sure glad we're finally prosecuting for lying to the FBI and Congress.  I think I know a few others that can be indicted now.  Whew, can't wait until those idipts are locked up, too.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @ElizabethBotros @SecretService From Taxxachusetts!  Who would have guessed?  Another Bernie nut job or was it a what's her name nut job?
@polishprincessh By definition, @SenSchumer is a racist as his only basis is race. In the name of 'diversity' does not excuse you from being a racist chucky freak.
Failure at all levels of government but clearly, nut case Cruz should not have had a gun. Any other Sheriff's office would have arrested him for domestic disturbance when he was violent towards his mom on one of those dozen calls. Domestic violence offenders can't buy guns. Done.
@billmaher @realKDilan Controversies like Trump collusion with Russia?

@NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @WhipHoyer @Clyburn I'm all for immigration, legal immigration.  While its not the biggest problem in America, I'm fine with dreamers getting a legal status.  But the flow of illegal immigrants has to stop, too.  Otherwise, don't we just keep generating more of the same problem we have right now?
