@TheGoodGodAbove Well you did create them in your image didn't you?
@Slate Oh no, I can't wait to watch it, right after I shoot a nail gun into my eyes.
@AOC As there are valid and legitimate reasons to scold the mainstream media, chief among which include their adherence to the corporate oligarchy.
@AendarusMapping Religious freedom should apply to people 18+ as they decide to practice it unto themselves and no one else, least of all anyone considered a minor.
@YOUNGZOLOFT Lately, Charlie Pride's "Is anybody going to San Antonio?"
@EmmaVigeland And to think he was almost our V.P.
@the_bernie_bro Gabbard/Ojeda 2020, if Bernie decides not to run.
@KFILE @surfbordt Why not Instagram his whole hearted endorsement of single payer?
@bmcchgo @bohemiantoo @the_bernie_bro @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats Listen, Ostrich Boy with his head in the sand, credit was given, to DJT's record breaking unpopularity.
@KeytoInk @the_bernie_bro @RedBeretsM4All I'll believe that when Fuddruckers is renamed Buttfuckers... Otherwise I agree.
@the_bernie_bro And as Ron Placone brilliantly said: "There is nothing pragmatic about an incremental solution to a catastrophic problem."
Thank you for helping me reach 100 followers! I literally couldn’t have done it without you.
@TomCarroll4639 @Bryn_Apprill Much like our President, only cute and desirable.
@iSwampDweller --exists for a reason.
@iSwampDweller One of the reasons I've been told was that I need to "stay in my lane." This hasn't happened to me on Twitter (yet,) only on Facebook, nevertheless, my response is this: "An A-B conversation is only an A-B conversation when C-Z can't see it and/or hear it." Private Messaging --
@SilERabbit @jimmy_dore BetNO! 2020
@ComicBookFinder A collectible vintage piece of Ameri-centric propaganda, Yee haw!
@TheVeryBestBlog @PatTheBerner We'll likely be dead anyway by 2031, so what the fuck?
@ProgressiveJoe_ @the_bernie_bro Well Trump's a loser for sure.
@the_bernie_bro @Michell90013145 ---If/when they screw him over again. Shit or get off the pot Bernie! Either run as a third party, or throw your weight and support behind someone who will!!
@the_bernie_bro @Michell90013145 I think another choice that would dovetail with policy would be ideology, which is the bellweather I'll be using when choosing a candidate, it will likely be Sanders, but it could be the Green candidate if Bernie continues to gaslight for a corrupt political party---
@TheVeryBestBlog @PatTheBerner How they'll find out in the primaries of 2020 and election day of 2020.
@jamie_roche @JackLeeRoberts But they won't, aggrandizement and party over sacrifice and principle.
@astockeyWTAE Barring Sanders, likely Gabbard, maybe maybe Warren, and possibly Ojeda, I predict it will be dull and boring while brimming with neoliberal rhetoric.
@business I can't wait to see how bad it gets after Christmas and New Year's...
@TheMidCity @LadyReverb @jonallendc @aseitzwald What’s the opposite of a purist? I'm guessing a contaminist?
@Sportsfeeder1 @CNN And of course... Wealthfare.
@VanDykeMarx @surfbordt One of the, if not THE BEST, backhanded compliment I've ever read ;) BetNO! 2020
@surfbordt ;)
@surfbordt How could you subject your furbaby to such torture as to let it endure the nonsense of the sHill and BetNO bots?
