@KamalaHarris GOP has no soul. Thank you for fighting!
@SenateMajLdr #GOP=liars. You're the absolute worst.
@AlbertBreer @wyche89 Haley is bad w/situational football. Ben has worst playoff record under Haley than other OC‚Äôs. He makes bad decisions in crucial moments. He needed to be let go.
@wyche89 @MikeSilver @KimJonesSports @judybattista your segment on Big Ben and Haley is wrong. Yes, he put up good #‚Äôs, but was not retained because of situational football. Ben‚Äôs playoff record under Haley is 3-4, w/Arians 5-3, w/Wizz 5-1. He needed to be let go. Not placating.
@SpeakerRyan #NOBillNOBreak. DO SOMETHING!
