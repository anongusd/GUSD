The Trump administration came to the #HanoiSummit with no preparation, no plan, no coordination with partners‚Äîand, unsurprisingly, came away with no deal. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/p17urrzw8a
Amid all the #HanoiSummit pageantry, let's remember who Kim Jong-Un is: the totalitarian leader of one of the world's most brutal dictatorships, a rogue regime that starves and enslaves its own people. This is a time for clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy‚Äînot love letters.
The near-term focus should be on realistic ways to reduce the threat from North Korea‚Äîand any agreements must be subject to Congressional oversight. We can't trust Trump to negotiate, without checks and balances, another backroom deal with an American adversary. #HanoiSummit https://t.co/z5wHHE2sKz
This isn't a binary choice between Trump's politics-first brand of reality show diplomacy or a rush to war. Rather than war, the real alternative is a coordinated long-term campaign carried out in lockstep with our allies and partners. #HanoiSummit
There's a better path: an alternative to Trump-Kim photo-ops that's based on strong, smart, principled diplomacy. That means insisting that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù as long we face a threat from North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programs. #HanoiSummit https://t.co/VxZlFFhsdG
Trump consistently puts politics before policy, and his approach to North Korea‚Äîshowy summits over sustained diplomacy‚Äîhas been no different. He seems to view this week's #HanoiSummit not as an opportunity for serious negotiations but as a headline-grabbing sequel to Singapore.

There's a better approach, one that uses our leverage strategically to pressure Maduro and support Venezuela‚Äôs democratic movement. There are also immediate steps to support the Venezuelan people, including through aid and by extending TPS for Venezuelans.
Maduro is illegitimate, but, by recognizing opposition leader Juan Guiado without proper planning, the Trump administration has exposed our diplomats and other Americans in Venezuela to unnecessary risk, leaving them in the middle of a situation that could escalate quickly.
We must stand in support of the Venezuelan people as they demand the right to select their leaders democratically‚Äîa right Maduro trampled with illegitimate elections last year. But Trump‚Äôs insufficient planning and bluster have again walked us into the middle of a crisis.

As Trump continues to sidestep Saudi Arabia‚Äôs role in the disappearance of journalist‚Äî&amp; US resident‚ÄîJamal Khashoggi, let's remember that we still don't know the extent of Trump's conflicts of interest with Saudi Arabia...only that he advances Saudi interests every chance he gets. https://t.co/tx08HZWjCV

As last week's @nytimes investigation showed, Trump's real estate "empire" was built on tax evasion and fraud‚Äîbut it's worth remembering there's a lot we still don't know about the ways Trump's corrupt business practices have potentially influenced his decisions as President.
Since Trump took office, we've seen a decline in respect for the U.S. around the world‚Äîwhich impacts our security and our interests.		@jeffreyprescott breaks down a few of the ways Trump's approach to foreign policy has damaged America's global standing: https://t.co/G3V9qAMoQa https://t.co/wZX7aJi0Wj
Indeed, we must make sure everything we ask of our troops is worthy of their sacrifice. Trump‚Äôs approach, which also includes alienating our NATO allies that continue to partner with us in Afghanistan, does not meet that test.
It‚Äôs not worthy of our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, whom Trump has yet to visit, that we have entered our 18th year of military engagement without a clear sense of our objectives.
As a candidate, Trump repeatedly, and falsely, claimed he would seek the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. As President, he has sent thousands more of our service members into harm‚Äôs way ‚Äì with no clear plan to bring America‚Äôs longest war to a responsible close.
Today marks an ominous milestone: a child not yet born when the United States entered the conflict in Afghanistan is now eligible to fight there. https://t.co/O6vKImMUlT

Let's not forget that Russia is:		‚òëÔ∏è still meddling in upcoming elections, including the U.S. midterms	‚òëÔ∏è sponsoring disinformation campaigns around the world	‚òëÔ∏è bombing civilians in Syria	‚òëÔ∏è violating the Minsk agreement and the INF treaty	‚òëÔ∏è illegally occupying Crimea

A deal will only be complete and successful if it permanently rids North Korea of nuclear weapons and its ballistic missiles, as confirmed by a comprehensive verification regime. That's the precise standard the Trump administration has set and the one we must hold them to.
Any progress is welcome, but a partial deal that fails to secure complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization is, at best, incomplete. There can be no victory lap at that point.

At the end of the day, the risk of war may be higher than ever, but we can't rush back into a ‚Äúfire and fury‚Äù belligerence. The costs of any such war almost certainly would be catastrophic. The only viable path forward is diplomacy in seamless coordination with our partners.
Some of this recklessness stems from the fact that Trump desperately wanted a diplomatic win, while John Bolton has consistently advocated military action against North Korea. Trump cannot attempt to fashion himself as a peacemaker while surrounding himself with war hawks.
Only now, he is left with an antagonized ‚Äì and still nuclear ‚Äì adversary, while we have alienated our closest allies and partners, whose cooperation we will continue to need.
From the start of this engagement, Trump has acted like a politician in search of a political win rather than a statesman acting in our national interest. This has been about Trump acting to help Trump, not America.
Trump‚Äôs cancellation of the proposed summit with North Korea is the latest in a string of reckless and erratic foreign policy decisions that have alternated between threatening war and begging for negotiation.
Even if there was no explicit quid pro quo in these cases, foreign leaders may believe they can curry favor with Trump by undermining our rule of law rather than with policy concessions or enhanced cooperation. That's good for Trump, but bad for America.

‚ÄúTrump sees himself as a master negotiator, yet is not particularly good at it. He makes threats he doesn‚Äôt follow through on and promises he can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt keep. This does not add up to a recipe for success, and the stakes could not be higher.‚Äù‚Äî@ColinKahl https://t.co/iTOImjnH3G
We all must root for the success of these efforts, but diplomacy is not a prize: it's a tool. The question remains whether this administration knows how to use it.
Executing this will be all the more difficult because the administration starts with no Ambassador in Seoul‚Äînot even a nominee‚Äîand no senior official overseeing North Korea policy. The administration must also guard against the risk Trump will be won over with personal flattery.
There must be a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear challenge, and a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-Un would make sense if it were part of a broader, well-planned strategy involving our key allies. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just a propaganda coup for Kim.

Trump's treatment of our neighbor and trading partner Mexico‚Äîa country whose cooperation is vital to our national security‚Äîis yet another example of his administration's recklessness and incompetence putting our safety and prosperity at risk.
Meanwhile, our Embassy in Mexico will soon be operating without an Ambassador after one of our most experienced diplomats announced last week her intention to resign‚Äîthe latest casualty of the Trump administration's attempts to gut the State Department: https://t.co/nqXJ1IABAm

Kushner is in Mexico because @EPN cancelled his planned visit to Washington after another ‚Äútesty‚Äù call with Trump last week. The U.S.-Mexican relationship has soured thanks to Trump‚Äôs absurd obsession with Mexico paying for his border wall: https://t.co/TuqZHnasLm

These are the real-world consequences of the Trump administration‚Äôs dangerous decision to hollow out the State Department. The administration has so far proven incapable of forging or leveraging diplomatic progress, and now must play catch-up with our regional partners.
In fact, the Trump administration reportedly dumped one potential ambassadorial nominee precisely because he expressed a preference for diplomacy over war: https://t.co/4XGJf4DWBI
Any diplomatic progress would be in our national interest‚Äîbut the sad truth is that the Trump administration has left us woefully unprepared to leverage it. We have no Ambassador in Seoul‚Äînot even a nominee‚Äîand no senior State Department official overseeing North Korea policy. https://t.co/VXsxkPattG
