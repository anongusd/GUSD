@dodpaa personnel began exhuming the remains from the Punchbowl for analysis in 2015. Using mitochondrial DNA analysis, anthropological &amp; dental analysis, along with circumstantial evidence, Bruesewitz' remains were finally identified March 19, 2018. #HonorThem
The remains of the deceased crew were recovered and interred in the Halawa and Nu-uanu Cemeteries. After an attempt at identifying the remains in September 1947, they were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (NMCP), known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu.
On Dec. 7, 1941, Bruesewitz was assigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma which was moored at Pearl Harbor when the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft. After sustaining multiple torpedo hits, the USS Oklahoma quickly capsized and resulted in the deaths of 429 crewmen.

Rear Adm. Herbert E. Schonland is laid to rest with his wife, Claire Mills, in Section 7A, Grave 168.	   	#HonorThem
Biographical information for this thread courtesy of https://t.co/RhVdvaTcq2.
Rear Adm. Herbert E. Schonland eventually retired from active service in 1947, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in recognition of his distinguished combat record.
Recognizing that Lt. Cmdr. Bruce McCandless was skillfully conning the cruiser, Rear Adm. Herbert E. Schonland remained at his post below, where his efforts were critical to saving the ship. For his extreme heroism and courage on this occasion, he was awarded the #MedalOfHonor.
Rear Adm. Daniel J. Callaghan and the ship's captain, Cassin Young, were among those killed, leaving then Cmdr. Herbert E. Schonland as senior surviving officer. Though command thereby devolved on him, he was already engaged in vital damage control efforts.
In the bloody Nov. 13, 1942, night action in Iron Bottom Sound, the San Francisco was the flagship of Rear Adm. Daniel J. Callaghan's task force. 		While battling a greatly superior Japanese force the heavy cruiser San Francisco was badly damaged by enemy gunfire.
Rear Adm. Herbert E. Schonland graduated from the @NavalAcademy in June 1925. During #WorldWarII, Schonland's ship, the San Francisco, played an important role during the first three months of the long and difficult fight for Guadalcanal.

The memorial is located in Section 1 next to the @NatlParkService Ranger Station.
A cairn, the traditional Scottish monument honoring the dead, can be an informal heap of stones or may take a more orderly construction. In this instance, the 270 stones fit together to form a circular tower eight feet wide at the base and tapering to a height of 11 feet.
Eleven of the 270 dead were on the ground. The passengers and crew included people from 22 countries. Among them were 189 Americans, including 15 active duty military and 10 veterans.
The ill-fated flight was en route from Frankfurt, Germany, to New York via London's @HeathrowAirport. At 7:02 p.m., 27 minutes after leaving London, the plane exploded, raining fragments on the city of Lockerbie, including an entire wing and engines.
The #LockerbieCairn is a gift of the people of Scotland to the people of the United States, financed entirely through private donations.
The #LockerbieCairn, through its 270 blocks of red Scottish sandstone, memorializes the 270 lives lost in the terrorist attack on the United States when Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed Dec. 21, 1988, over Lockerbie, Scotland.

Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston is laid to rest with his wife Elizabeth McBride Preston in Section 3, Grave 1847-A-1.	   	#HonorThem
Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston's exceptional daring and great personal valor enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.
Under continuous fire for two and a half hours, Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston successfully achieved a mission considered suicidal in its tremendous hazards, and brought his boats through without personnel casualties and with but superficial damage from shrapnel.
Under continuous fire for two and a half hours, Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston successfully achieved a mission considered suicidal in its tremendous hazards, and brought his boats through without personnel casualties and with but superficial damage from shrapnel.
Increasingly vulnerable when covering aircraft were forced to leave because of insufficient fuel, Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston raced PT boats 489 and 363 at high speed for 20 minutes through shell-splashed water and across minefields to safety.
Aided by an aircraft smokescreen, Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston finally succeeded in reaching his objective and, under vicious fire delivered at 150-yard range, took the pilot aboard and cleared the area, sinking a small hostile cargo vessel with 40-mm. fire during retirement.
Twice turned back while running the gauntlet of fire from powerful coastal defense guns guarding the 11-mile strait at the entrance to the bay, Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston was again turned back by furious fire in the immediate area of the downed airman.
Volunteering for a perilous mission unsuccessfully attempted by the pilot's squadron mates and a PBY plane, Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston led PT-489 and PT-363 through 60 miles of restricted, heavily mined waters.
Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston's citation read: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty, while effecting the rescue of a pilot shot down less than 200 yards from a strongly defended Japanese dock and supply area, on Sept. 16, 1944.
Cmdr. Arthur M. Preston was awarded the #MedalOfHonor for a heroic rescue off Halmahera Island while in command of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 33 during the Morotai operation, Sept. 16, 1944.

On Sept. 2, 1945, the Japanese signed the surrender document on the deck of Fleet Adm. William F. Halsey's flagship, the #USSMissouri. He became an Admiral of the Fleet (five stars, comparable to General of the Army) in late 1945.
In the Pacific during #WorldWarII, Fleet Adm. William F. Halsey was given increasing responsibility for actions that would push the Japanese back to their homeland.
In 1934, Fleet Adm. William F. Halsey was offered command of the Saratoga on the condition that he go to flight school and be rated as an observer. He agreed, but insisted on training as a pilot even though he was twice as old as the pilots then in training.
Fleet Adm. William F. Halsey's first assignment after graduating from the @NavalAcademy in 1904 was aboard the #USSKansas as part of the Great White Fleet. During #WorldWarI, he was in the Atlantic, commanding torpedo boats and destroyers before getting command of the #USSShaw.

Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey.		#HonorThem

#McClellanGate was constructed in the 1870s as a tribute to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, whose wartime headquarters were located in @ArlingtonNPS.
Following the establishment of Arlington National Cemetery in 1864, the grounds were enclosed. 		Several gates provided pedestrian and vehicular access. The main entrance to the cemetery was located where #McClellanGate towers 30 feet above the roadway.
In 1864, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was nominated for President by the Democratic Party but lost the election. He did serve as governor of New Jersey from 1878-1881. 		On October 29, 1885, McClellan died in Orange, New Jersey.
After the Battle of Antietam, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was ordered to turn over his command to his good friend Ambrose E. Burnside and to go home to New Jersey to await further orders. 		They never came.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was outranked only by General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. 		He reorganized a disjointed and poorly disciplined Army, pushing it into the field in response to Gen. Robert E. Lee's invasion.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan had proven himself to be an efficient organizer with strong personal magnetism. For this reason, and some successes in West Virginia, President Lincoln approved him major general in the regular Army.
When the #CivilWar began, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was living in Ohio, where he served as president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad.
In 1857, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan resigned his commission of captain in the 1st Cavalry to become chief engineer of the Illinois Central Railroad, where he occasionally worked with a lawyer named Abraham Lincoln.
His time observing the #CrimeanWar resulted in the development of the "McClellan saddle," which was standard equipment in the @USArmy until mechanization eliminated horses in 1942.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's other accomplishments include surveyor of possible transcontinental railroad routes. 		As a member of a board of officers, he was sent abroad to study the armies of Europe and observe the #CrimeanWar.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was also an instructor at @WestPoint_USMAfor three years.
Upon graduation, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was appointed second lieutenant in the @USACEHQ. 		In the #MexicanWar, he won brevets of first lieutenant and captain for his zeal, gallantry and ability in constructing roads and bridges over routes for the marching army.
#DidYouKnow @WestPoint_USMA's class of 1846 contributed 20 generals to the #CivilWar's Union and Confederate Armies?
In 1846, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan earned the distinction of graduating second in his class of 59 students. 		(He was outranked in his class only by Charles S. Stewart, who later would serve under him as a captain of engineers.)
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan entered school at the age of five. He attended private schools and a prep school before entering @WestPoint_USMA in 1842. At the age of 15, he was the youngest of the #WestPoint arrivals that year to seek a place as fourth classman.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Dec. 3, 1826. He was the third of five children born to Dr. George and Elizabeth (Brinton) McClellan. His family moved within the upper ranks of Philadelphia society.

Authority was granted Nov. 20, 1970, to place a 12-inch-by-18-inch bronze plaque over the carved inscription and reads:		This Monument Was Erected in 1938	and Rededicated in 1971	To Commemorate Devoted Service	To Country and Humanity By	Army, Navy, and Air Force Nurses
On July 13, 1970, #USNavy Capt. Delores Cornelius, deputy director of the Navy Nurse Corps, requested authority to install a bronze plaque over the existing inscription on the #NursesMonument. The inscription at that time simply read 'Army and Navy Nurses.'
The granite statue of a nurse in uniform, sculptured by Frances Rich, honors the nurses who served in the U.S. armed forces in #WorldWarI, many of whom rest among the hundreds of nurses buried in Section 21 -- also known as the 'Nurses Section.'
Against a background of evergreens, a heroic size white marble figure looks out upon the @USArmy, @USNavy and @USAirForce nurses who so valiantly earned their right to lie at Arlington.

Pharris is laid to rest with his wife Elizabeth Lee in Section 13, Grave 16281.	   	#HonorThem
Biographical information for this thread courtesy of the @USNavy at https://t.co/OFqz8vt30n.
Initially Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris was awarded the #NavyCross, but was later upgraded to the #MedalOfHonor. During his #WorldWarII service, he also earned the #PurpleHeart and #GoldStar.
By Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris' inspiring leadership, his valiant efforts and his extreme loyalty to his ship and her crew, he saved many of his shipmates from death and was largely responsible for keeping the California in action during the attack.
Rendered unconscious 2x by nauseous fumes + handicapped by painful injuries, Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris persisted in his efforts to speed up the supply of ammo and repeatedly risked his life to enter flooding compartments and drag shipmates who were submerged in oil to safety.
With water and oil rushing in where the port bulkhead had been torn up, and many crewmembers overcome by oil fumes, the ship without power and listing heavily to port as a result of a second torpedo hit, Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris ordered the ship fitters to counter flood.
Quickly recovering, Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris acted on his own  initiative to set up a hand-supply ammunition train for the antiaircraft guns.
In charge of the ordnance repair party on the third deck when the first Japanese torpedo struck almost directly under his station, Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris was stunned and severely injured by the concussion that hurled him to the overhead and back to the deck.
During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941, Lt. Cmdr. Jackson C. Pharris was onboard the #USSCalifornia.

Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee is laid to rest in Section 1, Grave 526-B.	   	#HonorThem
Information for this thread courtesy of @NLM_news at https://t.co/W5XfuT4zsB.
For her services, the Japanese government honored Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee with the Imperial Order of the Sacred Crown. 		Later she lectured on hygiene at the @UCBerkeley, and for the rest of her life, divided her time between several homes and overseeing her son's education.
In 1904 during the #RussoJapaneseWar, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee offered the Society's services to the Japanese government. Spending six months in Japan working beside nurses in that country, McGee was designated "superior of nurses" with the rank of an army officer.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee also helped found the Society of Spanish-American War Nurses in 1900 to look after the interests of the @ArmyNurseCorps, and served as the organization's president for the next six years.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee helped the @USNavy establish a nursing corps two years later, and in 1899 wrote a manual on nursing for the military.
At the end of the #SpanishAmericanWar, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee drafted the legislation that established the U.S. @ArmyNurseCorps.
After assembling approximately 1,600 highly qualified nurses, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee was appointed acting assistant surgeon general of the @USArmy, becoming the only woman authorized to wear an officer's uniform.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee created a special committee of the @todaysdar to screen nurses and then offered their services to Army Surgeon General George M. Sternberg.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee petitioned Army Surgeon General George M. Sternberg to permit only fully qualified nurses to serve.
In 1898 with the outbreak of the #SpanishAmericanWar, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee discovered through friends that Army Surgeon General George M. Sternberg intended to use nurses at base hospitals for the first time since the #CivilWar.
For the next few years, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee operated a private practice before withdrawing from clinical work around 1895 to pursue other interests.
After earning her doctor of medicine degree from Columbian University (later @GWtweets) in 1892, and gaining experience in political organization, she completed an internship at the Women's Clinic in Washington, D.C., and studied gynecology at Johns @HopkinsMedicine.
In 1888, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee married William John McGee, who supported her decision to attend medical school soon after they were married.
Educated at home and in elite private schools in @WashingtonDC, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee was later able to travel to Cambridge, England, and @unige_en, Switzerland. She pursued interests in history and genealogy, even writing and delivering lectures on these topics.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee's parents were both respected intellectuals and academics and her  mother, in particular, encouraged her daughter to pursue diverse  academic subjects.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee's childhood and her family's social status afforded her a multitude of educational and professional opportunities.
Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee was instrumental in organizing the 1,600 nurses who served during the conflict and wrote the Army Reorganization Act of 1901, which established the @ArmyNurseCorps as a permanent unit.
In 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee was named acting assistant surgeon general of the @USArmy, making her the only woman permitted to wear an officer's uniform.

Information for this thread courtesy of the @LibraryCongress at https://t.co/WNHdyTn9Bg.
Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson retired in 1982 to take up volunteer work in Washington D.C. 		He passed away Jan. 25, 2005.
Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson worked for @Time and Life Magazine in India, Germany, Britain, the  Middle East, and Mexico, and @USNews and World Report as chief correspondent for South America and chief correspondent for Europe.
Following #WorldWarII, Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson stayed abroad as a civilian foreign correspondent covering some of the century's major news stories.
Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson's decorations include the @USArmy's #LegionOfMerit, #BronzeStar, #CombatInfantryBadge, plus the Valor Medal of the National Headliners Club.
Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson's most notable assignment was as the only reporter to walk with the legendary ranger force Merrill's Marauders through their entire 600-mile march behind Japanese lines from India to China.
Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson took part in 10 battles on land, sea, and in the air in two theaters of war, Southwest Pacific and China, Burma, India.
Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson became a familiar name to members of the armed forces during #WorldWarII as one of the principal combat correspondents for the global GI-run magazine Yank, The Army Weekly.
The volunteer force first known as Galahad and later dubbed Merrill’s  Marauders skillfully adapted to fighting in the jungles of Burma. 		Their guerrilla tactics were brilliantly executed to defeat an enemy force with superior numbers and firepower.
Infantry Soldiers in China-Burma-India served with scant resources and a sense of physical isolation.
#TodayIRemember @USArmy Tech. Sgt. Dave Richardson, who as a combat correspondent covered Merrill's Marauders, the famed #WorldWarII infantry unit that was founded #OnThisDay in 1943. 		Who are you remembering today?		#HonorThem		(Courtesy photos) https://t.co/btaueEVPmj
Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly is laid to rest with his wife Wilma in Section 7A, Grave 125.	   	#HonorThem

Read firsthand of Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly's experience at https://t.co/6o5Am1uMHo.
Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly refused to leave his platoon until the attack had been resumed and the objective taken. His gallantry and intrepidity in the face of seemingly certain death saved the lives of many of his fellow soldiers and was an example of bravery under fire.
In all, Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly made 10 separate trips through the brutal fire, each time bringing out a man from the death trap. He guided and encouraged seven other casualties who were able to crawl by themselves to escape the hail of fire.
Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly was forced to crawl, dragging the injured behind him for most of the 300 yards separating the exposed area from a place of comparative safety.
Ordered to withdraw, then Cpl. Thomas J. Kelly reached safety with uninjured remnants of the unit, but, on realizing the extent of casualties suffered by the platoon, voluntarily retraced his steps and began evacuating his comrades under direct machine-gun fire.
Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly's platoon, committed in a flanking maneuver, had advanced down a small, open valley overlooked by wooded slopes hiding enemy machine guns and tanks, when the attack was stopped by murderous fire that inflicted heavy casualties in the U.S. ranks.
Sgt. Thomas J. Kelly was a medic during #WorldWarII and was awarded the #MedalOfHonor for actions performed April 5, 1945, during an attack on the town of Alemert, Germany.

Proud families displayed flags in homes, businesses, schools and churches bearing a blue star for each family member serving in the military. Families stitched a gold star over the blue star to honor those members who died during military service.
The term "Gold Star" originated during #WorldWarI.
Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day is observed in the United States on the last Sunday of September. The U.S. Congress recognizes this as the day when the U.S. honors surviving parents and families of fallen service members -- specifically those who died while on active-duty.

During those 47 years, presidents, commanders-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic and other dignitaries addressed tens of thousands who traveled to Arlington National Cemetery to honor the United States’ fallen service members.
The Old Amphitheater was the location of the first #MemorialDay ceremony and played a crucial role in all #DecorationDay celebrations until 1920 when the larger #MemorialAmphitheater was dedicated.
During the Second Battle of Bull Run, James Tanner was wounded and lost both legs. He later became a stenographer and was present at both Abraham Lincoln’s deathbed and the trial of the Lincoln conspirators.
James Tanner, who is buried a few yards away from the amphitheater in Section 2, Grave 877, was a corporal in the 87th New York Volunteer Infantry during the #CivilWar.
The historic photograph, taken during the dedication of the statue of @USArmy Maj. Philip Kearny in what is now known as the James R. Turner Amphitheater, was taken Nov. 11, 1914.
#ThrowbackThursday: Pictured is the Old Amphitheater, originally dedicated May 30, 1873, and later renamed the #TannerAmphitheater during the cemetery’s 150th commemoration.

Harry Blackmun is buried in Section 5, Lot 40-4.		#HonorThem
Harry Blackmun suffered a fall at age 90 and underwent hip-replacement surgery. He died March 4, 1999, from complications arising from the surgery.
In 1997, Harry Blackmun appeared in the 1997 #StevenSpeilberg movie Amistad as a Supreme Court justice who delivered the decision that African captives who had commandeered the schooner Amistad were born and remained free men.
Harry Blackmun resigned from the court Aug. 3, 1994, and was succeeded by Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
Harry Blackmun announced his opposition to capital punishment in all  circumstances shortly before his resignation after 24 years on the  Supreme Court.
Harry Blackmun's role on an increasingly conservative court often left him in the minority on opinions later in his career. He was the sole dissenting justice from a ruling that Haitian refugees could be intercepted in their boats and forcibly returned to Haiti without a hearing.
Although joined in by six other members of the court, the abortion rights decision brought Blackmun criticism and threats, none of which he ducked. Rather he pressed on his fellow jurists to understand the consequences of their rulings and deal with their real-world effects.
Harry Blackmun is best known as the author of the 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade that extended the right of privacy in reproductive matters to the decision of women whether to carry a pregnancy to term.
'What does equal protection mean? What is cruel and unusual punishment? I would hope that  I have grown in that respect over the years. But as far as shifting  from conservatism to liberalism, I don't believe I have done that.'
In grappling with the issues that came before the court, Harry Blackmun evolved an understanding of 'the great phrases' of the U.S. Constitution that drew him a long way from his beginnings.
Prior to that Harry Blackmun was resident counsel for the @MayoClinic and Mayo Association for nine years.
Harry Blackmun was recommended to the president by Chief Justice Warren Burger, a childhood friend, and was heralded by Nixon as a 'strict constructionist' when plucked from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals where he had served for 11 years.
Harry Blackmun went on earn a Bachelor of Laws from @Harvard_Law School in 1932.		Nominated to the #SupremeCourt after President Nixon's first two choices were rejected by the Senate (Clement Haynesworth and Harold Carswell), he reputedly said being picked third kept him humble.
In honor of #MathStorytellingDay, today we are highlighting Harold Andrew Blackmun, former Supreme Court associate justice who in 1929, earned a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from @Harvard University. 		(Photo courtesy of the Supreme Court) https://t.co/SLGHNTqmmd

In 1953 Gen. @GeorgeCMarshall was awarded the @NobelPrize for Peace for his role in proposing, encouraging legislative action, and supporting the European Recovery Program (known as the #MarshallPlan).
After the war, Gen. @GeorgeCMarshall was named special ambassador to China (1945–1947), Secretary of State (1947–1949), President of the American @RedCross (1949–1950), and Secretary of Defense (1950–1951).
During #WorldWarII, Gen. @GeorgeCMarshall as @USArmy Chief of Staff (1939–1945) was the most important military figure in the U.S. military establishment and of great significance in maintaining the Anglo-American coalition.
Gen. @GeorgeCMarshall’s career touched on many of the key events of the 20th century, and he is the only person to have served as the @ArmyChiefStaff during #WorldWarII, as Secretary of State following #WWII, and as the Secretary of Defense during the #KoreanWar.

Warren Earl Burger is perhaps best known for authoring the unanimous opinion that required Nixon to surrender @WhiteHouse tape recordings and papers that had been subpoenaed for use in Watergate cover-up trials.
Warren Earl Burger sought to improve the administration of justice in the U.S. as much through reform of administrative procedures and court management and efficiency as through the more than 250 decisions he authored and the votes he cast + cases he had brought before the court.
Warren Earl Burger came to @WashingtonDC to serve as Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, of the Justice Department and was named by President Dwight Eisenhower to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1955.
Warren Earl Burger earned his degrees at night, working days to support himself. In private practice in the Twin Cities, he taught law and became involved in electoral politics floor-managing the 1948 +1952 presidential bids of Harold Stassen at the Republican Nat'l Conventions.
Warren Earl Burger, the 15th Chief Justice of the United States, served 17 years in office before resigning to accept appointment as the unpaid chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.

Although Maj. Walter Reed died more than a century ago, his name and legacy persist. The @WRBethesda in Bethesda, Maryland, is named for him.
Just a year later, Maj. Walter Reed described how #YellowFever, one of the most dreaded tropical diseases, is transmitted.
In 1898, Maj. Walter Reed investigated the typhoid fever epidemic, expanding our understanding of how this disease spreads.
In 1893, Maj. Walter Reed became curator of the Army Medical Museum (now the @MedicalMuseum) and professor of clinical microscopy at the Army Medical School (now the @WRAIROfficial).
Maj. Walter Reed was a pioneering bacteriologist and led experiments establishing mosquito transmission of #YellowFever. His research into the causes of typhoid and yellow fever has saved countless human lives.

@NewAgeMonaLisa @kikuandjuju @USArmy @joshscampbell That is incorrect. The first Unknown was from World War I. Eventually one Unknown each from World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War were interred as well. 		In 1998, the Vietnam War Unknown was disinterred and identified as Lt. Michael Blassie.

William Rehnquist is laid to rest with his wife Natalie Cornell in Section 5, Grave 7049-LH.		#HonorThem
On Sept. 3, 2005, after a long battle with thyroid cancer during which William Rehnquist declined to step down from the bench but was forced to be absent from many oral arguments, he passed away in his suburban Virginia home.
After his wife passed away in 1991, Rehnquist spent the last 14 years of his life as a widower, passing his time with quiet hobbies.
As chief justice, William Rehnquist won the respect of his colleagues through his efficient management of court affairs. Rehnquist also revealed a moderation in his views by voting with liberals to protect gay rights and free speech.
A Democratic Senate overwhelmingly confirmed his nomination. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan nominated William Rehnquist as chief justice.
Richard Kleindienst sought William Rehnquist for the position of deputy attorney general in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. When Justice John Marshall Harlan retired in 1971, the Nixon administration chose Rehnquist as Harlan's replacement.
During that time, William Rehnquist befriended Richard Kleindienst, another attorney from Phoenix. When Richard Nixon rose to the presidency a few years later, he appointed Kleindienst deputy attorney general of his administration.
Eventually William Rehnquist began participating in politics and becoming a Republican party official. Rehnquist campaigned for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater during the 1964 elections.
After completing a clerkship under Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, William Rehnquist moved to Phoenix and began working for a law firm.
#DidYouKnow Sandra Day O'Connor, who would eventually serve with William Rehnquist on the #SupremeCourt, graduated third from that same class?
A distinguished student, Rehnquist was elected to @PhiBetaKappa in 1948. He continued his education at @Harvard where he received earned a master of arts degree -- 2 years later. William Rehnquist returned to @Stanford Law School in 1950; he graduated at the top of his class.
Like many U.S. citizens in his generation, William Rehnquist attended college after #WorldWarII with the support of scholarship money from the #GIBill. At @Stanford, he earned both a bachelor and a master of arts degree in political science.
#WorldWarII erupted before William Rehnquist had a chance to complete his education and the future chief justice enlisted in the #AirForce branch of the @USArmy as a weather observer. He served in North Africa.
William Rehnquist was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Oct. 1, 1924. The son of a paper salesman, Rehnquist grew up in a heavily conservative household in which popular Republican leaders such as Alf Landon, Wendell Wilkie, and Herbert Hoover were idolized.

#DidYouKnow there are casualties of and veterans of the Revolutionary War laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery?		For a listing, visit https://t.co/elA8Yc0n9L.
This turning point in the American Revolution prevented the British from dividing New England from the rest of the colonies, and it was the deciding factor in bringing active French support to the U.S. cause.
British Gen. John Burgoyne's surrender followed battles with U.S. Gen. Horatio Gates near Saratoga in September and October 1777. With the British losing men and defenses during both engagements, Burgoyne retreated with a weakened army to Saratoga, where he surrendered to Gates.

Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny is laid to rest in Section 2, Grave S-8.		#HonorThem
#DidYouKnow there are two equestrian statues in the cemetery? 		One for Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny and one for @BritishArmy Field Marshal Sir John Dill.
Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny was killed in action in the 1862 #BattleOfChantilly. Kearny was buried at Trinity Churchyard in New York. In 1912, his remains were exhumed and re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery under the equestrian statue in his honor.
When the #CivilWar broke out in 1861, Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny returned to the Army and was appointed a brigadier general. The Army had been reluctant to restore his commission due to his disability, but realized the need for experienced combat officers like Kearny.
After the war, Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny served in Army recruiting in New York City. While there, he was promoted to major but later resigned his commission.
During a battle in the Mexican-America War, Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny led a daring cavalry charge and suffered a wound to his left arm which was later amputated.
Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny was known for his fearless character in battle earning him the nickname "Kearny the Magnificent." He is also known for his leadership in the #MexicanAmericanWar and #CivilWar.

The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.
Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry.
According to the @CIA's World Fact Book, First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834.
Prior to laying the wreath, former President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Anthony Carmona toured the #MemorialAmphitheater Display Room.

Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin is laid to rest in Section 3, Grave 1885-RH. 		#HonorThem
Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1986, which is highest award that an American civilian can receive.
Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin received the National Medal of Science in 1970 for his work up to and including the development of the oral polio vaccine.
Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin began testing a new polio vaccine on humans, starting with his own family.
During the same time period, Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin discovered that the polio virus attacked and multiplied in the intestines, as opposed to the respiratory tract as was previously believed.
The first inactive polio vaccine, which required an injection administered by a doctor, was created in 1954 by Dr. Jonas Salk.
In the 1930s, the outbreak of polio, which led to paralysis or death, had reached epidemic proportions both in the United States and around the globe.

James Parks worked for the @USArmy from 1861 to 1929 by working as a grave digger and maintenance man for the cemetery. When he died on Aug. 21, 1929, he was granted special permission to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
James Parks still lived on Arlington Estate when Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton signed the orders designating Arlington as a military burial ground.
The first graves in #ArlingtonNationalCemetery were dug by Parks, a former Arlington Estate slave. Parks was freed in 1862 under the terms of the will of his former owner, George Washington Parke Custis.

The #WorldWarII memorial was dedicated in tribute to the legacy of the "Greatest Generation" May 29, 2004.
The #WorldWarII Memorial honors the service of 16 million members of the U.S. armed forces, the support of countless millions on the home front, and the ultimate sacrifice of 405,399 U.S. citizens.
Not far from the cemetery is the #WorldWarII Memorial. Pictured is the memorial's 24th panel, which depicts the emotions of V-J Day. It is one of 24 bronze bas-relief panels that flank the memorial's entrance and tell the story of the United States' experience in the war.
#VEDay, or Victory in Europe, occurred May 8, 1945, when Germany surrendered, thereby allowing the U.S. to concentrate on defeating Japan in the Pacific theater. 		The formal treaty of surrender between Japan and the Allies was signed Sept. 2, 1945 aboard the #USSMissouri.
More people were killed and more cities all around the globe were destroyed during #WorldWarII than in any other war. 		Due to the time difference, the United States typically commemorates V-J Day Aug. 14.
Known as #VJDay, the Allies’ Victory in Japan is commemorated #OnThisDay marking the end of #WorldWarII, the most catastrophic war in history. 	   	#HonorRememberExplore	   	(#WWII Memorial photo courtesy of @NatlParkService) https://t.co/hW4gKcpVSY

Some code talkers translated messages into their native languages and relayed them to another tribal member. 		Others developed a special code within their languages that they used in combat to send important messages.
American Indian code talkers were communications specialists. 		Their job was to send coded messages about troop movements, enemy positions, and other critical information on the battlefield.
“Code talkers,” as they came to be known after #WorldWarII, are twentieth-century American Indian warriors and heroes who significantly aided the victories of the United States and its allies.
The United States military asked them to develop secret battle communications based on their languages—and the country's enemies never deciphered the coded messages they sent.
More than 12,000 American Indians served in #WorldWarI—about 25 percent of the male American Indian population at that time. 		During #WorldWarII, when the total American Indian population was less than 350,000, an estimated 44,000 Indian men and women served.
In honor of #NavajoCodeTalkersDay, today we're highlighting the American Indians who used their languages as weapons during #WorldWarI and #WorldWarII.		Pictured are members of the Navajo Code Talkers Association at the #MemorialAmphitheater July 6, 1983. 		(@USArmy photo) https://t.co/31UFsNadpF

And like the other 304 women who were enlisted into the Marine Corps during #WWI, Opha May Johnson never left her clerical duties.
By the time of her exit from active service in 1919, Opha May Johnson had risen to the rank of sergeant and was working for the quartermaster still. 		She was the highest ranking woman in the @USMC during the war.
Now as Pvt. Opha May Johnson, she would continue to serve the @USMC in Washington, D.C., in the office of the Quartermaster General of the Marine Corps.
At the time of her enlistment, Opha May Johnson had been working as a civil service employee at Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington D.C.
And so, by being the first in line on Aug. 13, 1918, at a @WashingtonDC recruiting station, Opha May Johnson, originally from Kokomo, Indiana, became the first woman enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Secretary Josephus Daniels approved Maj. Gen. George Barnett's request six days later on Aug. 8. Word was spread quickly via word of mouth and the media channels of the era, and five days later enlistments of women began.
The key reasoning being there were any number of clerical and administrative duties that women could perform as well as men, and that by doing so, those men could be freed to perform field service instead.
On Aug. 2, 1918, Commandant of the Marine Corps Maj. Gen. George Barnett sent a request to Secretary of the @USNavy Josephus Daniels for women to be enrolled in the Marine Corps to replace men in clerical duties.
The solution came in the form of the creation of the Marine Corps' Women's Reserve.
With as many men enlistees as possible needing to be trained for combat  on Europe’s western front, the #MarineCorps realized that it still needed able bodies capable of performing the administrative tasks men had performed up until then.
When Opha May Johnson enlisted in the @USMC, the United States was in the middle of #WorldWarI. 		#WWI100
Good timing, luck, and a paradigm shift in history are often the graces which allow someone to be commemorated for important accomplishments. 		In the case of Opha May Johnson, the three graces allowed her to be the first woman to join the U.S. #MarineCorps.	   	(@USMC photo) https://t.co/u2Nr28N1uE

Charles Blair died in an aircraft crash Sept. 2, 1978. He is laid to rest in  Section 2, Grave 4966, with his wife Maureen Fitzsimmons Blair, more commonly known as Maureen O'Hara. Blair also served in the @USNavy.	 	 #HonorThem
Information for this thread courtesy of https://t.co/KG4KoNUDUw .
While Charles Blair’s solo flight over the pole in itself was exciting, his time in the Air Force developing advanced celestial navigation systems is a legacy he should be remembered for.
Charles Blair’s navigational systems made it possible to compute a fix to within  100-200 feet. 		In the pre-GPS era, this kind of technology was  revolutionary.
Charles Blair's dual-navigation systems were never actually used with jet fighters in the Soviet Union, but they were put into place during the Vietnam War in the F-105 Thunderchief.
The other system he worked with was  pre-computed navigation astrotrackers. Naval officer and navigation  expert P.V.H. Weems worked to create the pre-comp calculations for  Charles Blair.
Charles Blair used two different navigation systems to address this problem. 		The first was an inertial navigation system, which helped navigate by using a computer, motion sensor, and  rotation sensor to calculate the direction and speed of the plane.
Charles Blair became an active duty colonel  in the Air Force and was assigned to the task of taking a jet fighter  plane and turning it into a long-distance nuclear delivery system that  the U.S. could use against the Soviet Union.
Charles Blair's stunt was a major success,  and signified to the U.S. military that there were some big changes to  be made to current navigation systems.
On May 29, 1951, Blair set out in his  single-seat P-51 (renamed the  #ExcaliburIII) and made his 3,260-mile,  record-setting flight from Norway to Alaska.
Charles Blair bet the crew members that he  could make a flight from Norway to Alaska with just a $12 surplus astrocompass in a P-51 Mustang.
At the time, flying over the North Pole to  reach the U.S.S.R. was a difficult feat that required three navigators  and a thousand pounds of navigational equipment. Blair knew he could do  better.
One evening at a bar, Charles Blair made a  bet that would change the course of his career. 		He was hanging out with @USAirForce crew members who were involved in mapping the fastest route to  the Soviet Union during the #ColdWar.
Charles Blair was a pilot for commercial  airlines including United Airlines, Pan American Airlines, and American  Export Airlines. While working as a commercial pilot, Blair would become  bored on long flights and decided to teach himself celestial navigation  for the fun of it.
In 1952, Charles Blair published his  autobiography, "Red Ball in the Sky," and in 1956, he co-wrote "Thunder  Above" with A.J. Wallis, which was filmed as "Beyond the Curtain" in  1960.
In honor of #BookLoversDay, today we're highlighting @U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Charles F. Blair who was a pilot with the first squadron of jets to fly over #NorthPole May 29, 1951.		(Picture courtesy of the @Smithsonian @AirAndSpace Museum) https://t.co/gGlb9DRMlN

On April 6, 1988, the remains of Matthew Henson and his wife were transported to Washington, D.C., where they were re-interred among other American heroes and near the grave site of Robert Peary and his wife Josephine Deibitsch Peary.
In 1987, at the request of Dr. S. Allen Counter of @Harvard University, President Ronald Reagan granted permission for Henson and his wife to be re-interred at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery.
After his death in 1955, Matthew Henson was buried in New York City's Woodlawn Cemetery. In 1968, the body of his wife Lucy Ross Henson was buried nearby.
Matthew Henson was three times refused a pension by Congress, was excluded from the Explorer's Club in which Peary was president, and lastly was not considered for burial at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery at the time of his death.
Matthew Henson, however, received comparatively little recognition for  his part in the discovery, even though Peary repeatedly acknowledged  Henson's indispensability to the success of the Polar expeditions.
During his lifetime, Robert Peary received many international honors for his achievement.
On that historic day, it was Matthew Henson, an African-American, who first reached the Pole and planted the U.S. flag.
On April 6, 1909, two U.S. citizens and four Inuit became the first human beings to set foot on the North Pole. The achievement crowned numerous attempts to reach the Pole, over a period of 18 years, by Robert Edwin Peary and Matthew Henson.

This Saturday, join @MountVernon and @moph_hq at 10:30 a.m. as they pay tribute to nation's oldest military decoration. 		More information at https://t.co/3GUT6TxiNJ.
The #PurpleHeart, is awarded in the name of @POTUS to any member of the armed forces of the U.S. who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the U.S. armed services after April 5, 1917, has been wounded, killed or has died after being wounded.
Originally the #PurpleHeart was awarded for meritorious service. Being wounded was considered to be one type of merit. 		With the creation of the #LegionOfMerit in 1942, the award of the Purple Heart for meritorious service became unnecessary and was therefore discontinued.
Also in that year, the Purple Heart was made available for posthumous award to any member of the military killed on or after Dec. 7, 1941.
In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order allowing the @USNavy to award the #PurpleHeart to Sailors, Marines and Coast Guard personnel.
The #PurpleHeart has undergone many changes with respect to the criteria for being awarded. At first, the Purple Heart was exclusively awarded to @USArmy and Army Air Corps personnel and could not be awarded posthumously to the next of kin.
On May 28, 1932, 137 #WorldWarI veterans were conferred their Purple Hearts at Temple Hill, in New Windsor, New York. Temple Hill was the site of the New Windsor Cantonment, which was the final encampment of the Continental Army in the winter of 1782-1783.
Gen. John J. "Black Jack" Pershing suggested a need for an award for merit in 1918, but it wasn't until 1932 that the #PurpleHeart was created in recognition of Gen. George Washington's ideals and for the bicentennial of his birth.
Gen. George Washington stated that the award was to be a permanent one, but once the #RevolutionaryWar ended, the Badge of Merit was all but forgotten until the 20th century.
At the present time there are three known recipients of the Badge of Military Merit: Sgt. Elijah Churchill, Sgt. William Brown, and Sgt. Daniel Bissel.
This award was open only to enlisted men and granted them the distinction of being permitted to pass all guards and sentinels as could commissioned-officers. The names of the recipients were to have been kept in a "Book of Merit."
The Continental Congress had forbidden Gen. George Washington from granting commissions and promotions in rank to recognize merit. 		Yet he wanted to honor merit, particularly among enlisted Soldiers. 		On Aug. 7, 1782, his general orders established the Badge of Military Merit.
The award known as the Purple Heart has a history that reaches back to the waning days of the #RevolutionaryWar.
#OnThisDay in 1782, former President and Gen. George Washington established the Badge of Military Merit, what is now known as the #PurpleHeart.		#PurpleHeartDay #HonorRememberExplore		(Image courtesy of @MountVernon) https://t.co/kkI9znEa6I
@cadotonic Sorry we don’t! 		Variations of it have been used in books and films, we found information online stating it is a Jewish belief and countless people have been quoted retelling the quote but we don’t know it’s origin.
@cadotonic Hi Bob -- the gesture comes from the quote "In truth a person dies twice, once when we each stop breathing,  and a second time when somebody mentions their name for the last time," and is meant to keep the person's memory alive.

Learn more about the USS Nautilus at https://t.co/fnhdFTJe4N.
Just six years later, on June 14, 1952, President Harry S. Truman signed the keel of the first nuclear-powered submarine.
That concept became reality when then-Capt. Hyman G. Rickover, an engineering officer, signed onto the project in 1946.
Getting #Nautilus “underway on nuclear power” was a remarkable accomplishment that began with the concept of harnessing the power of splitting uranium atoms in 1939 by scientists at the @USNRL.
The #USSNautilus was the fourth @USNavy vessel and second submarine to bear the name. She was also the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine.
The mission had been personally authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a response to the USSR's #Sputnik program.
#OnThisDay in 1958 the #USSNautilus (SSN 571) became the first submarine to cross the "top" of the world during #OperationSunshine when the boat passed under an arctic ice cap at the North Pole. 		#HonorRememberExplore		(Painting by Albert Murray, courtesy of @USNHistory) https://t.co/KXs7Fovusi
Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant is laid to rest in Section 2, Grave S-3, overlooking the capital city he designed.		#HonorThem
On the east end (the design facing the Arlington House) is a circle, 2 feet 7 inches in diameter, enclosing the plan of the City of Washington laid out by Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant.
The monument is made of white marble consisting of four slabs. The top slab is supported on six marble posts.
It was May 22, 1911, that the monument marking Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant's grave was dedicated. The service was conducted on the portico of the #ArlingtonHouse.
Many notables attended including the chief justice and justices of the #SupremeCourt, many senators and members of #Congress, high-ranking military, city officials, diplomatic corps and Washington socialites.
President William Howard Taft made the dedication address. He was followed by Ambassador Jusserand of France. The concluding address was made by Sen. Elihu Root. More than 350 people attended the ceremony.
Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant's remains were then taken by military escort to Arlington National Cemetery, and he was reinterred at 4 p.m. on the slope in front of the @ArlingtonNPS.
They remained there until April 28, 1909, where a military escort conveyed the remains to the @USCapitol where they lay in state from 9 a.m.-noon that day.
Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant's remains were placed in a metal-lined casket, covered with the U.S. flag and moved to Mount Olivet Cemetery on Bladensburg Road, Washington D.C.
In 1908 the Board of Commissioners of the City of Washington requested the Secretary of War to make available a suitable burial site at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery, and on April 22, 1909, the remains of Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant were disinterred from the Digges Farm.
He died June 14, 1825, and was interred on the Digges Farm, also known as Green Hill, in Prince Georges County, Maryland.
Under the direction of President George Washington, Brevet Maj. Pierre Charles L'Enfant planned the federal city of @WashingtonDC.

As tragic as the loss was, the @USNavy learned from its mistakes and implemented changes that improved reporting procedures, requirements for ship escorts, and increased lifesaving equipment.
A team of civilian researchers led by entrepreneur and philanthropist @PaulGAllen discovered the #USSIndianapolis' wreck Aug. 19, 2017.
Around 800 of the ship’s 1,196 Sailors and Marines survived the sinking, but after four to five days in the water -- suffering exposure, dehydration, drowning, and shark attacks -- only 316 survived.
Indianapolis was en route from Guam to Leyte when she was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine I-58 within the first hour of July 30.
The loss of #USSIndianapolis was a tragic moment following the completion of a secret mission that directly contributed to #WorldWarII’s end. After a successful high-speed run to deliver atomic bomb components to Tinian, the decorated Portland-class cruiser continued to Guam.
Due to communications and other errors, the #USSIndianapolis' loss went unnoticed until survivors were seen from a passing aircraft on Aug. 2, 1945. Four days earlier, she had delivered atomic bomb components used on Japan in August.

The names of all the officers and enlisted men of the First Cavalry who lost their lives during the Spanish-American War are engraved on the imposing granite stone.
The monument is a large, dark-grey granite stone that displays the insignia of the First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry on its west face. It also lists the battles in which the #RoughRiders took part — Las Guasimas, San Juan and Santiago.
The monument in Section 22 at Arlington National Cemetery was erected to  their memory by the members and friends of the regiment in 1906. The  official dedication took place April 12, 1907.
Many of the battles that earned the Rough Riders their famed distinction and accolades were also fought by #BuffaloSoldiers. A great roll-up of Buffalo Soldiers' contributions (and lack of recognition for those contributions) is available at https://t.co/UHSZlNh4LJ.
The #RoughRiders served with distinction during the #SpanishAmericanWar.
But mention the name 'Rough Riders,' and visions come to mind of the charge up San Juan Hill, led by Leonard Wood and Roosevelt.
The "Cowboy Cavalry" became one of the best-known cavalry units in U.S. history, though few people remember their official title, the First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry.
Theodore Roosevelt recruited a diverse group of cowboys, miners, law enforcement officials, and Native Americans to join the Rough Riders.
Before becoming president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt was the Assistant Secretary of the @USNavy. He resigned in 1898 to organize the #RoughRiders in the #SpanishAmericanWar. The U.S. was fighting against Spain over Spain's colonial policies with Cuba.

Sgt. Cornelius Charlton also earned the #PurpleHeart, the Korean Service Medal and many other citations during his military career.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton was one of only two black men to receive the award for actions performed during the #KoreanWar.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton was credited with saving many of the Soldiers in his platoon. His courage, leadership and self-sacrifice earned him the #MedalOfHonor, which he posthumously received in early 1952.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton went ahead of the rest of the Soldiers and raked the position with bullets, destroying two Chinese machine guns and forcing back its defenders. But he was hit by a second grenade during the charge - an injury that proved fatal.
The platoon then spotted the Chinese bunker that was firing the mortars from the far side of the hill, so Sgt. Cornelius Charlton again urged them forward to destroy it.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton suffered a serious chest wound during that time, but he wouldn't give in. He refused medical attention and instead led a third charge up the hill, which took them to the crest of the ridge.
Using a rifle and grenades, Sgt. Cornelius Charlton managed to destroy two hostile positions and kill six enemy soldiers before his unit got pinned down on the hill they were attacking. He tried to push the men forward, but they were driven back again by heavy grenade fire.
His unit's leader was injured and had to be evacuated, so Charlton assumed command and rallied the troops to continue the assault.
On June 2, 1951, Sgt. Cornelius Charlton's platoon was attacking a hill that was heavily defended by Chinese infantrymen and mortars near the village of Chipo-ri, northeast of Seoul.
Charlton was awarded the #MedalOfHonor during #OperationPiledriver, a major battle in the #KoreanWar that was aimed at pushing North Korean and Chinese troops out of the south.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton was initially assigned to an engineering unit, but he requested and received a transfer into Company C, an infantry unit that was part of the 24th Infantry Regiment.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton was raised in southern West Virginia, but his family eventually moved to the Bronx, New York City. In 1946, he graduated from high school there and immediately enlisted into the @USArmy, just at the end of #WorldWarII.
Months before the 24th Inf. Regt. was deactivated, though, 21-year-old Sgt. Cornelius Charlton gave his last full measure of devotion to the country.
This came during the #KoreanWar, which also became the first war since the #AmericanRevolution to see black Soldiers fighting alongside white Soldiers in the same units.
Sgt. Cornelius Charlton was a member of the @USArmy's all-black 24th Infantry Regiment, @25ID, one of the last segregated units to engage in combat.

A Korean Mountain Ash was planted behind the bench on June 15, 1989.
The bench is located in Section 48 on the north side of the #MemorialAmphitheater beside a Korean White Pine tree that was donated by President Kim of Korea in 1965. The pine tree was replaced by President Roh Tae Woo on Oct. 17, 1989.
The day chosen, July 27, was significant because #OnThisDay in 1953, the #KoreanWar armistice was signed in Panmunjom, ending three years of fighting.
#OnThisDay in 1987, a #KoreanWar Contemplative Bench was dedicated to honor the more than 5.7 million U.S. service members who served in the Korean War on the battle lines, in the air, or in support of those whose lives were at risk.		#HonorRememberExplore		(@USArmy file photo) https://t.co/E0u2ksdv1A

Although it was years before the services effectively integrated, national cemeteries throughout the country adopted the policy immediately and disbanded burial segregation regulation in 1948.
The new policy was to go into effect "as rapidly as possible, having due regard to the time required to effectuate any necessary changes without impairing efficiency or morale."
Executive Order 9981 stated "that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin."
Arlington National Cemetery was established in 1864, and for more than 80 years African-Americans were buried separately from white service members.
#OnThisDay in 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981, which ended segregation in the @DeptofDefense.		#ThrowbackThursday #TBT #HonorRememberExplore 		(Newspaper cover courtesy of the @LibraryCongress) https://t.co/KJY4Ks1AiL

William J. Brennan is laid to rest with his first and second wives, Marjorie Leonard Brennan and Mary Fowler Brennan in Section 5, Grave 40-1.	   	#HonorThem
Justice David Souter, who succeeded William J. Brennan to the high court, said that 'One can agree with the Brennan opinions and one may disagree with them, but their collective influence is an enormously powerful defining force in the contemporary life of this republic.'
William J. Brennan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.
In an essay published in 1997, William J. Brennan wrote, 'The genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it may have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and present needs.'
After William J. Brennan himself retired following a debilitating stroke, he continued to espouse his judicial philosophy.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave William J. Brennan a recess appointment to the #SupremeCourt on Oct. 16, 1956, to succeed Justice Sherman Minton, who was retiring for health reasons. The Senate confirmed the appointment March 19, 1957, by voice vote.
After #WorldWarII, William J. Brennan returned to his practice, specializing in labor law, but took an appointment to a state court in 1949. Three years later the Republican governor appointed him to the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Attending law school on a scholarship, William J. Brennan completed his education and practiced law in Newark, New Jersey, until entering the @USArmy in 1942. He rose to the rank of colonel, handling labor disputes while serving on the staff of the secretary of war.
William J. Brennan was renowned for his persistence in building consensus, employing civility and persuasive reason to sway others to his view.
William J. Brennan's view of the role of the court led to decisions that expanded the rights of racial minorities and women, fostered protections for free speech, and led to reapportionment of voting districts along the 'one person, one vote' principle.
William J. Brennan was one of the most influential members of the #SupremeCourt, authoring more than 1,360 opinions during his 34 years on the Supreme Court.

#DIdYouKnow that from 1799 until 1921, the Marine Corps celebrated its birthday, or #MarineCorpsDay, on July 11? 		It was in 1921 when the date was permanently changed to Nov. 10 to commemorate the establishment of the Corps to aid in the #RevolutionaryWar.
After success in many campaigns, the Corps was abolished at the close of the #RevolutionaryWar for reasons of economy.
The #MarineCorps was established on Nov. 10, 1775, to augment naval forces in the #RevolutionaryWar. 		The recruiting headquarters was set up by Capt. Samuel Nicholas in the Tun Tavern on Water Street in Philadelphia, which is considered to be the birthplace of the #Marines.
#OnThisDay in 1798, Congress ordered the creation of the @USMC, named it the United States Marine Corps and directed that it be available for service under the Secretary of the @USNavy.		#HonorRememberExplore		(@USArmy photo of the #MarineCorps War Memorial by Elizabeth Fraser) https://t.co/i9D2UAOqZ8

It was #OnThisDay in 1941 that Ignacy Jan Paderewski was temporarily interred in the vault of the Mast of the #USSMaine Memorial. 		It wasn't until 51 years later on June 26, 1992, that Paderewski's remains were returned to Poland.
Ignacy Jan Paderewski was not eligible for below-ground interment in #ArlingtonNationalCemetery or in any other national cemetery because he never served in the armed forces of the United States or any nations allied with the United States in #WorldWarI or #WorldWarII.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, 'He may lie there until Poland is free.'		#WorldWarII

On May 7, 1949 Gen. Hap Arnold was appointed the first general of the Air Force, five-star rank, by Congress. He died at his ranch home, Valley of the Moon, near Sonoma, California, Jan. 15, 1950. 		His name is perpetuated at the @AEDCnews at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee.
During his long career, Gen. Hap Arnold wrote a number of books, including early boys' books to create interest among youth in flying, and the post-#WorldWarII autobiography "Global Mission," an accurate account of @USAirForce activities in the war and his own life.
Gen. Hap Arnold retired from the service June 30, 1946, after earning three Distinguished Service crosses, the Distinguished Flying  Cross, Air Medal and decorations from Morocco, Brazil, Yugoslavia, Peru,  France, Mexico and Great Britain.
In March 1943 Gen. Hap Arnold was promoted to four-star general. He suffered a heart  attack in 1945 as the war drew to a close, attributed by his doctors to overwork.
Early in 1943 Gen. Hap Arnold made a 35,000-mile tour of North Africa, Middle East, India and China, and attended the Casablanca Conferences.
Prior to and all during #WorldWarII, he directed air activities for the nation's global war against Germany and Japan. Under him the air arm grew from 22,000 officers and men with 3,900 planes to nearly 2,500,000 men and 75,000 aircraft.
Gen. Hap Arnold 's title was changed to chief of the Army Air Forces on June 30, 1941, and that December he got a third star. When the War Department General Staff was organized in March 1942 Arnold became commanding general of U.S. Army Air Forces.
In January 1936 he became assistant to the chief of Air Corps in Washington and on Sept. 29, 1938 was promoted to major general and appointed chief of Air Corps.
Gen. Hap Arnold was gaining a reputation as a bomber man, having encouraged development of the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator four-engine planes, and the precision training of crewmembers.
In February 1935 Gen. Hap Arnold was jumped two grades to brigadier general and put in command of the 1st Wing of General Headquarters Air Force at March Field, California.
In July and August 1934 Gen. Hap Arnold personally organized and led a flight of 10  Martin B-10 bombers in a round-trip record flight from Washington, D.C.,  to Fairbanks, Alaska, and next year received his second Mackay Trophy for this achievement.
Gen. Hap Arnold was promoted to lieutenant colonel in February 1931 as commanding officer of March Field, California.
In June 1929 Gen. Hap Arnold completed the Command and General Staff School at @FortLeavenworth and was assigned as commanding officer of the air depot at Fairfield, Ohio.
Gen. Hap Arnold devotedly shared Mitchell's beliefs in the strategic capability of the airplane and urged an independent air arm which Arnold lived to see authorized in 1947. 		He next went to @FortRiley, Kansas, where he commanded Air Corps troops at Marshall Field until 1928.
Gen. Hap Arnold testified on behalf of Gen. Billy Mitchell during the famed courts-martial in the fall of 1925 when Mitchell was found guilty of insubordination.
Gen. Hap Arnold graduated from the Army Industrial College in 1925 and became chief of the Information Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps.
In June 1920 Gen. Hap Arnold went back to captain's grade, but next month was promoted to major, where he remained until 1931. In October 1922 he became commanding officer of Rockwell Field, California, serving two years.
Gen. Hap Arnold went to France in November 1918 at war's end on an inspection tour of aviation activities. He returned in January 1919 as supervisor of the Air Service at Coronado, California, and as air officer of the 9th Corps Area at the Presidio at San Francisco.
Gen. Hap Arnold was in charge of Information Service in the Aviation Division of the Signal Corps. When the Office of Military Aeronautics was created, Arnold became assistant executive officer and in February 1918 was named assistant director.
In February 1917 Gen. Hap Arnold went to Panama to organize an air service there, which he commanded until May 1917. As the U.S. entered #WorldWarI, he was called back to Washington, promoted to major June 17, 1917, and on Aug. 5 was promoted to full colonel.
Gen. Hap Arnold stayed there until March 1916 and came home for two months at Madison  Barracks, New York, before going back to aviation duties in May 1916,  with promotion to captain and duty at the new flying school at San  Diego, California.
In September 1913 Gen. Hap Arnold went back to the 13th Infantry.
In November 1912 Gen. Hap Arnold was assigned to the Office of the Chief Signal Officer in Washington, where he was promoted to first lieutenant in April 1913.
During the latter part of 1912 Gen. Hap Arnold went to @FortRiley, Kansas, as an aerial observer of Field Artillery firing and was the first military aviator to use radio to report his observations.
Gen. Hap Arnold flew the early type of Wright biplane with its 40 horsepower engine revolving two propellers by the chain-and-sprocket method.
On Oct. 9, 1912, Gen. Hap Arnold won the first MacKay Trophy ever awarded for a reconnaissance flight on a triangular course from College Park to Washington Barracks, D.C. to Fort Myer, Virginia, and return to College Park.
On June 1, 1912, Gen. Hap Arnold established a new altitude record by piloting a Burgess-Wright airplane to a height of 6,540 feet. He also took part in air maneuvers in New York and Connecticut and set several records.
Gen. Hap Arnold then was assigned to teach other flyers at the Signal Corps aviation school at College Park, Maryland. The school was moved to Augusta, Georgia, November, and he served there until April 1912 when he went back to College Park for flight duty.
The Wright brothers, who had made their first flight in 1903, personally instructed Gen. Hap Arnold for two months, after which he soloed and became one of the earliest military aviators in June 1911.
Gen. Hap Arnold returned home for two-and-a-half-years' duty at Governors Island, New  York, until April 1911 when he was detailed to the Signal Corps and  sent to Dayton, Ohio, for instructions in the Wright biplane.
Gen. Hap Arnold initially was assigned to the 29th Infantry, serving with it in the Philippine Islands for two years.
Three years later, by act of #Congress, Gen. Hap Arnold received permanent five-star rank as general of the @USAirForce, the first such commission ever granted.
From then on Gen. Hap Arnold's life paralleled the growth of America's air power and he personally contributed to most of the major milestones of development during the long period until he retired in 1946.
"Hap" Arnold, as he was fondly known and called, dating from his early days at #WestPoint, was in the class of 1907 at @WestPoint_USMA.

#DidYouKnow when the United States entered #WorldWarII, 50,000 @USCoastGuardAux members joined the war effort as military teams? 		Many of their private vessels were placed into service in an effort to protect the U.S.
The @USCoastGuardAux has units in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam.
Passage of this act designated the Reserve as a military branch of the active service, while the civilian section, formerly referred to as the Coast Guard Reserve, became the Auxiliary under title 14, chapter 23 of the USC.
Two years later, on Feb. 19, Congress amended the 1939 act with passage of the Auxiliary and Reserve Act of 1941.
When the Coast Guard "Reserve" was authorized by act of Congress on #OnThisDay in 1939, the @USCG was given a legislative mandate to use civilian to promote safety on and over the high seas and the nation's navigable waters.
Happy Birthday to the @USCoastGuardAux!		Pictured are members of the @USCG Ceremonial Honor Guard waiting for the start of a wreath-laying ceremony at the Coast Guard Memorial, Nov. 11, 2015. 		(@USArmy photo by Rachel Larue, Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/Lsg91B2tPr

The radio frequency mass spectrometer was developed in 1950. It was first launched into space on the #SputnikIII to measure the masses of atoms. 		It was the only space instrument used by the Russians and credited to a U.S. inventor in their own Russian-language publications.
It also reproduced intricate impact patterns found on the earth's surface which explained many features of the polar aurora.
In the 1950s, Lt. Col. Willard Bennett's experimental tube called the Stormertron predicted and modeled the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the earth six years before they were discovered by satellite.
Lt. Col. Willard Bennett made scientific history in the 1930s pioneering studies in plasma physics. These studies have been used throughout the world in controlled thermonuclear fusion research.
Following service in #WorldWarII, Lt. Col. Willard Bennett worked at the National Bureau of Standards (now the @usnistgov), the @UArkansas, and the @USNRL. 		In 1961, he was appointed Burlington Professor of Physics at @ncstate (emeritus in 1976).
Born in Findlay, Ohio, Lt. Col. Willard Bennett attended @CarnegieMellon's Institute of Technology and @OhioState University. 		He received his master's from the @UWMadison in 1926 and his Ph.D. from the @UMich in 1928. 		In 1930 he joined the Physics faculty at Ohio State.

Maj. Audie L. Murphy is laid to rest in Section 46, Grave 366-11.	   	#HonorThem	   	(@USArmy photo by Rachel Larue, Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/RK6F4nA6jH

At the end of a row of graves, his tomb is marked by a simple, white, government-issue tombstone, which lists only a few of his many military decorations. 		The stone is, as he was, too small.
Audie Murphy is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, just across Memorial Drive from the #MemorialAmphitheater. A special flagstone walkway has been constructed to accommodate the large number of people who stop to pay their respects to this hero.
Murphy, who once said that he could only sleep with a loaded pistol under his pillow, was haunted by nightmares of his wartime experiences throughout his adult life. In 1971, at the age of 46, he died in the crash of a private plane near Roanoke, Virginia.
After nearly 20 years he retired from acting and started a career in private business. But the venture was unsuccessful, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in 1968.
Many film critics, however, believe his best performance was in Red Badge of Courage, Stephen Crane's #CivilWar epic.
Nevertheless, he went on to make more than 40 films. His first part was just a small one in Beyond Glory in 1948. 		The following year he published his wartime memoirs, To Hell and Back, which received good reviews. Later he portrayed himself in the 1955 movie version.
Still very shy and unassuming, Murphy arrived in Hollywood with only his good looks and — by his own account — "no talent."
Audie Murphy returned to a hero's welcome in the United States. 		His photograph appeared on the cover of @Life magazine and he was persuaded by actor James Cagney to embark on an acting career.
Murphy had been wounded three times during the war, yet, in May 1945, when victory was declared in Europe, he had still not reached his 21st birthday.
By the war's end, Murphy had become the nation's most-decorated soldier, earning an unparalleled 28 medals, including three from France and one from Belgium.
His courageous performance stalled the German advance and allowed him to lead his men in the counterattack which ultimately drove the enemy from Holtzwihr. For this Murphy was awarded the #MedalOfHonor, the nation's highest award for gallantry in action.
Wounded in the leg during the heavy fire, Murphy remained there for  nearly an hour, repelling the attack of German soldiers on three sides  and single-handedly killing 50 of them.
Alone, he mounted an abandoned burning tank destroyer and, with a single machine gun, contested the enemy's advance.
On Jan. 26, 1945, near the village of Holtzwihr in eastern France, Murphy's forward positions came under fierce attack by the Germans. 		Against the onslaught of six Panzer tanks and 250 infantrymen, Murphy ordered his men to fall back to better their defenses.
But his biggest test was yet to come.
Shortly thereafter his unit was withdrawn to train for Operation Anvil-Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. During 7 weeks of fighting in that successful campaign, Murphy's division suffered 4,500 casualties, and he became one of the most decorated men in his company.
Throughout these campaigns, Murphy's skills earned him advancements in  rank, because many of his superior officers were being transferred, wounded or killed.		After the capture of Rome, Murphy earned his first decoration for gallantry.
He landed at Salerno to fight in the Voltuno river campaign and then at Anzio to be part of the Allied force that fought its way to Rome.
It was there in 1943 that he first saw combat, proving himself to be a  proficient marksman and highly skilled soldier, consistently his performance demonstrated how well he understood the techniques of small-unit action.
Following basic training Murphy was assigned to the 15th Regiment, @3rd_Infantry Division in North Africa preparing to invade Sicily. 		#RockOfTheMarne
Not tall enough to meet the minimum requirements, he tried to enlist in the paratroopers, but again was denied entrance. 		Despondent, he chose the infantry.
War had just been declared and, like so many other young men, Murphy lied about his age in his attempt to enlist. 		But it was not his age that kept him out of the Marines; it was his size.
Left at a very young age to help raise 10 brothers and sisters when his father deserted their mother, Audie was 16 when his mother died. He watched as his siblings were doled out to an orphanage or relatives. 		Seeking an escape from that life in 1942, he looked to the #Marines.
He was Audie Murphy, the baby-faced Texas farmboy who was born #OnThisDay in 1924. He became a U.S. legend. 		Murphy grew up on a sharecropper's farm in Hunt County, Texas.
He wanted to join the @USMC, but he was too short. 		The paratroopers wouldn't have him either. 		Reluctantly, he settled on the infantry, enlisting to become nothing less than one of the most-decorated heroes of #WorldWarII.	   	(#USArmy photo) https://t.co/SOyUdeIbxB

#OnThisDay in 1865, @USArmy Major Gen. Gordon Granger led Union soldiers into Galveston, Texas, with news that the #CivilWar had ended and slavery was abolished - two years after the #EmancipationProclamation.
#Juneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States.
Existing for more than 30 years, Freedman's Village provided housing, education, training for employment, medical care and food for former slaves.		(Image courtesy of @ArlingtonVALib) https://t.co/0oPYZt2Bz1
The village was run by the Freedmen's Bureau during most of its existence, and at one point employed U.S. Colored Troops (African-Americans who served in segregated @USArmy regiments during the war) to protect fugitive slaves from their former slave owners.
Arlington Estate was selected as the site because of its location outside of Washington D.C. where camps were overcrowded and in poor condition. More than 1,100 freed slaves lived at Freedman's Village where they farmed and lived during and after the #CivilWar.
"Contrabands" was used by the U.S. government to designate slaves who were freed as Union forces moved South, or who had escaped from local Virginia and Maryland slave owners.
In honor of #Juneteenth, today we are highlighting Freedman's Village, which was established on the southeast portion of the Arlington Estate in June 1863, as a camp for #CivilWar "Contrabands."		#HonorRememberExplore		(Map courtesy of Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/fBxYYr7ljn

Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs himself was later buried within 100 yards of Arlington House with his wife, father and son; the final statement to his original order.
A stone and masonry burial vault in the rose garden, 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and containing the remains of 1,800 #BullRun casualties, was among the first monuments to Union dead erected under Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs' orders.
Upon the authority of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army, appropriated the grounds for use as a military cemetery. At the time, he commanded the garrison at #ArlingtonHouse.

Mourned nationally, Medgar Evers was buried on June 19, 1963, in #ArlingtonNationalCemetery and received full military honors in front of a crowd of more than 2,000 people.
Medgar Evers carried the title of @NAACP field secretary for the state of Mississippi when he was tragically gunned down in his driveway at the hands of a white supremacist.
Medgar Evers was a #WorldWarII veteran, a student athlete, a distinguished Mississippi businessman and a pioneer of the civil rights movement. He participated in numerous causes in the name of equal rights and justice.

#DidYouKnow the U.S. military developed its own superior code machine - SIGABA - before entering the war?		No one was able to break that one.
While controversial for its secrecy, the decoding process has been widely credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives and shortening the war by nearly two years.
Breaking Germany's codes, and later those of the Japanese, proved to be a huge advantage for the Allies.
On #DDay itself, it also helped Allied commanders get word of their troops' progress quicker than through their own communication channels.
Officials said the German codes intercepted before #DDay precisely pinpointed nearly all of the German fighting units in the Normandy area.
Instead of telling the world about it, though, leaders thought the device would be more useful if kept secret. So for years, German plans were hindered by the decrypted messages, including on #DDay.
Early in the war, a team of Polish and British experts - led by Alan Turing, whose life and work are depicted in the Oscar-winning movie "The Imitation Game" - cracked that code through what became the foundation for the modern computer.
The Germans had Enigma, which was thought to be unbreakable - until it wasn't.
Long story short, since radio was the standard communication of the time, the Allies and the Axis powers both needed machines to turn military plans into secret codes.
Decoding the great German code machine known as Enigma, then keeping that decoding device a secret, is one of the most brilliant strategies that came out of #WorldWarII.
5 - Decoding "Enigma" helped us win. 		An Enigma decryption machine, called a "bombe." This machine, made by National Cash Register of Dayton, Ohio, eliminated all possible encryptions from intercepted messages until it arrived at the correct solution. 		(@USAirForce photo https://t.co/cNVEBESFmF
Somehow, though, both sectors of U.S. troops managed to advance their positions for overall success.
Rough surf caused huge problems for the amphibious tanks launched at sea; only two of 29 made it to shore, while many of the infantrymen who stormed off the boats were gunned down by Germans. Gen. Omar Bradley, who led the Omaha forces, nearly considered abandoning the operation.
The Omaha offensive turned out to be the bloodiest of the day, largely in part because Army intelligence underestimated the German stronghold there.
Many also missed their landing spots, as did the seaborne forces, which landed more than a mile from their intended destination, thanks to strong currents.
Thousands of U.S. paratroopers were injured or killed during their drop behind enemy lines at Utah Beach, having been shot out of the sky by enemy fire or weighed down and drowned in flooded marshlands.
4 - #DDay was almost a tactical failure. 		While the ultimate goal of liberating France and ousting the Germans did happen, a lot went wrong on D-Day - especially for the U.S., who were the first to launch the invasion.
Three other beach invasions by Allied troops happened simultaneously: Great Britain and some smaller forces stormed Gold and Sword beaches, while the Canadians took Juno Beach.
Stories of how U.S. troops stormed the beaches of Normandy are legendary, with the names Omaha Beach and Utah Beach standing out in people's minds. 		But the invasion stretched out over 50 miles of land, so we couldn't do it alone.
3 - We only stormed two of the five beaches. 		Members of a U.S. landing party lend helping hands to other service members whose landing craft was sunk by enemy action off the coast of Normandy. 		(File photo) https://t.co/95EUmHrgtb
Only nine days in May and June seemed to fit those requirements, so commanders eventually settled on June 5; however, thanks to forecasts that showed a short window of good weather that day, Gen. Eisenhower decided last-minute to switch #DDay to the early hours of June 6.
H-Hour was also crucial in that it relied on those tides to be rising at that time. There also had to be an hour of daylight just beforehand for bombardment accuracy.
The day needed to be long for maximum air power usage; a near-full moon was needed to help guide ships and airborne troops; and the tides had to be strong enough to expose beach obstacles at low tide and float supply-filled landing vehicles far onto the beach during high tide.
A lot of weather-related requirements were necessary to pull #DDay off.
2 - #DDay was initially set for one day earlier. 		(Map courtesy of @USArmy Transportation Museum) https://t.co/giis177btO
He said there were actually several other D-Days during the war - Normandy was just the biggest and most well-known.
"Be advised that any amphibious operation has a 'departed date;' therefore the shortened term 'D-Day' is used."
While the true meaning remains up for debate, we'll go with what @USArmy Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said about it through his executive assistant, Brig. Gen. Robert Schultz:
Many experts have varying opinions, including that the D simply stood for "day," a code used for any important military operation. Others have said it's just alliteration, like "H-Hour," when a military assault begins.

1 - Do you actually know what #DDay stands for? 		Apparently it's the most frequently asked question at the @WWIIMuseum, but the answer isn't overly simple.
The bravery by the paratroopers and Soldiers who stormed Normandy that day is well-known, but here are five things you may not have known. 		#DDay
It ended with heavy casualties - more than 9,000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded in those first 24 hours - but #DDay is largely considered the successful beginning of the end of Hitler's tyrannical regime.
.@USArmy Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower gives the orders for #DDay - "full victory - nothing else" - to paratroopers in England just before they board their airplanes to participate in the first assault in the Invasion of Normandy. 		(@USNatArchives photo) https://t.co/FiJph9yjdj
#OnThisDay in 1944, more than 160,000 Allied forces landed in Nazi-occupied France as part of the biggest air, land and sea invasion ever executed.
D-Day. The Invasion of Normandy. Operation Overlord. It goes by various names, but we've all heard about it through history class, grandparents, the news or shows like "Band of Brothers."		#DDay		(@USCG photo) https://t.co/FCVbsTARO8
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy is laid to rest in Section 45, Grave S-45-A. 		#HonorThem
#DidYouKnow Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's funeral is the only one to ever take place at night at Arlington National Cemetery?
The procession stopped once during the drive to Arlington National Cemetery at the #LincolnMemorial where the @MarineBand played "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." 		The funeral motorcade arrived at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery at 10:30 p.m.
The long transport delayed the arrival at Union Station until 9:10 p.m., and officials here at Arlington National Cemetery quickly changed the funeral plans to accommodate an evening interment.
The remains were then transported upon a slow-moving train to Washington, D.C. 		The railway system stopped all northbound traffic between @WashingtonDC, and New York, and many people gathered along the route to pay tribute to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
The funeral mass for Sen. Robert F. Kennedy took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City, Saturday, June 8, 1968.
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, former attorney general, presidential candidate, and brother of former President John F. Kennedy, was shot on June 5, 1968, and died the next morning.
Earlier today, friends and family of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy hosted a memorial service at the cemetery to honor him on the 50th anniversary of his assassination.

Every year in May, hundreds of motorcyclists ride in one of three routes that cross the country, ending in the nation's capital and stopping at  war memorials, veterans' hospitals and schools on the way.
They talked to local radio, TV and newspapers about the thousands of men and women still unaccounted for from all wars.
.@RunForTheWall is an annual ride that honors those who did not return home from wars. It was started in 1989 by James Gregory and Bill Evans, two #VietnamWar veterans who traveled across the heartland of the United States on motorcycles.
#WatchNow: Earlier today, more than 400 motorcyclists participating in @RunForTheWall drove onto the cemetery grounds and participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the #TombOfTheUnknownSoldier.		#MemorialDay #HonorThem		(@USArmy video courtesy of Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/AECvaizNJv
More than 300 #VetCenters across the country and 80 #MobileVetCenters provide eligible veterans with support when and where they need it.
One is parked at the main entrance on Memorial Avenue, and the other is parked at Marshall and York drives (corner of Section 60 and Columbarium Court 2). There's also a table set up in Section 60. They're open from 8 a.m.-6 p.m.

These #MemorialDay ceremonies, rooted in 150 years of tradition, ensure that the United States will never forget those who died in the armed forces and  the country for which they served.	   	  #HonorThem
Every year, during #MemorialDay weekend, cemeteries across the globe honor service members who perished in the line of duty.
For many years, #MemorialDay commemorations both domestically and overseas took place on May 30. 		In 1968 Congress passed, and President Lyndon Johnson signed, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. This legislation established the observance of Memorial Day on the last Monday in May.
As the meaning of #DecorationDay evolved, so did the name. By the late 19th century, many Americans were using the term #MemorialDay.
Over the years, the meaning of #DecorationDay evolved, gradually expanding from a commemoration of #CivilWar dead, into a day to honor fallen members of the American armed forces from all wars.
(That May 30), 1868 is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in the defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet churchyard in the land.
The national observance of #DecorationDay, in part, is traced to an order by Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, a fraternal organization of #CivilWar Union veterans. On May 5, 1868, Logan instructed members of the GAR that:
On both sides of the #CivilWar conflict, north and south, families and brothers-in-arms of the fallen came together in grassroots commemorations to lay flowers on the graves of the dead, in honor of their sacrifice. 		This day of remembrance was initially known as #DecorationDay.
#DidYouKnow that #MemorialDay, the federal holiday in which we honor those who died while in the armed services, originated in the aftermath of the #CivilWar?		#HonorThem		(@USArmy painting by Ellen White, courtesy of @USArmyCMH) https://t.co/Lm9G7ZgS26

The memorial was re-dedicated on its 85th anniversary after a thorough restoration.
At the foot of the pyramid is a bronze seagull, made by famed sculptor Gaston Lachaise, to exemplify the zeal and persistence of the @USCG in its duties. Below that is the #CoastGuard motto Semper Paratus, or "Always Ready."
Designed by architect George Howe, each side of the memorial is inscribed with the names of Coast Guardsmen lost at sea during #WWI.
The first occurred 9/17/1918, when 11 shipmates from @USCG Cutter Seneca perished when the torpedoed UK steamer they were assisting sank in the Bay of Biscay. Just 9 days later, Cutter Tampa was sunk by enemy submarine UB-91 in the British Channel, and all on board were lost.
#OnThisDay in 1928, the U.S. Coast Guard Memorial was dedicated. Sitting atop a hill in Section 4 of Arlington National Cemetery, this memorial is dedicated to two tragic episodes in @USCG #WorldWarI history.		#WWI100 #HonorRememberExplore		(@USArmy photo by Elizabeth Fraser) https://t.co/KVSvsIb6Aq

That way, our field operations team will not run them over while using machinery, which could cause damage to equipment or harm someone. 		It helps keep Arlington National Cemetery a safe place to work and visit.
If you are planning on leaving a coin at a headstone here at Arlington (or any cemetery), please place them on top of a headstone instead of throwing them.
This is why you will also see coins left on graves of non-military members, and why many members of the general public will leave coins in any denomination (often what they have on hand) on headstones of loved ones, historical figures, or a headstone that caught their eye.
The tradition of leaving coins is not limited to the military though; it has become a way for anyone to show that they were thinking of someone.
A penny means you know someone who was associated with the deceased (relative). A nickel means they trained with the deceased. A dime says they served with the deceased. A quarter means they were present or assigned with the deceased when they lost their life.
Within the military, there is a tradition of leaving coins on headstones of deceased service members to show respect and remembrance. 		Different coins can mean different things.

During his service, Maj. Fred Ohr earned the #SilverStar twice, the #DistinguishedFlyingCross twice, a #BronzeStar Medal and the #AirMedal 19 times.
After #WWII ended, Maj. Fred Ohr returned to college in California. He studied at UCBerkley and Northwestern Dental School in Chicago. He established a career as a dental surgeon in Chicago.		(Photo courtesy of https://t.co/zFNVhK9Ixv) https://t.co/ZuIAADgVIn
Maj. Fred Ohr served with: 2nd Fighter Squadron, 52nd Fighter Group; 116th Cavalry Regiment, @IDNationalGuard; 183rd Field Artillery; 115th Cavalry; 12th Air Force; 15th Air Force; and 68th Material Service Squadron.
Maj. Fred Ohr scored his first aerial combat victory flying a Spitfire in 1943. The rest of his victories came after the group transitioned to P-51s in 1944. 		He ended his tour of duty as the squadron's commanding officer.
Maj. Fred Ohr was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1919, and became an aviation cadet in 1941. 		During #WorldWarII, he was later assigned to the 2nd Fighter Squadron, 52nd Fighter Group in North Africa and Sicily as a fighter pilot flying Spitfires.

Cmdr. Elmer Stone is laid to rest not far from the #CoastGuardMemorial in Section 4, Grave 3205-A.		#HonorThem
Information for this thread courtesy of https://t.co/HcLq0uEQJA.
For his service, Cmdr. Elmer Stone earned the #NavyCross, the @RoyalAirForce Cross, the Congressional Gold Medal and Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword.
At one @USCG air station stands a monument to him, with the apt quotation: "A prophet is not without honor." Eccentric perhaps, and something of a trial for his seniors, but he left behind a rich tradition, the foundation for morale for #CoastGuard aviators who follow him.
Cmdr. Elmer Stone is now recognized to have been ahead of his time in many things to the extent that he did not receive the deserved support of more conservative officers.
One officer who knew Cmdr. Elmer Stone well describes him as "pop-eyed, bushy-haired, stub-nosed, careless of dress but as alert as a terrier; a man who cared little for the form, but much for the matter."
Cmdr. Elmer Stone’s uncanny foresight and ability in aviation, his fine qualities of leadership, made him respected and beloved by all who served under him.
Cmdr. Elmer Stone was the @USCG’s first aviator and the pilot of the NC-4 on the first successful trans-Atlantic flight in May 1919, eight years before Charles Lindbergh’s famous solo crossing in the Spirit of Saint Louis.

The history of our nation can be seen every day – America's heroes are buried here from every American conflict, from the #RevolutionaryWar to the conflicts of the 21st century.
What was once created out of necessity during the #CivilWar, Arlington National Cemetery is a national shrine for hundreds of thousands active duty military members, veterans and their families who have served during times of war and times of peace.
A little over a month later, on June 15, 1864, the cemetery was established as a national cemetery.
#OnThisDay in 1864, @USArmy Pvt. William Christman was the first military service member to be buried at the cemetery. 		He is laid to rest in Section 27, Grave 19.		#HonorThem		(File photo courtesy of Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/6FbIYOYcp9

From the Arlington National Cemetery family to yours, Happy #MothersDay.
The Mother’s Tree was dedicated May 8, 1932, and its plaque is the oldest memorial tree marker remaining in the cemetery. 		The tree has been replaced with a river birch, the only species of birch resistant to the bronze birch borer insect pest.
Not far from the #TombOfTheUnknownSoldier, along Memorial Drive, is a memorial tree known as the Mother’s Tree and is dedicated to the Mother of the Unknown Soldier.		#MothersDay #HonorRememberExplore		(@USArmy photos by Elizabeth Fraser, Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/ahBtYfn8x9

The honors joined a host of others earned as a naval aviator including the Navy Distinguished Flying Cross, the Navy Commendation Medal with Valor, the Navy Unit Citation, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star, among others.
Capt. Michael J. Smith was awarded the Space Medal of Honor and the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, as well as promotion to the rank of captain, all posthumously.
The mission was to deploy a communications satellite intended to form part of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. Something went terribly wrong 73 seconds into the Challenger's 10th flight and the space shuttle exploded on live television before a shocked nation.
During his time at @NASA, Capt. Michael J. Smith served in a variety of capacities. Five years later, on a cold January day in Florida, Capt. Michael J. Smith was ready for his first space flight onboard the Space Shuttle #Challenger.
In May of 1980, Capt. Michael J. Smith got his chance to pursue his ultimate dream and was selected as an astronaut candidate by the @NASA. He completed his one year training and evaluation period in August 1981, qualifying him for assignment as a pilot on a space shuttle.
In 1969, as astronaut Neil Armstrong made fame with his “…small step for  man, giant leap for mankind” walk on the moon, Capt. Michael J. Smith received his naval  aviator wings of gold.
Capt. Michael J. Smith went on to graduate with a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the @NPS_Monterey in California.
Rather than considering a career as a commercial pilot, Capt. Michael J. Smith decided he would challenge himself as a naval aviator. He was accepted  to the @NavalAcademy where he graduated in 1967 with degree in Naval  Science.
Capt. Michael J. Smith grew up in Beaufort, North Carolina, during the 1950s and 60s, intrigued by watching the planes landing and taking off from the airstrip adjacent to his family’s farm. Even then he knew what he wanted, he wanted to fly.
Also killed were Gregory B. Jarvis, S. Christa McAuliffe, Dr. Ronald E.  McNair, @USAirForce Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka, Dr. Judith A. Resnik, and #AirForce Lt. Col. Francis R. "Dick" Scobee.
Capt. Michael J. Smith was one of the seven crew members aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger when it exploded Jan. 28, 1986, shortly after takeoff.

One of Laura Benét poems, Fairy Bread, was named among the best poetry books of 1921 by the @NYTimes. She collaborated with artist Prentiss Taylor on a number of illustrated poetry broadsides, many of which are now among the @LibraryCongress' rare books and special collections.
Laura Benét wrote biographies of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, and a biographical novel about Emily Dickinson.
Though Laura Benét spent her career in the shadows of her famous family—brothers William Rose and Stephen Vincent Benét and sister-in-law Elinor Wylie were all poets—she was herself a poet as well, journalist, and biographer.

Designed by British architect Sir Reginald Blomfield, the monument consists of a bronze sword adorning a 24-foot gray granite cross.
On June 12, 1925, President Calvin Coolidge approved the request, and on Armistice Day 1927 the monument near the #MemorialAmphitheater (in Section 46) was dedicated.
Because the Canadians entered the war long before the United States, many Americans enlisted in Canada to join the fighting in Europe.
It was in this spirit of friendship that in 1925 @Canada’s Prime Minister MacKenzie King first proposed a memorial to the large number of United States citizens who enlisted in @CanadianForces, and lost their lives during #WorldWarI.
Few countries enjoy the bonds of goodwill and friendship that the United States and @Canada share. 		Our common border remains the longest unguarded frontier on earth, and our nations have shared triumphs and tragedies throughout history.

The #Empress tree is known for its extremely large leaves and pale violet flowers, which typically appear in late spring.
Following its introduction to the U.S., the #Empress tree has become popular because of its highly decorative floral blooms as well as its ability to grow extremely quickly.
According to @Yale University's Nature Walk, the empress tree, also commonly known as the foxglvoe, princess, or kiri tree, originated from western and central China.
Our #Empress tree, or Paulownia tomentosa, is a state champion tree located in Section 46, near Gravesite 305.
The Virginia Big Tree Program is managed by @Virginia_Tech.
If two trees score within five points of each other, they are designated co-champions.
In order to be considered a champion, co-champion, or to make the #Top5 list for a tree species, the tree needs to rank highest with regards to tree height, crown spread, and trunk circumference.
In honor of #ArborDay coming up (observed nationally the last Friday in April), today we're highlighting one of the cemetery's five Virginia state champion and co-champion trees: the #Empress.		(@USArmy photo by Rachel Larue, Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/heaCLccWQx

The @USArmy's Quartermaster Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs recognized the poem's solemn appeal and directed that lines from "Bivouac" grace the then-entrance to Arlington National Cemetery.		#HonorRememberExplore
Even though the poem was written about the #MexicanWar, nearly a decade later, the poem captivated the attention of a patriotic nation and would continue to do so for decades to come.
Theodore O'Hara's military service bridged the period from the #MexicanWar, whose action inspired the poem, to the #CivilWar, which led him to places where some of the first cemeteries were created.
#NationalPoetryMonth was inaugurated by @poetsorg in 1996.

This was based on a percentage of his winnings, as a manager's fee would be computed, but the #IRS considered it to be alimony, ruling that Joe Louis owed taxes and penalties. 		He knew only one way to earn that kind of money, so he returned to the ring Sept. 27, 1950.
Joe Louis retired from boxing March 1, 1949, but then the @IRSnews assessed Louis more than $1 million in back taxes and penalties. This arose as a result of a divorce settlement in which Louis agreed to pay his ex-wife a portion of the purse from his biggest fight, $650k.
During the war, Joe Louis fought 96 exhibition matches before more than two million troops. He also donated more than $100,000 to Navy and Army relief efforts.

Of the 129 @USNavy Sailors and civilian employees killed in the disaster, 24 have memorial markers at Arlington National Cemetery.		#HonorThem
The #SUBSAFE program does this by enforcing a set of stringent quality processes and material control requirements beginning in the design phase and enforced throughout the submarine's entire service life.
This tragic loss led directly to the establishment of the #SUBSAFE program, which is known worldwide as a model for safety and quality assurance. The SUBSAFE program works to ensure that submarines do not experience flooding events; if they do, they have the ability to surface.
#OnThisDay in 1963, the #USSThresher sank off the coast of Massachusetts during a deep-diving test, making it the first nuclear-powered submarine lost at sea and the largest loss of life in the submarine force's history. 		#HonorThem		(Photo courtesy of @USNHistory) https://t.co/oXc5mw3bSV
All five brothers have Memorial Markers next to each other in Section MC, Sites 30-34, on Porter Drive.	   	#HonorThem
Since the tragic loss of the Sullivan brothers, the U.S. military has revised its policy on allowing siblings to serve under the same command.
A common peace-time practice in the @USNavy, which was never specifically forbidden during #WorldWarII, was for brothers to serve together on the same ship.
The five Sullivan brothers who died were @USNavy Seaman 2nd Class Albert Leo Sullivan, Seaman 2nd Class Madison Abel Sullivan, Seaman 2nd Class Joseph Eugene Sullivan, Coxswain Francis Henry Sullivan, and Gunner's Mate 2nd Class George Thomas Sullivan.
All five Sullivan brothers were assigned to the #USSJuneau, which sunk after being hit by a torpedo.		Of the 700 crew members aboard the USS Juneau, approximately 100 survived the initial torpedo attack and only 10 were rescued from the water eight days after the sinking.

R. Reid Badger noted in his book "A Life in Ragtime" that 1st Lt. James Reese Europe received the first public funeral for a black man in New York City May 13, 1919. Thousands of fans, black and white, turned out to pay their respect.
A deranged drummer named Herbert Wright cut Europe's jugular vein with a penknife while the bandleader was preparing for a show at Mechanics Hall in Boston. Wright had been angry because he thought Europe favored his twin brother over him.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe ironically survived being shot at and gassed in the trenches of France only to die on May 9, 1919, at the hands of one of his own men.
Back in America, 1st Lt. James Reese Europe found himself even more popular than before he went to war. He recorded "One Patrol in No Man's Land"; it became a nationwide hit.
When the regiment returned home in the spring of 1919, it paraded up New York's 5th Avenue to Harlem led by the band, playing its raggedy tunes to the delight of more than a million spectators. 	   	(Photo courtesy of the @USNatArchives) https://t.co/udeovZ7xT4
The band also performed for high-ranking military and civilian officials and for French citizens in cities across France. After Germany surrendered, the #HarlemHellfighters Band became popular performing throughout Europe.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe and his musicians were ordered in August 1918 to entertain thousands of Soldiers in camps and hospitals. Here they are pictured performing for wounded U.S. service members in Paris hospital courtyard.	   	(Photo courtesy of the @LibraryCongress) https://t.co/URl3pt2fCM
Trained to command a machine gun company, 1st Lt. James Reese Europe  learned to fire French machine guns and became the first American  officer and first African-American to lead troops in battle during the  war.
When the 369th and its band arrived in France, they were assigned to the 16th "Le Gallais" Division of the @armee2terre, or French Army's Fourth Army because white U.S. Army units refused to fight alongside them.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe also recruited singers, comedians, dancers and others who could entertain troops. 	   	He recruited the best drum major he could find -- Harlem dancer Bill "Bojangles" Robinson (pictured).	   	(Photo courtesy of the @LibraryCongress) https://t.co/JHImoDX0rS
1st Lt. James Reese Europe even recruited woodwind players from Puerto Rico because there weren't enough in Harlem.
With the promise of extra money to attract first-class musicians, 1st Lt. James Reese Europe recruited musicians from Harlem and reportedly put together one of the finest military bands that ever existed.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe's regimental commander, Col. William Hayward, asked the new lieutenant to organize "the best damn brass band in the United States Army."
1st Lt. James Reese Europe enlisted as a private in @USArmy Sept. 18, 1916. 		Europe accomplished something only a few African-Americans did in those days: He attended officers training and was commissioned a lieutenant.
On May 2, 1912, 1st Lt. James Reese Europe's Clef Club Orchestra became the first African-American band and the first jazz band to play in New York City's famous @CarnegieHall.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe's popularity soared as a bandleader and arranger for the internationally acclaimed dance duo Irene and Vernon Castle. The Castles and Europe helped pioneer modern dance by popularizing the foxtrot and other dances.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe helped found an African-American fraternity known as "the Frogs," and, in 1910, established the Clef Club, the first African-American music union and booking agency.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe moved to New York City in 1903 to pursue a musical career. Work as a violinist was scarce, so he turned to the piano and found work in several cabarets.
According to books about ragtime and early jazz, 1st Lt. James Reese Europe was the most respected black bandleader of the "teens" when the United States entered #WorldWarI.
The French government called 1st Lt. James Reese Europe a battlefield hero. Before the war, however, he was a household name in New York's music world and on the dance scene nationwide.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe was an unrelenting fighter for the dignity of African-American musicians and for them to be paid on the same scale as their white peers.
1st Lt. James Reese Europe is credited with bringing ragtime out of the bordellos and juke joints into mainstream society and elevating African-American music into an accepted art form.
In honor of #JazzAppreciationMonth, today we are highlighting @USArmy 1st Lt. James Reese Europe, bandmaster of the @NationalGuardNY's 369th Infantry Regiment, also known as the #HarlemHellfighers. 	   	(Photo courtesy of the @LibraryCongress) https://t.co/JIzYmQmgJx

Gen. Omar Bradley is laid to rest in Section 30, Grave 428-1-2.	   	#HonorThem

After Gen. Omar Bradley left active duty, both political and military leaders continued to seek Bradley's advice. Perhaps more importantly, he remained in close touch with the Army and served its succeeding generations as the ideal model of a professional Soldier.
That same concern made Gen. Omar Bradley the ideal choice in 1945 to reinvigorate the  Veterans Administration and prepare it to meet the needs of millions of demobilized servicemen.
Self-effacing and quiet, Gen. Omar Bradley showed a concern for the men he led that gave him the reputation as the "Soldier's general."
Gen. Omar Bradley had also more than made up for his lack of combat duty, for during #WorldWarII he successively commanded a division, a corps, an army, and finally a group of armies.
Thirty-five years later Gen. Omar Bradley held the highest rank in the @USArmy, had been its Chief of Staff, and had served two terms as the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
At the end of #WorldWarI, Gen. Omar Bradley considered himself a professional failure because he had spent the war in the United States while his contemporaries had distinguished themselves on the battlefields of France. His gloomy self-assessment was premature.
#TodayIRemember @USArmy Gen. Omar Bradley, who died #OnThisDay in 1981. Bradley served as the General of the Army and first Chairman of @TheJointStaff.		Who are you remembering today?		#HonorThem		(Headstone photo by Rachel Larue; portraits courtesy of @USArmyCMH). https://t.co/lMcppAgwi8

In 1931, Congress awarded the yellow fever volunteers and doctors the “Conquest of Yellow Fever” medal, as well as pension of $125 a month. Several of the awards, including Maj. Walter Reed’s, were awarded posthumously.
During his hospital stay, Pvt. Charles Gustave Sonntag lost 50 pounds and felt the effects of the disease for the rest of his life. Sonntag eventually returned to South Carolina and settled in Gaston, where he married and become a farmer.
After being exposed and bitten by an infected mosquito, Pvt. Charles Gustave Sonntag became ill with yellow fever and was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 10, 1901, and was discharged on March 12, 1901.
Maj. Walter Reed's work, based upon the theories of Cuban doctor Carlos Finlay, eventually proved the hypothesis that mosquitoes transmitted the devastating disease.
Throughout the late nineteenth century, #YellowFever epidemics routinely swept through the southern United States and during the #SpanishAmericanWar, losses from yellow fever were thirteen times higher than deaths from military operations.
Pvt. Charles Gustave Sonntag was a member of the South Carolina Infantry Regiment and served during the #SpanishAmericanWar. He along with the other volunteers knew exposure to yellow fever could result in death, but their sacrifice was made “for the sake of humanity.”
In honor of #WorldHealthDay, today we are highlighting @USArmy Pvt. Charles Gustave Sonntag volunteered in Maj. Walter Reed's experimental #YellowFever group at the Columbia Barracks near Havana, Cuba.		(U.S. Army photo courtesy of Arlington National Cemetery) https://t.co/TPZ1feTwgd

According to the @MortonArboretum, yellowwood trees tend to be a medium- to large-sized tree, 30-50 feet high, with smooth bark, large hanging clusters of fragrant white flowers, and clear yellow fall color. They are native to North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee.
Our yellowwood, or Cladrastis kentukea, is a champion tree and grows in Section 23, near the Memorial Amphitheater.
The Virginia Big Tree Program is managed by @Virginia_Tech.
If two trees score within five points of each other, they are designated co-champions.
In order to be considered a champion, co-champion, or to make the #Top5 list for a tree species, the tree needs to rank highest with regards to tree height, crown spread, and trunk circumference.
In honor of #ArborDay coming up (observed nationally the last Friday in April), today we're highlighting one of the cemetery's five Virginia state champion and co-champion trees: the yellowwood.		(@USArmy photo by Rachel Larue) https://t.co/tgmoanUBWg

Sentinels wear the @USArmy dress blue uniform, reminiscent of the color and style worn by Soldiers of the late 1800s.
Why 21? 		The 21 is symbolic of the highest salute accorded to dignitaries in military and state ceremonies. As a gesture against intrusion, the sentinel always bears his weapon away from the Tomb.
While on duty, the sentinel crosses a 63-foot rubber surfaced walkway in 21 steps. He faces the Tomb for 21 seconds, turns again and pauses an additional 21 seconds before retracing his steps.

The surviving Family members wear either a Gold Star Lapel Button or the Lapel Button for Next of Kin of Deceased Personnel in honor of their fallen Soldier. Family members typically receive these pins from the Army before or after their Soldier's funeral service.
In 1973, the Lapel Button for Next of Kin of Deceased Personnel was  introduced to symbolize active duty Soldiers who lost their lives in non-combat operations.
In 1947, #Congress approved the design, manufacture and distribution of the official Gold Star Lapel Button, a symbol worn by next of kin of service members of the armed forces who lost their lives in war and armed hostilities of the United States.
Per guidance by the @USArmy, the day is now observed as #GoldStarSpousesDay.		#DidYouKnow the Gold Star is a symbol of loss dating back to #WorldWarI?

#DidYouKnow pin oak acorns are eaten by many songbirds, wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, squirrels and smaller rodents, but are a particularly important food for many ducks?
Because of its tolerance for wet conditions, the tree is also known regionally as swamp oak, water oak and swamp Spanish oak.
Our pin oak, or Quercus palustris, is a co-champion tree and is located in Section 35, near Grave 1339. According to the @ArborDay Foundation, the name pin oak comes from its short, tough branchlets located along the branches and limbs.

Our apologies -- the #VietnamVeterans #MemorialTree is in Section 28, not 33.
The Kennedy grave site is now paved with irregular stones of #CapeCod granite with sedum planted in between, to resemble stone lying naturally in a Massachusetts field.
During the first three years after President John F. Kennedy’s death, more than 16 million people visited his gravesite. Because of the large crowds, Kennedy’s family and cemetery officials decided a more suitable site should be constructed, which is what is seen today.
The initial plot was 20 x 30 feet and surrounded by a white picket fence. First Lady Jacqueline B. Kennedy lit the eternal flame during the funeral. The flame burns from the center of a 5-foot circular flat-granite stone at the head of the grave, seen in the black &amp; white image.
The location was selected partly based on President John F. Kennedy’s previous visit to the cemetery March 3, 1963. After touring the @ArlingtonNPS the president remarked that the view of @WashingtonDC was so magnificent that he could stay forever.
President John F. Kennedy was laid to rest with a state funeral and full military honors at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery on Nov. 25, 1963, on the slope below #ArlingtonHouse.
On Nov. 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as his motorcade wound through Dallas.

Six other African-American service members were recognized with the award that year but four had died in action and the other two had died in the decades after the war.
On Jan. 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton presented 1st Lt. Vernon Baker with the #MedalOfHonor, he was the only living African-American #WorldWarII veteran to earn it.
In 1996, more than 50 years after his actions in Italy, 1st Lt. Vernon Baker received a telephone call explaining that the military was seeking to re-evaluate the heroism of African-Americans in #WorldWarII and he was to receive the #MedalOfHonor.
1st Lt. Vernon Baker remained in the @USArmy until 1968 and became one of the first African-American officers to command an all-white company.
Following the battle, 1st Lt. Vernon Baker was nominated for the nation’s second-highest honor for battlefield valor, the #DistinguishedServiceCross. At the time, the #MedalOfHonor was reserved for white troops.
1st Lt. Vernon Baker led two attacks against the stronghold, taking out many of the enemy positions in the mountainous terrain. This action secured the position for Baker’s team and helped to drive enemy forces out of northern Italy.
1st Lt. Vernon Baker and his troops were ordered to launch an early morning assault against a mountain stronghold occupied by the Germans.
In the spring of 1945, 1st Lt. Vernon Baker — the only black officer in his company — was in command of a weapons unit near Viareggio, Italy. It was just a few months before #WorldWarII would end, but on April 5, the battles were still raging.
1st Lt. Vernon Baker joined the segregated 270th Regiment of the 92nd Infantry Division. He and his fellow soldiers were members of the first African-American unit to go into combat in #WorldWarII.

Maj. Jonathan Letterman is laid to rest in Section 3, Grave 1869.		#HonorThem
Information for this thread from https://t.co/mGnZ1TSpTK.
In recognition of the importance of casualty triage, Maj. Jonathan Letterman established three echelons of treatment facilities that we still use today.
Ira Rutkow, a medial historian said Maj. Jonathan Letterman's surgical credentialing on the basis of expertise was ‘‘one of the most momentous medical reforms to come out of the Civil War.’’
Maj. Jonathan Letterman implemented a policy of professional privileging based on specialized skills and documented experience; each division's three physicians with the most extensive surgical experience were permitted to perform surgical operations, which was unprecedented.
Maj. Jonathan Letterman made the medical logistics system more efficient by reducing the number of medicines and materials to be carried, thereby decreasing the number of wagons used to transport them by half.
Drivers of the ambulances were required to complete training designed by Maj. Jonathan Letterman to increase their level of commitment + effectiveness; the ambulance system met a previously unfilled need but was of limited capacity + often challenged by the number of casualties.
Maj. Jonathan Letterman developed a system to transport the injured (ultimately used by all Union Armies) in which each regiment was supported by three ambulances, each with two privates and a driver, and one transport cart with a driver.
Maj. Jonathan Letterman immediately placed emphasis on efficient medical supply logistics, the enforcement of sanitary measures, and the prompt removal of the sick and wounded from the battlefield.
Maj. Jonathan Letterman was promoted to full surgeon and given the rank of major in June 1862 before being designated medical director of the Army of the Potomac by Surgeon General William A. Hammond.
In November 1861, Maj. Jonathan Letterman was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and then in May 1862, was designated medical director of the Department of West Virginia.
Before the #CivilWar, Maj. Jonathan Letterman provided surgical care for casualties in a number of military campaigns against Indian tribes in Florida, New Mexico, and California.
Maj. Jonathan Letterman's efforts to rationalize and organize combat casualty care during the #CivilWar earned him the title of ‘‘Father of Battlefield Medicine."

In the first 22 minutes of the assault, the @MEarng had seized the village of Torcy to their front. It was during this assault that Pfc. George Dilboy heroically destroyed a German machine gun position.

Information for this thread courtesy of the @JFKLibrary at https://t.co/f6g8BtmKn8.
With a deep sense of devotion to her family and country, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis dedicated herself to raising her children and to making the world a better place through art, literature, and a respect for history and public service.
While she was first lady, she helped to stop the destruction of historic buildings along the square, including the Renwick Building, now part of the @Smithsonian Institution. In New York City, she led a campaign to save and renovate #GrandCentralStation.
Throughout her life, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis sought to preserve and protect America’s cultural heritage. The results of her work are still visible in Lafayette Square, across from the @WhiteHouse in Washington, DC.
In 1968, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. When Mr. Onassis died in 1975, she became a widow a second time. She enjoyed a successful career in publishing at @VikingBooks and @DoubledayBooks until she passed away, May 19, 1994.
Soon after President John F. Kennedy’s death, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis began the work of creating the @JFKLibrary and Museum as a memorial to her husband. She chose the architect I.M. Pei to design the building, which now stands as a landmark overlooking #BostonHarbor.
Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis established a @WhiteHouse Fine Arts Committee, and created the post of White House curator. Gathering outstanding examples of American art and furniture from around the U.S., she restored all the public rooms in the White House.
While serving as first lady, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis wanted people to have a greater appreciation of the history of America's most famous residence and its past inhabitants. Her first major project was to restore and preserve the @WhiteHouse.

Information for this thread taken from the Herbert Hoover Library and Museum Blog. Read full entry and learn more about Mary Roberts Rinehart at https://t.co/LkKNXKc1B7.
When war broke out in Europe in August 1914, Mary Roberts Rinehart served as a war correspondent, covering the conflict. This war correspondent work first introduced her to President Herbert Hoover, and his wife Lou, forming a life-long friendship.
Mary Roberts Rinehart, a nurse by profession, took up writing to supplement her family’s income. The mystery novels were the most lucrative source of her writing endeavors but she also served as a regular contributor to popular magazines such as the @SatEvePost and @LHJmagazine.
In Mary Roberts Rinehart's 1930 mystery novel, The Door, the butler is the killer, establishing the genre cliche, “the butler did it.”
#DidYouKnow Mary Roberts Rinehart's 1920 play The Bat inspired the 1930 movie,The Bat Whispers, which became a source of inspiration for comic book artist Bob Kane in the creation of #Batman?
Long before Agatha Christie, P.D. James, and Patricia Cornwell, Mary Roberts Rinehart was America’s premier female writer of the “who done it.” She rose to national fame in 1907 with her novel The Circular Staircase.
In honor of #WomensHistoryMonth, today we are highlighting Mary Roberts Rinehart, who was referred to as "America's Mistress of Mystery.” 		@LibraryCongress photo shows Rinehart out for a stroll with her favorite pet.		#HonorThem https://t.co/oea9a4ufcc

Want to learn more about Matthew Henson? Check out https://t.co/T9Ks1WwOVr or https://t.co/tVbb7gUCLH.
Members of Matthew Henson’s family attended the ceremony along with many of the explorer's admirers from around the world. The re-interment represented the ultimate national recognition that Henson had so long deserved.
On April 6, 1988, the remains of Matthew Henson and his wife, Lucy Ross Henson, were transported to Washington, D.C., where they were re-interred among other American heroes, and near the grave site of Robert Peary and his wife Josephine Deibitsch Peary.
In 1987, at the request of Dr. S. Allen Counter of @Harvard University, President Ronald Reagan granted permission for Matthew Henson and his wife to be re-interred at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery.
After his death in 1955, Matthew Henson was buried in New York City's Woodlawn Cemetery. In 1968, the body of his wife Lucy Ross Henson was buried nearby.
Matthew Henson was three times refused a pension by Congress, was excluded from the Explorer's Club in which Robert Peary was president, and lastly was not considered for burial at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery at the time of his death.
During his lifetime, Robert Peary received many honors for his achievement. Matthew Henson, however, received comparatively little recognition for his part in the discovery, even though Peary repeatedly acknowledged Henson's indispensability to the expedition's success.
On that historic day, it was Matthew Henson, an African-American, who first reached the Pole and planted the American flag.
On April 6, 1909, two Americans and four Eskimos became the first human beings to set foot on the #NorthPole. The achievement crowned numerous attempts to reach the Pole, over a period of 18 years, by Robert Edwin Peary and Matthew Henson.

The need for the women’s reserve was substantial. SPARS took many Coast Guard jobs such as telephone and radio operators so that they ‘could release a man to sea.’
While #WorldWarII was being fought by men overseas, much of their successes can be traced back to the women working in their absence on the home front. Every military branch would utilize women in various jobs throughout the war.

Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1986, which is highest award that an American civilian can receive.
Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin received the National Medal of Science in 1970 for his work up to and including the development of the oral polio vaccine.
Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin began testing a new polio vaccine on humans, starting with his own family.
During the same time period, Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin discovered that the polio virus attacked and multiplied in the intestines, as opposed to the respiratory tract as was previously believed.
The first inactive polio vaccine, which required an injection administered by a doctor, was created in 1954 by Dr. Jonas Salk.
In the 1930s, the outbreak of polio, which led to paralysis or death, had reached epidemic proportions both in the United States and around the globe.

#ArlingtonNationalCemetery is home to an extremely diverse and significant collection of trees and landscapes. The more than 8,600 trees are comprised of 300 varieties and species. Learn more about them at https://t.co/mgZybtKJWy.
.@virginia_tech manages the Virginia Big Tree Program and @ArlingtonVA manages a more local Arlington County Champion Tree Program.
If two trees score within five points of each other, they are designated co-champions.
In order to be considered a champion, co-champion, or to make the top five list for a tree species, the tree needs to rank highest with regards to tree height, crown spread, and trunk circumference.
The other champion trees at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery are the State Champion #RoyalPaulownia, State Champion #Yellowwood, State Co-Champion #SawtoothOak, and State Co-Champion #PinOak.
The #DwarfHackberry is in Section 8 and is estimated to be between 130-150 years old.
A #DwarfHackberry is multi-branched, with stiff twigs and smooth grey bark that becomes ridged and knotted as the plant ages. The Dwarf Hackberry fruit is orange-brown and globular with a sweet outer layer and contains a single seed.
A #DwarfHackberry, or Celtis tenuifolia, is a small tree or shrub in the elm family that typically grows three to 12 feet in height, but can reach up to 30 or more feet.
#ICYMI: The latest issue of @wdcgardener magazine featured our #DwarfHackberry being recently named a Virginia State Co-Champion tree! It joins four other champion and co-champion trees. Article available at https://t.co/ttTVwtZUXD. #HonorRememberExplore https://t.co/ttyFcGQI7b

The #TripleNickels soon also became known as #SmokeJumpers, for parachuting into West Coast forests + putting out fires set by Japanese incendiary balloons. (Pictured are 555th Airborne Soldiers waiting for an equipment check courtesy of @USNatArchives) https://t.co/BGL5SvZn3H
The unit, activated in December 1942 and constituted #OnThisDay in 1943, did not see combat during #WorldWarII.
In Section 23, on Farragut Drive, there is an Eastern Hemlock tree dedicated to the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion. (@USArmy photos by Elizabeth Fraser) #BlackHistoryMonth #HonorRememberExplore https://t.co/eoGXiEzP8i
Lt. Col. Juanita Redmond Hipps is laid to rest in Section 21, Grave 769-1. #HonorThem
Lt. Col. Juanita Redmond Hipps was one of the few nurses to escape and wrote "I Served on Bataan," a best seller in 1943, which later became the basis for the movie "So Proudly We Hail," a story about military nurses sent to the Philippines during WWII.
One of the Angels of Bataan, then Lt. Juanita Redmond served as a @USArmy nurse during #WorldWarII who served in Bataan and Corregidor. When Bataan and Corregidor fell, almost 80 nurses were captured and imprisoned.

Two years after the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed an order to desegregate the U.S. Armed Forces, closing the book on the #BuffaloSoldiers.
As featured in the novel and film Miracle at St. Anna, the 92nd distinguished themselves on the battlefield, disproving skeptics and earning an honored chapter in the history of World War II.
The unit's distinctive insignia was a buffalo patch. The term "buffalo soldiers" dates to post-Civil War conflicts with Indians who granted the honorific to an all-black cavalry outfit. #BuffaloSoldiers served in the #SpanishAmericanWar, #WorldWarI, and #WorldWarII. https://t.co/d08jc9jKde
In Section 23 there is a Red Maple tree dedicated to the 92nd Infantry Division. Of the 3 African-American divisions activated during #WorldWarII, only the 92nd would serve as a full division in combat.

The photo, which inspired the architecture of the @MarineMuseum and the @USMC War Memorial, immortalized the moment forever. It has become the one of the most iconic images of America's resilience.
Ironically, the flag had been salvaged from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941.
That afternoon @AP photographer Joe Rosenthal captured Sgt. Michael Strank, Cpl. Harlon H. Block, Pfc. Franklin R. Sousley, then Pfc. Rene A. Gagnon, then Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Petty Officer 2nd Class John H. Bradley, raising a second larger flag.
"We all cheered. The ships at sea blew their horns and whistles. It was a very emotional [moment]," said James Wheeler, who was a forward observer on top of Suribachi for the first 10 days of the invasion.
The morning of Feb. 23, 1945, men engaged in fierce battle on the island of #IwoJima, Japan, were overwhelmed by the sight of a small American flag flying from the top of Mount Suribachi.

Pictured Sept. 12, 1955, are Pfc. John D Gira (left) and Sgt. Walter Strohmeier (center left). Pictured Nov. 23, 2015 are Spc. Isaac Redmond (center right) and Spc. Preston Millison.
Twenty-one is symbolic of the highest salute given to dignitaries in military and state ceremonies.
While on duty the sentinel crosses a 63-foot rubber surfaced walkway in exactly 21 steps. He then faces the Tomb for 21 seconds, turns again, and pauses an additional 21 seconds before retracing his steps.
Originally, a civilian watchman guarded the tomb and, then in 1926, a military guard from the Washington Provisional Brigade, guarded the tomb during daylight hours. In 1948, when the #OldGuard was reactivated, they assumed the responsibility of guarding the tomb.
Sentinels, all volunteers, are considered to be the best of the elite @USArmyOldGuard, the oldest active-duty infantry unit in the @USArmy serving our nation since 1784.

Stabilized the mast where rivets broke due to internal rusting of the steel.
Restored ship’s rigging to its 1915 configuration.
Conserved the remains of the ship’s bronze bell and reinstalled on the bronze door.
Installed handcrafted copper gutters to prevent water from entering the walls of the monument.
Removed deteriorating concrete and waterproofing layers from the dome, repaired cracks and added concrete layers.
Removed the granite dome’s root pavers, and cleaned and reset them with anchor supports.
Repaired and stabilized steel areas on the crow’s nest and mast, which were corroded.
Removed 100 years of lead paint from the mast and repainted with a high-performance coating specially mixed to match the original color.

The @NatlParkService was an essential partner, providing extensive research, fact-gathering and historical documentation.
Dedicated in 1915, the mast of the USS Maine has seen its share of problems over the years including a pool of water that routinely covered the memorial’s floor, corrosion that deformed the battleship’s mast and deteriorated rigging cables.
Located in Section 24 of #ArlingtonNationalCemetery, the mast of the #USSMaine is a towering memorial to the many lives lost over 100 years ago.
Arlington National Cemetery and the @NavalDistrictWash are co-hosting a wreath-laying ceremony today to rededicate the #USSMaine Memorial after a decade-long restoration project to bring the memorial back to its original state. (@USArmy photo by Elizabeth Fraser) https://t.co/MR6quoJRZu

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Louis Comfort Tiffany’s studio also designed mausoleums, tombs, headstones and other mortuary monuments.
According to @TiffanyAndCo, Louis Comfort Tiffany was a world leader of the Art Nouveau movement. He is revered for his fanciful jewelry as well as his stained glass lamps and windows that brighten museums, banks, hospitals, hotel lobbies and more.
According to the @MorseMuseum, although his father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, had founded the most prestigious silver and jewelry company in America, @TiffanyAndCo, Louis Comfort Tiffany chose another professional direction.

For more information on the destruction of the #USSMaine, visit @USNHistory's website at https://t.co/uQScFahiYJ.
The raising of the Maine took nearly two years, and from the wreck, 66 bodies were recovered. After refloating what remained of the Maine, the ship was towed out to sea and scuttled with full honors in water 600 fathoms deep March 16, 1912.
The Secretary of War also authorized and directed to remove the mast of the ship and place it upon a proper foundation in the cemetery.
All who perished in the disaster were buried in a cemetery in Havana. Congress approved a bill instructing that their remains be disinterred and transferred from Havana to #ArlingtonNationalCemetery March 30, 1898.
Nearly 3/4 of the ship's crew died as a result of the explosion. While the cause of the tragedy is still unsettled, American popular opinion blamed Spain, and war followed within a few months. #RememberTheMaine became the rallying cry. (Image courtesy of @NatlParkService) https://t.co/qhJq6JAhRO

American authorities believed that the presence of an American warship would be a stabilizing influence on the Spanish control of the colony and would assist in curtailing guerrilla activities.

The inscription at that time simply read "Army and Navy Nurses." Authorization was granted in 1970, and then in 1971, the monument was rededicated to the service of @USAirForce, @USArmy and @USNavy nurses.
On July 13, 1970, @USNavy Capt. Delores Cornelius, deputy director of the #NavyNurseCorps, requested authority to install a bronze plaque over the existing inscription on the Nurses Memorial.
The granite statue of a nurse in uniform, sculptured by Frances Rich, honors the nurses who served in the U.S. armed forces in #WorldWarI, many of whom rest among the  hundreds of nurses buried in Section 21, commonly known as the "Nurses Section."

When Parks died on Aug. 21, 1929, he was granted special permission to be buried at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery. He is buried in Section 15, Grave 2.
Parks served in the @USArmy from 1861 to 1929 by working as a grave digger and maintenance man for the cemetery.
Parks was freed in 1862 under the terms of the will of his former owner, George Washington Parke Custis. He still lived on Arlington Estate when Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton signed the orders designating Arlington as a military burial ground.
The first graves in Arlington National Cemetery were dug by James Parks and without him, the story of Arlington would be incomplete.

@jay_lass The cemetery representative working with your family will be your point of contact throughout the entire process and can let you know exactly what to expect depending on your family's individual circumstances. Do let us know if we can assist with anything else.
@jay_lass Special requests include requests for full military honors (which can take longer to schedule than standard military honors because of additional military resources such as escorts and the caisson) or a request for one of the chapels located on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.
@jay_lass We're so sorry for your loss. The length of time it takes for scheduling is typically several weeks to several months and depends on many factors, including the family's ability to provide all documents to verify eligibility, and any special requests.

The @ArlingtonNPS, or the Robert E. Lee Memorial, was built by George Washington Parke Custis in 1802-1818, and was the home of Robert E. Lee from 1831-1861.
It is named for Gen. George Brinton McClellan, first commander of the Army of the Potomac during the American #CivilWar. While the Army of the Potomac was being organized, its headquarters was located in the #ArlingtonHouse.
Construction on the gate, made from Red Seneca Sandstone, was completed in 1879.

One of the inscriptions on the memorial reads, “To World War II American  Soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Bulge- The greatest Land  Battle in the history of the United States Army.”
On May 8, 2006, a #BattleOfTheBulge Memorial was unveiled and officially dedicated in Section 21 of #ArlingtonNationalCemetery. (@USArmy file photo by Stephen Smith) https://t.co/8YpfenpV07
The battle that ensued is known historically as the #BattleOfTheBulge. The courage and fortitude of the American Soldier was tested against great adversity. Nevertheless, the quality of his response ultimately meant the victory of freedom over tyranny.
On Dec. 16, 1944, with the onset of winter, the German army launched a counteroffensive that was intended to cut through the Allied forces in a manner that would turn the tide of the war in Hitler's favor.
In late 1944, during the wake of the Allied forces' successful D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, it seemed as if the #WorldWarII was all but over.

Medgar Evers is buried in Section 36, Grave 1431. 		#HonorThem https://t.co/0K0Yq8fSlU
Information for this thread courtesy of Minot Air Force Base - see the original at https://t.co/rZuK0zNi76.
In 1970, Medgar Evers College (@NewsAtMedgar) was created in Brooklyn, New York, as part of the City University of New York, or @CUNY.
Mickey Levine, former chairman of the American Veterans Committee said at the services, "no soldier in this field has fought more courageously, more heroically than Medgar Evers."
Evers was buried on June 19, 1963, in #ArlingtonNationalCemetery and received full military honors in front of a crowd of more than 2,000 people.
On June 12, 1963, Evers shot outside of his home after returning from an integration meeting.
In December 1954, Evers became the @NAACP's first field officer in Mississippi.
When his application was rejected on grounds of race, Evers became the focus of an @NAACP campaign to desegregate the school, a case aided by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Brown v. Board of Education 347 US 483 that segregation was unconstitutional.
Evers applied to the then-segregated @olemisslaw in February 1954.
Evers married classmate Myrlie Beasley Dec. 24, 1951, and completed work on his degree the following year.
Despite his resentment over such treatment, Evers enrolled at @AlcornStateU, majoring in business administration.
Despite fighting for his country as part of the Battle of Normandy, Evers soon found that his skin color gave him no freedom when he and five friends were forced away at gunpoint from voting in a local election.
A native of Decatur, Mississippi, Evers attended school there until being inducted into the @USArmy in 1943.
While he is sometimes overshadowed by other prominent civil rights leaders, his legacy and achievements continue to this day.
Medgar Evers was a #WorldWarII veteran, a student athlete, a distinguished Mississippi businessman and a pioneer of the civil rights movement.
#DidYouKnow some states across the country celebrate #CivilRightsDay each year on the third Monday in January to honor civil rights activists? 		Today, we are honoring Medgar Evers. https://t.co/ajTmluqoLu
#FLYOVER: There is a flyover scheduled tomorrow, Jan. 16, around 8:45 a.m., in support of a funeral at #ArlingtonNationalCemetery.

If you're looking for ways for you and your family to participate in the this national day of service, visit https://t.co/O54CY99E4h.
The #MLKDay of Service is the only federal holiday observed as a national day of service:  a "day on, not a day off."
In 1994, #Congress designated the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday as a national day of service and charged the Corporation for National and Community Service with leading the effort.
#MLKDay is observed on the third Monday of January each year.
In 1983, Congress passed legislation that established a federal holiday to commemorate the birthday of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  He was assassinated in 1968. #MLK50Forward https://t.co/d8GDAH89oH
