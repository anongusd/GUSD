@VZWSupport Please do
@VZWSupport Apple music is not a perk worthy of verizon large bill or access to vz network so you know I was with you guys early 2000's till 2006 and you guys were spendy thats part of the reason i left to T-Mobile. I know you didn't ask but T-Mobile marketing and leases are much better
@VZWSupport I even up my plan because I thought verizon was slowing me which wasn't the case. When left that area my phone came back alive. Thats part of the reason I might be time 2 change companies seeing my options T-Mobile or Sprint maybe AT&amp;T you all are just to expensive no perks
@VZWSupport I sepent 5 hours maybe more and 2 weeks with out service I was told that I had found verizon deadzone so you know I was with T-Mobile for a decade 10yrs I got my sister and her husband to come to T-Mobile they were also on the trip there phones worked 🤦🤦🤦😂😂😂
@VZWSupport I thought it was my 📱but thats not it now to be fair I rarely used my data I had home wifi. I also thought i was out of data and be slowed but that not it
@VZWSupport between Seattle and Tacoma so if you look up the state park and look up the coverage area it says it has coverage but it really doesn't
@VZWSupport Calls and texts don't work data is none existent. I went camping inside the city at Dash Point State Park in Washington state that signal was very bad data did not work my calls didn't come through voicemails didn't download text messages didn't go through
@InternetYodha @_Shourie What really I'm going to keep that in mind

@knightnblu @AlejadroPascual @ItsJJD As projected in the FY 2019 budget, Trump plans to add $8.282 trillion, a 41- percent increase from the $20.245 trillion debt at the end of Obama's last budget for FY 17. He will add almost as much in four years as Obama did in eight. 🤓🤓🤓🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑

@knightnblu @AlejadroPascual @ItsJJD Pres Bush also responded to the 2001 recession by passing the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. He approved a $700 billion bailout package for banks to combat the 2008 global financial crisis.
@knightnblu @AlejadroPascual @ItsJJD Bush launched the War on Terror in response to the 9/11 attacks. The War on Terror included two wars. The War in Afghanistan cost $1 trillion and the Iraq War cost $807.5 billion. They increased military spending to record levels of $600 billion to $800 billion a year.
@knightnblu @AlejadroPascual @ItsJJD President Bush added $5.849 trillion, the second-greatest dollar amount. It was the 4th largest percentage increase. Bush increased the debt by 101 percent from where it started at $5.8 trillion on September 30, 01. That's the end of FY 2001, which was Pres.Clinton's last budget.
@knightnblu @AlejadroPascual @ItsJJD President Reagan increased the debt by 186 percent. Reaganomics added $1.86 trillion. Reagan's brand of supply-side economics didn't grow the economy enough to offset the lost revenue from its tax cuts. That was partly because Reagan increased the defense budget by 35%

@VerumEstLiberta @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP @dcexaminer On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5 percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027. Its a tax increase #GOPTaxScam

But the individual tax cuts would expire after 2025 #GOPTaxScamBill #GreedOverPeople =Gop https://t.co/pYjKb7ma9K
But the individual tax cuts would expire after 2025, a step that Republicans took to comply with budget rules that allow them to pass the tax overhaul using a simple majority, and without Democratic votes #TaxScamBill #GOPTaxScamBill #GreedOverPeople = GOP
Under the bill approved by the House, the corporate tax rate would be cut to 21 percent, from the current 35 percent, a move that Republicans are betting will increase economic growth. Individuals would also see tax cuts, including a top rate of 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent
