PM also expressed his appreciation for Britain's strong stand against antisemitism. PM congratulated his British counterpart on the trade agreement that was signed on 18 February between Britain &amp; Israel, which is due to strengthen &amp; upgrade trade links between the 2 countries.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by telephone with British Prime Minister Theresa May and thanked her for Britain's decision to define all arms of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, adding that he expects additional countries to follow suit.
I strongly condemn all manifestations of antisemitism, and I call upon all leaders of enlightened countries to join in the systematic and continuous denunciation of antisemitism. The first way to fight antisemitism is to denounce and condemn it.
In recent days there has been another shocking antisemitic incident, again in Strasbourg - a monument to a synagogue that was burned by the Nazis was vandalized.
This is an important decision because Hezbollah is a terrorist organization in its own right, and it is also the main terrorist arm of Iran. 	I call on other countries, first of all in Europe but also around the world, to join this important move by Britain.
Last week, another very important thing occurred diplomatically &amp; concerning security - Britain's decision to outlaw Hezbollah and to define all of Hezbollah’s parts as a terrorist organization.
We agreed to establish a joint team to advance this goal, together with other elements. I invited President Putin to be the guest of honor at the dedication of the memorial to those who fell in the siege of Leningrad and he accepted my invitation.
We agreed on the continuation of the security coordination mechanism between the Russian military &amp; the IDF, &amp; on a common goal – the withdrawal of foreign forces that arrived in Syria after the outbreak of the civil war.
I made it unequivocally clear that Israel will not allow the military entrenchment of Iran in Syria, and I also made it unequivocally clear that we would continue to take military action against it.
PM Netanyahu: Last week I met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. As I promised, the focus of our discussions was the Iranian issue.

The new form of antisemitism is anti-Zionism, and we ask not only all our friends, but all decent countries everywhere to include antisemitism, the definition of antisemitism, anti-Zionism as well. And so I’ve just made that request from you as well. https://t.co/IUG3Qbq1d7
The main attack against the Jewish people today is the attacks against the Jewish state and the attempt to delegitimize the very right of the Jewish people for a state of their own. This is called anti-Zionism.
At the time of the Holocaust, we were absolutely defenseless, unable to protect ourselves, and obviously we have now an advanced, powerful country that builds our future, but also defends our security.

Third, Nasrallah is in distress due to our determination.	 	Against Hezbollah stands the lethal striking force of the IDF. Believe me; Nasrallah has good reasons not to want to feel the might of our arm.
Second, Nasrallah is in a predicament due to financial distress. The policy that we pushed of reimposing sanctions on Iran, which was clearly and sharply adopted by President Trump, is striking hard at the sources of financing for Iran and its proxies, especially Hezbollah.
PM Netanyahu: "Nasrallah and his people put great effort into the surprise weapon of invasive tunnels, including their excavation, in contrast to what he said, in recent years and months. Within six weeks, we completely denied him this weapon.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "Nasrallah broke his silence yesterday. He is very embarrassed for three reasons: One, because of the great success of our Operation Northern Shield. https://t.co/fV57ymp42x
Anti-semitism from the right is not a new phenomenon there. What is new is the combination of Islamic anti-semitism, andof the extreme left which includes anti-Zionism, such as has recently occurred in UK and Ireland. What a disgrace. We condemn all forms of anti-semitism as such
On Friday, unknown individuals smashed the memorial to the Jews of Thessalonica who perished in the Holocaust. I strongly condemn this and call on the international community to act against revived anti-semitism, especially in Europe.
In contrast to the terrible helplessness of our people then, today we strike at those who seek our lives and hurt all those who try to hurt us. At the same time, we do not forget our dead, our enemies and our rescuers.
During the Holocaust, the Jewish people were completely helpless. Today the state of the Jews is among the strongest and most advanced in the world. First and foremost, we have restored to our people the strength to resist that we lost in exile.
By this unbelievable act of heroism he served as an example to thousands. The story spread among thousands and he served as an example to thousands, and to us. The moving stories of the revival of Moshe, Malka and Motka are the story of our revival. #WeRemember
Moshe survived the death camps and death march. Malka lost her 5 sisters in the crematoria and has a number burned onto her arm. Motka, whose brother fell at Latrun, interrupted an SS officer who whipped his back. The penalty for such offense was immediate death, but he survived

We are thus approaching the completion of the goal we set at the outset of Operation Northern Shield – the eradication of Hezbollah's tunnels weapon.
Overnight, the air force also attacked on the southern front against Hamas targets in Gaza and this morning we announced the exposure of an additional tunnel, a main tunnel, perhaps the most important, that crossed the border into our territory.
Just in the last 36 hours the air force attacked Iranian warehouses with Iranian weapons at the international airport in Damascus. The accumulation of recent attacks proves that we are determined more than ever to take action against Iran in Syria, just as we promised.
We took action against Hamas on the Gaza border, openly and covertly. The IDF has major achievements under your command. We yet have much work to do and we will do it.
We worked with impressive success to block Iran's military entrenchment in Syria. In this framework, the IDF attacked Iranian and Hezbollah targets hundreds of times. 		We worked together against the manufacture of precision weapons in Lebanon.
During this time we worked together against varied threats in order to build up Israel's security.	 	In achieving these goals, the IDF – under your command – worked with exceptional cooperation with all of the security arms – the ISA, Mossad, Israel Police and other bodies.

Rest in peace Misha; you were very dear to me.	I loved you as a son loved his father.
Several weeks ago I visited Misha in his home He was lucid as always, sharp as a razor, marvelous in the splendor and nobility of his soul, an exemplar. There was no greater patriot. Moshe Arens' great contribution to our people and our state will be remembered forever.
In recent years he dedicated himself to endlessly watching over the documentation of the full story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which Betar members had a central role.
I watched Misha do amazing things to build up the standing of the State of Israel time and again – as ambassador in Washington, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and Defense Minister.
Misha, my teacher and mentor, was an outstanding student of Zeev Jabotinsky. In this framework he knew my father, who was present at his wedding to his dear wife Muriel. Since then there has been an abiding bond between our families.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 	"My wife Sara and I weep bitterly over the passing of someone we loved dearly, the late Moshe Arens.
Tomorrow we'll go up to the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is tremendously important for our security.

This has increased exports and the GNP, brings money into state coffers, creates jobs and raises Israeli citizens' wages. This is very important news and a very great change. Israel is becoming a rising global force.
The export of goods to China has risen by 56%. The export of goods and services to Japan has risen by 50%. Exports to India and Latin America have risen by 27%. These are all new markets that we are opening.
Israeli exports broke a record in 2018 and they are expected to reach $110 billion. This is an 8% increase over 2017, an immense increase. This is the result of the strategy that I have discussed many times. It is a strategy of opening new markets – and we have opened them.
We have opened a very large market here and there is much more work that needs to be done. We will discuss joint delegations with them and we will open this huge market to Israeli companies, which will increase our national revenues.
We have a new ally here and whoever needs additional proof of Israel's rising status in the world simply needs to look at what is happening in Brazil. They love us and admire Israel.
His main reform in foreign relations, first of all, has to do with us. Here are things that he just said, after the visit, regarding relations with Israel. He said: 'It is the Government and People of Israel who will decide what is the capital of Israel, period.
Last week I returned from a historic visit to Brazil. We have a new ally and President Bolsonaro, who is now leading a huge country, intends to make it an even stronger power by economic and other reforms.
Our position is clear. We will continue to act against the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria, including at present, and we will act against any element that undermines, or attempts to undermine, the security of Israel.
We will discuss the situation in Syria in continuation of both @POTUS Trump's decision and the conversation I had with President Putin last Friday, and the deepening of intelligence and operational cooperation between Israel and the US, which is becoming closer all the time.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the weekly Cabinet meeting: "This evening I will meet with US National Security Adviser @AmbJohnBolton. I will discuss with him the efforts to block the Iranian aggression in our region		https://t.co/eofoZXg7HF
PM Netanyahu: I insisted on the reimposition of sanctions on Iran and @POTUS Trump indeed made the brave decision to reimpose them. President Trump is acting against Iran in the economic sphere and here in Israel we are acting against Iran in the military sphere."
This is the agreement that 'in exchange' filled the coffers of this regime with vast sums, which it immediately channeled to their regional aggression.
I have been obliged to fight before all the leaders of the world against what I see as an existential danger and to fight it in time. I strongly opposed the nuclear agreement signed with Iran, which paved Iran's way to a nuclear arsenal: not one bomb but hundreds of bombs
PM Netanyahu: The greatest threat from Iran is that of nuclear weapons in the hands of a power which declares that we need to be wiped off the face of the earth. Here as well we are fighting, and on occasion
We are denying Hezbollah the weapon of terrorist tunnels it prepared attack us. It prepared a stratagem, and by a stratagem we shattered its main surprise weapon for use at the start of the war, according to its planning, as we denied Hamas in the Gaza Strip the tunnels weapon.
This is now happening in Syria, against Iran's attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria. It is also happening on the Lebanese border.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, upon leaving on a historic visit to Brazil:	"I am now leaving on a visit to Brazil at the invitation of its president. I will meet with President-elect Bolsonaro and with his ministers of defense, finance and foreign affairs.
We are eliminating Hezbollah's terrorist tunnels one after the other. They think they can produce weapons of destruction against us and we can overcome them with stratagems, daring and determination.
As part of foiling the threats, we are continuing with Operation Northern Shield on our border with Lebanon. Yesterday I toured the line with the IDF Chief-of-Staff, GOC Northern Command and the members of the Security Cabinet. I saw the excellent work that is being done there.
I have said that we will not be deterred from doing what is necessary. Therefore, we are called upon and we act. @POTUS Trump's decision to withdraw the American soldiers from Syria will not change our policy. We're standing steadfast on our red lines in Syria and everywhere else
We are not prepared to accept the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria which is directed against us. We will act against it vigorously and continuously including during the current period.
Course graduates, you have one mission: Defend the homeland and be victorious in war. Defending the homeland starts with eradicating major hostile threats.
This includes weapons systems, defensive systems and offensive missiles that can reach any target anywhere. In the history of the Middle East, there's never been aerial activity such as this. Aircraft ascend and descend, take off and land, and reach arenas near and far, very far.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the IAF pilots' course graduation ceremony: "Several days ago I visited Israel Aerospace Industries. They're developing special capabilities that no other country in the Middle East has, and I tell you that some of them, no other country in the world.

We have the ability of initiatives and creativity for new goods and services that are among the best in the world and for certain things are the best in the world. We have the ability due to our policy of opening new markets. https://t.co/GYqOojDBxr
The Israeli economy is strong and it is creating an important value -- competitive value for goods and services that we want to buy and we are doing so all the time.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the appointment ceremony for Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron:	"The steps that we have taken up until now have helped us weather major storms in the past and I am certain that we will also weather the current storm in the capital markets. https://t.co/3iDFdv141X
PM Netanyahu: "Erdogan is obsessed with Israel. But there has been an improvement. Erdogan used to attack me every two hours and now it is every six hours.
Erdogan is obsessed with Israel. He knows what a moral army is and he knows what a genuine democracy is, as opposed to an army that massacres women and children in Kurdish villages and a state which, to my regret, is becoming more dictatorial day by day.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, at an event with Christian IDF soldiers:	"We are proud of you; the entire nation is proud of you. You belong to the most moral army on earth.		Not everyone shares this view. I was just exposed to the daily trolling of the anti-Semitic dictator Erdogan.
This visit will also bring important diplomatic news: A 'turnaround' in Israel's relations with the largest country in Latin America. Step by step, methodically and persistently, we are turning Israel into a rising global power.
There are two ways to generate growth in the Israeli economy: One is to create new products and the other is to open new markets. Brazil is a huge market, almost 250m people; the opening of this gigantic market will create new jobs in Israel and greatly help the Israeli economy.
PM Netanyahu: This weekend I will leave on a historic visit to Brazil. Upon my arrival I will meet with President-elect Jair Bolsonaro and later with other leaders as well. 🇮🇱🇧🇷
On the Lebanese border, Operation Northern Shield is proceeding as planned. On Thursday we blew up an additional terror tunnel and we poured in concrete and sealed another one. This operation will continue until its completion in order to deny Hezbollah the tunnels weapon.
I would like to reassure those who are concerned. Our cooperation with the US will continue in full and finds expression in many areas: Operations, intelligence and many other security spheres.
PM Netanyahu: "The decision to withdraw 2,000 US troops from Syria will not change our consistent policy: We will continue to act against Iran's attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria, and to the extent necessary, we will even expand our actions there.

Israel stands with Albania as it stands with every country that sees the Iranian regime for what it is: the greatest threat to world peace and security.
Important news from Albania today. The Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, expelled the Iranian ambassador from Tirana. By doing so, Prime Minister Rama has sent a clear message to the Iranian radical Islamic regime – that plotting terror attacks has a cost.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this afternoon  with @POTUS Donald Trump on the issue of Syria. The two discussed ways to continue cooperation between Israel and the US against the Iranian aggression.

As we speak, we’re employing means to neutralize these tunnels, and we’ll continue to act in Syria to prevent Iran’s effort to militarily entrench itself against us. We are not going to reduce our efforts; we’re going to increase our efforts. https://t.co/oVsdGQrJ3l
These tunnels were built by Hezbollah with direct support &amp; funding from Iran. This is the Iranian web of aggression in the Middle East which also terrorizes Europe and the world. Israel continues its operation against the Hamas terror tunnels and will do so until its completion
As we seek to build prosperity, a pipeline for prosperity, there are forces in our region that seek to build tunnels for terror. And a few weeks ago, Israel launched a campaign to expose and neutralize cross-border terror tunnels on our northern border with Lebanon.
Today, we reaffirmed our commitment for the East-Med pipeline, discussed important aspects of the project, and we’re going to sign formally, officially this agreement in a few months. https://t.co/WWfTOCp2bD
Today we have a special guest with us, and the presence of our dear friend, @USAmbIsrael David Friedman, at our summit today reflects the US support for our partnership, for our projects and for our values, which the US shares.

This is, of course, an American decision. We will study its timetable, how it will be implemented and – of course – its implications for us. In any case we will take care to maintain the security of Israel and to defend ourselves in this area.

I call them to to demand that Lebanon stop allowing its territory to be used as an act of aggression and its citizens to be used as pawns; to support Israel's right to defend itself against Iranian-inspired and Iranian-conducted aggression.
I call on all the members of the UNSC to condemn Hezbollah's wanton acts of aggression; to designate Hezbollah, in its entirety, as a terrorist organization; to press for heightened sanctions against Hezbollah;
PM Netanyahu: I called on the UN to convene the Security Council and that meeting is taking place today. I appreciate the fact that the United States is taking an unequivocal stand against Hezbollah and pushing for the Security Council to hold this urgent meeting. https://t.co/670srr3r7g
PM Netanyahu: We think the international community should hold Iran, Hezbollah and Lebanon accountable and it should act accordingly. Because what you're seeing is not merely a grave violation of our sovereignty and our security, but a grave violation of any nation's security. https://t.co/kcWJz6IZs1
The people of Lebanon have to understand that Hezbollah is putting them in jeopardy. And we expect Lebanon to take action against this. And the fact that the Lebanese army is doing nothing means that they are either unable or unwilling or both to do anything about this.
It is important to understand what Hezbollah is doing here. It is committing a double war crime. It's targeting Israeli civilians, while hiding behind Lebanese civilians. Targeting Israeli civilians, while hiding behind Lebanese civilians. That's a double war crime. https://t.co/t86mxFdxPo
Hezbollah is doing all this because Iran supports it in every way, including with money. Money that it got from the flawed Iranian deal. And this is part of the Iranian web of aggression.
Their goal has been to penetrate our territory, to kidnap our people, including civilians, murder civilians and conquer the northern piece of the Galilee. 	This is not merely an act of aggression; it's an act of war. It is part of a war plan. It has been confirmed by UNIFIL.
PM Netanyahu: "A few weeks ago Israel launched a campaign to expose and neutralize a network of cross-border terror tunnels on our northern border with Lebanon.

PM Netanyahu: "We are fighting the arms of Iran and Hezbollah. We are exposing its tunnels and are systematically denying them all of the tunnels, just like we did with Hamas in the south by various means. We are denying them precision weaponry by various means.
PM Netanyahu: "We are striking Iran and Syria, and of course the US is striking Iran economically. We are working to shrink this body which is responsible for almost all of the security problems that the State of Israel has.

It is more likely that it will work in reverse. Links with the Arab world will bring normalization and create the conditions for developing links with the Palestinians.
Today we are going there without the Palestinians being involved and it is much stronger because it does not depend on their caprices. The Arab states are looking for links with the strong. Cultivating strengths gives us diplomatic power.
But what happened was that the Arab refusal, together with the terrorism of the intifada, cost us almost 2,000 lives and wiped out this hope, which was shelved under Oslo governments.
The expectation was that progress or a breakthrough with the Palestinians would open links for us with the Arab world. This would have been true if it had happened. It seemed as if it was about to happen with the Oslo process
There is a growing connection between Israeli companies and the Israeli world.		What is happening at the moment is that we are in a process of normalization with the Arab world without progress in the diplomatic process with the Palestinians.
Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed a conference of Israeli ambassadors to Latin American, Asian and African countries, at @IsraelMFA:	"A great change has been created here.

I thank the Austrian Chancellor for working to expose this absurdity and to precisely define anti-Zionism as a type of anti-Semitism.
Nobody can say that they are not against Americans, but they just think that America shouldn't exist, just as nobody can say that they are not against Jews, but they think that the state of the Jews does not need to exist.
I commend my friend Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, under whose leadership the EU has called for the adoption of this definition of Martin Luther King – anti-Zionism is an expression of anti-Semitism.
I recently read a cogent remark by the noted American human rights leader Martin Luther King: 'When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism.'
The Palestinian terrorists think that they can uproot us from the heart of our land. By our actions and the strength of our spirit we will make it clear to them and to the entire world that we are here to stay.
I have directed that the status of thousands of homes in settlements in Judea and Samaria be legalized, that two new industrial zones be established near Avnei Hefetz and Betar Ilit respectively, and that 82 new residential units be approved in Ofra. There will be other steps.
I sent a clear message to Hamas: We will not accept a situation in which there is a ceasefire in Gaza and terrorism in Judea and Samaria. We will exact a heavy price for this.
We have revoked work permits for terrorists' clans and in contrast to what has hitherto been the case, as Defense Minister I have ordered that the permits not be automatically restored after the revocation period.
Regarding the fourth, we are taking decisive action to find him and we will also deal with him to the fullest extent of the law. I ordered the acceleration of the demolition of terrorists' homes.
Following the wave of murderous terrorist attacks in Judea and Samaria last week we have taken vigorous security and settlement actions. Our forces located and eliminated two of the terrorists and a third turned himself in.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: This morning the IDF uncovered a fourth Hezbollah tunnel. Our operation to deny Hezbollah the tunnels weapon is proceeding according to plan and will continue until all of its goals are achieved.

Our security forces – the ISA and the IDF – are pursuing the murderers. They will capture them. We will deal with them to the fullest extent of the law and settle accounts with them.
There are, of course, cries of joy; I think it is too much to expect a condemnation from the Palestinian Authority. They only contribute to incitement here.
PM Netanyahu:	"We are all praying for the wellbeing of the wounded from last night's terrorist attack in Ofra. We support the doctors who are fighting for the baby's life. Abhorrent terrorists tried to murder a mother and the baby in her womb. This is monstrous.
It would be good if there was an agreement with the Palestinians, but it cannot be the condition. We are not conditioning our cohesion with the Arab world – normalization, on peace with the Palestinians. https://t.co/qaLmh5tMy3
PM Netanyahu: I will not mortgage peace with the Arab world on peace with the Palestinians. We are trying, and we will yet try, but one does not determine the other. https://t.co/Dz6fMZTqBI
This does not mean peace agreements yet, but it certainly says that a situation could be created in which our progress toward normalization and peace, instead of what we always thought, peace with the Palestinians to make peace with the Arab world, could actually be the reverse
PM: When I meet with Arab leaders they tell me 'We have security and economic interests and we also want to enjoy the fruits of progress and we will no longer mortgage our normalization with the State of Israel to the Palestinians' caprices.'

You need to go country by country, MFA by MFA, government by government, and tell them: Take a stand here against Hezbollah. It is a terrorist organization. Hezbollah flagrantly violated our sovereignty. Hezbollah is violating UNSC Resolution #1701. This is your time to act. https://t.co/qeXWg321zL

I told President Putin that we are continuing our policy: We will not allow Iran to establish a military presence in Syria. We will continue to take action against the precision weapons in Lebanon, and we will complete the operation to foil the tunnels threat.
This is in continuation of the very important talk we had in Paris, in order to ensure the continuation of the orderly coordination between the Russian military and the IDF, which has been maintained for several years now.
I spoke yesterday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. We agreed that the IDF and Russian military coordination delegations will meet soon, hopefully in the coming days, apparently in Moscow. President Putin and I will meet later on.
We need patience, but with the same perseverance we'll continue the operation until the tunnel threat in the north is neutralized. At the same time we're working in the intelligence sphere in order to denounce Hezbollah and Iran and to increase sanctions against both of them.
PM Netanyahu: Operation Northern Shield is continuing. IDF soldiers are working methodically and decisively around the clock, even in inclement weather, to expose and neutralize tunnel after tunnel.

In the recognition of Jerusalem, of our heritage and the link that that no other people and no other city have, @POTUS Trump simply spoke the truth, and truth is the basis for everything and the basis for peace.
Peace cannot be advanced on the basis of lies, and a policy based on lies is doomed to crash on the rocks of reality. @POTUS Trump, in a brave and genuine move, recognized what we know existed here not only since the Maccabees, but since the time of King David 800 years before
Here I must add the tremendous support that we receive from the US government and from @POTUS Donald Trump. Exactly one year ago he made a historic decision because it has historical importance and because it recognized history. https://t.co/yigLQJKz1C

All of this will come up at the upcoming meeting of the UN Security Council which Israel has demanded. This is an important political and diplomatic step that complements our operational and engineering effort to deny Hezbollah and Iran the tunnels weapon.
PM Netanyahu: "Israel expects an unequivocal condemnation of Hezbollah, the imposition of additional sanctions on Iran, a condemnation from the Lebanese government and a demand that it stop giving its approval for the use of its territory for these attacks against Israel. https://t.co/drJSOpmwzE
This operation is just beginning but in the end, the tunnels weapon, in which Hezbollah has invested so much, will not exist and will not be effective.
I told the ambassadors that they need to unequivocally condemn this aggression against us by Iran, by Hezbollah and by Hamas, and – of course – to also strengthen the sanctions against these elements.
PM Netanyahu:	"We are systematically and decisively denying our enemies the tunnels weapon. We are doing this with Hamas, and with Hezbollah; we will do whatever is necessary.	 	Whoever attacks us – is taking his life into his hands. Hezbollah knows this and so does Hamas. https://t.co/67XM72AZCm

True, there can be more bumps along the way, but we must approach this very aggressively and from strength. also morally, economically and vis-à-vis security.		This is a great day for the State of Israel. A great day for the people of Israel. A great day for the future of Israel.
I would like to thank President Donald Trump again for a courageous, determined and important decision. 	I think that this contributes to stability, security and peace.
Iran is the greatest threat to Israel, the Middle East and world peace. For many years I have devoted my time and energy to the war against the Iranian threat. In this matter I went almost against the whole world. Today we see the results of this long and continuous struggle.
I believed that sanctions must include this element of credit clearance. I raised this several times, even during my last meeting with US Treasury Secretary @stevenmnuchin1, and I am pleased that the US has decided to include the credit component.
We see the impact of these sanctions on the ground right now. And the second wave of sanctions, especially the sanctions imposed on the SWIFT, the banking clearing system used by the Iranian regime, will add a very severe blow to Iran's terrorist regime.
PM Netanyahu, today at the Knesset:  "This day is a historic day. This is the day on which the US, led by @POTUS Trump, imposed the most severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions imposed on Iran since the beginning of the effort to stop its aggression.
I was moved to see millions of people across the globe express their support and solidarity a week after 11 of our Jewish brothers and sisters were massacred in Pittsburgh. This is a time for unity. We must all stand together to fight antisemitism.	#ShowUpForShabbat
For years, I've been calling for sanctions to be fully reimposed against Iran's murderous terrorist regime, which threatens the entire world. The effect of the initial sanctions is already being felt: the rial has plummeted, Iran's economy is depressed and the results are evident
Thank you, @POTUS Trump, for the historic decision.	The sanctions are truly coming. https://t.co/9WuJmF3TuO
I want to thank President Trump for going with his family to pay their respects to the dead and to visit the wounded, and for his powerful statement that "those seeking their [the Jewish people’s] destruction – we will seek their destruction".
I want to thank all the leaders in the United States and around the world who have condemned this horrendous antisemitic attack.
PM: I called Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life synagogue to send once again my condolences to the bereaved families and to express my appreciation for the dignified way that he has represented the Jewish community of Pittsburgh in the wake of this horrific attack on Jews.

For over two decades, David served as an MK and initiated many laws the purpose of which was to benefit the citizens. He was an outstanding and industrious minister who brightened everyone's face; he loved peace and pursued peace. I and the entire government will miss him.

We are after a weekend of air strikes in Gaza. Yesterday we heard about an 'ultimatum' from Hamas to Israel. At no stage will Israel accept any ultimatum from Hamas. Israel will continue to act in accordance with Israeli interests and for Israel's security alone.
These were important talks - both for the State of Israel and very important talks for Israel's security. There will be more. https://t.co/RqiyOKHGGQ

Of course there is also the old and familiar anti-Semitism, and that of radical Islam. On all these fronts we must stand up and fight back against this brutal fanaticism. It starts with the Jews, but never ends with the Jews.
I call upon the whole world to unite in the fight against anti-Semitism everywhere. Today regretfully we refer to the US where the largest anti-Semitic crime in its history took place, but also, Western Europe, where there is a struggle against manifestations of new anti-Semitism
Israel stands at the forefront with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh, with all Jewish communities in the US and with the American people. We stand together, at the forefront, against anti-Semitism and displays of such barbarity.
It is very difficult to exaggerate the horror of the murder of Jews who had gathered in a synagogue on Shabbat and were murdered just because they were Jews.
On behalf of myself, the Government of Israel and the people of Israel, from the depth of our hearts, I send our condolences to the families who lost their loved ones. We all pray for the swift recovery of the wounded.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,  at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:	The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the people who were murdered in the shocking massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

Neither do I need fictitious ultimatums because we are all united around one goal – to evacuate this illegal construction.	There is no argument about this. A 'fake' argument is being created. Khan al-Ahmar will be evacuated and very soon.
We will give a last chance for evacuation by agreement but in any case Khan al-Ahmar will be evacuated.	I am not talking about a cosmetic evacuation but a real evacuation.
Prime Minister Netanyahu made the following remarks, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting:	"Khan al-Ahmar will be evacuated, with or without agreement. It will not take weeks; it will be much shorter. We will make several vital preparatory moves in the international arena.

I think Israel and the United State prove the resilience of free economies, which give freedom to their peoples for ingenuity, entrepreneurship, creativity. We have the same minds and we have the same heart. We have the same interests and the same values.
We have seen in recent years that pressure is the only thing that arrests the forward movement of the Iranian nuclear program and pressure is the only thing that rolls back Iran's aggression in the region. We're going to discuss how we can cooperate on this matter.
PM Netanyahu: The aggressive Iranian regime  has used the JCPOA to further that aggression to unbelievable heights. And that is why we welcome President Trump's bold decision to get out of the JCPOA.
And this is what is going to occupy a great deal of our discussions today – how to stop Iran's dual aggression: Its quest for a nuclear arsenal and its quest for a conventional arsenal and its plans of conquest in the Middle East. https://t.co/img4LxvElG
PM: The US-Israel alliance under @POTUS Trump has never been stronger.

The vision I believe in is to cancel the geographic and social periphery, to cancel the terms 'first Israel' and 'second Israel'. There is one Israel and it needs to be an integrated state, a state of equal opportunity, a state that cares for all of its citizens. https://t.co/u7Jb6NsPFs
We have opened dozens of such centers in what is called 'the periphery' in order to give this care, I want to say, this equal care for every Israeli citizen, and again, Jews and non-Jews, in the cities and in outlying areas. I think that this expresses the essence of our policy. https://t.co/7qrgcnfI1x

If you come in and you are virulently against America and you try to come to the United States, there's a good change you won’t be let in if people know that in advance.	That's also true of many of the European democracies. It's true of the democracy called Israel.
PM Netanyahu: "Every country and every democracy and many democracies have special arrangements where they decide who to let in and who not to let it.
PM Netanyahu: Iran wants to base itself next to Israel in order to destroy Israel. We will not let them do so. We back up these words with actions. Nothing has changed. We'll continue to do what we need to do to protect defend ourselves against those who would destroy us. https://t.co/qtjkROqrZh
PM Netanyahu: We have no better friends in the world than our Christian friends and I take this opportunity to thank you for your steadfast support. You are standing up for Israel and you are standing up for the truth and we stand up for you. https://t.co/EIJup1Db2i
Christians should enjoy all the freedom to worship as they please in the Middle East and anywhere else and the only place in the Middle East where they can do so is Israel. https://t.co/bEbV1DYx8u
Israel is the one country that protects the human rights of all. We protect the religious rights of all. We don’t just protect Christian religious sites – we protect Christian people.
When we handed Bethlehem over to the Palestinian Authority a Christian population of roughly 80%. Now it's about 20%. That change happened because in the PA areas, as well as throughout the Middle East, Christians are being constricted, pressured, also they're being persecuted. https://t.co/iC2PZ4NpHT
I think there's something unusual for Christians because Israel is the only country in the Middle East where the Christian community thrives and grows.
You can also tell the truth about something else: Israel is a robust democracy. It supports and protects the rights of all: the rights of Jews, Christians, Muslims – of all. And we are the only ones who do so in a very broad radius. https://t.co/79By7ysC42
And if there's one thing that I can ask you to do is to tell the truth. Tell the truth about our history, tell the truth about our present, tell the truth about who wants peace and who doesn’t want peace. https://t.co/vGuot3ksbM
People have to say the truth. You are ambassadors of truth. You're not merely the greatest ambassadors that Israel has around the world – you're champions of truth. https://t.co/UihB4BzoCw
Abbas has on his law books a rule, a law that says that if you sell land to Jews – you'll be executed. Some peace and some coexistence.

We are very close to a different kind of activity, an activity that will include very powerful blows.	If it has sense, Hamas will stop firing and stop these violent disturbances – now.
PM Netanyahu: Hamas, apparently, has not internalized the message. If they do not stop the violent attacks against us, they will be stopped in a different way and it will be painful – very painful.

Regarding Judea and Samaria, we are determined to act against terror everywhere, to find the murderers, to find the terrorists. We operate throughout the region – Syria, Gaza and many other places, with all necessary determination in order to maintain the security of Israel.
Today another terror tunnel was exposed. We are systematically dismantling the tunneling capability of Hamas. They must understand that it would not be worth their while to try us.
PM: @POTUS Trump has given full support to our policy and that this destroyer is visiting here today is an expression of that US support.		I think that this message has been received throughout the Middle East and I think that it has even been received beyond the Middle East.
We are determined to act in order to defend ourselves against the establishment of an Iranian military presence in Syria and against the activity of its proxies there.

To this end, I agreed with President Putin that IDF and Russian military working teams would meet soon. We will do what is necessary to defend the security of Israel.
We give full backing to the IDF in its actions to defend the state. We will continue to take action to prevent the establishment of an Iranian military presence in Syria and we will continue the security coordination between the IDF and the Russian military.
This morning I convened the Security Cabinet which received a full update on the recent events. The Security Cabinet ministers also share in the deep sorrow of the Russian families and the Russian people.
Since the tragic events in the skies over Syria I have spoken twice with President Putin. I expressed to him our deep regret over the loss of the crew of the Russian plane that was brought down by irresponsible Syrian anti-aircraft fire.
This is not to say that there haven't been exceptions but all in all there has been very great success. We did this with maximum and successful security coordination with the Russian military.
In the past three years Israel has been very successful in preventing both the establishment of an Iranian military presence in Syria and the attempts to transfer lethal weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
WATCH: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks prior to leaving for the UN General Assembly in New York. #UNGA https://t.co/0O12lszhVt
It was agreed to continue the dialogue between the professional teams and the inter-military coordination via the military channels.		Prime Minister Netanyahu again expressed his condolences over the death of Russian soldiers.
Prime Minister Netanyahu said that transferring advanced weapons systems into irresponsible hands will increase the dangers in the region, and added that Israel will continue to defend its security and its interests.
The Prime Minister expressed his confidence in the credibility of the IDF investigation and its conclusions, and reiterated that the Syrian military, which brought down the plane, and Iran, whose aggression is undermining stability, are responsible for the unfortunate incident.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
There is also very great importance to maintaining security coordination between Israel and Russia. I decided to send GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Norkin to Moscow with a double objective. To continue defending our citizens, and  to preserve the cooperation between our two countries.
I told him that the root of the problem is Iran's attempt to use Syrian territory for attacks against Israel and to arm our enemies, such as Hezbollah. I told him that we have the right of self-defense.
Regarding our relations with Russia, I spoke with President Putin on the eve of Yom Kippur, right before the start of the holy day. I expressed my regret and of the citizens of Israel over the deaths of the 15 Russian air crew members, whose plane was brought down by Syrian fire.
Then today I suggest that he think not twice but 20 times because if he confronts us he will receive a crushing blow that he cannot even imagine.
"I heard the arrogant words that came from the direction of Hezbollah. This comes from the same man who said after 2006 that if he had known what Israel's response would be to the abduction of three of our soldiers, he would have thought twice about doing it. https://t.co/uZXlXy2bSf
This goal guides me, along with bolstering our strength in defense, deterrence and offense. We will continue to ensure that the thread of our life is never severed.”
It might take some time, but I believe that gradually growing closer will bear significant fruit in the form of normalization and eventually, also peace.
The Middle East of today is replete with danger, yet rays of light do shine through. 	Our relations with the moderate Arab world are undergoing an unprecedented shift. Key countries are understanding better and better the value of having ties with Israel.
Those who try to kill us today in the Middle East are led first and foremost by Iran and its aggression, which blatantly calls for our destruction. 	It is our duty to protect ourselves from this danger. https://t.co/UUheiyNEcl

Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is prepared to share with Russia all necessary details for investigating the incident and proposed sending GOC Air Force Maj.-Gen. Amikam Norkin to Moscow to deliver all of the necessary details.
Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel was determined to prevent Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria as well as the attempts by Iran – which calls for the destruction of Israel – to transfer to Hezbollah of lethal  weapons for use against Israel.
Prime Minister Netanyahu noted the importance of continued security coordination between Israel and Russia, which has succeeded in preventing many losses on both sides in the past three years.

Regarding the talk about shortening terrorists' sentences – I strongly oppose this. I know that this is also the position of the Defense Minister and, therefore, it will not happen.
At the same time, Israel is constantly working to prevent our enemies from arming themselves with advanced weaponry. Our red lines are as sharp as ever and our determination to enforce them is stronger than ever.
When these intentions became clear beyond all doubt, and when the danger was on our very doorstep, the political leadership made a grievous mistake by not allowing a preemptive strike. We will never repeat this mistake.
Forty-five years ago, intelligence erred by holding to a mistaken assessment regarding the war intentions of Egypt and Syria.
We must do everything to prevent war. Its victims destroy the lives of families and they are a gaping wound in the heart of the nation. However, if war is forced upon us, we must do everything to win with minimal losses.
PM Netanyahu: This week we will mark, in synagogues and cemeteries, Yom Kippur, the holiest day of our people, and the day on which, 45 years ago, we absorbed a bloody attack that cost us thousands of victims.

The appeasement of Iran abets the relentless assault on the values and security of the free societies, and the time has come for Western governments to join the strong and clear effort by the Trump administration against the terror regime in Tehran.
On the contrary, what we are seeing is that while Iran is sending terrorist cells to Europe, European leaders are appeasing, and reconciling with, Iran, in the same week that the terrorist cells were due to carry out their operations, which we helped thwart. This is unacceptable.
The time has come for the world to unite in the fight against terrorist organizations. It is doing so to a certain extent against Daesh but it is not doing so against Iran.
The world is being challenged by radical Islam, radical Shiites on the one hand led by Iran, and radical Sunnis led by Daesh, but both have a single goal: to eliminate the free societies, as we recognize, to eliminate Israel and in the end to eliminate the West and others as well
Yesterday we marked 17 years since the awful terrorist attack against the American people at the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington. This operation was carried out by Al-Qaida, Al-Qaida has passed the torch to Daesh, even as Iran also promotes intl. terrorism. https://t.co/nzol6bMmnI

We are taking strong action against these attempts and against the attempts to produce precision weaponry in all sectors, near and far. We will continue to take such action on behalf of the security of Israel.

In the military sphere, the IDF will continue to take strong and determined action against Iran's attempts to station forces and advanced weapons systems in Syria. No agreement between Syria and Iran will deter us; neither will any threat deter us.
In the diplomatic sphere, we'll continue to apply pressure on the dangerous, extremist regime in Iran. Yesterday we saw the fruit of this pressure in remarks by the Iranian President who said many Iranians lost hope in the future and strength of Iran due to the economic sanctions
We're working to prevent Iran from establishing military presence in Syria. We won't relent in pursuit of this goal as we did not relent in bringing about the cancellation of the bad nuclear deal w/ Iran, a goal seen impossible when I put it on the intl agenda several years ago
This process bears hope within it that, in the end, the cycle of peace will be completed. But it is impossible to deny the fact that there are yet many enemies in this region and beyond.
This process, of normalization by leading countries in the Arab world with the strong State of Israel, is happening before our eyes on a scale that would have been impossible to imagine a few years ago.
The weak crumble, are slaughtered and are erased from history while the strong, for good or for ill, survive. The strong are respected, and alliances are made with the strong, and in the end peace is made with the strong.
PM Netanyahu: Shimon aspired toward peace but he knew that true peace can be achieved only if our hands strongly grasp defensive weaponry. In the Middle East, and in many parts of the world, there is a simple truth: There is no place for the weak. https://t.co/Quh681u47E

This is a magnificent change of history. This is what the Jewish state means – the ability of Jews to defend themselves.		With this newfound capacity of self-defense, we've built an extraordinary state in such a short time.
For the Jewish people, what has changed in these 75 years? Not the attempts to destroy us. They still seek to destroy us. Iran says so openly. Hamas says so openly and others.	What has changed is our ability to defend ourselves by ourselves. We are no longer defenseless. https://t.co/Qwj21wyzx7

PM Netanyahu: I think that the decision yesterday by the EU to give 18 million euros to Iran is a big mistake. It's like a poison pill to the Iranian people and to the efforts to curb Iranian aggression in the region and terror beyond the region.
At the same time the nuclear deal also brought to Iran's coffers billions and billions of dollars that were used for the purposes of oppressing their own people inside Iran who suffer under that tyranny and of course seeking to expand the conquest of the Middle East.
The nuclear deal with Iran threatened Europe as well because it didn't really stop the race to a nuclear weapon. It enabled Iran to pursue the enrichment of uranium unlimited within a few years what would open the path not to a nuclear bomb but to an entire nuclear arsenal https://t.co/yWhkOFnPqz

That's good. More should follow, more will follow, because Iran should not be rewarded for its aggression in the region, for its attempts to spread terrorism far and wide in the Middle East, into Europe as they did the other week and to many other places in the world.

I want to use this opportunity once again, to thank @POTUS Trump for walking away from the terrible deal with Iran. The nuclear deal did not block Iran's path to the bomb - it paved Iran's path to an entire nuclear arsenal.
Under @POTUS Trump, that alliance has grown stronger than it's ever been and your visit here gives us an opportunity to make it even stronger, and align our policies even more closely on Iran, Syria, Gaza and on the many challenges that face both our countries in this region. https://t.co/zxLUHoYpAC

PM Netanyahu instructed the PMO Director General to meet with Druze and Circassian local council heads and with the director generals of the relevant ministries and submit to the committee feasible steps to remove the impediments especially regarding housing and employment.
Among the issues discussed were the existing impediments to the implementation of Cabinet decision #959 regarding the "2016-19 Development Plan for Strengthening the Druze and Circassian Towns and Villages."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  convened the second meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Druze, Circassian and Minority Community Members who serve in the Security Forces Affairs, the establishment of which was decided upon last week.
The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between.
Now it is clearer than ever that the Nation-State Law is also necessary. It is necessary in order to ensure the future of the State of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people. We passed this law and we will uphold it.
It is for precisely this that we passed the Nation-State Law. We are proud of our state, our flag and our national anthem. Israel is a Jewish and democratic state. The individual rights of its citizens are anchored very well in the basic laws and other laws.
Many of the demonstrators want to abrogate the Law of Return, cancel the national anthem, fold up our flag and cancel Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and turn it into an Israeli-Palestinian state, and others say: A state of all its citizens.
Last night we received cogent testimony of the opposition to the existence of the State of Israel and the urgency of the Nation-State Law. Yesterday we saw PLO flags in the heart of Tel Aviv. We heard the calls: 'With blood and fire we will redeem Palestine.'
Our objective is to restore the quiet to residents of the south and the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip; this goal will be achieved in full.
As of now, we have destroyed hundreds of Hamas military targets, and in each round the IDF exacts an additional heavy price. I will not reveal here our operational plans, they are ready.
We are in the midst of a campaign against terror in Gaza. It entails an exchange of blows; it will not end in one strike. Our demand is clear – a complete ceasefire. We will not suffice with less than this.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:	"This is only the beginning. We will continue to take determined action against organizations that seek to delegitimize the State of Israel and strive to defame the state and the IDF around the world."
Pursuant to the diplomatic efforts of PM Netanyahu, the EU  announced that it will immediately stop funding and contact with the "Freedom Protection Council", an NGO operating in Israel, which undermines the State of Israel's right to exist and seeks to defame it around the world
I call upon the countries of Europe, which talk about stopping Iran, to join this measure. The time has come to stop talking and to take action, and that is exactly what the US has done and what Europe should do.
This decision represents the determination to curb Iran’s aggression in the region and its ongoing intention to arm itself with nuclear weapons.
I congratulate @POTUS Trump and the US administration for making the important decision to impose sanctions on Iran. This is an important moment for Israel, the US, the region and the entire world. https://t.co/dFGCCcG2Fb

IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot updated the Security Cabinet on the situation regarding Gaza.	The IDF is prepared for any scenario.
And indeed, the policy here is correct both economically and socially, and we will continue on these two axes on behalf of the citizens of Israel.
Year after year we see a decline in the disparity index, which is improving step by step, because we are combining, first of all, a free market policy with entry into the labor force, and as soon as people enter the labor force their situation improves.
This attests to the responsible economic policy that we in the government have been conducting – the Finance Minister and fellow ministers. This policy has led to continuous growth in the Israeli economy.
Over the weekend we received important news. The credit rating company Standard &amp; Poor's raised Israel's rating to AA, which positions Israel among the strongest economies in the world. This joins, of course, the confirmation of Israel's credit rating by Moody's several weeks ago
The deep bond between the Druze community and our commitment to it are essential; today we will establish a special ministerial committee to advance this bond &amp; commitment and will appreciate those of all religions and all ethnic communities who serve in the IDF / security forces
Therefore, we legislated the Nation-State Law in order to ensure the existence of the State of Israel as a state that is not only democratic but as the national state of the Jewish people and of it alone. This is necessary not only for our generation but for coming generations.
It could be that this law will be able to assist us in blocking future entry of labor migrants.		These and other things are happening because the laws of the state anchored in basic laws only individual rights without any constitutional balance vis-à-vis our national component.
The Nation-State Law, for example, prevents the exploitation of the family reunification clause under which many Palestinians have been absorbed into the country since the Oslo agreement, and this law helps prevent the continued uncontrolled entry into Israel of Palestinians.
The Nation-State Law, first of all, entrenches the Law of Return. It raises it to another level and this law, of course, grants an automatic right to Jews, and only to them, to come here and receive citizenship.
Nobody has harmed – and nobody intends to harm – these individual rights but without the Nation-State Law it will be impossible to ensure for generations the future of Israel as a Jewish national state.
PM Netanyahu: The State of Israel is the national state of the Jewish people. Israel is a Jewish and democratic state. Individual rights are anchored in many laws including Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty.

PM Netanyahu:	"The decision by Standard &amp; Poor's to raise Israel's credit rating joins a similar decision by Moody's. These decisions reflect the strength of the Israeli economy and the correct and responsible economic policy that we are leading on behalf of Israel's citizens."
If Iran tries to block the Bab-el-Mandeb, I am convinced that it will find itself facing a determined international coalition to prevent this. This coalition would also include the State of Israel and all its arms.
At the start of the week we witnessed a sharp clash with Iranian proxies who tried to obstruct international navigation in the straits at the entrance to the Red Sea.
PM Netanyahu at the Navy officers' course graduation ceremony:	The sea provides many opportunities. Above all it increases the small size of the State of Israel and allows us to deploy our vessels above and below the waves across a vast area. This gives Israel considerable power.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and the team on the issue of the Druze community reached an historic outline that constitutes a revolution in the legal status of minority community members who serve in the security forces, particularly the Druze community. https://t.co/7BJjkHVPx4
This is a tough story.	But you need to hear it. https://t.co/C1Qf37ssjp
You are describing genuine feelings and we must find a solution. I will continue holding consultations. We will establish a team led by staff head Yoav Horowitz and we will submit forthwith recommendations for actions that will strengthen the important ties between us.
The law does not detract at all from the individual rights of anybody. It is designed to make the necessary legal balance, the time for which has come, in order to ensure the character of the State of Israel.
PM: There are unending attempts to rescind the definition of the State of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people. We legislated the Nation-State Law to ensure that Israel will remain the national state of our people – this is the purpose of the state's existence.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with ministers Yariv Levin and Ayoob Kara, met today with Druze local council heads as part of the Prime Minister's ongoing talks with Druze community leaders. https://t.co/tIju50MFiT
What is the meaning of national rights? They define the flag, the national anthem, the language and, that one of the basic goals of the state is the ingathering of exiles of our people and their absorption here in the land of Israel. This is the meaning of the Zionist vision.
However, we have never determined the national rights of the Jewish People in its land in a basic law – until now, when we passed the Nation-State Law.
We determined the personal equal rights of Israeli citizens in a series of laws inc. Basic Law: Human Dignity &amp; Liberty, laws that ensure full equality before the law, beginning with the right to vote and be elected and ending with all other personal rights in the State of Israel
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 	The State of Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, with full equal rights for all of its citizens. This is the meaning of the words 'a Jewish and democratic state'.

PM Netanyahu: I have reiterated and made clear that we will not accept any such violation. We will not accept any such penetration of, or spillover into, our territory, neither on the ground nor in the air.
Our air defense systems identified a Syrian Air Force jet that took off from the T-4 Syrian Air Force base and penetrated Israeli airspace. This is a gross violation of the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement with Syria. https://t.co/nvugZpNQGf
Turkey, under Erdogan's rule, is becoming a dark dictatorship whereas Israel scrupulously maintains equal rights for all its citizens, both before and after introducing this law.

We have vast export potential and we are realizing it thanks to the correct policy of the government. The moves that we are leading will strengthen not only the Israeli economy, but also our diplomatic ties on every continent.
It joins a series of decisions that we have led to strengthen economic ties with global markets, especially India, China and the countries of Latin America and Africa. Israel is a global leader in technology, agriculture, water, health and medicine.
Third, pursuant to the upgrade in Israel's credit rating by Moody's, which we all welcome, today the Cabinet will approve a decision to advance Israeli activity in the field of international development. This step continues to establish Israel's standing in the world.
Israel will continue to act against any attempt by Iran and its proxies to establish a military presence in Syria.
I will present to the Russian delegation the position that I presented to President Putin during my last visit to Moscow: Israel insists that [1974] Separation of Forces Agreement between it and Syria be honored as it was in the decades before the outbreak of civil war in Syria
The delegation is here at the request of President Putin, in a conversation he had with me a few days ago. I will discuss with it regional issues, the situation in Syria being first and foremost.
Today I will meet with a Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the Russian Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov.
In this context, I must point out that our diplomatic and military cooperation with US is at an all-time high.
I would like to commend the strong position expressed yesterday by @POTUS Trump and @SecPompeo against the aggression of the regime in Iran. Over the years, this regime has been spoiled by the major powers and it is good to see that the US is changing this unacceptable equation.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this evening with Ariel Beit-Halahmi, the coach of Israel's National Under-20 Basketball Team after the team won the FIBA 2018 U20 European Championship earlier today.
At the same time we are also taking action in the south. We hit Hamas very hard over the weekend and – if it proves necessary – we will hit them seven-fold.
Therefore, I approved their passage through Israel to additional countries, as an important humanitarian gesture.	 	Concurrently, we will not stop taking action in Syria against Iran's attempts to establish a military presence there.
Several days ago @POTUS Trump contacted me, as did @CanadianPM Trudeau and others, and requested that we assist in evacuating hundreds of 'White Helmets' from Syria. These are people who have saved lives and whose lives were in danger. https://t.co/mGzFCvPe1X

We believe that of all the sources of militant Islam, Iran is the greatest threat to our common civilization. And by being here, in this county here, at the frontline of the battle against radical Islam, in many ways Israel is defending Europe.
We both understand that the threat of radical Islam is a real one. It could endanger Europe, It could endanger the world. It certainly endangers us and our Arab neighbors.
In addition to preserving the memory of the past, Hungary and Israel are seizing the future. 	I see the tremendous possibilities of cooperation between our two economies. And we indeed cooperate in so many areas, in technology, in commerce, in tourism, in security and much more.
Antisemitism has been the scourge of the Jewish people for thousands of years. It claimed horrible tragedies, culminating in the greatest tragedy of them all – the Holocaust in the 20th century.	It must be fought continuously, relentlessly, unambiguously. https://t.co/4KQLjf2KK2

We're in a campaign that entails an exchange of blows. I can tell you that the IDF is ready for any scenario. I was very impressed by what I saw here and I know that like me, every Israeli citizen believes in the IDF and gives it their backing ahead of any possible development"

I heard it being said that Israel has agreed to a ceasefire that would allow the continuation of terrorism by incendiary kites and balloons; this is incorrect. We are not prepared to accept any attacks against us and we will respond appropriately.
The IDF dealt Hamas the harshest blow since Operation Protective Edge. I hope that they got the message; if not, they will get it later.

They say: 'Israel has a presence on the global stage.' This presence will find expression the day after tomorrow when I meet in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to discuss with him about our two countries' common interests.
Even though we are barely one percent of some of these countries, and have a smaller population than all of them, we are there thanks to the citizens of Israel, thanks to the statesmanship.
We were recently informed that Israel has currently been ranked as the eighth most powerful country in the world after the US, Russia, China and Japan.
Lastly, all these steps and many others that I will not detail here, with the economy, diplomacy, security, intelligence and energy, in all matters that members here deal with, all these steps are bearing fruit.
This will cost a lot of money and will have to be spread over years, but it will be brought to the Cabinet in the coming days.
Along with the Finance Minister and the Defense Minister we are preparing a package consisting of a multi-year plan with many resources to deal with  earthquakes. We already took an important action with the TAMA 38 construction plan, but there is a need for additional measures.
In the north: We are safeguarding the State of Israel from threats in the north. But there are also additional threats in the north, natural threats, from earthquakes.
In a significant step, today we are closing the Kerem Shalom crossing. There will be additional steps; I will not go into details.
PM Netanyahu: "About Gaza, I have been telling you for some time that I do not intend to publicize in advance all the steps that we are taking or planning. But the Defense Minister and I agree that we will be heavy-handed with the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip – immediately.

This started with the effort of Jabotinsky and Trumpledor with the British authorities during the WW1 and in cooperation with the legendary commander of these forces Col. John Henry Patterson, whom my family knew well. Today we will receive a new addition of Jabotinsky's writings
His great work in establishing combat brigades in the British army during the First World War, in effect, laid the important foundations for the establishment of the IDF.
Before anything else, there was the establishment of a Jewish fighting force after generations in which we did not have the strength to wield the sword and defend ourselves.
We are marking 78 years since the passing of Zeev Jabotinsky . I think that with the perspective of history it is possible to understand the magnitude of his contribution to the Zionist enterprise. https://t.co/1V6RpTUzaW
However, various comments were made after its publication. I have listened intently to the comments of the historians, including about several things that were not included in the declaration. I respect this and I will give expression to it.
This goal was achieved. I thank the team of Joseph Ciechanover and Jacob Nagel for succeeding in removing the criminal clauses from the Polish law.	The declaration that was published following the change in the law was overseen by a senior historian.
Regarding the Polish law, the goal of the contacts with the Polish government was to abrogate the criminal clauses in the Polish law that cast a pall of fear over research and free discourse regarding the Holocaust.
It is self-evident that I am in regular contact with the American administration. These links with the two great powers are very important to the security of Israel at all times and especially at present.
Second, we will demand that Syria, and the Syrian military, strictly uphold the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement
At the meeting I will reiterate the two basic principles of Israel's policy: First, we will not tolerate the establishment of a military presence by Iran and its proxies anywhere in Syria – not close to the border and not far away from it.
PM Netanyahu: 	This week I will fly to Moscow for an important meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. We meet from time-to-time in order to ensure security coordination and, of course, to discuss regional developments.

I've been told IBM's Project Debater was developed in Israel. It has enormous implications.
Mossad Director Yossi  Cohen:	"We remember Eli Cohen and do not forget. His heritage, of dedication, determination, courage and love of the homeland, is our heritage. We remember and have maintained a close connection over the years with his family, Nadia and the children."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:	"I commend the fighters of the Mossad for the determined and courageous operation, the sole objective of which was to return to Israel a memento from a great fighter who greatly contributed to the security of the state."
After Eli Cohen's execution on 18 May 1965, the wristwatch was held by an enemy state. Upon the watch's return to Israel, special research and intelligence operations were carried out which culminated in the unequivocal determination that this was indeed Eli Cohen's watch.
In the annual memorial ceremony for Eli Cohen, several weeks ago, Mossad Dir. Yossi Cohen returned to Eli Cohen's family the wristwatch that he used in Syria. It is currently on display at the Mossad HQ as a memorial to the legendary fighter and will be transferred to the family.
The Mossad returned to Israel the wristwatch of the late Mossad fighter Eli Cohen. The wristwatch was returned in a special Mossad operation which took place recently. https://t.co/d23FEkyFTW

PM Netanyahu: 	"It was no coincidence that this attack was thwarted.		I call on the leaders of Europe:	Stop financing the terrorist regime that is financing terrorism against you on your soil. Enough with the policy of appeasement and weakness regarding Iran."
This week there was an example of Iran's boundless hypocrisy and brazen gall: Iran's President met leaders in Europe in order to try and overcome @POTUS Trump's sanctions regime – and I tell you that this attempt will fail – even as Iran planned a terrorist attack on French soil.
Even when we are the few against the many and when it is necessary to stand against the entire world we do this here, in our region; we do it in the international arena, we break down wall after wall, and sometimes it is necessary to break down walls of hypocrisy.

Regarding southern Syria, we will continue to defend our borders. We will extend humanitarian assistance to the extent of our abilities. We won't allow entry into our territory and we will demand that the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement with the Syrian army be strictly upheld
At a time when the US is economically striking at the Iranian regime, we are working to prevent Iranian forces and those of its proxies from establishing a military presence anywhere in Syria, and we will continue to do so.
Our goal is what it always has been: To prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons and to break the cash machine that the agreement gave Iran, which finances its aggression in the region including Syria.
The change in the US position toward Iran is a strategic turnaround in Israel's situation. I believed that his change was possible when I stood up against the entire world in order to cancel this bad agreement.
Iran is investing billions of dollars in financing terrorism in the region and around the world, and in aggression in the region, instead of investing them in the Iranian people, and the Iranian people are protesting this, and rightly so.
PM Netanyahu: The Iranian regime is feeling very well the coming reimposition of the economic sanctions against it. The Iranian economy is at a low point. One needs to see the data in order to believe.

It is clear to all that the Holocaust was an unprecedented crime which was perpetrated by Nazi Germany against the Jewish nation, including the Jews of Poland.
Our ties with Poland are very important and are based on trust. Israel and Poland share the responsibility of upholding the memory of the Holocaust.

The issue also came up of how it might be possible to resolve the humanitarian problem in Gaza without strengthening Hamas. These matters are clear – first of all how to ensure security and how to prevent a broader flare-up, if it is at all possible.
I must say that there was absolute support for our positions and our actions to ensure the security of the State of Israel and its citizens in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, which was expressed publicly by the American administration's envoys.

The US decision to leave this prejudiced body is an unequivocal statement that enough is enough.		Israel welcomes the American announcement.
Instead of dealing with regimes that systematically violate human rights, the UNHRC obsessively focuses on Israel, the one genuine democracy in the Middle East.

Palestinians who threaten us will find an Israel determined as ever to defend itself. Palestinians who reach out to us in peace and friendship will find an outstretched hand in return.
While we work to improve daily lives for the people of Gaza and to return our soldiers and civilians, we should also work to take advantage of the many positive changes occurring in the region to advance a genuine and durable peace.
Prime Minister Netanyahu looks forward to discussing the issue of Gaza with Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman next week, as well as to discussing ways to advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians and between Israel and the broader Arab world.
That is why Israel welcomes all efforts that would improve conditions for the people of Gaza while preventing Hamas from building its military capabilities to launch further attacks against Israel and demanding prompt return of the Israeli soldiers and civilians Hamas is holding
While Israel will continue to defend itself and protect the security of its citizens, Israel will continue to seek ways to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.		The people of Gaza are not our enemy. Hamas is.
For his part, President Abbas has only made the humanitarian situation in Gaza worse by reducing payments of salaries to Gaza and by refusing to pay for electricity provided to Gaza.
Rather than improve the lives of the people of Gaza, Hamas is using the civilian Palestinian population as human shields in its unremitting terror war against Israel.
As for Gaza, Hamas is responsible for the terrible situation there and for the loss of life and suffering that has occurred as a result of the violent riots it has instigated over the last few weeks.
The UN’s incessant focus on Israel not only brings shame to the organization. It also draws attention away from so many other pressing issues that demand the attention of the international community.
Prime Minister’s Office:	Israel appreciates the Trump administration’s steadfast support for Israel at the United Nations and Ambassador Haley’s strong statement today exposing the hypocrisy of the UN’s bias against Israel.
Prime Minister Netanyahu has discussed this with German Chancellor Merkel in their previous meetings including last week. The Prime Minister would like to thank the Chancellor for dealing with the issue.
PM Netanyahu: This is a great contribution to the Israeli security industry and to Israeli economy. The giant deal is an expression of the strategic partnership between Germany and Israel and attests to the potential of Israeli industry to contribute to countries such as Germany.

Do you see that here? Anywhere? 	No. It’s never been about a Palestinian state. It’s always been about the Jewish state. Recognize the Jewish state. Stop paying terrorists. And invest in peace.
I think it would change the world, and the Palestinians could aspire to become scientists and doctors. Instead, they erect statues to mass murderers. That’s what they have.
Imagine that he invested this in the project of peace. Imagine that they invested it in Ramallah, or for that matter in Gaza. Imagine what this would do.
Imagine what would happen if President Abbas would not invest hundreds of millions of dollars each year in paying terrorists and the families of terrorists who murdered innocent people.
PM Netanyahu at @AJCGlobal:	I think that the problem we face is this: The reason we don’t have peace is not because of the absence of a Palestinian state. It’s been offered many, many times, and it’s been rejected many many times because it always had a condition: No Jewish state https://t.co/TT4rU2Ohi6
Iran will use its nuclear arsenal first against us, and then with the long-range missiles that they’re building and that the deal doesn’t prevent them from building, against everyone else.
This deal was applauded by many in the international community who are not in the missile range of Iran, but Israel and Saudi Arabia and others said this deal will ultimately give Iran a nuclear arsenal
Now, imagine that President Trump would come back with some deal, and Britain, France and Germany would applaud it and South Korea and Japan would say that it endangers their existence. You’d think you’d listen to this, right? So, the same thing happened with the Iran deal.

In any case, I made it clear that we will take strong action against attempts to establish a presence against us, and also against attacks on us. I think that this is understood and accepted by these leaders.
Even though Iran's departure from Syria is a long process, I believe that if you set a goal, if you know where you are going, you have a greater chance of getting there.
The leaders agreed with the main goal that I set, and this is formulating a broad international agreement that Iran needs to leave Syria, from all of Syria. This was the goal of the trip and it was, to a large extent, achieved.
I concentrated on the Iranian aggression in our region, on the latest developments in our region and – first and foremost – on Iran's efforts to establish a military presence in Syria.
They are showing Israel at its best and are really rendering assistance and saving lives. We're all proud of our mission and of our doctors.	Last week I visited Europe and I spoke with 3 main leaders there: Chancellor Merkel, French President Macron and British PM May.

Secondly, the other part of Palestinian society, the Palestinian Authority has cut back the money – a combination of choking Gaza financially from one Palestinian side and diverting resources for terrorism on the other side has created an economic crisis.
It’s true that the reason Gaza is in an economic and humanitarian crisis is because Hamas diverts an enormous amount of resources from civilian needs to terror tunnels and other weapons of war.
It’s a new technique, it’s a tactic of terrorists who attack civilian targets and hide behind civilians, or in this case use civilians as human shields. I think we should condemn it, and discuss ways how we can prevent this. https://t.co/g1asHDT6p6
This is not a non-violent protest; quite the contrary. We are doing everything we can to both minimize casualties, and at the same time protect Israeli lives. I think you recognize this. https://t.co/kqhafWJmUF

Ayatollah Khamenei, ruler of Iran, declared his intention to destroy Israel.	Yesterday he explained how he would do this – with the unrestricted enrichment of uranium, to produce an arsenal of nuclear bombs.		We are not surprised.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara met today with French Jewish community leaders in Paris.		https://t.co/hWZSH0Wb3y https://t.co/6bt9lXHywE
We think it’s important, as Chancellor Merkel said, that the IAEA investigate Iran based on this new information, that Israel has now provided the IAEA. And it’s important to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. We commit and I commit again that we will not let that happen https://t.co/azL3QgBXzr
As Chancellor Merkel has said, we have shared with the German government, German specialists, the information that we retrieved from a secret atomic archive that Iran has https://t.co/CJmb3ybdEj
It means destroying another six million plus Jews. It’s quite extraordinary that this goes on, but this is what we face.		Iran calls for our destruction, but it’s also seeking nuclear weapons to carry out its genocidal designs. We know that for a fact.
The greatest danger is in Iran. Just yesterday, Iran’s leader Khamenei, yesterday he said again that Israel is a cancer that has to be eradicated, will be eradicated from the earth. It is amazing that in the beginning of the 21st century, somebody talks about destroying Israel.
We have great opportunities, but we also face great challenges, and I think the greatest challenge that the civilized world faces today is the danger that comes out from militant Islamic states that are bent on aggression and acquiring nuclear arsenals. https://t.co/wnndF0ojN8

We will also mark 70 years of friendly relations between Israel and France in very many areas – culture, trade, tourism and – of course – innovation. For this we will have a special event with President Macron."
These are meetings with three very important leaders in Europe. I think that it is a good thing that I have a very personal, close and very good connection with them. This is important for the State of Israel.
The second issue is blocking Iran's aggression in the region, especially its attempts to establish a military presence against us in Syria and attack us from there. On this issue I hope to form an agreed-upon policy.
First of all, there is the need to continue the pressure on Iran against its nuclear program. I believe that this pressure should be increased. It could be that there is not full agreement on this at the moment, but in my opinion, such an understanding will take shape.
PM Netanyahu: "I am now leaving on an important visit to Europe. I will meet with three leaders and I will raise two issues there: Iran and Iran."		https://t.co/Yl9W7hmZjV https://t.co/OakLzEnRVs

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this evening with Kentucky Governor @GovMattBevin. https://t.co/PlOGPfcbZN
I recently discussed these issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin and American Secretary of State Pompeo. These talks are very important for the security of Israel
The second thing is the blocking of Iran's plans for expansion &amp; aggression throughout the Middle East. I'll insist on a basic principle: Israel retains – and will continue to retain – freedom of action against the establishment of an Iranian military presence anywhere in Syria
Of course, I will reiterate an unchanging truth: Israel will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons
Tomorrow I will leave for Europe to meet with three main leaders: Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May. While I will discuss with them developments in the region, the emphasis will be on Iran, first of all on continuing to block Iran's nuclear program

PM Netanyahu:	Next week I am going to Germany, France and Britain. I will meet with Chancellor Merkel, President Macron and PM May.	I will present the latest strategic developments in our region, which are connected to the efforts to halt Iranian aggression in Syria and elsewhere
I salute the fighters of the IDF and the security forces and I commend the resilience of the residents of the south.
The Hamas regime, Islamic Jihad and the other terrorist organizations, inspired by Iran, are responsible for the escalation. 		One thing is clear: When they test us, they pay immediately. And if they continue testing us, they will pay dearly.

In any case, we will always act according to our security interests, with or without understandings. We will defend ourselves by ourselves, unified, united, and determined to ensure our security and our future.
The long-range missiles Iran is working to station in Syria will endanger us even beyond the range of several kilometers from southern Syria; therefore, Iran needs to leave Syria altogether. We're not party to understandings to the effect that we have agreed to less than this.
I would like to reiterate: We are acting against an Iranian military presence anywhere on Syrian territory. An Iranian departure from southern Syria alone will not suffice.
Regarding Syria, I made clear our red lines many times, and we will enforce them without compromise. We will not allow Iran to establish a military presence in Syria and operate against us from there, to transfer dangerous weapons from Syria to Lebanon, or produce them in Lebanon
The IDF will respond with great force to these attacks. Israel will exact a heavy price from anyone who tries to attack it, and we view Hamas as responsible for preventing such attacks against us.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: 	Israel views with utmost gravity the attacks against it and its communities by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from the Gaza Strip. https://t.co/EVQmryifrz
In France I will also represent Israel at celebrations marking 70 years of ramified cultural relations between Israel and France; there is much to celebrate.
Regarding Syria our position is clear: We believe that there is no room for any Iranian military presence anywhere in Syria. And this reflects not only our position; I can say with certainty that it also reflects the positions of others in the Middle East and outside it.
I will discuss with them blocking Iranian nuclear aspirations and expansion in the Middle East. I will present our positions as clearly as possible. We are well experienced. For years we stood alone against these twin threats and I think the situation has changed for the better.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today at the Knesset:	Next week I will leave for Europe. I will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with French President Emmanuel Macron and perhaps with British Prime Minister Theresa May as well.
The IDF and the security forces are working around the clock to protect the State of Israel, Israeli citizens and Israel's borders.
Neither will we tolerate attacks against us from the Gaza Strip. Last night the air force attacked terrorist targets deep in the Gaza Strip after our forces had taken action against Hamas targets along the contact line and neutralized an IED on the fence.
All of these weapons are for use against the State of Israel and it is our right – based on the right of self-defense – to prevent their manufacture or transfer.
We are working to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons, and against the establishment of an Iranian military presence against us; to this end we are also operating against the transfer of deadly weapons from Syria to Lebanon or their manufacture in Lebanon.
The regime in Tehran is the main element undermining stability in the Middle East. The campaign against its aggression is not over; we are still in the midst of it.
Over the weekend I spoke with US Secretary of State @SecPompeo. I told him that I very much appreciated the determined position of the US administration regarding the nuclear agreement with Iran and against Iranian aggression in our region.
We express deep sorrow over the passing of Duvdevan unit fighter St.-Sgt. Ronen Lubarsky. He was mortally wounded during an operation last week in Ramallah. Duvdevan has contributed, and is contributing, greatly to the security of Israel and saving the lives of Israeli citizens.

Israel completely rejects the resolution that was adopted by an	automatic anti-Israel majority whose results were known from the start. Israel will continue to defend its citizens and soldiers as it has the right to defend itself.

So we have a common battle to fight terrorism, and to fight the sponsors and dispatchers of terrorists. 	And we are doing it in the Middle East, but I think as I said, it encompasses today the entire world.
PM:  The preeminent terrorist state of our time is Iran. Iran was responsible for the horrible terrorist attacks in Argentina, and I think beyond that. In some of the things that you were referring to, I have no doubt that they had a hand.
PM: I think the potential is enormous, because the future belongs to those who innovate. Israel is the, I would say is the innovation nation. Panama has tremendous advantages, which involve world trade and your wise management of those opportunities. Together we can do much more. https://t.co/pWVQzL2lHT

They are not defending us from some civilian demonstrations. This is a warlike move by the Hamas. The Hamas spokesperson said today that about 50 of the 60 who were killed are Hamas operatives. We have similar figures.

Pulling out of the nuclear deal means that the world’s greater sponsor of terrorism, greatest sponsor of terrorism, is no longer on a glide-path to attaining an arsenal of nuclear weapons. This is good for Israel, this is good for the region, it’s good for the world.
And to achieve peace, we have to do one other thing: We must confront the enemies of peace, and I thank President Trump for his decision to confront Iran rather than to appease it.
You base peace on the foundations of truth, and not only has Jerusalem been the capital of the Jewish people for millennia and capital of our state from its inception, the truth is that under any peace agreement you could possibly imagine, Jerusalem will remain Israel’s capital.
I call on all countries to join the US in moving their embassies to Jerusalem. Move your embassies to Jerusalem because it’s the right thing to do. Move your embassies to Jerusalem because it advances peace, and that’s because you can’t base peace on a foundation of lies.
I thank Guatemala’s Foreign Minister, who is here, Sandra Jovel, who has joined us today. We will open your embassy 2 days from tomorrow. Thank you.

PM Netanyahu spoke with UK PM @theresa_may; discussed the Iranian aggression, latest developments in the region and the situation in Syria.	PM Netanyahu expressed appreciation for UK's condemnation of the Iranian missile fire, and its support for Israel's right to defend itself.
I repeat: Whoever hurts us – we will hurt them sevenfold, and whoever is preparing to hurt us – we will act to hit them first. This is what we have done and this is what we will continue to do.
The international community needs to prevent the Iranian Al-Quds force from establishing itself in Syria. We need to unite in order to cut off its spreading tentacles of evil there and everywhere.
This is exactly what happened yesterday – Syrian military batteries fired surface-to-air missiles against us and, therefore, we attacked them.
Yesterday I delivered a clear message to the Assad regime: Our action is directed against Iranian targets in Syria; however, if the Syrian military acts against us, we will act against it.
No rocket landed in Israeli territory and our policy is clear: We will not allow Iran to establish a military presence in Syria.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "Iran crossed a red line. We responded accordingly. The IDF carried out a very wide-ranging attack against Iranian targets in Syria.		Thanks to a correct deployment of our forces both offensively and defensively, the Iranian action failed.

I told President Putin it is the right of every state, certainly Israel's right, to take steps to defend itself against this aggression. I think matters were presented in a direct manner. These matters are  important to Israel's security at all times and especially at this time.
They are trying to transfer forces and deadly weapons there with the explicit goal of attacking the State of Israel as part of their strategy to destroy the State of Israel.
In these talks I presented our perspective on issues including Iran's secret nuclear archive and the current tension.		I presented Israel's obligation and right to defend itself against Iranian aggression, from Syrian territory. The Iranians declare their intention to attack us.
PM Netanyahu: I have just finished almost ten hours in the company of President Putin. We attended very moving events – the parade marking the victory over the Nazis and other events, and of course there were also good and useful talks. https://t.co/a1pkk2aeea

I'm now leaving for an important meeting with Russian President Putin. The meetings between us are always important and this one is especially so.

PM: "I am now leaving for an important meeting with Russian President Putin. Our meetings are always important and this one is especially so. In light of what is currently happening in Syria, it is necessary to ensure continued coordination between Russian military and the IDF."
This is why Israel thinks that @POTUS Trump did an historic move and why Israel thanks him for his courageous leadership, his commitment to confront the terrorist regime in Tehran and his commitment to ensure Iran never gets nuclear weapons, not today, not in a decade, not ever.
And as we exposed last week, since the deal, Iran intensified its efforts to hide its secret nuclear weapons program.		So if you leave all of this unchanged, all this combined is a recipe for disaster, a disaster for our region, a disaster for the peace of the world.
Despite the deal, the terrorist regime in Tehran is developing a ballistic missiles capability, ballistic missiles to carry nuclear warheads far and wide, to many parts of the world.
Since the deal, we’ve seen Iran’s aggression grow every day- in Iraq, in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Gaza, and most of all, in Syria, where Iran is trying to establish military bases from which to attack Israel.
The removal of sanctions under the deal has already produced disastrous results. The deal didn’t push war further away, it actually brought it closer. The deal didn’t reduce Iran’s aggression, it dramatically increased it, and we see this across the entire Middle East.
Israel has opposed the nuclear deal from the start because we said that rather than blocking Iran’s path to a bomb, the deal actually paved Iran’s path to an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs, and this within a few years’ time.
PM Netanyahu: Israel fully supports @POTUS Trump’s bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal with the terrorist regime in Tehran. https://t.co/mOeyzOO13I
Thank you President Trump for your bold decision and your commitment to prevent Iran from ever getting nuclear weapons. @POTUS https://t.co/TeUNWarjnu
I think that everybody recognizes the malign intentions of Iran, and I think everybody also recognizes Israel’s right of self-defense, which is really our common defense.
It is in the interest of everyone to prevent this Iranian aggression. If they reach the Mediterranean, they wish to establish military naval bases in the Mediterranean for Iranian ships and Iranian submarines. This is a palpable threat against all of us.
Iran is now seeking to implant very dangerous weapons in Syria to be used against Israel for the specific purpose of our destruction.
Iran openly calls daily for our destruction, the elimination of Israel from the face of the earth, and it practices unmitigated aggression against us and against anyone else in the region. It has a terror network that is spread throughout the world.
PM Netanyahu: You said, Mr. President, a minute ago, that it is unimaginable that anyone would challenge the right of the State of Israel to exist. In fact, there is a force that is doing precisely that, and that is the regime in Tehran.

We will continue to guard the State of Israel, a precious legacy that has been placed in our hands. 500 meters from here, on the nearby hill, in Emmaus, the army of Judah Maccabee fought with bravery and resourcefulness. The Maccabees did not stop until they achieved victory
Our steel fist is clenched and ready but before everything it depends on spirit, the undaunted spirit of the men and women who serve in the IDF, in every unit, in every role.
In contrast to our enemies, we wage our struggle while upholding purity of arms and while making a constant effort to avoid harming innocents as much as possible. No military is more moral than the IDF.
Whoever hurts us, we will hurt them. The enemies who threaten us with destruction should know that they will encounter an iron wall. They cannot overcome us and they are putting themselves in grave danger.
To our regret, from time to time we are called upon to pay a price on both the battlefield and the home front. The establishment of the state has not led to a cessation of the desire to attack us. What it has brought is the ability to make war against our enemies.
PM Netanyahu: Unfortunately, in Israel's wars there have also been casualties, the memories of whom are ingrained in us. We extend a hand to the bereaved families, embrace the wounded and vow to bring back the missing. https://t.co/RCs7xiQzYO

In a review to be released soon, the OECD expresses appreciation for the steps being taken to reduce bureaucracy, increase people's savings and promote growth. Everything is integrated.
The plans we are submitting to the Cabinet today will lead to direct savings in costs to the economy of over NIS 1.3 billion per annum. The overall savings for this year, along with the previous year, will reach NIS 3 billion, which will be saved from business-owners and citizens
The government has set for itself a national goal to cut bureaucracy. Our efforts in recent years are indeed bearing fruit. Within two years, from 2015-2017, Israel improved its position on the international competitiveness index from 27th to 16th.
Nations that were unprepared to take timely action to counter murderous aggression against them paid much heavier prices afterwards. We do not want escalation, but we are prepared for any scenario.
We are determined to block Iran's aggression against us even if this means a struggle. Better now than later.
In recent months, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards transferred to Syria advanced weaponry in order to attack us both on the battlefield and the home front, including weaponized UAVs, ground-to-ground missiles and Iranian anti-aircraft batteries that would threaten air force jets.
Israel maintains full freedom of action to defend itself. All of our meetings are important, but this week's meeting is especially important in light of Iran's increasing efforts to establish a military presence in Syria against Israel.
On Wednesday I will meet with Russian President Putin in Moscow and participate in the parade to mark Victory Day over Nazi Germany.  Meetings with the Russian President are always important for the security of Israel and the coordination between the IDF and the Russian military.

This is a terrible deal. It should never have been concluded. And in a few days’ time, @POTUS Trump will decide, will make a decision on what to do with the nuclear deal. I’m sure he’ll do the right thing for the US, the right thing for Israel and for the peace of the world. https://t.co/V2LJTy7jE0
Third, Iran lied again in 2015, when it didn’t come clean to the IAEA, as required by the nuclear deal. 	And finally, the Iran deal, the nuclear deal, is based on lies. It’s based on Iranian lies and Iranian deception. 100,000 files right here prove that they lied. https://t.co/zZqoqS6Q3N
You can draw four main conclusions: First, Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program. 100,000 secret files prove that they lied. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons know-how for future use. https://t.co/5Dt9qPmkXg
Iran said to the Agency, that it had not conducted metallurgical work specifically designed for a nuclear device. But the files again show that this is a lie. Iran conducted extensive metallurgical work specifically designed for a nuclear device. https://t.co/CeeVDtjNdN
Here’s what Project Amad’s explicit goal was: creating nuclear weapons. This is an original Iranian presentation from these files, and here’s the mission statement: Design, produce and test five warheads, each with ten kiloton TNT yield for integration on a missile. https://t.co/QdBKAugcZR
Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program called Project Amad. We can now prove it was a comprehensive program to design, build and test nuclear weapons. We can also prove Iran is secretly storing Project Amad material to use at a time of its choice to develop nuclear weapons https://t.co/McJ9dXaT7P

Iran is trying to gobble up one country after the other. Iran must be stopped. Its quest for nuclear bombs must be stopped. Its aggression must be stopped, and we’re committed to stopping it together.
I appreciate @POTUS and your position on stopping Iran’s aggression in the region. That aggression has grown many-fold since the signing of the Iranian deal. If people thought that Iran’s aggression would be moderated as a result of signing the deal, the opposite has happened
I think the greatest threat to the world and to our two countries—and to all countries—is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons, and specifically the attempt of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. We’ve had a very productive talk today on this subject as well. https://t.co/LnIoIeFw4n

The deal also does not deal with the ballistic missiles that can deliver this weapon to many, many countries. This is why this deal has to be either fully fixed or fully nixed.		I believe that Begin exemplified for us the commitment to defend Israel’s security at all costs.
This is why we opposed so resolutely the Iran deal, because it gives Iran a clear path to a nuclear arsenal. It allows, over a few years, unlimited enrichment of uranium, the core ingredient required to produce nuclear bombs—and nothing else.

It should be clear to President Assad that his reckless efforts to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, his wanton disregard for international law and his provision of a forward base for Iran and its proxies endanger Syria.

Absurdity has no limits: Iran's terrorist regime that sends tentacles of terror across the region accuses Israel of terrorism.	If Rouhani is unaware of the terrorist and sabotage activities conducted daily by the Iranian Quds Force in Syria, Israel can provide him with an update.
This is proof of the true intentions of the terror organizations in Gaza which are trying to camouflage their murderous intentions by organizing provocations on the security fence, the goal of which is to provide cover for terrorists to carry out acts of terrorism against Israel.
PM Benjamin Netanyahu made the following remarks:	"I praise the IDF and the ISA for thwarting the terrorist attack at sea planned by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization. The security forces will operate on every front to protect the State of Israel and its citizens.
PM Netanyahu and @POTUS Trump agreed to continue the close coordination between the two states in order to repel Iran's aggression and its attempts to destabilize the region.

PM Netanyahu: Erdogan is not used to being talked back to. He should start getting used to it. He who occupies Northern Cyprus and the Kurdish region and butchers civilians in Afrin should not lecture us about morality and values.
The most moral army in the world will not be lectured by those who have indiscriminately bombed civilian populations for years. Apparently this is how #AprilFoolsDay is celebrated in Ankara.

This is a very powerful signal from the US which is changing the rules. It is simply exposing lie after lie and is standing up on truth after truth.		I congratulate the American Congress and @POTUS Trump for these decisions. I'm certain I do so on behalf of all Israeli ministers.
PM Netanyahu:	US Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, which is named after an American student who was murdered in Jaffa, It is designed to deny to the PA  hundreds of millions of dollars they invest in encouraging terrorism and lavish on terrorist families and the murderers.
Digital health is a $600 billion market and of it, if we succeed, as we did in cyber and autonomous vehicles and our vehicle industry, we can expect here a significant increase in new products. 	India is new markets; this means both new markets and new products here.
The second thing that we are doing that is of historic significance is investing close to NIS 1 billion in digital health. 	We are developing the industries of tomorrow. In effect these are the industries of today.
The Israeli economy will develop in two ways – either with new products or in new markets. What we are doing here is breaking through to gigantic new markets and it is a very important change.
PM Netanyahu at Cabinet: 	A few days ago @AirIndiain flew directly to Israel, on a straight line from India to Tel Aviv. 	The significance is clear to all. This is significant economically, technologically, diplomatically and for tourism – significance of the highest order.

More resolutions detached  from reality, from the circus of the absurd that is called the Human Rights Council.	It is time for them to change the name to "The Council for resolutions against the only democracy in the Middle East".

The time has come for the international community to realize that the assistance funds to Gaza are being buried underground.
PM commented on the destruction of 2 Gaza terrorist tunnels:	Last night the IDF destroyed 2 terrorist tunnels. Our policy is to take determined action against any attempt to attack us and to systematically eliminate the infrastructure of terrorist tunnels and thus we'll continue.
We will work to demolish the home of the terrorist and will deal with him to the fullest extent of the law.
PM Netanyahu commented on yesterday's terrorist attack near Mevo Dotan:	From the depths of my heart, I send condolences to the families of the IDF officer and soldier who were murdered yesterday by a reprehensible terrorist and my best wishes for a quick recovery to the wounded.
Yesterday the Austrian cabinet decided to establish a memorial site in Vienna with the names of all 66,000 Austrian Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Thank you, @sebastiankurz, for your leadership.
I commend Chancellor @SebastianKurz for his powerful speech, his determination to combat antisemitism and his intention to advance a series of cabinet decisions regarding Holocaust education and commemoration.

I think there’s a new hope on the horizon that I’ve never seen in my lifetime. Because of the growing danger of Iran, more and more, virtually all the Arab countries, no longer see Israel as their enemy, but as their vital ally in countering the threat of militant Islam.
PM: We leave the West Bank militarily, or most of it as people stipulate in their various peace plans, you have either Hamas coming in – that’s Iran, or you have ISIS coming in.	This is a catastrophe for peace.
PM: In every area that we left militarily, militant Islam came in. we left Lebanon, Iran came in with Hezbollah. We left Gaza, Iran came in with Hamas. https://t.co/YSCATshp8y
PM: In this area, the Middle East, full of failed states, states that collapsed, it’s very important that Israel be the power responsible for security because otherwise everyone collapses. The Palestinians collapse.
What that means is that whatever the solution is, the area west of the Jordan, that includes the Palestinian areas, would be militarily under Israel. The security, the overriding security and responsibility would be Israel’s.
PM: I think most Israelis would favor a situation where we could separate from the Palestinians. I don’t want the Palestinians as citizens of Israel or subjects of Israel. I want a solution when they have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us. https://t.co/EF4fyxzTja

In addition to Iran's moving its army, air force, and navy to Syria, it’s also seeking to develop, to build precision guided missile factories in Syria and Lebanon against Israel.

We won't accept trickles or bombs on the fence such as we saw last weekend. Whoever hurts us – will be hurt. Whoever does not act to calm the situation but chooses to fan the flames – will bear full responsibility.		We will continue to defend the south and strengthen Ashkelon.
We do not intend to ignore the attempts to violate our sovereignty or harm our soldiers and residents and we have proven this time and again.	Any act of aggression by terrorist elements will meet a strong and determined response on our part, by the IDF and the security forces.
We have no desire to harm the daily routine of the residents of Gaza but they must know that it is not Israel which is responsible for their plight. It is the extremists leading Gaza that are completely responsible.
PM Netanyahu:	The Hamas regime and the other terrorist organizations turned the Gaza Strip into a powder-keg. We build hospitals while they build terrorist tunnels and missiles.
When we left the Gaza Strip some people still had an iota of hope that the other side would choose to rise to the path of tranquil life; however, it became clear very quickly that the concerns were based in reality. https://t.co/y4YbZvEcvO

We must stop radical regimes from threatening our security. We must prevent them from getting nuclear weapons, and we must defeat the terrorists. 	Tonight I want to join all of you in a salute to the hero of our times who understood and understands security, @SenJohnMcCain. https://t.co/lFtg0cj4UE
Security is not the only aspect of policy, but it is the one that ensures that all others’ good policies are possible, for without security, we will deteriorate rapidly into a world of chaos, tyranny and violence. Security comes first. This is the main message that I have today.
Prime Minister Netanyahu:	I have drawn tremendous inspiration from the courage of @SenJohnMcCain. Courage, the Romans said, is not the only virtue, but it’s the one that guarantees all the others https://t.co/dnGxvj4qLH

Israel sends its deepest condolences to the families of all 71 souls who lost their lives in today's terrible plane crash in Moscow.	We mourn alongside the entire Russian nation following this devastating tragedy.
I would also like to say that I am proud of you, the citizens of Israel. 	Yesterday we again proved that in moments of crisis we know how to come together, to rebuff our enemies and guard our country.
Yesterday we dealt severe blows to the Iranian and Syrian forces. 	We made it unequivocally clear to everyone that our rules of action have not changed one bit; we will continue to strike at every attempt to strike at us. 		This has been our policy and it will remain our policy.
We salute our pilots, soldiers and commanders, especially the Chief-of-Staff. 	They are guarding the State of Israel and we are proud of them.
A few minutes ago I spoke with the navigator and was pleased to hear that he is standing up, with all that entails. I was also pleased to hear that there has been an improvement in the condition of the pilot. 	We wish both of them a quick and full recovery.

Israel holds Iran and its Syrian hosts responsible for today’s aggression. We will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect our sovereignty and our security.
This morning Iran brazenly violated Israel’s sovereignty. They dispatched an Iranian drone from Syrian territory into Israel. 	And this demonstrates that our warnings were 100% correct.
I have been warning for some time about the dangers of Iran’s military entrenchment in Syria. Iran seeks to use Syrian territory to attack Israel for its professed goal of destroying Israel. https://t.co/bfWinriX3h
So it will be with the abhorrent murderer of Rabbi Itamar Ben-Gal.		We are all with his family and his widow.
I similarly promised the widow of Rabbi Raziel Shevach that we would settle accounts with his murderer.		I want to praise the ISA, Israel Police Counter-terrorism unit, and the IDF for doing exactly this.
I am now concluding the tour of IDF Northern Command that we held with the members of the Security Cabinet. I am impressed by the major work the IDF is doing to defend our borders and our state.		We want peace but are prepared for any scenario and I suggest that no one test us. https://t.co/2LLTX4oPjf

The security forces will catch whoever tries to attack Israeli citizens and we'll deal with them to the fullest extent of the law. So it will be with the murderers of Rabbi Itamar Ben-Gal.
PM Netanyahu: I praise the security forces for the determined and complex operation they carried out last night to apprehend the terrorist, who was ultimately eliminated. I told Rabbi Raziel Shevach's widow that we we'd catch the murderers and last night the mission was completed
PM Netanyahu: "In my people's darkest hour, a few noble men and women bucked their superiors to save Jewish lives. Israel saluted them. We shall forever honor their memory." https://t.co/FTq9iuQsnk
We hold our hand out to peace for any of our neighbors who wish peace with us, and there are quite a few, and their number is growing, I'm happy to say, and I hope it will extend to all. https://t.co/nlb2ZQIhL5
We Jews have learned to believe our enemies when they call for our annihilation. We’ve learned that we must be able to defend ourselves by ourselves against any potential threat. The State of Israel not only has internalized these lessons, it practices it. https://t.co/x0azpZMKmF

As I also made it clear to President Trump and afterwards to European leaders and President Putin, our presence here is the main element in the Middle East blocking the spread of radical Islam, led by Iran and Islamic State which also threaten all other elements in the world.
Today we will be briefed by the Chief-of-Staff. I have full confidence in the Chief-of-Staff and the IDF. The IDF is the strongest military in the Middle East and this is a good thing because we face many challenges.
Today, the government will provide for the status of Havat Gilad in order to facilitate orderly life there. For the murderers – exacting justice. To those who sanctify death, we will sanctify life. This is the essence of the government's policy.
Our second policy guideline is to strengthen settlement. Whoever thinks that through the reprehensible murder of a resident of Havat Gilad, a father of six, that he can break our spirit and weaken us, is making a bitter mistake.
We will not rest until we bring them to justice. 	And we will bring them all to justice.
I told her that our policy is being carried out in two spheres. First, exacting justice. Yesterday our forces were again in action in an effort to apprehend the last of the assassins and their accomplices in the murder of Rabbi Shevach.
A few minutes ago, I spoke with Yael, the widow of Rabbi Raziel Shevach. I told her that the entire nation and all members of Cabinet embrace her and the children in their time of grief; I also asked her to hug the children for us.

The initiative gives backing to those who seek to boycott Israel and completely contravenes the guiding principles of free trade and justice.		Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed that the Irish Ambassador to Israel be summoned to the Foreign Ministry on this matter.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemns the Irish legislative initiative, the entire goal of which is to support the BDS movement and harm the State of Israel.
And second is Iran's attempt to manufacture – in Lebanon – precision weapons against the State of Israel.		I made it clear to him that we will not agree to either one of these developments and will act according to need.
I just finished in-depth and good talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.		I told him that Israel views two developments with utmost gravity: 	First is Iran's efforts to establish a military presence in Syria https://t.co/YdfcmL8DT8
Our talks, which we hold periodically, in my view, greatly contribute to achieving these goals and I am certain that they will do so now as well. https://t.co/0jiLGChdmY

I will discuss with President Putin Iran's relentless efforts to establish a military presence in Syria, which we strongly oppose and are also taking action against.
PM Netanyahu: I am now leaving for Moscow to meet with Russian President Putin.	We meet periodically in order to ensure the military coordination between the IDF and the Russian forces in Syria; as of today this has succeeded and it is important that it continue to succeed.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke this evening by telephone with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The two agreed that teams from the two countries would open an immediate dialogue in order to try to reach understandings regarding the legislation.

3. The constant need to continue building the strength of the State of Israel against the fanatical regimes of our time.		Today we have a strong state of our own, with the ability to defend ourselves, by ourselves. In my view, this is the most important lesson of the Holocaust.
Every day, and especially on Intl Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember 3 things:	1. Our six million brothers and sisters who were exterminated in the Nazi horrors. 	2. The price all humanity paid for not taking strong and timely action against a murderous ideology.
We will not accept any attempt whatsoever to rewrite history and no restriction on research into historical truth. On my instruction, our ambassador in Warsaw spoke with the Polish PM during a Holocaust memorial ceremony at Auschwitz last night and emphasized our positions.
Here is the place to point out that we have no tolerance for distorting the truth, historical revisionism or Holocaust denial. I expressed my strong opposition, to the law passed in the Polish parliament last Friday regarding the Holocaust that befell our people on Polish soil.
Tomorrow I will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. I will discuss with him various regional developments, enhanced security coordination between the IDF and the Russian military forces in Syria and a series of issues that are important for Israel's security.
The national and corporate leaders told me that we have turned Israel into a global technology power. We hear this everywhere, in India and in Davos – everywhere. It is indeed our policy. We are turning Israel into a rising global power.
I also met with a friend, the chairman of Alphabet, Inc., which you know as Google, @ericschmidt.

We discussed the need to block Iran's aggression in the region and its attempts to achieve nuclear weapons via the failed nuclear deal that must be fixed or nixed. I also spoke at length about these matters with our friends, French President Macron and German Chancellor Merkel.
I again expressed to @POTUS Trump our appreciation for his historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem as soon as possible.
Over the weekend I returned from the World economic Forum in @Davos. I met there with a dozen heads of state and government from Asia, Africa, Eastern and Western Europe, and from South and North America, with our friend, @POTUS Donald Trump first and foremost, of course.

You stood up for Israel at the UN in a remarkable way, rock-solid support. This is a place, it's a house of slander against Israel and against the United States, and by word and deed, you have told them, enough is enough.
We also appreciate the fact that you confront Iran's aggression with us and with other parties in the region as never before. I've never seen the realistic alliance between the USA, Israel and your other allies in the region as strong, as unified, as it is under your leadership.
We also support you completely and your stalwart position on the Iran nuclear deal. You've said it's a disastrous deal; that if its fatal flaws are not fixed, that you should walk away from it. 	I want you to know that if you decide to do that, then we will back you all the way.
PM Netanyahu to @POTUS Trump:	By recognizing history, you've made history. And we will always remember that. https://t.co/wKd8EyA6cm
This historic decision will be forever etched in the hearts of our people for generations to come. 		People say that this pushes peace backward. I say it pushes peace forward, because it recognizes history, and the present reality. Peace can only be built on the basis of truth.

In any case, with or without an agreement, our policy is to prevent the terrorist regime in Iran from arming itself with nuclear weapons, which would endanger us, the Middle East and the entire world.
Among the leaders I will meet there  are French President Emanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. I will tell them that in the coming weeks they will have a last opportunity to try and introduce real, not cosmetic, changes in the dangerous nuclear agreement with Iran.
This will help us expand our diplomatic horizon, and our security and economic links, for the benefit of the economy, citizens and security of Israel.

The tourism market brings money into Israel. It is like exports. It is an important part of our economy. It also provides employment. I see this as important from a social perspective, as well as from an economic one. It is also important vis-à-vis our public diplomacy abroad.
PM: A few months ago we welcomed the three millionth tourist, a woman from Romania. Today there are 3.6 million tourists. I hope that in the coming year we will pass the 4 million mark and this will be, of course, an important improvement.
We have coasts on which we built infrastructures such as desalination plants, power stations and other infrastructures. This proposal is designed to build, off Israel's coasts, artificial islands that will absorb all these infrastructures, clear the coasts and provide more areas.
PM: Today, I will submit for Cabinet approval the formation of a team that will move forward on the construction of artificial islands. Israel is one of the most crowded countries in the world; it is predicted that by mid-century it might well be the most crowded in the world.
I have brought this position to the attention of the US. This is how to rid the world of UNRWA and deal with genuine refugee problems, to the extent that such remain.
I have made a simple proposal: UNRWA support funds need to be gradually shifted to the UNHCR, with clear criteria for supporting genuine refugees, not fictitious refugees as happens today under UNRWA.
Of course this creates a situation in which there are great-grandchildren of refugees, who are not refugees but who are cared for by UNRWA, and another 70 years will pass and those great-grandchildren will have great-grandchildren and therefore, this absurdity needs to stop.
UNRWA is an agency that was established 70 years ago, only for Palestinian refugees, at a time when the UNHCR deals with global refugee problems.
PM: I agree completely with @POTUS Trump's sharp criticism of UNRWA.		UNRWA is an org. that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem and the narrative of the right-of-return, as it were, in order to eliminate the State of Israel; therefore, it needs to pass from the world.

I would like to bring it to your attention that Iran is using terrorism against Israel not only with the assistance of terrorist movements such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad but is also attempting to organize terrorist actions inside Israel and against its citizens.
They are trying various methods, and in various fields, to attack the State of Israel. I am pleased that the ISA and our security services have succeeded in foiling it.
The Israel Security Agency (ISA), with the assistance of the IDF, exposed and foiled a terrorist network in Judea and Samaria that operated under the aegis of Iranian intelligence. This is not the first time.	https://t.co/0f7r8IYPHt

The IDF is what assures that our future will be different from our post. I welcome the fact that the vast majority of the public understands this and flatly rejects the phenomenon of refusal to serve.
I view with utmost gravity refusal to serve in the IDF from any side, even though this has to do with a tiny marginal group. The tragedies that struck our people ended after we established the State of Israel and the IDF and rebuilt our ability to defend ourselves by ourselves.
A policy that has – in recent years – made Israel quieter and more secure than it has been in decades. Attempts to attack us have not ceased, but our policy is clear – whoever tries to hurt us, we will hurt them.
The Defense Minister and I, along with the Chief-of-Staff, the head of the ISA and the heads of the security services are leading a vigorous and responsible policy that is backed by this government.
Israel views Hamas as responsible for any firing at us from the Gaza Strip. Since we destroyed the terrorist tunnel that penetrated into our territory several weeks ago, the IDF has attacked approx. 40 Hamas targets including an additional attack by the air force last night.

We are now meeting a new threat, a new challenge that many of you are familiar with – that of UAVs. Here as well we are in the vanguard and the air force is adapting itself to, and developing, the most advanced technology in the world.
We did this with active defense systems, including Iron Dome and other systems. We are currently doing so with tunnels and we are justly proud of our technology. https://t.co/FuHSKfyBYP
We are taking care to develop our strength on land, at sea and in the air, and in intelligence and cyber. We frequently outpace the world in identifying and meeting new challenges.
We will neither allow nor tolerate any escalation on the part of Hamas or any other terrorist element against the State of Israel. We will use all means to defend our sovereignty and the security of Israeli citizens.
Regarding the Gaza Strip, we want the local population to live its life quietly and calmly but the decision as to whether or not there is quiet in Gaza depends, first of all, on Gaza.
We are an island in a very stormy sea. We are guarding our security based on a clear policy: We will not allow Iranian military forces to establish bases in Syria in order to attack us and we will act to prevent the manufacture of precise and deadly weapons aimed at us. https://t.co/RadOGYji60
We continue to face major challenges in the north, south and east. On all of these fronts we find the arms of radical Islam, which has already caused terrible disasters in our region but not in our state.

I told you recently that there will be other countries that would recognize Jerusalem and announce the transfer of their embassies to it. Well here is the second country and I reiterate: It is only the beginning and it is important.
From here I would like to say to the President of Guatemala @jimmymoralesgt:		"God bless you, my friend, President Morales.	God bless both our countries – Israel and Guatemala.	We are waiting for you here in Jerusalem."
One of the most relevant subjects was the return of the Embassy of Guatemala to Jerusalem. I have instructed the Foreign Minister to begin coordinating the implementation of the move. God bless you."

The US has said something else that is very important: The root of the general conflict in the Middle East does not lie in Israel, but in Iran and radical Islam and the terrorism it inspires. 	All these are the true reasons that whoever sees clearly and has integrity cannot deny.
PM Netanyahu: Abu Mazen declared that he is quitting the process and, in effect, is not interested in any proposal that the US might submit. I think that once again it is becoming clear: It is the Palestinians who do not want to resolve this conflict.
Denmark has decided on this step; it is neither the first nor the last. 	We will continue with this line.
We have been informed of the Danish government's decision to tighten its criteria for supporting Palestinian NGOs.		At the meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels, I demanded that they all stop supporting organizations that support terrorism and promote boycotts of Israel.
PM Netanyahu: Over the weekend I instructed the Foreign Ministry to withdraw from UNESCO. I think that this is appropriate, given this organization's biased, one-sided and absurd attitude toward us, and against the background of the US's strong stand at the UN, which we welcome.

President Trump, thank you for today's historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  		The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.
I also want to make clear: there will be no change whatsoever to the status quo at the holy sites.		Israel will always ensure freedom of worship for Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.
I share @POTUS Trump's commitment to advancing peace between Israel and all of our neighbors, including the Palestinians. 		This has been our goal from Israel's first day. 		And we will continue to work with the President and his team to make that dream of peace come true.
I call on all countries that seek peace to join the United States in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move their embassies here.
This decision reflects @POTUS commitment to an ancient but enduring truth, to fulfilling his promises and to advancing peace.		The President's decision is an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.
We're profoundly grateful for the President for his courageous and just decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to prepare for the opening of the US embassy here.
So it's rare to be able to speak of new and genuine milestones in the glorious history of this city. 		Yet today's pronouncement by @POTUS Trump is such an occasion.
Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia.		From every corner of the earth, our people yearned to return to Jerusalem, to touch its golden stones, to walk its hallowed streets.
This is a historic day. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years.		It's been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years. 		It was here that our temples stood, our kings ruled, our prophets preached.

If Iran continues unabated, they will have a nuclear arsenal of 100 bombs and more.  Within a decade they'll have a capacity to enrich uranium on a vast scale and break not to one bomb but to 100 bombs. This has to be stopped.
These are two important challenges that we have as we expand our network of alliances. But, its progress is undeniable, except for Iran. Iran stands out by not merely threatening us; Iran is threatening the entire world.
We still have challenges, how to convert this revolutionary change enveloping the world and our region, how do we translate it into a formal peace between us and all our neighbors, Palestinians and others, and how we translate this into the votes we want in international forums.

With regard to @POTUS Trump's political plan, we heard plenty of speculations over the weekend; I am not planning to address them. My attitude towards this plan will be determined according to security &amp; national interests of Israel, which were made clear to our American friends.
Today, Egypt and Israel and other countries, are on one side of the barricade in a stubborn struggle against the terror of radical Islam. This contributes significantly to the security of Israel. I hope in the future it will also contribute to the expansion of the circle of peace

PM Netanyahu: The goal that I have in mind is not keeping or eliminating the deal; it’s improving the deal and correcting its main flaws.
The threat we all see is a resurgent Iran that is bent not only on dominating the region, but bent on developing nuclear weapons.
PM Netanyahu: Many Arab countries now see Israel not as an enemy, but as their indispensable ally in the battle against militant Islam.
And when they do, the road to peace will be infinitely closer. In my opinion, peace will be achievable.
A hundred years after Balfour, the Palestinians should finally accept the Jewish national home and finally accept the Jewish state.
We cooperate in cybersecurity, in technology, in business and enterprise. We share the values of freedom and democracy and peace.
We cooperate closely on intelligence, in the battle against terrorism. And we’ve saved countless lives – British lives, Israeli lives.
A hundred years later, our two countries, our two democracies – Israel and Britain – are strong allies and partners. https://t.co/KzgnA8BSRH

Israel will monitor developments on the ground and act accordingly
Israel insists that the PA not allow any base whatsoever for Hamas terrorist actions from PA areas in Judea and Samaria or from Gaza.
As long as Hamas doesn't disarm and calls for our destruction, Israel holds it responsible for all terror actions originating from Gaza.
Israel demands the immediate release of the Israeli civilians who are being cruelly held by Hamas, and the remains of fallen IDF soldiers.
Digging tunnels, manufacturing missiles and terrorism against Israel are incompatible w/ Quartet and US efforts to renew the diplo. process
Any reconciliation must include honoring international agreements and the Quartet condition, first - recognizing Israel and disarming Hamas.

The citizen is the customer. He must be secure. Today we will advance a plan to facilitate progress on accessibility and safety of citizens.
The principal means of identification are the smart ID card and other biometric and technological means.
It is necessary to provide accessible, rapid service for citizens and protect against identity theft, which has become widespread worldwide.
The Cabinet will approve a secure identification policy. The intention is to provide better service for citizens via the phone and computer.
Today we will convene a committee on the issue of Netiv HaAvot. We are trying to find a humane and logical solution for a humane problem.
Last week Cape Verde announced that it will not vote against us in UN institutions. This is important and it attests to success.
These pressures are the best testimony to the success of our policy, of Israel's presence in Africa.
This is not taking place without contrary pressure. Various pressures have been placed on the Togolese President to cancel the conference.
This is with a clear goal – to bring Israel back to Africa in a big way.
This will be my 3rd visit to Africa in a little over a year: East Africa, then West Africa and now an economic-technological conference.
Tomorrow I will host the President of Togo. I will talk with him about the Africa-Israel conference that Togo is due to host in two months.

We will prevent the strengthening of Hezbollah via Syria and prevent the establishment of an Iranian military presence in Syria.
We will continue to monitor developments beyond our borders while strongly upholding our red lines.
I discussed this with US Secretary of State Tillerson and with Russian President Putin. Both told me that they understand Israel's position.
Israel will welcome a genuine ceasefire in Syria but it mustn't enable establishment of a military presence by Iran and its proxies in Syria
The entire world will see the truth and the first visitors whom I will invite there will be UNESCO and UN delegations.
I instructed that procedures be completed for construction of a center displaying historical &amp; archaeological findings for the City of David
Just as we did with UNESCO's other delusional decision regarding the absence of a connection to Jerusalem.
Against UNESCO's denial, Israel will present the historical truth and the Jewish People's deep connection of thousands of years to Hebron.
I decided to cut $1M from Israel's UN dues and transfer it to establish The Museum of Heritage of Jewish People in Kiryat Arba and Hebron.
This did not prevent UNESCO from passing yet another delusional resolution that the Tomb of the Patriarchs is a Palestinian heritage site.
PM: The connection between the Jewish People and Hebron and the Tomb of the Patriarchs is one which may be without parallel in history.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting this morning.	https://t.co/5OEkAbZe1i
and the Jewish People's deep connection – of thousands of years – to Hebron.
Against UNESCO's denial of the past, Prime Minister Netanyahu is determined to present to the entire world the historic truth
The funds will be used to establish the Museum of the Heritage of the Jewish People in Kiryat Arba &amp; Hebron and related heritage projects.
Following the UNESCO resolution on the Tomb of the Patriarchs, PM Netanyahu decided to cut $1 million from Israel's UN membership funds
We will continue to protect the Tomb of the Patriarchs, freedom of religion for all and the truth.
In the Middle East, mosques, churches and synagogues in every other place, are being bombed – in places that are not Israel.
And the site is in danger? It is only in those places where Israel is, such as Hebron, that freedom of religion for all is ensured.
Not a Jewish site?! Who is buried there? Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca and Leah – our patriarchs and matriarchs!
This is another delusional UNESCO decision. They decided the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron is a Palestinian site - that it is not Jewish.

This is the fruit of my &amp; his initiated policy. Our governments and peoples are sharing this effort to build a strong friendship between us.
This is an historic first visit by an Indian PM to Israel in 70 years; it attests to the fact that our relations with India became closer
Tomorrow, my friend Indian Prime Minister @NarendraModi will arrive in Israel; India is the largest democracy in the world.
I am certain that I will see many of you at the 4th of July festivities this evening at the US Ambassador's residence in Herzliya.

No damage was caused and continuity of function was not impaired.	The incident was unrelated to the global attack.
National Cyber Defense Auth.: Of the 8 hospitals suspected to have been hacked, only 2 were actually attacked; the other 6 were false alarms
The hospitals' continuity of function has not been impaired.
The event was stopped by the organizations' information security personnel with the National Cyber Defense Auth. and is closely monitored.
Overnight there were attempts to hack several hospitals. Various computers affected were dealt with immediately; no damage was caused.
I said that we will not tolerate spillover and we will respond to every firing. Whoever attacks us – we will attack him. This is our policy.

All of this is an additional expression of Israel's enhanced international position in recent years as we strengthen the State of Israel.
We will establish a joint innovation, and R&amp;D fund. We will also increase tourism from India to Israel; this has very great potential.
Today, Cabinet will approve decisions that will deepen these ties, beginning with expanding exports and cooperation in agriculture and water
This is a very significant step in strengthening relations between the two countries. Ties between Israel &amp; India are on a constant upswing.
In the 70 years of the country's existence no Indian Prime Minister has ever visited and this is further expression of Israel's strength.
PM Netanyahu: Next week, the Indian Prime Minister, my friend, @NarendraModi will arrive in Israel, This is an historic visit to Israel.
We view with utmost gravity Iran's attempts to establish itself militarily in Syria and its attempts to arm Hezbollah with advanced weaponry

Our policy is clear: We will not tolerate any spillover or trickle whatsoever – neither mortars nor rockets, from any front.

And to demand the immediate cessation of Palestinian Authority payments to the families of terrorists, something that only encourages terror
I call on the countries of the world to condemn both the murder and those who praise it
Of course, the Palestinian Authority is refusing to condemn the murder and will now pay financial compensation to the murderers' families.
And praised the murderers as heroes. It seems that mendacity and brazen gall know no bounds.
Instead of condemning the attack, Fatah, headed by Abu Mazen, issued a statement condemning the Border Police who killed the terrorists
I have instructed the police to reinforce security arrangements and checking procedures in the plaza around Damascus Gate.
We have revoked Palestinians' visits in Israel that we approved for Ramadan
Since Friday, the security forces have been operating in the district of the terrorists' village and are preparing to demolish their homes.
They will remain linked forever in their heroism and their sacrifice on behalf of the nation and the state.
Like their comrade-in-arms, the late Hadar Cohen, she fell in the line of duty in a determined struggle against bloodthirsty terrorists.
Hadas was a young person full of life. She was imbued with a sense of mission of defending the State of Israel.
PM: On behalf of the Government and the nation I would like to send condolences to the family of Border Police fighter, the late Hadas Malka

PM Netanyahu: Therefore, the time has come to disband UNRWA and integrate it into the UNHCR.
I regret that UNRWA, to a large degree, by its very existence, perpetuates – and does not solve – the Palestinian refugee problem.
@nikkihaley Most Palestinian refugees are settled and have a separate commission - UNRWA; it has institutions and considerable incitement against Israel
@nikkihaley Since WW2, there have been, and continue to be today – millions of refugees. These millions have the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
I told Ambassador @NikkiHaley that the time has come for the UN to reconsider the continued existence on UNRWA..
I met US Ambassador to the UN @NikkiHaley. I thanked her for her sharp words in favor of Israel and against the UN's anti-Israel obsession.
I instructed the @IsraelMFA Director General to file an official protest against Hamas at the UN Security Council.
On the one hand, Hamas first attacks innocent civilians, and then it hides behind children.
This is the enemy that we have been fighting against for many years, an enemy that is committing a double war crime.

We are also prepared to summon the world against an existential danger to us, which is not an existential danger only to us.
Against the danger of radical Islam, we are honing our defensive and offensive capabilities and thereby ensuring our existence.

Our soldiers are the basis of our existence. They guard us and we will guard them.
Those same diplomats would never dream of doing this in the US or UK, or in any other place.
My policy is not to meet diplomats who visit Israel and meet orgs that slander IDF soldiers and seek to put them on trial as war criminals
PM Netanyahu: Our relations with Germany are strong and important and will also continue as such.
PM: I am leading Israel's foreign relations to unprecedented growth. But based on a proud, assertive national policy, not out of weakness.
Our relations with Germany are very important and they will not be affected by this.
But PM Netanyahu will not meet with those who lend legitimacy to organizations that call for the criminalization of Israeli soldiers.
Diplomats are welcome to meet with representatives of civil society
PM Netanyahu's policy isn't to meet visitors who on diplomatic trips to Israel meet with groups that slander IDF soldiers as war criminals
Leaders of those countries would surely not accept this.
Imagine if foreign diplomats visiting the United States or Britain met with NGOs that call American or British soldiers war criminals.

We call the international community to complete the work, and this is an opportunity for American-Russian cooperation in this specific area.
There is an international commitment from 2013 to remove all chemical weapons from Syria. This commitment has yet to be fully implemented.

It's very important that @POTUS Trump took a strong stand against anti-Semitism. And important that we all continue so in the years ahead.
It is something that we need to fight together. I think this is important in Europe. It's important in America.
PM: We have a battle against those who seek to demonize our people and the resurgent anti-Semitism that we see in many parts of the world.
I hope and I believe that will change as Arab countries understand Israel is not their enemy, but a vital ally in warding off the barbarism.
PM Netanyahu: Israel is a beacon of freedom, of tolerance, of progress in a very dark expanse.
Israel and Australia are two vibrant democracies. This is not self-evident. Democracy has to be nourished, protected and maintained.
PM: I want to salute this Jewish community, which is unusually committed to Israel, to the Jewish people. You've shown it again and again.

That gives me hope that in cooperating with them for our common security we might also be able to advance peace with and the Palestinians.
I see a change in the Middle East, in many Arab countries, that recognise that they too are being threatened by these malignant forces.
PM Netanyahu: believe that we have not only the force of technology, but of conviction to defeat these forces.
We discussed how we can intensify our cooperation against radical terrorism that reaches into every corner of the world, including Australia
Our task is to try to put our entrepreneurs together to cooperate for the benefit of our people and your people, and that of other countries
PM Netanyahu: The future belongs to those who innovate. Israel is an innovation nation, Australia is an innovation nation.
We remember that Australia was the first country to vote for the Partition Resolution that called for the establishment of a Jewish state.

PM Netanyahu: At the end of the meeting with @POTUS Trump, he shook my hand and defined relations between Israel and the US as 'a new day'.
I met with US @VP Mike Pence, who is also a great friend of the State of Israel and with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
We also agreed to create a team in an area that we have not previously agreed on: on settlement in Judea and Samaria. We will discuss this.
We agreed to create joint teams to upgrade relations between Israel and the US in: Security, intelligence, cyber, technology, and economics.
We see eye to eye on the main – and growing – threat from Iran and the need to stand against Iranian aggression in the various spheres.
There is a personal connection between @POTUS Trump and myself, and a common view about the dangers and opportunities in the Middle East
The alliance between Israel and the US has always been steadfast but this alliance has become even stronger.

Under your leadership I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam. In this great task Israel stands with you. I stand with you
I welcome your call to ensure Israel is treated fairly in intl forums and that slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted by the USA.

The time has come for reciprocity in the UN's relations with Israel and free gifts cannot be constantly given to the Palestinian side.
Several days ago I was informed of the possibility of the appointment of Salaam Fayyad to a UN position.
We will respond strongly and aggressively to any attack. We are not prepared to accept a passive drizzle. Whoever attacks us will pay dearly
In the face of recent events such as the firing at Eilat and in other areas, we have a very clear policy.
This requires a responsible policy. I have navigated Israeli-US relations in a prudent manner and I will continue to do so now.
And to strengthen our other national interests which are fundamentally connected to the strength of ties with the US.
My supreme consideration is to be concerned for the security of the State of Israel, to strengthen the steadfast alliance with the US
This is also a very important meeting for Israel's security, our strengthening international position and our overall national interests.
We have known each other for years, but this will be his first meeting since being elected @POTUS and mine as Prime Minister of Israel.

Congrats to the New England @Patriots, Tom Brady and my friend Bob Kraft. 	From the comeback nation to the comeback team: Amazing game!
I look forward to the day when we have Palestinians who are willing to recognize the Jewish state. That will be the beginning of peace.
PM: We lack peace with the Palestinians because of Palestinian refusal for the last 70 years to recognize a Jewish state in any boundaries.
I think in this sense, Israel is doing an important service for the peoples of Europe, including Belgium.
If that were to happen we would have untold misery to many,more millions of residents of the Middle East and a great increase flow to Europe
it's important to recognize - Israel is the strongest force in the Middle East that prevents the collapse of the Western part of the MidEast
PM Netanyahu: Israel has been at the forefront of the countries that fight militant Islam. We share our intelligence on terrorism.
The great challenge of terror emanates from radical Islam that brings misery to our region and proceeds elsewhere with unrestricted violence
Small countries can have powerful economies. If we cooperate we can increase the prosperity of our peoples for our common benefit.
We have strong industries, strong knowledge industries, and I think that the future belongs to those who innovate.
PM Netanyahu: Our bilateral relations are healthy. In terms of trade we have about 3 billion dollars of trade between us. We can have more.

I think there are challenges there but there are some new and interesting opportunities because of these regional and global changes.
We share with you the desire for peace and this is our dream. We will never give up on our quest for peace with all of our neighbors.
I think other nations should follow soon. And I’d like to talk to you on how we can ensure that Iran's aggression does not go unanswered.
Iran offers provocation after provocation. That's why I welcome President Trump's insistence on new sanctions against Iran.
Iran seeks to conquer the Middle East. It threatens Europe; it threatens the West; it threatens the world.
We face challenges, very clear, from militant Islam and especially from Iran. Iran seeks to annihilate Israel. It says so openly.
I hope to have the opportunity to discuss how we can strengthen that cooperation to make our people still safer and still more prosperous.
Our cooperation in trade and tech makes our people more prosperous. Our cooperation in security and cyber security makes our people safer. https://t.co/iRT5P1oVFl

The most important thing is that countries like the US, Israel and the UK line up together against Iran's aggression and set clear limits.
The challenges stem from the fact that the Iranians are trying to test the boundaries with extraordinary aggression, gall and defiance.
I intend to speak with both leaders about tightening relations, between each side and Israel and trilaterally.
PM: We are in a period of diplomatic opportunities and challenges. The opportunities stem from a new US administration and a new UK govt.
