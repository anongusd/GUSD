@hurlgr Except u'd vehemently disagree if the roles were reversed. Oligarchy if it favors ur candidate, democracy if it doesn't. Hmmm.
@hurlgr But aren't you the guy who decries the "party elites"?? Now ur opposed to democracy and prefer oligarchy? üòä
@jaynordlinger @BenSasse 		Bravo! Please don't back down, Ben! Our country deserves far better than the apparent choices.
@united @rocketrod208 Nothing to do except PLEASE get more reliable. I'm a commuter and United messes up my commute WAY too often!
@united @rocketrod208 True, but nothing to do w/ this delay. Our a/c switched from on-time arr to 1 7 hrs late. Can't blame on DEN weather.
@united 5382 originally was assigned inbound a/c due to arrive early. Now we're given an inbound 7 hrs late and r thus badly delayed. Foul!
@hurlgr #NeverTrump #NeverCruz
@hurlgr @FDRLST Running either of the leading candidates will result in a devastating Nov defeat and a disaster for the Party. #suicide
@hurlgr Don't believe the disavowal! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!
@hurlgr TC is a social conservative:  that's bad for people and for the Party.
@hurlgr Intolerance and bias.
@hurlgr Not in this lifetime. Tolerance and compassion are non-negotiable.
@hurlgr I prefer dreams to the twin nightmares of two perennially unlikeable men:  one a Madman, the other not. Both very bad for the Party.
