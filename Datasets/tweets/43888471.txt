Mary Grealy, @HealthInFocus:  Insufficient use of clinical guidelines is leading, in some regions, to disproportionate number of hospitalizations and longer lengths of stay.
Mary Grealy, @HealthinFocus:  Creating safe harbors for medical professionals using evidence-based guidelines generates cost savings and will achieve better health outcomes.
Mary Grealy, @HealthInFocus: Research has found that outcomes improve and healthcare organizations have been stronger when clinical guidelines are used.
Mary Grealy, @HealthInFocus:  Quoting former Mayo Clinic CEO, we need to replace a culture of blame in healthcare with a culture of safety.
David Kendall, @ThirdWayTweet:  Changing the legal system can encourage more doctors to use clinical guidelines and, thus, improve quality of care to patients.  If doctors follow guidelines, courts should respect that.
David Kendall, @ThirdWayTweet: Clinical practice guidelines lead to better outcomes, lower costs.  Some physicians, though, don't follow them.  They need incentives to use them.
From David Kendall, @ThirdWayTweet, legal system doesn’t do a good job distinguishing between bad care and bad luck. https://t.co/IEZ1BWhoyk
David Kendall, @ThirdWayTweet, will be addressing Capitol Hill briefing on evidence-based medicine and medical liability reform.
From @RepBera, Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act (which he introduced) will use "safe harbors" approach to medical liability to reduce unnecessary testing and curb defensive medicine costs.
From @RepBera, providing "safe harbors" to physicians using evidence-based clinical guidelines is not a Democratic or Republican idea.  It's good for patients.
From @RepBera, if medical professionals are incentivized to use evidence-based clinical standards, it will reduce regional variations in care.
From @RepBera, if physicians are adhering to best clinical practice guidelines, there should be a higher threshold before one can be sued.

HIPAA 101 Q&amp;A with Jennings Aske @nyphospital and Faith Knight Myers @McKesson at Hill briefing https://t.co/wHAmI0mJAM
Aske, @nyphospital: administrative and physical safeguards are required to protect health data, guidelines exist to help #HIPAA
Aske, @nyphospital: the Security Rule is a critical obligation, but risk analysis can be a daunting task #HIPAA
Aske, @nyphospital: security deals with integrity and availability. Patient access to their data vs risk of hacking #HIPAA
Aske, @nyphospital: HIPAA security rule protects electronic PHI while allowing adoption of technology that improves quality/efficiency
Aske, @nyphospital: healthcare disproportionately affected by data security incidents, more value than credit cards on black market #HIPAA
Jennings Aske, @nyphospital: medical workforce has become more mobile, and potential for security risk increases #HIPAA
Myers, @McKesson: federal penalties for #HIPAA non-compliance can go up to $1.5 million per year
Myers, @McKesson: minimum necessary rule means use of PHI must be limited to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish purpose #HIPAA
Myers, @McKesson: De-identified info is not subject to #HIPAA, can be used for research
Myers, @McKesson: health info + individually identifiable info = protected health info (PHI) #HIPAA
Myers, @McKesson: states are free to create privacy requirements more stringent than #HIPAA
Faith Knight Myers, @McKesson says that #HIPAA balances b/w protecting privacy and allowing health data flow
