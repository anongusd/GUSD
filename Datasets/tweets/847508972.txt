@tryingtosellout @KCRon121 @Carmen50 @FeministBread @emrazz I’ll let the women speak for themselves but from my perspective when a woman reports an assault or rape all too often she is the one put on trial, not the accused.

@tryingtosellout @KCRon121 @Carmen50 @FeministBread @emrazz Dude the point is when a women says she has been raped or assaulted she shouldn’t be asked questions that insinuate that she somehow invited what happened.  She should be treated with respect, dignity, and compassion. Which is the way you should treat anyone who reports a crime.
