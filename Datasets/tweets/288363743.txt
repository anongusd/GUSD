@momathena Makes sense.  And i have never advocated for quieting.  Quite the contrary.  I still believe staying in anger is quite destructive.
@momathena I am a parent.  A parent of four who also lost a daughter.  So i know about anger.  My point is that anger can cause us to rise up which is good, but staying in anger is destructive to ourselves and the world.

@ehannan73 I agree with all that.  I think we have to have a more nuanced conversation about what the accountability and penalty should be in all this.  And when it occurs matters and if the person has evolved.
The picture Gov. Northam appears in is despicable and should be condemned by all.  Let‚Äôs also keep in mind that people are doing racist and sexist things still today.  Let‚Äôs condemn it all regardless of party.

@wkpixley1 @ron_fournier I said up front Schulz or anyone else has the right to run.  God bless em.  And for someone who wants to reform the system to not have voted in most elections and not have voted in any local election isn‚Äôt a good thing.

@wkpixley1 @ron_fournier Not true.  Independent can‚Äôt win in this trump time.  Maybe after this moment is over.
@wkpixley1 @ron_fournier I have advocated being strategic about this.  Needs to be right person in right moment.  In this case, it is neither.
@raycoletv @ron_fournier Thanks.  Ron and i will always be brothers from different mothers.
@ron_fournier And by the way do you really want a candidate to reform the system who didn‚Äôt even take time to vote in most elections.  And voted in no local elections.
@ron_fournier There are a hundred data points that independents can‚Äôt win in this moment.  And you and i both know that Hillary Clinton had vastly different liabilities than the dem nominee in 2020 is likely to have.  Also it can be argued that 3rd party candidates in 2016 helped elect Trump.
@wkpixley1 @ron_fournier Agree with this.  You just can‚Äôt throw any candidate at any election at any time.  Otherwise it sets back your goal.  Which is likely exactly what Schulz will do.  He is likely to setback the independent goals.

@april_s22 @efalchuk That isn‚Äôt how it works.  It really means the third place finishers votes are reallocated to two top candidates.  Look at the Maine congressional race result last year.
I am a capitalist.  I started 4 successful small businesses.  The way capitalism is practiced in America today does not benefit vast majority of citizens.  Tax code favors the very wealthy. System of cronyism in Washington favors the wealthy. Time to reform American capitalism.

@dscollier Scott, in both those cases either one of the major parties didn‚Äôt run a candidate or a major party candidate didn‚Äôt have a campaign or wasn‚Äôt realistically running.  My point exactly.
Anyone who wants to run for POTUS has right to run.  God bless them.  And every objective analysis would show Schultz as an Independent has a very low probability of getting above 15% of the vote, and a very high probability of being a spoiler. Not clear today who it hurts more.
