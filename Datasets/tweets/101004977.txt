@BerkmanAlex @IkeWeLike @WillisJermane @CovCathColonels @JD_Tuccille It's funny, I almost posted the exact same screen shot you did to prove my point.  The entire article is about how private schools "discriminate", NOT how they are inferior, or line the pockets of anyone, or give evidence that they are a hot bed for molestation
@BerkmanAlex @IkeWeLike @WillisJermane @CovCathColonels @JD_Tuccille - schools choice is a movement to bankrupt public schools, bust teacher unions and line the pockets of of corporate reformers	- failed the people is was designed to help
@BerkmanAlex @IkeWeLike @WillisJermane @CovCathColonels @JD_Tuccille Which of your points does the article address?		- privatizing schools is dumb	- asked me to spend time looking at the track record of charter schools	- private schools are great if you want your kids to be molested

@DjRBaer @TJUrban13 @Jazzziered @OMGthetruth1 @KamalaHarris I think that's a good point to agree to disagree on: yes he was emotional, but I disagree that he was emotional to the idea of it being a smear campaign.  I think he was emotional in the face of some pretty vicious accusation to which he feels he is innocent.

@OurRepublic12 @Elizabethbryso5 @FrankLuntz Again, I pretty much agree.  But... does it mean something that most believed Trump vs HRC?

@AuroraContrer @SenKamalaHarris Agreed... in a normal persons reality they were hysterical.  		@SenKamalaHarris reality? ... let‚Äôs just say she could understand them just fine #HystericalDemocrats
@DonIrwin17 @dazzee @SenKamalaHarris Hysterical people are typically hard to understand...
@funder @realDonaldTrump If there is one thing I know about MD's, it's that they always jump on the chance to diagnose a patient they've never met.		Good job Dworkor üí©
@robhornick @EWErickson @JoshhTerry Grand Moff Tarkin would never speak out anonymously üëç
This might be the funniest thing I have ever watched ü§£ @KamalaHarris is quite clearly a flat-lined, brain-dead moron.  Watch until the end: "ok, I'll move on.  Clearly you're not going to answer the question" 		I honestly can't believe we're witnessing this meltdown https://t.co/wvn4eHcLYK
@_TravisWade @JonahNRO @SethAMandel I would have agreed with you a few months ago, but honestly now I'm not so sure.  We've never witnessed the left totally lose it the way we're seeing now (completely unhinged)  I really thing this could be phase 1 of their nuclear option (and I realize this sounds crazy)...
@DavidAFrench Are you so sure about #1?  A year ago I would be, but now...  IDK, let's just say that it wouldn't surprise me.		Totally agree with 2-4 though.
@Mikel_Jollett I think you're forgetting about, I don't know, 100 other elections?		Obama was only entitled to make an appointment: the Senate is entitled to have a hearing or a vote to confirm.		Dems could try winning more than one branch of government at a time?
@PhilipTerzian Kool-Aid party üôâ yes!!!
@GovMikeHuckabee Well Governor, they WERE elected as Senators to our great country (as hard as that may be to believe)... Unfortunately. So we have to let them say their piece, ask their questions, and eventually vote.
Yes it is... https://t.co/7YKj17XQ8b
Seriously this thread is completely insane folks.  The more replies it gets, the more delusional the left proves to be (at a time I didn't think it could get anymore delusional).
This thread ü§£		Why are mommy and daddy fighting?  		Dem's and left are so emotional I can't stop reading.  		Anyway, @jonfavs a tool Dems can use (that they haven't tried): convincing the electorate they they actually have good ideas that can contribute positively to our society https://t.co/AEcmmxiV49
