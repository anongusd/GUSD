Meadows has voted against the expansion of voting rights. That’s racism. He has refused to fix the Voting Rights Act. That’s racism.
If we make this about one person &amp; let Trump’s enablers off the hook, we will do history a disservice &amp; further disable the ability of the public to grapple w/ what caused &amp; created the context for Trump to be elected.
With Cohen’s testimony today, folks are saying America was coned to elect Trump. But America voted with eyes wide open in long tradition of reaction to progress.
Mark Meadows says Trump is not a racist b/c he has never heard him say a racist word or b/c he can find a black person to say Trump is not a racist. This is the problem: extremists like Meadows think racism is just words &amp; will not acknowledge policy racism.

And if Northam can’t begin w/ protecting the African-American Union Hill community from present day environmental racism, then his claim to desire reconciliation is hollow. Action must precede reconciliation.
Trump called Warren “fraudulent.” Media shouldn’t let a fraud like Trump critize Warren. There’s no comparison to his lies. Focus on policy &amp; don’t get distracted by the clown show &amp; attacks. Only the truth will set America free.

Why are some in the media continually expecting Trump to change with a speech? The man is a liar. He can give a written speech, but his actions &amp; his policies are extreme &amp; immoral. Jesus once said, “You say one thing with your mouth, but your heart is far from me.”
One hour and thirty minutes. Not a single policy mentioned to address our nation’s 140 million poor people.
Trump believes fair taxes for the wealthy is socialism, that providing health care is socialism. What he really believes is socialism and welfare for corporation and greedy.
Trump says he wants to fight child cancer, lower prescription drug costs, and cherish life but he’s supporting extremist policies that would block access to affordable healthcare.		He says he wants to put more women to work but he doesn’t support paying living wages.
Over an hour in and all I’m hearing is our President blame immigrants for lack of wages, healthcare and opportunities for education, all while refusing to take responsibility for the policies that are destroying our communities.
We see right through this coded language. We see right through this push for even more systemic racism.

A wall is not racist; it’s the the rationale, lies &amp; philosophy behind Trump’s wall that is racist. Water fountains, buses &amp; lunch counters were not racist, but they were segregated by lies, a philosophy &amp; rationale that were racist.
Democrats &amp; Republicans are not in the sandbox. Trump created this mess—he &amp; his enablers who’ve given him his way, even when wrong. Pelosi can’t be blamed. If you give him his racist &amp; unjust wall, built on lies, he will keep demanding more like any bully.
I would like to challenge some of your guests who get so bent out of shape about words but then by next week are no longer talking about racism. It’s been w/ us in policy for 400 years. We need to name how white supremacy has shaped the structures of our common life.
Even if every member of the House votes to denounce the words of white nationalism &amp; supremacy, their action is at best anemic &amp; at worst hypocritical unless they denounce the political agenda of white supremacy.
Lyndon Johnson said some racist things, but he signed the Civil Rights Acts &amp; VRA; Ronald Regan was polished w/ words &amp; even signed legislation on MLK b day, but his policies on voting rights &amp; funding civil rights divisions of the government were bad.
If you support voter suppression, discriminatory immigration policies, denial of healthcare &amp; living wages, all of which have disparate racial impact, then no matter what you say, you are supporting an agenda that is embraced by white nationalism.
Love your show, @ChrisCuomo. On Rep King &amp; racism, please consider: if we identify white nationalism &amp; white supremacy as simply being rude &amp; wrong with words, we make a huge mistake.  	White supremacy is about policy. That’s why Dr King fought to change laws, not language.
Don’t believe the lie that the gov’t shutdown is about Democrats not being willing to compromise. Dems in House &amp; Senate have voted on bi-partisan compromise bills. This is about President Trump &amp; the refusal of Republicans to stand up to him long before the shutdown.
So the GOP took Steve King off of committees. But will they still support voter suppression, demonizing immigrants &amp; trying to take healthcare away? B/c if you don’t repent of the policies of white nationalism, denouncing the words means little.
Obama suggested affordable healthcare &amp; GOP declared him a socialist. Trump conceals notes of private conversations w/ foreign adversary he is credibly accused of cooperating with &amp; GOP defends him. This is the definition of white privilege.
Every time a Democrat talks about living wages &amp; healthcare for all, CNN and others say they are moving to the left. These issues are not left or right issues, but moral issues. They’re at the moral center of our constitutional promises &amp; religious values.
To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

The real national emergency is Trump &amp; his enablers seeking to block healthcare, refusing to address voter suppression, rolling back environmental regulations, &amp; blocking living wages.
The real national emergency is how GOP Congress members have enabled Trump’s extremism. It’s those Americans who gave him power by voting out of fear and racist backlash.
To those who say, “Trump should give DACA, Pelosi should do the wall,” we must say a clear, “No.” The wall isn’t negotiable b/c it’s based on lies, racism &amp; white nationalism. It’s like saying “White Only” signs were OK as long as Black folks got clean restrooms.
Mitch McConnell should come out of the closet &amp; challenge the President. You can’t blame Pelosi &amp; Schumer for refusing to give the President anything more than McConnell could get thru the Senate before Christmas.
He said he swore an oath to protect the country. How does lying to the country, blocking healthcare &amp; shutting down the government protect the country? It doesn’t.
If his policies, like denying healthcare &amp; deregulating corporations who poison air, water &amp; earth cause people to die, how would he propose we deal with him?
Trump said we should put up his wall b/c of a small percentage of incidents where illegal immigrants engaged in violent crime. Well, if the violent crime is higher among citizens, what should we do w/ them?
RT @wilsonhartgrove: Say it plain: Trump’s wall isn’t immoral b/c it would be expensive &amp; unnecessary. It’s immoral b/c it’s his shorthand…
Rick Santorum said Trump was softer and made a good argument. Trump lied, profiled Latinos &amp; pushed a racist &amp; immoral agenda. That’s good presentation? Come on Santorum!
They want to give corporations welfare &amp; 140 million poor &amp; low wealth people social Darwinism.
Remember Bannon said, “We are going to get rid of the administrative state.” There’s a connection thru history b/w those who hated Freedman’s bank &amp; hospital, those who hated the New Deal &amp; those who hated the gains of the civil rights movement.
On this shutdown, remember: Trump &amp; his enablers hate government, except for tax cuts &amp; contracts that go to their business. This a fortaste of what we’d see if extremists cut the budget &amp; ended so-called entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare &amp; housing assistance.
Sen Thom Tillis says he breaks w/ Donald Trump on shutdown, but didn’t Tillis support Trump &amp; his wall, his tax cuts for the wealthy, his attacks on voting rights &amp; healthcare?
Two were extremists for immorality, &amp; thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth &amp; goodness, &amp; thereby rose above his environment.”

The call has come. My baby brother has broken free of the cocoon, transformed. Like the butterfly he has broken free of the cocoon of struggle &amp; sickness. He is w/ the Lord now, and his memory is w/ the ages.
Mitt Romeny says Trump is immoral, but hasn’t Romney supported Trump’s polices? Is he only talking about Trump’s rhetoric? What’s immoral about Trump &amp; his enablers is their attacks on immigrants, voting rights, the poor, the uninsured, &amp; the environment while they push tax cuts.
By voting to maintain the status quo of attacking the least of our brothers and sisters, critiques from Republicans like Romney are suspect suggest all they really want is someone who can do the same policy damage as Trump but in a more refined, dignified manner.
Unless @MittRomney calls out the Trump and his enablers for attacks on immigrants, voting rights, the poor, the uninsured, and the environment, his critique is rendered anemic, disingenuous  and opportunistic
Romney says @realDonaldTrump is immoral, but he’s just referring to the President’s words, not his policies.
Yes, Newton was a slave trader. But he later became an abolitionist &amp; the song is true theologically. It’s one of my brother’s favorite hymns.
A verse from “Amazing Grace” that we never hear, but it speaks of a miracle by faith:	“Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail /	And mortal life shall cease, /	I shall possess, within the veil, /	A life of joy and peace.”
Please continue to pray for my family &amp; especially my baby brother, who is facing inoperable pancreatic cancer. Your kind words &amp; love have made such a difference in our lives.

Trump isn’t a mistake; he is the result of continually sowing to the winds of race and class division only to reap a whirlwind of chaos.
Some Republicans are now saying they made a mistake w/ Trump. But Trump is not the mistake; he’s only a symptom. His enablers agree w/ the majority of his policy decisions b/c they grew out of white Southern Strategy that’s been deliberately used for last 50 years.
B/c of Trump &amp; his enablers, babies are dying in detention, health &amp; human services offices are closed, healthcare is threatened &amp; workers don’t have living wages. We must keep building a movement to save the heart &amp; soul of America. Go to	https://t.co/hlk2qv6jk1 to learn more.
People are dying because of poverty, border policies and lack of healthcare. All of this is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.
Those religious leaders who continue to enable @realDonaldTrump in silence should only be ashamed, but challenged for their moral and theological malpractice.
.@realdonaldtrump This Christmas season, I urge you to follow Jesus’s teachings, not the way of Herod who taxed and hurt the poor, allowed children to die and deported families.
What the President Trump and his enablers are doing to children is just mean and inhumane. Their border policies embody the spirit of Herod rather than the teachings of Jesus. We must build a movement of love and justice to fight a system fueled by fear and division. https://t.co/luW3kZ2UFg

Perhaps this is our Eve of more love, more justice, more possibility and more change for goodness. May we begin to imagine that something new is being born. May we, like Mary, hold on and push until God’s way is born in our world!
She took breaths, in and out. She believed. She did not turn from God’s purpose. She did not try to change it like Eve of the garden. She believed this was a new Eve—the beginning of the Incarnation of love, truth and justice. She pushed and held on.

This is dangerous b/c in the same way he has done this, he could take us to war.
I’m against war &amp; the war economy, but the way Trump removed troops w/out clearly explaining it to the American people &amp; admitting America’s flawed policy sets him up to appoint generals who will do whatever he says.
We are seeing now what happens when a president gets away w/ systemic racism &amp; attacks on voting rights, immigrants, &amp; healthcare w/ support rather than push back from his own party. He feels he can do anything. Is Trump the problem or the party that enabled him?

He says in public what the extremists who’ve hikacked the GOP practice in private &amp; in policy.
What most who are Republicans dislike about Trump is his out-in-the-open disdain for his critics, open racism, obvious dishonesty &amp; negative displays of frantic emotionalism.
Some Republicans say Trump has torn up their party by pushing a non-conservative agenda. Not true. His character is bad &amp; his policies are bad, but his policies are the extreme policies of extreme conservatives that have been extreme for a long time.

This vacancy was held open for the entire Obama presidency b/c North Carolina Senators resisted integration of this court, and the Senate refused to override their wishes. Call you Senators and say NO on nomination of Thomas Farr.
Justice Timmons-Goodson was the first African-American woman appointed to serve on North Carolina’s Supreme Court and she won re-election statewide in 2006. Senators Richard Burr &amp; Thom Tillis refused to return the blue-slip on her nomination as well.
The Senate adhered to its longstanding practice of deferring to home-State Senators, which it has now abandoned, and the nomination did not proceed.  In 2016, President Obama attempted another nomination with North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Patricia Timmons-Goodson.
In 2013, Obama nominated North Carolina federal prosecutor Jennifer May-Parker, who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents. But NC Sen Richard Burr refused to return his blue-slip, despite his previous recommendation of May-Parker for the position.
This is the longest judicial vacancy in the federal court system. President Obama tried to integrate this court by nominating 2 superbly qualified African-American women.

Yes, challenge a rally &amp; expose the lies of white supremacy. But if you’re committed to stopping white nationalism, then organize voters and push back against policies.
Let's focus on the politicians who pass the policies endorsed by white nationalism.
If Americans want to deal w/ racism, let’s focus on racist policies like voter suppression, gerrymandering, attacks on Latino families &amp; children, resegregation of public schools, denial of healthcare &amp; living wages.

Lastly, Trump is taking health care, supporting voter suppression, stacking courts with extreme judges, cutting public education, &amp; resisting living wages—all policies that hurt African-Americans.
Indeed, these rates have been falling relatively steadily since around 2010, early in President Obama's tenure in the White House.
Economists note that unemployment rates had been falling before Trump took office &amp; their declines don't appear to have picked up speed. This implies that there's nothing specific that Trump did to change this rate.
Also, Trump was handed a good economy, while Obama was handed recession. Obama had to do more and did.
Trump keeps saying that under him, unemployment among African Americans is the lowest in history. Not true. We didn't even start measuring Af-Am unemployment until 1972.
We need caring public servants who don’t focus on labels but on the people. Extremists focus on labels &amp; false arguments because their policies hurt the  people.
These corporate socialists believe in paying workers less than a living wage so that American workers have to depend on public assistance.
Truth is, many extreme Republicans believe in corporate welfare for the wealthy. They treat corporations like people &amp; people like things. They give tax cuts to the greedy &amp; cut programs for children &amp; the sick.
Just tell them who you are: a lover of all people, of democracy &amp; of the least of these. Say, “I'm a constitutionalist b/c I believe in the establishment of justice, the promotion of the general welfare &amp; equal protection under the law.
My brother @BenJealous, don't play the extremist game about whether you are a socialist. They would call Jesus, Dr. King, FDR &amp; Mother Teresa socialists &amp; half of them don't even know what the term means.

Every black politician &amp; progressive politician from City Council to Congress, even if running unopposed, should commit to increase the turnout. Let’s vote like the slaves hoped one day we could. If we ever needed to vote, we sure do need to vote now!
Every time Trump attacks a black athlete or pushes a racist policy, we must register people to vote and let our voting talk at the ballot box.
All of the athletes should get together &amp; use their star power to challenge systemic racism w/ a massive Get Out the Vote campaign. It would be a slam dunk, three pointer, crossover, touchdown &amp; home run for justice in America.
53 yrs ago today, the VRA was signed into law. Conservative extremists have gutted the VRA &amp; pushed voter suppression laws through 23 state houses. This is the real hacking of our democracy. We must fight back!
We must stop asking, “Is Trump racist?” Not only is he, but every politician willing to go along w/ him for partisan gain is playing the racial politics of the Southern Strategy. A tree will be known by its fruit.
Don Lemon is a brilliant journalist &amp; Labron James is a conscientious, smart athlete. For Trump to call them names is like an ignorant slaveholder calling Frederick Douglass dumb.
If Jeff Sessions wants to do something rooted in religious values, then this task force should direct him &amp; the Trump administration to embrace the religious values of justice, mercy, love, &amp; faith.

In cynically declaring the War on Poverty a success, the Trump administration is attempting to justify its War on Poor People. #PoorPeoplesCampaign https://t.co/D9oY7anI64
Rep Roger Marshall said a man’s word is his bond, so he takes the President at his word. I take Trump at his word, too. It’s consistently a lie, so to trust it is to come unglued.
Glad for the chance to talk w/ my friend @AriBerman about why the fight for voting rights is a fight for the heart of democracy. #PoorPeoplesCampaign https://t.co/nuCf2O2kvq
If Trump doesn’t know how to act around Putin, why would we trust him w/ our healthcare, tax policy, anti-poverty programs or SCOTUS nominees?
Republicans are now asking what they should do with Trump. Here’s an idea: what would you have done if it were Obama? Do that.
The problem isn’t that Trump wants to talk to America’s adversaries. We want leaders who would rather talk than shoot. But what Trump says is treasonous. It’s consistently isolationist &amp; racist. It’s not that he’s talking, but what he’s saying.
This nation’s war on poverty should not only be concentrated on those who are unemployed or homeless; it should also be focused on those who are having to work 2, 3, or 4 jobs just to make ends meet. #PoorPeoplesCampaign https://t.co/Bb3j1aVHlC

Grateful to be w/ @JoyAnnReid &amp; my brother @wilsonhartgrove for a Moral Moment on #AMJoy this morning to talk about the lies of #SlaveholderReligion &amp; what the Bible really says about immigrants.
The suggestion that the only people who are poor are those who are too lazy to work is a lie that must be challenged.
Trump’s White House claims the War on Poverty is “largely over.” This is a lie of the 1st order. Just ask the 140 million Americans who are poor or low income—the 37 mil w/out health insurance or the quarter million who will die of low wealth this year. https://t.co/A2swq3IUBi
To see Trump’s enablers in House claiming bias in the investigation against him is the height of hypocrisy. When report after report demonstrated prosecutorial bias vs poor black &amp; brown people, Republicans said nothing. But for a rich white man, the system is biased?
Trump at NATO sounds like Nero. We need #MoralResistance to say there’s a better way.
The Caesars who ruined Rome imagined themselves to be gods, but the early church called leaders to serve humanity, stand for the poor &amp; do justice.
Those of us who took vows to preach the Gospel can’t do our job in America today w/out helping people distinguish b/w #SlaveholderReligion &amp; the Christianity of Christ. https://t.co/JDKT78zXw8

Our ancestors refused to be silenced and so must we. NOW is the time to come together, fight forward and build a long-term movement - not just for an election season.
When our ancestors faced a #SCOTUS, president and Congress that opposed them, they took to the streets and the ballot box to make their voices heard.
We must now have mass voter mobilization and nonviolent civil disobedience.
We must engage in mass voter registration and mobilization, and nonviolent civil disobedience in order to build a political system that upholds justice for all. Fusion organizing among the poor and working poor is a must otherwise we will keep loosing.
We are seeing attacks from the court on workers rights, voting rights, and equal protection under the law. This is a serious moment that calls for a Moral Revival.
McConnell steals a Supreme Court seat in a way we haven’t seen since the 1800s &amp; now the court is voting like post-1870s, making decisions based on partisan ideology rather than upholding judicial independence.
Today’s #SCOTUS decision is an attack on unions when we need them most. But no court case can weaken a movement. I pledge to stand alongside working people as we continue to organize and fight for a more just economy. #union https://t.co/4QH36bL9TM

Palestinian children are being killed because they are targeted as radicals simply b/c they want freedom.

Jewish children were killed &amp; separated when targeted w/ Hitler’s anti-Semitism &amp; Holocaust. Black children like Emmett Till were stolen &amp; killed by Jim Crow.
Children were killed when indigenous Natives were targeted with racism &amp; injustice. Black  children were stolen &amp; separated when black people were targeted with slavery &amp; racism.

Too many people are excluded including immigrants, it uses risk assessments in an untested and unconventional manner that could exacerbate racial disparities, it will increase privatization of public services in fed prison, &amp; it puts too much discretion in AG and wardens’ hands.
While the bill makes some improvements to the system, it may cause some unintentional harm.
The time to address our prison problem comprehensively is now.  Those pushing the so-called “prison reform bill” need to step back and then step up with the nation so we can address the full issue of sentencing reform and prison reform together.
Mandatory minimums have driven the explosion of our federal prison system populations. Making reforms on the backend of the prison system only will not have any meaningful impact on our mass incarceration problem.
Any prison reform effort must address and stop the unjust continuation of mass incarceration that has stole and disenfranchised thousands of black, brown and poor white members of our communities.
Having a partial and incomplete prison reform bill that doesn’t address sentencing reform is not a first step—it’s a bad step and a side step.
We must end mandatory minimums if we are serious about fixing the criminal justice system in this country. We cannot play the politics of “piecemilling.” The moral position requires that we demand our politicians deal with establishing justice fully, not just partially.

If you can’t join us in the streets, we need your help online to stand alongside the poor and those who are impacted by policy violence.
It’s not the stormy saga we should be concerned about. What we really should be paying attention to is the racism and economic storm that is destroying the lives of poor people across this nation!
Whether you look at morality as outlined in our constitution or in our sacred text, we can agree that it is immoral to have 37 million people without healthcare. It is immoral the way elected leaders do nothing while the vote is being suppressed.
There are thousands of people who are homeless of every race, creed, color, sexual orientation, and gender identity. We can end homelessness in the U.S. but we must elect politicians who have the moral conviction to respond and stand up for the poor.
There are 64 million people who work for less than a living wage. This is immoral when we know we have the resources to ensure every person can be paid what they deserve.
There are 250K people who are dying every year from poverty and low wealth. This is unacceptable in the riches nation on the planet.
Brother @NickKristof rightfully called out the media’s addiction to Trump and the “Trump porn” nature of reporting. We need the media to focus on the lewd, nasty, and heartless ways that violent public policies are destroying the lives of people across the country.
We cannot continue to have a democracy that engages in daily attacks on the poor through immoral public policies.
Today in more than 30 states and in the District of Columbia activists, clergy and the poor are organizing nonviolent moral fusion direct actions to confront the policy violence that is devastating our nation.

Yesterday @POTUS claimed to love prayer while some religious leaders played court chaplain, despite his unjust policies. Today he goes to speak at NRA &amp; bless the very group that is fighting gun control &amp; banning assault weapons ban.
My faith calls me to preach good news for all people in the public square. That doesn’t mean converting everyone to Christianity. It means if I’m going to be a Christian, I have a responsibility to make sure my government treats everybody right. https://t.co/ITyhzoGGEu
Extortion is rife, robbery is epidemic, the poor and needy are abused, outsiders are kicked around at will, with no access to justice.” Ez 22
Your preachers cover up for the politicians by pretending to have received visions &amp; special revelations. They say, “This is what God, the Master, says . . .” when God hasn’t said so much as one word. 6/
They tell people there’s no difference between right &amp; wrong. They’re contemptuous of my holy Sabbaths, profaning me by trying to pull me down to their level. Your politicians are like wolves prowling and killing and rapaciously taking whatever they want. 5/
The prophet Ezekiel decries such theological malpractice: “Your priests violated my law and desecrated my holy things. They can’t tell the difference between sacred and secular. 4/
You can't ignore attacks on immigrants, children, &amp; the sick for a photo op in the Rose Garden. This is what Jesus called “ignoring the weightier matters of the law” (Mt 23:23). 3/
You can't lift the name of MLK while promoting systemic racism. You can't talk about the church's charity while denying the government's responsibility to the poor. You can't trumpet religious freedom when your party just fired a chaplain for praying. 2/
For @POTUS &amp; @VP to stand in the Rose Garden for #NationalDayOfPrayer while promoting policies that hurt the least of these is height of hypocrisy. For some clergy to stand there &amp; endorse this is a sham. 1/
Black, white &amp; brown—people of faith &amp; people of conscience—we must come together to reclaim America’s moral narrative from the heirs of #slaveholderreligion. https://t.co/TLTKg8LgFF
We have 12 million vacant &amp; abandoned living quarters in America. This does not have to be. 140 million poor &amp; low wealth people is not an act of God; it is an immoral failure of will in the richest nation in the world.
What we saw today made me say like Fannie Lou Hamer, “I question America. They fly the flag here to say to America, “This is how you care about us.”
Black liberation theology has sought to save the soul of theology. Like the prophet Isaiah before him, Dr. James Cone refused to stop crying loud. We are all the better for his incredible academic and prophetic ministry.
Dr. Cone’s unwavering commitment to this central theological foundation has served as a thorn in the side of western theology, which has often sought to justify oppression, &amp; as a source of inspiration in the spirits of those seeking to be true to the prophetic call of God.
James Cone made clear that God has a distinct concern for the oppressed. To claim allegiance to God requires an allegiance to &amp; advocacy w/ the oppressed.

It amazes me how people who are the descendent of those who came onto this land, engaged in genocide &amp; built the country w/ slavery—2 crimes against humanity—dare to say that Dreamers are illegal.
We who preach &amp; teach from a prophetic ethic focus on systems of oppression 	&amp; try to expose how they are unfaithful to our deepest values b/c God says these policies are based in lies &amp; put spells on the public in order to exacerbate inequality &amp; rob people of justice.
In this text those who cause economic pain for the poor &amp; vulnerable are called ‘adulterers’—people who’ve left God— 	‘perjurers’ b/c they lie to the people, 	&amp; sorcerers b/c their policy is designed to confound &amp; harm.
A little Bible lesson: In Malachi 3, God says, “So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify vs sorcerers, adulterers &amp; perjurers, vs those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress widows &amp; orphans &amp; deprive the foreigners among you of justice...”

To put children who need health care and DACA for young people up against a wall is similar to saying, “We’ll give you voting rights, but you have to accept grandfather clause and poll taxes.” There is nothing clean, moral, or right about it.

Sen Flake compared some of Trump’s actions to Stalin. We should remember that Fascism also specializes in othering people, lying about groups of people in order to harm &amp; discriminate. This is dangerous territory, rooted in language and strategy of racism.
The Trump administration is using misleading info to blame “immigrants,” which for them is a code word for black &amp; brown people. This is an old pattern: blame people of color for America’s violence. Upon closer examination, it’s always proven to be a lie.
How immoral &amp; mean can you be, @SpeakerRyan? You use DACA students &amp; sick children who need CHIP as leverage to fund a racist wall &amp; to push brown people out of the country. Our problem is not just Trump, but a moral deficit in the mind, soul &amp; agenda of far too many politicians.

Truth be told, sometimes when I see what they are doing, I want to say it’s a d&amp;@n shame. But what I feel &amp; may say is in no way comparative to the cursing they are doing.
The President &amp; those who defend him are cursing, not blessing the nation. They curse every time they cover up racism, write tax policy, healthcare policy &amp; voter suppression policies that hurt &amp; discriminate. This is cursing.
Theologically, there is a difference b/w profanity &amp; cursing. To curse is to pronounce harm. For a President to write off whole countries as "sh!&amp;holes" in the course of advocating policies of discrimination and inequality is cursing.

We’ve got to get beyond the antics and address the policy.
And it’s not just Trump. Everyone in his administration—including Ben Carson who stood beside him to praise an imaginary Dr. King—is participating in systemic racism.
Voter suppression &amp; the lie of voter fraud is systemic racism. Attacking &amp; deporting immigrants is white supremacy. Gutting the government to give a tax break to the wealthiest Americans disproportionately impacts black and brown people. That’s systemic racism.
Whatever words come out of his mouth, Trump has shown us his policy. And it’s racist.

Democrats need to spend every day up until the vote showing how this bill hurts the poor, our children, our families, communities of color, &amp; working people so that everybody will know what they voted for.
Instead of calling this the big tax cut, call it the Big Pay Back. They are paying back all the money spent to get them into office, plus interest.
Sens Corker, Rubio &amp; others have said Trump is unstable, yet they are willing to side w/ him on a tax bill that will hurt poor ppl, undermine healthcare, &amp; raise taxes on working people. Trump alone is not the problem; it's the greed &amp; immorality of Congress.
If you support a racist like Roy Moore to push a tax plan that will hurt black people while undermining protections of the 14th amendment &amp; refusing to fully stand against white supremacists, you are promoting racism, no matter the color of your skin.
@Omarosa45 If you refuse to speak out against voter suppression &amp; lie about voter fraud, that's racist. If you work to cut healthcare, which has a disparate impact on black people, that's racist. When you attack immigrants of color, that’s racist.

After last night, if Democrats don't change &amp; decide to stand on priniciple &amp; address race &amp; poverty in the South, they will have undermined the possibility of a #ThirdReconstruction in America. As the South goes, so goes the nation.
Republicans who say they are happy with Jones’ victory but still plan to pass a tax bill that will hurt children, the sick, &amp; the poor are just as bad as Moore on policy. Until they change direction, their moral platitudes ring hollow.
When we challenge the immoral policies of political extremism &amp; run campaigns focused on health care, lifting the poor, addressing racism &amp; voter suppression, victories can come out of the South &amp; shift the nation. #PoorPeoplesCampaign https://t.co/8YRv01H36F
This victory is a sign. We can win in the South if we fight long &amp; strong, raise a moral critique, &amp; take on hypocrisy, black, white, &amp; brown together!
If we reshape the South by just 4 states, we change the entire country. If this can happen in Alabama, it can happen anywhere. Jones’ victory can expose how GOP has led people to vote against their own interests. 2/
If we organize &amp; challenge immoral policy of so-called white evangelicalism in the South, we can see black &amp; white vote move. Fusion coalition building + increased voter turnout + a big push at the last moment flipped Senate seat in AL. What if we went in early &amp; stayed long? 1/

To give thanks is to admit that our lives are gifts, not achievements. We love b/c we’ve been loved &amp; fight for justice b/c someone fought before us to make our freedom possible.
The President’s claim that Roy Moore is right on taxes, guns &amp; borders reveals that greed, violence &amp; racism are this administration’s policy priorities. Anyone conflating this agenda w/ God’s agenda is engaged in hypocrisy &amp; heresy. America needs a #MoralRevival

For the record: the Bible teaches that Joseph married Mary &amp; was faithful to her thru great trials. He didn’t sexually assault her as a minor; he shielded her from shame &amp; violence when ppl couldn’t understand a virgin birth.
AL auditor’s bizarre read on the Holy family reveals twisted logic of #slaveholderreligion. If you read the Bible to justify hurting the ppl Jesus loved, you can no longer see the good news for anyone.
After #ElectionDay, glad to talk w/ @esglaude abt why we need a movement to revive the heart &amp; soul of our democracy. https://t.co/XELjHUlmn9
Whether your policy or your personal actions hurt children, Jesus said it would be better to be thrown in the sea w/ a millstone tied around your neck than to harm one of God’s precious little ones.
Almost every policy Roy Moore stands for threatens poor &amp; vulnerable children, but it took accusation of child abuse/sexual assault for GOP to shun him.
On @CNN, Pastor @jackngraham said he can’t talk abt gun laws b/c that’s political. But he advises the President b/c they agree on a political agenda. Preachers don’t get to opt out of politics; we can be chaplains of Empire or prophets of God.
Does anyone, even the most gun-loving American, want to live in a society where we pray with rifles at our sides? https://t.co/zMmDs4s5TA
Mass shootings are mental health AND gun issue, a spiritual crisis that exposes moral bankruptcy of our #WarEconomy. https://t.co/UTwNZ14F5r

Compromise on moral truth does not lead to peace, but genocide, injustice &amp; abuse. This is lesson we must learn from history.
Wld 4 days of slavery w/ a long weekend have been OK? Compromise on the humanity of black, brown, and native ppl is America's original sin.
Former General &amp; CoS Kelly said a lack of compromise led to the Civil War. What the...heaven? I guess he was happy w/ the 3/5ths compromise.

You can't condemn white nationalists while condoning their policy agenda. https://t.co/yacQQwZrQ5
To say you are against white supremacy without standing up against the polices that embolden white supremacists is hypocrisy.
Will they repent for how silent they were when Trump used birtherism to rally white supremacists for his campaign?
Will they increase &amp; call for support of federal investigation of unarmed Blacks killed by police?
Will they stop the racist attacks on immigrants? Will they challenge and stop the AG from ending affirmative action?
Will they challenge the “let's make America great again” language, which is a racist and xenophobic narrative?
Will they stop racializing Obamacare &amp; claiming that everything Obama did is bad, which is a white supremacist narrative?
Will they acknowledge the racist voters suppression in 2016 &amp; join SCOTUS  to condemn racist gerrymandering?
Will they fully reinstate the voting rights act to stop racist voter suppression and gerrymandering?
Will they call for Bannon &amp; alt-right policies to be removed from their agenda?
Will they challenge the race driven policies of the White House and their own agenda?
Ryan, McConnell, Rubio &amp; others oppose the white supremacy in Charlottesville. Ok, we all do. But here is the test:
Thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; &amp; then shalt thou see clearly to cast out t/mote out of thy brother's eye (7:5)
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? (Matthew 7:4 KJV)
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? (Matthew 7:3 KJV)

We must meet this moral crisis w/ #MoralResistance not b/c it will stop the attack. It won't. Things may get worse before they get better.
The backlash that gave us Trump also gave us this Congress &amp; its leadership; it produced the reactionary religion of Trump's evangelicals.
The assault on 'Obamacare' is about undoing the legacy of America's 1st black president. It is the policy proposal of birtherism.

Where are the so-called pro-life evangelicals? What good is your religious freedom if you've forgotten that true religion is to do justice?
...extortion is rife, robbery is epidemic, the poor &amp; needy are abused, outsiders are kicked around at will, with no access to justice.
Ezekiel is calling out to us: Your politicians are like wolves prowling and killing and rapaciously taking whatever they want...
Isaiah says, "Woe unto you who legislate evil--who rob the poor of their right &amp; make widows &amp; orphans your prey!"
And he cries again: They grind the penniless into the dirt, shove the luckless into the ditch.
Amos cries out: People for them are only things—ways of making money. They’d sell a poor man for a pair of shoes.

Today we see a health care repeal bill that is a sick &amp; sad example of extremist whiling to sacrifice t/lives of t/poor, t/sick &amp; t/elderly.
We honor the sacrifice of “Bloody Sunday” by exposing the lie of “voter fraud,” and challenging voter suppression in our country. https://t.co/jkMN5U1x6h
Decades later the 2013 Shelby decision, which nullified t/preclearance requirements of the VRA, opened t/floodgates for voter suppression.
Brown Chapel became a field hospital for citizens whose skulls were cracked open on t/Edmund Pettus Bridge, showing t/violence of extremism.
The martyrs knew that the reconstruction of democracy could not be complete until the vote was secured.
Today we commemorate “Bloody Sunday” and honor the martyrs of Selma who worked to dramatize the extremism of voter suppression in the South. https://t.co/AiaCz9E36D

The same rational used to justify poll taxes in the old south are being used by southern politicians today who want to suppress the vote.
Photo voter ID is a lie based on the lie about voter fraud. Over and over again from TX to NC it's being proven unconstitutional.

How much blood is on the pews of Brown Chapel AME crying out and telling us not to be silent? We are standing on historic &amp; sacred ground.

Truth is, #SOTU in 2017 is what it was in 1867 &amp; 1967. We need a #ThirdReconstruction to heal the heart of America. https://t.co/Qh7BDFISYT
We need an MRI to diagnose the Moral, Racial, and Income factors that the South has used to lock up the Congress &amp; Electoral College.
It's no accident that these same states have the highest concentration of so-called white evangelicals, 81% on whom voted for Trump.
It's no accident that these are also the states that denied Medicaid expansion, passed voter suppression laws, and elected @realDonaldTrump.
It's no accident that America's historic slave states are also some of the poorest states in America.
To fix our heart, we need an MRI--a three dimensional analysis of Moral, Racial, and Income factors that intersect to create this crisis.
Somethings aren't left or right, Republican or Democrat. Somethings are just wrong. America has a heart problem. Cardiac arrest is #SOTU.
It's wrong that 52 years after Selma, Congress refused to #RestoretheVRA while making it easier to get a gun than it is to vote in America.
It's wrong to lock up the @fightfor15 while Wall Street billionaires get bailouts and take over US economic policy.
It's wrong to host HBCU Presidents for a photo op while @BetsyDeVosED is dismantling public education in the name of "choice."
It’s wrong to nominate @RealBenCarson, who knows nothing about housing, to lead an agency he doesn’t believe in simply b/c he's black.
It’s wrong to put @jeffsessions in charge of protecting voting rights at DOJ when he failed to uphold them as a member of Congress.
It’s wrong to scapegoat Muslim immigrants for violence perpetuated by divisive rhetoric &amp; extreme foreign policy.
It's wrong to blame economic challenges on poor ppl, immigrants, and POC while you give welfare to corporations thru dramatic tax cuts.
It's wrong to take healthcare away from 22 million Americans w/out a viable plan to replace it.
We don't need alternative lies from @realDonaldTrump, but honest assessment of #SOTU. America needs moral clarity.

Talking about voter fraud and crime-ridden communities while plotting voter suppression is systemic racism.
Promoting "law &amp; order" policies that target poor black and brown people for mass incarceration is systemic racism.
Attacking "entitlement" programs that serve more white people than black or brown people is systemic racism.
Gutting public education in the name of "choice" is systemic racism &amp; has been since Brown vs Board of Education.
Scapegoating Muslim refugees &amp; mobilizing a deportation force is systemic racism. #NoBanNoWall
Denying living wages to the 54% of African Americans who make less than living wages is systemic racism. #MoralAgenda #FightFor15
Repealing health care access, which impacts three million African Americans, is systemic racism. #SaveACA #MoralAgenda
Refusing to restore the Voting Rights Act is systemic racism. #RestoreVRA #MoralAgenda
If senate rules allow the truth to be shut down then the Senate rules are wrong.
.@SenatorSessions and anyone who has a record of supporting systemic racism should not be protected from the truth of their own record.
Not only is @RealDonaldTrump allergic to the truth, but many members of the U.S. Senate are too.
.@SenWarren was wrongfully rebuked by Republican leaders because they cannot handle the truth.
Mrs. King’s words were based in fact back then and they should be considered now.
.@SenWarren quoted Coretta Scott King who told the truth about @SenatorSessions history of embracing systemic racism.
Republican extremist just proved that they cannot handle the truth about their support of policies rooted in systemic racism past &amp; present.
What happened tonight in the U.S. Senate is only further truth that we must deal with the issue of systemic racism in America.

Why trust what he says abt jobs? @realDonaldTrump doesn't misspeak. He lies. To say it doesn't matter is also a lie. #MoralResistance
Don't be distracted by promise of jobs. If he lies abt voting, he'll lie abt replacing ACA, protecting DACA, putting American worker 1st.
But more troubling than their lie is GOP's refusal to address voter suppression &amp; its impact on Af-Ams, Latinos, &amp; the poor. #RestoreVRA
His lie abt voter fraud is same lie GOP used in NC to justify worst voter suppression law in the country, which was overturned by fed court.
As someone who's fought real voter suppression in NC, I'm troubled by @realDonaldTrump's #alternativefacts on voter fraud.

We cannot have a U.S. Attorney General who consistently promotes hateful, race-based ideology both in word and in deed.
If neither do, Congress must refuse to confirm this nominee.
.@realdonaldtrump should withdraw @SenatorSessions name from nomination. @SenatorSessions should withdraw his own name too.
.@SenatorSessions record shows consistent support for ideological extremism, racist &amp; classist policies, &amp; writing discrimination into law.
Putting @SenatorSessions over the Department of Justice is like putting the fox over the hen house.
Name calling and trying to repeal health care is not funny. People are sick and will die. This is a moral issue.
All people of moral conscience should stand up and resist this behavior with every moral and nonviolent tool available.
Today @realdonaldtrump called a senator a clown for trying to save health care.

We’re holding a press conference Dec. 31, 10 a.m. at @nationalcitycc to discuss our open letter to @realdonaldtrump. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
Please add your name and join our call for @realdonaldtrump to embrace a #MoralAgenda. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
We know from history and from experience in #MoralMondays that prophetic faith is sorely needed to repair the heart of our democracy.
This prophetic tradition of moral dissent has deep foundations upon which we stand today.
And the same moral center claimed by the abolitionists, those who stood against Jim Crow, and those who stood against apartheid.
This is the same moral center claimed by the prophets, Jesus, and the Social Gospelers.
We must move beyond left or right politics, in order to embrace the moral center of this nation.
Standing down is not an option. We'll use every nonviolent tool we have at our disposal to advance a #MoralAgenda. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
From t/state house to t/Congress all elected leaders should know we're committed to standing for our deepest moral values in t/public square
We as religious leaders are compelled to counsel @realdonaldtrump whether he listens and changes or not. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
.@realdonaldtrump needs to hear that declaring “I” and “I alone can fix things” is contrary to the religious value of humility.
We serve the vulnerable not only by personal charity but also public policy.
God defines greatness by who you serve, by how you help the poor, the sick, the immigrant, the broken, and the least of these.
.@realdonaldtrump needs to hear from a broad representation of America’s faith community since he claims faith &amp; will be sworn in on a Bible
Our role as religious leaders is to challenge politicians &amp; call them to repentance &amp; point towards t/values of God. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
Religious leaders of different faiths &amp; colors who understand the role of faith in the public square are not to make politicians comfortable
They have been terribly silent on issues of systemic racism, classism, and militarism in their modern-day manifestations.
There are hundreds of scriptures that call us to work for the poor, the sick, the immigrant, and the least of these. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
They were terribly silent on the more than 2,000 scriptures that call us to public policies which stand for justice.
The so-called white evangelicals surrounding Trump say so much about what God says so little and so little about what God says so much.
This form of evangelicalism endorsed and attached itself to the @realdonaldtrump campaign and it must be challenged.
This limited framework is so far from biblical faith and the politics of God that it's heretical.
This evangelicalism wrongly purports that supporting prayer in school and property rights are the major moral issues of our time.
This evangelicalism wrongly purports that the major moral issues of our time are standing against LGBTQ people and women’s health.
The theological malpractice of t/so-called white evangelicals &amp; others who've placed themselves as Trump's moral support demands a response.
We’ve written @realdonaldtrump &amp; offered, if he is willing, to meet in a House of Worship to discuss a #MoralAgenda. https://t.co/0RroaCpymQ
Or will this community be written off? #MoralRevival
The question now is who will hear the cry of the community and help them get and  regain the health service they once had.
These clergy may now possibly have to bury persons who die from lack of access to emergency room and hospital care.
And blame should be laid at every clergy persons feet charged to stand with and for the poor who were sadly silent.
Blame should be laid at the feet of the board members at @Vidant_Health who accepted distorted truths about profits over people's dignity.
Blame should be laid at the desk of congressional leaders who did not stand up against the demolition of a hospital in their state.
This includes @PatMcCroryNC all the way down to state legislators, especially elected leaders from the area who refused to fight to save it.
Blame should be laid at the feet of every state leader who denied Medicaid expansion and refused to fight to save this hospital.
.@MayorONeal, citizens of Belhaven, our lawyers, and the @NCNAACP fought a righteous fight.
We have lost our way when health care is destroyed and not saved.
Demolition of the Pungo Hospital is an ominous sign of what's happening in America’s moral and political psyche. https://t.co/z6tt5PDUGC
December 29, 2016 is a tragic day for health care and hospital access for poor black, white, and latino people in Belhaven, NC, and America.

Third, you still have not addressed policy and systemic issues.
Why? Because first of all you gloss over the action. Second, you give @realDonaldTrump a white privilege pass you'd never give @BarackObama
How do you move pass racism without repentance and without changing policies? This kind of trivialization is also racism.
For instance, when @SpeakerRyan said last evening that though he said @realDonaldTrump was a racist, now they have moved passed it.
If you discount racial disparities and say we simply address inequality by being “Americans” you are camouflaging white supremacy.
If you refuse to raise wages that hurts black people and you are not disavowing white supremacy.
If you avow cuts to health care that will have disparate impact on black people you are not disavowing white supremacy.
If you disavow white supremacist but still avow over suppression you’re not disavowing white supremacy.
And that if @realDonaldTrump disavowed he would be Ok on race.
I wish white progressives would stop thinking they are addressing racism when they talk about disavowing white supremacist.

Progressives must recognize that only addressing the so-called economic issues without a deep dive into race issues is a form of racism.
You cannot address America’s economic issues without addressing racism and you cannot address racism without addressing economics.
We can’t attempt to address America's problems and psychic wound without a grownup conversation and redemptive focus on race and class.
They say democrats need a better economic message but this is a dangerous analysis.
We can’t blame the election on the rage of the white working class without dealing with the reactionary power of racism.
I’m worried about progressives and Democrats who want to blame @realdonaldtrump election on rage of white working class.

We who believe in justice, equality, and freedom must not rest until it comes!
Everyone of us who believe in justice must live it even more now.
As the political process ends the prophetic task must continue and abound even the more.
Through this period we will have to be faithful and even more committed to what we believe despite what many in the country have done.
And now we will have to suffer the consequences of this election because of the rejection of our higher values.
Many in the country have rejected justice, love, grace, equality, and the common good. This has been exposed for all to see.
This election was ultimately not about Trump and Clinton but something much deeper.
This “rejection" election doesn’t change our calling. We are seeing what we would rather not see but in the economy of God must see.
Like Saul we must keep being the prophetic voice and vision God has called us to be.
“Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.”
Tonight and in the days to come we must understand what God told the prophet Samuel. 1 Samuel 8:7
This is where we redouble our commitment to be instruments of truth, love, and justice.
As ugly as it is we must see the sickness of our country openly and clearly.
This is where we must be honest about the depth of racism and the psychic sickness of our country.
This is a moment where we must remember how our ancestors responded to disappointment without detouring from their march toward justice.
This is a moment were faith must be real.

We need a real conversation on the impacts of poverty, disparity, and classicism on all Americans. #MoralAgenda #MoralRevival #Debates2016
More than 250,000 people die every year from low wealth &amp; 64 million people make less than a living wage.
The only time poverty came up in the #debate was in connection to the Black community.
.@realdonaldtrump took advantage of housing crisis to purchase property and said “that’s business.” No that’s immoral and bad.
It was pointed out during #debate that @realdonaldtrump cheered for the housing crisis.
.@realdonaldtrump said he’s a Christian but he is engaged in immoral and bad behavior.
These issues are critical to the lives and livelihood of black people. #debates
.@realDonaldTrump is representing a party that’ stood against health care, living wages, infrastructure development, criminal justice reform
This is another distortion &amp; distraction from a man representing a party that for the last 50 years consistently stood against voting rights
He’s suggesting Black people are problem people who live in problem communities without taking responsibility for t/policies that cause pain
.@realDonaldTrump says Black people in “inner cities” are "living in hell”. This is a page from southern strategy code words.
.@realDonaldTrump continues to lie, distort, &amp; disrespect t/intelligence of t/American people, especially Blacks, Latinos, &amp; t/poor #debates
The moderator needs to ask where do you stand on healthcare and living wages not just questions about the middle class #debatenight

Today, we are in Charlotte talking with the family of Mr. Scott, key members of the community and city leaders.
Good police don't like bad police. We demand transparency. #CharlotteProtests
#CharlotteProtests are not blacks vs. police. They are black, white and brown vs. brutality &amp; systemic injustice.
#CharlotteProtests have been disrupted by provocateurs who have their own agenda.
#CharlotteProtests know that @GovPatMcCrory signed law to withhold video in cases like this (not in effect until Oct 1).
#CharlotteProtests know that NCGA killed Racial Justice Act &amp; has tried to re-start death penalty.
#CharlotteProtests know cases of men who've been wrongfully convicted &amp; imprisoned.
#CharlotteProtests know that Jonathan Ferrell's killer still hasn't seen justice.
In #CharlotteProtests, there's a lot we don't know. But people are grieving b/c of what we do know.
#CharlotteProtests are mourning DOTS--dialy on-going traumatic syndrome. Not just here. We're weeping as a nation. #BlackLivesMatter

A #MoralRevival is emerging that looks like the America we’ve not yet become. #Remember915
Dr. King preached this @riversidenyc on April 4, 1963 - same year as Birmingham bombing: “Silence is betrayal.” #Remember915
Thank you @valariekaur for lifting up stories of Balbir Singh Sodhi &amp; others hurt by hate #Remember915 https://t.co/XEU6UOmbGF
Read more testimonies of those affected from our friends @colorlines: https://t.co/Z8HGTgJdQ2 #Remember915
"Immigration is a political buzzword that simplifies a human issue." -S. Orozco, TX #Remember915 https://t.co/v280HGcXhI
"Immigration is an act of survival. We are refugees of the global economy."	-Jorge Luis Ramos, NC: https://t.co/cqOisfGDp8 #Remember915
#Islamophobia is driving our nation's foreign policy, embedded in war profiteering.  -J. Shearson, OH https://t.co/lTUOwntvGZ #Remember915
“Living in U.S. as a Syrian refugee, I feel that my value as a human is worthless.” -L. Midani, OH. #Remember915 https://t.co/Ei2K5lZxqU
"I am full of fear, constantly confronted in an all-consuming hatred of me &amp; my faith." -K. Hadeed, AL https://t.co/x4AHYDrwuZ #Remember915
Our bros. &amp; sis. across the country have testified to the implementation of violence in the street &amp; in our laws post-9/11 at #MoralRevival
They divide &amp; distract us from truth by limiting moral discussion to where you stand on praying in school. #Remember915
They use fear to promote regressive policies targeting communities of color - AZ’s #SB1070; NC’s #VoterID law; &amp; too many more. #Remember915
Extremists use fear to incarcerate, detain &amp; kill black, brown &amp; poor white people in our criminal injustice system. #Remember915
Extreme politicians use fear to undermine #ReligiousLiberty when the face of faith is not white &amp; Christian. #Remember915
Like 1963 – those with evil in their hearts were given license to attack brown &amp; black, immigrant, Muslim &amp; Sikh communities. #Remember915
Because we had not healed from our heart problem, fear was set loose, fueled by violent language from politicians &amp; pulpits. #Remember915
53 yrs later, we also #Remember915 as day of 1st hate crime post-9/11: Balbir Singh Sodhi, a turbaned Sikh father shot to death in Arizona.
“I remember the anxiety &amp; angst that comes around on this day every year.” -@pastortraci: https://t.co/XDkaYRYvPe #Remember915
Dr. King knew, like God told Ezekiel, that America needed a new heart. #Remember915
Every politician feeding hatred; every preacher sitting on the sidelines; every POC accepting racism; every white person turning their eye.
Something is wrong with America, said Dr. King at the girls’ funeral. You want to know what killed those girls? #Remember915
This elected official’s violent language in the public square emboldened those who had hate in their heart. #Remember915
It started when a governor stood up that year in February 1963 &amp; declared: Segregation yesterday, today &amp; tomorrow. #Remember915
The bomb was so great, it blew the face out of Jesus in the stained glass window. This was evil at its core. #Remember915
Murdered while studying the Sun. School lesson “Love Your Enemy.” This terrorist attack pierced the heart of the nation. #Remember915
We #Remember911, but there’s another remembrance that happens today: 4 little girls blown up in a Birmingham Church in 1963. #Remember915

Pls join us at 11AM in your individual time zone for a #MoralDayofAction and let’s shock this nation with the power of love, justice &amp; mercy
Let us challenge t/theological malpractice of the so-called religious right that attempts to limit the moral discussion in the public square
We need people of moral conscious to join us online to engage your candidates and office holder digitally: https://t.co/j4d6epgOqw
We need clerics of all different faiths and those who have been impacted, to join a local Sept.12 #MoralDayofAction: https://t.co/wuw88GYqLE
We are called to stand for justice. That’s what the Sept. 12 #MoralDayofAction is about. https://t.co/J5tDsFEdxo
We must fight for a living wage in a country where 400 families make over $97,000 an hour while we’re arresting folks who fight for $15
We must protect women’s rights. Where do our candidates and office holders stand? #MoralDayofAction #MoralAgenda https://t.co/hKIcSOYrH1

Poverty is a part of a #MoralAgenda. Where do our candidates and office holders stand? #MoralAgenda https://t.co/T5AfjmWJK6
The deepest public concerns of all our major faith traditions would ask this of those elected:How do your policies treat those on t/margins?
It’s theological malpractice to limit the moral debate to topics like religion in public schools or where you stand on abortion.
The goal of #MoralDayofAction is to directly address the fallacies of the so-called “religious right” who seek to limit the moral debate
We need a real #MoralRevival to save the heart of this democracy at this particular time. #MoralDayofAction
We call on religious leaders to preach &amp; teach at least 2 weekends prior to election about t/moral issues of our time #MoralDayofAction
We will call on people of conscious to go to t/polls in November &amp; beyond &amp; never sit out another election #MoralRevival #MoralDayofAction

Faith pushes us past acceptance of discrimination.
What if MLK had accepted civil rights and not fought for voting rights?
What if Rosa Parks had lived small and accepted injustice?
Public pools were closed to keep black folks out, but @simone_manuel showed us there are some things we can't accept.
When God created the world, God didn't say, "Let me," but "Let us..." We don't do anything on our own.

If minimum wage tracked with inflation. It would be over $20/hr.
64 million working Americans don't make 15/hr. Most of them are white.
It took us 400 yrs to go from 0 to 7.25. We can't wait any longer for 15!
