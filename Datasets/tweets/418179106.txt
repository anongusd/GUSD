@mycatkodak Everyone puts their money off shore to pay taxes ...right...look up federal investigation Romney justice department. :-)
@mycatkodak oh yeah one other thing Romney is consistent on..TAX EVASION. Oh &amp; let's not forget he's under investigation 4 Federal Crime
@mycatkodak he may flip flop however it isn't a daily event as Romney's positions are. only thing Romney is consistent on is screwing ppl
Romney under investigation its a FELONEY http://t.co/myGBiyEV
@GOP so basically you bitching about he's not cleaning up your mess fast enough
@mycatkodak Romney is Bush on steroids
@mycatkodak no just his mess that will be around for many more years to come. Romney wants the same failed policies
@mycatkodak he has been weight and measure and falls very short( Romney) I will be fine if he gets office you will get what you deserve
@mycatkodak Romney's Governor king bout is proof of incompetency complete daily flip flopping also proof
@mycatkodak incompotent is Romney's middle name. His visit with allies proved that.
@mycatkodak oh when you said losing sleaze bag I was sure you were talking about the person of 533 lies in 30 days and counting
@mycatkodak so no need to tell me who's laughing. I have seen and heard who's laughing first hand.
@mycatkodak do you know how embarrassing that was? Romney now wants to double &amp; triple down on shit that doesn't work 4 the past 40 yrs
@mycatkodak when overseas I found myself apologizing 4 Bush. &amp; even a few in Russia wished me well to get a president with a brain
@mycatkodak that's different how. They were rolling on the floor with laughter when GW was in office along with the rest of the world
@mycatkodak so far yes. GOP are just pissed off he has cleaned up their mess fast enough. 30 Mo. Of jobs added 4 B.O. 750,000 lost Mo. 4 GWB
@mycatkodak a war would assist getting rid of the moochers he dispises the people living on welfare like SS SSI the working poor............
@mycatkodak Romney is so inept he could screw up a wet dream. He would make enemies out of allies. And be proud to start a war
@mycatkodak also as far as Benghazi facts are still surfacing.  Romney screwed up visits with allies. Imagine the damage with others
@mycatkodak in 30 days Romney spewed out 533 lies. And still going....
@mycatkodak Romney can't open his mouth without a lie coming out. Nor can Ryan. And even on issues there is no need to lie but do it
@mycatkodak republicans have also lied about wats they start. They lied about the countries we invaded the lies are stacked up greatly
@mycatkodak and republicans won't be happy until we've started the third world war.
RT @TPM: Obama’s ruse to box Mitt Romney on taxes http://t.co/egTfwmRy
@mycatkodak you should read Ryan's budget plan the one Romney backs 200% and read the Ryan Akin co written sanctity of life bill. Very Bad
@mycatkodak It makes me sick to vote Democrat I have never voted that way in my life. The alternative would tank the economy &amp; bad 4 people
@mycatkodak try checking facts for yourself fact checkers depending on who they are for skew the facts. I trust none of them.
@mycatkodak Ryan sign on the dotted line in 2008 before Obama took office.
@mycatkodak example of mostly true. Ryan: Obama was the cause of car factory closing in Wisconsin. Total false
@mycatkodak fact check a lot of times will take a flat out lie from the right and call it mostly true. I know I have fact checked them
The only candidate that ran for GOP nomination that had sense was Huntsman. But GOP tea party didn't like him due to lack of stupidity

@mycatkodak the plan is to take the remain 7% of the cash the other 97% of the people have. That's awesome. I could use some extra cash.
@TFinn82 oh I'm sorry hunny it took too long for you to get it. I'll provide a ladder next time
@mycatkodak he isn't my hero as evil is yours. I didn't vote for him not once. He isn't the party of screw your fellow man as GOP are
Its a good thing R&amp;R stated they're christian. Judging by the budget plan I would have never guessed
@mycatkodak I have heard all the fear mongering I care to from GOP. I have RSS the budget plan Romney is behind d it 110%! Its the plan
@mycatkodak how do you know? GOP tell you that? How much did Fox pay him to say it? I have an evil sister I would never help.

@mycatkodak the new GOP want people like you,single moms,working poor, middle class to find a corner to die in that leaves the 7%$ 4 rich
@mycatkodak hers a few thing that will be gone: SS., SSI,Medicare/ medicaide, food stamps,fair wages, in other words GOP could care less
@mycatkodak better start retraining for something you can do. The program you are living on. Gone. Did you miss that in the budget plan?

@mycatkodak &amp; count on your whole family staying there. Education even k-12 will be unaffordable to you as soon as everything is privatized
@mycatkodak WOW my party really has taken some major stupid pills. No wonder your poor
@mycatkodak I'll get what I really don't deserve but I'll take it. Thanks for paying more taxes so I won't have to pay any:-)
@mycatkodak glad you've been paying attention to the fox propaganda.  If you vote against your best interest you'll get what you deserve
@mycatkodak if you are poor and buying into that bullshit and Romney is elected..you'll get what you deserve title desolation
@mycatkodak oh that's right in china India and other slave labor countries.
@mycatkodak I can afford it. As can the 1%. If the trickle down is so great when will it start to go your way down where are the jobs
@mycatkodak I don't take kindly to tax evading as the 1% do I pay my taxes. I don't mind my taxes being increased to support my country.
@mycatkodak  I don't believe poor and middle class should have higher taxes to pay for tax cuts for those who don't need it.
@mycatkodak how is it class warfare? I am all for profit.I do own a business. I am however not an idiot. I put country above all else
@mycatkodak  I do I have looked up the government web page and found that the tea party puts politics and 1% lobbyist Grover above country
@mycatkodak yeah the senate doesn't want poor and middle class to get screwed even harder without so much as a kiss
@mycatkodak I didn't leave my party. My party left me then started smoking a shit load of crack. Put the pipe down and back away slowly
@mycatkodak Did no one ever tell not to use the drugs you're selling. Get off the tea party crack.
@mycatkodak You should get off Fox network and watch the crap come straight out of crazy tea party mouths on cspan.
@mycatkodak I'm not liberal I'm just not nuts as in insane radical right wing tea party crazy bastard
@mycatkodak funny thing is I voted for McCain inspire of Sara Palin yeah that makes me liberal. LOL. Bush is liberal too then.
@mycatkodak thanks to GOP house of representative s driving the nation off the cliff.
R.wing standard now put every conservative prior to 2 yrs ago makes them liberal. Including Bush if you can believe that. The party of crazy
It has become clear the the radicals of the right automatically assume you are a left wing liberal when you disagree with their crazy ideas
@dmcrane It should be funny. Will they fact check as he goes? How many lies can he squeeze into one debate
@mycatkodak  that channel is pure fact you can watch and listen to the bull spewing from the mouths of inadequate GOP tea party
@mycatkodak cspan if you don't know is congress in lack of action mainly the house of representatives. They vote against ideas they had
@mycatkodak actually I don't watch news on TV. I look up my own information. You then have Fox talking points. I do however watch cspan
@mycatkodak GOP blew through 8 trillion revenue then added 30 yrs of growing deficits. &amp; that's the policies Romney wants to dbl. down on
@mycatkodak Romney's brilliant idea was let everything fail deregulate more to totally screw Americans and export more jobs @ slave labor $
@mycatkodak if Obama not put a floor under the 800,000 job loss each.Mo. plus added jobs for 30 straight Mo. Think where we would be.
@mycatkodak If you look at facts we are still paying 4, 2 unpaid wars, bush tax cuts and a prescription plan unpaid for via curtisy of GOP.
@mycatkodak Romney prefers not to think before speaking he likes to be just as surprised as everyone else. :-) Just look at his oversea trip
@mycatkodak what you just described sounds just like a mild version of Romney then put it to the tenth power and there you have Romney
This is what I'm talking about.:-)  women will appreciate this.:-) http://t.co/lhFnk6me
@mycatkodak I think you are caught in the GOP bubble if you say it enough that makes it true...NOT.  only in your own mind
@mycatkodak yeah it would be so much better to have chief job exporter and tax evader as potus master of tank the economy for personal gain
@mycatkodak why after exposure would they give an oil contract to an invading country? Just happy morals and ethics are in office now
@mycatkodak Romney sees china as great opportunity to further deregulate to export more jobs at slave labor prices to increase profit
@mycatkodak Mr Romney is a very weak person lead around by the nose can you imagine the negative ramifications if he is in office 9/11X10
@mycatkodak and we all know we didn't invade two other countries during bush yrs 4 WOMD he wanted the oil

Newt has no answer for Romney not talking about his budget plan. What a surprise
@EzKool well of course how else would they( GOP) have a chance in hell of winning without cheating. They couldn't win without cheating.
Iowa judge put a stay on voter purging law in Iowa until after the election. :-). Then the law will be looked at and judged.
What a surprise GOP are getting behind Akin again because he proved stronger than the party. Can we say pussies .....
Did you hear about the new GOP book that's out? 50 shades of old redneck uneducated wealthy white trail or trash Evangelical hicks
@fivethirtyeight Gee with all the voter suppression laws put I to place in several states... may I say DUH.....let's state the obvious
Republicans know they can't win fairly so they are suppressing votes with pole taxes. Help Obama get over 60% he needs it. Its a fixed race
Obama needs Republican votes independent votes as well as Democratic and well over 60% support margin to balance the suppressed votes
With all the voter suppression laws Obama needs to get over 60%  support to cover the votes he won't get due to state laws
Support of Obama doesn't mean anything unless disenfranchised voters can some how adhere to stick voting laws. Those laws need over turned

@Spitfire1592 the Templar knights Catholic... look what they did under the control of the catholic church
@Spitfire1592 throughout history several different religions have done very bad things in the name of god
@Anabell_Martin and thank you for making my point. All religions count and do have different paths. That's why your beliefs do not fit all
@Anabell_Martin the roman religion is and was roman catholic. Thus the term roman catholic
@Anabell_Martin these tweet were coming to me I don't see tweet from others
@Anabell_Martin using what you said Catholic is the only one that is true..Jesus was not catholic and stood against them when on earth
@Anabell_Martin Jehovah's witnesses think they are the only true religion and only they will go to heaven. As do other religions...
@Anabell_Martin so what about Romney who receives his doctrine from a hat? Literally!
@Anabell_Martin according to who? Catholics? So according to you even Jesus is damned he was a Jew
@daryltriplett some religions do not practice the new testament they do not acknowledged it
@Spitfire1592 so I reiterate which religion should we ALL practice? Which ate right? Who says what our beliefs should be? YOU?
@Spitfire1592 for example I know of one religion that believes Jesus was a prophet only and not the son of god.
@Spitfire1592 again not all religions believe the way you do. Just saying.....
@daryltriplett examples
@daryltriplett explain the flood. The pilers of salt and other exames
@daryltriplett so again which one is the right one? Which are wrong? Because I am not God who am I to make that decision? Who am I to judge?
@Anabell_Martin I may or may not agree with others beliefs &amp; try to respect them I have not walked a mile in their shoes and judge them not
@daryltriplett that's the beauty of all religious beliefs being protected in the constitution all have their own
@daryltriplett again your belief system. Gets was different. And mine will be practiced in my house. I personally wouldn't have one.
@Anabell_Martin what does it matter what religion I practice? I am not forcing mine down anyone's throat. Nor my beliefs.
@daryltriplett I have. And through a friend experienced it. And it was paused for out of her pocket. Didn't agree with it but her choice
@daryltriplett and that is how it has Only Only Only been and will be
@daryltriplett but at the same time refuse to make others believe as I do. That is a personal choice protected by the constitution
@daryltriplett again if you believe in a certain doctrine does not mean all hold those same beliefs. Not saying I hold a different belief
@daryltriplett though I didn't agree with her choice. It was her choice. And she did pay out of pocket to have it. Gov. Funds did not pay
@daryltriplett almost 10 yrs ago I knew someone that went planned parenthood to get an abortion. They paid out of pocket for that proceedure
@daryltriplett so Are you saying it better to let both die? Like a friend I had with a tubal pregnancy
@daryltriplett it has never paid for abortion!  only time gov. funds has been used in those cases have been when the mothers life is in dan
@Anabell_Martin I am looking at this from a multi cultural background with multi religious background. I C them as all being right &amp; wrong 2
@Anabell_Martin I am sincerely happy you told me that! I would not have guest. I was under the impression your belief was the only correct 1
@Anabell_Martin good for you I am proud of you. I wish all people would do the same.
@daryltriplett I am saying because you believe a certain thing does not give you the fight to force others to live your belief &amp; vice versa
@aslkim my mother was Jewish my father a combination of native American beliefs and catholic beliefs. Who is right? Know it all.

@Anabell_Martin people tend yo be selfish creatures. Charitable people are far and few between.
@aslkim that is why religion has no business being in government all beliefs are protected in the constitution. ALL religions ALL beliefs
@aslkim you believe life starts at conception. Others believe otherwise. Some at first breath. Some when movement felt some at birth........
@aslkim but guess what. He has a right to believe as he will. Via the constitution all right protected by our government
@aslkim tell Romney he is wrong because they got their bible littetally out of a hat from their prophet
@aslkim I deny one religious voice to control different doctrines of different faiths.I believe all are worthy not just one
@daryltriplett that's the beauty of the constitution. Freedom of religion. All religions. Just not the one you follow.
@daryltriplett I am just saying right to religious beliefs keep those to self and not ram your beliefs down others throats.
@ALittleWrath if you read R and R plan that is what that means
@daryltriplett I think if you personally don't believe in that I suggest you choose not to do it.
@ALittleWrath another one let's get rid of min. wage laws and put in place right to work. So everyone can enjoy working for less income
@ALittleWrath  We do as a people or group that which we cannot do alone.
@ALittleWrath if you hadn't guest yes I am being silly because I think its silly to eliminate those laws to protect we the people.
@ALittleWrath oh here's on let's also get rid of child labor laws. And let's start pole taxing again.
@ALittleWrath or let's get rid of FDA altogether yeah that would be a good idea. everyone should have a right to take poison in antibiotics
@ALittleWrath How about women's rights. Would you eliminate that? Let's get rid of seatbelt laws. How about that
@ALittleWrath and what part would you personally limit? I like not having a 5 yr.old enter the work force. What law elimination?

@ALittleWrath I also quite enjoy that when I take out a loan banks are not allowed to act like loan sharks anymore.
@ALittleWrath and how will you alone go to each place to make sure they are not putting lead in a toy your child plays with?
@ALittleWrath you ate responsible for yourself. I take comfort in knowing that when I buy a steak it has been taken care of properly
@ALittleWrath those are a few examples of what big government does. Small government is the issue. They put am. Gov. In every aspect of life
@ALittleWrath not sure about you but I like buying safe toys for my grandchildren. And not having lead in my paint. And safe work conditions
@ALittleWrath what about monopoly s not sure about you but I enjoy not being price gauged just because they can
@ALittleWrath so what you ate telling me is less drug and food regulations will be good. I know I am not found of food poisoning
@ALittleWrath My point disagree but be respectful of others beliefs and choices.
@ALittleWrath others core value beliefs trampled on because the don't match a single belief. None are right yet all are right.
@ALittleWrath To see so much hate directed towards women as if they mean nothing but property to a man. Other religions disrespected........
@ALittleWrath it really breaks my heart to see so much hate being spread around due to one issue voters. And garbage from r.wing mouths
@ALittleWrath my equivalent is the whole picture not a peace here and there. That is GOP role pick an issue and run with that one
@Anabell_Martin and that in full context refer to feed I g poor and helping those in need
@Sonofhaig in most religions with the exception of modern religion Jesus was coincide red a radical liberal. How dare he stand up for poor P
@Sonofhaig thus the comment regarding tolerance. Or does the one you or savvy read the only one that counts
@Sonofhaig religion is just one excuse to treat others badly. So which religion is right? Which bible is right? Each religion has their own
@aslkim the bible has been translated and rewritten thousands of times. Books have been left out. A king chose which books would be allowed
@daryltriplett I  compairing all to one another just not single issues. Then again I am not a so gale issue voter
@ALittleWrath tolerance has nothing g to do with racism unless that is where you place it . It does however reflects others belief system
@jmcosentino those people were all killed in the name of god and religious beliefs. Unfortunate. Now we have a hate video making thing worse
@Barbie4Mitt I will not argue on that note and I do take petty on you and those who follow evil. "GOP" doing all the can to eradicate poor
@daryltriplett I would call suppression a hate crime.  Human Rights. And freedom.
@ALittleWrath U are the one that brought race into the conversation not I. Just letting you know you were and are barking up the wrong tree
@thesavvy did you miss the part where he said father who art in heaven........
@taotao_salupa his grace and death is what it will take to so many conservatives into heaven. Such hate based party.
@FargoMan12 when I get up to see him I'll send one down to you
@jmcosentino and how many people killed and wars started in The Name Of God
@ALittleWrath funny you mention racism a true conservative mark. And not to mention I am mixed race my husband is black.
@thesavvy not sure what bible you're ready but in mind Jesus calls hod his father that would make Jesus the son of god
@thesavvy one thing I did learn before changing parties conservatives are of the people not tolerating anything other than spans of hatred
@taotao_salupa you mean like religious radical conservatives are now. And that's why liberal Jesus had to save them ans the sane people
@druggedparrot91 in those days you weren't considered pregnant until the woman felt life move. That would be around 4 months
@VCSP8 awesome go given hell
@thesavvy also did you notice he didn't pick fights and start wars every place he went he died to save the conservative morons
@thesavvy I know what the bible says and I know what he did I also know what he was in the time he was doing it. He was and is a liberal
@thesavvy in fact Jesus was considered to be a radical very anti conservative against slavery against suppression
@thesavvy that sounds pretty liberal to me and put to death because of conservative single self mindedness among other unsavoury attributes
@thesavvy Well he did feed the poor, helped the needy,he healed the sick on the Sabbath day,he turned over tables of money changers @ temple
@derajmnosnhoj Romney helped by shipping thousands of jobs overseas as did his billionaire buddies not to mention Bush
@KARLewis you forgot to mention GOP using 10 most evil methods as did Nazis as did north Korea china and other controlled countries

Don't you just hate when you get a new razor out and still get razor burn. I would think the new one would be better than the one I replaced
@texasrighty not redefining looking at things objectively. With an open mind. more people were not be so narrow minded for real discussions
@texasrighty so should I then believe that as well? Or would it be better to look at it in its entirety. As I do with all else
@texasrighty just like far left is toting the " families" remark made by Mitt. The clip implies he has multiple families as poligamist
@texasrighty see not dee
@texasrighty so what you are saying is you are not willing to dee the whole picture. Unwilling to challenge yourself to seek the All truth
This is what gop is about voter suppression.  http://t.co/5uFrTCyn
@texasrighty I also watch cspan both house and Senate channels. So I can hear first hand the crap coming from everyone's mouth
@texasrighty the left has done the same thing however I at least take the added time to view and review the entire context
@texasrighty I looked at you hard right site. Then looked at full speeches I date all of you to do the same. In full context.
@texasrighty as I said so I should then stop also listening to fox and cnn
I had hard right singers give me a site that supposedly listed apologies by Obama. Now I date all of them to look up full speech of each
@jwbrown43 so.. I shouldn't listen to your news sources I listen to all of them its easier to keep an open mind if you listen to both sides
@elbowpickle you are welcome. It is clipped for right wing agendas
@goright I watch all the news channels to see just how fat out of touch everyone is. So fax fox has the others beat hands down
@unjadedyet @thesavvy I would agree some ate too fat gone with extreme radical agenda s. Think middle where most of the population live.:-)

@thesavvy and not once at the convention was any mention or thanks to our troops currant their or that had been there. Did hear Russia/china
@Misty_K_RN and the left have also made clips far worse than those clips. Kinda why I disagree with the far of both sides. I look to facts
@Misty_K_RN and Google Romney Ryan lies you'll find plenty of those too. Also Google the economic plan. That is a tell tail of belief system
@Biglefthander now that sounds like a Romney statement. To whom also sounds like he wants to start a war with china and russia
@davidjacksmith I haven't made up my mind as to who to vote for yet. It sickens me when FAR right &amp; Far left push the ridiculous.
@OscarGaldona try looking at the r.wing  agenda far worse than anything r.wing could give. The savvy r.wing is disgraceful
@OscarGaldona too bad he isn't a Muslim. As far as I can trace back not once has Obama attended a Muslim church. Only Christian.
@thesavvy he didn't apologize for America! He did say what happened was unfortunate but given currant situation was unavoidable.
@thesavvy I have not once heard Obama apologize for America or for anything. listen to something other than Rush and fox news
@RsForObama I hope this time rush is correct. This republican party is completely out of touch with what the rest of us call reality.
@fullofbalogna good pic to go with the comment :-)
@sjcarl the planned return yrs. I meant the last 8 he's been running for office for many years. So he has had to have some what fixed those
Tea party people expect we the people to build our own coffins and elect Ryan Romney.
So when do get to see Romneys taxes. I think the devil is in the detail. How many devils and demons are in them
What do you think will happen? Who gets hurt? Not the top working poor and middle class those deductions are the few we have.
Romney tax plan: cut mortgage dection. cut charitable deduction. State and local tax deductions. In order to drop taxes at the top tax rate.

@Faith4Politics create
@Faith4Politics are you against bringing jobs back to the united states and for business to invest in their business to crest more jobs
@Faith4Politics there is even tax breaks in there for big corp. that bring jobs back to our shores &amp; our land from foreign soil.
@Faith4Politics so why not get rid of job exporter tax relief and loopholes and give it to real job creators. The people here in the US
@Faith4Politics corporation get that and a whole lot more tax breaks that really don't need. The only jobs they crest are overseas
@Faith4Politics and with that bill what I put back into my business and the people I hire will have better tax relief and deductions.
@Faith4Politics actually you need revenue to pay down debt. It ha been proven higher taxes generates jobs. Businesses put $ into business
@Faith4Politics the tax increase as you say is Less in taxes than if the tax break expires. And it increases on 250 and up.
@Faith4Politics I am a small business owner. It would be nice to have someone look out for like they look out for those already there

@david_daver1012 then we will be just like China and north Korea . Super rich and powerful and very poor with no voice. Just what GOP want
@Waltzman sure there is. Free labor through privatized prisons. They tank the economy kill mid.class that creates more crime to fill prisons
@david_daver1012 and create a new labor force through privatized prisons. Free labor. killing mid. class forces desperation to fill prisons

Romney Ryan lie. The factory that closed did so before Obama took office. It happened during Bush admin. With ryan voting for the close :-)
LMAO...Ryan told another huge LIE! Stating Obama of saying " if gov. is involved this factory will be open 100 yrs" before he took office.
@openmikeusa who doesn't resort to desperate measure will have no health coverage. So poor will die of illness and disease.
@Kimber_Hamm middle class wiped out they ate now poor. Resort to desperate measures end up in prison more free labor.
@openmikeusa privatized prisons! Force poor to desperate measures steeling to survive. They go to prison. Free labor. Wipe out middle class
@openmikeusa no I don't. What I have issue with is the way the 1% is attempting g to eliminate middle class. Ans exterminate the poor/ women
@InaMaziarcz the top 1% have been going after middle class for over 30 yrs. They have been tearing apart the 3 major pillars that held USA
@InaMaziarcz That's why education retirement funds S.S. is under attack stripping away personal rights human rights and owning women &amp; kids
@InaMaziarcz Exactly!!!!
@InaMaziarcz then middle class force into poverty and BAM more free labor.  those that refuse to go that road can starve or die of disease
@InaMaziarcz not to mention that if there plan succeeds. Poor are forced to steel to survive, put in privatized prisons and BAM free labor.
Oops ownership
@InaMaziarcz or possible too many Catholic boy tapers and Evangelical rapist. If you own women it can't be rape.same with children iwnership
@InaMaziarcz maybe its due to, too much Mormon inbreeding.
Another reason Mitt could have been in a basement with tuna. Hiding from going to war until his dad could ship him over sea to avoid going
@Reince or you can pit out a statement as to Mitts other wives and the reason of not releasing tax returns are to hide them
Mitt growing up in wealth the only reason I can think he would hide in a basement with tuna is hiding under age wives so he would get caught
Several other wives might be what Mitt needs to hide on his tax returns from tax seasons past. That's why he hid in a basement with tuna.
@RsForObama possibly from hiding out with the other wives till he figured out what to do with them. Just to make sure he wouldn't get caught

And by the way Romney where are your taxes? Should have been ready you've been running for office for 8yrs. Had plenty of time to fix them
Not to mention making women second class citizens and property of men again. With no rights no control over themselves or their bodies
If we judge by past. Romney will close factories, ship jobs abroad, steel our retirement SS , profit from it then put money stolen off shore
If we hold Romney to his accomplishments if he becomes president our jobs will be shipped over seas he will take S.S. retirement fund 4 prof

Ryan Romney and Akin believe in women's rights. They have the right to be the property of a man, and what to fix for dinner. Unless told.
Republicans believe small/ little government. Meaning a little bit in every aspect of your life &amp; a small amount to control the way you live

@KarlRove thanks to you butt heads putting trillions on credit we will be paying for 4 several generations. Unpaid war(s) welfare 4 wealthy.
@cfreelakers24 in the bill the wording is " Forced Rape" same thing as saying legitimate rape. Its a clarification to ban all abortion
@cfreelakers24 back rooms? It is in the bill Ryan cosponsored and every republican voted in favor of
Rapists grab the 1st house republican/ senate member drug them have anal sex with them. Its not rape it wasn't forced &amp; not legitimate.:-)
Legitimate rape/ forced rape!!  WTF have You the GOP members lost your damn minds? I hope all of U get drugged and get anal sex 4 he's.
@david_daver1012 they've tied themselves to Akin and it. Ryan cosponsoring the bill. Then Romney with signing the person hood agreement. Yep
If I go out &amp; someone slips me a rape drug because it wasn't a forced rape that makes it illegitimate so if  pregnant I am forced keep it
Akin only said out loud what the republican party is doing or trying to do
@oreillyfactor so maybe you shouldn't give Michelle Obama so much crap about pushing healthy food.:-)  its in everyone's best interest
Paul Ryan has the same beliefs as Akin. They cosponsored the bill defining rape. Making 99% of birth control illegal. It was said outloud
@MeratFred I bet that will be a parcisl return also
@edshow Ryan has the same beliefs! and cosponsored a bill with Akin saying exactly what Akin said outloud. should all GOP resign that signed
They are calling for Akin to resign....what about Ryan and the others with that same belief. The people that signed that bill
Rape is Rape. No means No. I would not have a child out of rape. I would take a morning after pill. No mans business what a woman chooses
Romney said he would be happy to sign that bill to ban ALL abortion.
Rape when women are drugged or minor at 12,13 or 14 having sex with older man NOT considered rape. Ryan and Akin put that bill on the table.
Ryan cosponsoring a bill that qualifies rape and pregnancies out of a non qualified rape you can not abort or take a morning after pill
We have a choice at the poles this year. On one hand you get knuckle dragging women haters and hate all not rich or someone that cares Obama
Which makes them in line Ryan and Akin, with Romney s beliefs. So we know he is a woman hater and a hater of the poor. Shame on you Ryan

Like republicans like to say if you repeat the truth enough eventually things start to sink in. But truth generally takes less repeating
Obama with his savings from prescriptions and unnecessary procedures gave back to seniors for free healthcare such as screenings
Obama did stop for profit doctors &amp; hospitals from over charging and ordering unnecessary tests saving seniors  thousands per year
Obama did stop pharmaceutical companies from further over charging of medication to seniors. They will save thousands per year
Fact: obama cut $716 t from Medicare over spending by saving seniors $ on prescription cost., saving $ on doctor bills,&amp; free screening no $

I have been looking for rational explanations why GOP hate Obama. I found 2; He's a black man and wealthy people don't want to pay taxes
Republicans are all about constitutional rights unless they work against what GOP wants then lie cheat and steel to change those laws

@edshow Romney's taxes are his Pandora's Box and he knows it. That's why he will never release them. All types of I'll gotten gains.

@jagdan2  Typical right wing hate group mentality
@jagdan2 poor lost racist right wing tea party nut case.
@jagdan2 sorry honey white Republican and my kids read it for themselves. Also not racist.
@jagdan2 you can do that now
@jagdan2 find any excuse and stick with it. I didn't vote for him. But sure the hell will this time. My reason wasn't because of skin color
@jagdan2 wish everyone would just be honest. You don't like anything Obama does or tries to do because he is a black man. A black president
@jagdan2 ryan Romney coverage off you want to call it that.very slightly less cost premium less coverage much height health cost
@jagdan2 Romney Obama plan gives better coverage with more option at less cost on premiums and cost of care.
@jagdan2 or keep what you have...your choice
@jagdan2 so purchase some like everyone else of your choice as stated in the bill
@jagdan2 any rand. Only the rich survive everyone else falls to the bottom. Ryan's other worshipped mother
@jagdan2 middla class welcome to being poor your the next to die. And Romney Ryan made that choice for us
@jagdan2 Romney Ryan are the two offering a true death panel. Poor people get nothing just go away and die.
@jagdan2 headed to another place where I will not get reception I will hit you up when out of there
@jagdan2 I feel for you as misguided as you are trying to limit others rights and options because of differences in beliefs
@jagdan2 I am all in favor of supporting options. All for exercising my rights
@jagdan2 if you actually read it as you say you did you would know that..that is also an option.
@jagdan2 didn't even mention who I want it with. Only requirement.you just need to have it. Just like car insurance
@jagdan2 that's the beauty of this system. I get to choose what I want and how I want it. at a good cost
@jagdan2 I was just thinking the same thing about you. Tea Party is so...out of touch with reality. I tend to be a realist in the real world

@jagdan2 so..in accordance to your belief system hospice should be outlawed too...also another method of choosing how to die that's paid for
@jagdan2 yeah...I choose how I die....not you.not a doctor.not some wayside religious fanatic. No one but me....
@jagdan2 I already have one in place
@jagdan2 after watching my mother suffer while dying I wish she would have made a living will.
@jagdan2 I worked in nursing for along time. Living wills are and have been common for a very long time
@jagdan2 oh I forgot tea party calls it a death panel to plan ahead. People make living wills anyway. They are just paying for it
@jagdan2 don't see an issue with that. Unless you fail to see the benefit from someone dying too have one less expence
@jagdan2 lost reception no need to the health care plan will now pay for living wills and consultations for that
@jagdan2 here is a not so known fact. My mom Jewish my dad Catholic me baptised Catholic so religion I am all for religious beliefs
@jagdan2 or are you only with them when it benefits you...just like the other hop hypocrites
@jagdan2 as far as that goes are you then with the Catholic church when it comes to the ryan budget plan?
@jagdan2 as I said if that's what they want they should stick to hiring nuns and only treat their own, stop asking for and taking gov. money
@jagdan2 if they want medical insurance to cover birth control then they should  have it
@jagdan2 they should not force their beliefs down public's throat like hired Muslim hired Jehovah witness hired atheist
@jagdan2 use your brain. If they want fed and state money..they can play by the same rules. If not don't take any money from government
@jagdan2 perfect example of why religion and state needs to be kept separated too many religions
@jagdan2 I'm saying I don't care what religion anyone practices. Just don't try to shove yours down others throats.
@jagdan2 otherwise they can shut the hell up and play by the same rules as other government assisted businesses
@jagdan2 using business sense if they want to play to their own tune they should stop taking federal money and state money &amp; hire only nuns
@jagdan2 just in premium price and dropped healthcare costs as well. Romney should be proud of that
@jagdan2 the two makers of Romney care stated yesterday CNN and NBC that the same healthcare is Obama's and it has cut costs by 50%
@jagdan2 so its okay for you to force your religious beliefs down others throats as long as you get what you want
@jagdan2 who the hell cares what religion someone practices. So what you are saying is you want to control what religions people practice
@jagdan2 and what of the hop economists that say ryan budget will put the USA into a total economic disaster his philosophy proven disaster
@jagdan2 so yes I stand by that......
@jagdan2 their...not thirty. Auto correct got me
@jagdan2 and I think if they want thirty own rules they shouldn't take government money like they do right now!
@jagdan2 has nothing to with constitution it has to do with business. Wanna be a business act like one.
@jagdan2 if they want to play by a private rule they need to only hire within their own. And practice on just their own. And I am Catholic
@jagdan2 I think if they want to operate a public hospital and hire public people they need to operate under the same rules as everyone else
@jagdan2 gotta go headed into business meeting
@jagdan2 we will continue paying for those policies ryan voted for for the next 20 plus years and more
@jagdan2 proven fact: Obama has spent less than any president in our nation history. Fact still paying for unpaid for Bush policies
@jagdan2 if you truly did read it. I think you would feel differently. Ryan budget adds trillions to the deficit nothing paid for.
@jagdan2 I dare you to read both plans then come back to discuss this
@Kimber_Hamm Ryan's plan is exactly this save $1.00 spend $8.00 plus on  healthcare. Due to allowing providers to charge what they want
@Kimber_Hamm and something other than outlawing birth control 70 times please
@jagdan2 maybe if tea partiers took their thumbs out of their butts and voted on something other than what is in best interest if wealthy
@jagdan2 and he is saving seniors more money. They are getting it back times ten. Lower expenditures lower prescription cost lower premium
@jagdan2 he is closing gaps that allows all providers from taking at vantage of seniors
@jagdan2 stopped much price gauging set up by Bush days when they had vested interest in profiting from the excess charges.
@jagdan2 he didn't take anything he gave it back by giving FREE screenings less out of pocket for meds less out of pocket for premiums....
@jagdan2 I can't wait either Ryan will have egg on his face when exposed

@jagdan2 I was just laughing and sharing my amusement with the auto correct feature. The baby in shower was a funny auto correct
@jagdan2 the little auto correct. Dens instead Dems
That auto correct isn't as bad as the one I sent, " I'm going shopping for a lesbian baby in a shower"  that was embarrassing
Dems ...auto correct

@jagdan2 sorry I can't agree. It is allowing me to hire. And provide insurance I have a small family owned company
@jagdan2 I hear that on auto correct...lol I sent a doosy once before I realized I had been corrected
@jagdan2 if a Republican has a vested interest in ins. Companies I am sure they will try to get rid of it
@jagdan2 imajinw the savings due to many of the prevention in place over time saves trillions
@jagdan2 it took me three months to get through the healthcare plan. I stand with it and for it as a small business owner it helps
@jagdan2 the mandates are directed at price gauging from healthcare providers pharmaceutical companies etc...protects me from free loaders
@jagdan2 Kimber if you will please
@jagdan2 what will hurt our middle class poor not to mention the entire country is the ryan plan.
@jagdan2 its not a talking point its a fact. You are on poor talking points and untrue talking points at that.
@jagdan2 he is actually stopping price gauging
@jagdan2 so its a good thing private insurance companies are the carriers of Obama care. not the government
@jagdan2 do what you can to who you can just to win and make slaves of poor and middle class
@jagdan2 do you mean like the way Republicans are suppressing votes. Like that
@jagdan2 taking rights away from women with birth control . Stupid. Let's take limp penis pills from old withered men

No one wins with Ryan budget except for the wealthy. Middle class kiss that good by start looking for a good box to sleep in
Ryan budget tested by top economists. Their conclusion more debt. More poor. No middle class. Elderly suffering more than thought possible
@EPTXPolitics No actually he has gotten rid of a lit of the gauging policies the Bush admin. Put into place  because they profited from it.

@LBrand39  I own a cleaning business, what a coincidence
@edshow GOP doesn't help they do what they can to reinforce lies to help their own position they have too its all they've got.

Catholics/religious rights people/GOP This is the 21st century, not the dark ages. Women don't need to be barefoot/pregnant/and stay at home
@shananigins15 If GOP keeps attempting to to put in place women killing rules/law with personhood /other, yes Obama will get re-elected
@PersonhoodFL I am PRO CHOICE, keeping women safe, and holding on to the rights we fought for!

GOP is so far right they forgot they have a left hand. and common sense
@VCSP8 @bigblkdogg Vivian we women with what most people call common sense have your back. I have a few choice names for them.
they should rename GOP to old white men that hates everything and everyone that isn't a white old man
@edshow once again GOP will need to up the aunty on social bull to distract from economy and employment rates
@Lawrence You know...I think I may have been an aspirin baby. They can tell me what I can do, right after their castration.
Since they have a panel of women haters deciding what women have as rights for health care, lets put men haters in charge of men's H-care
Where were are the high moral standards when priests were/are raping children? Tell me I would love to know.
so called christian/GOP community can tell me what I can do, as soon as priest to pope are castrated. & when men pay 100%  for vasectomies
@edshow GOP  your War on women will backfire. Women will vote, Hell's Furry is coming GOP, and women are toting it!

@GOPLeader its a good thing you are wealthy, otherwise you would be considered white jacket  crazy, but you are so you can be crazy thinker
@uschamber @thehill It isn't a tax when you buy it from insurance companies, tax would be government giving it to you then taxed for it.

@KatrinaNation  Women need to stand together to keep GOP from burning us at the stake as they did in Salem, mostly just for being women
@edshow NO infact higher taxes create jobs, when taxes were 40 to 90% they had incentives to put money into job creation for tax deductions
@CoachKJP Soft wouldn't be my style, I would come at them like a lioness. Hell has no furry like a woman scorn
@edshow I think the Wis.Govener cancelled on Obama with the tour @master lock because he was afraid they would throw locks at him...LOL
@edshow dreaming not sue, would be better to let tax breaks expire rather than lowering them from 35 plus percent to 30on the rich.
@JoeNBC no need for dirt, just sit and listen to GOP, that is scary enough. just do sound bites of them talking, that should be enough.

@StevenErtelt How about when priest to pope have castrations they can tell me what to do, and they can stop raping our children,
@StevenErtelt then maybe those churches not take public money for their BUSINESSES
@politics nation I had a tubal ligation & still had to take birth control pills, then depo shots. I had irregular menses, & endreometriosis

@Obama_goes_Newt @nprpolitics @SarahKSilverman @Slate @tnr @nbcsnl @politico  Did they put a stick in his butt
@Senate_GOPs. when Bush took office we had money in the bank. and he spent it like it was nothing, and still spending on his behalf
@shananigins15 they hate the health care act, because its benefits to women, middle class, poor and people of color, not the color of white
@Senate_GOPs What a surprise. Does it have too many benefits to women for GOP ? Or for poor, and middle class,or those other than white's
@SenatorCarper @whitehouse upper middle class taxes need to be included in bill, can't jump start with wealthy money only. I am a democrat.
@Clyburn I am a Democrat, and I can see that. I think all Americans would stand behind it to save the USA as we know it
@Clyburn If Obama really wants to jump start the economy, he will need to raise taxes on upper middle class to just wealthy wont get it done
@SpeakerBoehner @RepPaulRyan Do you mean, he doesn't want to put the country in the poor house, and and wants to keep USA in good standing?
GOP do not force you religious belief system on me, I have my own views
@SpeakerBoehner @bostonherald You are the true social engineering group
@SpeakerBoehner @bostonherald you want our country to fail, you want to weaken it. we the people understand that
GOP in favor of small government, alittle in every part of our lives. They want to get rid of big programs, the ones that protect the people
Gop social enginering attempted practaces will not change our nations health,only everything we do/say(small gov.)

@nprpolitics Where were all the morals when they allowed child rapers to cont. raping children? Beliefs/ Morals, Catholics don't have any
@nprpolitics If they decide they are against child labor laws, will they, (Catholics) be exempt from that rule too? Or Taxes?
@nprpolitics As a bus. owner/Catholic woman, I hope he makes them follow bus. rules just the same as all other bus.'s do.
I was raised Republican, GOP turned me into a Democrat. Now I have to vote for someone I voted against in the last election. TY4 that GOP
CPAC=hooded white figures carrying flaming crosses! & that is the GOP
@nytimes So if Catholics decide they are against child labor laws will they be exempt from those laws too? Or taxes for that matter?
@nytimes Obama is doing nothing to the church or their practices, he wants them as a business to play by business rules
@nytimes I hope not, if Catholics want to own businesses, they need to play by business rules ALL OF THEM
Hello, RICK SANTORUM, hello this is the 21st century, not the middle ages. Women can go outside without permission

@MarkRMatthews to be exempt from this is ridiculous will you also take all other business rules away, like taxes
@MarkRMatthews i did hear what the authority on constitutional rules had to say, it is directed at the business side not the religion side.
@OrrinHatch tell that to the 28 states that already have the same mandates! 8 are no exception ruled, and R  GOP states. R U stuck on stupid
@ktumulty @sullivanamy shouldn't be a controversy, 28 states have mandates like Obama's, 8 of those states have a no exception rule, GOP sta
@MichaelGalvin01 if catholics want to be exempt in the business side, they need to not take fed. and st. money and not hire or treat public
@MichaelGalvin01 Why aren't the child rapers playing by business rules as they do in so many other states already, 28 of them to be exact.

@RNCLatinos if you were smart you would change parties, GOP hates you. GOP hates everyone except old white men.
@SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader I think the blocked your bullshit. A stratagy of webs and snares, to lower pay, and give to the rich. NOT IDIOTS
@SpeakerBoehner the truth, its about ending middle class, eliminating the poor, ending small business, and give all to wealthy
@SpeakerBoehner  about ending the poor, middle class, small businesses, and giving all to the wealthiest.
@TomCoburn And thats why your party is on VAGINA,UTERUS, AND DILDO PATROL ,"YOUR PARTY" not DEM's
@GrahamBlog 28 states already have the same mandate Obama wants to put in place in the rest of states, 8 GOP states have NO exceptions,
@mmcauliff Let me guess, GOP weakened it.They can't have zero inside  trading. looking out for themselves again
@BarackObama Veto all nonsense put forth by GOP, this has nothing to do with religion, its about following business law/rules
@BarackObama Do Not give in to GOP, this is business not religion. If U do they will want to exempt of all bus. laws and rules.
@HELPCommGOP it has nothing to do with the religion side, it has everything to do with the business side.Should all business laws be lifted
@dooley_dooley Why has no one talked about the fact that many GOP states have mandates same as Obama's already in place, 8 with no exceptons
@SpeakerBoehner @MarshaBlackburn @RepReneeEllmers ON THE CRACK PIPE AGAIN? Your state and 27 others already have those same mandates.
@OhioUpdate ARE YOU SMOKING CRACK? YOUR STATE HAS A MANDATE IN PLACE! SAME AS OBAMA!!! GET OFF THE POLITICAL BAN WAGON AND INTO REALITY
@Deanofcomedy I thought the right wing elected official were a hate group.So the other hate groups should feel at home.

@AmericnCatholic I am giving up being a Catholic, Business need to play by business rules, already in place in 28 states.
@JohnBoozman  where all the catholic morals were when priests were raping children, 'I'll have empathy when priest to pope are castrated
@JohnBoozman @karnnewsradio Except for the 28 states that already have that rule, and 8 without exemption.
@chrislhayes you should check out " the last word"on lastnights show, had a good segment on the religion issue. 28 states have that rule
@NBCPolitics Romney is a tool
@SenatorHarkin If religion based business get a different set of rules, women own businesses should all be tax exempt
@SenatorHarkin Mcconnel is coming after you with Ia law of no exemption rule for religion based bussinesses
@McConnellPress so will mcconell go after GOP states that have a no exemption rule like ia. wis. colorado and 25 other states as well .

if catholics get to play by different rules then i think women business owner need to all be tax exempt
am a business owner, since i am a minority should laws in business differ for me as well
this is no different than any other law, how dare GOP to dictate other than self interest.i am catholic, and agree with Obama.
should catholics because they are religious be exempt from other laws, like labor laws, and let them practice as they wish
28 states already have mandated religion based business to follow laws and mandates of the law
Obama is asking less than states like iowa, col. wis. and goergia, who have zero exemption laws
@jonward11 Where were all the morals when child raping priests were protected by the catholics, and moved else where to continue raping
@jonward11 Boehner needs to head to a corner until he can stand for something other than his own self interest. What about what women want?
@Senate_GOPs @SenatorWicker the GOP and religious organizations have blatantly disregarded the rights of women and freedom of choice
@TheOnion do you think the GOP will make the box first or religious organizations
@Senate_GOPs @SenAlexander Religious organizations can dictate my healthcare when Priests to Pope are castrated, & all of GOP dictator men
@Senate_GOPs @SenAlexander Women should have the option of using or not using contraceptives. The real health issue of child raping priests
@McConnellPress so Catholics can protect rapist(priests) and dictate what healthcare women can and cannot have! MORONIC don't U think
@SpeakerBoehner Admit you want to dictate to women their rights as you see it, and the healthcare they can and cannot have.
@SpeakerBoehner Admit you want the economy to fail and attempting to help it to fail. Admit U R 4 big money and against the people
@SpeakerBoehnerOne time of truth would be nice coming from you. Admit you R racist and a hater and thats why you want Obama out of office
@washingtonpost Planned parenthood, and contraceptives.....
Giving women the right to use contraceptives is a better choice than protecting child rapers (priests)
Catholics! Where were the morals when protecting child raping priests? Your answer, move them elsewhere to rape even more kids.
I left the Catholic church due to double standards, one for men and another for women. One for priests and one for public.
@CatholicNewsSvc  catholics abandon people/ well  women. where were all the morals when priests are raping children? Women deserve options
@RNC hopefully never!Where were all the morals when catholic priests were raping children, and they were being protected. STOP dictating RNC
@maddow lets castrate priests to pope protect public from child rapers, more of a health risk than contraceptives to women
@PoliticsDaily Catholics need to walk softly, when trying to dictate to women, where were their morals when priests were raping children?
@SenatorReid you are a traitor to your party and to the people, back door deals!!!!!!!   What were you thinking?????
@shananigins15 priests to pope should be castrated, they are more of a public health risk / issue than contraceptives to women
@shananigins15 LOL, exactly! where were their morals then? Oh wait dictating to women what they should be doing or not doing
Catholics claim to be moral, while dictating to women's health. Where was the morality when priests rape children. oh yes being protected
@washingtonpos  Obama is giving women control over what they choose to use in health care and taking it out of the hands of men.
Women should at the very least have an option to have contraceptives and equal health care as men Fair is fair, we should have a choice.
@SenRandPaul @NROcorner like the freedom they have to protect child rapers. more heath risk than contraceptives
@RNCLatinos priests to pope should be castrated they are worse to public health than contraceptives are to women
@TheDailyShow priests to pope should be castrated they more of a public health issue / risk than that of contraceptives for women.
@WhipHoyer I think that is due GOP haters and their get Obama crap. not putting the people first, just their hate
@rcade priests to pope should be castrated they are more of danger to public health than are contraceptives. women should have the option.
@HotlineJosh priest to pope should be castrated, they are more of a danger to public health than contraceptives. women should have an option
@GOPLeader  who are your party paying to get your way and what is the price?
priest to pope mandate castration they are more of a health threat than contriceptives

@OTOOLEFAN @JoshuaHol Is he serious? WTF lets start with haters of free coice and free will
@OTOOLEFAN @COBfan @MittRomney @JoeNBC Gene does realize that Mitt .Romney donates to organizations that pray the gay out people
@OTOOLEFAN @emmettmahoney  HMMM guess not very smart, would have been smarter to ask Romney for the name of his Swiss bank.
@FoxNews which should make you very happy! You GOP members are all about deregulation
@edshow I hope they left him buried....LOL
@edshow  No I am thinking just morbid and very weird.
@BarackObama Great job with both speeches I watched today. The message will resonate well
@TheDemocrats @EvaLongoria @MittRomney  Could you really name one GOP that does support it? REALLY?
I just wanted to thank you to all of the GOP for making President Obama's job of keeping his job easier
Gov. M. Daniels last night used apple as his rebut, to discredit Obama. Apple employs 43,000 people in the US and 700,000 out the country
Obama he gave congrats to seal leader after state of the union last night. it was on the news this morning
I gotta give it to Romney he does have some balls, he is saying GOP isn't for the 1% he is for the middle cl. so his taxes need to be lower
@CoachKJP don't forget over turning roe vs wade  and having life start at conception making birth control illegal...morons
@JamilSmith @GovChristie I could think of a few worse things, That is just one of all the bad things about him and many GOP members
RT @AC360: Plan your debate and post-debate viewing parties - starts Thursday at 8pmET. Who'll be watching and tweeting with us? #CNNDebate
@CoachKJP what are you a rocket scientist.......DUH
@CoachKJP That isn't saying much...a snail could keep up or pass the GOP
@shananigins15 I just saw a few poles, that 91% are in agreement with Obama on the Buffet rule and the other positions he has taken.
@CoachKJP If they have spoken to you they know its true..lol
@CoachKJP dork....what do you think! of coarse I am. I ate mine, yours is in the fridge.
@shananigins15 @OTOOLEFAN How very true, I made a few mad yesterday
@TheFix Thats because he is lost in space!
@CoachKJP since yesterday I went from 114 followers to 10. LMAO, the were very red and didnt like my opinions i guess.
@CoachKJP she cracks me up. she has spunk. i like that. I still think you are off in blue land, i am in purple
@CoachKJP yep Rachel Madow! I grew fond of her, she has a great mind, and thats where it all starts..........
Rachel Madow is hot
@edshow I think the Gop is attempting to make several   -'s into a +. That may work in -2x-2=4 table but in a check book, - anything =   -
@edshow Not only is Daniels numbers not adding up, from what I can see none of the GOP numbers add up. It only takes basic math skills.
@Senate_GOPs what ever it is, i know its better than the GOP has to offer.
@kathygriffin He"s a republican they say anything that works for the moment, then flip flop later
@SenatorCardin People like myself are job creators, people like Romney (GOP) are job exporters
@HuffPostPol Why does no one go after Romney for profiting from the housing crisis? He slams Gingrich for lobbying, but he did for Romney
@HuffPostPol Obama's plan is better than more of the same to the 10th power from the GOP (Romney's) plan
@chucktodd  the clown show at the circus generally does attract attention. Plus gives a good idea of the horrors the GOP has in mind for us
@TheFix  My place, house state of the union party. Hoping Obama hits it home....
@Sen_JoeManchin By next generation do you mean the 1% or the 99%? If you mean the keeping welfare for the wealthy, I think we will pass.
@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics If the news is from Fox it faulse, if the story comes from elsewhere, more than liklely true
@HuffingtonPost I thought it was very funny.....and close to the truth, probably why it hurt so much....LOL
@whitehouse and needs to do more with or without them
@WaysMeansCmte unlike Germany, the GOP wall we can't see, however is is meant to conque and divide
@WaysMeansCmte @Nationaljournal  and this surprises you? The only agenda the GOP has is to distroy the middle class and poor
@SenatorReid go get em Harry, give them another spanking, they need it
I love watching the  G.O.P. debates, its like watching a clown show at the circus.
@TheFix keep watching he will bring his rapid fall soon
@Senate_GOPs Are you kidding me? I used to be a Republican & their lack of policy, thanks to the party I am now Democrat.
Before Bush I was a republican, then went Independant, after seeing what Republicans have become, I am now a new Democrat
@OrrinHatch have you and other GOPways been this dumb?  Your approach kills the the middle class and true job creaters ( sm. bussinesses)
@RoyBlunt     I wish the G.O.P was as concernned for the rest of the population, you know the people not making millions of $ disappointing
