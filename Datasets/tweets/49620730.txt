h/t @axios for compilation: 		Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): "We have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution. 		Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): "It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past."
Trump on Republicans who are concerned about the precedent his national emergency invocation sets, potentially for future Democratic presidents: "not too many people have said that... but the courts will determine that." Here are a few:
Trump: "We will have a national emergency and we will be sued, in the 9th circuit... and we will possibly get a bad ruling and then we'll get another bad ruling and then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we'll get a fair shake and we'll win in the Supreme Court."
Trump: "I don't know what to do with the money they're giving us" -- talking about the rest of the appropriations bill that fortifies things like legal ports of entry. Appropriators met with border officials to assess their needs so they probably know what to do with the $.

Yin continues: Congress placed presidential tax returns in a locked safe but provided one key, which belongs to the tax committees. "The law, therefore, should be interpreted to enable the tax committees to use that key in appropriate and necessary circumstances."

@matthewamiller This tweet makes me feel seen.
Gotta go run around a little bit. Appreciate the interesting perspectives that folks shared in this thread. https://t.co/74CnlaENUR
@cehoskinson Yes. Agreed. And the rift between 1) there actually not being that much daylight on policy re: this particular issue and 2) the political desires/outcomes is I think what is making people so understandably crazy when it comes to this issue in particular.
@CBorderGroup I appreciate your unique perspective on this. It's an extremely important one to keep in mind. Gracias!
@CAAttorney1 Yes, that's true. But I think in general -- when you think not about who's to blame in this particular debate but overall Washington dysfunction -- this entire saga is really "pissing people off" (how one host I think in Florida described it to me yesterday). Maybe I'm wrong. IDK
@cehoskinson Very true. My overall point is simply that while there are certainly policy differences, at the end of the day there's much more gray area, and potential compromise to be had, beneath the level of a conversation about "wall" or "no wall."
@CAAttorney1 as particularly maddening for folks trying to play along at home.
@CAAttorney1 in House districts. But I wonder what this whole effect will have in the presidential. I feel like both sides are being drowned out as people just say "a pox on both their houses." There's been a lot of that over all sorts of issues lately -- this one just strikes me
@CBorderGroup some physical barrier concepts, as they have in the past? Don't just stop at "no wall" because that simply plays into the president's ability to dismiss negotiations as useless. Just saying "no wall" isn't going to make him any less likely to threaten to veto w/e this group does
@CBorderGroup I think actually the Senate GOP position is a bit more nuanced when you look below the spin, but I also wonder if Democrats wouldn't help their case if they did more to reframe the argument rather than simply say "no wall." Instead, why not emphasize how they can support
@CAAttorney1 But my point is how all of this is registering with people who aren't following the finer points day in and day out. The argument you're making is a political one. I'm just expressing the basis for the frustration I'm hearing when I get to talk to people in "real America."
@cehoskinson But the Trump administration is actively changing those policies, wall or no wall. https://t.co/Vcwz9G2UW9
And they rightfully find my explanation so hard to believe: It is literally coming down to a debate over semantics. That's it. (end)
sides have approved barriers in the past (Secure Fence Act) and even RIGHT NOW are talking about barriers and walls interchangeably... why can't they figure this out in such a way that both sides can spin it as a victory?
-white than both sides are making them out to be. So why is it so hard for them to come to an agreement? I've been doing radio calls this week to stations all around the country, and that is always the number one question. Hosts rightfully don't understand why -- given that both
in such a way that there is little daylight between them. The facts are that there are 654 miles of some sort of barrier already on the southern border. A bit more to be built this year (pre-Trump appropriated projects). So clearly, the facts on the ground are much less black-and
The fact that so much of the border security debate has fallen victim to semantics is one of the things that is driving people outside the beltway crazy. Trump says he must have a "wall." Democrats say no "wall" money. AND YET -- Both sides are also talking about barriers

So anyway, that‚Äôs what the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee - the one charged with oversight of the Armed Services - has to say about the potential need to check/call out the president‚Äôs impulses on troop withdrawal.
It was weeks later that his nat sec team made clear that the withdrawal would be conditions-based. https://t.co/Vlc4zo74PG
You may recall that on the day he announced his planned troop withdrawal (12/19) there were no such qualifiers about conditions. Rather, he tweeted that ISIS had been ‚Äúdefeated,‚Äù his only reason for being in Syria, and in a subsequent video message expanded on that theme.
... that the withdrawal process would be shaped by conditions on the ground.‚Äù
I asked Inhofe‚Äôs office what statement he was referring to in which the president included the ‚Äúconditions-based‚Äù qualifier: ‚Äúafter the President‚Äôs announcement, there was swift and immediate conversation from the Administration, military leaders and the President... ‚Äú
So, I followed up-- it doesn't trouble you... ? [would have said "that the president is tweeting and saying diametrically opposed things...] Risch: "Well, it troubles you. I deal with this every day and I see differences every day, but we reconcile those."
"... to give up his nukes and not going to denuclearize the peninsula. The president has the advantage of having sit across from Kim and negotiate with him and make his own assessment as to where that‚Äôs going to go."
"and dissect them in the venue of a couple-hour, open-session intelligence committee. You can look at all of these different ways. The best example is North Korea. The intelligence community is absolutely right in using our prior history as indicating that this guy is not going

@pandagorren It's a challenge even for folks like me who cover this day in and day out!
Just the fact that the president's Rose Garden speech included the phrase "conference committee" is an indication that this agreement was forged on Congress' terms.
@pandagorren My pleasure! It's such complicated stuff :) I'm always happy to help decipher
@rheany613 @SpeakerPelosi Actually House members have been told to stay close so they may still have a roll call vote. It's just unclear at the moment.

@SuzanneAubin @WYSIWYG2017 @ABCPolitics My pleasure. This stuff is super confusing even for folks who cover this place, so I try to put stuff in plain English when I can! :)
@AdamQuark @jparkABC My pleasure! It's super confusing stuff if you're not literally here covering it!
And as other smart folks have pointed out, this is precisely how the same CR passed the Senate just before Christmas (assuming today's measure does in fact pass via UC) https://t.co/jBe5ktIHLt
@SuzanneAubin @WYSIWYG2017 @ABCPolitics Only the senator managing floor proceedings -- in this case prob Leader McConnell -- and of course the presiding officer!
@jrpaws yup.
@AdamQuark My colleague @jparkABC is reporting that the House is recessed "subject to the call of the chair" which means they could return whenever called -- as early as tonight -- to pass it.
@WYSIWYG2017 @ABCPolitics It means that rather than have every senator present to vote yes or no, they simply ask if anyone objects, and if no one objects, the bill passes. It's very anticlimactic!
A Senate Dem aide says the floor is not preparing for votes today so this CR will likely be approved via unanimous consent.

So, @SenatorBurr was the only R to vote FOR the president's bill and then not vote at all on the 2-week CR. Any thoughts as to why? (I'd try to go find him myself but I'm doing back to back radio calls)
@tvgirl222 @AndresFreundPol @neilkli @lrozen They are supposedly related!
@Jeff_Snively @neilkli @lrozen Yeah. You'd think that if any NC senator was going to sit out a vote against reopening the gov, it would be Tillis who is facing a potentially tough re-election in 2020.
@RazzleKoehler @lrozen correct.
@neilkli @lrozen Paul, Risch and Rosen did not vote on #1. They, plus Richard Burr, did not vote on #2.
@lrozen not sure, TBH.
@RazzleKoehler @lrozen Paul, Risch and Rosen did not vote on #1. They, plus Richard Burr, did not vote on #2.
@lrozen No. Those not voting: 		Burr	Paul	Risch	Rosen
Obviously, they both failed so neither are *popular*, but it's worth noting that the 2-week CR to reopen the gov got two more votes than the president's proposal did. (Although, one fewer senator voted at all during the second vote)

@DanRosenheck @MattGlassman312 I take your point and agree with you. Why not let some potentially vulnerable Republicans vote for it for insulation? That makes total sense to me.
@DanRosenheck Absolutely. There's a lot of potential for movement. But keeping his conference in line is something McConnell is really good at.
@DavidAames23001 I think also though the politics have changed. It would be a huge political loss for Republicans to vote to reopen the government via the same bill they tried to pass before the president decided to bet it all on a border wall.
@DanRosenheck Definitely. I could also end up being wrong. But this is my reporting on the situation right now.
@CAAttorney1 I agree, I think he's super smart. I think he does this to show everyone that neither of these proposals have the votes to pass.
@earvland I know, I know. But that was before the shutdown. The politics have changed. They're going to vote on the same solution they wanted before they then spent a month arguing about the need for border security?
For context: So many things in the Senate get to the floor because of a timing agreement. So to those commenting on the optics of this particular vote, I get it, but it's not unusual. It's just that we are in this particularly nihilist phase. https://t.co/BROvsDnv3V

On Klobuchar's second go-around, Barr adds to these comments about affected workers, which include DOJ employees: "I hope this ends soon." He says he's "very proud of their dedication as they stand their post." https://t.co/JPrWrDqNNO
With the hearing resumed after a vote break, Barr tells @amyklobuchar: "If the president directs the AG to do something that is contrary to law, then I think the AG has to step down." He's made several similar statements so far during the hearing.

Barr will not commit one way or the other as to how he would respond to/implement any recommendations brought by the special counsel. Says neither the president nor the committee would appreciate if he committed to acting in any specific way.

Klobuchar asks if Barr is aware of 2013 and 2018 agreements that would have involved "literally billions of dollars" for border security. Barr says he's familiar in general. "The point is, we need money right now including barriers and walls and slats and other things."
.@SenAmyKlobuchar to Barr: What's your message to furloughed/unpaid federal workers? 		Barr: "I would like to see a deal reached whereby congress recognizes that it's imperative to have border security, and part of border security as a common sense matter, involves barriers."

@brfreed Thank you.
Lastly -- here's how Trump re-enacted conversations with his military leaders/advisers about leaving Syria which concludes with him saying, "Nope. I gave you a lot of 'six months.'" It was too complicated for a series of tweets so just read the attached. https://t.co/RGlftMB3tn
And -- 	"You had plenty of people that came up and said, you know, we can make it smaller. ...I said no. Make it ten percent. Make it more than ten percent. Because it‚Äôs been a long time." 		Both those quotes are lies that the president has been called out on before.
Here are the quotes from his speech in Iraq: "You haven‚Äôt gotten [a raise] in more than ten years. More than ten years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one."
Then 2) He said he raised the military's pay by ten percent. FACT: It was raised 2.8% in 2018 and another 2.6% in the current NDAA.
Trump then makes two flagrant lies in a row: 1) He said the US military got its first pay raise in 10 years. FACT: The military has received a pay increase each year except for '83 and that was a technical glitch. @PolitiFact rated it Pants on Fire. https://t.co/MvE0T8NOQH
Trump to soldiers deployed in Iraq: "When you think about it, you‚Äôre fighting for borders in other countries! And they don‚Äôt want to fight, the Democrats, for the border of our country. It doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense."
Then Trump shifts to the political fight over wall $: "I don‚Äôt know if you folks are aware of what‚Äôs happening ‚Äì we want to have strong borders in the United States, the Democrats don‚Äôt want to let us have strong borders. Only for one reason. You know why? Because I want it."
Speaking of not being the world's policeman: "If they want us to do the fighting, they also have to pay a price and sometimes that‚Äôs also a monetary price so we‚Äôre not the suckers of the world. We‚Äôre no longer the suckers, folks. And people aren‚Äôt looking at us as suckers"
Trump: "Our presence in Syria is not open ended and was never intended to be permanent. Eight years ago we went there for three months and we never left." (Note: US airstrikes in Syria began in September 2014 -- four years ago)
Trump to troops: "We‚Äôre not nation building. Rebuilding Syria will require a political solution and it‚Äôs a solution that should be paid for by its very rich neighboring countries, not the United States. Let them pay for it. And they will. They will."
"They were very dominant. Today they‚Äôre not so dominant anymore [cheers]"

To base commander Col. Michael Maddox: "Colonel, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you Colonel. No games. I can see, I know people. No games with the Colonel. No games with your general, right? Not a lot of games. It‚Äôs called, they wanna win."
(This video hasn't fed in yet so I'm live tweeting the audio that was provided by the radio pool as I transcribe)

More from speech to troops: "As we get all of this billions and billions of dollars of new equipment that I approved over the last two years, you‚Äôre getting such new equipment your eyes are popping, right? Your eyes are popping. You‚Äôre getting the best equipment in the world."
Of trip to the region: "we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways. But we felt very very good. Very safe. And also we knew exactly where we were going and we‚Äôre going to say hello to you and wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year"
More: "we had a meeting with [Commanding Gen. LaCamera] and some of your great representatives and we have some ideas that are more than ideas that are going to be just‚Ä¶ We like to win. Do we like to win? We‚Äôre gonna win."
I'm listening now to the audio of Trump speaking to troops in Iraq. He told them of his meeting with military leaders: "We had an incredible meeting that lasted for about an hour. And you have no idea what we‚Äôve come up with. You‚Äôre gonna be so happy."
According to the pool traveling with the president, he is expected to make an unannounced stop while enroute back to the U.S.
As for Iraq, the president says he has "no plans at all" to withdraw.
Per the @AP (traveling w/ POTUS) @realDonaldTrump said the U.S. presence in Syria was never to be "open-ended," and that Turkey has agreed to eliminate remnants of IS still remaining in the country.

I scored. I scored the game-winning shootout goal. I watched the puck trickle past the goalie‚Äôs pads into the net. We won the game.
Then something inside me said to do it. So I did. ‚ÄúF‚Äîk it, I‚Äôm in.‚Äù The ref asked me if I knew how shootouts go - keep the puck moving forward, no stopping. Got it. So I put one skate in front of the other and prayed to the hockey gods not to make me look too stupid.

The first two girls on our team to go were obvious: the best two we have who definitely play(ed) for their schools. But the third was a bit up in the air. The captain looks at me (I did score a goal, so it makes sense she‚Äôd consider me, but scoring a goal in regulation
So the best girl on our team goes first, rips her shot past the goalie. The other team goes, our goalie makes a save. We miss the next shot, but our goalie makes another save. If the third shooter on our team makes the next goal, we win.
Thread: I play on a women‚Äôs rec hockey team. I‚Äôm an okay player - maybe like 4th best in the team, not amazing, but pretty good for our level - and I scored our only goal tonight (yay!). But then the game ended in a tie and, as this league does, we went straight into a shootout.

Trump on Kavanaugh accuser who recanted: "It was a made-up story. She made up the story. It was a total lie. It was fake. You know what fake means? It was fake. She lied about the story. About rape. She lied. And then we‚Äôre supposed to sit back and take it."
Incidentally -- I spent about 20 minutes talking to Trump supporters outside the rally before going in. This is very unscientific, but most of the folks I talked to here in Montana had already voted. Immigration and the economy were the two issues they cared about the most.
Trump beginning his speech highlighting the strength of the economy -- a high point that Republicans have been hoping he'd focus more on.

And -- is this the worst our politics have ever been, in his experience? Not even close, he said. "The country's going to be just fine." Recommended reading "Soul of America" by @jmeacham to get a sense of American political ugliness thru the ages.
McConnell is very bullish on hemp, which once Congress passes the Farm Bill, could have big agricultural benefits for his home state of Kentucky. Biggest in the nation, actually.
He also used "Pocahontas" to refer to @elizabethforma in a speech last night. Is that sort of racially-charged comment now fair game? "I don't have a comment on that."
McConnell said he believes the Senate and House will reach an agreement on a bill governing how Congress handles sexual harassment issues by the end of the year.
McConnell said Kavanaugh boost most effective the redder the state is. Senate races he's watching closely: "It‚Äôs pretty obvious that we have very competitive races in Arizona, Nevada, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee, West Virginia and Florida."
How about a shutdown over the wall? "The speaker and I are going to try to help the president get funding for the wall, for a year. Shutting down the government, I think, is something that is widely disliked by virtually every American and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll end up doing that."
And that this incident could change US-Saudi relations: "Presidents of both parties on the whole have tried to maintain a good relationship. This particular incident is going to really challenge that. But I think it‚Äôs too early to predict what the consequences may be."
"I‚Äôm interested in what Sec. Pompeo has to say. And I need somebody from our government, and I think he‚Äôs the logical one, to say it, that whatever investigation was done of this was credible... I can‚Äôt imagine there will be no response."

In other words, so far no one is really proposing additional ways to punish Saudi (beyond invoking Magnitsky act) because there are already so many existing concerns about involvement in Yemen -- and of course bc no explicit conclusion that Saudi murdered/is detaining him.
So far, the actions that members of Congress are proposing to counter Saudi on poss Kashoggi abduction/rendition/death are very much connected to their existing concerns about bombing in Yemen (withdraw US support, reconsider certification that Saudi trying to limit civ deaths)

Q to @ChrisMurphyCT -- did US fail to meet its duty to warn Kashoggi of a threat against him? "If the United States knew that the Saudis were attempting to abduct Jamal Kashoggi, it certainly seems that we should have let him know that his life or... freedom was in danger."
.@ChrisMurphyCT also says it's possible the U.S. Congress, for the first time since the Arms Export Control Act was passed in 1976, might block an arms sale and issue a resolution of disapproval against an upcoming sale to Saudi.
Important to note that @ChrisMurphyCT also said that Trump's rhetoric towards the media does not "give license to Saudi Arabia to murder this journalist"

@tf2 @SenatorCollins Hi there -- I address this in a later tweet on this thread -- Collins did not request stepped-up police presence. They did not contest it, but it did not originate with her.
By the way (promise this is the last thing on this topic from me): Collins' office did not request the ramped-up police presence. They did not contest it, but their point is that they don't make the rules re: security. Making sure everyone up in my @'s knows who's calling shots.
I don‚Äôt envy them right now, or at any time. Especially now, they are dealing with extremely high-stress and pressure situations. But just now, the solution was to simply check press badges and let anyone stay who had one. It‚Äôs painstaking, but it works.
By the way: I do not intend to knock the men and women who make up the @CapitolPolice. They are hardworking, professional and are just doing their jobs. But their leadership has a few times overstepped in its pursuit of security by cutting down on press access.

@KatMcKinley Right, I think everyone can understand the desire to protect from protesters who may get out of hand. However we are the press and have badges to identify and differentiate ourselves. We are only trying to ask questions. We are not a threat to anyone‚Äôs safety.

And then Democrats issued a 24-person witness list in order to neutralize claims of a fair investigation if in fact the FBI did end up getting permission to expand its scope. Again -- that's the cynical perspective.
The very cynical perspective is that the WH told the FBI to expand its investigation to neutralize Dems' complaints that the process was incomplete.

Hatch on the job Rachel Mitchell did: ‚ÄúI think shes fine. She‚Äôs very careful to try to go through the preliminaries and ... it takes a little longer than it does for, say, somebody who goes right for the jugular. But she‚Äôs very smart and very good.‚Äù

From earlier today -- @SenateMajLdr describing the female former sex crimes prosecutor (per @caphilltrish) Judiciary R's hired to ask Ford questions Thursday: "We have hired a female assistant to go on staff and to ask these questions in a respectful and professional way."
.@ChuckGrassley says committee is not going to release the name of the female lawyer ahead of the hearing for security purposes. I asked if the Judiciary Committee would tell Ranking Member @SenFeinstein her name. He replied, "No. We haven't. For the reason I gave you [security]"
.@ChuckGrassley on the former sex crimes prosecutor hired to cmte to question Ford at Thursday's hearing: "She's on the same staff as the other 14 or 15 people we've hired to process Supreme Court nominees. We do that for every Supreme Court nominee. So she's on that staff."
@Huntndux2 @JohnCornyn it's a quote. I'm an equal-opportunity quoter.
.@caphilltrish confirms that Judiciary staff held a conference call with Kavanaugh to discuss the Ramirez allegations today, and that Dems were involved. I just asked @ChuckGrassley about it, he had not been aware (likely not yet briefed as it was staff-level call)

More Cornyn: "In this case, there's no way the accused can disprove the allegation because he wasn't there, he said. It didn't happen, he said."

.@SenatorCollins, speaking at @nhiop, says in wake of Ford's allegations, She's talked to a judge, a state trooper, a prosecutor, an FBI agent, and asked them, how do they assess credibility? "Because that's hard. but ultimately, that's the job that we're going to have to do."
.@SenatorCollins says that Republicans should let Ford testify when she's ready (unclear if Collins saw the latest note from R's offering Wednesday). "If she can't be there Monday then invite her for Tuesday. Invite her for Wednesday. Invite her for Thursday."
And Grassley says Ford's lawyers now have until 10 PM this evening to respond, but says if she does not respond by then, he's going to go ahead and send a notice about a committee vote on Monday.
- They agree to allow Ford to get "adequate breaks" during testimony 		- They will provide US Capitol Police security protection
Here's what they're agreeing to: 		- Kavanaugh will not be in the room during Ford's testimony 		- They agree to one camera in the room and limited press access. 		- They agree to have the number of rounds and minutes per round of questions be equal for all senators
- They reject her request that only senators be permitted to ask questions, and they say they "reserve the right to have female staff attorneys" ask questions 		- They reject her request to issue subpoenas for Mark Judge and others 		- They will not call additional witnesses
THREAD: Here's which of Ford's team's stipulations that team @ChuckGrassley is rejecting: 		- It's Wednesday or else: "The Committee will take Dr. Ford‚Äôs and Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs testimony on Wednesday, September 26. 		- Kavanaugh must testify after Ford.

@MattNegrin Matt -- with great appreciation for your engagement, I would just say that we don't stop quoting a senator just because he does X Y or Z thing that we may or may not agree with. Hatch is still a very senior Senate Republican and, as such, his opinion matters in the sense that it
I asked him whether being a friend of the administration should be the grounds on which someone loses their clearance. Hatch's response: "I don‚Äôt think they were the grounds. I think there were some other reasons why this happened. But even so, it‚Äôs a presidential prerogative."
@HayesBrown yeah, so I asked him that next. Here's what he said: "I don‚Äôt think they were the grounds. I think there were some other reasons why this happened. But even so, it‚Äôs a presidential prerogative and if a man‚Äôs not doing what‚Äôs right. It‚Äòs just that simple."

@nothim_thatguy @JohnJHarwood He talks about it a lot in his letters to Bess, at least while he was serving in the Senate. There's quite a lot to sift through but it makes for fun reading! https://t.co/BS2lXS1Lz9
Writing about the travails of presiding over the Senate, July 4, 1935: "I had to sit in the chair all yesterday afternoon and say, 'Without objection the amendment is agreed to.'"
He also tended to write a lot of letters while "Huey" is "spouting" on the Senate floor -- presumably Huey Long -- and makes sure to note that he is writing them while ignoring Huey speaking
This one is better: "I am hoping to make a reputation as a Senator, though if I live long enough that'll make the money successes look like cheese. But you'll have to put up with a lot if I do it because I won't sell influence and I'm perfectly willing to be cussed if I'm right."
I'm perusing then-senator Truman's letters to his wife Bess (for project). From June 30, 1935: "We played five-cent poker and I won five dollars, the Costa Rican Minister lost ten and he screamed like a Jewish merchant. He is a Jew I think. At least he looks and talks like one."

@MZanona sometimes I forget about the House :/
Hey Portland folks, tune in to @1190KEX -- I'll be talking with @MarkMasonPDX about the president's latest government shutdown threats -- what he's asking for and what Congress is willing to give!
Today the president talked about the need to reform "chain migration" and "catch and release" -- those are large-scale immigration reforms that were being discussed back in Feb (and they failed on Senate floor) but are not part of the border funding discussion now.
And he wouldn't even have a "government shutdown" -- he would have just blocked any funding, at all, from going to homeland security operations.
If Congress waits to send Trump a DHS spending bill (incl border $$) until very late, you could see a scenario in which he's signed into law other spending bills already (like military). So if he were then to reject only a DHS bill, he'd be cutting off his nose to spite his face.

Yes these resolutions being discussed today are nonbinding, but they are the quickest way for the Senate to do something as a whole to respond to the president. Anything more consequential will take more time, hearings, witnesses. Even if the answers all seem self-evident.
Meanwhile, McConnell met with Chairmen Crapo (Banking) and Corker (Foreign Relations) last night. They agreed to hold hearings on existing Russia sanctions and recommend "additional measures that could respond to or deter Russian malign behavior."
State of play in Senate: Flake/Coons and Schumer want to pass unanimous resolutions 1) reaffirming support for DOJ/IC and 2) expressing belief that US should not turn over any current/former officials for questioning by Vladimir Putin.

Q: Sarah Sanders took a lot of heat yesterday in the briefing... 	Trump: She did? I didn‚Äôt know that.
Trump on KJU: "He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same."
The return of remains of Americans who perished in the Korean war is of course incredibly important and meaningful, but the goal here is denuclearization. Trump in this interview so far has been talking more about the return of remains.
Trump on Kim when @SteveDoocy notes that he is a horrific dictator: "That‚Äôs what it is. But what am I supposed to do, walk out and say terrible?"
Trump on Comey using a private email: "He had a private email. Of all the things, that was to me maybe the most interesting but it was probably the funniest. That was a little bit of a surprise, I have to say."
In unprecedented impromptu walk to Fox's location on the White House North Lawn, President Trump declares that the FBI (as a whole) was "actually plotting against my election."
Former sens Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who met with POTUS + VP ahead of North Korea summit, advised him to use their landmark, bipartisan soviet nuclear reduction agreement as a guiding tool. Also urging him to keep Congress involved in building treaty https://t.co/pAFZkLUIs7

@tubguppy @POTUSPressPool @juliemason Good question. Not directly, but I think the questioners were asking to get a sense of how he responds to the president in private. Does he push back? And when he was so evasive, that raised their concerns about how forthcoming he'd be with folks who conduct oversight.
@tubguppy @POTUSPressPool @juliemason Hah! My pugs do :)
With Paul a no on Pompeo, he needs at least one Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be reported out favorably to the full Senate. He can still get a floor vote but it's unusual for a Sec/State nom to have one w/o a favorable recommendation. Same math on floor.
A spokesman for @RandPaul confirms he remains opposed to Mike Pompeo, this time for his nomination to Secretary of State. He also voted against his confirmation as CIA director.

@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze Amen. Good talk!
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze Again -- I'm somewhat removed from a lot of the on-the-ground reporting here, but I would simply say stay tuned. Some of this information takes a long time to report out. Good reporting takes time. Especially in under-resourced local newsrooms.
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze I think we agree here. I wish no one had shouted last night. All sides of the debate have work to do.
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze But I think getting all sides together for a dialogue is the right direction.
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze But I do understand why you are making these arguments. I think the unfortunate thing in this and many debates is that the loudest voices are sometimes the ones given the biggest megaphones. We in the media certainly deserve scrutiny for that.
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze I disagree that no one is asking. I can't speak for my colleagues who are on the ground covering this story directly (I focus on Congress) in terms of their precise reporting, but it's a critical part of the story. I also don't think anyone is focusing *only* on the NRA.
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze About the 39 police responses? I thought it was a perfectly legitimate question but TBH it seems to me like there are still a lot of open questions about those visits. I don't know that she or the sheriff were in full possession of all the facts there.
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze No, I don't think that. I thought she availed herself quite well last night. The folks shouting should not have. It was bad. But then they stopped, and she got her points across. CNN gave her a platform + I thought she did well. But clearly,she has diff messges for diff audiences
@WhigsnTwigs @redsteeze Look, I think the boo'ing last night was terrible, unproductive and is part of why this debate has been stagnant. But the CNN forum allowed Loesch and Rubio to get their points across. Why is Loesch stooping to the level of those shouting at her the next morning?

Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who delivered lifesaving first aid to Rep. Steve Scalise after he was shot at congressional baseball practice, also attended to the injured people in the truck as first responders arrived.
The collision split the garbage truck in half. Ambulances and helicopters were quickly on the scene, but even before they arrived, lawmakers who are medical professionals were delivering first aid, including Reps. Phil Roe and Drew Ferguson.
Based on convos with lawmakers on train, it was traveling at around 45-50 MPH - the speed it had been traveling at. Did not slow down - truck was trying to make it over tracks as guard rails came down.

One of the emerging arguments from Senate Republicans against pushing aggressively for votes on a bill to protect Mueller seems to be, "But the president hasn't tried to fire him since June!"
Warner: "We now have this new evidence that the president wanted to fire Mueller... That coming on top of his actions with Comey, with AG Sessions, with his allies trying to undermine the DOJ and the FBI overall, these are not the actions of somebody that's got nothing to hide"
Grassley does not seem to think there's urgency to stopping Trump from being able to fire special counsel: "Based on his statements from the last couple weeks, [Trump] and his lawyers appear to be cooperating with Mueller."
Grassley also says that before his committee moves to advance bill to make it harder for a president to fire a special counsel, the authors of 2 similar bills (Graham/Booker and Tillis/Coons) must reconcile the differences.
New statement from Senate Judiciary Chair @ChuckGrassley: "I've said for a long while now that the President, and everyone else, ought to let Mueller do his job and get through his investigation."
Warner says Intel Committee wants to bring key witnesses like Don Jr., Jared Kushner and Michael Cohen back in for senators to interview.
Warner would not say whether he has seen the Nunes memo yet about alleged Obama-era FISA abuse, but that he's seen the underlying documents and that "there's no there there."
Sen. Mark Warner, ranking member on Senate Intel, says that the committee has made "enormous progress" over the last 60 days, including access to new documents and additional witnesses.
In an interview, @CoryBooker says he hopes President Trump's reported efforts to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller give his and @LindseyGrahamSC's bill to curtail presidential ability to fire a special counsel more "momentum," says his staffers are working on that now.

The Senate GOP argument on the floor tonight is, Dems holding up government funding "because of illegal immigration." (Although everyone agrees on giving DACA recipients some form of legal status)
McConnell: "so the complaint now is that [the CR] doesn't have the other issues in it [namely DACA]. Well it doesn't have the other issues in it because we haven't reached agreement" on those other issues
Schumer: "this [month-long] resolution kicks the can down the road and gives us no reason to believe that it'll be any different than the first CR, second, third and the fourth."
McConnell's prediction: "41 members of the opposition party are going to prevent us from passing a measure, the details of which they all support, because they can't get their way on this illegal immigration issue which really only becomes urgent in March."
McConnell laments what he says is budget discussion being slowed by Dems' DACA focus: "The continued interjection of an issue about which there is no urgency into a discussion about how to deal with a potpourri of issues that do need to be urgently met."
Schumer: If Senate could pass a CR for just a few days, "maybe the majroity leader -- [looks at McConnell] we're trying to help you, Mitch -- can pin down exactly what President Trump wants."
Schumer on CR: "ultimately the idea here might be to pursue an idea floated by my R colleagues -- pass a clean extension for four or five days"
