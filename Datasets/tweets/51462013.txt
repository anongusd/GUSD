For the rest of the week, no one would take the spot by the tree.
Absolute chaos. Ladies in yoga wear scattering all over. Iguana terrified. Everyone scattering in different directions.
This was, to be clear, a rather large iguana.
One morning, as we were all in some pose, an iguana who lived in a nearby tree leapt from his home onto the platform/studio.
We did yoga every morning on a platform that was sort of perched on a hillside in the jungle.
The raccoon attacking the iguana reminds me of when I went on a yoga retreat to Costa Rica with my youngest brother.

@hugnkiss that is my general understanding.
Great now I am thinking through all the ways in which the various people in The Family Stone are bad.
@sdpowell1 They are all bad. Except the gay couple. They are ok.
Which is doubly crappy because that’s my middle name.
All of the characters in this movie are bad, except for the gay couple, but Everett is the worst. https://t.co/uMNKn45wtF

@BillLoehfelm She pulled herself out of water onto a dock just using her upper body. Like a lifeguard. It was insane.
Thank you to my old landlady for going along with the idea that she was *just* over the building's 25 pound limit.
@andylancaster I mean it’s the holidays ...
