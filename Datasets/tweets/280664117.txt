Like he did over weekend in Wisconsin, O'Rourke responds to question about rise of democratic socialists by declaring himself a capitalist. "I don’t see how we’re able to meet any of the fundamental challenges we have as a country w/o in part harnessing the power of the market."
Should all border walls come down, not just the El Paso one? “I think there is a role for physical barriers in some places," O'Rourke says, noting he was making pt. w/ Hayes based on EP's specific situation. BO advocates working w/ "local stakeholders" on best security solution.
.@BetoORourke on @BernieSanders' '20 entrance: "I think it’s great that he’s getting in. I think he’s added so much to the national conversation" on issues like health care and higher ed. It's "healthy for democracy" to have somebody like Sanders running.
Considering '20 Senate run? O'Rourke: "I'm trying to figure out how I can best serve this country, where I can do the greatest good for the United States of America, so yeah, I’m thinking through that &amp; it ... may involve running for the presidency, it may involve something else"

@TVietor08 Yeah, for sure. My tweet was just more about how those transfers were used. It's obviously impossible to match up every dollar he sent to the party with every dollar it spent, but at the time, it looked to me that he was primarily running his mail program through the party.
@houtopia I'm just referring to the more narrow question of the extent to which his transfers to the state party benefited himself vs. others. No doubt his campaign more broadly had an impact down ballot.

Premise that O’Rourke should’ve given to other candidates is dumb, but his state party transfers aren't the best counter-evidence here, IMHO. TDP in turn spent millions on mail for O'Rourke. Extent to which those transfers benefited down ballot is unclear. https://t.co/guKDfpkcKn

Would you support Trump declaring state of emergency if Congress doesn't act by Feb. 15? "I do think it is an emergency," Abbott said, stopping short of responding one way or the other.
Audience question: Why aren't you more vocal in support for Trump? Abbott replies he's engaged "constantly" w/ admin. officials from POTUS on down, also lawmakers. "More important... than talking to cameras is talking to people who can pass the laws [that'll] truly fix" problems.
Abbott defended concept of border wall — "The wall works" — but emphasized it's not be-all, end-all of border security. "Will a barrier help? Yeah. Will a barrier solve everything? Absolutely not," he said.
A few highlights from Fox News taping this evening in San Antonio: On shutdown deal, Abbott said, "Now is the time — there's no more excuses — " for Congress to "step up and pass a law that’s gonna do more than just secure the border [but also] fix a broken immigration system."

@AndreasLupus @gina_calanni @RepSchofield @dwayne_bohac @AdamForTexas There are still outstanding ballots to be counted, and from what I've seen, the candidate with the fewer votes in each race hasn't conceded yet.
Haven't seen anybody crunch these numbers yet, so here goes — Texas' 191 rural counties contributed 11% of the #txsen vote; non-rural counties made up the remaining 89%. In rural counties, @TedCruz defeated @BetoORourke 75% to 24%. In non-rural counties, O'Rourke beat Cruz 51-48.
As of tonight, seeing two Texas races where the margin is still &lt;100 votes:	- #HD132: @gina_calanni (D) is ahead of @RepSchofield (i) (R) by 97 votes	- #HD138: @dwayne_bohac (i) (R) leads @AdamForTexas (D) by 72 votes #txlege

Cornyn on Cruz skipping Senate for trail this wk.: "We really haven’t had any close votes that have turned on a single senator’s absence or presence. I trust [Cruz] to make decisions in the best interest of his campaign &amp; his service," but he hasn't affected any outcomes this wk.
Cornyn on #txsen  — Plans to stump for Cruz? “We’re working on that, &amp; I’ll be doing everything I can to help [Cruz] get re-elected." Trump visit? "I would expect that to happen, &amp; I hope it does happen. I think they’re considering it, but they haven’t" picked date/location yet.

@KB805 @Beanzamillion21 Are you referring to the Helping a Hero event you tweeted about?

This spot is airing in San Antonio, and it looks like it may be custom to the market, with shots of @DiegoBernalTX, @TMFtx, rainbow crosswalk, etc. Currently seeing slightly different versions of the ad (w/o the SA shots) in markets like DFW and Houston. https://t.co/pFT0Ing6Wa
