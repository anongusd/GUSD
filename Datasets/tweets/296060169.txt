And of course one of my favorites (a reform Paul Ryan has worked on for years): Criminal Justice Reform		I skipped over other accomplishments but there’ll be plenty of time to discuss. 		A productive Speakership indeed.
-Beginning a shift to an outcomes-focused model for federal programs with the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act		-Reforms to move people from welfare to work, including the case management approach required of states in the latest farm bill
-Longest extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program in history		-Initiatives to alleviate poverty and expand economic opportunity, including through the Opportunity Zones included in tax reform and social impact financing		-Overhaul of our career and technical ed system
But then there are less talked about reforms:		-One of the toughest sanctions packages in history against Russia, Iran, and North Korea		-Expansion of the GI Bill to remove the 15-year limit and enable veterans to access benefits at any point during their lifetimes
Of course there are the obvious major reforms like:		-The most comprehensive overhaul of the tax code in 3 decades so Americans can keep more of their $		-Rebuilding the military’s readiness after years of severe cuts		-2 major anti-opioid packages to attack this epidemic

@TaraDiJulio @BresPolitico @JakeSherman Revising and extending my remarks: The House is a better beat for reporters! But, I’m as bicameral of a staffer as they come.
@riccimike @vvandehey @HamiltonMusical Dying. Meanwhile, @DougAndres hates both of our music.
@vvandehey @HamiltonMusical Or, just another day in the press shop. Much to @riccimike’s chagrin.
“The First Step Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives in June by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 360-59.” https://t.co/w2AW5YPTMM
@BresPolitico And if you’re getting granular, the House is of course objectively better beat than Senate which has no speaker’s lobby equivalent access, less open hallways, less members to grab etc. @JakeSherman
Look at those white mountains. Soon it will be the most magical time of the year: ski season. https://t.co/WIPQinSw1J

@ErinGaetz That new member dinner two years ago truly feels like yesterday!
@DanDePetris And of course, as you note, the House negotiated a compromise resolution with this same sponsor and passed that resolution. The House has spoken on this issue.
@DanDePetris As a result, even if this passed both chambers and was signed by the president, DOD would not need to alter its activities.
@DanDePetris Huffpost failed to include my full comment. The U.S. is no longer providing the very support that this bill seeks to cut off thus making it unnecessary. It is based on a factually faulty premise. We are not involved in ‘hostilities’ in Yemen so the War Powers Act does not apply.

@StevenTDennis It’s worth repeating, revenue is up (along with nearly every other economic indicator). Near the 50-year average and expected to grow. Revenue is not our long-term problem. It’s spending.
@StevenTDennis And of course the House passed major entitlement reform in repeal/replace.		Also, no RT for the tax revenue facts? Seems of note for your followers given the tax thread. ;)
Okay I’ll bite. 		Contrast to today: GOP-led Congress + President Trump enacted the most amount of approps bills on time in over 20 years. First time our military isn’t operating under CR in a decade. https://t.co/2TivlLJxdW
@StevenTDennis 2/2 problem is the same as it ever was: spending. CBO has predicted trillion $ deficits around this time for a while now, and that’s because mandatory spending programs are growing too quickly. Gonna take bipartisan will to tackle.
@StevenTDennis 1/2 Tax revenue is actually up this year. The economy is growing, people are employed, paying taxes, and as a result receipts are up. Revenue is near the 50-year average and expected to grow. Revenue is not our long-term problem.

@JessicaHuseman It seems this somewhat critical point is lost on a few of your followers. Hope they take note. Have a great rest of your day.

There are many more wins all of which you can find here: https://t.co/7QFuL6N8R3
We begin to rebuild America’s infrastructure with $21.2 billion in new funding for long-overdue improvements to our nation’s infrastructure including resources to improve highways, railways, and airports. And there are no earmarks for specific projects.
We maintain all existing pro-life policies, including the Hyde amendment, the Dickey-Wicker amendment, and the Weldon amendment.
We step up the fight against the opioid epidemic with nearly $4 billion -- the the largest federal investment to date for fighting the opioid epidemic. The bill includes funding for treatment, prevention, and law enforcement programs to save lives.
We begin construction of the wall w/ $1.57B for physical barriers along the Southwest border in line with the admin's request. It increases funding for border security &amp; immigration enforcement, ensuring that detainees are referred to ICE instead of harbored by sanctuary cities.
We fix &amp; fully fund the FBI's NICS. The bill implements key provisions of the DOJ STOP School Violence Act to fund grant programs that help keep schools safe. We provide $2.3 billion in new funding for mental health, training, and school safety programs.
We support our service members and veterans, fully funding the biggest pay raise for our service members in 8 years. It includes a record level of funding for the VA, with more resources for health care, opioid abuse treatment, and better medical facilities.
We fulfill our pledge to rebuild the nation’s military, delivering the biggest increase in defense funding in 15 years. After training accidents &amp; incidents, we are boosting resources for key readiness programs, including training, facility maintenance, and base operations.
Let's run through some of the conservative wins for the country in this spending bill, beginning with our troops.
