@ColinMoir1 It’s not necessarily compromising the end goal to take incremental steps to achieve it. It’s recognizing the hurdles and clearing them as they come instead of trying to jump them all at once.
@ColinMoir1 And, thankfully, strides are being made in the turnout game. And gerrymandering is being tackled in some states
@ColinMoir1 I don’t want it to come across that I don’t support it (I do), but realistically, it’s going to be a process. Because it’s not just running the right candidates, it’s also taking into account the voter suppression laws, excessive gerrymandering, and getting the turnout
@ColinMoir1 I don’t even think the votes will be there with the incentive. Especially in the Senate. Likely the House.
@ColinMoir1 RBG isn’t going to live forever. And the conservative justices are decently young, unfortunately.
@ColinMoir1 That is bucking a lot of historical trends. And would likely wind up in a SCOTUS case.
@ColinMoir1 In the article he’s quoted as saying it’s something that may be able to get through Congress, not wanting to make big promises he wouldn’t be able to fulfill. Because even our own caucus wouldn’t be entirely on board with M4A.
@ColinMoir1 It isn’t practical, though. It’s feasible if you have the Congress to do it, which he won’t. So it’s something that needs to be done incrementally.

@zoeyjsalsbury Okay I’m done 🥰🥰
Okay, I’m done. Thanks for letting me ramble, twitter 🥰
Plus, @ConnieSchultz thought he was good enough to marry. That should be all the justification for his candidacy that is needed. 		Anyway, Senator Brown is what the country needs. He’s genuine. He isn’t frilly. He’s authentic. He’s a progressive. He’s one of us.
I don’t believe any other candidate can win in 2020. Senator Brown focuses on the issues Democrats need to emphasize and has a proven track record supporting the issues Democrats/progressives care about. He’s the ticket. He’s the real deal.
So, yes, while Senator Brown isn’t the “diverse candidate,” he is the candidate with the right message, right record, and, quite frankly, right geographic upbringing for the Presidency. This man supports American workers in everything he does.
Senator Brown genuinely cares about Americans and in the American Dream. His populist movement isn’t manufactured or geared toward the elite. It is focused on ensuring everyone can exist freely in America. It /IS/ the American promise.
It has ALWAYS been about the people, the worker, the “Main Street” American and ensuring they can survive in this country. (And globally!! He’s stated one of his reason to opposing NAFTA is how workers in Mexico are treated.)
Senator Brown has ALWAYS been a champion for workers, women, and the LBGTQ+ community (his voting record shows it). He never made national splashes or tried to gain name recognition because it’s never been about the next seat.
He champions the values Dems need going into 2020, despite being a slightly older cis white man (I’ve wrestled with this, but have made peace because of the following sentiment).
After Clinton’s loss in 2016, I woke up KNOWING the next Democratic presidential nominee would have to focus on the worker. The ONLY person who truly does that is Senator Brown. He’s done it his entire career.
So when Senator Brown says all work matters, no matter what it is, believe him. He is 100% authentic, in his progressivism and in his grassroots movements.
(He still does this, BTW. He takes his lunch with him to work and will sit with Capitol Hill workers and talk with them. Not to or over them. It’s important.)
ANYWAY, I adore the “Dignity of Work” ethos Senator Brown has and has always adhered to. When he first ran for state rep after obtaining his bachelors, he would go to union halls and listen to what workers needed. He didn’t speak for them, but elevated their concerns.
So, when we discuss who should be running for president in 2020 and what the Democrats need, we need to focus on those states (if you think CA is ever going to go for Trump, 😂😂😂).
I’m from Ohio (I mean, duh. My @ is ClevelandKait. I have a bit of pride in my state). My perspective has always been one separated from the coasts, which, if we are honest, produce a lot of elitism in their candidates that are out of sync with the big swing states.
Senator Brown frames his messaging around the worker, not Wall Street vs Main Street, which is important. He brings the state of the union home instead of focusing on a “boogie man.” That’s something Warren and Sanders, the “Progressive champions” fail to realize.
@zoeyjsalsbury Don’t do that omg I’m going to get DISTRACTED
His focus on the dignity of work is exactly what will win him the White House, should he formally announce his candidacy. (He’s running. Why else would he be doing a tour of the early nominating states? He wouldn’t.)
First, I have very explicit bias toward him. He’s my Senator, and I voted for him in this last election (knowing full well he is a great representative for the state of Ohio and a champion of progressive values).
So I have a lot of feeling about @SherrodBrown running for President and his dignity of work tour. 		1/ idk
