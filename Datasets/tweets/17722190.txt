Yay! prince just road back in on his bicycle #oakland #oracle! For encore
Ha ha! #prince #oakland just hopped on a bicycle and road off stage. We're all screaming for encore at #oracle
Full to the rafters for #prince #oakland concert at #oracle and everyone screaming and singing for rendition of kiss!
Wow! #prince #oakland is sexing up this piano!
Not that it matters but I wonder how many in this crowd were around when  purple rain came out #prince #oracle #oakland
Who else but #prince #oakland could hold a crowd of 20,000 in thrall with just a piano?
So #prince has packed #oracle #oakland and he is off the chain!
A lot of not happy #prince fans outside #oracle #oakland. A total cluster fuck. No one can get in no explanation.
Anyone at #prince #oakland #oracle know why no one is being let in 15 min after supposed start time?
I love my man #prince but holding all these crowds outside the gate#oakland for a sound check? Not cool when concert supposed to start at 9.
Long backup to get in to see #prince what happened to gates opening at 730 #oracle #oakland #prince
Big crowd at coliseum Bart heading to #prince #oakland

@gonzoakland  120 homicides &amp; counting. How many cop perps in that total?
@gonzoaklland:hey don't get ur drift. 6 people killed in  my neighborhood in 4 months in streets. no cop shooters. how is that complicated?

Desley brooks does abt face after camping out with occupy protesters. she is calling them our for how they have damaged oakland biz.
Pat Kernighan: the collateral damage on small biz is real and it's what a lot of people are pissed off about.
As pat Kernighan says big corps don't give a "rats ass about oakland" this movement is hurting smaller biz and has set us back 15 yrs.
Patricia Kernighan talks about collateral damage of occupy oakland & terrible effect on small biz. Spoiled rude yahoos boo her.

Kaplan is right. Behavior of vandals hurts the whole movement.
