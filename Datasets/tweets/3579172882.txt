@ryan_victory1 You’re correct. That wording is poor, and therefore the tweet will be deleted.		I still stand behind the sentiment that was expressed in the entirety of the thread, that athletes who bring the school money and recognition, generally have privilege regular students don’t.
@NSteele1991 @morganisawizard This ain’t it, Chief.
@JesseGreen99 Doing the same thing at our University.		And for disagreeing with the policy we are being falsely labeled as racist, sexist, homophobic bigots.
@morganisawizard Interesting. What do you think would have to happen for true freedom to be restored?
It really is disheartening that our government, which was created by the people and for the people, is failing to represent the people.		This makes, yet another case, for the importance of state’s rights.
It feels like our representative government cares nothing about what the majority of the American people think and desire.		And a lot of the President’s policies, that are backed by a majority of Americans, fail to ever be enacted because the legislature chooses to play politics.
Today I heard someone say, “I feel like those that support President Trump are at war with our own government.”		And at first I dismissed this, but then I started thinking about how accurate it was.		Not in the sense of a literal war, but in an ideological one...
@dyalndlaotn https://t.co/eaydDgydt0
@dyalndlaotn Agreed entirely. Hold everyone to the same standard regardless of where they decide to channel their energy.
@hantaylxr Yep... we’ve had MULTIPLE instances at every institution I’ve ever been at (high school and college) just like that... where if it’s football or basketball players, that the school expects to make revenue from, the same rules don’t apply to them.
@dyalndlaotn I agree 100%. 		And all I’m asserting is, their shouldn’t be special privilege because an individual made the choice to channel their effort into athletics, as opposed to anything else. 		There are students that work just as hard in every other discipline.
@MeganMeadow25 @abbiewhitehurst To the first comment, I would agree the sport has a lot to do with it, but I’m not convinced the institution does.		Secondly, I would say you do work hard to get where you are... but so do a lot of the regular student. It’s just a difference in where the effort is channeled.
@abbiewhitehurst That is not to say the other sports aren’t important... some certainly are, however I think the “privilege” comes about when an institution sees the platform the athlete will one day have and/or the money they can bring the school both before and after graduation.
@abbiewhitehurst I would certainly concede that it has a lot to do with the sport, however I’m unsure about the institution.		My comment was mostly about the sports that bring the athlete and the school money and fame, as cited later in the thread, which is primarily football and basketball.
“Safe, Legal, and Rare,” was one of the  worst lies ever sold to the American people...		Hundreds of thousands of innocent children are being murdered, due to personal inconvenience, each year via abortion.		Abortion is murder, and anything but safe, legal, or rare.

@feminism_sucks_ I have read that as well, that’s why I said the allegation lacks any basis.
But will the mainstream media do this?		Probably not...		CNN will probably assert it as fact, just like they did with the Jussie Smollett “hate crime,” which is now believed to be a hoax.
In the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, the Covington Catholic controversy, and the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax, we must learn from, very recent, past mistakes and not jump to unfounded conclusions.		We must WAIT for all of the facts to come out.
However, the accusation’s validity is yet to be confirmed, and the accuser has offered very little evidentiary basis for the claim.		So, as of now, the allegation is baseless.

@JamesWashngton They’re popular because people are tired of their simple, morally defensible understandings being pushed out by the radical progressivism that seeks to silence many through mob rule masquerading as moral authority.
@JamesWashngton If that were the case then the prevailing sentiment in the comments would be positive. But it’s not, it’s quite negative.
@SearsAl I literally just spit out my coffee laughing at that.		Thanks Alec, now I’ve got to wash this sweatshirt😂
@JeremyMathews10 Nope, allegedly “center-right.”
@JeremyMathews10 I thought so too, but I’m starting to encounter it in “Republican” circles as well.
@TXDavidP Show me where I ever mentioned her race? 		I couldn’t care less about what the color of her or anyone else’s skin is, so stop making claims you can’t validate.		I find her repetitiveness, inability to speak without cussing every other word, and general ignorance annoying.
@JamesWashngton If they’re so normal and exhausted then why do they resonate so much?		Maybe because people have hit their limits with the irrationality that this “progressive” society deems as popular.		And at that point even the seemingly obvious needs to be said.
She is the most annoying human being in the world and I do not understand how she’s famous...		First we had to deal with the “Catch Me Outside” girl, now this?		Stop making stupid people famous. https://t.co/9oIreUpaM2

Unpopular Opinion:		You shouldn’t vote for someone simply because of their race, gender, or sexual preference.		Those factors have no bearing on how they govern.		You should vote for someone solely based on their beliefs and plans to make this country better.
@SPD357 Also, the claim that it’s a “gateway drug” has been scientifically disproven.		It is less addictive than caffeine.		Anyone that chooses to pursue other drugs after marijuana has no one to blame but themselves. Blaming marijuana is just another form of self-victimization.
@SPD357 I’ve never partaken in drugs, but denying the proven medicinal benefit is simply scientifically illiterate.
There are over 700 strains of marijuana, all having different effects, that are used to treat a variety of medical needs. 		Examples being seizure prevention, cancer treatment, eating disorders, etc.		Just because you don’t understand the benefit, doesn’t mean it isn’t there. https://t.co/FeoHG0bnyR

@kiimmyyyyyyy @JLoutspoken @realDonaldTrump And that’s the hard part of this discussion, and also why Congress’s incompetence is all the more infuriating... because securing our borders shouldn’t come at the cost of thousands of federal employees paychecks.
@morganisawizard Far too often, those utilitarian arguments are set up on the basis of public morality as well... in an effort to, paint any opposing view points as immoral.		“Well if you really cared about poor people, you wouldn’t mind paying higher taxes... it’s obvious you hate the poor.”
@JLoutspoken @realDonaldTrump Depends on what the bill calls for.		We NEED a stronger defense against illegal immigration, and the border wall achieves that. 		If there is no funding for a border wall in the bill, I think the President should allow another shutdown.		We can’t keep putting this off...

This quote explains the rise of politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.		Our country has chosen to ditch rationality, in pursuit of temporary pleasure and comfort.		It doesn’t matter if it’s realistic, as long as it feels good.		This line of thinking is a threat to democracy. https://t.co/0r7fUGnHYz
“A democratic society depends on the ability of its members to make rational choices.		But rational choices must be based on rational beliefs.		If we can’t tell the difference between reasonable and unreasonable, we become susceptible to the claims of the irrational...”
“The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but how it thinks...”
We need God’s help.		Because we can’t face this world alone, but with God all things are possible.
Perfection is an impossible goal to reach, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive for it.		In fact, Jesus said, “Be perfect, therefore, as your Father in Heaven is perfect.”		Because it’s in that pursuit of perfection that we truly begin to understand our need for a Savior.
I’m not perfect,		I’ve made a lot of mistakes,		I still make a lot of mistakes,		But, with God’s help, I’m becoming better each day...
“Belief alone, without questioning why you believe, doesn’t help us get any closer to truth.”
Greatness is defined by what you do when no one is watching...		The time you spend,		The work you put in,		The unwillingness to quit.		It’s a mindset that you won’t quit, fail, or be phased by negativity. In turn, that mindset produces actions daily, that propel you to your goal.

Any of the 3 ways, promote spiritual progress and ideological refinement of some kind, and that’s a GREAT thing.		Because at the end of the day, each of our faith journeys are different,	 	And we can only walk on the path, at the pace, that God has created for us.
And the refiner, will hear the ideological points taught to him/her, and wonder how that matches up with Scripture.		This will cause them to read more of the Scriptures, take ownership of their own faith, and begin to understand why they believe what they believe.
The conformist person will continue believing exactly what they’re told, without questioning it.		This is partially good, because they’re learning more about Christ in the process.		But I fear this is bad as well, because it seems like they aren’t taking ownership of their faith.
The generally unconcerned person will ignore or completely give up on the ideology, because they didn’t believe it themselves in the first place.		While this is sad for that person, it will at least plant the question of, “is something greater out there?” in their heads.
I think living in a place with a set ideology causes one of three individual outcomes:		-The Unconcerned		-The Conformist		-The Refiner

Fear is a liar.		It tells you that you’re not enough...		Not strong enough, not smart enough, not loving enough, and the list goes on and on.		But that’s a lie. Because God says, despite your brokenness and imperfections, you are enough, and all things are possible with His help.
O Lord, my God, I called to You for help and You healed me. -Psalm 30:2		Prayer works.		We always want to think that we can overcome the hardships of this world on our own, but the truth is that we can’t...		On our own we will surely fail, but with God, all things are possible.

The “Safe, Legal, and Rare” abortion defense is so oxymoronic and ignorant.		If something is safe and legal...why does it need to be rare?		Simple, because deep down, Leftists understand that the murder of an innocent, defenseless, unborn baby is immoral.

@sarahbedsole True libertarians are probably the most evident example of this.		They believe in individual liberty above all else, that liberty extends to the individual in the womb. 		They don’t think another person should have the right to deprive that child of their most fundamental rights.
@sarahbedsole If you’re a Catholic, do you necessarily agree with everything the Pope says on every issue? 		Or do you follow what you believe above all else your ideology says?		(2/3)
@sarahbedsole It’s not a misrepresentation... I didn’t say the libertarian party, I said true libertarians, and there is a difference.		True believers in an ideology don’t necessarily always agree with what the establishment says... libertarians are no different. 		(1/3)

@msnicolemaria @RealHannahCarl And I get that, but this isn’t an attack, and this isn’t talking about the average person. This is talking about someone who millions of young women look up to, and the woman who, whether we like it or not, sets societal beauty standards.
@RealHannahCarl Definitely. I think it’s an entirely opinion based conversation so there’s really no right answer.		However I do appreciate you engaging in respectful conversation, you’re literally the ONLY one who stayed respectful and actually had the intellectual fortitude to talk it out.
@msnicolemaria We do that. And a vast majority of boys and men in the United States listen.		Also that literally has nothing to do with the conversation...
@RealHannahCarl It’s not the advocation of radical modesty though...		It’s simply saying you don’t have to post on social media and show everyone everything to be beautiful.		As someone with a younger sister, I would hate for her to think that she has to dress like this to be beautiful.
@msnicolemaria But the question is, what does dressing that way while being a role model teach our nations girls?		https://t.co/j2fYkUVP33
@RealHannahCarl Because although you’re right to an extent, a child sees the Kardashian’s dress like that, and as a result get money, fame, and any guy they want. So if I want the same, I should dress that way.		I think no one should feel they have to dress that way to be beautiful.
@RealHannahCarl I agree to an extent, however there is a standard of beauty that is held by the majority of society. And many, many, many people look to the Kardashians for that standard. 		So, when they are almost completely naked all the time I think it sets a bad precedent for young girls.

Our generation has such a messed up definition of beauty.		To be beautiful, you don’t have to be practically naked all the time.		In my opinion, beauty comes from being confident enough to dress modestly, and know you look good. Now that’s “stunning” these days... https://t.co/nPJYlRHFfD

Stop using race as crutch, when your existing argument is baseless, and not supported by any semblance of factual evidence.
The validity of one's argument is determined by the facts, or lack thereof, supporting it.

Wouldn't a world where judgement is replaced by encouragement, be an amazing thing?
Instead of choosing to point out people's "flaws," what if we motivated them to keep growing, learning, and living?
We are all struggling, all learning, all trying to figure this thing out we call life...
You pickup on other's perceived "shortcomings" and choose to acknowledge them... but, do you ever stop and acknowledge your own?
When you judge someone, you are essentially saying that you know better than them, or that you are better than them.
Why do we judge? (A thread)
Surround yourself with people who support you and make you happy.		Life is too short to be with those who make you doubt yourself.
The speed of your response does not enhance, nor diminish, it's validity.		This concept, I believe, is lost on this generation.
