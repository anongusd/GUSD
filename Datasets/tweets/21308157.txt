It’s unacceptable for states to hide the performance of students of color. We hope you’ll use the information today to spotlight student performance &amp; institutional shortcomings, so we can meet the needs of ALL students. #ShowMeTheData
@TheJusticeDept @usedgov @pewresearch A3: For example, our Tennessee affiliate offers a great model for other states to study and implement. 		@KnoxUrbanLeague works w/@Conexion_TN and the state to host bootcamps for families to learn about the state #ESSA plan and report card. #ShowMeTheData
@TheJusticeDept @usedgov A3: @pewresearch data shows that Black &amp; Latinx parents rely heavily on their mobile devices to access information. States should keep this in mind &amp; make report cards available in multiple locations and formats, including mobile. #ShowMeTheData
@TheJusticeDept A3: Now that all state #ESSA plans have been submitted to @usedgov, states must continue to engage students, parents &amp; advocates as ambassadors and influencers throughout the implementation process. 		Learn more about the plans here: https://t.co/3RcuKlkYzr. #ShowMeTheData
RT @EdDataCampaign: We are loving this conversation! Let’s now move on to our third and final question of the day. #ShowMeTheData https://t…
A2: We encourage all parents to pay attention to discipline data: https://t.co/0dlUGQQxMI 		2014 data from @TheJusticeDept shows that Black children are suspended more often than their peers for the same infractions. States must work to combat this inequity. #ShowMeTheData
A2: Disaggregated data shines a light on deficiencies in schools, allowing parents and advocates to use this information as a tool to target school resources and support groups that have been failed by our public education system. #ShowMeTheData
A2: The Urban League fought for key civil rights provisions during #ESSA negotiations, namely for disaggregated data, because some states mask the performance of Black students.
A2: A key benefit of state report cards is having “disaggregated data.” Disaggregated data shows how individual groups of students are performing, including black, Latinx, English language learners, and low-income. #ShowMeTheData
RT @EdDataCampaign: What a great start to our chat, thank you for those fantastic responses! Moving on, here’s the second question. #ShowMe…

A1: For some parents, the state report card may be the only opportunity to engage w/their child’s school. States have a responsibility to ensure that every parent, regardless of income, race or knowledge can use state report cards to advocate for their students. #ShowMeTheData
A1: Quality state report cards matter more than ever because #ESSA shifted power to  each state to develop local education policies that better meet the needs of all students without federal intervention. #ShowMeTheData
A1: The nation’s public school system largely has not worked for Black &amp; brown families. 		Reliable, public data on how schools are performing to meet the needs of students across many measures is key for parents to best advocate for their children’s education. #ShowMeTheData
RT @EdDataCampaign: Here’s our first question to kick off the conversation! Don’t forget to use A1 and #ShowMeTheData in your answer. #Show…
