It’s official. Cumberland River Hospital is the latest hospital to close due to Tennessee not expanding Medicaid – the most per capita of any state in the country. This isn’t a ranking we should be proud of. The effects are setting in.	https://t.co/IL4UNvl9rt https://t.co/JQQ9QWJPdR
I encourage you to visit the Civil Rights Room at the downtown @NowatNPL or take a Civil Rights walking tour to draw inspiration for working toward a more just and civil society.
The lunch counter sit-ins and Freedom Rides, led by students who would later become iconic leaders in the movement, were pivotal moments that ultimately led to desegregation of all public facilities in Nashville and inspired protests across the South.
As Black History Month draws to a close, let us all remember the significant role that Nashville played during the Civil Rights Movement.

While Senate passage is also likely, Trump is certain to veto the measure. Not enough Republicans are willing to do the right thing and stand up to Trump, so a veto override will likely fail. It will probably be up to the courts to keep his power in check.

The President only invoked security concerns because he didn’t want to negotiate with Congress, even a Republican Congress. But the Constitution requires negotiation.
President Trump’s own Secretary of Defense, Gen. Mattis, said that Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum were not due to security concerns. I trust a Marine General like Mattis on this.
Presidents are sometimes tempted to declare a national security emergency when there is, in fact, no danger. This has, unfortunately, happened with trade policy.
I am cosponsoring the Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act of 2019, which requires Congress to pre-approve tariffs impacting national security and limit eligible goods to materials used in military equipment, energy resources, and critical infrastructure.
It’s official. We’ve hit double digits - the most per capita in the country. Meanwhile, our state legislature can’t muster the energy to even follow other solidly Republican states (NE, ID, UT). Expanding Medicaid would help our hospitals and countless Tennesseans. https://t.co/b5ZBHFCrRD

It’s good the government will reopen so people can get paid and back to work. But Congress still has a job to do to make sure this doesn’t happen again in three weeks. We need to find a sensible solution so that shutdowns never happen. #NoBudgetNoPay

The House has now voted 10 times to end the shutdown. It’s now up to the Senate. It’s time to reopen the government and get people back to work. My #NoBudgetNoPay bill would stop members from being paid if they don’t do their jobs and fix this shutdown problem for good.

Congress and the White House need to pass No Budget No Pay so that this never happens again.
The House and Senate did the right thing and passed a bill to ensure federal workers impacted by the shutdown will eventually get paid. But it doesn't help them right now, and the government should not have shut down in the first place.

The best way to resolve the dispute and reopen government is to stop paying Congress and the White House negotiators so that they are treated like the furloughed government workers. My No Budget, No Pay bill should become law again.
We need to better police the massive entry points like Laredo, El Paso, and San Diego where thousands of trucks move every day, often hiding drugs and people.
There are better, cheaper ways to secure our borders than by spending $5 billion on a longer wall on our Southern border, when we already have 700+ miles of wall.
Thank you, Governor Haslam. You did the right thing. Cyntoia Brown's case was tragic. https://t.co/bELGREImVW
This bill would prevent House and Senate members from receiving their salary if they miss annual deadlines for budget and appropriations bills, and would force members to work together to pass bipartisan legislation and prevent damaging government shutdowns.
Yesterday I reintroduced No Budget, No Pay. Congress is the only place in America where you can get paid for showing up, but not doing your work. I'd rather reward members for good behavior, but the reality is when you take away their pay, Congress finds a way to do its job.
Now that the House has done its job and passed bills to reopen the government, the Senate should follow suit. Congress should never let the government shut down. America is the greatest nation on earth, and it is embarrassing we are so poorly managed.
Voters ought to be able to choose their elected officials—not the other way around. The redistricting process is rigged and we need to fix it.
Only 20% of House districts are considered competitive and the number of “swing seats” has dwindled to a record low of 72 out of 435. On the flip side, more than 58% of House districts are considered extremely partisan. https://t.co/xRQIrPGut5
Today I reintroduced two bills to reform the redistricting process. These bills would increase transparency and significantly limit the secretive practice of gerrymandering.
I hope our new House leadership will chart a sensible course, and show all of America that we are up to the job.
We should use this opportunity to help all Americans have a brighter future. If we do a good job getting America back on track, we will more likely win the White House and a majority-Democratic U.S. Senate in 2020.
This is the way America’s 200-year-old two-party system of checks and balances is supposed to work: speaking truth to power and competing to help the average voter.
I am very excited about the new Democratic majority. Finally, the Republican monopoly on power in Washington is over. Now, one half of one of the three branches of government will be able to stand up to President Trump when he is wrong.
Today I voted “present” in the vote for Speaker of the House, consistent with my eight-year push for new Democratic leadership. Now that we are back in the majority, I did not vote for a rival candidate because there are none.
New Congress, more representative of our nation than ever before. We have a lot to do so let’s get to work. https://t.co/wJoVmRCHWP
President Trump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government if he didn't get what he wanted from a Republican-led Congress. He then made a deal that he has now abandoned. This chaos does not make America great; it puts our nation in danger. https://t.co/YbSKvFqp74

The fact that Putin is supportive of this decision should be an indication that it is an alarming idea. https://t.co/t9PQJzSXLl
Revealing our military strategy to everyone in the world, including our enemies, is an avoidable error Trump himself has mocked in the past.
We also should not abandon our Kurdish allies who have been working tirelessly beside us in the fight against ISIS.
President Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria is impulsive and irresponsible. National security experts believe ISIS is still a threat, and the removal of our troops will create a power vacuum in the Middle East.
I hope and pray Gov. Haslam will commute Cyntoia Brown’s sentence.

On the world stage, President Trump said he believes Vladimir Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Another disgraceful embarrassment that all Republicans should denounce, but likely won’t. Why?
Most importantly, people are sick of nominees who may look good on TV, but seem programmed to stealthily turn back the clock on our individual rights. Kavanaugh was already rejected twice by the Senate in 2003 and 2005 for judgeships; I doubt he will be confirmed this time.
Additionally, Americans don’t want a court that overwhelmingly comes from three Ivy League schools. This was a chance to increase representation on the court and let others have a seat at the table.
Although House members don’t vote on Supreme Court picks, I think Americans are tired of a court that doesn’t look like them. Kavanaugh would be the 108th white male justice. https://t.co/rEgTQxs4dw

Proud to join all House Democrats &amp; 41 Republicans in defeating an anti-family immigration bill: https://t.co/b10dvbuVxR
The bill I opposed:	 	• Did nothing to stop family separations.	• Did nothing to reunify families recently separated at the border.	• Included no permanent solution for Dreamers.	• Eliminated the ability of U.S. citizens to sponsor their parents, adult children &amp; siblings.
This bill is too cruel to support and it doesn’t do anything to reunite families already separated at the border. We could be voting on bipartisan bills that would begin to solve some of our nation’s immigration problems, but House Republican leadership won’t allow us to do that.
The children must be reunited with their parents. https://t.co/Nbp22PpYiv

@MrSelbrade Good question! Can't take effect until the next Congress.
My No Budget, No Pay Act is just one solution to get Congress to perform better and we know it works. We need to keep the government up-and-running, but not like this.
Otherwise, we will be back in the same untenable shutdown position on February 8th. Funding the government in small increments is malpractice. Congress should pass a budget on time – every year – or face consequences.
This was a vote to provide health coverage for 9 million children and to send federal workers back to the job. An immigration deal must be made over the next several weeks. The Alexander/Murray health care bill should come to the floor.
@_tiffany_d I wish I could! The House is still in session because of the shutdown.
Inspired by those marching, organizing and preparing for a better 2018. In Nashville, DC and beyond, the #WomensMarch movements give us hope. https://t.co/ponmOXJCFe
Most of my staff will be furloughed for the duration of a shutdown, but my offices will remain open Monday to Friday. Middle Tennesseans can reach the Nashville office at 615-736-5295 and the Washington office at 202-225-4311 during normal business hours.
that Senate Republican leadership could include like Alexander/Murray on health care or Graham/Durbin on immigration. Then the House should go along and keep the government operating.
Senate Republicans and Democrats should compromise with each other fast before any more damage is done to the country. Then the House should pass what the Senate passes. There are plenty of existing compromises
It is popular to criticize government, and to pretend that we don’t need it. But we are the greatest nation on earth because of our people and, also, partly because of our government, so it is a tragic mistake to harm either.
Late at night, on a weekend, few people will notice that our government has shut down. But our nation’s enemies will notice, as will our increasingly worried allies. When government is shut down for more than a few days, every American will start noticing the damage.
The federal government will shut down tonight at midnight if the Senate cannot find the 60 votes necessary to keep government operating. Never before in American history has this happened when one political party controls both the White House and Congress.
Cooper Calls to Limit Congressional Pay if Government Shuts Down		I cosponsored this bill early last year. Never more relevant than right now. https://t.co/iJvD2mwf01
Over and over, House Republicans have ignored law-abiding young people brought to America through no fault of their own. They did it again tonight with their fourth short-term spending bill in four months. We need a permanent legislative solution to protect Dreamers.

Rep. McDaniel is retiring this year, but his legacy could include saving thousands of Tennesseans and our rural hospitals.

By not learning the lessons of history, Republicans are doomed to repeat history’s mistakes. This bill simply must be stopped!
Without bipartisanship, Republicans will be repeating mistakes of previous partisan reform efforts, which Republicans have long criticized.
He has been trying but has been betrayed by his own political party. Apparently, now, even he has given up. That is a tragic mistake.
A better course of action would have been to let our own senator, Lamar Alexander, complete his efforts to craft a bipartisan health bill.
America deserves better and I'm working to persuade enough Republicans w/ a soul to stop this devastatingly partisan attack on all Americans
To call this a "states’ rights" approach to health reform is a lie. It's a race to the bottom, with each state competing to be crueler.
Almost everyone who knows anything about health care is strongly against this bill.
Bill makes false promises that will hurt at least 32 mil Americans, and hurt them very soon. How many hundreds of thousands are Tennesseans?

Earlier estimates were right, but they voted for it anyway. How does this make America healthier?
Obamacare provided 20 million with health insurance. 3 weeks after Republicans passed Trumpcare, we find out 23 million will lose coverage.
Now we know for sure: This is a disaster. https://t.co/LSDZ0nl4T7
Thankfully, every president’s budget is nothing more than a glorified wish list. I am especially happy this one is dead on arrival.
Other than wealthy Americans expecting new tax cuts, it’s hard to find people who wouldn’t be hurt if Congress passed the Trump budget.

That would be the way the U.S. Senate is supposed to function. To my senate colleagues, I say, give it a try.
A better course of action would be to hold real hearings on Obamacare, and to make a serious, bipartisan effort to fix any of its problems.
The CBO analysis of the House bill indicates it will hurt 24 million Americans. This short-circuiting the Senate could do even more damage.
What once was viewed as the world's greatest deliberative body is being reduced to a shadow of its former self, under current leadership.
Is this any way to run the U.S. Senate? No. This is an abomination.
We read in The New York Times that they might accept emailed comments. What is this new process? An email hearing?
They are deliberately omitting Republican women senators &amp; Republican physician senators. And, of course, omitting all Democratic senators.

He had the courage to understand the system and to reform it, and the charm to get along with everyone he met.
People talk about character but Clayton McWhorter had it. He did well and good at the same time. I am just sorry he never ran for governor.
People will be telling John Jay stories for generations, loving the vitality, grace &amp; charm of perhaps the most unique figure in TN history.
