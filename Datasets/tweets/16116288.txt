No one tells high school baseball players to pass up millions and go to college. Same for tennis players. Or singers. Or actors. Or musicians. But there is always a different standard for basketball and football players. WHY? Hmmm.
Charles asks when did basketball become all about the money? It has ALWAYS been about the money, except when it comes to the players. This system tells the laborer, do it for the love of the game. Not the university or the team owner. It’s all about the Benjamins.
I love my man Charles Barkley, but some facts are vital. Who was one of the first to say @ZionW32 should stop playing at Duke? Tracy McGrady, who also played in the NBA. Charles is right on players in his being in college for 3-4 years, but it was frowned upon. https://t.co/qqElQrnaJQ

Headed to holla at my man @FRANKSKI to discuss my #SchoolChoiceIsTheBlackChoice town hall in ATL tonight. It is free and open to the public. We will live stream it on #RolandMartinUnfiltered from 6-8 pm EST. #BringTheFunk
I just think if @delta or @tsa @asktsa removes something from your bag, at least tell ya! Now I’m scrambling to get a toothbrush before I go do morning radio in ATL.
WTH? I’m gonna need @Delta or @TSA @AskTSA to explain why in the hell my electric toothbrush is NOT in my toiletries kit? The cap and the charger are here, but someone removed the toothbrush yesterday. No note. NOTHING. And it was not cheap! https://t.co/vf1j8hfyQ3

@KaNuri @TezlynFigaro @sincereluvdagod @JoyAnnReid @donlemon Last lesson of the day: Limbaugh is a media PERSONALITY. I'm a journalist. One who can give opinions and be subjective. OK. Back to focusing on my #RolandMartinUnfiltered show rundown. See ya at 6 pm EST! Or did I hurt your feelings, KaNuri, with these tweets?
@KaNuri @TezlynFigaro @sincereluvdagod @JoyAnnReid @donlemon Do you know what I find to be laughable? Y'all have no problem when folks lie, make up stuff and say BS on Twitter, but when I fire back, your sensibilities are hurt and you want to cry like a baby. And Bernard and Max were news anchors. I can give opinions. Learn the difference.

@TheDailyInc @sincereluvdagod @TezlynFigaro @JoyAnnReid @donlemon Except that we do. I know I do. Do y'all just make up shit for the fun of it?
@chesterhicks @SharonCapel No I'm not. Y'all can't make up your minds. You trash folks who aren't fully ADOS, but then you fully accept some. Stop dancing! The point I'm making is that it's stupid to criticize someone because their lineage includes Black immigrants, but then claim some immigrants.

@karenhunter @BishopKDMcLean @SXMUrbanView November 2013 you were trying to promote an author of yours. You DM'd me. I asked to have you by Skype and the author on set. That was one of several times I tried to have you on.
@karenhunter @BishopKDMcLean @SXMUrbanView that's not true, Karen. When we had NewsOneNow, I specifically said to you when you were in DC to let me know so that we can have you on our panel. The same now.
@BridgetPhetasy @StalkingsSilk @BreeNewsome Where I come from, grown ass men don't snitch. They despise criminal elements on their streets and they form civic clubs and neighborhood patrols and work with police. I'm the product of a grown ass man and woman who did that in Clinton Park in Houston. I'm not afraid of ANYONE.
@GregLStarks @SenSanders @BernieSanders The dance was a joke. It was literally a joke at the end of a one-hour panel. But you fell for the okey doke by those who hated her so much, they lied. About that and the hot sauce.
@GregLStarks @SenSanders @BernieSanders I'm not attacking him "vehemently." I have criticized this VERY specific issue for the last three years. Second, you fell for the okey doke about @HillaryClinton and hot sauce. Dude, there were stories done on her regarding her hot sauce infatuation when she was FIRST LADY.

And let’s be clear @BrittMcHenry. Your whining about being a conservative media victim got you more headlines than anything you did as a journalist. So you might want to stop the high and mighty act with @Kaepernick7.

It’s interesting how all of these cable news shows today were running with the “@JussieSmollett lied!” Headlines. Has CPD officially said a word? Nope. Will the truth come out? Yep. So folks need to learn to wait. It’s not that hard.
I’ve reached out to @JussieSmollett several times. Have not heard back. And I’m good with that. You’ve got folks saying he paid these guys to attack him. NO ONE has said that on-the-record. Again, let CPD do their job. Then DA Kimm Foxx has her job to do. Speculation is a waste.
Here is what is interesting about the drama surrounding @JussieSmollett: I don’t have to get caught up in running multiple stories of what “sources” are saying about the case. I can wait for the Chicago police to make their official statement. I’m very good with patience.
