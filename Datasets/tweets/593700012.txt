Heroin is completely banned! You can't own it, buy it, sell it, keep it at home or in a safe, in your car, or on your person. How is it possible?!? Maybe gun bans don't work either. #gunsensevoter #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/OJBazAvmTK 	Heroin deaths surpass gun homicides
#SCOTUS made a decision that Unions can't steal worker's hard earned money or enslave them as members against their will. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #WalkAway https://t.co/WBiGPsmULs
The Democrat Party doesn't care about any issues that they can't exploit for votes, contributions, or furthering their socialist agenda. What does that tell you about their sincerity on issues they say they care about? #WalkAway #MAGA #Midterms2018 #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease https://t.co/SDz4EbTNSL

The Left said that about the Marine Corps for 40 years calling for it's disbandment. Illegal immigration is both a foreign &amp; domestic threat &amp; any effective force at defending the U.S.A. from enemies foreign or domestic is considered by the Left as being a threat to them as well. https://t.co/LyUWFgTUlS
