@TrackingPhil After the masters the schedule is pretty clear. Wells Fargo, PGA, and Memorial.
@TrackingPhil Well he‚Äôs not playing two tournaments in a row before the masters. Assuming he doesn‚Äôt play Bay Hill, he might go players and Valero. Or just players. Or just match play üòÇ
@TrackingPhil At least in the past 3 years
@TrackingPhil True but he‚Äôs had more success in Austin than he‚Äôs had at Sawgrass. He also might play at Valero which is either before or after Augusta

@TrackingPhil Alright let‚Äôs get it. This is the stretch
@TrackingPhil Then again at 6 üôÉüôÉüôÉ Phil can make this day a while lot better though.
@TrackingPhil Unfortunately, I‚Äôve got class until 5:15 CT. Phil better be at least -3 when I‚Äôm done.
@TrackingPhil Come on Phil
@TrackingPhil Good to see you Tracker üëãüèº
@TrackingPhil There he is.
@TrackingPhil Fixing to whoop J.T‚Äôs a** again?
@TrackingPhil @ScooterOkula https://t.co/KnFMaBYsU0
@VC606 @FreddieJac Good to see him playing well
@TrackingPhil Looking forward to it. Who knows... maybe you‚Äôll get to change you profile pic in Sunday üòâ
@TrackingPhil In my opinion, I think 57 is obtainable somewhere. I don‚Äôt think, however, that there will ever be a 56 or lower.
@TrackingPhil All joking aside, you can go low on TPC Scottsdale
@GolfChannel Amazing golfer. Even better up and down.
@ConnorMcCarty23 @TrackingPhil Looks like he just ran a marathon üòÇ
@TrackingPhil A disappointing 68. Why disappointing? Because he‚Äôll make pars on holes that he should‚Äôve made biride on.
@TrackingPhil Yep ok... he‚Äôs about to kick some a**.
@simpsonwhnt @spann would end us all. üòÇ
@Rodcox84 Yeah I‚Äôll pass. The wind chill up here in far northwest Tennessee should be between -5 and -10. That‚Äôs as low as I‚Äôll go.

@TrackingPhil See you Thursday. Good vibes leading up.
@VC606 Is Spieth moving up or down?
@TrackingPhil If I was Phil, just for üí© and giggles, I‚Äôd have Tim run up say on the short par 3 at pebble and tend it.
@TrackingPhil Oh Hideki! üßê
@TrackingPhil Rose long grass. The golfing gods are teasing us.
@TrackingPhil Hold your horses. There‚Äôs a little bit of drama.
@TrackingPhil Exactly because otherwise, Rose will layup and Rahm and Scott will go for it but with no real pressure. Don‚Äôt forget about Gooch though. He‚Äôs 3 back and certainly within striking distance to post something.
@TrackingPhil I don‚Äôt want to wish any bad luck on Rosey but I also don‚Äôt like runaway victories. I like drama, especially this week with the finishing hole.

@TrackingPhil Looked like he struck it cleanly, just the ball is going to get airborne more out of the first cut.
@TrackingPhil Poor decision in my opinion
@GCTigerTracker We appreciate your enthusiasm TT
@TrackingPhil https://t.co/jhZdHDwYuu
@TrackingPhil @finau_tony @RickieLegion I‚Äôll tell you one thing, Spieth can‚Äôt afford to not play tournaments that he usually plays in.
@TrackingPhil @finau_tony @RickieLegion Sure but a lot of other really big names missing.
@Rodcox84 I like to say it‚Äôs been consistently inconsistent üòÇ showing one idea for 3 runs and then switching to another idea for 3 runs and then something else.
@NWSMemphis Dusting in Martin.
@Rodcox84 Certainly doesn‚Äôt look as impressive for NW Tennessee.
@WBBJ7TomMeiners light snow in Martin with a dusting on the grass.
@TrackingPhil Can‚Äôt wait.
@TrackingPhil If Phil happened to get a hole-in-one, there would be an earthquake in Arizona.
@TrackingPhil Agreed. Also I‚Äôm not sure what, if any, Majors DL3 is qualified for but I can certainly see him catching fire.
@TrackingPhil Any older players you think have a chance at the majors. (Besides Phil because we all know the answer to that üòâ) Say Couples at Augusta or Harrington at the Open.
@TrackingPhil Oh god. Spieth is gonna blow up and shoot a 78 or something.
@TrackingPhil @GCTigerTracker Now do that for Phil more often
@GregThornerGolf I‚Äôve always played with the pin in. Just habit. The knee high drop is what‚Äôs going to trip me up.

Light rain and gusty winds in Martin. @WBBJ7TomMeiners

@TrackingPhil Hard to say; there‚Äôs so many courses that he loves to play at. Out of Pebble (twice üòâ), WMO, Mexico, Augusta, and Southwind, I‚Äôd go with a title defense at Mexico.

Significant severe weather is likely across the Deep South and southeast. The greatest risk will be the tan enhanced risk, but keep in mind, storms don‚Äôt know where these lines are so everyone needs to pay attention to the weather. Nocturnal (maybe strong) tornadoes are possible. https://t.co/i54Xrxh3iE
Latest run of the GFS continues to show a deep, negatively-tilted upper level trough northwest of St. Louis with a trailing cold front. Significant wind shear (turning of the wind with height) and strong instability could lead to a rather robust November severe weather day. https://t.co/HtCgLk5Lrn
@Rodcox84 @NWSSPC Yes it certainly is never a good thing to see this type of setup when we are actually relatively close to the event for forecasting purposes. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre a week out.

If you‚Äôre looking for snow, well we have plenty of cold air. However, precipitation should be below average. January 6 to January 12 , however, looks like an opportunity for maybe some winter weather mischief. Still a lot can change. https://t.co/u5h1vLLDd4

@StormTrackBrian Brian, is the GFS hinting at maybe some ice concerns for the viewing area? Maybe hinting at warmer air in the upper levels?
If we can get some snow, more than likely it‚Äôs going to stick around for a while. Dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills are forecasted for much of next week. Please use caution and stay inside if you can. https://t.co/PCh3f25OQO
@StormTrackBrian I thought the Euro was more reliable? We‚Äôll just have to see. I‚Äôve got my popcorn in hand for the next GFS run.
@StormTrackBrian Could the models trend wetter
@Rodcox84 @G8RMET I live in southeast tn
@Rodcox84 @G8RMET 1-3 inches
@Rodcox84 @sgrimmett6 @G8RMET That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing
@Rodcox84 @G8RMET I totally agree. I would love see all of the Euro maps.
@Rodcox84 @G8RMET New run of the Euro should come in within the next hour or two
@Rodcox84 @G8RMET Yes. This system is currently near Alaska.
@G8RMET @Rodcox84 However I‚Äôm also seeing that the GFSis trending dryer. They could meet in the middle and put down maybe an inch or two
@spann Could the argument be made that the Euro is trending wetter? Wasn‚Äôt it, at one point, bone dry?
@StormTrackBrian Slower and dryer https://t.co/sxblMpQJIE
Brand new run of the European still shows no snow for the south. GFS does. New run of the GFS should be out in about 4 hours. https://t.co/mnIFqSDHVU
@StormTrackBrian I guess the safe forecast for now would be cold with a chance of some precipitation.
@StormTrackBrian Has there ever been this much disagreement between the global models before? I can‚Äôt believe how different the two really are.
We‚Äôll probably see the coldest air of the season around the new year. Temperatures 20-30 degrees below average. Wind chills could be below 0 in the southeast. https://t.co/oWeRW0PtGf
@spann The snow totals put down but the GFS are absurd.
@autumblrish
The two global are disagreeing like an old married couple. The GFS says yes to snow on New Year‚Äôs Eve. The European (ECMWF) says no. It is completely dry. The European does have a better track record for forecasting winter events.  GFS on the left, Euro on the right. https://t.co/9pXNz4KIkh

Latest run of the GFS suggests snow for parts of the southeast next Sunday. Uncertainty abounds however, it‚Äôs something that needs to be monitored. To soon to talk about amounts but this run suggests 2-4 inches. Take this with mounds of salt. https://t.co/5We97bwyHq
Global models are indicating that the much of the southeast should be warm enough for just rain. However, a cold air damming situation could unfold for north Georgia and the Carolinas. So an ice storm could be in the works to or east. But I‚Äôm closely watching next wknd. https://t.co/g3eztGNuH6

I am monitoring a potential winter weather system to potentially impact the southeast US for late next week and into the weekend. Confidence is low but it‚Äôs something that bears watching.

@NWSMemphis There's no way that it is vehicles! 2 has the circle at the end of the radar loop so that tells me that's it either birds or bats.
@NWSMemphis Well it must be something pretty massive to give the red pink color. How about an airplane since the radar beam is lofted.
@NWSMemphis 1 looks like it has a hail core.
@NWSMemphis I might have to change my answer because I would rather get sunburnt then get frost bitten

@spann any reason why enterprise and troy aren't included in the tornado watch?
@NWSMorristown Bradley county will be added shortly.
@NWSMorristown will this upcoming tornado watch include all of southeast Tennessee?
@nmcdougal12 how stupid are you?
@NWSMorristown @spann the forecast is starting to verify in a disturbing way.
@NWSMorristown starting to see brighter spots in the clouds
@NWSMorristown the rain has stopped in Cleveland. I'm sure the sun will break out in a little bit. Not a good sign.
@spann what about a high risk for southeast Tennessee
@spann @NWSMorristown @NWSBirmingham @NWSHuntsville @NWSAtlanta @NWSSPC thanks for all that you guys do. Really appreciated.
@spann totally agree. I don't like the torcon
@spann I think that the moderate risk will be expanded into Tennessee. It look like the STP is pretty high up here.
@spann I know you don't like to use analogs with current events, but does the event tomorrow look like the April 10, 2009 event?
@ Does it appear likely that a moderate risk will be issued for southeast Tennessee?
@NWSMorristown Is there good reason to believe that the tornado threat could go up on Wednesday. Looks like the STP is a little high.
RT @TheNewArena: All 32 Starting NFL Quarterbacks Ranked From Worst To First  https://t.co/yvJgFaIZEX
@NWSMorristown well unfortunately, it wouldn't be spring in Tennessee without severe weather
@NWSMorristown so what you're saying is " let's get through tomorrow's event before we can focus on Wednesday "
@NWSMorristown what are the odds of severe weather on Wednesday?
@spann isn't just a joy to forecast severe weather in the southeast When one model says one thing and another model says something different
@NWSMemphis don't y'all find it odd that the spc had a moderate risk for y'all yesterday and now it's dropped to a slight risk. Weather=wild
@NWSMemphis I know it's a little early but what about the severe for Sunday-Monday?
@NWSMorristown is the tornado threat for Cleveland low? It appears that the storms will form into a line when they reach us.
@NWSMemphis could the higher severe weather probs be shifted over parts of eastern Tennessee
@spann it seems like the bad severe weather risks are bypassing the southeast. Not saying that slight risks shouldn't be taking seriously.
@NWSMorristown well the enhanced risk came out of nowhere
@NWSMorristown severe weather this weekend?

@spann There's so many different weather outlets all of which are reliable that use  terminology like significant severe weather outbreak
@NWSMorristown does the upcoming severe weather event have the characteristics of a derecho?
@spann does the upcoming severe weather event have the characteristics of a derecho. Also I enjoyed weather brains last night.
@NWSMorristown do you think a moderate risk is appropriate? The fact that we were an enhanced risk of day 4 is pretty significant.
@spann let's hope it stays an enhanced risk. I don't want anything above that
Calling the game #bearettesvsladycavs
@spann Ok thanks. I'll have to start watching your videos
@spann Do you think an enhanced risk will be issued for somebody? If not why?
@finebaum UT is finally going to win the east... hopefully
@NWSMorristown what are the chances of severe weather for the weekend. @NWSBirmingham already has an elevated risk for central AL.
