Trump description of the Green New Deal is false. No one has proposed eliminating cars or plane rights or cows. Here's a smart explainer by @rizzoTK of what is -- and isn't -- in the policy https://t.co/rJDmbvPLtU
Trump says El Paso's leaders are "full of crap" when they say the wall didn't lower crime.		In fact, crime stats show El Paso was one of America's safest cities before fencing in late 2000's and after, no demonstrable change in violent crime.
RT @vmsalama: “That was a very important thing we did,” President Trump says regarding the government shutdown, saying that it highlighted…
Trump: “As I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway.”
Safe to say Green New Deal will be a staple of Trump's 2020 stump speech: “I really don’t like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights, of let’s hop a train to California, of you’re not allowed to own cows anymore," he said to cheers in El Paso.
Trump seems to have had enough with @GlennKesslerWP and his (sometimes Bottomless) Pinocchios: “Some of the most dishonest people in media are the so-called fact checkers," POTUS says at El Paso rally.
Rowdy crowd in El Paso tonight: In first 20 mins of Trump's speech, three interruptions by demonstrators. POTUS mocks them: "They go back home to Mommy. They get punished when they get home."
Trump: “A young man who’s got very little going for himself except he’s got a great first name, he challenged us." Notes his crowd is bigger than Beto's and adds, "I would say that may be the end of his presidential bid.”

Trump claims that “many” federal workers want the government to stay closed: "Many of those workers have said to me, communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall."
Trump on the wall: “There may be a case of an Olympic champion who may get over the wall, but for the most part, you’re not going to be able to do it.”
Trump this morning on the wall: “While we’re fighting over funding, we’re also building, and it’s my hope to have this done, completed, all 500 to 550 miles, to have it either renovated or brand new by election day.”

RT @jdawsey1: “It is what it is,” Potus says of Khashoggi killing and Saudi Arabia while leaving the White House.
Here is Fred Ryan’s full statement on Khashoggi https://t.co/EIDx2dSc2K https://t.co/AFDLbep4b5
It’s worth noting that Trump’s Saudi statement stands in contrast not only with the CIA’s assessment, but also with the longstanding values of his VP. For many years, Pence has championed freedom of the press in the US and abroad.
Statement from Wash Post Publisher Fred Ryan: “President Trump’s response to the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is a betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights and the expectation of trust and honesty in our strategic relationships.”
A signal to dictators everywhere that they will face no consequences for brutally murdering journalists or critics because it’s simply “a mean, nasty world” https://t.co/u4DoYMXens

Trump: “Birthright citizenship, you know all about it, we will keep the criminals, the drug dealers, we will keep them all out of our country. We will get rid of all of this. We will end, finally, birthright citizenship.”
As Trump boasts about creating a sixth branch of the military — “Space Force!” — many in the crowd laugh, as if they’re in on a joke or something.
As expected, birthright citizenship has made its way into Trump’s closing argument stump speech. He called it a “crazy policy” and is speaking at length about “criminal aliens” and “illegal immigrant children.”

Calling out local congressmen Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz, Trump says nothing to praise their records on behalf of Florida, but rather cheers their defenses of him on cable TV.		“I love it when he defends me,” Trump says of Rooney. “He’s brutal. He gets the job done!”
Crowd cheers loudly when Trump says he intends to catch the Central American migrants in the caravan and not release them. “It’s called catch, but we take the word release out.”
Trump calls next week’s midterms “one of the most important elections of our entire lives — though I will say, not as important as 2016!”
Trump at Florida rally says: “33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact — and I hate to say this — in fact the enemy of the people.”		Crowd of thousands on their feet roars.

White House message, delivered twice so far by Sarah Sanders: “The very first action the president did was condemn these heinous acts. The very first thing that the media did was condemn the president.”

Trump is telling the stories of police officers from Texas, Illinois &amp; Florida who engaged and captured shooters and calling them onto the stage for praise.
Trump tries to pit thousands of law enforcement officers against the media. Loud applause, some standing and staring at press pen, as Trump shames “the media” for not reporting on how much Americans love law enforcement.

Loud applause from law enforcement officials — though some sat stone-faced and did not clap — as Trump celebrates confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, "who will be a faithful defender of the rule of law."
Trump says he’s instructed Attorney General’s Office to immediately go to Chicago to solve shooting wave. He calls for “Stop &amp; Frisk” in Chicago. "It works and it was meant for problems like Chicago,” Trump says.
Trump says “it’s disgraceful” that some politicians “attack” law enforcement. “Politicians who spread this dangerous, anti-police sentiment make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for law-abiding citizens,” Trump tells International Association of Chiefs of Police.
Trump, on stage in Orlando, jokes that Rod Rosenstein traveling with him aboard Air Force One became “a very big story.”		“We had a very good talk, I will say,” Trump says.
Trump is about to take the stage at the International Association of Chiefs of Police convention in Orlando. Thousands of law enforcement in attendance, many uniformed. It’ll be interesting to see if Trump makes his speech political and takes a 30-days-til-election victory lap.
