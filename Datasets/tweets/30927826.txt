CDC says they are continuing to work on climate change despite the consolidation and name change. But @PEERorg attorneys say some of the climate researchers are spending the bulk of their time now on asthma. Stay tuned.
.@PEERorg attorneys say CDC wanted to keep a low profile on climate in the Trump era. CDC wouldn't discuss, saying they can't comment on personnel issues. But a cpl hours after @BySheilaKaplan and I reached out to agency officials for comment, Luber's termination was rescinded.
He also said superiors told him to stop using the phrase "climate change" and instead talk about "extreme weather." And that he raised concerns that CDC was misappropriating money by using congressionally-funded climate dollars for asthma research.
Here's Luber's side, according to @PEERorg: He said he was targeted b/c he objected to canceling a climate conference after Trump was elected. @scottpwaldman at @EENewsUpdates broke that story way back when: https://t.co/RVaOjxyI58.
The CDC initially tried to fire him on charges that included falsifying time cards &amp; not getting proper ethics approval to write a book. Luber has denied all the charges and his attorneys w/ @PEERorg say he was targeted b/c he wouldn't stop talking about climate change
Meanwhile the former head of the program, George Luber, has been sent to work in an office on waterborne diseases. He's kind of a big deal in the climate world - you might have seen him on @YEARSofLIVING with Matt Damon. https://t.co/CPxLuYR3yB

@citizenjeff @l1mb0 @Bjornapoor @JenniferJJacobs @SecretService I do, and from a source more reliable than the WH press sec. Too many inconsistencies.
@citizenjeff @l1mb0 @Bjornapoor @JenniferJJacobs @SecretService It‚Äôs not hard to believe - but I‚Äôd still like to understand what led the service to decide a 55 min drive was not feasible logistically or security-wise, yet was ok for Kelly and Gen. Dunford. And going back to @JenniferJJacobs orig point: WH has lost so much credibility by now..
@l1mb0 @Bjornapoor @JenniferJJacobs Like I said, I‚Äôd really like to see a well reported article on this (and would be more impressed if I read former secret service directors were calling BS). I mean obvs a bad look for Trump all around but at this point I‚Äôm just interested in how the decision was really made.

And finally it says "after evaluating a number of possible efficiency improvements, EPA is proposing a list of 'candidate technologies' that states wld need to consider in establishing the standards of performance for individual plants. States 2 determine which r appropriate
"EPA's analysis finds that coal fired power plants can reduce CO2 emissions by making on-site efficiency upgrades or 'heat rate improvements.' Efficiency upgrades reduce the amount of C02 that is released per unit of electricity generated" it says
The rule sets "emissions guidelines" for states to develop and submit to EPA plans to establish standards of performance for existing plants based on the best system of emissions reduction
4) Aligns section 111d general implementing regulations to give states adequate time and flexibility to develop their state plans
3) revises EPA's New Source Review permitting program to streamline associated efficiency improvements at existing power plants and
2) provides states with "candidate technologies" that can be used to establish standards of performance and incorporated into their state plan
OK CPP nerds this is for you: The draft outline says the proposed rule contains four main sections: 1) defining BSER for existing power plants as on-site, heat =rate efficiency improvements

Carper: "Do you agree that humans are the main cause of climate change?"	EPA nominee Peter Wright: "I agree that humans are a cause of climate change."
Sen. Ernst, who has blasted Pruitt for both his ethanol policies and his ethics issues, reminds EPA nominees that there are policies in place for aides to report complaints if they witness improprieties. Accuses Pruitt of ‚Äúunacceptable uses of taxpayer dollars.‚Äù
Inhofe: "Only in Washington can you get by with allegations against somebody and not given them a chance to respond." Inaccurate. We reach out to EPA constantly &amp; w/ detailed information about every allegation  so they can respond or challenge facts. And when we err, we correct.
Inhofe uses his time at EPA confirmation hearing for two nominees to defend Pruitt. Calls NYT "wrong," costly trips are "a lie," tickets to Rose Bowl were cleared by ethics agency. Morocco trip: "Scott Pruitt had to go to Morocco because that was his job."
Barrasso notes he chose August for the Scott Pruitt hearing because the OIG intends to wrap up several inquiries in the summer. Timing is so "we will actually have information from the inspector general when the administrator appears‚Äù
Inhofe to Carper: "You should qualify all of this by saying he has been accused of the following. I happen to know him well and I know what you‚Äôre saying is not correct." Carper: we can agree to disagree.
Sen. Inhofe who told @AriNatter his concerns abt Scott Pruitt have been allayed after a convo with the administrator, interrupted Sen. Carper as he was rattling off a litany of ethics issues: using EPA staff to help wife find a job, buy a used mattress, search for real estate.

@jonathanchait sorry just saw this. It was a follow to his comment that US would "welcome and help lead a global alliance of countries willing to make fossil fuels cleaner rather than abandoning them." I asked if this was a counterpoint to the countries that formed an alliance to phase out coal
Canadian Min. Carr is incredibly diplomatic when asked about US withdrawal impact on the Paris agreement: "We feel that climate change is real &amp;  urgent &amp;  the time for action is now. Others who may find their same route to achieve the same goal will put it in different language.
RT @JasonBordoff: Very very few people actually say this though--including all the 2 degree projections. https://t.co/B8LBIdy6PT
Could not be a bigger chasm between Perry's speech and that of Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden. "There may not be total unity behind the Paris Agreement any longer, but there is no other issue with	the potential to disrupt our industry....In response, I think we have to change."
@pdykstra And indeed he lauded Texas' wind energy boom here as well - but definitely in the context of one energy source among many (mostly fossil-based).
Rick Perry to me on many countries' plans to phase out coal: "I think it‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs errand to stand up and say by 2030 we‚Äôre going to be done with fossil fuels ‚Ä¶ and what ? Go back to living like we were living in the mid-1800s?" #CERAWeek
This is important. "We would welcome and help lead a global alliance of countries willing to make fossil fuels cleaner rather than abandoning them" Perry tells #CERAWeek
"I fear that that‚Äôs the mindset of the Paris agreement" Perry says of those who support renewables to the exclusion of fossil fuels. #CERAWeek
Haven't heard Perry talk yet about "energy dominance," Trump and Zinke's favorite term, but he does seem to be trying to coin a new phrase, "new energy realism." #CERAWeek

Basically pretty much every high-level administration #CPAC speech that mentioned the Paris Agreement today, starting with Trump himself, was a direct repudiation of this former energy advisor's position: https://t.co/6IJawrEq0W
"It took so much courage, so much fortitude to do what the president did" in pulling out of the #ParisAgreement, Pruitt tells #CPAC2018, saying the accord "was never about CO2 reduction." Says "it was all about putting our economy at a disadvantage."
Biggest accomplishment, Pruitt says of Trump: "His decision on Paris, he knocked it out of the park."
Huelskamp: "Literally thousands" of scientists say that climate risks in worldwide threat assessment are wrong, and gives a plug to Pruitt's red team/blue team idea. Almost time for Pruitt at #CPAC2018
More Huelskamp: CO2 is "not a problem" according to "thousands" of scientists and will continue to urge Pruitt to overturn the endangerment finding. #CPAC2018
"It's no longer about climate change, it's about energy freedom," new Heartland president Tim Heulskamp tells @cspan, praising Trump &amp; Pruitt. No more spending time on "environmental fictions of Al Gore."

@adoukas Nice pot shot. (Yes, it did take me all night to come up with that).
@dwkreutzer It is certainly not the view of the Paris agreement that Trump espoused this morning at CPAC! But you're suggesting he left for policy reasons. Any evidence?
"We gave them their property back. We gave them their dignity back." POTUS on WOTUS. #CPAC2018
"They call China a developing nation. But the United States we're developed." Says Paris agreement "sounds so good" ... and now we're on WOTUS, I believe.
Ummm. I guess other voices are now ascendant in the White House on the Paris agreement. https://t.co/6IJawrEq0W
"We announced our withdrawal from the totally disastrous, job killing, job knocking out..." "We knocked out the Paris climate accord. It would have been a disaster." THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE #CPAC2018
"We ended the war on American energy... and we ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. One of our great natural resources. Very important for our defense." Miners no longer being "mistreated." Trump to #CPAC2018
"No president has ever cut as many regulations in their entire term," Trump tells #CPAC2018

Sue Biniaz, longtime former @StateDept attorney who worked in both R &amp; D administrations makes an interesting point: "Paris fixes the problems Republicans had with the Kyoto Protocol ...but it probably took a Democratic administration with more climate credibility to achieve it.‚Äù
On the other hand he slams Obama's Paris target of 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 as "awful" - too high &amp; not done with transparency. Many climate activists feel the US target was far too low.
That is: developed and developing countries held to the same legal standards; bottom-up approach; not legally binding. All things the US fought hard for, often against strong opposition from EU, China &amp; others

@TheAndyHolland @busbyj2 interesting. Am looking at doing a short newsletter item on a Sue Biniaz piece that makes this same point
@DonnyFerguson how do you see the UN controlling the economy if the targets were voluntary?
@busbyj2 first it was China/India need to act if we‚Äôre acting. Ok done. Now it seems to be acting at the same pace.
@busbyj2 I agree it possibly is just more stuff said. But I see the beginnings of a new place to move the goalpost.

Trump Administration Targets Obama-Era Effort to Limit Methane https://t.co/2ws0Hf6QaH
@busbyj2 But somebody had to put some thought into the wording here, no?
And this: "The Budget proposes to wind down existing State Department and USAID bilateral programs intended primarily to help other countries mitigate the impacts of climate change." Notable that the admin does not see helping other countries cut CO2 as beneficial to the US.
So... taking this at face value, what is it the administration is saying here? Not just China but India, Brazil, South Africa... should act on an equal par with the United States?
"The Paris Agreement, as it stands, does not equally share burdens and responsibilities among the nations of the world." This line in the Trump budget may be the most explicit thing I've seen yet about what the administration dislikes about the accord. https://t.co/WVEGsl1RVi

@amenasaiyid @HMNorthey @EENewsUpdates great q and if this was a Clinton administration presumably we might be looking at a Sierra Club list
@GavinBade not sure and Murray did not recall.
Nice @ValerieVolco @davidshepardson exclusive: Trump's EPA to replace Obama-era climate, water regulations in 2018 https://t.co/ZOiyymnlzX
@bstorrow @nytimes no DOE has it too - there is more than one memo. Keep asking!
@jswatz aww thank you
Mr. Murray has spoken about this list on Frontline &amp; described its contents to E&amp;E News. A slightly different one has been photographed &amp; appeared in In These Times.  @SenWhitehouse says DOE still won't release it. Agency did not respond. https://t.co/XXOBQ4gmoI
And overhaul FERC, TVA and the NLRB... all done. But given Monday's ruling Murray does not consider the new FERC appointees something in the 'win' colum https://t.co/Sl78dah6ZE
11) Obtain legislation to fund the United Mine Workers retiree medical care &amp; pensions. Partial win: https://t.co/PVV9p6oyQm https://t.co/BKKFQNhxZG
10) Revise "arbitrary" coal mine dust regulation which "provides no health benefit to our coal workers." potentially on the chopping block: https://t.co/tku7Q6NY8F https://t.co/GUntWQ3RYx
9) Overturn the cross-state air pollution rule requiring states to reduce emissions that contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. No action (though Pruitt as AG sued to challenge) https://t.co/nHmkFLSzsN
"The Obama EPA alone wrote over 25,000 pages of rules, thirty eight (38) times the words in our Holy Bible," Murray notes. https://t.co/NG1OuFYCrg
8) Cut EPA staff "at least in half." Happening. https://t.co/xKNRA3erdK https://t.co/77hYTHzqXC
7) "Overhaul the bloated and politicized mine safety &amp; health administration" of the Labor Dept. New chief David Zatezalo, retired coal company exec, says Murray encouraged him to take the job https://t.co/CoNkSTfCbM
6) Fund highly efficient coal but not carbon capture &amp; storage. Murray: CCS is a "pseudonym for no-coal." Trump budget proposed near elimination of $$ for CCS. https://t.co/20Lva789RC
5) Ozone rule... EPA has taken steps to review. https://t.co/PJLWr0C48o
4) "Withdrawal from the illegal United Nations COP21 Paris Climate Accord." Announced but we're not out .... yet https://t.co/H00nMQM5nQ
3) Eliminate 30% production wind &amp; solar tax credits. No dice - yet. Murray argues for a "level playing field." https://t.co/kECk0pyAEp
2) "There must be a withdrawal and a suspension... of the so-called endangerment finding," the cornerstone of climate policy that says GHGs cause harm to human health. Will Pruitt try to overturn? https://t.co/HhAU4jo312
Nuggets from Murray Energy CEO's wish: 1) "The so-called Clean Power Plan must be eliminated." EPA is working on it. https://t.co/r1sFdpUcxp
