@Freeyourmindkid Meh - I'd put looks in one category and a person's competency at their job in another. Someone can't help the face they're born with, but they can control how they act and treat others.
@SigmaR3LLA @Freeyourmindkid Being petty feels good at first, but then just encourages an overall social atmosphere of criticism.
@Freeyourmindkid @e1izabethrogers I get what you're saying - and I didn't see your Steven Miller tweet. Women face more pressure about their looks than men do though, so I guess it just hit home for me.
@Freeyourmindkid Honestly, it's not Lahren's feelings that concern me - it's all of the people who see these tweets and think how they're likely less attractive than her in that picture and how others must think similarly critical thoughts about them.
@Freeyourmindkid I change my answer to  @e1izabethrogers's ! Making fun of someone's looks acts as a mechanism of social control.. conditioning women to be compliant and agreeable or else they might be subject to the same criticism. xoxo
@Freeyourmindkid Because making fun of her looks detracts from what's actually horrible about her - her words, ideas, and influence. She doesn't have my sympathy, but the act of criticizing someone for their looks is debasing.

@jeffreyhayden @MinneapolisPD @CityMinneapolis So, in Minneapolis, why not hit and run? At worst, the results are the same. There's no fear of criminal prosecution to deter people from not stopping to to exchange info. It's obscene.
@jeffreyhayden @MinneapolisPD @CityMinneapolis The person who hit me will eventually have to pay through her insurance (once I can get the police reports that purportedly have her insurance info), but she faces no additional penalties for fleeing. And I'm stuck driving an unsafe, damaged car.
@jeffreyhayden @MinneapolisPD @CityMinneapolis If fleeing the scene of an accident isn't prosecuted as a crime, then people actually have a financial incentive to flee because the person they hit may or may not be able to record their plate #. Even if they do, the result is the same.
