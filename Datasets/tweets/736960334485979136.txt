Wayne Goodwin performed best in the areas he used to represent in the NC House. Josh Stein performed best in Brunswick County - not sure why.
Best Democratic performance by county in the 2016 Council of State elections. Elaine Marshall dominated statewide, although Roy Cooper performed best in many urban/college counties. Beth Wood performed best around New Bern, the area she's from. #ncpol https://t.co/8Xz0NG7tMk
Dale Folwell carried Clay and Cherokee by the largest margins - both western NC counties in other states' media markets. Not sure why. #ncpol
Steve Troxler performed best in the Triangle metro, northeastern NC, and the Asheville metro, the only GOP Council of State candidate to win Wake and Chatham. @DanForestNC performed best in a few counties in western NC, mostly in the Charlotte and Hickory metros. #ncpol

In 2018, NC Court of Appeals shifted from 10-5 R to 8-7 R . When GOP Judge Bob Hunter retires next March, there will be a 7-7 tie. First time in NC history with tied statewide court; first time @NCGOP does not control either court since 1998. #ncpol https://t.co/9rvnWZyWxv https://t.co/Gns1FOg1Ee

From 2016 to 2018, the % of votes cast for each party in Court of Appeals races shifted 2.88% to the @NCDemParty.

In the only NC Court of Appeals this year with two candidates of the same party, Republican spoiler Sandra Ray performed best in her home base of New Hanover County. #ncpol https://t.co/wtFVDX409Z https://t.co/TAcPjO8XnN
In the second NC Court of Appeals race, attorney Toby Hampson (D) picked up a previously Republican seat by defeating two GOP candidates who split their party's vote. #ncpol https://t.co/wtFVDX409Z https://t.co/EsceFCLlNu

In this year's Supreme Court race, GOP spoiler Chris Anglin performed best in rural areas of eastern and western North Carolina where less-educated voters were least likely to research the candidates.

Before 2018, all 583 NC county commissioners were Republicans, Dems, or unaffiliated. But this year saw a Libertarian candidate win an uncontested seat in Perquimans County and a Constitution Party candidate defeat a Dem for a seat in Greene County. #ncpol https://t.co/i0BwRgl90n
In 2018, @NCGOP increased the number of commissions it controls from 55 to 57, but @NCDemParty increased the proportion of residents represented by its commissions because more people live in blue-flipping New Hanover than all the rural red-flipping counties combined. #ncpol https://t.co/rq2EJJQOlP
