Sam will be the Transportation and Infrastructure committee ranking member for the 116th Congress. 		This committee will control the oversight and standards associated with whatever the wall, if it exists, entails. 		Keep your eyes on Sam.
Ranking member of Science and Tech committee for the 116th Congress. He’s run the agriculture committee for six years so... we can look forward to him asking about suppressing crappy websites in search results.
#GymJordan ranking member of the Oversight committee for the 116th Congress. He gets a front row seat to the glaring light of governance and transparency he speaks of but never upholds. Can’t wait for Thursday.
