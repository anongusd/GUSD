Our faith institutions must again become the centerpiece of spiritual, social and political change. Push from the pews to the pulpit.
Returning from overwhelm. Remember the most powerful meds: deep breathing, real food, yoga, meditation and knowing when to say No!
Black children are 3x more likely than White to live in extreme poverty. Help @CARES_Mentoring fix this!
Poverty is the shame of the nation--and a threat to its stability. Social justice, not just charity, is the cure.
Tweeties, focus your minds on solutions. Permit faith, not fear. All thoughts will flow toward trusting God to fix things.
