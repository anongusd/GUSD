@willyQawakening @RealOmarNavarro I know election fraud is real. There is ongoing evidence currently in #NC09. The GOP campaign team did shady stuff. I have yet to learn about any voter fraud cases that have supporting evidence of the claims.

@jcdup1 @Sunshine276 @kelliwardaz @kyrstensinema Garcia ran a very liberal/progressive campaign. Sinema ran as an independent and focused on the issues that matter most to AZ. AZ rejected Garcia, and embraced Sinema. 5 out of 9 congressional districts are represented by Dems. Why is it hard to believe a Dem like Sinema can win?

Congratulations @kyrstensinema, Madam Senator-elect for Arizona! You ran an excellent campaign focused on the issues that matter to your state, rather than fear mongering tactics that are only useful for ratings!
@kelliwardaz I say congratulations Senator-elect Sinema. @kyrstensinema ran an excellent campaign focused on issues that matter to the state, rather than fear mongering tactics and using the "caravan" as a political tool to rally a base.
@jetrotter @ExDemLatina Garcia was not a goof candidate. He did not represent AZ values. Senator-elect Sinema ran an moderate/centrist campaign. She did not use fear mongering tactics. She focused on the issues. She is better representative of AZ values compared to Garcia or McSally.
@ChatByCC @kelliwardaz I whole-heartedly and sincerely believe that had it been @kyrstensinema versus @kelliwardaz, Sinema would have won by a much larger margin. Senator-elect Sinema would have won by at least 55- 60 percent.

@RepHuffman It doesn't have to be a vote between one group or the other. Congress should have by now found a solution for both issues. Congress needs to work in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open. Enough is enough.
@HawleyMO @clairecmc Or your party can work with the Democrats in good faith and find a solution to keep the government funded. Do not blame Senator @clairecmc or any other democrat senators.
@GOPChairwoman Will Republicans work in good faith for a bipartisan deal? You need Democrats to vote, then I suggest you listen to their priorities too. Simple as that!

When Transgender soldier fight for our country, they are not selective, they fight to defend us all equally, why should POTUS be selective?

@SpeakerRyan Yes, thanks to your mother and social services you excelled. Sadly, now you are trying to cut those same benefits to millions. #Hypocrisy
@TomiLahren Oh please, a billionaire that has never worked in education and cannot relate to the average person IS NOT a dedicated to improve education.
If @BetsyDeVosED spoke at my commencement ceremony, I would have also stood up and turned my back. She's not worthy of her position!
@Jackie_Blue_CA @jimmykimmel So, you are saying you care more about an unborn fetus rather than a infant with a birth defect? And you call yourself "pro-life?"
@RepMimiWalters If you think they are so amazing, you should have listened when their association said to VOTE NO on the House bill last week!
@MeekKristy @TomiLahren @POTUS Right, that's why he said "Congratulations" to a  service member that lost one of his limbs? We see right through these photo ops!
@SpeakerRyan @foxandfriends Will you be talking about the CBO report?? Oh wait, you don't have one, do you?

@RepEdRoyce so why did you not celebrate women by voting NO yesterday? You voted irresponsibly without a CBO report. Did you even read the full text?
@RepEdRoyce You rushed vote for something "far from perfect" without a CBO report? How is this a smart strategy when it affects so many constituents?
@robdelaney @Johannabotta good thing @jasoninthehouse is retiring from public office. Clearly, he doesn't represent American values!
@Kimberly122765 @whitmanconnie1 @FoxNews @MeghanMcCain @POTUS Since when is the US a Christian nation? When was there ever a declaration stating such fact?
@RepMimiWalters @JECRepublicans You should feel ashamed of yourself!
@DarrellIssa You should have voted NO period. @MikeLevinCA will proudly serve better than you and will vote in the interest of the people!
@KamalaHarris Millions of families are counting on you and your colleagues, please make us proud!
@replouiegohmert @POTUS when people start dying due to lack of healthcare, I doubt you will keep smiling that bright.
@MikeLevinCA @jonfavs @DarrellIssa I will volunteer to help you defeat @DarrellIssa. He does not represent the values of Americans.
Please @DarrellIssa, have a heart and vote NO on #AHCA. Think of the millions that will lose their health care.
Ironic that @VP speaks at #SBAgala regarding protecting the vulnerable, yet he and the @GOP want to repeal #AHCA from vulnerable groups.
@tlfhappy @POTUS @VP Hope you say the same once they strip real vulnerable people from healthcare. Let's see how caring their hearts are then!
@VP @POTUS The most vulnerable? Like the people you're trying to strip away from healthcare? Or who are you referring to? #sbagala
@VP So, you and the administration are only #prolife when "life" is the womb, but once born you want to remove healthcare from vulnerable ppl?
@VP Really? What about the millions of people you and the @GOP are vigorously working on taking their healthcare away?
@scottwongDC @jasoninthehouse What's his position? Is he a yes or no?
@GavinNewsom Thank you for all the information and activism you provide to the community. Can't wait to call you Governor.
@MikeLevinCA @DarrellIssa Just like the current administrstion, there is a lack of transparency, even with our representatives. @MikeLevinCA I hope you will do better
@DarrellIssa @10NewsCoronel If you really care about constituents, VOTE NO! #TrumpCare #SaveACA
@charliekirk11 When the @GOP Senate, that already controls the house, has to change the rules for the confirmation, is not an accomplishment, its theft.
@RepDanDonovan @POTUS Thanks to the @GOP changing the rules, otherwise the nomination wouldn't have gone through.

@FoxNews @SenTedCruz @tedcruz Deliver on the promises of helping working-class families, not on building a wall that will only waste billions of dollars and do nothing!
@RepLowenthal Of course not, #Trumpcare is a complete disaster and a total disservice to our country!
@ChelseaClinton As the great Michelle Obama said, "When they go low, we go high!" Hope you're also having a great day!
State legislators in Texas should be very ashamed, #SB4 will not make America great again, and will only instill fears in the community!
@wendycarrillo Despite not living in your district, i just want to thank you for your involvement and leadership. Us Latinos, are very proud of you!
@katiecouric @KellyannePolls Well, they had to change the rules for that, considering Republicans did not have the 60 required votes. So, not so much of a victory!
@ElizbethLManess @Electrona2020 @Ray_disComfort @Jali_Benz @Grrrregory @peplamb @realDonaldTrump Yet, another promise he didn't deliver, nor will he do it!

@Jali_Benz @POTUS @GOP @VP @jeffsessions @TGowdySC What the president was trying to do is unconstitutional. Therefore, it is the responsibility of federal judges to block those orders.
