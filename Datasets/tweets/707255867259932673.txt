@CapehartJ @chrisgarfield trump is right democratic party only insures that inner city blacks are kept beholding to government checks
@SteveRattner @realDonaldTrump @nytimes but you did screw the bond holders in favor of the Union for first time in history
@CapehartJ how has the plight of black poor been helped by a black president? To me more dependent on government than moving upwardly
@CapehartJ a newer this has black America lot been improved by 7 years of Obama or are they more be holding to the government for assistance
@paulkrugman how has Obama changed the lives of blacks or has he continued welfare state even growing it
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump what has Obama done to better the lives of black lives. Or have his policies hurt
Obama has continued the holding down of the African-American class by giving free stuff and not doing one thing to get them a job
question during seven plus years of Obama, how has the lives of African-Americans improved?seems to me it has not in fact has gotten worse.
@SteveRattner regulation regulation state and federal putting small businesses and the American dream further from reality.
@SteveRattner again I ask how have black Lives been improved by Obama.
@SteveRattner question for ages How has the lives of black Lives Matter been improved by this president?
