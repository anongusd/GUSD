@UAniegbo @UAniegbo you see that our 5% ? We are giving it to Atiku totally. You think Kano is for Buhari this time? Bros, wake up. The only time Buhari got declared as the winner was when he contested with a south/south,but with his fellow northerners? He never won any election.

Is that too much to ask of @inecnigeria ?
@chimbiko_jerome @inecnigeria Well, is unfortunate for them because some of us are rigging machines and we’re conversant with whatever new method(s) they might come up with.
DEBTOR PRESIDO	In the first coming of @MBuhari in 1984, Nigeria’s debt rose from $14 billion to $18 billion in less than two years. In his second-coming, Nigeria’s debt rose from $10 billion in 2015 to $22 billion in 2018.He’s bereft of economic ideas, a novice in governance. https://t.co/mJGzo42b1X

If the System worked,Buhari will be in jail after being made to account for the following	1) The military coup of December 31, 1983 which he used to truncate our democracy and the infamous 53 Suitcases In 1984 that was linked to his own draconian currency policy in 1984.

@akaebube Bros, I like your style joor.
Just as Nigeria fought and eradicated Ebola through social media enlightenment,social media as well can be used to eradicate terrorism through intelligence gathering from ALL Nigerians across the country.I recommend for our security operatives to partner with Nigerians on smedia.
Developed countries get intelligence through social media.Nigerians should be encouraged to report any funny movements around their environment on social media because believe me the fight against terrorism shouldn’t be left in the hands of security operatives alone.Intelligence
I keep telling people that our @PoliceNG are the best,if they set out to combat any crime or catch any criminal,they will surely do it,hence they can be very efficient in providing intelligence to the army against boko haram terrorists and not silencing Nigerians on social media. https://t.co/go2bJuGfQz

Dear @GovDavidUmahi @GovObiano @GovIkpeazu @GovUgwuanyi @GovRocha @iamekweremadu @Peter__Obi  and ALL our leaders,ALL votes from Igboland is for @atiku,anybody who votes for Buhari,the blood of ALL Igbos killed by Buhari as a military man and as a civilian president will be them.
In Igbo land,we vehemently reject Buhari and we extend this message to ALL our governors and leaders.Dear @GovDavidUmahi and ALL Igbo leaders,even if Buhari brings back Ojukwu and all Igbos killed during python dance,we will NEVER vote for him,we forbid our leaders to vote him.
We want to tell our leaders making secret deals with Buhari and APC that this election is NOT between @atiku and Buhari but between Buhari and Nigerians especially the youths of Nigeria. So they better stop those deals and genuinely work with youths towards removing Buhari.
Dear @UcheSecondus please appeal to our leaders to stop been afraid of Buhari,to stop making deals with him in a bid to save their skin.Just as @GEJonathan was sabotaged,we still have them in PDP,we still have the likes of @SenatorAkpabio in PDP,let’s  remove Buhari first please.
To ALL the @OfficialPDPNig leaders who has been making deals with Buhari and APC secretly,we want to tell you that we know you ALL,but bear it in mind that this election is NOT between @atiku and Buhari but between Buhari and NIGERIANS especially the youths and we reject Buhari. https://t.co/vaCMWLWG35
To all the @OfficialPDPNig leaders who has been making secret deals with Buhari just like Akpabio and co did to @GEJonathan,we want to tell you that we know you all and bear it in mind that you’re taking a loan payable with interest,we will soon expose you,better repent now now.
Dear @atiku,this election is not between you and Buhari but between Buhari and the youths. In Igboland,our leaders are aware that if they try to talk about Buhari that they are looking for trouble which will consume them.Even if Buhari brings back Ojukwu for us,we won’t vote him. https://t.co/fo9eJrvIfj
@MBuhari you’ve continued to kill &amp; marginalized the Igbos to the extent of calling us 5%,even if you bring back Ojukwu for us,we will NEVER VOTE FOR YOU. Our people you killed through python dance and open fire will turn in their graves.This election is between you &amp; the youths https://t.co/WoKGXbB2rr
@MBuhari @Mohammed_Lai @Laurestar @OfficialAPCNg @ProfOsinbajo this boy will never forgive you for being in power and allowed his father to be killed. Nigeria under you people killed his father. Kick Buhari out of aso rock. https://t.co/q0hHl54oJS

@Laurestar @MBuhari How many times is he going to award those things? Even if your Buhari brings back Ojukwu for us, we will never vote for him.
He empowers terrorists, he did it as a brigadier general with Maitatasine and his terrorist group that made Shagari to remove him from that region,same thing he's doing with shekarau and bokoharam and killer herdsmen. Buhari stop killing our soldiers. #NigeriaVoteBuhariOut. https://t.co/ExhKiAoqWP

@bukolasaraki @SPNigeria @grownigeria_ng @Onile050 @OnemolaOlu @babaidris090 @MrBanksOmishore @I_Am_Ilemona @NGRSenate @MBuhari Because Shagari removed Buhari from that region,Buhari went to Daura,planned a coup against Shagari and removed him.Reading from such history,it's obvious that Buhari is the one killing our soldiers with Boko haram. This is why they stopped history from been taught in Schools.
@bukolasaraki @SPNigeria @grownigeria_ng @Onile050 @OnemolaOlu @babaidris090 @MrBanksOmishore @I_Am_Ilemona @NGRSenate Dear @bukolasaraki it's not 44,it's 100+soldiers,reading from history on the life of @mbuhari as a brigadier general how he allowed maitatasine and his group to slaughter people that made Shagari to remove him from that region,replaced him with Dogoyaro who stopped maitatasine.
Just see as my ABS @bukolasaraki dey intimidate his fellow man, @ADAMSOSHOMOLE  couldn’t even look him in the eyes. Oga Bukky no dey make Oshomole urinate for his pants nah!!! @Laurestar hope you can see the fear in Oshomole’s face? My ABS was just laughing at him. https://t.co/TiyLI84zhZ

@MBuhari is a man who has continuously meddled in the legislative and judicial arms of our government.Harassment of judges and legislators of opposing views and positions is his specialty.Lots of court rulings are been disobeyed by him.Please reverse yourself,he's not a democrat.
@ECOWASParliamnt please educate me and other sane minds the rationale for making @MBuhari the chairman of ECOWAS?A man who have not obeyed the court ruling from @ECOWASParliamnt and other court rulings on Sambo Dasuki and other courts,a man who doesn't believe in the rule of law. https://t.co/M3V1ZedOba

@APCNigeria @Laurestar @MBuhari can you people stop been petty?Going after people with EFCC,police,etc and branding them as corrupt because they defected to other parties is petty and childish.#stopdemeaningoursecuritypersonnels.

My generation is not the generation of old, we're of the jet age, we're not analogue and we are not lazy like you said we are. Stop repeating the histories of 1980's during your military rule.
Ensure you exit Aso rock with our democratic practice in full existence.Stop the gross meddlesomeness in our legislative and judicial arms of government.We've enjoyed years of uninterrupted democratic practice in Nigeria,we will NOT forgive you &amp; your household if you truncate it
Gen @MBuhari you've repeated all histories that happened long before I was born,please don't repeat the history of truncating our democratic practice in my time,my generation will not forgive you and your household even after you're no more.We do not need military rule in Nigeria https://t.co/yeIM7uObBG

@ahmed_rojas @AchileEbikwo @Omojuwa @MBuhari Good ,  but ensure you don't insult @bukolasaraki again on the internet, he's sacred to me. Do we have a deal on that?
@AchileEbikwo @ahmed_rojas @Omojuwa @MBuhari Ok sir, I apologize. But I didn't call his mother a goat, I only asked him which goat gave birth to him. I couldn't have called his mother a goat, mothers are sacred to me.
I love you @bukolasaraki , your sagacity and bravery is divine. I love you to the moon and back. https://t.co/wnNHOYabVw
@MrBanksOmishore @YakubDogara Good one dear.
@nnaemy2001 @ahmed_rojas @alienyxx I was trying to help humanity by reseting his brain small but he unleashed his ignorance. I pity the woman that lives with him, I really pity the poor woman.
@nnaemy2001 @alienyxx @ahmed_rojas You dey mind am. He's an empty charlatan.
@MrBanksOmishore Jokers, they are not ashamed. Please dear always tag me to your updates, some international bodies are online for information. Thank you.
@MrBanksOmishore @APCNigeria Including my ABS @bukolasaraki ?
@ahmed_rojas @econe2014 @Omojuwa @MBuhari Guy, dogs that bark are without action. Lions don't make noise. Save your strength for the day, you will need it, believe me you will.
@ahmed_rojas @alienyxx And believe me I will be waiting for you, if I don't beat the hell out of you, know that am not an Igbo lady. You think you have the monopoly of violence ? You dey learn work.
@ahmed_rojas @alienyxx Chai !!! I don suffer.Small body no be sickness ooo!!! It's just like you undermining a trained U.S marine simply because he's of a small physical size.I no blame you sha, I blame social media that has made bingos like you see themselves as equal to others. I no blame you.
@ahmed_rojas Empty charlatan making noise. You want @bukolasaraki impeached because of what? Where will they get the 2/3 majority to sign his impeachment. Mediocre. Stop exposing your ignorance in public please.
@Bosslaydee95 @ahmed_rojas Don't mind him, he didn't know I just patronized him with that nice name.
@ahmed_rojas You have really confirmed where you originated from. From what you have said, you have showed where you are from.
@ahmed_rojas @Omojuwa @MBuhari @ahmed_rojas , which goat gave birth to you? There're procedures to this. You cannot impeach a senate president in a day, 2/3 is required.

I can't imagine the sane reason behind your statements against @bukolasaraki , be civil woman and use your brain.
@SusanHenshaw50 @bukolasaraki No vex ooo!!! Is Saraki the governor of kwara state? Is he expected to outshine the governor? And who is the governor supposed to reach out first? Is it not the state commissioner of police? It's questionable how the IGP will be first involved in that case long before the C.P.
@Abubakardnk @ShehuSani He's my senior comrade. I love him.
You can't force a marriage,you can't coerce a woman who wants a divorce from you to stay back.That the nPDP wants to leave shouldn't make you to start harassing them. You don't shut up opposing voices with harassment,you end up making them heros.Everybody is against you just quit
The real definition of disservice is a man using powers conferred on him by the people against the same people who he's supposed to protect.@MBuhari and @APCNigeria should stop harrassing Nigerians and fix this country at least back to how you met it in 2015 if you can't improve https://t.co/5MXubk65dt
@Laurestar With all of these publications that were published even before I was conceived, a sane mind is asking: How did @MBuhari come about with the name Mr Integrity? Is it a metaphor,hyperbole or what? @Laurestar please answer. Leave @bukolasaraki and @GEJonathan @nassnigeria alone.
@Laurestar Next time you talk against @GEJonathan and @bukolasaraki and @nassnigeria I will make bare from the archives irrefutable historical revelation about your boss @MBuhari .These things were published even before I was born. You've met a great historian woman.Stay clear woman.
@Laurestar @Laurestar He who lives in a glass house should not throw stones. The world is watching. We all live before history and posterity and they are documenting ALL OF US. What will you be remembered for? What is history documenting about you? We must give account of our lives to God.

Ridiculous.
@ApanpaOlasumbo @MrAbuSidiq This is an affront on Nigerians prior to the position @bukolasaraki occupies.
@ApanpaOlasumbo @MrAbuSidiq Ooh really? Is the pmb/APC an opposition to NASS? Saraki isn't the issue here but he is the senate president for God's sake. How do you feel when you travel out and they said you came from a country where your senate president sponsors armed robbery? How do you sleep at night?
Petition the IGP and this government to the international communities for sanctions, they're waiting for you people.
@MrAbuSidiq Bunch of charlatans, threat to our nascent democracy. Buhari is busy desecrating the legislative arm of government and you people are busy with sycophancy. Is that how the #NotToYoungTorun bill will work ? Grow up already please. #istandwithNASSANDSARAKI.
When you embarrass and frame an elected legislator,you didn't embarrass him but the people that sent him there,IGP embarrassed the people of kwara state that sent @bukolasaraki to the senate and other legislators.I enjoin the people of Kwara state to rise against this affront NOW https://t.co/LTkEQ1xN9z
@ShehuSani Then do the needful, impeach him and save our democracy already.Issuing conditions to a tyrant while he responds to you people with actions of embarrassment and impunity.Don't make Nigerians believe what OBJ said that the 8th Assembly is toothless. My God! Please be proactive sir
@MrBanksOmishore I agree with you sir. You are absolutely correct.
@MBuhari and @APCNigeria do you people think that Nigerians are stupid and foolish at the same time? Stop the charade already. We are tired. The world is watching with keen interest.
@MAJIDADI_KARAMI @theonce001 @bukolasaraki @PoliceNG Do you want me to continue ? There're over 20 impeachable offenses committed by Buhari known to Nigerians but @bukolasaraki have been keeping a  blind eye on them and all for what? For the love of country or the @APCNigeria just to be rewarded with such evil.
@ShehuSani My comrade, I salute your intellegence. You're the real deal.
@MAJIDADI_KARAMI @theonce001 @bukolasaraki @PoliceNG He deployed Nigeria army to Gambia without the confirmation of the National Assembly, the Tucano fighter jets saga, security situations  in Nigeria, herdsmen killings etc.
@bukolasaraki @PoliceNG @bukolasaraki I know you're law abiding and too civil because of your upbringing but it's about time you realize that you're dealing with charlatans,people without scruples,civility isn't in their dictionary.Did IGP an appointee honor the invitation of @NGRSenate for you to go?
@OkpaJo @bukolasaraki @PoliceNG May amadioha strike you there. How dare you say @bukolasaraki sponsored that robbery and for what motive can you claim he could  have towards that? @APCNigeria is trying to frame him up because he wants to defect to @OfficialPDPNig.APC are cowards.

Over the years,elections in Nigeria has always been seen and played only by the elders,youths are not been encouraged to run for an Elective post but with this bill of @bukolasaraki,I have no doubt that youths like me especially women will be given a level playing ground in 2019.
@Onile050 @bukolasaraki I know that already. I know the psyche of those people,God didn't make me a psychic for nothing.
@bukolasaraki @bukolasaraki , You are too intelligent that's why they don't like you.
To the world,it's the #NotTooYoungToRun bill of @bukolasaraki that inspired me to join the 2019 imo state house of assembly in a constituency that haven't  produced a female legislator in history.@realDonaldTrump @PutinRF_Eng,@wef, @bukolasaraki is a good man and gender friendly. https://t.co/Trc2X4i6eS
@ShehuSani My comrade sir,today I don't agree with you,the government of @mbuhari &amp; APC have not achieved any of the things you mentioned rather better put,they're specialist on selective justice,witch hunting of opposition &amp; opposing views.Sectionalism and nepotism is the order of the day.

@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki @ToyinSaraki,please ma'am pardon me for dignifying this idiot,just that I couldn't absorb seeing him talk you and your family down on your day of celebration.Please ma'am,pardon this swine,this bingo for his show of lack of home training.Once again,Congratulations on your twins.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki Only thing you know is bitch this bitch that,nothing else.I know you don't have a family let alone a mother that's why you came to the wall of a mother celebrating her children to spew https://t.co/nS0q59cmrT're really a clown,no respect for women,son of a goat,beneath my feet.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki Then show some respect since you claim to be younger. Could you please point out the sentence I didn't make correctly?  I don't blame a free loader like you, you requested for money from Saraki and couldn't be patient to get it then you resorted to blackmail him and his family.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki That you're like the devil shouldn't make you think everyone that is fair  is bleaching. In your next world pray to God to be light skinned. I've warned you,learn to respect @bukolasaraki and his family else I will bathe you with insults,I can assure you of that.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki Talk nah, I taught you dey craze, I get your injection. Idiot.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki My zero sentence really got to you, failed abortion. Just one condom would have saved this country a midget like you. Imagine an uncircumcised philistine insulting a Diva because we're on twitter? I don't blame you.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki Who the heck are you to come to the wall of a mother celebrating her children and spew balderdash in public.Were you born of a woman at all or a goat?I will be keeping cognizance of you,one insult from you on @bukolasaraki and family I will give you 100.Failed abortion Be warned!
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki Ensure you don't dare me, you lack the monopoly of what you think you can do. You're a toddler in that.Stay off @bukolasaraki and his family,else I will bathe you with insults. Uncircumcised Philistine like you. Charlatan.
@hammanabba @ToyinSaraki @Blisscharity @bukolasaraki I can only imagine how deeply the zero sentence got to you,no vex you hear?Next time,learn to respect a family your generation unborn can never equate.Just one condom would have saved this country a midget and charlatan like you.Failed abortion like you.Don't be silly swine.

@MBuhari left health workers on strike,went to UK for medical trip with our oil and tax payers money leaving Nigerians to die in millions for lack of health care,Nigerians are holding him responsible for the lives lost.Upgrade Nigeria's healthcare like that of U.K. @bukolasaraki
@OnemolaOlu At this juncture,no Nigerian should obey police invitation since the IGP of police has the temerity to bluntly disobey the National Assembly,a body that has the legal right to impeach the president is what IGP is desecrating. No Nigerian should obey police invitation again.
@chiefow @bukolasaraki @OnemolaOlu @babaidris090 @Onile050 @wagzie01 @_walebakare @ToyinSaraki @daily_trust @MobilePunch @thecableng @bukolasaraki is the only most insulted senate president,where has it been done that the National Assembly will summon an appointee,the appointee will bluntly refuse to obey the summon.National Assembly has the constitutional right to summon even the president let alone appointee
@chiefow @bukolasaraki @OnemolaOlu @babaidris090 @Onile050 @wagzie01 @_walebakare @ToyinSaraki @daily_trust @MobilePunch @thecableng I believe that @MBuhari knows what to do to stop the killings in this country and his not stopping it means he's seating on the blood of Nigerians.PMB is the GCFR,in military if any error occurs,you hold the head not the subordinate,therefore,Nigerians are holding PMB responsible
@chiefow @bukolasaraki @OnemolaOlu @babaidris090 @Onile050 @wagzie01 @_walebakare @ToyinSaraki @daily_trust @MobilePunch @thecableng I passionately need @bukolasaraki to join PDP.All the killings that has happened under APC across the country,how many APC members have condemned it openly?Saraki does.Why haven't they stopped the killings?There's no way any sane person will believe that they dont know what to do
@bukolasaraki @OnemolaOlu @babaidris090 @Onile050 @wagzie01 @chiefow @_walebakare @ToyinSaraki @daily_trust @MobilePunch @thecableng You are an angel that has great values for life.

@babaidris090 @alamin_audu @bukolasaraki @AHayatu I've always advised that the legislators should impeach @mbuhari,he's calm because he's seeking for 2nd term,if he manages to get it,he will jail senators &amp; shut down National Assembly &amp; take the keys,he feels constrained by democratic principles.ONCE A DICTATOR,ALWAYS A DICTATOR

Buhari is an unfortunate event that has happened to Nigeria. https://t.co/n4g4jbtQbE
@ShehuSani And @MBuhari will tag us as lazy and uneducated? That man is sick.

@alamin_audu @babaidris090 @bukolasaraki @AHayatu Are you jealous of him? Kpele. You think you can weigh me down with such nonsense? Am above that. And be careful how you insult the number 3 citizen of this country. Stop been silly .

Why was @YusufBuhari_ riding powerbike on a tuesday that caused his accident while others were in their offices?What's his occupation to have acquired a multimillion naira power bike?@theresa_may,note that @MBuhari is unpatriotic and not worthy to appear in the comity of nations.
@theresa_may,could you please stop pushing for same sex legalization for Nigerians?It is an abomination and a desecration to us. You're a woman and also happily married to a man,please ma'am erase Nigeria from your list of legalizing same sex.Even animals don't practice same sex.
I am a Nigerian youth,a university graduate,brilliant and a psyche by God's grace but because @MBuhari hates Nigerians,he has decided not to gainfully employ me and my fellow youths and I come from one of the oil rich states in Nigeria,still @MBuhari is calling us lazy in UK?
@theresa_may,these are Nigeria youths,university graduates for that matter who resorted to hawking business because @MBuhari bluntly refused to provide employment for us.What do you call a president who can't employ graduates,graduates blessed wit oil are suffering.WE'RE NOT LAZY https://t.co/diDUDvVXfa
@theresa_may, could you please ask @MBuhari what his son @YusufBuhari_ was doing on a Tuesday when he had that accident with his power bike,while other hard workers were at work?How did his son acquire the million dollar power bike?What's his son's occupation?@wef

@OnyemaIsaa @ShehuSani @bukolasaraki @NGRSenate @elrufai Could you please justify your statement? Do you really want to engage me in a reality show with evidence? What makes you classify them as evil senators? What proof do you have?
@G_Abdulazeez @ShehuSani I am opposed to your statement. We need him more at this time than ever. His experiences and bravery is very expensive that we can't afford to miss.
@ShehuSani My senior comrade,you're an asset to this generation,in saner clime,you,Dino and @bukolasaraki will be highly valued.I commend @NGRSenate for not allowing @elrufai to mortgage Kaduna through debts.I also appeal that same should go to the federal https://t.co/CmfXvMsWsh borrowing

@realFFK @hon_ernest I agree with you sir. Worst still is Christian blood are been spilled and he dares talk of Jonathan?
@BABSFREY @general_halap @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Is the chapel in Aso rock still in use under Pastor YEMI Osibanjo? Who can do that to a mosque?
@BABSFREY @general_halap @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari It's a shame that under VP YEMI,his fellow Christians are been slaughtered without him doing anything?Of what essence is it that we will have a pastor in power and we Christians are been slaughtered like chickens?When the righteous is on the throne the people rejoice,where's it?
@BABSFREY @general_halap @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari It's a shame that under a professor of law and SAN like YEMI Osibanjo,people are being arrested,detained,even imprisoned without investigation and proper prosecution and judgment by the court.jungle justice &amp; media trial took over.He forgot the terms,innocent until proven guilty.
@GovAyoFayose @ProfOsinbajo Backsliders of Christian faith are many now because of him.
@alex_oluwafemi @BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Thank you dear. God bless you too.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari @bukolasaraki Now you are understanding my point, lots of billions are not being returned to the national treasury yearly under Buhari. It's only @SenDavidABMark that returned almost one billion to the national treasury when he was the senate president.PDP was not guilty of budget transparency
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari I believe @ProfOsinbajo is reading this tweet, let him throw more light to this.The world is watching him closely especially with his recent vituperation and blackmail on @GEJonathan without first addressing the corruption that is happening under his watch as a Vice President.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari @bukolasaraki How much was budgeted for miscellaneous expenditure in the 2017 budget and how much was spent on his health ? It's about time we make sure our leaders account for our money. They are playing with us in this country.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari The rate of borrowing by Buhari and osibanjo is alarming, it's as if they have a hidden agenda against this country. What are they doing with the recovered loot? Are they being relooted, please throw more light?
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Go through the sections that has to do with the running of Aso villa and the president. You know it's a complex document but not with meticulous people like us, we go through it, page by page for history purposes.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Regarding the haircut millions for Buhari, go through 2016 and 2017 budgets.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Budget?It appears that you're an aide to osibanjo,please help me ask him if the money used in Buhari's treatment was appropriated in the budget?As a lawyer,What will that be called?Is that not an impeachable offense? @bukolasaraki am calling your attention to this issue I raised.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Check last year's budget please. 2016 and 2017 budget, Go through it.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Oh really?But they have money to throw around? It's simple,Buhari and osibanjo have no value for the military and the police,Nigerians in extension.The huge millions written down in the budget for Buhari's haircut can go along way in the insurance policy of our security agencies.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari The reason why I love Russian president Vladimir Putin is because he takes good care of his security agencies. How then should a former army general like @mbuhari not take good care of the military? Why should our soldiers be killed like rams under his watch?It's so sad,very sad.
@BABSFREY @ProfOsinbajo @EmmanuelMacron @ProfOsibanjo @MBuhari Our security agencies should earn more than the politicians and undue dismissal stopped. The injured and abandoned officers should be taken  care of. This will help to stop crime in Nigeria.

@bukolasaraki please Senate president I appeal to you to rise against the FG pulling Nigeria out of the international organisations.
@shehusani it's about time this government review their steps before embarking on them, the consequences of pulling out will be monumental.
@shehusani:The security of Nigerians globally will not be assured any more.Deaths,imprisonment,human rights abuses on Nigerians wil be high
@shehusani: pulling out of those foreign organisation is the greatest disservice to Nigeria from BUHARI/APC.
@shehusani;No Nation can survive as an Ireland,let alone Nigeria. Our membership to foreign organisations encourages investors to come in.
@shehusani: Countries will start deporting Nigerians daily.Member states  can't do business with Nigeria and Nigerians.

@obataiwo6 @SegunObasanjo please justify your statement for ascribing that to my prophet and my Bishop. Have you lost your mind?
@obataiwo6 @SegunObasanjo I vehemently take exception to that statement.Bishop Oyedepo is not like that APC Rev Father in Enugu state.
@olamindmide boko haram are also enemies of President Jonathan, so the gates of hell are been opened on them too.

@SegunObasanjo chai!!!Wonders has to end this time. Imagine the most corrupt president that has ever existed in Nigeria talking @bt Jonathan
@SegunObasanjo what was the situation of electricity in your regime?It's time we make u our prayer point in this country for God's judgement
@SegunObasanjo How did boko haram originate?Was it not because of your impunitive assault on those people?You messed Nigeria up&amp;u're talking
@SegunObasanjo all the problems we're facing in this country originated from you,stop opening up our wounds with impunity.
@SegunObasanjo you lack the moral right to speak against any president that will ever exist in Nigeria,kindly maintain a dignified silence.
@SegunObasanjo you don't have the monopoly of powers in Nigeria anymore because JESUS CHRIST has taken dominion over the affairs of Nigeria.
@SegunObasanjo how many times did ASSU &amp; ASUP go on strike during your regime? He who comes before equity MUST come with clean hands.
