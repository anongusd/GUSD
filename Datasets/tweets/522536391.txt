@ChangeTheLAUSD @nickmelvoin @SenSanders @SteveZimmer_4SB . . . continue to watch you do nothing to improve the quality of life for children, families and communities most in need.
@ChangeTheLAUSD @nickmelvoin @SenSanders @SteveZimmer_4SB Carl if I knew you had the capacity to be substantive I would debate you. Since you don't and solely resort tired rhetoric I intend to. . .
@ChangeTheLAUSD @MagnoliaSchools @latimes Read the actual report and listen to the hearing and testimony and debate. Then rather than staking out reflexive positions - think.

@ChangeTheLAUSD What do you stand for because from my perspective you just talk.
@ajmanx @ChangeTheLAUSD @nickmelvoin @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos @SenSanders Your guy was silent on issues that mattered UNTIL he ran for president. Zero policy accomplishments. His endorsement means nothing to me.
@ChangeTheLAUSD @NAACP Before the @NAACP started talking about charters did you support anything else they did? #askingforafriend
@ChangeTheLAUSD Here you hiding behind tweets w/ bad facts. No question about @MagnoliaSchools academic superiority - questioning your reading skills.

@ChangeTheLAUSD I agree we have disinvested in traditional public schools at an alarming rate.But being dismissive of students in public charters is foolish
@ChangeTheLAUSD So are you against high quality education for black and brown students? Do you care that students aren't prepared for UC and CSU's?
@ChangeTheLAUSD You do realize these are black and brown kids being educated and going to college through nonprofit charter schools?
