@myatsko for ex, lots of folks i know got more cons after 9/11 - i am NYC native, was living there in 2001, scary time.
@myatsko well, there is that. :) was there any particular moment or incident or condition that made you feel more aligned with cons? &gt;&gt;
@myatsko nah i dont think most are stupid, maybe frustrated or uninformed. were you always cons politically or did you drift over time?
@myatsko i have same issue w cons. have tried 2 talk w many like im talking w/ u but so much anger thrown at me! just bc we disagree. jeez.
@myatsko i can see that logic. what do you suggest for leveling the playing field without setting ppl up for failure, though?
@myatsko have u any numbers 4 that scenario? wonder if it would solve budget problems or not. still think it 2 much on low income folks.
@myatsko no i dont think they pay even close to what they should, or corporations either. those are the loopholes i would like to see fixed.
@myatsko AA prob helps balance out some of the more egregious discrimination, level the playing field 2 a certain degree. maybe better ways?
@myatsko most ppl generally do a good job. privatizing not the way to go i dont want 2 b held hostage 2 someones balance sheet 4 everything
@myatsko i dont think govt is inherently inefficient. its used inefficiently by the ppl that run it. govt generally does a good job, like &gt;&gt;
@myatsko i wouldnt call it fair bc it leaves one even further below the poverty line & the other slightly inconvenienced. pay what you can.
@myatsko so it seems like it comes down to determining how lax the standards are for who can and can't work. i can see that.
@myatsko I CONCUR! see we do agree on something.  :)
@myatsko again with theft! :) if all neighbors are hurting, whats there to donate? then what?
@myatsko re racism, aff action: how do we get past the fact that there IS discrimination, then?
@myatsko flat tax seems mean to me. if you make 25000 and pay 10% that is a huge bite, if you make 250000 and pay 10% not as much.
@myatsko taxes arent evil we get a lot 4 money we pay. not saying its gr8 but also sure yr nt saying we shuld get everything 4 nothing, yea?
@myatsko i defer 2 yr prof wisdom but it sounds a little harsh 2 say we have 2 starve ppl out of depressions. no other way to do that?
@myatsko that the wealthy should pay higher taxes than the not wealthy, because they can afford to do so.  you?
@myatsko yah, what DO we agree on? this might be a more useful way to look at things. i think fairness is important. thats why i believe &gt;&gt;
@myatsko you do? r they people u work with? whats their story? im always interested in where the challenges r & how they can be dealt with.
@myatsko i don't consider paying my fair share to the common wealth theft by the govt. this countrys given me a lot, why shouldnt i kick in?
@myatsko probably not. im not trying 2 change yr mind.ru trying 2 change mine? :) values r values, im not giving mine up & neither are u.
@myatsko could you say more about the clinical depression thought? (im not saying it is lifelong disability, btw.)
@myatsko thats true. when i was laid off in 2001 i waited tables. still took me 2 yrs 4 another real job. lost my apt, not 4 lack of trying.
@myatsko good teachers spend a lot of money on education & their own money on classrm stuff. yr saying they make too much?
@myatsko by individuals, thats why its important. cant say I agree w everything they do but that aspect alone makes it important to ppl.
@myatsko  oh come on now. yr boys hannity, rush, and bill o are all union members, how bad could unions be?  :) coll barg cannot be done &gt;&gt;
@myatsko when did we start and which "socialist policies"? im really trying to learn your perspective so give me more than sound bites, ok?
@myatsko cant speak to ongoing generational freeloading, i dont know anyone in that situation. do you? how did they get there?
@myatsko i agree folks sb responsible 4 themselves as best they r able. its prob not true every1's "best they are able" is the same, tho.
@myatsko also, "hard work" not always the most highly paid work, so sort of skews who is able to afford hc & who is freeloading, do u think?
@myatsko yes, govt should promote the genl welfare. is that taking care of ppl? perhaps. but i dont think its a bad thing. sense u do - why?
@myatsko all dont have access to HC, thats the problem. & those that cant afford drs running care thru ER costs everybody else a FORTUNE.
@myatsko public option isnt about providers btw, its govt operating a ins plan that competes along w private ins plans. 1 option among many.
@myatsko quality HC, American ingenuity will take care of figuring out how to make that happen. We're smart enough to do that, no?
@myatsko practice public medicine? ppl much smarter than me working on figuring that out. if USA can agree that all ppl deserve access 2 &gt;&gt;
@myatsko thats where govt comes in. incentives: tax breaks, student loan 4gives, create other structures 2 make it worth drs while to &gt;&gt;
@myatsko sure that everyone is able to get HC, we can make it happen somehow. pretty smart nation that way. :)
@myatsko worship the idea of drs as capitalists at the expense of others NOT being able to obtain HC. if we agree that we need to make &gt;&gt;
@myatsko or other incentives. if drs want to private practice & charge TONS of $ let them, private patients can go to them but lets not &gt;&gt;
@myatsko want to practice privately should do that. those that do want to work for govt may want to do so b/c they get student loan 4give &gt;&gt;
@myatsko wait wait, think i see now. no i don't believe ALL drs need to work for govt to ensure everyone has access to care. those that &gt;&gt;
@myatsko upholds that resp by creating structures that support the ppl's ability to obtain it.
@myatsko i think that the right to HC is part of that gen'l welfare thing-it benefits all of us to have a healthy population. so govt &gt;&gt;
@myatsko i'm sorry, ya lost me. not sure what you meant "choose not to work for the gov"-you mean not pay taxes, or something else?
@myatsko yes. but you also have obligation to contribute 2 the common resources, yr taxes. after you satisfy that obligation, its all yrs.
@myatsko could you say more about that? I'm not clearly seeing the connection btwn those dots.
@myatsko i believe it a right in the same way i think coll barg is one, under intent of genl welfare clause, not cause its spelled out as 1
@myatsko absolutely. without question. (thats why i do the job i do.) as do most other countries - US is the aberration on this issue.
@myatsko in some things yes but in some things (like healthcare) economy of scale means feds can do it better more fiscally sound way.
@myatsko :)  esp in political discussion, yeah? me too.  enjoying talking w you despite the 180 degree diff. of opinion.
@myatsko we have more successful socialism inherent in our govt than we do oligarchy. why shouldnt we ALL benefit from shared resources?
@myatsko it more in line w/intention I perceive in that 4 govt 2 actually provide structures 4 genl welfare of ppl: health, food, jobs, etc
@myatsko i think it comes back to the interpretation of the gen'l welfare clause. Madison said no, Hamilton said yes. Personally I think &gt;&gt;
RT @MoveOn: I support the #WI 14 & will stand w/them in their brave opposition to @GovWalker's radical attacks on workers http://j.mp/Wi ...
@myatsko & many things that are not named specifically as "rights" in const but contribute to fulfilling that govt resp, like coll barg.
@myatsko (http://ow.ly/46y2O for Hamiltonian/Madison POVs info) There are many things govt should do under resp to promote gen'l welfare &gt;&gt;
@myatsko want to go. (A disc like this in 140 char is a BITCH, sorry for so many tweets!) I take Hamiltonian POV on gen'l welfare clause &gt;&gt;
@myatsko deemed a specific right but under "general welfare" it is important. We need a strong working class bc oligarchy isn't where we &gt;&gt;
@myatsko A few thoughts comin at ya: My POV on coll barg comes from "general welfare" clause in preamble to constitution. CB may not b (more
@myatsko Been working for HCR nonprofit since 2007-got a thick skin after that. apology accepted tho & thnx for calling yrself out on it :)
