In 1999 Trump Marina Hotel Casino had to pay $50,000 to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement claiming that an employee specified "no black driver" when ordering a limousine for patrons.
April 1991 the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that the Trump Castle Casino Resort, would pay $30,000 as part of a settlement of a case in which Trump's father Fred was found to have improperly lent $3.5 million to the casino
In 1990 the New Jersey Casino Com imposed a fine of $40,000 on the Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, for hiring six accountants without the proper licenses and then sending paperwork to the commission to make it appear the accountants were doing jobs
In 1975 the Trumps signed an agreement with the Justice Department in which they did not admit to past discrimination but promised not to discriminate against African-Americans and other minorities in the future.
In 1973 the Justice Department filed a suit in federal court accusing Donald Trump and his father of discriminating against African-Americans in apartment rentals https://t.co/dXVhpBBtBy

Dear Members of the Trump Cult: Most of you are lacking in any sort of intelligence. Therefore, when you decide to reply to me, stop getting mad when I suggest you read a section of the United States Code.
When u say the President is innocent, and I suggest you read the following: see 52 U.S.C. ¬ß 30116(a)(1)) &amp; (a)(7) (52 U.S.C. ¬ß 30118(a) (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2(b)  (18 USC ¬ß 1512), (18 USC ¬ß 1505), instead of reading the material and having an intelligent discussion, you block me.

Grand Old Party no longer exist. It is shameful to think this great party has deteriorated to representing racist, sexist, homophobes, renegades, Islamophobes; supports the killing of journalist, and supports the arming of gun nuts with machine guns to kill our children.
If you support the Republicans u support: 	Evil: separating children from parents;	Traitor: Renegade actions in Helsinki;	Racists: Trump‚Äôs real-estate company tried to avoid renting apartments to African-Americans in the 1970s and gave preferential treatment to whites
