@winxthexwar @retiredERNursie @DineshDSouza @Jethro_Aryeh @hwestonbull_hhh @woodsprout @AustynRoss @realDonaldTrump I beg to differ. I am experiencing the love of the LIVING Christ NOW. If you don‚Äôt know Him you have no idea how wonderful His love and peace are. I speak from actual engagement not from a false narrative. He loves you and bought you from the destroyer so you can have his peace.

@readbobbeasley @ChelseaBumbalo4 Just asking ... would that be prejudging God‚Äôs love, compassion, forgiveness, and Christ‚Äôs death and shed blood?

@PattyMurray How can two or more people read from the same pages of facts come up with such diverse conclusions? I sincerely ask the question.
@PattyMurray I was told by someone (an anonymous source) that is in a position to know, that what is not being given to you are public knowledge.  Can you tell me where my source is wrong? From my research I accepted what they said because they seemed the same to me
@fidella91 @DJTsAmerikkka @PattyMurray @brianschatz @maziehirono Saying something like that to you destroyed my witness which is my most valuable possession. Those statements hurt my ability to live in such a way that I could be found guilty of being a Christian.
@fidella91 @DJTsAmerikkka @PattyMurray @brianschatz @maziehirono The question was actually rhetorical. I am extremely sorry that I upset you and assumed instead of asking about your reasons.  In saying what I did I broke my paradigm and damaged my witness. I felt like I shouldn‚Äôt send it. I have also ask God for forgiveness. I was wrong.

@JazzyPeaceChick Thank you
@JazzyPeaceChick I can‚Äôt find your last two tweets.
@JazzyPeaceChick You would know my brother in law. He was the elected DA for many years. Bob Roberts
@JazzyPeaceChick I love and appreciate you.          Eph. 1:14-16
@JazzyPeaceChick We cannot experience giving or receiving the wonderful grace of God when we are in the process of hating anyone because it is totally opposite of God‚Äòs unconditional love for us.Hate will destroy us as individuals and our country. We need to agree to disagree and extract the heat
@JazzyPeaceChick I am going to try to dictate what I said that disappeared.  Our believes and disagreements about President Trump will never change so we need to agree to disagree for the sake of our own hearts and for the good of our country.
@JazzyPeaceChick Even my watch is picking up on my fatigue and is telling me to breathe deeply for one minute.
@JazzyPeaceChick I don‚Äôt think I can text it again. I am getting ready tired. My sister is a very strong leftist progressive. She, if compared to you, you would look and sound like Jesse Helms.
@JazzyPeaceChick I just wrote a full tweet and it disappeared.
@JazzyPeaceChick I see that from a different perspective as well.
@JazzyPeaceChick I can give you just as many examples proving the same thing from a different perspective. Here is my concern. We, being both sides, need to open our heart and mind that we will never agree on these points. We are destroying our individual selves as well as our country as is
@JazzyPeaceChick I strongly disagreed with you. My perspective is totally different. I could spar on this and enjoy every second of it but doing so would not convey my heart‚Äôs calling in Christ. This is where I stand but I cannot and will not place my stand on anyone else.
@JazzyPeaceChick There are multiple areas I am distressed over what is going on. I would feel the same way if Hillary had been elected and if the Republicans were attacking her the same way.
@JazzyPeaceChick Many times God, in the Old Testament, used non Jews to turn the Jews back to Him. I don‚Äôt pretend to say that is what is going on now. To me it could be part of the contributing factor in his successes thus far. Only Christ is the judge, and he isn‚Äôt judging anyone right now.
@JazzyPeaceChick I don‚Äôt see that as you do. His statements seem to betray him. If you went back to look at some things I have said and thought, you would not see the me that you see now. I have grown in Christ. I have no right to judge him or anyone but just love them. We all are evolving.
@JazzyPeaceChick There is nothing impeachable at this point. If there was, I would be looking for it as you are
@JazzyPeaceChick If I respond to that with my view of what is going on, I really don‚Äôt see that I can be true to my convictions.I understand your point. My vision of what is going on is from a totally different perspective. To respond to yours I must diminish the basis to mine.
@JazzyPeaceChick I don‚Äôt know if I can be an example of God‚Äôs love by freely injecting myself into this contagious atmosphere. Confronting a Philosophy that engages me is totally different. I want to thank you for forcing me to look at my beliefs and how it appears when I express them.
@JazzyPeaceChick I am seriously contemplating not sparing on Twitter any more. I am struggling with the fact that I am NOT Exhibiting the love of Christ in all of my  remarks. I am not living out my paradigm. This is very troubling. I cleaned up my terminology for the last 36 hours.
@JazzyPeaceChick It was a Cabarrus County buzz magazine. Not a religious magazine . I was the photographer and also a sales person.  The magazine was sent in the mail to everyone around Concord.
@JazzyPeaceChick Yes it is. There are more connections than that. Do you remember the EDGE magazine from the early ‚Äò90s ?
@JazzyPeaceChick She is one of the most beautiful Christians I have been blessed to meet and know. She is a very precious young lady

@JazzyPeaceChick @PGKroeger @legaleye_ Most of the youth at the church I attend then went to South Rowan. 	Almost all of my family grew up in Landis and China Grove. Almost all of my family is now gone. Those still around have very little contact.
