The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate‚Äîwe cannot hallow‚Äîthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.

Jorge Moreno-Martinez had an immigration hearing on August 29. But on August 24, Trump Judge John Nalbandian allowed the federal government to deport him despite his family and clean record. https://t.co/X8dd65F9p5 #NoBanNoWallNoRaids

We shouldn‚Äôt pretend that this is the first violent and likely politically motivated attack against progressive figures. It should be evaluated within the larger trend that includes violent brawls encouraged by the alt right &amp; the brutal murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville
The fact is that there‚Äôs something deeply wrong with the Right in this country at this moment.
Last week Trump praised a congressman for assaulting a reporter and made up ominous accusations about migrants looking for asylum in the U.S. There is no analogue in the Democratic party, and responsible reporting needs to reflect that reality. https://t.co/Xa7dyUmn3s
Trump alone has praised Alex Jones who called the Sandy Hook shooting a hoax and opened the Oval Office to Ted Nugent who called President Obama a ‚Äòsubhuman mongrel‚Äô and told him to ‚Äòsuck on my machine gun.‚Äô https://t.co/lvthwitPyj
We don‚Äôt know who is behind this most recent string of attempted bombings, but we do know that this kind of behavior is dangerous and dishonest. We all have an obligation to participate responsibly in our civic discourse, but this is not a ‚Äòboth sides‚Äô issue.
Figures like Alex Jones &amp; online trolls have built an echo chamber of hate and misinformation online, while Fox News hosts have elevated irresponsible and dishonest conspiracy theories, and elected GOP officials like Trump &amp; Ted Cruz have engaged in and encouraged this rhetoric.
Right-wing media figures have trafficked in malicious, baseless claims that Obama, the Clintons and Soros have participated in everything from child rape rings to the Holocaust. https://t.co/KKDFZQm4uW
In recent years, right-wing media have relentlessly attacked Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Soros with every slur in the book. They‚Äôve routinely described them as evil, even satanic, villains intent on destroying this country.

As all these present and former Kavanaugh supporters make clear, his nomination should not go forward at least until there is a thorough nonpartisan investigation of the recent troubling sexual assault claims. https://t.co/RsKx91uEV1
2 prominent Kavanaugh supporters, Akhil Amar &amp; David Lat, have called for an FBI or other professional investigation of the sexual assault allegations. Another, Benjamin Wittes, said that Kavanaugh bears the burden of proof &amp; should consider withdrawing his nomination.
8 members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association supposedly signed a letter supporting Kavanaugh that was read into the record at his previous hearing by Idaho Sen. Crapo. Several did not actually sign the letter, and one individual wrote to ask that his name be removed.
Out of 80 former Kavanaugh students at Harvard Law School who initially supported his nomination, only 18 responded to media that they still support. 2 women said they do not in light of the sexual assault allegations against him. 1 called for his nomination to be withdrawn.
Of the 65 female high school classmates who signed a statement of support after sexual assault allegations were first raised, only eight responded to media inquiries after the identification of Dr. Catherine Blasey Ford to confirm that they still support Kavanaugh.
Quotes from 5 Yale law school professors in support of Kavanaugh were originally featured on the school‚Äôs website. One had her quote removed and stated that she believes that a full review of unreleased documents and the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh should occur.
6 Yale classmates were originally included on a statement from Kavanaugh‚Äôs lawyers that disputed the serious sexual assault charges by Deborah Ramirez. Two contacted the New Yorker a day after the statement became public and asked that their names be removed.
As allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh have emerged much of his support, specifically from women, has evaporated. https://t.co/tLaxEZewnX #StopKavanaugh #BelieveSurvivors
