@therileyheath look at what you're doing. However if you think a gun is worth more than your own life its not only a lie to yourself, but everyone else and its causing other people's suffering. So instead think about the people who have been affected by these incidents and walk in their shoes
@therileyheath And as a very distasteful personal attack maybe you should look closely at the media you consume. As I previously stated the right winged smear campaign has been around for a long time and it always chooses a boogieman. So instead of following blindly like you claim I am ~con.
@therileyheath And no I'm not copying the March for our lives "bullshit" as you so eloquently said, but just because its a threat to your views doesn't mean its a bad thing look at the people who have died and tell me that its fair that they no longer have a chance to fulfill their dreams
@therileyheath The Australian weapons ban actually worked while we are currently facing more than 1 shooting per week in the US they've had no mass murder attacks (while shootings have occurred none were intended for mass murder) since Port Arthur.
@therileyheath That's not what I was saying at all, but do you really need a weapon that is similar to that used in war to protect yourself as its unnecessary. Do you really need to mow them down? As I stated before pistols are still efficient at "protection," but don't put others in harm
@therileyheath vs the loop holes of background checks (while still needed).
@therileyheath and/or common criminals which we "need" to "protect" ourselves from aren't going to be able to afford these weapons.  Its absurd that having more guns creates a safer environment when in actuality its not solving the problem, when it can be more easily controlled at the source
@therileyheath For self defense an AR is excessive and if you take a look at the prices of these higher capacity weapons on the black market they have had a huge spike in prices as some weapons previously costing $2000 went up to over $15000.  Home invaders (while already uncommon) -continued.
@therileyheath While pistols can be semiautomatic they cannot carry more than a small magazine in comparison to the 30+ round ammunition that some rifles can hold.  While rifles with a low ammunition count I would understand protecting, large and extended magazines are unnecessarily.
@therileyheath It doesn't protect the rights of the people who have been killed in gun related tragedies does it?  And if you believe that guns protect your rights from a tyrannical government it's absurd, try to prevent the corruption of media instead as our President continues to smear it.
@therileyheath It's potential that someone in these schools could have been shot since it's a SCHOOL not a war zone.  Why should we have to worry about issue like that its absurd and it puts people unnecessarily into danger
