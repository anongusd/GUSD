We're kind of hoping the GOP gerrymandering over the past decade will at least give us a fighting chance for fairness, but it looks like we'll have to win by about 12% to get what you only needed 5% for the same outcome
@GeraldoRivera Really?  Dems would like to welcome their asylum requests, while Republicans want to shut them down at best, or shoot them on site for even trying to immigrate.  This is not "both sides will leave issue unresolved."  One side is traditionally American, and the other side is not.

@SenateMajLdr Kind of like what you did when you jammed through your disgusting tax bill?
@Jim_Jordan The "docs" as you say with reckless cavalier, are intelligence about an ongoing investigation you bumbling dipshit.  You need to quit if all you're going to do is throw bloody red meat to your shrinking base of lemmings.
(2) but much of what's going on right now isn't.  The Framers were too idealistic to anticipate someone like Trump.  The Federalist Papers attempt to address varying issues outside Its purview, but Trump is a wild card. Our institutions are eroding and something must be done.
(1) Excellent article.  Perhaps what's needed is an unprecedented house cleaning.  Regardless of tenure or party affiliation, Congress vote to end the terms of all and start from scratch. I know ... this is not prescribed as a scenario in the constitution, https://t.co/zD7qZHc4AC
@MelissaRyan Obst of justice apparently no longer needs to be covert. Trumps list of abuses seemingly grows daily right in front of our eyes, yet Cngrss does nothing. Trumps plan now for the left is to get them so disillusioned having continually gotten away w/it, they‚Äôll be frozen come Nov.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Can you breathe with your nose so far up Trumps backside? I‚Äôm worried about your safety @LindseyGrahamSC.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You better hope all future indictments in your future @DonaldJTrumpJr are federal from Mueller.  Then at least daddy can bail you out before he has to face his own music.  Then there's the SDNY!  Oh boy! Now that will not be a happy day, will it!!  Saddle up dickface.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Misogynist pigs UNITE! (then go to hell).
@DonaldJTrumpJr First off, what @LizzieBoredom said. Secondly, no one backpedaled.

You‚Äôre a waste of my time &amp; the rest of America‚Äôs. Piss off!

@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt presume to instruct people far smarter and more experienced than you @realDonaldTrump. Your 15 minutes are almost complete.  You‚Äôre an embarrassment to our country. Please do us all a favor rectify this horrible mistake. Please step down.
As an Oregonian, this does not sit well with me at all.  https://t.co/tgwGxHtrkM
@realDonaldTrump How does one work overtime to do nothing? The media prefer to report on truth and fact. However, they have given your baseless allegation the time it deserves.  It is you sir, who is corrupt.
What say you, @PreetBharara?  You must be appalled over this ridiculous pardon by @potus of a man who pleaded guilty and rec'd no jail time. As far as I see, he only gets out of 8 hrs/wk community service. Has a president ever stooped so low in history?		https://t.co/YLMZ6vQQGy
@realDonaldTrump Great @realDonaldTrump !  You can now start your electric shock treatments!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You‚Äôre going down dickface.  You‚Äôre a loser with no character or integrity.  Your inevitable indictment won‚Äôt make up for the damage to this country you‚Äôve been party to, but it will be a ray of sunshine at least.  I hope your family‚Äôs empire is brought down &amp; you rot in prison.
@realDonaldTrump All I can hear is ‚Äúbla bla bla, I‚Äôm a lying, cheating SOB.‚Äù  You‚Äôre recycling your unfounded insults and it‚Äôs getting monotonous.
@SenateMajLdr Oh you‚Äôve succeeded alright.  You‚Äôve let our President run roughshod over the Constitution, you stole a SCOTUS appt, you‚Äôve ignored the middle class and poor of this country in preference to mega-corporations and the top 1%, and you‚Äôve ruined healthcare for all.  You disgust me.
@JanUAbrahamsson @VP Thank you Mr. Abrahamsson. Truly illuminating article. I hope @VP reads it too. My outcome is I‚Äôll stop using this map and look for a better representation.

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Hey dipshit ... wouldn't be great if you conducted yourself in a such a way that we could have a "unified government", not just a "unified Republican government"?  Do you know what your real job is??  With comments like this, you wonder why the Democrat Congress people abhor you.

@realposhpenguin @Tom_Winter @missb62 You'd think #Novartis would have asked to see Cohen's credentials as registered lobbyist before entering into an agreement with a $1.2 million exposure.  Of course Cohen wasn't a lobbyist, so that begs the question on everyone's mind, "is this just plain ole' pay for play?"
Very interesting article by Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly of @washingtonpost.  It deals with yesterday's rhetoric as to why he pulled out of #JCPOA, as well as some old scores like the $400M in cash in January 2016 &amp; the $32B coinciding with Iran's agreement to the nuclear deal.

@ReuvenKlein @APPerko @xPJ_Olson @AnonaMoose58 @pattythomastpc1 @SenateMajLdr I will answer this comment with your own words. Don't assume this because you don't know me personally.
@ReuvenKlein @AnonaMoose58 @sutcasa @xPJ_Olson @pattythomastpc1 @SenateMajLdr Now you're just being sarcastic. The lack of an iPhone and a TV are not life threatening. No healthcare is.
@ReuvenKlein @sutcasa @xPJ_Olson @AnonaMoose58 @pattythomastpc1 @SenateMajLdr I do think we should help the homeless, yes.
@ReuvenKlein @sutcasa @xPJ_Olson @AnonaMoose58 @pattythomastpc1 @SenateMajLdr Charity is a choice. Funds used from a charity is subjective. No diff than Police or fire. ALL people have right to these svcs equally.
@ReuvenKlein @sutcasa @xPJ_Olson @AnonaMoose58 @pattythomastpc1 @SenateMajLdr Not for the rest of the civilized world Reuven. You're in the overwhelming minority with that attitude.
@ReuvenKlein @AnonaMoose58 @pattythomastpc1 @xPJ_Olson @SenateMajLdr Some people's pre-existing conditions occur at birth. Healthcare should be no different than police or fire services.

@KayKay68 @pattythomastpc1 @xPJ_Olson @ReuvenKlein @AnonaMoose58 @SenateMajLdr That's right. We pay for SO much in profit to Ins Co &amp; Pharm that other countries don't need to factor in. Healthcare should have no profit.

@Vetrecrehab @NancyPelosi @POTUS and @GOP have only earned the oppositions disdain. What has @realDonaldTrump done that deserves @TheDemocrats support?
@shamazing8 @NancyPelosi Learn about how insurance works Lmbs, then return to the discussion. ACA is NOT insurance, nor is it increasing your premiums.
@SportsJoker23 @RobotWhatIsLove @OskarMac2020 @NancyPelosi That is accurate to Tim. But do you really believe capitalism should be incorporated in healthcare delivery? Conflict of interest!
@NancyPelosi The GOP is eating their young. It's disgusting and red states shouldn't tolerate it.
@NancyPelosi Every state that his suffering is a red state. Coincidence?
@HusrtMiMi @NancyPelosi My opinion of the ACA has nothing to do with Pelosi.  I want the @TheDemocrats to push for #UniversalHealthcare. Failing that, fix the ACA.
@DianaKraft7 @NancyPelosi 3.  This takes the insurance companies out of the equation. Why should YOUR healthcare delivery system ensure a profit for a 3rd party?
@DianaKraft7 @NancyPelosi 2. It's a fallacy to believe that ObamaCare is jacking your premiums up.  They're not.  This is why #UniversalHealthCare is essential.
@DianaKraft7 @NancyPelosi Remember ObamaCare is NOT insurance.  The ACA is law governing for your safety. The insurance companies are to blame here, and the GOP.
FIGHT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY &amp; HUMAN RIGHTS!  FIGHT FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. @UHCUSA #UniversalHealthcare https://t.co/aZvVvrEN61 #SinglePayer
@NancyPelosi This is all a self fulfilling prophecy by the GOP.  I hope they're happy getting their way through the suffering of their constituents!

@realDonaldTrump 4) You would be a HERO to the middle class, the average Joe/Jane, &amp; take your place in HISTORY as a Leader with Heart!
@realDonaldTrump 3) GDP spend for Healthcare in America = 17.1%.  World avg=9.9%. Drop spending to 12% of GDP &amp; save USA $1 TRILLION/yr.
@realDonaldTrump 2) TRULY drain the swamp and IGNORE Insurance, AMA, and drug company lobbying who oppose Universal Healthcare!
@realDonaldTrump 1) If you want to improve healthcare in America, BE BOLD! Introduce TRUE Universal Healthcare as an alternative to ACA.
