@PaulRyan giving a slightly better conclusion than @JoeBiden - Joe was more emotional, but less direct; Ryan's is a campaign close #VPDebate
@JoeBiden complaining about 15 v 40 seconds is childish and unnecessary.  Bad call - you're winning, just close strong. #VPDebate
Moderator: What do you say about the negative tone of the campaign?  @PaulRyan and @JoeBiden: Neg neg neg  #VPDebate
@PaulRyan had a chance there to defend his campaign as positive when @JoeBiden went negative - bad answer on both sides #VPDebate
@JoeBiden takes the tone of the campaign question and brings back 47%?  Not a strong move #VPDebate
Closing with the tone of the campaign?  Solid move.  Seriously - give her the first debate in 2016.  #VPDebate.
This may be the best answer on faith and governing ever given by a Democrat.  That possibly includes Kennedy's speech in Houston.  #VPDebate
