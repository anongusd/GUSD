@ElizabethGarGra @AnglesOfVenus @UMCGC Yes, the conservative troll groups are all over the UMC decisions. Usually they have few followers on their profile.

@GregEdgar1776 @LisenokTX @LibertyLiger @SenSanders @PhRMA Actually good for my dad that a university used YOUR tax money to research his cancer drug that Big Pharma is selling to treat his cancer at $88 a pill x 4 pills a day = $128,480 year. Some now paid for by YOUR TAXES in a grant from the university through the drug company- thanx
@GregEdgar1776 @LisenokTX @LibertyLiger @SenSanders @PhRMA You just think you are educated, unfortunately someone like me who is a #T1 diabetic thinks you need better education as it relates to the deadly costs of insulin. They make my Lantus for $1.48 vial and sell for $339 vial of here at Walmart (no Wally Relion replaces Lantus).
@joanied34 @SenSanders LOL, I was just retweeting the Sanders post, and thanked him for keeping the need for policing Big Pharma keeping affordable Meds in the forefront. And I ran into the combo Big Pharma lobbyists and anti Bernie group - not much sympathy for dying because of unaffordable insulin!
@GregEdgar1776 @LisenokTX @LibertyLiger @SenSanders So let me guess. You are one of the THREE Big Pharma lobbyists that are in Washington for every Congressperson or Senator? Possible connected to @PhRMA
@GregEdgar1776 @LisenokTX @LibertyLiger @SenSanders Research is done mostly at Universities and subsidized primarily by YOUR TAX dollars. How about if they give us all our tax dollars back that we have put into the research for drugs over the years? I bet we could pay off the deficit caused by the recent GOP corporate tax cut.
The horror stories keep adding up about people unable to afford #insulin.

If you can get any of us her e-mail or phone and her age and the kids ages we can start researching situation and get her in touch with help for insulin. #insulin4all
@TheBeatWithAri @GovInslee My insulin cost about $18 vial when I first got diagnosed with #T1 Diabetes, now it's $325 vial. If #SchultzBucks were POTUS I fear my can of Folgers Coffee at Kroger would be $144!
@KarlynnHolland @ardenrain @Jediabetic1 If she is in TN (or south) let me or @DottieBee know and we will pitch in helping find insulin resources too! #Insulin4all

@NicolleDWallace Madeleine Albright is 100% correct, he is the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini reincarnated!
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Instead, trump has lined up his ideology to be lock step paralleling the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. He even plagiarized the dictators talking points - "drenare la palude" (drain the swamp).  jimmy why are you trump's enabler, fascism is not American!
@tndp The Fascist Mussolini coined the phrase, "drenare la palude" (drain the swamp) by firing 35,000 civil servants" The many similarities between Mussolini and Trump are chilling. It's like he read the history of the fascist dictator and said, I want to be like Benito!
@AnonymousDocto2 @LillyPad @sanofi @novonordisk Agreed, It is one of the reasons I am hoping for #MedicareForAll or a similar named system that puts us all on equal footing in regards to setting up an appointment with an Endo.

Excellent article on what it's like being a #T1 diabetic trying to afford the American Insulin Price Crisis. We finally have @TheDemocrats and @GOP members in both Houses who feel our pain and are willing to hold hearing and hear testimony. #Insulin4All 		https://t.co/XeKDAAzkGA
@AyannaPressley @yzest5121 @OversightDems I listened to the hearing in detail. As a #T1 Diabetic I thank you wholeheartedly for your questions, intelligence and sincerity. We have been asking for years for relief from Big Pharma price gouging.  With you and your fellow members it looks like we finally have a voice!

@jacobsoboroff Tennessee republicans just decided to turn off live streaming in their subcommittee rooms. This is on the heels of @TNGOP closing caucus meetings to the media. With a new @BillLeeTN GOP governor I can see where they would not want a election day holiday - less is more for them!
@MikeInacay I am a Blue voter and live in Tennessee. The ideas @brianschatz has on a Medicaid buy-in are outstanding. But as someone who is unfortunate to live in a GOP state that has no intention of expanding Medicaid, I don't think it's fair that a program like this is location relevant.
@brianschatz Thank you for your support Sen. Schatz. As a #T1 diabetic and former firefighter turned organic farmer my insulin costs are over $15,000 year. The problem is Senator, many people CAN'T WAIT for the NEXT POTUS and Congress, we need lower prices and action NOW.  People are dying!
@RepDianaDeGette Thank you, as a Type 1 diabetic and former firefighter turned farmer the over $15,000 year cost of insulin for 48 vials of insulin they make for $1.48 per vial is price gouging, collusion, torture and manslaughter!

@Kidfears99 @CNBC @FrankPallone @RepDianaDeGette Thank you for investigating and helping to solve The American Insulin Price Crisis. The CNBC article stated that insulin increased to $5,700 in 2016. FYI as of 2018 my insulin (Lantus and Humalog) cost was $320 vial x 48 vials =  $15,360.

@JoesewellC @McCluskieforCO @COHouseDem @Dylan_RobertsCO Joe, the GOP kneecapped the ACA from the get go. It seems their plan all along was to get us saying exactly what you just said, and I understand that same frustration. But the ACA is not the cause of it all, it should have been tuned and fine tuned all along and the GOP said NO.
@chrisjollyhale Christopher, do you think turnout was low because the GOP here just couldn't stomach voting for Dejarlais again so they didn't vote for the 04 congressional seat at all?
@sewpersists @chrisjollyhale Trump may end up helping dissolve that "always republican" mindset? I did see more young people active for a mid-term than I have in the past. But it wasn't nearly enough. It would be interesting to know how many MTSU students voted. I know they were active on campus registering.
@sewpersists @chrisjollyhale I know it's the same here and it's really frustrating to see the country changing and electing good people with great new ideas. Yet, we sit here second in rural hospital closings to Mississippi! We had good local Dems here trying, there weren't enough to get people registered.
@chrisjollyhale We used the TN04 population from the Wikipedia page that had the 2016 population 767,655, and the numbers from Ballotpedia total votes 2018 232,451 - %30.28 .  Plenty of votes (535,204) sitting out there for an aggressive party!

@chrisjollyhale Everyone who ran and lost in 2018, and everyone who ran and won needs to mobilize their workers/helpers and get people registered to vote for 2020, that's how we will change things. In TN04 we only had 30% of residents show up to vote - tells me lot's #Blue2020 votes available!

@Jandelliott @cnoble12go @sanofi @MylanNews OK, so that's why Chris said "some" provinces were as low as $9. I just assumed with Canada's system they would bargain collectively, especially since some are as low as $9, wow!  I would pay double that!
@Jandelliott @cnoble12go @sanofi @MylanNews Are they just using Canada on re-importation because of high safety standards? Are there other countries that have volume to spare that are reliable? I think we are at least two + years off on #Medicare4all (2020)

@CNN Fact check: When GOP drank beer in the Rose Garden with Trump after repealing the ACA; they determined that if it had passed the Senate more Americans would have died (43,956 deaths annually) in 26 years than all US soldiers in every war we have ever fought 1.1 million/243 years.
@SteveSchmidtSES The boy who is my profile photo was Felipe Alonzo-Gomez from Guatemala. He died 2,000 miles from his home at Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo, New Mexico. As far as I know he was the last child to die in US custody, it was Christmas.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You are a co-conspirator! There's no way the leader of the inhumane @GOP could continue in her position without complete compliance to the dunce in chief. We need a House investigation on Ronna McDaniel Romney added to the list. Money breeds GOP corruption, she knows secrets.
While the USA is in #TrumpShutdown his goons are shooting gas into another country.  They roundup people like cattle, deny applications for asylum, separate families, jail children and babies in freezing cold cells, and ultimately people die while in custody.

@MSNBC @GOP looking to position a conservative clown, just in case!  It's not just trump who got us into this mess - it's the entire Republican party.  Many supported trump, a few did not, many have left the party, but far too many still spin the demise of humanity in our democracy.

We are under the impression the children at @TornilloWitness may be released from that hell hole in the near future. Go #RedWings
@FioritoPatrick @Daicy8 @Alyssa_Milano Callous and simply acting like someone standing on one side of a gate with the key to the gate while others are fleeing a fire. My family would offer yours safety in the event of an emergency, - maybe you will feel God's grace, I hope.  May God Be With  you patrick.
@Kmarugan @richard96760943 @jimcramer I have been told I am fairly perceptive, but It is just my experience nothing more.  I do not monitor the market at that level at all.
@FioritoPatrick @Daicy8 @Alyssa_Milano Patrick, This is my initial post. I put Alyssa Milano's name in it because she graciously changed her profile pic to the 7 year old that died in jail. She isn't part of this thread, she doesn't deserve your CHEAP shots. Please do not viciously attack people on this thread.
@JohnCerutti1 @jimcramer We need to find safer methods for those building their nest egg. We may be old enough and have money we can risk. The majority in America are paycheck to paycheck and have less than $500 emergency fund. I'm sure if they had more many would invest, but could they cover a loss?
@chickiepilot I am glad to read there was a T1D - so important. I chuckled when I read that they had to educate the panel about the differences between T1D and T2D. Sometimes life and death conversation means education! #Insulin4All
@Wndr2J @Alyssa_Milano "Sow your land for six years and gather in its yield, on the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the needy of your people may eat. You are to do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove"	Exodus 23: 9-12. God didn't factor in SNAP work requirements!
@Kmarugan @richard96760943 @jimcramer I am a Dem and I've seen Wall Street decimate the market and blame Dems in power due to checks/balances and regulations etc. Today GOP removed the Mercury Regs from coal plants - air we breathe! As soon as Dems put it back, The Street will beat down stocks, its politics I guess?
@donna_dink @Alyssa_Milano God Bless You SassyB
@richard96760943 @Kmarugan @jimcramer I agree things were crazy high. I remember prior to 2000 the DOT- Com's got overvalued. After going through that adrenaline rush, then the mini crash I got skeptical with the recent valuations. I'm still paranoid, I just don't understand how Wall Street factors the trump aspect.
@Kmarugan @richard96760943 @jimcramer Yes, no doubt there are good ones priced right now. I just wonder what trump will do to those prices over the next two years if you buy now? Maybe he will bring them even lower? Maybe the Dems will calm it down, but then again Wall Street hates the Dems. Hmm, how to trade trump?
@HockeyMomDiva @Alyssa_Milano Yes, heartbreaking and unacceptable. Thank you and Peace Be With You Alexandria.
@sewpersists I figure we are in for a long scary time here in TN. Time to batten down the hatches and find some sort of island in the storm of Marsha and Lee!  It sounds like a damn rebel college! https://t.co/Xr3teDzLHB
@JulieLBartlett @HoarseWisperer @Alyssa_Milano You are so correct Julie Lynn.  My partner and I were just saying how wonderful it would be to adopt one that was there by him or herself scared and so alone.
@richard96760943 @Kmarugan @jimcramer Been happy with my investments since 2009. I got lucky, had severance pay from the crash and made good picks (Jim was a big help). I was UP with many so the past 2 years of insane highs were Booyah! But volatility based on politics with a nut in WH is too much to buy 4 me now.

@dgaluppi @Alyssa_Milano Here's your timeline, the boy is dead. He was no doubt held in cells that were too cold. Yes, he may have been sick from the journey. Go to the holding facilities he was at; get jailed after a 2,000 mile journey then report the facts - God Bless You Mam. 		https://t.co/I6VjFr3Q5b
@marjorieschevh1 @jimcramer Point well taken.
@Wndr2J @Alyssa_Milano I can't wrap my head around what Israel is doing.  As a Christian I have always had strong views on the need to protect the Jews. After all Jesus was Jewish. But, what they are doing to so many is distressing. And now trump is praising their damn wall - it never ends, nightmare!
@DreamingDrama_ Yes Mama Molly, he is something isn't he? A little warrior! He traveled 2,000 miles without a car - imagine that?  I wish he was here so we could just hold him, and take care of him and his father.
@TXRERockstar @HoarseWisperer @Alyssa_Milano Yes, and two times he was with medics; he must have been so strong! His father must of been so afraid trying to negotiate trumps hell and the constant worry of a sick little one. These stories will continue to get worse. I believe trump people are planning worse.
@LM_Yates1 @Alyssa_Milano I am well aware where he died Mike. 		My family and I will say prayers for you tonight Mike, for you and trump. God Bless you Mike. Go in Peace.
@Daicy8 @Alyssa_Milano I know Daicy, it is the worst thing imaginable - an innocent child gone! I know you would have helped them, we would have too. We must continue to be their voices. There are many jailed at @TornilloWitness  right now - fight for them. Thank you and God Bless you Daicy.
@johwri Yes it is heartbreaking John, please keep the children in your thoughts and prayers.
@KerrynnK @Alyssa_Milano Thank you Kerrynn - God Bless You.
@Ocasio2018 Just remember Alex, you always have a place here in Tennessee. Our Representative has been MIA GOP for many years so - TAG, YOU'RE IT! We need you... Thank you!
@LM_Yates1 @Alyssa_Milano What's sad is the little boy died while in jail in the US. If you want to go to Guatemala and face possible death due to starvation and unemployment, walk 2,000 miles, then sit with your 8 year old in a COLD jail cell - then you can play politics, but until then please don't.
@jpmomof5 @ThirdWayTweet Thank you, Farming is pure delight. we do it the old way with basic equipment and hard work.

@Wndr2J @indytom62 @Alyssa_Milano Mr. Atkins it's actually worse than war- it's TORTURE. Two children are  dead and DHS under oath can't tell congress how many have died we don't  know about. This is one battle you best steer clear from if you are  going to use the GOP useless trump card and blame Obama - Please!
@chickiepilot @KYGOP @TNGOP @KyDems @tndp @ALGOP @aldemocrats @MSGOP @msdemocrats This is fantastic.  I love being able to see your advocacy in action in the legislature. Were the citizens all diabetics or were doctors, nurses, first responders present too?
@spinalisdorsi @Someone66321 @jimcramer Yes, the algorithms are the primary reason I'm backing off.  I invested for years, have had above average little guy success. But there is no method for this madness, The old techniques I learned like research and reading reports mean nothing in the trump market.
@spinalisdorsi @jesserocket01 @jimcramer I'm still hanging on to most of what I bought in 2009, why is that myopic? I didn't sell much at all in the last year (or last 2 weeks) but bought a couple here and there. It's the trump market, it will change after 2020 regardless of what the Fed does.
@jimcramer I just heard a financial "expert" on MSNBC being interviewed about the market. Her advice was to not open your statements if you think you might sell, what? This is what it has come to for regular working folks, the experts dishing out BS on national TV in the trump market.
@LeftwardSwing I have had the same situation.  I figured many are bots, after all at this early point who else want to get the left bickering among ourselves, certainly not my friends.
@nowthisnews Jeez, he was buying a purse and managed to blame Democrats too, what?  I have heard of the Stockholm syndrome, but somehow we are back to the Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh syndrome now - pitiful.
@shaunking Chill out people - there is one goal, actually two. #1 Win the Presidency back for the sake of humanity. #2 Take over the Senate for the sake of humanity. During 2019/20 if we all register just 1 person to vote per month we will be better off than arguing over race!

@TornilloWitness Be advised, trump is bouncing off the walls more than normal, lots of border rhetoric from him, his staff, and some GOP. Stay the course as this Govt. closing plays itself out. The Dems have a plan but I wouldn't put it past trump to use innocents to try to vindicate his debacle.
@DonnieDollHands @michaelcburgess @chrislhayes Thank you for the update, I hadn't heard of him before seeing him on TV, and when I saw him I thought, it's Newt Gingrich all over again! Then I read where he is Tea Party and that explained it. He is certainly a reason the country is in such bad shape.

@GovHowardDean I agree, I have tweeted them twice today saying the same, even including Bernie's recent critique of their underhanded methods. Us Dems need to play nice with each other, do the debates and decide through voting who will represent us, WE DO NOT NEED TO BE INFIGHTING - Stupid!

@ChuckGrassley Hey Chuck, I am an insulin dependent diabetic. It costs the insulin  manufactures $1.48 to make a vial of insulin, they sell it at Wal Mart for $318. I am a farmer and can't afford the $15,000 year it costs me to stay alive. Will you work on something to get costs down please?

@MelindaMWedding @sulka @dakami @CharlesT1DF @Kidfears99 @shanselman @dj_ir0ngruve @fromagechat The scary thing is wondering who works for Pharma and who are Pharma lobbyists; and why the message always seems to get changed from affordable insulin for all to methods of "survival"?

It takes a lot of energy and time, maybe ending "patient shenanigans" is the one, but more at the Fed level, not sure what's the state one?
@Jandelliott @Danhowdy1965 Does getting one vial or even a months supply really "end" deaths due to lack of ability to pay for insulin? At $1,200 per month to pay for my insulin, doesn't that just put off the inevitable?  If I can't afford it today, how will I afford it on January 17th?
@novonordiskus Do something instead of paying lobbyists to fight for you to CHARGE more for insulin, pay to fight AGAINST the GOP killing healthcare for millions. If TX ruling stays we will be lined up at your office needing handouts regardless of income. #Insulin4all		https://t.co/OLQ4QrIogm

@AlizSmith @davidaxelrod @POTUS Maybe that could be the (starting point) for #MedicareForAll. Members of congress and staff pay approximately 28 percent of their annual healthcare premiums through pre-tax payroll deductions. That would make a $900 month premium $252.
@Getatpatrick I am in red south in a very red congressional district. In the 2018 election we had 232,201 turnout in a district of 767,655. GOP incumbent who some of the reds don't like beat our candidate 63.4% to 33.6% (Ind got 3%). I don't think the demographics you spoke about in 1st voted.

@LillyPad Eli Lilly, you could make a "meaningful impact" on humanity by REDUCING  the price you charge for insulin. You make a vial for less than $5 and it costs $318 to buy that same vial. Some patients need multiple vials,  some patients are dying because of @PhRMA greed. #Insulin4all

@Jandelliott @KHNews Here in the US after the ACA passed the republicans immediately began their campaign to dismember it. The $72 Billion Kaiser Permanente Executives were the first big managed care to become very vocal about how rates were going to rise, lock step with the republicans killing it.
@Jandelliott @KHNews They may not be linked now, I believe after the old man passed away it evolved and changed somewhat. They were both started by the same Henry Kaiser. Regardless, still would like to know how much Kaiser Permanente contributed in that time span.
@Jandelliott @KHNews Someone should FACT CHECK Kaiser's database. The first number I looked at from Eli Lilly didn't seem right.  I believe they gave $63,350 alone to VP Pence when he was in congress.  Also, why is Kaiser leaving their own contributions out? 		https://t.co/gpvyqXqnSi

@Jandelliott I get people/lobbyists (?) popping in conversations whoare quick to point out the old school $25 insulin, it takes some prodding but usually they admit T2 but don't differentiate easily. The whole obesity and health spin I'm confident is lumped together by Pharma to confuse.
@sabrina_burbeck @LillyPad I had to call two Wal Marts. the first one quoted $955 but then she figured that was for pens - Wow! They didn't have vials in stock. The second one here quoted $318.38 for one vial of Humalog and Lantus was $318.25 so no change in last two months.  What state was the $364.99?
@sabrina_burbeck @LillyPad I quoted the TN price from about 2 months ago.  Maybe we should start documenting the prices regionally every month or quarter? If it's that high here now, that's a $46.61 increase in 2 months. I will call to check today here. #Insulin4all

@JackJFernandes @Kidfears99 @novonordisk Do some research on what expanding Medicaid can do or would do in a place like TN.  The republicans here have no justification for not expanding it except they have used it to bash ACA.  They are killing people here because they want to argue ACA- they had two years to fix it!
@JackJFernandes @Kidfears99 @novonordisk ACA didn't damage our country sir - the REPUBLICANS, lobbyists, pharma and insurance companies damaged it and I am living proof.  I was happy as a pig in the pen here when ACA came and I was doing great with it - but REPUBLICANS Repeal and Replace, never had a plan it was LIES.

@MKGenest It's the same thing T1 diabetics get when we say insulin is overpriced at $318 a vial. Someone will say I get mine at Walmart for $24 a vial.   Ummm, one is for T1 diabetic (pancreas doesn't produce insulin) and the other mostly for T2 (pancreas produces insulin) #Insulin4all

@Ocasio2018 @DanRiffle Spectrum Health Chairman is Dick DeVos husband of Betsy DeVos, the  "worst" Secretary of Education ever. Spectrum sells itself as a Non Profit.  In 2015 Spectrum was a $4.5 Billion company. This family has scammed the tax system for years; yes they would use HUMAN LIFE to profit.
@T1DF_advocacy @JuliaT1DF @dfalbaum @FennerMichelle Hello pharmacy buyer here's a deal, let's eliminate the middleman! I make my insulin $5 vial, will sell to you $40 so I make %300 profit.

@imjustnutz @lukeoneil47 Yes, and despite how the insurers all blast ACA - Health Care Service Corp., which is the parent of BCBS in 5 states made a hefty $$$$1.3 BILLION profit in 2017 (Axios).
@775AC @DrKidNurse @lefthndgun @mdb2 I agree. My thoughts, we have two years to plan, debate and agreed upon it. Right now get the left side of Congress on board. Then with left Senate direction get 2020 Bill rewritten, because then #NobodyLeftOut should fly through both Houses and a Democratic POTUS signature.

@775AC @DrKidNurse @lefthndgun @mdb2 The republicans spent years saying Repeal and Replace with no REPLACE planned. They dismembered ACA day by day from inception fooling their followers.

@imjustnutz @lukeoneil47 Thank you - that' puts it into perspective.  When I first saw they were Not For Profit I thought well that's good. Then I did my research and found out who and how they were lining their pockets with gold from other people's blood.

@lukeoneil47 America needs to start waking up to the links - the tentacles are long and they connect to trump: David DeVos Chairman Spectrum Health, hubby of Betsy DeVos Sec of Education, brother of Eric Prince America's mercenary. (2015) $4.5 BILLION Spectrum sells itself as Non Profit.
@FennerMichelle B. DeVos brother is Eric Prince (Blackwater,Frontier Services) rich guy who positioned himself as trumps mercenary for really bad stuff. My research indicates those who dismembered ACA for the republicans had huge financial interests in healthcare, pharma or insurance.

@garzone_ryan @SenSanders @NSmithholt12 Ryan, the drug companies receive about 1/2 the money they use R&amp;D (and they use a lot) through Government grants and funding (FREE money). Yes Ryan, our tax dollars pay for some of it, yet they still gouge diabetics and use the R&amp;D excuse like you are without a complete picture.
@SharronJo @SenSanders @NSmithholt12 The WalMart low cost insulin is used most for Type 2 diabetics (pancreas produces insulin), if Type 1 (pancreas doesn't produce insulin) was on it for any length of time it would cause serious complications per MY DOCTOR. You think if $24 insulin worked we would pay $318?
@garzone_ryan @LoriRuder @SenSanders @NSmithholt12 Ryan, the insulin makers Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Novo Norbdisk make BILLIONS. When the patents run out they PAY the generics to NOT MAKE insulin and sign a settlement contract which right now is legal, but we are trying to change that. Insulin has increased 5200% add that to your $150
@PeterDawsonUSA @SenSanders @NSmithholt12 You're MISTAKEN Dawson. Where I live (Red Tennessee), if you're male and not in nursing home no Medicaid (TennCare).  Woman unless you have child or in nursing home no Medicaid. You make less than $12,180 year no ACA/Obamacare discount it runs about $900 Mo. No expanded Medicaid.

Make that 643,001 as this US farmer will be bankrupt someday since insulin costs $15,000 a year for me to buy 47 vials. It costs them (LLY, SNY) $235 a year to make my 47 vials.

@AADEdiabetes @BeyondType1 The cost to purchase insulin has risen beyond fair. When Banting discovered insulin they sold the patent to UT for $1 so everyone could have access to the lifesaving medicine. Now, the 3 major drug makers gouge diabetics to the point people die daily. My insulin's cost $41.10 Day
Thanks for the support @t1international  - Celebrate World Diabetes Day 2018 by speaking to your legislator (even if you don't have diabetes) about the price gouging by the drug makers and the costs of insulin that are causing people to die every day! My insulin's $41.10 Per Day https://t.co/PZ9bCu3Hly
Michelle is so right!  The discoverers of insulin sold the patent to the University of Toronto for $1, saying no one should profit from a lifesaving medication.	In Canada the average cost of insulin per day is about $1.20. In the USA mine costs $41.10 PER DAY! #WDD2018 https://t.co/2nKnJVlVW4

@tndp I am amazed the way the republican's still pull the wool over the voters eyes on the Medicaid issues.  Pretty soon TN will be last in healthcare! We are already 2nd worst as far as rural hospital closures go, while the other states get the Medicaid money allotted to us - dumb!
@CNBC China, people with type 1 diabetes use disposable needles for several days. Meanwhile, care for people with type 1 diabetes available only in large clinical centers located in major cities. U.S, it costs up to $15,000 year for insulin - both countries stink at care! #insulin4all
@tndp If your annual income is less than $12,140 and your state (like Tennessee) has failed to expand Medicaid you WON'T get any help. In other words the  poorer you are the faster you die in TN. If republicans accept expanded Medicaid you would get a plan https://t.co/WBPTRdVNHK

@thomaskaine5 @claudester @AARP is not doing enough to spotlight seniors on the rising costs of insulin by the 3 insulin manufactures who are gouging seniors to the extent we are dying because we can't afford our insulin. AARP is a political force and needs to act NOW to pressure legislators. #insulin4all
@marcorubio What are the rules for voting and verifying signatures for people who don't know how to write their name? Or, who like me have such sloppy handwriting my signature is never the same twice? How about let's make it easier to vote instead of all this BS after the fact.
@SenSchumer Hey Senator, great ideas for better travel, we all need comfort! How about writing some legislation to STOP the 3 insulin companies from raising their prices so much that people are dying due to the inaccessibility of insulin due to their price gouging? #insulin4all
@jacobsoboroff Amazon can shake up the country with announcing Corp headquarters and their new Hub; they sell and move packages globally with few hiccups.  Why can't we fix the darn election/voting process?  This could be fixed in a year with semi intelligent people in place, maybe ask 4 help?

@Rob__Milliken @BernieSanders I agree on snail mail, I  thought about it today.

@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Buy 2,500 shares Ford stock for $2 when 2008 republican spawned financial crisis hit. Sell F when President Obama leaves office, put profits in kids college fund. Buy F again when Trump enters office, sell F now.  What administration made you more dough?
@JayDReedy @VoteMarsha @realDonaldTrump This doesn't make sense, Veteran of what?   Your tweet looks like @VoteMarsha  and .realDonaldTrump are Veterans?  Umm, mushroom tasters and bone spurs don't equal veterans of war now do they?  Oorah!
@mason_moore_ @VoteMarsha @BillLeeTN I was just reading where Ivanka invests in Voting Machines with her China Trademarks.  Republicans won't even need campaign workers in 2020.  After all if they own the Voting Machines manufactured with cheap China labor thy can just change our votes!		https://t.co/xfTdHQ8lmy
@BarryshopeHope Yes, that's the track we were on until 2016, now many rollbacks of good protections that will hurt us all in the long run. However, my friends in Energy tell me they are still pointed at clean energy regardless of how far the dipstick goes.
@SarahforWI @Wipapa5 it looks like he and Ivanka want to add technical personnel for their Chinese trademarked voting machines!!!		https://t.co/xfTdHQ8lmy

@MikessisterL @Lawrence @TheLastWord Fair and Honest?  Here's the truth and its from 2017, the prices have actually increased. I'm done bickering with you about the HIGH insulin costs for millions of Americans, people are dying and a quick trip to Walmart won't solve this	https://t.co/FSaYusc0PE
@MikessisterL @Lawrence @TheLastWord Call Walmart phone 931-967-0207 Insulin without Insurance in Tennessee  Lantus $318.25 and Humalog $318.38 x 4 vials a month = $1,273.26 x 12  months without my Obamacare would cost $15,279.12 year, for insulin  alone, not testing supplies Dr Appts. or other diabetes related Meds
@MikessisterL @Lawrence @TheLastWord This article is from last year, but it shows what people like me have gone through for years.

@Sharoneshore @Lawrence @TheLastWord Yes, many people I know have gone across to Mexico in the past and bough their RX.  But, the way trump has become the border boss, I would be afraid of landing in the slammer getting stopped with a few months supply of my life saving insulin in the car.
@deb_parfitt @Lawrence @TheLastWord Following @BarbraStreisand - sounds like she's heading there!
@Maureen36178483 @Lawrence @TheLastWord Thank you for sharing that Maureen. I hope for everyone's sake here in the US we go to something that is geared to getting everyone FULLY insured based on need and income level, it just makes so much sense. As a farmer I would think republicans want me healthy so I grow more food
@DeckardDugliss @Lawrence @TheLastWord The crazy thing is that $600 per month is rent for many people. So combine rent and medical insurance alone and a person is behind the 8 ball even if they work TWO minimum wage jobs. The republicans told those too many lies, there never was a REPLACE, just REPEAL and a beer party
@CarynB_Chicago @Lawrence @TheLastWord You are so right Caryn, before Obamacare if you didn't have job related health insurance it was too costly for premiums. And yes, Obamacare saved people like me with preexisting conditions. Don't let the republicans fool you, they are hell bent on destroying health care.
@attyrose23 @Lawrence @TheLastWord Thank you, you are correct. I already voted early along with my family, and of course all BLUE.
@COAGBFashion Getting a discount coupon online is NOT A SOLUTION for a diabetic that needs two types of insulin totaling 4 vials each month - It's still too costly because the price of insulin has DRAMATICALLY risen in the last TWO years.  I voted BLUE early, I hope you did too!
@mskathann @Lawrence @TheLastWord Before I had Obamacare/ACA, I contacted the insulin companies directly and they both had programs to help with the costs based on financial needs. I am not sure if they still do it, but it really helped me get through a time when we couldn't afford my insulin. Please try that.
@MikessisterL @Lawrence @TheLastWord You are wrong, a RX is necessary for insulin. You are lying to people if you say it is $25, simply call Wal Mart and ask them what one vial costs of Lantus or Humalog (I need 4 each month). You should never lie about prescription costs, that is wrong.
I swore I wasn't going to tweet about the poor migrants being used by trump to try to win Ted Cruz a senate seat (Go Beto!). But this map is the epitome of asinine of pentagon logistics.

@VoteMarsha A pastor quote Jesus and Sessions calls it an attack. Question...What isn't an attack to you Marsha? Is Congressman Scott Desjarlais sleeping with women other than his wife and then demanding they get abortions WRONG or isn't it?  Will you comment? https://t.co/ysEzQS83tz

@kugirl86 @BrerBradshaw Yes, it's becoming a regular occurrence in many states.  I figured by now we would have this "fair" election thing figured out!
@oneunderscore__ @BrandyZadrozny @Tom_Winter Anyone @JacobAWohl who has a voicemail forwarded to their mom is going to look very sweet and preppy in a prison jumpsuit! Especially when his new housemates find out he supported sending the military going after those ailing and persecuted immigrants on the border. #BarofSoap
@DogginTrump The Tea Party and the Freedom Party are the boneheaded side of the Republican party. The divisiveness and crooked politics begins with them. They prey on the unsure and the elderly, hence Lindsay Graham acting like a fool! Get rid of Freedom Caucus members by voting them out
Even FOX calls Trump a liar, what else do you need?  Vote Democratic for a more equal government, you have no other choice, you must vote. https://t.co/rtJJwWUgbs
Taylor Swift voted today for Phil Bredesen in TN.  Be like Taylor and vote for Phil and the Democratic party.  We are in a close race in a republican state, but Phil is the right person with the experience as Mayor and Governor to work across the lines for Tennessee. https://t.co/wLnvVPnwsh

The best statement I have read regarding the PA murders. Everyone should read this not once but twice; and then read it to those who cannot read and read it to your children. It's a statement that should cause change, change we desperately need.  #TN04 @Mariah4Congress https://t.co/gwjbpq1goQ

@RonRamsey Disruption? The fellow who did PA is the disruptive one, with his AK, wearing a MAGA hat, supporting republicans, and taking in all the extreme rhetoric  that flies daily. It's beyond sad, it's flat out sick. Your Marsha does  not deserve to be a Senator.	https://t.co/gOki5HCC1N
