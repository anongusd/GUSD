Advice from @pkelash of @AllianzLifeNews on how to make up for lost time w/ your savings as you get closer to #retirement: https://t.co/6vY9WIgpia
Andy Hendren on behalf of @Wespath: “Oftentimes the church community is sort of forgotten in the mix...when addressing the tax code, etc. It’s important that we’re not forgotten [when writing retirement security legislation].”
Same question for @401kconsultant: “In #RESA there’s that $5,000 credit for small employers that wasn’t in the #FamilySavingsAct. You start saying $5,000 credit to small employers, the impact becomes real.”
In response to questions about what’s missing from the #FamilySavingsAct, @401Kathleen: “The annuity selection safe harbor to give employers flexibility, as well as #LIDA, would be significant improvements to a final package.” #FSLIC
Salerno of @Raytheon: “It’s great that momentum is building. The #FamilySavingsAct has a lot of good things in it for American families, #RESA has a lot of good things in it for American families...it’s time to move it. There are a lot of bipartisan, bicameral wins to be had.”
Cindy Hounsell of @WISERwomen : “Financial wellness programs from employers can make a difference in improving #financial literacy” #FSLIC
Adam Salerno of @Raytheon on section 202 of the #FamilySavingsAct: “Time is of the essence. Regulation should not be the reason people lose their pension benefits.” #FSLIC
.@401kconsultant: “Education is really important. We have to have a solidified, common way to communicate. I believe #LIDA is important for employees. A lot of times individuals don’t know what this pool of money in their statement means.” #FSLIC
.@401kconsultant: “There’s no reason to have a cap on auto-escalation (in retirement plans). The employees can opt out at any time.”
.@401kconsultant on the importance of auto-enrollment: “I can tell you, when participants open their statement for the first time and see a balance, that creates additional positive feelings about the employer which helps with retention and productivity” https://t.co/vuT2abuqKL
