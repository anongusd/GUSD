Turns out Dowless collected way fewer ballot request forms than he told Yates (the legal activity that he was paid for). Why didn't Andy Yates audit those #s? Yates said it just wasn't his practice. Dems say it's because it's not what Harris was really paying Dowless for. #nc09
The lawyer for a Democratic judicial candidate swept up in #nc09 fraud investigation is doing some meaningful legwork for his party, pushing Andy Yates to admit that absentee ballot programs benefit the entire ticket. (Ergo fraud also can taint the whole ticket)...

Interesting: No win bonus for McCrae Dowless, as had been rumored in one of the affidavits from Bladen County, according to Andy Yates. #nc09
@TravisFain https://t.co/xD40VXeOJm
He is also claiming that he never knew of a This American Life podcast episode all about McCrae Dowless. And he is claiming that those Republicans who knew of Dowless's methods, even as they failed to mention those methods, urged him to hire Dowless for Harris's campaign. /3
So basically: Andy Yates is claiming he didn't know that Dowless had incriminated himself at a 2016 election. He is claiming that the GOP officials, including Dallas Woodhouse (who all knew about 2016 and even attended the 2016 hearing), never mentioned any of it. /2

State elex officials are showing emails between Beth Harris and Andy Yates, a reminder of the very central role Mark Harris's wife played in monitoring her husband's progress in absentee-ballot voting in #nc09. /1
Mark Harris general consultant Andy Yates said he is "deeply disturbed" by the testimony implicating McCrae Dowless in election fraud in #NC09. He would have fired him immediately or resigned and reported the activity to the state board had he known during the campaign, he said.
Yates is a confident witness and makes it all sound so normal, like there was no reason to see red flags in Dowless's methods. He never demanded receipts for expenses, nor evidence for the number of ballot request forms he was submitting. #nc09
Yates: Dowless liked to get his checks hand delivered, not mailed. But never asked to be paid in cash. #nc09
Fun fact: Mark Harris general consultant Andy Yates said he paid Dowless for various GOTV functions, including staffing the Beast of Bladenboro festival. What is that, you ask? #nc09 https://t.co/YWvenAu9K8
Worth noting that Mitchell Edwards, whose testimony is being a little bit shredded by Agnes Willis, is still here. He is likely to be called back to revisit whether he improperly saw the sheriff's early-vote tallies. Here he is outside the hearing room in blue shirt. #nc09 https://t.co/G0uTGqkFfl
And finally, we know Tojie King is white because the shift list for early-voting lists the race of everybody working that day. Again, wish I knew what that was about /4
Willis, who witnessed early-vote tape being illegally scrutinized by four or five poll workers the Saturday before elex day, said one of those workers, a white man named Tojie King, said, "OMG I thought the black guy had that," with his finger pointing to sheriff's race. /3
And it seems that we're seeing evidence that in some ways the irregularities in Bladen County had more to do with the sheriff's race than Mark Harris v. Dan McCready. #nc09 /2
We're now getting at some racial undercurrents in Bladen County. Polll worker Agnes Willis is explaining why the sheriff's race was "hot" -- because the incumbent, Jim McVicker, is white, "older, seasoned," and the challenger, Hakeem Brown, was a "younger, black" man. #nc09  /1

We are now waiting for the actual tape. I think a tape-curling demonstration is coming.
We are now officially in hanging chad country. Marc Elias is asking poll worker how he could have seen sheriff's race results but no others, given the way the results tape curls up and the sheriff's numbers are "smack dab in the middle." #nc09
Amazing exchange on lack of elex training/oversight in Bladen, where poll workers improperly printed early vote tally b4 election day.	Strach: Do you now understand that’s not the way we do it?	Edwards: I haven’t been told that until you just said it.	Strach: I think you will be.
Coy Mitchell Edwards has taken stand in #nc09 hearing - poll judge who (illegally) ran early voting results tape the Saturday before the November election. He said he was trained to do it. Recipe for fraud, but still no evidence of intentional sharing of tape with candidates.

@DallasWoodhouse @JoeBrunoWSOC9 @NickOchsnerWBTV Then why is he asking for immunity?
@TravisFain @JoeBrunoWSOC9 If he is compelled to testify he could never be prosecuted under NC law. He could spill beans without risk if there are beans to spill.

@TravisFain @JoeBrunoWSOC9 And yes immunity from criminal prosecution under state statute. Presumably not immunity from federal prosecution, though there seeems to be little risk of that in NC at the moment ...

Mark Harris's campaign was served a subpoena today in the investigation of potential election fraud in NC-09. Big question: What did Harris know about the activities of McCrae Dowless? https://t.co/OVqypmOJIe
It's worth noting that the NC elex board's investigation is NOT partisan. The nine-member board, with 4 Dems, 4 Repubs and one unaffiliated, voted NINE ZERO not to certify the results in NC-09.
"In the best interest of this investigation, and completely of my own accord, I resign from the North Carolina Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, effective immediately."/5
"The investigation should be free of attempts at distraction and obstruction so that the truth can be revealed. I will not allow myself to be used as an instrument of distraction in this investigation."/4
"The investigation of criminal conduct and absentee voting fraud in the 2018 Republican primary and 2018 general election in Congressional District 9 is a matter of vital importance to our democracy," Penry wrote./3
Penry had come under attack from Republicans, who accused of him of partisan motives in leading the investigation. Penry has been an active and voicy critic of President Trump in his Twitter feed./2

@McCreadyForNC Hi Dan can you DM me to trade #s so we can talk about the SBE's decision this morning? Thanks!
NC election officials just left open the possibility of calling for a new election in NC-09, after voting to hold an evidentiary hearing by Dec. 9 to examine allegations of voter fraud that may have tainted Republican Mark Harris's 905-vote margin.
NC State Board of Elections just voted to hold an evidentiary hearing by Dec. 9. NC-09 is NOT going to be decided any time soon. Rwo Republicans voted with the majority -- 7-2
Question: Will Robert Higdon, the EDNC U.S. attorney, investigate allegations of voter fraud in NC-09 that seems to have benefitted a Republican, Mark Harris? Higdon is the guy who tried to subpoena voter records in 44 NC counties this fall in the name of combatting voter fraud.
Next week, the current board, made up according to the latest GOP legislation, will disband because of one of those court rulings. But guess what? Cooper will reconstitute the board under the old, old rules. 3 Dems., 2 Repubs. There's nothing the GOP can do to stop him./3
Two bills to alter the make-up of the state board in ways that take power away from the governor have been declared unconstitutional by state judges. Separately, voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have further eroded the governor's power./2
The untold story in NC is that the General Assembly has been trying -- and failing -- to wrest control of the state board of elections from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. They want this investigation of election fraud in NC-09 to go away, but it's not gonna./1

Walker: "At this point, the manual recount has begun. Canvassing boards have been trained and used these rules in prior manual recounts. The rules are clear and provide examples. To enjoin the use of the rules at this point would likely create a bigger problem."/6
Like, arrows and "DON'T COUNT THIS" are required when two choices are circled. And if a voter circles instead of filling in, it only counts if that's the way he did it in all races./5
The other suit, from Nelson and the DSCC, sought to change the ballot-counting rules for a manual recount. Walker said "magic words" and consistency rules are fine./4
No can do, Walker ruled. But he did ding Scott for "toeing the line" between imprudent rhetoric and problematic state action. Crossing that line, he wrote, "ventures into a thicket of actual or potential bias. Then, constitutional alarm bells ring."
One is the suit from the League of Women Voters seeking to force Rick Scott to recuse himself from overseeing the election in his official capacity as governor./2

@ScottforFlorida This is false. No order. Judge Tuter asked the parties to reach an agreement to add security. Suggested three deputies. "I’m not casting any aspersions. I don’t have any evidence."
Overheard security officers at the Broward County elections HQ tonight about a woman providing security for two recount observers who came through with a gun on her hip. She was stopped by the mag. The mag worked. She left without protest.
I wonder if he was also talking to a certain person in Washington?
Florida judge says there's no evidence of fraud in Broward, denies Scott's request to impound equipment, tells everyone to tone down the rhetoric bc the nation is watching.

Broward elex supervisor Brenda Snipes says Broward WILL finish the machine recount by Thursday.
Broward elex supervisor Brenda Snipes told us just now that there are only 200 absentee/overseas/military ballots remaining to be counted here.
Broward elex officials just verified the sorting/counting machines, locked away the test ballots used for that and sealed the bin with tape and a seal number. This is a slow process.
Watching the paint dry in Broward County. They’re sorting the ballots — taking the top page and setting it aside bc that’s the only one they need. Lawyers here say they won’t finish the sort today, let alone actually start tabulating.

Worth remembering that Kemp launched a voter-fraud investigation in 2014 of the New Georgia Project, the voter-reg group that Abrams founded. The investigation ended with no findings of wrong-doing.
Brian Kemp has launched an investigation into the Georgia Democratic party for allegedly trying to hack into the state voter rolls. Stacey Abrams didn't even know about it on CNN but quickly called it "desperate."

At the end of today the state emergency management operation will wind down and conclude its search -- without finding #HannahGraham
TAKEAWAY #2: State emergency folks think they are doing a great job looking for #HannahGraham.
On *WEDNESDAY* -- five days after #hannahgraham disappeared -- state emergency folks said they needed more resources to launch a search.
Takeaway: C-ville police are still stumped. They are not calling the POI a suspect. But they still want to talk to him.
POI left area "at a high rate of speed" after he left C-ville police station. State police issued arrest warrant for reckless driving.
C-ville police chief says the PIO walked into station yesterday, asked for a lawyer, got one and then the two of them left.
C-ville police chief Tim Longo describes seizing the PIO's car and flashes pictures of it on a screen. They're still desperate for leads.

"We're interested in him." -- C-ville police chief Tim Longo.
The man who had a drink with Hannah Graham and drove her away from the downtown mall was in the apartment during the police search today.
The Charlottesville police are screaming for more evidence from the public. "We need your help" -- Chief Tim Longo.
"We have every reason to believe Ms. Graham was in that vehicle." -- C-ville police on Hannah Graham.
We don't even know what the crime was or who the suspect is, and Tim Longo is talking about scoring a conviction. Strange.
Longo suggests that people saw Hannah Graham with a person of interest. He seems angry that no one stopped her and more tips aren't coming.
Tim Longo, C-ville police chief, begins press conference with emotional speech about everyone's responsibility to help find her.
