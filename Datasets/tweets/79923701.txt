@Nelba_MG sending your family all the love in the world today.
It’s worse than that, Jason, because the reverse is true. Both Hamilton and Burr outlived the children to whom they are singing. There is no greater agony. 	Tomorrow’s not promised, but we make plans anyway. We hope for the best anyway. We must. 	❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/5BtUVIbtVK
Wanted to switch up the styles of Burr and Hamilton, so that we contrast their approaches more; it’s the last verbal confrontation, so I just dared myself to make them speak more plainly to each other. https://t.co/xVtQzaeh4S

Gmorning	from the moment of total darkness when the lights go out	To your eyes	searching for anything—	A ray of light from the doorway, a digital clock	&amp; slowly, building from that source, until familiar shapes appear.	You are home-	You needed only a pinprick of light to begin.

@LacketyLac ...yeah, I caught it 😎 https://t.co/8uCu6Orp4T
@SamZoidberg I don't think I'd immediately jump to "the enemies I've made might hold their own parade..."that's like, PEAK Hamilton.	We both love New York. But we're very different. I'm a lifer, I was born in Roosevelt Hospital. He adopted this city, and it adopted him.
@fvmero Not only one of my favorite songs, but one of my favorite writing days of my life.
@Linmirandacom We're moving too fast. We telescope the postwar time til the beginning of government in Nonstop, 10 years pass in that song.
@meghan_jaya Chronologically, it goes right in the middle of Nonstop, after the Federalist Papers, when NY adopts the constitution. Which is why it could never be in the show. It's an alternate timeline Act One closer.
@Linmirandacom He's one of the first people I told about Hamilton in 2008.	I pitched him the moment in the book as one we missed and he said, "Oh, that's good."	That was it.
@mesouthgate 2 things:	I got a full night of sleep.	I wore a tux to the recording session. (you HAVE to hit the notes if you're wearing a tux.)
@LacketyLac Remember when you snuck the Alexander Hamilton theme in the trumpet section on "I'm just getting started" and then I snuck the "Death like a memory" drum pattern in "I can't say I've made it?"	That was also awesome.
@cafebusteloking That took a while. It's an act one closer for an alternate universe Hamilton musical. I knew I'd have to get back in the duds, so you know it's Ham, not me singing. I invited @Ozrodriguez01 to the recording session and he pitched the contemporary NY shots and the Black &amp; White.
@richvoreanski After the first stanza, John and I looked at each other and realized, "Oh sh**, we're writing a NEW YORK song." We'd talked a lot about how Hamilton felt in that moment, but that aspect of it snuck up on us.
@Smol_is_Lou JUST before I left for Wales in August. I drove up to John's cabin upstate and we knocked it out in a day. It was miraculous. He's SO FAST.

@Alpha_ABCE Even *if the subject matter is hard, that is
@Alpha_ABCE Your songs will speak for themselves. Or they will, with lots of practice. All you need is someone willing to really listen. I wish you all the luck in the world, and I wish you FUN as you write. Even the subject is hard, there is fun to be had in the DOING of it.	❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@Alpha_ABCE If you can get the song, or feeling, or thought out of your head, you can look at what you’re working with. If you can look at it with someone you trust, now you’ve got MORE eyes on it. More perspectives to shape what you want. Does that make sense?
@Alpha_ABCE Well yes, you write for yourself. You are your first &amp; most important audience.	But sharing your music with someone you trust will make it better. By better, I mean closing the gap between what YOU feel &amp; what your SONG makes people feel.	Our life is about closing that gap.
Get your head around each song—what do you need it to do? Where are they at the start, where are they at the end of your song?	Musicalize the parts that sing the most to you. Those parts of the story should light up in your head. 	Vary your tempos. Surprise us. 	I wish you luck! https://t.co/X0hfzivtBk

@DFelsenfeld @dloehr @terryteachout Ooh I dunno but @CassRMorris would know. 	My proudest one of these is “as you can see I kept a record of every CHECK in my CHECKered history CHECK it again against your LIST n see/conSIStency...”
@dloehr @terryteachout Oh SHIT. I’m gonna live in this thread of replies forever.
@DavidMCarl Yeah, but that’s filed under “movies” in my head :)
@GavinLiamLogan Yeah, but that’s not internal rhyme. Great three syllable rhymes though!
@terryteachout I gasped when I heard it too. 🙌🏾
@Songbird_7_ @conor610 @AngrySondheim That’s a fantastic 4-syllable A in an A-B-A-B rhyme scheme.	And even within that song, “attractive a man” and “act of a man” knocks me out even more.
My favorite internal rhyme in a musical occurs in Bye Bye Birdie:	“Take off the gloomy mask of TRAGEDY, it’s not your style.	You’ll look so good that you’ll be GLADJA DE-cided to smile.”	That’s just... https://t.co/gi52mdKBeW

That was pretty extra, huh. You just wanted la fun fact, probably. Well, fun fact: I’m a former English teacher and I take essays super seriously! ☺️
Introduction, thesis, three proofs of thesis, conclusion. And give us a real thesis, not “he likes New Girl, these are three times he mentioned it.” Dig deep. Find common themes. Find what in the work resonates with you. Imagine *I’m* grading it. Good luck! https://t.co/OYvkZu7TEk
And I took a loud sip of coffee on the 	*sips coffee* greeting, so that’s a nice ASMR shiver for you, there may be others. https://t.co/2IraYgJxeX
These greetings (and this timeline) are the closest thing I’ve ever had to a journal. Reading them brings back the specific days I wrote them, the pre-coffee fogs and late night hazes in which I wrote them.

@dcjpad in many cases, librettists write monologues and scenes which the songwriting team then musicalizes!	So, yes, I quoted this immortal lyric, the most thrilling moment in a thrilling show, because Masteroff’s a part of that too. Thanks for allowing me to elaborate! 2/2.
@dcjpad It IS interesting! Masteroff built the scaffolding for this immortal lyric to exist. People often think Librettists only write “the scenes between the songs” when they are in fact responsible for the structure of the evening, and a song often lives or dies by their work, or! 1/2
