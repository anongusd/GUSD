@jayasax Around 1999? This is when @ParisHilton was out every night club hopping in LA. Was in the restroom and she flew in screaming ‚ÄúI lost my purse, omg, has anyone seen it, help!‚Äù. Rumor around town was she always lost her purse.
@jayasax I met @MalinAkerman 2007ish when I had my vintage furniture store in Venice, she bought some chairs from me. I delivered them to her home, and her stepmom and her were the kindest people ever!
@jayasax Went up to @HarveyFierstein at Rexal Drug Store on Beverly Blvd/ LA early 2000s. Told him he was fantastic in #MrsDoubtfire. He was nice, but could tell he jut wanted to shop.
@jayasax I‚Äôve got a bunch: @BillyZane and I outside a club in Hollywood (2000ish) trying to get in. He had done a movie with my dad years earlier and the bouncer didn‚Äôt know who he was. I was like dude, This is Billy ZANE, let him in!
I‚Äôm so tired of seeing blankets draped at the end of a bed in magazines and online. It looks terrible and messy. Please stop doing it. #designmistake
