LInkedIn Users - How much would you be willing to pay for a "slimmed down" version of #LinkedIn #Sales Navigator? $20? $30? something else?
What's your favorite feature of #LinkedIn or #SalesNavigaror feature? #ILike
@LinkedInHelp I submitted a case weeks ago and it did not show up. Thought it was just a delay. NOPE. I submitted another just now. It show no open cases. Nothing on the LinkedIn (.com) side either https://t.co/C60ps2AI98
Do you get your 5 hours of learning in each week? https://t.co/LVjbHHXdWK
@LinkedInHelp So you must use keywords to be able to access 3rd level connections? What if you don't want to use a keyword?
@linkedinhelp I need to know about the connectivity between Salesforce and Sales Navigator (various versions). One key element is adding LinkedIn data to SF, can you provide a link?
@LinkedInHelp Has the ability to search on 3's been removed from https://t.co/6tOn5DHaJp? Is it only a Premium feature now? I have #SalesNavigator so I can still search on them, but it's a major inconvenience.  PLEASE TELL ME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. https://t.co/tOikvyDqok

@LinkedInHelp Thanks a lot. Mine is working right again today.
@LinkedInHelp The email notifications show there are indeed carriage returns in messages, but the LinkedIn Inbox sems to strip them out in the display. Still - is it a bug or a feature? https://t.co/6GNC4EgkG2
@LinkedInHelp It's the same story with Hard and Soft carriage returns getting stripped out of messages, InMails seem to be OK, just connection requests and standard messages.
@LinkedInHelp  Messages sent &amp; received are stripped of carriage returns, ALL the text loaded into 1 paragraph. All of us see this. Temporary issue? New feature? Bug? Images before sending and after, no CR's after sent https://t.co/Gza8AyRiGC
@LinkedInHelp Thanks. I submitted a ticket. Others around me here are having the same problem. Thought you might know something about it.
@LinkedInHelp the search URL - https://t.co/nfsH9fAzhV

@LinkedInHelp The #LinkedIn #SalesNavigator team says it's a bug that the messages are not send and they know about it.
@LinkedInHelp I am not trying to REPLY, just want to know what address it is being sent from so I can find it when I resend it (as it's expired), what is the sending email address you use for this?
@skype Looks like the file size sending limit has been reduced once again, now to 100Mb??? The help system still says 300Mb. THIS IS WAY TOO SMALL, even at 300Mb.
@LinkedInHelp What #LinkedIn email address does the Data Download come from?  I'm pretty sure I can find it if I know the email address. https://t.co/H6NunG9ltu

@LinkedInHelp This does not answer the question about "wanting to hear from people"
@LinkedInHelp How do I initiate something like this in the stream? "Mike O'Neil wants to hear from people who know Management and Entrepreneurship"? Can you send instructions?

@LinkedInHelp I can’t express how “inconvenienced” YOUR/MY #LinkedIn clients are w/yrs of hard work deleted this last week by @LinkedIn
@LinkedInHelp a little more notice should be nice, we spent years tagging people and much of it is meaningless now
@linkedinhelp Clients can't tag 2's and 3's ahead of the stated 2/25 feature deletion date, what's up?
@LinkedInHelp Was this a result of the features that #LinkedIn has been systematically deleting? 43%!!! https://t.co/750sQedVqR

@LinkedIn My clients are paying #LinkedIn $60/mo to tag 2's and 3's, they will STOP paying now, THIS WAS STUPID by @LinkedIn - AGAIN
@LInkedInHelp - Since you did not know the answer - "we are sunsetting saved contacts and tagging 2's and 3's" Thought you should know too
@LinkedInHelp JMG - I don't understand what you mean by "will be in touch via email here: 160216-008294"
@LinkedInHelp Hear terrible rumour that ALL #LinkedIn tagging is being eliminated on 2/25. I MUST KNOW if this is the case
@LinkedInHelp I found a ticket via email - 160216-008294
@LinkedInHelp Where do I get a ticket #, no email was sent and I don't see the ticket log that used to be there https://t.co/0yUFAb8MtA
Hey @LinkedIn now is not a good time to drop features &amp; add bugs, 43% stock dive, Facebook at Work coming https://t.co/si9v0TUHCQ

Hey @LinkedIn this from a mutual customer - They make it tougher every day.  I’m searching for other solutions daily. ANYONE LISTENING?
Anyone wishing they could revert to a 3 year old version of #LinkedIn? @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp
@SteveSmithsonUA it’s a client requirement on the NDA
Will the 40% drop in @LinkedIn stock wake up #LinkedIn Execs with options to start helping vs hurting users? pls comment
@SteveSmithsonUA would like to chat sometime Steve, might need an NDA if it’s ok
@SteveSmithsonUA I run Linked To Denver, 37k members, 2 others, one is GID 1751, an oldie
@SteveSmithsonUA THX, will join the forum, working a big #LinkedIn Group consulting project that is hampered by changes, bugs
@SteveSmithsonUA my clients are very upset about the #LinkedIn Groups changes, how does LI know which are most important?
@SteveSmithsonUA we are in the same cloth, I did the 1st ever #LinkedIn training at the U of Denver in 2006, @LinkedIn sponsored it
@LinkedInHelp I’ve received “I’ll pass it on” 100 times here and It only gets WORSE, I’m a 10 year #LinkedIn expert, LISTEN
@LinkedInHelp what members are telling #LinkedIn to drop features and add bugs? You are listening to the wrong people
@LinkedInHelp your stock price should be a wake up call to fix bugs and ADD vs REMOVE features #disappointed
@LinkedInHelp WHY was the sorting feature removed, users cannot understand this assault on LinkedIn features, PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY
@LinkedInHelp Where is the "Sort By New" Feature that was there last week? See Pic, is it another bug? https://t.co/nx2CZLKAmk

@LinkedInHelp My clients are VERY #DISAPPOINTED at the growing number of #LinkedIn bugs and deleted features #WTF!
@LinkedInHelp Did you get feedback that people don't want to see the new connections as they have been? Its a problem they are having?

@LinkedInHelp How do you keep from going over the limit if 1) you don't know what it is and 2) have little means to track the #?
@LinkedInHelp I have people I work with and know that say the limit for sending group member messages is ZERO, is that true?
@abluegreenunivs I do 1-on-1 #LinkedIn coaching for individuals, Social Selling training packages for companies
RT @JayCharlesSmith @LinkedInHelp In my case, the #LinkedIn Send Limit was 0! Never sent a group message and was blocked immediately!

@LinkedInHelp We used to be able to arrange all positions, was that feature removed?
@LinkedInHelp "Only people using LinkedIn group messaging will be affected by it not working" - just the smartest people on all of #LinkedIn
@LinkedInHelp "We do not disclose the number of _______ to penalize you, but you're over it and I won't tell you when you can have it back"?
@LinkedInHelp Can I rearrange only current positions, past positions or can I rearrange all positions on a profile?
@LinkedInHelp You can't tell people you can only send "so many" and not tell them what "so many" is. I can't send any and its been a week!

Have you been restricted on #LinkedIn lately? If so, what do you think triggered it
After deleting 15,000+ #LinkedIn connections to stay under the 30k limit, you end up with a pretty beefy network
@linkedinhelp I am back in business, thanks, I sure would like to know what caused me to be restricted for what looks like 24 hours tho
@LinkedInHelp If I wasn't locked out I could do this
@texrat Until LinkedIn does that, I suggest a Reply, I use "Auto Text Expander" to make it simple, a few keystrokes
@LinkedInHelp Is "a few moments" something like 24 hours in #LinkedIn speak? I have important work to do
@texrat I get it - "Do you mind if I ask why you are inviting me?" Is that right? You can Reply before accepting now
@texrat Send me your profile URL and I'll take a looksie &amp; see if it gives me any clues
Reach out to me for the deep insider stuff on #LinkedIn #SalesNavigator, "its not in the brochure"
@Chris_Boyland Nice #LinkedIn profile Chris, I suggest you add a header/background image, try a city skyline
@texrat #LinkedIn does a lot to encourage you to connect to people you don't know w/generic invites, them come IDK's &amp; a restriction
@sportislife You must have a free #LinkedIn account, right Carsten?
@LinkedInHelp When it says "LinkedIn is momentarily unavailable, but should return in a few moments", how long is a few moments?
@Alwi_Eisner I know Viv better than you know, she is grt, it's a tricky LinkedIn restriction issue involving cookies &amp; rule changes
@linkedinhelo "LinkedIn is Momentarily Unavailable" - how long is a #LinkedIn moment? It's been at least 10 hours
@LinkedInHelp Appears to originated by an account restriction issue, doesn't matter what user logs in afte. Blocks any account, cookies?
@Caleb_Townsend I miss the #LinkedIn #Amazon reading list too!
@LinkedInQueen Is #LinkedIn Up or Down for you in DFW right now? Extended outage here in MN? Can't DM you

@LinkedInHelp #LinkedIn down on PC, Mac, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, all browsers, but NOT on Mobile - a clue 4U
Are you affected by an extended #LinkedIn outage? If so, where are you located?

OK, I'm now on #ELLO, a 'lil baffled, but I'm in - they add 40k new members/hr in a closed beta? http://t.co/R8U0Wk2tYn
Want clickable links in your #LinkedIn messages? Use "www." and not "http://", LinkedIn changed some things
@linkedinhelp - I cannot explain these strange #LinkedIn occurrences to clients, what applies to one does not apply to another
@linkedinhelp - Not all users have the new #LinkedIn interface, others are missing the "Group" option when inviting, they are freaking too
@linkedinhelp - The personal #LinkedIn invitation option is buried here, see pic http://t.co/Vt2QAF5eok
@linkedInhelp - people are freaking out RE the new "personalized #LinkedIn invite" process, goodbye colleague-classmate...
@LinkedInHelp Previous tweet - Case #141001-012687
@linkedinhelp Connect button ON PROFILE instantly sends invite, see pics http://t.co/B4gYcoLPFE http://t.co/RiK5iMQzFP
@LinkedInHelp I submitted a ticket, #141001-011790
@LinkedInHelp Here is the pic I've been sending RE: not being able to invite 3's, premium subscriber http://t.co/DfBichnxXD
@LinkedInHelp STH - Can you please help me invite this "3" from their profile as instructed? I am Premium http://t.co/DfBichnxXD
@TeenStarComp You can call it singing, veoid of me performing at The Fillmore in SF, 2010, http://t.co/Erpce73MNr
@LinkedInHelp STH - Can you please point out how I invite this "3" from their profile as I was just instructed? http://t.co/DfBichnxXD
@linkedinhelp A picture tells a thousands words, how to invite a 3 here? Look closely, http://t.co/nleuL9j37J
@linkedinhelp When was the ability to invite 3's removed from the #LinkedIn Premium business plan?  Seems odd to take that away
@LinkedInHelp Yesterday and today, same #LinkedIn profile, see side by side http://t.co/RsVZwNb820  http://t.co/PJle41shFE

@linkedinhelp Is there a setting for reminders I need to set in #LinkedIn, they are not coming through to me

LinkedInHelp I do lots of corporate #LinkedIn support/consulting &amp; can handle 90% of these issues, I'm also @MikeONeilRocks
@LinkedInHelp Sending to 2's in one group to join a different, related group
@LinkedInHelp Company is inviting carefully selected people to a specialty group, member to member messaging in ANOTHER group
@linkedinhelp Is it a #LinkedIn EULA violation to invite someone to join a group if you don't "know them"?
