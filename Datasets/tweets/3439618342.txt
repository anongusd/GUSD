@RepBobbyRush, #DidYouKnow that according to the latest #Alzheimers facts and figures, an early and accurate diagnosis could save up to $7.9 TRILLION in medical and care costs?  #ENDALZ
@RepBobbyRush, have you seen the new 2018 #Alzheimers facts and figures? The newest figures show an INCREASED incidence of the disease! Check the numbers out for yourself-- https://t.co/JRee87BkVn. Now, more than ever, we must commit to #ENDALZ!
@RepBobbyRush, 1 in 10 people 65 and older have #Alzheimers or another form of #dementia.  With an aging population is it imperative that we make addressing these issues a priority.  Please continue to help us fight to #ENDALZ!
@RepBobbyRush, Until we can find a cure for #Alzheimers, we must find ways to intervene and slow the disease's progression.  The #BOLDAlzheimersAct takes steps to ensure progress is made until we can finally #ENDALZ!
