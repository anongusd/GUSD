@pmschocolate @DeletrixV @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange All I said was he was doing his job o never said he did it right or that he was a good guy he was obviously being an asshole, but their jobs are to make sure people are legal citizens
@biratonko @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Are you saying you aren't supposed to carry state ID with you? Cause legally you're.required too just like legally immigrants are required carry their paperwork
@MerMerLkwd @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Do Americans legally have carry their IDs on them for identification purposes when dealing with an officer? So why should immigrants not need carry their information proving they're legal?

@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange üôÑ
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange So is employment
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange üôÑIm not saying there isn't white racism, but because there is racism by white people doesn't mean that white people don't have the issue of being victims of being judged by their race either
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Cause they were lez?
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Just because there are some adoption agencies probably Catholic which will not allow gay couples to adopt does not mean that gay people can't adopt at all it just means from specific religious organizations and other agencies who denied the lesbians is there proof it was simply
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Dumbass
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange It's federal law dumbaaa
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange There was a man just few months ago caught for asking a waitress where the closest church was cause he planned shoot everyone there just because gays have their own.probpwms.doesmt mean straight people don't they just have e different types.of.problems
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange You're allowed to marry, you're allowed to vote, jobs can't discriminate, and gay couples adopt children all the time üôÑ they just have go through same process as everyone else if anything they have it much easier cause they have laws protecting them from.discrimination

@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Bullshit
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Lol in America Christians are persecuted all the time people come into churches predominantly white churches, and slaughter people. Gays have more rights and more accepted in society then they ever been gtfoh with that ba
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Lmao I dont need too
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Then why is OP not taking legal action?
@ConradDeitrick @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange You said moral or legal
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange What white privilege exists that other races don't have?
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange No im a female I'd have worry about being rape and killed if im in wrong neighborhoods  being human trafficked or shot murdered or slaughtered because I'm a white Christian
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Lol I've.had prove citizenship before I had ice come.on a shuttle I was on leaving AZ to NJ I had provide my state Identification card and i showed them my SS as well
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Again there was no crime committed in his scenerio yes the guy was a douchebag but the officer didn't commit a crime
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Privilege? Lol that's funny I've never been handed any special cards giving me free things just because I'm white
@RedcapRage @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Again Germany was in a much different state before the Nazi party began compared to the Holocaust. Plague, starvation, people were dying in masses and Germany was collapsing
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Of talking to a lawyer they'd just be like okay have a good day
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange But we're not talking about those incidences which yes were extremely wrong and disgusting. We are talking about this very specific scenario which why would the officer lie then just let him walk off if he said that there was no proof citizenship I highly doubt even with threats
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Ones who have something to hide
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange If a person has documentation proving their a legal citizenship it shouldn't be a problem. Just like Child protective services if they are called and you have everything in order then it shouldnt be something a person has to worry about. The only people that worry and stress are
@matthewroche @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Officers you don't have to prove citizenship but ICE you do
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange White brunette then asking me see my id see if I was the person's part their job
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Lol i have been when i lived on Mexican border police officer asked me for id etc. Because I had brown hair and I was short white female. I handed him my id he went on was he a dick for it? Yes but did I flip my shit about the racism about it ? No because if their looking for
@DeletrixV @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange I never said he was a liar
@ConradDeitrick @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange No but the officer didn't do anything illegal other than being an asshole
@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange First off he wasn't persecuted was he? No he was let go and told he needed to keep the other documention on him as well he didn't get fined, didn't get physically hurt, the only thing that got hurt was his feelings cause someone was being an asshole doing their job

@HanyuuHiiragi @Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Except fact Germany was in failing state with plague, starvation, no army, and in complete chaos before Hitler was elected and they were already a dictatorship
@jambusher @DeletrixV @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange No but it is there job ask for documentation and confirm the documentation that it isn't fraudulent after phone call officer shouldn't have harrassed him, but there's assholes in every job üôÑ
@Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Lol you obviously don't if you believe right now were in Nazi times
@socialism_doer @EzzyMix2 @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange There were alot of things that lead up to Hitler's rise does this mean we are in the same boat? No we have checks and balances system in order to prevent this from happening. Also German was in bad shape after ww1 we aren't in the same desperation they were in at the time
@ZezeSwanson @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange @ICEgov So you're saying no one's ever faked documentation before?
@Goldfishboston @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange They didn't have be assholes you're right but unfortunately there's assholes in every job
@Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Nothing like the beginning of Holocaust
@Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange When Holocaust first started Germany was already a dictatorship were in united.states we have system to prevent that. Germany was in a state in which there was mass disease and starvation due to the end of world war one. There were several different components in which we are
@Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Those who went through the Holocaust were tortured, their families were murdered infront of them, people were put in gas chambers, and. Children were mutilated this isn't the Holocaust this is someone who's having tantrum cause someone was being as asshole at their job
@Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Did anyone die in this situation? No she was asked to she her legal documentation, and when she did they had to confirm it because she didn't have all the documentation she needed
@EzzyMix2 @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange It's disgusting the left uses the term Nazi like it's a small thing. Using it as a constant metaphor is diminishing what the survivors went through. This situation wasnt like Nazi Germany if it was they would just been shot or murdered. Stop diminishing the survivors
@Riggsveda @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange I actually think it's sickening how many people compare this to the horror and torture the people in Auschwitz went through. By doing this you are making light of the Holocaust and disrespecting those who survived it
@DeletrixV @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange Whole conversation on the other side of the phone
@DeletrixV @MohanadElshieky @lexforchange After the phone call they should have let her go, and after the phone call i agree is harassment. How was she able to hear what the person on the phone was saying? Unless they put the person on speaker which I doubt an officer would do its hard believe she could clearly hear

@teckyb01 @CNN Have proof? ü§î
@RepSpeier @realDonaldTrump Nothing back? Denuclearization is nothing?
@teckyb01 @CNN Actually I lived in Indiana for 3 years while under Pence there wasn't anything I seen that wasn't Christian. Only thing I seen was him trying push for anti abortion and nasty women reaching out tell him about their periods
@jenjen3186 @USATODAY @alia_e Focus on sexual assaults, rape, etc. As one big picture try stop it for all then as it deescalates then start focusing on smaller groups
@jenjen3186 @USATODAY @alia_e It's not about fake news it's about facts. The statistics on this article are off every 98 seconds in this country there is someone who sexually abused and there's high number of them being children. Native Americans are at the highest risk of being sexually abused so why not
@CNN This actually disgusted me. Pence is a good Christian who shares Southern Baptist values, and you want deny him going, because of his boss or political party? What happened to not judging others ?
@USATODAY @alia_e Straight people are going through sexual assault on massive scale as well don't straight people matter as well?
@ABC My god I'm sure the cop would save any child. To make ice jokes is sick just stop.
@TuckerCarlson That's heartbreaking MS13 is terrifying there has  be better system we can set uo to get them off our streets
@LadyThriller69 That's horrible im sorry you went through that.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump He's been working hard working with North Korea to create peace, while Deniros trying get 5 seconds of dating saying F*** trump. If anything don't actors have better shit to do like I don't know make movies or shows than to be trolling the president?
@wilw No one should tell you kill yourself suicide isnt a joke :/
@RealDrGina So immature üôÑCNN for you
@SLR_FL @WiredSources @Cernovich @CNN Explains why CNN sucks anymore
@ByBrianBennett @maggieNYT @Noahbierman @Acosta Because yelling at him will get him to talk to you? Sound like you and CNN acted like kids in movie theater who cant behave annoying to everybody
@Independent Hopefully ni one gets hurt
@WiredSources @Cernovich How old is he?
@DLoesch For fucks sakes if man wants chicken let him eat it!!!
@businessinsider What the hell? I don't get it

RT @dcexaminer: Trump, Kim shake hands before historic North Korea summit in Singapore https://t.co/XekVWzjtCC
@realDonaldTrump I think the meeting will hopefully fix unresolved issues
@kathygriffin @TheRoot Don't look in the mirror then
@TheWeirdWorld They could still be an accident just not to parents taking care them but to biological parents it could be
@DBruceSmith1 @WhosYrHoosier @RomHenry @larryelder I know but they need start listening. To the studies they do
@larryelder @2PAC That's pretty sad for the moms who do their best to play both roles
@Cernovich Absolutely
@realDonaldTrump Good luck with the summit!!!
@nypost It's sick corporations can pretty much run sweat shops, and because they pay right people it takes a long time for them to get caught
@nypost That's heartbreaking the poor bird
@davidhogg111 Politics is corrupted on both sides unfortunately. The best thing you can do is try expose the corruption
@79illwil @larryelder I would agree but isn't black statistics higher than white?
@larryelder The question is what is causing the father's walk out on their kids. I'm sure that the dropping out schools probably linked to not having that father figure
@LadyThriller69 You are amazing

@mikelondoncan @SteveSchmidtSES That's understandable what gets under my skin are the people who immigrate to united States but then continue to fly the Canadian flag. Its their decision, but I find distressful country you're in. If I moved to France I wouldn't fly US flag id fly French flag
@CNNPolitics I smell Red in the SC Air
@billprady @letamericavote It's just to make sure everyone who is voting is a legal citizen. That is unfortunate about the Holocaust survivor, and they need better system that makes it easier for people in her situation to get an I.D. I just personally never encountered anyone without ID who's here legally
@billprady @letamericavote There are government programs that provide transportation for seniors in several states. If they can't drive I am also sure there's local transportation, friends, family, etc
@billprady @letamericavote What I don't understand is why Black people don't have proper photo IDs from the DMV. I mean not to be rude but I've met alot black people, and they've all carried their IDs on them
@DalyPolitics @SteveSchmidtSES Says the person wanting our president dead lmfao
@DalyPolitics @SteveSchmidtSES Cause that doesn't sound like a terroristic comment
@letamericavote @billprady What's racist about them
@JFCasey9 @SteveSchmidtSES Because I believe if you're American you should have an American flag up?  üôÑ Yes that's so horrible
@billprady @Uber @Uber_Support Thats horrible that you went through that. I miss the good old days when it was "The customers always right"
@chelsanneshen What happened in Kentucky I live in Kentucky we rarely have shootings
@JohnStamos He is soooooo tiny he reminds me my daughter she came out 4 lbs how big was he?
@JohnStamos @Honest @jessicaalba Congratulations on the baby!!
@billprady @Uber @Uber_Support Damn that's horrible
@SteveSchmidtSES I have true pride in my country unless there's actual significance like mourning those lost in Nice France or another tragedy I don't believe people should fly another countries flag in our country
@Alabastyr @Destini41 @SteveSchmidtSES Lmao I'm not a Russian bot twitter just got boring for while but now that Facebook's Nazis figured give this olace another try
@dannymasterson are you still doing the ranch
@pewdiepie is it true I heard YouTube has gone Facist on their YouTube stars
@SteveSchmidtSES We aren't Canada though we are the United States. The Canada flag has no place here
@wilw i was surprised during wedding they didn't do more with your character. I was kinda disappointed was expecting you say some words pride and groom
@bigbangtheory omg why wasn't this show on air?
@hitRECordJoe Said I Do
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv I hope the best for you.
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv If it wasn't about the birthday party what actions got you so upset?
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv What actions?
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv So are you guys done with the show?
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv Trust me I totally get being stuck with people you can't stand and getting beyond angry. Why are you frustrated with her though? Is there more to the story than what's shown?
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv It is unfortunate, but why the obsession with Katherine? Last few episodes it makes it out that she's all you think about.
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv I heard that the TV show edited some the scenes to make you guys look bad though. That there were times when cast was hostile to you they didn't show.
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv Are you guys taking Whitney to court? Don't you guys have enough struggles with the rape problem?
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv Can you blame them for not inviting you? This season you treated whole cast like crap
@jcmfanclub No problem! Just wondering how do you guys get so much info?
@missashleyjac01 @peachgrlhanabby @Bravotv I'd that's the case why not just say it at the Reunion?
@peachgrlhanabby @missashleyjac01 @Bravotv Wait how is it not true unofficial bravo TV announced it
@MsAshJacobs how can you be with a man who possibly raped 3 women?

@RyanAFournier Lmfao every liberal ever
@SecPompeo @StateDept Isn't it a bit of a red flag they are all of a sudden willing work with United States?
@elcrazyrobbo @kurteichenwald No many Americans would be from illegals or refugees committing terroristic acts
@RealityMamaPhx @Pataltschul . Things with Katherine are so passionate she is someone most of America can relate to. Thomas pay be a shitty fucked up human but hell always be the father her children and seeing them trying coparent together send good message to those who look up to katherine
@elcrazyrobbo @kurteichenwald I don't want him dead, but it would make sense to blame people responsible which was the parents
@kurteichenwald Why not blame parents who bring kids here illegally
@Pataltschul Only downside is the show won't be as entertaining without then

@davidhogg111 Seems you have more people defending the 2nd amendment than protesting it
@SRuhle @RudyGiuliani You say "sold sex" but that's literally what she does as a living. I think its hilarious someone from news station wants to bash someone about lying to American people you I am sure there's not one word out your mouth that hasn't been lie.

@goldengateblond @Alyssa_Milano @TBSNetwork @FullFrontalSamB If they fire her it's because she called the president's daughter a C*** she deserves be taken off the air

@THEsaragilbert It's disgusting that Rosanne's one people who helped you have a career in first place, and you shun her like shes nothing. She may done something bad but dont use her mistake as way to make money and keep your name fresh it's sickening.

@ipeachnyc @TimWUnderwood All rioting does is 1Shows your ignorance and hatred 2Puts innocent people life at risk 3 Contradicts your protest
@maladamus @10Adge @kidnoble @PursuingMciver he hasn't done anything to be a traitor literally Hillary has though
@phaylen Civics 101 electoral college makes it so every voice heard
@TimWUnderwood then you should leave our country cause he is out president:)
@10Adge @kidnoble @PursuingMciver They chose a person who was honest and didn't care about hurting feelings rather than someone whos liar
@katyeabbott cause that doesn't prove that Hillary supporters are the violent hateful bigots
@hijinkxed your racism and hate proves it's Hillary supporters that are the hateful ones
@Phan821 @SSparklesDaily yet liberals say oh we love peace and Trump breeds hate yet they set cars on fire and hang pinatas of Trump irony
@writerafjanae @boredandspiredx Trump supporters are afraid of minorities attacking them for who they voted for
@hijinkxed Racist
@__shiru @Grubhub @FoxNews That's ridiculous;l and illegal
@WhatTheWolf Trump supporters are afraid immigrants will hurt them there's fear on both sides
@arianaalize its sad that Democrats said Trump breeded hate yet everyone who was Trump supporter had be scared be judged for voting for him
@CNN what the fuck? Why do we have that many illegals
@lucy_ramos_ acting this way they shouldn't be talking about this stuff in front of them

@Femi_Sorry cause wasn't fact she wanted get rid coal mining jobs, approve later term abortion, and let refugees in
@brianrambo4 Until you impose on another person's rights
@dfunzy apparently Hillarys million times worse just look at the riots
@caitiemary02 It is Democracy you should had more Democrats vote get over it
@terrellisdope right burning a head of Trump and having pinatas of Trump hanging by nooses really peaceful lol
@CorriveauDawson because these are riots
@Karachifactor so your going to act the exact thing your protesting ? It's pretty pathetic
@business ironic when Hillary supporters are hanging and burning Pinatas that look like Trump  seems Hillary loves hate
@patilyo21 If they have a problem with Constitution The doors open don't let door hit ya on way out
@eelenamac No but you burn the very glad gives you those rights, call all Trump support white bigots, and destroy our Country
@patilyo21 Thats why we have an electoral college

@Juliecleslie No their not their fighting cause their spoiled brats
@Infermas you can see through the riots who the bigots are lol
@patilyo21 its not going do anything in the end
@eelenamac it's not democracy it's being bunch wild animals you accused Trump supporters of doing

@TheTruPatriot No it's when liberals can't accept the results so they act exactly like what they were protesting
@Stoner_Boi_eLJa No your told that because your protesting by making pinatas of Trump and burning them &amp; burning flags wrong way do it
@sweetsusan49 Hillary supports are being everything they are protesting
@purxposejai that guy was racist lol
@smitashrm @Slate Thats racist
@bmolenar you mean the riots cause it's not peaceful
@Kenna_Luvaas Disappointed in the American people
@lovinmaries this is everything Hillary supporters said Trumpanzees would do its so hypocritical
@TheSKiTTZeR theyre everything they're protesting
@itsallkjs why they are doing the very thing their protesting
@Sy_fyy hopefully no one needs that freeway get to a hospital
@davidscottjaffe @mrklowny The only people acting like wild animals at Trump rally is Hillary supporters
@mrklowny @davidscottjaffe @ChantelleHLee so do exactly what your rioting against if not worse?
@kelleytrebor @manuellagares @HuffPostCrime thank God for it
@Moviebore honestly look the hostility, racism, fear and all out chaos Hillary has breeded into  american people tonight at these protests
@kelleytrebor @manuellagares @HuffPostCrime we all do and Trump's ending speech was he wanted be a president for ALL the american people
@Moviebore The electoral college is what matters not the popular vote just saying
@mrklowny @davidscottjaffe that's not how democracy works you can't just act like bunch wild animals and think you get what you want
@Tom60721745 so instead burn down your country? That makes sense
@MyGoatHill They all need be arrested especially ones making Trump pinatas hanging from noose
@HuronBlueChief Have proof?
@Rhetta_Sukreben Taking what ? You are all doing exactly what your protesting
@HuronBlueChief I've never heard of ANYTHING like that and it would have been considered a hate crime
@kelleytrebor @manuellagares @HuffPostCrime also you realize they hung pinatas by nooses which  considered death threat in front Trump tower
@HuronBlueChief They didn't hang pinatas that looked like Obama in front the white house or riot
@Thatbull_Rob with out who?
@HuronBlueChief The American people voted for him get over it
@XaviiMatisse actually burning flags, disrespecting your country, making death threats on future president makes you just vulgar and vile
@Ltserb No one here is rioting because we're smart enough to not kill each other over politics
@The_NewRight They hung Trump pinata with noose wonder what they would done if we did that with Obama or Hillary
@hakukuze except we never hung a life size version of Obama with a noose or attacked people for voting for him
@G4mefrk martial Laws coming
@SomeAussieFuck they all need be deported
@RemejyKnarf really says people rioting spreading hatred and racism &amp; being violent
@Ltserb I'm so disappointed and heartbroken there are better ways to protest
@salmanaudi Not when they burn flags and death threatening our soon be president
@TruckMafk she doesn't want people to riot
@victorortiz14 You realize that Hillary helped rapists get out prison time ?
@Ltserb Then you shouldn't be in the military it's sad to think one of our military officials doesn't have any respect for their country
@QueenHelena1 What do you mean "People like me?" Racist much ?
@OryansReflexion Martial law &amp; Female camps
@_pearlsNcurls If you don't like the Constitution then you need to move
@Ltserb But the flag you burn is the reason why you even have the right of freedom of speech
@_pearlsNcurls bet you wouldn't have said that if Clinton won
@ElizabethWetze2 Or showing that Hillarys supporters didn't breed hatred or racism which is why they aren't rioting right now (sarcasm)
@QueenHelena1 you can't even give one example
@Ltserb I have freedom speech cause this great country gave me that right people who want death to America simply just shouldn't be in u.s.a
@kelleytrebor @manuellagares https://t.co/6ZrQjeBz6D
@Ltserb whoever burns a flag needs be deported
@Sheep2Wolves and shouldn't be burning our flags lol
@Samanth11504539 they think shooting people and rioting proves that "Trump's the violent one" Lol
@QueenHelena1 what did Trump say that was racist ?
@manuellagares @kelleytrebor what's peaceful about shooting 4 people? Or burning our American flag? Or attacking Trump supporters
@nowisation there has been no threats killing colored people
@sjredmond Hillary support get mad about Trump spreading hatred and racism turn around saying all white people are bigots &amp; shoot people
@vbspurs liberal logic lol
@vbspurs let's protest Trump for breeding hate and racism by burning flags shooting people &amp; call all white people bigots deplorables &amp; dumb
@realftmadrid yet Democrats are shooting people, burning flags spreading racism &amp; hatred
@strongforwesley just remember the Democrats point finger saying we bred hate yet this is exactly what your doing now
@manuellagares they also say they are liberals peace and love then shot 4 people cause their candidate lost lol
@KobraBoss why
@lachysonicstar how does he not ? Last night his acceptance speech showed all of that
@QueenHelena1 as racist as racist gets it was very loud and clear in her emails
@QueenHelena1 Heres the thing Trump was open about his thoughts and feelings telling America blunt here's my thought Hillary was
@torchwicks well 1. Not every business failed he wouldn't be billionaire if that's the case lmao
@torchwicks well 1. A reality TV show literally can't it's a thing not person but if your talking about Trump it's because he'll bring jobs
@BullittBourbon great again
@BullittBourbon give my life for me don't you mean they won't give their life for me? And I don't expect them too I expect them make America
@QueenHelena1 no matter how anyone acts we will always be divided as long as everyone is offended by every little thing people say or do
@torchwicks whats the point in protesting
@AndreHolder_  irony is they said Trump breeded racism and hatred yet Hillary supporters shot people and rioting
@BullittBourbon its too late
