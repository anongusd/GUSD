Obama: "At the point when we've taken certain actions we can divulge publicly we will do so." Some moves only  Russia will know about.
Obama on hacking: "The idea that public shaming is going to be effective doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well."
Obama: I saw Putin in Sept told him to "cut it out and there would be serious consequences if he didn't."	Official IC attribution was 10/7.
Seems worth a reminder that the date of the US intelligence community attribution was October 7.		Leaks went on all summer.
Meanwhile @SenatorBurr says Intel Committee "follow the intelligence wherever it leads" &amp; "will take the time to get it right"
Special committee would ‚Äúinvestigate pressing cybersecurity matters, starting with Russian interference with the election" - @jimlangevin

If you discover a bug allowing agents to get into iPhone, would you tell Apple about it?	LE official: I'd rather not speculate. #AppleVsFBI
Why postpone if not 100% sure it'll work? Y not pursue both avenues? LE officials: Getting Apple's help was always last resort. #AppleVsFBI
Law enforcement is NOT asking for Apple's assistance with its testing of this new method presented by the outside party. #AppleVsFBI
Law enforcement insists FBI has been continuously working ways into phone even during monthlong period of litigation w/company. #AppleVsFBI
Approx 2:45p EST today USG contacted Apple re: continuance. Outside party demo'd to FBI possible way to unlock phone on Sunday. #AppleVsFBI
Is canceling a missed opportunity for USG as a test case? LE: It's always been about this phone &amp; evidence that might be on it #AppleVsFBI
LE officials: 	There's been a lot of worldwide publicity &amp; attn to this case. Lot of ppl outside gov contacting us w/research #AppleVsFBI
Law enforcement official says California judge did grant the motion, so the hearing is officially cancelled. #AppleVsFBI
