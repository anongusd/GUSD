Gov't plans won't work without controlling costs from provider side.  Vilifying ins. companies won't help.  Neither will gov't option.
Gov't must prevent people from buying insurance only after they have experienced a loss.  Insurance don't work that way.
More competion will help.  So will regulation that levels the playing field for all.
The way to keep premiums down is to reduce amt of loss...e.g. medical costs.  Less defensive medicine, tort reform, records efficiency.
Insurance companies pool risk which is the probability of loss.  They take something from everyone and pay to the unfortunate few.

I can't beieve that the stimulus bill actually requires that states take their dole.  There is no choice even if they don't want the money.

House just passed the stimulus bill

The problem with the plan as he is describing it is that much of the stimulus is delayed.  Which means we can debate those issues.
