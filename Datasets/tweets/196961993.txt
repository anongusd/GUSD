God's love for us is unconditional. Ours for Him should be the same.
You can enjoy the journey by understanding God's love for you. You can rest in knowing that His plans, His purposes, and His blessings are so much greater than your worries.
God‚Äôs not here to condemn us and make us feel bad about ourselves. But He will convict us and challenge us to come up higher.

Love is kind. 	Treat each other like you might be spending eternity together.
Just because you can't see the air, doesn't mean you stop breathing. Just because you can't see God doesn't mean you stop believing.

If God changes your heart, be willing to change your plans.
Whatever God calls you to do He equips you to do as well.
If you have been straying away from God lately because of a mistake, He wants you to know today that you do not have to go any farther. He loves you so much, and He has been waiting for you to come back and find your healing in Him.
Be your best, and life will be too.

Your scars can be a reminder of the pain, or they can be a reminder of the grace of God. Those scars are not there to depress you; they are there to encourage you. They are reminders of what God has brought you through.
Judge your worth and value by what God says about you in His Word, not by how somebody else treats you. (Ephesians 2:4-10)
We are products of our past, but we don't have to be prisoners of it.

People all around us are wounded. They‚Äôre lonely, discouraged, they feel guilty. But when they see your scar, when they hear how God healed you, restored you, blessed you, that will breathe new life into their spirit.
Forgiveness doesn‚Äôt mean that what the other person did was right. It means that you are releasing the situation to God and trusting Him with every detail.
At the cross, the exchange was that Christ took our sins and made us as white as snow. Hallelujah!!!

Everyone has a past; however, if you want a change in your life, if you want forgiveness, peace and joy, God demands total surrender. Surrendering to Jesus Christ will clean your slate and shape your future.
