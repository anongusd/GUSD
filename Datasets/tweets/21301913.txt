.@jacqklimas on North Korea: Right now we're sort of waiting for what the administration wants to do.
.@dankildee: Most analysts say those uninsured will go up under this new healthcare proposal.
.@vdigiorgio67 on Trump: The tone he's setting is great...would like a little more discipline.
.@RJHarrisWHP580: I have yet to find anyone who's upset with the President...everyone understands [the presidency] takes some time.
.@mollyhooper on Trump's 100 Days:  If President Trump does not get tax reform done within first 200 days - that would not be good.
.@EricPapenfuse on Trump: His leadership has driven people apart.
.@EricPapenfuse on his governing since Trump victory: We have record lows for unemployment, we have a tech boom.
.@JerryMoran on North Korea: The line here is we're trying to do everything we can so North Korea can't cause damage in South Korea &amp; US.
.@RepTomRice: Economic growth is my number one goal in Congress, and I know it's President Trump's number one goal too.
.@RepTomRice: We're very largely in agreement with the President's tax reform proposal.
.@RepTomRice on securing long term government funding: We'll get the best deal we can and move on down the road.

.@LaraMBrownPhD: There's this assumption among the opposition party that obstruction among 1st 100 days means obstructing whole presidency.
.@LaraMBrownPhD: I think these great campaign promises put too much pressure on the accomplishments. It puts in too much activity.
.@blaineharden: The Kim Regime chooses the United States as its big bad enemy.
.@blaineharden on North Korea rhetoric: Similar to what they've been saying past six decades.
.@SteveBellDC: I think Trump cares more about the wall than the government shutdown.
.@MarkLevineTalk: What about Mexico paying for the wall? What happened to that Trump promise?
.@LarryOConnor: Let's be clear - the government doesn't shut down. Employees still get paid; not always a bad thing.
.@PeterWSJ on border funding: Budget negotiations stakes are high.
.@PeterWSJ: Trump wants to put points on the board, but it's not clear he can deliver.
.@PeterWSJ on tax reform: The President might be lighting a fire under his staff to show he's making progress.

Cheng: There are a lot of reports of activity at North Korea's sites so [a missile test] is possible.
Dean Cheng on North Korea tensions: There's an array of financial sanctions that can be imposed.
.@JAscholtes: It seems like both parties can't strike a deal [on budget].
.@JAscholtes on gov't shutdown: The White House is under immense pressure...This time seems scarier than ever if you're afraid of shutdown.

.@MayaMacGuineas: A big part of [tax reform] is the business community - there will be some winners and some losers.
.@MayaMacGuineas: Politically, [Republicans] had to get tax reform done before healthcare.
.@MayaMacGuineas on potential government shutdown: My guess is the Republicans will pass a budget with similar spending from this year.
.@AlexConant: Simply playing a round of golf w/ Rand Paul isn't going to fix Trump's problems overnight. April, he can get some things done

.@rachaelmbade on #Gorsuch filibuster: The Founders created the Senate for bipartisanship.

.@RepPeteKing: Adam Schiff may have seen something that I haven't seen.

.@SteveBellDC on Impending Government Shutdown: This schedule has now really becomes jammed.

.@KenPaxtonTX: I don't see any reason why police officers couldn't be trained to help ICE with immigration.
