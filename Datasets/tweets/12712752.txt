So if your a blogger this is a huge story. Its just beginning. The guys at the lab are talking open source for their products.Its wild
Its a total mess. A lot of the networks were a sol source of income for many. I admit I spend some cash myself. NOt as much as some.
There is no talk of negotiations. Now ning is trying to put the system back together as networks are not working properly.
Now very angry customers who have lost money, no refunds, and very angry advertizers who suddenly lost ad space.
Apparently Widget labs didn't comply had several warnings. Friday without warning all network creators on ning got an email.
NIng under estimated how many networks were using these third party widgets.They weren't free either. Lawyers are now involved
All of us network creators needed some features ning didn't have. For advertizing and content building. Widget Labs fullfilled a need
wow NIng and widget laboratory. If your a blogger this is going to be a huge story. Yesterday our networks were gutted
I just found a really cool site to make your own flashcards. Its called flashcard exchange link http://www.flashcardexchange.com.
anyone know what happened to pladeo? It was a great chat program for blogs and websites.
I was doing those things from the time I was eight. The problem was I never got to enjoy being a kid. Now I am finally learning to have fun
I was always told I had to be doing things all the time. Whether it was washing dishes ,laundry,yard work, or taking care of grandma
My family had tremendous anxiety. It didn't help that I had challenges to overcome. When my husband met me he had to help me just sit down
We have been training our puppy. By doing the dog whisperer approach. Now the dog doesn't jump at my son. I am getting more relaxed too.
@mamatude Yep I have always felt that way too. Its cool the way they dance with the ribbons.
my son and I played tickle, cars, he threw the ball back and forth to me, and he asked for a bear. He mischievously took a piece of gum.
had a good day with my son. My dad tried to cheer me up. The last part of it was how I needed to use a therapy that works. Nice slip dad
WIthout a warning ning removed them. We are wondering if thats going to happen to us.
So many networks are suffering due to their removal. WIthout a warning just a huge email to remove them. The guys at the lab donated to us.
Unfortunately ning doesn't provide instant messaging or chats, or emoticons and many other things.WL made those products
WL products are great. The problem stated by ning was that their were removed due to terms of service.
ning recieving backlash of the dismsal of widgetlaboratory.com. I use their products. So do a ton of network creators
I have been watching the dog whisperer. Its helping with our puppy. Took him for a short walk. Going to go play with my son.
@m_eyre thats awsome! Way to go for her.
The toughest part about Site build it, is all the analysis you have to do.Its worth it and a huge learning curve
took the puppy for a long walk. About to play with my son for the day.Try to come up with some more game ideas for coolest-kids-games site.
@autismfamily thank you! It was a huge moment and I am learning to really enjoy him. He won't be little forever.
He is doing much more.If I don't teach him how to dream big no one will.
Things like just focusing on him sitting down. I have down more than that with him. He did his first potty on the potty. He played with me.
I have always known that about myself. Talking to me about kids that are born with half a brain and comparing that to my son
That has never worked for me. I can get down, be depressed at times. I need to have less toxicity and a bigger vision. Or I will perish.
I guess she wants me to dream small. I can't do that. Its like living the rudy movie. Your a Rudiger your suppose to be a nobody.
talked with my mom. Its really hard to know she is in pain. She is trying to help I know but telling me stuff I already know about Liam
Sorry here is the url for it http://www.wrongplanet.net/article374.html
Url for Temple Grandin Movie on HBO http://www.wrongplanet.net/article374.html
Claire Danes in negotiation for Temple Grandin  part. Movie on HBO. After nine years the project is under way.
He also did better with our puppy. Our puppy is doing much better around our son. I really pleased to see them interacting well together.
My son won his first game with me of chutes and ladders. We had a great session today just playing. He took direction.
So today do some drawing, walk the puppy, play with son. Pray for the strength and wisdom I need everyday to help my son.
I need to get better rest and learn how to relax. I never learned how to relax growing up.My mom always felt you needed to be doing things
I ate a burrito thats a lot of calories. So I need to walk the dog for an hour. Dog whisperer gave good tips on that.
I want to find out how. I can draw a few things. Once I draw the image do I scan it?Or take a picture and save it as a jpg?
I am trying to find a way to make coloring pages.I know you can take popular pics of spongebob and turn into a coloring page legally.
We finally found the shoe our puppy royal buried in the backyard. Our dog had also put his bone inside the shoe.
I woke up to my son eating my favorite ink pen. I found one part of the pen and now I am trying to find the other part before royal does
Aww sunday. Back to writing pages and coming up with some more games. Never knew my husband was such a great writer.
Michael Phelps has adhd. He was diagnosed at age nine. His mom talked about his struggles. Swimming was a natural fit for him and his body
I love Michael Phelps. He is awsome. My dog is behaving and my son just wants to play with his dad. Dad doesn't want to play. He is tired.:(
The day that was taken was on Father's day. There is no greater gift for my husband than that day.Thats a gift he will long remember.
That was all that mattered to us. My husband was overjoyed because he was able to share this moment with his son.
I know the fish is little but it means a lot to our family. Liam laughed and touched the fish. It was smiley so he made a face. He loved it
He took our son fishing. We brought his spongebob pole and sure enough he caught a fish. He held his own pole and my husband helped him.
He came home and wept because he thought he could never take our son fishing. I told him to do it anyway because you never know.
My husband wanted to take my son fishing. He had heard about his friend who took his son. His friend has a son about our son's age.
I wanted this as my picture. It reminds me of a dream fullfilled for my husband.Everyday we see it it gives us joy.
With the new puppy our son has taken an active interest in training him and playing with the dog and us.
Its really great to see my son telling his puppy what to do. I remember with our other dog it was if the dog didn't exist.
Need to write the pages for the other site.I am so tired.Sessions with Liam went well.He named his frog ben. Never did that before.
It will take some time but I am going to draw some coloring pages. Still have to figure out how to add the images.I have to draw them first
ok I was able to use flickr on ning. Totally legal. I also added paper dolls to floortime repository too.
We are still making up some games for our new site. So if you only see a main page don't worry we are writing more.

Gingerken looking for sponsors for my friends event http://tinyurl.com/6yt95x
@Gingerken my husband may go to autismspot dad's coffee support group.
@autismfamily agreed. Or a visual for potty fears. He is terrified of the Toilet. Me I am just worried about him period.
I am wondering if there should be a wikipedia just for autism bloggers. Maybe a website with just autism bloggers.
@autismfamily you should charge them.They came to you because they see you as an expert. Charge what your time is worth. Its worth a lot!
I have to think differently, maybe my circumstances can make me stronger wiser and more creative.
@WarrenWhitlock in my case I can't be the man my dog wants me to be. I wasn't born with that equipment.
A guy tried to return his motherboard.It didn't work. Apparently it didn't fit his computer.So he took tinsnips to cut it to fit!
I hate it when you ask for driving directions,and the folks you ask don't know. Especially when they have lived in that area all their life.
@autismfamily LOL I love your wit!My husband worked at computer company. You can't believe the questions he would get.Its unreal
@autismfamily I need to check that article out on feelings. My son was tramatized last year, he saw our dog die. He wories when we sleep
