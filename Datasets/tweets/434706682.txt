@iArianaGrande4u I've been trying but it's hard to read between the lines
@JeneteMcCurdy4u I see you're doing a good job on making them shoots come alive I'm just trying to talk director talk I don't know if that sounds like
@snowmarite Thanks you deserve the love you give also
@Shakiraforall Hell yeah I hear that
@imarianagraande I like how this was typed. Out
@JeneteMcCurdy4u That could very well be
@galAvrilLavigne Are you asking someone special to you this question
@iArianaGrande4u @galAvrilLavigne Sweet I bet you got a lot of people confused on this tweet
@iSelenaGornez Thats a good one
@Shakiraforall @iSelenaGornez Yeah Dem replace feelings is nothing to be dealing with
@Shakiraforall @iSelenaGornez Or like you have a memory and someone's talking to you and you're just zoning out and they're like did you hear me and you're like what
@iSelenaGornez I'm not sure if your talking to me or am I just picking up your tweets and there for someone else
@itaylorswift4u @iSelenaGornez But the thing is you should never force yourself into thinking about old memories because the Force as with tears you up inside
@itaylorswift4u @iSelenaGornez Yeah them are all good qualities to have in a person to be your better half
@itaylorswift4u @iSelenaGornez Yeah I feel you
@iSelenaGornez If this is a conversation it's a very confusing conversation because sometimes these conversations make me feel like I'm talking to myself
@iSelenaGornez If this is for me the reason why that is is because I don't know if we're having conversations or not if this is what u call a conversation
@iSelenaGornez So that's what I hear sometimes that if you still talk about a certain person you still care about them
@itaylorswift4u @iSelenaGornez But these here girls are going for Grandad's
@itaylorswift4u @iSelenaGornez This as well has been circling Twitter for quite some time now too I think I've been seeing this one for about 5 months now on Twitter
@MerendaCosgrove @iSelenaGornez I always do because I know I don't have it all so I'm happy with what I have always will be
@MerendaCosgrove @iSelenaGornez This is true I am always thankful for what I have because I don't have much to begin with so everything I got I'm thankful for
@MerendaCosgrove @iSelenaGornez I don't see how a mistake would be a motivation or unless you're saying a mistake should be a motivation as in don't do it no more or
@iSelenaGornez Yes I like that feeling that can make your life go great
@bellathorne4u @iSelenaGornez Love can work in mysterious ways
@bellathorne4u @iSelenaGornez Just once thats all I would think u would want that for the rest of your life
@bellathorne4u @iSelenaGornez Oh Mylanta you are so right on this one
@MerendaCosgrove @iSelenaGornez This has been making its way around twitter for months now as well lol😆
@bellathorne4u @iSelenaGornez I've been seeing this tweet go around Twitter for about 3 months now
@gratefuIariana Well good night and good luck on your exams in the morning
@galAvrilLavigne OK sounds good
@MerendaCosgrove I always do
@galKylieJenner @iSelenaGornez Yeah this is true sometimes you just have to go because sometimes life is too short people's not around forever
@galKylieJenner @iSelenaGornez Yeah patience is a a virtue
@iSelenaGornez I know that feeling of that I hate being ignored don't you
@galKylieJenner @iSelenaGornez Even if you told me all your mistakes and weaknesses I would still think you're amazing
@itaylorswift4u Yeah then when you try to fall asleep it shows up in your dreams
@iArianaGrande4u I meant to say that tweet that you just tweeted there
@iArianaGrande4u It sounds like you're watching a movie something similar to this tweet you just treated here
@JeneteMcCurdy4u That is a very sad feeling I must agree I've been through that also
@iAustinMahone4u @itaylorswift4u I felt empty earlier so I went and ate a bowl of spaghetti so now I feel like I'm on full LOL nah I'm just kidding but I did have spaghetti
@KellyClarkson4u @MerendaCosgrove This is true
@JeneteMcCurdy4u Sweet thanks lol no let me stop I know you talking about someone else
@MerendaCosgrove OK sure thing I won't
@JeneteMcCurdy4u Yes this is true
@JeneteMcCurdy4u If I want to cuddle with someone right now where is the question in this like should I be sharing this if I want to cuddle or should I be ?
@arianaagrande4u Cool that guy should be there to comfort you
@JeneteMcCurdy4u I like this I will still this as a re tweet if you dont mind OK
@iSelenaGornez Well that guy must be doing something right and wrong in a way if your sad and smiling about this guy you know or girl I mean yeah he or she
@JeneteMcCurdy4u Dang thats crazy to hear dont this guy see how much you care for him or is he blind
@iSelenaGornez Yeah this is true
@JeneteMcCurdy4u If he or she means that much to u how come u never tell that person instead of wishing how they knew now I am just asking thats it thats alk
@iSelenaGornez Now I like that in you you keep giving people motivation to keep pushing further and further I meant to put now and not not
@iSelenaGornez Not like that in you you give everybody motivation to keep going further and further
@iSelenaGornez But look at me all up in your business lol its all good tho
@iSelenaGornez In your tweet you said you just lost the only one that would love you that sounds like walking away to me tho lol maybe I could be wrong tho
@iSelenaGornez But I thought you just said you walked away tho
@iSelenaGornez I am sorry to hear that
@JeneteMcCurdy4u I always thought a girl's I don't know was a f*** you but I just read that on the Tweet though so don't mind me
@iSelenaGornez OK but well so I mean oh never mind you never answer me back anyway
@iAustinMahone4u @iSelenaGornez True
@iAustinMahone4u @iSelenaGornez Yeah but that works both ways as well to
@iAustinMahone4u @iSelenaGornez That happens a lot in life
@KellyClarkson4u @iSelenaGornez OK sounds good

@itaylorswift4u @imarianagraande Well I hope that is not going to happen
@arianaagrande4u Me to I am going back to sleep
@arianaagrande4u This is true
@iSelenaGornez No no one popped into my head I am lost on this one
@iArianaGrande4u I think that same way
@iArianaGrande4u @itaylorswift4u Cool sounds like a plan
@KellyClarkson4u @iSelenaGornez I been saying goodbye a lot to but then I just can't do the goodbye thing lol
@iArianaGrande4u Thank you
@iSelenaGornez Yeah but who says that the crush is not working both ways say like me I have a crush but I am waiting on someone to say they crushing on me
