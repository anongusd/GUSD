@SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA I love atheists.  So many Christians perform mental acrobatics to try to make sense of the Bible ... at least atheists are intellectually honest about it.		*Spoiler alert* 	The density of my body is greater than the density of water. That ‚Äúwalk on water‚Äù bit is blatantly bullshit
@SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA Oh I‚Äôm just now getting into the Twitter game.  I‚Äôm sure Twitter followers will come.  I mean, it took me like 2000 years to gain a few billion real life followers.

@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang All the same reasons you need a phone
@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang Nope.  Just eating Sushi! I don‚Äôt always check my phone.		I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve spent so much energy thinking about me.  It seems you‚Äôve started to turn your life toward me!  This is good.  		Maybe just work on being less needlessly hostile.  #DBAD (the golden rule)

@javierberain Oh tell me about it

@vanbadham Yeah?
@Specter_Smit Right?
@Ant_Writer @JohnTheObscure Whew! Thanks bruh
@JAllenMc üòÅüëç
@ChurchArmy I‚Äôm immediately skeptical of the implication of a militarized ‚ÄúChurch‚Äù ‚Äî a model frequently practiced in countries where people kill a lot of other people over mere ideology
@KateQFunny @jimjefferies @Whataburger Yo üôÉ
@Thesupercole Right here actually

@DonCheadle I‚Äôm literally watching Infinity War right now.  Yes, Jesus has a Netflix subscription: https://t.co/Q4hZRn526O
@maxlugavere @Mark_Sisson Yeah?
Oh, my dad!!!! https://t.co/S3o3weVdPW
Wake up, my child https://t.co/qNL2RlzueH
Frankly, my dad hasn‚Äôt been around much.  I would prefer if you focus more on love for one another https://t.co/OFJubE2OAw
The 21st! How could I live in any other century? https://t.co/aQdkb9ghz6
I will do no such thing, and I would appreciate if you kindly refrain from speaking on my behalf.  I have my own iPhone, sir. https://t.co/Rj9yABoJkV
Funny enough, she‚Äôs closer to correct than her grandmother. https://t.co/wdQbIjqCwc
@thehill Get your shit together Ayatolla.  Words matter
@thehill Holy dad
@CNN Blessed are the peacemakers who have the self restraint not to break this man‚Äôs neck and leave him in the streets
@WeAreFoursquare @calebbr0wn Take what Ashley and Caleb say with a grain of salt.  I stopped doing miracles a few thousand years ago.  They draw too much negative attention and don‚Äôt work nearly as well as one would think.
@StephenBaldwin7 Bro I just woke up.
@Sebatsane Not true.  I really don‚Äôt have that power
@DeplorableTere1 I don‚Äôt really command troops ... that King James Bible is like a translation of a translation of a translation.  You ever played telephone as a kid?
@huannalu Np üòä
@IngridDargin @2_fleurdelis @ashleighpeak @sacwriter Well I also wept when the patriots won.  I wouldn‚Äôt read too far into it
@CNN I think the danger here no longer requires a prophet to notice

@Slade I‚Äôm right here!  Why does everyone think I‚Äôm hiding?
@Mason_Foster https://t.co/uLob0BKhv2
@DonCheadle Prayers received, but this one is on him.
@madeintyo Meh.  I prefer actions over words
@iD4RO @marquisdecod Yo
@mhayoun @YouTube Lit
@MrPope @martiallawre @Rainbow6Game Right?
@moshekasher A bunch.  It‚Äôs kinda messed up
@BillyGraham No, sorry, I‚Äôm not in heaven.  Terrible WiFi up there
@brockwilbur @AutomaticZen Hmm?
@MattHoyOfficial OH, MY DAD! ... Its okay, just don‚Äôt overdo it.  :)
@McJuggerNuggets Why does everyone want me to drive their car?
@Jim_Brunner Yes?
@vikkie @danielatlarge Yes?
@Paula_White Hey leave me out of this.  Whatever it is
@BBPHredux @roybragg @Maria4America @NeilMaginnis @blaw @HillaryClinton I would ... if I was my dad.  You realize Allah is my dad right? God. He‚Äôs the same guy.		And to address your question, I needed to reword it.  I used the word scumbag, which I realized sounded repetitive.  So I changed it to ‚Äúidiot‚Äù
@notreallyjcm @Alia_Stearns_ I don‚Äôt know what that word means, but whatever the definition, I will not kill you, my child
@EvanHandler I agree with the sentiment here, but I just licked my arm and can confirm that I am not sweet
@81TimBrown Oh yeah? Try drinking a gallon of milk in under an ten minutes and tell me if you still think all things are possible ... with or without my dad
@BrianZahnd @BryanMcWhite Honestly, you should trust anything based on a generalization like that. Trust things because you have evidence that they‚Äôre trustworthy
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot To be clear: I am NOT in, nor am I remotely interested in being in any kind of relationship with any of the Trump family.  I tend to surround myself with decent people
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot Ahh I remember that.  That meme was from my SOTU response
@roybragg @BBPHredux @Maria4America @NeilMaginnis @blaw @HillaryClinton Whoa whoa whoa ... don‚Äôt lump me in with that idiot.
@TrulyMonica I‚Äôm not in the business of giving rice or jobs actually.  I did the whole ‚Äúfish to bread‚Äù thing, but that was just to make a point.  The big thing to remember is that there will always be suffering while people continue to suck ...
@ServicioTelcel @jesusrosalesPS Me puedes DM si eso es que quieres hacer.
@JerryFalwellJr @georgembenson @brettrlars I don‚Äôt recall writing anything in red pen.  Also, judging by the way you e lived your life, you haven‚Äôt really retained much of what I ever said, regardless of the color of the words.
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot It‚Äôs clear by her last name that Taste and Class were never a major priority
@TimDuffy Wait.  There‚Äôs a Me Lizard?
@JarridWilson Well sure, but please remember to mind common sense boundaries
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot Not hate.  More of a firm Facepalm really.
@ServicioTelcel @jesusrosalesPS Hola @ServicioTelcel, no necesito que ... oh ... el otro Jesus. Lo siento
@JaneyGodley @IMXLR8N @AOC Yes, I do. But the golden rule (#DBAD) tends to go out the window frequently when you put a coward behind the anonymity of a keyboard
@JeffreeStar @elfcosmetics The dry heat of Mesopotamia made it so that no amount of makeup can make this face look young again
@thehill My dad created mankind such that they will speak many different languages ... Perhaps in another language ‚Äúgreat‚Äù means Shameful, and ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù means Prison
@lisamurkowski @CaptainAmerica @ChrisEvans Jesus approves
@KatrinaPierson Thank you @KatrinaPierson for embodying the perfect example of what a human should not be.  We need crude humans like yourself so we  have something to strive not to be. https://t.co/u1TqLLIrz2
@diarvr Indeed I am flattered.   But it should be about YOU!
@nels668 I can confirm
@ida712 A+ for enthusiasm!
@TheAlchemiist_ üíØ
@thehill Thou shalt always seem like a cheerleader
@CNN I predict a lot of false witness bearing
@stariotype @ArianaGrande I can confirm that such a depiction is inaccurate
@KhaiAchak I hope not.  This is writing.  There‚Äôs really nothing to hear
@TheJesusSayings ‚ÄúNot suicide‚Äù is also a pretty good answer
@God_Loved It‚Äôs actually pretty easy most of the time.
@mel_melay I‚Äôm wha?
@HarrietKavere Haha victory? Well there was this one time...	‚úã‚úãüî®üî®üòµ‚ò†Ô∏èüëªüßñ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòá
@KhaiAchak Just to be clear.  The happenchance designs you can make by playing dot-to-dot with the stars from our position in the Galaxy has zero influence on human personalities

@RealTalkKim https://t.co/J3AYQkI4Fl
@bambamdaily Oh that‚Äôs not my mom, but neat pic!
@zeyadyeah1997 @jk_rowling Why? That‚Äôs the idea behind fantasy.  It takes your mind to a made up world.  I already have thousands of books about me.
@AKIslander @MadCornishBiker Am I not responding to you in near live time? It‚Äôs okay @MadCornishBiker, I love you despite your atheism
Remember the golden rule:	Don‚Äôt be a douche #DBAD
@GLYCERlNEQUEEN You know what they say:  Thou shalt never go broke gassing up
@MadCornishBiker @JelicalIvan You are misguided my child
@JelicalIvan @MadCornishBiker Nah, I keep my DM‚Äôs open for prayers tho
@MadCornishBiker @JelicalIvan I try not to hate anyone.  I have to try extra hard with Donald trump.  But as a general rule, what you just claimed is incorrect
Be honest with yourself.  You don‚Äôt know that for sure.  Belief requires faith. https://t.co/SO5W9UFPdy
@JelicalIvan @MadCornishBiker Prayers.  Common misconception there ... I can‚Äôt hear those.
@MadCornishBiker @JelicalIvan No he‚Äôs for real.  I entered him a while back.  I just try to avoid eye contact so it isn‚Äôt weird
@217_0398 @YouTube One of my favorite YouTube channels.  Best of luck, other me!
@TiernanDouieb @johnbeck_ Yeah?
@debostic Amen, friend
@cosmickissy https://t.co/NdGn607cOL
@KirkDeveyck Yeah but I don‚Äôt get hung up on titles.
@aimusa That‚Äôs objectively untrue
@rcsprouljr Jesus thinks you don‚Äôt understand what secularism is, and that you‚Äôve confused it with atheism.  In any case, quit being so judgy. #DBAC
@GenuinelyEmilie Hold up a sec.  I‚Äôm not exactly a home security system, if that‚Äôs what you mean
@wooby_yt You‚Äôll do great!
@ChirayilJoseph Where?
We got beef? https://t.co/OH2YPstuQ1
@lynne_windy I wish I could.  Best of luck to you my friend!
@StephNGColace_ Sweet indeed
@zeyadyeah1997 @jk_rowling I don‚Äôt need a shoutout in her books.  They were fantastic just the way they were written
@RellonRosalia I don‚Äôt need warriors. I‚Äôm not a general.  My only desire is #DBAC
@KassyDillon Sorry but that wasn‚Äôt me
@iamdannettalynn Woot! Thanks for the follow!
@iheartscripture Nah not really.  That‚Äôs not what he does at all
@WhoLisaFrm503 I‚Äôve never been to prison.  I think he‚Äôs just easily excited!
@anotolefrank Idk man.  It‚Äôs not looking good
@simplyih https://t.co/7lMLVpUbZD
@jaay_eeym I‚Äôm sorry, but I have no control over that.  So work fast, friend!
@The_Jester66 Right?!
@KaylaPenner1 Hardly perfect
@kusump_ Oh dem tittays! I always look good in red
@mariah_ely I‚Äôm no king.  Let‚Äôs be friends instead
@simplyih Aww thank you! You‚Äôre amazing too!
@LydiaBeck18 I love atheists too.  You should try it.  You have to admit:  Dad didn‚Äôt leave much to hang your faith on.
@Queen_amerella @exotic_vibes_ My dad didn‚Äôt let you.  You let you!  Happy birthday :)
@Christwarriors5 You don‚Äôt need a church to be a good person.
@HarleyJuneDavi1 Honestly, probably not.
@GLYCERlNEQUEEN Sweet, right?!
@dionhannahross I beg unto thee, never forget the necessity of the comma
@CLAOutcomes @greglaurie No, I really don‚Äôt.  My dad hasn‚Äôt really been in the picture for a while.  That was my whole point ... it‚Äôs on you to be a better person:  You can do eet!	#DBAC
@demetricka @Paula_White You‚Äôre welcome :)
@RobChalmers7 Good job!
@_Rannnnnn Nonfollowers too.
@livechristian1 My core message is simple: #DBAC
@lozzy1080p60fps Wtf, weeb? What did I do?
@StephKVE Yes?
@fuckualc @tylerrjoseph Jesus needs to check these dudes out
@kjgranny2050 Um no.  Your ‚Äúself‚Äù is pretty important.  Just be your best self
@DrTumisang Most of you*		Fixed it for you
@JourneyOfPureBl I love you too man
@PokeTrainerCard @maxcension Rofl https://t.co/ADmXyDyie9
@ShapedByTruth Meh.  Doesn‚Äôt really work that way.
@brighttseokj https://t.co/TnfpmIEXbN
@The_Gospels Not exactly.  I died because people, as a general rule, suck
@holybibletoday I‚Äôm not exactly everyone‚Äôs personal Walmart associate, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre implying.
@MyPowertalk Jesus agrees
@seanhannity Sean, thank you for being a shining example to humanity of everything I never wanted humans to become
@thehill Jesus declares this act to be a genuinely dick move
@NBCNews Sorry, my dad is kind of a prick
@CBSNews Jesus approves of Julian Edelman.
@ABCWorldNews @TerryMoran What percentage of that percentage is  spent wanking? Asking for a friend ...
@CBCNews Possibility is much less of a concern than probability
@RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Thou shalt not have a name which so resembles Led Zeppelin
@citykittymo1 @WCVB Dad is a Patriots fan.  Not much of a Patriots-fan-fan though, regrettably.
@FleeceWings @Samgabbi1 He doesn‚Äôt do that.  Trust me, your happiness is all on you
@deemick7 @KayaJones @elzieim29 My dad is the most annoying Patriots fan in the world. I know that much is obvious, but you should try going to one of his fucking super bowl parties üôÑ
@Elaineocgp @DanCrenshawTX Unfortunately, your prayers in my name will not help this situation. 		More donating and/or spreading this link ... less talking into thin air to make yourself feel like you‚Äôve helped.
@e_sakamoto25 Don‚Äôt worry about your thoughts wandering.  Nobody is listening.  Not even me.  What matters is the self reflection, wherever that may lead
@its_not_jason Thou shalt not punish fun
@LaurenArredondo He really doesn‚Äôt listen.  But for what it‚Äôs worth, I wish you the best.
@saladinahmed Dare thy criticize literacy by wielding a lengthy run-on sentence as a weapon?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Before judging the bullshit of others, you must first remove the bullshit from your own eye
@usnews Just because apparently my biographies weren‚Äôt clear enough: Keep thy hands off little kids, you fucks.
@thehill Judge not, lest thy own immature, decades old decisions be judged as well
@ABC Trust me Donnie, you‚Äôre not the god you think you are.  Even my dad is a pretty shitty god.  You‚Äôre just embarrassing
@CNN Jesus approves.
@CBSNews Idk what you guys did to impress my dad, but I‚Äôd appreciate if you‚Äôd let me know
@thehill Sorry, my dad is kind of a prick
@norvina1 Always love thy fellow fry eaters, regardless of their chosen method of fry consumption.  Fry minimalism is an honorable choice
@realDonaldTrump My dear Donald, you‚Äôre forgetting the Golden Rule.  Revised for 2019, it goes like this:	Quit being such a cunt ...
@JoeNBC I think @realDonaldTrump thinks he‚Äôs my dad.
The #StateOfTheUnion is an interesting ritual.  Union.  I tried to unite people, and we all know how that shit-show ended. ü§ï	@realDonaldTrump will try to divide people in the name of ‚Äúunion‚Äù and walk away hand-nail free ... Humans don‚Äôt seem to want unity.
@bryanbehar I can vouch. My dad is a huge Brady fan. Imagine watching the game with a guy who can actually yell at the TV and affect the game ... Super Bowl parties with him are bullshit
@marcorubio Don‚Äôt trust him bro.  I‚Äôm telling you.  ‚úãüî®
