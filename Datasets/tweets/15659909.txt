@biggsag @MUDDLAW Andrew how about a focus on massive govt worker absentism? That appears to be a general problem across all +100 agencies and defines poor administration. Fighting over a $80,000 transfer in the police budget is micromanaging and means OB picks irrelevent fights.

Central govt gives subsidies to municipalities so they could be reduced in the amount of paygo that each entity is not paying. You have to stop the freeriding.
@biggsag @JBalmaceda787 That is positive Andrew but it's not enough to transfer actives out and never fix the legacy retirees. Especially if OB allows municipalities and pub corp to welch on pay-go. ERS is not a stranded asset that GO bondholders have to true up for the next 30 years.

@gene_krauss @MUDDLAW Let us when you receive your notice please.
@MUDDLAW Oboard is adrift and Judge Gonzalez and professor Skeel enjoy litigating way too much.
@MUDDLAW I've calculated it will take about 7 months for this invalidation motion to get to litigation. Hopefully this OBoard gone by then.
@MUDDLAW Court allowed a 60 day window for notices of participation to be filed. This is just the beginning.
@gene_krauss Deleting my incorrect reply to you and going to see some art.  : ))
@gene_krauss I think that's been happening since they rushed the exhange on Feb 12. They weighed the damage from a exchange disaster against achieving equitable mootness. Easy to guess who drove the train too.

@JayCaruso How great would it have been to know Washington. Both as a young man and in his prime.
@DaniaPeriodista They blame Congress.
And this is where @MoodysUSPubFin has Puerto Rico's Cofina rating as Feb 8, 2019 vs 50 states. Some are suggesting Moody's will raise PR's rating when the new bonds are issued on Tuesday. Personally I dont think new Cofina should be any higher than 3.5/B1. #muniland https://t.co/YxuLiOiNNP

@AndrewScurria @WSJ Court's stamp is worth zero.
Smart reporting until it gets to the end and omits that former governor says new bonds should be defaulted on.

@TayTayLLP Citi seems to be out with some really special nonsense. They're bound to buffalo a few less sharp managers.
My view is that OBoard is playing a short game which only involves killing bondholders. OBoard could have followed Promesa &amp; updated audited financials &amp; worked "consensually" w/ creditors. Instead they choose to litigate (note Cofina deal had almost no OB involvement) #muniland https://t.co/MGsTJHpQG9
@daskeel ~~~~ https://t.co/v0eBvM9Dzu
Remember that Puerto Rico OBoard hid tax cuts from the Title lll court while asserting there was a fiscal crisis during the Cofina plan confirmation hearing. Bondholders have little defense against these gross misrepresentations. #muniland
@bondgeekette Muniland Hunger Games 2019. This is about as silly as GO/PBA invalidation motion.
OBoard members @daskeel &amp; Judge Gonzalez think there is no boundary in law that cannot be broken in effort to cramdown bondholders. Buying Puerto Rico paper means you will have to fight this kind of thing for the next 20 years. There are much safer ways to pickup yield #muniland
Note to fund managers considering buying new Cofina exchange bonds --- although those bonds will allegedly have protection of statutory lien that means nothing as shown by OBoard arguments in Prepa adversary case &amp; statements by former governor AGP re defaulting again #muniland
In urgent motion Puerto Rico OBoard asserts that Prepa bondholders are not entitled to any "adequate protection" bc Prepa has always had higher expenses than revenues. This arg will go down as one of the most audacious (&amp; silly) in bk litigation https://t.co/EN9VM32sTC #muniland https://t.co/CyNEDNYN5z

@katiecannon2 @saikatc @drvox @SenMarkey @AOC I do research for bondholders -- so yes, I'm in favoring of paying interest. But note I'm entirely against entities (families, towns, companies, US govt) issuing debt where the proceeds are not used effectively. Lots of proceeds from debt issuance are frittered away.
@katiecannon2 @saikatc @drvox @SenMarkey @AOC Important to note that over half of debt issued in emerging markets is US dollar denominated. So the Fed ends up managing the value of the USD for the whole world. The global monetary and debt system is deeply interwoven. I dont like it but that's the way it is.
@katiecannon2 @saikatc @drvox @SenMarkey @AOC Thanks for the chat but asserting something is true without evidence is not a winning argument. Have a great day.

@katiecannon2 @saikatc @drvox @SenMarkey @AOC Reserves are how the money supply is controlled. See the Fed's overnight lending rate which is the interest rate that everyone freaks over when it is adjusted. And the bond market would view "federal securities" as equivalent to US Treasuries.

@AssetElliott @gene_krauss Let me restate ~~ neither Detroit or Puerto Rico recoveries should be used to make inferences re future recoveries on any type of muni debt.

@miguelconway @MaryAnastasiaOG Bingo Miguel.
Important for everyone in #muniland to note that law governing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy (Promesa) does NOT have an insolvency requirement to file for restructuring like Chap9 does.

@gene_krauss No, because Promesa does not have an insolvency requirement like Chapter 9 does. You can thank Antonio Weiss and is crowd for that (including Jim Millstein).
@gene_krauss The article is another Bloomberg hack piece. 98% of muni issuers have low debt burdens and are committed to repaying come hell or high water. Puerto Rico is an extreme outlier and C9 was not migrated over in whole.

@daskeel Thought you were litigating GOs/PBA.
@Sauronpr It's a cut and paste from Kirpalani's drafts. There is almost no reasoning in her order.
@Terpin8or @McKinsey Actually it's fine because anyone new to PR's finances will have to go through a steep learning curve.
.@MSRB_News says will *not* require dealers to post bids on multiple ATS (trading platforms). Kills possibility of national best bid &amp; offer tape.

@MUDDLAW @amontara11 Trust me on this one.
@Brad_Setser Revenues are up to highest level since I started following PR in 2012.
@MUDDLAW @amontara11 Section 1125 adequate disclosure is a clear error. Hein raised it at the hearing. And because T3 court says on/off island bonds are equal doesnt make it so.
@Brad_Setser Well Brad you've been consistently wrong on Puerto Rico since we debated at CFR. Never change dude.
@amontara11 Mutliple grounds for appeal if anyone so chooses.
@amontara11 It's an error on par with her pension bond ruling.
@Brad_Setser GOs are pari with Cofina seniors.

There are two splits that court has to bless 1) UCC &amp; Whyte split from procedure she approved 2) portioning of 53% where seniors got recocery par+ when you include compensation cash &amp; mainland juniors got much less valuable bonds. She allowed vote on unequal treatment.

@_the_long_b0nd Ok stay away and let the SUT accumulate a few more years at BONY.
@MUDDLAW @legumeno I don't see a difference there but ok. As I've said for weeks she's likely to reject it and explain why. Her objections will likely vary from my objections. Creditors will need to negotiate a new deal for the various classes based on the split that UCC and Whyte agreed to.
@legumeno @MUDDLAW Let's allow the court to reach a judgement. Because Promesa is new law she has struggled to balance the various requirements embodied in the statute.

@AppDemography "Scratches head"...
@AppDemography Oh brother ~~ definitely write up your findings for local media. There was one day when the governor's good morning tweet showed that it was promoted content. Weird.
@MUDDLAW If the objections raised by mainland bondholders end up causing the T3 court to reject the Cofina plan of adjustment it would be cheaper in the long run to designate a separate committee. Small bondholders prob hold 40-50% of par outstanding. They cant be unrepresented.
@AppDemography Wow. You should write a column for one of the local media outlets and expose the govt. When I first wrote that PR would become insolvent in 2012 Fortuno's critics attacked me and said I was part of "Occupy Wall Street" haha! See last paragraph &gt; &gt; https://t.co/KB5gUMhe41
@MUDDLAW That was the Ad Hoc GOs (hedge funds essentially). Small GO bondholders (retail) have a much more compelling arg after getting shafted in Cofina proposal.

@DanielHGill @proskauer Will do.
@JBalmaceda787 @retiropr Good day for the validity of secured liens.
@DanielHGill @proskauer The Title lll court told the Special Claims Committee, UCC and the respondents to work out a process to proceed with the invalidation motion. I'm sure that this will be red meat to creditors involved. I'll let them do it.
@LlorensEva @cbenespanol @CaribBusiness this kind of stuff is why @RaulGrijalba_ wants to reduce OBoard power. It's an affront to PR citizens (&amp; creditors) that they spend any time on this while real issues like massive govt absenteeism &amp; lack of financials go unaddressed. Fighting over dead bodies is a dead end.

@MUDDLAW Hedge funds would lend at 10%. It becomes increasingly clear that Puerto Rico has no desire to pay creditors as we go into fourth year of defaults. Govt is happy to spend on soul friends and publicity and give tax cuts. Who in their right mind would lend to a govt who does that?
@MUDDLAW Yes, she could and Puerto Rico would never gave traditional market access again.
@MUDDLAW Don't think she would. Remember +$300 billion of muni securities have the same structure. She'd be upending about a tenth of the muni market and would need some strong federal law to do it.

@Radioactive599 @navybook @LosAlamosNatLab @DefenseOne Sorry -- nobody casually cleans up uranium in the middle of a war.
@navybook @Radioactive599 @LosAlamosNatLab @DefenseOne Is there some metal or carbon fiber composite that could withstand the enemy dropping a really big bomb on this power generator? The national labs have been doing advanced materials development so surely there is something.
@navybook @Radioactive599 @LosAlamosNatLab @DefenseOne "“As long as the container’s intact, no danger at all. Even if it cracks open, he’ll be okay if the pellets inside don’t break. But if the pellets break, too, he’s a dead man.”  How are containers built strong enough to withstand the other side dropping bombs on them?
@Radioactive599 @LosAlamosNatLab @DefenseOne right and undoubtably they will have a means of securing spent fuel in the middle of a battlefield.

@BrentNYT Stunning piece. I've never discussed it with my family but I have no doubt that there is sufficient racism &amp; flat out meanness among Okies to do this. "city clothed private citizens w/ authority to arrest...instructed them to kill &amp; quite likely instructed them to burn Greenwood"
@BrentNYT What a gift for you to have known John Hope Franklin. The Tulsa Riot was horrible but I never learned of it in OK schools. That's a massive mistake.
@BrentNYT Most people have no idea. My grandmother was born there when it was Indian Territory. The NA were given the land collectively (as they had lived in NC etc) but then Congress decided to partition the land and give it in pieces to members of the tribes. I think that destroyed them.
@BrentNYT https://t.co/znfNQhGm2f
@BrentNYT No but that was the 1830's and European interaction with Native Americans began in the early 1600's. btw I come from Oklahoma where the Trail of Tears terminated and spent summers growing up at Fort Gibson, OK where the tribes were brought after the march. Deep sadness.

In contrast to China Puerto Rico's private sector vastly decreased their debt burden while the PR govt increased debt (most of which was non productive).

"Peter Friedman, @AAFAFPR's lawyer, defends Cofina agreement. "We endorse it because it turns a lawsuit into cash that government can use. We can't risk losing (a lawsuit) and receiving nothing." Cofina is valid &amp; Friedman gets close to admitting that #muniland https://t.co/Xj3bcGxI5m

@BChappatta Promesa is written so that both GOs and Cofina get paid. This was done because Cofina and GOs were constructed under different legal frameworks. Promesa 201.b. "(N) respect the relative lawful priorities or lawful liens, as may be applicable, in the constitution, other laws".

@_the_long_b0nd @njaresko 11 US Code §1125
@njaresko 5) Big statutory hurdle to approving Cofina plan of adjustment is that disclosure statement didnt meet requirements of 11 US Code §1125 incoporated in Promesa via §301. Law requires bondholders be told of tax treatment of proposed exchange. And IRS wanted to weigh in. #muniland https://t.co/quYIp0rOTQ
@njaresko 4) OBoard told T3 court that adequate junior representation participated in the negotiations. Baseline question is was GMS denied participation in the negotiations? Page 45 OBoard omnibus response to objections https://t.co/DRnokLA6wf #muniland https://t.co/BmlE6UjtH0
3) Central question is who participated in negotiations. @njaresko asserted pre T3 negotiations under Judge Gropper were "good faith" but everyone knows that is a falsehood. GMS is challenging who represented juniors &amp; likely Judge Houser will have to provide testimony #muniland
2) Although Promesa doesnt require showing of insolvency it does require that Puerto Rico be on a path to completing audited financials. PR govt &amp; OB slow walked. Bondholders had no reasonably current financial data to ascertain whether proposed exchange was fair or not #muniland
Why the Title 3 court *wont* approve Cofina plan of adjustment:	1) Bondholders were not told collateral backing security interest was reduced $180M by cutting taxes. Instead were told reduction was necessary to fund "essential services". No disclosure in FP, SA or POA #muniland

Puerto Rico Nov revenues "surpassed both those of June 29 certified fiscal plan by $63.2 million &amp; revised projections of October 23 certified fiscal plan by $25.5 million."

@Sincomillas Best for 2019!
@AssetElliott That's what I thought. So a real estate collapse implodes everything. Just saw they are allowing local govts to draw forward 2019 debt issuance allowance (I think its less than USD 200B). That will prop things for a little longer.
@AssetElliott What savings vehicles do households have? Their equity market just got destroyed this year and effectively they don't have a retail bond market.
@AssetElliott Chinese have always had very high savings rates https://t.co/FKKECWA8Nj  Idea that they would shift culturally from savers to consumers seemed unreasonable to me (other than on the margins). Belt &amp; Road seems like an effort to create new export markets but leaves them exposed.

@MUDDLAW @GarciaManny4 @martedaniel1 Likely Legislature says they have to keep the workers for two years minimum and P3 firms just add in additional cost. Then after two years the bad workers are out the door.
@GarciaManny4 @martedaniel1 Hmmm. Where did you see that figure?
@MUDDLAW Insurers have sufficent position to seek a receiver. That was true in their first adversary case for a receiver. I think it's more likely that Ad Hoc guys join receiver motion.
@GarciaManny4 @martedaniel1 What I dont get is how they plan to privatize transmission and distribution and require P3 firm keep all those workers (who have something like +10 times the workers comp rate of mainland).
@BernardiMuni @stlouisfed Good call.
@GarciaManny4 @martedaniel1 I guess PR govt would argue they are waiting on additional $10 billion from CDBG funds to improve the grid. But meanwhile what are the AEE workers doing? AFFAF attendence report magically doesnt account for the +5,000 Prepa workers.

@eltarot As for shaming: people who genuinely need assistance should receive it. Those who refuse to engage in the workplace and are able bodied should be called out. Puerto Rico will transition to a work requirement for PAN. Do you think that will harm people?
@eltarot I think we have fundamental difference of opinion here. Women who head households by themselves face a tough time but that's not the responsibility of companies that have no familial connection to them.
@eltarot Oddly capitalism has thrived for hundreds of years and lifted billions out of poverty without requiring maternity leave. Capitalism also presupposes an intact nuclear family which is less common these days. As I said I personally don't endorse govt mandating this for employers.
@eltarot I honestly think maternal leave should be up to individual employers and not mandated by govt. Some companies can afford it and some can't. To require it means companies that can't afford it won't hire women.

@MUDDLAW @ChSobrino Inserting a million or so people into an economy where they've prob not participated much before is a big task.
@MUDDLAW @ChSobrino Of course but nonprofits need to create volunteer opportunities to accommodate the influx. Takes time to organize, create online database etc.
@DaniaPeriodista Agree but need a phased approach since there are not jobs or volunteer positions to absorb every one at once.
@Investorfok @DividendMaster Good work.
Puerto Rico fiscal agency head &amp; governor's appointee to OBoard, @ChSobrino, responds to OB's demand to make food stamp receipants work 80 hours a week starting next year. He points out that govt chose a phased, multi-year approach since unemployment is high #muniland https://t.co/qET9otjkXZ
"Democratic Congresswoman @NydiaVelazquez (NY) circulated a draft bill that seeks to avoid conflicts of interest of consulting firms in the restructuring of Puerto Rico’s debt, such as that reported of @McKinsey."  https://t.co/QUp6gofFfr #muniland
I'm in favor of Puerto Rico implementing work requirements for social benefits for the able bodied but OBoard says not implementing these will damage econ growth. If true how come PR govt estimates 10,000 new manufacturing jobs in 2019? OB thesis likely proven wrong #muniland https://t.co/WoWhw0RD52
"A Texas municipal utility last week announced a new power purchase agreement for 255 MW of solar energy at less than $25/MWh, one of the nation's cheapest ever solar deals." Calling Prepa. Low cost power and pay off the debt. #muniland https://t.co/yZjINiNVEi
"Russia has announced plans to establish its first military base in the Caribbean since the Cold War and its predecessor, the Soviet Union, after reaching an agreement with Venezuela." Wouldnt be surprised if US govt reappropriated Roosevelt Roads airbase in Puerto Rico. https://t.co/tgo2z6ZeOZ

Also when Puerto Rico OBoard estimates economic growth rates out 40 years it's important to recall that @BLS_gov says "without CPS data on PR, policymakers are limited in estimating the full econ impact of different policy changes." https://t.co/Ogu8X1bxI1 #muniland https://t.co/3AFCamiGtu
It's important for Puerto Rico to liberalize restrictive employment practices but its unclear why OBoard didnt accept @trschatz51 compromise for *prospective* changes to labor law. Also PR govt employees have +35% absentism rate which seems to be a bigger economic drag #muniland https://t.co/JEnSa1Qu1J
"China only recently has been introducing the concept of risk-based pricing for credit in the bond market. That's after it's already surged to become, at +$11 trillion, 3rd-biggest in size in the world." Outstanding live blog of #China40years reform anniv https://t.co/GoMmv7zD4U https://t.co/EJHv2lZdr1
@JoseOyola2 Agree that Prepa is probably the major economic issue but OBoard has done zero to assist bondholders. Otherwise they would have accepted restructuring support agreement for Prepa that Promesa authorized. OBoard could have compromised with @trschatz51 on prospective labor reform.
@amontara11 Wonderful. Thanks for recommending.

Insurance credit rater @AMBestCo analyst visits Puerto Rico says Maria losses hard to estimate because much business insurance includes business interruption coverage and risk models have difficulty calculating those losses [especially since Prepa was out for so long] #muniland https://t.co/m4MNl0ECli
Puerto Rico bank deposits swell -- "In the third quarter of 2018, local customer deposits registered an increase of $6.139 billion or 13.2%, when compared to the same period of 2017, establishing a record level of $52.681 billion." #muniland https://t.co/3ACfW4Ofxw

@chuckat60 @Sec_Laboy_DDEC @McKinsey That is a fundemental question for Congress and PR govt when they address statehood. Any change in federal tax regime would likely occur over several decades.
@glopezpadro @Sec_Laboy_DDEC @McKinsey Have to ask @njaresko and @FOMBPR what data they used to project Act 154 revenues will collapse ~~ It's almost if they want the Puerto Rico economy to fail. (chart from Oct 23 fiscal plan pge 24) https://t.co/rZkv5Q0iHs
Puerto Rico head of economic development @Sec_Laboy_DDEC says they have visited ~20 corporate headquarters in US &amp; Germany &amp; manufacturing will add ~10,000 jobs in in PR in 2019.

@TayTayLLP I just skimmed it. Please tweet any important stuff.
Must read thread by @AppDemography on the importance of an independent statistics institute for Puerto Rico. The unwillingness of PR govt to share mortality data post Maria could be a harbinger of things to come unfortunately. #muniland https://t.co/aLA4Gx5zO7
