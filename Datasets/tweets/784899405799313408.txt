@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Yes it is, you praise people murdering their fellow Americans. You celebrate mass shootings.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA No, it's not, read Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Theft isn't punishable by the death penalty, we are a country of laws, you don't have the right to extrajudicial execution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA It's what all NRA members want. They want a bloodbath of monumental scale. That's what they've programed into you. That you must murder your fellow countrymen or have your guns taken away.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Nope, sorry. Read Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Yea. That's not a threat. If someone comes to confiscate their means of  self defense, they're not going to let it happen.	How is that a threat?		https://t.co/CqhhYB0fhA
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You hate the United States, you hate the people of the United States, you want to murder as many Americans as you can, but you don't want any consequences of that action, that's why you are a part of the NRA.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You did, you want to murder your fellow countrymen. That is what you want to do. Because you're an insurgent.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA They haven't, DC v Heller never said registration of firearms was illegal.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You want to wage war against the people of the United States for exercising congress's right to regulate the militia. 		Which is against Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You've admitted you hate the United States, hate it's people, want to take up arms against the people of the United States. 		How are you not a traitor?
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA That's the MAGA realm		I live in Reality, where Congress can pass a law that requires background checks. You're a traitor. An admitted one as well.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Nope, sorry, you're a traitor.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You've already admitted that you would not obey the laws of the Union, and you'd take up arms against your fellow countrymen. You're a traitor.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Sorry pall, you're an insurrectionist, a violation of Article I Section 8 Clause 16. And Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA No, as you have admitted, you're an insurrectionist, you've violated Article I Section 8 Clause 16, and Article III Section 3 of the United states Constitution.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Your rights are to defend yourself, but as you have said, you would take up arms against your fellow countrymen, you aren't a Militia, you're an insurrectionist, which the Constitution requires the Militia to suppress.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You did say that. 		"Yea. That's not a threat. If someone comes to confiscate their means of  self defense, they're not going to let it happen.	How is that a threat?"		https://t.co/CqhhYB0fhA
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA No, well regulated, means in good working order, which you are not. You have no officer appointed by your state, you have not received training as proscribed by congress, you do not train with your fellow Militia to be in good standing, you are not well regulated.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Yes, because of the nature of the 2nd Amendment, it wasn't so you can arm yourselves against your fellow countrymen. Which you have admitted to doing.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You've already said it, you'd violate Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution, willingly.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Read that A well regulated Militia part, slowly. 		That's this nation's greatest national defense strategy that you've turned into this country's greatest national security threat.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA Oh please, like you know what you're talking about. You don't even know the articles of the Constitution that I've referenced. You know nothing except the last half of the 2nd Amendment. You're pathetic.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA The reason the People were supposed to be armed is because we weren't supposed to have a standing army in times of peace. The people were supposed to be this nation's defense. You are a national security threat. Not it's defenders.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA I have, sorry troll, you don‚Äôt have a constitutional leg to stand on.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA You‚Äôre begging for help, but none is coming. America‚Äôs sick of the mass shootings, and we‚Äôre going to take care of the problem, which is you insurrectionists.
@TheGraviter @NRA @CONSMILITIA I‚Äôve heard hat exact bullshit cop out. That fag blocked me long time ago cause he knows I‚Äôm right.
@TheGraviter @NRA Their isn‚Äôt an epidemic of gun theft, it‚Äôs an epidemic of private sellers selling no questions asked gun sales.
@TheGraviter @NRA As it should be because that‚Äôs how criminals get guns!
@TheGraviter @NRA Article I Section 8 Clause 16 of the United States Constitution, and thus proving you‚Äôve never bothered to read it.
@TheGraviter @NRA Yes it is, but you, being a criminal, are scared of a real background check. Because you know you can‚Äôt pass one, along with most of the NRA, that‚Äôs why they say that background checks will take your guns away, they know you‚Äôre just a criminal.
@TheGraviter @NRA If this country was invaded, you wouldn‚Äôt know what to do. Who to report to, you‚Äôd do the enemy the favor of killing your own countrymen, because you‚Äôre not a part of a well regulated militia, you‚Äôre just an insurrectionist.
@TheGraviter @NRA That‚Äôs what HR8 is going after.
@TheGraviter @NRA Except you aren‚Äôt, you‚Äôre the people the Militia were supposed to stop.
@TheGraviter @NRA Can‚Äôt disarm the Militia, the well regulated militia.
@TheGraviter @NRA You won‚Äôt be happy till America is a huge rolling gun battle.
@TheGraviter @NRA Exactly the problem, you do not give a crap about how many Americans are murdered by firearms.
@TheGraviter @NRA Besides being a violation of Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution? Oh right, y‚Äôall have never bothered to read the Constitution have you?

And the owner of the gun is responsible for every crime that happens with their gun.
@TheGraviter @NRA Because the NRA believes most of y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt pass a real background check, they‚Äôve been saying it over and over again. They think y‚Äôall are a bunch of criminals.
@TheGraviter @NRA If they actually did adequate background checks, the NRA would lose about 4 million members overnight.
@TheGraviter @NRA Yeah private sales loopholes, boyfriend loopholes all got to close.
@TomiLahren Boo hoo Tomi.
@TheGraviter @NRA Y‚Äôall keep saying that, however, most mass shooters get their guns legally. 		And yes private sales should have background checks on them too. 		The fact is, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to stop Illegal gun sales.
@iamcardib Not a chance in hell Cardi. You're great and all, but you don't have enough money for me. 		But I hope you find someone you like.

@Ms_TeeWiz @JustAGrummp2 But the one honest thing he did, was show the world he's an asshole. He wasn't faking being an asshole, you didn't find out later that he's an asshole, he is a straight up an asshole and it's well known.
@TypingLiterally Um, it's a parody account.
@siano2020 Nope.
@JustAGrummp2 @Ms_TeeWiz That's being an asshole. The consequences of which, are everyone telling you you're being an asshole, and apparently becoming president of the United States.

Miller‚Äôs holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those ‚Äúin common use at the time‚Äù finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons		At the time of this ruling, the AR-15 was not a weapon in common use.
or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. 		And the NRA is fighting to pug guns in schools, and removing so called "Gun Free Zones"
The Court‚Äôs opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, 		But the NRA wants the mentally ill to carry. And opposes any legislation that would allow police to take guns from felons.
For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. 		But the NRA wants expanded CCW, and Concealed Carry Reciprocity
Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose		https://t.co/uUiHA9gujb https://t.co/31Nlp6kAbV

@TXwoodworker98 @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris It's actually required by the 2nd Amendment, That whole "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State", part.
@MarkWilkbank @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris Oh, they have, have they? They've stated publicly, "We will require Colorado Liberal to bust into every gun owners home and forcibly take all the guns!"		I'm a construction superintendent, not a damn superhero.

@TXwoodworker98 @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris If it were up to me I'd overturn DC v Heller, and require Militia membership and training to own a firearm like it states in Article I Section 8 Clause 15 &amp; 16 and the first half of the 2nd Amendment to own a firearm, then, I'd make the Militia suppress the insurrectionists.
@MarkWilkbank @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris And, doesn't mean it's wrong. Since you aren't proving it's wrong, must mean that it's correct and you can't refute it otherwise.

@MarkWilkbank @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris Why the hell do you think I want to take your guns.

@MarkWilkbank @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris Most mass shooters bought their guns legally.

"I can go get a gun right now just down the road, from the back of a guy's van, no BC needed!"
@MarkWilkbank @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris Gun registration and background checks don't affect the law abiding. But the NRA believing that y'all are criminals keeps telling you they'll take your guns away. 		If you're not a criminal, you'll pass a background check.
@MSNBC They need to start asking where the mass grave sites are. We're eventually going to find them.
@MarkWilkbank @SMcpaco73010 @KamalaHarris The NRA doesn't publish a list of their members. 		If they did, I'm sure a lot of names would crop up on murderer lists. 		Course, there's a terrorist that was an NRA member, Timothy McVeigh. We know that.

@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Yes, I know, the specific reason you think you have a right to a gun, is for the expressed purpose of using it against your fellow countrymen. A violation of the 2nd Amendment, Article III Section 3, and what the Militia is Constitutionally obligated to fight against.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Then obviously you only have a passing interest in the subject matter. You want your guns, but other than that, you could give a damn. 		The whole point of the "Texas Militia" is to declare war against the United States Government, when they decide the US is to "tyrannical".

Despite what the NRA says, it wasn't intended for the people to have the right to murder Constitutionally elected citizens on a whim.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Also, notice that everything I've said is in the United States Constitution, and doesn't ban a single gun. 		And you're arguing against it.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Again, when a single stabber can kill 50 people and injure over 500 in ten minutes with a knife. We'll talk about knife control.
@ewan7279 @chrpnbrd @bstreier @NRA The point and purpose of Article I Section 8 Clause 15, 16, and the 2nd Amendment is so the people defended this nation against invasion and insurrection. And we weren't supposed to have a standing army in times of peace saving us hundreds of billions of dollars a year in taxes.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Neither received training as proscribed by Congress, nor are a part of the Militia which has no officer appointed by the state of Texas. 		Those "militia" groups are insurgent groups, which is forbidden by the Constitution, and it is the duty of the actual Militia to suppress.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Show me a mass stabbing where the perpetrator killed over 50 people and injured over 500, in ten minutes and we'll talk about knife control.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Bullshit. In fact, it's the NRA's top propaganda, that tells you that your right to bear arms is for the day you can use them in war against the elected people of the United States, in clear violation of Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA You have never received training as proscribed by Congress to be a part of a Militia. 		You have no commanding officer, appointed by your state that you report to. 		And the NRA and you do not demand these things, therefore, you've refused them.
@chrpnbrd @ewan7279 @bstreier @NRA Let me enlighten you, because you've proven you've never read the United States Constitution. 		The tradeoff for you to be able to buy one or twenty guns, is that you have the responsibility to come to this nation's defence to repel invasions, &amp; suppress insurrections.

@HaymanWood @NRA They‚Äôre saying that they believe you couldn‚Äôt pass a universal background check, even though, if like you say, you‚Äôre not a criminal, it won‚Äôt affect you. 		But they keep repeating the line that universal background checks will keep you from getting guns.
@DonaldJTrumpJr What do you know? A Trump, trying to stoke hatred and racism against a minority group, Isn‚Äôt that a surprise?
@HaymanWood @NRA They‚Äôre the ones saying y‚Äôall can‚Äôt pass a background check. Because they‚Äôre the ones that think y‚Äôall are criminals.

@treecarverbill I get it, you hate the United States, you hate the people of the United States. You love your guns, and think that you should be able to murder as many people as you have bullets for. 		But 1.7% of the United States isn't a majority, it's an insurgency.

@SAHinchcliffe @LShrug @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino There is no specification of "Unorganized" in the 2nd Amendment.
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA "A right delayed is a right denied" 		Bullshit. 		All of my ideas come directly from the United States Constitution. Sorry you hate the United States Constitution. Perhaps you should leave to a country more to your liking, like Somalia.
@treecarverbill It would reduce gun violence in this country. And it is the purpose of the Militia as outlined in the United States Constitution.
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA Both apply equally well to the modern NRA. 		Especially seeing that they're compromised by the GRU.
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino The things I wrote are enshrined in the United States Constitution. Sadly, you hate the United States Constitution, and have never bothered to read it. 		That's not my fault.

@treecarverbill @critter9a @NRA Missed the National Intelligence Briefing to congress did you?
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA Just the ones that apply.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA Not my problem if you refuse to read.
@treecarverbill @NRA Because militaries existed prior to the ratification of the United States Constitution. Military tradition existed. 		We didn't invent the idea of a military.
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino You have never received Militia training as proscribed by Congress. 		You do not have a commanding officer appointed by your state. 		You are not properly functioning, you are the insurgency.
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA You're insurgents (or to use the modern term) illegal enemy combatants.
@LShrug @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino Which you aren't. 		You have no commanding officer appointed by your state. You have never received Militia training as proscribed by Congress. 		You are not in good working order.
@JLJohnson45 @LShrug @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino Yeah, which you aren't.
@treecarverbill Then stop smoking it.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA That's why I wanted you to read what the NRA is saying unfiltered and unabridged. They're claiming you're a criminal.
@treecarverbill I don't want a single gun banned.
@treecarverbill @critter9a @NRA Quit listening to Russian propaganda!
@LShrug @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino No, I don't want a single gun banned. 	What I want is strict adherence to Article I Section 8 Clause 15 &amp; 16, and the first half of the 2nd Amendment. 		But, that's the Constitution, none of y'all have ever bothered to read it.
@treecarverbill Your DI did you no favors did he? 		There is no such thing as a Militia comprised of 1 person with no commanding officer appointed by the state. 		That is not a Militia, that is an insurgent. Or, if you prefer, an illegal enemy combatant.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA I showed you where the proof is, I can't read it for you.
@JLJohnson45 @LShrug @NRA Y'all aren't for the 4th Amendment, nor do you care about the 5th Amendment. If you were, you'd be protesting airport security.

@cliffhangernlv @NRA Mass shootings are the most devastating. But I'm against all gun violence. But, y'all aren't. Which is the problem. Y'all relish gun violence, you enjoy it, you wish for it. You hope for it.
@treecarverbill Like the part where Scalia wrote that the 2nd Amendment is not an unlimited right? 		Maybe you should read DC v Heller.
@treecarverbill @NRA I am talking about the military definition of well regulated, which you are not.
@LShrug @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino You're not about defending lives, you're for the legalization of murder. You're for the right to own firearms without any responsibility. 		Don't bullshit me.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA Bitch at the NRA, they think y'all are criminals.
@LShrug @JLJohnson45 @NRA Police have the right to defend themselves against someone they believe is an immediate threat to them. 		The NRA defended the shooting of legal gun owner Philando Castile, didn't see y'all bitch about that.
@treecarverbill Yep, y'all are against A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State.		Y'all hate that because you are insurgents, which the Constitution requires the Militia to suppress.
@treecarverbill @NRA Sure as hell are against the first half of it. It's a one sentence Amendment, and y'all completely ignore the first half.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA I'm not the one saying it, it's the NRA that's saying it. 		Every time a law comes up that would prohibit criminals from legally possessing firearms, the NRA screams "they're taking your guns away"		Because the NRA believes it's members are criminals.
@treecarverbill @NRA I know 3. 		Article I Section 8 Clause 15 United States Constitution.		Article I Section 8 Clause 16 United States Constitution. 		2nd Amendment of the United States Constitution. 		All of which, y'all are against.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA Gun laws don't take away your rights. Unless you're a criminal. Which I suspect is actually the case. Which is why there's so much resistance to gun control, because a great majority of you if there were actual gun control wouldn't be permitted to own a firearm.
@cliffhangernlv @NRA Gun deaths are gun deaths. You can't subtract because you don't feel like those are "legitimate gun deaths" 		That's not how facts work. Facts don't care about your feelings, and you can't just subtract statistics that you don't like.
@treecarverbill @NRA Because too many idiots are able to legally buy firearms, that should never be anywhere near a firearm.
@JLJohnson45 @NRA Oh really, what rights have been taken away from you? Please be very specific. I want the actual law, and not some fantasy cooked up by the GRU/NRA team.

@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino The idea behind gun ownership is for self protection is it not? If you‚Äôre not responsible enough to protect your tools, maybe you need to bear the consequences of that failure. 		Y‚Äôall want gun ownership without any responsibility, that‚Äôs not going to happen.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino If they took the proper steps their guns wouldn‚Äôt be in the hands of criminals.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino Then you‚Äôre proving those precautions were ineffective, and thus the gun owner failed in his responsibility to secure his firearms and thus must be held accountable for the crimes his/her failure has contributed to. They‚Äôre now an accessory to any crime committed by their guns.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino Actually it‚Äôs y‚Äôall that deflect from the issue. I.E. deflecting from guns to cars. Because when you can‚Äôt form a coherent argument, deflecting is the go to.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino Cars unlike alcohol and guns aren‚Äôt a constitutional right.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino No excuse, you are responsible for your firearms, if they are stolen, it‚Äôs your fault they‚Äôre stolen, and you should be held liable for any crimes committed with your firearms.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino ‚ÄúStolen‚Äù uh huh, doesn‚Äôt sound like the behavior of responsible gun owners to me.		Sounds like an excuse used in many a murder case.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino Sounds like someone needs to have their Federal Gun sales license revoked and be charged as an accessory to every crime committed by his ‚Äústolen‚Äù guns to me.
@Jawbonz @NRA @DLoesch @dbongino So those guns serendipitously just appear on the black market?		Or, is the firearms black market (more likely) fueled by law abiding gun owners?
