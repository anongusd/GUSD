@Grits4Breakfast I'm sure you're right that it picks up a good number
@Grits4Breakfast I agree with you that treatment helps more than incarceration but there are some places where incarceration would be necessary particular dealers
@Grits4Breakfast Of course I knew that that's why I asked are we considering cocaine and heroin and methamphetamines in all of this I think the legislature would have much more trouble with those drugs
RT @Grits4Breakfast: @jerrymadden Pot is almost all misdemeanor. These are mostly other controlled substances.
@Grits4Breakfast The question is not necessarily treatment amounts but what amounts are dealers amounts versus individual user amounts	 I don't think treating dealers helps much I do think treating individuals does.
@Grits4Breakfast I certainly agree with you on the difference between felony and misdemeanor at least on some substances and any of those of course would be a money saver of some amount
@Grits4Breakfast I think the legislature would have trouble putting all controlled substances in this category schitt's somewhere extremely dangerous
