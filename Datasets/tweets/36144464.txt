Again voting against Equality are Ruff, Black (@SenRichardBlack), and Reeves (@ReevesVA)
@SenatorWexton SB 822 Fair Housing passes committee, 11-3.
Catholic Church insistent that they want to deny housing to LGBT individuals
Religious liberty argument being used again as an excuse to not provide LGBT housing protections.
Senators voting against workplace protections : Ruff, Black (@SenRichardBlack) , &amp; Reeves (@ReevesVA)
SB 822 from @SenatorWexton providing LGBT housing protections now being heard.
SB 783 reports from committee 12-3, it will be heard on the Senate floor.
@AdamEbbin makes the point that even if "only"  twelve complaints of discrimination were reported they deserve to be heard.
Family Foundation makes an argument that providing LGBT workplace protections somehow will run afoul of religious liberties.
First up is @AdamEbbin with SB 783, LGBT workplace protections.

Del. Freitas' "religious freedom" HB2025 passed committee. We opposed this unnecessary bill as houses of worship are already protected.
Despite 80% of Virginians supporting this type of legislation,  @DelegateMark's workplace bill failed in committee.
Opposing the bill a speaker from Family Foundation said people are not getting fired/not hired for being LGBT. This is just not true.
Now up: @DelegateMark's workplace nondiscrimination bill, HB2129. Many here in favor including @ProgressVA @ACLUVA and business leaders
Another bill from Del. Marshall, HB2011, also failed in committee. Before leaving he tells committee members he "prays they get courage."
