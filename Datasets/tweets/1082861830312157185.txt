Take away the power of a government shutdown by returning power to the states and privatizing other services.  There is no reason for National Parks to be closed where people are not needed to run things.  Access is being denied to parking lots!
The media is completely in cahoots with politicians.  The proof lies in the fact that know journalist followed-up, or posed the direct question to @SpeakerPelosi when it was revealed that she intended to fly 88 non-elected "family members" to Afghanistan on our dime!
The demise of our empire will be greater than the Romans.  They were distracted by rulers with games of carnage in the Colosseum.  Our distraction game of carnage is Politics.  Distract and conquer.  We need to wake up.

Notice how the media completely ignored any reaction by the people over the fact that Nancy Pelosi’s trip included 88 family members on the taxpayer dime?  It’s because they get to travel for free also.  The media is part of the problem.

Time to privatize the national Parks so the politicians can’t restrict our access during their hissy fits.  I’m sure we could save billions.
Why are National Parks closed before parking lots.  No reason to restrict access to public areas.
@HillaryClinton Yes, let’s let the uneducated vote.  Bound to help the Democrats.
We need to demand the disclosure of the members of congress who had sexual harassment claims paid for by our tax dollars, then voted to hide that information from us.  Don’t let them get away with it.
