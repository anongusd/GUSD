We’ll talk more about Fox Conner and his impact this week during the George C. Marshall Leadership Seminar @FortLeavenworth.	#GeorgeMarshall2019
“Although Conner retired from the army a year before World War II began, his mentorship of these senior American generals when they were young officers left an imprint on the battlefield—and made Major General Fox Conner a significant contributor to the Allied victory.”
“He was also influential to another important wartime figure: U.S. Army chief of staff General George C. Marshall.”
”The answer is that more than anyone else, Conner was responsible for placing Patton and Eisenhower at that point in history.”	@usacac @TRADOC @USArmy
‘’Why did Patton spend time writing to an obscure old soldier, given the crisis?”	https://t.co/lUD43FAKZJ		#ArmyROTC #GeorgeMarshall2019 	@CG_ArmyROTC @CSM_ArmyROTC @usacac

BG Rosende - You need to understand, everything that you do, the actions that you take, speak a lot louder than the words you pass on to someone. You are always setting the example for others. #ActionsSpeakLouder #alwaysflytheairplane
LTG Leslie Smith - You have to help each other. All of us on the front row here, have helped each other at one point in time. And that’s what the Army is looking for you to do - the Army needs you to help each other be successful. #NoSpotlightRangers
Understanding you are a role model to someone every single day in every action that you take. 		#WarriorLeaders #ArmyROTC #SouthernGuardBattalion
LTG Nadia West - You have to be a person of character so your word is trusted when you give advice.
About what it takes, not about being a General, but what it takes to be successful in life.
LTG Bruce Crawford - Our voices, in my mind, are the most impactful when we’re doing this. When we are out talking to you and sharing lessons learned.

@SFAHutch "What is the purpose of the ice coolers that cadets dip arms in?"		Cadets use arm immersion to lower their body temperature during high exertion in extreme heat. It is a method in the Army to combat heat injuries. #AskROTC
#CadetSummerTraining is physically and mentally rigorous. Our advice would be to learn from those who experienced it first hand. These Cadets got real with us and you about what to expect: https://t.co/5ifhTqmQfq #AskROTC https://t.co/ZEXjegkLVV

LTG Twitty, @FirstArmy CG, deal with reality, trust but verify, there’s going to be a lot of bad news when you go to combat... never lose your integrity to your Soldiers.  Watch your emotions. There are some things only you can fix! You need to know the things only you can fix.
LTG Twitty, First Army CG, to Cadets at #40thGCM. Know your Soldiers - know their strengths and weaknesses. You have to be the calm [in the storm]. You understand why it’s important that your job is to motivate, inspire and lead.
Third, your job is to lead. That’s the most difficult job of the three. LTG Stephen Twitty, CG, First Army, to Cadets at #40thGCM on the final of the three reasons leaders exist. #armyrotc #cadetcommand
Your next job is to inspire. LTG Stephen Twitty, CG, First Army to Cadets on the second of the three reasons leaders exist. #40thGCM
