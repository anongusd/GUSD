If we were in office, we'd do literally everything differently. #soturesponse
Economy is bad, terrorists are worse than ever, jobs suck, and healthcare is still very broken. Immigration reform is needed. #soturesponse
Nikki Haley is governor of S.C. She believes Bamz is an eloquent speaker. But everything he says is incorrect.
OK, 2 people were annoyed that we didn't do the GOP response, so here goes, from the transcript. Ahem. Wait what's the hashtag?
@edbellmcse The SOTU was vapid, we thought, so the response didn't seem like it had much to pwn.
@idkMOMidc Yes, I think? What part?
@ryanmayton It's more that we didn't feel the #SOTU even said anything worth responding to, and also that we can't find it streaming.
Oh, and we will not be tweeting the GOP response because you can probably guess the stuffs.
If our tweets weren't enough for you (sniff!), read the full text of the #sotu here. Thanks, Obama!	https://t.co/dM3WBPn0Qg
Entire country makes FNL jokes. #SOTU
&lt;LOUD PRONOUNCEMENTS AND GESTURES AS APPLAUSE RISES!&gt; #SOTU
In case you're not watching and you're confused: yes, guns have not been mentioned! We're as shocked as you! #SOTU
&lt;Winding down with powerful language and parallel construction&gt; #SOTU
Bamz sees goodness and decency in American humans every day, and clearly doesn't read Internet comments. #SOTU
The future depends on the People: speak out, stand up for others, vote. [Idea: Maybe voting should be doable via Netflix somehow?] #SOTU
Gerrymandering is nuts, campaign financing is nuts, the voting system is old-fashioned, but the People must demand change. [Yikes.] #SOTU
Bamz feels he has failed with bridging the divide of parties. The politicians don't even like the way things are. #SOTU
Politicians should stop trying to zing each other like they're in Grisham courtroom dramas. #SOTU
We all want the same dang things: money, chill time, knowing our kids will have money and chill time. #SOTU
Alert: Entire country now mesmerized by Bamz's hypnotic speech and masterful pauses and who knows what is happening. #SOTU
No politics that target people because of race or religion. Almost exactly what our forefathers said just with that big difference. #SOTU
HIV/AIDS battle is going well, malaria battle is on the horizon. No word as to whether Biden is curing those diseases as well. #SOTU
Quotes about leadership that everyone else will tweet, thankfully, because I forgot already. #SOTU
The thing with Cuba didn't do well for anybody, but the Trans-Pacific Partnership will. #SOTU
The Syria situation is not wonderful. The Iran Nuclear Deal is, though, as illustrated by a simple illustration using arrows. #SOTU
Many important Al-Qaeda and ISIL leaders have been killed by us. Chest bumps all around. #SOTU
Terrorists have to be taken out, and ISIL blows the worst. But they don't threaten the USA-ness of our very essence. #SOTU
We have to help sort out what our post-WWII system left out for the rest of the world. #SOTU
We generally intimidate every other country because of our charm? Or military! #SOTU
Ol' Dirty Energy needs go away. #SOTU
Look at it this way, American businesses can sell climate change solutions and make $$. That doesn't make you happy, GOP? #SOTU
If you believe climate change is fake, you will have no friends. #SOTU
Breaking news, America is the land of opportunity. And Joe Biden is pulling himself up by the bootstraps and personally curing cancer? #SOTU
Something about Sputnik #SOTU
Parties agree on some steps taken towards helping economy, but differ on how much the gov't should help or hinder huge businesses. #SOTU
Cast Pinball Wizard spells while quaffing ales https://t.co/RJRi85AVFa
College is ridiculously unaffordable. Don't forget Bamz's sweet free community college idea. He has not. #SOTU
More people are graduating from high school. We should have pre-K for all, particularly with more nerdy lessons. #SOTU
Droids are taking jobs from humans. #SOTU
Stuff that'd be cool in the future: We all are richer, we have cooler tech, we are powerful as a country, politics aren't awful. #SOTU
Progress since 2009: More jobs, lower unemployment, lower uninsured rate, fewer deployed troops, gay marriage. #SOTU
We will bring you Things You Actually Need to Know, Stripped of Rhetoric. As soon as one comes up. #SOTU
