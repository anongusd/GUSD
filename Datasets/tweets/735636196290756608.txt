would appear to be the constitutional rule
the Constitution expressly limits 2 citizens only the rights to vote and  run 4 fed. office, equality between non-nationals and citizens
the Court has insisted 4 a century foreign nationals living among us are persons within the meaning of the Constitution, and are protected
@eliosc Um actually I did.  I'm consistent but nice try
@ConstantinusMag @FoxNews within the Constitution HAPPY READING https://t.co/vtaF8zU92R
@ConstantinusMag @FoxNews That's actually incorrect. For centuries the courts have stated that foreign nationals living among us are persons
@FoxNews If that's the case then its time to call in the Feds.  He is flouting a Federal Court ruling.  #25thamendment
@KharazyMehrdad Sadly, I understand and I stand with you and I will gladly give you and all Muslims a voice.  So sorry for all of this hate
There were 2500 deaths due to Saudi Arabia terrorist but no ban.  The seven countries on the banned list ZERO deaths due to terrorism
