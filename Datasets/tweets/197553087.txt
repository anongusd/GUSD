@GrandStrander @ocregister So in Minnesota......if we wanted to get a complete list......may have to start at going to 400 plus agencies.................to get names of officers then do match w crim records.
@GrandStrander @ocregister I am sure that an officer arrested/convicted of a crime either petty, misde, gross misde, or felony...would report to local agency....but to state board ONLY if it involved license.
@GrandStrander @ocregister Good question...our state licensing of officers is not as centralized as one thinks.....all discipline basically happens on local level....can only lose/regulate license for certain convictions.  State board keeps that data....state board has limited data.

Saw your report @AJInvestigates ...........the question for me still remains how #bodycam video was gotten.......part of previous court case, @MinneapolisPD made mistake or used 'dispel' clause, ie.....use of #bodycam video in your story because of our law....is an anomaly.
Mr. @AJInvestigates looking to seeing the story in a few minutes.  thanks for the conversation.
@AJInvestigates Then the question for me......your interp or @MinneapolisPD interpretation.   This may call for a data request.................#chuckling as I'm thinking if I want to do it or not
#cc @AJInvestigates
Bottomline, ya got #bodycam video.  Per 13.825....law is clear unless one of several points in law met.....you would not get #bodycam vid..unless by mistake or part of some court record as you said in previous.   Clarity how @kare11 got it is important for community to know.
@AJInvestigates A use of force case...............per #bodycam statute "or the use of force by a peace officer that results in substantial bodily harm"		Did subject in vehicle suffer 'substantial bodily harm'?
@AJInvestigates When I just saw your response..........................I'm thinking there may be a review of "threatened use of force".......I think you got it by mistake......lucky you.  		This kind of stuff should always be avail to public like in other states, this type of #bodycam video
@AJInvestigates ............."because dash cam (video) is clearly public" (to clarify)
@AJInvestigates Dash cam video............clearly simple data request.....because dash cam is clearly public, but with the #bodycam video....law is narrower.   So what ya telling me.....got #bodycam video with simple public records request?
Thank you for the info.....................never turning on the #bodycam does raise ?'s	I do hope you will share with your viewers.....how the #bodycam video was obtained by consent of subjects, by lawyers, or was it an unauthorized leak! https://t.co/YkeKxQWsFs
The video that @AJInvestigates shows as part of his @kare11 investigative piece tonight at 10 pm.....appears is a #dashcam......but think of the power of #accountability if @MinneapolisPD uses #bodycam video to do pro-active oversight on use of force.
#cc @AJInvestigates
I saw the preview.....appears it's dash cam video.  Suggest try to get #bodycam video.........you could also find out if Officer Noor had his #bodycam on.  To get the #bodycam video.....may need to get consent from the individual in vehicle https://t.co/FQ4uSLxTZr

Challenge for #mnleg is to have a designee for where the public can go to......to get access about the legislature's budget, discipline records, and data about their inner workings which are generally public with other entities outside the #mnleg	They may not want to do it.

Speaker designee @melissahortman, I hope there will be other opportunities for the public to give input particularly the general public on legislative reform ideas.	From my angle there could have been more #transparency and announcement for the meetings........

Government and information:		``Handling information is power. And if you can control what information you collect and what information you give out and what form it appears, you have a lot of power.''		John R. Finnegan, long time open-government advocate &amp; was with @PioneerPress
In many situations, the media is not charged for the costs of reproducing documents.  "Often, the media isn't told to pay because agencies see that it's in their benefit to maintain a positive relationship" with them.
In 1997, "Gov. Arne Carlson sent a bill to the Associated Press, then followed that by directing a memo to state agencies. The bill was for $235.13 - claimed as the cost of ``researching'' a request for the names and salaries of the governor's staff." #datapracticehistory #mnleg

Still rings true today......I made this comment to @StarTribune February 16, 1993 to Allen Short who I still remember.
We suffer invasions of our privacy every day," he says. "We see stories all the time about how people spy on each other. Employers spying on employees, neighbors spying on neighbors, shopkeepers spying on their customers. People need to be ever-vigilant to protect their privacy."
Doing these tweets using quotes from media outlets, gotten from the #newsbank	is yes, I'm having fun with.		BUT A MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS BEING MADE......YOU plain person can make impact and DIFFERENCE on PUBLIC POLICY!
In 1992, there was a proposal to make all conviction data at @MnDPS_BCA public......I opposed that.  There was a compromise brokered for nearly 15 years....until it became public on the Internet.		The quote in prev tweet was @StarTribune March 9, 1993
Richard Neumeister, a data privacy lobbyist, urged...committee..consider impact on individuals of releasing criminal history information. He said making records public would discriminate against people of color, who account for 30 percent of the state's criminal convictions."
I opposed Caller-ID in 1992.	from @PioneerPress Oct 29, 1992 "	"The ability of a government employee to have my phone number and possibly a name if I chose to call the local Health Department on a concern I have .. is frightening,'' Richard Neumeister....wrote to the commission."
As many followers may know.....I've been around a very long time doin stuff, but seeing old quotes from media......thought I would share some of those experiences.....may get a laugh...or who knows.
"Rich Neumeister, a St. Paul resident, is up in arms about it, saying it's a price barrier for the city's less-well-to-do citizens.  City Council...on Wednesday asked for a report on the whys and wherefores, and planned to discuss the topic next month." @StarTribune July 21, 2005

Tim Pawlenty appointed Rich Stanek, then a representative at the #mnleg as Commish of @MnDPS_DPS I opposed his appointment
"One of the concerns that I do have is that direct, abrasiveness that sometimes I have seen in committee hearings. Or that challenge or combativeness. It's important not to have that as being commissioner of public safety," according to Neumeister.  @MPRnews January 23, 2003

The @StarTribune needs to be applauded for the investigative story they have done on sexual assault and irresponsibility of agencies for horrific behavior.......but local policymakers knew about the problems and did nothing...they need to be accountable too!
@kpottermn @StarTribune and also a law that allows for this inactive crim investigation data not be #secret as it is in many states.   For nearly, 4 decades our law has allowed public and media to see with balance of #privacy protections

When I read a story like this,:	 I ask myself the who, what, where, why,.....Then I think out what a data request could look like.  But problem, not have enough time to do all the data requests I have in an interest based on what I get from the news. https://t.co/wf78bXb1JC
I will not be doing the data request, but I'm sure others may.  The @minneapolispd may play some games with these specific requests....
To read, listen, or watch media news...one learns about happenings like Andy Mannix's story on use of #ketamine		Then it is up to public to ask the questiond and get answers.
After read story by Andy Mannix I would do #datarequest for:		Use of force reports involving use of ketamine, same with incident reports.		Secondly, I'd ask for #bodycam videos.		Thirdly, do request in specific areas of use of force training materials.		Good luck.
The @startribune piece use of drug on people raises issues...		Use of force by police is ever changing.....reviewing use of force &amp; incident reports over years have seen usage of many techniques, drugs, physical, and tech.
Use of Ketamine by @minneapolispd and @hennepin EMS is a "use of force"  Wonder if MPD agree?

As I read these use of force/incident reports....I see "BWC Video does NOT Exist" mentioned # of times....tempted to ask why.
Data element of race is important to collect,  with use of force, if an agency does not collect it.....is it by design or ignorance?  #accountability
There's a high frequency of subjects when use of force is done who are provided medical treatment.....I see in many reports, does this raise questions?
Who oversees agencies when use of force.....is done behind locked and closed doors? No body of an institutional nature, before there was ombudsman, but #mnleg done away with.
Role of use of force in jail settings is topic that public does not hear about much.......but use of force happens quite often.  Verbal direction, to use of pressure points.....to tasing...it runs the list.
Many use of force situations......are now on film in MPLS and ST PAUL police departments.  But most are secret. There are ways for public to review, but its a long hard road to take.
Use of force report says: "my tazer was visibly shown to gain compliance."  This agency considers this use of force, why report is done, many do not.		How often is a gun displayed to gain compliance?
#transparencytuesday continues with finishing up review use of force reports for an agency.  Then starting initiative how effective agencies responding to public w their  #requests
