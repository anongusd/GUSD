Disgusting. https://t.co/IC2kww99I6
I‚Äôll probably write much more about this offline. But here‚Äôs my point: Facts don‚Äôt lie. Behaviors reveal all. And slogans need to be worked to be made reality. 14/14
So, when people say, ‚ÄúOh 1984 was so long ago,‚Äù I am here to say, ‚ÄúNo it was not.‚Äù We knew what was racist and what was not. The US was trying to figure out how to be inclusive and honor differences and level the playing field. Obviously we still have work to do. 13/x
(The last tweet is really #11) Another tangent: I watched ‚ÄúThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman‚Äù twice when I was in elementary school. Both times, I had nightmares afterwards. Slavery wasn‚Äôt just a movie subject ‚Äî it was part of my family history. 12/x
Anyway. The black kids weren‚Äôt shocked. Our parents had been talking to us about racism and how to deal with it all of our lives. The non-black kids were shocked. But to have those flyers and stickers and other paraphernalia right in front of us ‚Äî primary sources, indeed. 10/x
YES THE ADMINISTRATORS AND OUR PARENTS KNEW AHEAD OF TIME 10/x
FF to 1982: @rjordan114 and I had a woke US history teacher in high school. One day, she put paper on the door window and swore our class to be quiet. She‚Äôd gone to the KKK bookstore in Pasadena to buy some examples of current-day racism for us to examine and discuss. 9/x
That slogan subconsciously told me that it would be ok to live in VA when my career brought me to DC ‚Äî even though I had colleagues who mocked my decision. Yeah, like Baltimore County is a bastion of ethnic harmony. 8/x
I vaguely recall the Holiday Inn campus was lovely, but I was much happier when we drove back to Memphis. So when I saw the ‚ÄúVA is for lovers‚Äù slogan later on the trip, I was reassured ‚Äî that love could and would overcome the irrational hate of racism. 7/x
We drove down just after dark. I was freaking out. I thought for sure that the Klan would jump out from the trees and attack our car. No such thing happened, but my parents had taught us about the KKK and Jim Crow and the impact of segregation on their own lives. 6/x
On that same trip, we went to Memphis to see Dad‚Äôs sister Aunt Cheryl. She worked for Holiday Inn, and the company‚Äôs global training center was just across the state line in Mississippi. She wanted us to visit, and off we went. 5/x
I didn‚Äôt talk about the slogan when I was 12, but it always struck me as hopeful. As a child whose existence was very much influenced by efforts to integrate, and to harmonize, and to remove barriers, this slogan was magic. 4/x
Story: In the summer of 1978, our family went on a road trip ‚Äî from Houston to Hartford. Dad made me the navigator. 		I remember seeing this slogan when we were in the DC area. I was mesmerized.		Twenty-two years later, I moved to northern VA. 3/x https://t.co/0WqRkq9v2n
What I find particularly offensive: All the people who say ‚Äú1984 was a long time ago.‚Äù It was 35 years ago. I was a young adult. Integration was a fact of life. If you were alive in 1984, you know you were supposed to know better.
In 1984, I was 18 years old, leaving for college. I grew up in Texas, at the western end of the former Confederacy. So, I know what‚Äôs racist.		Ralph Northam was 25, finishing med school and about to join the Army.  He was old enough to know better.		No excuses. Leave now.

@gilescoren Finally: In the US, women earn 2/3 of journalism/mass comms degrees, but only make up 1/3 of US newsrooms (all platforms). Very few stay long enough to become top bosses. Why? We're not all running off to have babies and mop floors. There's something wrong in the business. 5/
@gilescoren If you refuse a job because of the pay, there goes a line off your resume. You're now not as competitive as other people. That in turn harms your ability to both get hired AND get paid your worth down the road. It's a vicious cycle, and it's expensive.
@gilescoren Suggesting that people control their pay is fantasy. The people on the other side of the bargaining table control the the budgets and ultimately decide when the haggling is over. They can/do say "Take it or leave it." If you need to pay the rent,  you give up. 3/
@gilescoren In media (the business I know best), there is STILL this idea that men are "providers" and thus need to earn more than women. This happens even when the bigger "star" is the woman -- even when she has a top agent, even when she has other platforms.
@gilescoren Haggling hard doesn't mean you get what you want. I had a promotion offer pulled because I "wanted too much money." Then I found out the man finally hired for the same post earned what I wanted, even though his credentials/experience were less than mine. 1/
@gilescoren I agree with the first part of this tweet. As I am American and not British, I'm not able to judge the merits of Shearer/Robinson.

Things I do not like:	My dog barking loudly at 6am because the landlord across the hall hired people to start vacuuming the apartment. At 6am.

RT @mitchellreports: Our hearts are with President Bush, wishing him a speedy recovery https://t.co/pkM1xUb71c
@ABC7NY Not exactly. One other Republican was missing, so the vote was 10-10. Under Senate rules, that doesn't count as a "favorable vote." Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware changed his vote to "present," and that yielded the favorable committee vote.
Former US President George HW Bush is in intensive care at Houston Methodist Hospital, two days after burying his wife, Barbara
(Reporter breaks fourth wall: This is "statesmanlike" in that we all can go home at a reasonable hour and not have to wait until 11pm for senators to meet and vote again)
No word yet on when full Senate will take up Pompeo nomination
Before adjourning, Corker thanks Coons for "statesmanlike behavior"
Another roll count vote: 11 yes (one proxy), 9 no, 1 present (Coons) -- Pompeo confirmation reported out in "a positive manner" (Corker) -- committee hearing is over
Coons: I will change my vote from no to present in order to avoid reconvening at 11pm -- (says the earlier whip count meant there was going to be a different vote)
Menendez: Keep the vote until Isakson arrives tonight so he can vote on the calendar day 	Corker: That's fine with me -- I guess that's fine, we can vote tonight
Corker is asking if a Democratic senator would change his no vote to present so they don't have to wait until Isakson arrives late tonight and they can vote out the Pompeo nomination, also concerned about historic nature of sending out a negative vote
This is really happening
And now a five-minute break so people can consider what to do now
Someone says let's send the committee's view without recommendation; Risch says send up the actual vote tally with a unanimous consent and a caveat; Menendez worries about establishing a worrisomeprecedent
Corker now asking for a voice vote to get a positive recommendation for Pompeo; Menendez is objecting on parliamentary grounds
Pompeo confirmation vote is 11-10, but one yea vote is a proxy (Isakson), so the Foreign Relation s committee vote is 10-10 #staytuned
