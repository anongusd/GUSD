@shelbyBootights @EdKrassen Dems need not so much to be on the defensive, but to get their msg out about what they will do for Americans and how they will do it. And stay united.
@fominroman @EdKrassen Which will just make them look as stupid as they are.
@drmarjbeirut @EdKrassen But if, by chance, he DOES become the Dem nominee, we all MUST have a plan to unify against Trump at the polls on Nov. 3rd, 2020.	#DemUnityTwitterProject
@GalleryByHal @EdKrassen That is why I have decided that I will respect the Dem party's choice of Presidential candidate, NO MATTER WHO IT IS. Unity will save us from the @GOP and Trump. Let's make better better choices this time. Our #VOTE is our POWER.	#DemUnityTwitterProject #DemUnity
@EdKrassen I think that Americans are smarter than that. To help them, we need to be passing on tweets from the Dem candidates rather than from the @GOP. Don't tweet their propaganda. Tweet Dem msgs of truth and hope and unity.	#DemUnityTwitterProject

@whynotgoglobal @essenviews When this nightmare is over, forgiveness will be a healing force. I have no problem forgiving bad judgement. It's the racists who get me most angry. But there's hope for them, too. We can all be redeemed. And forgiveness is the key.
@essenviews Of course. We are all Americans. All patriots. Most are likely to admit, after Trump is ousted for crimes allegedly committed, that #45 was a big mistake. One we ALL made in 2016. They voted for him in gd faith. The rest of us underestimated his threat to our democracy. #Unity

@pursuedbytruth In the end, each of us can only speak for our own personal motivations and life circumstances. We can't know the heart of another, unless that person shares it with us. I was told by many good priests that they entered the priesthood at 12 yrs of age out of need. I believed them.
@pursuedbytruth I also went to an all women's private college. They are expensive. You either had a scholarship or your parents were well off. It may be hard for you to imagine someone who feels compelled to choose a vocation because it ALSO offers them free education, room and board, and a job.
@pursuedbytruth You are young enough to be able to disagree. I am 60 &amp; have cared for priests/nuns whose families saw the priesthood/convent as a way to educate &amp; feed a child. You have the luxury of not agreeing. Those generations did not. There were larger families and greater poverty then.

@JRehling She said nothing wrong. She spoke the sole truth. Lobbies have influence and it involves MONEY. No racial slur there. Yet she was railroaded into apologizing. Why? Because both Dems and the GOP are on the receiving end of those monies. How ironic! They have proved her point.

@Z_Indy @mkraju You missed nothing. She points out that there is a lobby that makes large contributions to politicians and sponsors yearly trips to Israel. Those are facts. They are a lobby like many others. She made no racial slurs. She stated fact.
@mnsports3 @mkraju No. It would be true.
@KyleLeith @mkraju Indeed!
@mkraju "The Council on American-Islamic Relations defended Omar and Tlaib in a statement on Monday. "Anti-Semitism is real. It should not be used disingenuously as a tool to silence legitimate criticism of a foreign nation's discriminatory policies." https://t.co/pmigiTBDZF
@mkraju "AIPAC, which spent about $3.5 million on lobbying efforts in 2018 according to OpenSecrets, sponsors an annual congressional trip to Israel."  So Rep. Omar is correct. AIPAC does lobby in favor of Israel. Why is it anti semitic if she states that fact?

@Ohdarkthirty1 @michelleinbklyn I think the guy is a huge anti Semite. A bigot is a bigot. He just goes where the wind blows and the money flows. Meanwhile he is pulling out of Syria leaving Israel vulnerable.
@Pcnason1 @boykenan @michelleinbklyn And frankly, Trump is creating a huge problem for Israel by pulling out of Syria and leaving the door open for Iran to get closer to her borders. They are already launching missiles into the Golan Hgts. Thankfully Israel is stopping them with anti missile technology.
@michelleinbklyn It's also possible to criticize Israel without being an anti Semite.

@CommonSenseEst @SteveScalise That is an inflexible definition. And a fearmongering attempt by the Right that does not recognize education and health care as human rights. Don't drink the Koolaid. Use your common sense for real.
@surveyfan @SteveScalise Learn more. It will make you a better person.
@CommonSenseEst @SteveScalise Scalise definitely does not know what socialism is. They use the word to frighten people, conjuring up visions of despots. In reality, socialism done right respects the human rights of ALL. It's enough to look at our European allies in Europe and in Canada. They got it right.
@MSNDeplorable @SteveScalise One word....Canada.
@pipkin56056003 @SteveScalise But really, I don't generally try to reason with bots.
@pipkin56056003 @SteveScalise Actually, I do live in a country that employs many socialist ideals in its education, health care and institutions. I love it here.
@Pete_L915 @SteveScalise Or Canada, Scandanavia, France, Germany, Italy, etc.....all places with a very high standard of living. Free health care, hospitalization and meds. The sicker you are, the more you are helped. Very humane. Health care is a human right, not a privilege.

@USATODAY He's being honest. My bf was raped by two black guys when I was in college so I understand. It just happened to be a black guy who raped his friend. What is wrong with saying so? Obviously, when he imagined revenge he imagined a black guy. Im getting really tired of this PC bull.
