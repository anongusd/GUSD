@GooGwaba @teapartytempest There is one Bible with many translations. Not many versions of the Bible. That question is a standard atheist/Leftist attack. You‚Äôre right that understanding and practice of scripture divides us. But the opposite is the Koran. No interpretation allowed.
@teapartytempest @GooGwaba Ok. Done with this conversation. What a ridiculous question.
@teapartytempest @GooGwaba This is just a clear example of how the Church has fallen away from scripture many times over the centuries. Leftists are still beating us over the head with the mistakes of a small group of bad people.
@teapartytempest @GooGwaba That‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs so important to follow the Bible as it‚Äôs written, as closely as possible.
@teapartytempest @GooGwaba That just further divides the Church as a whole. When a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù church goes liberal it hurts us all. It means they have switched sides in the battle of Good vs Evil. It is a spiritual and financial drain on the Kingdom of God.
@teapartytempest @GooGwaba That‚Äôs a good start, but they want into our churches. Ending marriage licenses won‚Äôt eliminate the Leftist agenda to destroy the nuclear family &amp; Christianity.
