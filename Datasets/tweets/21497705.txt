@zachdcarter I guess that's one of the (many) downfalls of this medium, but I was pointing to the fact that the supposed deal all of these tariffs on China was supposed to bring about is ultimately shaky at best and merely rhetoric that will dissolve into more retaliation at worst.

@zachdcarter Furthermore, such an approach would also not levy a tax on consumer goods along the way, which hurts the poorest members of society more than anyone else.
@zachdcarter That's a bit of an exaggeration of my comment.  That aside, if your focus is China, then you can work to challenge their policies by building a coalition of partners through something like the TPP.  It's far easier to force their hand as a coalition than it is via tariffs.
@zachdcarter That's not a Republican stance, either. Check out C. Donald Johnson's book, The Wealth of a Nation, for a good history of the bipartisan support for free trade through the history of the U.S.
@zachdcarter They're old, blunt tool that often makes the job you're trying to accomplish harder.
@zachdcarter I would argue they are inherently a less effective way (harm foreign relations, increase costs of consumers, hamper international supply chains) of achieving a goal (supporting an industry) than other, less disruptive means of industry support (tax policies, TAA, etc).

@snlester @BrexitCentral Dumping (with injury).  For clarity, do you mean U.S. anti-dumping law, the AD agreement, or all anti-dumping law in the world?
@snlester @BrexitCentral Interesting.  So, since it doesn't change the unfair practice, you would deem it frivolous, even if it (arguably) protects the domestic industry from the shock of the unfair practice?  And "some other way" would be multilateral measures or an FTA of sorts?
@snlester @BrexitCentral So are you saying 1) that China's bad practices don't include dumping 2) they may include dumping but the anti-dumping measures are done without any consideration of this behavior when they calculate their margins or 3) something else?
@snlester @BrexitCentral I've perused Cato's work on the subject (including that piece).  Any suggestions of the more recent pieces that might better account for China's entry into the WTO?  (currently have this open in another tab: https://t.co/Bam9FyqpLY, but open to other suggestions)
@realDonaldTrump lol
@snlester @BrexitCentral As for dumping, I'm a trade lawyer not an economist, so I won't pretend to be an expert on the underlying economic principles.  That being said, I'm skeptical of painting with such a broad brush.
@snlester @BrexitCentral I think that complication and uncertainty is why the UK shouldn't limit itself to one tool in the UK-EU trade relationship.
@snlester @BrexitCentral As for anti-dumping, I suppose it depends on how you define frivolous in this context.  I have a feeling this is more of a philosophical difference than a legal one.
@snlester @BrexitCentral I'll agree governments (at least the U.S., can't speak as much on others) should use multilateral remedies more than they do,  But again, that doesn't mean you completely eliminate the unilateral approach, either. 		"Might work" is key, there.
@BrexitCentral @snlester This would still be exponentially faster than the multilateral/WTO approach, but keep some flexibility to address real, substantive AD/CVD issues when they inevitably arise.
@BrexitCentral @snlester Maybe a middle ground? Complaints filed to an independent entity (something akin to the U.S. International Trade Commission), reviewed, and then the substantive claims passed on to the enforcement body?
@BrexitCentral @snlester The point is well taken, though.  There will be domestic political pressure for protective AD/CVD actions and some will certainly be without merit.  I'm just not sure the absence of AD/CVD enforcement from the UK-EU relationship is the best option.
@BrexitCentral @snlester Sure, it's more likely for the "real" AD/CVD issues to arise with a trading partner like China instead of the EU.  I think it's a touch naive or dishonest, though, to imply it won't really happen with the UK-EU trading relationship (or that it's mainly frivolous).
@BrexitCentral @snlester In cases where actual dumping or actual actionable/prohibited subsidies are in play, the harm and market distorting effects occur until the multilateral process is complete since the remedy can't be retroactive under the AD or SCM agreements.
@BrexitCentral @snlester Interesting read but the author seems to ignore the inherent benefit to unilateral AD/CVD measures as opposed to multilateral measures through the WTO - expediency.

@alanbeattie Of course we all know this "agreement" is nothing more than smoke and orange-tinted mirrors. Won't matter either way.
@alanbeattie See article 28 of Paris. Without full withdrawal from the UNFCCC before then, the US is still "in" and the EU can keep its promise.
@alanbeattie I'm not sure it matters in the current world we live in, but the U.S. is still party to Paris and can't begin the withdrawal process until 3 years after it entered into force for the U.S., then the withdrawal takes another year to go into effect (2020ish).

@TamarHaspel @WaPoFood I'll readily admit my idea might not be the best way, but I - like the activist in your article - think carrots are the right way to go both literally and figuratively.  Regardless, thank you for the engaging conversation.
@TamarHaspel @WaPoFood That's fair.  I just think that a Cass Sunstein-esque "nudge" might be a better way to do leverage the money than straight up limitations.  From other areas of public health, that seems to be the sweet spot for human dignity/health benefits.
@TamarHaspel @WaPoFood Either way, though, I think it's a good conversation to have and I'm glad you're doing it.
@TamarHaspel @WaPoFood I think doubling SNAP money on produce at all stores (not just farmers markets) without those narrow WIC restrictions could probably get more support in the left and actually change purchasing habits.
@TamarHaspel @WaPoFood I'm familiar with WIC and I think it's a good program, but it's pretty narrow on what qualifies. Certain brands of peanut butter but not others, etc... (at least when I was a cashier back in the day).
@TamarHaspel @WaPoFood I know the programs are out there, but do they currently cover fresh produce at regular grocery stores, as well?
@WaPoFood @TamarHaspel But I think that's about as far as we should go, if at all. I think even ignoring the choice/human dignity arguments against restriction, it gets too dicey categorizing "junk" and "not-junk" food outside of a categorical ban on soda/sugary drinks.
@WaPoFood @TamarHaspel That being said, cutting out soda/sugary drinks probably is not a bad idea.  You can't buy cigarettes, or alcohol with SNAP, and soda is looking more and more harmful.
@WaPoFood @TamarHaspel Maybe instead of imposing limits on already meager SNAP dollars, we encourage healthy eating by doubling SNAP dollars at farmers markets and fresh produce?  A nudge in the right direction instead of removing choice.

@NazaninBoniadi These treaties were certainly a step forward from the purely aspirational Universal Declaration, but sadly a treaty's status as "binding" only matters (at least in this regard) as much as its enforcement mechanism is effective.
@NazaninBoniadi Unfortunately, when we put together the ICCPR (and it sister treaty the ICESCR), we didn't include any real enforcement mechanism to encourage compliance.

@jtmachlin As do I. Pleasure having a civilized chat with you.
@jtmachlin but if you just want to argue, I'm not sure there's much point in continuing. I think we'll just simply have to agree to disagree
@jtmachlin Why are they terrible? Also, if this something you want to discuss in detail, maybe a different forum is better?
@jtmachlin http://t.co/ISl4QclOdZ  @nytimes has a great breakdown of who gave up what.  Better job than I can do in 140 characters.
@jtmachlin it's done by the IAEA, which the US has more say in as a member of the P5 than Iran does. Not selected by Iran, but by the UN.
@jtmachlin break out period substantially. If military action is necessary, there is now more time to respond accordingly, too.
@jtmachlin they didn't get everything they want and they gave up a significant amount of sovereignty in the deal, which increases the
@jtmachlin the United States. Sorry for the colloquial.
@jtmachlin by way of other US sanctions still in force and available AND the option of snap back.
@jtmachlin this is not giving lebensraum to Hitler or three page nuclear agreement with DPRK. We're not selling the shop and keeping teeth
@jtmachlin we don't need their trust, but it can be incredibly useful in keeping that region from blowing itself or anyone else up.
@jtmachlin the hostages do need to be returned. No argument there. But we will have access to the sites with inspectors, not just samples.
@jtmachlin... Any momentum the moderates may have and gives credence to the hardliner's claims that we/the US can't be trusted.
@jtmachlin but yeah, new leadership is definitely necessary to really resolve this. The deal puts momentum behind progress. Nixing it kills
@jtmachlin I wasn't calling him a hardliner, but saying that his actions were for the benefit of hardliners.
@jtmachlin yes, and the reduction can be used to determine how long ago things were moved. Or if it's in a new site, if it was there at all
@jtmachlin publicity for the hardliners. Doesn't mean the national sentiment follows.
@jtmachlin Also, there is access to the sites, not just soil samples. Additionally, there's permanent inspectors at most of the known sites.
@jtmachlin the department of energy and experts from MIT disagree. Radiation can't just be swept up.
@jtmachlin and time will tell, but I think you're overestimating the anti-American sentiment of Iran. Hardliners, yes. The rest, less so.
@jtmachlin... Any substantive nuclear development. Additionally, the radiation levels will remain high enough to indicate if some was moved.
@jtmachlin the mass celebrations in the street indicate otherwise. As for snap back, the 28 day delay in inspection isn't enough time for...
@jtmachlin...With the sanctions after an Iranian breach of the deal then maintaining the status quo in place of a deal. Would renew momentum
@jtmachlin and again, in case I'm dead wrong, we have snapback. There's also stronger motivation for the international community to keep...
@jtmachlin while it's no democracy, it's hard to rally behind "death to America" as you're eating a Big Mac and surfing your iPhone.
@jtmachlin if the bulk of Iranians care more about entering the international community, do you not see any chance that hatred dissipates?
@jtmachlin the lack of trust is why there is snapback in @TheIranDeal. Do you believe all Iranians are fanatics w/ no regard for life?
@jtmachlin @TheIranDeal Perhaps, and I can't pretend to know if there was a better solution then. But can we not do better today?
The horror of #Hiroshima is exactly why we need diplomatic solutions, like @TheIranDeal. Problem solving can happen without plutonium.
