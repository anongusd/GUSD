#SOTU 	Instead of delivering on the issues that Americans care about, Donald Trump and his administration have been hard at work furthering their racist, backward agenda by attacking women, immigrants, LGBT, Muslims, and people of color.
#SOTU A defining theme of Trump‚Äôs first year in office has been his insatiable desire to enrich the wealthy and big corporations at the expense of working Americans.
#SOTU Trump Republicans have sparked a state of crisis, chaos, and racism in our union. The cruelty of the Trump Administration knows no bounds.
