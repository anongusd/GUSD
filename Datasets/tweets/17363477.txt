NEW STUDY - Too much of a good thing? New study show overtreating patients for hypothyroidism could raise risk of stroke. #HeartInstitute #AHA18 https://t.co/mn9xcoZnsR
For those that went on to angiography, individual vessel CAC score was associated w/ the level of stenosis in that vessel. CAC burden was observed to be greatest in the LAD, followed by RCA, then LCX, and lastly LM. (4/4) #AHA18 https://t.co/jYtk38mrZH
Across the entire range of CAC scores, both overall &amp; single vessel CAC scores obtained during cardiac PET/CT are predictive of 1-year MACE. The per vessel CAC score did not add prognostic information beyond the overall CAC score for MACE. (3/4) @VietHeartPA #AHA18 https://t.co/MPhl8Gl1X9
We sought to determine if the prognostic value of single vessel CAC score was more predictive of MACE than the total CAC score when assessed during cardiac PET/CT. (2/4) @VietHeartPA #AHA18
Research Poster: Elevated overall CAC scores identify symptomatic patients at risk for MACE. However, it is unclear whether a vessel specific assessment may better identify those at risk of MACE in these patients compared to a total CAC score. (1/4) @VietHeartPA #AHA18 https://t.co/0Ix2mN9CHN
The high probability of MACE even among those with a low risk assessment suggests an aggressive approach to surveillance, preventive/medical therapies, and interventions when indicated. (5/5) #AHA18 #HeartInstitute https://t.co/p6UllquK2l
This study demonstrates functional PET/CT testing provides substantial improvement in CV risk stratification even in patients with extreme CAC scores. However, it also confirms this patient group as a whole is at high risk. (4/5) #AHA18 https://t.co/3I9vwgwyLn
Coronary artery calcium scores (CAC) indicate atherosclerosis burden and predict future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). (3/5) #AHA18 #HeartInstitute
When patients present with anginal symptoms, functional stress testing is often used to detect myocardial ischemia &amp; guide treatment. However, because testing is not perfect, patients with high prior probabilities of disease may not benefit from it. (2/5) #AHA18 #HeartInstitute

However, by quantitatively integrating these into a multivariable risk model, high-cost patients may be pre-identified, so they can be selected to receive special attention. (6/6) #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 https://t.co/HAaiGbtDlL
A small (&lt;5%) population of patients diagnosed with ASCVD have more than 27 times as much average annual per month cost, and more than 4 times as much over long-term follow-up, than the remaining 95%. (5/6) #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 #HeartInstitute
The strongest multivariable predictors of high-cost included age, a PAD diagnosis, diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, COPD, and malignancy. (3/6) #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 #HeartInstitute
Although many patients are diagnosed with ASCVD, only a small % of them are responsible for most of the costs. If we could predict which patients are expected to cost the most, targeted approaches could be developed. (2/6) #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 #HeartInstitute
Atherosclerotic disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality and healthcare expenditures. Annual indirect and direct costs of ASCVD are estimated to be $330 billion. #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 (1/5) https://t.co/olerr9pDW0

Despite significant advances in the treatment of CAD, more than one quarter of newly diagnosed CAD patients still experience another major adverse cardiovascular event, indicating greater early prevention needed. #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 #HeartInstitute (4/4)
Over the past 15 years, PCI has become the major initial treatment strategy for first time CAD patients. The need for repeat PCI or CABG after initial PCI has dropped by nearly 50% during time period. #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 #HeartInstitute (3/4)
Patients were followed for 5 years for the future outcomes of PCI, CABG, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and death according to time periods of enrollment. #TheImpresStudy #AHA18 #HeartInstitute (2/4) https://t.co/la1g13ygCe

The benefit accruing from statin therapy did not differ according to CAC scores, but did differ based on PET/CT risk conclusion. More research is needed to fully understand the interaction between statin therapy and CAC. (5/5) #AHA18 https://t.co/D8xjbyOsgY
However, a higher CAC score was associated with an increased risk of MACE &amp; there was a trend of benefit from use of statin. The benefit of statin use for decreased MACE events was significant in those patients at medium/high risk based on PET/CT results. (4/5) #AHA18
The interaction between statin therapy and CAC score with regards to MACE is unclear in a primary prevention population presenting with symptoms suspicious for CAD. (3/5) #AHA18
The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a powerful predictor of MACE in patients without clinical coronary artery disease (CAD). (2/5) #AHA18 #HeartInstitute https://t.co/h31xflBOfN

.@Intermountain, alongside our partners will operate two demonstration programs ‚Äì one in @OgdenCityUtah, and one in St. George (@STGnews). Over the next 3 years these programs will be evaluated to see the impact on health. Possible expansion thereafter. #UTADH #SDoH
