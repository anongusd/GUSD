It’s tempting to say “Mission Accomplished,” but that implies that our work is done. It’s not.	So I prefer to say, “Mission Still Being Accomplished,” and I invite all Members of Congress, to join us in a mission to make a better America.
Their mission – one that continues today – was to care for veterans, provide patriotic youth programs, advocate for a strong national defense and instill pride about what it means to be American. It’s not just what The American Legion did,  it’s what we do.
In 16 days, The American Legion will officially turn 100 years old. You have heard me discuss “mission” quite a bit this morning. That’s because the founders of our organization had a post-War mission.
The  veterans that the LEGION Act will recognize, have carried out their missions. Now, it's our turn.
We sincerely thank @SenatorSinema for making this the first bill she introduced as a member of the United States Senate. We also thank @SenThomTillis  for joining Sen. Sinema in introducing this bi-partisan legislation.
Congress can provide this recognition by supporting and passing Senate bill 504, or, the LEGION Act. The LEGION Act will authorize The American Legion to expand our membership eligibility requirements.
Because of these frequent engagements, we call on Congress to declare what has DEMONSTRABLY already occurred: the US has been continuously engaged in a state of war from Dec. 7, 1941 until such a date in the future that our gov't may declare an end to all armed hostilities.
However, these recognized periods fail to take into account the hostilities that occur between official war eras, in which nearly 1,600 U.S. military personnel were killed or wounded. In places like Cuba, Iran and El Salvador.
Subsequently, our charter and membership eligibility have mirrored the eras officially recognized by the U.S. government to include the wars and conflicts such as Korea, Vietnam, and the Global War on Terror.
The thinking at the time was that World War One was so horrendous, that it was “the war to end all wars.” As we all know, history proved that it wasn’t. Even so, our charter was updated during World War 2 to reflect the service and sacrifice of that era.
And there is another area of equality that The American Legion would like to see addressed. A century ago, our organization was chartered by Congress to serve as the leading voice for veterans of  “the Great War.”
The Legion has always believed a veteran is a veteran. Our gratitude for their service shouldn't be measured by arbitrary dates, but rather by the simple fact that they swore an oath to defend our nation. It is time loved ones who provide care for their veterans achieve equality.
Regardless of when a veteran served – even if it was during a period of peace – caregivers still face the same challenges. They sacrifice career, time with others, and often, their own health care needs to care for their loved one.
We welcome the recent expansion of the VA Family Caregiver program to equalize benefits so that family members providing care for Vietnam and other veterans are on par with those who provide it for members of the post-9/11 generation. However, gaps still exist.
To varying degrees, anyone who has personally assisted a close family member through sickness or serious medical conditions understands the challenges facing caregivers. I know. I, too, have experienced this.
The central fact remains that nobody understands the unique health care needs of the veteran population better than the professionals at the VA. Further, the VA Mission Act must live-up to its mission of serving veterans, as opposed to serving private health care providers.
Moreover, we agree that #veterans should not have to wait more than 20 days for primary care or 28 days for specialty care. The American Legion does NOT oppose Choice. But, we adamantly oppose any plan that would gut the best health care system in the country.
But we do recognize that geography &amp; specialty care sometimes means VA is not always the best option for patients. We support the administration’s recent announcement that access to veterans’ healthcare providers should be based on actual “drive-times” not “straight-line mileage”
In 2017, The American Legion commissioned a report that confirmed what we already suspected—VA performs as well or better than its private-sector counterparts in areas such as patient safety, patient satisfaction, care coordination and innovative medical practices.
It must be the mission of every Legionnaire, every veteran, every employee of the DOD and VA – and, I might add, every member of Congress – to stop such national tragedies. Simply put, access to timely treatment and quality health care saves lives.
We also know that #PTSD, #TBI and feelings of a loss of purpose or belonging are frequently found among those who attempt such tragic and permanent endings. These feelings and conditions are either preventable or treatable.
In 2017, the VA reported that the #suicide rate among 18- to 24-year-old male Iraq or Afghanistan US war #veterans had risen five-fold. For 18-to-29-year-old female veterans, the suicide rate doubled.
President Lincoln referred to this loss as "so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom." And perhaps nothing is more important than preventing the number of Gold Star families from growing. That said, not all of America’s war casualties come from enemy bullets.
There are many constituencies that deserve our support, but none more so than Gold Star Families. I am proud to announce that The American Legion has recently created a fulltime staff position dedicated to advocating for the needs of these families whose loss is immeasurable.
From an epidemic of opioids, to criminal gang activity and domestic terrorism, the life of a law enforcement officer is fraught with danger. We ask Congress to always consider how legislation impacts members of these special communities.
It is not surprising that many military veterans continue to serve their country thru careers in law enforcement. Service before self, even to the point of sacrificing ones’ life if necessary, is just 1 of the many commonalities shared between military members &amp; 1st responders.
Another special population that takes its mission seriously is our nation’s law enforcement officers. Last year, 150 of these heroes died in the line-of-duty, protecting &amp; serving our communities.
This is where we hope Congress &amp; the administration can live up to its constitutionally-mandated mission to support our military. Whether it’s thru the “Pay Our Coast Guard Act” or advanced appropriations for Coast Guard payroll, we should all abide by the motto “always prepared"
The American Legion did not fall short of our mission in January when – in just a 2-week period, we provided more than $1 million of financial assistance to Coast Guard families with young children. It is times like this, when it is not about what we did, but rather what we do.
Yet, they were treated differently than their DoD counterparts.  Pay uncertainty is difficult for everyone impacted, but especially those, who – by contract – are required to continue working and risking their lives in an occupation that provides, at best, modest pay.
It is synonymous with being a #veteran. We have seen this clearly demonstrated by the men and women of the Coast Guard, who despite a stoppage of pay, continued to deploy more than 2,000 members a day, at sea and ashore.
Let me tell you about our mission. Mission is a word that we take very seriously – something that has been forged into us since our first day of military basic training. It is an inner fortitude that tells us that no matter what it takes, we will accomplish the task at hand.

We especially thank Senator Sinema for making the LEGION Act, the first legislation that she has introduced as a newly elected U.S. senator. #WashConf2019
The men and women who served during these eras swore the same oath taken by those who served during the officially-recognized war eras. These veterans deserve to be welcomed into our organization as Legionnaires.
Nearly 1,600 American servicemembers have been killed or wounded while serving in hostile conflicts in periods not recognized by the U.S. government since the end of World War Two.
(THREAD) Natl Cmdr Reistad: @SenatorSinema &amp; Sen. @ThomTillis have introduced Senate Bill 504, the Let Everyone Get Involved in Opportunities for National Service Act – also called the LEGION Act. This is a simple matter of fairness. https://t.co/2ydWvDM3yL
And, as you can see from our legislative priorities, we also include “care for HER who shall have borne the battle,” in our commitment to advocate for ALL veterans. #WashConf2019
It is VA that should take the lead in running the Choice program to ensure that the VA Mission Act truly lives up to President Lincoln’s promise to “care for him who shall have borne that battle…”
(THREAD) Natl Cmdr Reistad: While we  recognize that VA is not always the best choice for all #veterans, nobody understands the unique health care needs of the veterans population better than the professionals at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Reistad is also calling on bill collectors to offer flexibility. “Due dates should be extended until the Coast Guard is paid and interests and late fees should be waived. We are hoping that the private sector, as well as public utility companies, all step up.”
"The American Legion has already awarded almost $700,000 in nonrepayable grants to junior ranking Coast Guard families in need. There are hundreds of additional requests already in the pipeline which The American Legion is trying to grant, but we have a very limited budget."
"First, demand Congress immediately pass and the president sign a clean version of the Pay Our Coast Guard Act, H.R. 367. Second, help The American Legion support Coast Guard families in need by donating to The American Legion Veterans and Children Foundation.

Let us remember - and never forget their sacrifice.	May God forever watch over them and protect them and their families.  #POWMIARecognitionDay
The American flag reminds us that many of them may never return - and have paid the supreme sacrifice to insure our freedom.	Let us pray to the Supreme Commander that all of our comrades will soon be back within our ranks.
The chair is empty. They are NOT here. The candle is reminiscent of the light of hope, which lives in our hearts to illuminate their way home, away from their captors, to the open arms of a grateful nation.
The salt sprinkled on the plate reminds us of the countless fallen tears of families as they wait.	The glass is inverted, they cannot toast with us at this time.
The red ribbon on the vase represents an unyielding determination for a proper accounting of our comrades who are not among us.	A slice of lemon on the plate reminds us of their bitter fate.
The single rose in the vase signifies the blood they may have shed in sacrifice to ensure the freedom of our beloved United States of America. This rose also reminds us of the family and friends of our missing comrades who keep faith, while awaiting their return.
The tablecloth is white, symbolic of the purity of their intentions to respond to their Country’s call to arms.
They are unable to be with their loved ones and families, so we join together to pay humble tribute to them, and to bear witness to their continued absence.	The table is small, symbolizing the frailty of one prisoner, alone against his or her suppressors.
(THREAD) We call your attention to this small table which occupies a place of dignity and honor. It is set for one, symbolizing the fact that members of our armed forces are missing from our ranks. They are referred to as #POWs and #MIAs. We call them comrades. https://t.co/KzeKGkC1xQ
As part of this commitment, the Legion encourages a return of living POWs, repatriation of the remains of the fallen from war zones abroad, or a determination through convincing evidence that neither is possible.
The American Legion remains committed to achieving a full accounting of all U.S. servicemembers from all war eras who are either imprisoned or listed as missing in action.
