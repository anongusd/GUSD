@wcecsc81 @awwadsalotaibi @SpunkyTrucker @glennbeck No laws are being broken and nothing was stolen. This is good for Saudi Arabia, which is why we have repeatedly thanked the Saudis for preserving the sites.
@jonochall thank you!
@Rev1Eight @glennbeck It‚Äôs new footage and presentation, as well as some new information. Big problem we have long had is the lack of available photos and videos, so the theory never got the attention it deserved.

@Gamer_1745 @glennbeck @theblaze @BlazeTV @scrowder @benshapiro @marklevinshow @SteveDeaceShow @ericbolling Yup, some have suggested this other volcanic mountain in Saudi Arabia but there's no evidence there. More importantly, it doesn't fit the story. How would the Israelites camp in lava?
@cod_piece @WorldOfStu You don't need it for this. It's simply following geography, historical sources and comparing what you see in front of you to the Book of Exodus.

@AZMIAakaMIA @MurphyBrandy @travisbarker ‚ÄúHouse Muslim pawns‚Äù - suggesting Muslims who disagree with you are part of anti-Muslim conspiracies &amp; not legitimate Muslims is behavior to be expected from ayatollahs, not self-proclaimed progressives.

@newfoundmass @davidbix @ttg4444 Neither is the Afghan Taliban. Hizbul Mujahideen wasn‚Äôt designated until last summer, etc. Part of the rationale could be that MOA is seen primary as a domestic group, which changes things.
@newfoundmass @davidbix @ttg4444 That‚Äôs a copy of Sheikh Gilani‚Äôs book explicitly referring to his group as Fuqra. The same Gilani that MOA/TMOA openly follows. https://t.co/cD0paDigc8
@newfoundmass @davidbix @ttg4444 Wrong. There‚Äôs literally videos and newspapers and other documents published by MOA where they called themselves Jamaat ul-Fuqra. Every declassified government document identifies MOA as Fuqra.
@newfoundmass @davidbix @ttg4444 @TMOAmerica Sheikh Gilani isn‚Äôt allowed into the United States because of his terrorist connections.
@dyan_rickhout @LucGibson @MrWonderful1993 @DanyAllstar15 https://t.co/x4i6fn1uNa is comprehensive but the book that first broke the story about Ali Abdelaziz is named ‚ÄúTwilight in America.‚Äù I remember when the author of the book called me after Ali Abdelaziz left him a message looking to talk in 2010.
@AZMIAakaMIA @MurphyBrandy @travisbarker Wrong. A dozen Muslim groups called for a review of designating Fuqra as a terrorist group. The organization behind https://t.co/x4i6fn1uNa has Muslims on its advisory board. Fuqra, the group Ali Abdelaziz was in, targeted Muslims.
@Kyle_Skott @sh4rksh4d0w @Real_Astro_713 @ReggieShutUp @BrendanSchaub I‚Äôve got some more coming on this story so stay tuned.
@ALEC36543882 @JamesOC09392973 @IrishSoldga @SurfsUp_85 @TonyBellew @dc_mma @Deano_22_ Firstly, that‚Äôs not true that we are part of some Zionist conspiracy. Second, you are ignoring solid documentation including pictures, Fuqra/MOA‚Äôs own published words, Ali‚Äôs own published words, etc. Stop exploiting Islamophobia to encourage ignorance.
@MMAMORE123 @SinIronheart757 Most informants are criminals, so this kind of arrangement is common. You usually need criminals to spy on criminals, so you make a plea deal with them.
@YASH385 @PannaExpress @colton_wall No, it‚Äôs not. You didn‚Äôt read the list of sources described in the opening of the article. Or look at the pictures.
@Robert_OC_ @patmantackle @shane_riordan @akell0828 Not enough to accuse him of involvement, that‚Äôs for sure. But, in fairness, it is VERY weird. There were follow-up attacks to 9/11 planned and Al-Qaeda worked hard to falsify documents for travel, including working with non-AQ members.
@gooch_love @rbernard_11 @samefc88 @RilwanLucas @CptBlackCaesar It‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve talked a lot of current/former members of the Fuqra jihadist cult that Ali Abdelaziz was a part of.

@5MrClutch @LazyMoe1 @Alexiaxo_xo @PostableLtd @easily_bruised @TheNotoriousMMA The big question now is why he was failing the polygraph and what went on in Egypt just prior.
@rbernard_11 @superumario @RilwanLucas @CptBlackCaesar I‚Äôve studied Fuqra since 2003 and regularly talk with current and former members, some of which knew Ali. Also talk regularly to counter-terrorism personnel involved in investigating Fuqra and aware of some of Ali‚Äôs work.

@DBMignery How many great candidates will be willing if they believe they‚Äôll ultimately be rejected after facing nationwide scorn, embarrassment and destruction of reputation? It‚Äôs a major problem if we act too harshly based on allegations with inadequate evidence.
@DBMignery You‚Äôre making logical points, but a better comparison would be a situation where the employer and any job applicant is hated by half the country. If the employer cannot hire any applicant who is accused of something, then he will have no employees and few applicants.
