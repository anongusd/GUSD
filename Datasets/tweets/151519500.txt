Military veterans are paying the price created by this #GovernmentShutdown. Veterans have already sacrificed enough for our country, they shouldn‚Äôt be made to suffer because of a disagreement over a #BorderWall @AFGENational @AFLCIO @NATCA
@USOPM @DeptVetAffairs The #GovernmentShutdown isn‚Äôt just harming our national security, it‚Äôs hurting our country‚Äôs veterans. Roughly 1/3 of the 800,000 federal employees working without pay are #veterans. https://t.co/aLwlTYhdDb #ShutdownStories
According to @USOPM 155,000 veterans have been impacted by the #governmentshutdown. 50,000 of them have a @DeptVetAffairs disability rating. #ShutdownStories

Serving as Chairman of the @VetAffairsDems will be the honor of my lifetime. I look forward to working closely with our veterans, veterans service organizations, &amp; members on both sides of the aisle &amp; in both chambers to serve &amp; improve the lives of veterans across the country.
I look forward to working alongside my colleagues to further reject ideological agendas, &amp; continue placing our service to veterans above ourselves. We must fulfill our promises to our nation's veterans!
Our commitment to bipartisanship has helped protect VA whistleblowers &amp; student veterans, expand earned benefits, and improve access to care.
As Chairman Of @VetAffairsDems I will work to develop a #VA2030 plan that equips VA with the tools needed to meet these challenges head-on, guaranteeing its success now and into the future.
Today‚Äôs #veterans population is more diverse than ever before, a testament to the shifting demographic strength of our nation‚Äôs servicemembers. With these changes will come a new set of challenges for VA.
This #116thCongress, we have an incredible opportunity to build on @VetAffairsDems work to guarantee veterans access to high-quality, timely care &amp; the benefits they deserve.

W/out qualified leaders, it's likely VA will waste precious resources and the #VAMISSIONAct could end up like the current Choice Program, where veterans still wait months to receive care and have difficulty navigating the programs complex requirements. https://t.co/50aPSkmEbt
.@realdonaldtrump has failed to fill the VA leadership positions in charge of implementing the #VAMISSIONAct. Not only has VA lacked a permanent VA Secretary for months, they also lack a permanent Under Secretary for Health and a Deputy Under Secretary for Community Care.
This means programs investing in VA infrastructure, veteran care, suicide prevention, medical research, and more could face cuts in order to pay for care in the community under this new plan. This paints a stark picture of a VA forced to cannibalize itself to pay for private care
Despite @POTUS's claims, we are far from getting VA community care right for veterans. The #VAMISSIONAct lacks a sustainable source of funding, and unless something is done, existing VA programs and initiatives will be cut in order to pay for private care. https://t.co/zfTtvYWOf9

We stand with 83% of #veterans &amp; caregivers who support legalizing #medicalcannabis nationally. This move by @DeptVetAffairs is a commonsense step forward, but our next step needs to be more VA research. https://t.co/YCAqvNaNb1
8/ That is why @SecShulkin must provide a detailed plan to Congress &amp; the #veteran community about how exactly this executive order will be implemented &amp; paid for without delay.
7/ According to @RANDCorporation, private providers are much less able to provide high-quality mental healthcare to #veterans than their VA counterparts. Less than 18% of TRICARE affiliates &amp; less than 6% of other non-VA providers were ready to deliver high-quality care to vets.
6/ Time &amp; again studies have shown that #veterans who use @DeptVetAffairs mental healthcare are considerably less likely to take their own lives than those who do not.
5/ .@POTUS‚Äôs executive order should not be seen as an opportunity to push even more #veterans services &amp; programs into the private sector. To outsource critical mental health services from @DeptVetAffairs &amp; into the private sector would be a catastrophic mistake.
4/ The fact @RealDonaldTrump, @SecShulkin, @WhiteHouse, @DeptVetAffairs did not provide any details whatsoever to Congress or engage w/ #veterans in the community until the day of the executive order is problematic &amp; raises many questions.
3/ However, the devil is in the details, and we have to make sure we get this process right so it works for all #veterans &amp; transitioning servicemembers.
2/ That is why, since the day @RepTimWalz arrived in Congress, he has fiercely advocated for increased coordination between @DeptofDefense &amp; @DeptVetAffairs to improve healthcare for servicemembers &amp; #veterans.
1/ There will always be more our country can do to improve the lives of #veterans &amp; servicemembers transitioning from military to civilian life. @VetAffairsDems will applaud any move that accomplishes that. https://t.co/cY5zmidi9R

Not only do @realDonaldTrump's claims on #veterans fall short of reality, but it is virtually impossible for him to uphold the promises he made on the campaign trail when he prioritizes #GOPTaxScam tax cuts for billionaires over the needs of #veterans. https://t.co/mLgesF5Soq
Caring for fallen servicemembers &amp; the loved ones they leave behind is a #bipartisan issue. We cannot allow ourselves to fall victim to outrage politics that forces us to focus on what divides us. Instead, we must focus on what unites us. https://t.co/8sNIDkwoWW
The loved ones of fallen servicemembers have made sacrifices most Americans cannot begin to imagine or understand. These selfless men &amp; women deserve our deepest gratitude &amp; respect, &amp; shouldn‚Äôt be used to advance a political agenda. https://t.co/XIVQHe67Xb
We've heard the stories of #veterans who have used #MedicalCannabis to help them cope w/ injuries of war. Sessions' rollback of commonsense #cannabis policies puts vets lives at risk &amp; shows how far out of line @GOP's priorities are w/ the American people. https://t.co/AlaZucDdLV

.@TheJusticeDepartment‚Äôs decision is disappointing, because it will further facilitate the extremely dangerous &amp; misguided practice of overprescribing opioids, a practice that overwhelmingly hurts #veterans, especially those who suffer from a service connected injury.
That is why @RepTimWalz &amp; other @HouseDemocrats sent a letter in November urging @DeptVetAffairs to conduct research into #MedicalCannabis as an alternative to opioids when treating #veterans suffering from #PTSD &amp; #ChronicPain. https://t.co/EM0COHPj8I
.@TheJusticeDepartment‚Äôs decision is not just backwards, it is dangerous &amp; contrary to the health of #veterans. In fact, according to @AmericanLegion, over 90% of #veterans surveyed agreed that @DeptVetAffairs should be researching #medicalcannabis. https://t.co/r0Hw1XBcst
Unfortunately, @DeptVetAffairs decision was made shortly before @TheJusticeDept announced a crackdown on states who make medical cannabis accessible to those who need it. Often, those who do are #veterans. https://t.co/6jYDwXjVEn
This is a commonsense step forward, however it is a decision @DeptVetAffairs should have made a long time ago. https://t.co/UXWgQ9LRbY

An outright repeal of #ACA would be an indefensible mistake &amp; would devastate hundreds of thousands if not millions of #veterans https://t.co/R17QBaFzn6
When a #veteran doesn‚Äôt have a service connected injury or has an #OTH discharge, they may not be qualified for care @DeptVetAffairs (6/6)
However, @ConcernedVets isn‚Äôt even correct, as many rural and urban #vets don't have access to @DeptVetAffairs healthcare facilities (5/6)
Very interesting since @ConcernedVets actively tries to undermine @DeptVetAffairs and VA care at every turn #FundedByKochBrothers (4/6)
.@ConcernedVets supports stripping #Medicaid from hundreds of thousands of #vets because, as they say, vets can always fall back on VA (3/6)
#TrumpCare also threatens &gt; 5 million rural #vets, where health care facilities rely on Medicaid to keep doors open (2/6)
#Veterans should be concerned about the @GOP health bill. If passed 496,500 vets could lose #Medicaid coverage https://t.co/7vV7TKn6bx (1/6)

#TrumpCare will be devastating for our #veterans. According to analysis by @amprog, 459,500 #vets would lose #Medicaid coverage under #BCRA. https://t.co/hfiMk8sWUx
RT @repjoecrowley: FACT: 1.75 million of our nation's veterans count on Medicaid for affordable, quality health care. #ProtectOurCare https‚Ä¶
Cutting access to critical healthcare services like Medicaid is a grave injustice and an insult to the service of our 22 million #veterans
While #veterans losing access to Medicaid could fall back on VA, their spouses &amp; children would be left w/out access to any affordable care
Many #veterans could lose Medicaid access &amp; potentially be forced to seek care at VA, causing a massive influx of new patients #TrumpCare
According to data from the 2015 American Community Survey, 1.75 million veterans rely on Medicaid; that is nearly 1 in 10 veterans.
Despite @realDonaldTrump's repeated promise to protect Medicaid, the dangerous @GOP healthcare bill imposes unprecedented cuts to Medicaid. https://t.co/ths4zZRUNt
