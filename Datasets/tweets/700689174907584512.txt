@EricLevitz Not only at his job; at being a human being. How does he manage to breathe unassisted?
@graviolis @BenSasse Younger people either don't have the time/money for a license or it's not a priority/necessity to have one.
@graviolis @BenSasse Driving in Germany is intense. One hour on the Autobahn at 110 - 120 mph is exhausting, but the road quality is far superior to any country I've visited.
@graviolis @BenSasse It's something, all right. Two written tests, a theoretical one and a practical one, and a road test. The driving school requirement includes 37 hours of class/drive time &amp; 8 hours of BLS (first aid) training.
@SenatorZero @BenSasse Exactly. The U.S. was not/is not designed to foster connectedness.
@mdcohen @BenSasse Yes. It's been like that for forever. But younger people see ride-sharing and public transport as more desirable. Kind of a shift in priorities.
@BenSasse Well, it's expensive to get a license in Germany, the driver's test is really difficult, and the minimum driving age is 18 for an unrestricted license.
@Acosta He's waiting for just one guilty verdict.
@pemalevy Since GOP rolls like that, there need to be voter caravans set up. Load up your cars, minivans, SUVs, pickup trucks, buses, whatever else with voters and rain down on the two voting locations. Start making plans today, if you haven't already.

@Poynter Snopes can't fact-check itself
@meganliberman @CahnEmily Will there be "Doctor Trials" ala Nürnberg?
@dwnews 🔥🔥🔥
@NormOrnstein Secret Service allows random rich maralago club members to travel on AF1?
Offers some very valid points. 		Santos could be Colombia’s best president ever (duélale a quien le duela) https://t.co/DkecZcMmrY
@ShaunKing So, so, so sorry this happened to you. Americans have lost their way.
@JoeNBC Sticks to the only thing he knows how to do.

@StefaniaFOX10 Makes me so angry I could spit fire. 😡🔥
@BryanSchatz It's coming along nicely. I applaud you. If it were me, I would've slapped up the cheapest yurt I could find and leave it at that.
@SopanDeb Have done that, too. And have gotten time zones mixed up.
I ❤️this so much!! https://t.co/rgN9Vo7R7c
@KaraScannell @kpolantz Zippity Do-Da!

@BrendanNyhan wow
@nypost Just go to Lowes and get a Tuff Shed. Or get more frugal and set up a camping tent.
@ParkerMolloy @Schwarzenegger Good work, Booster!
@MyBeachChair @FLGovScott @adamputnam So gross --- and unnecessary.

@ryanjreilly Along with the betting pools.
@allyjarmanning @IRE_NICAR Fantastic idea! Thx.
@DeadlineWH @KenDilanianNBC @NicolleDWallace T.S. Ellis or T.S. Eliot?
@PhilippeReines I dare all WH press poolers to take a drink for each lie ... doesn't have to be booze ... could even be an empty cup.
@JesseCharlesLee @SenatorCollins @SenatorCollins is nothing but a fraud and a liar. She needs to be retired.
@JessicaHuseman @HunterMw @BryanLowry3 @BlakePater And Kansans will elect him governor. All very predictable.

@AGBecerra @realDonaldTrump Maybe the U.S. should stop creating refugees; it's worth a try.
@crk_flyer40 @CraxyD @miri_iron @ICEgov Agree.
@anniekarni @nancook Achieving world peace was too hard.
@rachelweinerwp @Fahrenthold Omfg.
@KenDilanianNBC Their pathologies force them to truly and passionately believe all the lies.
@dwnews Don't forget sweating in the train saunas.
@igorbobic Checks, she meant checks.
@kaitlancollins Need photo ID to buy four fried chickens and a Coke?? Say it ain't so!
@Dragonfly626 @ICEgov Here is a fair article 		https://t.co/LpfiDBLUvy
@oaksbenny @RCSTINGA @TheOcculty @AdamWalkerNS @ICEgov All of it justifies outrage. Incarcerating infants &amp; children, forcing infants &amp; children to plea their own cases in courts, the forced drugging, sexual &amp; nonsexual assaults, putting up these stolen children for "adoption" like pound puppies. ALL OF IT. Deaths aren't "needed."
@NBCNewsTech Or better: Delete account, uninstall and never look back.
@CillizzaCNN Because that's the natural response of GOPers to perceived unfairness.
@HappensSan @miri_iron @CraxyD @ICEgov Clearly, you don't do Travelocity. Too bad.
@3Prophylaxis @rosstrich @thebenbond @karidoll14 @AdamWalkerNS @RCSTINGA @oaksbenny @ICEgov Well, good luck with that. But please, don't hurt human beings in the process. A god created them just as it created you. And remember, someday, *you* might be a refugee, or your children or grandchildren might be.
@fakedansavage A remote controlled camera would be sufficient. Just go in, set up the gear, and leave. If there is a kernel of truth, you can air the 1-second clip.
@3Prophylaxis @rosstrich @thebenbond @karidoll14 @AdamWalkerNS @RCSTINGA @oaksbenny @ICEgov Take it up with their employers, including Donald.
@rosstrich @thebenbond @3Prophylaxis @karidoll14 @AdamWalkerNS @RCSTINGA @oaksbenny @ICEgov If you refuse to help others, at least don't hurt them.
@LeeGalliway @ICEgov 😂😂😂😂
@MikeDorning @BenjaminHarvey @bpolitics cc @SecPompeo Surprise!
@realDonaldTrump Learn to spell.
@rolandscahill And Charlie Manson
@mattmfm She's just the average GOP liar.
@matthewamiller Watching Donald's psyche breaking on the world stage is quite something ... would be entertaining if it weren't so tragic.
@CahnEmily Watching Donald's psyche breaking on the world stage is  ... quite something to behold.
@NPR Been saying that for months, but people don't get it.
@AliABCNews @pnhoward Patience is a virtue.
@LOLGOP @emptywheel GOP can't "win" without cheating and foreign government intervention.
@JoeNBC Cowards. Mainly because they only way they can "win" is by having foreign governments intervene.
