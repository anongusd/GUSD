Think calm thoughts. Think sailing.
@danielle8483 @mariannegallowa I need to get a cat!  This sounds waaay too entertaining.
@mariannegallowa He will never leave. A nuclear bomb could go off in your neighborhood and Oberon would still be there.
The kid playing Oliver just made me cry. He is amazing!!!
@Summerina37 Glad to know its not just me today!
@danielle8483 My job seems to be equal parts beauty shop, fast food joint, and strip club. I can't believe the stuff people wear to work.
@danielle8483 Guy in front of me gave himself a full on manicure the other day. Cuticle trimming, nail clipping, filing, buffing. #gross
I forgot how hot it gets in the spot booth during summer shows.
At Hooters West End with access to the remote for all of the tvs. I'd like to randomly change them to ice skating...just for shits.
@JenniferPasion @mariannegallowa This conversation happened in Addison. Much safer!
Some of the best conversations of my life have happened in theatre parking lots.
RT @HaHaWhitePPL: Every time you correct the grammar on another persons tweet, somewhere in the world an asian kid fails a test.

Grandma kept her teeth in her mouth at the dinner table. Happy Birthday Mom!
@mariannegallowa call me tomorrow and we shall discuss.
I did my best. The hell with it.
Oh lord!!!  The "mamas" have already started the matchmaking!
@Summerina37 May the force be with you my friend. Packing and moving are not fun ways to spend a day off. #movingblows
@danielle8483 We should compare office stories and write a play. #dayjobs

@mariannegallowa but there's ice cream!!!!!
I'm about to go all "Office Space" on the printer today. #paperjam
First time back on the stage in a year. That felt good. Think I might need to do that more often.
Jesus just appeared to me in the form of bacon wrapped chicken from Texas de Brazil.
Sharing the stage with your best friend might be the best therapy. I'm gonna miss the tent!
Well, no rapture. I guess that means 2 more shows tomorrow.
A true friend is the one that will find a creative way to wipe sweat off of your forehead during the show. Its hot in that tent!!!
They raised the prices on jello shots. They used to be 5 for $5. Now they are $2 each. How am I supposed to do this show on 2? #2isnot5
Ah the sweet smell of funnel cake during the show!
Manny's brisket tacos and a beer. Perfect kickoff to #tasteaddison
If Easter Island survived, I think we're safe.
@mariannegallowa Did I say something bad last night?  If so, I'll promise to be extra nice to the kids in the tent this weekend :)
I am still waiting for a customer to tell me that the reason they aren't paying is because of "the rapture".
"If You Give A Mouse A Cookie" is so funny it causes pregnant women pain!
RT @mariannegallowa: I don't know why everyone's talking about the Rapture. We're all such assholes, we're guaranteed to still be stuck  ...
Sometimes I have to bite my tongue so hard I think it might bleed.
If the world ends on Saturday, I'm gonna be PISSED!  I've got a show to do!

"Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here."
@RyanCowles Well, the recording I have is early Patti...before she really started singing in Latin.
Patti LuPone belting the shit out of "Meadowlark" is nearly a religious experience.
Learning my lines might be the death of me!  Its been way too long!
@Summerina37 You actually went?  Where is the one in Dallas?
I love my bed and really wish I didn't have to get out of it!
I am quite ready for Autumn.
