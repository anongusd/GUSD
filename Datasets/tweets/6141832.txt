Next Monday, I'll be speaking with Winston Ma at the @ChinaInstitute_ in #NYC on China's "digital silk road", Beijing's strategy for exporting digital tools and services to emerging markets. Monday, Jan 7th at 6pm, China Institute on Rector St. https://t.co/FoHImzXDGJ
@superwuster @mtsw The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics is the best introduction to the theory. (Frank Fukuyama's "Origins of Political Order/Political Order and Political Decay" is a good complement.) https://t.co/otm3zXvNeE
@superwuster @mtsw Where labor is productive (manufacturing, symbolic manipulation), they have to use the national purse to provision public goods, which raises the living standards of the poor *and* lowers it for insiders. (In this model, 'corruption' is just a word for insider redistribution.)
@superwuster @mtsw Simply (and cynically) put, leaders extract whatever national resources they can, and deliver rewards to as few citizens as they can. Where labor is extractive (agriculture, mining, drilling), they can concentrate rewards on a very few insiders.
@superwuster @mtsw The most convincing argument I've seen for wide vs. narrow provisioning of public goods is Bueno de Mesquita&amp;Smith's, extending Shirk's selectorate theory: Most of the fussing over regime type is a sideshow; the key Q is "How many citizens can exert pressure on the government?" https://t.co/v6rHqiCnAO
@mtsw @superwuster It would be moderated for sure -- wealth is coastal, and the worst of the poverty is inland -- but Shanghai would still be plenty unequal, because it is a banking hub with a huge population (roughly the population of NYC) of undocumented migrants.
@justinhendrix @superwuster oh lol -- it's actually edged out U.S. in inequality in both the UN's Rich/Poor ratios and in the World's Bank's Gini measurements. https://t.co/9jdygLlncp
@superwuster There are many reasons for wealth at the top: export-driven industries favor scale, the Party's penchant for 'adopting' large firms as quasi-SOE's, and so on, but the poverty at the bottom is a big part of it. As my Shanghai neighbors told us "China is rich. Chinese are poor."
@superwuster So: A larger-than-organic (and now aging) population, expanded when China was an agricultural country, most of whom can't legally move to where the jobs are, and when they do move, they have neither the education nor documentation to get anything other than lousy jobs.
@superwuster Then the internal passport system (houkou) started to bite harder. When citizens move to another province without a houkou, they live undocumented lives, including, critically, lousy access to education for their children, while the big, rich cities invested more in education.
@superwuster China's entry into the WTO, coupled with their moving up the value chain to complex, better-made products, complicated that story, further regionalizing the economy to coastal areas (Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, Tianjin) while raising the bar on educational attainment.
@superwuster For a while, in the '90s and '00s, industrialization lifted enough workers out of poverty that income inequality was moderated. If you you were bold enough to leave your town, and could perform the same simple movements thousands of times a day, you could get a job.
@superwuster When Deng, reversing Mao, said "Let some people get rich first", well boy howdy. He said that on his Southern Tour, where the most successful of his Special Economic Zones, in Guangdong Province, was on it's way to becoming the world's workshop -- Shenzhen, Dongguan, Guangzhou.
@superwuster Even then the 'one couple one child' policy was enacted, exemptions were made for ethnic minorities (disproportionately poor) and for agricultural families. This last spurt of population growth before industrialization is the background for the effects of Deng's reforms.
@superwuster China's greatest income equality started in the '50s, not because of Communist support for workers, but because of the Great Leap Forward. Economic collapse and attendant famine compressed most earnings. At the same time, policies for high birthrate inflated the population. https://t.co/jP3PYntxZA
@superwuster Many reasons (including many about concentrated wealth) but for the economic life of the poor, three big ones that interact are a) a larger-than-carrying-capacity population, b) highly regionalized economic growth, and c) strong internal controls on movement.

@Cato_of_Utica @killerlimpet @jayrosen_nyu That's exactly what I think is false. Actually opposing the action doesn't mean tut-tutting about setting fire to political offices, it means helping people you disagree with get back to participating. Democracy requires defending your opponents' engagement.
@uchimatador @Cato_of_Utica That may well be, but not reaching across the aisle would not have made that any better. To say we tried is not to say we succeeded, nor that trying was axiomatically bad. Not trying, in our view, was the worse threat.
@killerlimpet @Cato_of_Utica @jayrosen_nyu The fundamental criticism seems to be that righteousness lets us off the hook for defending our enemy's continued participation in a democratic system. I understand the appeal, but I think that belief is wrong. Participation is a special good that needs to be defended.
@Cato_of_Utica @jayrosen_nyu Same thing I've always said: I you think that firebombing your opponent's HQ is OK, so long as you disapprove of their policies, we have different views of what keeps democracies from collapsing.
@farabundista_x No, just the reverse. The point of that exercise was that no matter how horrible they are, the firebombing was not an attack on the NC Republican party. It was an attack on electoral integrity.

@sonyaellenmann @xuhulk really? I see that in coverage of some subreddits, like r/the_donald and of course the redpill ones, but when you google Pinterest in News, the top hits call it a women's site, but the same search for Reddit doesn't bring up articles labeling it a mens site

@Noahpinion For 30 years, we were funded like we ran missile systems, not monasteries. Most of the crises in higher ed aren't from current problems--they are the workout of our having re-engineered our institutions to assume constant support at Sputnik levels, not at "land grant" levels.
@Noahpinion That ended in '75, which was both the first year that the number of white men attending college had fallen since WWII, and the first year states began decreasing allocation to higher ed, now entering its 5th decade. Meanwhile, faculty had gotten used to constantly rising demand.
@Noahpinion In my domain (research universities) the answer is "Yes, we needed those thing, and yes, we're screwed." The GI Bill and the research funding after Sputnik led to a 250% increase in state allocations, 500% increase in undergrads, and a 900% increase in grad students.

@Matt_Kiser @NPRone @PodcastAddict @NPR Dude. Their own tagline is "NPR One is the audio app that connects you to a stream of public radio news, stories and podcasts curated for you."

@erin_bartram Both of those ways address emotional labor, one by lessening it, the other by contextualizing it, but neither provides the currently preferred answer, which is that we return to rapid growth that expands the job pool.
@erin_bartram My preference would be for fewer, better entry-level faculty jobs, mostly as a conversion of adjuncts, and fewer graduate students, but another way is to tell all grad students what we tell film school students about the world not owing them a living.
@erin_bartram One way would be for faculty to stop imagining a return to Cold War-driven subsidy, or the once-in-300-years growth in students, faculty and institutions between '45 and '75. That period of high demand and high support was unique and short-lived, but remains our model of normal.

@amywebb But then crypto is the subsidy. If that's my model, it will be cheaper to create stories people actually want to read -- "Hawking, from Heaven, Recants 'Atheistic Error'" -- than reporting real stories that cost more but generate fewer clicks -- "Water Board Drops Bond Proposal".
@dangillmor I don't think we even need to define it all that broadly. Will people pay for the information, unbundled from reproduction and delivery (printing press; truck-&gt;bike network) or ancillary content (horoscopes; classifieds.) If Yes, it's a product, if No, it is a subsidized service
@_mightytweets Yeah, 280 chars FTL. What I mean is that 'news', as it appears in these conversations, refers to what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch or Rocky Mountain News does (or did), not to what Stratechery or The Slurve do. The successes in the latter category do not translate to the former.
@amywebb I don't think there are. Bundled ads subsidized news for most of two centuries, but that didn't make that a business model, just a long-lived accident. The issue is not new business models, but new sources of subsidy, of which citizen support seems the most promising.
I agree with much of this thread, except this. There is no business model for news. There are a few kinds of time-sensitive information people will pay for -tech, national politics, sports- but broad, accurate, and skeptical coverage has always been subsidized. https://t.co/tyVa37X0mD

@erin_bartram The American system of education isn't one, so it's not the kind of thing you can disrupt a la Christiansen. 350 years of founding has lead to, non-sectarian, land grant, research, community, and for-profit colleges, but new institutional forms join old ones, not kill them.
@bijanstephen That seems right - "I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken" seems like pretty good argumentative advice. (And a side note: the internet has introduced everyone to Pragmatist epistemology, and people sure do not like it.)
@bijanstephen ...which gets you right back to How We Do The Twitters Now.
@bijanstephen It's easy for me, sure. But your exhortation to own one's bad opinions seemed general, and I am not sure, in practice, how that differs in practice from the dictum, from all speakers,  "Substitute your opinions with mine."
@bijanstephen But my preferences for racial diversity and global engagement hurt  ethnonationalists, who prize white Protestant homogeneity. I am happy to hurt them, because their goals are evil, but pretending that this isn't "really" hurting them is a phony out.
@bijanstephen But Bijan, this is just "Do The Right Thing, 2018 Extended Dance Remix." Assuming that there *is* some easily knowable list of bad opinions begs the question.

They didn't "have" more than two terms in the same way Xi will. They won more than two in elections, something Xi will never have to do. In the absence of other checks and balances, this is a disaster for already weak restraint of the recently paramount leader. https://t.co/ijQ2Yj8gcN
@codinghorror It is NOT GOOD. The miracle of China, since Mr. Deng stepped down and took the rest of the 1st gen leaders with him, is that it has been an authoritarian technocracy but with a regularly scheduled change of leaders. Xi is destroying that; bad for the Chinese and bad for the world

@vicciho @zeynep @bokane Hong Kong is next, because Hong Kong is always next. The surprise for the Party is that slowly draining freedom while leaving international banking norms in place turns out to be hard, but short of CCP fissure, HK is doomed. :-(
@bokane @zeynep Which is to say I agree with you about 'damn sure state supported.' The tax large firms pay is not just monetary. They are agents of the Party's goals. Jack Ma buys up independent media, Baidu takes the reputational hit for the Great Cannon, etc.
@zeynep @bokane It is a historic wrong. But there is no point in imagining that Apple could have had its cake and eaten it too. The only thing that would have kept Apple from harming Chinese citizens would be to drop all its services in China.
@bokane @zeynep "State-owned" doesn't even make sense in describing the CCPs relationship to large firms. It assumes things like the rule of law, and contracting regimes that allow private citizens to bring the government to court. All billion+ RMB firms are quasi-SOEs.
@zeynep @bokane Zeynep. China would have kicked out Apple. They just took over Anbang, which is a much bigger deal than ejecting foreign firm. What Apple did is awful, but there is zero leverage -- zero -- in siding with users over the CCP.  Apple:China::(Blackberry:India)x1000

@jayrosen_nyu @kstigerlily @JRubinBlogger @chucktodd I just had the most interesting political conversation with my son, who asked, in the sort of wonder a teenager can have about the workings of the adult world, how the WH could have let Wolff get that much access with that little oversight.
@Green_Footballs ...which is funny, since O'Keefe's org came after @JayRosen_nyu and I with the same tactics (though all they discovered was that liberal professors are liberal. Webms at 11.)
@jayrosen_nyu @kstigerlily @JRubinBlogger @chucktodd He's said as much. When someone asked why the WH didn't ask Murdoch what he thought of Wolff, Wolff said he was waiting for that call every day, and was surprised it never came.

@amyhoy I think the problem is not predictive branching, but the fact that software can ask for data from arbitrary addresses. They made a low security/high speed tradeoff for parallelism. Qubits ease that tradeoff.
@mfioretti_en Feel free to republish, and thanks
@heidilegg @mfioretti_en They could only get to Apple Wallet of bank details if they could get to that *hardware*. (Unlikely.) But they might be able to get to places where you story your passwords, if those are stored online anywhere.
And Spectre is not a  trivial side-effect -- high-speed pre-fetching is how substantially all modern CPUs work. https://t.co/8WIRMqs5qS
And if someone else runs Spectre on that hardware, of course, they can see your data. This is just fishing. You can't easily target a particular person or firm. But it is *driftnet* fishing --  an industrial-scale attack on large collections of data.
As many people have noted, this is craziest with cloud computing, where your virtual server shares actual hardware with many other users. If you can run Spectre on that hardware (if you can show ID in that bank), you can see data from other users. (Gigs of it, from many users.)
So the bank is the CPU, your requests are a program, the clerks are processes, and the deposit boxes are memory. A trusted program can ask process to fetch chunks of memory it has no right to. To enable fetching, checks on whether data is valid for a process only come later.
And you can do this again and again, asking to see the contents of boxes that aren't yours. You can't alter the contents, but you can know what they are. Over many iterations, you can learn the entire contents of the vault.
Once your ID checks out, the clerks trust you, just for a moment. If you show ID and ask for one of your boxes, #117254, you'll get it. But if you show ID and ask for #440587, you'll get to see the contents of someone else's box instead.
So here's the bug. The bank's protocol for checking ID, and for making sure you don't walk out with other people's stuff, are both good. However, the security for fetching safe deposit boxes is bad, because it is optimized for speed.
To enable this predictive fetching, they don't check whether you need the contents till after they've fetched it. Sometimes these guesses pan out, sometimes not, but nbd. If they bring something you don't need, you can just leave it there.
The bank is concerned about security. People have to show ID, and can't walk out of the vault with stuff that isn't theirs. However, the vault is enormous, and the clients impatient. There are also many clerks. To speed things up, sometimes the clerks *guess* which boxes you want
I'm going to try explaining the Spectre attack with an analogy: Imagine a bank with safe deposit boxes. Every client has an ID card, and can request the contents of various boxes, which they can then take out of the vault.

@heif @AustenAllred Sometimes those two critiques are conflated -- "So many groups agree college is broken" without noting that they point in opposite directions. (Peter Thiel is Conflater-in-Chief for that particular source of confusion.)
@heif @AustenAllred Yeah, that's a big part of it. "If you start *here*, you'll end up *there*" is an easier sell than "Try this. Maybe a good surprise will happen." And both Freire-inspired unschooling and Flatiron-style "Get u a Jay Oh Bee" camps set themselves in opposition to college.

@JillFilipovic In the aftermath of 2016, we seem to be heading for a world where the appropriate name for a progressive who does not issue litmus tests and denunciations is 'Liberal.'
@JillFilipovic Just last week, as Sanders -- Sanders! -- was trying to spin Doug Jones' win as good news for progressives, the progressives were lining up in the comments to denounce Jones as *not pure enough* to make his victory worth celebrating.
@JillFilipovic The end of that dream, not at the hands of their enemies but their political next-door neighbors, has persuaded many of them to choose purity over any attempt to seek power, as that inevitably involves pollution of faith.
@JillFilipovic There was a brief moment, in the whiter parts of the movement, in which Leftists could believe that they could have both power and purity -- with Sanders in the White House, the ego-wounding tradeoffs of centrism would be abolished.
@JillFilipovic I'm not sure there is that much of a difference anymore. The Left seems to have shifted from progressive to puritan in the aftermath of Sander's defeat at the hands of Democratic voters.

@shanelarivee @tophersouth @mrbenwexler @kristenschaaled It doesn't make you a bad person, but it does make you a bad citizen.

@Jacob606 @girlziplocked That is true. There are only two parties to vote for. The U.S. has been a two-party system since the first contested election in 1796. Third parties come in third; that will not change in your lifetime. Your attitude is one of the reasons Trump is our President.

@girlziplocked That attitude was political right up to July 19th of last year. Starting July 20th, it wasn't, because from that point, there was one - really, only one - way to stop Trump, and insisting that voters deserved better started being beside the point.
@vicciho Missed you too, thanks -- relocated back to NYC from Shanghai, new job, etc, but today was just the day to watch the tweets flow....
@redindhi @quinnnorton Yep. And how do you think those people are liking the results of not doing that job today?
@quinnnorton Mass organization, including get out the vote drives. Mass organization to NOT vote has never worked.
@quinnnorton It does not matter what you care about. Does. Not. Matter. You caring is not what the Presidential election is about, and even thinking that is a distraction. What matters is: Someone will be named President in November. You have two and only two choices. Pick.
@quinnnorton That has never worked in the United States. The only places where sort of protest works is when elections are stolen. Here non-participation is *the feature the oligarchy most wants.*
@quinnnorton But they obviously did have something to vote for, right? I mean, doesn't today prove that? Since July 19, 2016, voting for Clinton was the only way to prevent being harmed like this. Even if you weren't hopeful, not voting has turned out worse for you than voting. As predicted.
@shanelarivee @mrbenwexler @kristenschaaled Do you actually believe, watching the current proceedings, that Congress under President Clinton would have produced any tax bill this harmful to most -- really, most -- U.S. citizens? Because if so, you are just virtue signalling, with no underlying grasp of actual politics.
@quinnnorton It's not insane. That's how voting works in Presidential elections, and has since 1796. A citizen who needs to feel attracted in order to vote has confused emotional satisfaction with allocation of power; making participation require engagement is a form of voter suppression.

@jfleming2870 Voting for a third party could also be supporting Clinton. Third parties aren't even as predictable as you suggest.
@nate_ela Given enormous pool of non-voters, moving a 'leans Dem' to the polls is cheaper than addressing the concerns of a 'leans Green'.
@nate_ela Yes, I'm neglecting that, b/c there's no evidence it happens. Nader didn't make Dems more liberal, or Perot the GOP more centrist.
@smktty @Chris_arnade Under that system, I could tell you that they still have to earn our votes, but I'd be lying.
@smktty @Chris_arnade They don't have to earn a vote. One of them will become the most powerful person in the world, no matter what.
@jfleming2870 It says "Some attacks on our enemies are such a threat to democratic legitimacy that a bipartisan rebuke is called for."
@dsquareddigest It had enough to threaten Tories. American back-benchers have no escape valve, which is why Congress looks like a cage match
@TheeInitiative Disliking the system doesn't change it. If you want a third party to win, you'll have to change the Constitution.
@DrJasonJohnson Right. This is a response to a pro-Jill Stein article.
@dsquareddigest Brexit happened b/c U.K. has a parliamentary system. If U.S. becomes parliamentary, we'll have meaningful 3rd parties too.

@TheeInitiative ...and a careful reading of the Constitution, and of the history of two-party voting 1796 to present...
@grinsfelder True, but rank-choice also bad for third parties. They'd get more aggregate votes, but total 2-party share would grow to ~100%

And all a 3rd party vote can say is "Whatever everybody else decides is OK with me." It's a refusal of political engagement altogether.
Under these circumstances, all a Presidential vote can say is "This politician will use power in ways I marginally prefer over that one."
Since democracy prevents the government from being run by a coherent ideology by design, it can only ever offer choices among lesser evils.
(To give you a sense of the difficulty of that, the bit that needs re-writing is Article II, Section 1.)
This is a Constitutional issue, not an electoral one. A third party could only succeed if the Constitution were re-written.
A strong Presidency and winner-take-all voting has cemented two-party politics since before the first competitive election, in 1796.
Even multiple parties can't represent most voters' preferences most of the time, and the US system limits viable parties to two at a time.
A world with 6 issues and a moderate position between Y and N would need over 700 such parties, each representing ~0.1% of the electorate.
An imaginary world with only 3 issues--Legalize/No Fly/Raise Tax--and only Y/N preferences would still need *8 parties* to represent voters
If you want legal bud, I have no idea what you think of Syria. If you want Syrian no-fly, I don't know what you think top tax rate should be
There is no correlation among voters' ideal policy choices for economic vs. social vs. international issues.
Voting can never be a reflection of any individual voter's preferences, because those preferences are too varied between voters.
A vote is a choice to join a power-seeking coalition. It is not a personal affirmation of a coherent ideology. It is not a moral choice.
This is everything wrong with third-party voting, in one succinct headline.	 https://t.co/1ZtZn4w2py

@Chanders First Whig not elected til (long) after last Federalist, and so on with Whig &lt;- Republican and Democrat &lt;- Democratic-Republican.
@Chanders Agree on both counts. Interestingly, history of political parties for 220 years is that no new party emerges til and old one dies.

Would take a 3rd party total of ~9% AND an R/D split of 9% for Trump to be at 41%. Not impossible (it's an odd election) but seems unlikely.
Alot of this was liberal wish-fulfillment--39% was an intentionally ridiculous choice. No R/D pair has been separated by even 10% since 1984
Tossed this out Thursday night, it came back averaged to 41%, which I think is unduly optimistic. My own guess is 48% for HRC to 44% DJT. https://t.co/UkRh6IeWFn

200 years of civil rights struggles suggest that bundling issues works less well than unbundling, as w/campaigns for women vs. A-As to vote.
But for any given system of power, whether women are allowed to wield it is separate from the details of how that system otherwise works.
This is exactly right. Politics assumes power will be imbalanced, and is a question of who wields and what they are allowed to do. https://t.co/ijLclmMX0c

@charlesarthur @tristamsparks Perfect. Wish I'd said that, would have saved me a lot of typing. :)
@charlesarthur @tristamsparks ...that explanations are unwelcome. People cherish incomprehension, and will reward anyone who provides it.
@charlesarthur @tristamsparks ...that they 'can't understand' why those people feel that way, but when I try to explain, it becomes clear...
@charlesarthur @tristamsparks I have been following the Deplorables /avant la lettre/, and when I RT them, people regularly tell me...
@charlesarthur @tristamsparks I think defending oneself against 'deep down' understanding is what the filter bubble is.
@charlesarthur @tristamsparks That, I think, is Twitter's great, Phyrric gift. It reminds us that there is no inherently coherent worldview.
@tristamsparks @charlesarthur Filter bubble is less about not seeing things we disagree with, and more about being defended against them.
@tristamsparks @charlesarthur So instead of denying that people disagree with us, we now deny that those who disagree with us are people.
@tristamsparks @charlesarthur The internet means we can now see what other people really think. This has been a huge huge disappointment.
@tristamsparks @charlesarthur Demonizing of opponents coincided with the stripping away of denial about how many people disagree with you.
@tristamsparks @charlesarthur Could be The Nation. Could be Commentary. That was enough. No one would to make you aware of stuff you dislike
@tristamsparks @charlesarthur I've been arguing that it's openness for years. In the 1990s, you could get centrist news &amp; read one magazine.
@JeffMcClelland I have two purposes: Accept that there are no objective criteria for determining who 'won' &amp; to remind people to vote.
@ChuckinCharly @Farzad_MD @gassee There are no objective people.

Last night, while RTing Deplorables, several people suspected bots/paid shills/shitposters. Not true (alas) Check the RT count on this video https://t.co/XbwVlTvOzp
@KeithHumphreys ...the energy of the hosts is often at a crescendo, and that feels persuasive to them. They model that in their own output.
@KeithHumphreys And when they make their own media, it is as earnest and as strident as they are. When they listen to talk radio...
@KeithHumphreys Trump voters have a curious faith in power of media. They attack MSM because they fear that power. They revel in Drudge etc.
RT @Scholars_Stage: Read this thread folks https://t.co/8ISJdywtbB
@Flaghnar I think evidence that many people liked Trump's performance is important, and feeling sad is the right response. As is voting.
@capesean It's easier most days. :)
@WaltFrench @dewordepolitics The great work on this is Anderson's 'Imagined Communities', positing nationalism as redirected loyalty.
@RoostVineyard Dude, you're the one who said you've managed to avoid interacting with prejudiced whites. That takes voluntary segregation.
@simonscott1975 "We don't want immigrants. We do want those nice Indian doctors, though."
@RoostVineyard Also, since you said Ohio, I'll guess Shaker Heights?
@RoostVineyard Asked about zip codes, not cites. W/that list, I guess Young Digerati, Bohemian Mix, or Cosmopolitan. https://t.co/yPCjNt013b
@dewordepolitics  ^--this @WaltFrench
@RoostVineyard What's your zip code?
@WaltFrench I agree, but I'm a cosmopolitan. If racial hierarchy is any part of a voter's worldview, the choice this election is clear.
Many many--like 10s of millions of--whites feel this way. Black people they know are sympathetic, but 'the blacks' are gaming welfare, etc.
@25thcenturygirl We mostly don't hear that phrase. We whites have been raised to think of ourself as having a kind of 'default' race.
This lets whites avoid modifying prejudices based on blacks they know personally, and to associate blacks they don't know with stereotypes.
'The blacks' are associated with usual negative stereotypes held by whites. Black people are neighbors, co-workers, maybe someone at church.
Many whites make a strong distinction between two categories--'the blacks', and black people.
.@WaltFrench You'd be surprised. Overt 'call out the dogs' racism has gotten rarer, but casual discrimination is still appallingly common.
@JeffMcClelland Yep. One of the things I use my account for is RTing people I disagree with. People who don't like that should unfollow me.
@JamesEPowell27 Not like the comment section, because the newspaper doesn't change it's editor in chief based on their votes.
@rberger There is no such objective reality. There are only two tests for being President -- Constitutional limits &amp; Electoral College vote.
@Dawn_One Yes. If we think we've won, we've lost. That's how #Brexit happened.
@WaltFrench @ceciliamarie Start by imagining you wanted a racist welfare state &amp; isolationist nationalism. What else would have to be true?
@pattho It's been gross. Can't wait for Nov. 9.

@Chris_arnade But Chris, I think @jbouie's point is that these voters had agency, like 16 other choices, as recently as this spring.

@jbouie And if you think being racist is blameworthy, then you think class neither explains nor trumps racism. Where would that leave you?
@jbouie If you believe workers have some natural bias to class solidarity, you must, as a side-effect, be willing to excuse their racism.
@jbouie As @docrocktex26 points out, the Obama Coalition is really just the Democratic party. Given that, white workers will self-segregate.
@jbouie All the hand-wringing about the white working class isn't because the Dems could lose without them. It's because they could win.
@jbouie I think another reason is socialist despair. There's been no 'Worker's Party' since whites abandoned Dems after the Civil Rights Act

@LuellenBee But that's my point: Trump exploited GOP incoherence to shred orthodoxy, and won. The GOP was and is powerless to stop him.
@rajatsuri I'd be willing to take the other side of that bet. I think his floor is 46%. What do you think it is?
@LuellenBee Hard to explain how he did better and better as the field narrowed, though.
On Election Day, liberal turnout in swing states is the only thing standing between us and that man sitting in the Oval Office.
Trump's own words and actions provide considerable ammunition against him, but having ammunition and using it are two different things.
Here's what sure liberal victory plus low voter turnout looks like: it looks like Brexit. It looks like the FARC peace deal.
There is one and only one way to defeat Trump: Get. Out. The. Vote. That is the only thing that could keep Trump out of the White House.
Anyone who does not want Trump to be President needs to know this -- GOP politicians and voters will not do our job for us.
His is a racist, misogynist tax dodger, a vain buffoon, a failure in business, an uncurious narcissist, but he is not a Democrat.
The GOP picked him, and now they need him to win. Most GOP pols and voters will not turn against him, because solidarity trumps ethics.
There's no behavior that would cost him the election either. Out of 20 voters, 9 will vote for him, no matter what he says or does.
There's no policy position Trump could take that would cost him the election. He mocked 3 decades of GOP orthodoxy, then beat 16 challengers
Presidential politics is not about voters expressing their opinions. It is about voters joining one of two power-seeking coalitions.
Every single thing revealed about Trump in the last 10 days boils down to whether he gets 46% of the vote and loses, or 48% and wins.

@johndbro1 That is right. Reality is a bitch, I recognize, but it is at least where things get changed, unlike 'I prefer purity to action.'
@tomcoates We're undemocratic because the Founding Fathers were terrified of mob rule. Checks+balances were mostly to keep citizens in check
@tomcoates Yglesias had a provocative gloss on this: https://t.co/lDRd9GVAEP It's a bit doom and gloom for me, but the problem is real.
@tomcoates But the big one is that President and legislators are elected separately, where U.K. Prime Minister is a result of leg. elections
@tomcoates Local campaigning is part of it -- 64M UK citizens/650 MPs &lt;&lt; 315M U.S. citizens/435 Representatives.
@tomcoates They haven't had much luck so far (to put the matter politely) and First-past-the-post voting means 3 parties = 2 losers.
@tomcoates ...but saying the United States shouldn't have a President has so little traction I'm willing to regard it as impossible.
@tomcoates No, you can't get an 'ought' from an 'is', and like you, I think  parliamentary systems are better than our presidential one.
@Johannes_Ernst The practical outcome of railing against Lesser Evilism is ushering in greater evil, from the pov of your own voters.
@Johannes_Ernst If you take votes mostly from Dems (as the Greens do), then you are helping your voters elect the party they hate most.
@Johannes_Ernst A notionally viable 3rd party would have to steal votes from R &amp; D equally, but in practice they are partisan organizations.
@Johannes_Ernst (It makes more sense if you drop the word 'party' and think of GOP/Dems as standing, funded infrastructure for campaigning.)
@Johannes_Ernst Our parties are not ideologically coherent, so they adopt or shed issues faster than 3rd parties can form around them.
@Johannes_Ernst 'First past the post' voting means that two losing parties can never form a coalition. (That's how LePage won Maine twice.)
@Johannes_Ernst Several things: We elect a President separately, unlike the Parliament/Prime Minister systems elsewhere.
3rd parties exist to flatter people. We should stop pretending it's a replacement for the boring work &amp; hard compromise of actual elections.
If donors cared about politics, they'd try to affect the agenda of one of the viable parties. Politics is what they are donating against.
A third-party candidate who even got close to viability would have to start practicing politics. Off-brand, when you're hawking purity.
It's not just that 3rd party Pres. candidates lose. (Though their track record is 100% failure over two centuries.) They can't afford to win
Unlike mainstream politics, attention is not the way third parties achieve their goals. Attention IS the goal. There is no other.
And the party campaigning to play The Imperial March at Yankees games will not be doing anything different than the Green Party is doing.
If 100 people are willing to donate $10, you'd have enough to fly to DC and give a speech on banning GMOs, or light sabers, or chillwave.
You could found an Animal Rights party (spokesghost: Harambe) Or 'Taco Trucks Must Also Sell Tamales!' Or 'Crush Our Enemies In Cabo Verde.'
That's coming in 2020; 3rd Parties as the new lulz. Imagine Deez Nutz, but with a travel budget. (Imagine /b/, but with press conferences.)
You and three friends could do accomplish everything the Green Party has, armed only with Squarespace and Venmo.
The Greens are like a Kickstarter that's always raising money and thanking donors, but never ships a product. "Thanks" *is* their product.
Behold their electoral record: https://t.co/6Egv5dzO9D

@docrocktex26 👊
@Chris_arnade And since white expectation of superiority precedes even capitalism, I'd say it is *precisely* an atavistic response.
@Chris_arnade 'I lost my job to China. I'm angry at blacks' is a non-sequitor without understanding 'At least I'm not black' as a comfort.
@Chris_arnade The context of racism is the old social order, where whites were better than blacks.
@Chris_arnade But the context of racism isn't failed industrial unions. It precedes both unions and the industrial revolution.
@Stottle Me too. All @docrocktex26's work is great, but that thread blew my brain up.
@Chris_arnade And why does a loss of jobs to automation and outsourcing correlate with more hatred of blacks?
@Chris_arnade And why was racism worse during the period when both economics and institutions were working better for white people?
@Chris_arnade Yeah, I saw that, but if racist impulses stem from economic anxiety, why do they cluster in Appalachia and the South?
@jononomo @Chris_arnade I haven't seen it, but I've been traveling. Chris, if you found it, hit me up on DM.
@Chris_arnade What's the context for racism?

@charlesarthur Finally, the Sell Online strategy worked w/aspirational users in big cities, but Huawei etc have better distribution networks
@charlesarthur Then there were the Mi5 shipping/OS woes, and the focus on non-phone products and non-China markets.
@charlesarthur Xiaomi's early lead was always a result of them figuring out a bunch of pipeline innovations. Huawei/Oppo/Meizu copied them.

@znakit Greg, that's not true. That's political speech, protected by the 1st Amendment. No court has ever treated that as intimidation.

@znakit I think you are confusing me with someone else. I do not make Hitler comparisons, about anyone, under any circumstances.
