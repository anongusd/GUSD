Do not let @realDonaldTrump strangle democracy: Naturalize NOW! @npna @thenyic @weareunidosus @CHIRLA 	#TearDownThe2ndWall #immigration #NaturalizeNOW 		https://t.co/n9ljXFhq2i

#POTUS apparently will move heaven and earth to build his racist border wall, but your administration still has NO IDEA how many families you separated at the border! We see where your priorities are, and we won't forget in 2020. #SOTU	https://t.co/jfkD4txTu4
#POTUS claims he loves #DREAMers and law-abiding immigrants, but he has consistently worked against real protections &amp; built a wall preventing them from naturalizing and voting. You’re a hypocrite, @realDonaldTrump, and we will work to build solutions, not racist walls. #SOTU
We hear #POTUS will call for for civility tonight in the #SOTU— I’m all for it, @realDonaldTrump! Let’s see if it’s possible for you to give a speech without calling immigrants criminals, rapists, or terrorists, or to not refer to other nations as “sh*thole countries.”

Trump manufactured a security crisis at the border. Here are the ACTUAL facts:	 	1) Border crossings are DOWN	2) Immigrants are LESS likely to commit crimes than people born in US	3) We spend more money on immigrant enforcement than FBI, DEA, US Marshals &amp; Secret Service COMBINED https://t.co/CIlNw2S9Bf

Trump just accepted a temporary deal to end the #governmentshutdown with NO FUNDING for his wall, the SAME DEAL he rejected in December. This is not the behavior of a leader, but of a reckless child who doesn’t care about the harm he inflicts on our nation and our people!
.@GovPritzker proved to be a strong champion of the IL immigrant community today by signing executive orders expanding #KnowYourRights education &amp; access to welcome centers for immigrants.

Todos sabemos que @SecNielsen miente sobre la separación de familias en la frontera, y que mintió bajo juramento cuando la interrogué en mi última audiencia judicial. Al igual que @SenJessMerkley, estoy harto de las mentiras de esta administración! 	https://t.co/ZHiEu44oIj
We all know that @SecNielsen has been lying about separating children and that she lied under oath when I called her out again in my last Judiciary hearing. Like @SenJeffMerkley, I am sick and tired of this Administration lying to the American people! 	https://t.co/ZHiEu44oIj

This is a disgusting breach of our nation’s values &amp; demonstrates the cruelty of this administration. New reports find that separations at the border began months before the policy announcement &amp; thousands more children were taken from their families. @SecNielsen, RESIGN! https://t.co/ol5vttx8Ba
Today the judicial system said NO to discrimination by #immigration status! The ruling to block the inclusion of a citizenship question on #Census2020 is another victory for our immigrant communities who will not remain silent when facing this administration’s continuous attacks! https://t.co/EFesfswQVi
Este cierre de gobierno es el más largo en la historia, el cuál deja a miles de trabajadores federales sin pago y todo por el monumento racista que Trump pretende construir.

This #GovernmentShutdown is officially the LONGEST in US history, leaving 100s of thousands of federal workers without pay in the name of Trump’s racist wall. Make no mistake: this is not about security, but is a game for him resulting in the suffering of millions of Americans! https://t.co/Oc8bFAqcgs

As I discussed on @CuomoPrimeTime, Trump’s focus on the construction of the racist border wall is strategic: “He wants to talk about the wall because the noose is tightening in the Mueller investigation and in order to divert attention.”
From my appearance on @CuomoPrimeTime tonight: Trump continues “attacking Mexicans &amp; children coming across the border. . . most of the people at the border are fleeing the same drug cartels that are feeding in the drugs that kill Americans.” We must act with humanity &amp; not hate!
I'll be speaking on @CNN this evening after Trump's #immigration speech to discuss the implications of his announcement and the importance of developing just solutions to border security and immigration. Don't miss it!
I will always be an outspoken and unapologetic advocate for justice! I look forward to continuing our work in tearing down the second wall with @npnewamericans. #Immigration #SiSePuede https://t.co/5w2oPHJgdI

Estás correcta en una cosa @SecNielsen- la crisis humanitaria no va a desaparecer! Pero esta retórica es un ejemplo más de la estrategia de la administración de mentir e infundir temor. Para hacer honor a nuestros valores como nación demos la bienvenida a enfermos y cansados. https://t.co/tQEWlJPCjV
You’re correct about one thing @SecNielsen-the humanitarian crisis at the border is not going away! But this rhetoric is another example of the administration’s fear-mongering &amp; lies. We must find secure &amp; humane solutions and continue welcoming the sick &amp; tired with open arms. https://t.co/YgLcoEj2N9
Frente a la falta de voluntad de Trump para abrir el Gobierno después de 2 semanas, los demócratas están mandando un mensaje claro: No habrá muro! Como dijo @SpeakerPelosi, “Un muro es una inmoralidad. No representa quienes somos nosotros como nación.” https://t.co/FFHa0YI3lD
With Trump's unwillingness to compromise &amp; end the government #shutdown after 2+ weeks, Democrats are sending a clear message: there will be no wall! As @SpeakerPelosi stated, “A wall is an immorality. It’s not who we are as a nation.”		https://t.co/FFHa0YI3lD

Mañana es la fecha límite para reunir a miles de niños con sus familias, pero no nos hagamos ilusiones; el presidente Trump seguramente no cumplirá con este límite, del mismo modo que se perdió el último,  en violación de una orden judicial federal.

Today, as I said on the House floor, President Trump is basing a broad anti-immigration &amp; anti-immigrant policy agenda on his bedrock belief that crime and skin color are synonymous.

Killing protesters en masse, especially those who are peaceful and unarmed, is unacceptable, even for one of our country’s greatest allies. The United States of America does not stand for this at home or abroad. (4 of 4) #twill #chicago https://t.co/NizG2tfq1h

Hace casi diez años exactamente, la redada más grande de la historia ocurrió en Postville, Iowa. Hoy,  en víspera de ese aniversario, hablé con familias de Tennessee. Hablar con ellos fue como revivir esos días horrendos, cuando tantas familias fueron destruídas... https://t.co/EtMQLXCLvq
Trump dice que los Latinos son violadores y asesinos. Sin embargo, estos son los mismos inmigrantes que trabajan duro para sacar adelante a sus familias. Al contrario, el dueño de una planta – quien es acusado de no pagar impuestos, entre otros crímenes - aún camina libre. https://t.co/hFDys9R6Mc

My message to the families is that despite how this President treats Hispanics in #PuertoRico Tennessee and everywhere else, you are not alone and we will fight for your families. Thank you @tnimmigrant for all you do. https://t.co/kHo8Qk4umc
The President says Mexicans &amp; Latinos are criminals, rapists and murderers, yet the immigrants he goes after are those working at jobs supporting their families. And the ownership of the plant – accused of not paying taxes and maybe other crimes, still walks the streets. https://t.co/6153JA4laD

If the GOP said we are ending same-sex marriage, but promise Dems a vote later; or approve oil drilling in every nat'l park, but you’ll have a vote later – do you think the Democrats would say yes? https://t.co/YBPXkfXBE8
Democrats believe in immigration and it is deeply engrained in who we are as a people. Every American family has been shaped by immigrants who were allowed to live among us legally – even the Trumps – so let’s make sure our laws reflect that. #heretostay https://t.co/pH1UQYxMoG

Govt should not detain moms + kids for seeking asylum. 7 US Reps to visit TX family detention facilities on Monday. https://t.co/s6b5B7eWG0
Moms+kids are being detained for the completely lawful act of seeking asylum. My colleagues + I are going to see firsthand what is going on.
On Mon I will join 7 MOCs incl @WhipHoyer @RepZoeLofgren @RepRoybalAllard + @JoaquinCastrotx to to visit 2 family detention facilities in TX
Trying 2 make conditions of detention 4 moms+kids as humane as can misses the point. We should not hold vulnerable women+kids in detention.
