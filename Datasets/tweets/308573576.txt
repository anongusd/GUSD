ICANN transition makes U.S. stronger, not weaker https://t.co/D54KsFyf7R #IANA #ICANN
#PEC has made our country more competitive. It helped expand exports by USA biz. Thank you for your advice and service to keep USA #Open4Biz
That transition is set to begin on October 1. Any effort to derail that would embolden those who seek greater gov't control of the Internet.
It would chill innovation while making it harder for USA biz to reach their customers and do business online. So it is bad for business.
Shifting ICANN to the UN or any intergovernmental body would leave Internet vulnerable to geopolitical disputes &amp; endless bureaucratic delay
