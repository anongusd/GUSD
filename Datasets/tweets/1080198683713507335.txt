Members of Congress should be receiving their first paychecks on February 1st. I believe it is unacceptable for Members of Congress to get paid when we haven't done our job and have asked the House Administrator to withhold my paycheck until the shutdown is over.
Since then, the House has continued to act, passing multiple individual appropriation bills to re-open vital government agencies. Still the Senate refuses to act.  The fundemental job of Congress is to pass a budget and fund the government.
On my very first day in office,  I passed bipartisan legislation to re-open the government. Legislation that the Senate unanimously passed last month. But now they refuse to do the same.
Today is the 26th day of the government shutdown. Federal workers have missed paychecks and for the first time ever, servicemembers of the U.S. Coast Guard will not be paid. It is unconscionable.

South Carolina cannot afford the risk. Our beaches, businesses, and way of life are not for sale. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not just saying no to offshore drilling, I‚Äôm saying hell no to offshore drilling.
Deepwater Horizon caused the loss of 11 lives, $62 billion, 10 million user-days of beach, fishing, and boating access, and its impact on fisheries could total almost $9 billion by 2020.
And this dangerous process doesn‚Äôt even prove oil deposits exist! Companies still must drill test wells to confirm deposits and determine üí∞. Remember, the Deepwater Horizon tragedy occurred during the tapping of an exploratory well.
Since most marine life depend on sound to communicate/navigate, blasts can disrupt basic survival functions. Noise from just ONE airgun can kill off zooplankton, the organism that underpins the entire marine food chain.
Blasts need to be loud enough to travel the miles between the ocean floor and a ship - which means they can be heard underwater from about the distance between LA and NYC!
But even before you get to the drilling stage, companies must search for oil and gas deposits buried deep under the ocean floor thru a process called seismic airgun blastingüí•. This is an extremely loud and disruptive process.
Since 2001, the offshore oil industry has had more than 589 reported oil spills!
You hear a lot about offshore drilling, but have you ever wondered why exactly it‚Äôs so harmful? I‚Äôm glad you asked! As a former ocean engineer, I know  how destructive drilling for oil can be to a coastline. Even a small leak can destroy our beaches, economy, and way of life.
