We need to enforce the laws already on the books rather than limit the rights of law-abiding citizens who want to protect their families. I think @SteveScalise would've gotten that point across had he been allowed to testify when these bills were under consideration in committee.
As a father and grandfather, I want to reduce gun violence as much as anyone. But these bills make it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and others against criminals who have guns.
The gun control legislation being considered this week infringes on the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens and does absolutely nothing to stop incidents of mass violence. https://t.co/B3Ld34bC0B #twill

That being said, it’s a shame that Nancy Pelosi and the open borders wing of her party have put us in a position of choosing between funding essential government services and securing our borders, especially when they supported these barriers in the past.
I am pleased that Congress averted another costly government shutdown while providing resources to build more than 55 miles of new physical security barriers along our borders. This agreement will help provide certainty that government services will be funded.

This vitally important legislation not only punishes bad actors at the VA who misuse funds, but also will prevent future misuse of taxpayer dollars. We can’t always predict bad behavior, but we can put in place systems that lessen taxpayer exposure to it. https://t.co/PbKf78UvF2
