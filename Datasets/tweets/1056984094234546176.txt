@MusicStuffnMore The agism was from your senator to a bunch of good intentioned school children, telling them that because they can’t vote, their opinion doesn’t matter to her. She knows better, she’s touting her 30 years experience and dangling it to these kids like she’s Donald fucking Trump

@manda_hannah346 I would say no to both of those. I don’t know if Bloomberg has a rags to riches story, but Schultz does. He grew up a poor Brooklyn kid who got lucky.

@UnitersCentrist It should disqualify Schultz then if that is your formula for being qualified to be President. Schultz has been a lifelong Democratic contributor. He has spent millions getting Dems elected. Bloomberg has no courage to break this broken two party system, but should run #GDI too.
@StephenSage8 Yes, I think it will be tough for people on both sides of the aisle to come out and support Schultz at this point, or maybe any point. Bloomberg is fucked cause he has no guts to run as an Independent and will be slaughtered in the Democratic primaries, he’s got no shot

(2/2) stop whining about @HowardSchultz running as an #Independent - Ross Perot pulled 18% in 1992, analyzed as a 9% for Bush and 9% for Clinton. These are different scenarios and Schultz running should not scare anyone away. A vote for Schultz, is not a vote for Trump. #GDI
(1/2) In the General Election, if it's Trump vs. Independent Schultz and Democrat Harris, and no candidate gets enough electoral college votes, the President will be decided by the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi will choose our next President! #GDI Democrats should stop..

@HowardSchultz says #Harris single payer plan that abolishes private insurance and doesn’t let citizens keep their plans is “Not American”. Schultz supports ObamaCare and says Harris’ plan would add trillions to our national debt #GDI  https://t.co/gKpa3q9hdv
Here's my choice for 2020, if he runs as an Independent, which I think he will. Schultz just hired Republican strategist and MSNBC host Steve Schultz as his campaign director. He's got a legit chance to shock the country. He’s a billionaire and can get on every ballot #GDI
