We need to steer the conversation in a different direction in our country. It‚Äôs time for a new way of governance all together. Should policies about Healthcare, Education and Criminal Justice Reform be left to any one party ideals? These are humanitarian issues-not party issues.

When it matters,who are our leaders? We need leaders, not politicians. We need those who will raise their voice, not just to follow a social media trend,but when it's needed. We need those who speak truth,not convenience. Leaders of the people, not a political party. #WeThePeople https://t.co/KrmgQEmUoj
@KamalaHarris Do the lives of Puerto Rican citizens really matter? Do our civil rights really matter? @NAACP Endorsed statehood for PR, but the people want decolonization, choice, freedom. Are we to be taken that right away too? Time to be the difference. #LeadersNotPoliticians https://t.co/d5Ncztdwpt
