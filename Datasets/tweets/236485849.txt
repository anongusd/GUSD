A letter to NBC from Hispanic/Latinx voices - https://t.co/gEImeJwnfN https://t.co/gEImeJwnfN
Third, the voices of Hispanics/Latinx are often missing from media panels like @MeetThePress @NBCNews.  If we aren't at the table, it's important to find ways to speak out and share facts/truth.  So, to my Hispanic/Latinx family, your voice is important, always.
Second, it is also not true that mixed brown babies are creating culture problems. Again, the facts show that a rise in interracial marriages are an example that brown babies are welcomed human beings. (Also refer to culture leads like salsa).
When journalists get facts wrong, often there will be a re-write. That's because an "I'm sorry" allows ignorance to ensue if not corrected.  In that vein, it is not true that Hispanic/Latinx immigrants don't embrace the English language (refer to Pew study or the census).
Hey @PastorJack5, standing up for what is right is never thin skinned. Speaking out is the only way to ensure that folks are aware of who we are and the beauty every culture brings to the world. I appreciate his apology, but it lacked appropriate corrections. @tombrokaw https://t.co/0niFx44DR3

3) The Latino community does not need a lecture about assimilation. Instead, let‚Äôs celebrate the wonderful new things that Hispanics/Latinx are contributing to the fabric of American society.
2) The rise in mixed marriages creating ‚Äúbrown grandbabies‚Äù suggests that a majority welcomes diversity (versus Hispanics/Latinx creating ‚Äúculture clashes‚Äù). It is disappointing that he would give a voice to racist ideas on this topic without calling them out for what they are.
1) To clarify, we speak English and a lot of us also can speak Spanish too. Proudly. In fact, studies have shown that Hispanic immigrants have an especially high commitment to learn English.

Shouldn't women's empowerment be about "fearless women"? https://t.co/kXrOXleitD
Here‚Äôs what I do know ‚Äî as a Mom of a "fearless girl", I try my best to raise a "fearless woman" for a world not ready for it.  Unfortunately, the "fearless girl" statue is just another reminder, in bronze, that true equality continues to be a generation away.
I don't know which answer led to the statue. But I‚Äôve been trying to figure out ways to describe why this particular one is a child when other movements are depicted by strong, shoulders-back Generals, Soldiers, Presidents.
Or, is the pt that women are supposed to be inspired by a symbol of their earlier "fearless girl"? Or is "fearless girl" intended to make it easier for others to be less afraid of bold women? Or is gender equality more likely to be accepted if it's a daughter versus a colleague?
Sharing some thoughts - I know some folks are really excited about the new statue facing down the NY Stock Exchange. But it‚Äôs always bothered me to see the symbol for women's empowerment as a "fearless girl".  Shouldn't women's empowerment be about "fearless women"? https://t.co/Nr9UsxDy7D

But most importantly, I want you to know that I still believe this is the greatest country in the world, and I‚Äôm not ever giving up on it.		Your friend,	Amanda
If in doubt, I suggest that you consider replacing them with folks who will be 110% on the side of protecting the American people.		To those of you who have reached out to me, thank you for your support during this strange and difficult time. I want you to know that I‚Äôm OK.
That's why I hope you'll ask your Senators and Congressmen whether they have been covering up what's been happening, or whether they're sincerely fighting to protect their fellow Americans.
and our unique position of leadership and credibility in the world. Looking forward, I cannot imagine these perpetrators will stop unless our elected leaders take decisive action to combat and more severely punish them.
I know that many of you are getting tired of the endless stream of breaking news, but we simply can‚Äôt get de-sensitized to this. Too much is at stake ‚Äì our freedom to choose our own leaders, our trust in our legal and political systems,
This is extremely serious stuff, and I hope that every patriotic American will take a moment to let this sink in. Please understand that the Russians were not really targeting me personally. They are willing to use or harm any of us in order to achieve their goals.
I love this country, and I've tried every day to make it even stronger. That's why it's absolutely infuriating to learn that the Russians would use my name in their efforts to harm our country.
For many, this will feel like ‚Äújust another Russia story‚Äù. But for me this is a deeply personal violation. I‚Äôm a proud public servant, and I‚Äôve been honored to serve at the local, state, and federal level over the last two decades.
It has been all over the news for months, and all 17 of our intelligence agencies agree that it happened. What's new here is that the Russians were using the identity of an American citizen in an attempt to harm the United States.
Although I‚Äôm happy to see independent sources acknowledging the truth, it was still chilling to read about this. We‚Äôve all heard about Russia's efforts to disrupt the election and help Donald Trump.
The FBI and Washington Post have both investigated this and concluded that the story-line has no basis in reality. It was simply made up by the Russians.
In case you missed it, the Washington Post published yet another story about Russia's attempts to interfere in last year's election. The latest report is about a completely made-up email exchange between me and former US Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
No we were not:  You may have missed my fb post on May 27, 2017.		Dear Friends,	I‚Äôm writing in response to recent media reports that Russian intelligence agents were using my identity to spread misinformation during the 2016 election cycle. https://t.co/1oHSkXpAKh

Leadership matters &amp; who defines it does too. I applaud Disney/ABC for hiring the talented Channing Dungey AND for trusting her to lead as well. As a woman &amp; a woman of color, there are those days when you know you just have to work 10X as hard to prove talent, skill, &amp; ability.

Newsom responded that Allen is a devout supporter of President Donald Trump, who's been accused of sexual harassment." #CAGovDebate
He then called out Newsom for having an affair while he was mayor of San Francisco, saying "If you can't trust Gavin with his best friend's wife how can you trust him with your state?"
"The candidates for California governor were questioned about the affairs Tuesday during a televised debate in San Jose. Also during the debate, Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen dismissed a harassment complaint filed against him as a minor issue ginned up by Democrats.
This excerpt from @Bakersfieldcali shows why we need a new type of leader. These men seem to think that sexual misconduct is a game. In fact, it's a serious problem and it destroys careers. We need a Governor who can be trusted to fix these problems once and for all. #TimesUP

.@KMPHFOX26 @KMJNOW  @ValleyPBS Just some closing thoughts: There was a lot of talk in tonight's debate about priorities and issues. But government works best when public servants do the people‚Äôs business with humility, enthusiasm, and skill.
4. Create collaborative partnerships with job creators and academic institutions so that graduates of high schools, community colleges, and four year universities have the skills needed for job opportunities
3. Require every high school student to take a computer science/coding class
2. Move from STEM to STEAM to include the important role of the arts in every elementary school
1. Make high quality preschool programs available to all families
As a former public school teacher and a public school teacher and a current public school parent, we need to do more to ensure our kids are ready for a 21st Century workforce. Here is what I would do:
A couple of other issues not raised in tonight's debate: Education and Income Inequality. The Central Valley has some of the lowest income communities and most underserved schools in the nation. It's time to truly invest in all of our communities.
Housing policy is the result of a complex interplay between local, state, and federal laws. I have experience working across all levels of government and have lived in all parts of our state. I know each area has its own unique challenges. @KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS
4. Reinstitute a Redevelopment Agency system that can focus on each region and longer term planning and solutions @KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS
3. Speed up permitting, broaden zoning options for residential development and affordable options, expand tax credits and housing assistance for low income and middle class families, and partner with cities and counties to solicit federal funds for housing development
2. Support passage of this year‚Äôs $4 billion housing bond, which will provide additional funds for low income housing and help to cover the cost of home loans for veterans
1. Declare homelessness a State of Emergency in our hardest hit cities in order to unlock new tools for immediately addressing homelessness
These problems will not be fixed quickly or easily. We need a comprehensive plan:
Specifically, in the Valley, CA DOJ busted major gang operations and sex trafficking rings. @KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS
During my time as COO of DOJ, the incredible public servants at DOJ locked up human traffickers, cracked down on polluters, fought for women‚Äôs healthcare, shielded seniors from Medi-Cal fraud, and secured millions in student refunds from for-profit colleges.
The best way to reduce crime is to educate our kids and reduce poverty. @KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS @FresnoBee @GVWire
I will take every legal step we can to stop the deportation of Dreamers and tearing more families apart. They are our families, neighbors, workforce, and friends. @KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS
It's important for people in California to know that the Valley is part of a $20B export market. As the fmr Chief of Staff to the Chairwoman of the Ag Committee who wrote the last Farm Bill, I know the importance of Ag in CA and around the world. @KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS
@KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS We MUST be able to do more than one thing.  We can do Sites &amp; Temperance Flat. This is not a hard question.
@KMJNOW @KMPHFOX26 @ValleyPBS @FresnoBee @GVWire https://t.co/NjAaP126Nm
We need an "all of the above approach" to water: expanding reservoirs, capturing stormwater, recycling wastewater, replenishing groundwater, &amp; truly investing in innovative ideas like desal plants. We've been talking abt these solutions for way too long. It's time to truly act!
@KMJNOW @ABC30 @KMPHFOX26 No one else on this stage truly knows what it's like to live in the Central Valley worrying and praying that you will have enough water to cook, to bathe, to live. As gov, I will do the job knowing how imp it is to fix our water issues once and for all.
Since there's a debate in the Central Valley at 6pm, I thought I might share my pride for growing up in a place that feeds the world. As gov, I will never 4get the small towns that raised me &amp; how important it is that we have a plan for ONE CA. Live tweeting 2nite's debate. https://t.co/U3asEpPkpr

Let me be clear: we're taking every opportunity we can to communicate directly with voters, including gubernatorial forums. We are attending more in the coming weeks and hope to see you there.
I believe in campaigning as I would govern, by starting a dialogue &amp; bringing new voices to the table. The idea that we would turn down an opportunity to get the word out to voters in the Valley - where I was born &amp; raised - just doesn't fit with who I am and where I come from.
If you follow me on Facebook (https://t.co/sh9PXDuqGO) or Twitter (@AmandaRenteria) you already know I'm working hard to get the word out to every community across California, racing up and down the state, often to areas that have traditionally been left out of the conversation.
It's important to correct the record. Many supporters were told we were invited. This is untrue.

I know it takes courage to tackle this issue once and for all, but there are millions of people who have already stepped up. Now, it is time to do something about it.
Finally, I will be committed to cleaning up Sacramento by working with the legislature to institute grievance procedures for all state offices, so survivors know there‚Äôs a process in place to help.
SB 1300 (@SenHannahBeth): Amends existing state law to strengthen training requirements to prevent workplace harassment; requires employers provide employees with information on how to file harassment complaints; and removes barriers to workers bringing claims and speaking out.
SB 224 (@SenHannahBeth): Expands sexual harassment protections to clarify that sexual harassment is prohibited by investors, elected officials, lobbyists, directors, and producers.
SB 1038 (@SenatorLevya): Clarifies that individuals can be held personally liable for retaliating against an employee for exercising her or his legal rights against workplace harassment and others forms of discrimination.
I will support:	AB 1870 (@AsmReyes47, @LauraFriedman43, @MarieWaldron75): Extends the time by which workers may file workplace harassment and discrimination claims from one to three years.
I will sign @EqualRightsAdv legislation that would make California workplaces the safest in the nation. @MiraSorvino #TakeTheLead
As Governor, I pledge to stand up to the Trump Administration as they roll back civil rights for survivors. I would sign legislation preserving Obama-era Title IX protections in California. @kdeleon @senhannahbeth
Second, we need to establish policies that will hold public institutions to a higher standard of conduct.
First, we need to call out all bad actors and hold them all accountable. We can no longer watch from the sidelines or be afraid to speak out. I applaud all the courageous efforts to ensure everyone is held accountable.
In California, we can do something about it so that no one works in an environment that harms people‚Äôs lives, especially in public service.
We must turn the page on sexual misconduct everywhere. That work starts right here, right now. As we‚Äôve learned over the last year, this problem is pervasive in every industry across America.

One politician after another has been forced to step down due to a history of sexual misconduct, drinking alcohol with teenagers, or misusing their power. It‚Äôs unacceptable in public office, and Californians are demanding an end to it. /7

The long time consultants and political powers at work have said I‚Äôm too late to this race to make a difference, but I believe the only power that matters is that of the people. It's why I am so excited to hit the road, connect with all types of people, and earn every single vote
This campaign is about reclaiming what we value in our elected officials, and making sure that voters understand that I will put them first ‚Äì it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done as a teacher, city employee, in the US Senate, on campaigns, and at California‚Äôs Dept of Justice.
We are at a different time in our political history ‚Äì where folks are waking up to the idea that the power is in their hands.  You see it, not just here in California, but across the country. I believe what we have seen is real. And, frankly, it‚Äôs just starting.
I just hated the idea of so many young people seeing that debate thinking that political leaders use their power to help themselves instead of helping others. We have to change that image and that reality.  It‚Äôs why our politics are where they are today.
After attending the @Univision debate in Los Angeles I decided I had to get in. I saw the two frontrunners quickly descend into an argument over who became more rich by the use of their political power. This isn‚Äôt what politics is supposed to be about.
Over the last year we‚Äôve seen countless people from all walks of life take courageous action in the name of positive change. We need a governor who does the same.
I‚Äôm glad to know there are so many people interested in my decision to run, and I look forward to changing the culture of politics together.
I want you to hear it from me first (kind of!) ‚Äì I‚Äôm running for Governor of California. https://t.co/4vPOkhwAn5
