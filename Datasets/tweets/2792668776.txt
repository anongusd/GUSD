@HildyJohnsonA1 @DavidNakamura Exactly
@CharlieGileNBC Okay. That’s what I’m talking about. Would have thought they would have already done them. Maybe they’re doing a raid😉 of someone!
@CharlieGileNBC I thought deadline was midnight???
@BarbMcQuade Does he have to release it tonight?
@ShimonPro Damn
@Tom_Winter Tom, it’s promised by midnight, right?
@ShimonPro @cnnadam @kpolantz @RachelSmolkin @DHBerman It HAS to come tonight, right???
@PamKeithFL Exactly
@leahmcelrath Richmond VA
@crampell @yashar Well that makes sense why there was a coverup
@yashar Call Richmond va police
@NoyzeSmythe @Chad_M_Andrews @RVAwonk Richmond VA
@ScottMStedman Richmond, VA police
@JamesHillABC I think we know that one of those names is Individual 1
@RepSwalwell I absolutely adore you!
@ZoeTillman Damn
@eliehonig @eorden That is my guess. Especially since SDNY approved his request first.
@thehill Jesus
@ShimonPro @KFILE He should really put it on Airbnb. He’d make tons of money😉
@RobElgasABC7 @SAKimFoxx @ABC Do we know why?
@pmo_pmo_pmo @ScottMStedman Psych Group
@BeyondThePalin @KenDilanianNBC @SenFeinstein And Grassly, too
@KenDilanianNBC So, is this your way of telling us that they now have the report???
@EamonJavers We’re all up early hoping for some good news this Friday, aren’t we?
@realDonaldTrump You don’t read, asshole
@ZoeTillman So, Rex?
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary Thank you!
@ScottMStedman JFC!!!
@ScottMStedman They have him. And Kilimnik, too
@AP @JonLemire Heartbreaking
@ScottMStedman Ha!!!
@RepSwalwell @SenBlumenthal Thank you!
@GregShugar @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Actually fire marshal said 6,500!  😂
@anitakumar01 @POTUS Root canal??
@dsamuelsohn So, he’s been gagged?
@JakeSherman Oh what an A_ _!!!!
@oliverdarcy Good!
@seungminkim @JohnDingell So sorry to hear this news😔
@virginianpilot @seungminkim @Fahrenthold , who is behind all of this?
@Tom_Winter After February is interesting. Seems like we have some things coming down the pike!
@Rob_Flaherty @notlarrysabato Love this!
@AdamParkhomenko Love this!
@Tom_Winter @mikememoli What about Don Jr?
@eorden Seems like Gates has been talking!
@yendorcire @jowr_what @chrisgeidner @ScottMStedman 😂
@realDonaldTrump Hello Kettle, meet pot!
@ShimonPro Not looking as confident today!
@shaunking Anyone over Trump
@ShimonPro 😂😂
@maggieNYT @KFaulders Ha ha ha
@maggieNYT @Santucci @peterbakernyt Ha ha!
@ScottMStedman Who is Alex?  What’s the connection???
@Santucci @ABC Interesting!  Thanks for naming names!!!
@ShimonPro @eorden Feels like something is about to get out and they’re trying to get ahead of it.
@ShimonPro Excellent catch!
@samstein And bizarre. It’ll all come out eventually...
@mkraju Sickening
@dsamuelsohn Once we find out who and what this is, we’re going to realize how big this case is!
@rgoodlaw Bring it!!!!
@ChrisMegerian Interesting!
@mkraju Hopefully it’s because Mueller is interviewing him!
@awprokop Bring It!  He’s a trapped little man!
@jimsciutto This is horrible.
@nycsouthpaw @KlasfeldReports This is HORRIBLE and so sneaky to do it on a Sunday
@PreetBharara 😂😂
@ScottMStedman @RepSwalwell So proud of you!  Can’t wait to read it!
@MichaelOrton Oops!
@postlocal There were TWO killers?
@postlocal What???
@BreitbartNews And Trump caved, once again
@amandacarpenter And we always thought Eric was the more innocent one!
@DavidMDrucker 😉
@dsamuelsohn @AndyNewsNowInDC She doesn’t put up with nonsense!  This is awesome!
@ZoeTillman I’m wondering what time it’ll be here when it’s 6am in the embassy???
@GregStohr How soon could we see them?
@DPAQreport @woodruffbets Shameful
@jonathanvswan And he’s slurring again!
@Kyle_Feldscher @kpolantz @davidgshortell @MarshallCohen @evanperez @ShimonPro You guys are amazing!  I follow all of you!!!
@HillaryClinton @repjohnlewis @iVoteFund @OnwardTogether Thank you for all you did in trying to warn America, Madame President!
@ZoeTillman @Haleaziz 🥵
@gabrielsherman What’s it about?
@realDonaldTrump Just shut up
@emptywheel Those were the best of times!!!
@brianschatz Absolutely!  Keep doing you! We’re behind you!
@AnnCoulter What the hell is wrong with you?
@11thHour Do NOT trust him!
@MSNBC @AriMelber This was great. Ari did a great job with the interview!
@maggieNYT Don’t trust this tweet
@thomasafine Shit!  Great work!
@MariannaNBCNews Ha ha ha
@mkraju He only has TWO other clients... Hannity and Broidy.
@oneunderscore__ But his only known clients are Trump, Hannity, and Broidy.
@ChrisMegerian And then says other clients. Is he trying to throw Hannity under the bus?
@ddale8 Truly, he’s just worthless
@brianschatz That’s awesome!
@ScottMStedman Can’t wait to find out the name of the shell company
@ScottMStedman Excellent, Scott!!!
@BenjySarlin He just incriminated him?
@johnpavlovitz I really needed to read this tonight. I am so ashamed of so many of my friends who seem not to have empathy and feel so much hate.
@ScottMStedman Oh, Scott!  Staying tuned!  You are on this!!!  👏👏
@ScottMStedman Campaign?
@desiderioDC @GenePark @AOC This is AWESOME
@ambiej @emilyctamkin Jesus!
@jedshug So Jared could be the reason they cleared the entire floor that day🤔
@jimsciutto Heartbreaking
@joshgerstein Truly, this has got to be big!
@GregStohr Unbelievable. And shameful
@ScottMStedman @McFaul Scott, thinking for sure that this is the mystery company.
@chrisgeidner YOU
@HoarseWisperer Exactly
@ABCPolitics Actions have consequences
@kylegriffin1 I really hate this man
@emptywheel @LadyBlueICU What does it all mean???
@stevenportnoy Truly, he’s such an embarrassment to our country!
@jaketapper @kylegriffin1 @reason @robbysoave I just watched this whole thing. One incident did NOT have anything to do with the other.
@christinawilkie It feels like Mueller just set a trap for Donald
@ddale8 I feel like SC just set a trap for Trump and he just fell right into it
@Olivianuzzi Correct. And that means they were VERY worried about the @BuzzFeedNews story!
@grantstern I agree. And suddenly Trump starts tweeting...  he’s feeling relief. Maybe they were trying to throw him off their scent?
@AdamParkhomenko @realDonaldTrump He’s witness tampering again!
@SimonMaloy Trying to remind Don Jr not to rat him out
@petersterne I think they didn’t want this to get out yet
@briantashman Witness tampering... yet, AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump Afraid he’s going to flip on you???
@realDonaldTrump Why are you retweeting this from March 2018?
@ChrisMegerian Ha ha ha
@JonLemire And no one cares... unless he’s going to open up the government. Otherwise, it’s just noise in our heads
@BenDWalsh @jonswaine Wow. Just wow
@jimsciutto They’ve got Trump ...
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Go Ted, go!!!
@ZekeJMiller What an ass
@jimsciutto Truly horrifying
@JakeSherman We’re going to find out about some voting fraud in PA, aren’t we?
@robertdembo @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews This is horrifying!
@mkraju @ChrisCuomo Ha!  Looks like he knows what’s about to happen!
@ShaneGoldmacher @maggieNYT Awesome!
@matthewamiller @DelWilber True. And the other thing that really bothered me was his answer to Graham about investigating strozk and  page.
@mkraju You see, Trump doesn’t really care.
@woodruffbets Truly, this just makes me so sad
@JoyceWhiteVance @Eugene_Robinson I agree he should be in trouble and have consequences, but I feel like they are putting the hammer to him because they don’t have the guts to do it to Trump
@juliegraceb Which is good, but they still haven’t done anything about Trump and his racism etc.
@AdamParkhomenko @Marmel Sedatives?
@grammyresists @NatashaBertrand Agreed. Feel like they are preparing the public
@SykesCharlie Can’t wait to hear the response from the White House
@zacharybasu They are all in on it, aren’t they?
@ScottMStedman @mflynnJR Not really. His Dad got in trouble with the lawyers, remember?
@seungminkim @PhilipRucker 😂
@eorden He’s so screwed!
@markseibel @passantino Thank God!
@TalKopan That was my thought just the other day!
@PreetBharara He knows he’s cornered.  Hope he’s scared shitless
@RudyGiuliani Huh???
@jedshug This gives me chills. Maybe “the wall” is just Trump trying to make his Dad proud.   Jesus
@mikememoli @JakeSherman @SpeakerPelosi Because they don’t want to provide real answers!!!
@thehill Trump is such a baby!
@dbongino @realDonaldTrump Ha Hah Hah!
@CheriJacobus Jesus
@lawrencehurley Woah!!!  👏
@LK_Rigel @kasie What when he’s listening to others speak. Keeps closing his eyes when others lie
@EliStokols @chrislhayes He’s done with this shit show
@ddale8 And he’s trying to change the subject from the border wall.
@AP_Politics Delete this now it’s not factual and you know it!
@SusanWi78232618 @KatrinaPierson @POTUS Ha ha ha
@JonLemire He’s a pig. Just a pig!
@KatrinaPierson @POTUS What a joke!!!!
@MaxBoot He hates being embarrassed and HE JUST DID IT TO HIMSELF!!!!
@PreetBharara Because it was so funny, I guess!
@neal_katyal The whole “threat” of his ival@Office speech was a scare tactic. What a loser
@ZerlinaMaxwell Please let me know when it’s over and @MSNBC goes back on air
@kenvogel This is HUGE
@ScottMStedman It WILL be horrific. I don’t think any of us has any idea about the depth of this corruption
@ScottMStedman Excellent, Scott!
@nzlemming @khnorthrupesq @ZoeTillman So glad we are seeing them now!
@nzlemming @khnorthrupesq @ZoeTillman Could be!  Everything is starting to overlap, isn’t it?
@ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz We’ll be playing for you guys!
@ScottMStedman @StevenLHall1 I think that’s a huge connection
@ScottMStedman @StevenLHall1 Too me, that was a huge “find” today
@MrsPaul16 @PeteBrush Excellent thoughts
@TheBeatWithAri No worries... Mueller has them!
@KlasfeldReports No wonder Manafort isn’t cooperating
@jentaub @ScottMStedman @FranklinFoer This just keeps getting bigger and bigger, but yet I feel like the noose is tightening for Trump
@ScottMStedman @DonaldJTrumpJr Jesus. This is going to be the most explosive thing in our government ever!
@PeteBrush Trump has no idea what he has gotten himself into... but Manafort sure does!
@bradheath Think we’ll hear today?
@Wilson__Valdez This is really scary
@ChrisMegerian @zachsdorfman I’m thinking it was Cambridge
@lrozen Wonder if the info was from Cambridge Analytical?
@mabehr @MuellerSheWrote @BarbMcQuade @AshaRangappa_ @NatashaBertrand @JoyceWhiteVance I don’t know if it’s the company, but I think there is a direct link between this and the mystery Mueller case
@jedshug Everything is coming together!
@jentaub @jedshug I feel like this is Mueller’s warning shot and it’s all about to go down!
@KlasfeldReports @BBuchman_CNS Something huge is about to break
@GregStohr So does that mean we’re going to know more about this case?
@ChrisMegerian When was the floor cleared at the DC court?  Thinking this SDNY charge might be connected somehow if it was filed on December 20. Thinking that was the same day as the secret testimony in DC
@watchingfoxes @ZoeTillman No, the mystery company. I’m thinking it was around Dec 20
@ZoeTillman Zoe, what was the date that they closed off the entire floor of the DC Court. Wondering if there is a connection somehow with this SDNY case?
@ChrisMegerian Maybe as a warning to Trump that they have him before he declares a national emergency tonight?
@JakeSherman He’s been staying at his manager’s house in Baltimore.
@mrbenwexler Ha!  We can only hope!
@dsamuelsohn @politico @rachaelmbade Wrong, wrong, wrong
@dsamuelsohn Interesting!
@VP @trumps_feed @washingtonpost There is NO emergency. You guys are such losers.
@JenniferJJacobs @esaagar @MSNBC is holding strong!  They’ll be on the right side of history!
@mlcalderone My guess is MSNBC won’t, but will monitor it and break in to show it, if necessary. They’ve really been taking the lead on good reporting lately.
@CivMilAir He should start tweeting soon🙄🙄
@BarbMcQuade Love your new profile picture, by the way!!!
@mkraju Hmmm. Good to know.
@hughhewitt @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Wow!  You believe that?  Then you’re an asshole
@gtconway3d George, I cannot wait to be able to read your book after all of this is over!!
@JasonBretWells @blakersdozen Sick
@JonLemire It WILL be a stain on his legacy. Unfortunately, one of many
@TheBeatWithAri @RepSwalwell It’s wonderful
@awprokop Which new committee is Nunes on now?
@JoshNBCNews @srl Especially right after Christmas. I’m sure most people charge things and then need their January paychecks to pay off their card!
@hsu_spencer Must be a lot of fish still to be caught.
@TalKopan @seungminkim I like that one!
@GarrettHaake I’m just worried about the “coyotes “ that are going to kill the kids coming over
@christinawilkie Nielsen is biting her tongue and her facial expressions are priceless
@BrookeLorenz @PeterWhoriskey @Reinlwapo Of course they are...
@frankthorp She’s adorable!
@JakeSherman He’s really not a bright person...
@DavidJollyFL @PaulLeeTicks Hoping Don Jr
@Mimirocah1 @joshscampbell The one on Trump’s right looked ashamed to be there.
@chrislhayes It was simply beautiful to see America represented!
@JakeSherman @seanhannity Ha!
@JD_Magrath @FJScott3 @WestWingReport @kaitlancollins Just wait it out
@kylegriffin1 Excellent!
@thehill This is not his reality show.
@FJScott3 @JD_Magrath @WestWingReport @kaitlancollins Manafort chose him to be VP. The connection will become clear.
@aaashbyrhonda @kyledcheney @BenSasse That’s just the GOP list!  No worries!
@lindsemcpherson Excellent.
@RepAdamSchiff We know you will and we are grateful!
@JD_Magrath @WestWingReport @kaitlancollins Trump and Pence will be indicted
@ccadelago @ChrisMegerian We all just need to ignore him!
@kylegriffin1 Great job@MSNBC
@jyarow @christinawilkie Exactly. Too much positive news today... he couldn’t stand it any longer!
@WestWingReport @kaitlancollins She’ll be President by the end of the year... mark my words!
@RudyGiuliani You okay, buddy?
@JonLemire He’s crazy. That’s all you can say at this point...
@ddale8 He’s already feeling defeated and the Dems haven’t taken over yet!!!
@AlexMLeo @joanwalsh @Anders_MAGA And they are all suspended!  YOU are amazing!
@jeffmason1 @kaitlancollins They are so odd
@RudyGiuliani What????
@CivMilAir Even funnier... he just put out a tweet pretending he’s in DC
@CivMilAir He’s going, isn’t he?
@chrisgeidner Ha! Sorry!
@chrisgeidner Also of interest: https://t.co/WLdlIFIFZl
@CivMilAir Could be why he tweeted and said he was IN the Oval Office
@heyyguido @ManInTheHoody Is that hard or flaccid?
@PopularPups Love is in the air!
@JoyceWhiteVance And his winery
@ScottMStedman @LannyDavis Jesus!  I feel like no one is a good person anymore
@20committee What did the tweet you are replying to say?  I’m blocked!
@botsMustBeCrazy @ninaandtito Me, too
@NewYorkStateAG You are AMAZING!!!
@markmackinnon @KlasfeldReports This is incredible!
@HoarseWisperer @AshaRangappa_ I’m so lost without you!
@CivMilAir Huh. So Jared returned from Florida?
@girlsreallyrule @AdamParkhomenko 🤮
@Sanity__please @ScottMStedman 😂😂
@neeratanden @Karoli We still love you!  Keep doing you!
@CivMilAir Wonder if they’ll stop in Florida??? 😉
@steveholland1 Let us know if you make a drop off in Florida!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Melania had to put on another outfit 🙄
@CivMilAir This is really odd
@KlasfeldReports They deserve every penny.
@mercedesschlapp @LarryOConnor @ElrushboRush Yuk
@mkraju Meltdown is about to happen.  3,2,1...
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Go to bed
@jwgop Sure hope not!
@emptywheel Thank you!
@StephenJCampbe2 Hey, Trump trusted North Korea... see where that got us?
@emptywheel So is Concord the secret company asking to go to the Supreme Court?
@terrype65 @chrisgeidner @MrJonCryer 😂😂
@josephrpalmeri @JakeSherman 😂😂
@xeni Manicotti and garlic bread... straight carbs!
@frankthorp @Phil_Mattingly @BresPolitico Great job on @maddow tonight!
@Phil_Mattingly @BresPolitico 😂😂
@dsamuelsohn It seems like MAJOR activity!  Hoping that means we’ll learn something soon!
@seungminkim A mug would be nice😉
@chrisgeidner Chris, this is a lot of activity... any thoughts on what it is?
@ESCochrane Wish there was video!
@ZoeTillman It sure is a lot of activity. Feels like something very big!
@Mopshell @desiderioDC @lauferlaw Yes. Got back this morning
@ShimonPro Funny how everyone keeps calling him childish!!! 😉
@KlasfeldReports I sure wish we’d get some indictment news today!
@grantstern @20committee I think Mattis might know that’s happening!
@brianschatz Thank you for going back!
@ScottMStedman You’re going to break this whole thing open, Scott!
@nytpolitics @gtconway3d Cannot wait to see what he has on Trump!
@realDonaldTrump You are an ass
@rebeccaballhaus It is unbelievable and horrifying. America is crashing before our eyes.
@gtconway3d George, please, can you do anything???
@SteveSchmidtSES He’s staying until the end of February and the Mueller probe is supposed to be finished mid February...  Lord, I hope so!
@brianschatz Thank you!
@frankthorp @SteveScalise He’s a pig
@frankthorp Tonight would be a great night not to give in to Trump
@kaitlancollins @barbarastarrcnn @rabrowne75 Trump should be gone by then...
@PhilipRucker @kaitlancollins Mueller probe might be done before that... there is hope!
@kasie @christinawilkie Maybe he wrote the opinion piece after all
@mkraju That’s what we ate ALL saying!
@kaitlancollins @barbarastarrcnn Jesus!
@ShimonPro @LauraAJarrett Oh that is wrong!
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Jesus, just go to bed
@rebeccaballhaus Wow
@Fahrenthold @TheLastWord @realDonaldTrump You are a hero!!
@KlasfeldReports @nycsouthpaw Wondering if it’s Deutsche Bank?
@JuliaDavisNews Sounds just like Trump
@ShimonPro 👏👏
@RudyGiuliani I’m starting to think this is actually Trump tweeting on Rudy’s account.
@MrsSP5 @KlasfeldReports Devin?
@dsamuelsohn Who IS this?????
@ScottMStedman @RepSwalwell They should!
@MichaelRWarren @weeklystandard Good luck to you, Mike!
@seungminkim Apparently 🙄
@JonLemire He’s the ACTING chief of staff. It’s just a distraction...
@hsu_spencer When was this filed???
@kaitlancollins Ha ha ha
@colvinj @JonLemire Ha ha ha. So, he’s really not acting Chief if Staff
@kaitlancollins Last time leaving?
@hsu_spencer This is page 1 of 3... did you see the rest?
@Willwesurvive2 @hsu_spencer @ScottMStedman So interesting. Feel like it has something to do with today’s appeal in DC
@hsu_spencer @ScottMStedman Do we know when she was supposed to do this?  Was it today?
@ilyamarritz @JustinElliott Excellent!
@ScottMStedman Holy sh—!!!!!
@neal_katyal Neal, something made him put out that statement TODAY. Do you think something big happened at DC court today?
@dansinker @ericuman @ilyamarritz @JustinElliott @WNYC 😂
@mkraju Ahhh. Wonder what caused the change of heart?
@CharlieGileNBC @ChrisMegerian I’m thinking it’s Trump. Nothing on his schedule today
@dsamuelsohn So glad you are there!
@ZoeTillman Thank you, Zoe!!!
@rebeccaballhaus Yet ANOTHER embarrassment for him this week!
@11AliveNews Heartbreaking
@Tom_Winter BOOM 💥
@ScottMStedman @juliaioffe How does he connect in, Scott?
@Teri_Kanefield It’s George O’Neil Jr
@rebeccaballhaus Interesting perspective!  And again, just now on Fox News... good catch, Rebecca!
@MattOrtega Wow
@PhilippeReines Explains Lindsay Graham
@brianstelter @gabrielsherman Jared the other night, Melania tonight, what is this?  A PR campaign?
@matthewamiller #3 is most interesting!
@AaronBlake @mkraju So he’s compromised also...
@woodruffbets @ErinBanco @maddow She did a great job!
@jkbjournalist Good!!
@DLoesch Butina just pleaded guilty...  how ya doing, Dana?
@dsamuelsohn And Butina Wednesday at 3:15. Big week!
@NormEisen @CREWcrew Thank you!!!!!
@eorden What ???
@jonathanalter Picture on the right... YUK
@jdawsey1 @seungminkim Everyone is laughing at him... once again
@realDonaldTrump You said it, asshole
@kaitlancollins Actually, I suspect he knows Trump won’t be in office very long
@JonLemire Hurry
@girlsreallyrule @WajahatAli @maddow   Hope you’ve seen this!
@girlsreallyrule @WajahatAli Could it be Trumps housekeepers son?
@Isikoff @dklaidman @SkullduggeryPod Omg
@NBCNews Couldn’t lose Rudy being able to inform Trump
@ChrisMegerian Wow... four... that’s really disturbing!
@neal_katyal But can we have a redo???
@ShimonPro Now!
@realDonaldTrump Feel better, now?
@ShimonPro He’s going to be proven as the one who is dumb as rocks😉. Any hour now!
@eorden All of us!!!
@eorden @evanperez @DanaBashCNN And Trump must have just found out!
@ShimonPro @donlemon I’m so sorry. Stay safe
@jwgop He’s a caged chicken
@realDonaldTrump You realize that no one even listens to you anymore, right?  We just LAUGH AT YOU!
@seungminkim Beautiful shot!
@matthewamiller I’ve been waiting all day!
@kpolantz @mkraju We know it’s been written for awhile, so there’s a reason for Mueller’s timing. But, please, HURRY UP!
@ShimonPro You know it’s been written for awhile. Wish I understood Mueller’s timing on this!
@ShimonPro Geez, I wish he’d hurry up!
@ScottMStedman @mflynnJR Ha!  Noticed that, too!
@steveholland1 Mueller should release Flynn report right now
@kylegriffin1 Seems to be a bit of witness tampering... yet again
@KlasfeldReports That’s who I was thinking of. Thanks!!!
@KlasfeldReports Adam, who is being sentenced today?  Thinking December 3 is a court date for someone
@LincolnsBible @ScottMStedman @ryan_trollip @mtylr23 @JamesFourM @lauferlaw @LouiseMensch @ushadrons @QeyeTDogbytes @tribelaw @SethAbramson @20committee @ninaandtito @ericgarland @counterchekist @SpicysFiles @TrueFactsStated @911CORLEBRA777 @TheRickWilson @DrDenaGrayson @CheriJacobus @aliasvaughn @DirkSchwenk @gregolear @TundraEatsYou @JuddLegum @kelly2277 @LuluLemew @MelissaJPeltier @FBI Who is Erin????

@WTKR3 They found the couple!
@mkraju Wow. Just wow
@jonathanvswan Ha ha ha
@ragipsoylu It was so creepy to watch
@PhilipinDC @PressSec Omg.
@realDonaldTrump Nobody believes you... do you understand that???
@JonLemire Timing couldn’t be better
@tomrousseyABC7 You are good, Tom!
@etuckerAP @AP Ha ha ha!
@RawStory I really hate this man
@AP @AP_Politics So disgusting
@AP So disappointing
@JonLemire So sad. What a loss for Mississippi
@K8brannen They are so stupid 😂
@matthewamiller What happens if we find out they threw the election???
@kylegriffin1 They need to continue this... awesome!
@JaneMayerNYer That’s sickening
@woodruffbets @mbaram @NoahShachtman Might be a reason we don’t know about!
@matthewamiller @danielsgoldman And of so, you know Mueller knew that was happening!
@NewYorkStateAG @ELLEmagazine YOU are AMAZING!!!
@georgelittledc So, if Trump gets indicted, are the pardons null and void?
@ScottMStedman And he already has the answers to the questions Trump answered!
@annaschecter Oh give it time...  he’ll agree
@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 Save this tweet
@KlasfeldReports Beautiful news!!
@mattmfm It just saddens my soul to think of all we have lost.
@FOX61News My heart grieves
@realDonaldTrump You okay, Trumpy???
@AJGuglielmi Bless him, his family, friends and coworkers ❤️
@ChrisSpears84 @ABC7Chicago Heartbreaking
@ABC7Chicago How old was he?
@AJGuglielmi @BillWest5 This utterly breaks my heart
@AJGuglielmi @ChicagosMayor This just makes me so angry!
@rebeccaballhaus I call bullshit
@BillWest5 That doesn’t sound good😔
@KevinMKruse Help me!  I don’t see it!
@steveholland1 Sincerely hoping he shows some empathy.
@molly_knight @nycsouthpaw Sure would explain Trump’s mood
@eScarry You were being an asshole and we all saw it.
@eScarry Wow. You are REALLY an asshole
@NoahShachtman @attackerman @ScribblerSix Hurry
@bradheath Any thoughts, Brad?
@ninaburleigh @smerconish @jw33062 @realDonaldTrump We can only hope!
@JeffFlake Please follow through
@ddale8 Wow!  He’s busy tomorrow 🙄
@rebeccaballhaus Something doesn’t seem right about this story. Seems like a setup.
@JamesQueallyLAT @MichaelAvenatti I think he will be exonerated. Who owns TMZ?
@JamesQueallyLAT Thank you!
@JamesQueallyLAT Any proof to the allegations?
@ScottMStedman But, was it from him?  Truly, just feels like a set up he was a huge help in getting Cohen indicted.
@natemcdermott On SUSPICION. That’s really important here.
@yashar On suspicion. His wife said through her lawyer that she hasn’t seen him for months. Sounds like a set up to me
@mj_lee @ScottMStedman SET UP, people!
@Eiggam5955 @RabidRashford @spottedTB @bethannieoakley @passantino @vanityman @CJRosenbaum Agreed. But, TMZ said it was his ex wife
@TopRopeTravis His ex wife put out a statement through her lawyer that there was no assault. Might need to wait this one out. Could be a set up
@PerezHilton His wife put out a statement through her lawyers that he did not assault her. I think we need to wait and see on this one. Could be a set up
@passantino @vanityman @CJRosenbaum Sounded like a set up
@trumphandq @ScottMStedman Dec 14, I think
@Adolf_Trump Did they name him yet?
@daveweigel @maggieNYT @PostScottWilson I just can’t even imagine their heartbreak.
@people Heroes ❤️
@washingtonpost DISTRACTION!
@JessicaHuseman Go run bath water and turn on the fan if it’s getting too much!
@Amy_Siskind Just a DISTRACTION!  Don’t bite!
@JessicaHuseman A hug works in any language. She obviously needs one❤️
@Mimirocah1 @TrumpinTheShark @DRUDGE Okay, but Fox and National Enquirer haven’t tweeted either. What is going on Mimi?  Thoughts?
@LEBassett @SebastianMurdoc I think we have a big indictment coming and everyone is distancing themselves
@DRUDGE_REPORT Matt, why are your tweets gone?
@Adolf_Trump @CNN @MaddowBlog @FBI @HCSOTexas Good work!
@ddale8 Beautiful, isn’t it???
@Amy_Siskind Could be why he just announced he’d talk to DOJ ethics about recusal
@SRuhle Seems like Mueller has this all wrapped up... 👍
@JoyceWhiteVance What if the GJ had Friday off in exchange for working today?  Could have been Mueller’s tactic to throw everyone off...
@AviMayer Stay safe
@emptywheel @dick_nixon Not if it was by Russia
@MarcACaputo Ha!  Good point!
@gregolear Something very odd is going on. Hope we find out what it is this week.
@kylegriffin1 It’s all coming down this week, isn’t it?
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Is Tucker even a member of Farmington?
@TuckerCarlson Do you have the police report to share?
@attackerman How old is she?
@CarrieAnnFonda1 @peacemomma67 @caroleigh21 @AudreyGarden @gregolear @FoxNews @TheAtlantic @RonanFarrow @maddow Sure enough!  It IS gone!
@DafnaLinzer He is truly such an embarrassment
@realDonaldTrump Go to bed, old, orange man
@emptywheel Wow. Good catch
@andylassner I needed this SOOOOO much❤️
@Mimirocah1 @lrozen @abbydphillip He’s a pitiful little man. 😡
@11AliveNews Heartbreaking
@ScottMStedman @GeorgePapa19 Scott, you need to @maddow
@KevinMKruse All of them
@joshscampbell He’s acting like a teacher who has lost control of a classroom
@realDonaldTrump @EmeraldRobinson Deflecting again, honey?
@RudyGiuliani Aww. You were sure of this one, weren’t you?
@TPM Any chance for a recount in Texas?
@wsvn @KevinMKruse Really want them to check Texas
@JCrock_ @nathanTbernard @benshapiro @PrisonPlanet The President did, also. Did you see his tweet?
@MollyJongFast @AlexThomasDC What are you thinking, Molly?
@MairavZ @PeterAlexander ‘s face!
@PhilipinDC @Acosta Look at Sarah and Jared
@emptywheel @maddow
@emptywheel Make this go viral
@KlasfeldReports @Wikipedia @congressedits Excellent work!
@ReutersUS It’s Mueller Time...
@AngrierWHStaff Fox is reporting he’s on his way to the WH now
@ScottMStedman Shit
@rebeccaballhaus Wow. Just wow. He’s such a tiny and vindictive man
@Bencjacobs @skirchy I cannot wait to see what Trump has on him.
@maggieNYT Who asked him that?  It was great!
@JonLemire Something seems really wrong with him today. More so than usual!
@rebeccaballhaus Scared little Trump!
@frankthorp @NBCNews @tedcruz F..k!
@AlexNBCNews @SykesCharlie @SpeakerRyan That’s really sad!
@maggieNYT Good. There is nothing about him that anyone should trust
@JaneMayerNYer Love some good karma!!!
@peterbakernyt Doesn’t seem very “fair and balanced” to me...
@attackerman Ha ha!  That’s great!  Trump just got exposed!
@RudyGiuliani You okay, buddy?
@rebeccaballhaus He is SUCH a pig
@realDonaldTrump I really worried about you, buddy
@mkraju Sure Jan
@SethAbramson Okay, this is scary...
@RudyGiuliani You okay, buddy?
@gabrielsherman He’s really losing his sh— today!
@ScottMStedman Hope this turns out to be your big break!  You deserve it!!!
@TheRickWilson @JacobAWohl This is just so damn funny to watch someone like him get caught
@rebeccaballhaus Such an ass
@MeghanMcCain Losing your Dad is the hardest thing in the world!  A Dad shapes everything about your life. I’m so sorry for all you’re going through, Meghan.
@kylegriffin1 I hate these kind of days. Nothing good EVER comes of it!
@tribelaw This is horrifying
@SteveSchmidtSES It was always going to come with Trump as our “President.” Such a sad time for America
@SteveSchmidtSES Agreed. Sickening
@RudyGiuliani You’re so cute!
@SykesCharlie So scary
@kylegriffin1 She’s absolutely right!
@SteveSchmidtSES Excellent thread!
@kylegriffin1 Shit
RT @kylegriffin1: A lawyer representing The Guardian's Ben Jacobs has sent a letter to Greg Gianforte warning him that he might seek to exi…
@KlasfeldReports Thank you, Adam!
@jacobsoboroff You did speak out, Jacob.
@JoyceWhiteVance Probably because they know what they are doing is wrong!
@maggieNYT Only the best🙄
@kylegriffin1 Jesus
@Pervaizistan @kbriquelet @thedailybeast He is NOT the President!  Who TF cares?
@joshscampbell @mkraju I don’t care about his tax returns. He’s not the President. Focus, people, focus!
@realDonaldTrump You know all about cheating 😉
@kylegriffin1 He’s such a pig
@ananavarro Awe!  Congratulations!!!
@kylegriffin1 What I hate is that you even have to say it! Straight people don’t have to “come out!”  So wrong!  Everyone should just be able to be who they are!
@RudyGiuliani You should probably stop using the word “Mob!”
@kylegriffin1 As a teacher, I will say that his eyes in his class picture, tells it all.
@MiriamElder @juliareinstein It better be to come out and say no
@kaitlancollins @ReporterAndrewJ A little, too late
@mkraju Oh, good to know. I was afraid his wife and kids had to see that scrunched up nose and anger everyday 🙄
@simonamangiante @ScottMStedman So did you work for Mayer and Brown?
@rgoodlaw @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski That’s just unbelievable!! 😡
@ScottJenningsKY They are seeming desperate to me...
@rgoodlaw @ThePlumLineGS @JeffFlake Unbelievable
@CREWcrew Thank YOU!!!!!
@joshgerstein @maggieNYT Wow!  How odd 😂
@awprokop How sad is it that I forgot it was grand jury Friday???
@pdmcleod Graham doesn’t look happy
@seungminkim The woman at the elevator might have changed the course of history today!
@kathygriffin Scrunching his nose
@yashar Shameful
@SenBobCorker @ddale8 Shame!
@maggieNYT Wow
@kylegriffin1 None of us are. Seems like it’s going to be a pivotal time in our nation.
@jeremyherb @maggieNYT Devin in charge of this?
@RonanFarrow Thank you, Ronan!
@brooklynmarie @maggieNYT And did he cheat on her?
@alivitali @alexi I felt lucky, too because I lived
@murphymike @HardballChris Great tweet!!
@GeorgeTakei I really want a picture of John Kelly right now!
@ninaburleigh @lrozen Therapy session with all of watching 🙄
@JohnKasich You are a hero, sir!
@JackiSchechner It’s like he thinks he’s talking to his therapist!
@chrislhayes Ha!  You’re great!!
@ChrisJansing Who was the female reporter who went after Hallie spoke?  She was AMAZING!
@RVAwonk He’s losing it... live, in front of us!
@ddale8 @MichaelAvenatti is going to have a foeld day with this!
@JonLemire Ha!  Good one!
@christinawilkie @jimsciutto Go, Jim!
@jiveDurkey Well, isn’t that just great?
@chrislhayes Worried it’s Rod
@MrFilmkritik Ooh!  Such an excellent point!
@MichaelAvenatti Thank you for your bravery!
@kylegriffin1 So embarrassing
@samstein @yashar @maxwelltani @swin24 @lachlan Bill Shine!!! 😂
@rachael_scar @AdyBarkan We ALL are!
@JessicaTaylor I graduated 30 years ago and we did
@kylegriffin1 This gets sicker by the minute
@yashar Is he allowed to tweet this?
@AndyKroll Yep!
@rgoodlaw Exactly my thought!
@Tom_Winter This is really bad...
@libbycwatson I do
@theshrillest @lpolgreen It’s been a nightmare of a week...  reliving everything. Thank you!
@eorden https://t.co/0vJs6tATuE
@CindyOtis_ 😂😂😂
@emptywheel And has two daughters 😔
@HoarseWisperer And his two daughters
@HotlineJosh Not significant.  No one is under oath
@pwcdanica And the GOP members of the judicial committee is doing just that. Truly sickening!
@PeterAlexander He wouldn’t lie. This is obviously a smear campaign
@svdate We’re going to find out that the electoral college vote was rigged in 2016. Mark my words.
@eorden Good to know. Thanks, Erica!
@PPVSRB Hope he was testifying!
@ScottMStedman So glad you’re back!
@mkraju @ChrisCuomo Prove it, Jay!
@JonLemire Sickening
@ChadPergram Sounds a little panicked
@nypost Probably why he is so insecure
@eliseviebeck My heart aches for her
@kylegriffin1 We ALL are!
@SenBobCorker @ChuckGrassley Shame on you
@mkraju He’s an ass
@MLevineReports FBI agent in Rome sent it to the ORGANIZED CRIME unit. Hello!!!
@KatiePhang Witness intimidation at its finest
@MLevineReports The most important part of the story: https://t.co/GgZWEyMRO9
@VeraMBergen He is such an embarrassment
@kylegriffin1 Also, Kavanaugh has been meeting with him the past two days!
@lrozen Agreed. That’s what is really bothering me right now. Having his daughters show up at a hearing... not an appropriate place for them to be... and the basketball girls. Really creepy
@SenatorCardin @WOMEN4ACAUSE Thank you!
@KenDilanianNBC @YouTube Ha ha ha!
RT @jaketapper: Florence trudges inland, killing at least 7 people	https://t.co/5l7zpxVDqj
@kennerly @SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama @BillClinton @cindymccain Incredible photograph... so moving!
@christinawilkie @nytimes This is just sickening!
@kylegriffin1 Such an embarrassment
@EricBoehlert Unfortunately, I know that 29%
@kylegriffin1 Absolutely not!  What an embarrassment
@mkraju Ha ha ha!
@kenvogel @TrueFactsStated ???
@brianefallon I cannot fathom a woman not being pro choice!
@HowardMortman He had the token twins behind him, but where was the token African American???
@jdawsey1 @maggieNYT He’s still talking????!!!
@ddale8 We are literally watching him have a mental breakdown!  So scary!
@shannonrwatts I cannot wait for the day our nation is ruled by women!
@PostOpinions So very sad for our country!
@KamalaHarris Go get him, Kamala!  And, thank you!!!
@SenKamalaHarris Cannot wait!
@emptywheel There is a reason they are pushing this “family man” angle.
@MarisaKabas This is so odd how they keep emphasizing him being such a family man!  Makes me think something bad is going to come out.
@PeterAlexander @frankthorp So perfect!
@PeterAlexander Great!  Thank you!
@SRuhle @AndyPuzder @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Stephanie!
@realDonaldTrump Everyone knows you’re a bully. Good try, though!
@realDonaldTrump You are probably the one going crazy
@JeffSharlet I can picture myself there!
@maggieNYT No way in hell that the McCain family invited them!
@MrJonCryer Such an odd reaction from Mitch’s wife
@StevenTDennis @frankthorp So agree!
@JoyceWhiteVance If Mueller proves the election was rigged, what happens?
@ZekeJMiller @frankthorp @catherine_lucey Of course he did
@frankthorp @MeghanMcCain Amazing!
@realDonaldTrump Who wrote this tweet for you??
@SethAbramson And Roger Stone used the term, “next up in the barrel “. Interesting!
@esquires1215 @LincolnsBible Thank you!
@LincolnsBible I don’t understand?  Who’s father?
@Schuldensuehner @jonathanvswan Clean up on Aisle Trump!
@WHPublicPool Is there any way that you could post a Trump Daily Schedule with a copy of Obama’s Dauly Schedule for that same day (number of days into both their presidencies) each day?  Would love to see the difference!
@samstein Seriously, what has caused this new infatuation with Google for him?
@thegarance This is a huge story!  Please stay on it!
@JasonLeopold Thanks for staying on this story!
@BeschlossDC Good to know!  😂
@NoahShachtman Now I understand why Trump was tweeting about Chinese hackers.  He was trying to change the narrative
@ShimonPro @kpolantz Zero chance of that happening!
@realDonaldTrump What the hell is wrong with you?
@cbouzy But, how did Mike Pence know who won and tweeted about it earlier?
@RepKarenBass Truly, I’m sad that we still have to have this fight
@christinawilkie Wow!  She just won!  Wonder how he knew?????
@shearm @realDonaldTrump 🤢
@BritainEakin Something is up
@CarolLeonnig @jdawsey1 @NBCNews He’s really starting to sound scared
@cathleendecker @feliciasonmez @jdawsey1 @WPJohnWagner That is EXACTLY it!!!
@HallieJackson @POTUS Afraid he’d go to hell if he didn’t say nice things
@kylegriffin1 Interesting story to surface the same day story about Manafort talking about plea deal with Mueller 🤷‍♀️
@SimonMaloy Why????
@jiveDurkey @nycjim And Melania just keeps smiling for the cameras 🙄
@ThisWeekABC Apparently she’s supposed to clean up for her father?  Disgusting!
@warrenbuffet99 Perfect words to live by!
@kpolantz Ha!  They all use the same tactic!
@SykesCharlie I think the reason he hates McCain is because McCain brought the dossier to the FBI, as he should have done!
@DavidMDrucker He doesn’t even justify a response
@YesYoureRacist @timkmak So maybe take your tweet down
@th3j35t3r Is this true?
@kylegriffin1 Can’t wait to find out Sean Hannity’s connection
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that you are a loser, right?
@neal_katyal @nytimes I agree!
@FrankFigliuzzi1 @WSJ It’s coming... the end to this madness
@RepSpeier Exactly!
@christinawilkie YES!  Rachel covered your lead!
@paulwsj SO WRONG!!!!!  Campaign Finance Violation!  How dare you make this about women!
@MrFilmkritik Thinking Hannity might want to go ahead and confess now
@LannyDavis We thank him!
@markknoller Even Fox?
@EamonJavers Ha!  That’s rich!  😂
@awprokop Plecker better be talking to Mueller
@eorden Who would they be, Erica?
@ZekeJMiller @dsupervilleap That must have been one hell of a ride
@ShimonPro Please let a verdict be coming
@eorden Cohen expected to plead guilty later today.
@ShimonPro Why would he not issue a new verdict form?
@jacobsoboroff @ImmDef @chrislhayes @allinwithchris I am so glad you are covering and staying on this story!
@chrisgeidner Sickening... just sickening!
@YesMomsCan @JohnJHarwood An expert on organized crime is what is bothering Trump!
@RepSwalwell @MichaelRCaputo @realDonaldTrump Apparently you hit a nerve!  😉😉
@RudyGiuliani You just read the NYT story, didn’t you???
@TheBeatWithAri Great interview, Ari.
@realDonaldTrump Ha ha ha. You’re watching @maddow
@mitchellreports @JohnBrennan This is a great interview!
@AdamParkhomenko Makes me feel certain that Cohen has flipped!
@ShimonPro Good decision
@MichaelJMorell @JohnJHarwood Thank you!
@TheBeatWithAri @CNBC Hopefully, he’ll be gone before then
@seanhannity Can you name them?
@Breaking911 Russia and the power grids...
@neal_katyal @WSJ It’s like he wants to be caught
@NBCPolitics They must have something REALLY good on Rand Paul
@JamilSmith @JohnBrennan There he goes projecting again🙄
@nedprice I love this. They are really so stupid
@kaitlancollins And someone was able to talk him out of it last time...
@EamonJavers Now that’s interesting!
@kylegriffin1 What a tiny man
@DavidMDrucker And, that is why...
@KatyTurNBC @JohnBrennan Unbelievable
@big_cases @bradheath   Can you help?
@ShimonPro @MarshallCohen Why are some instructions not necessary anymore?
@JoyceWhiteVance @mikeyavo There is a grand jury meeting, TODAY?
@FoxNews @POTUS You know that’s a lie, right?
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @MarkSteynOnline #Basta!!!
@CBSNews He is such a pig
@Teri_Kanefield I find it interesting that the NDA also included Pence and wife
@awprokop I hope not
@NatashaBertrand Do we know what Brad Parscale is getting a month?
@ZoeTillman He had FOUR affairs?
@GaryGrumbach Do you know who else is on the witness list for today?
@ScottMStedman WE are going to miss you so much!
@counterchekist What does this mean???
@Scout_Finch @BDSEL @seanhannity And Trump has been VERY quiet the last few days!!
@mfletcher530 @JoyceWhiteVance Ha ha!!!
@CREWcrew Thank you!!!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Huh. I don’t see it on the best seller list
@McFaul This is beyond creepy!
@KellyO @realDonaldTrump He’s just a disgusting pig who has sold our country
@greta @trumps_feed Which Mika clarified
@zackwhittaker Any announcement yet?
@JoyceWhiteVance ❤️❤️❤️
Someone needs to look into what Don Jr was doing and where he was, the week he said he didn’t want Secret Service coverage!  @maddow
@Acosta YOU!  Are a hero!!!
@_DanMangan Any idea how long the trial will last?
@MichaelAvenatti What does this mean?
@MrFilmkritik That’s just funny!!!
@ENBrown Can’t sleep
@sam_vinograd @brianstelter @POTUS He’s golfing!!
@jacobsoboroff @KatyTurNBC Thank you for the important work you are doing!
@RawStory @Mimirocah1 I cannot wait to see the day he is dragged away and crying
@pbump Keep going!  This is important!
@EricBowser @CNN @donlemon @MSNBC @Lawrence Let’s hope it’s Don JR
@kylegriffin1 Watching Ivanka and Melania as he speaks... they knew, too
@RLHeinrichs @DianneG And honestly, the timing of this seems odd with all else that is going on tonight
@cbouzy Sam’s story or another one, too??
@samstein That IS a big story!
@atrupar Wait until he finds out about his accountant!
@HoarseWisperer This is beautiful!
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump He’s a small, scared, little man
@mikememoli @DevinNunes Did Jordan or Meadows?
@darth Exactly. What a jerk!
@farhip @PeggyMcGlone I bet SHE wants to attend!
@pwnallthethings It was a great article!
@Rick_Horowitz @artrelly Exactly. And sounded like he said Pam at the end of the call.  Pam Bondi?
@soychicka Pam Bondi?
@LannyDavis @MichaelCohen212 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Great job!
@realDonaldTrump You started this trade war, you jerk!
@AliceOllstein You’re awesome!
@kylegriffin1 @RobbinSimmons7 Can they legally do that?
@ericgeller I think we all know why and it should scare all of us!
@cathleendecker Is that even allowed?
@josephparis Something doesn’t seem good about this, at all
@kaitlancollins She knows she’s going to prison...
@MichaelOrton @SRuhle Indeed!
@bfrist Thank you for writing this article. It’s so important!
@burgessev What happened???
@RogueFirstLady Please promise us that you’ll reveal yourself once Trump goes to prison!
@jljacobson @Lawrence @jheil This needs to go viral
@kylegriffin1 Why don’t Republicans care about any of this???
@RepAdamSchiff So, basically, they’re admitting to collusion !
@AdamParkhomenko Today has felt overwhelming!  So glad to know I have day 8 Twitter posts to look forward to!
@TheBeatWithAri @Mimirocah1 Agreed. If I was his wife or daughters, I’d be terrified
@etuckerAP No words...
@ShimonPro @KaraScannell Sure hope one is with Hannity
@ChrisMegerian Who asked the question?  Someone must have been given a heads up to ask it
@renato_mariotti Maybe now that Manafort knows who  the 5 witnesses are, it’ll give him time to reconsider and flip?
@politvidchannel John Brennan just named as a witness in Manafort trial🙄
@benjaminwittes Can trump actually do that?
@toddgillman @PressSec H ha ha
@PreetBharara It’s just noise in my head. Easy to block out
@_MaHouTsuKai_3 @politico His son in law for sure
@TomKludt This is just so sad
@rachelweinerwp Did they name the witnesses?
@Jim_Jordan You scared, Jimmy?
@CourthouseNews Something big must be coming and he knows it!
@jentaub @OrinKerr I think he didn’t like being welcomed home with chants of “Lock him up!”
@RickSmithShow Thanks, Rick!
@RickSmithShow What even brought this on??
@RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump ❤️❤️
@AdamParkhomenko The Kremlin Annex name is pure genius!
@MSNBC This is horrible!
@feliciasonmez @POTUS Were they holding hands?
@AdamParkhomenko Did Melania travel with Trump this weekend?
@markfollman Mana fort trial this week...
@SethAbramson What about Tillison?
@sam_vinograd @mkraju @apalmerdc @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Interesting that he wouldn’t answer Jake about if he was involved with helping to lift sanctions
@AlexWitt @Isikoff Excellent interview!
@realDonaldTrump You doing okay, honey?
@MrJonCryer Has he flipped?
@bradheath Wow. Just wow
@krassenstein @Giants Excellent!
@CahnEmily Oh my gosh!  So precious!
@MichaelRCaputo @CheriJacobus Why so nervous?
@jonathanvswan @ShaneGoldmacher This is AWESOME!
@AdamParkhomenko Ha!  God, I love you!
@HoarseWisperer Since when is Fox ethical?
@emilyjanefox @JayRCallahan @maddow It looked so pretty on you!
@woodruffbets I think we all think that, too!
@ChrisMegerian So, it’s not Stone’s time in the barrel yet, apparently
@Scavino45 Ass
@frankthorp @SenatorTimScott @marcorubio THIS is what America is supposed to look like!
@KatyTurNBC @NBCNewsPR You are precious!
@MaddowBlog Fantastic interview!  Sally Yates is an American hero!
@ScottMStedman And, don’t forget about Pence being pushed by Manafort for VP
@Phil_Lewis_ NOOOOOO!!!!!
@mbieseck @AP I’m assuming that Mueller already has them!
@ZoeTillman @VeraMBergen What time is her hearing today?
@AlexSanz @lomikriel @realDonaldTrump Except it wasn’t an error. It was a LIE!
@EllenKurz @AdamParkhomenko @DevinNunes And no comment on Trump from yesterday
@svdate @NatashaBertrand Ha ha ha!!!
@NTarnopolsky Be safe!
@mkraju Guess he thinks that keeps him safe from Putin
@ReutersPolitics Same day as Manafort trial!
@christinawilkie Nuclear WARMING???
@AshaRangappa_ That’s what he’ll be promoting tomorrow with his meeting with the Senators
@JoaquinCastrotx Thank you!!!
@joshtpm He knows he messed up royally today. Tomorrow is his chance to spin the story!
@ScottMStedman @SisterChromatid @psychopompology @addiegabriel Would be great if it was Hannity!!! 😂
@anniekarni @jeffmason1 @JonLemire American heroes!
@markfollman Don Jr had a private dinner with her...
@NiallStanage Very odd
@andylassner @billprady That’s what I’m afraid of, too!
@andylassner @billprady Do you think if Trump is proven to be a participant of the underage crew, that his base will finally say enough?
@RepLeeZeldin Wow, you’re pretty stupid
@katierogers @jdawsey1 It sure seems like it in America, doesn’t it?
@BritainEakin @proflevin Guarantee you that he has a domestic violence background...
@emptywheel Marcy, here is a question. If they find that the whole election was a sham, what happens?  Does everyone appointed by Trump lose their jobs?  Do we have a new emergency election?
@emptywheel @Sam201810 Is it bad for US???
@RT_com You ass...  looks like MS
@kurteichenwald It’s a horrible thing when people have to cheat to win... especially with Russia!
@YouKnowMoreNow @AriMelber @RichardEngel @OARichardEngel Agreed!
@juliaioffe @danpfeiffer Is there a link to the complete indictment?
@ZoeTillman @kevincollier @mikefarb1 has been studying this since right after the election!
@LouDobbs @allahpundit @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Wow. How dare you not Cate about your fellow Americans!  Im ashamed that you are even a tv entertainer!
@vermontgmg He also ran for Congress in 2016. Wonder if that’s who Mueller is referring to in the indictment?
@mikememoli Hmmm.  Sounds as if he has departed from the dark side!
@LisaBloom I’m secretly hoping that after her “hospital stay” she has been working for Mueller and is wearing a wire!
@RepRatcliffe @jasoninthehouse You, sir, are an ass. I’d love to see your phone records!
@stengel He is to us, too!
@CNBC Ha ha!  He was already supposed to have done that!
@NormOrnstein And the texts between Guilianni and Hannity!
@jeremyherb He probably knows what the FBI has on Goodlatte!
@thehill @pdacosta But wait!  Trump said he had full clearance!!! 🙄
@kyledcheney He did an amazing job standing up to the bullies!
@mkraju This is such a joke
@RepKHandel @HouseJudiciary Wow... you are a real jerk
@davidcicilline You are my hero!!!
@Newsweek What a piece of s___
@marinafang That was GREAT!
@RawStory Shep is the only one worth watching on Fox. He’s a REAL journalist!
@RepTedLieu @POTUS I love you, Ted!
@PeterAlexander Unbelievable
@kpolantz Will he be moved today?
@AriMelber Poor Trump is going to lose a lot of followers!
@rebeccaballhaus @bykowicz Something is very fishy about all of this!
@FoxNews @AlanDersh Ha ha ha!!!
@chrisgeidner Have a good time. Well deserved!
@CNNSitRoom @DanaBashCNN Disgusting!
@ClareHymes22 @kathrynw5 Will the judge allow him to stay?
@ZoeTillman Alexandria would not be a friendly place for him!
@SethAbramson Sounds just like what his “doctor “ said about him being the healthiest Presidential candidate ever!
@ScottMStedman Maybe he’s there for a reason?  As in to help Mueller?
@flornurse @kpolantz @RitaWil92435229 Northern Neck is much safer for someone like him
@Roslynbooks @dfriedman33 @lrozen Most likely because he’s been helpful and cooperative!
@yashar He’s the one who won’t sit for a Mueller interview!
@AaronBlake That statement sounded exactly like the words of Trump
@jonathanchait Excellent article @maddow
@MichaelAvenatti Your nickname needs to be “Tiger!”
@emptywheel Distraction???
@JamesKosur Of course that is what’s going on!  No coincidence at all!!!  Bring Trump down!
@CheriJacobus @DonaldJTrumpJr There’s a big difference between Republicans and TRUMPIANS!!!
@MattLaCasse Sure hope you find him!! ❤️
@karencollinsnyc @AuthorKimberley @sarahkendzior @highbrow_nobrow What is it??
@yashar @natemcdermott Why are you peddling this story?  I’ve thought better of you!
@EricLiptonNYT Thanks, Eric!!!
@Zigmanfreud @stuartpstevens @allahpundit Oh!  I guess you were there!!!  Thanks for your comments!  You go! 🙄🙄🙄
@NunbergSam @SenWarren Sam, stop, just stop. Why would you still be throwing support to such a despicable man?  You ARE better than this!
@ChadPergram Ha!  The good old “locker room defense!”
@BritainEakin He’s really feeling desperate, isn’t he?
@chrisinsilico @sarah_donaldson @Dazed @shahmiruk Heroes!!!!! ❤️❤️
@pwgphoto We are all in this together!
@kpolantz He probably doesn’t even understand any of this 🙄🙄
@ReporterAndrewJ @brianstelter Absolutely!  And we’re a thankful nation!
@pwgphoto When I was raped, I remember getting back my clothes. I know what an awful feeling it is to get something back from a crime. I’m so sorry you’re having to go through it!
@mayawiley This is so sad
@chrisgeidner He is such a pig
@MaryAngelaPerna @Sofffffttie @emptywheel Wait, so Louise is saying Marcy wrote the text to herself???
@CREWcrew Not to Mueller!!! 😉
@byrdinator @EvanWilt_ @KitKat_US Awe!!!!  Congratulations!!!
@politico Please change your headline to include the whole story!
@AaronBlake This is awesome and is what needs to be done each time a conspiracy theory is debunked!
@big_cases @ZoeTillman , what does this mean?
@NewYorkStateAG @ninaandtito Thank you!!
@RyanLizza @realDonaldTrump And nothing about Michael Cohen...  curious!
@oneunderscore__ Me, too, Ben, me, too!
@OhNoSheTwitnt Spot on!
@oneunderscore__ Makes you wish the world was simpler?
@Amy_Siskind @JoyceWhiteVance He’s just going to say he’s innocent
@realDonaldTrump You are such a NOTHING!  No one cares!
@LarrySabato Mueller really needs to hurry up!
@PaulCraigRobert @JulianAssange @wikileaks Ha ha ha!  Good one!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @trumps_feed You’re going to jail, honey! No one cares what you tweet!
@realDonaldTrump What the hell is wrong with you?
@Ocasio2024 @chrislhayes So proud of you!!!
@eugenegu I bet @MichaelAvenatti would take your case!
@RepKathleenRice Thank you!
@frankthorp @MarshallCohen @SenatorHassan That’s all that’s needed. Good for her!
@atrupar Aaron, I love you and what you tweet! But, I’m thinking it’s time we stop quoting Trump and his propaganda. Agree?
@kylegriffin1 Probably why Trump is going off the rails
@SenSchumer @NYCPride Beautiful!
RT @ananavarro: Some who defend baker’s right to refuse service to gay couples, whine re ppl refusing service to a person who’s the face of…
@ManInTheHoody @TomArnold Who is Ashley’s stepdad???
@mikefarb1 I’d bet Ryan, Huckabee, Nunes, Graham

@BillWeirCNN @KateBennett_DC Kate????
@CharlesMBlow Just noise in our heads... that is all
@NBChristinaGinn @VelshiRuhle @SRuhle @jacobsoboroff @CalNBC @gabegutierrez @marianaatencio Virginia also
@KatyTurNBC @JuliaEAinsley Probably because they don’t know who they belong to!
@ShaneGoldmacher Obstruction???
@brianstelter Trump is going to start going crazy when people stop believing his lies. This will be fun to watch!
@CharlesPPierce Just need to say that her tweet was from a couple of years ago. Please report that info
@JuddLegum Who does this????  What a sorry excuse for a man!
@rolandscahill Exactly
@davidfrum He is seeming very whiny!
@MikeScarcella Ha ha ha
@Fahrenthold I’m so impressed at how you started investigating all of this over a year ago!  Today makes all that effort for you worth it, I am sure!  Well done and thank you!
@shannonrwatts Love this!!!
@tedlieu @PressSec @CBSNews Is this one of their fake leaks to try to catch the leaker?
@GOPChairwoman @Zigmanfreud @realDonaldTrump Are you really this stupid?
@CheriJacobus Horrific
@jacobsoboroff @HHSGov @chrislhayes That’s just disgusting
@NatashaBertrand I can’t imagine that they would “make a mistake!”  Might have been intentional!
@NatashaBertrand Those journalists are patriots!
@BetoORourke God, I hope you win!  America needs you!
@guardian The pot calling the kettle...
@BillKristol This is SO creepy!  This isn’t a tv show!
@kyledcheney 😂
@renato_mariotti But won’t WE find out those names?
@AmyLaurenSomers @allie1love2 @JoyceWhiteVance Wondering about Jason Chaffetz
@allie1love2 @JoyceWhiteVance I’ll be interested to see if any Politicians are named!
@allie1love2 @JoyceWhiteVance That’s what it sounds like!
@JoyceWhiteVance This might be VERY interesting!
@byPeteVernon @oliverdarcy Maddie has a doctorate degree. I wouldn’t call her an opinion reporter
@fran_chambers Well then he needs to stop killing people
@AlBoeNEWS He sounds scared
@ReaganWorld He seems scared and over his head
@Teri_Kanefield Your thread is terrifying!
@TAPAlerts Unbelievable 😡
@Comey I needed that. Thank you
@emilyjanefox She definitely sees herself as First Lady
@yashar @YouKnowMoreNow Might be time to take to the streets!
@realDonaldTrump Sadly, you don’t understand any of this, do you?
@matthewamiller Oh God, you just made me burst out laughing!!!
@TeamGulley @IsaacDovere Sorry!!
@TeamGulley @IsaacDovere She was never President. She wasn’t impeached 🙄
@BradMossEsq Guilty AF!
@IsaacDovere And, was it when Clinton was President?
@IsaacDovere Do you have proof of this claim?
@ScottMStedman Devin???
@KaivanShroff Melania didn’t play the game!
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber @KasieDC Cannot wait to hear your take on this tonight!

@politico I call bull. She won’t show
@lcsenecal @justinjm1 @thedailybeast @TIMESUPNOW Thank you for bravely sharing your story!
@brianstelter @JerryDunleavy @CNBC @EamonJavers @FLOTUS And, she won’t be seen tomorrow either. Closed press.
@RobbinSimmons7 So no pictures, and she could end up not being there...
@LauraLitvan You’re the only one reporting this. Any confirmation?
@bristow72 @TrueFactsStated Me too
@DianneG @jimmyfallon What an unbelievable gift to these students who have suffered so much!
@MeetThePress @RudyGiuliani Just shaking my head on this one...
@HoarseWisperer @OverUnderClover I’d say that Trump has been called in by Mueller for this to be released today
@DamianAnnabelle @Acosta Exactly right
@kylegriffin1 Doesn’t look like he’s getting much work done...
@DerBaasti @dog_feelings And so needed right now!!!
@JuliaDavisNews Does it worry anyone else that Trump has no idea what he’s doing and is meeting with the leaders of other countries?
@GaryGrumbach @MorganRadford This was horrific
@WSJ These people need to spend an entire week TEACHING in one class...
@kylegriffin1 Makes me think Roger has flipped
@MarkSZaidEsq @Elise_Jordan Swearing about someone and calling someone a racist slur are two VERY different things
@RogueFirstLady Your account is Be Best!  Love seeing your tweets!
@realDonaldTrump Where’s Melania????
@politico She’s gone...
@CillizzaCNN Andnow we know for sure why McCabe was fired
@dfriedman33 Correct

@mkraju This is so, so wrong
@seungminkim Good job, Schumer!
@uofmf4l @renato_mariotti Maybe now working FOR Mueller
@AmyMcGrathKY So very excited for you!!!
@marclacey @tripgabriel This needs to stop
@matthewamiller Hopefully he talked to Mueller about this before he put out the statement!
@DanRather @JWGOP Mueller knows...
@waltshaub @AshaRangappa_ And because of him, our children got Betsy🙄
@PalmerReport Love letter to coal😂
@TheGlare_TM @jdawsey1 Yep. Met with Pompeo today too
@kylegriffin1 Ha ha ha
@kyledcheney Sure feels like something is going on at the White House this week... no press briefings, etc.
@mkraju Something is happening...
@funder Yeah, that’s the way most couples would do it🙄
@kaitlancollins Big of him🙄
@AndrewFeinberg @JuddApatow Apparently runs in the family!
@ShaneGoldmacher @OverUnderClover Funny, how we all knew who was behind the release of the story
@CharlesMBlow Pretty scary, isn’t it?
@W7VOA Unbelievable!  Don’t they know people will check?
@WilDonnelly Really thought there would be one today!!!
@CarolLeonnig @brooklynmarie @washingtonpost Ha ha ha!!!!
@eorden Would be interesting to trace those 35K monthly payments...  although I’m sure that Mueller already has...
@PalmerReport I think he’s working with Mueller
@JoyceWhiteVance Exactly 🙄🙄
@samstein Boy, is that a message to Cohen or what????
@matthewamiller Goodbye Jared!
@HoarseWisperer Mine is Stephen Miller. He was seen Outside of the Post earlier today
@kylegriffin1 @maddow Perhaps because SC already has all they need on that front
@ShimonPro Which is why things are leaking about Kelly today🙄
@andylassner Now we know why things are being leaked about Kelly today. He knew!
@AndrewFeinberg @swin24 @samstein Where can we find it?
@lachlan Hope they send them to jail
@TheBlastNews @kanyewest Is he manic?  Sure seems like it
@DavidNakamura @FLOTUS @erinschaff The Floating Hat!

@michaelkruse @POLITICOMag This is really eye opening!  Fantastic article!
@KattyKayBBC Trump just looks so happy to have a friend!
@soledadobrien You’re right, but it sure has changed my view of her.
@ShaniaTwain @Civldisobedient That might not been what you meant, but it’s what you said... sad and disappointing
@Garossino Right?  Hillary much?
@jayrosen_nyu @JamilSmith This is truly frightening
RT @JoyceWhiteVance: This, from he who gave classified information to the Russians in an Oval Office meeting. https://t.co/77EUrnzf1L

@thedailybeast @scottbix You think???? 😂😂
@Dannymakkisyria I’m so sorry. Please stay safe!
@passantino So not good
@tarapalmeri Is it VP’s hotel or just any hotel?
@aletweetsnews What do you think it is?
@kyledcheney What do you think, Kyle?
@ChadPergram There is if Nunes is involved
@bradheath @DelWilber If it doesn’t involve Trump, why was his lawyer there?
@allicat1214 @eorden Excellent thought!
@ZerlinaMaxwell I hope Mueller strikes first
@AdamParkhomenko 😂😂
@maggieNYT @stevecuozzo John Baron?

@cbouzy Maybe something more will still break later today. We can only hope!

@RealPressSecBot He’s such a jerk
@realDonaldTrump Oh shut up
@MichaelAvenatti You are AWESOME!
@MiekeEoyang @Slate He had a man who was hard of hearing transcribe the tapes! 😂

@CillizzaCNN Geez! 🙄🙄🙄
@RepTedLieu @RepDonBeyer He needs to be out of the White House... period!
@guardian Excellent article!
@KenDilanianNBC @AliWatkins But he did admit to floating around a hard drive.
@TeaPainUSA Interesting that the Russian in the meeting was tried for a computer hacking case, and after the meeting, Trump tweeted about emails

@__MaryGelinas__ @dcexaminer @_Hope2017 Sessions was under investigation...  if he took an oath to uphold the constitution, as he did, he should not resign. Do you understand now?
@nycsouthpaw @joncoopertweets None of these people will be able to get jobs at the end of all this...
@__MaryGelinas__ @dcexaminer @_Hope2017 Hey honey...  he didn't release it until after he was a private citizen...  can you understand that now?

@NicolleDWallace love what you've done with your hair!
@maddow That was the strangest thing I have ever seen!
@chrislhayes Honestly, he seemed like he was drugged... slurring and calling Comey the President!
@JoyAnnReid He even called Comey the President...  he seemed drugged!
@NatashaBertrand It's making no sense!!!
@MatthewNussbaum Russia has nothing to do with Hillary. What is he talking about?
@emptywheel Right?  I'm so disappointed in what he's doing!

@FoxNews Realize how stupid your network looks?  You keep going back to beat a dead horse... yet there are many things you should be reporting now!
@Alyssa_Milano Great analysis!!!
@thehill Of course because the only thing Trump knows to do, is to reverse everything from Obama...  such a leader🙄
@Amy_Siskind I think they all know something big is coming!
@WillPresti @WOMEN4ACAUSE Ha!!!  This is GREAT!!!
@TerryMcAuliffe Thank you!!!!
@emills28 @TrueFactsStated You guessed it...  31.6
@mkraju @BradMossEsq I think they're getting as sick of Trump as we are!
@jedshug Interesting, right?  Our President is a bigot!
@joncoopertweets Hopefully the Mueller investigation can take this fuller!
@emills28 @TrueFactsStated Just hit 31.5 🙄
@emills28 @TrueFactsStated Which means bots are out in full force!
@emills28 @TrueFactsStated Ha!!!  So tomorrow, 31.5?
@DailyCaller What a jerk
@pacelattin This makes me ill

@CeylanWrites @brianstelter That's a really cold thing to say...
@ReutersPolitics So NOT presidential...  immediately made it about him!
@realDonaldTrump You are SUCH a selfish prick!  Where's your sympathy???
@PalmerReport He's the master of distraction... in so many ways!  SAD!

@emills28 @TrueFactsStated How stupid does he think the American people are???
@Alyssa_Milano I LOVE what you're doing, Alyssa!!!!  Thank you!
@thedailybeast So thankful you are still on air and telling the truth, @Lawrence !!!
@JoeNBC So ready for it to be completely black!
@AriMelber so is there any way that they can put Trump in prison if they find he obstructed justice?  Or does he just get impeached?
@Impeach_D_Trump @_Hope2017 It's pretty obvious!  He's trying to un do anything Obama...
@thehill Wonder who helped finance the mansion?
@JenniferJJacobs @joncoopertweets I hope they try because that will just show how scared he is!  No reason not to let someone testify if you're innocent!
@kylegriffin1 Can't wait to see them😂😂
@politico Oh thank goodness!  Because I absolutely trust what he says!  🙄🙄
@ZekeJMiller @NBCNews So Putin is basically admitting what they did...
@DanRather @Lawrence @MSNBC You, sir, are amazing!
@chrisgeidner He is crazy, just absolutely crazy!
@lawrencehurley @danielle_ivory Oh come on!!!
@SteveKopack What????
@DanRather @Lawrence @MSNBC Remember when we thought O.J. was the trial of the century?  I don't think we've seen it yet!
@AshleyRParker Seriously, what is wrong with this man???!!!
@TrueFactsStated Just as a side note...  notice that Trump is now up to 31.1 followers 🙄
@rebeccaballhaus That is really too funny!
@CharlesMBlow Unfortunately, Trump's base will never hear that...  they will just think he's getting a better deal!
@DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/SLDvBXMbY8
@DavidJollyFL @NicolleDWallace @POTUS @MSNBC That was awesome!😉
@SenSanders HE is an international disgrace
@JenniferJJacobs Russian guest?
@brianstelter Right?  He always seems to "hear" the insider information...
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Keep telling yourselves that...
@MikeLevinCA How long do I have to stay up here until they go away?
@AndrewBeatty He always seems to KNOW things before they are announced...  hmmm😳
@ezlusztig Let him ramble. That's when he gets himself in trouble and we get to see what's REALLY inside his mind!
@maggieNYT He's not doing what is right for our country, he just wants them to think he's a winner so they'll stop laughing at him!  Unbelievable!
@RobbieGramer So this is all about him being laughed at and has NOTHING to do with what is right for our country!!!
@Sarah_Boxer @realDonaldTrump They aren't laughing at America!  They have been and continue to be laughing at TRUMP!
@lesleyclark So now it's the Democrats fault ?  🙄🙄
@K8brannen Wow...
@MikeLevinCA Correct!
@MeetThePress And it's shockingly evident!
@HiMaui @ukexpat19 @maddow Glad you're staying @Lawrence !  We need you!
I didn't believe the stuff about Trump gaining followers from yesterday. He was 30.9 million yesterday and 31 million today. 🙄🙄🙄
@thehill Why the need to lie?
@JoyAnnReid No surprise!!!  Just showing the influence Russia has on our President!  Scary and sad!
@FoxNews @KatrinaPierson @LaraLeaTrump How will you and the kids handle Eric being in jail?
@Fusion Ha!  According to his lawyer, he has NEVER pulled out😳
@amjoyshow @ukexpat19 @JoyAnnReid So proud of you!!!!  You rock!
@Lawrence @wemesq @maddow We NEED YOU!!!
@Lawrence @wemesq @maddow BEST news I've heard all night!!!!
@realDonaldTrump @Evan_McMullin you need to take some time to get better!!!  I can tell you're sick!  Rest!  Everything will be here a few days from now!
@TedCGoodman @DailyCaller Good luck in your chosen career
@washingtonpost Of course!  Why be ethical?
@ShaunKing And I think that eventually we'll find out how much Trump and Russia influenced this election... sadly!
@BraddJaffy THIS is America!
@seanhannity No
@DonaldJTrumpJr @mflynnJR Scared little Donnie!  Your poor kids...  seeing you and grandpa behind bars will be so hard!  Good luck with that, sweetie!
@yashar @bendreyfuss She was AWESOME!  Too bad we can't trust the President to be honest like Hillary!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Up almost 100K in a day😂😂
@realDonaldTrump Hey, how did you gain almost 100K followers since yesterday?  BOT much???  😂😂😂
@realDonaldTrump Aww. Hillary got more likes on her tweet than you did!  Too bad, so SAD!
@realDonaldTrump You are a weak, weak leader!
That's not leadership...  it's being a follower because you have no ideas of your own @realDonaldTrump !
Have you noticed that the only thing Trump seems able to do is to TRY to reverse all of Obama's gains?
@Zigmanfreud @TMZ @POTUS Sad thing is that I used to like TMZ until I knew they were colluding with Trump!
@W7VOA @WhiteHouse @KellyAnnPolls Shocking 🙄
@yashar @JasonMillerinDC What a pig...
@yashar Need to start calling him what HE is... Treasonous Trump!
@NicolleDWallace @HillaryClinton Love a woman who can throw shade!!!
@BraddJaffy I love a woman who knows how to throw shade!
@NPR What a jerk...  our climate verses his ratings!
@TrickOrTreackle @ukexpat19 This is AWESOME!
@CREWcrew Well, that's good to know 🙄🙄
@mitchellreports The walls are closing in on him...
@TedCGoodman @DailyCaller You realize you just quoted an article from the Daily Caller, right?
@thehill Only with Russian help again!
@jamespmanley @aravosis Trump must have asked Nunes for a favor🙄
@pacelattin 🙄🙄🙄
@LLH713 @annalecta @lachlan @politicoalex You poor thing...
@orlandosentinel This must have been so terrifying for all involved 😔
@annalecta @lachlan @politicoalex He needs to be worrying about our country right now... but no, of course, we get this instead!
@AdamBlickstein Amazing, isn't it?
@kylegriffin1 Not shocking at all!
@vplus Such poetic words coming from Trump 🙄
@PeterAlexander @epngo And in other words, he just admitted that the meeting happened!
@brianschatz @womensmarch
@lrozen Seems to be the same day Trump paraded Kanye
@johncusack Guess he gets it naturally?  🙄🙄
@DebraMessing Every state needs to do this!!!
@SarahLSmith677 What's really sad is that if we had a REAL president, that president wouldn't let there be so much hatred, violence, and fear!
@PalmerReport Yes. That's been obvious for awhile!
@ddiamond "Everything I ever needed to know, I learned in Kindergarten ". Seems like a good place for him to start...
@Slate You can now add the Texan rep to this list
@BraddJaffy All this hatred and fear has got to stop!
@DianneG @statesman So much hate happening the last year and a half...  when will it stop?
@yashar Straight jacket time, Donnie!
@kylegriffin1 The only thing he'll tweet will be about himself or the Russians...
@SethAbramson Exorcism, apparently!  Sure hope it works!
@thehill Well, isn't that just shocking!  🙄🙄
@yashar No worries... just performing an exorcism!
@RobbinSimmons7 @wsvn Exorcism???  We can only hope!
@SarahLSmith677 I wound guess you'd find a lot of Russian money launderers there!
@nytimesworld Oh, please🙄🙄🙄
@matthewamiller He couldn't even let us have until Monday!  🙄
@tonyposnanski Ha!  Wouldn't that be great!!
@JoyAnnReid @ericgarland That somehow seems very wrong...
@KellyannePolls @HillaryClinton You do realize hat the Washington Examiner is fake news, right?
@thehill Jared's kiss of death, right there!
@jaketapper I think we are past there!
@JonahNRO @Donna_West It was so much nicer when he was away and he didn't have to hear from him!
PLEASE let Melania be the leaker!!
@nytopinion He's as guilty as the rest of them!
@politico @realDonaldTrump Ha ha ha!!!
@donnabrazile NO ONE better think he wasn't a part of all this!  Just as bad as Trump!  And Ivanka KNEW!  There all so pathetic!
@donnabrazile Makes me so sad and mad!  They died trying to do the right thing!
@TrueFactsStated Russia?
@TrueFactsStated Not sure I agree with that!  I think they're both complicit
@RepSwalwell I love you!  Thanks for being a strong advocate!
@RogerJStoneJr @CLewandowski_ @costareports Being serious here...   do you trust him?
@RogerJStoneJr @CLewandowski_ @costareports Why do you not like him?
@politico Because there never should have been a suit!
@JacobAWohl @mflynnJR @JackPosobiec @KamVTV @bakedalaska @AmericanMex067 @aaronjcarpenter @PolitiDiva @BasedMonitored @cristinalaila1 @DavidWohl You sad your Daddy is going to jail???
@DrDenaGrayson Shocking!!!  NOT!
@stuartpstevens Probably because the Republicans realize what a mistake they made!
@BuzzFeedNews Heroes...  plain and simple!  So grateful for them!
@joncoopertweets We can only hope it comes soon!  I'd be getting as far away from Trump as I could!
@HallieJackson @NBCNews @NBCNewsPR @NBCNightlyNews @locamama @staceypklein @KellyO @kristindonnelly @kwelkernbc You are all beautiful, smart, and persistent!!!  Thanks for all you do!!
@TimOBrien @maggieNYT @GlennThrush Perhaps he thinks if he leaves, he'll avoid jail!
@W7VOA SAD!!!!!
@justinjm1 Oh thank goodness!  What a relief 🙄🙄🙄
@jaketapper @ShaunKing This makes me so utterly sad and disgusted
@lrozen Ha!!!!  I haven't been online for about 6 hours...  what a difference 6 hours make?
@IvankaTrump @GOPLeader How are feeling about the Jared news?  Do you deny it?
@KenDilanianNBC @Tom_Winter Truly, thank God for the leakers!
@tedlieu And he had a back channel to Russia. Absolutely nothing to look at, right?🙄🙄
@Alyssa_Milano @jaredkushner As much as I WANT to say that's true, it's not...
@Alyssa_Milano I just keep singing that song, "he's going down, down, down!  Another one bites the dust!"
@jason_howerton @seanhannity NOT his decision to make! 😂
@HeerJeet Oh wait...  that's Trump!
@PreetBharara You rock!
@johncardillo @mflynnJR @USAA @seanhannity He just needs to report REAL news and he could probably stay on!  But then, you wouldn't watch it!
@MelissaJPeltier @DrDenaGrayson Trump happened...  so very sad that people have lost their principles
@seanhannity @mflynnJR Hey, hey, hey...  goodbye!!!
@CNNPolitics That is really sad for our country...
@JoyAnnReid This is truly so embarrassing for our country!
When you realize your husband has ties to Russia... https://t.co/nJLj9chQzE
@TheViewFromLL2 Ah...  I was logged in when I found you!
@JoyAnnReid just want you to know that I always enjoy watching you!  You're fun and smart!
@TheViewFromLL2 Susan, I just searched for you and found you!
@MarkHertling @aliasvaughn @ChelseaClinton She's awesome!!!
@yashar @kimguilfoyle FINALLY!
@MalcolmNance @Shakestweetz Let the spills begin!
@Nate_Cohn That makes me ill!
@mckaycoppins 1/3, I believe
@markknoller @JohnJHarwood Wonder how much he paid her to do that?
@tedlieu Seems like everyone's security clearance must be suspended in this White House!  How sad is that?  This is supposed to be America!
@ABC We're working on it, Donnie!  You're being watched!
@newsmax He's too much of a great man...
@ABC As of tonight...
@JoyAnnReid After he was done shoving, he looked like a turkey strutting...  such an embarrassment!
@ChelseaClinton @ezlusztig Pretty pathetic, isn't it?
@molly_knight Have you seen the video of him shoving the PM to get to the front of the crowd, yet?
@SkyNews @realDonaldTrump Truly, America apologizes!
@cbouzy Ha ha!  That was great!
@gregpinelo @20committee Putin asked Trump to intimidate him, I suppose... 🙄
@joncoopertweets @BenSasse could you teach civics to him, too?
@ezlusztig The bully known throughout the world!
RT @SteveKopack: Did Trump just shove another NATO leader to be in the front of the group? https://t.co/bL1r2auELd
@SteveKopack Do we know who the guy he shoved away is?
@JamilSmith This tweet needs to go viral!
@BraddJaffy He is just unbelievable!  What a bully he is!
@KThomasDC Unbelievable! Just unbelievable!
@tedlieu You must be great to work with!!!!
@AlexKoppelman @SykesCharlie @seanhannity @oliverdarcy Pretty scary how easy it is to mislead some people...  the fake news stories really need to be stopped!
@matthewjdowd I feel like light is starting to come back into our country!
@RobPulseNews This is hysterical 😭
@CNNPolitics Nor did Jared...  or Flynn, or Manafort, etc, etc
@TheAtlantic @russellberman 😳😳😳😳😳
@seanhannity I remember when O'Reilly went on his "planned" vacation, too!
@CatchaRUSSpy What?????
@RogerJStoneJr @seanhannity @KimDotcom Roger, Roger, Roger...
@chrislhayes Hoping someone got a video. Justice for Ben!
@Elxnder @CBSNews Ah, you are correct!!! https://t.co/k7ayqq3vHz
@Elxnder @CBSNews She says she's fluent in that, too!
@Hadas_Gold Is he still a rep?
@KatyTurNBC @stuartpstevens Truly, we never had this kind of self righteous violence until Trump's campaign events and Presidency!  So sickening!
@peterdaou @lauferlaw I think we now know why Reince and Steve Bannon came home early!
@seanhannity Sean, you can't be mean to people and bully grieving families...  you reap what you sow!
@MattLaslo Guess they're not getting the score they wanted!
@BillPascrell @WaysandMeansGOP @SenateFinance They don't really care about America, do they?
@ericgeller @mattmfm @KimDotcom This is so scary!
@Philip_Elliott @DevlinBarrett @DWStweets Your headline is very misleading!  Read the story!
@NewaHailu @CBSNews Time to take another thing off her Flotus bio page!
@NewaHailu @CBSNews So then she's not fluent in 5 languages...
@politicalmiller @funder I think he's just as complicit...
@CBSNews She says she's fluent in Italian... apparently not!
@ALT_uscis @Pontifex @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump I thought she was fluent in Italian?
@seanhannity You've done this to yourself, sweetie!
@thehill And because of my lawyers!!!!
@FoxNews Can you say, "Immunity?!"
@KamalaHarris If you need testimony, let me know!
@Margoandhow One would think so!  She knows more than we know and her actions are VERY telling!
@peterdaou LOVE the sarcasm dripping from your voice in this tweet!!!
@aravosis You reap what you sow, Mikey!!!
@WajahatAli Such a perfect tweet!
@KamalaHarris I was a Kindergarten and puplic preschool teacher...  this sickens me!
@MikeLevinCA @DarrellIssa Guess he's looking for a soft crowd🙄
@politico @mike_pence @kyledcheney Truly, I think no one cares!  We're all hoping he'll go down with Trump etc!
@GoTTdiva @RogerJStoneJr Probably not something I'd be proud of, sweetie!
@thedailybeast Truly, their credibility as a NEWS source is ruined!  The only true news person they have is @ShepNewsTeam
@Fusion She SO knows something we don't know!
@WSJ This intolerance is disgusting!
@pacelattin Sadly, that is REALLY true!  Or "My Dad's a cop!" Etc, etc!
I feel a change coming...  I feel like karma is real...  resistance is taking over the evil in the world!
Since Trump has become President:  he had to pay for defrauding Trump U students, Alex Jones life got personal, O'Reilly gone. Hannity next?
@VTWooden @ukexpat19 @kylegriffin1 @MarchForTruth17 @MSNBC My guess is Russia has gotten to him, too.
@RogerJStoneJr @dailybeast Oh Roger!  You make me laugh!
@PalmerReport That would be glorious
@tribelaw Also Russian money laundering would be high on MY list to investigate!
@timkaine Thank you SO much!!!
Trump has hired a trial lawyer who specializes in RICO cases😳
@Reuters Please don't make this your headline!  So misleading for people who need to know what was actually said!
Kudos to @ShepNewsTeam for actually REPORTING the news, instead of spinning it!
@Newsweek We can only hope!
@IsaacDovere @maggieNYT This is so unbelievable!  The WH has got to start taking accountability for things!
@Acosta THIS is REALLY scary!!!
@DavidCornDC Even my republican spouse said he sounded like a moron
@W7VOA @POTUS @WhiteHouse Did you watch the hearing?  Apparently you did not!  Don't tweet fake news!
@CNN Apparently, so is FOX!
@DafnaLinzer My guess is Nunes and Chaffetz for starters
@RawStory @mcspocky @ShepNewsTeam "Guy"
@justinjm1 She knows something we don't know yet!  Pretty obvious!
@pacelattin Scary, right???
@BraddJaffy Melania OBVIOUSLY knows something that the rest of us don't know yet!
@CBSNews Notice how she pulled her hand away, once AGAIN!
@CNNPolitics And rejected, once again, by Melania!
@DaniellaMicaela Favorite part about this is that she's really showing who is in charge!!!
@DaniellaMicaela She did it again!!!  I'm starting to really like her!  Evident she is either extremely angry with him or wants nothing to do with him!
Melania just did it again!  Trump tried to hold her hand getting off the plane in Rome... she pulled her hand right away!
@RawStory @mcspocky @ShepNewsTeam is really proving himself to be a stand-up going, regardless that he works for Fox.
@RVAwonk He has got to be one of the ones Russia got to...  so concerned about trying to be right instead of concerned about our country!
@selectedwisdom I SO agree!
@FoxNews @JaySekulow You are a sick man!
@RachelStoltz @DailyCaller You are apparently NOT watching tv. The only channel not covering it was FOX when Hannity was on!
@Joel_Searby Hillary and Obama
@MichaelSkolnik God bless, Richard.  So very sad!
@shannoncoulter @AleciaWarrenXO @FoxNews Tick Tock! He's next to go!!!
@DailyCaller SO misleading!  You should show the real picture on your tweet!
@molly_knight @EricBoehlert Pretty funny, Molly!  Sad that it's true!
@seanhannity @mflynnJR @KimDotcom Wow!  He DEFINITELY looks like a real source! 😂😂😂
@ALT_uscis Might be sooner with Reince coming home!  Fingers crossed!!!
@DianneG The story just makes my heart hurt!
@funder 1 minute to go😀
@seanhannity @JulianAssange Stop it Sean!  No one takes you as credible anymore!
@NBCNews Good!  I'm so tired of these men who think they can get away with anything!
@TrueFactsStated I hope she's been the one leaking!
@FoxNews Disgusting!
@soledadobrien Sickening 😔
@joncoopertweets That's convenient!
2/2 @funder do you think that's why he's leaving?  Will that keep him from being charged?
1/1 @funder if the Office of Ethics agrees that Chaffetz leaked confidential info from the Comey letter, what could they charge him with?
@TrickFreee Truly looks scared and suffering from DT's!
@thehill This is so disgusting!
@seanhannity @mflynnJR Oh, how little you know...
@maggieNYT @TheRickWilson Any reason given?
Hoping that tomorrow's big news will be an arrest warrant for a Donald J. Trump!
@roanoketimes So sad for all involved!
@washingtonpost Thank you for this article!!!  So true!
@SheWhoVotes I hope SHE is the one leaking!
@RogerJStoneJr @Bencjacobs What do you think, @RogerJStoneJr ?
@JohnJHarwood Pence needs to go down with this!
@seanhannity Not a damn thing and hopefully nothing dangerous to America!
@andersoncooper You said what everyone is thinking!  Kudos!
@FoxNews @SebGorka Ha ha ha!
@katherinemiller @chrislhayes @BecketAdams It's gone!
@seanhannity @ByronYork @JoeConchaTV STOP!!!  Just STOP!!! No one is going to take you seriously anymore because you are not reporting the facts!
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS Oh yeah...  really?  Narrative is that there is Trump/Russia collusion.  Get on our planet!
@JoyAnnReid serious question... why doesn't Ivanka wear a wedding ring?
Kellyanne:  "Its all ours now, Mike!"   Mike: "Glorious, isn't it?" https://t.co/IVHl2WlTbG
@DianneG Guess they knew they were going to need him?
RT @Mikel_Jollett: Remember:		Hillary Clinton was EXACTLY RIGHT about everything relating to Trump and Russia. https://t.co/bR4Sz6KYxN
@maddow cannot wait for your show tonight!!!! 👍
@HeerJeet Ha ha!  That was really funny!!
@matthewamiller Jared??
@RepSwalwell Precious!!!  Congratulations!!!
@CNN He's my hero❤️
@pacelattin @UsVsThemBlog @thehill @aravosis @FOX5Vegas @RVAwonk https://t.co/NkSFgfXyMy
@pacelattin @UsVsThemBlog @thehill @aravosis @FOX5Vegas @RVAwonk Read the original article on https://t.co/qKAqFoAGJZ. The other people are identified within that piece.
@tedlieu Best thing I've seen all week!!!!
@TrickFreee This story is amazing!  So many dots to connect!
@DebraMessing @YouTube I rewatched it about 2 months ago... it was chilling to see the comparisons!
@KellyannePolls What does that even mean, sweetie?
@NBCNews This is SO NOT TRUE! He knew!
@BenSasse I've been smiling at these pictures all day!!!
@CNNPolitics Wait, what?  He's going back to his first story?
@Poppy_Fields1 @CNNPolitics That was NOT the first official White House statement, however!
@CNNPolitics That's big....  Trump said he fired him because of their recommendations 😳
@ZekeJMiller @chrislhayes Can he do that?
@BeingFarhad Are you okay?
@realDonaldTrump @USCGAcademy Too bad that you forgot that it was about THEM and not you!
@Independent Won't be Pence either... he's just as involved!
@TIME Truly, they better be... our country is at stake!
@thehill You know what's sad?  I no longer believe anything the GOP says...  if your article had said democrats, I would believe it!
@bennydiego This is sickening!  Schools need Title 1 funds!
@yashar Thank you for this... it's important!
@lsarsour It really is.... but I keep looking back to that day in DC where half a million people marched and it fills me with hope!
@JRubinBlogger God, I hope it happens!
@DebraMessing And he should!
@JoeNBC @jedshug America so needed this news today!
@OmarAslamLugo That makes me sick 🤢
@Acosta 🙄🙄🙄
Every single news source is talking about the Comey memo EXCEPT Fox!
@kathieallenmd Not what I wanted to hear!!!
@eschor @jaketapper He needs to go!
@jamiedupree This is sick!
RT @schemaly: I will retweet this forever https://t.co/2HUrSNWiVj
@kathieallenmd Do you trust him?
@realDonaldTrump You will regret this tweet!
@mflynnJR Your Dad needs to tell everything and put Trump away!
@BraddJaffy Trump or Putin???
@Amy_Siskind @jasoninthehouse Apparently he's trying to clear his name🙄🙄
@seanhannity Sean, STOP!  Your credibility is at risk!  Start reporting the truth!
@politico At this point, who the hell cares about Kellyanne?
@th3j35t3r Eye roll
@KeithOlbermann Ha ha!  Great one!!!!
@PalmerReport Sure seems like it!
@StafferWh @subzerov690 @realDonaldTrump The only reason he'd resign is if he thinks it would keep him from going to jail!
@mattmfm I'm sure she's happier without him.
@seanhannity Do you not care that Russia is meddling in our government?  What is wrong with you???
@chrislhayes We've seen this before...  Nunes, Chaffetz
@woodruffbets @KimDozier Not so sure about that...  guess we'll have to wait and see!
@KatyTurNBC @LesterHoltNBC Is it live?
@CNN So PROUD that @timkaine is my Senator!
@washingtonpost THIS is so important!!!!
@jahimes fantastic job on @Lawrence tonight!  Thank you!!!
@ALT_DOJ Ha!!!!  What a name to pick!!!
@wpjenna AND, it doesn't matter!  Price works for US!
@costareports We had one of them hiding in the bushes!!!
@JoyAnnReid , you are smart, wise, and beautiful!!!  So love watching you on your show, as well as a guest on other shows!
@TrueFactsStated Could they really be that stupid to try to access that stuff?
@FoxNews I'd say Trump is making enough trouble for himself...
@20committee Please hurry
@POTUS Interesting new banner picture...  meant to be a threat?
@thehill Ironic, isn't it?  🙄
@Chrissy_NC @AdamParkhomenko CNN
@MxSgl @SlimJes61855028 CNN
@jaketapper @SaraMurray Comey knows too much and Trump is SCARED!
@realDonaldTrump You are on your way out...  you get that, right?
@ericgarland Sean is on his way out, isn't he?  She keeps replacing him!  What a story he could tell!
@POTUS Did you really just tweet this?????  🙄🙄🙄
@JeffFlake I just followed you because of your courage!
@FoxNews He was SUCH an asshole!!!  His state should be embarrassed!
@amyklobuchar You were AWESOME today!
@stephenatap The GOP is embarrassing themselves and our nation!
@SenFeinstein @SenWhitehouse Please tell the GOP to stick to the Russia hearing...  thank you for your hard work!
@kylegriffin1 Another HUGE piece of info!
@RVAwonk ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS!!!!
@RVAwonk And now Cruz is talking about Hillary's emails...  what is wrong with these people???
@RVAwonk What a jerk!  This is a hearing on RUSSIA and our national security!
@JohnCornyn You need to STICK to Russia!  Stop making a fool of yourself!
@funder @grantstern The VERY day she tells him they can share the evidence, she is fired!  Unbelievable!
@ericgarland @selectedwisdom What she just said was HUGE!
@NormEisen @CNN @StudiGo_LLC So cool!!!
@tariqnasheed @JohnJHarwood Disgusting!
RT @TrueFactsStated: This is what a president who isn't committing Treason looks at Putin. Keep this look in mind. https://t.co/be90ENTdoP
@KeithOlbermann Wasn't sure he could fit through the door😳
We REALLY need a President that we can be proud of!
@BraddJaffy Makes me wish this was our country!

@politico I thank these 20 people for having a shred of decency!
I am a survivor of rape... I didn't ASK for this pre-existing condition!!!  I've gone through enough!
Amazing...  Fox News is NOT talking about the House passing the ACHC bill....🙄🙄
@MarkHerringVA Their actions just make me so sick to my stomach!
@WestWingReport And, HOW DARE, The House take it away from America, but keep it for themselves 😡😡
@WestWingReport Furious, disgusted!!!!
