Congressman Delaney's term ended on January 3rd and this is an inactive and archived account. You can now follow John at @JohnKDelaney.
President Trump's shutdown is reckless and shows how incompetent he is. Federal workers and their families should not be punished for his dysfunction and I have cosponsored legislation (H.R. 7368) to ensure that furloughed workers are paid.

Please take time to read about the five souls tragically killed yesterday in #Annapolis. Journalists &amp; papers like the @capitalgazette make our democracy possible by keeping the public informed, holding those in power accountable and focusing on the truth. https://t.co/sXhq9dxUYu
Absolutely devastated by the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis. Horrifying. I can’t imagine what the staff members and family members of the Gazette are going through right now. As we await more information, one thing is clear: we can't ever let this become normal.
We should return to a 60-votes requirement for Supreme Court nominees, and if President Trump and Senator McConnell can’t meet that standard, then they should meet their own and wait until after the next election is held.
For the good of our nation, President Trump should nominate a Supreme Court Justice in Kennedy’s mold of reasonable deliberation, and that is exactly what Senator McConnell, and the Senate as a whole, should demand.
Upon reflection, it's clear that we really only have one option: to restore civility, judicial independence, and begin acting with integrity again. Sen. McConnell has an opportunity to do the right thing and make right his prior neglect for our democracy. He should do so.
So now, we have before us a sadly familiar dilemma – how do we respond after so many norms of respect, civility and non-partisanship have been destroyed?
In a single move, he exposed as hollow decades of his own rhetoric about his supposed belief in the institutional history of the United States Senate. At the moment of truth, he put party over country.
Senator McConnell’s decision to ignore President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016 will go down in history as a shameless betrayal of the spirit of our democracy and of the purpose of the Supreme Court: to uphold the Constitution in an unbiased and non-political way.

April and I are deeply saddened by the news of County Executive Kamenetz’s passing. Kevin was a tireless public servant and a champion for the Baltimore area and his constituents. Our condolences and prayers go out to Jill, their two sons, and the entire Kamenetz family.
What makes matters worse, I fear it was done solely for political reasons. I hope that the damage is not permanent and that this mistake does not undermine the hugely important negotiations with North Korea and our national security more broadly.
By withdrawing from the JCPOA without an articulated go forward strategy to work with the international community to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the President has compromised that responsibility.
A President’s most fundamental responsibility is to the security of the American people at home and abroad. One of the central challenges still facing the world is nuclear proliferation.
The President missed a significant opp. to work with our allies to strengthen the weaknesses in the JCPOA and instead chose a misguided path that with either isolate the U.S. from our allies, accelerate Iran’s becoming a nuclear state, or lead to a military conflict w/ Iran.

It is all the more disturbing that the WH continues to delay sanctions on Russia, while referring to these now extensively-documented activities as a ‘hoax.’ We must do everything possible to secure our election system and hold those that attack our democracy accountable.
It is absolutely essential that Mr. Mueller’s investigation be allowed to continue and that all partisan efforts to undermine and subvert the investigation cease.
These indictments corroborate what our intelligence agencies have been saying for some time, that Russia attempted to sow discord in our country and flood voters with misinformation.
The Special Counsel’s indictments reveal a sophisticated, coordinated and large-scale attack on our democracy by a hostile foreign power.
It’s time to pass gun safety legislation. There are bipartisan proposals that the vast majority the country supports and the American people deserve to be heard.

Congressional Republicans have – at least temporarily – moved from a hyper-partisan approach to actually negotiating with Democrats and I think that’s a good thing, so let’s take this up in good faith, and if they back out in three weeks, we hold them accountable.

It’s time to be responsible and come together on a bipartisan deal to fund the government.
I will donate any congressional pay I receive during this shutdown to a local charity. I don't think it's right for me to get paid while my constituents are being furloughed and important services are being limited.
I've cosponsored legislation to protect federal workers' pay during the shutdown. https://t.co/hNXGYNAn46
I hope everyone gets the hash-tagging and the blame game out of their system soon, because frankly the American people don’t care about that. It’s time for us to work together on a responsible long-term budget that addresses the pressing needs of the country.
There’s got to be a sense of urgency now to get a deal done.
Previous shutdowns have proven to be bad for the country, bad for the economy and bad for people that depend upon government services. Moreover, government shutdowns are especially damaging and disruptive to Maryland.
Washington has tried the hyper-partisan approach for over a year now and it’s brought us to this point of total breakdown and dysfunction.

One simple thing we can do to pay for a real infrastructure plan, raise the corporate rate from 21% to 23%. Still a huge tax cut. https://t.co/SrQIh8zcpy
We should raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 23% - still a huge cut from 35% - and use that revenue to pay for a real infrastructure program. Real investment creates jobs, growth and improves people's lives. https://t.co/TZAPICL3ZL

Wouldn’t it be a better deal if you were to claw some of that back and have a real  infrastructure plan?
The two areas where Congressional GOP clearly gave away way too much to big business &amp; investors was on lowering the corp rate to  21% and not making any real changes to carried interest.
The fact is, regulatory relief and public-private partnerships won't be enough to fix America's infrastructure – we're going to have to also make a real investment at the federal level.

Read more about the Open Our Democracy Act here 📜 https://t.co/bZjmPB3wd2
This is a comprehensive reform bill to ensure that the districts are fair and that all voters are heard.
My bill ends partisan gerrymandering nationwide, helps more people vote by making Election Day a holiday and creates open top-two primaries
The American people are deeply frustrated because they can see that Congress just doesn’t reflect the country’s priorities.
and that means a small and disproportionately partisan percentage of the population has an outsized influence on Congress
In too many districts, the only election that matters is the primary
Gerrymandering, low voter turnout and a broken primary system have  warped Congress and encouraged extreme partisanship
The Open Our Democracy Act has a very simple goal – to make the House of Representatives truly representative.

Strategically, this is a strong sign by POTUS that they’re not serious about infrastructure, it’s a punch in the gut on infrastructure.
I believe that President Trump’s tax plan will significantly hurt our long term fiscal health and economic competitiveness.
As someone who has spent decades in the private sector and understands how the economy actually works...
President Trump’s tax plan will explode the deficit and disproportionally benefit wealthy Americans.

It is critically important that the Purple Line gets built. I fear that the Gov has implemented a process to derail the project
