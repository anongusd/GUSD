@hoosierjason @Dbeatty27569208 @saennia @tariqnasheed @BWWings So quickly to judge me as a racist, for what?! Stating facts? You absolutely don’t know me at all or my relationships and friendships with people of ALL races. You’re the pathetic one, not me. Move on. You’re wasting your time here. Buh Bye 👋
@hoosierjason @Dbeatty27569208 @saennia @tariqnasheed @BWWings No. I won’t take a seat. Everything out of his mouth is racist. I’m not offended by Tariq’s ignorance, just pointing out FACTS, Bacon Pancakes.
@Dbeatty27569208 @saennia @tariqnasheed @BWWings Hmm, white racism...Every single time Tariq posts “white” it’s immediately followed by supremenist. All he does is spout racism on a daily basis. Do you HONESTLY believe that every white person that has ever been on this earth has been a “white supremenist” like he does? Come on.

@IE_PPact Once and for all, please enlighten me on how I'm being sexist 🤷‍♀️ Because I don't believe a woman should be allowed to murder her unborn baby? As you do. If that's your case, than fine, call me a sexist all you want. And I'll call you a supporter of murder. Peace 🔥
@Montel_Williams @1AmericanMama @davidmweissman @Cernovich @greta @SarahKSilverman @ChelseaClinton @JoyAnnReid @jaketapper @TuckerCarlson @andylassner @yashar Hey Montel! I'm from Kansas (you know, one of those United States) and voted for Trump. Do you speak to American Trump voters online? Or just call them Russians?
@IE_PPact How does being Pro-Life Sexist?		You obviously don't understand my tweet you dug up. I was saying before Joy Villa was pro-choice, pro-Christian, pro-Trump, she supported the complete opposite? 		How is that not obvious from that tweet? Move along murdering babies🔪👶🔪 https://t.co/eSfviTaNhu
@benshapiro It'll give the media something to obsess over for the next month or two.
@IE_PPact I have never been pro-choice. Next?
@IE_PPact I support Pro-Life, it's in my bio. I also believe that killing an innocent life is Murder. Does that answer your question?
RT @benshapiro: Comey’s not giving his book money to charity, is he? Because that would be honorable and show he’s not in it for the cash.

@Twatty_McGee @PRundyMC @EthnicAmbiguity @TeeSparks1 @JesseKellyDC Exactly. Dems/Reps have become so divided, we aren't anywhere close to being UNITED. And I don't think we will ever be. It's not ideal, but it's getting to a point where I would be fine with separating, here's a breakdown https://t.co/VAKR7K42kg
@RitaPanahi I'm 32 and I know full well what happened in Auschwitz. Not because they taught it throughly at my schools, but because I self-educated myself on it.
RT @realDonaldTrump: Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event, the Unite…

@dbongino Damn, I was following them. Can't trust any "conservative" account these days 🙄A lot of fakes out there.

@KyleWyllie @RealJamesWoods @JimmyKimmelLive Umm, no. That's not what I was saying. I was implying for Jimmy to take on James, like he did Hannity, because James would destroy him. I despise Kimmel. But call me whatever you want and unfollow me.
