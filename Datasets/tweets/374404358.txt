Congratulations to @Cristiano on his 500th win in club football more success to come your way.
The life @Cristiano is a lesson, at one time he was down 4-1 on BallonD'or award against Messi and many said he won’t ever catch up today he is 5-5 with Messi. When people say you can’t achieve something, please don’t listen if you do you won’t but if you don’t  you can succeed
