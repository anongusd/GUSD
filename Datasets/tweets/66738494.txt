What is REALLY going on?
@yeor2002 @realDonaldTrump Both. But directly to trump since I was replying to his tweet and kim jong.. doesn‚Äôt have Twitter? What‚Äôs his deal w that? Does he get twitter reports?
@realDonaldTrump There are people starving in your own nation... maybe put your attention there instead of teasing ‚Äòend of the world‚Äô pride games with other world leaders. If either of you are right, we are all dead and there is no one left to applaud. What is there in that to brag about?
@PMasalsky @LoganPaul Maybe a lot of ‚Äúyes‚Äù people? I hope they all have genuinely learned from their mistake or at least start to evaluate/gain self awareness/grow spines/whatever they‚Äôre lacking that lead to this.
@PMasalsky @LoganPaul (And got away from said shit heads..) but that‚Äôs besides the point.
@PMasalsky @LoganPaul One can hope. Though, 1st hand experience, I‚Äôve worked with some shit heads &amp; I‚Äôm not a shit head. (Or at least do my best not to be). This was SO obviously not a good thing to do, &amp; there are 5-7 other people in his video? Is it fear of him that stops the others from saying no?
@LoganPaul Contd- ultimately YES obviously hold Logan responsible. But unless everyone on his team is brain dead, this was avoidable. Be better than this. This was SO 2017 of @LoganPaul and his team. üôÑ
I‚Äôve worked with all levels of YouTubers, the big ones have teams. @LoganPaul has a whole team of people around him, how did no one say ‚Äúuh dude... maybe we shouldn‚Äôt post this.‚Äù One idiot is not surprising, a whole team tho? Come on guys... ONE of you is better than this.

@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump It is our president who should b able to de-muddy things a bit, have a conversation, instead of condemn free speech. At least, I wish. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump :) ‚ù§Ô∏èüåª
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump Yea, exactly. I wish the conversation weren‚Äôt so muddied with the president focused on condemning free speech.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump I will say I have enjoyed this civil discourse with you Eric :) thank u for having a conversation about free speech!
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump But again, this all goes back to my original point of why isn‚Äôt the president discussing WHY they are bending the knee in the first place
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump Upholding a value this country was founded on during our national anthem is very clearly anything but disrespectful.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump So practicing the first amendment is disrespecting our national anthem? Doesn‚Äôt that seem backwards to you?
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump I commend the players for using their platform to celebrate the first amendment thru protest. To me, this upholds the values of our country.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump By stating their practice of free speech is disrespecting the flag, I would 100% say that is a comment against free speech
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump The only reason we aren‚Äôt discussing police brutality rn is because the president of our country is speaking out AGAINST the 1st amendment.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump through out history people have walked out of work in protest. Students walk out of schools in protest. Speak where u will be heard.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump This is active practice of the first amendment and WHERE they choose to practice the right to free speech is their choice.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump In fact people DO walk out of work to show protest. Many times through our history. The field is where they will be heard. Clearly.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump Crazy thought but maybe a football player on a football field IS their time. Though glad to hear u support the 1st amendment (somewhat).
@lastwolflord @realDonaldTrump (Your earlier response made u seem misinformed). With your logic, what is trumps job &amp; is he doing it by refusing the right to free speech?
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump The players chose to protest on the field. like students walking out of school to protest rescinding Daca. We voice where it will be heard.
@lastwolflord @realDonaldTrump You may be misinformed. That‚Äôs okay! This is why conversation is important! Police brutality is the original reason they kneel.
@realDonaldTrump Why not talk about what lead to the players taking a knee in the first place?

@thejohncarle oh wait. This was sarcasm. Gahahhahaha
@thejohncarle *not "everyone" just.. I'm surprised by the BS titles I'm seeing from creators I respect
@thejohncarle I hold us responsible for our own titles you know?!
@thejohncarle JC it's EVERYONE! People whose content I love and trust are putting up BS titles that lead to nothing. I blame YouTube but!
@JeOughton and make you not trust the creator right?!? At least that's me.. hard to trust amplified titles ..
Welcome to my first twitter rant.
Like I get it.. @YouTube algo is kinda effed but seriously we don't have to aggressively feed into it with clickbait irrelevant titles.
I scrolled through my YouTube home page &amp; it's nothing but super "catchy" titles that have NOTHING to do w/ the core of the video. Come.On.
Hey gang, how bout we not put super dramatic titles for super non dramatic YouTube videos. I don't want to click on any video now... so..
