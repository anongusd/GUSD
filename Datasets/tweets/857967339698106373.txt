One final point – in thinking about KY’s and other states’ threats, worth remembering that Governor Bevin ran for office saying he would take down expansion, then changed his mind 6/6
But CMS’s core argument is that, b/c KY has threatened to end expansion, CMS can grant any waiver the state asserts it needs to maintain it. @JudyCBPP explains the problems with this ransom note approach to Medicaid waivers: https://t.co/s54ipIYLTo 5/

First, CMS makes a half-hearted claim that those projections don’t really apply. But our estimate, based on @KaiserFamFound and @urbaninstitute analyses, is that KY’s work requirement alone could cause coverage loss of that magnitude;: https://t.co/Sl6JpJ19TK 2/

KY doesn’t explain its estimate that its waiver will ultimately reduce adult coverage by &gt;95,000/month - but coverage losses of that magnitude could result just b/c people get tripped up by paperwork, work at unstable jobs, or can’t meet new requirements for other reasons 2/5 https://t.co/UMwSdEUCHd

For example, rather than going to protect subsidized consumers from premium increases from expanding sub-standard plans, $30B could pay for at least several years of extending ACA tax credits to pple over 400% FPL (based on RAND estimates: https://t.co/jgjnDX1adT)
Notable that Administration projects nearly $30B (over 10 years) in federal costs from short-term plans rule. For similar cost, could make real affordability improvements – w/out exposing pple to gaps in coverage or ⬆️premiums for middle-income pple w/pre-existing conditions https://t.co/iH1rndHLgA
States can and should respond to today’s short-term plans rule by acting to protect their own markets and consumers.  In several states, policymakers (of both parties) have already done so or are considering taking action, as @sarahL202 outlines: https://t.co/Nt0XpPxtM1
4. Eligible enrollees may be at even more risk of losing coverage in other states proposing work requirements, some of which would take away coverage after just 1 month of non-compliance or will require even more enrollees to document hours/exemptions. https://t.co/CfOOoXmNte
3.While &gt; 7,000 enrollees are already at risk of losing coverage if they miss two more months of reporting, the # at risk will almost certainly rise as AR rolls out its work requirement to several times as many enrollees over the coming months and next year. https://t.co/rQwnMvKdN1
2.The data cast doubt on how AR’s policy could possibly be achieving its goals. Just 94 pple complied with the requirement by newly reporting work/work activities (v. those deemed compliant b/c AR already knew they were working); even many of those were probably working already. https://t.co/eh3S1TwKQp
1. The data add to evidence that many losing coverage due to work requirements will be eligible enrollees tripped up by red tape. 29% of those subject to AR's new rules didn’t report hours/exemptions – many more than are likely neither working nor exemption-eligible. https://t.co/U6hQz129Rn

For insight into what this new repeal plan might do, take a look at our brief on the previous repeal plan: https://t.co/0ixba276n7. As it explains, a new version would probably provide even less federal $ for coverage and could therefore result in even higher uninsured rates https://t.co/uJNGx5Mpf6
There are many more examples in the full analysis: https://t.co/msRVmHB0TQ
10. They might not know when they need to report changes in income or eligibility, which could lock them out of coverage for months even if eligible https://t.co/aba6KOEO5M
9. They might not realize they need to turn in renewal paperwork to maintain the option of enrolling in Medicaid, even if they don’t currently need it https://t.co/WC3XZMv43q
8. If their housing arrangements are unstable, as many low-income families’ are, they might never receive notices telling them what to do to keep their coverage https://t.co/185ES206dX
7. They might try to pay premiums to activate coverage when they need it, but be unbanked, like many low-income people https://t.co/MTumNHxPxv
6. They might have a substance use disorder and even be in treatment, but not want to disclose that information to a state caseworker https://t.co/pCsMSR49lr
5. Even if eligible for a good cause exception to new requirements, they might not be able to produce the right documentation in the middle of dealing with a hospitalization, eviction, or other crisis https://t.co/Z4o00B4afb

Overall, with large shares of workers and people with serious health needs at risk of losing coverage, the majority of enrollees at risk likely fall into one of these groups 9/9 https://t.co/iOPvQEGNBm
Finally, as we’ve written before, one of the most counterintuitive effects of work requirements will be to put coverage at risk for a large share of WORKING low-income people: https://t.co/twuqzrzBRz 8/
And by taking away coverage, the policies will also increase uncompensated care costs: https://t.co/oNDaVC93VU 7/ https://t.co/4UKAYZuAHk
By states' own estimates, states &amp; the federal government will be spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on systems to take away coverage, effectively diverting scarce resources from coverage to bureaucracy: https://t.co/H4Fv9XFiu3 6/ https://t.co/JRQlys6IPm
And many other people will lose coverage because they themselves get tripped up by the complexity of the policies, w/people with disabilities, mental health needs, and substance use disorders likely especially at risk 5/

And, states facing deep cuts to other federal funding for coverage would likely make cuts in their pre-expansion Medicaid programs 11/12

.@MattAFiedler &amp; @LorenAdler estimated an earlier version of Cassidy Graham would cause 21 million people to lose coverage (https://t.co/o82ajyztLe) – meaning a resulting uninsured non-elderly rate of about 18 percent (50 million people) v. 10.6 percent today 6/12
It’s also because, according to the summary, the new plan uses 20-25% of the remaining resources to pay for repeal of the ACA’s employer mandate and expand HSAs – provisions that (at best) won’t help mitigate coverage losses 5/12
That’s partly because the 2017 tax bill repealed the individual mandate, cutting several hundred $ from ACA coverage programs and using them to pay for tax cuts; the earlier legislation used these $ to help fund the block grant 4/12
But the new proposal appears to provide over $300B less funding for the block grant than the earlier bill 3/12
Like Cassidy-Graham, the new bill completely eliminates Medicaid expansion (currently covers 12 million people) and ACA subsidies (currently help about 10 million people), replacing them with a deeply flawed block grant 2/12 https://t.co/ALVhIg5NF5
Based on this summary, new ACA repeal plan is similar to the Cassidy-Graham bill described in our new issue brief: https://t.co/0ixba1PuYx – but appears to provide even fewer federal $ for coverage, suggesting it could result in even higher uninsured rates 1/12 https://t.co/cscGVrJUOr

@charles_gaba Hijack anytime! Really appreciate all you do to inform the debate
Overall, the bill fails the key tests we laid out for assessing whether stabilization proposals improve affordability and strengthen the market: https://t.co/UPN1Jqfc6w 7/7
In fact, it could create new ambiguity around states’ ability to restrict short-term plans in their own markets, as Katie Keith explains: https://t.co/pKbOnKtHeD 6/ https://t.co/y2F5aXyOjA
Meanwhile, the bill fails to address the Administration’s proposed short-term plans rule, probably the biggest outstanding threat to the individual market 5/ https://t.co/tX9830pyaT
The bill’s reinsurance funding would reduce premiums for middle-income consumers – but would be paid for more than $-for-$ by reducing coverage and raising costs for lower-income people 4/ https://t.co/1Di0DYcpaU
That’s because, by reinstating CSR payments, it would increase premiums, out-of-pocket costs, or both for many moderate-income consumers 3/ https://t.co/99HoTQuA8x
One might expect a proposal to strengthen the individual market would increase coverage, but this bill would reduce it 2/ https://t.co/IZPNXVV0kK
Lots of attention to R efforts to broaden “Hyde amendment” restrictions in private coverage, but the problems with the Alexander individual market proposal go well beyond that: https://t.co/d4xyritbSj 1/
Interesting from RI: little evidence of shifting out of generous CSR tiers, looks like more shifting into gold than bronze, &amp; most unsubsidized consumers seem to have exited on-marketplace silver https://t.co/aID4bUsAbM
Finally, press release asserts package will benefit consumers below 250% of the poverty line by restoring CSRs. CBO makes clear these consumers are still getting cost sharing assistance; some will see higher costs w/CSRs restored. 21/21
Press release implies all unsubsidized consumers will benefit. CBO finds many unsubsidized consumers will live in states without reinsurance programs in 2020-2021; this group mostly won’t benefit. 20/
Press release repeats Oliver Wyman estimate that package would increase coverage by 3.2 million. CBO finds package would reduce coverage on net. 19/
(Restoring CSRs would add to sticker price premium reductions, but will largely increase rather than reduce costs for consumers.) 18/
Press release repeats Oliver Wyman estimate that premiums would fall 40%. CBO finds 10% reduction in 2019, 20% in 2020-2021 in states with reinsurance programs, 0% in states without. 17/ https://t.co/dfR7KrQSxq
Finally, here are a few of the claims from the sponsors’ press release (https://t.co/KzNVKIbFod) that are refuted by CBO. 16/
40% of consumers in 2020 (and 20% in 2021) will live in states without federally-funded reinsurance programs, so even many unsubsidized consumers won’t benefit. 15/ https://t.co/G1oED6iukR
Restoring CSRs raises premiums/out-of-pocket costs for many people with incomes between 200-400 percent FPL, who won’t benefit from reinsurance. 14/ https://t.co/zi2nh2sr68
Fourth, many people would see higher costs or no benefits from the proposal. 13/
Premium savings for consumers would be &lt; $19.6b, because the reinsurance $ wouldn’t be fully passed through to consumers by insurers. 12/ https://t.co/O8VRTwftBD
Net federal spending on reinsurance would equal $19.6B. (That’s less than the $30B up front $ mostly because CBO expects states won’t take full advantage of the money.) 11/ https://t.co/eDhV7LGUL1
The federal savings from restoring CSR payments equal $29B. 10/ https://t.co/qhAOQlYnxE
Third, the savings from higher costs, reduced coverage from restoring CSRs exceed the total premium reductions that would result from the bill’s reinsurance funding. 9/
The rest of the savings from restoring CSRs come from people who keep their coverage paying more. 8/ https://t.co/eLwUxfeBnV
Higher costs lead some of these consumers to drop coverage, accounting for the majority of the savings. 7/ https://t.co/1voAaR5DJM
Restoring CSRs results in worse coverage options for consumers with incomes between 200 and 400% of the poverty line. 6/ https://t.co/NkQ1XDWVOB
Second, CBO confirms that the federal savings from restoring CSRs come from coverage losses, higher premiums, &amp; higher out-of-pocket costs for people w/incomes below 400% of the poverty line. 5/
Comparing restoring CSR payments to the status quo, CBO finds coverage losses of 500k-1 million. 4/ https://t.co/r614MxIZFB
Assessing the package relative to a baseline where CSRs are paid – so looking at the effects of reinsurance &amp; other provisions, CBO finds coverage gains &lt; 500k. 3/ https://t.co/EjqxI7kQcr
First, CBO finds the legislation would result in net coverage losses, w/larger losses for moderate-income consumers than gains for middle-/upper-income consumers. 2/

@xpostfactoid Agree this is an important reason to prefer a direct increase in PTCs or CSRs for the 200-400% group over the current ad hoc version

Avoid making coverage more expensive for moderate-income consumers: don’t restore CSR payments w/out compensating subsidy improvements for those who will see higher costs 2/4 https://t.co/cLuGIRWbT7
My take on the tests any bipartisan individual market stabilization package should meet: https://t.co/UPN1Jqfc6w 1/4
As many as 3.3 million https://t.co/VrS4qjBM1W consumers could see higher costs if CSR payments were restored w/out compensating improvements in subsidies – contrasting w/reinsurance, which lowers net premiums (though only for unsubsidized consumers) https://t.co/5Vcxk7es0g 4/4
As CBO explained back in August, that results in higher federal costs because total subsidies (tax credits + CSRs) increase and consumers’ net premiums fall, as in these examples https://t.co/LIPovM2EF3 3/ https://t.co/J9nY7cBwy8
Trump’s decision not to pay CSRs led insurers in most states to build CSR costs into silver plan premiums, increasing premium tax credits &amp; letting subsidized consumers buy gold/bronze plans for less 2/

Neither Alexander-Murray nor the Collins-Nelson reinsurance bill comes close to undoing the premium increases, market instability, or coverage losses resulting from individual mandate repeal: https://t.co/GAIM4GGcZA &amp; https://t.co/9fkPomCRkg https://t.co/HpPLdayG27
@sarahkliff So entirely right that numbers this year aren't apples-to-apples w/ last year, &amp; shorter OE will matter - but 100% increase isn't the right benchmark
@sarahkliff Key is that essentially all returning consumers signed up or were auto-re-enrolled by or around the 12/15 deadline, while January was imp for new consumer sign-ups
@sarahkliff This isn't quite right, b/c sign-ups aren't steady over the course of OE: last year, https://t.co/VrS4qjBM1W sign-ups totals 8.7M after the 12/15 deadline &amp; auto-enrollment, compared to 9.2M at the end of OE https://t.co/lqacmTfw3Y
So Senators Cassidy &amp; Collins &amp; others who’ve argued auto-enrollment would be almost as good as the mandate at maintaining coverage are implicitly accepting that most of those losing coverage from repeal of the mandate are harmed

@charles_gaba Right: savings come from assumption that there are people who would have caught up on premiums w/90 days to do so, but won't/can't w/30 days
@charles_gaba I interpreted the $5B as 10-year savings - so ~$500M per year - but have not seen official CBO score yet, just the committee write-up
@charles_gaba And to get at unproven fears about gaming, proposal would cut ~1M coverage-months per year ($500M/yr divided by avr  monthly APTC) 8/8
@charles_gaba Other data also contradict grace period gaming claims – especially claims about gaming at end of year https://t.co/jOM7e8a5aR 7/8 https://t.co/8DstbVXV8F
@charles_gaba Sheer numbers involved suggest this is about lower-income families’ precarious finances, not gaming 6/8
@charles_gaba Magnitude of CBO score, &amp; data from WA https://t.co/qWJpprMcc8, show lots of lower-income pple fall behind w/premiums, then catch up 5/8
@charles_gaba If they don’t, no APTCs are paid for months 2&amp;3 - &amp; claims aren't covered – but if they do, APTCs and coverage continue 4/8
@charles_gaba Key point is that, under current law, low-/moderate-income pple who fall behind on premiums have 90 days to catch up 3/8
@charles_gaba Note that $5B scored savings likely come from not paying APTCs, not from increased mandate penalties 2/8

It turns out, 2017 marketplace premiums aren’t especially high: @urbaninstitute shows they're in line w/ESI premiums https://t.co/Dw95bWfYss
Set aside for a moment that Rs’ response to concerns about marketplace premiums is to cut Medicaid by a quarter 2/6
To the extent Rs are making any case for their bill here, it’s about marketplace premiums 1/6 https://t.co/O9eI3m1vkA
RT @jleibenluft: If you are a governor, you know that Medicaid is crucial for coverage + state budgets -- and not just a piggy bank to pay…
As @PaulNVandeWater explains, auto enrollment just isn't workable as an alternative to the ACA's individual mandate https://t.co/IXF3PF1WK0
Absent sabotage, predicts rates would be roughly in line with medical trend - consistent with predictions of increased price stability
Oliver Wyman: uncertainty about CSRs &amp; mandate will account for 2/3 of 2018 marketplace rate increases https://t.co/KLQTPi4cGW https://t.co/kZnl7l6MYY
More evidence that you can't protect people w/pre-existing conditions while eliminating nationwide essential health benefit standards https://t.co/yzs95WrTLY
Bottom line: House health bill would nearly or fully reverse ACA’s historic coverage gains for all age, income groups 5/5 https://t.co/qeAQbYojsK
Older adults would see largest % increase in uninsured rate, w/5.1 million losing coverage, as @KaiserFamFound highlighted 4/5 https://t.co/c9jpfIGJKG
And while young adults have sometimes been called the winners from the House bill, 1/8 pple age 19-29 would lose coverage 3/5 https://t.co/kr5Js37V8M
Slashing subsidies &amp; cutting Medicaid would end coverage for 3M kids, harm many more kids w/disabilities, as @JessicaSchubel explains 2/5 https://t.co/KvnfnGCSHq
The 23M people CBO estimates would lose coverage under the House health bill are of all ages, incomes https://t.co/6kRyMbwtFZ 1/5
As @JudyCBPP explains https://t.co/vBdOKcUejJ, Cassidy is right: replacing Medicaid coverage w//$ for opioid treatment is “bad medicine” https://t.co/bsnvNxNL2P
@StephArmour1 But even so, CBO estimates bill raises premiums 20% in 2018 &amp; 5% in 2019 compared to current law, &amp; shrinks enrollment
@StephArmour1 Patient &amp; State Stability Fund is $15b for 18 &amp; 19, &amp; CBO seems to assume that would be used mostly for reinsurance
@StephArmour1 Isn't the $15b stabilization money for 2018 &amp; 2019 just what was already in the House bill?
He presumably knows  a slower phaseout does nothing to preserve coverage in the long run, little in the short run https://t.co/QAKcROVuA9
Gov. Sandoval (R-NV) is not pleased with proposals to phase down Medicaid expansion https://t.co/uvmQN7Oqz2 https://t.co/5WVDTDEDA9

Per @USTreasury, 1/5 marketplace consumers in 2014 was self-employed or a small business owner https://t.co/AJBeSwGpza https://t.co/rAV3nt5bSv
@CitizenCohn So while marketplaces have succeeded w/out CA-like state efforts to date, CA-like effort may be necessary in face of federal sabotage 8/8
@CitizenCohn And now, successful marketplaces in red/purple states are prob more vulnerable to sabotage, since states are not trying to combat it 7/8
@CitizenCohn Example: IN had benchmark premiums ↓ in 2017 &amp; &gt;=3 insurers almost everywhere– but here’s the DOI press release: https://t.co/3Tx9DUFVsf 6/8
@CitizenCohn But, instead of touting their success, state officials often claim that these marketplaces are failing 5/8
@CitizenCohn Also strong competition (https://t.co/aTLiMkjjMq), moderate premium Δs (https://t.co/H3tXcr0sGQ), &amp; continued strong enrollment for 2017 4/8
@CitizenCohn Examples: AR, IN, MI, ND, OH have 2017 marketplace premiums &lt; or similar to comparable employer premiums (https://t.co/wT3QKUfWDc)... 3/8
@CitizenCohn But there are marketplace success stories in red/purple states too; we hear about them less partly b/c state officials don’t tell them 2/8
This from @CitizenCohn is important: state decisions about their marketplaces matter 1/8 https://t.co/WWdLgAFnWk
RT @JeffYoung: For the poorest older people, health insurance would cost more than they make in most states under the GOP bill: https://t.c…
@sarahkliff And Senate Rs appear to be settling on an approach that may do even LESS than delay to maintain near-term coverage https://t.co/QAKcROVuA9
So expansion state senators may have secured almost nothing in the short term – as well as nothing in the long term
Even non-trigger states more likely to freeze enrollment in 2020 than come up with $ to keep expansion open, when federal cuts will just ↑
At least 8 states (AR, IL, IN, MI, MT, NH, NM, WA) have state laws that automatically end expansion if federal match rate drops
Between trigger states &amp; realistic state budget decisions, expansion phasedown wouldn’t have much effect even in intermediate years https://t.co/EBCrs0rKjp
@ReedAbelson Hard to know whether CSRs are particularly imp to Anthem in OH, or whether OH was selected for other reasons
@ReedAbelson State regulators might have to be flexible, but assume they likely would be
@ReedAbelson I read Anthem's FAQ as leaving that option very much open: https://t.co/f5TOvnS0LJ
Solution is straightforward: guarantee CSRs &amp; stop other marketplace sabotage 8/8
No mystery around Anthem’s OH exit: as they warned 6 weeks ago, pulling out b/c of uncertainty around CSRs https://t.co/QJjL4PhkjT 7/8
Not to mention the gains for OH from Medicaid expansion &amp; other parts of ACA, also in jeopardy under AHCA https://t.co/kka461fpI1  6/8
238,843 signed up for 2017 marketplace plans in Ohio, including 80,286 new consumers 5/8
Ohio’s market is highly competitive, w/11 insurers for 2017, &gt;= 3 for 84 percent of marketplace consumer 4/8
Benchmark marketplace premiums in Ohio rose an average of just 2% for 2017 3/8
Ohio’s 2017 marketplace premiums are 23 percent LOWER than for comparable employer coverage https://t.co/wT3QKUfWDc 2/8

Instead, the Administration won’t say whether it will pay CSRs for June, much less going forward https://t.co/1nUEUDJWC0
Another reminder: Anthem weeks ago linked continued participation to getting certainty about CSRs by “early June” https://t.co/flOwLSI6CS https://t.co/zjBwgvIxzB

Q for policymakers is whether they’ll insist on maintaining  expansion, or be satisfied with rolling it back, after the 2020 election 6/6
The public – across party lines – overwhelming supports continuing federal funding for expansion, unsurprising in light of its benefits 5/6 https://t.co/9nTRIHUwRU

Two new @CBPP analyses this morning find ending Medicaid expansion means… ending Medicaid expansion https://t.co/IHUofjLUya 1/6
Most important: based on CBO’s ACA forecast record, every reason to expect historic coverage losses from AHCA would materialize as well 8/8
Bottom line: CBO predicted historic coverage gains under the ACA &amp; that’s what exactly what happened 7/8
Also worth noting ACA coverage provisions are costing less than CBO expected – partly but not just b/c states didn’t expand Medicaid 6/8
CBO premium estimates were remarkably accurate: actual marketplace premiums for 2017 w/in 1% of CBO forecast https://t.co/H3tXcr0sGQ 5/8 https://t.co/SDM9uprhLX
Fun fact: CBO recognized extra uncertainty around employer dropping estimates; it issued a whole report about it https://t.co/VrocInscOp 4/8
CBO’s errors mostly about where people get coverage v. # covered - e.g. more employer &amp; less marketplace coverage than expected
Drop in non-elderly uninsured rate almost 80% what CBO predicted for 2016, adjusted for states not expanding Medicaid 2/8 https://t.co/oiCvfxjjWc
CBO didn’t know SCOTUS would make Medicaid expansion optional; w/that adjustment, coverage estimates largely right https://t.co/Ry25Kj8qPl https://t.co/RSSuaRTODy
@charles_gaba @BCBSNC @ASlavitt @TopherSpiro See also what they say in their actuarial memo: individual mandate uncertainty from AHCA/Trump is built into even the 8.8% increase https://t.co/KzbkI3mhnc
From actuarial memo accompanying BCBS NC's rate filing (h/t @sarahL202) https://t.co/pQTUiKJsBV
From NC's detailed rate filing, even 8.8% rate increase is higher than it would be w/out AHCA &amp; Trump uncertainty re the ACA mandate https://t.co/g6rgsY831Z

CBO: Coverage losses are largest for lower-income older people, but uninsured rates rise for moderate-income and young pple too https://t.co/21C1aLAUZc
No ambiguity from CBO: guaranteed issue w/out community rating and benefits standards is meaningless https://t.co/uc4hsOBgiN
CBO explains who's most at risk if the ACA's essential health benefits standards are weakened https://t.co/NHRXUXDlj3
CBO makes clear Upton incentives for states to waive protections have impact https://t.co/tN28HDsrUf
In fact, CBO finds it makes things worse: since states only get $ if they waive community rating, more states do so, meaning more pple hurt https://t.co/11dCu1cPud

Noteworthy: WV has seen biggest % drop in non-elderly adult uninsured rate since 2013 in these data: cut by 2/3(!) from 28.8% to 9.5% 6/6
States w/ &lt; 1/10 non-elderly adults uninsured: CA, CT, DE, HI, IL, IA, KY, MD, MA, MI, MN, NJ, NY, OH, PA, RI, WA, WV, WI 5/6
12 states have cut non-elderly adult uninsured rate more than in half since 2013: AR, CA, CT, DE, IL, KY, MD, NV, RI, UT, WA, WV 4/6
Medicaid expansion states have cut uninsured rate for non-elderly adults more than in half: now 9.2%, v. 20.1% in 2010 &amp; 18.4% in 2013 3/6
Uninsured rate for non-elderly adults now 12.4%, down from 22.3% in 2010 2/6

More will do the same the more he repeats it – and some insurers will pull out of markets if they think Admin might stop payments on a whim
These threats have real costs: insurers like TN Blue already say they’re pricing in risk Trump makes good on his threat

Lots more bad things in all AHCA versions (https://t.co/LKd0rEHRhD https://t.co/9uq8nfgu1I) but these 5 are in DNA of this bill #NotFixable
5. $50k+ tax cuts for millionaires, which, btw, come in part at the expense of Medicare Trust Fund https://t.co/SpYjhT3e1j
4. ↑ premiums &amp; deductibles for millions in marketplace: w/$300b in subsidy cuts, “fixes” to this just rearrange who pays more https://t.co/c3qIjdQIdW
3. Deep cuts to Medicaid for seniors, pple w/disabilities, kids – combined w/ending expansion, Medicaid cut = $839b https://t.co/8EBNGkSW0j
2. Cuts would force states to end Medicaid expansion: reverses progress on coverage, access to care, financial security https://t.co/EpQkh0guOg
1. Rolls back ACA coverage gains – latest CBO estimate is 24m ↑ uninsured ↔ 1/10 non-elderly people w/coverage would lose it https://t.co/wAxMSvmiOH

.@MattAFiedler @JudyCBPP 4. 84% of people age 55-64 have pre-existing conditions; their premiums would rise by thousands of $ under base House bill
.@MattAFiedler 3. Per @JudyCBPP, per-capita Medicaid cap means big cuts to home- and community-based services for people w/disabilities
.@MattAFiedler 2. Bill ends ACA Medicaid expansion; covers 11m w/high rates of pre-ex, esp. mental health https://t.co/dtF4znswFG https://t.co/Bh8TC40rQo
1. Per @MattAFiedler, letting states waive EHB lets employer plans nationwide bring back lifetime &amp; annual limits https://t.co/a50voCaAae
Here are 5 ways House bill hurts people w/pre-ex that Upton-Long amendment doesn’t even claim to fix
If additional states drop protections, harm to people w/pre-ex outweighs benefits of $8B 4/4
So, Upton-Long amendment actually encourages more states to end pre-ex protections 3/4
Only states that get waivers to end pre-ex protections could get any of the new $8B (per latest news accounts) 2/4
Sounds like latest House bill could actually be even worse for people with pre-ex. Here’s why: 1/4
@jenhab If $ is only for waiver states, that's even more incentive for states to end protections; could be even worse for those w/pre-ex than before
