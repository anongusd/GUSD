We now use Macao, a spelling change from Macau, reflecting usage. It stands alone in datelines. 	This change is live on AP Stylebook Online and will appear in the print 2019 AP Stylebook, which is coming on May 29.
Sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are broad terms that can cover a wide variety of actions or behavior. Be as specific as possible in describing the kinds of behavior that is being alleged or admitted, such as groping, unwanted kissing, disrobing or verbal abuse.
New on Stylebook Online: A genre of music that originated in Puerto Rico, reggaeton fuses hip-hop with Latin American and Caribbean rhythms. Its vocals include rapping and singing. https://t.co/XzR7O9UZVO
South Korean names are written as two names, with the given name hyphenated and a lowercase letter after the hyphen: Moon Jae-in. Use Moon on second reference.	In both Koreas, the family name comes first.	https://t.co/oIFccVvQpk
The style and spelling of names in North Korea and South Korea follow each government's policy for transliterations unless the subject has a personal preference.	North Korean names are written as three separate words, each capitalized: Kim Jong Un. Use Kim on second reference.
We use actor for a man and actress for a woman, but it is acceptable to use actor for a woman if she prefers it. 	Read AP's coverage of the best actor and actress winners, and more, from the Oscars:	https://t.co/0wTxKgzgiC
Use figures with million, billion or trillion in all except casual uses: I'd like to make a billion dollars. But: The nation has 1 million citizens. I need $7 billion. 	In headlines, abbreviate only millions, billions: $5M lawsuit, $17.4B trade deficit.	https://t.co/aLcd19sa5f
AP does not use trademark or copyright symbols in our text. 	A trademark is a brand, symbol, word, etc., protected by law to prevent a competitor from using it. In general, use a generic equivalent unless the trademark name is essential to the story. https://t.co/6kcv5Uni8v
Karl Lagerfeld, a German-born designer who moved to Paris in his teens, was best known as the longtime creative director at Chanel. He also designed for Fendi and under his own name. Also a photographer, he often shot his own ad campaigns.	He died today. https://t.co/hiX9bZo8cC

You can also give some love to your parents on Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May, and Father's Day, the third Sunday in June.  #APStyleChat
You're popping Champagne if it's a sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France. If it's made elsewhere, call it sparkling wine. #APStyleChat
Going on a Valentine's Day getaway to a bed-and-breakfast? B&amp;B is acceptable on second reference. #APStyleChat
Whenever possible, phrasing that acknowledges both people in the relationship is preferred: "The two were romantically (or sexually) involved." #APStyleChat (3/3)
When a relationship is not long-term or does not involve financial support, do not use mistress; terms like companion, friend or lover may apply. #APStyleChat (2/3)
We say it’s OK to use the term mistress for a woman who has a long-term sexual relationship with, and is financially supported by, a man who is married to someone else. #APStyleChat (1/3)
Generally use the name a person prefers: Martine McCarthy Chang may prefer McCarthy Chang or Chang on second reference. #APStyleChat
In general, don’t use courtesy titles (Mr., Mrs., Ms.) except in direct quotations. When you need to distinguish between two people who use the same last name, as in married couples or brothers and sisters, use the first and last name. #APStyleChat
The term same-sex marriage is preferred over gay marriage. In places where it’s legal, same-sex marriage is no different than other marriages, so the term should be used only when germane and needed to distinguish from marriages between heterosexual couples.  #APStyleChat
If a couple requests not to use the terms fiance and fiancee, or if a gender-neutral option is needed, describe couples as engaged or planning to marry or similar phrasing. #APStyleChat (2/2)
Fiance (man) and fiancee (woman) are generally acceptable to describe anyone who is engaged to be married, regardless of sexual orientation. We don’t use accent marks for those terms. #APStyleChat (1/2)
Oh, and we’ve never actually used the adverb swooningly. But you can. #APStyleChat (2/2)
To swoon can mean to faint. It can also mean to feel strong, especially in a rapturous sort of way. Or a swoon can be a period of poor performance. Like love, our language can be confusing. #APStyleChat (1/2)
Looking for love? You might consider a person’s character, reputation or both. Character refers to moral qualities. Reputation refers to the way a person is regarded by others. #APStyleChat
When used in the sense of two people, the word “couple” takes plural verbs and pronouns: The couple were married Monday and left on their honeymoon. They will return in two weeks. In the sense of a single unit, use a singular verb: Each couple was asked to give $10. #APStyleChat
Use a possessive form after only the last word if ownership is joint: Fred and Maria's apartment, Fred and Maria's stocks. Use a possessive form after both words if the objects are individually owned: Fred's and Maria's books. #APStyleChat
These are both right: Julie and her husband, Amir, went shopping. Julie and husband Amir went shopping. #APStyleChat (3/3)
But don’t confuse that with the correct punctuation when a nonessential word is used as a descriptive adjective. The distinguishing clue often is the lack of an article or pronoun. #APStyleChat (2/3)
When writing about your spouse, be sure to use the comma in constructions such as: “I love my husband, Nicky.” If you leave out the comma, it indicates you have at least one other husband: “I love my husband Nicky but am less fond of my husband Joe.” #APStyleChat (1/3)
The weight of precious stones, especially diamonds, is expressed in carats. The proportion of pure gold used with an alloy is expressed in karats. A caret is a writer's and a proofreader's mark. Giving carrots for Valentine's Day isn't your best move. Try bonbons. #APStyleChat
Maybe you’ll buss your mate and get busses in return. To buss means to kiss, especially in an unrestrained or playful manner. We don’t recommend bussing a table, but restaurant workers will bus it after your romantic dinner. #APStyleChat
For generic terms, the married couple works. 	Regardless of sexual orientation, husband for a man or wife for a woman is acceptable in all references in any legally recognized marriage. Spouse or partner may be used if requested or as a gender-neutral option. #APStyleChat https://t.co/aLzwk6kMFf
Sweethearts mark Valentine’s Day by exchanging valentines. Do not, under any circumstance, write that they exchange valentine’s. And when they marry, they do not become the Jacob’s. #APStyleChat
Are you ready for Valentine’s Day? Give that apostrophe some love. We use the possessive because the day honors a saint martyred in third-century Rome. We’re not entirely clear on the connection to hearts and flowers. #APStyleChat

Thanks for joining here today. @oskargarcia is ready and waiting if you still have questions. #APStyleChat https://t.co/OpbZQ2kXOL
If two gamblers bet $25 on opposite sides, the loser loses $25, the winner is paid her original wager plus winnings of about $22.50 — the stake from the loser, less fees of about 10 percent from the casino for administering the bet. Revenue is $2.50, handle is $50. #APStyleChat
It's easy to confuse gambling revenue with handle, so be careful. 	Revenue is the money kept by casinos after paying out winners on their wagers. Handle is casino jargon for the amount of money wagered. #APStyleChat
Backdoor covers are when a bet flips in the final moments because of plays that are unusual and irrelevant to the actual outcome. For example, a 3-pointer at the end of a Pacers-Cavaliers game helped Indiana cover the spread of 5 1/2 because of a 105-101 loss. #APStyleChat
Bad beats generally happen when an outcome looks all but certain before something truly unexpected happens. The key to a bad beat is when a defeat flips seemingly overwhelming odds, especially late in a game. The term is also common in poker. #APStyleChat
Bad beat and backdoor cover are similar but not mutually exclusive terms to describe bets that flip unexpectedly, generally based on unusual play. Both terms can be subjective, and it is important to detail the circumstances of the game to explain the descriptions. #APStyleChat
"Gaming" versus "gambling" as the preferred term can spark debate, but our style has been gambling for a long time.	Avoid the term gaming except in direct quotes, in proper names or when referring to video games. It's often used as a euphemism to downplay gambling.	#APStyleChat
For betting odds, use figures and a hyphen: The odds were 5-4; he won despite 3-2 odds against him. 	The word "to" usually isn't necessary, but when it appears, it should be hyphenated in all constructions: 3-to-2 odds, odds of 3-to-2, the odds were 3-to-2. #APStyleChat
Sportsbook, one word, refers to places where sports bets are accepted either in person or online. Use two words only if part of a formal name. #apstylechat
New terms include favorite, underdog and upset, combined in one entry.	Basically, don't use the terms if they don't match what the betting markets say. It's not an upset if a team is favored by sportsbooks.  #apstylechat
Legislatures are debating more than just allowing sports bets; there are many issues like how much to tax wagers and who should be allowed to offer the bets. #apstylechat
We put together this new Topical Guide because sports betting is a major legislative topic for many states in 2019. A Supreme Court ruling last year opened that door and places like New Jersey, Delaware and Mississippi began accepting bets. #apstylechat	https://t.co/gl8C6w79pa

Heroin is an opioid related to morphine, but more potent and addictive. Authorities attribute recent increases in heroin use largely to crackdowns on prescription opioids like Vicodin and OxyContin, which contain similar chemicals and can produce a similar high.

VR and AR are acceptable on second reference. (3/3)	https://t.co/aY6hjKmj3u
A similar concept, augmented reality, involves the projection of interactive computer-generated images into a person's real-world surroundings. (2/3)

Hedging is the act of protecting an investment from potential losses by simultaneously investing in another asset that tends to appreciate when the first investment falls.	This entry is updated now on AP Stylebook Online. It will appear in the 2019 Stylebook this spring. https://t.co/kXHSp1OnW6
@ryanlhonick @bevkeel @LexAlexander @rgay Sorry to hear you aren't finding the mobile-optimized Stylebook Online meets your expectations. We'd love to hear what you'd like to see improved.

GED should be used as an adjective, not as a noun, for the General Educational Development tests designed to measure high school equivalency. Those passing the tests earn a GED diploma or certificate, not a GED.

Use straight-laced for someone strict or severe in behavior or moral views. Reserve strait-laced for the notion of confinement, as in a corset.
Close but not the same:	Couture refers to the design and manufacture of fashionable clothing, usually custom made. 	Couturier is someone who makes and sells couture clothes. https://t.co/ZA1gi7kmOL
Happy New Year!	Capitalize New Year's, New Year's Day and New Year's Eve. 	For resolutions made on or around Jan. 1, the phrase is New Year's resolutions. But lowercase general references to the coming year: What will the new year bring?

With thanks to @EditorMark for the suggestion, we now refer to the people and culture of Ecuador as Ecuadorian. 	This is a change from previous style, reflecting current usage. https://t.co/AeMTVdhsir
It's Christmas Day! 	Never abbreviate Christmas to Xmas or any other form.	The federal legal holiday is observed on Friday if Dec. 25 falls on a Saturday, on Monday if it falls on a Sunday. (This year, we have no such concerns, though.)
Happy winter solstice! It's the shortest day of the year, and it's the start of winter. We lowercase the terms winter solstice and summer solstice, as well as the seasons themselves: winter, spring, summer and fall. (No Oxford comma in that simple series.)
Ecuadorian is the term for the people and culture of Ecuador. That spelling is a change from previous style, reflecting current usage.
AP Stylebook editors have made hundreds of changes in recent years. Some are high profile, many are not. Are you keeping up with the latest AP style guidance? https://t.co/7gsfDxHvQx https://t.co/KD3Kaxb6sp
To avoid any suggestion that someone is being judged before a trial, do not use a phrase such as "sued for malfeasance." Instead, say the lawsuit "accuses her of malfeasance" or "he was named in a lawsuit accusing him of libel."
Lowercase “congressional” unless part of a proper name: congressional salaries, the Congressional Quarterly, the Congressional Record.

When a month is used with a specific date, abbreviate only Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov. and Dec. Examples: Jan. 1, Feb. 14, March 15, July 4, Dec. 31. Spell out when using the month alone or with a year alone: February is not my favorite month. I look forward to July 2021.
Don't confuse baloney (foolish or exaggerated talk) with bologna (the sausage or luncheon meat).

A boycott is an organized refusal to buy a particular product or service, or to deal with a particular merchant or group of merchants. An embargo is a legal restriction against trade. It usually prohibits goods from entering or leaving a country. The plural is embargoes.
The basic guideline about punctuation is to use common sense. Punctuation is to make clear the thought being expressed. If punctuation does not help make clear what is being said, it should not be there. Also, don't sign your holiday cards, "From the Martin's."
When using the word "in" to indicate that something is in vogue, use quotation marks only if followed by a noun: It was the "in" thing to do. Raccoon coats are in again.

The terms "accident" or "crash" are generally acceptable for vehicle collisions and wrecks. But when negligence is claimed or proven, avoid "accident," which can be read as a term exonerating the person responsible. In such cases, use "crash," "collision" or other terms.

The weather service defines snow flurries as an intermittent light snowfall of short duration (generally light snow showers) with no measurable accumulation (trace category). #APStyleChat https://t.co/VvwxRRvJxe
It's snow cover, two words for the noun, but hyphenated as a compound modifier: snow-covered ground. #APStyleChat https://t.co/il2o627x2i
It's de-ice, but hypothermia and subzero don't take a hyphen. #APStyleChat
A winter storm watch alerts the public that there is a potential for heavy snow or significant ice accumulations. The watch is usually issued at least 24 to 36 hours in advance. #APStyleChat (2/2)
A winter storm warning notifies the public that a winter storm is producing, or is forecast to produce, heavy snow or significant ice accumulations. #APStyleChat (1/2)
Snow depths are a measurement so they take figures even for numbers less than 10: 5 feet of snow, 30 feet of snow. #APStyleChat
What might happen after a big snowfall: cancellations by schools and airlines. Note the double letter there. But just one “l” in canceled and canceling. #APStyleChat
If schools declare a snow day, you might use the time to put up a snow fence and use two words for each of those. #APStyleChat (2/2)
Wear a snowsuit and use a snowblower or snowplow to clear snowdrifts after a snowfall, then lick snowflakes, throw snowballs, build a snowman, and go snowshoeing, snowboarding or snowmobiling. #APStyleChat (1/2)
No hyphen in wind chill or wind chill factor. The wind chill is a calculation that describes the combined effect of the wind and cold temperatures on exposed skin. The weather service has a handy calculator here: https://t.co/R12dqYTkoo  #APStyleChat
Temperatures get higher or lower, but they don't get warmer or cooler. Right: Temperatures are expected to rise on Friday. Wrong: Temperatures are expected to warm up on Friday. #APStyleChat (2/2)
For temperatures, use figures for all except zero. Use a word, not a minus sign, to indicate temperatures below zero. The low was minus 10. The low was 10 below zero. Also: 5-degree temperatures, temperatures fell 5 degrees, temperatures in the 30s. #APStyleChat (1/2)
No, it should not be capitalized. #APStyleChat https://t.co/SihiIUy6xF
Both freezing drizzle and freezing rain are synonyms for ice storm. Significant accumulations, which can take down power lines, are usually one-quarter of an inch or greater. #APStyleChat (3/3)
Freezing drizzle or freezing rain is a drizzle or rain that falls as a liquid but freezes into glaze upon contact with the cold ground or surface structures. #APStyleChat (2/3)
Drizzle is precipitation consisting of numerous minute droplets of water less than 0.5 mm in diameter. Rain is precipitation that falls to earth in drops more than 0.5 mm in diameter. #APStyleChat (1/3)
The term heavy snow generally means either a snowfall accumulating to 4 inches or more in depth in 12 hours, or a snowfall accumulating to 6 inches or more in depth in 24 hours. #APStyleChat
The flip side of El Nino is La Nina, which is an occasional but natural cooling of the equatorial Pacific that also changes weather worldwide. #APStyleChat (4/4)
The weather service says this winter looks wet and especially mild for much of the U.S., thanks to a weak El Nino brewing. #APStyleChat (3/4)
AP doesn’t use the tilde over the “n,” because not all computer systems reproduce the tilde. In some cases, the tilde will appear as a written word enclosed in parentheses (tilde). #APStyleChat (2/4)
El Nino is a naturally occurring worldwide climate phenomenon that starts with unusually warm water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and then changes weather worldwide. #APStyleChat (1/4)
If it's a blizzard, yes, just call it a blizzard.	A blizzard carries wind speeds of 35 mph or more and considerable falling and/or blowing of snow with visibility of less than one-quarter mile for three or more hours. #APStyleChat https://t.co/LdtrC6z9lR
But at times some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing unusually cold weather south and permitting warmer weather to creep up north. #APStyleChat (3/3)
It is a normal pattern that is stronger in the winter and keeps some of the coldest weather bottled up near the North Pole. The jet stream usually pens the polar vortex in and keeps it north. #APStyleChat (2/3)
The term polar vortex usually refers to the gigantic circular upper air weather pattern in the Arctic region, enveloping the North Pole (but it can apply to the South Pole, too). #APStyleChat (1/3)
AP style is to lowercase for the adjective meaning frigid; capitalize for the region around the North Pole. Arctic Circle, arctic fox, Arctic Ocean.	If you're referred to air specifically from the Arctic, then yes, capitalize. https://t.co/WWOKLNc8H1

An Alberta Clipper is a severe storm, often with snowfall, originating in western Canada and typically moving east and southeast across the U.S. This low pressure area is usually accompanied by light snow, strong winds and colder temperatures. #APStyleChat
Nor’easters often produce heavy snow or rain, as well as waves along Atlantic beaches that can cause erosion and structural damage. Wind gusts associated with these storms can exceed hurricane force in intensity. #APStyleChat (2/2)
The National Weather Service uses the term nor'easter for storms that either exit or move north along the East Coast, producing winds blowing from the northeast. #APStyleChat (1/2)

You're absolutely right, the spiral-bound book and a Stylebook Online subscription are completely separate. 	We used to offer a bundled option but not many people took advantage of it. It seems most people prefer one or the other.	https://t.co/sLPbbNstwg https://t.co/O6HATWTpKE
Don't use a hyphen between adverbs ending in -ly and adjectives they modify: an easily remembered rule, a badly damaged island, a fully informed candidate.
Lowercase mpg, no periods, is acceptable in all references to mean miles per gallon when paired with a figure: The car got 40 mpg. But write out in general uses: “My car gets a lot of miles per gallon,” he said. https://t.co/EDeQYO9HWr
Two people look at each other. More than two look at one another. Either phrase may be used when the number is indefinite: We help each other. We help one another.

With many thanks to the fans who shared feedback, we have revised our definition:	Friendsgiving is a Thanksgiving-style gathering with friends instead of family. Friendsgiving is sometimes celebrated in addition to traditional Thanksgiving; others observe it on Thanksgiving Day.
Friendsgiving is a Thanksgiving-style gathering with friends instead of family. Usually held in late November on a day other than the fourth Thursday, Friendsgiving is celebrated in addition to traditional Thanksgiving, not instead of it.
In narrative, spell out nine and under except for yard lines in football and individual and team statistical performances: The ball was on the 5-yard line. 	In basketball, 3-point play and 3-point shot.
AP style tips on sports scores and standings:	Ohio State beat Maryland 52-51 (No comma between the team and the score); led 3-2; a 6-1-2 record (six wins, one loss, two ties).
We prefer the term craft brewery instead of microbrewery to describe a small, independent beer producer. 	We prefer draft beer, not draught. 	And we prefer beers that follow AP style.	Now if you show up with a six-pack that uses an Oxford comma, we're not saying we'd decline. https://t.co/Wt0dydmQAu
Subscribers to Stylebook Online have been curious about how to style it, as well: #MeToo or Me Too? Quotes around it? Capitalize Movement? 	We recommend #MeToo movement. 	Subscribers can see the Q&amp;A on Ask the Editor: https://t.co/sOFgP7NlEm https://t.co/1qLdudu324
It refers to elected officials whose term extends beyond the time of the election in which they were not re-elected, or elected officials near the end of their term who are not seeking re-election and are therefore regarded as having little remaining influence.(2/2)
The noun lame duck is two words, while the adjective lame-duck takes a hyphen, as in lame-duck session or lame-duck politician. (1/2)
We happen to know where you could take care of that: https://t.co/8UXP4jz1Xr 	But even without a new Stylebook, you knew that ages always take a numeral, even when it's a number less than 10. https://t.co/TI9gLURxdx
Asylum-seekers are people who have left their country of origin and applied for asylum status, typically fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. 	Asylum-seeker is not interchangeable with refugee.
We happen to know where you could take care of that: https://t.co/8UXP4jz1Xr	But even without a new Stylebook, you knew that ages always take a numeral, even when it's a number less than 10.		https://t.co/Jk2kTi9qaD

The preferred term to describe a person who fights fire is firefighter.
Great use of downtime: Reading your Stylebook.	You might be surprised what you've forgotten was in there or what's changed since you last looked ... or what you swore was a rule, but actually, you remembered it wrong.	We're not saying this ever happens to us, of course. https://t.co/onpXFhGTkl
We just say foil, not tin foil or aluminum foil. #APStyleChat
Thanks for asking.	The plural of teaspoonful is teaspoonfuls, not teaspoonsful.	The plural of cupful is cupfuls, not cupsful. #APStyleChat https://t.co/v3FFIFEuYJ
Thanks for joining today! 	You can help yourself to more food style in your Stylebook or on Stylebook Online if you get hungry later. #APStyleChat
Either frosting or icing can be used to describe a topping of sugar, butter and other ingredients applied to cookies, cakes and other pastries. 	Use of the terms varies regionally in the U.S. 	Both cookies and cakes can be glazed (drizzled with a thin sugar mixture). #APStyleChat
Now how about this for frosting on the cake? 	We have revised AP style guidance about frosting and icing that we posted today on AP Stylebook Online. #APStyleChat
Common varieties of sugar include brown, granulated (white), powdered (preferred to confectioners'), superfine and turbinado (a raw sugar). In recipes, if only granulated sugar is called for, "sugar" can be used alone.  #APStyleChat
We prefer the term “baking sheet” to “cookie sheet” because, while cookies are grand, they’re not the only stars of these sheets. #APStyleChat
If you enjoy too much (capitalized) Champagne on New Year's Eve, you might wake up on New Year's Day with a hangover (one word). #APStyleChat
We don't say "preheat the oven to 350 F." Instead, we just heat the oven. You're getting it up to temperature, so you're heating it. This applies whether you're making turkey for a crowd or just throwing in a frozen pizza. We won't judge. #APStyleChat
If you're too exhausted to even reheat leftovers on Black Friday, takeout as a noun and adjective is one word. As a verb, it’s take out. #APStyleChat
If your turkey is taking longer to cook than you planned on, you might need to make a PB&amp;J for the kids while you wait. That's acceptable on first reference for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. #APStyleChat
Sugarplums and fruitcake are both one word, and they’re probably best eaten one at a time. Also one word: eggnog, gingerbread, cornbread, cornmeal, cornstarch. If the craving strikes you during the holidays, be sure to use two words for corn dog. #APStyleChat
If you’re heading for a Chinese restaurant on Christmas Day, try some General Tso’s chicken, egg foo young and egg rolls. #APStyleChat
You're right, bloody mary is lowercase, and plural is bloody marys, not maries. #APStyleChat https://t.co/cmDZNIXS1h
For Hanukkah, popular foods include anything cooked in oil, to commemorate the eight-day-burning light at the center of the holiday. For the same reason, some people eat goose, for all the fat. All-occasion treats such as challah and kugel might also be served. #APStyleChat
Thanks. Our primary dictionary, Webster's New World College Dictionary, does capitalize it and recognize it is named for Colby, Wisconsin. We will take another look at our guidance. #APStyleChat https://t.co/PciX1HSx8h
Many holiday dinners will feature tamales, tostones, panettone (sort of like fruitcake, but light), rice pudding and coquito (sort of like eggnog).  #APStyleChat
Yes, any food or drink item that's named for a proper noun keeps the capitalization, so Philly cheesesteak (or Philadelphia cheesesteak) would be capitalized, for example. 	And cheesesteak is one word.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/DT8XBAiIyL
@Dr_MatthewSwann Thanks for the feedback. We will take that suggestion to the Stylebook editing team. #APStyleChat
If you can’t decide which bird to serve, there’s always turducken: a deboned chicken stuffed inside a deboned duck stuffed inside a deboned turkey. 	Stuffing goes in between each bird. #APStyleChat https://t.co/WKeYkxkLuQ
Dressing is cooked outside of the bird; stuffing is cooked inside. 	Use of the terms also varies regionally in the U.S., with one preferred over the other in some places regardless of how it's prepared. #APStyleChat
Capitalize brand names and trademarks: Roquefort cheese, Tabasco sauce. #APStyleChat
Similarly, Swiss and American cheese are capitalized, but cheddar, colby and manchego are lowercase. #APStyleChat
Wine names for grape varietals, such as chardonnay and shiraz, are not capitalized. Wines named for regions, such as Champagne or Chianti, are capitalized. #APStyleChat
Wine and cheese don't just go together nicely. They also follow the same rule for capitalization: Generally lowercase, but capitalize when named for a region. #APStyleChat
If you like to eat your (lowercase) french fries with ketchup, it's not catchup or catsup. #APStyleChat
To french means to trim the meat from the end of a bone, or to cut thin strips (often string beans). #APStyleChat
Lowercase french fries because "french" refers to the style of cut, not the nation. #APStyleChat
It's potluck, one word, and we love when everyone brings their favorite dish. #APStyleChat https://t.co/Anr4qS8hRI
Names of food items and drinks are generally lowercase. The exception is when they are named for a proper noun, such as French bread, bananas Foster, a Manhattan. #APStyleChat
Time to dish up the #APStyleChat.	@ShelleyA, global news manager and longtime lifestyles editor, is here to answer your questions about food style.
Use square miles to describe the size of fires. The fire has burned nearly 4 1/2 square miles of hilly brush land. Use acres only when the fire is less than a square mile. 	When possible, be descriptive: The fire is the size of Denver.
In general, spell out numbers at the start of a sentence. A few exceptions are years and combinations of letter(s) and number(s).	This is new guidance in the 2018 AP Stylebook, and note the use of 3D, no hyphen, as well. https://t.co/fRIxEPUF4o

The federal legal holiday Veterans Day, observed on the fourth Monday in October during the mid-1970s, reverted to Nov. 11 in 1978.	Formerly Armistice Day, it marks the anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I in 1918, and honors all armed forces veterans.
Thanks for the catch. Even veterans of AP style make mistakes.	We will delete this tweet and send a corrected version.

Some words you might use in postelection coverage: runoff, recount, re-elect.	We follow our primary dictionary, Webster's New World College Dictionary, on the style of recount and runoff. 	We use a hyphen in re-elect but Webster’s New World does not.

Wicca is a religion shaped by pagan beliefs and practices. Wiccan is both an adjective and a noun. https://t.co/DjUCAPClA8
A Jewish congregation is autonomous. No synods, assemblies or hierarchies control the activities of an individual synagogue.	The spiritual leader of congregation is called a rabbi, while the individual who leads the congregation in song is called a cantor.
Some prefer the form antisemitic because they contend anti-Semitic suggests being opposed to (the) Semites, which include Arabs and other peoples, when in fact the word means “anti-Jewish.” (2/2)
We follow Webster's New World College Dictionary's punctuation of anti-Semitic, meaning having or showing prejudice against Jews.  (1/2)
The Secret Service is a federal agency administered by the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service Uniformed Division, which protects the president's residence and offices and the embassies in Washington, formerly was known as the Executive Protective Service.

AP style: Capitalize common nouns such as party, river, street when they are an integral part of the full name: Republican Party, Mississippi River, Fleet Street. Lowercase these common nouns when they stand alone in subsequent references: the party, the river, the street.
Over four years ago, we changed our guidance to say "over" is acceptable in all uses to indicate greater numerical value: Salaries went up over $20 a week. The crop is worth over $5 billion. Over time, dissenters may grow to love this change.

Slang terms such as weed, reefer, ganja or 420 are acceptable in limited, colloquial cases or in quotations.
Some governments and other entities prefer cannabis because of arguments that the term marijuana was popularized in the United States in the early 20th century to stoke anti-Mexican sentiment.
Marijuana is the dried flower of the cannabis plant, used as a drug for recreational or medical purposes. Cannabis is the usual term outside North America; it and pot are also acceptable. 	We added expanded guidance on marijuana terms this year.	https://t.co/na4jIsnZ7x
Stylebook Online subscribers have the option to add Webster’s New World College Dictionary entries. Seeing the results in one place is helpful in cases when the AP Stylebook is silent because we’re deferring to a Webster’s New World entry we agree with. #DictionaryDay (6/6)
We also consult the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, and Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language (published by Merriam-Webster). (Oxford comma added for clarity.)  #DictionaryDay (5/6)
Fun facts: The first edition of Webster's New World College Dictionary was published in 1953. The second edition, in 1970, was the first dictionary to identify Americanisms – terms and usages that first appeared in the U.S. or that were coined by Americans. #DictionaryDay 4/6)
If Webster's New World College Dictionary provides definitions under two spellings for the same sense of a word, either use is acceptable. #DictionaryDay (3/6)
If Webster's New World College Dictionary provides different spellings in separate entries (tee shirt and T-shirt, for example), use the spelling that is followed by a full definition (T-shirt). #DictionaryDay (2/6)
Happy #DictionaryDay! Today we honor the AP Stylebook's official dictionary, Webster's New World College Dictionary (no relation to Merriam-Webster). AP style: Use the first spelling in Webster's New World College Dictionary unless the Stylebook lists a specific exception. (1/6)

Thanks for joining our #APStyleChat on politics and polling. Don't forget to vote on or before Election Day (note caps), Nov. 6. Our next Twitter chat, in November, will cover holiday food.
Polls tell us only who is leading when the poll is taken, not who will win. Things can change once voters cast their ballots. #APStyleChat (6/6)
Every story based on a poll should include sample size and a description of the methodology. Details help readers evaluate validity and significance. #APStyleChat (5/6)
Reporting on public opinion research requires rigorous inspection of a poll’s methodology, provenance and results. Among questions to ask in deciding whether to use a poll: Who did it/paid for it?  #APStyleChat (4/6)
That’s not to say such polls are verboten. They can and should inform reporting on political campaigns. But while part of the story, they’re never the whole story. #APStyleChat (3/6)
Here’s a sampling from that chapter: Poll results that seek to preview the outcome of an election must never be the lead, headline or single subject of any story. #APStyleChat (2/6)
We recommend consulting the Stylebook’s chapter on polls and surveys (new in 2018) for reminders any time you deal with a poll or survey. #APStyleChat  (1/6)
A wave election is an election in which one party makes dramatic gains. #APStyleChat
Fundraiser and fundraising are single words in all uses. Re-elect and re-election are hyphenated. #APStyleChat
The terms Republican and Republican Party are capitalized. The shorthand GOP, standing for Grand Old Party, may be used on second reference for the Republican Party. #APStyleChat
The terms Democrat and Democratic Party are capitalized. Don’t use the term Democrat Party unless quoting someone. #APStyleChat
A candidate's political party is essential information in any election, campaign or issue story. #APStyleChat
@dani_keenan There are many ways to vote early in Canada. So this is good advice for our friends north of the border as well. #APStyleChat
Capitalize the word "Congress" when referring to the U.S. Senate and House together. The adjective "congressional" is lowercase unless part of a formal name. #APStyleChat
A majority is more than half the votes cast; a plurality is the largest number of votes, but less than a majority. #APStyleChat
It's OK to discuss the number of precincts reporting if you give the context: The 25 of 27 precincts reporting don’t include Cassabawa County, which accounts for a third of the state’s registered voters. #APStyleChat (2/2)
Generally avoid discussing the number of precincts reporting. In states with large numbers of absentee and early vote ballots, the number of “precincts reporting” may one or two, but account for as much as half of the total vote in a state. #APStyleChat (1/2)
@lindsayrassmann Use figures and capitalize "district" when joined with a figure: the 1st Congressional District, the 1st District. Lowercase "district" or "congressional district" whenever it stands alone. #APStyleChat
Spell out below 10 in other phrases related to voting: by a five-vote majority, with three abstentions, four votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority. #APStyleChat (5/5)
Don’t use large vote totals as an adjective. In other words, don’t write the 27,292-26,157 vote. The hyphen is OK with smaller totals, such as the 402-233 vote. #APStyleChat (4/5)
Use the word “votes” if there is any possibility that the figures could be confused with a ratio: Hernandez defeated Sweitzer 16 votes to 7 votes in the dogcatcher race. Also: Always use figures, not words, for vote totals even under 10. #APStyleChat (3/5)
For results that involve fewer than 1,000 votes on each side, use a hyphen: Marissa Hernandez outpolled Jim Sweitzer 845-711. #APStyleChat (2/5)
#APStyleChat
Reporting election returns: Use the word "to" (not a hyphen) in separating totals listed together if at least one total is more than 1,000: Marissa Hernandez outpolled Jim Sweitzer 3,512 to 2,399. #APStyleChat (1/5)
Avoid the phrase “head to the polls.” It doesn’t account for the roughly 40 percent of the electorate that will cast a ballot before Election Day.
We capitalize Election Day but lowercase election night for the November national elections in the United States. #APStyleChat

In general, call children 15 or younger by their first name on second reference. But use the last name if the seriousness of the story calls for it. 	For ages 16 and 17, use judgment, but generally go with the surname unless it's a light story.	Use the surname for 18 and older.

The designation of a day as a federal legal holiday means that federal employees receive the day off or are paid overtime if they must work. Other requirements that may apply to holidays generally are left to the states. (3/3)
The federal legal holidays are New Year's, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. (2/3)
Today is Columbus Day, the federal legal holiday on the second Monday in October. 	Some localities mark it as Indigenous Peoples Day, a holiday celebrating the original inhabitants of North America. (1/3)
Indeed, we reworked it in more ways than one! Thanks again to you and your students, @irenemckisson
STEM is acceptable on first reference for science, technology, engineering and math, but spell out the full phrase shortly thereafter.
We heard your requests to clarify the style of coworking, as in sharing a work space but not having the same employer. It's one of the Stylebook's new entries this year. https://t.co/KBGJykA4DF
Thank you for pointing that out, @irenemckisson. That entry was written years ago, and clearly no one has reviewed it since then. We will attend to it now.
Until the shorthand becomes more broadly known, wording such as the North American free trade agreement (note lowercase) or the agreement’s full name is preferred on first reference when possible. USMCA replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. (2/2)
USMCA is acceptable but not preferred on first reference for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement; provide the full name and a brief definition soon after the first reference. (1/2)
@nastiatherdhead Yes, we will have a midterms topical guide. I don't know yet when it will be available. We had a guide for 2016, if you're a subscriber: https://t.co/Aqk4yTjYGw
FBI is acceptable in all references to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. To avoid alphabet soup, however, use "the bureau" in some references.
Good news! 	Doctors are expecting the patient to emerge from an induced comma and make a full recovery. https://t.co/LKZ6pkSize
Thanks for joining #APStyleChat today.	In coming months, we plan to host chats focusing on elections and polling, food, weather, and technology.	Note the use of the Oxford comma, because an integral part of the series uses a conjunction (elections and polling).
You don't need a comma before those words at the end of a sentence unless you want to put particular emphasis on the word. #APStyleChat https://t.co/3gXnzspw3C
Her friend Paula didn't answer the RSVP, but her friend Colleen did.	The name is essential information so don't set it off in commas.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/PbZ9DAaEPR
Semicolons also can link independent clauses in place of a coordinating conjunction: I asked him to marry me; he declined. A period also could work in that example. #APStyleChat (5/5)
Example: He is survived by a son, John Smith, of Chicago; three daughters, Jane Smith, of Wichita, Kansas, Mary Smith, of Denver, and Susan Franklin, of Boston; and a sister, Martha McCoy, of Omaha, Nebraska. #APStyleChat (4/5)
Use semicolons when individual segments in the series have material that also must be set off by commas. #APStyleChat (3/5)
Right: I love talking about commas; it’s my favorite topic. Right: I love talking about commas. It’s my favorite topic. Wrong: I love talking about commas, it’s my favorite topic. #APStyleChat
The semicolon conveys more separation of thought and information than a comma conveys, but less than a period conveys. Sometimes a period works where a semicolon works. Usually a comma cannot be substituted for a semicolon. #APStyleChat (1/5)
But don’t use the second comma in constructions such as these: The Fargo, North Dakota-based group; Bellingham, Washington’s proximity to the Canadian border. #APStyleChat (2/2)
Set off state names after cities in constructions such as this: His journey will take him from Fargo, North Dakota, to Selma, Alabama. #APStyleChat (1/2)
When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with a comma: Feb. 14, 2020, is the target date. #APStyleChat
@JosephPriest Especially in casual use, you can decide which rules you do or don't follow. 	Even the most ardent AP style fans deviate from our guidance from time to time.	#APStyleChat
We don't have an entry addressing that yet, but Stylebook editors are talking about it. #APStyleChat https://t.co/QHGgVFaO29
Examples: We are visiting Iowa, but we will miss the state fair. We are visiting Iowa but will miss the state fair. #APStyleChat  (3/3)
As a rule of thumb, use a comma if the subject of each clause is expressly stated. But no comma when the subject of the two clauses is the same and is not repeated in the second. #APStyleChat (2/3)
When a conjunction links two clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences, use a comma in most cases. Example: Today is expected to be the last sunny day in Seattle for months, so I will ride my bicycle. #APStyleChat (1/3)
The British put the comma outside the quotation marks. Maybe you're reading a lot of British news?
In the U.S., the period and the comma always go within the quotation marks. The dash, semicolon, colon, question mark and exclamation point go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. They go outside when they apply to the whole sentence. #APStyleChat https://t.co/yt9ViYQBNI
Example with a descriptive adjective: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made the announcement. Example with a nonessential phrase: The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, made the announcement. #APStyleChat (2/2)
This can get confusing: adjectives vs. nonessential phrases. The distinguishing clue that it's an adjective, not a nonessential phrase, often is the lack of an article or pronoun. No comma with an adjective. But use the comma with a nonessential phrase. #APStyleChat (1/2)
Example: We saw the Oscar-winning movie "Moonlight." The detail "Moonlight" is an essential phrase or word. Many movies have won Oscars. Without the name of the movie, the reader wouldn’t know which movie was meant. No comma before this essential element. #AP StyleChat (4/4)
An essential phrase is critical to understanding the meaning. If the phrase is taken out, the sentence’s meaning changes or isn’t clear. Don’t use commas to set off an essential phrase. Let it flow, comma-free, as an integrated part of the sentence. #APStyleChat (3/4)
Example: The Stylebook’s lead editor, Paula Froke, answers questions daily in Stylebook Online’s Ask the Editor. (Only one person is lead editor. The name is informative, but even without the name the sentence is clear.) #APStyleChat (2/4)
Use commas to set off nonessential phrases. Nonessential phrases provide more information or detail, but they aren’t crucial for accuracy or meaning. Removing a nonessential phrase wouldn’t change the meaning of a sentence. Think of them as parentheticals. #APStyleChat (1/4) https://t.co/koHI59C5vC
Use no comma when the last adjective is an integral element of a noun phrase, which is the equivalent of a single noun. Examples: a cheap fur coat; the old tin bucket; my shiny, red kitchen stools. (The noun phrases: fur coat, tin bucket, kitchen stools.)  #APStyleChat
Use commas to separate a series of adjectives equal in rank: a thoughtful, precise manner. A fast, sleek, sexy car.  If the commas could be replaced by the word "and" without changing the sense, the adjectives are equal. #APStyleChat
But use the comma if its omission would slow comprehension: On the street below, the curious gathered. #APStyleChat (3/3)
The comma may be omitted after short introductory phrases if no ambiguity would result: During the trip he saw many cats. #APStyleChat (2/3)
Other uses of commas: Generally, use a comma after an introductory clause or phrase: When he had tired of Georgia's heat, he moved to Alaska. #APStyleChat (1/3)
Our comma entry has a section about punctuating a direct address. 	Examples: Mother, I will be home late. No, sir, I did not take it.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/M984Z4sVXK
@sledgehammertoe We would use the Oxford comma there. It's essential for accuracy in this example.	Or rewrite to avoid any chance of confusion. #APStyleChat
Use a comma before the last conjunction in a complex series of phrases: Some people believe the Stylebook bans Oxford commas, but we use a comma when it adds clarity, when the final phrase includes a conjunction, or generally when it's not a simple series. #APStyleChat (9/9)
Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction. For example: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast. #APStyleChat (8/9)
If a comma doesn’t help make clear what is being said, don’t use it. But: If the comma is needed for accuracy or clarity, then be sure to use it. That includes the Oxford comma, when you need it for clarity. #APStyleChat (7/9)
Why our Oxford comma style? It's consistent with our general rule for punctuation: Use punctuation that is needed; don't use what's not needed. #APStyleChat (6/9)
The Oxford comma isn’t needed for clarity here, so don’t use it: Her favorite sports are cycling, running and swimming. #APStyleChat (5/9)
Without that second comma, the sentence would say that McConnell and Clinton are astronauts (or strippers). #APStyleChat (4/9)
Of course, we would use the Oxford comma in this example: The speakers included two astronauts, Mitch McConnell, and Hillary Clinton. And yes, that also goes for the various examples involving strippers. #APStyleChat (3/9)
Note! The no-Oxford comma rule applies only to simple series when it's not needed for clarity or accuracy. We certainly call for the comma whenever it's needed to make the meaning clear. #APStyleChat (2/9) https://t.co/NZ51qU8mLi
Let’s start with a topic we rarely hear about: the Oxford comma! We say: Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series: The flag is red, white and blue. He would pick Deb, Xin, Lou or Alfredo. #APStyleChat (1/9)

The term "exponential growth" isn't simply a synonym for a large increase. It's is used when something has grown by increasing amounts. For instance, a population might increase by 5 percent from 1980 to 1990, 10 percent from 1990 to 2000 and 15 percent from 2000 to 2010.

Hurricanes are ranked 1 to 5 according to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Categories 3, 4 and 5 hurricanes are considered major. Florence could make the hardest hurricane punch North Carolina has seen in more than 60 years, with rain and wind of more than 130 mph.
Capitalize "hurricane" when part of the name that weather forecasters assign: Hurricane Florence. Use "it" in pronoun references. If the context is clear, it's OK to use just the name on first reference: Florence rapidly intensified into a fearsome Category 3 hurricane Monday.
@MetsFanInPhilly Thanks for the catch. We will take down the graphic and revise it.

CORRECTED: Where possible, avoid using the term HIPAA, which is an acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Instead refer to privacy laws or the federal law restricting release of medical information. If HIPAA is used in a quote, explain it. https://t.co/AZ1dC72KN0
Yet again, this same rule has gotten us. Of course it’s HIPAA, not HIPPA. We will remove and correct.
CORRECTED: Use the word "elderly" carefully and sparingly. Don't  refer to a  person as elderly unless it's clearly relevant. Apply the  same principle to "senior citizen." The terms are OK in  general  phrases: concern for elderly people, a home for senior citizens,  etc.
On ships and at naval stations ashore, flags are flown at half-mast. Elsewhere ashore, flags are flown at half-staff.

Thanks for joining today! And check out @AP_Top25 and @AP_NFL if you need more football talk.
One last question some of you have asked: Always use figures when talking about yardage. 	He ran 3 yards on second down to the 6. You can say 6-yard line, but yard line is implied in that sentence. #APStyleChat
With that kind of math, we got your back!	In general, team name possessives are not necessary. For example, you could say Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, without an apostrophe. 	The apostrophe generally implies that there's only one.  And Brian Hoyer exists. #APStyleChat https://t.co/58CO6Fnq4j
Watch for incorrect spellings. They can happen anywhere. #APStyleChat https://t.co/zUeUEQkymQ
CTE is acceptable on second reference for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, as well as in headlines. The degenerative brain disease is most closely associated with football but has also been diagnosed in other athletes and military veterans. #APStyleChat
This is where Twitter's character limit is not nearly enough. 	Probably misspelled names. We see them every day from all different sources. #APStyleChat https://t.co/k0AkjoHvkq
Use apostrophes when talking X’s and O’s in football. This is part of our plural entry, similar to minding your p’s and q’s and taking home a report card with four A’s and two B’s. #APStyleChat
Blackshirt mystique. Nicknames, official or unofficial, should be capitalized as proper nouns. You wouldn’t lowercase Sting, would you? #APStyleChat
We generally use nicknames that are widely known to our audience. For AP, that means national and international, not just fans of that team. Local outlets might make a different call. #APStyleChat https://t.co/OWxMEtTbVM
In that instance, it would sound better to say a Heat player or a Jazz team member, for example.  #APStyleChat https://t.co/vkDHzAdIFZ
Those things that cheerleaders hold are pompoms, not pom-poms or pompons. Yes, we have a style for that and it’s evolved over the years. #APStyleChat https://t.co/nU7UhxYNEr
You could say either. A Green Bay Packer, singular, is acceptable, or a Packers player or team member. #APStyleChat https://t.co/aWl7JUddd0
When referring to teams, schools and cities use singular verbs and pronouns: “Los Angeles is...” Team names take plural verbs: “The Rams are...” Team names with no plural forms still take plural verbs: “The Cardinal are...” “The Crimson Tide are...” #APStyleChat https://t.co/e2rv5VuomP
We hyphenate play-caller and nickel back is two words. 	One of our writers likes to joke that Nickelback, one word, is just a band. #APStyleChat https://t.co/l2JbB4d5to
How do you think it looks?	We prefer to use the full name of the conference instead. It's very rare to use B1G, except when quoting written material or as a literary device. And we try to be more clever than that.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/UDkPq0WBtB
Avoid football cliches! A team losing a game isn't a "disaster." Or, if it scores two touchdowns and the opponent doesn't come back, say it "never trailed" rather than "never looked back." Skip hackneyed words and phrases, redundancies and exaggerations. #APStyleChat
We would say passes defended or defended passes. #APStyleChat https://t.co/kvOEkG6WOT
We would write home opener, no hyphen, not capitalized. #APStyleChat https://t.co/eNMewERUu7

Just like a healthy marriage, AP style calls for clear communication. 	We also believe in the value of compromise. So as a reminder, the Stylebook doesn't prohibit all Oxford commas. If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma. https://t.co/vGsuRrwpQW
Our style is "underway." One word in all uses. We changed from two words in 2013.

Our style: Harry S. Truman. He once said there was no need for the period because the S did not stand for a name. Asked in the early 1960s about his preference, he replied, "It makes no difference to me." AP style has called for the period since then.

Raising money by soliciting relatively small individual contributions from a large number of people is called crowdfunding, one word, no hyphen.	It’s one of the new entries in the 2018 AP Stylebook. https://t.co/YLECyzXsoS
To jury-rig is to set up something for temporary or emergency use: a courtroom jury-rigged in a corner of the factory. It's sometimes confused with jerry-built, which means to be made poorly, or of cheap materials: Flimsy houses were jerry-built on the hillside.
MRI is acceptable in all references for magnetic resonance imaging, a noninvasive diagnostic procedure used to render images of the inside of an object. It is primarily used in medical imaging to demonstrate pathological or other physiological alterations of living tissues.

Avoid using "last" as a synonym for "latest" if it might imply finality. "The last announcement was made at noon" may leave the reader wondering whether the announcement was the final announcement, or whether others are to follow.
@dfallik We offer desk copies to instructors who require the AP Stylebook. You can find more information here: https://t.co/mgveRUCcBJ

The term "scuba" (lowercased) is an acronym for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus." Lowercased "laser" is an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." @HeatherJeanHowe
The K abbreviation is acceptable in headline and statistical references to kilometers, such as a 10K race; in baseball for strikeouts: pitcher records 12 K's; and monetary amounts in thousands: Employee earns $80K. It is acceptable in sports stories: She won her first 5K.
@THEJordonBrown The rules have changed since that answer 11 years ago. See today's tip.
Always use figures for ages. The girl is 15 years old; the law is 8 years old; the 101-year-old house. When the context does not require years or years old, the figure is presumed to be years.
Use emoji both as the singular and plural form to describe symbols used in texts and social media posts.	The 2018 AP Stylebook provides guidance for quotes with emoji. https://t.co/AlRqeBUk5U
Commonwealth of Independent States was founded Dec. 8, 1991, made up of 11 of the former republics of the USSR, or Soviet Union. 	Russia is the largest and richest. 	Three other former republics – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia – became independent nations earlier in 1991.
Yes, we updated our guidance this year to use chile or chiles to describe spicy peppers or the sauces or gravies derived from them. The meat- and/or bean-based dish is still chili with an i. https://t.co/C4pi31j78e

NATO is acceptable in all references for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The plural of amaro, the bitter after-dinner drink, is amari. https://t.co/LprSrGoBQK

Thanks for traveling with us today. Bon voyage! Happy trails.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/OCX2VaL5PX
In other uses, TSA should be used only on second reference. #APStyleChat

Amtrak is an acronym, drawn from the words American travel by track. It may be used in all references to the National Railroad Passenger Corp. Do not use AMTRAK. #APStyleChat
Capitalize airlines and airways when used in a proper airline name.	Companies that use Airlines in the title include American, Hawaiian, Japan, Southwest and United. Companies that use Airways include British, JetBlue and Qantas. Delta uses Air Lines.	#APStyleChat
A boat is a watercraft of any size but generally is used to indicate a small craft. A ship is a large, seagoing vessel. The word boat is used, however, in some words that apply to large craft: ferryboat, PT boat. #APStyleChat https://t.co/Zs0lNVoC92
UNESCO and AAA are acceptable in all references and should not be spelled out. AP style on UNESCO-designated landmarks is World Heritage site and World Heritage list. #APStyleChat
These activities are all one word, no hyphen: snowboard, surfboard, skateboard, paddleboard. But stand-up paddleboard does have a hyphen. 	Here are a few more fun ones: mountain bike, Segway, Rollerblade but roller coaster (two words). #APStyleChat
Directions are not capitalized but regions are. She drove south. She’s from the South. #APStyleChat
Brand names, of course, are capitalized, as in Black Fox sauvignon blanc.  #APStyleChat
Writing or editing a travel story about a winery or wine-tasting tour? Wines and grape varieties are not usually capitalized except when they are named for a region. So, Champagne is capitalized (after the region of France) but prosecco, merlot and riesling are not. #APStyleChat
For example, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem is an attraction at Universal Orlando Resort inspired by the "Despicable Me" movies. The Country Music Hall of Fame just opened an exhibit called “Outlaws &amp; Armadillos: Country’s Roaring ’70s." #APStyleChat
Names of museums, theme parks, theme park ride names and attractions are never put in quotes, but names of movies, shows and exhibits are. "#APStyleChat

Use numerals in all descriptions of distances and dimensions, as in 8 miles away, 4 feet high, 6 mph. #APStyleChat
If you fly a lot, you are a frequent flyer (not flier). This style rule changed in 2017.	Use flier in the phrase take a flier, meaning to take a big risk. #APStyleChat
Luggage that you don't check is carry-on (hyphenated). #APStyleChat
TripAdvisor is one word, ending in OR, but AP style on the noun adviser is ER. #APStyleChat
Zipcar and similar companies are short-term car rental services. #APStyleChat
Ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft let people use smartphone apps to book and pay for a car service or, in some cases, a taxi. They may also be called ride-booking services. Ride-sharing refers to app-based services that let people book a shared shuttle. #APStyleChat
Don't forget to capitalize the U in Uber! #APStyleChat
Theater ends in ER, not RE, unless a theater spells its proper name with an RE: The Oscars take place in a theater called the Dolby Theatre. #APStyleChat
Either way is fine.	We note you correctly styled round-trip airfare with the hyphen, because it's a compound modifier, and five is spelled out.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/BEsG0VitUm
It's Cinderella Castle (not Cinderella’s). Walt Disney World is in Florida, while Disneyland is in California. #APStyleChat
Sites such as Airbnb, VRBO and HomeAway that connect people offering residences or rooms with others who want to rent them for short-term stays are vacation rental websites. Do not call them home-sharing sites or room-sharing sites. #APStyleChat
Airbnb is one word, bnb all lowercase. When referring generally to bed-and-breakfast accommodations, B&amp;B is acceptable on second reference. #APStyleChat
It's accommodations, not accomodations (two Ms). #APStyleChat	Beth Harpaz calls this the No. 1 most misspelled word in travel content.
Note capitalization guidance on sites administered by the National Park Service: the National Register of Historic Places, National Heritage Areas, National Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Historic Landmarks and National Trails. #APStyleChat
It's the National Park Service, not Parks (no S!), and on second reference, park service. #APStyleChat

Always lowercase the term "grand jury." Examples: a Los Angeles County grand jury, the grand jury. This style has been adopted because a jurisdiction frequently has more than one grand jury session.
CONTEXT: Remember that you can misquote someone by giving a startling remark without its modifying passage or qualifiers. The manner of delivery sometimes is part of the context. Reporting a smile or a gesture may be as important as conveying the words themselves.

Semiannual means twice a year. It's a synonym for biannual. Don't confuse it with biennial, which means every two years.
Both a grape and a red wine, shiraz is known as syrah in France.	#wine #redwine #shiraz #syrah #APstyle https://t.co/77qjHDMH7i
The approaching holiday is Fourth of July or July Fourth, also Independence Day. 	Capitalize Declaration of Independence, but lowercase the declaration whenever it stands alone. 	Use periods in the abbreviation U.S. for United States. In headlines, it's US (no periods).
The Western Wall is the last remaining part of the second Biblical temple and the holiest site where Jews can pray. It is located on the edge of the site known as the Temple on the Mount to Jews and Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) to Muslims.	#WesternWall #WailingWall https://t.co/4aqJua5D94

Thanks for joining us today!	We have additional guidance in the 2018 Stylebook's expanded marijuana, medical marijuana entry. 	#APStyleChat
Thanks for the suggestion. We will take a look at budtender or bud-tender or bud tender for a future entry. #APStyleChat https://t.co/mgR4RAUWSm
Sometimes “broad legalization” can be used, with explanation, to describe jurisdictions that have approved marijuana cultivation, sales and consumption for both medical and recreational use. #APStyleChat https://t.co/YdyGxIuFIR
There is no one official term. Generally, we use store, retail outlet and dispensary in AP stories. We don't use "provisioning center." #APStyleChat https://t.co/3Cw2eqEsC0
Medical or medicinal? “Medical” refers to the practice of medicine, and “medicinal” refers to the treatment of disease pain. The distinction is likely lost on readers. Medical is fine, but medicinal is not incorrect. #APStyleChat
Yes, it can include the leaves, but when we're writing about marijuana, we are usually referring to the flowers, which is why another nickname is bud. #APStyleChat https://t.co/PsNBVnSbcN
Hemp, with some exceptions, such as hemp oil, generally refers to the fibers of the plant, used in making rope, clothing, paper and other products. #APStyleChat
If it requires clarity, make sure the story explains the jurisdiction. Even in California, where voters legalized marijuana, some local governments prohibit it. Federal, state, county and city laws can differ.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/lNVAq3tbGk
Do not refer to synthetic marijuana/cannabis/pot as “synthetic THC,” since it generally contains other chemicals and could be confused with pharmaceuticals containing that compound. #APStyleChat
We are constantly making updates and this is something we can consider. #APStyleChat https://t.co/3zNHzqoUtl
“Synthetic cannabinoids” is a scientific, awkward term that may require too much explanation for general news stories, such as crime briefs. “Synthetic marijuana” etc. gets the point across, just as “soy milk” does even though it doesn’t contain actual milk. (9/9) #APStyleChat
Some drugs such as Spice and K2 contain cannabis compounds that are made in labs. Call them “synthetic” or “imitation marijuana/cannabis/pot.” “Synthetic cannabinoids” is acceptable with explanation when necessary, such as in scientific contexts. (8/9) #APStyleChat
Legalization means making the sale, possession and use of cannabis legal for adults with some restrictions. Decriminalization generally means lowering penalties so possession is more like a speeding ticket.  (7/9) #APStyleChat
Several states allow naturopathic physicians to authorize medical marijuana. Check the “doctor” entry before using “Dr.” The title is reserved for those who hold specific degrees. Naturopathic physicians are not on the list. (6/9) #APStyleChat
Some of the plant’s compounds are found in legal pharmaceuticals or supplements in places that have not legalized medical or recreational marijuana, but they still may fall under the umbrella of medical marijuana. (5/9) #APStyleChat
One popular form of hemp oil is rich in cannabidiol and is often shortened to CBD oil; both terms and the full names of other similar compounds are best confined to quotations or product names unless you need to be specific. 	#APStyleChat https://t.co/mqiKaoZ36s
When cannabis is used for medical purposes, it is generally known as medical marijuana. The term usually refers to the dried flowers that are smoked, vaporized or incorporated into food known as edibles. (4/9) #APStyleChat
The plant contains chemical compounds known as cannabinoids. Refer to them as compounds, chemicals or derivatives if needed. The main psychoactive compound is tetrahydrocannabinol; THC is fine on first reference. (3/9) #APStyleChat
Some governments and other entities prefer “cannabis” because of arguments that the term marijuana was popularized in the United States in the early 20th century to stoke anti-Mexican sentiment. (2/9) #APStyleChat
Also, 420 is acceptable in some limited cases as code for marijuana use or for the celebration of marijuana use on April 20. #APStyleChat
Marijuana is the dried flower of the cannabis plant. “Cannabis” is the usual term outside North America; it and “pot” are also acceptable. Slang terms such as weed, reefer and ganja are acceptable in limited, colloquial cases or in quotations. (1/9) #APStyleChat

RT @AP: An earlier AP story on Anthony Bourdain’s suicide mentioned details about his death that were not in keeping with AP style. We have…
Avoid using the phrase "committed suicide" except in direct quotations	from authorities. Alternate phrases include "killed himself," "took her own life"	or "died by suicide." The verb "commit" with "suicide" can imply a criminal act. (3/3)
Suicide stories, when written, should not go into detail on	methods used. (2/3)
Generally, AP does not cover suicides or suicide attempts, unless the person involved is a well-known figure or the circumstances are particularly unusual or publicly disruptive. (1/3)

We changed our style to breastfeed, breastfeeding, breastfed earlier this year. That new style, eliminating the hyphen, now appears in the 2018 AP Stylebook. https://t.co/j10NvAnhBo
@billiams Yes. But in this particular case, the reference is specifically to the noodles. If there's a need to distinguish between the noodles and the dish, spell it out.
Do you prefer soba (thin noodles made from buckwheat flour or buckwheat and wheat flours), udon (thick noodles made from wheat flour) or ramen (another variety of noodles made from wheat flour)? To avoid redundancy, don’t say say soba noodles, udon noodles or ramen noodles.
@jolinegkg Thanks for the catch! We have made the correction on Stylebook Online.	It's no surprise a New Mexican would know the difference between chili and chile.	Can we offer you a Stylebook Online subscription as thanks for helping us get it right?
When a phrase refers to a month and day within the current year, do not include the year: The hearing is scheduled for June 26. If the reference is to a past or future year, include the year and set it off with commas: Feb. 14, 2025, is the target date.
The White House says President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un is set for 9 a.m. on June 12 in Singapore, which is 9 p.m. on June 11 on the U.S. East Coast. We've prepared a Stylebook Topical Guide for help in coverage: https://t.co/NKPzZTlm4v

Be specific if there is room for confusion: The ceremony honored people wounded in the mass shooting. The play told the story of those killed in the hurricane. (4/4) #APStyleChat
Likewise, “victim” can create confusion because it can variously mean someone killed, injured or subjected to mistreatment such as sexual misconduct. (3/4) #APStyleChat
“Survivor” can denote someone who has lived through an injury or disease, but also can apply to someone who endured a threat but escaped injury altogether. Example: a mass shooting survivor. (2/4) #APStyleChat
Use the terms "survivor" and "victim" with care because they can be imprecise and politically and legally fraught. (1/4) #APStyleChat
Revised section of the numerals entry: A numeral-and-letter combination may start a sentence: “3D movies are drawing more fans.” That joins starting a sentence with the year as the only times when a numeral is OK at the beginning of a sentence. #APStyleChat
The Knights of the Round Table will hold a roundtable discussion after seating themselves at a round table. They likely will refer to their meeting as a roundtable. #APStyleChat
Major storm names provided by government weather agencies, the European Union or the World Meteorological Organization are acceptable. Don’t use names created by private weather agencies or other organizations. #APStyleChat
“3D” now has no hyphen. Same with “2D.” Both are acceptable on all references. #APStyleChat
We've changed our style to one word for “homepage.” We added “smartwatch” and “timeshare” as one word. But: “health care.” #APStyleChat
If in doubt, err on the side of including party affiliation. (4/4) #APStyleChat
No political party needed here: "Gov. Phil Murphy says the crash of a dump truck and a school bus has killed a student and a teacher." And the party affiliation should be deleted here: "The Democratic governor went to the school and says his heart is broken." (3/4) #APStyleChat
But reference to party affiliation is not necessary when a story has no link to politics. (2/4) #APStyleChat
A political figure’s party affiliation is often relevant, but not always. Include party affiliation if a politician’s actions could reasonably be seen as having an effect on policy or debate, or if readers need it for understanding. (1/4) #APStyleChat
Check the new Stylebook for guidance on the terms act, amendment, bill, law, measure, ordinance, resolution, rule, statute. #APStyleChat
A story's context or tone can allow for "unborn baby" or "unborn child" in cases where "fetus" could seem clinical or cold: “She said her love for her unborn baby was the strongest feeling she had ever felt.” (3/3) #APStyleChat
"Fetus," which refers to the stage from the eighth week of pregnancy to birth, is preferred in many cases, including scientific and medical uses: “The virus can be harmful to a fetus.” “The lawsuit alleges harm to a fetus that prosecutors say was viable.”  (2/3) #APStyleChat
With the terms “fetus,” “unborn baby” or “unborn child”: Write clearly and sensitively, using any of the terms when appropriate. (1/3) #APStyleChat
Referring to black males of any age and in any context as “boys” can be perceived as demeaning and call to mind historical language used by some to address black men. Be specific about ages if possible, or refer to “black youths, child, teen” or similar. (2/2) #APStyleChat
While it is always inaccurate to call people under 18 “men” or “women” and people 18 and older “boys” or “girls,” be aware of nuances and unintentional implications. (1/2) #APStyleChat
Our style is "coworking" to mean sharing workspace and amenities when people don’t actually work for the same company but instead are self-employed or remote workers. No hyphen. But: "co-worker" for a colleague within the same company. #APStyleChat
It's now OK to use "today" and "tonight" in uses other than news stories: “We're sharing lots of great tips in our #APStyleChat today.” But use day of the week in news stories.
New or revised food entries also include: ahi, amaro, chorizo, churros, gingersnap, gluten-free, grain bowl, India pale ale, Instant Pot, Kobe beef, locavore, matcha, multicooker, soba, superfoods, udon, vegan, za’atar. #APStyleChat
Also with Thanksgiving in mind: A new entry notes that "dressing" is cooked outside of the bird; "stuffing" is cooked inside. Use of the terms also varies regionally in the U.S., with one preferred over the other in some places regardless of how it’s prepared. #APStyleChat
We have a new entry for "turducken," a deboned chicken stuffed inside a deboned duck stuffed inside a deboned turkey. #APStyleChat
Revised guidance on this spicy topic: It's “chile” and “chiles” for any of a variety of spicy peppers or the sauces or gravies derived from them. The meat- and/or bean-based dish is “chili.” #APStyleChat
Examples: “She has an African-American father and a white mother” instead of “She is biracial.” But: “The study of biracial people showed a split in support along gender lines.” (3/3) #APStyleChat
Avoid “mixed-race,” which can carry negative connotations, unless a story subject prefers the term. Be specific if possible, and then use “biracial” for people of two heritages or “multiracial” for those of two or more on later references if needed. (2/3) #APStyleChat
The terms “biracial” and “multiracial” are acceptable, when clearly relevant, to describe people with more than one racial heritage. Usually the terms are more useful when describing large, diverse groups of people rather than individuals. (1/3) #APStyleChat
Our June #APStyleChat will focus on marijuana and medical marijuana. (3/3)
The entry also adds "synthetic marijuana" or "imitation marijuana" as acceptable terms for drugs like Spice and K2. (2/3) #APStyleChat
A new entry adds more details on marijuana and medical marijuana. Highlights include a history of marijuana as a loaded word, and expanded explanations of terminology for the plant’s derivatives and pharmaceutical uses, such as cannabinoids. (1/3) #APStyleChat
Also, most social networks allow for direct embedding of such material, and screen captures may also be acceptable if images are displayed in accordance with your newsroom’s visual standards.  (7/7) #APStyleChat
Many story platforms support displaying posts as they actually appear, or hyperlinking to posts on social networks, giving journalists several options to let readers see material for themselves. (6/7) #APStyleChat
Don’t use parentheses to describe an emoji within a direct quote, to avoid confusing readers by making it seem as if the person being quoted wrote out the description in text. (5/7)  #APStyleChat
Be aware that some GIFs, emoji or other images may contain hidden meanings and nuances requiring consideration and more than just a simple description of the image posted. (4/7) #APStyleChat
For example: Chavis sparked a flurry of responses against the airline after tweeting a GIF of large crowds at the gate, with the message “#missinghoneymoon” and an emoji string of a worried smiley, a ring, an hourglass and an umbrella on a beach.  (3/7) #APStyleChat
How you quote emoji or GIFs? Treat the visual material in emoji or GIFs as context or gestures when important to include. Describe them by paraphrasing. (2/7) #APStyleChat
We now use “emoji” for the plural, rather than “emojis.” (1/7) #APStyleChat
Welcome to our 2018 AP Stylebook launch day #APStyleChat, with editor @PaulaFroke sharing highlights of what's new in the Stylebook.	All these changes are live on AP Stylebook Online, as well. https://t.co/KHQpF7ILYq
How did we end up with HIPPA instead of HIPAA in our note? We are asking ourselves that, too. When you look too hard and too often at the very thing you're trying to avoid, you tend to crash right into it. The entry itself is correct. Thanks to all who have noted the error.
Instead refer to privacy laws or the federal law restricting release of medical information. If HIPAA is used in a quote, explain it.	And it always pays to proofread everything one more time than you think you need.
One more reason not to use the acronym HIPAA: You might incorrectly call it HIPPA, as we did in our email today announcing the launch of the 2018 Stylebook.	Where possible avoid using the term, an acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
Today we launch the spiral-bound 2018 AP Stylebook, with about 200 new and updated entries and a new chapter on covering polls and surveys.	Order yours: https://t.co/uHdj4GeFkb https://t.co/pjStHqZqjf

AP style is kitty-corner, or diagonal to, which has nothing to do with kittens. The American Heritage Dictionary says the origin is the obsolete cater, four at dice, from Middle English. That in turn is from old French catre, meaning four, and traced to quattuor in Latin.

We fall firmly into the Dr. Seuss camp on that one, @KevinMSquires
Among the many times when AP style calls for comma use: Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.
The word "rarely" means "seldom." The phrase "rarely ever" is redundant, but "rarely if ever" often is the appropriate phrase.
@JohnBisciJr We will release the spiral-bound AP Stylebook May 30. We start taking orders for the new book that day.	Until then, if you order a book on our website, we continue to sell the 2017 AP Stylebook: https://t.co/cfFM83YDPZ
Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will officiate at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. On second reference he can be called Welby, or the archbishop, or the archbishop of Canterbury. For more: https://t.co/r2hpb4AYIg
@Tripp3 Do you think every morning, "I love the AP Stylebook"?
The period and the comma always go within the quotation marks. The dash, the semicolon, the colon, the question mark and the exclamation point go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. They go outside when they apply to the whole sentence.
@JoshFrigerio We don't capitalizer the term "royal wedding." For more on the big event, here's our Topical Guide: https://t.co/V7EsM8pbQp
The words "admits" or "admitted" may in some contexts give the erroneous connotation of wrongdoing. People who say they are recovering from alcoholism, for example, are not admitting it. "Says" or "said" is usually sufficient.
@AMAManual @MerriamWebster That change was made years ago. Our official dictionary, Webster's New World College Dictionary, also uses the one-word form.
Be specific if there’s room for confusion: "The ceremony honored people wounded in the shooting." Or: "The play told the story of those killed in the hurricane," not "The play told stories of the hurricane's victims." (4/4)
Likewise, "victim" can create confusion because it can variously mean someone killed, injured or subjected to mistreatment such as sexual misconduct. (3/4)
"Survivor" can denote someone who has lived through an injury or disease, but also can apply to someone who endured a threat but escaped injury altogether. Example: a mass shooting survivor. (2/4)
Use the terms "survivor" and "victim" with care because they can be imprecise and politically and legally fraught. (1/4)

Lowercase royal wedding and royal couple. They are informal designations that could be applied even when very minor royals get married. 	For more royal guidance, check out our new Topical Guide: https://t.co/M4K5EZvlE3	#royalwedding #harryandmeghan
Avoid the term “progressive,” which can imply improvement, as a political descriptor except in quotes or the names of organizations or political parties.
Use the day of the week, not "today" or "tonight," in news stories. In other writing, "today" and "tonight" are OK if using the day of the week would be awkward. For example, in an internal note today (Friday) to staff: Xin Chen took over as vice president for sales today.
@PDXBIZJournal Lowercase royal wedding, royal couple.
@smwright04 @garykarr That's now outdated. We changed our style last year to livestream, livestreaming in all uses.
AP style, reflecting usage, is: smartphone, smartwatch, smart home, smart car, smart Stylebook editor.
May Day is May 1, often observed as a political or festive holiday.	The compound mayday is the international distress signal, from the French m'aider, meaning "help me." It is lowercase in "mayday call" and capitalized as an exclamation: "Mayday!"

Where possible avoid using the term "HIPAA," which is an acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Instead refer to "privacy laws" or "the federal law restricting release of medical information." If HIPAA is used in a quote, explain it.

Avoid descriptions that connote pity, such as "afflicted with" or "suffers from" multiple sclerosis. Rather, "has multiple sclerosis."
@FastCapital360 Sorry you're having trouble getting your order to go through.	Can you DM us your contact information? We'll have customer service get in touch ASAP so you can get your AP Stylebook products right away.
@eurostep3FG We do use pre-emptive and pre-emptively. You may be looking at the dictionary section of Stylebook Online; Webster's does list those terms without the hyphen. AP style is to use it. Sometimes we differ from the dictionary.
A piece of hyphenation guidance: Use a hyphen to avoid duplicated vowels or tripled consonants. For example: anti-intellectual, pre-empt, shell-like.
The formal name for the royal court of the British sovereign is the Court of St. James’s. https://t.co/OAYQ5sMhlQ
Medevac is acceptable as an abbreviation for medical evacuation, especially in referring to aircraft used to transport wounded military personnel.
Use a semicolon when a coordinating conjunction such as "and," "but" or "for" is not present: The package was due Monday; it arrived Friday.
"Principal" refers to someone or something first in rank, authority, importance or degree. In a business context, principal refers to the amount of money borrowed in a loan, distinct from interest. "Principle" refers to a fundamental truth, law, doctrine or motivating force.
Congratulations to @oskargarcia, a member of the AP Stylebook editing team, who has been promoted to be AP's deputy sports editor for storytelling! We're delighted that he also will continue with his Stylebook work.
Thanks for joining #APStyleChat today.	There's more guidance like this in our new polls and surveys chapter, which launched today in Stylebook Online.
However, only those polls that meet these standards should be included in averages intended for publication, and it is often preferable to include the individual results of multiple recent surveys to show where a race stands.	#APStyleChat
Averaging poll results does not eliminate error or preclude the need to examine the underlying polls and assess their suitability for publication. In campaign polling, survey averages can provide a general sense of the state of a race. 	#APStyleChat
Do not accept assurances from pollsters that “proprietary” sampling and weighting methods that are not made available for review and scrutiny are able to produce representative results.	#APStyleChat
Our new polling entry opens the door to covering some surveys conducted using opt-in online panels. Careful consideration must be given to the techniques used to ensure results are truly representative. Pay attention to the latest research on those kinds of surveys. #APStyleChat https://t.co/PPSo0oHJBK
Margins of sampling error can be reported to the first decimal place. #APStyleChat
Some pollsters release survey results to the first decimal place, which implies a greater degree of precision than is possible from scientific sampling. Poll results should always be rounded to whole numbers. #APStyleChat
Take care when comparing results from different polling organizations, as difference in poll methods and question wording — and not a change in public opinion — may be the cause of differing results. #APStyleChat
That’s not to say horse race polls are verboten. They can and should inform reporting on political campaigns. But while part of the story, they’re never the whole story. 	#APStyleChat
Polls aren’t all politics. But many are. The headline from our new chapter on polls and surveys: “Poll results that seek to preview the outcome of an election must never be the lead, headline or single subject of any story.” 	 #APStyleChat
Agree! Reputable poll sponsors and public opinion researchers will disclose the methodology used to conduct the survey. 	Our new chapter points to @AAPOR‘s transparency initiative as a place to find such pollsters. #aapor	https://t.co/STEZFbuxzy	#APStyleChat https://t.co/ioShG658uY
It’s not new guidance, but we’ve moved up this message: “The mere existence of a poll is not enough to make it news.”	#APStyleChat
2) Come from a source without a stake in the outcome of its results. 	3) Scientifically survey a random sample of a population, in which every member of that population has a known probability of inclusion.	4) Report the results in a timely manner. 	#APStyleChat
When evaluating a poll, AP is looking for four things. To be suitable for publication, a poll must:	1) Disclose the questions asked, the results of the survey and the method in which it was conducted. . 	 #APStyleChat
Our new chapter on polls and surveys opens with this reminder: “Reporting on public opinion research requires rigorous inspection of a poll’s methodology, provenance and results.”	#APStyleChat
When evaluating a poll or survey, be it a campaign poll or a survey on a topic unrelated to politics, the key question to answer is: Are its results likely to accurately reflect the opinion of the group being surveyed?		How do you do that? 	 #APStyleChat
Thanks for joining #APStyleChat. 	We have guest experts @davidthornhill and @EL_Swan here to answer your questions about polls and surveys.	We also launched a new chapter on Stylebook Online, so you can check that for even more guidance.

A relevant weather term for some of us: A flash flood is a sudden, violent flood. It typically occurs after a heavy rain or the melting of a heavy snow.

ISP is acceptable on second reference for internet service provider.
AP style is esports in all references to competitive multiplayer video gaming. Use alternate forms like eSports or e-sports only if part of a formal name. Capitalize at the start of sentences.
Spell out "versus" in most cases: The proposal to revamp Medicare versus proposals to reform Medicare and Medicaid at the same time. In short expressions, however, it's OK to use the short form: The guns vs. butter debate. For court cases: Marbury v. Madison.
Use only the initials AARP for the organization formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons.
It takes a plural verb when a plural word follows an “of” construction: He said 50 percent of the members were there.
The word “percent” takes a singular verb when standing alone or when a singular word follows an “of” construction: The teacher said 60 percent was a failing grade. He said 50 percent of the membership was there.

Some understand the words notorious and notoriety to refer simply to fame; others see them as negative terms, implying being well-known because of evil actions. Be sure the context for these words is clear, or use terms like famous, prominent, infamous, disreputable, etc.

The informal name Quakers may be used in all references to members of the Religious Society of Friends, but always include the full name in a story dealing primarily with Quaker activities.
How not to write: Pivoting from her image as cheerleader touting pricey government entitlements, Mayor Begonia Jargonne voiced profound dismay at plunging revenue enhancements as she pushed back against self-professed economists who fault her policies. https://t.co/FGZ3Age8To
In general, don't describe someone as disabled or handicapped unless it is clearly pertinent to a story. If a description must be used, try to be specific. An ad featuring actor Michael J. Fox swaying noticeably from the effects of Parkinson's disease drew nationwide attention.
@kevinwilson16 @thomas_denome @ToniAnneU Thanks, everyone. Even the AP Stylebook needs a copy editor. 	We will delete the tweet with the typo and try again. https://t.co/GsHNU6iaMK
No hyphen after "after" when it is used to form a noun: aftereffect, afterthought. Make it "after-" with a hyphen when it is used to form a compound modifier:	after-dinner drink, after-theater snack.
Lowercase spring, summer, fall, winter and derivatives such as springtime unless part of a formal name: Dartmouth Winter Carnival, Winter Olympics. To many in the Northeast, the first days of spring are way too much like winter.

Thanks for joining us today! The #APStyleChat markets are closed for the day.
The plural of 401(k) is 401(k) plans. #APStyleChat
An initial public offering occurs when companies allow their shares to be traded on exchanges for the first time. Use IPO on second reference. #APStyleChat
A publicly traded company is one whose stock can be bought and sold on a stock exchange. Investors, meanwhile, can not buy shares of privately held companies on the open market. #APStyleChat
Bonds are essentially loans. Companies and other borrowers sell bonds to raise money. They pay back the borrowings with interest over time, which can range from a few months to decades. Borrowers with worse credit ratings pay higher interest rates. #APStyleChat
Bond prices also move up and down, leading to changes in total return. When interest rates are rising, prices for existing bonds tend to fall because they suddenly look less attractive than newly issued bonds. #APStyleChat
An investment’s total return includes not only however much its price moved but also what it handed out in dividends or interest payments. Apple’s stock rose 46.1 percent last year, but it also paid a dividend of $2.46, so its total return was 48.5 percent. #APStyleChat
@laurawilson1937 Actually, we should have said pullback or drop-off, not correction, since that is a decline of 10 percent or more.	The way you've written the range here is fine.  "... 47 pullbacks, where the index has dropped between 5 percent and 9.9 percent."	#APStyleChat
The Great Recession is the downturn that began in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009 after a real estate bubble popped. It resulted in the worst bear market since the Great Depression, and the S&amp;P 500 fell 56.8 percent.  #APStyleChat
A bubble happens when investors pile in to buy something and push its price far higher than it should be, often on the assumption that someone else will buy it for even more. Past bubbles include Japanese stocks during the 1980s and tech stocks around 2000. #APStyleChat
No one agrees on what sets a market crash apart from a bear market, but reserve the term for only the most severe downturns, such as the crash of 1929 before the Great Depression. #APStyleChat
A bull market happens when stocks climb at least 20 percent from a low. The current bull market began in March 2009, when the S&amp;P 500 hit bottom following the financial crisis. This is the second-longest bull market since World War II. #APStyleChat
A bear market for stocks is one where prices drop at least 20 percent. They can happen quickly, in the span of months, or they can take years. Many professional investors use the S&amp;P 500 as their barometer for when the market has turned from bull to bear. #APStyleChat
We would rewrite the sentence to "...has experienced 47 corrections, where the index has dropped up to 10 percent."	Note that we spell out percent.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/oqoRJ7U7bC
@GregJoslyn A correction in the stock market happens when prices drop 10 percent. They are regular occurrences, even during healthy markets. The last correction occurred in February after the S&amp;P 500 dropped 10.2 percent in nine days. #APStyleChat
Exchange-traded funds differ from mutual funds in that investors can buy and sell them throughout the trading day. Mutual funds set their price at the end of each trading day. Exchange-traded funds can be called ETFs on second reference. #APStyleChat
Index funds have become popular in recent years because they tend to charge lower fees than “actively managed” funds, which try to pick which investments will beat the rest of the market. Both traditional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds can be index funds. #APStyleChat
We say indexes. #APStyleChat https://t.co/afPJSDB9wT
Investors can not buy an index directly, but they can buy funds that track indexes. S&amp;P 500 index funds try to give investors the exact return of the index, minus fees, for example. #APStyleChat
Indexes measure groups of stocks or other investments to give a sense of how the broader market is doing. The S&amp;P 500 covers Apple and 499 other behemoth companies, for example. Other indexes cover small U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, the bond market and other niches. #APStyleChat
Stocks are priced in dollars and cents, but indexes are not. 	For example, the S&amp;P 500 moves by 1.50 or 15 points, rather than by $1.50 or $15. #APStyleChat

Served up by the Stylebook's food chapter: icebox pie, whoopie pie, a la mode, meringue. Also: Boston cream pie (not a pie; two layers of spongecake with custard filling, usually dusted with powdered sugar or chocolate glaze). And then there's shepherd's pie.  #Piday2018
Corporations whose stock is publicly traded report revenue and profit or losses every three months during earnings season, which begins roughly two weeks after the end of each quarter. https://t.co/Tvga6iI6f5
Use the generic term naloxone for the opioid-overdose antidote often carried by first responders and caretakers of people with heroin addiction, with explanation if necessary. Not synonymous with Narcan, which is a brand name for a device that delivers naloxone.
Set your clocks Saturday night for daylight saving time. It starts at 2 a.m. Sunday in most of the U.S. No time change in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas. Consider installing new smoke detector batteries.
NAACP is acceptable in all references for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
IRS is acceptable in all references for Internal Revenue Service.	https://t.co/HD43SebtW9 https://t.co/CSOOO9NjVx

Capitalize the popular names of monuments and similar public attractions: Lincoln Memorial, Statue of Liberty, Washington Monument, Leaning Tower of Pisa, etc.
Will you be watching the Academy Awards on Sunday? (A bonus tip is tucked into that question.) They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. They also are known as the Oscars. Lowercase "the academy" and "the awards" when they stand alone.
For @TeriKWeaver and others writing about (or partaking in) this Lenten tradition: The plural of fish fry is fish fries.
AP Stylebook editors have made hundreds of changes in recent years. Some are high profile, many are not.	Are you using the latest AP style guidance?	https://t.co/YUJpmWeDb0 https://t.co/fKqFeiRXUW
Some common phrases and their punctuation: a day's pay, two weeks' vacation, three days' work, your money's worth. Frequently, however, a hyphenated form is clearer: a two-week vacation, a three-day job.
Use a personal pronoun for an animal only when its sex has been established or the animal has a name. 	Follow the spelling and capitalization of breed names in Webster's New World College Dictionary, our primary dictionary. https://t.co/TJO4Mwr1FV
From our food guidelines: A Negroni is a cocktail of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth. The next entry describes Neufchatel cheese: a soft cow's milk cheese, similar to cream cheese. We make no recommendations on whether they should be paired.
The term Eskimo was assigned by non-native people and in some cultures has taken on offensive connotations. In Canada, the term Inuit is used. Thanks to @GrammarGirl for prompting our revised guidance. (2/2)
In general, avoid the term Eskimo for the native peoples of northern North America except when paired with a group’s ethnic name in Alaska: Inupiat Eskimos, a Yup'ik Eskimo community, a Cu'pik Eskimo, etc. Follow a person's preference. (1/2)
AP Stylebook editors have added several new chapters in recent years, including food, fashion, religion, social media and data journalism.	Are you keeping up with the latest AP style guidance?	https://t.co/dHhZ9HAWXf https://t.co/rz6qfLT3qo
UI is acceptable on second reference for user interface, the features of a device, program or website that enable control by a user. https://t.co/ZEnKkoAFvy
Thanks for joining #APStyleChat! 	If you have additional questions, check out our data journalism chapter. Stylebook Online subscribers can submit questions to Ask the Editor, as well.
Maps are useful visualizations for an analysis in which geography is critical. If geography is not central to the story, consider alternative ways to present the information.	#APStyleChat
Always ask “compared to what.”	A number alone does not signify much. It must be compared against something (a previous year’s figure, measures from other places, a benchmark or goal, etc.).	#APStyleChat
Our polls and surveys section has advice that holds up for any time you're working with sample data. Every story based on a poll should include sample size and a description of methodology.	Details help readers evaluate validity and significance.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/ZtqABlNfl6
First, more stats.	Some universities are beginning to offer data science classes, which are different from computer science classes.	You might also find classes online, like this one: https://t.co/LxhsguQiTG	Quant-heavy public policy courses can be helpful, too.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/rysDhw2hnb

Be mercenary. Start with a question you want to answer, then look for the data and tools to tell that story.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/scL3WSArV2
Good point. 	Going further, as a general rule, all assertions in a story based on data analysis should be reproducible. The methodology description in the story or accompanying materials should provide a road map to replicate the analysis.	#APStyleChat https://t.co/v09oQrTmSv
Look for any anomalies in the data that would invalidate the analysis, such as outliers, blank values, placeholder values or different types of data appearing in the same field.	#APStyleChat
Background your data source: ask when it was collected, by whom and for what purpose.	#APStyleChat
Journalists should evaluate data sources as critically as they would any other source of information.	#APStyleChat
The ability to analyze quantitative information and present conclusions in an engaging and accurate way is no longer the domain of specialists alone.	 #APStyleChat

Capitalize common nouns such as party, river, street and west when they're part of the full name: Democratic Party, Mississippi River, Fleet Street, West Virginia.	Lowercase these common nouns when they stand alone in subsequent references: the party, the river, the street.
Achilles tendon: No apostrophe for the tendon connecting the back of the heel to the calf muscles. But it's Achilles' heel, with an apostrophe, for a vulnerable spot.
Use ages only if relevant. For example, a teenager's comment on video games aimed at that age group, or someone saying, "I'm too old for the job." Generally, use ages for profiles, obituaries, significant career milestones and achievements unusual for the age.
Are you ready for Valentine’s Day? (An AP Stylebook makes a lovely gift, and says to use the apostrophe.)  Wednesday's special day honors a saint martyred in third-century Rome. Sweethearts mark it by exchanging valentines (or style tips).

Pyeongchang, Seoul and all other cities in South Korea are followed by the name of the country when used in datelines: PYEONGCHANG, South Korea. That's also the case in the text of stories IF the dateline isn't in South Korea. More Winter Olympics style: https://t.co/8DPLMUEmuN

One thing to note on the Super Bowl: Refer to it by the year played, not the Roman numeral. We'll refer to this Eagles-Patriots game for years to come as the 2018 Super Bowl. #apstylechat
We go with initials on first reference for schools that are clearly recognizable and won't be confused with other schools. Many times, local coverage strays from our list and that's OK if it works for them. #apstylechat https://t.co/teyVFMOW4Q
Our baseball stories generally use Class A, Double-A and Triple-A. The capitalized terms generally precede the team, city or league name. #apstylechat https://t.co/uK0leBSJbZ
You would use the singular form if you construct the sentence that way, but we would generally rewrite it to avoid that: Eagles quarterback Nick Foles or Villanova guard Jalen Brunson. #apstylechat https://t.co/J2FCRh5655
Thanks! We're also pretty excited. #apstylechat https://t.co/exnxdKmjzQ
It is indeed T-ball, and not just because we graduate to higher levels of play. That's how it's listed in Webster's New World College Dictionary, our official reference for most (but not all) spellings. #apstylechat https://t.co/1kdZvBOVmA
One of the key tidbits in our newly released guide to the Winter Olympics: Pyeongchang has a lowercase "c," not uppercase as organizers are marketing the games. #apstylechat https://t.co/tXA6jRpI5v
We can discuss it -- thanks for the suggestion! #apstylechat https://t.co/5dXxLvBg8s
I've been waiting for this question and love getting it in record time! We use the "s" because you're pluralizing the abbreviation, not the words spelled out. Do you say "a RBI?" No, it's "an RBI." Same concept. https://t.co/o3FqrrRo4o
We generally use 4x400-meter relay. #apstylechat https://t.co/zTm4XK0G5V
We like to have fun sometimes, too, so go ahead and say champs on second reference if you want -- or first as a literary device! #apstylechat https://t.co/3bqCVTAN9i

Capitalize words denoting family relationships only when they substitute for a person's name: I wrote Mom a letter. I wrote my father a letter.
@4ndyman @GramrgednAngel @LunaAmatista That's right: When you need to use shorthand, such as in a headline, for the specific list of behaviors, use "sexual misconduct." In stories, use more words to spell out the specifics.
As with all accusations, these allegations should be well-documented and corroborated in some way, including an effort to get comment from the accused or their representatives. Granting anonymity to accusers should follow AP’s guidelines on the use of anonymity. (3/3)
If a shorter term is needed, such as in a headline, AP now uses the general description "sexual misconduct," rather than "sexual harassment," because it encompasses a broader range of sexual misbehavior and doesn't run the risk of diminishing some of the alleged acts. (2/3)
"Sexual harassment" and "sexual misconduct" are broad terms that can cover a wide variety of actions or behavior. In stories, be as specific as possible in describing the kinds of behavior that is being alleged or admitted. (1/3)
@JeriDansky Thanks for your question, which pointed out that our gift option for digital services doesn't seem to be working. We are working on fixing that online but meantime, you can contact our help center to place your order: help@apstylebook.com or 800-353-6798.

Use an apostrophe for the omitted figures in the year, but no apostrophe for the plural of numerals. So: '70s.  #APStyleChat https://t.co/7ZWqot1NQM
It's each other's. #APStyleChat https://t.co/j8XN45kWOV
We are answering Neil Enns' question.	Use only an apostrophe for singular proper names ending in s: Achilles' heel. Dickens' novels. https://t.co/lMbiP1CRys
However, the apostrophe is used for the plurals of single letters: p’s and q’s; Oakland A’s. #APStyleChat
Indeed. Two members of the Baum family are not Baum’s. Don’t write Happy Holiday’s from the Newvine’s.  #APStyleChat https://t.co/EBzyefs1yr
A comma follows the year in these constructions:  Feb. 14, 2019, is the target date. #APStyleChat
We don’t have a time, date, place style, but that order is widely used. Yes, the order would still apply for two details. #APStyleChat https://t.co/5NjBhwuRSO

CTE is a degenerative brain disease that has been detected after death in more than 200 men and boys who played football. (2/2)

Keep your punctuation questions comma-ing using hashtag #APStyleChat. We'll answer more in a second Twitter chat Sept. 25, 2:30 p.m. EDT.
Thanks for joining #APStyleChat today. Our next chat will focus on gender terms,	Oct. 10, 2:30 p.m. EDT.
Many combinations that are hyphenated before a noun are not hyphenated when they occur after a noun: She works full time. #APStyleChat (4/4)
For example: small-business owner, but vacation rental website. #APStyleChat  (3/4)
In general: the fewer hyphens the better. Use hyphens only when not using them causes confusion. #APStyleChat (2/4)
Use of the hyphen is far from standardized. It is optional in most cases, a matter of taste, judgment and style sense. #APStyleChat (1/4)
Right: He said he was horrified at their "slovenly manners." Better when practical: Use the full quote. #APStyleChat (3/3)
The speaker said, "I am horrified at your slovenly manners." Wrong: He said he "was horrified at their slovenly manners." #APStyleChat (2/3)
When using a partial quote, don't put quotation marks around words that the speaker could not have used. #APStyleChat (1/3)
The temptation to use parentheses may signal that a sentence is becoming contorted. Consider writing it another way.  #APStyleChat (3/3)
Not: My cat (Sebastian) brought me a mouse. Instead: My cat, Sebastian, brought me a mouse. #APStyleChat (2/3)
Parentheses are jarring to readers, so use them sparingly. A set of commas or dashes usually is better.  #APStyleChat (1/3)
Use periods, not semicolons, at the end of each section even if it's a phrase rather than a sentence. #APStyleChat (3/3)
Capitalize the first word following the dash or bullet. #APStyleChat (2/3)
AP uses dashes instead of bullets in lists, but feel free to use bullets if that is your style. #APStyleChat (1/3)
Non-essential phrases go in commas. So if it's a side thought, set it off in commas. Your first example is correct. #APStyleChat https://t.co/4UBpMoLe9F
Semicolons and colons have entirely different uses, even though their names sound similar. #APStyleChat (3/3)
The colon often can be effective in giving emphasis. He had only one hobby: eating.  #APStyleChat (2/3)
The most frequent use of a colon is at the end of a sentence to introduce lists, tabulations, texts, etc. #APStyleChat (1/3)
Semicolons also can link independent clauses in place of a coordinating conjunction: I asked him to marry me; he said no. #APStyleChat (3/3)
Also: Use semicolons when individual segments in the series have material that also must be set off by commas. #APStylechat (2/3)
The semicolon conveys more separation of thought and information than a comma conveys, but less than a period conveys. #APStyleChat (1/3) https://t.co/PtqagF1JJk
CEO Mike Jeffries is here. The CEO, Mike Jeffries, is here. #APStyleChat https://t.co/b4xlBatxIX
Other punctuation goes within the quotation marks when it applies only to the quoted matter. "Can we go?" she asked. #APStyleChat (6/6)
For example: What do you think of the phrase "went viral"? Don't say "went missing"! #APStyleChat (5/6)
Punctuation other than the period or comma goes outside the quotation marks when it applies to the whole sentence. #APStyleChat (4/6)
For other punctuation, it depends on how it’s being used in the sentence. #APStyleChat (3/6)
The period and the comma always go within the quotation marks. #APStyleChat (2/6)
Where does the punctuation go in a sentence with a phrase in quotes? #APStyleChat (1/6) https://t.co/TeRagEZ3ee
No comma needed. If you want to put particular emphasis on the word today, you can use the comma. #APStyleChat https://t.co/FHwDT8dXA1
We may develop more detailed guidance in the future. We welcome any suggestions and specific questions. #APStyleChat (4/4)
We use hyphens and dashes in the ways that hyphens and em dashes generally are used. #APStyleChat (3/4)
We don't use en dashes. For ranges and other traditional uses of en dashes, we use hyphens: Jan. 6-7. #APStyleChat (2/4)
We don't have a detailed style on en and em dashes because they're not used by many of our traditional customers. #APStyleChat (1/4) https://t.co/Pqaup6LQlQ
For example: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast. #APStyleChat (4/4)
Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction. #APStyleChat (3/4)
But: If a comma doesn't help make clear what is being said, don't use it. "The flag is red, white and blue" is clear. #APStyleChat (2/4)
We don't ban Oxford commas! We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma. #APStyleChat (1/4) https://t.co/Oarc4YPgqt
If a sentence is cluttered with punctuation, consider breaking it into two (or more) sentences. Usually that's clearer. #APStyleChat (3/3)
If punctuation does not help make clear what is being said, it should not be there. #APStyleChat (2/3)
Punctuation is to make clear the thought that you're expressing. Keep the reader in mind. #APStyleChat (1/3)

No hyphens when used as a modifier: a magnitude 6.7 quake, a 6.7 magnitude quake. (2/2)
Earthquakes: Magnitudes are usually reported as, for example, magnitude 6.7 or 6.7 magnitude. Either is fine.  (1/2)
@aharonson28 Yes, capitalize Hurricanes before multiples: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Katia.
@sdkstl Here's the right link for our hurricanes style guide: https://t.co/rdOCsUK5LX

@sdkstl There appears to be a technical issue. Hang tight and we'll post a new link.

For St. Barts, use Saint Barthelemy only if needed in quotes, and explain that it is the French name. (4/4)
If needed, explain in copy: The island known as St. Martin in English is divided between French Saint-Martin and Dutch Sint Maarten. (3/4)
In some uses, if referring to the French half of St. Martin it can be Saint-Martin, and to the Dutch side it can be St. Maarten. (2/4)
For #HurricaneIrma coverage: In general, use the English spellings for the Caribbean islands St. Barts and St. Martin. (1/4)
Thanks for noting that, @katharinelackey. We're clarifying for our staff and all. Update coming shortly re St. Martin and St. Barts style.
Example: They are often referred to as “Dreamers,” based on the never-passed DREAM Act that would have provided similar protections. (4/4)
Use “Dreamer” to describe DACA recipients only in direct quotes or with quote marks for the purpose of explaining the term. (3/4)
We are expanding our guidance on the term "Dreamer," since it is often used by others. (2/4)
Use the acronym DACA sparingly and only on second reference for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. (1/4)
Don't use DREAMer or Dreamer to describe DACA recipients. The DREAM Act was a federal proposal similar to DACA that was never approved.
Correction: It's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Our 2017 entry incorrectly says Child Arrivals. We'll fix it online today.
Meaning "Feast of Sacrifice," it marks the willingness of the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham to Christians and Jews) to sacrifice his son (2/2)

@mattriva Thanks very much. That indeed should be Greg Abbott. We'll fix.
Hurricane Harvey: We've put together an AP style guide to common terms related to the storm and its aftermath: https://t.co/Wefrfyem3f
In broad references to a hurricane and its aftermath: The damage from Hurricane Harvey is huge or the damage from Harvey is huge. (3/3)
Phrasing such as “storm Harvey” or “the remnants of Hurricane Harvey” is also acceptable on first reference, with background later. (2/3)
It's OK to call the storm “Harvey” on first reference, if the context is clear. Then, high in the story, give the storm’s history.  (1/3)
Capitalize "hurricane" when part of the name that weather forecasters assign: Hurricane Harvey. For pronouns, use "it" and "its."
AARP: Use in all references for the organization formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons.
Schoolboy, schoolgirl and schoolwork: one word for each. School year, school day: two words. Back-to-school tips: https://t.co/zRUWfeYz0M
PB&amp;J is acceptable in all references to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Capitalize "war" as part of the name of a specific conflict. Examples: the Afghanistan War, the Iraq War, the Civil War, the Cold War.
He called his closest advisers, Schneider, and Torres. (If he called advisers plus Schneider and Torres, use the final comma.) (3/3)
He called his closest advisers, Schneider and Torres. (If Schneider and Torres are his closest advisers, don’t use the final comma.) (2/3)
A reminder about part of our comma guidance: Include a final comma in a simple series if omitting it could make the meaning unclear. (1/3)

Something cannot be partially demolished or partially destroyed. It is redundant to say totally demolished or totally destroyed.
RT @patbwdet: @APStylebook Or: Don't overuse punctuation. Write short, simple sentences.
If a sentence becomes cluttered with commas, semicolons and dashes, start over. Try breaking a complex sentence into two simpler sentences.

We list several specific drugs in the Stylebook, in our new drugs entry, as well as in the opiate, opioid entry. #APStyleChat https://t.co/V4ZKKOTVus
“Synthetic cannabis” is preferred over “synthetic marijuana,” “cannabinoids” or “fake pot.” #APStyleChat
You can order the 2017 AP Stylebook on our website: https://t.co/8nVd4heB5K #APStyleChat https://t.co/rbNrilyzFp
Use “naloxone” for the opioid-overdose antidote, with explanation if necessary; “Narcan” is a brand name for a device. #APStyleChat
The brand or generic name of a drug can be acceptable depending on context; in some cases, both names are useful. #APStyleChat
Sometimes “powerful prescription painkillers” can work, but “opioid” is better for the overall class of drugs. #APStyleChat
Heroin can be made different ways but is generally considered an opioid, as are some prescription drugs like OxyContin. #APStyleChat
Opiate or opioid? Opiates are derived directly from the poppy plant; opioids are synthetic at least in part. #APStyleChat
“Addiction,” “dependence” are not synonymous; dependence may not involve an addiction, which refers to a disease or disorder. #APStyleChat
Our new guidance reflects behaviors that the latest scientific research shows can result in addictions. #APStyleChat https://t.co/IY74GMlsem
Research doesn't yet bear out that internet gambling specifically can result in a bona fide addiction. #APStyleChat https://t.co/fqO7ALhwpk
@OD_Potts For something that doesn't meet the clinical definition of addiction, you might call it a compulsion or compulsive behavior. #APStyleChat
Avoid “alcoholic,” “addict” and “user.” Use phrasing like “he was addicted,” “people with alcoholism” or “she used heroin.” #APStyleChat
Avoid “abuse” or “problem” in favor of “use” with a modifier such as “risky,” “unhealthy” or “heavy,” or the term “misuse.” #APStyleChat
“Addiction” should not be used with other compulsive behaviors such as eating, internet gambling, sex and shopping. #APStyleChat
The term “addiction” is used to refer to diseases or disorders with drugs, alcohol, tobacco and gambling. #APStyleChat
The 2017 AP Stylebook includes new guidance on addiction and drug terms. @JeffMcMillanPA is joining #APStyleChat to share some highlights.

Correct, @oxwof. No caps on `industrial average' in Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow Jones industrial average comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks. Use the full name on first reference; the Dow is OK on second reference.
Use "copyrighted" only as the past tense of the verb: He copyrighted the article. Otherwise it's "copyright" as a noun, verb or adjective.

The shorthand trans is acceptable for transgender on second reference and in headlines. (3/3)
Identify people as transgender only if pertinent. Don't refer to someone as a transgender, or use the term transgendered. (2/3)
The adjective transgender describes people whose biology at birth does not match their gender identity. (1/3)
Maybe ketchup, not catchup or catsup, and mustard, the condiment. (Use dry mustard for the powdered form.) How about Vidalia onions? https://t.co/TY2jp8Pfyz

Thanks for joining #APStyleChat today. Our next chat will focus on language about addiction, Aug. 8 at 2:30 p.m. EDT.
If a statement can’t be confirmed, or can’t be immediately confirmed, say so. #APStyleChat
Words can be true, false, exaggerated, a stretch, a selective use of data, partly or mostly true, etc. (5/5) #APStyleChat
Fact checks need not show statements to be clearly correct or clearly incorrect. (4/5) #APStyleChat
Stick to checking facts, rather than opinion. (3/5) #APStyleChat
Follow with the facts, backed by appropriate citations and attribution. (2/5) #APStyleChat
Present the assertion, using the exact quote or quotes. Quickly state what’s wrong with it or what is correct. (1/5) #APStyleChat
Often you also need a separate fact check piece with more reporting to explore disputed points or questions more fully. (2/2) #APStyleChat
Basic fact-checking should be part of the main story, including pointing out when an assertion differs with known facts. (1/2) #APStyleChat
At @AP, we regularly do Fact Checks on the statements of politicians and others. Here's the latest: https://t.co/UmaEIVgC7O	 #APStyleChat
Some alternatives: false reports, erroneous reports, unverified reports, questionable reports, disputed reports. (4/4) #APStyleChat
If fake news is used in a quote, push for specifics about what is meant. Then choose precise wording to convey that. (3/4) #APStyleChat
But don't label as fake news specific or individual news items that are disputed. Describe the dispute specifically. (2/4) #APStyleChat
The term fake news may be used in quotes or as shorthand for deliberate falsehoods or fiction masked as news. (1/4) #APStyleChat
Fact-checking also can debunk fabricated stories or parts of stories done as hoaxes, propaganda, jokes or for other reasons. #APStyleChat
Fact-checking requires reporting or research to verify facts that affirm or disprove a statement, or that show a gray area. #APStyleChat
It's a companion to our statement of news values and principles, followed by AP staff and conveyed in the Stylebook. (2/2) #APStyleChat
Our new fact checks/fake news entry reflects a key mission of the AP and Stylebook: accurate, clear, unbiased reporting. (1/2) #APStyleChat

SUV is acceptable in all references to a sport utility vehicle.
Thanks for joining us today for #APStyleChat. Take two AP style tweets and call us in the morning.
We don't use any of these abbreviations. We would write out the specialty, if it's relevant. #APStyleChat https://t.co/vNuO9hP0a3
It would depend on the specific instance, but we would not use the term care network. We might say hospital system or group. #APStyleChat https://t.co/rL1EC7ZCDG
Doctor of dental surgery, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatric medicine or veterinary medicine. #APStyleChat (2/2)
Use Dr. in first reference as a title before the name of an individual who holds one of the following medical degrees. #APStyleChat (1/2)
That's not a term we would use for a general audience. We would be more specific, such as nurse practitioner. #APStyleChat https://t.co/1MnroYomaV
Use copay or copayment, not co-pay or co-payment. #APStyleChat
Use HIV, not HIV virus. That’s redundant since HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. #APStyleChat

Avoid provider, if possible. Write health insurance company or insurer, for example. Be specific about who provides care. #APStyleChat https://t.co/Xy9kUEOGBf
We prefer the term doctor, though we also use physician for variety in text. We avoid clinician. #APStyleChat https://t.co/YOkEJmK45f
We write OB-GYN in all references for obstetrics and gynecology, a medical specialty. #APStyleChat https://t.co/OHWO8pNB7P
We use health care as two words, like we write day care and child care as two words, no hyphen. #APStyleChat https://t.co/ieMrh6DzzD
We use orthopedic. #APStyleChat https://t.co/gikOQ5ZXky
We typically avoid variations like NICU or PICU. Spell out what they are, unless writing for a specialized audience. #APStyleChat https://t.co/LqVqo2iICU
Most things can be explained in simpler language. It depends on your readers and what they would easily understand. #APStyleChat https://t.co/J7Yv1ABOOa
Similarly, we lowercase emergency room on first reference, and use ER on second reference. #APStyleChat
We would lowercase intensive care unit on first reference, no hyphens. Use the abbreviation ICU sparingly. #APStyleChat https://t.co/V16scO3Xj9
No hyphenation needed for in vitro fertilization. IVF is OK on second reference. #APStyleChat
Capitalize brand-name drugs (Advil) but lowercase generic ones (ibuprofen). #APStyleChat

A8: Our comma entry says, "If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma." #RaganChat
A8: We think that in general, the serial comma is not necessary for clarity, but when it is needed, we use it. #RaganChat
A8: As our product manager @cnewvine and @ChicagoManual's @SubvCopyEd said at a recent Ragan event, we agree clarity is the goal. #RaganChat
A8: We are *not* at war with @ChicagoManual about the Oxford comma, despite what you might have read. 	https://t.co/9Yz4MIOgHD 	#RaganChat
A7: Watch for unnecessary capitalization, abbreviations and acronyms readers won't recognize, and excessive exclamation points. #RaganChat
A7: For years, watch the apostrophe. It's the 1920s or the '80s, not 1920's or 80's.#RaganChat
A7: Format for dates: January 2013, Jan. 2, May 8, no “th,” Don't forget the second comma: "Feb. 14, 2016, was the target date.” #RaganChat
A7: Format for time: 8:30 a.m., 2-5 p.m., noon and midnight are not 12 noon or 12 midnight. #RaganChat
Try making a typo from the Stylebook Twitter account. https://t.co/1PRuzmPs7M
A6: For a laugh or a cry, check out our new entry on the horrors of jargon and cliches. It makes clear why you must avoid them. #RaganChat https://t.co/TtRzcuF6WE
A6: We now use Walmart in writing generally about the company, including stores. Use Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in corporate senses. #RaganChat
A6: We have a new addiction entry and an expanded drugs entry; we recommend checking them if your work covers those topics. #RaganChat
@PRisUs Regardless of the source - a book, a website, a tweet - if you are quoting written words, retain the existing style. #raganchat
A5: Consider a house policy about whether your PR group fixes style and asks the source to review. Be consistent about it. #RaganChat
A5: When quoting written words, retain the style used by the writer; don't alter even if the statement is not in AP style. #RaganChat
Post a photo of that ancient Stylebook on Instagram using #oldAPStylebook and we might replace it with a shiny new subscription. #RaganChat https://t.co/lTEYiWJtTn
A4: Not all people fall under one of two sex or gender categories. Avoid references to both, either or opposite sexes/ genders. #RaganChat
A4: We have a new entry on gender. Gender refers to a person’s social identity while sex refers to biological characteristics. #RaganChat
A4: Again, we recommend rewriting when possible. And this doesn't open the door to: "The company released their earnings." #RaganChat
A4: There's need for a pronoun for people who don't identify as M or F. And "they" with pronouns like "someone" is common. #RaganChat
A4: We'd discussed it for two years as an indefinite pronoun or a gender-neutral pronoun. Now was the time to move forward. #RaganChat
A4: This year we OK'd the singular they when rewriting is overly awkward. But we strongly prefer rewriting if possible. #RaganChat
A3: Technology moves quickly so it's an area where we frequently add and change terms. Now it's email, website, internet. #RaganChat
A3: On virtual reality, we say VR is OK on second reference. But don't use the shorthand AR; it's less familiar to most readers. #RaganChat
A3: For instance: Defacing of a company's website is like vandalism in the physical world, not an attack. #RaganChat
A3: For help in determining whether to call something a cyberattack, consider an action’s equivalent in the physical world. #RaganChat
A3: Avoid using the terms cyberattack or attack when data has merely been stolen or leaked unless the results are catastrophic. #RaganChat
A3: A true cyberattack causes physical damage or significant, wide-ranging disruption. Beware: The term is routinely overused. #RaganChat
A2: Alternative wording: false reports, erroneous reports, unverified reports, questionable reports, disputed reports.  #RaganChat
A2: But don't label as fake news specific items in dispute. If "fake news" is in a quote, push for specifics about what is meant. #RaganChat
A2: The term fake news may be used as shorthand for deliberate falsehoods masked as news circulating on the internet. #RaganChat
A1 There's much more in the data journalism chapter, of course. What's next, #raganchat?
A1: For instance: Consider the source. Is the data from a government agency or an advocacy group? Examine the methodology. #RaganChat
A1: Expect reporters to ask to reproduce the results of your analysis. Where possible, provide the source data for download. #RaganChat
A1: If you are writing about data, you need to communicate clearly what the numbers say and where they came from. #RaganChat
A1: Data can give your story authority, if you're clear about the reliability, currency, scope and bias of the numbers. #RaganChat
A1: Many agencies and businesses cite data. You have to be knowledgeable as a PR pro; it's not just for specialists. #RaganChat
A1: The new data guide helps you analyze quantitative information and present conclusions in an engaging and accurate way.  #RaganChat

When quoting written words, retain the writer's style; do not alter the written words even if they don’t match AP style. #APStyleChat

The word “reform” is not synonymous with change. It generally implies faults or shortcomings in the subject at hand. #APStyleChat

Instead, choose phrasing like "he was addicted," "people with heroin addiction" or "he used drugs." #APStyleChat  (6/8)
Avoid words like "alcoholic," "addict," "user" and "abuser" unless they are in quotations or names of organizations. #APStyleChat (5/8)
Avoid the word "abuse" or "problem." Better: the word "use" with an appropriate modifier such as risky, unhealthy, heavy. #APStyleChat (4/8)
Addiction can cause changes in brain circuits and chemistry that lead to inability to control use, despite consequences. #APStyleChat (3/8)
Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is considered a disease that affects a person’s brain and behavior. #APStyleChat  (2/8)
We have a new entry on addiction, a new entry on opiates and opioids, and updates to the drugs entry. #APStyleChat. Some highlights: (1/8)
When "they" is used in the singular, it takes a plural verb. We don't use other gender-neutral pronouns such as xe or ze. #APStyleChat (2/2)
We allow singular "they" if other wording is overly awkward. But rewording is usually possible and always preferred. #APStyleChat (1/2)
Also include the legal name, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., in reports specific to corporate results or corporate structure. #APStyleChat (2/2)

@_mlockwood @upright @LeslieSlape What we say in the Punctuation overview applies to all that follows, including commas.
@_mlockwood @upright @LeslieSlape Actually, it's our rule. In the intro to the Punctuation section. https://t.co/qUegmnrQ5g
Also: Use a comma at the end of a series if an integral part of the series uses a conjunction: orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs. (3/3)
Most simple series don't need a final comma for clarity. But if a comma is needed to make sure the meaning is clear, use the comma. (2/3)
About commas, our guidance: The basic guideline is to use common sense. Punctuation is to make clear the thought being expressed. (1/3)

We would likely specify hydrogen-powered car, for example. As a general category, we would say alternative-fuel vehicle. #APStyleChat https://t.co/ZjChM1ajWD
That's correct. Most cars with this capability today are partially self-driving or semi-autonomous. #APStyleChat https://t.co/RDxKOcCcku
For a general audience, we would spell out. If your readers would understand the term, you might abbreviate for local style. #APStyleChat https://t.co/nvnRRaCI2K

That wraps up today's #APStyleChat on political polling. Thanks for your interest!
If a pollster or sponsor fails to provide any of that information, we don’t cover the poll. #APStyleChat
Also: How were they contacted? How were they selected to participate? What were the dates? What’s the question wording/order? #APStyleChat
You also need to know: Who was polled (adults, registered voters, likely voters)? How many? #APStyleChat
Among questions to ask in deciding whether to use a poll: Who did it/paid for it? #APStyleChat
Larger sample sizes in polls also provide bigger subgroups, allowing for better analysis. #APStyleChat
The larger a poll's sample size, the more precise its results. Surveys with 500 respondents or more are preferable. #APStyleChat
Leads within the margin of error are “close” or “near-ties,” but not “statistical dead heats.” That’s only true of actual ties. #APStyleChat
For differences equal to the margin of error but not twice as big, it’s OK to say “apparently leading” or “slightly ahead.” #APStyleChat
Margins of error apply to each candidate. One candidate is leading if the difference is at least twice the margin of error. #APStyleChat
Polls tell us only who is leading when the poll is taken, not who will win. Things can change once voters cast their ballots.  #APStyleChat
Phone polls that don’t call cellphones should be avoided. Almost half of American adults do not have a landline!  #APStyleChat
Don’t use decimal places in reporting poll results, which implies more precision than is possible from a sample of Americans. #APStyleChat
To start: Leads and margins of sampling error are measured in percentage points, not percent. “Percent” is always spelled out. #APStyleChat

Thanks so much for joining #APStyleChat on photos today. We will create a record on Storify soon. https://t.co/goPvacIjxY
We don't blur faces. We would rather crop people out or not use the photo. Digitally altering photos harms their integrity. #APStyleChat
Don't break news in a caption. Make sure key information is in the story. #APStyleChat
Read your caption, don't skim it. Verify spellings, dates and other basics. If you find one mistake, there's likely another. #APStyleChat
We usually work from left to right identifying people in a photo, unless there's a logical reason to deviate from that norm. #APStyleChat
If we don't know the original source of a photo, we identify where we got the picture in the caption and the signoff, @eibcb. #APStyleChat
Our caption sign off places the originator of the photo farthest left in attribution. (Jane Smith/Newspaper Name via AP) #APStyleChat
Avoid unnecessary numbers in captions, especially if they could change. Examples are acres burned in a fire or casualties. #APStyleChat
We abbreviate state names in captions for space considerations. We spell out states in stories when mentioning city and state, #APStyleChat.
Captions should be clear, concise and contextual, @akscojo. Who, what, where, when and why is it relevant? #APStyleChat
The first sentence of a caption should be present tense. Following sentences are past tense, @niaz_siasi. #APStyleChat
The right number of photos for a story depends on the format and space considerations, @sarahmatzelle. #APStyleChat
A photo should be visually interesting and move the story forward by conveying information beyond the text, @sarahmatzelle. #APStyleChat
Beware of cut and paste. Captions are not stories. Don't retell the whole story in the caption. #APStyleChat
A caption needs to explain what's in the picture and give context. It should connect the photo to the story. #ApStyleChat
A caption should be concise, informative and readable. The information is more important than wordsmithing. #APStyleChat @DannyGroner
