Northam will not be able to withstand the Trump tweeting/nickname. Democrats should want him gone ASAP.
@TonyFratto Which the statement didn’t address!!
If I’m a Democratic Presidential candidate, I’d want Ralph Northam gone asap. He’s not who I’d want to be seen campaigning in a swing state with in the waning days of the campaign.
As one who has called out my party on race more times than I can count, Northam has got to go. Whichever is him in the picture, that is way too much. And it’s a reminder that while Republicans usually make the bad headlines on race, both parties still have real problems on race.

@juliemason That was cancelled. (And Cantor had an Asia CODEL in 13 that he cancelled.)

@JakeSherman gotcha
@JakeSherman Once successful, it remained a fairly regular issue where all someone had to do was mention they might vote against the rule to cause problems.
@pkcapitol Many Dems are pushing "Unlikable is sexism" to mute any criticism of female candidates, and saying it only magically appeared once Warren was interested in Pres. I'd argue that "you didn't build that" + Indian issue pre-date that, and I'm not seeing same re Kamala or Klobuchar.

No one is making any noise. In 2013, we were doing all kinds of events, etc (call them stunts, if you want, I won't object) to change the narrative, move a news cycle, anything. This is an opportunity for either side to try to define things. I don't get it.

@stumbalinaa @MEPFuller Not about him “losing his job,” but the ramifications and chaos by a call to vacate the chair, successful or unsuccessful. And not one piece I’ve seen identifies who would do better over the past two years.
@MEPFuller I have my criticisms as anyone would. I think he also did the best he could in a very tough situation between President and the GOP conference. Very little of what I’ve seen acknowledges that tough job and its ramifications for vaguely “standing up.”		Happy holidays!
@MEPFuller But, as I said to you, I didn’t plan on reading your piece, which you said was going to be negative, because I had seen enough of those already. Glad you think your piece is fair, though. 		Hope the holidays treat you well.
@MEPFuller I assume the piece was longer than 280 characters - lots of room for specifics - &amp; explain how it doesn’t end with extended fight w Trump, a call to vacate the chair and debilitating battle meaning either a weakened Ryan or new Speaker with less interest in “standing up” to Trump
This was a great interview. Nice job @MargaretHoover! https://t.co/VV0LTLuADP
@MEPFuller Those are all vague platitudes. “Real accountability” and “don’t do his bidding” don’t mean anything specific.		Again, not sure why you think I was talking about you.
@MEPFuller I’ve never had a reporter tell me they thought their piece was unfair. But since you assume I was referring to you, was it pre-baked?		And what exactly does “stand up to Trump” mean? And what are the implications within Congress if he does what you vaguely called on him to do?
@jenniferamorris @TaraDiJulio Obviously, I do not get this reference!
Just saw yet another take down piece by a reporter who said at yesterday’s speech that that’s exactly what he’d write, who bragged on Twitter that he didn’t have to be fair. Piece was name-calling, with 0 ideas on what and how he could be better. A waste of time and digital ink.
I get political reporters love to write a “take down” as much as restaurant critics love a negative review, but not one Paul Ryan piece I’ve seen has said exactly how he could have done what the reporter wants (more of a “just do it” mentality) or who else would have been better.
@TaraDiJulio Just like “this election is the most important in history.”

@posglen @BruceHaynesDC @JessicaTaylor @PoliticsReid @conncarroll At no point have I criticized anyone for being a loyal parent or child. Sheesh, you people! But if you talk, let's say, Notre Dame all day long, over the school you went to, that's weird.
@BruceHaynesDC @JessicaTaylor @PoliticsReid @conncarroll I was at a UNC game last year, ended up talking to a couple at a pre-game event. Both wearing Carolina blue. Asked when they graduate. One went to NC State, the other, I think, Campbell. Huh? (And I concede your last point...)
@conncarroll @PoliticsReid "Notre Dame: first in my heart, last in my diploma, thermometer, and on and on."
@JessicaTaylor @BruceHaynesDC @PoliticsReid @conncarroll It still creates the awkward conversation - you're wearing orange at the game, someone asks when you graduated. "Well...."
@conncarroll @PoliticsReid "Go school I made no attempt to attend!"
@BruceHaynesDC @PoliticsReid @conncarroll School you went to plays the school you didn't go to - who do you cheer for?
@KimberlyEAtkins Hey Kimberley, the conversation was about people who are superfans of one school, despite attending another. Not about the broader socio-economics, tuition increases, etc, surrounding higher education. Just a dumb college football debate. Thanks. Enjoy the day off.
@PoliticsReid @conncarroll No, I'm talking about the people who go crazy for the football team of the state school near where they grew up, but attend a private school across the country, despite no football, and still want to be superfan. I attended a state school, which I still support. Thank you.
@pkcapitol @PoliticsReid @conncarroll By definition, those students are on a full ride. Unless you're talking about Mathletes, which is an entirely different conversation.
@pkcapitol @PoliticsReid @conncarroll Yeah but then the second kid goes to a rival school and the parents wear the awkward half and half shirts. "Tonight we're cheering for Texas AND Oklahoma!" And the announcers then have to talk about it all game.
@PoliticsReid @conncarroll I appreciate the socio-economic point you make. I attended an affordable state school and support that team. You chose an elitist private school, despite their not having football. Hmm...
@PoliticsReid @conncarroll My point is, and remains, that if college football or a particular team is that important to you, having that as a deciding factor is common sense. (And your wife is right!)
@hughhewitt @DR9214N I have a friend who went to Duke undergrad and UNC business school. Just, no.
@conncarroll @PoliticsReid Cheering against Duke is an American birthright.
@conncarroll @PoliticsReid BTW, I'm equally dismissive of the UNC "fans" who didn't attend. One of my best friends growing up refers to UNC as "we." He want to Appalachian State.
@conncarroll I saw that, haven't read it yet. Supposed to be a tough read.
https://t.co/A5pJCU0t3F
@conncarroll I mean, the mascot and team name are obviously problematic. And as a Catholic, there are plenty of other Catholic schools I could pretend I went to - ones that correctly pronounce their name!
@conncarroll Dude, I can't even find the UNC game on tv right now. But maybe Reid Wilson knows!
@conncarroll I don't understand paying to advertise a school with which one has no affiliation. I remember seeing a friend, let's call him Brian, simultaneously wearing shorts, a shirt and a vis of 3 different schools he didn't attend. How hard is it to support your own school?
@conncarroll The Beach Boys sang "Be True to Your School." Seems like a good guideline to follow.
@conncarroll When it gets to the point where people think you went to a school you made zero effort to attend - didn't even think about applying to - the super-fandom and buying all the vests is just weird.
@conncarroll Watch whatever you want, but being superfan of a school you chose not to attend? That's just weird.
@rorycooper @jamesoliphant Meh, all the fans waving things has gotten old. Though the Terrible Towel was the first one.

Now, 2010, that was a wave. No doubt. So much so that the RNC comms staff put up with my loudly singing Frank Sinatra's "Wave" while I had a cigar in my office. https://t.co/wvL12TBjVW

@RaduMarinescu6 Yeah, but he's on the tube all day every day, unlike, say, Nita Lowey. Everyone knows him.

@tracysefl @Amtrak @TheEllenShow For 3 hours yesterday, I had en entire row of adults - both sides of the aisle! - turned around and talking to their friends behind them. Was punishing. How I wish I could have just booked the quiet car. (And there should be 2 quiet cars!)
@ddkochel @briangongol I'll give you Easy Lover though - since that was the theme music for Wrestlemania III.
@ddkochel @briangongol I cannot think of a song from the 80s worse than In the Air Tonight. It made the Miami Vice episode unwatchable. And "great prog rock drummer" doesn't excite everyone.
@tracysefl @Amtrak Also, with assigned seating you could reserve your space in the quiet car, and not hope you get stuck in a Romper Room car. Like I did yesterday.
@ddkochel @briangongol I'd put Phill Collins above Billy Joel but below MacBook Air.

6. This will get a huge media splash. But with voter attitudes firmly established either for or against Trump, will have no more impact than the Omarosa or Wolff books, or the other tipping points that weren't.
5. Of course, the NYT opinion page - which made its culture clear in recent hiring decisions - wants to undercut the President. But, in publishing an anonymous piece, it further erodes confidence/trust in the media.
4. This piece undercuts the President and, like him or not, he has a right to staff that will not actively undermine him. If the staffer feels this strongly, resigning and saying this publicly is the better way to do this.
3. One can agree with much of the op/ed and still be troubled by its publication.
2. Between the loose sourcing - a "senior official" - and the lack of firsthand perspective in the piece, it could have been written by anyone, like, say, a DAS at a Cabinet Department or an agency. It's not clear if they've even met Trump.
1. On the substance it in the piece, there is little I disagree with. It speaks to what I, and so many others, warned about. But...
