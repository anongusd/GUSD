@FritziRoss @grailsnail It wasn't a suggestion, it was (and remains) an observation. 	As for my "dogmatism", when a word can be traced to a single author or set of authors, the definition is static and dogmatic. You needn't engage with me, but you *really* need to read some political theory.
@jupitercannon Mood. I got, like, 8 hours total out of three nights this weekend trying to finish this essay
@FritziRoss @grailsnail It's shameful that a former reporter doesn't consider definitions important. It isn't "splitting hairs" to correct a fairly large and widespread definitional misconception.
@jupitercannon I know I needed a large amount
@FritziRoss @grailsnail It is broad and general. You're right about that. More specifically, every example you listed is a social service, not a "socialist policy".
@FritziRoss @grailsnail That you think this term meaningless, as well as your belief that you can properly define socialism without reading any socialist theory, is embarassing.
@FritziRoss @grailsnail Democratic Socialism is a school of thought founded by Rosa Luxembourg, which does not fit you description in the slightest. Socialist policies cannot exist without state ownership of the means of productions. You're promoting social democracy.
@FritziRoss @grailsnail You're confusing socialism (in which a state fully owns the means of production) with social policies (which predate socialism by centuries).
@stephens_ben @grailsnail One is a socialist state. The other is a social democracy, not socialism. Socialism is very clearly characterized by the full state ownership of the means of production; heavy social policy, industry regulation, and taxation does not equal socialism.

@stalemates @john_sipher This response is so stupid and unethical that I have absolutely no desire to respond, except that I have a moral obligation to tell you just how stupid and unethical it is. So here goes: this is a stupid and unethical argument, please do some serious thinking about your morals.
@stalemates @john_sipher We have international rules of warfare to which our country has voluntarily chosen to be a party. I accept casualties in war as a tragic necessity. I do not accept the alleged necessity of the US' commission of war crimes any more than I accept the war crimes of another country.

@stalemates @john_sipher Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge policies led to between 1.7 and 2.5 million deaths. Gary Ridgway was convicted of 49 murders and confessed to 71. Somehow, even given such a massive difference in number of victims, I am not inclined to give Ridgway a pass.
@snowknuckles @john_sipher Oh, I do hope you aren't accusing me of this assumption. It's saddening to find the suggestion that we ought to hold ourselves to the same ethical standard we apply to others met with such backlash. Whither flies America's justice?
@stalemates @john_sipher Somehow, the argument that a smaller scale of devastation somehow gives the CIA a leg up in moral principle does little to persuade me.
@john_sipher I find this notion that brutality and destruction is acceptable when performed by /our/ side truly revolting. For what do we fight if we utilize the very brutality we oppose in that opposition? If we use ISIS' tactics to root them out, are we righteous or hypocritical?
@stalemates @john_sipher It's undeniable that the KGB was more blatant in repression &amp; violence, and that they deserve any &amp; all criticism they recieve. However, the CIA has no moral high ground to speak of. If we fail to turn our scrunity towards our own institutions, our outrage is purely performative.
@stalemates @john_sipher The CIA is culpable for the actions of world leaders they directly installed, such as Augusto Pinochet, (who executed at least 3,197, interned as many as 80,000, exiled at least 200,000, and brutally tortured roughly 30,000, in addition to the results of his economic crises).
@stalemates @john_sipher Defense and employment (in conjunction with other US agencies) of at least a thousand Nazi and Japanese war criminals following WWII. Operation Mockingbird. Repeated (though still controversial) allegations of large-scale drug trafficking. State-sponsored human trafficking.
@stalemates @john_sipher Involvement in terror attacks on foreign civilians, whether directly or through inaction in spite of significant advance intelligence (e.g. Cubana de Aviaci√≥n Flight 455). Repeated exhertion of direct influence on US public opinion via NGO subsidies, planted news, &amp; mass media.
@stalemates @john_sipher Funding and training of groups which would go on to kill civilians &amp; other non-combatants, overthrow democratically elected governments, practice human experimentation, and commit targeted killings and assassinations. Operation Condor. Rampant surveilance of citizens.
@stalemates @john_sipher Extrajudicial detainment, extraordinary rendition, and torture of foreign nationals at CIA-run black sites in violation of both US law and international conventions to which the US is a party. Domestic wiretapping of US citizens. Torture by proxy.
@stalemates @john_sipher Okay, do we need to run through the reciepts? We can start with large-scale, illegal, human experimentation. Then there's repeated and significant involvement in assassination attempts against foreign leaders. Coup d'√©tats that install brutal military dictatorships? Check.
@john_sipher Are we going to pretend that the 20th century CIA was a paragon of ethical, peaceful, and just practice? I don't mean to defend the KGB, of course, but it seems to me that our ethical standards (and criticisms of those who fail to meet them) ought to be universal in application.
@i_am_munky @antony_dinunzio @Rainbojack1 @SpielmakerMr @AndrewGillum I'm also curious what your idea of 'accountability' is, here. What display of accountability would satisfy your demand? Assuming it isn't publicly sharing the private, personal information of minors.
@i_am_munky @antony_dinunzio @Rainbojack1 @SpielmakerMr @AndrewGillum This image is a clear call to publicly expose private information of that sort, considering it already contains images of all of their faces.
@antony_dinunzio @Rainbojack1 @i_am_munky @SpielmakerMr @AndrewGillum So the solution is to treat more children poorly, rather than addressing the poor treatment of children belonging to marginalized and oppressed demographics...? That's quite a take.
@Rainbojack1 @i_am_munky @SpielmakerMr @AndrewGillum So your response is effectively "X demographic of children is unjustly excluded from what our society considers appropriate and humane treatment of children, and because of this we should treat Y demographic of children the same way"? That's how this reads.

@i_am_munky @SpielmakerMr @AndrewGillum The fact that you're more focused on the boys than on the underlying problems that their appalling behavior reveals tells me that your outrage is performative, and that you're more interested in having an easy target than in the social issues this incident indicates.
@i_am_munky @SpielmakerMr @AndrewGillum I'm not usually one of those irritating "that's a logical fallacy" types, but I gotta say, if the only response you can come up with is a strawman... not a good sign for the defensability of your position. Please, tell us more about why doxxing minors is good and acceptable.
If your takeaway from the video of those asshole Covington Catholic schoolboys in MAGA hats harassing Nathan Phillips (an Omaha elder) during the Indigenous Peoples March is "wow, these minors should be doxxed", your outrage is either performative or horribly misdirected.
@theredshift11 @TSuli89 @i_am_munky @AndrewGillum I mean, doesn't the Catholic institution as a whole insist that *nobody* can wear condoms? There's obviously a huge sexual abuse problem within the Church, but I'm not so sure about the former claim...

@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul I'm not sure that's true. The publicly accepted story for over a decade was that all but Nicholas II were still alive (in a secret, secure location). The White Army wouldn't become aware that the most direct heirs were dead for some time, and there were several heirs still alive.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Agreed. It should also be remembered that the Soviet Union never successfully made the transition from Socialism to Communism. We can't credit Lenin with "establishing Communism"; he never even anticipated living to see it.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul As I said before, I agree that violence is amoral in and of itself; however, the I regard violence against children as possessing an inherent immorality. That act (and it's ethical quality) exists as completely distinct from any of his other actions, good or bad.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul I'll remind you that I'm not a utilitarian or a consequentialist, so my view of the slaughter of the Romanov children as inexcusable doesn't derive from a 'weighted' calculation of ethical quality. Nor, I'll remind you, have I protested the killing of the adult Romanovs.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Lenin led peasants to freedom, he didn't free them personally - a specification he rightly placed heavy emphasis on.
@JSharayko @steeler_bee @RealCandaceO C) Even true Socialism has never and will never lead to Communism, because Communism is impossible. Communism is a stateless, classless society. At least know what exactly you're opposing. Read an actual book about it, maybe.
@JSharayko @steeler_bee @RealCandaceO You... didn't read my original comments. Can you read?	A) I'm not a socialist.	B) What these new American "Socialists" advocate has *literally* nothing to do with true Socialism. Social policies existed tens of centuries before true Socialism was even thought of.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul To regard the Romanov children as guilty of the wrongdoings of their family would be an error, however. They had yet to offend the serfs as their adult family did, even if they probably would have gone on to do so. Guilt can't be decided preemptively.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul That isn't quite what I propose. An individualistic standard of morality necessitates acknowledgement of any effects of their policies - to ignore them would be to take an incomplete accounting of their individual acts.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Is it?
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul I don't *completely* agree. Without manipulating Lenin's symbolic power, which only grew with his death, Stalin's tenure is arguably impossible. Failing to take measures against this is a serious oversight on his part, especially considering Lenin's knowledge of history.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul I can accept, if not necessarily agree, with this specification.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul The clarification is very helpful, and I agree up to a point. I would additionally stipulate, however, that the mode and subject of any violence have to be very seriously considered in determining moral value.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul To do so seems unkind, even, as it disregard the sacrifice so many heads of state make of their own moral values in the interest of their peoples. No world leader I admire has been morally righteous, but I will never praise their immorality or recognize it as excusable.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul And in that I can only agree with you. I think there's a strong argument to be made that moral righteousness is a luxury heads of state don't have; that doesn't mean we ought to hold them to a different standard.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul I don't hold to utilitarian ethics. I would argue that some acts are so "incontrivertably evil" that they can besmirch even the most otherwise ethical individual's moral standing - until amends are made for them.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul However, "goodness" as it's used in the original thread seems, to me, to refer explicitly to moral value (given that Pres. Putin is also a "good" leader in the sense of efficacy, and the original thread is in derision of him).
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Interested? Yes. And if we use the term "good" to denote efficacy, Lenin's "goodness" can't be denied. He was a truly effective, charismatic, and talented political mind, and his achievements are as impressive as his writings are (often) insightful.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul (Not a defense of Imperial reign, by the way. We agree, at least, that the fall of the Romanov Dynasty was a net good. The value of its fall at that particular time, in light of the state which replaced it, is much less immediately clear.)
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul A conflation you have yet to support, by the way. Your only support for the claim of morality was the prevention of imperial resurgence, presupposing the inherent moral value of this inconsiderate of the system which replaced it.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul That's a fair point. You, however, express the same conflation of the politically advantageous and the morally just, especially in your ultimate analysis of the act we're discussing. The murders were immoral, but politically advantageous, and you deny any distinction.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul That is indeed interesting, and the first solid argument you've made thus far. I can recognize a claim that there's insufficient evidence to link him to the act.

@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul If it was so defensible, why did the Soviet Union publicly deny the execution of any of the family members except Nicholas II? Surely they should've been proud! After all, their slaughter was "necessary". What is there to hide?
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Do you think "most" leaders order that children be slaughtered in the most cruel available way, their corpses stripped and grotesquely disfigured then thrown down a mineshaft to await eventual trasportation to a pair of large holes in the ground?
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Your fallacy of the day is: tu quoque! You're attempting to avoid engaging legitimate criticism by turning the same criticism on your accuser; you're not even doing it well! I don't celebrate leaders who knowingly butcher children.
@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Yep, there it is! So, tell me, would you have personally gutted the thirteen-year-old boy with an 8-inch bayonett, riddled him with bullets, and clubbed him with the butt of a rifle before shooting him in the head, or would you just be happy to let someone else do it?
@JonathanStevey1 @afred92 @charliekirk11 It absolutely is possible, but possibility isn't equivalent to probability or certainty. We can't use possibility to inform policy. We can't use information we don't have access to as the basis for our decision-making.
@JSharayko @steeler_bee @RealCandaceO I suspect I've read a lot more history than you have, sir. Socialist revolts historically came from vastly underpaid workers being subjected to nightmarish working conditions, not from disaffected youths pushing for social programs.
@afred92 @charliekirk11 I mean, there is literally no source anyone has been able to find for this information. Not even the Trump administration has documented this arrest. Kinda easy to see why people might be a bit suspicious, no?
@CindiTurchik @permdude @charliekirk11 He's erring on the side of the law. Either something is illegal or it isn't; blurring the lines of legality because of fear of an external threat is a dangerous path to take.

@dparasole @john_sipher @McFaul Really? Condoning the murder of the Romanov children is hardly indicative of a good leader. 		Please don't give me the "necessary evil" bullshit about how they had to kill the heirs apparent. Child butchery isn't excusable.

@penman98 @chicksonright @tedcruz Pelosi's net worth is due in part to the fact that she's had an annual salary varying between $174,000 and $223,500 for 30 years now. Her husband also owns Financial Leasing Services, which is the main source of her net worth.
@penman98 @chicksonright @tedcruz Wouldn't that suggest that the corrupting influence is a function of taling money where they shouldn't, rather than a function of time spent in public service?
@steeler_bee @JSharayko @RealCandaceO Conversely, the Right still uses the original definition, so they react as you see above. They don't realize that American Leftists are using the term to refer to a heavy emphasis on social policy as opposed to truly state-run economy.
@steeler_bee @JSharayko @RealCandaceO It's linguistic confusion. The term 'democratic socialism' was used by Sanders to refer to 'social democracy', and that's what informs the American Left's use of 'socialist' now (as opposed to its definition, which explicitly requires state ownership of the means of production).
@penman98 @chicksonright @tedcruz Doesn't this measure ensure that constituents are subjected to a consistently lower quality of written law?
@penman98 @chicksonright @tedcruz Also, why is a career politician worse than, say, a career neurosurgeon? We know that experience is extremely important when writing legislation - even the most experienced lawmakers will make mistakes, and those are more frequent the less experience a legislator has.
@penman98 @chicksonright @tedcruz But how would it do that? Experience is, ultimately, always going to equal more power in Congress, which means there's still an elite few with more influence/power due to seniority. Don't term limits just ensure that the elites are people with less experience?
@penman98 @chicksonright @tedcruz I'm not really convinced that this is a function of the length of time someone spends in elected office. Doesn't introduction of term limits reduce accountability by allowing an official to do whatever they wish in their last term, no longer needing votes for reelection?

Any alternative takes? I'm no expert on tax law, so if I'm missing something or anyone has a different perspective, please share.
All that to say: doesn't it seem like addressing these pressing issues is a necessary prerequisite to higher income taxes on the wealthy being fiscally useful? I appreciate the symbolic value alone, but it seems (to me) that this would be a more meaningful reform.
The super-wealthy can also claim tax benefits by purchasing multiple houses (or even yachts). Should a home's value appreciate, the profits can be classified as capital gains (which have a much lower tax rate than any other kind of investment income, or than salaries).
(2/2) Mitt Romney, for example, reduced his tax rate dramatically by claiming the management fee of his corporation as a capital gain as opposed to income.
(1/2) Often, wealthy individuals opt to incorporate their own personal brand, which comes with many tax advantages and options - you can channel your wages through a titular "corporation", claim expenses, pay yourself a wage without interest, and reduce your income taxes.
Executives often choose to take part of their payment in deferred-compensation plans, rather than recieving it at one time; this enables their earnings to grow tax-deferred, in some cases for ten or more years. Of Fortune 100 CEOs, 79% were offered a defered compensation plan.
Recent estimates hold that as much as $21 billion is currently hidden in offshore accounts. Executives can opt to take part of their compensation in stock options (the majority of which are only taxed when exercised), letting them choose when and if they pay taxes.
This isn't to say I don't believe in higher taxation of the wealthy, I very much do. I'm just not sure that it's a valuable or effective thing to implement prior to comprehensive reform of what is, fundamentally, a broken system of taxation.
The revenue estimates I've seen for @AOC's tax proposal are roughly 60-80 billion annually - nothing to scoff at. However, estimates for revenue loss due to loopholes are 70-100 billion annually. Wouldn't it make more sense to ensure taxes are actually paid before raising them?
@leitchaj @Noahpinion @Realprofneil @AOC I think the flaw in this estimate is its failure to account for avoidance and loopholes available to the wealthy - the current estimate of how much is lost in revenue to this is between 70 and 100 billion a year.

RT @cjw_phd: I hate this paper I am currently writing. Has this ever happened to anyone else?
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist Much better said than I managed, but I believe so, though "driving at" may be a bit generous; I'm only trying to pinpoint why ontological arguments leave me feeling dissatisfied and unconvinced. Any chance you recall the name of the paper? I'm interested in reading it.
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist So, the ontological argument proves undoubtedly the existence of the concept of God, but doesn't succeed in proving the existence of an actual God. I can undeniably prove the existence of the concept of Santa Claus, but that doesn't require/imply that there is an actual Santa.
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist The concept of a thing is typically understood to be distinct from the thing itself. The concept of an apple is not the same thing as an apple; both the concept and the actual apple exist.
@ImTommyBoy3 @kateetrant @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump If the officers recognized it and didn't provide medical assistance, it was murder. If the officers weren't able to recognize it, they aren't being adequately prepared for the job they're expected to perform.
@ImTommyBoy3 @kateetrant @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump It doesn't take a medical professional to see signs of severe dehydration; it's important to know them if you live in a hot climate in general, especially when you're someone whose job involves custody of others.
@ImTommyBoy3 @kateetrant @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Legally, they would be if they recognized the signs of a Xanax overdose and didn't take you to a hospital, yeah.
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist I don't think I phrased my object well/clearly, so I'll rephrase: I don't think ontological arguments necessarily do anything to prove the existence of God, they prove only the existence of the *concept* of God, which was never in dispute. Does that make more sense?

@IbraSergeant @ErrorTheorist A simple 'yes' would have sufficed. That's all I needed to know - thanks.
@IbraSergeant @ErrorTheorist I'm confused about your use of the word 'improbability'. Is it purely intuitive?
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist The issue being, I think, that it's unclear what the value of this analytic truth actually is without an a priori definition of God. How is it helpful to prove something called God exists if there's no indication of what that something is?
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist Spinoza's ontological argument is a specific aspect of his argument for Substance Monism, and as such doesn't run into the same problem as the rest. His argument does have other issues, to be sure, but I feel fairly safe saying his are much more particular than the rest.
@Evollaqi @anti_nomy @ErrorTheorist Spinoza is unique, here, because he makes a strong effort to define God as well as prove His existence (as opposed to proving the existence of something called God, but having no good answer to what that something actually is)
@ssleslito @realDonaldTrump There's only one part of this reply that's even an argument, and it's a logical fallacy. Congratulations.

@anti_nomy @Evollaqi @ErrorTheorist I don't care for ontological arguments much either... but, as Russell astutely pointed out, it's easier to be persuaded of their being poor arguments than it is to point out specifically what's wrong with them.
@anti_nomy @Evollaqi @ErrorTheorist It's an ontological argument (Anselm of Canterbury). Usually these arguments start with an a priory theory about the universe's organization; if the theory proves true, the argument supplies reasons why God must exist. Descartes adopted it from Anselm, then Liebniz from Descartes
@IbraSergeant @ErrorTheorist How are you determining probability in the third argument, if you don't mind my asking?

@TosinOlufeyimi @philosophypills Bearing that in mind, I'm not sure I agree that underestimating analytical phil. doesn't harm phil. as a whole; if analytical phil.'s undervaluation leads a number of philosophers to ignore the school, the results are much the same as ignoring any other part of phil.'s history.
@TosinOlufeyimi @philosophypills I see your point, but suspect this may be a case of linguistic confusion. I believe 'underestimate' was meant in the sense of underestimating a thing's value/contribution, rather than underestimating the danger of a threat.
@lastpositivist @philosophypills A few of my acquaintences who have a bad habit  of underestimating (or outright dismissing) analytic philosophy do so largely out of resentment for the former; I suspect that may be fairly commonplace.

@CypressRozay ... incest, fondling, and attempted rape."	Simply put, any kind of sexual contact which lacks the consent of at least one party is sexual assault. Contact isn't even always necessarily involved - verbal assault of a sexual nature (sexual harassment) is a type of sexual assault.
@CypressRozay The U.S. DoJ defines sexual assault as¬†"any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation...
@CypressRozay First of all, you're correct: physical contact of a sexual nature with someone without their consent is always a felony. Second, you're confusing sexual assault with rape. Rape is a specific subset of sexual assault, the two aren't precisely synonymous.

@CypressRozay I'm not sure I've ever read a more idiotic argument. This is just... I mean, it's just patently untrue, there's nothing else to say about it. I would be willing to bet a very, very large sum of money that the percentage of sexual assault victims who feel this way is miniscule.

@GeoffWBaron @JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe True, I think the right's go-to has been describing larger social policies as 'socialism' (a bad habit the left has adopted since 2016) when it refers specifically to government ownership of the means of production. I suspect we all tend to draw extreme, knee-jerk comparisons.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe I don't use that acronym, but yes. Most notably Fox coverage, if I remember correctly.
@GeoffWBaron @JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe It will depend in very large part on whether there is any further corroboration, and even should said corroboration arise, I expect - and hope - that there will not be an indictment until Trump is no longer in office. Nobody needs a constitutional crisis.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe They were just about everywhere, as I recall. 'Fascism' was used to describe his supposed overuse of executive power, for starters. Crying 'fascism' is a bipartisan problem.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe I'll repeat myself for clarity: I have one - but as I said above, I won't discourse with you any further due to what I percieve as a lack of basic civility in the way you interact.
@GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @JDSlaughter2 @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe I agree - albeit for different reasons, I suspect. Fascism is a 20th century ideological phenomena which existed, much like communism, within a specific historical context. Regardless of percieved similarities, tossing 'fascism' around is inaccurate and fearmongering.
@GeoffWBaron @JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe It doesn't take a legal expert (though legislative law is what I'm in school for). I won't copy-paste or paraphrase the full writing here, Geoff - it's far too long - but if you read the FECA's most recent definition of 'contribution', you will find the answer you're looking for.
@GeoffWBaron @JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe First of all, I'm not a liberal. Second of all, please let me know when you see the irony of your reply (hint: ad hominem).
@GeoffWBaron @JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Actually, it was nothing more or less than a logically fallacious argument. You avoid engaging with criticism by responding with criticism (and assuming my position on former Secretary Clinton).
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Again, a claim unsupported by the written law.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe You seem upset. I'm tempted to respond, but I won't waste time engaging someone who can't stay civil.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe And AGAIN, I remind you that this claim is unsupported by the written law.
@GeoffWBaron @JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Though there is a discussion to be had here, but on principle I don't respond to appeals to hypocrisy (tu quoque).
@GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @JDSlaughter2 @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe That's untrue. We have a confession by Michael Cohen explicitly stating its primary intent as affecting the President's campaign outcome.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Restate this, please. Your grammar makes this reply a bit tough to understand, and I'd like to respond.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @GeoffWBaron @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Are we defending foreign contributions to a political activist group? I was under the impression that disapproval of Russian contributions to the NRA was fairly bipartisan - or was I mistaken?
@GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @JDSlaughter2 @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Excepting that Michael Cohen confessed to its being made for that explicit purpose. Also, your claim either misinterprets or intentionally misrepresents the written law.
@JDSlaughter2 @GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe I will repeat my former statement: this claim isn't substantiated by the written law.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @GeoffWBaron @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe This is a non-reply. Pres. Trump's spending of $66 million of his own money is not mutually exclusive to his receiving any other contributions.
@GeoffWBaron @29t4ut @JDSlaughter2 @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe It is, in fact, illegal, as I explained elsewhere in this thread. The intention of paying the pornstar off was to protect the president's chances in the election, which does make the payments illegal.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe He didn't argue that it was okay for HRC's 'people' to destroy subpoenaed evidence. He argued that no reasonable prosecutor would have pressed charges. You would have noted the distinction if you had read the full transcript more critically.
@discernment2011 @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe This point is wholly unrelated to my argument.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe This information is unrelated and irrelevent to the context of campaign finance law.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe This is detailed nowhere in the written law.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe Neither of the two were included in campaign finance reports, which is another violation. Additionally, FECA prohibits corporate campaign donations. In the McDougal payoff, American Media Inc., parent company of the National Enquirer, provided the funds.
@JDSlaughter2 @29t4ut @MymymyCovfefe @RepRatcliffe The payments were made specifically to protect Trump's chances in the election, making them legally classifiable as in-kind campaign contributions. The payments of $150,000 to Karen McDougal and $130,000 to Stormy Daniels each violate per-individual contribution limits of $2,700.

@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz Oh, and since looking it up on wikipedia was too much work for you, I'll even link you to the page to save you the trouble:	https://t.co/2CUlKC0i2G
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz You're not likely to get your conversation on "healthcare, equity, and justice" if you can't even form a cohesive group identity without stealing another political party's name. Your misrepresentation also actively enables the Right to demonize universal healthcare as Stalinism.
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz What you're not getting is that (real) democratic socialists already exist. They have a movement that you and yours are playing an active role in erasing. If a group of revolutionary leftists decided to call themselves Democrats, that wouldn't make them Democrats.
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz I didn't realize that my (very practical) semantic question kept the conversation about healthcare, equity, and justice from taking place. Funny thing, though - there's a difference between natural linguistic evolution and ill-educated misdefinition of a term.
@AwSmDuo @jarodtweettrash @DecadentDefiant @FatBoyExercises @basic_random @LegendHDGaming "Retard" as an insult? What is this, 2008? Catch up, bud. This ain't it.
@LegendHDGaming @Ligerzero459 @AustinOuellet10 @martiansunset @MahouPoint @basic_random @red0herring @jaredlholt Bless your heart... the guy "jokingly" uses racial slurs in his video's description, and according to him had done so several times in his video prior to altering it in response to backlash. Social consequences for racist "humor" are not legal consequences, but nice strawman.
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz Side note: I'm not a socialist, &amp; I never implied I was. If I called myself a socialist it would misrepresent the ideas of a pre-existing political group. Wouldn't want to do that, now would we?
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz Getting involved in the political process involves educating yourself about basic political/economic terminology. If you don't want to read a book, you could at least take the initiative of reading the wikipedia page for the political party whose name you've taken &amp; twisted.
@chippler582 @jaredlholt When you have a following as big as his, yeah. You don't get to endorse people without due diligence when you have millions of people consuming your content.

@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz 2016 was the first time 'democratic socialism' was used to refer to welfare policy. Before then, socialism meant one thing and one alone - for anyone but liberal center-leftists who like to play political revolutionary dress-up, it still does.
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz Wow, you looked up semantics! I'm so proud of you. It's hardly "whining" to argue for specificity of language when there are serious practical ramifications for the terms being discussed, but not having read even the simplest political theory I can see why you're so confused.

@grailsnail @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz That would be one of the practical ramifications I mentioned. When you call common-sense social welfare policy 'socialism', and make it out to be more radical than it is, you open yourself up to accusations of Stalinism and alienate centrists who might otherwise support you.
@grailsnail @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz By a large number of the liberal center-left, yes, but hardly the left as a whole. Anyone who studies political theory recognizes the distinction, especially considering it still has some serious, practical ramifications today.
@RisaraldaPerez @DemSocialists @DSASantaCruz Socialism refers specifically to government ownership of the means of production. If the idea is that Americans should accept common-sense social welfare policy as socialism, it's a ludicrous one. Save your sanctimony for someone else, and maybe read some leftist theory.

@DOFFactory @philosophybites @drjuliashaw As for your last question, where do I start? Are you just ignoring the massive number of ethical theories which contain assertions of a foundation for morality? It's kinda hard for ethicists to determine the moral value of a thing if they don't know what makes a thing good/bad.
@DOFFactory @philosophybites @drjuliashaw Regarding 'not even in the case of AI': True AI is so unlikely as to warrant no serious conversation. AI as it is now (e.g. autonomous vehicles) absolutely requires some serious discussion, but I seriously doubt the usefulness of academic ethicists in said discussion.
@DOFFactory @philosophybites @drjuliashaw Do you really see philosophers in academia being in any way encouraged toward applied anything? There is a pressure to make moral judgments, but none to arrive at anything resembling a consensus, let alone that consensus' application to anything with tangible consequences.

@DOFFactory @philosophybites @drjuliashaw This seems like a bad comparison, if only because the idea that philosophers feel any pressure to "make some decision in the end" is... optimistic. Also, compromise about politics is generally easier than compromise about the foundation of all morality.
@philosophybites @drjuliashaw I think the more pertinent point is that the process of pursuing a PhD in Ethics so often leaves one researching/writing on infinitely specific subject matter (gotta love academia); a broader view &amp; understanding of Ethics would be more helpful in this 'AI' work, I suspect.

@Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi Only over the last year or two have people decided that Pelosi is a 'moderate' Democrat. She still remains the representative that centrist Dems cite opposition to to show that they aren't 'radical' - the idea that she's some sort of moderate is absurd &amp; blatantly untrue.
@Ocasio2018 @Ocasio2018, I'm 100% positive that every single Democrat who has threatened @NancyPelosi's election to the Speakership has been accused of being divisive, because it's true. Pelosi was the first female Minority Whip, Minority Leader, and Speaker, respectively. She's who we need.

@PixyMisa @Zython86 @Aliscano97 @socialAk47 @existentialcoms I see their problem as almost exactly the reverse: they typically decry any global economic interaction whatever, and are focused on local optimization to what seems like a dangerous, impractical degree. That's just economic, nevermind the isolationist localism it would engender.
@PixyMisa @Zython86 @Aliscano97 @socialAk47 @existentialcoms Anarcho-communism is completely distinct from socialism, though; the state is fundamental to socialism, where it's antithetical to anarchism (of any kind). I think I agree with your general premise, but it's directed at socialism rather than anarcho-communism.
@PixyMisa @Zython86 @Aliscano97 @socialAk47 @existentialcoms I'm not really comfortable saying that, actually. I certainly suspect as much, but since there's been no tangible example, I don't really want to make definitive claims - especially not when there are more solid issues to take with the ideology and its praxis.
@Zython86 @PixyMisa @Aliscano97 @socialAk47 @existentialcoms Anarcho-communism advocates revolutionary action against the state which, even if successful, would be terroristic in its effect on civilian populations. It advocates a purely stateless, moneyless society implemented without transitionary stages, with no guarantee of success.
@Zython86 @PixyMisa @Aliscano97 @socialAk47 @existentialcoms Ancoms have completely and utterly failed to mobilize the kind of "radical action" they've proclaimed as the only solution for over a century; 'they never leave their mom's basement' may not be a fair argument, but their abject failure to create a compelling movement is.

@jupitercannon I get it, I really do. Having your first vote lose to Lyin' Ted is almost as bad as having your first vote lose to the sitting President... but we're in a better position now than we have been in decades.
We may be looking at as many as 12 blue congressional seats... and in Texas, of all places! I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but we won big in Texas tonight. We should be damned proud of ourselves. We'll be back again in two years... and we'll turn Texas blue.
That being said? We can't let disappointment overshadow what a massive victory this has been for Texas Democrats. @BetoORourke may not be a Senator, but he helped turn Texas seats blue in a state whose Democratic Party has been in shambles for over 3 decades!

@saltiecrocAU @DavidYoho12 @WeHearPodcast @NBCNews It's not price-gouging if it's driven by scarcity. The less access there is to a commodity with a demand, and the more risk is associated with its acquisition, the higher the prices. Price-gouging implies unethical business practice.
@BarryBarretta @SteveoEvans @martyr021 @sooatwoo @USATODAY There simply is no support for your position anywhere within constitutional history.

@saltiecrocAU @DavidYoho12 @WeHearPodcast @NBCNews I'm a full-time Dentonian, I'll repeat that I know how common illegal guns are - their ready availability is what causes their inexpensiveness.

@DavidYoho12 @WeHearPodcast @NBCNews Bub, I live in Texas, I know how much it costs to buy a gun illegally right now.

@cinnanymphie @jaythenerdkid The only critical reason I find to stress the distinction between this movement and the Nazi Party is that of action - we can't address this movement the way you would address a movement of 20th-century Nazis. Their strategies are different, so that of the Left must be as well.
@cinnanymphie @jaythenerdkid I also have to wonder about the suggestion that this "slander" is the cause of the far-right's extremity, too. This comes off as victim-blaming to me, not something you want (especially just after a synagogue full of innocents has just been attacked).
@cinnanymphie @jaythenerdkid Their attitudes toward minorities, while not enough to qualify them as Nazis - because that refers to a very specific set of ideals - is disturbingly comparable. While we may not be looking at the Nazi Party, that doesn't preclude the possibility of their becoming as dangerous.
@cinnanymphie @jaythenerdkid Okay, as someone who doesn't believe these groups are Nazis, to suggest that they aren't comparable is kind of absurd. The real difference is ideological, Naziism advocating the nationalization of industry (among other distinctions)...

@bringouttheweed @TIME Then again, you've completely misunderstood the point of the article, so I shouldn't be surprised. They aren't suggesting that you "[shouldn't] let women be in power because it ends badly". The author is highlighting a real issue women in power often face.
@bringouttheweed @TIME You've either misunderstood me or are making a strawman argument. Your use of sample size is correct - I'm simply suggesting that the importance of sample size is somewhat less significant in socio-political historical analysis. But go off, I guess.

@ashbrandn @kate_manne @ashbrandn, I would also like to point out that your tone with me was far less dismissive than it was with @kate_manne. The only visible difference between us is that I'm more masculine-presenting - in fact, Manne is far more qualified to discuss this than I. Why the disparity?
@ashbrandn @kate_manne Think how, when a man doesn't get what he wants (when and the way he wants it) from a woman, he will try to devalue her physical beauty. Note how many men, after being rejected in some way by a woman they formerly found attractive, will turn around and deride her appearance.
@ashbrandn @kate_manne Compare how people rank women's physical beauty to how people rank any products on Amazon. Think of the common expectation that a woman should 'put out' if you buy her dinner or a gift.
@ashbrandn @kate_manne In our world, a woman's value typically isn't evaluated by her individual merit, but by what she is able to give to men - and to what extent she chooses to. In that context, a woman's physical beauty is merely a commodity; like any other product, it's reviewed, bought, and sold.

@tylerpmiranda @gupdiver @NBCNews Let's be more clear - he actively committed treason.
@alvinant @NBCNews Hating slavery while fighting for the South wasn't noble, no matter how much people push that narrative. Betraying your anti-slavery principles because you feel obligated to commit treason along with your home state is not admirable.
@shrewshrew @kate_manne @sbarolo @m_d_kerr I think that's an excellent point! It's definitely easy to dwell on the academic/theoretical side of things to excess. For those on the recieving end of the behavior, the practical reality is usually much more pertinent.

@sbarolo @kate_manne @shrewshrew I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm a real fan of Manne's work, and only wanted to clarify the use of the term; I can't see how my doing so was an example of 'himpathy squared'.

@dakota295752 @hdmtnryder @MikeTokes @NewRightUS @TheALX Read your own writing. You said discriminatory *beliefs* aren't constitutionally protected. That's absurd. Beliefs are constitutionally protected regardless of their content.
@dakota295752 @hdmtnryder @MikeTokes @NewRightUS @TheALX "[The courts decided you don't have a right to discriminatory beliefs]". Okay, glad to know it's illegal for Nazis and Klansmen to publicly demonstrate. Oh, wait! It isn't, as long as they aren't imposing those discriminatory beliefs on others. Read a book, Jen. It helps.
@dakota295752 @hdmtnryder @MikeTokes @NewRightUS @TheALX You don't have a constitutional right to act on discriminatory beliefs. Your beliefs are constitutionally protected, no matter what they are. Legally, your rights end where they infringe upon somebody else's.
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr It's not prudent to claim knowledge where you don't have it. Every one of us would be wise to realize that we have no idea what, if anything, happened. We never will. Anyone who doesn't realize that needs to learn to think critically. Only Kavanaugh and Ford will ever truly know.
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr His job wasn't to prove anything. He was the accused, not tye accuser. His job was to be calm, consistent, clear, and respectful, and to remain nonpartisan as befits the position he's been confirmed for.
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr It's interesting that you know that it never happened. Were you there? You should've been called to testify, could've really cleared things up.
@dakota295752 @hdmtnryder @MikeTokes @NewRightUS @TheALX You do realize that political beliefs are also constitutionally protected, right?
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr Prepared statements are not comparable to interrogation. Also, Kavanaugh's statements were really not particularly detailed - he gave non-answers and skirted questions.
@dakota295752 @hdmtnryder @MikeTokes @NewRightUS @TheALX See, it sounds like you think they are the same thing. If the baker has the right not to make a product that violates his beliefs, then twitter has the right to ban whoever they want. Legally, companies are just as entitled to beliefs as individuals.
The senate vote today has, whether you believe Kavanaugh or not, delegitimized the most stable branch of our government in the eyes of half of the country. That our senators were more concerned with partisanship and principle than the stability of the judiciary is shameful.
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr Trained professionals should have been responsible for questioning both of them. Because they weren't, I don't think we are one step closer to knowing the truth, and I don't think Democrats can push very hard on perjury (since he didn't give solid enough answers/definitions)
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr Just like in a trial, you should never argue while questioning somebody - especially while under a time constraint. Because Democratic senators were drawn into arguing their time away, they didn't force Kavanaugh to stop being evasive or to give concrete answers.
@MLGoodell @luvtheusa76 @senatemajldr Happens to the best of us. My point is effectively that FBI agents are trained to interrogate. The Senate Judiary Committee are not, as I think we saw in the ineffective questioning of Kavanaugh from both sides, and of Ford by the Democrats.

@neiltyson @PhilosophyMttrs Neil, your comments are still misinformed. The entire scientific profession still relies on underlying philosophical assumptions. Read more, Neil. Maybe you should speak with Bill Nye, who has radically changed his mind about the relevence of philosophy to modern science.
@PaulicusB @imsovit @neiltyson @PhilosophyMttrs Yes, but the statement given in earnest was effectively just as derisive, just as blithely unaware. Epistemology and the philosophy of science are foundational to the scientific community's ability to make accurate statements and observations about the world.
As of Thursday, the focus on #Kavanaugh should have shifted entirely. Whether you believe Dr. Ford or not, we may never really know what happened. What we know he is guilty of, as of Thursday, is several counts of perjury. He should be removed from office, disbarred, and tried.
@hdmtnryder @MikeTokes @NewRightUS @TheALX Okay, but that makes you the hypocrite. If you don't believe a baker should have to bake a cake he doesn't want to bake, why do you believe a social media company doesn't have the right to determine its content?

@Skipease @sccturf @MTDemps @SenateMajLdr I would see President Trump order an investigation, which he has the right to do, simply to see the matter resolved quickly, judiciously (pun intended), and with the least amount of scandal possible given the current volatile climate.
@Skipease @sccturf @MTDemps @SenateMajLdr I absolutely agree - that being said, the problem is the time that chain of command takes. By the time the FBI has jurisdiction, the confirmation could easily have taken place, and having a Supreme Court judge under federal investigation is an upset I don't think we need.

@sccturf @Skipease @MTDemps @SenateMajLdr Additionally, he faces multiple allegations - Ford's has not been (and may not ever be) corroborated, but Rivera's allegation has been corroborated be a considerable number of their Yale colleagues, more than enough to warrant a federal investigation into the matter.
