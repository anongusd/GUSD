How will Doug Ford change the health-care system? Here are some answers | CBC News https://t.co/FBH7Pb6zht
@MandyontheMoon So many ppl are shut out of getting the care &amp; support they need because of financial, social, cultural, &amp; other barriers. Ppl too ill to work cannot pay for tx &amp; other support, cannot wait on massively long waitlists for the minuscule &amp; inadequate public care that does exist.
@MandyontheMoon I try to say, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs better than nothing‚Äù but w their resources so much more can be done. (&amp; how about the gov‚Äôt get on board to actually properly fund mental healthcare? Most isn‚Äôt covered by OHIP &amp; what‚Äòs covered is very limited w too long waitlists &amp; is very inadequate.)
@MandyontheMoon Thanks for this article. I can relate to how it doesn‚Äôt speak to me &amp; ignores me &amp; so many other people dealing w more severe mental illness &amp; not just overall general mental health concerns, &amp; still doesn‚Äôt do much to reduce much stigma &amp; help us access appropriate supports.

@m_layton 4 ‚ÄúBut simply declaring a war on the car ignores the reality that, given Toronto‚Äôs size, it‚Äôs a necessity for many families.‚Äù Making roads safer for non car users doesn‚Äôt take away from those who might otherwise need to use a car. We just need more balance &amp; not put cars first.
@m_layton 3 People outside of a car do not stand a chance against a car. We need to dethrone the car, and give everyone else a chance. The car is not king‚Äîit shouldn‚Äôt be treated as such. PEOPLE should take priority, esp those who don‚Äôt stand a chance against a car.
@m_layton 2 Of course not. Other motorized vehicles do that. The Sun lacks any sense of rationality, but I knew that looooong ago. We need to take as many measures as possible to make the streets safer for non motorized road users, who were using roads long before cars were around.
@m_layton 1 ‚ÄúOf course, one death of a cyclist or pedestrian‚Äîor of drivers and passengers in cars, or on motorcycles, often overlooked in these discussions‚Äîis one death too many.‚Äù Gee, I wonder what kills ppl in cars &amp; on motorcycles‚Äîdo you think it‚Äôs pedestrians &amp; ppl on bicycles?
