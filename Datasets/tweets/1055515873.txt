.@jiminhofe: #DRIVEAct gives states tools to ensure all users contribute to infrastructure spending
#DRIVEAct prepares our nation’s transportation system for the future by promoting innovation across all aspects of the program - @jiminhofe
#DRIVEAct provides transparency &amp; accountability so stakeholders and public can have faith in the integrity of hwy programs and use of tax $
.@jiminhofe: our businesses will suffer and America will continue to lag behind our international competitors if we stick with current law
#DRIVEAct directs new funding towards freight transpo projects that provide the platform for our businesses to compete globally @jiminhofe
#DRIVEAct eliminates duplicative review, expands categorical exclusions, and keeps agenciesunder a deadline - @jiminhofe
Current law has no additional reforms; #DRIVEAct reforms the program and makes it work better
Current law gives states and local governments no certainty - #DRIVEAct provides long-term certainty @jiminhofe
Current law funding has no growth (not even inflation); #DRIVEAct provides growth in highway and transit programs to each state - @jiminhofe
Consequences to voting no on #DRIVEAct: no big projects: Current law fails to provide long-term certainty states and cities need to complete

.@jiminhofe said that OK currently in compliance w/ ozone stndrd - but new rule puts many counties out of compliance http://t.co/fMw9sZtEbO
Judge Moore: The current '08 ozone standards are having an impact, are improving health. We should let them play out.
.@SenatorFischer: In NE, it's not unusual to see 1 person per square mile. Our counties cannot afford increased risk to transpo costs.
Judge Moore: rural communities depend on hwy improvement. more regs will only delay or prohibit projects, increase costs. #ozonerule
142ppb was the highest spike in high elevations in UT-- but no correlation between hospital admissions and the high ozone day
McKee says the closer to the stratosphere, the more natural ozone. What should my region do at a higher elevation? Cut down more trees?
EPA Adm says health rules will boast new business, new jobs. Hon. Moore reminds us its private sector that create jobs, regs get in the way

What is conclusive about #CPP That state economies will suffer under these EPA Rules
Sen. Whitehouse attempts to move debate away from the legality of #CPP to the science, which remains inconclusive.
Mr. Martella: Congress never authorized the EPA to run a renewable portfolio implementation program, EPA cannot give itself that authority

EPW Committee hearing amdts to S. 679: Lautenberg Chem. Security Act authored by @DavidVitter and @SenatorTomUdall http://t.co/sJXanTimq9
Despite opposing outside input to TSCA reform, @EPWBoxer says, "Not all genius resides in the quiet room of the Capitol."
.@EPA lacks the expertise that CDC and ATSDR have on disease.  Let the experts focus on disease.
.@EPWBoxer amdt #5 would duplicate what the CDC and the ATSDR do now and would serve as a significant EPA powergrab
.@EPWBoxer Amdt 5 would inappropriately make @EPA principal agency responsible for investigating, responding to reported disease clusters
Discussing @EPWBoxer @SenMarkey @SenSanders amdt 5: well outside the scope of TSCA and would inappropriately include disease cluster program
.@EPWBoxer @SenatorCarper amdt 3 is unnecess bc prioritization criteria in Section 4A of bill already address hazard and exposure potential
re: @EPWBoxer's assertion that there are no deadlines...S.697 includes over 15 clear deadlines for action
.@DavidVitter amdt already clarifies that any ban or phase-outs of chemicals shall be implemented in “as short a period as practicable”
Now discussing @SenMarkey's amdt #2 - would establish an unnecessary 3-yr deadline for compliance with certain rules promulgated by EPA
Now debating @SenMarkey #1 - amdt is inconsistent with the risk-based approach to the identification of priority substances under the bill
EPA testified before EPW that language in TSCA deal would give the ability to make asbestos 1st high priority, fix problems with current law
.@EPWBoxer @SenSanders @SenMarkey &amp; @SenGillibrand #1 is Is unnecessary as the manager’s amndt gives EPA tools necessary to review chemicals
