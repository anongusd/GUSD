@SenJudiciary Republicans continue to go after survivors of sexual violence. Let‚Äôs repeat the obvious: These brave survivors are NOT on trial. The burden of proof is on Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs shoulders. NO ONE is guaranteed a seat on the Supreme Court. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/jNNTrFnpsl
Taking sexual violence seriously requires investigating credible allegations, like the ones against Kavanaugh.

We need to #HaltTheHearing on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and it's not just because he thinks the president is above the law. Kavanaugh on #SCOTUS would be a vote to roll back the progress we've made on access to health care. We can't let that happen. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/vuufbJzIUa
If you believe that your access to birth control shouldn‚Äôt be blocked by the religious views of others, then you should #StopKavanaugh. Call your senators today and tell them to #StopKavanaugh! ‚òéÔ∏è202-224-3121‚òéÔ∏è  #WhatsAtStake #SaveSCOTUS
#WhatsAtStake with Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to #SCOTUS? Healthcare and reproductive rights. His record indicates he could allow religious beliefs to justify discrimination. That's why we must #StopKavanaugh: https://t.co/WjeOv5mWwU
In the next few years, #SCOTUS will be asked to decide whether the government must give businesses &amp; nonprofit orgs religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws. The Court could grant a license to discriminate against the LGBTQ community. #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
What's at stake with Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court? Nothing less than the separation of church and state! Act now: Call your senators today at ‚òéÔ∏è202-224-3121‚òéÔ∏è and urge them to #StopKavanaugh!

Eric Garner was killed over being suspected of selling a loose cigarette. How many times will we watch our black men be choked out, shot, and beaten in broad daylight by the people meant to protect us? We must hold our law enforcement officers accountable for their actions.
NAN has led the fight against police misconduct for years and we continue to stand with the Garner family against the shameful actions of the officers of NYPD and the slow movement of the DOJ on coming to a resolution on how to handle the officers involved in the murder.
To ensure that no family ever has to endure what the Garner family and many others have gone through, we must hold the responsible individuals accountable for their actions. NAN has made it a priority to hold police accountable on the local, state, and national level. https://t.co/rgwAQyihM3

NAN has been vigilant in demanding change and respect for our nation‚Äôs constitution. Our work is never done. We refuse to have a political puppet sit at the heart of America‚Äôs justice system. #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
The right to equal justice under the law should not be conditional or based upon a person‚Äôs color or economic status. Brett #Kavanaugh doesn‚Äôt seem to believe that. He stands to serve the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the marginalized #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
Dr. King had a dream that America would live up to its promise of equality under the law and equal opportunities for all its citizens. Appointing Kavanaugh would set the needle back on our progress towards Dr. King's dream. We must #SaveSCOTUS to protect our rights and freedoms.
If confirmed, Kavanaugh will seek to undermine the #AffordableCareAct, putting millions of lives at risk. Trump &amp; the GOP are losing their battle to destroy our health care system in Congress so now they want to use #SCOTUS to do their bidding.  We must #SaveSCOTUS #StopKavanaugh
NAN fights for ONE standard of liberty and justice for ALL people. #Kavanaugh has shown that he only promotes justice for SOME people. If Kavanaugh is confirmed #SCOTUS would reverse hard-fought wins for workers, consumers, women, and healthcare. #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
Over the last two decades NAN has been in the vanguard of the movement to bring equality to every community that has been unfairly treated. Brett #Kavanaugh threatens the rights of marginalized communities and we will not let injustice win. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh
NAN holds leaders accountable for their actions, regardless of their position in government. Kavanaugh does not.  He believes the POTUS is above the law &amp; should never be indicted while in office. He would NOT be the necessary check on the executive branch. #WhatsAtStake
#SCOTUS is the last line of defense for our civil and human rights. The next #SCOTUS justice MUST be fair-minded and must value equality and justice for ALL. #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
For years, NAN has fought for policy and legislative change in situations where the government has failed to serve the best interest of its citizens. Today, we continue that fight as we push to #StopKavanaugh from rolling back the rights of millions. #SaveSCOTUS
Last night, National Action Network led a demonstration in civil disobedience in response to Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. We will not stop our fight to #StopKavanaugh and #SaveSCOTUS.

A hungry child cannot concentrate, cannot focus, cannot learn. Roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to meals at school because of partisan #GOPFarmBill. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAP
#GOPFarmBill will harm grandparents, victims of domestic violence, and families that need help collecting child support. We need to protect them and #ProtectSNAP. #HandsOffSNAP
GOPFarmBill cruelly removes hundreds of thousands from #SNAP &amp; forces millions more to struggle to put food on the table. What happened to ‚ÄúLove thy neighbor?‚Äù #NoHouseFarmBill #HandsOffSNAP
Children on #SNAP are more likely to graduate, break the cycle of poverty, and contribute to a productive and efficient economy in the future. ‚ÄúAnd a child shall lead.‚Äù #NoHouseFarmBill #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAP

Until police can see that there is a penalty for taking lives beyond the line of the law, they will not feel that their actions will be held vulnerable. How can congress provide oversight and enforce police accountability? @OfficialCBC #CBCDemandsJustice
Police brutality and the lack of police accountability is not a local issue. From Ferguson, to Baton Rouge, to Sacramento to New York, this is a national issue and needs to be addressed with legislation at the federal level. #CBCDemandsJustice
How do we address lack of police accountability in the face of despite overwhelming evidence?
.@OfficialCBC One of the main factors in Police Brutality is that police are not held accountable. Police are to enforce the law, they are not above the law. Police officers who kill innocent people must be held accountable like anyone who breaks the law.
.@OfficialCBC What legislation on police accountability is currently available for civil society organizations to support?

As of today, over 12,000 #DACA recipients have lost their status. Even more lives are at stake. Every day, 122 more lose their status. #Dreamers can‚Äôt afford to wait. Tell	Congress to pass the #DreamActNow.
The time for action is NOW! Call Congress today and urge them to pass a bipartisan clean #DreamActNow before they go home for the holidays. It is cruel and unnecessary to leave 800,000 immigrant youth in limbo.
#Dreamers should not be used as political bargaining chips. They are human beings and they deserve to stay in the country that is their home. Call Congress and tell them to take decisive action to protect these young people and pass a clean #DreamActNow.
Ending #DACA without a permanent solution for our country‚Äôs 800,000 #Dreamers will be absolutely devastating to our communities, our economy, and beyond that, our nation‚Äôs very soul. Contact Congress and tell them to pass a clean #DreamActNow.
Every day of inaction by Congress leads to 122 more #Dreamers losing their status. There‚Äôs no time to lose. Tell your elected officials to #ProtectDreamers and pass a clean #DreamActNow.
Congress must take decisive action immediately to prevent 800K Dreamers from being fired from their jobs, ripped out of classrooms, and deported to countries they have no memory of. Call NOW (888-778-6856). We can't wait any longer for a #DreamActNow.
When leaders like @SenateMajLdr or @SpeakerRyan tell Dreamers to wait until next year, they're telling them they'd rather see immigrant youth deported than stand up for what's right. Justice can't wait. We need the #DreamActNow.
More than 12K Dreamers have already lost their work permits and deportation protections since Trump ended DACA. Immigrant youth can't wait any longer. Call your members of Congress (888-778-6856) and demand they pass the #DreamActNow ‚Äì BEFORE the holidays.
Every member of Congress who claims to stand with Dreamers must demand that legislation to protect these incredible young people is passed before lawmakers go home for the holidays. #DreamActNow
No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here. Dreamers are #HereToStay and Congress must act NOW to protect them. #DreamActNow
Passage of the #DreamActNow is one of the civil rights community's highest priorities. We demand lawmakers stand on the right side of history and pass the #DreamAct immediately. #HereToStay

This #GOPTAXBILL is a reverse Robin Hood in reality. Steal from the poor, sick, hard working families, and downtrodden communities and give to the RICH. They'll give back in form of higher wages...wait no they just vote NO against that amendment.
The numbers don't lie.  Tax increases for millions of Americans  bill dressed up as a tax cuts do.  #GOPTAXBILL is a TAX increase on families, students, workers, minorities, and poor people. They can lie, fudge, and make hollow promises, FACTS ARE FACTS.
Hours before a vote on the #GOPTAXPLAN no one from the Sec. of Treasury down has  done a proper economic analysis. They are just HOPING AGAINST HOPE. It won't trigger a deficit. This bill is a FARCE!  Call Your Senator 202-224-3121 and wake them up.
