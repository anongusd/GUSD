Gillibrand isn’t running away from her conservative past in Iowa, but still prompts some uncomfortable questions.		@jaketapper: “If Trump’s immigration positions are racist, were they racist when you held some of those positions as well?”		https://t.co/da9x0bcDkM https://t.co/tKL6jeUOYo
On her debut visit to Iowa, Gillibrand reaches back to her House (rural) roots.		But she’s got a long way to go with name recognition. One voter asked me: “Where’s this gal from?”		https://t.co/da9x0bcDkM
Gillibrand/voter exchange: “What’s your opinion on automatic voter registration...”		“Looooove it.”		“Nonpartisan redistricting?”		“Looooooove it.”
Gillibrand: “I can work with anybody.” (Talking about Ted Cruz &amp; working with him on sexual harassment reform.)		Always triggering a big laugh, that Ted Cruz line.
Gillibrand tearing up &amp; choking up as she describes a New York woman who lost her two sons in Sandy. 		“We know what’s happening. Stop denying what’s happening.”
Gillibrand at her final event in Iowa on climate change: “When he stepped away from the climate accords in Paris, he showed a weakness.”		“I want to restore that leadership in the world.”
