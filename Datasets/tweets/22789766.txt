4/ ESP include paraeducators, custodians, bus drivers, clerical assistants, food service workers, security professionals, nurses, and more. They work both in and outside of the classroom to ensure that students reach their full potential. #WeLoveOurESP
3/ The National Teacher of the Year award has been celebrating our teachers since 1952 and now, we hope that we will be able to lift up our ESP in the same way.
2/ HR276 would create the RISE Award, an annual recognition through the Dep. of Ed that would put a national spotlight on the commitment and professionalism of ESP careers. #WeLoveOurESP
Great news! With a vote of 387-19, the House overwhelmingly passed HR276, a bill to honor education support professionals (ESP), who play an essential role in keeping students safe, challenged, engaged, supported, and healthy in our public schools and communities. #WeLoveOurESP

5/ Lastly, @SenJohnLarson introduced the #Secure2100 Act, which would #ExpandSocialSecurity, increase benefits, and ensure that our Social Security system remains solvent for generations. (End thread)
4/ The #PaycheckFairness Act was also introduced today, the 10 year anniversary of the @Lilly_Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The bill, sponsored by @PattyMurray &amp; @rosadelauro would help close the #wagegap, which disproportionately affects women of color.
3/ As @Lily_NEA said, “Every public school should reflect how much we value our students and educators. Too many students and educators have been forced to learn and teach in classrooms with leaky roofs, moldy carpets, asbestos and other health hazards.” #BuildSchoolsNotWalls https://t.co/AjzdTYo3Kr
2/ The Rebuild America’s Schools Act would invest $100 billion in America’s public schools. It's sponsored by @SenJackReed, @BobbyScott, and @DonaldNorcross. #BuildSchoolsNotWalls

Public schools have a purpose and a role to play not just for individual students, but for communities across the nation. It is the one thing over 90% of American students and families have in common. #PublicSchoolsWeek
Resourced neighborhood public schools that are desirable places to be and to learn are our best bet for ensuring every child has a great future ahead of them. #PublicSchoolsWeek
When schools are a hub of activity, students, families and the community benefit. Educational facilities are used more, neighborhoods are safer and residents are more aware of the services available to them. #PublicSchoolsWeek
Communities are stronger and schools are better when we all work together to support public education. #PublicSchoolsWeek #LovePublicEducation.

Bringing more guns into our schools does nothing to protect our students and educators from gun violence. Our students need more books, art and music programs, nurses and school counselors; they do not need more guns in their classrooms. #ArmMeWith https://t.co/LNkMlcWR1d

On April 20, please join the National Day of Action Against Gun Violence in Schools. We need your voice. Together, we will demand an end to #gunviolence in our schools.		Tell us what actions for #GunReformNow should look like in your community here:	https://t.co/y8YNNYzwKm
This reality is devastating. Our hearts may be breaking, but our resolve must be strong. It is time we say #enough is enough. We must demand action now to save lives from gun violence.
Schools should be the safest place a child can be, but that seems far from reality these days. From Columbine to Virginia Tech to Sandy Hook to Marshall County to #Parkland, it's abundantly clear we are not doing enough to protect our students and schools from #gunviolence.
Every community's response to this problem will be different, so we want to know -- what do you want your community's action to look like on April 20? How will you take action against #gunviolence in schools?	https://t.co/y8YNNYzwKm

For generations, unions have been the best path to the middle class for working people, especially people of color and women.
