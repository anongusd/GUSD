Protest Obama's Criminal Negligence in Benghazi NOW! http://t.co/lkvBRAQR #MADASHECC #TCOT
@SpringsAlliance No worries.  :-)
@SpringsAlliance I guess it's more acurte to say it's not SOLELY a relig issue. Of crse, religion plays a part, but can be argued w/out it.
@SpringsAlliance I'm happy to hear them...and have this discussion.
@SpringsAlliance But you're making it a religious thing...it isn't. http://t.co/tPqI0UVD
@SpringsAlliance I've not brought religion into it once. I'm talking about history and documented evidence.
@SpringsAlliance Once again, we're talking about actual studies...not opinions. They don't have the studies. There are tons on marriage.
@SpringsAlliance Yes, but there is no evidence to support it being a benefit to society.
@SpringsAlliance But that's an attitude, not a result.
@SpringsAlliance Whichever one you want to give an example for.
@SpringsAlliance Such as?
@SpringsAlliance You don't have to agree, I don't mind. But there is thousands of years of history to back me up.
@SpringsAlliance On a gov't level, it's about promoting the strength of society. Man/woman marriage does that, so gov't promotes it.
@SpringsAlliance I didn't. I took ur premise &amp; turned it into reality.If you make mrg about love, u get all kinds of bad examples come true.
@SpringsAlliance Marriage is not about love, if it was you wouldn't find that scenario so distasteful.
@SpringsAlliance You brought up the "love" issue...see where that slippery slope will get you?
@SpringsAlliance Why is it a stretch? What's the difference? Why is it wrong for a mother to marry her son...if they really love each other?
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz Only 140 characters. I'm talking about a nonchalant view of marriage...that it doesn't matter.
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz I guess by your standards though, a mother can marry her son if "they both love each other" enough right?
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz Doesn't work that way. When there are no limits on marriage, it has the same effect of not having marriage at all.
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz There are countless studies pointing to the benefits marriage has on society. And how poorly soc's do w/out it.
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz When taking society as a whole, it does.
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz Your patents divorced, you choose not to marry, what will your kids decide? Marriage strengthens society. It's a fact
@SpringsAlliance @bzaz It doesn't matter. It's sad no matter what that people no longer care to set examples of matrimony for their kids.
