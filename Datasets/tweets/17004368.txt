Many of these people in the caravan do have international protection needs. Many are fleeing violence at home. They're not "invaders" of the country. They're people who are seeking to invoke the law of the U.S., which they are entitled to do by requesting asylum, says Aleinikoff.

"If you think of signing statements and the thousands of provisions of law that the Bush administration declared inapplicable to them, it was the unitary executive theory that supported that," says Prof. Neil Kinkopf. #ACSTalks
Prof. Kinkopf: "The unitary executive theory led to warrantless surveillance of domestic electronic communications despite the fact that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act forbid warrantless surveillance." #ACSTalks
The last time we saw the unitary executive theory, it was the driving theory behind all of the activities of the Bush administration. This theory led to the torture memo, to the idea that the law forbidding torture doesn‚Äôt apply to the President, says Kinkopf #ACSTalks

Kinkopf says that under the unitary executive theory, Trump could personally fire Mueller. 		And if Brett Kavanaugh were on the Supreme Court, he would be willing to uphold that action. #ACSTalks
Kinkopf: Under the unitary executive theory, the President would be able to quash a grand jury subpoena and could terminate ANY official in the executive branch, including Robert Mueller #ACSTalks
Kinkopf: Under the unitary executive theory, all executive power is vested in the President, which means the President could end the Mueller investigation #ACSTalks

ACS hosted a discussion of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, featuring Erwin Chemerinsky, @michelebgoodwin, and Ricki Seidman. Listen here: https://t.co/sKzlyk5PAx #WhatsAtStake
From ACS President @crfredrickson and @CREWcrew's @NormEisen:		Following his nomination to the Supreme Court, the Senate MUST determine if Kavanaugh has the requisite independence from President Trump to serve as a check on his abuses of power. https://t.co/aKnYrVYF7x
Ricki Seidman on what people can do about the #SCOTUS nomination: Everyone should be contacting their senators and making it clear that you're paying attention to their decisions. Senators need to understand that you're going to hold them accountable for how they vote. #ACSTalks
.@michelebgoodwin: We're not just talking about abortion rights here. The attacks on contraception and Title 10 are also really vital for us to understand. #ACSTalks
Erwin Chemerinsky says that it's important to ask Kavanaugh questions such as how he would've voted in cases like Shelby County v. Holder #ACSTalks
Ricki Seidman: We know Kavanaugh's views, but it's important to hear directly from the nominee. #ACSTalks
Erwin Chemerinksy: Every major #SCOTUS decision that has expanded LGBT rights has had the majority opinion written by Justice Kennedy #ACSTalks
.@crfredrickson: The courts have enormous power over our lives. The right has taken that very seriously, and it's time that progressives elevate the courts to the same level. #ACSTalks
Ricki Seidman on the "Ginsburg rule": The standard is not Ginsburg. The standard should be Kennedy. #ACSTalks
Ricki Seidman on Kavanaugh's #SCOTUS nomination: I think anyone who is on Leonard Leo's list passed the litmus test. Trump didn't have to ask the questions, they were already asked. #ACSTalks
Erwin Chemerinksy: The idea that #SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh's views "don't matter" is nonsense. It's appropriate for the Senate to ask him how he would have voted in previous cases. #ACSTalks
Erwin Chemerinsky: We know most of all that Brett Kavanaugh has been very pro-business. He's repeatedly ruled against environmental regulations. #ACSTalks
@GeorgiaStateACS @michelebgoodwin Yes it will be! We will have the link up shortly after the call concludes.

Paul Smith on Gill: Justice Kagan offered guidance for upcoming cases on partisan #gerrymandering to pin argument to First Amendment freedom of association, rather than vote dilution.
@campaignlegal's Paul Smith on Gill and Benisek challenges: The cases avoided addressing partisan #gerrymandering.
