@Bembezi @AndrewCastle63 Hi loutish behaviour was almost every match. He was known for it. Yet the Criticism and backlash Serena is receive for one incident appears disproportional.

@AndrewCastle63 It’s quite sad that the umpire’s are contemplating boycotting her game. When McEnroe was throwing his regular tantrums did umpires think about boycotting his games? Players challenging umpires decisions has been going on well before Serena.
@SheriffClarke Remember John McEnroe?
RT @SheriffClarke: Serena is a GREAT tennis champion. Losing SUCKS but she’s still has an obligation to BEHAVE APPROPRIATELY. She BULLIED t…

@SheriffClarke @CNN Sheriff Clarke, I sometimes wonder whether you are black or if you have a very good tan. You seem to despise everything that is of colour. You remind me of the character played by Samuel L Jackson in Django. Coon forever.
@AnnCoulter Not even worth a reply. Sad!!!
@TomiLahren Tomi..wipe that brown stuff from your mouth! Yes you talk shit!!!
@itvnews Great news...
@JoeJenk33482304 @brandongroeny Ahh well.. I guess even the devil has supporters. Insecure, small minded, delusional.

@Nigel_Farage @theresa_may Mr Farage you really need to understand your history.
Power!!!! WTF
@KTHopkins @Julias_Malema You either have a short term memory or you really don’t know your history. Or you choose not to acknowledge historical wrongs
Omarosa we see straight through you. Fancy language and a bible doesn’t hide who you really are. Self-serving, conniving and deceitful.
