@Penny_kins Thanks Penny. My Year 9s love puzzles like this but I need to do it first...am sitting here getting stuck already. (Yes I know #learningtogether is a Coll value but #teacherhasgotittogether is also good occasionally. )
Finally, 5 weeks into term, the first of hopefully many quick videos for my Year 9s.  Might run a sweepstake on how long till the first silly comment appears...will it be Yeet? Or yo? Or Hi Miss?  https://t.co/bVDxreVq2X

@Sarah_StatsAko 80s song will be revealed on Friday, in case any geek Year 13s are lurking and desperate to work out the topic a day early.
Aaaand...first Level 3 stats internal assessment task of the year written with 37 hours to go before deadline.  Comes complete with cheesy 80s pop song.
@DrIandeTerte @WC_Principal It's lower than in 2017 when we managed to get 135. But we're still really pleased with 108, including your son's two! About to start preparing for 2019...
@NZScienceLearn @VicUniWgtn @royalsocietynz @thatmathsshow @Headifen11 @MathsChatNZ Looking forward to it - got 5 tickets for the second one, just have to choose a carload of boys to come and hear him.

@Penny_kins Yeah really. The coffee incident was like watching a bad movie in slow motion. There were even tears.  I am never having coffee near important stuff on my desk again till next week at least.  (To his credit F did not say "I blame my mum and you know her by the way")
Such a good day today. Coffee spilled all over two lovely Scholarship calculus papers (dried with hairdrier in staff bathroom) and dire state of son's uniform due to mother's laundry ineptitude gets discovered by Principal at 3.15!  Bring on the weekend...

@aim2bgreat And now I'm the rat in the cheese trap. Got to go email my year 9 parents and mark an A level test!
@aim2bgreat Ha ha - 99%, 90%, whatever.  As I have said before, VERY hard to measure performance in a way that does not screw up incentives to teach well and to work hard for all our learners. And you know I can do economics and get incentives.
@aim2bgreat I don't think you read the part where I said we will have to agree to disagree.
@MthreeGee Very careful reading of the Calendar regs. Did finance instead of accounting as well (then wished I had done accy too as soon as I got to investment banking). This was pre-BCA core!! Squeezed in German and maths... but we are talking about 1988 when you were at preschool!
@MthreeGee Oh dear must not read the comments but there are 111 of them and I can't not. "Even in my day, the students opting for teaching tended to be C-plus students who couldn't make it in professions like law or engineering or medicine etc." Aaahaha maybe I should do an ad for the MOE?!
@MthreeGee I think she writes a marketing column in the DomPost. [Interesting fact: my BCA(Hons) contained no marketing papers.]
@aim2bgreat Yep that'd be 99% of teachers then. We have had this discussion about performance pay before and I think we need to agree to disagree.  (I'm too tired after a day of teaching ha ha).But either way, more marketing is not useful!
Really should not have read this before coffee kicked in. Article claims a rebrand will fix our recruitment crisis. Just spend more on marketing and everyone stop being negative, then there will be hundreds more applicants. https://t.co/m47ntfyCt9
@DrDreHistorian @tysonretz Just caught up on this (have been off Twitter for a few weeks) and really glad you are all right now and that you were in Norway when it happened. Asthma is horrible.
@evelyn_a_smith No worries - it's 8 years since I switched from uni to school teaching now but a lot of it is very similar, only your students are a wee bit more mature!
@evelyn_a_smith @Screencastify You will have crap lessons where you wonder what went wrong but if the students see that you've got their back, love teaching and put effort into it, they will work harder and enjoy learning. And it is fine not to know things sometimes and say you'll investigate.
@evelyn_a_smith @Screencastify You will feel **really** selfconscious at first (well I did!) about how awful you sound. Keep going. Weaker students AND stronger students feel really supported with easy and hard questions done like this. And they're done for next time you teach!
@evelyn_a_smith If you've got a tablet, it's really easy to use @Screencastify (free) or similar to record you working through examples. Can put link onto your intranet, email it, or just chuck it onto Youtube e,g, https://t.co/5G7DuKiKRC (one of mine).
@evelyn_a_smith Post the worked solutions to Blackboard/Google Classroom/whatever intranet UMich uses. Encourage students to work through these together (and make it clear that you really will help in your office hours!).  Put little notes in the solutions about *why* you're doing tricky steps
@evelyn_a_smith For the math-phobic students, you need a blend of real world context (love the bringing graphs/newspaper articles idea) but there is no avoiding mastering the math skills. Do tons of fully worked examples.
@evelyn_a_smith Tell them a bit about yourself and how you ended up in economics. What are your hopes for the course? Talk openly about the level of maths needed and how you will support them. Try to build a culture of no question being a stupid one.
@evelyn_a_smith Lots of ways to build strong relationships.  Use a Google Form  to do a questionnaire  - who are they? Ask them about how they feel about calculus, what worked for them in the prerequisite econ and calc courses? What do they most want from you?  Why are they taking the course?
@evelyn_a_smith That's a nice number. You'll be able to get to know all of them.  My teaching philosophy basically chunks into 3 bits: 1) strong relationships with students 2) showing that you are passionate about your subject 3) having high expectations for their behaviour and learning.
@evelyn_a_smith Hi Evelyn. I have tons of ideas and agree with all the great advice you're already getting. How many students roughly? I used to teach econ at college, but now teach maths at high school in NZ. Do you have TAs to run the sections or are you doing them?
@ta_hughson @CathieBell Wow. That's cool. But I need a Twitter emoji for "I am feeling really old right now". Maybe a little cave with a cavewoman...
@ta_hughson @VicUniWgtn @CathieBell So funny reading this. How'd you find it?!  I remember it was one of my first Council meetings where Hugo Manson put forward his proposal. Very different from last year's one. Students opposed (and I think everyone else too). Love Margaret Clark saying the idea was "quite barmy".

@aim2bgreat @ThomasHaig If you look at schools around Wgtn they‚Äôll already have quite different balances of MUs and MMAs and jobs that get rewarded depending on community needs. There‚Äôs scope for differentiation in current model.
@aim2bgreat @ThomasHaig Yeah, some of that stuff does get rewarded. There are management allowances and management units for those things that allow recognition. And the communities of learning, specialist classroom teacher role etc are trying to do some of that stuff.
@ThomasHaig @aim2bgreat Wash your mouth out Tom!!!
@ThomasHaig @aim2bgreat Do I get extra credit for being a former investment banker used to extremely individualised performance pay who is not in principle opposed to individual contracts?
@aim2bgreat @ThomasHaig Have changed my mind on this since I started 6 years ago and I've thought about it a lot. Just cannot see how to make it work.
@aim2bgreat @ThomasHaig Could I find a valid baseline test? I don't think so. PATs are one option but even when I've done well with struggling kids, sometimes their PAT will barely move. Other times it'll move 2 stanines. And performance pay done badly is a recipe for divisiveness in departments.  Ugh.
@aim2bgreat @ThomasHaig So much of what I do is not measured by student results. If you look at my Year 10s, the class I am most proud of (on a good day), it is *extremely* hard to measure teacher value add. Incentivises teaching to the test at the expense of a lot of other stuff.
@aim2bgreat @ThomasHaig Chris, I really don't think performance pay works in secondary teaching.  Destroys collaboration and extremely hard to make it work. Retention allowances for some subjects, yes. But direct negotiation with principal I just can't imagine.

@ThomasHaig The MoE Salary Assessment process to look at prior work saw me get minimal recognition for lecturing at university,but some recognition for investment banking experience (go figure - actually both careers involve getting people to do things they are not that keen on doing...)
@ThomasHaig I hope the government is going to pay attention to the bureaucratic hurdles put in the way of new teachers. In 2013 when I retrained at Vic, I had to spend around $700 to get NZQA to decide if my Yale masters qualified as a Masters Degree.  (They said it was ok.)
@ThomasHaig And that's after a big wave in Term 3 already.  There's no one reason for them but unless there is a significant pay jolt, retention and recruitment are going to get even worse.

@drdeanknight @GeoffMcLay1 We‚Äôve got three universities in the family that have emotional links. Wouldn‚Äôt dream of giving Yale a cent but the one north of here is starting to look better. Arrogance sometimes has real costs.
@drdeanknight @GeoffMcLay1 Yeah I think the costs are being understated. Very surprised the Foundation is supporting this. Got a letter a few weeks back. This process isn‚Äôt making us more likely to donate. Doubt I‚Äôm the only alumna thinking like that...(but also not exactly a high wealth target!!)
@drdeanknight @GeoffMcLay1 You‚Äôll have a better feel for that than I do.
@drdeanknight @GeoffMcLay1 Sorry, been teaching so silence here. Yep, I get the argument, but pretty speculative isn‚Äôt it? And needs to be offset by loss of recognition of current name. It probably also will vary by subject depending on strength of research.
@GeoffMcLay1 And if it wasn‚Äôt a big part of the case why did they spend $118 900 on it?
Got a response from @VicUniWgtn to my OIA request. The Colmar Brunton reports cost $118,900. Great use of public funds. #stickwithvic @grantrobertson1 @chrishipkins
@GeoffMcLay1 There are a lot of very able statisticians at Vic and I know the margin of error stats will be slightly off. Perhaps the VC could ask the Stats Consulting team to explain how this all shows a strong case. I'm not seeing it.
@GeoffMcLay1 Buuuuutttt..... CB say in the footnotes that the sample size here is only 200.  That means the margin of error goes WAY up.  To about 6 percentage points! (I make it slightly over).  So now, the Vic % could be as much as 37.6%, and the UoW as low 28.3%.
@GeoffMcLay1 This one is not flash for the Vice Chancellor's case, I don't think.  The report says that Chinese and Indian students are the markets where we should see the biggest reaction (paraphrasing the 2nd report).  Look at the China bar.  Looks good! Vic on 31.6%, Uni of Wgtn on 35.3% https://t.co/34227FcDHY

@DrDreHistorian @GeoffMcLay1 Yeah. There‚Äôs some great stuff in here but it‚Äôs buried and it‚Äôs hard to tweet about. Plus my maths teacher followers probably think I‚Äôm insane.
@GeoffMcLay1 If I had questions, and they weren't in those prospectuses, I just had to imagine the answers. I had no clue about so many things till I got there. There was no email. Things are really, really different now.
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf In 1991 when I was looking at uni in the States, hard copies of all grad school info was kept in a weird library in town called the US Information Service. I loved that place. I wrote letters to get sent  prospectuses from economics departments. They wrote back.I got mail!
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf This one is about the agents who help recruit.  They don't think the name is confusing anyone. The whole story isn't stacking up to me.  I spend all day teaching kids, and separating them from their phones can be interesting. Google is one of their best friends. https://t.co/G6VVVkgrDj
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf You can go through a bunch of the bar charts like this but before I do I want to chuck in a couple of the comments early in the CB report.There's also an interesting Kiwiblog post today here https://t.co/9uKQMXez6e where DPF talks about how he`d have designed the research.
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf Now we form the confidence intervals. The Vic green bar goes up as high as 27.4% (25 + 2.4) and the UoW one comes down as low as 29-2.3 = 26.7%.  They overlap. It's perfectly plausible that there is  really no difference, or that the Vic green bar in the population is higher.
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf My calculations (and my Year 13s' tomorrow morning...) give me a MOE for the Vic 25% of 2.4 percentage points.  For the Uni of Wgtn one, I get 2.3 percentage points. Again, CB might use a fancier methodology but this'll be close I think.
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf Now we put in the margin of error. (We also teach all our Level 3 students that whenever they see a claim, they must look for a margin of error.  Pretty basic, and as you'd expect from a good mkt research firm, CB have given us the sample size so that we can all work it out.)
@GeoffMcLay1 @dpfdpf So, if you look at the green bars for Victoria University of Wellington and University of Wellington, Vic one is only 25% and the U of W is 29%.  Looks good for GG! (Um, except for all other reasons in CB rpt, like potential stdts care about name only at start of process).
@GeoffMcLay1 Here's an example.  I'll put the slide in first then do the confidence intervals. Colmar Brunton may have a slightly different formula but mine should be pretty close (I'm sure a Vic stats person can fix mine up...).  Or @dpfdpf perhaps. https://t.co/wGnsE1ILLc
@GeoffMcLay1 Overlaying all the of CB research though is their finding that the name just isn't a big deal.  This slide made me laugh.  Social life is more important in student decisions than the name.  It might be cheaper to subsidise O-Week a bit more. https://t.co/4EVN6mGNi3
@GeoffMcLay1 But, even where the CB research *does* manage to find a difference, the gap between one end of the confidence interval and the other is SMALL.  It might be "statistically significant" but the gap will be around 1 or 2 percentage points.  I'll put some examples in soon. (Honest)
@GeoffMcLay1 On top of that, even when they do manage to find a difference (ie the confidence intervals DON'T overlap) the size of that gap in confidence intervals is *very small*.  Small enough to make you wonder if it's worth it.
@GeoffMcLay1 That means we don't have enough evidence to conclude that, back in the population, as opposed to these particular 200 or 800 or 1400 potential international students in our sample, that the name really makes a difference.  (Any Level 3 stats students reading this - enjoy!!)
@GeoffMcLay1 Yep - as I said in a reply on another thread, the CM research looks fine.  It just does not show a strong case.  There are 2 issues: in most of the questions asked, the confidence intervals for the proportions being favourable to Vic and another option overlap.
@GeoffMcLay1 @NicolaWillisMP The first 4 minutes had me laughing till I cried (while cooking dinner - not good) but we can talk about teacher workload and pay under National another day. #stickwithvic @cjsbishop @grantrobertson1 @chipkins

@gwynncompton @simonbwilson @patrickgowernz From looking at the petition signatories and Facebook and Twitter comments it seems that Vic‚Äôs international alumni, including in the countries being marketed to by VUW, are pretty attached to the current name. Their influence not being picked up in the CB research.
@gwynncompton @simonbwilson @patrickgowernz And yes you can find slides in here where there is a gap in the confidence intervals but you have to look pretty hard.
@gwynncompton @simonbwilson @patrickgowernz This is one of the slides where 800 respondents looked at 5 options. And remember the new legal  name (from what I can tell anyway) isn‚Äôt going to have The in it. Even if it does have the,the confidence intervals overlap.
@gwynncompton @simonbwilson @patrickgowernz I‚Äôm not disagreeing with the Colmar Brunton report (some comments elsewhere that their margins of error are wrong - I‚Äôm sure they are not!)

@boutela  No, just remembering how great it was!  Sticking to Europe - got too much to squeeze in here before end of next year.
@boutela  You sure it's not a hangover from too many nights out in New York?  Need a list of good restaurants and bars visited...
@boutela It's meant to cancel out.  Yep, old age.  Drink gallons of water...
@1littlebird  Fine once you're on it, but the merging is much ickier than at home.  And I wimped out and went back to bed!!!
Am having a coffee then - after 10 months of avoiding it - going for a hoon on the Basel motorway.  How busy can it be at 6.30 a m Sunday?
#fridayreads Just finished the excellent Septembers of Shiraz. Now looking at the piles of unread books choosing the next one...

New school rule: school photo ID cards now required for parents.  Not just school ID cards. Basel is so full of security risks, you know.
@FlossieTeacake I just had a nice but rained-in Milchkaffee. Pouring here and feels like has been for 3 weeks! (just when parents here...)
@1littlebird did you decide that pinot noir goes with pizza?  (I think it goes with anything...esp at bedtime for naughty kids.)
@FlossieTeacake Late, but am sure you haven't read all your Canadian suggestions yet - Colony of Unrequited Dreams by Wayne Johnston.

@librarythingtim, happy 4th birthday and thanks for creating such a brilliant website and community!
RT @nytimesbooks Essay: Reading by the Numbers http://bit.ly/18PEw3 	Ugh, hope New Zealand keeps away from this crap.
Why doesn't NZ have a **good** Sunday paper?  SaturdayDomPost will have to do...missing the New York Times right now.  And real bagels.
Pareting at 5.30 a, is m,ore fun with twitter.  Feels like I'm not the only person awake in Wellington... need coffee.

Earthquake? What earthquake?
doing tax ret and having aggrieved student explain complex numbers and saying "universities are supposed to embrace higher learning". Sigh.

@FlossieTeacake Have any of your other 800+ followers mentioned that "FlossieTeacake" uses up 10% of every tweet to you?!
@FlossieTeacake eek, hope you aren't there too long... and coffee ok. Is it the fractured wrist? (saw LT but lurking till head above H20)
argh, #Librarything is down, argh, argh.  Will have to read instead.  Or read to kids. Or something.
going to bed... need to get over my Biotronic addiction before I waste even more of my life.
2 tests to write, 1 lecture, 1 tut.  Suggestions on explaining limits to reluctant students most welcome. Head banging quite therapeutic.
@mmerry10 I'm pretty hopeless over here!! Was just trying to find your thread on LT but forgot you were in the 100 club...
I suppose 5.30 am is better than 4.14, but still early enough to need IV coffee...
@FlossieTeacake thanks!
Why does Teresa insist on picking the sappiest books at bedtime?  Angelina's Birthday Party - ugh!!  But at least we're down from 8 to 2.
Ok... I'm trying to do this from my phone. Did anyone get this?
@FlossieTeacake that sounds great!  ooh, have just worked out the @ thing, very cool.  and found your old @message from 2 weeks ago.

The $10,000 gas bill is nearly sorted out... moral of story: bypass call centre next time, ring corporate office, mention DominionPost.
How do I send twitter updates from my phone?  Off to Napier tomorrow to convince 17 year olds about commerce at Vic...eek, mouse in kitchen.
Why is eating pink yoghurt with your hands so appealing when you're 2 years old?
Now I get why twitter is addictive...meant to be writing lecture notes but am hitting F5 to read about R Worth.  NBR website is interesting!
OK, the kids are asleep and I'm spending my evening reading FTAlphaville archives.  I think that's bad. I could be playing Hexic instead...
How do 2 kids generate so much crap?  @boutela, thanks for the train update, which arrived at 11.30 pm...have just fixed twitter settings!
