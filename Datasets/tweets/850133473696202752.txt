@Lulu1967 @wellsfamilyblue @JesusGraces How embarrassing.  You haven't read your bible.  God did kill  the firstborns after hardening the pharaoh's heart so that he would not let "his people" go free.  It is quite embarrassing that you don't know your own bible.  And what about the flood, do you think that was moral?
@Lulu1967 @wellsfamilyblue @JesusGraces But he did destroy entire tribes and interfered greatly in our lives like when he killed the babies in Egypt.  The bible is a horrid collection of torture-porn that is not suitable for anyone to read, let alone a child.  Inherently immoral...slavery, genocide, murder, rape, etc.
@Lulu1967 @wellsfamilyblue @JesusGraces So if I understand you correctly, you believe that it is immoral now, but not immoral then?  That's a pretty immoral position.  Please clarify.
@Lulu1967 @wellsfamilyblue @JesusGraces I believe that slavery, rape, murder and genocide (all condoned or commanded by God) are, and have always been immoral. And just like that, I am more moral than the God of the bible.
@Lulu1967 @wellsfamilyblue @JesusGraces Forget about them.  Do YOU believe that it is moral to impregnate a child that young?
@Lulu1967 @wellsfamilyblue @JesusGraces Theologian experts estimate that Mary was between 10 and 14 years old when impregnated.  Aside from the adultery that God committed, that is pedophelia. https://t.co/wNEM5sAxGN

@CommonPlebe @EngageTheRebels There r 3 religions responsible 4 ALL terrorism n the world-Christianity-Judaism-Islam. If y u want to ban Muslims, u must also ban jews
@JoAnnBowdenUSA @EngageTheRebels You are a bigoted xenophobe. Please piss off!
@CommonPlebe @EngageTheRebels If ur going to ban entire religions because they have produced terrorists, you have to also ban christians and jews. what's wrong with that?

@Spence2345 @JamAndStomp_6G @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic Well it sounds like you've got a cause and a following. Start a grassroots movement and run with it. It's still #FakeOutrage by #snowflakes
@Spence2345 @JamAndStomp_6G @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic The article is what was offered as proof when I complained that the meme was unsupported-How can it be irrelevant? It fact checked the meme.
@greggyegg @Spence2345 @DemocratsLogic If you'll go back and look at the article it said the meme was only half true. Who is splitting hairs. Read the fucking article.
@Spence2345 @JamAndStomp_6G @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic I didn't make the rules, and neither did Bernie. You're just looking for a deceptive way to disparage someone you don't like with this lie.
@Spence2345 @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic The article say he pays STAFF Interns 12/hr, that is false-His Intern aides brought n by the Senate (not Bernie) for all Senators make 12/hr
@JamAndStomp_6G @Spence2345 @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic They are compensated through educational credits toward their degree. I didn't make the rules.
@realDonaldTrump Did you forget that Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering with the elections? What have YOU done? https://t.co/56Jn3sq5AC
@Aosc2 @DemocratsLogic Not the same-Interns are exempt of min wage often not paid at all as they are compensated thru their educational credits-Misleading @ best
@Aosc2 @DemocratsLogic To interns-They are exempt of minimum wage &amp; often receive no pay @ all because it is part of their education-Snopes stated so if u read it.
@realDonaldTrump Why have you done nothing about it since taking office is the more important question?
@Spence2345 @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic It doesn't apply to interns.
@Spence2345 @greggyegg @DemocratsLogic Interns r not bound 2 the minimum wage, hence the fact that many receive no pay at all, it's education-Sorry, desperate attempt @ fake news.
@greggyegg @DemocratsLogic They were intern aides not staff hired by Bernie Sanders. Interns often make no wage as it's part of their education-Very misleading at best
@Aosc2 @DemocratsLogic Got from another, thanks though. Just as I suspected the meme is an out-right lie. Cheers,

@DeliliaOMalley @GOP Now you claim to not be a christian
@DeliliaOMalley @GOP bc u resorted to christian dishonesty. U started by defending christianity by claiming a terrorist wasn't a true christian, now u say ur not
@DeliliaOMalley @GOP Now ur just being dishonest-This whole thread started bc u claimed someone wasn't a "real" christian. Now you deny that you are a christian.
@stemmcreative That's usually all it takes to drive christians away, just ask them for evidence and it's ... crickets...lol
@stemmcreative You want to get Jesus trending right? Why should I believe?
@stemmcreative So you can't think without your god...that's sad. I see, your religion is self-deprecating. Why do you believe in god? Simple question.
@stemmcreative By that last sentence I have a pretty good idea-U do realize that atheists also don't believe in satan, right? Why do you believe in God?
@stemmcreative I literally have no idea what you're trying to say. Some kind of insult I'm sure. Please try again https://t.co/0euHKOOUYQ
@stemmcreative I was once a believer, and a lot more knowledgeable than you. But do you think the information isn't available to those who don't believe?
@stemmcreative How do you know what I know about religion/christianity? So far I know a lot more than you.
@DeliliaOMalley @GOP U don't have 2 go after me I'm just stating facts that u can't accept-Ur the 1 who believes in fairy tales. If facts were boats, you'd sink.
@DeliliaOMalley @GOP It's only a matter of time. Theists have no evidence of their gods and ultimately religion will be exposed for what it is...fantasy.
@Cindyroonkink @Finkie711 @RedTRaccoon @KevinDarryl They all voted for #Trumpcare while exempting themselves and giving huge tax credits to the wealthy #Hypocrisy https://t.co/J9zYUt5kDe

@DeliliaOMalley @GOP I think u would agree, when the Muslims said that about their terrorists, it wasn't acceptable-Some would argue they follow closest to bible
@DeliliaOMalley @GOP Except that he said: "Doggart saw himself as a religious "warrior" and wanted to kill Muslims to show his commitment to his Christian god."

@jsbach2008 @aigkenham Yes, man sinned which God knew would happen so he created loophole, blood sacrifice to get around his own rule that he could hav jst changed
@jsbach2008 @aigkenham Correct, again according to most christian beliefs anyhow. I get it the whole trinity thing. How is that you know your religion is correct?
@jsbach2008 @aigkenham Yes, even some that were interpreted (by man) from dead languages that weren't spoken for centuries. Unreliable at best.
@jsbach2008 @aigkenham Wrong
@jsbach2008 @aigkenham Oh, so now you've shifted to the fallacy of an argument from authority. Authority does not equal truth. Don't you care about truth?

@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Because we have a judicial branch of government. He didn't include Saudi Arabia where 14 of the 19 attackers on 9/11 were from. Hmmm...
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii I am talking about their religion. The protesters are attacking the people. Are you slow?
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Protester should stop using religion as their crutch to hate people. They should just say they're assholes. We'd understand
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii It's like #Trumps Travel Ban. It is designed to single out an entire religion. I don't like bullies, or #snowflakes
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii So?f
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Triggered?
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii You (once again) just fell 2 the bottom of the pyramid-If you want to be taken seriously, try to keep it above contradiction. see asshat.jpg https://t.co/tFKycChuMI
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii They r deceptively protesting a religion-I don't agree with that-Their religion may be shit, but they have the right 2 worship as they wish
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii U just don't get it. I can be against something and still respect their right to existence. If you were American, you would understand that
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Be careful what you say to people and don't offend. That's the secret for a #snowflake looking for a safe place
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii I respect their right 2 worship any god they wish-I say, you can worship a rock 4 all I care, just don't throw it at me-You're confused

@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii I am attacked daily for speaking out about my disgust with religion. Your point?
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii U said it was a protest against Sharia-You lied-It is clearly a protest against Islam. I don't believe in ostracising anyone for religion
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii I didn't say it was-U are endorsing the protest of a religion-While legal, it is offensive as it would be 4 a christian. Again, consequences
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Genocide, slavery, murder, blood sacrifice of humans. Really there is too much to list here
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Religion is the scourge of the planet. All terrorism comes from the three Abrahamic religions-Judaism, Christianity and Islam. All are evil
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Yep, you're a #snowflake
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii If I get caught
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii No, I speak out about christianity...watch-The christian bible is a horrid POS book not suitable 4 children &amp; inherently immoral. How's that
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii It depends, if you stand in my face and call me a liar, you have the right but I'll probably punch you. That's how consequences work.
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii Were they allowed to protest?
@angelinthepine @glennwa1 @thro_e @Warx2TheMovie @Corrynmb I'm having a hard time believing that christians are oppressed in America. Comical is what it is. https://t.co/1EokMGIu2N
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii It's not, but it doesn't come without consequences. Get over it #Snowflake
@master_mind_51 @mitchellvii How can you protest a religion? Are you American?
@glennwa1 U said that 4 times &amp; asked 4 a RT-U really think it's worth a RT? U didn't even rebut the article with ur counter argument. See Asshat.jpg https://t.co/QTEVng44rO

@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I am done with Lancienne. She is dishonest and immoral and trolling. She does not care about truth, only her own hateful version of it.
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE "Oh no!  Once again you have destroyed my facts with your knowledge of the scriptures!"	   ...Said Nobody Ever
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Aww, just Lancienne being intellectually dishonest again...upholding her narrow-christian belief. How most people admit they are wrong
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE The christian bible says same about nonbelievers throughout	Luke 19:27 Jesus orders those who don't accept him brought before him and slayed
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I'm an atheist. So what religion of mine is killing millions-U r an ignorant buffoon who brought this on self attacking a compassionate Sikh
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE But just not this Sikh in the picture?
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Sikhs are not Muslims and they don't practice a Sharia Law. You are so overwhelmed with hatred that you don't even care if you are truthful
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Were you home-schooled?
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Did you read the fucking verse: Whoever curses his father or mother must be put to death." r u seriously defending stoning children 2 death?
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE He believed (like you) that he was hating for god!
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Do u think stoning an errant child 2 death is harming them?	Mark 7:9-10 (Again Jesus criticizes the Jews 4 not killing disobedient children)
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Off-topic. Changing the subject is a dishonest way of avoiding questions that you can't answer. Just own up to the fact that you're a bigot. https://t.co/axMJf5gTtr
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Well you've got them all figured out don't you? Why am I not surprised to be arguing with an intolerant bigot on a thread about intolerance?
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE No, the subject was a counter protest by a Sikh to kick some intolerant ass. Which were are staying on topic.
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Okay, we've established that Lancienne is not a christian, and I'm guessing not a Muslim. I wonder what religion she does admit to?
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE BTW: I have worked with Sikhs and they are very nice people. Honest, unlike christians.
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE She forgot what she was originally hating on BWAHAHAHAHA!!!

@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE U need 2 read a book &amp; learn what a religion is. Your attempts 2 demonize me 2 further ur ridiculous argument is as transparent as glass.
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE According to Jesus, the OT is relevant to christians today and always until everything is accomplished Matthew 5:17-18
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Show me the verse in the Quran that instructs Muslims to comitt terrorism. thanks,
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE If you don't follow Jesus' commandments, by definition you are not a christian. He is the namesake of the religion.
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Why don't you follow Jesus' teachings?
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I don't believe you, please show me your source
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I already told you that I'm not a communist, but you have no argument if you can't demonize your opponent. Pathetic Christian dishonesty!
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE religion and ideologies are two different things. They are not the same. Pick up a book FFS
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE If I lose this argument then u lose ur argument against Muslims-Show me the scripture in the Quran that tells Muslims to commit atrocities
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Yes christians do follow the OT. You don't! Jesus Christ himself said he did not come to change one iota of the law. Matthew 5:17
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Why don't you follow the word of Jesus. Is this a new religion that doesn't believe in Christ?
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Hey, what happened to you fidget. Weren't you going to defend your POS bible as well. CAt got your tongue?
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE SO I gave you an example of commanded violence in the NT and you disavowed the NT now. You are pathetic!
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I think you'll find she's just parroting what her bigoted friends and family say. LOL, she can't cite a verse.
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE So you cherry-pick to avoid the difficult scriptures to defend? BWAHAHAHA!!!
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE No my dear, you have failed and showed to not even be a true christian to the word of Jesus. You are morally broke just like your POS bible.
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE So you're not christian?
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE The ten commandments
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE How about when Jesus said to kill non-believers? Does that work? Luke 19:27
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE U have dishonestly narrowed ur scope that you'll accept-U claim 2 b christian but don't follow Jesus' commandments-You r dishonest &amp; immoral
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE R u ignorant or just stubborn. I don't know of anyone who denies that the KKK vow 2 uphold Christian morality-Which of course is an oxymoron
@TruthFinderCKM @xyzgyrl @mitchellvii Oh, so he did create a world w/o evil and humans screwed it up. Then he failed and did not create a world without sin. He must be incapable https://t.co/6OFsSmxZ0X
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Have you never read in the christian bible how women r mistreated? Try Deuteronomy 22:28-29 where women are commanded to marry their rapist
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I do not support Sharia, nor christian infiltration into our government. But I'm not afraid of Al-Qaeda, I'm afraid of Al-Cracker.
@LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE The christian bible is just as vile-Don't U know the Quran is also based on the old testament &amp; was started by Ishmael, Abraham's 1st son.
@TruthFinderCKM @xyzgyrl @mitchellvii Oh, into the light wants to play now. Answer me this wise one. Is your god capable of creating a world without evil?
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Uh, yes they do https://t.co/PXHwPT5BWQ
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE !) You brought up communism, not me and 2) I also defend marriage equality, does that mean that I am gay?
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE We're not comparing communism to religion. You have been showed more than once that communism is NOT a religion. How thick is that bubble?
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE What does that have to do with Religious Terrorism? And why don't you follow Jesus' commandments?
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE So it's confirmed. L'ancienne Cour is not a christian as she doesn't obey Jesus and fidget midget is without ammo in a war of wits.
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE BTW: It's not a book that children should read. Not appropriate
@Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I think they've spent their last thread of morality trying to defend the indefensible. Cheers.
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I know it's hard for your pea-brain to comprehend that someone disagrees with your bigotry, but you better get used to it.
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Jesus didn't deny it and clearly said that you weren't to deny it either. Matthew 5:17	So you're not a Christian?
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Communism isn't a religion, look it up. &amp; I'm not communist; just another example of a dishonest christian lying to win an argument-pitiful!
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Another dishonest Christians putting words n someone's mouth 2 divert fr fact they don't have an argument. ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE ALSO REAL
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE YES THEY R! Read your fucking bible without throwing out the inconvenient parts-Christian terrorists also believe they are doing god's work
@nurumassage60 @LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Did u not read my words? ALL 3 ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS CAUSE TERRORISM-Judaism, Christianity &amp; Islam. You are dishonest to put words in my mouth
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE You are at the bottom of the pyramid. Please try to pull  it up if you want to be taken seriously. See asshat.jpg https://t.co/kmWVhOWO4I
@nurumassage60 @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE were were talking about religion not communism, not capitalism. Please try to stay on subject.
@nurumassage60 @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Exactly! and ALL Abrahamic religions. Could it be getting through.
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Your point is moot.
@nurumassage60 @LancienneCour @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Do u understand the definition of terrorist-He was not a terrorist, he was a dictator-You can't find 1 terrorist act that wasn't religious
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE U throw out the OT because it inconveniently orders genocide-yet you cherry-pick from OT to get 10 commandments. Dishonest christian agin
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE A wise man once said: 	You can't tune a fish, and you can't argue with a sick mind"
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE So then u believe like Jesus that children should b stoned 2 death 4 defying their parents? &amp; non-believers killed? Not immoral?
@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE U need 2 google christianity &amp; step out of ur bubble.Your god is an immoral POS not worthy of worship in the least and your bible proves it
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Murder is murder you fucking idiot!
@xyzgyrl @TruthFinderCKM @mitchellvii Good for you, now go read a book
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE It is dishonest bc u r trying 2 rationalize an immoral act of terrorism. It is immoral for the same reason. U r making excuses for murder.

@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Now I'm a communist-You're done-you have no rebuttal-Your putrid POS bible is inherently immoral &amp; ur doing backflips to try to justify it.
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Y r u changing the subject &amp; denying ur own bible? If OT doesn't count (bc it's inconvenient), then why is it still part of bible? JC didn't
@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Your religion slaughtered the ultimate lamb in a blood sacrifice. Or have you already forgotten who your religion is named after #doh
@nurumassage60 @Fieryreddragon @LancienneCour @mikebank56 @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Are you changing the subject or somehow trying to justify terrorism when it comes to Christians. That's intellectually dishonest and immoral

@LancienneCour @nurumassage60 @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE Not sure why you get to throw out the old testament and the ten commandments, but here are a few vile words from Jesus https://t.co/xvi1XufOfB

@LancienneCour @mikebank56 @Fieryreddragon @CBCalamity @IMPL0RABLE I'm sure that's what some Muslims would say about their terrorists. We can eliminate all terrorism by eradicating the 3 Abrahamic religions. https://t.co/6XiTfJse9m
