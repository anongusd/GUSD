If your kids get sick don't sit there praying for them. Get them life saving medical attention.
It is fair to say that people should pay for their own crimes. Begging a God to forgive you is pointless and infantile.
In 2019 if you cannot walk around safely as an open Atheist in your community then religion is holding back progress.
If you are struggling with your religion I would suggest that you probably need more help than I do. I am not a professional and I would not claim to be able to help you. If you need someone to talk to there are many good organizations out there and I would recommend reaching out
I have a kindle but it is quite frustrating trying to read. I have such a hard time remembering any details. It sucks having neurological problems. #nevergiveup
If you want to believe in the magical explanation then become a Theist. If you want to figure it out read scientific studies.
How I vote matters and if you want your 10% of my income it is your job to prove to me your an authority I really need in my life. I must tell you I feel very sorry for you as the task ahead of you is monumental.
My faith is zero	My fucks are zero
Never take anything I or anybody else says on the internet as absolute fact. Do your own research and find out what the verifiable scientific consensus is and there you will find your truth.    Imagine if everybody lived by that burden of proof.

I know I can't change facts no matter how much I'd like to. The facts are there are alot of faithful in the world and what they think and how they vote matters.
Low wage workers are close to being slaves and I guess its okay because the Bible condones slavery. #Sad
One of the biggest troubles with faith is that it allows people to survive all their lives being wrong and then it is touted as a virtue. it is disgusting
If you are a Christian who follows only Gods Law then does that mean you can own slaves? Perhaps torture is acceptable to you as well?

@neithskye wow that's something else. Thanks for sharing.
I am by no means suggesting that by watching online lectures you in fact become a genius. I know I am a low lifeform in the shadow of giants.
I never did go to college. Part of me thinks I wouldn't make it so it would be a waste of money. Thats why I am extremely grateful for schools that put free lectures on the internet. I gives good information to the lay people to understand our species consensus on what is true.
I don't know much about genetics but I find it fascinating
We are all alot like our parents who were alot like their parents who were alot like theirs and so on. I can definitely tell
I don't care if people think I'm crazy	I know I'm crazy	I do the best I can
I will respect you when you are respectable. https://t.co/pB79TZ5zWe
It is quite good to withhold respect from religious people without treating them badly otherwise.
I am greater than god for I am real.
If you don't feel a sense of ridiculousness when you pray perform rituals or otherwise try to cast some form of magic spell then you might have something wrong with you.
I really don't want magic spells cast on me when I am busy working out at the gym but even if that did happen I would feel more sorry for the assailant because they actually believe that it works. #WitchHunt #Atheist
I was flirting with being a Christian at one point in time. Then I heard a young earth creationist talk and realized that these people are full of shit.
Though you cannot prove that God does not exist a healthy mind can determine probabilities. If you think that a God is probable you might not really have all the facts quite comprehended. Leave those of us who have strong doubts alone,
