The constitution of MA served as a model for other states &amp; for the Federal Constitution itself. Though John Adams was not a member of the Constitutional Convention, as he was serving as America's minister to the UK at the time, his influence on the document was still profound.
It also contains a declaration of individual rights such as freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and trial by jury. This constitution was ratified by the state of Massachusetts in June of 1780 &amp; today remains the oldest written constitution in force anywhere in the world.
Throughout the autumn of 1779, #JohnAdams completed his draft of the Massachusetts state constitution, which included his ideas for a bicameral legislature, separation of executive, legislative, and judicial powers, and an independent judiciary.

But, as with the others memorialized with great monuments to their memories in our nation's capital, we have to consider the whole person. The incredible contributions Adams made to the United States vastly outweigh this error, grievous though it was. (4/4) #JohnAdams
Instead, he signed them. This decision played a major role in the defeat of Adams by Thomas Jefferson in the 1800 election. Does this reflect badly on Adams? You bet it does. He was a flawed human being like the rest of us and, in this case, made a terrible mistake. (3/4)
and made it illegal for newspapers to publish anything deemed "malicious" against the government. Though this legislation was not written by Adams (the laws were written by the Federalist allies of Alexander Hamilton in Congress), he could have chosen to veto the laws. (2/4)
Even great heroes have some black marks on their records. The blackest mark on the record of John Adams is surely the fact that he signed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which gave the President the right to unilaterally expel foreigners from the United States (1/4)

The Voice of the Revolution #JohnAdams should win the #FoundersFaceOff and everyone who votes should contact their Rep to tell them to #SupportHR1220 because this man earned a monument! https://t.co/XLbJy2LZGz

Let's make sure #JohnAdams gets the respect he deserves in this vote AND in DC, with a monument to honor all that he did for our country! #RememberTheLadies #FoundersFaceOff #FridayFeeling Vote here and contact your member of Congress to tell them to #SupportHR1220 https://t.co/dJdT9DexUY
The words of #JohnAdams are the best reminders that we need the House of Reps to pass HR 1220 and build a monument to him among his peers in DC! @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi #SupportHR1220 https://t.co/BnSyvYhXUm

Just another reason to honor #JohnAdams in the Capital he worked so hard to create. Bring HR 1220 up for a vote! @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi #ThursdayThoughts #SCOTUS #SupportHR1220 https://t.co/z0HhBszNVF
We are only slightly biased. #JohnAdams #SupportHR1220 https://t.co/hAwQc0LCFP
We will lead by example. To all Minnesota members of the House of Representatives: SUPPORT HR 1220! This must pass before time runs out! @RepTimWalz @RepJasonLewis @RepErikPaulsen @BettyMcCollum04 @keithellison @RepTomEmmer @collinpeterson @USRepRickNolan #JohnAdams
With the midterms, Congress will get little done. If HR 1220 doesn't pass by this year, we will have to start all over. It's critical that you contact your rep &amp; tell them that you support HR 1220 &amp; want it brought for a floor vote as soon as possible. https://t.co/xxbduBpG05
H.R. 1220 has cleared committee and is now awaiting a vote by the full House of Representatives. If it passes (and it will, if only it gets to the floor in time), it would go to the Senate and then to the White House for the President's signature. #JohnAdams (1/2)
Just looking around Twitter lately, it is amazing how often John Adams is quoted. His words have stuck with us through the years, if only HR 1220 were passed in the House of Reps, #JohnAdams could be honored beyond the internet. #SCOTUS #FirstAmendment #civility #TuesdayThoughts

Good God! What in hell are they waiting for?! https://t.co/XUPbbXfrCH We need help motivating our Congressmen to sponsor HR 1220! @GOPLeader @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SteveScalise @WhipHoyer #MondayMotivation #JohnAdams #ShouldntBeThisHard
Over 800 supporters have now connected on our Facebook page. If we all picked up the phone &amp; called our congressional representative to ask him or her to support HR 1220, it could have a real impact. Why not do it today? #JohnAdams @GOPLeader @NancyPelosi https://t.co/xxbduBpG05
We close out our series with words from David McCullough, Joseph Ellis, &amp; Senator Ted Kennedy. We have been close to a memorial before, now it is time to push #HR1220 over the top. https://t.co/N7Ce3Bcy4h #MondayMotivation #JohnAdams @GOPLeader @NancyPelosi Need more cosponsors!
Where is Adams Memorial? #4WordStoryOfMyLife That's the question our series this week is all about: https://t.co/v8opeI7j1S #ThursdayThoughts #johnadams Contact your reps or @NatResources and tell them to support HR 1220!
This call for a memorial from students &amp; future leaders at Westfield Intermediate School in Westfield, IN is the best! Watch here: https://t.co/xwhzDCTFhN Pass HR1220! @Susanwbrooks @SenDonnelly @SenToddYoung @NatResources @wwsweb #JohnAdams #WednesdayWisdom #listentothekids ‚òòÔ∏è
With #Philadelphia in the news, we remember that #JohnAdams fought tirelessly for independence in that city. In part 2 of our series, we also remember that he's waited too long for a memorial to honor his efforts: https://t.co/RmCO8a9Fz3 #FlyEaglesFly
@RepMikeJohnson HR 1220 has stalled in the @NatResources committee. If you signed on as a cosponsor of the bipartisan bill, it would help these statistics. #JohnAdams
With #pardon and #SCOTUS in the news, this Founding Father is more relevant than ever. Here is the 1st in our series of articles calling to honor #johnadams: John Adams Should Have a Memorial in Washington: https://t.co/EjvxrRWuzD
This week, we'll be sharing articles from publications that have called for a John Adams Memorial. What's the hold up? Political willpower. Contact your reps! Contact members of the @NatResources committee where HR 1220 has stalled. #JohnAdams didn't give up, neither should we.
