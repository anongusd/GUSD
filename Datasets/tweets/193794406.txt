The gov‚Äôt funding deal the Senate just passed makes a significant down payment on @POTUS‚Äô border security goal, and to help further achieve that goal, I plan to support his national emergency declaration. Full statement on the agreement I helped negotiate: https://t.co/ZxllbACmkz

I am proud to have been a part of this process, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan deal.
Though conferees compromised on details, we did not compromise our principles. Passing this conference agreement is in our national security interest. It will provide the resources, the direction, and the support that @POTUS has said many times he needs to protect our nation.
This bill includes the highest level of funding ever in a Homeland appropriations bill to combat the opioid epidemic ‚Äî more than $700 million.
Another government shutdown cannot and should not be allowed to happen. We need to provide certainty to our federal workers and to the American people who they ‚Äî and we here in Congress ‚Äî serve.
To my friends who ‚Äî like me ‚Äî want more money for the wall: This agreement is better for the wall and better for @ICEgov than any other alternative. Rejecting this agreement would cost dozens of miles of new wall and jeopardize ICE‚Äôs ability to detain dangerous criminals.
On the border itself, I have been clear that our agreement had to include three elements:  		‚úÖ Physical barriers 		‚úÖTechnology 		‚úÖ Personnel
However, it‚Äôs important to understand the difference between compromising on details and compromising on principles.  While this agreement may compromise on some of the specifics, it does not compromise on our commitment to secure our nation.
This agreement is a compromise between Republicans and Democrats and between the House and the Senate.  Because it is a compromise, none of us got everything that we wanted.
I‚Äôve been a part of border security negotiations from Day 1, and I‚Äôm ready to get this deal across the finish line. Hear how this compromise addresses our homeland security when I speak on the @SenateFloor at 11:15 a.m. Watch live here: https://t.co/R23JLiBZI5

Most importantly, I had a chance to extend my thanks to these leaders and to the men and women of their organizations. They performed their duties w/o pay during the shutdown. Their commitment to their mission never waned.
I heard directly from CBP that they can‚Äôt do their jobs as effectively w/o physical barriers. Coasties, CBP, &amp; the American people expect us to work together to find a solution‚Äîincluding physical barriers, advanced technologies at ports of entry, &amp; more boots on the ground.

Catch me on @Talkradiowrnr today at 9:15 a.m. I hope you‚Äôll tune in as we discuss yesterday‚Äôs Senate votes and what I‚Äôm doing to move forward so federal workers can get back to work and we can secure our border. Listen here: https://t.co/CGFaCskwFB
I just got off the Senate floor. Here‚Äôs why I voted for @POTUS‚Äô compromise bill. Read more about my vote here: https://t.co/wsnF6mcKHO https://t.co/0ZswcdXagU
The president‚Äôs proposal represents an honest effort to reopen the government and strengthen border security‚Äîa good faith offer that includes both Republican and Democrat priorities.
GOP BILL: End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act (aka @POTUS‚Äô proposal) would immediately reopen the closed portions of the government and fund border security.		DEM BILL: Would fund the government through February 8 without funding for any physical barrier at the border. https://t.co/CwXel8HQrG
This is one of the reasons I care so deeply about border security. Stopping drugs at the border means stopping them before they get to West Virginia communities. https://t.co/bLUvz6xH03
I believe we should embrace that spirit of compromise to end this shutdown and secure our border. What can‚Äôt be compromised is our nation‚Äôs security.
No one ‚Äî not the president ‚Äî not any senator ‚Äî and not any representative gets everything they want in this bill. That is the nature of compromise.
.@POTUS has made a significant concession by asking that we include a provision giving three years of certainty to those covered by the DACA executive order ‚Äî as well as some who have been on Temporary Protective Status. That provision is included in this amendment.
The amendment that Dems have proposed reopens the government through February 8th. It provides no new resources to address the security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Passing the Schumer plan would put us in the same situation on February 8th that exists today.
The combination of technology and personnel ‚Äî both at our ports of entry and along the border ‚Äîalong with the border wall system will enhance our security and choke off a major source of the heroin and fentanyl that has devastated families in West Virginia and across the country.
We have 654 miles of physical barrier in place today. If we pass this amendment, we can build 234 more miles in areas like the Rio Grande Valley, where career Border Patrol personnel tell us it is needed most.
We are here in this body to work together. To get over any rifts we may have, and to move forward to do the people‚Äôs work. We have to fix this situation, and we have to fix it now. We can do that with the president‚Äôs proposed compromise.
A shutdown is no way to govern. It‚Äôs a disservice to our federal workers. It shows our inability to do our job with those on the other side of the aisle. It‚Äôs a signal to the American people that we think this confusing and ineffective way to run the government is OK. It‚Äôs not.
In the past several days and weeks, there has been a lot of talk about who has leverage, who is ‚Äúwinning,‚Äù and what the political stakes are. Those are not the questions on the minds of federal workers.
Join me on the @SenateFloor at noon today as I explain why @POTUS‚Äô proposal is a good compromise to end the government shutdown and secure our southern border. You can watch live here: https://t.co/BgqBA5qgLD
The Homeland Security funding package in @POTUS' compromise includes resources for a whole range of border security priorities. Big picture: Physical barriers are only a piece of this package. This bill is an inclusive, encompassing response to enhance our nation‚Äôs security. https://t.co/HAQHdrqCMd

As chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I‚Äôve been working with the administration and congressional leaders to come to a bipartisan solution like the one offered today.
.@POTUS made a good faith offer that includes important priorities for both Rs and Ds. As I‚Äôve said from the beginning, that‚Äôs the kind of compromise we need‚Äîone that gets federal employees back to work, ensures our government is working at full capacity, &amp; secures our borders.

.@POTUS made clear during his campaign he would appoint judges with respect for the Constitution. He kept his commitment to the people of #WV and to the people of the country when he nominated Judge Brett #Kavanaugh.
The confirmation process for a well-qualified #SCOTUS nominee shouldn't focus on guessing how a Justice #Kavanaugh might vote in a case, &amp; there's no reason a nominee w/ a strong record of applying the text of the Constitution &amp; the law shouldn't be confirmed overwhelmingly.
Judge #Kavanaugh and I share the belief that faithfulness to the text of the law as written ‚Äî not the pursuit of a particular policy outcome ‚Äî should be the goal of a judge.
.@POTUS made an excellent choice in nominating Judge #Kavanaugh to serve on the #SCOTUS. Beyond his resume, Judge Kavanaugh has a record of respect and effectiveness.

This is about growing small bizs, raising wages, making American companies more competitive globally and creating more jobs in the U.S.

For the good of the nation &amp; for the good of the Senate, there should be no filibuster of Judge Gorsuch.
I hope my Dem colleagues will recognize the need to invoke cloture on Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs nomination.
Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge who has earned the respect of his judicial colleagues.
The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the filibuster against #SCOTUS nominations.
A filibuster of a nominee like Judge Gorsuch would be a tremendous mistake &amp; would harm the Senate as an institution.
.@TheJournalWV echoed these words saying Judge Gorsuch will decide cases regardless of his own preferences
.@IntelligencerWV editorial highlights that Judge Gorsuch is faithful to the #Constitution, not ideology.
Recent @DM_opinion editorial supports Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs confirmation &amp; believes he has the strong understanding &amp; respect for our Constitution
It‚Äôs clear from our mtg, a thorough examination of his record &amp; watching last wks hearing, that Judge Gorsuch will rule fairly.
Judge Gorsuch has been through the Senate confirmation process before when he was approved to the 10th circuit w/out opposition.
Judge Scalia left behind a legacy of faithfully applying the law &amp; Judge Gorsuch is a worthy successor.

.@POTUS' action today is a refreshing change &amp; a promise kept to roll back the #CPP - 1 of the most harmful acts of overreach by Obama admin
Unfortunately President Obama vetoed our measures to protect affordable, reliable energy &amp; jobs from the #CleanPowerPlan's overreach
Last year, I led the charge in the Senate along w/ @SenateMajLdr to overturn harmful #CleanPowerPlan regs for coal power sources
This Executive Order shows @POTUS is serious about cutting anti-coal regs &amp; reducing unnecessary obstacles for jobs &amp; energy production.
