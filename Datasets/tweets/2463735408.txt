@realDonaldTrump WE ARE TIRED AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE, This revolt WILL BE TELEVISED and you  will be shamed out of office, It is only time until you are either looking at many years, looking to get your sons JailBait Jrs off, or cutting your son in law loose,

We have laws to 2PC adults, but child services limit what can be done, We must re examine involuntary admissions and when we use them
@TalbertSwan What are we all doing to bring our troubled youth back to a healthier community? The adolescents who commit these horrors feel enraged, violent and isolated. We must reach out to them so we can create school safety,
@RevDrBarber @SoulBlossom_Wen @Parksplace2 @RevJacquiLewis @ZenChangeAngel What can faith-based leaders do to provide a community for those adolescents who are lost and isolated? These are the most likely candidates to turn violent or to need to be seen in this way
The problem is an intersect betw violence and the arming of our country, Many adolescents feel isolated and uncared for, They seek gangs, including White Suprem to feel a community. We must continue to work to getting them back to a healthier community
Plez understand the limits that teachers have when intervening with a troubled child, After 40 yrs of experience, I know there is not enough time, resources, training or empowerment to solve the problems. School violence and the safety of children must be a national movement
Now they want to get rid of gun free zones in schools. Have they learned nothing from our recent past? More guns are not the answers, Sensible gun laws and mental health services for those who are troubled or violent

@RedTRaccoon @PamelaPatriot Even older Dolt 45 makes me want to vomit
What can we do to prevent bullying in young teens? Thoughts and prayers, tweeting, posting on FB are all for the person posting not the teen, How many ppl use their feed to prove they are good ppl? Just tired of &lt;of true actions #MentalHealthMatters
@rudepundit @Ldonahuehjelle Dolt 45  has hit rock bottom, if that is possible
A young teen killled herself because she was bullied. TRAGIC Thinking that you are doing something about it because you sent a tweet, just as TRAGIC, Teenage suicide is 2nd killer of kids tied for MVAs #MentalHealthMatters
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS are helpful, but tweeting about children comitting suicide and not doing anything else, is yelling into an echo chamber. Take the next step, do something
@karimtbe Where was the suicide prevention for this child? There is such racism in health care, the dirty secret few talk about, Crowdfund for some while alive and others after they have killed themselves, WHERE IS THE FAIRNESS?

@NBCNews Stupid..your accountant is supposed to be the Jew and your attorney is supposed to be Black, Stick to the script
RIGHT NOW someone is contemplating killing him or herself, Tweeting about #MentalHealthMatters is critical, but also spend your time being kind. You never know who you will save
There are truly someone just faith leaders with integrity such as @RevKHenderson  and @RevDrBarber and then there are some who feel tweeting replaces activism. Dont just tweet about the ills of society, get out there and make some noise
I am so tired of pseudo compassion, where someone thinks that she or he tweets re a cause, and now she or he is an activist. Bullying is awful; hateful mothers are awful. Children killing themselves is awful But spend the 4 min helping someone alive or supporting a just cause
@sfa_life @DrAlParsons and all it took were a couple of unverified tweets and now sixty thousand later, his mother the neo hater is supported. Luckily, the account was put on hold pending investigation
@LibyaLiberty @Russian_Starr Or worse, people feel they are abating bully by putting a tweet on their feed, I see all types of ppl doing this, but when faith leaders' best effort is to RT, it is sickening

@menhealuk @nrmentalhealth @erezshek @electroboyusa @Breaking_Taboo @JessicaGimeno @HealthyPlace @MiaStJohnBoxer @DrCraigMalkin @BekaLombardo @BipolarHotMess @jbuchana As long as any practice makes someone's life less complicated, it can be helpful.
