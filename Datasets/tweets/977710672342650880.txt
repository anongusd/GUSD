@MansoorGajani @MehrTarar @khurramkibaat Murder is different content, this type of crimes danger for other, but this is morally crime . Why you compare murder type of crime with smoking.

@MehrTarar Islam is comprehensive and modren religion , You have well &amp;wide knowledge of Islam,but I informed you that if you observed that in Islam those things are banned which are not good for health, all those things are family of sin,so smoking are not good thing,so we can say it sin.
