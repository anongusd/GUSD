@conor64 I get that you are trying to convince the other side - but - please don't use the pejorative terms of the anti-immigrant racists. You could have also used economic data (&amp; history!) to back up the fact that immigration is GOOD for US! (pun intended)
@conor64 Almost every American has ancestors who came here, worked hard, saved up, then brought their families. That's our whole thing. INA quotas were created in the 1960s to limit non-European migration. (thanks, Ted Kennedy)
@conor64 Studying for the bar so not yet a lawyer - but - "chain migration" is not a real term. It's demeaning &amp; offensive. INA sections 201-204 and 8 CFR sec 204 provide for Family Sponsored Immigrant Visas. Employment based immigration is also a thing, different code sections.

@wcs1only @3662brendon @PFTompkins 2/The solution to these complications is to deliver the baby. Not kill the baby first and then deliver.-what if the baby is undeliverable?

@wcs1only @3662brendon @PFTompkins That is a strawman.-correct 	No one is arguing that a woman needs to die of pregnancy complications. - but that's what can happen	There are no medical conditions which require a baby to be aborted at full term. - that's right, which is why it doesn't happen	1/2

@cherry13474475 @millennialthey @ThePerezHilton Sadly, our country was built on free labor &amp; extremely cheap labor. However, immigrants bring their dreams that end up transforming the country. Right now the wealthy interests are pitting us against each other over scraps. We can have it all-welcoming them &amp; fixing problems.
@cherry13474475 @millennialthey @ThePerezHilton It's the promise of our country. We are the ones raining bombs everywhere and telling everyone how great we are. Maybe we shouldn't have done that for the last 200 years ... but we did and we marketed it well &amp; welcoming strivers &amp; workers is why we do well!
@SxxSmith @iadambutchart @ThePerezHilton That's sad for NZ. But you know how we are always saying USA! We're #1! This is one of the reasons why. This is why people want to come here. It's the whole fucking point. If we were just going to be part of the Commonwealth, what was the point of the War of Independence?
@ThePerezHilton Please see the 14th Amendment and why they passed it. The slaves weren't citizens. They were the illegal immigrants / stateless people at the time. The govt wanted it to be clear that if you were born here, you ARE a citizen!!!! That is the whole point of this country.

@Pepsibbb @taureanenergy The kid could also turn out to be Hitler. Or the Unabomber. Kids are really $$$ &amp; so is food, housing, clothes, school, etc. Not everyone wants to end up living on the streets or giving their kid a bad life. Adoption &amp; foster care are traumatic. Women should decide for themselves
@nacho8791 @taureanenergy Because religious leaders control many countries and they don't allow it. Or it's too expensive. Or Republicans want to end the contraceptive mandate in the ACA and defund Planned Parenthood. Or you live in a contraceptive desert or your husband won't allow it or ... #misogyny

Imagine your uterus is America &amp; U get to decide what's right for U!
@obnxioslycurius @MSDEEINCLEVE @taureanenergy Let's put this in conservative terms you might understand. America, the land of the immigrant, does not want to admit 3000 asylum seekers from countries we bombed &amp; sent violent gang members to. Do we have to allow them all in - no questions asked?
@obnxioslycurius @MSDEEINCLEVE @taureanenergy Sadly that is not true. I was a teen mom and people wanted my white drug-free baby and no one wanted my group home roommate's mixed race baby. Also the amount of kids in orphanages, foster care, (&amp; in detention by the govt) sadly proves this to be not true.
@Phidze72 @taureanenergy @SueNyathi It's actually a pretty genius suggestion because most women climax when penises aren't even involved so a man can give women much more pleasure and way less anxiety by doing other things for her and keeping his sperm far, far away :) You solved it :)
@k_den_ben @AnEggSandwich @taureanenergy Women don't always have a choice in the sexual activity. 	It's also often men who control the level of protection involved. The only person who can control unwanted pregnancies is the men who have sex with women. It's on them.

@GordonHarmony @hitaskunk @Tim_X_ @jbsmth65 @JohnCleese You are really lucky it worked out for you!

@Tim_X_ @jbsmth65 @JohnCleese Will women all of a sudden stop needing abortions because he's president? I don't see the correlation. Even if it becomes illegal, women will just go to back alleys again? Are you saying you'd rather have women die like in the 50s and 60s again instead of being safe?

Safe and legal abortions must be protected. And all health care access has to be expanded, maybe with a Medicare For All type program or single payer. Whatever it is, we all need easy-access and affordable contraception to protect our health from the risk of unwanted pregnancies.
and whose reproductive health clinics closed due to TRAP laws already can't access birth control. And as a logical thinker and data and science appreciator, @sullydish should know that when people can't access birth control, they then need - surprise - abortions!
Legislators could do the work in places like CA where we already have legal abortion enshrined in our constitution. But what about places like AL or TX where women are already endangered by lack of access? Women in states whose Govs and legislatures didn't expand the ACA
or their religions to tell them how to vote. We would put the health and safety of ~150 million American women into our current toxic mix of propaganda, voter suppression, Super PAC corruption, and religious-theocratic voter manipulation campaigns? That would be dangerous.
My Prop 8 experience in CA shows us on an issue that @sullydish cares about how referendums to grant or deny people's fundamental rights can easily go wrong. Legislatures are gerrymandered. People can't vote. Some people won't vote. And others are manipulated by special interests
Roe gave us safe and legal abortion. It saves lives. 25-33% of all women will have an abortion. Women are half the population. Almost 4 billion people on this planet are women. And @sullydish wants to condescend to us that why can't we have a referendum on our rights?
I have no vested interest in Obergefell other than my joy in knowing that it helps others and gives us a society based in equality that we want as Americans and as humans on this tiny blue dot.
I, too, relied on the courts to save us to overturn Prop 8. I cried tears of joy and relief when Obergefell was decided. In law school, I spoke up against the bigots when it was discussed in our community property class. I pointed out the beautiful language of Kennedy's decision.
When @sullydish's issue was in the news during my young adulthood, I immediately saw how I could help - by teaching my son that everyone is valuable, by championing equality, by voting, by boycotting stores that supported the opposing position on CA's marriage referendum in 2008.
Just like NOW. I'm not gay. I knew no gay people growing up. I was raised Catholic &amp; was told gay people were bad &amp; I should tell them to not be gay so they wouldn't go to hell. I met a few gay women at hockey during high school.
My friend had an abortion in the 1960s when she was 13. Her family had to scrape together $1000. In the 1960s when average family income was what? $5k/year? There was a groundswell that the recent anti-abortion laws were wrong and needed to be changed.
Husbands who lost wives in botched abortions wanted other women to be able to access them safely. Parents who lost daughters did the same. (See more recently, Savita's family in Ireland who helped change their laws.)
The courts and the legislature follow public opinion. By 1973, there was an outcry from women and their allies - not just our natural allies against the patriarchy, gay men - but straight men who didn't want the state to force them to be parents every time they had sex!
If their wives health wouldn't allow them to have any more kids, the Founding Fathers could easily access prostitutes. So of course they didn't think about midwives and abortions and women's rights. They weren't on their radar. And not just because radar didn't exist yet.
Of course the Founders didn't think about marriage equality. Of course they didn't think about abortion. They could easily replace a wife who died in childbirth with another woman. They could easily create more slaves by impregnating their own slaves. https://t.co/dtx11nz6ZA
of the expansion of our rights - not directly spelled out in the Constitution, but that our understanding of evolved over time.
The Court could see that anti-abortion laws were fairly recent, did nothing to prevent abortions, and led poor women to unsafe methods that put their lives and health in danger. Even now, 70% of Americans favor abortion rights. Like marriage equality, it was a natural progression https://t.co/R7niWm47Tz
To say that Roe was passed by an "activist court" without public support denies reality. That activist court also gave us Mapp v Ohio. Miranda v AZ. Gideon v Wainwright. Griswold v CT. What Earl Warren started flowed through to Roe because the courts looked at the data.
Courts were the only resort of gay couples to validate their marriages because of the hodgepodge of friendly laws to other states who had extremely hateful laws passed by people who were whipped up into anti-gay prejudice by special interest groups with a lot of money.
His beautiful post is about the marriage equality decision. I don't understand how someone with such thoughtfulness and nuance about an issue affecting him can fail to have empathy for women. But his comments showed a lack of empathy that I can't understand &amp; hope to change. https://t.co/geiV3A9R3W

We're opening the door to end this abuse of power that keeps us all down! Sorry ... too upset about the USSC. Trying to keep my hope alive.
@thereisnohurry @designmom @TaranaBurke And a lot of women internalize patriarchal messages - "she's not pretty, who would want to **** her, she could have left or said no" - so if this is the first time they caught a glimmer of themselves - this will open the door to empathy for ALL!
@thereisnohurry @designmom @TaranaBurke Yes-we can relate to the maids &amp; nannies &amp; professors &amp; secretaries &amp;lawyers-but those women never get justice or attention! We need to lift each other up &amp; realize that we're all in this together against the patriarchy. Access Hollywood woke us up, I think!

@wreiddalton @DouthatNYT We are all human made in Christ's image, right? So why wouldn't you want to live next door to someone with skin color different than yours? Would you say the same for different religion? or disability status? Separate but equal is not equal. Integration rights past wrongs.
@wreiddalton @DouthatNYT What's wrong with that? Abortion is medical care. Lots of current candidates talk about their personal experience about it anyway. It's transformative to be able to NOT have a kid you can't afford &amp; to want to protect that right for others.
