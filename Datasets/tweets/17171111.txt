The voters sent a very clear message in November that they will no longer accept inaction on this public health epidemic. We call on the Senate to take swift action on this crucial legislation to help make all of our communities safer.
We urge all members of Congress to resist such efforts.		Gun violence prevention is not a political imperative but a moral one, and it is now the Senate‚Äôs turn to follow the lead of the people‚Äôs House.
Additionally, we are troubled by congressional Republican leadership playing political games by trying to conflate the need to address gun violence with immigration enforcement and continuing to demonize immigrant and mental health communities.
‚Äîand that thoughts and prayers alone cannot achieve what smart policy and meaningful gun laws can. 		But let there be no doubt: While these measures are a critical first step to addressing gaps in our gun laws, much work remains to be done.
These long overdue measures will address some of the most dangerous gaps in our nation‚Äôs gun laws and send a strong signal to the American people that our elected leaders realize that gun violence is not inevitable...

.@CAPSecurity aims to provide a deeper, nuanced perspective on China‚Äôs real global governance intentions by mapping what President Xi &amp; Chinese leaders are saying to their domestic audience &amp; how Chinese foreign policy scholars interpret those statements. https://t.co/INi62Hmihk
From a liberal democratic perspective, if Beijing succeeds in bringing about that vision, the world will be less free, less prosperous, and less safe.
The current global governance system is rules-based and privileges liberal democratic values; Beijing‚Äôs alternative vision is a system based on authoritarian governance principles in which nations negotiate issues bilaterally instead of following common rules and standards.
It's difficult to map China‚Äôs true intentions based on Xi's speeches, which make fuzzy promises that can be spun various ways, like his claim China aims to make the global system more democratic in order to ‚Äúbuild a community of shared future for mankind.‚Äù https://t.co/wsv0fVjC7a
The U.S. &amp; other democratic nations need to understand Beijing‚Äôs vision for the global governance system and how that vision differs from the prevailing liberal democratic order, which recognizes limits to state authority, such as binding international law &amp; unalienable rights.
As the largest global economy, it's natural for China to seek a stronger voice on global governance issues.

Breaking this trend will require policymakers to address the needs and rights of people with SMI as a community, instead of using them as scapegoats to avoid enacting meaningful gun violence prevention measures. https://t.co/htWe6EO0qd
Promoting the freedom, safety, and autonomy of people with SMI (significant mental illness) will require a fundamental shift in the United States‚Äô approach to mental health care.
The disruption of this punitive cycle will only be possible through recognition of the harms inherent in coercive treatment. 		Forced institutionalization is a form of medical incarceration.
When coupled with renewed threats to privacy rights in the proposed changes to HIPAA &amp; FERPA, a system takes shape in which an entire class of people is functionally criminalized based on their mental health &amp; the presumption of violence with which it has been falsely associated.
Nationwide, people with mental health disabilities are already battling threats to their freedom and autonomy.
In 1971, Florida passed the Baker Act, setting the guidelines for involuntary institutionalization. Put simply, it positions a mental health crisis as a threat that can only be managed through coercive means &amp; the intervention of law enforcement officers. https://t.co/uPb0FVebFi
For people with mental health disabilities, especially people of color, ableism has historically led to institutionalization in wards that utilized coercive methods to manage patients in their care. https://t.co/jiutwDi0pX
Let's be clear: The surveillance of people with significant mental illness is not new.		It's a pervasive manifestation of ableism, or the structural &amp; interpersonal oppression of people with disabilities based on their presumed or actual disability status. https://t.co/Cra8w4X45h
This cements the discriminatory narrative that a student‚Äôs need for mental health services makes them potentially dangerous. Now, the FL Senate is poised to expand the criminalization &amp; surveillance of those with mental health disabilities under the guise of making schools safer.
Within weeks of the Parkland shooting, legislators passed a statute addressing matters of student discipline &amp; school safety. Tucked in the statute is a clause that functionally creates a statewide registry of students who receive mental health care &amp; who have juvenile records.
Let's talk about the scapegoating of people with mental health disabilities and the use of gun violence as a pretext to increase surveillance of an already marginalized community.		Follow along as we break down @CAPDisability's latest: https://t.co/4wdiznK8jK

Higher interest rates have pushed up the cost of homes, cars, and other big-ticket purchases, slowing an economy that remains heavily dependent on consumer spending.
More broadly, we do know Trump‚Äôs huge tax cut for the wealthy is not trickling down to working households: Even if one squints very hard, neither the investment boom nor the wage growth that the tax cut was supposed to produce is showing up in the data.
The shutdown injects some noise into this report, but it‚Äôs easily the most important economic data of the week, partly because the #TrumpShutdown has cancelled the advance GDP estimate we were supposed to get this week.
Today‚Äôs jobs number is strong, even if tempered by a large downward revision to last month‚Äôs payroll figure.

Follow @CAPEarlyEd for more on the LEAD Innovation Fund.
Specifically, it would focus on approaches that are smarter and cheaper and that better meet benchmarks set by federal agencies such as the EPA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The proposed LEAD Innovation Fund, to be managed by the National Science Foundation, would accelerate the development of next-generation approaches to lead detection and monitoring.
While lead exposure cuts across demographics, those affected by it are more likely to be low income communities of color living in substandard housing. Communities of color remain at increased risk for higher blood lead concentration. https://t.co/84z7nmGBv4
Children under the age of 5 are particularly vulnerable because their body, brain, and metabolism are still developing. However, low-dose lead exposure affects adults as well. https://t.co/c98Su23e8x
At the height of the Flint, Michigan lead contamination and water crisis in 2016, a Reuters report found that, in the United States, 3,810 communities had lead poisoning levels at least double those in Flint.
Lead has long been known to be a toxin to humans. Seizures, coma, and even death can occur with high exposure rates to lead. https://t.co/heCi5TwcpE

5‚É£ Public safety is increasingly threatened.		Another key role that now-furloughed employees &amp; funding play is in violence prevention &amp; intervention services. As the shutdown persists, a number of domestic violence programs are preparing to curtail services as funding dries up.
4‚É£ Risk of preventable deaths caused by reductions in local services and supports is increasing.		Smaller, lower-income, &amp; more geographically isolated communities‚Äîmany of which already must contend with inadequate resources &amp; services‚Äîare bearing the brunt of the #TrumpShutdown.
3‚É£ Security &amp; affordability of homes is further destabilized.		With the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development shuttered, federal rental assistance programs that provide supportive &amp; safe housing for more than 5 million low-income households are at risk of major funding lapses
2‚É£ Food assistance for millions of low-income children, seniors, and people with disabilities is in jeopardy.		The lapse in funding for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs means that millions of families are facing uncertainty in meeting their nutritional needs.
1‚É£ Paychecks of federal workers, contractors, and support staff are being withheld.		An estimated 800,000 federal employees‚Äîand hundreds of thousands more federal contractors and support staff‚Äîhave missed paychecks since the shutdown began on December 22.

.@USTreasury Secretary StevenMnuchin, seemingly out of nowhere, cast doubt on the soundness of American banks, and President Trump‚Äôs petulant behavior has led to a two-week‚Äîand counting‚Äîpartial shutdown of the federal government.
While the news today on jobs and wages is encouraging, the administration has recently rattled onlookers with a series of its own goals that have rightfully cast renewed doubt on its ability to handle the economy.
2018 closed with a lot of news about economic volatility, with much of that volatility emanating from the White House, and the majority of that news came after today‚Äôs jobs numbers were collected.
Today‚Äôs jobs report makes clear that the momentum the economy carried into 2018 is still with us. Yet, there is reason to wonder how much longer we can sustain a nearly decade-long recovery amidst the erratic economic decision-making of the Trump Administration.
The final #JobsReport of 2018 showed that the unemployment rate rose to 3.9% and the economy added 312,000 new jobs.

Finally, as #TaxScamTurns1, a reminder that tax cuts for the top 1 percent cost more than SNAP. https://t.co/zV3qZWdERL
Some quick facts on SNAP: 	‚Ä¢ SNAP helps more than 40 million Americans put food on the table each month.	‚Ä¢ Close to two-thirds of SNAP recipients are children, seniors, and people with disabilities.	‚Ä¢ In 2017, SNAP kept 3.4 million people out of poverty.
The additional barriers to employment proposed by the Trump administration today could not come at a worse time. In a poll conducted earlier this year, nearly half of Americans report serious trouble finding a job with decent wages in the past year.
Research suggests when workers lack access to the basics‚Äîsuch as food, stable housing, and adequate medical care‚Äîit presents a serious obstacle to steady employment and higher earnings.
The SNAP program already has work requirements, which in reality function as harsh time limits for unemployed and underemployed workers, as well as people who face serious barriers to work.
The proposed rule released today by the Trump administration would dramatically weaken SNAP by making it even harder for unemployed and underemployed workers to access food assistance, in the name of harsher ‚Äúwork requirements.‚Äù

The Fed appears set to hike rates again later this month, but with the investment and wage effects from the tax cut continuing to disappoint, it looks increasingly possible that interest rates have already gone too high.

25. In the past 2 years, the Trump administration has advanced 3 versions of its Muslim ban. Despite putting thousands of refugees‚Äô lives at risk, Sessions' DOJ defended these efforts and secured support from conservatives on the Supreme Court to let the travel ban take effect.
24. Rather than embracing the thousands of people of color facing gender-based violence and or gang violence in their countries of origin and expanding access to victims‚Äô services, Sessions declared that they will likely no longer qualify for asylum.
23. Sessions forced judges to rush deportation cases by revoking policies that allow additional time for deliberation. Moreover, he implemented quotas in order to expedite the rate of deportations.
22. In 2017, then-Attorney General Sessions announced that the administration would eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. He also repeatedly refused to defend DACA in federal court.
21. Entangling local law enforcement with immigration enforcement diminishes public trust and public safety. Despite such concerns, the Sessions DOJ sued California for refusing to help round up immigrants across the state.
20. In April 2018,Sessions announced a zero-tolerance immigration policy of prosecuting anyone who arrives in the U.S. without documentation‚Äîeven families seeking asylum. The policy separated thousands of children from parents. The zero-tolerance policy remains on the books today
19. Sessions exposed his backward views in racially charged statements about the importance of the ‚ÄúAnglo-American heritage of law enforcement.‚Äù
18. Despite success under police reform agreements, Sessions effectively barred the DOJ from investigating and addressing systemic law enforcement misconduct at the local level.
17. Sessions asked courts to disregard an Obama-era letter requesting them to be lenient and cautious of overcharging low-income defendants of color.
16. Sessions misrepresented data about the rate of violence experienced by law enforcement to justify the overpolicing in communities of color.
15. In his role as attorney general, Sessions threatened to shut down halfway houses and limit access to transitional services, which are key barriers to successful re-entry.
14. Data show that innocent black Americans are 7x more likely to be convicted of murder than white counterparts, partly due to insufficient &amp; inaccurate forensic evidence. Sessions axed the National Commission on Forensic Science, which works to improve forensic reliability.
13. Sessions ignored the data showing that violent crime has declined significantly in recent decades and instead peddled false narratives about crime to justify police crackdowns in communities of color.
12. Sessions supported expanding the use of private prisons as part of the DOJ‚Äôs immigration crackdown and renewed war on drugs campaign.
11. Sessions eliminated training and supervision requirements for law enforcement seeking to obtain surplus weapons and equipment from federal agencies.
10. In his role as attorney general, Sessions pushed prosecutors to crack down on marijuana possession in states where it is legal and lobbied legislators to reverse federal protections for medical marijuana.
9. Sessions rejected data stating that African Americans or black Americans are more than twice as likely to be arrested for drug possession and ordered prosecutors to pursue the harshest drug sentences possible‚Äîwithout regard to an individual‚Äôs role in a drug conspiracy.
8. Sessions and the DOJ consistently sought to undermine race-conscious admissions policies
7. Under Sessions, the DOJ rescinded federal protections for transgender students in K-12 schools, denying them the ability to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.
6. Sessions exploited his position as attorney general to criticize and make light of universities that seek to create inclusive, hate-free learning environments.
5. Sessions revoked critical employment protections for people with disabilities, finding that they were ‚Äúunnecessary, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper.‚Äù
4. Sessions threatened to make matters worse for black transgender individuals by reversing Obama-era policies that sought to protect transgender workers from employment discrimination.
3. Sessions‚Äô DOJ urged the Supreme Court to greenlight harmful voter purges nationwide.
2. Sessions asked Congress to eliminate the DOJ‚Äôs Community Relations Service, which is dedicated to addressing racial tensions and preventing hate crimes.
As Attorney General, Jeff Sessions did not miss an opportunity to criminalize and terrorize people of color. In this thread, we‚Äôll take you through the 25 ways he did so:		1. Sessions sabotaged the 2020 census by helping Wilbur Ross add a new question about immigration status.

Rising interest rates are increasingly hitting families‚Äô pocketbooks, and the investment boom promised to sell the tax bill hasn't materialized. Two years in, it‚Äôs clear who the Trump economy was designed for. Read @mikemadowitz's full statement: https://t.co/dbQus9J0Ur #JobsDay
Corporate profits and stock buybacks have boomed, while real wage growth has remained stubbornly low‚Äîmaking it plainly obvious who has benefited from the Trump tax bill.
The president has falsely claimed that the state of the economy and the rate of job creation are the ‚Äúbest ever,‚Äù but his promises of a trickle-down boom fueled by colossal tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans is just not the reality.
Virtually every action Trump has taken has ensured that the benefits of the economy go to the top 1 percent, leaving the middle class falling behind with flat real wage growth.
The economy added 250,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent, and year-over-year wage growth came in at 3.1 percent. #JobsReport

Read the full breakdown here:https://t.co/9lk2vZWQ2q #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh
Presidential power: Kavanaugh has said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never taken a position on the constitutionality of indicting or investigating a sitting president.‚Äù However, he has previously written that ‚Äúthe Constitution ‚Ä¶ appears to preclude indictment of a sitting president‚Ä¶‚Äù
Roe v. Wade: Kavanaugh has said it is ‚Äúsettled law,‚Äù however an email written by Kavanaugh calls this response into question, suggesting that he does not believe Roe is ‚Äúsettled‚Äù‚Äîor that the phrase has any particular meaning at all.
Convenient Kozinski amnesia: Kavanaugh wrote he doesn‚Äôt remember the Judge‚Äôs infamous sexually inappropriate incidents in the workplace, but a former clerk says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how it would be possible to forget something as pervasive as Kozinski‚Äôs famously sexual sense of humor‚Äù
Judicial nominations: Kavanaugh also misled senators on his role in the nominations of particularly controversial lower court judges. The fact that he lied about his role in promoting a hard-line political agenda on the courts now disturbingly echoes his own confirmation process.
Torture: At the 2006 hearing Kavanaugh told Sen. Dick Durbin, ‚ÄúI was not involved &amp; am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.‚Äù However, Kavanaugh now admits that there were at least 3 instances of his participation in the detainee policy.
Warrantless wiretapping: ‚ÄúAs a senior staffer in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh was at least present for high-level policy discussions, despite the insistence of Senate Republicans that he was merely a ‚Äúpaper pusher.‚Äù
Accessing stolen docs: Kavanaugh testified that he never saw any files that ‚Äúappeared to ‚Ä¶ have been drafted or prepared by Democratic staff.‚Äù However, newly released documents reveal that he had in fact seen the files labeled which were clearly labeled ‚Äúnot [for] distribution.‚Äù
Leaking: Kavanaugh was named as the designated leaker in the Ken Starr investigation. His apparent readiness &amp; willingness to leak this information raises serious concerns about his commitment to upholding the law as opposed to misusing it to advance a political &amp; personal agenda
False Initial statement: Kavanaugh said ‚ÄúNo president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.‚Äù This claim is ridiculous. Trump explicitly promised to pick a nominee from a pre-approved list

Instead, it is a fundamental re-embrace of American values. It is a recognition that America's democratic values are essential to winning in a world of great power competition. https://t.co/CpCnv4ml6r
This is neither a call to return to the days of promoting democracy through military force nor to a zero-sum Cold War mindset. It is not about setting aside our other national security interests.
Finally, we must boost support for peaceful democratic movements across the world.
Fourth, we must demonstrate the world's democracies can solve this century's most pressing challenges by networking with our allies and forging new coalitions to tackle global issues.
Third, the US should honor relationships with other democracies by extending exclusive economic and security relationships.
Second, America needs to remember how to tell our friends apart from our enemies-- and work in concert with democratic allies.
First, we need to win the fight to protect our democratic values at home.
America must change its approach by placing democratic values at the heart of US foreign policy. America must view democratic values as a comparative advantage, not a hindrance, in the fight ahead.
But instead of supporting democracy, President Trump attacks democratic values at home and democratic allies like Canada while admiring authoritarians like Vladimir Putin.
The more thriving democracies there are in the world, the more secure and the more prosperous the United States will be in the long-run.
Democracy is at a crossroads at home and abroad. People are losing faith in democratic institutions, authoritarian governments like China are rising, and American democracy is in disarray.
Today @kellymagsamen, @maxbergmann, @mikehfuchs, and Trevor Sutton of @CAPSecurity released a new report laying out the case for a democratic values-driven US foreign policy. https://t.co/CpCnv4ml6r		(Thread) Here's what you need to know:
