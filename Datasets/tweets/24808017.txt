@RubCarvalho Good idea Ruben!
You can donate or toss your no-longer-needed basket at your next annual purge.
When you buy a new item, is it replacing something else? Put the old item in the bag. When something wears out, make sure it‚Äôs out of sight and out of mind so you‚Äôre not tempted to venture out in it out of convenience.
Pro tip: Create a system for getting rid of unwanted clothes in the future. Have a bag or clothes basket for unwanted clothes near the place where you keep your current rotation. https://t.co/EXqQ2dyXe9
