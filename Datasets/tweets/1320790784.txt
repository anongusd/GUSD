Well the American people are worried about Howard Schultz considering a presidential run. https://t.co/WiY91FmycX
But don’t worry! The midterm just happened, so there’s time. Their frustration about this will wane as the country/economy/world otherwise falls into chaos. Hopefully they’ll be too frustrated by other things in two years to even remember it. Congrats! You completed a #GOPTaxScam
Step 10: Talk down to those expressing frustration and try to make them feel stupid. Tell them it’s basic math. They will likely be too disappointed to bring up the fact that you had previously lied to them and said they were making more because of [trickle-down economics].
Step 9: Only now — after the midterm election — should you talk about the changes in the withholding tables. Tell people that they had less money withheld, so of course there is less money to refund.
Step 8: After the midterm election, another off-year will begin. Watch as people file their tax returns and realize that they have significantly smaller refunds. Tens of millions of Americans will unexpectedly OWE the IRS money.
Step 7: Message incessantly about how much more money people have. Assassinate the character of anyone who disagrees. Take all the credit. Ride the momentum into a midterm election.
Again, do not say the words “trickle-down economics” out loud.
Step 6: When asked why wages appear to have increased, do not mention the changes in withholdings. Instead, say that corporations have more money because of their tax cuts and are passing that money along via higher wages and lower prices because of course that’s how it works!
Step 5: After employers adjust withholdings based on the new guidelines, they will be withholding less money and paying employees more money. Point to this and say, “Wow you guys, look how much the middle class is benefitting!”
Step 4: Pass the tax bill at the end of an off-year before a midterm election. The timing here is crucial (see Step 7).
Step 3: Quietly restructure the withholding tables.
Step 2: Include a modest tax cut for the middle class that will expire after a number of years and reraise the taxes middle class Americans pay. Point to this initial cut as a reason the middle class should support the bill.
Step 1: Draft legislation to reward campaign donors and corporations with huge permanent tax cuts. When people ask how it will be paid for, point to the principles of trickle-down economics without actually saying the words “trickle-down economics” out loud.

@stokesbary @washdems Not really. If Republicans had prioritized the middle class, they would have (a) sought more middle class tax relief, and (b) carefully explained the results of the restructuring, instead of issuing vague and grandiose promises of more money for everyone.

There was never a need to “make America great again,” but I’ll give Donald Trump this: his inability to govern or lead has helped us prove to ourselves just how great we were already capable of being.
When we get to the ID check, and later the conveyor belt at the security checkpoint, it’s not the usual frustration and passive aggressive sighs.		It’s “Thanks for being here.”		And “I’m really glad you showed up to work today.”		And “Hang in there, we’re in this together.”
Flying during the longest government shutdown in US history has been an experience, and not in the way you might think. The security lines at SeaTac are longer than I’ve ever seen them, but everyone is calm and patient.

@cathymcmorris Meanwhile, DACA may not expire fully until March, but it's a rolling program and nearly 200 young people lose its protections every day. (Again, you guys should figure out how a calendar works.)
@cathymcmorris Pssst. You should probably figure out how a calendar works before tweeting this. CHIP funding deadline was September 30th. Embarrassing, huh? You're welcome.
@HouseGOP Wut? The Republican-controlled House is currently 109 days overdue to fund CHIP. Dems have been pleading with you to fund it each of those 109 days. Turning the lives of 9 million children into a bargaining chip because you refuse to pass a DREAM Act makes for pretty poor PR.
