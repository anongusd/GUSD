In 08 debates Sen Obama effectively used Clinton's Iraq vote against her. Others on stage happy reprise that tonight. #nprnews

Your morning paper from Cleveland. @NPR @nprpolitics http://t.co/N6RTUb6CBI
KASICH: I am for traditional marriage, but the court has ruled. I just went to the marriage of a close friend who happens to be gay.
We're at the halfway point of this debate. I has been very lively.
Jeb Bush defending Common Core standards: We aren’t going to compete in the world with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything.
"Thank you Megyn, I was wondering if I'd be able to talk again" Ben Carson after a long drought w/o getting a question.
Sen Rubio also declines offer to criticize Trump rhetoric tonight.
Gov Kasich declines to criticize Trumps rhetoric tonight.. ie "leaders are stupid" Kasich: "Trump has touched a nerve in this country."
Another vintage Trump moment when talking about immigration "Our leaders are stupid."
Jeb Bush acknowleged concerns about dynastic qualities of another Bush campaign for President.Says he'll earn peoples votes.
At the 22 minute mark the debate turns to the topic of immigration.
Trump on calling women "pigs" in certain instances. Reply:There's too much political correctness "Often what I say is fun and kidding"
Rowdy debate already. Thanks in part to Trump, who refused to say he won't run as a third party candidate if he's not the nominee.
RT @NPRrussell: For real-time details on the #GOPDebate, check out: @nprpolitics, @DomenicoNPR, @DonGonyea, @sarahmccammon, @JessicaTaylor …
@ProfHagle Agreed. A lot of us will be up late.
Correcting an earlier tweet. I said this early debate would end at 7. It has just ended at 6:20...  80 mins long.  Next one starts at 9pET.
7 candidates on stage for early debate. Pace very brisk. Feels like one big lightning round. Prime time will have 10 onstage.
Agreement across board in this early debate to repeal or tear up all Obama exec orders on day one as the new president.
In early debate Santorum asked if SCOTUS ruling mean same-sex marriage is settled law.	No, he says, this is a rogue supreme court decision.
This early debate ends at 7p. It's taking place in an empty basketball arena. There will be a packed house for prime time debate at 9pET
Perry dismissed Trump success as rooted in celebrity. Fiorina pointed to Trumps shifting views on abortion, immigration, healthcare.
The early GOP debate in Cleveland underway. Specific questions about Trumps success in polls from moderators to Perry and Fiorina.
