@FaireComments @jdickerson So you‚Äôre saying ask some women what they think the candidate means? I think it‚Äôs worth asking women and men what they think the candidate means. And listen to the candidate. https://t.co/1F7QmP2y4J
@FaireComments @jdickerson Candidates think seriously about the words they choose. It‚Äôs worth listening.
@FaireComments @jdickerson Words are used to convey standing on issues which is why I wondered whether people took it that way originally. The senator is now saying explicitly this is the message she‚Äôs trying to send. Anyone can talk about an issue. She‚Äôs arguing she has special standing.
@Kathmandu513 @jdickerson The senator doesn‚Äôt think so https://t.co/1F7QmP2y4J

@DeRushaJ @ZachHalverson @GayleKing I believe the only thing I mentioned is that if victims of sexual assault were upset by it enough to call the station in such numbers, that was worth taking into account.

@Hardline_Stance The sentence is not confusing. "any of the ‚Äúevents‚Äù in the Clinton marriage." So you're wrong about that and the time.
@ByronYork Who argues HRC's past isn't fair game? Politically risky, perhaps, less revealing than time at State perhaps, but not off limits
@Hardline_Stance the headline you link to and the story says 2 years. And the story says nothing about "any event"
@rapidcraft Cleverness that's what we like to see in the morning.
@verumserum Not things like teeenage years or health care. Also 2 yr. pause is still earlier in 16 cycle than Romney piece. 2/2
@verumserum Your last sentence in your penultimate graf is incorrect. My piece was about the Clinton marriage events only. Lewinsky etc.1/2
@PunditReview @instapundit You should embrace that healthy distrust but I can only answer for my own argument not an entire industry.
@instapundit That's a different claim than narrative control. If analysis is wrong &amp; @KarlRove &amp; @EdMorrissey are too then argue the case.
@PunditReview @instapundit If it's an INSANE claim I might wonder where it came from. This wasn't. Nor is the analysis so out of bounds.
@PunditReview @instapundit I make an assessment of someone's claims based on their argument first and foremost not a guess at motivation
@PunditReview @instapundit I see that @KarlRove made a similar argument. Judging the wisdom or folly of a strategy isn't narrative control
@PunditReview @instapundit Labeling an argument "narrative control" is cheap. It may be flawed; but that claim is a low shot at motive. 2/2
@PunditReview @instapundit Could be, but at the least it's debatable whether this is good politics now. 1/2
@PunditReview @instapundit Was Ed attempting narrative control when he made the same case here? http://t.co/mFoQWGDcIp
@PunditReview @instapundit The conclusion of the piece which is that it is politically risky &amp; less germane than other Clinton topics

@jackthecat11 I have no answer for you!
@misterjayem dunno. Good question.
Is this budget fight over Obamacare or not? http://t.co/InCtJGs47X
Is the fight over defunding Obamacare over or not? http://t.co/RpYHUM4BVT

@pittsburghed Removing Obamacare solves debt limit breach consequences? The analogy was about what happens after a breach.
@Sharpe222 Endless loop.
Obama says there could be a short debt limit increase while negotiations could take place. Key step for crazy fantasy http://t.co/Yfq7f0ehYG
@TropicsM Well, stay wary!
Why those moderates in the house voting for a clean CR or debt limit are hard to really count. http://t.co/mOXfyU7OnR
@TropicsM And are there more than one of  you or do you always refer to yourself in the third person?
@TropicsM Pretty You have a low bar for swooning.
@jimgeraghty then he'd be strengthened, no? Evidence of unity! And Evidence for argument that only presidential concessions can solve.
I only know of President's room in the U.S. Senate RT @MikeDrewWhat: @jdickerson Do you know of the "President's Room" in the U.S. Capitol?
@MikeDrewWhat Based on my reporting goal is to maximize his vote.He'll take a deal that gets a small majority of his conference over default
@NoahKaplan Hastert is majority of majority not majority votes only.
A way to negotiate without negotiating. A model for a debt limit exit that's been used before: http://t.co/Yfq7f0ehYG
@MikeDrewWhat you're suggesting maybe I should write about the underlying situation? I'm trying to divine your point.
@MikeDrewWhat I'm not sure what that means.
@johnmark sure that wasn't my colleague David?
@TropicsM in which context do you remember me swooning over Paul Ryan?
She couldn't get on http://t.co/An6jWkxPLb today either. http://t.co/otpFAa7dWp

@JRubinBlogger @blakehounshell  But Boehner made this argument BEFORE shut down. They didn't buy it.

@chrislhayes and then 3 months after.
@robertcostaNRO But how does that square with long-held view that conf-cmty is a place where principle goes to die?
@pfeiffer44 yes: playing with nuclear weapons not just matches. Though president constrained in special ways too.
@pfeiffer44 Seems like hand is weak on shutdown; potentially stronger on debt limit though risky! &amp; changing now that we're in shutdown
@CheriJacobus But if public opinion worked that way ACA would be popular and the president approval higher.
@philipilevy If that's what's behind the #'s that would be a consistency in their position making current view: 2 wrongs don't make a right
@DarrellGroves That would be great. We can dream!
