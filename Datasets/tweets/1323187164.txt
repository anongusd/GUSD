The fact that the Cohen hearings were happening at the same time as his earth-shattering meetings with Kim was unconscionable according to @realDonaldTrump ! I bet he’s happy now that he has something else to tweet about after the N Korean debacle.
If Senator Higgins hadn’t heard of Michael Cohen until the FBI rated his office, then he is too stupid to be a senator. I’m pretty sure even @FoxNews mentioned to Mr. Cohen’s name.
We know what he did wrong. He’s going to jail for those crimes. Repeating them over and over  doesn’t actually achieve anything. https://t.co/M6wdGq2xzd
