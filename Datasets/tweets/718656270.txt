@jonfitztv @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 According to that article we spend 1.35 trillion a year. So math might be off.

@lyttlePNW @charliekirk11 Does a wall stop you? It stops me. Dang a screen door stops me. A piece of plastic slows me down. So yes a 30 ft steel wall will stop and slow ppl down.
@lyttlePNW @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Then you are mistaken. It‚Äôs stops ppl from crossing easily. Pushes them to ports of entry. There is a real problem. Putting your head in sand doesn‚Äôt make it go away.

@Jimmy__Barbour @jonfitztv @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 It‚Äôll be so expensive 20 trillion. Makes the government cut costs. Means less salary. Means less workers. Means pretty much working for free. Cause taxes will go up also to pay for this. Also less discoveries bc no money. It‚Äôs a bad system.
@lyttlePNW @charliekirk11 Maybe. But functional.
@goaskkelly @charliekirk11 Why do you think education system bad? Or roads? It‚Äôs bc our system is being gloomy with illegals. Putting pressure on schools on roads on jails on everything. Think. Also no hunger issue we have obesity issue.
@jonfitztv @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 I don‚Äôt get OT. But what you don‚Äôt wanna spend 16 hrs of your life in school getting paid nothing. Like I did.

@Jimmy__Barbour @jonfitztv @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 It scare tactics. Real realized fears. Ask around. Ask a Canadian how long an mri takes to get. For a torn ACL. Ask an Englishman about dialysis. See what you get

@jonfitztv @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 I have same thing. Don‚Äôt cry about working. Work smart. Come up with idea and advance yourself. Get a degree that moves you forward. Don‚Äôt complain if you‚Äôre not trying to be better.
@jonfitztv @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Why would you go to er for flu shot? And why do you think it‚Äôs that expensive? Think.

@Jimmy__Barbour @jonfitztv @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yes. But you always have more users than givers. So you have millions using the system that thousands are paying for. How long you think that lasts? And when money runs low what they gonna do? Not expand coverage. Cut coverage. So no dialysis after age 56 - England.
@jonfitztv @Dreadno20131199 @Jimmy__Barbour @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Also don‚Äôt confuse federal government with state and local government. Different outcomes.
@jonfitztv @Dreadno20131199 @Jimmy__Barbour @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 So you‚Äôre happy with our current infrastructure? And want government to be a monopoly in healthcare?

@jonfitztv @Dreadno20131199 @Jimmy__Barbour @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Coming from guy wanting the government to run healthcare. Name 1 thing the government does well.
@jonfitztv @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 We have that now? Maybe, maybe not. More like not. How about over state line ability to purchase insurance?

@jonfitztv @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Ahh. That‚Äôs why? You right. You paying higher taxes on low income still not as much as insurance.

@charliekirk11 Why we giving them money when they allow easy passage to our country through theirs?
@therich88 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 That‚Äôs you‚Äôre version of a discussion?? Just for your benefit when dealing with thing typically the obvious answer is usually the correct one.
@therich88 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yicks. You seem to have some issues that aren‚Äôt solved with a simple solution. Creepy.
@eggsandbeer @charliekirk11 We can easily make laws and enforce them that will prevent visa overstays. Like government sells all your stuff and deports you if caught.
@therich88 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 No it‚Äôs true. Don‚Äôt have to over think issues. Think horses not zebras when hear hoof beats.
@Jimmy__Barbour @zorkmow @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yup the invention. But Bureaucrats decide who gets it.
@Jimmy__Barbour @zorkmow @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Efficient is definitely one way to call it. Question, who decides what‚Äôs elective? Is an mri in am 80 yo elective? Is a liver transplant is 70 yo elective? Who decides?
@zorkmow @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yes. They limit medical care.
That‚Äôs funny. https://t.co/RtVQOLB6e2
@zorkmow @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 No it doesn‚Äôt work. Don‚Äôt make stuff up. They have ‚Äúdeath panel‚Äù. Try getting an mri in any of those countries. Look up Canada too.

@zorkmow @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 No it doesn‚Äôt work bc ppl don‚Äôt work off being nice. They work off incentive, I.e money.  Single payer loses competition. You need to compete to be better. No one works out of goodness of their heart
@Jimmy__Barbour @zorkmow @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Cause they‚Äôre socialist. Pretty simple.
@mrssmith2018 @charliekirk11 They pay high above market value. Still a necessary evil.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Control that anger. You not drinking now right? Cause stay sober. That includes the drugs.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Good. Keep up being sober. I hope it‚Äôs true. Try yoga. Will help with hate and relax you more. Be well.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Good you‚Äôve learned to live with your anger. That‚Äôs good. Keep controlling it. Stop with the drugs and alcohol. Should be ok. Everything will be ok.
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 With China the manufacturing is big but not the elephant. The elephant the real purpose with tariffs is the intellectual property. China literally built off stealing our tech. Specifically now the 5g. That‚Äôs big military issue.
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Manufacturing jobs hits highest level in like 30 yrs last month. December with 312,000 jobs. Stellar number. Some shift I think happening.
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yea that was biggest problem. We have all these labor laws and taxes which make production costs so high. But I guess at some tariff those costs worth coming back to USA.
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 You see China only grew at 6.6%. I think tariffs shifting production back to states. Putting manufacturing pressure. Also going to Vietnam
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 They are my biggest fear. When media picks a side but says they are objective it‚Äôs very dangerous. Dictatorships are based off fake media. I wish that would be controlled. 90% negative coverage on trump via media. New study.
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yea he needs better overall expression of the idea but his recent speaks have shifted towards that. I‚Äôm just seeing a lot of ppl being negative without even listening. Just bc it‚Äôs trump. He has said will increase legal immigration. Just need to control illegal
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 See more anger. You got issues. Really. Is it drugs? Alcohol?
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 @AOC Haha. I‚Äôm sure we all agree AOC is an idiot. Ppl to sensitive. Crass is New York way. But he‚Äôs also great with ppl. If you see what ppl say about him that work with him, he‚Äôs charming they say.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 The cursing. The words. Very sad that you‚Äôre so broken.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Haha. Ok Michelle. You keep lovin‚Äô. Leave it the adults to take care of biz.
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 See I like the open speech. I highly dislike the political garbage. Talking out of both sides of the mouth. I want the truth. Even if it‚Äôs uncomfortable.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Got some anger dude. Should talk to someone about that. Homeless idiot.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Ahh. Another snowflake that has daddy issues and needs a hug. Sadly there are many of you. Idiot
@Drew_Brosenhaus @pbrowning1 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 I do disagree about the idiot part. He‚Äôs an ass but definitely not stupid. Political genius. Also I‚Äôm big fan of his trolling ability. It‚Äôs funny.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 That‚Äôs my line. Good one. Idiot. Homeless one at that
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Yup. That was easy. Found another one.
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 So you‚Äôre homeless?
@KevinKennedy002 @charliekirk11 Ok. Do you have walls to your house? 4 of them?

@CJackso36136041 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Exactly. I don‚Äôt get why ppl can‚Äôt believe a wall is a deterrent. Layers of protection. It has to be trump hatred. And willing to scarafice is all and our country. And theirs.

@zorkmow @Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 It‚Äôs limited healthcare. Small industry. Minimal research. Barely any scientific breakthroughs. It‚Äôs all about free market capitalism. Let competition lower prices. Let competition dictate costs. Get government out.

@samuel22wilson @dannielachance @westend999 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 I appreciate your input. Sadly it‚Äôs easier to con someone then convince them they been con‚Äôd. I don‚Äôt get where the gate comes from though. It‚Äôs all of our country together.
@Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 You are sadly incorrect. That system will cost many their lives and good care.
@laurenv963 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Then give your solution to 200,000 ppl crossing our border illegally. All about ideas.
@Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Most don‚Äôt want it. Simple for you cause want a father figure in your life - government. Want stuff for free. True that‚Äôs simple but not correct. I guess my first comment doesn‚Äôt work with you on this.
@Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 You have a lot to learn about government health care. You may mean well but it‚Äôll only end up with death and poor system.
@zorkmow @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Never said didn‚Äôt need wall. Just putting praise on Border patrols great job
@wienerbones @charliekirk11 Walls kinda basic. How would you phrase it?
@xaberlers Yep
@kurtbehrhaus @charliekirk11 Wasn‚Äôt to bad. Thanks for asking.
@EvelynBatts @charliekirk11 It‚Äôs an all of the above answer.

@Jimmy__Barbour @Dreadno20131199 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Means the simple answer usually the right one.
@MAADBrewing @MrPatriot17 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 See don‚Äôt you love free markets. You don‚Äôt have to see me. But I‚Äôll still treat you like everyone else. And give you that hug you need. ‚ùÑÔ∏è
@dannielachance @samuel22wilson @westend999 @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Yet your life better. Go figure that one out.
@Dreadno20131199 @Jimmy__Barbour @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 No they don‚Äôt actually. We trained where of you hear hoof beats don‚Äôt think zebra. It‚Äôs complicated don‚Äôt worry about it. üòÅ
@kurtbehrhaus @charliekirk11 Yup. That‚Äôs what happened in 2016 too. Ohh ohh no it didn‚Äôt. Sad face.
@MAADBrewing @MrPatriot17 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 See sadly you treat ppl based off ideology and skin color and gender. Obviously not a doctor or in medical field. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called patients, not the liberal in rm 101. Sad to see such hate from ppl.
@MAADBrewing @MrPatriot17 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Ahh come on snowflake. I‚Äôll give you the hug you never had. It‚Äôs ok.
@MAADBrewing @MrPatriot17 @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 You‚Äôre an interesting person brian haslip. Not in good way either.
@Jimmy__Barbour @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 Majority don‚Äôt. Also do you know what happens with single payer? No one gets treatment and get worse care bc have to ration. Not smart.
@kurtbehrhaus @charliekirk11 Ahhh. Should have just said so. I‚Äôll let them know. üëçüèª idiot.
@MrPatriot17 @MAADBrewing @jillmerc @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 It‚Äôs anything he does. These ppl so brainwashed. So buried in their hate that they willing to scarfice themselves just not to be proven wrong. It‚Äôs strange. It‚Äôs truest Trump derangement syndrome.
@Jimmy__Barbour @Michael10plus10 @charliekirk11 That‚Äôs most obvious one for you? The. You got a lot to learn. Simplest answer for that is let free market handle it. Get government out.
@MattWesterhoff @dloy113 @charliekirk11 Yea that‚Äôs the place. Look up effect of wall and bombing. You might be surprised. Also the Palestine‚Äôs protesting on their side. Why? Bc cant get past wall.
@kramos081566 @charliekirk11 No it is.
@jsvalenti1 @charliekirk11 It‚Äôs a basic highly effective basic idea. That can be built on.

@KamalaHarris Cool. Free Botox.
@Melinda62909033 I can‚Äôt keep it for myself. I have taxes to pay.

@TravelsteadJr @GeroARG @Reuters @BofA_News That evidence is created by scientist looking for funding from government that wanted those outcomes for their narrative. Listen to Weather channel founder. It‚Äôs all lies to yah money into corrupt politicians pockets - Al Gore.
@GeroARG @Reuters @BofA_News Say for arguement sake it‚Äôs true. How do you know it‚Äôs a negative impact not a positive one? You don‚Äôt know outcome of the changes in environment. Maybe ice bergs melt and maybe at same time more ppl or animals have access to water.
@KamalaHarris Have you posted anything about USA citizens that lost their loved ones to illegals. The angel moms and dads. Who do you represent exactly? Mexico? Russia? El Salvador?
@Melinda62909033 Do the poor even pay taxes? And that‚Äôs not true, you can send the irs a payment anytime. They sent it back bc you prob overpaid bill. Send another check to treasury. They take it happily.
@TravelsteadJr @GeroARG @Reuters @BofA_News What‚Äôs agw?
@GeroARG @Reuters @BofA_News That research done by bias scientist looking for funding. Computer models programmed by hkmans and wrong many times. You can‚Äôt have evidence. It‚Äôs impossible. The exposement is not reproducible. Best you have is a theory.
@GeroARG @Reuters @BofA_News I agree with the feee market will take care of it. But there‚Äôs no evidence that man accelerated it. No one can prove it. Bc it‚Äôs not reproducible. The movement to get money is a hoax in ppl. It‚Äôs a control approach and money making.
@GeroARG @Reuters @BofA_News Sure keep the world clean. I‚Äôm all about pollution reduction and recycling but at a certain cost. Not willing to close industries and fire ppl for it.
@Melinda62909033 What does that even mean? You think republicans the wealthy ones? You‚Äôre wrong. California, NY,Connecticut these Republican strongholds? FYI you got a tax cut too( if you actually pay taxes)

@dave73in @SenSanders Yea. When you bring in lots of low skilled labor that‚Äôs undocumented you don‚Äôt get wage growth. But look at the upper evils. The skilled force. Those prices increased a lot. 3% wage growth year or year now.
@JimPethokoukis It‚Äôs not ‚Äúhe has to win‚Äù, it‚Äôs the country has to win. These dems don‚Äôt want what‚Äôs best for America. They want power. Seen on Kavangh hearings.
@SenSanders Let‚Äôs make it $25/hr. No $50. No no $75/hr. But I‚Äôm curious, what‚Äôs happens when you raise the price on something??
@drobpix @ACTBrigitte Social programs are different than socialism. Don‚Äôt be a fool. We can‚Äôt have 5 police departments for 1 area. But we made this country great with capitalism. You work hard you keep what you earn. You then go and spend it on best item for the price. And so forth.
@drobpix @KamalaHarris Wow. So you‚Äôre for Socialism? You‚Äôre for a form of government that‚Äôs killed over 100 million ppl over last century? Do you know what socialism entails? If so I want you to go work and instead of saving your paycheck, give everyone $50.

@WendyT37167 @RealJamesWoods True. You prob right,sadly. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing there or who those ppl are but I wish could help him.
@drobpix @Sen_JoeManchin @GOP No. Congress never approved a wall or border fencing. They told him they would take it up if he signed the omnibus spending bill then never did. So now he‚Äôs not falling for that anymore.
@drobpix @KamalaHarris Ahh. So you don‚Äôt know what socialism is. Social programs like police and fire department is different than socialism where the state own everything or taxes it to oblivion
@drobpix @ACTBrigitte I think the issue I do and you don‚Äôt.
@drobpix @charliekirk11 New wall and repaired old fence being done. Checkout San Diego.
@drobpix @ACTBrigitte The left is now a socialist party. You a socialist?
@drobpix @charliekirk11 Haha. So the Tijuana. Order agents fighting off ppl is just Hollywood drama? Drugs and cartel aren‚Äôt coming over areas with no fence/wall? I think you have trump derangement syndrome. It‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôre not alone.
@drobpix @KamalaHarris Haha. Then what do you think.
@RealJamesWoods Fight back!!!!
@KamalaHarris Great. So we can expect all of the USA to be socialist soon??
@drobpix @KamalaHarris Is it? Is it really??

@sethmoulton Spoiler: you probably stole the money. Also you didn‚Äôt give any reason why you didn‚Äôt.
@MereteVonDOE @XStrategiesDC Probably true. That was for different reason. That was bc demand dropped. This time it‚Äôs bc supply high.

@Steve_Yo_ @SenSanders You‚Äôre stuck on medical costs for some reason. It‚Äôs really not that expensive if you don‚Äôt have insurance. FYI. A random middle aged healthy person male or female can gets labs every 6 months for like $200. A doctor another $150.

@H2Ogirl11 @RasNospam @sethmoulton Maybe tunnels were dug. Maybe the fence isn‚Äôt a wall. Maybe not updated fence. But having to dig is a deterrent non the less.

@RealCandaceO Men seem so weak. I completely agree with you. It‚Äôs offensive to have a man be a man. Or even say that. CraZy.
@SenJeffMerkley Oh so now we can choose what the government spends our money on?? Well why didn‚Äôt you say so. Cause I‚Äôll cut your salary, thank you very much.
@SenSanders Lol. And let me guess that person would be you. A socialist.
@DavidlBennettII @dbongino Ok mr. dictionary. Supposed to say ‚Äúnarcissism that‚Äù. Others seem to get it but I guess you needed a little more help.
@CGasparino Jealous jealous man.

@NYGovCuomo You do when you raise the price of something you‚Äôll get less of it. So get ready for low skill job loses. Mostly to tech.
@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino Oh so you‚Äôre a turn the other cheek kinda ‚Äúguy‚Äù. Sure. I‚Äôd feel very safe with you. NOT!! FYI ppl don‚Äôt respect weakness.
@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino Hahah. To funny. Maybe you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt stand up for yourself. But others, like strong men, will fight back. Will make sure lies aren‚Äôt spread. Have you watched CNN coverage? It‚Äôs 90% negative.
@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino Hence he can‚Äôt. Term limits. Problem that you have and other liberals is you take thought and ideas way out of control. Just cause someone says something doesn‚Äôt mean anything will happen.
@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino Maybe. Or maybe you have teach the aggressor a lesson so they don‚Äôt bother you or anyone else in future. Can‚Äôt keep being scared to fight back.
@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino It‚Äôs not bullying if it‚Äôs retaliation. That‚Äôs called standing up for yourself. Fighting back. But who you want instead of trump?

@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino I hope he does cut them. His presidency isn‚Äôt up yet for you to say hasn‚Äôt kept promise. Just curious who you want for prez? Or voted for?

@leochner1 @Christi77929362 @dbongino Yup again now NYT. Also again even on headline. Trump responds to ppl mocking him. You don‚Äôt seem to understand standing up for yourself. You were def bullied.

@Got1milk @SenSanders A little bit of an answer but really just agreeing with someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs ideas ( mine)
@Got1milk @SenSanders Still no answer here either.
@Got1milk @SenSanders Still no answer here.
@Got1milk @SenSanders Still no answer here from you.
@KamalaHarris Get rid of minimum wage. You‚Äôll employee more ppl which will get them into work force so they can move up the ladder.
@Got1milk @SenSanders If one decrease the pool of low skill cheap labor, I.e immigration control. then you can increase wages. Bc of less supply.
@Got1milk @SenSanders Wages are not stagnant for upper income earners. That‚Äôs bc we are an advancing society and low skill worker pool increase a lot faster. (Less time in school) and illegal immigration
@Got1milk @SenSanders Yes this has been the issue with wage growth which only now rising. It‚Äôs because of lots of low skilled labor which drives prices down. Lots of supply. I wonder how to decrease lots of low skilled labor from taking all jobs?? Which would then increase wages due to lack of supply
@Got1milk Never heard of ‚Äútime-restricted dieting‚Äù. If you eat slower the stomach will send impulse that you are full and one stops eating. For biome benefit from cultured yogurts and fiber.
@Got1milk @SenSanders Post your answer to the issue.
@Got1milk @SenSanders Wages are up 2.5% year over year. Do you want to set a fee schedule?
@Got1milk @SenSanders I also haven‚Äôt seen any explanation from you about lowering the gap. You just a complainer? Like a nag in the background?
@Got1milk @SenSanders How do you get ride of cigarettes? Or make ppl use less of something? You increase the cost of that item. Supply demand. More expensive less ppl can afford it. Same for jobs. I‚Äôll hire less ppl if it‚Äôs to expensive. Kinda basic.
@Got1milk @SenSanders Number one- get rid of minimum wage. Then give tax incentives to businesses that hire more employees. That gives more tax breaks to small biz, which in turn makes ppl that own their biz make money. So more rich.
It‚Äôs the worst part. Sad. https://t.co/Lc2taTCEHf
@SenSanders Maybe if you made playing field less socialist and more capitalist it work itself out.
@quackerusa @SenSanders You should actually take a look and understand how the system works. Also compare us to other nationals. Ppl in USA richer than others.

@jonnajarian @CNET Yet they don‚Äôt mandate helmets or safety gear. If we the ppl gonna be paying for these ‚Äúbroken‚Äù ppl, we should demand proper safety gear be worn during use.
@KamalaHarris How about ppl move up in work place? Get education and get higher paying jobs??
@SenFeinstein Elections have consequences!!!! Hahahaha
@RealCandaceO Please explain it to me too. It‚Äôs crazy. Should be examined. I‚Äôm Jewish white American. They literally vote for ppl that want to kill us. Nutz!!!!
@RepJoeKennedy Is there anything else in your world other than race? Asking for a friend.
@SenSanders So fighting for terorrists is the new thing??? Yemen??!!! Do you even know the ppl that live there. They want to kill you an American Jew. Stop being self hating.
@benshapiro No Chopin
@benshapiro It‚Äôs raising prices on items COMING to USA not in USA. I think a little mixed up. Actually makes more jobs in USA.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with you?? Have you lost it? Or the liberal disease infected you. If USA gives them subsidies they better move their plants to USA. No Mexico no Canada.
@SenFeinstein Yea San Fran what a great city. Where you can your heroin injected for you for free and then play in human poop on the street. So great.
@JimPethokoukis What a stupid comment. He‚Äôs pushing for the American worker. If the company can afford it with tax break and incentives then more jobs. Prez didn‚Äôt tell anyone. Do you want USA to fail?
@JimPethokoukis I don‚Äôt understand you . What don‚Äôt you get? He‚Äôs gonna try to break them economically with tariffs. Trade deal needs to be done but can‚Äôt negotiate from weakness. Soften them up first.
@GeraldoRivera Go down there and give them all your money and shirt off your back if you‚Äôre so holy. Fake person. What happened to you??
@RepJoeKennedy You‚Äôre an idiot. Who‚Äôs family killed a girl and got away with it.
@GeraldoRivera Screw you Geraldo. What you talking about?? Then donate your salary and go live with them in Guatemala.
@SenAngusKing How you gonna change it? And make sure it‚Äôs changing for right good reason. Maybe climate change creating something better - you don‚Äôt know what your against.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt like it then change the laws. Dems very good at towing the line. @realDonaldTrump must have learned from somewhere. Snowflake
@RyanAFournier And poof, no more bill Nelson.
@RepJoeKennedy So racist. Only white ppl in pic. No diversity in your family. Probably must hate ppl of color. Sad.
@SenSanders Have you donated money to Walmart employees? Or let them stay at any of the multiple houses you own(given by Clinton to drop out of 2016) ??? All talk. No action. Usual socialist
@jonnajarian @petenajarian Nice!!!
@realDonaldTrump me and my family are very thankful for you and you‚Äôre families sacrifices. Thank you for working hard for free and saving us from liberals/socialists. Happy thanksgiving.
@ShannonBream You forgot extremely pretty too.
@BretBaier It was good, as usual. Still do segment ‚Äúwhatever happened to‚Äù. Can you do education part to show?
@MZHemingway you are consistently the smartest and most pragmatic one on any show. Thank you. Keep up strong work.
@thehill ‚ÄúTorches‚Äù. You guys are so bias and fake news. Sad face.
@RealCandaceO @BillClinton @HillaryClinton Kinda shows that they are stupid. Or have Stockholm syndrome.
@andrewzimmern @wapo Are you that stupid??? That blinded by hate? Sad man you are. Do you even know what happened? Putz
@RepJoeKennedy Are you defending Yemen and the terrorists??? Wow. Selling out USA for political purpose. Sad.
Finally!!!! https://t.co/RXaMRhfzBp
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity why nothing with investigations with Hillary. Been 2 yrs. why nobody questioned and prosecuted. Ask plz. Thank you.
@SenFeinstein You do realize that majority of workers in USA have 401k or some form of. And 401ks are linked to market. Just saying you‚Äôre dumb and old.
@BofA_Help Do not go with B of a. They don‚Äôt respect longtime clients. They don‚Äôt care. See what Chase or Wells Fargo has to offer
@SenFeinstein You can‚Äôt be serious?? Maybe that Chinese driver of yours brainwashed you.

@DLoesch @DanCrenshawTX Soon as question liberals they start floundering and making no sense.
@JimPethokoukis That‚Äôs not accurate. You‚Äôre only saying half. It‚Äôs FREE trade. If only one side free then not fair. You should advocate free trade equally to both sides. If not tariffs.
@PrisonPlanet Amazing. Maga!!!
@JimPethokoukis Cause dems took house? Probably.
@andrewzimmern @thehill @VP So the president with most amount of conferences of any president is obstructing press. The most transparent administration is obstruction. Are you that stupid??? Do you even follow politics or just follow someone else. Sheep üêë. Weak man.

@JenGriffinFNC I guess now yelling at judges in court room is part of my first amendment rights. And now anyone can get a White House press pass. So we just giving into mob mentality
@RepJoeKennedy Wow. Talk about taking away civil rights. Engbody else see this. Scary.
Wow. Just that blatant bias. https://t.co/CNzlLJbh4m
@KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @DevinNunes do something about this invasion on border. Imagine 50,000 ppl rushing border. It be overrun and we‚Äôd lose San Diego. STOP it now !!!! This is serious.
@SenBobCasey By why is unemployment at near all time low?? And there‚Äôs over 7 million jobs available. I mean you know your lying for political purpose. Sad.
@JimPethokoukis You could give tax breaks for private industry to do the projects. I think trump did that for low income areas.
@SenSanders How is this not divisive? It‚Äôs talking out both sides of mouth. Should resign for these comments.
@jonnajarian I guess maybe not bad if they get more in return. Supposed to be $100,000+ salary. Plus increase in real estate. Should be win.
@SenBlumenthal So ppl with real pain should suffer bc of drug addicts committing crimes. Got it.
@SenSanders @RepRoKhanna Forcing private companies to do pay more. Seems oddly like fascism
@stephenfhayes It‚Äôs annoying that you put POTUS always in negative spotlight. Those are ideas that are in works. Ideas that need to be worked on to execute. Wall started. Parade should happen. Birthright citizenships should end. It‚Äôll get there.
@SenSchumer You‚Äôre a fool
@realDonaldTrump Lol. Amazing sir. I support and stand with you. MAGA!!
@SullyCNBC What do you think next step? Does Powell blink? Does China? No talk of inflation but if Powell stops or drops rates you‚Äôd prob see gold shoot up.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Why? Why should USA be the big brother and then when insulted give back more? No. From now on, realize the game. Realize the penalties for disobedience. No longer world punching bag.
@JonahNRO Who knows. Unless you are there say in and day out you‚Äôll never know.
@SenMarkey Oh so you want war. See Democrats are advocating for war.
@charliekirk11 Scary is that those ppl don‚Äôt realize they are running from a state that they voted dems in. Will not learn lesson or understand it then vote same way and ruin the red state. Gov abbot tweeted same concern.
@benshapiro Capitalism baby !!!
@KamalaHarris Go screw yourself. Trying to give away my and other Americans country for votes. You should be impeached and kicked out of office due to insighting fraud.
@andrewzimmern Hold on. You get the same classified info as POTUS?? Listen you pos. Your party corrupted the process. You‚Äôre a fake. A follower. I don‚Äôt get Jews that are against their own survival interest. You‚Äôre a traitor to Jews. Should be ashamed.
@andrewzimmern @AnnCoulter Your comment makes no sense. What we supposed get from this?? Loser
@SebGorka A Frenchman that‚Äôs not patriotic. Now the world is a goner.
@AlanDersh Hello sir. Don‚Äôt you get upset and disappointed by seeing these ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù molest the law? My dads big fan can he call you with questions? He an attorney.

@NYGovCuomo Ohh so you‚Äôre for illegal border crossing?
@andrewzimmern @mkraju Are you that blind and I‚Äôm the desk corner?? Stop being so bias and saying you‚Äôre not. Acosta was rude and then put his hands on a female intern. Fired!!!
@GregAbbott_TX Thank you. But I think they can‚Äôt find the association between how they vote and why they fleeing. It‚Äôs like a disease. Keep Texas red.
@CGasparino @Acosta @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @POTUS Acosta did touch her. He swiped his hand down on her arm when she reached for the mic. Are you saying he didn‚Äôt?

@RepJoeKennedy @HouseDemocrats You do realize that Medicaid is free to ppl that is paid for by someone else? That‚Äôs courageous standing up? Guess what I‚Äôm standing up for you giving me $100 everyday. I‚Äôm a trailblazer.
@andrewzimmern You post and support candidates that push socialist agenda. Medicare for all, higher taxes, more government programs and gun confiscation is socialism. You can be centered and create a legacy. Extremes are never good.
@BreitbartNews She‚Äôs an idiot. Trump derangement syndrome
@andrewzimmern Don‚Äôt believe socialist lies. Vote Republican vote capitalism. It‚Äôll make you and your family rich.
@BreitbartNews Racist. Why not Mexico??? ü§î
@VenkatR78617813 @benshapiro The point trying to make is that ppl like Cortez function in an environment that they are used to. It‚Äôs not an empty space. They use current system thinking it‚Äôll stay the same when they try to adjust it.
@benshapiro She doesn‚Äôt get it. None on the left do. That the system they are functioning in is the system that allowed to do what they do.
@ASavageNation No. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. If you give a little they want more Bc they now know their approach works. You keep winning not worrying about others sides mob mentality.
@GeraldoRivera What are you talking about. Racist?? Stop being a liberal. Are you only sympathetic Bc the caravan is of Latin origin?? That‚Äôs racist.
@dbongino Thank you. I asked for this.
@stephenfhayes But he does give very intellectual responses. @DineshDSouza
This is why one should vote Republican. We don‚Äôt do this to ppl. We aren‚Äôt communists. https://t.co/dLZLAFjtKN
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump @BLEXIT Utter garbage. Sitting high on their pedestal. Thinking they better. Guess what, we better. These ppl should remember karma is a mother. I hope she finds more work than she can handle.
@jaketapper @ScottWapnerCNBC Wow. You got him. You must be so proud. Drain the swamp.
@SenFeinstein You know nothing about economics. But you do know how to enslave ppl.
@RealJamesWoods Yes. Keep your emotions in check. If you can‚Äôt be ready for the punishment. Jail or getting your a$&amp; kicked
@RealJamesWoods It seems similar to what I hear happened to Detroit.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with you?? There is an army of ppl coming towards us and you wanna just sit on your hands? What happened to you? Madness
@CGasparino And yet you seem to vote democrat. You are one confused soul.
@RealJamesWoods I asked same question. I don‚Äôt think so sadly. Just wants power so much willing to sacrifice us all.
Wow. Just wow. That‚Äôs a lot of good high paying jobs. And more to come. https://t.co/3y5s08etwf

@RealCandaceO @BLEXIT you single handed (of course with help) have destroyed the Democrat party. Thank you for exposing truth.

Got some real anger built up. Can‚Äôt give them power https://t.co/WG2HZokJ1m
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs sad to see this in USA senate. How did the ppl of mass elect you?? It‚Äôs nuts. You do nothing good for them or ppl of USA.
@SenFeinstein Then go there and help them. Don‚Äôt bring that nonsense to USA.
@andrewzimmern Vote Republican and help keep us moving forward. So many jobs. So much money we all making. Don‚Äôt ruin it. Vote Republican
@SenSchumer Hahah. Keep trying ‚Äúcrying chuck‚Äù. So bad. Only wants harm to USA. Get him out.
@andrewzimmern Arpaio is a man of the law. The laws required him to release that pos. You‚Äôre such a tool. Stop trying to hurt this nation with your jewish guilt.

@JimPethokoukis @CapEconUS Where‚Äôs the argument tariffs won‚Äôt work? Or trade negotiations will kill Econ? They will but we had a lot of pent up growth released by deregulation. For now we can compensate for increased cost. How long? What other attack vs chine do we have ?
@SenMarkey Please get this guy out of office. It‚Äôs scary how easily willing to give away country sovereignty.
@SenWarren Sounds oddly familiar to 2008-2009 resin of crash. Democrats trying to game the system. Horrible.
@JonahNRO Quite opposite actually. I don‚Äôt think you will ever get it. He‚Äôs winning, you‚Äôre being forgotten. Think about it.
@CGasparino Well you rarely say anything good about the prez of his admin. So yes you‚Äôre a dope.
@clayranck @JimPethokoukis Oh. Then you‚Äôve misunderstood him. It‚Äôs not jewish rulers, it‚Äôs Soros. Who‚Äôs a self hating Jew.

@KamalaHarris You‚Äôre gonna raise taxes and make it harder to do business.
@KamalaHarris Who‚Äôs paying for that? Who‚Äôs working that much? Not enough doctors, nurse, etc to take care@of all those ppl. Soooo expensive. You‚Äôre gonna raise taxes.

@dxza33 Stop being a fool. It‚Äôs has been up over that time. And amazing over last 100 yrs. but policy drives growth. Obama had bad policy - Econ down. Trump has pro growth policy - Econ good. It all comes from the top.
@dxza33 Dude you have no idea how the economy works. This is easy to see. The economy doesn‚Äôt just go up and down on auto pilot. It‚Äôs controlled. By policy which then allows growth. And making and spending of money.
@dxza33 What level of school you finish? Cause that‚Äôs the stupidest answer anyone could have given. Then what‚Äôs Venezuela‚Äôs excuse? Or Cuba? President dictate how the economy goes. Trump did all this. With his de regulation. His tariffs. He‚Äôs tax law. Learn something.

@dxza33 Florida. I don‚Äôt mind speaking with you either. Where you?
@dxza33 It was a lie. They knew it was a lie. We the American ppl were lied to so the admin wouldn‚Äôt look bad before election it‚Äôs not a war zone. It was poorly managed. Also they were pushing guns to rebel‚Äôs in Syria.
@dxza33 Why he forced to say something nice?  McCain back stabbed him
@dxza33 What is wrong with you? It‚Äôs about the deaths but more so about how handled. The fact that support wasn‚Äôt called in. The fact that the ambassador asked for assistance before that night and was denied. The fact that they blamed a video which was a lie.
@dxza33 I mean you can‚Äôt be serious. Hrc didn‚Äôt pick up phone when called. No support sent. There was a report which showed extensive mismanagement. Emails are still being investigated and we now know Strzok and comey pardoned hrc. Plz, it‚Äôs embarrassing.
Exactly. It‚Äôs such a swamp. But they prob have dirt on Sessions. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs scared. https://t.co/kDCwOFasfb

@RonWyden @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Wow. So for some cheap gas you‚Äôre willing to put USA and world in danger. Good one. üëçüèª. #DrainingTheSwamp
@SenSchumer Let me remind you Flynn railroaded. Russian company doesn‚Äôt exist. Russians showed up to court to fight charges. Manafort for a 2005 tax issue. Nothing to do with 2016. #DrainTheSwamp
@JimPethokoukis That‚Äôs a strange comment you made. I‚Äôm not sure how to take it.
@OpieSquish @Publix Of course. Unfortunately there is a generation feeling entitled and wanting everything for free. No appreciation for what they have.
@playnogamespls @Publix @PublixHelps I don‚Äôt think management understands ppl today and what we want. They see stuff on tv and try being ‚Äúcool‚Äù thinking this is what ppl want.
@KyleKashuv Don‚Äôt ruin a good story with the truth.
@NYCMayor How long would it take to make your salary??
@RealCandaceO Keep up the good fight. I thought the war was lost but seems like USA woke up and made some right(pun intended) decisions.

@Publix maybe you‚Äôll listen to the ppl that actually spend money at your stores. I won‚Äôt be anymore, was my fav too. #BoycottPublix. Weak management.
@dbongino But I ask. Why haven‚Äôt there been any arrests?? The evidence is overwhelming. Why nothing?? Plz explain.
@CGasparino Really ny times?? Dude you are sinking low. Also I don‚Äôt think youve posted 1 thing positive about trump. Yet say you‚Äôre non-partisan. Wack.
I grew up near those studies. It‚Äôs frightening now. https://t.co/sS95uSphz9
@SenMarkey Such a dumb comment on your half. You‚Äôre a congreeman. You should be upset that he needs this much security. You should be bashing ppl trying to hurt a cabinet member. #DrainTheSwamp that‚Äôs you
@davspence @DRUDGE_REPORT I stand corrected. The ones below Nickelodeon. Lol
@DRUDGE_REPORT There go those ratings
@andrewzimmern @TomiLahren Wow. That‚Äôs the first common sense thing you have said ever.
@andrewzimmern You‚Äôre a fool. You‚Äôre a liberal wanna-be cool kid. You say the dumbest things.
#winning and I‚Äôm not sick of it https://t.co/bA8sQatlFt
@SenMarkey @VP You shouldn‚Äôt be giving any advice about negotiating. #irandeal. Your prior negotiating with NoKo. The worst. #DrainTheDemocratSwamp
@Lexus not sure what problem is with Lexus but something is off. No help. No communication. If don‚Äôt need their cars dont get one. Horrible customer service.
@Lexus do not use Lexus. Do not buy a Lexus. This is bs. Trying to transfer lease and all you get is run around and delays. Not worth it. I‚Äôm just in to deep.
@SenMarkey Wow. You have no courage. Weak man. You prob give in so easy.
@CGasparino Umm. Unemployment all time low. Open jobs all time high. Where is this loss of productivity and job cutting??
@DiamondandSilk Democrat a hypocrite?? I don‚Äôt believe it. Haha. Of course they are. Sorry you strong ladies go through this. Keep up the best fight. Ty.
@JonahNRO @DavidLimbaugh Do any of you ppl questioning trumps character actually know him?? Or just what we see on tv? Bc I see a strong character that keeps his word. Stands up to ppl trying to put him down. Raised great kids who typically are a representation of the parents.
Don‚Äôt forget Hamas. https://t.co/CGDmseXQP6
@SenSchumer Haha. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Democrats saying trump caused healthcare price rise. Have you looked at what you‚Äôve done to this country?? Idiot. Maga. #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp
@SenMarkey You really have no idea how Econ works. And you make policy. No wonder USA crashing.
@benshapiro True. 500 million will make anyone smart. But the think the damage has been done.
@SenSchumer @GoldmanSachs Is that what you‚Äôd want?? Something to hurt Americans so you can claim victory. Sad. You should be on USA side.
@jonnajarian Same with California and NY. Plus this new law proposed in Cali about free health care to illegals, only means higher taxes and more fleeing.
What is California‚Äôs end goal? Venezuela as role model? How much can you give without taking as much or more in? I hope Californians wake up and realize that there is a better way.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan Ahhh you‚Äôre upset something is partisan. So sad. Did you go to the classified bipartisan meeting today to be. Rigged on ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù
@NYGovCuomo That‚Äôs awesome. Creating more voters for yourself since you‚Äôre losing them by the truck load.
@NYGovCuomo @RockefellerInst Question is, if it comes back as something you don‚Äôt agree with will you follow the recommendations. Careful what you wish for.
@SenSchumer You‚Äôre a fool. #DrainTheSwamp
@SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump You do realize USA is a big player in energy ??? That‚Äôs jobs. That‚Äôs taxes. That‚Äôs a better life for each citizen. Gosh you‚Äôre so stupid and bias. So anti-America.
@KyleKashuv Never lessen yourself Bc others can‚Äôt keep up. You fight till the end. Get those A‚Äôs. Strong work.
@SenMarkey @GOP Trying to make trump look bad Bc gas prices higher. Guess what ppl can afford more Bc they have JOBS. Ya know the things democrats like yourself couldn‚Äôt create.
@SenMarkey @GOP Umm. Releasing o from reawrvwbwould lower price since more in market. I Econ isn‚Äôt a Democrats strong suit but that ones easy.
@SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump Haha. You don‚Äôt understand anything do you?? Rising gas prices are a symptom of better economic growth. Dumbass politicians.
@katekelly @nytimes Wow. So crazy. Haha. Really? Big deal. Hillary paid for a fake document with Russians and English spy. Also, collusion not illegal.
@CGasparino Plz stop your nonsense. You‚Äôre fully aware that spying on a political opponent for no reason other than gaining inside information is inappropriate and probably illegal depending on how done. You are SWAMP.
@SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre an idiot. How you get elected ? I‚Äôm sure next time you‚Äôll be out.
@andrewzimmern @leballs Haha. Exactly. The swamp didn‚Äôt indict cause they‚Äôd all go to jail. Hold on to your communist pants cause trump will clean house and place all those traitors in jail. Thanks for mentioning some additional illegal activities by Clinton‚Äôs.
@leballs @andrewzimmern So you‚Äôre bias? You just assumed something based off the person. That‚Äôs bigotry. I‚Äôm offended.
@leballs @andrewzimmern Wow. Just wow. No crime committed with Hillary but for trump is a felon. Go back and read the story about the investigation. Fox News hannity goes through it in detail.
@leballs @andrewzimmern Are you on the same planet?? Hillary wasn‚Äôt even investigated. That‚Äôs issue at hand. They exonerated her before even questioning. Not under oath. Are you even real or a Russian bot. Cause you stupid.
@leballs @andrewzimmern Ty.  I Am of the same gene pool. No. Crime should be investigated and punished accordingly. You agree right? Cause Hillary and the gang waiting for their day in court.
@dxza33 Sorry.  It did happen. That‚Äôs not even disputed. Now only question is how far it go and who ordered it to happen. You live a world you wish, not the real world. Listen and learn.
@Aloysius50John @andrewzimmern And it was 1.5$ billion. Plus 10 million bc of currency conversion Bc it was illegal to give it in USA dollars.
@Aloysius50John @andrewzimmern WTH is wrong with you?? Really. They released 150$ billion back to them. Sold back to them? You dumbass, they bought company that mined for us. Fool. Can‚Äôt fix stupid.
@andrewzimmern Umm. Hey dumbass. No one indicated or convicted for anything to do with the campaign. Muller indicating non existent companies. Are you paying attention? Maybe read more than your fake news media.
@1tonymac1 @andrewzimmern @BarackObama Yup. I really believe that liberalism, which somehow always goes into communism is a disease of the mind. He‚Äôs a patient with the dz. although now he‚Äôd prob want free health care for it.
@Aloysius50John @andrewzimmern Oh. Whew. That‚Äôs for your brilliant comment. I‚Äôm sure everyone proud of you. Dumbass.
@andrewzimmern @maggieNYT What are you talking about??? There is no collusion, even your communist friends know that now. You‚Äôre a fool. Blinded by something which doesn‚Äôt make sense. Like a disease.
@TheDemocrats Haha. Democrats so funny. Democrats like children. No new ideas. No concept of what works to make ppl better. But do know how to hurt ppl. When is crazy Maxine Waters resigning?
@andrewzimmern You‚Äôre an idiot. You just proved the point that the highest level of government officials knew about the spying on political opponent. Dumbass.
@dxza33 So spying on political opponent is ok with you? Using high levels of government to oppress or intimidate individuals for political gain is ok with you? What can you possibly see different? These are facts.
@dxza33 I don‚Äôt understand. Do you even know what this is about? Can you comprehend anything past your anger. And small brain of course.
@realDonaldTrump Yes. Go get them. Those pos deep state. Not in our house.
@andrewzimmern Again you fool. What does this have to do with anything if true. Obama sold Russian uranium and gave Iran 150 billion to kill Jews. STOP being a useful idiot.
@CGasparino @FoxNews @stevenmnuchin1 That‚Äôs what prez said from beginning. Say one nice thing about the prez. Swamp scum.
@andrewzimmern You‚Äôre an idiot. And you keep proving yourself to be a ‚Äúuseful idiot‚Äù.
@kdlewis04 It‚Äôs always hard to reflect and see your true self. Also he‚Äôs an idiot swamp pos. I‚Äôm just as hard on him as others. That sob.
@BillKristol Wow. Just wow. Your head must be spinning trying to figure out a way to spin this so that you can still just go after trump. You‚Äôre a traitor. Swamp. Go away.
@CGasparino @WSJ Didn‚Äôt they agree to purchase $350 billion in USA goods to lessen the deficit? How about reporting that. Swamp.
@andrewzimmern You do realize that Washington post owned by Bezos and guess what ceo of Amazon. You don‚Äôt see anything fishy here, you tool?
@NYGovCuomo Tell him about how you‚Äôre giving our country away, that he fought for, to illegals Bc you think they‚Äôll vote for you. Tell him.
@NYGovCuomo Nice pool. Show the pick of you with all the refugees at your pool. And in your house.

@SherryBayes @SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump Yup. Gotta watch out. They‚Äôll get ya.
@cvpayne Isn‚Äôt that a racist comment?
@SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs war. War. Women suffering so much. Omg. Help!!! Oh wait didn‚Äôt trump just elect first woman cia Director. Wasn‚Äôt the first woman prez campaign winner trumps?  Isn‚Äôt his sec of press a woman? War. War on women.

@RichardHaass @andrewzimmern @realDonaldTrump Nope. Trying to get 1 country to join let alone 10 to do something would be impossible. China would chest but blame would be on USA. Nope. Go after China for stealing our stuff. Funny how Zimmerman thinks he knows anything. Dumbass.

We as Americans should be able to guard our boarders. Speak how we want. Say what we want. And keep the money we earn. I shouldn‚Äôt be scared to say something Bc then I‚Äôm labeled a racist or sexist or whatever else one might be offended by.

@JonahNRO I love the assumption that he isn‚Äôt getting any help. If something goes wrong you only gonna blame him anyways.
@larryelder @POTUS That‚Äôs a great idea actually.
@HouseDemocrats @RepSpeier @RepHuffman @RepThompson ‚ÄúWorking‚Äù. Haha. Dems only work to steal money from the real workers. These idiots don‚Äôt know work if it was right in front of them. Yea pass another bill to ban drilling so costs go up on the real workers. Fools.

@AmericanAir I fly American but that action is sad. She told me I didn‚Äôt need to get back for medical help. She said she could waive the fee but wouldn‚Äôt. What‚Äôs up with that American air???
@AmericanAir manager ms. Williams at Durham station told me that she doesn‚Äôt care about my medical condition to help me get back home sooner. Tells me I‚Äôm not sick. No medical experience in her background. I just asked to waive change fee.
I don‚Äôt get it. Do ppl not realize that only good citizens follow rules? So if you take away law abiding citizens guns only the bad ppl will have them. So yea. We‚Äôd be a sitting duck for criminals. It‚Äôs common sense

@andrewzimmern You‚Äôre an idiot. Stop protecting the criminals. You‚Äôre friends are dirty. They used government agencies to turn us into 3rd world dictatorships. You‚Äôre a blind useful idiot.
@larry_kudlow I think you‚Äôre over estimating other countries abilities. They already charge us heavily. The market will adjust. But we can‚Äôt allow dumping and killing our industry, that‚Äôs not free market.
@kilmeade @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump The democrats fighting for women right hurt and tried to destroy a woman working in dream job.
@HouseDemocrats Not true. 88% get tax break. Top 1% just pays the most in taxes so get bigger break. Makes sense if you don‚Äôt use class warfare.
@benshapiro Come on. There‚Äôs always been a trade war. They tax us but we can‚Äôt do same. Why not? We are the big boys why let ourselves get taken advantage of?
@andrewzimmern You really are that dumb and loyal. The dnc Hillary and obama admin are all Dirty. It‚Äôs clear as day but yet your still a loyal servant.
@JimPethokoukis But has it outlived purpose?
@realDonaldTrump do not mess with 2 A. No due process, come on. That‚Äôs a mess up. I‚Äôm big fan but remember why we vote for you. Why blaming guns when was evil person??
@RealJamesWoods Yea. I like Carl on CNBC and I think of him as a real journalist. But that‚Äôs just a stupid post.
@benshapiro I‚Äôm a big fan but yea that‚Äôs not a glowing moment. I have to assume he knows what he‚Äôs doing. I just still don‚Äôt get how NRA is a fault.
@Bourdain What does this have to do wit anything?? Don‚Äôt you see how stupid this idea is? Let ppl with Ebola into the country. Wow. Suicidial.
@NYGovCuomo @BetsyDeVosED Let me ask you, is that the play? You blame corporations, try to get sympathy vote from ppl. Let me ask you, who gave that money loan to begin with? You just blame company. Maybe blaming the loan takers for picking easy majors and not having job. ?
@ReformedBroker The response to President Trump was ‚Äú not even close‚Äù. That was the response and you say that‚Äôs fact? You‚Äôre an idiot bias communist.

@CMSGov plz address hospital privileges for doctors. They‚Äôre cumbersome and wasteful of time and talent. Docs resteict dncrom helping others bc so much time needed at every hospital with paperwork. Start approved central process that crosses all state lines
@CMSGov think about hospital privileges for doctors. Each hospital wants their own paperwork filled out from the same program one finished. It‚Äôs the same paperwork every time. Frustrates ppl. Slows down doctors ability to work. Decreases doctors ability to work and help ppl
@HHSGov big impediment is hospital privileges. Each hospital makes you contact ones old program and get the same LOR, the same paper filled out, etc. this uses up time and will to join new hospitals. There should be a central service that all hospitals use.

@NYGovCuomo Everything is class warfare and race division with you democrats. Ppl don't like your style, haven't you learned that by all the seats you've lost.
@MelissaAFrancis You are right. He played his card and lost. Next time if he wants biz he will keep his mouth shut. Happy birthday.
@andrewzimmern Are two guys just insane and in your own world??? This is one of you're stupidest posts ever. Wow. You're such an idiot. Trump derangement syndrome.
@realDonaldTrump thank you what you're doing for us and the country. Be safe.
@stanceco @ReverseKarma11 @SenSchumer If all your actions based off not being mean then you're a fool. Play by rules. Why have them stay? Not fair to ppl in line for yrs. go back to your country and help it build to be better
@benshapiro Haha. That's funny
@ReverseKarma11 @SenSchumer You were going good there for a second then started with race crap again. üí©. the world doesn't revolve around race. Try some educated thought about why.
@SenSchumer Why heartless? You said it yourself, temporary.
@NYGovCuomo Wow quoting vox. But you bash ppl that quote fox. Such a hypocrite. Can liberals be anything else but hypocritical?? I guess liars too.
@andrewzimmern You're such a jackass. A "useful idiot". Look up what it means. Trump also said women let him do it. Big difference.
@benshapiro I don't understand what's your problem. you have the concept of just turn other cheek. It doesn't work. Ppl need to be called when they messed up and Ball messed up.
@benshapiro You know that's nots far. What makes you think trumps not smart. I'm disappointed with you about this.
@davidwebbshow Wow. I mean he obviously doesn't understand how communist China handles crimes. They would have been in labor camp for yrs.

@NYGovCuomo Health insurance does not mean health care. Stop conflating
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP @SenateDems Stop lying. Dems want division, want taxes on rich bc those are the "bad" ppl. Dem policies put us in this mess. How about you try something different.
@andrewzimmern Yea Hannity broke it down very nicely how Hillary is center of 4 different investigations.
@SenSchumer Didn't we elect trump?? Linda what the ppl want
@SenSchumer Haha. And what believe you?? Do you even remember your hx or amnesia set in? You have us Obamacare. You raise taxes. You offer lie after lie. Term limits to get ppl like you,swamp, out of office.
@SenSchumer Maybe if democrats didn't create fake files and rig elections and try to divide ppl they might have credibility. Just sayin you putz.
@endthemaddnesss @NYGovCuomo They cause more problems.
@ReformedBroker So your pathetic liberal excuse is printing money doubling our debt was answer for a recession?? Nothing else, like a socialist ideology caused increase?? Ya know free stuff
@Gogo @GogoBizAv @DubaiAirshow Great to hear. Was wondering. Give us some news of a new contract.
@NYGovCuomo Why does everything have to be a civil rights related with you? What about a fallen solider memorial? A gulf war memorial. Anything else??
@NorthmanTrader @FoxNews You're better than this. It growth per yr
Thank you to our vets. No matter how much liberal society try's beating you down, know we got your back. Usa üá∫üá∏

@MittRomney What a piece of xzy you are. Who made you judge juror. Def didn't make you prez.
@andrewzimmern So with R, it's guilty just by allegation. With D, it's a R conspiracy. You're full of s()t. You're a "useful idiot". Look it up.

@andrewzimmern Wow. You are an artist, so creative of a statement. You're an idiot - statement of fact.
@HHSGovshould be a central process service that makes getting hospital privileges easier. Ask same questions, same verification. Annoying.
@ahahospitals why is there no centralized process to get hospital privileges?? Asking same questions same references. Frustrates everyone
@andrewzimmern You really embarrass yourself constantly. Willing to sacrifice the country so you can be right just once. You're sad.
@benshapiro It was 1 election. Making mountain out of mole hill.

@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump not on fox bc fake news made it up. It also just didn't happen. No matter how much you wish it was true.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Oh yea. I don't think that ever happened.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Since you want prez to apologize to you for stuff.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Also has his birth certificate ever been found? I don't recall
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Lol. You're a disgrace. Curious you feel this strongly about "like your doctor can keep them"?

@realDonaldTrump happy birthday
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump What a liberal thing to say. Waiting for a probable incorrect story. Stupid
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Haha. It's cute that you look up some nyt read. That's good. You're right, failure after 4 months in office.

@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Check again. Also non-binding with no penalty. Plus who says this means we have to be polluters. Everyone wants clean enviro,but affordable
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump You think you can play god. And willing to risk billions of dollars and poverty on a population for something you can't control anyways.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Global warming, show proof. How much you willing to risk to "control" it? 1 million jobs? 2? Pros and cons. Also china/India not part.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump That's a good thing. You really don't understand economics.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump Wtf are you talking about. You're the one talking like an expert. I know it kills jobs and costs USA billions. What you know?
@andrewzimmern And what do you know about Paris accord. Another liberal dumbass. Kills jobs.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump You probably don't even know what the Paris accord does. You heard some liberal bias "green-house gas" and jumped right in. Kills jobs.
@realDonaldTrump I support you to the end. The swamp will not win. Jail HRC, rice, obama, all their aids. Your agenda will save USA üá∫üá∏

@SenateDems you are all bitter sore losers.Crybabies.I get it, you want your lower back and it's gone.Maybe you won't be socialists anymore
@NDsUltimateJugg you can't be corrupt. HRC was. Trump just has biz. Even said no new deals. I like how now you worried about corruption
@NDsUltimateJugg HRC sold America out. Trump hasn't done anything. He's not even prez yet. HRC should be in jail, and if trump corrupt him 2
@NDsUltimateJugg stop making up stuff that's NOT in constitution. I didn't read ivanka seeking access, that's what Hillary did.
@NDsUltimateJugg your bitter liberal mindset very disheartening. Willing to cut your nose to spite face.
@NDsUltimateJugg why you so easily Manipulated. Hillary profited. Sold access. Being rich or having biz doesn't disqualify to be prez.
@NDsUltimateJugg Justin you really have to stop being a puppet of the liberal left.
@NDsUltimateJugg ha ha. Now you're a constitutional scholar. Show me where it says the president can't own land? He just can't profit.
@NDsUltimateJugg maybe you should stop worrying about trump and biz and look at our current mistake of a prez.
@SpeakerRyan I like this fight. Keep it up. Gonna save American jobs, save our biz, save America. üá∫üá∏work with prez elect.
@realDonaldTrump so far living up to expectations. Keep up the great work. Great pics for cabinet. üëçüèªüá∫üá∏
@NDsUltimateJugg no you still don't understand. Those are liberal democrat policies put in under Clinton. Repub didn't put end to it c bush
@NDsUltimateJugg agree. But liberals point finger and call them racist or worse. Trump just doesn't care. Will fix it. Hope.
@NDsUltimateJugg wrong. Repub didn't give they didn't stop it before it happened. Those were democrats policies put in place by Clinton
@NDsUltimateJugg it could be but luckily republicans have house,senate,prez. Libs just get to reap benefits of repub rule
@NDsUltimateJugg being a liberal is a joke. Hate America. Hate anything that benefits us. Make money and bitch about it. It's a disease
@NDsUltimateJugg oh by the us? And you're not complaining about innocent lives lost like bush?
@NDsUltimateJugg probably gotta stop reading solely liberal bias "news". Cause I've heard from ppl close to him all he does is ask questions
@NDsUltimateJugg what good is briefing if prez has weak spine and doesn't listen anyways.
@NDsUltimateJugg and why you think he doesn't get them. If only you were so concerned with obama. Ya know Isis is jv team.
@NDsUltimateJugg I don't get the question. You do realize he isn't Prez yet? You Obama misses like half of his. And he is prez. Worst ever.
@NDsUltimateJugg I said looks odd. But she's also successful and I trust his judgement. I believe in him. Obama failed us.
@NDsUltimateJugg and that's largest donor. I agree seems odd. But she's a successful woman that knows how to run biz.
@NDsUltimateJugg who? So far seems like he is naming some high ranking successful ppl to positions that need them.
@NDsUltimateJugg @AmbJohnBolton nope
@NDsUltimateJugg yes he did. But he hasn't done anything yet. HRC did sell the state department.
@NDsUltimateJugg doesn't bother me. He supported trump entire time. I'm waiting for actions to judge.
@econjared I disagree. If reg freedom biz will expand. Less red tape. Less taxes. More take home pay. Yes prices will rise but ppl with jobs
@SpeakerRyan you look so happy. Don't forget you caused problems before election. I hope everyone get passed it and works together for USA.
@NDsUltimateJugg stop acting like an entitled fool. Obama, who you supported, not a good prez. So can't say anything about trump - yet.
@SpecialReport @krauthammer what HRC email cgi perjury charges? Obama pardon? Anyone still interested? I'm sure Gowdy not gonna let slide
@realDonaldTrump congrats. #winner
@IngrahamAngle Juan an idiot
@NDsUltimateJugg they are looking at the uncertainty. Great buying opportunity .
@NDsUltimateJugg you're lucky. Cause if he succeeds you do too.
@andrewzimmern stop being a tool. Hrc a criminal. And you support that?? Weak man.
@JohnKasich you're a pos. If trump losses Ohio I will do everything I can to kick you out of office. Secret democrat.
@NDsUltimateJugg you don't think Hillary getting questions before hand is a form of rigging?
@NDsUltimateJugg end of democracy, you mean by Hillary winning? Such a criminal. Rigging every part of election

@MetabolicEndo hello. 3rd yr fellow. Think this is the future. Id like to know more. Any recommendations?
@stephenfhayes now that's the stuff that's more important than Trump saying stupid things.
@stephenfhayes @realDonaldTrump how do you not support him over hrc? What has he done to you? Hasn't fallen in line with your narrative
@RightDame idk.
@wheelroute12 @stephenfhayes I agree there is going to be a new age Repub party. #Trumprepublican.
@jwsal22 @stephenfhayes agree. frustrating. Go after hrc and her weak policy and failures. Get trump in then give feedback to make better
@jonnans  maybe. And I used to agree. But losing his way. Losing focus on end result.
@RightDame Los Angeles
@Daryl_Manuel no. He's been same basher or Trump since beginning. I wanna hear him help him. And talk about hrc.
@Elsparko8 if. But not what we the ppl choose this time.
@M_Palmer1987 yes. I liked his positions and views. I have similar ones for the country. But he's going against the ppls vote. Bash hrc.
@DebFlanigan I agree. Let's win then try to modify positions. Pass legislation with modifications. But let's win this first. Trump2016!
@stephenfhayes I like you a lot. I watch Spec. Report for you, but come on man. Stay on track with repubs in office. Then preach position.
@PKurucar I think ppl want change. Trump is a basic guy. Not political. So its off for our perception. We as ppl not used to it.
@247fubar "too" as in also
@Bourdain don't do it by going into politics. Makes you look dumb. Stick what you know. Keep up great work on SHOW. Not politics. Dumbass.
@stephenfhayes you're a pos. Traitor. You want HRC? Probably bought too. Or just to proud to admit times changing and you're obsolete.
@NDsUltimateJugg really?? That's your way to justify it in your mind? Cause I'm sure there's going an investigation. Lead by state dpt.
@NDsUltimateJugg come on just. He's mentioned in emails. Referred to as their friend and Iran just hung him last month.
@NDsUltimateJugg https://t.co/ocKZt8ljPm
@econjared and costing America billions of dollars. Wow! Free health care and less insured. Try finding doctor to take insurance.
@NDsUltimateJugg said is you joke and I don't think you really understand the significance. It put USA lives at risk and got ppl killed.
@realDonaldTrump keep up the good work. You're amazing tonight. Just stay focused. Let her talk, she will bury herself.
@stephenfhayes @MikeLeeforUtah republicans and both of you can kiss my ass. Have done nothing but bitch. With no action. Want Hillary?
@GuyAdami lol. Matchmaker. I'm interested. How does one get in touch
@BilldeBlasio that's bc you have a high tax the rich and spend mentality you jackass. How bout cut taxes. Give incentives.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump lol. Stop defending a party leader that's so corrupt the list never ends.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump at least he's there. Where's Hillary? Sleeping? On private jet given by some Shek? She's a joke
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump do you ask Hillary the same questions? Emails? Benghazi? CGI? Or that's not important to you? Hmm
@NDsUltimateJugg have you heard about her temper. She gets violent.
@NDsUltimateJugg it's true. Iran be way to scared.
@NDsUltimateJugg she's got nothing but words. No specifics. Failed policies for 30 yrs
@JonahNRO I disagree. If under audit don't release. Gotta wait for Feds to stop. Any lawyer tell you that.
@NDsUltimateJugg not freedom of speech when working for private company. Go outside on street. Also screw him for his stupid opinion.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump stop hating trump but say nothing about hrc or Obama. Name 1 good thing our leaders have done so far
@NDsUltimateJugg cont of first tweet. There is nothing Obama has done for you or the country that has helped. Name at least 1
@NDsUltimateJugg respects troops and police. Says wants to help all Americans. Where is the hate?? You just copying democrats pundits
@NDsUltimateJugg can't be serious that Obama has done anything good. Trump sends plane to help troops. Singer girl hide after family killed
@NDsUltimateJugg you're not still for Hillary are you? Why? There is no good reason. Has done nothing good.
@realDonaldTrump Don't change anything on immigration. No amnesty. Stick to what got you where you are.
@newtgingrich I agree. Republicans so scared of liberal media and being blamed about something they won't speak out about hrc. Sell outs
@econjared so biased. That's not reporting that liberal bias nonsense. You should be embarrassed
@SpecialReport as a doctor I'd like to see what a panel of psychiatrists thinks about Hillary mental ability.
@BetaThetaPi happy birthday.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump it's a strong move. Ppl want Trump, and not Hillary. Give them an apology, they will eat it up. Shows care
@realDonaldTrump tell ppl that you are sad and upset. And want to apologize for way acting. See great country being sabotaged. For the win
@realDonaldTrump should do a state into camera during debate and give apology for all things said. Said bc upset with the way things are.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump mexicans also talking about California belonging to them. Should make english national language.
@NDsUltimateJugg "what if" much diff than "happened". Trump so pro military will give all backup needed to get out men/women out.
@NDsUltimateJugg words are different than actions. She's put us at risk with horrible decisions. Hope none your kids under her leadership
@NDsUltimateJugg she's proved can't handle sensitive material. Why don't you wanna believe what happened? She put your life at risk.
@stephenfhayes stop being an asshole. You want Hillary?? I like your smarts and commentary but wtf.
@stephenfhayes what is your problem?? You've lost the never trump thing. Support a republican. Better than Hillary. Should be ashamed
@Kabezee many are criminals. Don't be foolish. She'll make your life worse. Also she's Slovene
@realDonaldTrump can kaine  speak English. What the hell is he saying. This is America.
@stephenfhayes what are you doing?? Just stay quite. You really hate trump enough to elect Hillary? I like your smartness. But this stupid
@NDsUltimateJugg no what it means is they had a gun, reached for police gun or had some weapon. Police shot to kill.
@NDsUltimateJugg also police don't kill innocent black ppl
@NDsUltimateJugg I didn't hear much of that. I heard illegal immigrants killing Americans. I heard police attacks. Never said blacks.
@NDsUltimateJugg come on. No credit. Included lgbt community, blacks, Hispanics. Everyone. You want a criminal?
@larry_kudlow amazing to hear you're helping @realDonaldTrump. Nice!! Now I know he's a great candidate
@larry_kudlow true. @tedcruz runs on his morals and honesty but then can't live up to them. Signed pledge. Help party. Selfish.
@NDsUltimateJugg embrace it Justin. Take it all in.
@NDsUltimateJugg really. We know what she's done to this country. @RNCinCLE there's a lot to bash about. But pro trump too
@NDsUltimateJugg I can't believe you want Hillary. What about her makes you want her to be prez? Just bc she's a democrat?
@stephenfhayes why you doing this? Country and repubs need your advice. Help. Stop bashing. Join the team.
RT @ClevelandClinic: Q. Should you pee on a jellyfish sting?	A. No! Studies haven't supported this, and urine may even worsen it. https://t‚Ä¶
@realDonaldTrump on @SpecialReport today. Great stuff. He says all the right things. Need to get ride of corruption. Bring us down.
@jasonrileywsj I'd support trump and teach him. He seems to want to learn. But has own ideas. Also anything better than Hillary.
@NDsUltimateJugg Nope. Stolen gun from parents. You can't do this Justin. You wanna take away rights just bc some bad apples. Protect home.
@NDsUltimateJugg no even at shoes need checks. Private sellers yes can buy but very small amount actually done that way.
@NDsUltimateJugg mass shooting not via legal guns. Also look at how many mass shooting most under Obama. Don't trust gov to start laws.
@NDsUltimateJugg have you tried to buy a gun? It's not easy. Safety classes. Background checks. Doj checks.
@NDsUltimateJugg this is where you show your lack of knowledge of guns. Hard to buy one, background checks, safeties on weapon.
@NDsUltimateJugg ppl kill ppl. Ppl also die in cars, are they illegal next. Ppl also die with hammers, are they next? Killed by illegal guns
@NDsUltimateJugg can you really be that much not for guns?? You know there main purpose is to protect us from the government.
@NDsUltimateJugg sad but true. Need leadership in this country.
RT @AmerGastroAssn: If you're a #FutureGI, tweet about it. Here is a badge you can share with your family &amp; friends. https://t.co/VvD6a4wOmJ
@stephenfhayes help trump. Stop being obstructionist. Don't be a radical or to far to one side. I like your stances but support.
@NDsUltimateJugg not even close. He got charged with improper storage. Which was in house in safe. Bio lady had same clearance as him
@NDsUltimateJugg if that was you handling the info you'd be in jail for many years and life ruined.
@NDsUltimateJugg that's scary man. She's done so much damage to America. She's bought by so many ppl. Hasn't ache over anything in office.
@NDsUltimateJugg you may not like trump but are you actually advocating for Hillary? Even after what she's done.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost margin of error 2.5%.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump still tied.
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost new poll out from Quinnipiac. They are tied now
@NDsUltimateJugg foreign pollsters?!!  Come on. Trump hasn't really lead but he also got highest number of gop primary voters
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump @ABC @washingtonpost you know polls are way off. Look at brexit
@realDonaldTrump Olympics coming up. Should have add with your team vs Hillary and Warren. Joke combo.
@IngrahamAngle yes!!! You say the exact right thing about trade. George will doesn't know Econ. I support you.
@larry_kudlow push your friend to support trump. And reduce corporate taxes, repatriation, enforce trade agreements. Loved your shows.
@realDonaldTrump plz stop judge attacks. Not worth your time. I know hurts, swallow pride. Get your message on track. Judge doesn't like u.
@SpeakerRyan I really like your messages. you're a great leader. Great ideas. You and @realDonaldTrump will lead country to greatness
@NDsUltimateJugg are you dieing??? Justin doesn't want Disney?? Be well.
@BillKristol @CGasparino why would you sabotage your own party??  Just win WH and try to work with Trump.
@NDsUltimateJugg on going nonsense. Today gitmo- transfer of high level terrorist to countries that can't house them. Have fun in Ireland
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump but that's just it. The funding for demcroats is always to much. Always wanting to spend
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump but that's just it. The funding for demcroats is always to much. Always wanting to spend
@NDsUltimateJugg @realDonaldTrump I don't disagree. Should wait for facts.
@SpeakerRyan @MittRomney @larry_kudlow what hypocrites in @GOP side. We the ppl elect trump and you think you're better than us. Pledge sign
@stephenfhayes why not try and help trump with your vision? I think he'd be willing to learn. No extreme to right or left.
@SpecialReport why house/senate gop losing their mind. If don't support trump he can turn on them and that's it for them. Ppl have spoken.
@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP what are you doing?? Endorse trump. The ppl have spoken for him. That means if you don't your next to lose.
@SpecialReport Hillary had server to sell secrets via CGI. Tells them where to find info and then denies saying didn't know about it.
@realDonaldTrump keep winning. America needs your help. Crooked Hillary will ruin us all.
@NDsUltimateJugg you know it. It's a lot of fun. I'm trying to learn more
@NDsUltimateJugg yes. But he vacationed there. So yea. Either way he is horrible.
@BernieSanders is a socialist idiot. Only speaks hot air. Go back to the soviet union
@realDonaldTrump only jewish biz men on 770 am. NYC bribe case. What if Mormon,Christian?? Pull jewish support from dems.
@realDonaldTrump nyc bribe case. Calling out orthodox jewish biz men. Why calling only them out.Can you speak about this?What if Protestant
@USATODAY @RobertoFerris wow!! Crazy leak. Lot of ppl gonna disappear.
@FoxNewsSunday what is wrong with you Chris. interview skills are weak. Misrepresenting trump. He said if treated fairly, mentioned 0 times
@ScottBaio good interview on Sunday futures. I agree with clarity of @realDonaldTrump speaking points. Independent conservative. Trump 2016
@realDonaldTrump I support.
@realDonaldTrump should tell USA that you're a biz/military prez not a social issue one. No social issue of don't have a country. Broken.
@SpeakerRyan just make sure special interests aren't behind those ideas
@SpeakerRyan you Will be prez one day, but help out the front runners now. Together better than apart. Beat Hillary.
@realDonaldTrump @BornInUSSR plz trump be careful. Just win this thing. Big fan. Cruz and you together stronger than apart
@CGasparino yea just its ok to kill cops. Ok to blame white ppl for worlds problem. Ok to blame USA as a nation. Ok to blame Israel. It's ok
@FoxNews best debate yet. high minded discussions. all 4 be good @POTUS.
@GOP Good informative in depth debate. I like it. They are all qualified. @SpecialReport
@NDsUltimateJugg I guess. Just don't understand why. Unite behind ppl want. acting more like liberal democrat telling ppl what they want.
@megynkelly @newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump trump time to learn the issues. It's a tough job. Speaker fair and balanced. Teach trump.
@BretBaier what kinda soft ball questions are these. Get at her. Benghazi. Server. No accomplishments. Iran deal. Etc
@BretBaier @SpecialReport Hillary struggling. Explain all day. Going to jail.
@taylaaa @Lnnie @NDsUltimateJugg umm. Yes you can. Reverse racism.
@NDsUltimateJugg you can mention that many supporters are white, that implies only white ppl. Lots of other races support. Big #wins
@Lnnie @NDsUltimateJugg see that's a racist comment. Don't liberals ever think about their own perspective?
@BernardGoldberg nicely written. It's craZy that liberals mock and then claim they never do that. Or get upset when done to their prez.
@SpeakerRyan I think you have bigger future. Thanks for working hard for all of us. Plz don't let us down. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump keep going strong. All sorts of ppl behind you. Just plz don't disappoint.
@larry_kudlow why @GOP telling me who to vote for. Graduate student, I hope I know what's good for me. Hop Looking like democrats.
@SpecialReport why do republicans have to adjust to the gop and not the @GOP to the ppl.
@NDsUltimateJugg ehh. It's the overall appearance. You voting trump? He's mod. and isn't a socialist or under investigation.
@MittRomney embarrassing moment today for you. I don't see purpose. Bashing your own front runner.
@SpecialReport I like how all candidates hugged it out at the end. Politics is a sport.
@HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs what is wrong with you?? Support trump. Thousands more ppl with republican banner and you bash them? Why? Win 2016
@marcorubio plz don't be estab puppet. It risks your political career. Support trump. You'd be great VP then prez. Don't let them pawn you.
@MittRomney plz don't give anti-trump speech. Support who the American republicans want. Bring party together. It makes you look bad.
@larry_kudlow why doesn't the gop embrace trump. Bring in ppl. Make bigger party? gop upsetting me a lot. @BretBaier @SpecialReport
@ReformedBroker you a raging liberal?? Wtf. You should just donate money to the irs of your so for increase taxes.
@realDonaldTrump keep going. I hope you win. If need any medical help, I'm a doc. You're doing great.
@HouseGOP can you please start sending all sorts of bills to the prez desk. Have him veto it. No Reed to block.
@larry_kudlow please reconsider running for office. America can use your abilities.
@larry_kudlow I urge you to reconsider. I hope whoever wins White House has you in cabinet. Supply side king dollar.
@BornInUSSR agree. Vacuum left isis in charge. A large gang with guns. Need strong protected base. Like Japan
@BornInUSSR coming in loud and clear.
@larry_kudlow @NYTimeskrugman @StephenMoore krugman is nuts. Always has been.
@larry_kudlow yes, finally!!!Couldn't agree more. But how to win a war when your chief seems to want to lose? Do generals take it upon self?
@larry_kudlow agree. Plz run for office. Teach they shmucks something.
@larry_kudlow Mr. Kudlow I disagree. Deporting illegals and having strong legal immigrant is important. trump has right idea.
@FoxNews I did not appreciate the way you handled the debate. Unorganized and unfair to @realDonaldTrump
@larry_kudlow thank you for promoting pro growth agendas. You're show is still missed, was my favorite. Do you advise candidates? Hope so.
@krauthammer where are all the vetoes for Obama? Why haven't republicans sent bills to his desk?
@SpecialReport great idea to have Center seat. Maybe Hillary in there?
@EverydayDOctor bombs Iran
Having knee pain or back pain? Let's know. I have strengthening and stretching techniques that'll really help. Helps with headaches too.
With allergy season upon us, keeping your house clean with less dust will help symptoms -- better sleep, no cough, feel good.
