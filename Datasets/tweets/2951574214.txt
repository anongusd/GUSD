Importantly, this new law will finally enable us to put into practice lessons learned from our 2016 flood, recent hurricanes and other events across the nation.

Big wins for Louisiana this week.  https://t.co/wQ17mnxdXL
Here is a clip of today's markup: https://t.co/tQC1nOtKex
Our bill ensures that these increased revenues will be committed to  projects that restore the coast, protect our coastal communities from  hurricanes and other disaster and, ultimately, reduce our nation’s  outrageous disaster response costs.
La is battling the largest historical, ongoing and prospective loss of coastal wetlands and it’s a national crisis.  Diverting our energy $ away from efforts to improve our resiliency is a fundamentally flawed approach to addressing the maintenance backlog in national parks.
The bill was considered today in conjunction with the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act, which  proposed using Gulf offshore energy revenues to address the maintenance  backlog of the National Park Service and other agencies across the  country.
Our bill,   H.R. 6771 amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act 2006 (GOMESA) to bring Gulf offshore energy revenue sharing in line with levels that onshore  energy producing states enjoy – an effort long pursued by Louisiana’s  congressional delegation.
After working on this for 20 years I can tell you:  what happened today  is historic. Moving this bill is a big deal and has enormous implications for South Louisiana. https://t.co/HTLf1b49Ed
Today we advanced a bill to increase Louisiana's energy revenues and funding for coastal restoration.  Read our press release here:  	https://t.co/pmXruEz04i

5. With #TaxReform , we now have a much simpler process. Filing your taxes should not be as hard as it's been for the past 31 years, and after today it will be as simple as filing with a postcard.#TaxDay #TaxCutsandJobsAct
With this repeal families will be able to buy the health insurance that is right for them.  #TaxCutsandJobsAct #TaxDay https://t.co/mXBTKgU7c6
4. ACA RELIEF. Finally, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we were able to repeal the crippling "individual mandate" embedded in the Affordable Care Act. This was a totally unfair tax, it was ineffective, and people shouldn't be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance.
3. The new tax code doubles the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000, which helps people all across the country care for their family, while also protecting the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and Adoption Credit. This is great news for families.
2. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act nearly DOUBLED the standard deduction. Specifically, the new tax code will increase the standard deduction from $12,000 to $24,000 for married couples, which will protect more folks' income from being taxed. #TaxDay #TaxCutsandJobsAct
1. Lower tax rates for Americans across the board.  In communities across our nation people are experiences benefits of lower tax rates. In La., the typical family of 4 will see a tax cut. This means you get to keep more of your hard-earned money to spend or save how YOU see fit. https://t.co/5RuXXrXTFI
It's a historic tax day today, with this year being the very last time we file our taxes using the old tax code. In honor of Tax Day 2018, today we will highlight 5 ways that the new tax code will be better than the old one...#TaxDay  #TaxCuts

Project efficiency is not limited to highways. The West Shore flood control project was in the STUDY phase for 42 years before proposed for construction.  And construction still hasn't started.
The fact that we call the Mississippi River bridge that was built before I was born as "new" is the best indicator that something needs to change.
There is no doubt we need more money to support infrastructure in the capital region but we can't keep spending money in the same system that got us to this point.
Brand new four lane roads in areas that don't have traffic don't make sense when there isn't enough investment in the capital region - some of the worst traffic in the US.
The current infrastructure prioritization system in place today is flawed. Project development needs to be metric based and objective.
We don't have years of infrastructure investment to catch up on. We have decades.
Tax reform - not just important for take home pay, but also making the US more competitive in the international marketplace. https://t.co/i1w79Lg5mS
We're changing the game. For every one regulation, we're cutting two. While we're changing the game and setting conditions for success, we have to ensure our workforce is prepared to compete.
More investments are returning home. Like Apple bringing home $350 billion to invest in US and Spillway Sportsman expanding services, giving higher wages to employees and increasing jobs.  #TaxReform

In addition the bill includes a change that may result in a small increase in coastal restoration and hurricane protection funding for Louisiana by amending offshore energy revenue sharing law.
La wins in the bill: our flood and other disaster victims get the tax breaks we’ve fought for all year long, we preserved tax incentives uniquely critical for community development, historic preservation, economic reinvestment and higher education.
Finally, this bill helps eliminate the strategic advantage that foreign companies hold over America’s small biz by providing competitive tax rates. It provides opportunities for Americans by creating jobs here in our country not overseas and helps to increase $ for our families.
This means that Washington takes less while individuals, families and job creators keep more. That’s a good thing! https://t.co/j2OJIbKbwX
This bill will lower taxes across every income tax bracket, nearly double the standard deduction and give people back their freedom to make healthcare decisions without having to pay a government-imposed penalty and lifting some of the tax burden on our small businesses.
Today I voted yes on "game-changing" tax reform legislation that finally puts what’s best for people – not government – first https://t.co/6ZrrZHIXPn
Passage of these landmark policy changes represent major movement toward regional flexibility, tailored management strategies that favor local over federal control, better data collection and enhanced responsiveness to the needs of recreational anglers and mixed use fisheries.
Our Modern Fish Act and two other common-sense amendments were also approved Wednesday as part of broader committee action to reauthorize and modernize the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the fishing law of the land.
This bill will also preserve existing commercial and charter fishing protections under current law and further protect the average angler’s ability to enjoy fresh red snapper at home or in a favorite restaurant. https://t.co/dyWgp5Fsw8
This bipartisan bill is intended to give every day Americans a more sustainable access to saltwater fishing than current restrictive model and is conservation- based to allow states to work with fed fishery managers to expand access 25 miles or to a depth of 150 ft into the Gulf. https://t.co/dyWgp5Fsw8

This is the way that government is supposed to work. #DRRA
It truly captures and takes action on the frontline feedback and lessons learned from our August flood, recent hurricanes, and other events.
This is one of the most significant disaster recovery and preparedness bills in decades. #DRRA
We pushed hard for the H.R. 4460 provision that qualifies houses of worship and faith-based non-profits for FEMA assistance to repair, restore or replace when they are damaged.
Without fail, some of the most reliable, generous agents of recovery are the many churches in the Capital Region.
This policy will help to make the necessary changes to the interstate barrier and drainage to facilitate evacuations and road usage during floods. #DRRA
Like I-12 in Baton Rouge and Livingston Parish.
H.R. 4460 requires FEMA to collaborate with the Federal Highway Administration to develop policy on the design, construction and repair of evacuations routes…
This will alleviate much of the headache that many Louisianans experienced during last year’s flood.
The DRRA requires FEMA and other agencies work to implement a streamlined process whereby disaster victims can provide information one time to a federal agency rather than having to apply multiple times to multiple agencies for disaster assistance.
Ultimately saving taxpayer dollars.  The bill also funds a “surge” of building inspectors to help address permitting and assessment activities that typically delay rebuilding and recovery.
The DRRA establishes a new program where rebuilding and recovery efforts can include resilient construction to help prevent repetitive losses and to prepare for future disasters…
The amendment also makes food banks eligible for FEMA repair assistance.
T&amp;I unanimously adopted our amendment requiring FEMA to more closely collaborate with food banks like the Greater Baton Rouge Area Food Bank, St. Vincent de Paul, and Long-term Recovery Groups like Rebuild Louisiana, Samaritan’s Purse, and others.
It’s important to invest federal dollars in projects that will prevent these disasters from happening in the future.
Like the Comite River Diversion Canal. #DRRA
Our amendment also clarifies the flexibility to states and local governments to complete MUCH needed flood mitigation projects…
For example, the DRRA will eliminate the very flawed “duplication of benefits” policy that prevents LA flood survivors from gaining Restore LA grants.
Several of mine and Congressman Richmond’s policies were included in the bill…
The DRRA represents an important move toward the federal government taking a more proactive approach to disaster preparation, relief and recovery which is something that I have advocated for a long time.
Can better prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against floods, hurricanes and disasters of all kinds. #DRRA
And It cuts through bureaucracies when disaster strikes so that families, individuals, small businesses, and state and local governments…
This bill makes critical reforms to FEMA’s disaster response and recovery programs to provide on the ground help…
Yesterday The Disaster Recovery Reform Act was unanimously approved by the Transportation and Infrastructure committee. #DRRA

Kudos to DOTD and Sasol for the first adaptive traffic signal in Louisiana.  Intelligent traffic mgmt was a priority in the 2015 FAST Act. It’s also why we pushed hard to link up Waze and EBR to share  data for smarter traffic solutions in the Capital. https://t.co/SyXq38MaWY

Since	2000 we have seen a spike from approximately 17 mil people in the SNAP	program balloon to over 45-46 mil people. So what does that mean	financially?

We need to improve transparency, allow for ins. purchases across state lines and allow more competition to help with the costs of healthcare
People in La are paying 123% higher premiums on average and higher deductibles and fewer choices. That is broken and not healthcare reform
Re: Healthcare bill- We definitely need to keep working on it, I know there are some imperfections in the bill that passed the house
It is important that I hear everyone's priorities before we go back into session in September.
This August we will be doing individual meetings, group meetings, meetings with employers and employees, in all 13 parishes
This August we will have weeks back home in the district to focus on visiting with folks back home.
We also voted on the appropriations bill to fund the @DeptofDefense and DHS for energy and water activities.
Last week in DC we worked on a lot of Veterans Bills, including working to prop up and extend the VA Choice program.
@ Red Snapper- We are working on a solution so that folks in S. La can fish more days in 2017, 2018 and so on, and not just a one year fix.

Approaching one year later from the flood and no one has touched the walls, no drainage outlets, nothing.
We asked the Fed. Highway Admin to update us on safety standards and timeline to fixing these problems so this doesn't happen again.
We beg for levees like this in south Louisiana but to have one on the interstate is crazy.
There are many safety aspects w/ interstate walls, but why do fed standards not call for certain amt. of drainage flow or offsetting walls?
The I-12 wall exacerbated the flooding, it goes on for miles &amp; there are no drainage features.

Pecue Lane Interchange + Washington St. Exit relocation + I-10 widening between Highland &amp; LA 73 = progress for Capital Region.
The Pecue Lane agreement with DOTD is a huge leap forward for traffic relief on Airline, Highland, Tiger Bend &amp; Siegen Lane.
Pecue Lane Interchange at I-10 approved by Metro Council.

Anyone attempting to blame delays on the fed systems lacks an understanding of the process and opportunities to expedite flood relief.
This has nothing to do with politics; it is just frustrating and sloppy
Taking away $250mm from flood victims to give contractors to take seven months to get the $ out the door further victimizes the survivors
On August 19th, I urged that a contractor be hired to administer this	program.
Also challenges efforts in Congress to provide addt'l flood relief $ when not a penny of Sept. funding has been allocated to flood victims.
Impossible to explain to flood victims why $1.6B in recovery $ is stuck in bureaucracy while homes remain gutted, moldy and un-insulated.
This will further delay the allocation of badly-needed flood relief funds that we	appropriated in September.
Disappointed to hear that @RestoreLA_gov are restarting the flood relief contract solicitation.

$500 mm in transportation dollars coming to La. to allow for the relocation of Wash. St. exit and widening of I-10 from Highland to LA 73.
The federal infrastructure package needs to include ports and waterways. US trade and economy depend on it.
Needs based spending (traffic counts, hwy $ spent vs communting hours saved, etc.) should direct transportation spending
Louisiana should prioritize transportation spending based on needs,  not politics.

Comite should have been completed decades ago, but now we actually have the opportunity to do it.
… Few can afford the cost of raising their homes – I know our family couldn’t afford it.
Completing it would also lower the region’s base flood elevation &amp; eliminate need for many home/biz owners from having to raise their homes
With these Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds, the state just has to prioritize the goals of the Comite project and move forward.
Through funds appropriated by Congress, Louisiana has more than $250 million in available flood and disaster prevention funds.
The project could be completed in approximately two years – and the state has the federal funds available now to build it. @SteveRHardy

It's time to partner with the private sector and turn dirt instead of talking and "studying."
In the decades it takes the Corps to study projects, homes &amp; business flood, vulnerable communities disappear &amp; taxpayers $ are wasted.
Things like spending billions after disasters instead of millions on prevention beforehand make no sense. We need to work/spend smarter.
We’re working to make La. a case study on how flood protection/water projects should be done instead of another story of govt failure.
but we are committed to helping lead the trans-formative change.
Untangling the decades of bureaucracy and culture of delay w/in the Corps, EPA and others takes time,
Modernizing our country's  infrastructure starts with regulatory reform; You can’t do infrastructure without reg reform first.
Excited to translate Trump's proposed Infrastructure Package into policy-particularly with bridges, flood protection and coastal restoration
Shortening the time it takes Corps projects to be built will be a priority as we demand more efficiency from government

We can achieve real environmental benefits through efforts compatible with economic growth.
We have to untangle our job creators from the costly burden of excessive regulations so they can prosper.
PROVE IT will bring fairness, transparency and accountability to the federal regulatory system.
but the over regulated public is still unfairly forced to pay for them.  We need to end this regulatory abuse.
The costs of regulations almost always exceed the self-serving predictions agencies use when the rules are issued,
The PROVE IT amendment requires federal agencies to regularly quantify and assess the regulations.
Billions of dollars that our biz and manufacturers could use to boost wages and grow jobs are diverted to comply with the new regulations.
Regulations are effectively a hidden tax.
Last week the House voted to approve the Regulatory Accountability Act with my PROVE IT amendment attached.
The top two most burdensome areas of regulation for small business were the federal tax code and Affordable Care Act. We can do better.
Because of the high costs of complying with regulations, more than half of small businesses have held off on hiring new employees.
According to the National Small Business Association, the average small-biz owner is spending at least $12k every year for regulations.
This has a significant impact on Louisiana’s jobs and economy.
Did you know that in Louisiana we have 74% more regulations than the rest of the country?

Flood waters didn’t recognize one socioeconomic class or one race, it flooded everybody; and the fed. govt. should treat everyone the same.
Here we are 100 days after the flood event and FEMA is telling people they’ll get a trailer in January and February…this is ridiculous.
Our recovery wasn’t by government, this was the community coming together and rescuing themselves.
We can do better than this, and we're going to keep pressing, keep pushing and keep fighting until people get what they deserve out of govt.
People want government to be responsive and help them. People want government to be efficient.
The govt. is wasting money and taking months and spending 10x's to do what our communities could do at a fraction of the cost &amp; time.
Look no further than at what we're experiencing in south Louisiana today - being re-victimized by FEMA and the SBA in our recovery effort.
It's not a surprise to me that people are frustrated with government.

Failed policies have produced rising costs for families, sluggish growth, and sky-high real unemployment #jobsreport
Unemployment is “down” bc ppl have stopped looking for #work. The % of Americans in the labor force is the smallest since 1978. Unacceptable
Latest jobs report is more proof that Obama-economics don't work: less jobs, lower wages, and more people stopping their search for #jobs

It’s time for tax code reform that is fairer, flatter, and simpler.
Doing your taxes shouldn’t be complicated.
We need a simpler, fairer tax code along with a simpler, fairer IRS.
Tax code reform should create a service-first IRS.
It should make it easier to create jobs, raise wages, and expand opportunity for all Americans…
A new tax code should not only make it easier to do your taxes, but also give you peace of mind.
We must make simplicity and fairness high priority with tax code reform.
We must offer a way to dramatic reform without increasing the deficit.
We can’t have a better tax code if we don’t have an IRS that puts taxpayers first.
It should make America the greatest place in the world to hire and invest.
Our tax code should be fair and simple for everyone…
To put it plainly, we need a new tax code.
The IRS has consistently violated the trust of the American taxpayer.
Our tax code isn’t promoting growth.  In fact, it’s pushing jobs overseas.
Every year it takes more just to do your taxes than pay them… It’s unacceptable.
It’s made up of high rates, special interest breaks, and regulations that are too complicated to even understand…
Bottom line, our tax code is a mess.
The tax code and the IRS should work for – not against – the American people.
I support fundamental tax reform and believe it’s critical to restoring America’s competiveness.

This bill will bring much needed accountability to the regulatory system and bring back the opportunity for job creators to thrive.
That’s why I am introducing the Prove It Act of 2016…
Our job creators can’t prosper with these excessive regulations.
And this regulatory burden not only halts economic growth, but it kills jobs.
Regulations have skyrocketed over the past seven years in	every avenue of the economy…
It’s completely unacceptable.
However it is regulated ten times more than the average	industry.
The chemical manufacturing industry is three times more	important to the economy of LA than the national economy…
We’re the most regulated state in America.
In the state of Louisiana, the impact of these regulations is	74% greater than the nation as a whole…
It is time to end regulatory abuse, which is why I am	offering this bill.
But instead, that money is being diverted to comply with daily	regulations.
Our businesses could be using billions of dollars boosting	wages and growing jobs…
Effectively, regulations are a hidden tax.
The “Prove It Act of 2016” will bring fairness and transparency	to the regulatory system… Something that is much needed.
Last week I introduced legislation in the House to bring	accountability to the federal regulatory system.

There is a #betterway to fight poverty in the our country. Weigh in on this issue https://t.co/bRSHuaFZq5
I want to redesign anti-poverty programs so that they effectively move people off of anti-poverty programs and into jobs.
And we have to get people connected with opportunities in the marketplace to break the cycle of poverty in our communities.
Or, to put it another way, we should invest in the programs that increase individual’s self-reliance and reduce government dependence.
We have to rethink spending on these programs in terms of how effectively they move people through and off of them.
Entitlement spending as we know it today erodes self-reliance and often leads to patterns of increasing gov dependence.
Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. The welfare system is flawed &amp; needs a self-sufficiency redesign.
Yet, the poverty rate over the same period of time has been largely unchanged. Why?
American taxpayers have spent over $20 trillion on anti-poverty programs in the 50+ years of the “War on Poverty”…

PR bill advanced last week includes an amendment we wrote prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to pay Puerto Rico'o debt down.
Per NFIB, since 2009 we have had the first ever net loss of small business in the US
On average, the regulatory burdens cost each American family $11k-$14k
The regulatory burden on LA is 74% more than US average.
Currently 1/3 of LA oil and gas jobs are lost in a year, yet US policy supports Iran selling their oil. Whose energy jobs are we helping?
Supporting legislation that says members of Congress don't get paid if they don't balance the fed budget.
Voted against the 2000 paged Omnibus bill. Spending $1 tril in one hour is not right and not smart.
Our $19 trillion debt is out of control. $160,000 for each American. We shouldn't be funding 1950s solutions for 2016 problems.

We’re working to redesign programs to do just that while pushing job-creating economic policies.
Our welfare system should be designed to help individuals find jobs and stay employed.
Gov programs should be evaluated by the volume and frequency of people moving through &amp; out of them.
Creating opportunities for full-time work is the way to move the poverty needle in the US.
It’s time to face the facts: government can’t fix poverty. But a job-creating economy can.
Hardworking taxpayers. No wonder most Americans are frustrated with the government.
So we’re taking from those who need it &amp; giving to those who don’t – and guess who’s on the hook?
Additionally, recent reports by gov watchdogs show welfare benefits are often paid to ineligible individuals…
…but these programs aren’t delivering positive outcomes for the most vulnerable members of our communities.
Entitlement spending has exploded – roughly $1T a year by when you roll all the programs up…
Nat’l poverty rate was 14.7% in 1966 and 14.8% in 2014 (most recent) – despite gov spending between then and now.
Every system is perfectly designed to achieve the results it gets…

The VA needs fundamental reform.  Bureaucrats need to be held accountable. Our Vets deserve the best.  #priorities

Abandoning the commitment to restore our #coast would have irrevocable harm not only to Gulf South States but the entire nation.
Now, POTUS says those revenues are “unnecessary and costly”...and instead propose to use that money to help Alaska deal with rising seas.
Those funds are designated for #coastal restoration for states supporting offshore drilling, i.e. #Louisiana
Next year #Louisiana, AL, MS &amp; TX are slated to begin receiving a large portion of those funds – estimated at about $375 million.
Last week, POTUS announced intent to repeal a 2006 provision to share revenues from offshore drilling in the Gulf with 4 Gulf states...
