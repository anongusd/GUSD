Like Sherrod Brown, Clinton says the 2018 Georgia gov race was stolen: "Stacey Abrams should be governor, leading that state, right now."		She also says that Abrams "didn't just go on TV and make speeches," but actively worked to register voters and fight suppression. Hint, hint.
"We aren't going to win every fight," says Clinton. "Take that from me. But history teaches us that the times when the struggle feels the hardest are the times when marching forward is most important."
"We are living through a full-fledged crisis in our democracy," Hillary Clinton says at this voting rights/unity breakfast. Says we're living in a time when "racist and white supremacist views are lifted up in the media and the White House."
Lucky for all of you, the press section here is too far from the stage for me to get a good enough photo for a “she’s running” tweet.
Clinton is now being serenaded with a song titled "You're Still Rising." Sample lyrics: "You didn't let them take you down. You stood tall and stood your ground. You didn't let them take your shine. Higher mountains you still climb."
Brown, Booker, and Sanders used their short speeches at this unity breakfast to call for a restored Voting Rights Act; Sanders got big applause calling for automatic voter registration.
“If she was a man, this email thing would have lasted two weeks. Because she’s a woman it lasted two years.”
Sanders is a former state senator, apologies
"She won the election, and it was stolen from her," says Alabama Sen. Hank Sanders, introducing Clinton, who is being inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame here. "It was stolen from her by the FBI. It was stolen from her by the Russians."

Final policy riff from Bernie: Federal jobs guarantee, new housing (to attack gentrification), gun control, rural hospitals. Actually moved a couple inches left from 2016!
Sanders going after Trump now: "I did not come from a family of privilege that prepared me to entertain people on television by telling workers: “You’re fired.” I came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers."
One line from prepared bernie remarks that you don't hear many candidates use: "Because of all the work we have done, we are now on the brink of winning not just an election, but transforming our country."
Easy to forget now but by the final stretch even Jill Stein was saying Trump couldn't win, so it was safe to cast a protest vote. Not just "Hillary is bad," literally she can't lose. https://t.co/j2gZGJkpg8
Sidebar: A bunch of the voters I talked to at this Bernie rally did not vote for Hillary in 2016. Several said that they would have if they'd been in swing states, and that they went Dem in 2018. One did say he wouldn't vote for any 2020 Dem except Bernie and Tulsi.
Sanders's speech itself has barely touched on his bio -- so far that was left to surrogates. It's a lot like his standard stump, everything from expanding Social Security to transitioning to renewable energy to dismantling the "prison industrial complex."
Sanders talks about a 50-state campaign for 2020: "We will not concede a single state to Donald Trump."		I think the last candidate who did this was Nixon, who regretted his 11th hour Alaska trip

Thought experiment: What would happen if, in October 2020, the FBI announced a last-minute probe of some Trump scandal? My hunch is that years of working to discredit investigations into Trump would mean more backlash/base rallying than damage.

Sebastian Gorka says CPAC attendees are on "the front lines against communism" and that socialism has gripped the Democrats. "They want to take your pick-up truck. They want to take away your hamburger. This is what Stalin dreamt about but never achieved."
It's early, but one politician who has not been mentioned or pictured at all: Joe Biden, who currently leads in polls if he seeks the Democratic nomination.
The Democrat appearing in CPAC videos and speeches the most, by far: @AOC. More than any 2020 Dem. An Oliver North-narrated NRA video just ended with the footage of her dancing outside her office, with the color drained to make it look more ominous.
@aidachavez wow biased much

@MattGertz The big, bad, bionic boy has been here, baby.
30 minutes in: Two mentions of Venezuela, two of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.		Also, one thing always strikes me about the "he keeps his promises" line -- the effort to repeal the ACA has vanished from campaign rhetoric.
Meadows informs the crowd that Michael Cohen said "there was no evidence of Russian collusion."
Schlapp emphasizing the radicalism of Democrats: "Other Democrats who sought the presidency, they ran as centrists -- all of them."		This was... not the message when CPAC speakers were attacking Hillary and Obama.
Meadows says Democrats want to ban cows, then jokes that "the good news is that Chick-fil-A stock will go way up."
Matt Schlapp introducing Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows: "When you're in that hearing taking those stands, you're speaking for all of us."
The Warren section of the video was 100% about the DNA test, ending with a reporter asking if she'll drop out of the race. Holder = "when they're down, kick 'em." Lots of edits to make people look dumber, too, including AOC and Pelosi hesitating w answers.
The opening CPAC video is a humdinger -- opens with footage of Venezuela, cuts to a sort of "greatest hits" of Sanders, AOC, Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris, Eric Holder, Ilhan Omar, Ralph Northam, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and... Bill Maher.

Btw “Still Alice” is basically “The Lost Weekend” but for Alzheimer’s. Manipulative but it works.
My favorite accidental movie sub-genre is "melodrama that was supposed to set up a Best Actor win but didn't." From "Destroyer" to "Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot" to "Tully." Not everything can be "Still Alice."

Probably the hardest Q for Harris was about how she would pay for Green New Deal and Medicare for all. Voter who asked it says he’s supportive of both both can already see Rs using them to make attacks
Theater critic note: Harris has a tic, which I bet goes away as she holds more town halls, of repeating words that don't need repetition. eg, "It should not be that people should go through a system like this."
@BermudaTuba no sadly
Harris argues that Medicare for All will end up saving money, especially by putting "everybody on this side, and the pharma companies on the other side" -- "It's an investment, for which there will be a great return on investment."
Asked about how to pay for agenda given national debt, Harris starts by attacking the tax cut for the top 1%: "They need to give that money back."
Harris's answer to a "how do you separate yourself from this growing field" Q is pretty tautological but gets a lot of applause: "We need fighters on the stage who know how to fight. I do."
@drvox This seems like the reason why the most effective way of stopping action is to create a front group that lobbies for this sort of stuff but doesn't do anything, a la 2009.
Talking about teachers, Harris (as she did yesterday) veers onto @SherrodBrown's Dignity of Work riff. "Labor has dignity, and we’ve got to give it the dignity of the work that is being performed, and the skills that go into that work."
Harris sets up a LOT of her answers by saying "let's speak this truth." Often the answer itself is pretty uncontroversial -- more money for public schools -- but it has the virtue of framing this like a "she went there" answer.
First big applause line: "Putting money into public education is better than putting money into mass incarceration."
First Q (from mayor) is just: Talk about being a prosecutor. "We've been offered a false choice: Are you soft on crime or tough on crime? The right approach is smart on crime." The criticism of her record from the left has not sunk in here at all.
@mattyglesias Gotta hear both sides.
The two rhetorical themes Harris keeps returning to: "We are better than this" and "we have more in common than what separates us." Like Booker, she's signed onto lefty bills but doesn't lead with that.
aaaand it's starting! "I know you've been waiting, guys," says the mayor of Columbia.

Best story Hickenlooper has to tell is probably about passage of gun control measures, which dealt him some political setbacks at the time. “Once you get the momentum changed, all sorts of things will pass.”
Hickenlooper describes how he opposed marijuana legalization and admits he was mostly wrong. “We’re five years into it and all the things we feared haven’t happened.”
Q about how he reaches Trump voters. Recalls what he learned about economic frustration after he was laid off in the 1980s. “I was one of 20,000 geologists laid off in seven years... we did that same thing to millions of people in the 80s and 90s.”

Cheney posits a sort of travel "death panel," which simply does not exist. You argue -- citing the California HSR news -- that it's unrealistic to say there'd be enough rail to ease people off air travel. But there is no mechanism *anywhere* to regulate who can take what transit.
The whole "Green New Deal will outlaw cars and planes" thing, which is false, is now firmly embedded in GOP messaging. Probably would have been the message anyway, but the botched FAQ really teed it up. Here's Liz Cheney today: https://t.co/IzGJ1DmOxL

In 2016, voters said neither Trump or Clinton were honest. In 2020 it’s possible they see only see Trump that way, which would obviously be a problem if he says his opponent will ban cows.
In short interview after her Iowa City event, @TulsiGabbard says she’s still studying Green New Deal and worries it isn’t specific enough. For example: She wants to ban fracking and nuclear power.
I’m not sure how this shakes out. On the one hand, AOC staff wrote a FAQ that invited the attack. On the other, the actual resolution includes none of this, and if anything POTUS sounds hard to believe when he says, like, Cory Booker will ban cars. https://t.co/N8Dhw9AeOP

First Q to Gabbard: Will she "team up" with Bernie if he runs?		"Bernie and I had a great conversation when I decided to run. I don't know what his plans are, but we are both deeply committed to our cause."

This is a nagging Q for Sanders, too. His supporters believe he was vetted in 2016. But look at Warren — she reasonably thought the “fake Indian” stuff was buried when she beat Scott Brown, then Trump started hitting it, and it was reborn.

Second Q to Booker is about charter schools. "I know there's a lot of charter debates, but that's 3 percent of our schools," he says. Wants "great public education for all of our children."
Like Brown, Booker points out that the ACA almost allowed a Medicare buy-in for people 55 and over. "If we had done that, it would have massively expanded health care for millions of Americans." Brown shames Lieberman by name for this; Booker says "we were one vote short."
Booker brings his Newark experience into the Medicare answer: "According to the last census, my neighborhood is about $14,000 per family... if you don't believe the system is broken, you need to wake up to the challenges I see."
First Q to Booker is about $15 min wage and Medicare for All. You see what a plus it is that Phil Murphy won that gov race: Booker is able to say "We passed the $15 minimum wage in my state" and get applause.
One of Booker's big laugh lines is describing himself on the couch "watchin' Rachel" and getting angry. "I say, somebody should do something! And then I think: Come on, you're a senator, man!"

@kerpen Yeah, there's a big gap between the legislation (aspirational, not much to pin down) and the FAQ (America will be Berkeley by 2030).
@kerpen I read the "farting cows and airplanes" line as hyperbole, because you're not going to get rid of either.
@johnkartch More than "we just need to come together and make commonsense deals"
Making air travel "less necessary" does not mean banning air travel. If in 2030 you can take HSR (instead of Southwest) from Houston to Dallas, that does not cut down on flights to Hawaii. https://t.co/YYDZp17Zpi

The split-screen between the Green New Deal launch and the Schultz speech really emphasizes how *much* policy debate is going on in the Democratic primary. Some of it incredibly risky. 		Not much going on in centrism-ville.
Actual quote: "Health care costs are the biggest driver of unaffordable care." https://t.co/HjKYMxucBG
A true Chauncey Gardner-ism from Schultz: "Health care costs are the biggest driver of unaffordable care."
More Schultz: "We must enact a commonsense immigration reform that most Americans already say that they want."		Here's his constant problem: Every policy he demands a Centrist President address is basically an Obama policy that got blocked.

@swcarlson1 My understanding is that it's *intended* to break the old dynamic in which female accusers just weren't taken seriously, replacing it with one where they're heard out and their claims are investigated. But yes, it's become "if you're accused you must resign."
@JerylBier Anyway I agree with you. Even in the Kavanaugh drama, the normal elected Dem response was "I find CBF credible but will wait for the hearing" followed by "I find her credible" etc. Not: "I believe all women and therefore Kavanaugh must be withdrawn."
Makes sense when you think about it. "Believe women" implies that if a he-said/she-said situation arises, you take the female accuser seriously. "Believe all women" implies that every allegation must be believed.

Point is, a Dem can win the White House handily while losing around 85-90% of “conservative” voters. The Senate is a different story.
Outside of green rooms, “Trump-skeptical conservatives” don’t have much clout. In 2016, per exit poll, “conservative” voters backed Trump by 65 points. In 2018, conservatives back GOP House candidates by 67 points. Dems doubled margin w moderate voters. https://t.co/c2hXyrJ1K9

There are now nine active candidates for the Democratic nomination -- i.e., candidates with actual campaigns or committees organizing in early states.		Only one of them, John Delaney, is a straight white man.
"He’s not going to sign a bill that doesn’t have money for the wall... if he gives in now, that’s the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president. That’s probably the end of his presidency."		- Lindsey Graham, January 2
Sometimes God takes away an Ojeda and gives you a Buttigieg.

Never, ever say “it can’t get dumber.”
@ryanlcooper But the nagging issue is that polling said, as late as the summer of 2016, that Clinton would clobber Trump! It really does have to be sorted with campaigning.
This feels like a re-framing of what Dem leaders want? Just open the government then hold a vote on the wall itself, which will fail. Shades of the "uh, don't worry, you'll get a doomed Balanced Budget Amendment vote" deal Boehner used to offer his right. https://t.co/HRAl9s74Z1

Amazing little fact I found while researching something else: John James, the talented black US Senate candidate in MI, won just 8% of the black vote. That's 2 points more than Trump 2016... it's actually 2 points less than Bush's 2004 performance in MI.

@TPCarney Several Dems have put it to me like this: If voters just want the Trump show to end, Dems pick Biden. If there's anger that Trump promised change and people didn't get it, Biden is toast.
One reason there's not "more outrage" about Sanders calling Trump a racist is that he's said this for three years, and most of us cover news instead of trying to create content for TV panels. https://t.co/L7Q8IURBl0
But any reporter who's spent time in early states hears it again and again: "I love Biden, but he's too old/he's had his time/I want to see a fresh face" etc. I think this changes if Trump bounces back and, like, Biden is leading him by +10 and no other Dem is ahead.

Sanders, who famously dislikes talking about himself: “I had the honor of being in Washington in 1963 for the ‘I have a dream’ speech. Let us not forget that the title of that march was ‘jobs and freedom.”

Sanders gets applause when he calls for “constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote and automatic registration.”		Something I’ve noticed is that other candidates who share these positions try to build flowery rhetoric around them. Sanders just runs down the agenda.
Sanders: “We have a president of the United States who is a racist... he is intentionally, purposefully, trying to divide us up by race, by where we come from, by religion.”		He says this on the trail, and today it comes after a number of intro speakers called Trump racist.

Gillibrand talking about 9/11 first responders bill, which was the project that really put her in spotlight first time, and has a good ending — unanimous passage
@sdkstl #gaffe
Second time on this trip for a fav Gillibrand line: “I worked with Ted Cruz on ending sexual harassment in Congress. I can work with anybody.”
Cheers go up when Gillibrand gets passed a beer. “Did you know that grapefruit was my favorite?” Back to climate change, she says put a price on carbon.
“We will create an entire renewable economy, not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.”
Discussing climate change, Gillibrand chokes back tears when describing a woman who was killed by flooding during Hurricane Sandy. “There’s not enough money in the world to make people whole from the damage of global climate change.”
Gillibrand hands mic to activist who says she’ll have the most ethical campaign bc of harassment rules. “We need to have a presidential campaign that doesn’t have sexual misconduct on it.”
*anyone BUT himself
“Her fear is being created by a president who doesn’t care about anyone by himself.” Policy idea here: Putting most immigration enforcement back in DOJ but giving more independence to immigration courts.
Gillibrand describes conversation w GOP voter worried about crime coming across border. “That is the division and hate that Donald Trump has created. Why are we a country that should be afraid of immigrants? We are founded by immigrants!”
(Pointless digression: If SNL doesn’t get Kristen Bell to play Gillibrand there’s something wrong with the universe.)
Gillibrand goes more explicitly against Trump than any other Dem in the race so far. “He is ripping apart the moral fabric of our country.”
Biggest applause line so far: “I’m not taking corporate PAC money. I’m not taking federal lobbyist money. I don’t think people should have individual super PACs.” (Of course, the Dem nominee will be backed by Priorities USA and other existing super PACs.)
Gillibrand says her post-2016 listening tour revealed to her that Trump won by aping Dem messaging. “He said the system is rigged — that’s Liz Warren’s message. He said, no bad trade deals — that’s Bernie’s message.”
For second time tells audience that she found support for “Medicare for All” in her old district, but again, defines it as a buy-in. (She is a cosponsor of Medicare for All bill.)
Gillibrand, at final Iowa event of this trip, telling crowd about strategist who told her she couldn’t win in 2006. A favorite laugh line: When she asked what would happen if the incumbent R was indicted. “It depends on what he’s indicted for.” https://t.co/115ND13ayx

I've been to every Iowa stop so far by Warren and Gillibrand. One thing that stands out: Apart from one voter Q about the DNA test (to Warren), no one (media or voters) are asking for responses to specific Trump comments.

Yes. The "abolish ICE" campaign was always premised on this: That it was a mistake to route all immigration enforcement into "homeland security." https://t.co/4AiuqbDg0M
Gillibrand gives a very detailed answer on her "abolish ICE" position: She wants to split immigration enforcement back into one agency that deals with terrorism/crime, one that deals with migrants.
Gillibrand gets a Puerto Rican statehood Q. "It sounds good to me. Why shouldn't they have two senators and [congressional] representation?" Statehood itself is up to PR voters but they should get voting members. "We should vitiate all the debt PR holds." (cc @SeanMcElwee)

@mattyglesias But she did dissolve parliament early! Tories won in 2015, election wasn't scheduled, she called a snap election bc polling looked good, then she stepped on like 31,389 rakes and lost her working majority.
This is very good, especially the quick part about the role of "resistance grifters" in all this.		My guess is that Omar got over her skis with the tweet, and used the TV hit to clear it up. But then people pretended she didn't clear it up. https://t.co/16P9PFKKtw

I really think that the two party bases getting entirely different news is the defining fact of modern politics, even if it seems obvious.
Context: Cardenas runs Bold PAC, the CHC electoral wing, which ran last weekend's Puerto Rico junket. That people need this explained suggests that the "Dems partied in Puerto Rico" stuff didn't reach escape velocity out of Fox News. https://t.co/VSTO0eQx4Q

@ddale8 @LevineJonathan To be fair, "politely asking for a clarification" is as angry as I've ever seen a Canadian get.
It's not "semantics" to point out that Omar never said this! Good lord. https://t.co/8S0OrT5knE
I was curious bc I think the "lol Putin is blackmailing Graham bc he's gay" stuff is completely odious. I had wondered if Omar would explain what "compromised" meant. She did! It wasn't the blackmail crap!
People: Watch the video clip. It's short. You can make many arguments against Omar but *at no point in the interview* did she suggest what this garbage viral tweet is suggesting. https://t.co/xSAtjYdh7R

@Atrios Yeah, "but what about the debt" has been seen as an Important question in prez races for as long as I've been voting.
@SethAMandel I've paid closer attention to the reasons Democrats who support BDS give for doing so. Omar's said she supports the concept but wonders if it's effective in getting a Palestinian state, which is her goal.

Omar has spoken favorably about BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions to pressure Israel on a Palestinian state) so this is a big deal that will draw plenty of negative attention.
The idea that you can win the shutdown by owning Dems with Wall Facts and Wall Logic leapt very quickly from Scott Adams to Fox. (Basically Pelosi’s “a Wall is an immorality” quote, referring to the border, has become “Do Dems hate all walls?”) https://t.co/jp3ZXQ3JbE
