@AOC My concern is not you riding in cars or taking subways. My concern is that it cost over 29,000.00 for car rides and over 8,000.00 for the subway. How can it possibly cost that much????

@jonfavs Climate change is a 64 billion dollars per year business. The GND incorporates much more into it then fighting climate change. It would completely change life as we know it and would cost trillions. Lets plant trees and pick up trash. See my page for a climate change video.
Something to consider: https://t.co/9KS8NiRHuq	@AOC @SenSanders @SenKamalaHarris @SenBooker
@AOC Take a look at this: https://t.co/9KS8NiRHuq
@AOC You have a big problem that is getting bigger with MS13. You should be grateful there are people risking their lives to protect you and this country. It is time you start facing reality instead of spouting your nonsense. Find the facts before you speak or type. Dangerous Girl.
@BernieSanders Bernie will sit in the White House with his millions and three houses, while people are taxed out of their homes. Look at Cuba and Venesula, people. Socialism is CONTROL over the masses.
@BernieSanders Bernie, you are going to need money for your socialist platform. Who is going to pay for college, health care, child care, global warming? Have you crunched the numbers? You don't seem to care that it will break this county. Dictator Bernie.

@Shakes320 @_camilletweets @PattyMurray Furthermore, why are they debating no resuscitation if a child should be born after a "botched" abortion? Who is this law for? Certainly not the child. Certainly not for someone that wants a child. Why is this measure a discussion?
@Shakes320 @_camilletweets @PattyMurray There is nothing wrong with me. I am not shaming any woman who wants and loses a child. That is heartbreaking.

@MyGreenEyes2005 @RepChipRoy We were talking about the Coen circus. Were did you see in this thread that I voted for or support Trump? You have been attacking me because we disagree about the Coen hearing. Your response above seems very immature, angry and hateful to me. Your behavior makes my point.
@MyGreenEyes2005 @RepChipRoy We are going there. My Dad served in Korea. My Uncle was a Green Beret. My cousin lost his leg in Vietnam. Other cousins and friends served in Vietnam. My sister and brother-in-law are career Air Force/ Air National Guard who served in Desert Storm. Why are you angry and hateful?
@bknbwdwi @coolworld0 @RepChipRoy I agree with SuzyQ. The media plays to their audiance, rather then presenting the facts. Flip news channels some time and you will see. Try Al Jazeera, Sky News, etc. for a change. Keep an eye on what is being taught in your children's schools and colleges. Be objective to learn.
@SenGillibrand I am sorry  I voted for you. I don't think we should be forced to have our tax dollars pay for abortions. People can pay for their own. Fund childrens hospitals. Fund adoptions. Fund education, after school programs, and the arts for children. Who stands with me on this issue?

@Shakes320 @_camilletweets @PattyMurray Kelly D, it is your body and your responsibility. Are you having sex if the man doesn't have protection with him and turn around and blame him? Pfft! YOU need to be responsible! No protection. No cookie. That IS common sense.

@Shakes320 @_camilletweets @PattyMurray Yes Kelly D, i am putting the responsibility on the woman. It is not a sexist, misogynisitic statement. I am a woman! I am tired of people not taking responsibility for their own bodies and behavior. Always blame someone else? Make your problem, mine? No. Take responsibility.
@_camilletweets @PattyMurray Camille that is a stupid statement. I tried to think of a polite word, but none come to mind at the moment. It is not about controlling someone's body.

@RCAstudios @BernieSanders No the politicans should NOT be involved unless it is lowing the tax on it. I don't know how it works in Canada, but here the individual pays in 6.2% of their salary and the employer matches it. Self employeed pay the full 12.4%. The Fed Govt should NEVER have access to it.
@BernieSanders Keep your hands off the actual SS, Bernie. Pass a bill that will reduce the tax rate, and raise the total income before it is taxed to a reasonable cost of living rate of $50,000, or so.
@RCAstudios @BernieSanders To add to what I said, SS is a separate department in the Federal Govt. We do NOT need or want politicans hands in the pot. They would bankrupt it or use it for other causes. They just need to cut the taxes on it.
@RCAstudios @BernieSanders We pay in our entire careers and then the federal govt taxes the heck out of it when we collect.

@Wrcj80 @ReneeLHavener @NYGovCuomo I agree. My problem with this GND is that it is a generalized pie in the sky promise without taking into consideration how a change over would effect everyday life. It may evolve over hundred years, but not in ten or twenty.

@SenSanders You find problems. You complain about problems. You blame others for the problems. What are YOU doing to fix the problems?
@Ilhan @IlhanMN Who spouted hate? When? What was said?
@RepStefanik Thank you for your service
@marthamaccallum Shame on Warren.
@TeamPelosi @IlhanMN He asked everyone to work together. You are preparing everyone to obstruct? What is your problem? You distort the truth. You should have paid attention instead of looking at papers? We did.
@SenSanders Read what you just said and then tell me how we will live once you tax us out of our food, shelter, and clothing.
@IlhanMN Can you please check into geoengineering? What branch of our Govt is funding it. How much is being spent? How is it being used? Thank you if you do find out.
@SpeakerPelosi @staceyabrams @realDonaldTrump Out of touch? You can not give him credit for anything. Your eyes were stabbing him. You want to stand there. You were distespectful to the office by not standing. What was with wearing the white? You know "Gangs" wear their colors, too.
@PattyMurray You just send out the same Tweets day after day. No one can work with the Dems until they stop the obstruction. You are all guilty for the shutdown. Congress could have overridden it.
@GOPLeader I vote freedom.
@AOC Could you look into geoengineering? Are metels being put into our atmosphere? Are we being poisoned? Who is paying for this?  Could you look into the effects of 5G as well?
@SenSanders Why do you not understand that controled legal immigration would save more money to use for other programs? Why do you not want security for our country? Your socialism would take our liberties and enslave us. Rational people using logic do not want it.
@SenSchumer If you took as much time to do your job instead of wasting it tearing down the @potus, maybe something would be accomplished. Stop your obstruction.
@SenSchumer I was under the impression it is the Senate that creates the Bills/laws and the President signs off on them once they pass the house. There is too much infighting and obstruction. You and Pelosi are guilty of this.

@SenSchumer We lack border security. We have drugs flowing through our borders. You turn your backs on it, yet want us to trust you? All you want is our money and our rights.
@SenSanders Those people can find a way to take their money out of the country or find other ways to protect it. STOP trying to steal money you did not earn and that does not belong to you. Give ten people 100,000 of your money. Spread your wealth.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You, Ms Pelosi and Schumer are culpable in the shut down, if not moreso than anyone else. People are seeing through you and your schemes.

@IlhanMN Where do you get off saying "most" Americans support your 70% marginal tax? I doubt it. Keep running with that and the Dems may lose their Hollywood crowd in 2020. Keep your hands away from money you did not earn.
@sfmf1982 @JoseyRider @PattyMurray @POTUS I support @potus, and his request for border walls/fencing. It is time Democrats stop their obstruction.

@kevinbhudson @PattyMurray Well said. Thank you.
@PattyMurray How can anyone work with people that refuse to listen to the experts/ Border Patrol agents?  No use of logic. No concern for the agents. No reasonable negotiations. No accountability. No Democrats in 2020.
@PattyMurray Perhaps the President is doing his job and keeping his promise to the country in spite of Democrats obstruction? Look at 10USC 274/284? Could it be? I hope so.
@IlhanMN @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley Do your job to help stop illegal immagration and families would not be seperated. People with criminal records are seperated. Would you rather have immigrants living in tent cities and stadiums in filth as they are in Mexico? Stop the propaganda.

@PattyMurray I thought it was clear that a wall is not needed from sea to shining sea. Fencing is required in some areas per border patrol. Will those areas be covered?
@BernieSanders You can not afford it. Crunch the numbers. Free is not free. You will take more of our money through taxes and force us to use services the Govt chooses. Not Democratic to me.
@RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Klan? Are you being racist? I do think you are being racist. Shame on you.

@PattyMurray It looks like you people lied when you said you'd come tighter these three weeks to work something out with the Republicans. Are you saying that you people lied to get your own way and are going to do what you damned well want with total disreguard of how it will effect citizens?
@SenatorDurbin Democrats and past Presidents have voted for border security/ fences and immigration reform. Why is it different for Trump to ask for the same? If you had approved the 5.7B, which is one tenth of one percent of the budget, you would have saved the taxpayers 5.3B.  Approve it now.
@SenSanders Add voter id and term limits to your list, please.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump 5.7 billion for the fence and border security and immigration reform would have cost a lot less. It is time for all reasonable minds to work together to find solutions.

Get past blame game.
@BeyondFables @SenJackyRosen @realDonaldTrump There were no strings attached to the Coast Guard getting paid. It was a "clean" bill. Do your homework.
@BeyondFables @SenJackyRosen @realDonaldTrump May I suggest you follow Senators in both parties and watch the Senate votes on C-Span2. You may be surprised what you find.
@BeyondFables @SenJackyRosen @realDonaldTrump It was the Republicans that wanted to pay the coast guard. Schumer opposed it.
@BeyondFables @SenJackyRosen @realDonaldTrump Members of congress are adults and elected officals. I watched the votes today. I am sick and tired of the constant blame game. If the Dems proposed it a month ago why would they turn it down now? That is just ridiculous.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Schumer, you and Pelosi knew from day one @realDonaldTrump wanted funding for the fence and border security. You knew it and yet submit proposals without out it. You act like American citizens are fools and don't see through your BS. Enough is enough! You end this shut down.
@RepDavidTrone @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Mr Trone, people are seeing who the game players are in this shut down. People's lives are not a game. Border security is not a game. The insincere officials need to stop playing and negotiate tomorrow. Include the 5.7B and open this Gov.
@realDonaldTrump Please don't back down on border security for our country. It should have been taken care of years ago.
@PattyMurray You are correct. This shutdown is unnessary. Give the 5.7B for border security and open the Gov. tomorrow. Enough is enough!
@SenatorDurbin Mr Durbin, you know what is needed to open the Gov. 5.7 B for border security. Include it in the proposal and open the Gov.
@SenSanders Go into the meeting on Thursday with a plan that also includes the 5.7 B to protect our border and the Border Patrol that are also working without pay. Stop blaming and start doing.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump promised border security and a wall/fence, which you voted for in the past. The Dems refuse to give him the money. Go in there Thursday with a plan that includes it.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP I hope there is money for sections of walls the Border Patrol has requested. I guess we have to wait to see if this is a good faith bill or just another smoke screen.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Ms Pelosi, will you post this bill so we the people can take a look at it? I bet we can let you know if it will be accepted or a waste of everyones time. Thanks for doing something. Doing something is appreciated.

@SenatorDurbin Perhaps you people should put together a proposal that will be accepted and put an end to this shut down. It's too easy to say no to every proposal. You need to negotigate!
@lori_goldstein Perhaps LOGO and other fashion brands can donate ten percent of their profits to food pantries for federal workers and the coast guard until this shut down ends?

@lori_goldstein Lori, please look at the whole picture. There is a crisis at the mexican border. Those officers have a thankless job and are going without pay. Trump is asking for ten percent of one percent of the budget for a wall that Democrates supported in the past.
@WashTimes @tedcruz He should do it from the border with border security and the angel moms.
@lori_goldstein @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr I disagree. Pelosi refuses to negoiate, keeps going out of the country, refuses to talk with border patrol and angel moms, and lied about security for State of the Union. We need security. People need to be paid.
@HarveyLevinTMZ She is immature. She is not informed.
@SpeakerPelosi Stop the smoke screen. You were grounded today from taking a seven day trip which would have left federal workers without pay another week. Stop pretending to care.
@LindseyGrahamSC I disagree with you. She can go in the future after she brings her party together for border security and end the shut down. The only trip she should be allowed to take is to the southern border. I back our President.
@enews You need to do your homework and educate yourself. Once you do, you would know who needs to do what to get this shut down opened again.

@realDonaldTrump You are correct. Why is Pelosi and Schumer getting paid?
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @senatemajldr You are a self serving witch saying no one tenth of one percent of the total budget for border security rather then your selfish ego. You were hired to protect the peoples interests, not your own. Do your job!
@SenSchumer Pelosi is showing herself as the witch she is and you her warlock keeping pay from workers over 10 percent of 1 percent of the national budget. Shame on you both.
@marcorubio @POTUS Please do not give in to Schumer and Pelosi. A wall and security make sense and are needed.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump What have you done to end it? Saying no to border security and a wall is not ending it. You and Schumer are the reason people are going without pay. Such a shame your egos are more important to you.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Mr Schumer the cost of the wall is one tenth of one percent of the budget. You have voted to fund border security in the past. Why are YOU holding american paychecks hostage?
@NancySinatra @lori_goldstein @SpeakerPelosi @TeamPelosi @realDonaldTrump Pelosi and Schumer are making rude comments but are not offering solutions to end the shut down. They flip floped on a wall they voted for in the past. You trust them?
@SenSanders Give the border security and the American people the wall and you will end this shut down.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You and Pelosi persist on not funding the wall. Who is stubborn?
@SpeakerPelosi If you actually take these two years and do right by the people, you might be able to be the first female President. Build the wall on Trump. It will be done and not your worry. Do what will be best for the Americans. Talk to us.
@SpeakerPelosi You do not listen. You do not talk to the public. You have lost touch. Go to Washington State and see what Come east and see what elderly need. Go south and protect our border. Open your eyes for the people!
@SpeakerPelosi You just say, "no" to anything and want us to believe you are not part of the problem? Go look in a mirror.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Tell us why they will not pass it. Tell the full facts
@SpeakerPelosi I told you to go to the border, talk, do your homework. No, you didn't. The President did! You need to talk to the workers and citizens to do what is right by them. You have lost touch. Get it back before 2020
@Bernardforster8 Nice to meet you.
@RepAnthonyBrown @SpeakerPelosi No one opposes the wall. Get a reality check. All have voted for a wall since 2006. You are out of touch. Stand with our President and do your job.
@SpeakerPelosi You and Shumer shut it down and the people know.
@SpeakerPelosi You might be able to run for President in 2020 and win if you will get in touch with the American people and do what is needed, and show us you will not be a dictator.
@SpeakerPelosi Why don't you back what everyone has wanted and knows what will work? A wall. Plain and simple common sense. There is nothing wrong to say you are wrong if you do the right thing afterwards. That will bring respect.
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey Graham is becoming my hero.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Are you having dinner tonight? I bet you are. Think about that.
@TheDailyShow I realize Trevor wants ratings but maybe you people should go to the border, talk to security and find out what is really going on.
@RashidaTlaib You are an elected official who should be representing the American people. You took office and immediately spoke like a gutter whore. Shame on you. You will never represent the true ladies and gentlemen of the United States.
@TMZ You should regret it. You are an elected official representing people of the United States. That is your job that you are being paid to do. Your voice should be that of the people and not a vulgar little girl.
@KimKardashian My Dad made us change our own tires, fill the gas tank, and change the oil and filters. Good things to know how to do.
@RepStefanik Please stand by the American people and border security and a border wall.
@RepJohnKatko Do not give up on security, law enforcement, or the border wall. As a retired Correctional officer, I can say "walls/fences" do work. Stand by us, please in regards to border security.
@RepJohnKatko Please do not give up on the American Border Security, our President and the people of the United States. We WANT the wall.
@lisamurkowski Please do NOT break rank with our President and Border Security.
I have to wonder if we should jump parties, and find some people with common sense. We can vote these people in office out and vote in a government that does stand for the people. Just a thought. @SenSchumer , @SpeakerPelosi
I see @SenSchumer  and @SpeakerPelosi  dancing around with their fingers in their ears saying, "you can't make us"! Such a shame @realDonaldTrump  that these two will not do the best for American people. They offer no help. I think they should not be paid. Our @POTUS donates his.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He said, "bye-bye" when you and Nancy wouldn't negotiate. I'd walk out too. You two think, "no" is an answer? You two are acting like brats with your fingers in your ears.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Pelosi stop using the American people and give us the wall. You are not listening to the people.
@SenSchumer People see through your political tactics. You are keeping the paychecks from these people by not funding a wall you voted for over the years.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What do you want? What viable solutions do you have? Stop this nonsence, please.
@FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP You are a beautiful elegant First Lady. Thank you.
@CBSNews @LindseyGrahamSC @FaceTheNation Thank you for doing a good job.
@SpeakerPelosi You and Schumer should educated yourselves. Go to the border. Talk with the border patrol officers and military. Visit the places where migrants are dying trying to cross into the USA. Stop this political nonsense and build the wall. It is moral.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You and Polosi should educated yourselves. Go to the border. Talk with the border patrol officers and military. Visit the places where migrants are dying trying to cross into the USA. Stop this political nonsense and build the wall to save lives and money.
Congress — Stop Sabotaging The White House And Get Back To Business https://t.co/1zaIwyw7Dj
Happy New Year. A wall will save lives and dollars. Please do the reseach yourselves and not depend on other people's word, who have their own agendas.
@realDonaldTrump Stand your ground with them, please. They are flip flops.	https://t.co/MI2EoVNPBu
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/MI2EoVNPBu
@ericstonestreet Happy New Year.
@SenSchumer Merry Christmas.
@SenSchumer Forget about our President for a moment and do what is RIGHT for our country and South America. People are dying, and being robbed to come to the USA.  A wall will protect us and them. There has been too many needless deaths. It will pay for itself within years and save lives.
@SenSchumer A wall may protect us all. There has been too many needless deaths. https://t.co/ALIji2Zt93 … You wanted to secure the boarders years ago. Obama and Hilary wanted to.  Do it now for North and South America. Do what is good for the people.
@ChuckySchumer A wall may protect us all. There has been too many needless deaths. https://t.co/ALIji2Zt93 You wanted to secure the boarders years ago. Obama and Hilary wanted to.  Do it now for North and South America. Do what is good for the people.
@realDonaldTrump Please stand strong for your country. Our country. We need to have a presence in other counties for intel and peace. We do need to protect our boarders to protect our citizens and those of South America. A Wall. https://t.co/ALIji2Zt93
@realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas. You are doing a good job. Please do NOT back down on the Wall. It will save lives. You will make history making America Great Again. Stand Tall and Proud.
You won NYS. Come the the North Country and ask how we want you to represent us?  Not doing your job for all of us.
I will talk with you any time of day or night and bring people from NYS. You are NOT representing the average person in NYS
Chuck @ChuckySchumer representing NYS????????? We are fine with Canada. We want the wall with Mexico.  How can you have a Merry Christmas with people without pay? We want the wall!
Nancy Polosi is NOT my hero! She wants a job and more money for doing nothing to represent the people.
@realDonaldTrump Stand up for us. We do want the wall to save lives and be fair in the immigration pool. We do need to make America Great Again.
@ChuckySchumer We want the wall. Do your job and represent us.
Gov shut down? Ask why! Ask Schumer!
@BBCandice Too many have hustled people to get a green card. It is unfair. She doesn't seem to have any feelings toward him.
@AngelaMcCourt55 OMG!!!!!!!!!! Fake, fake, fake! Why did they let her on 90 day?
@sydcamp Why be angry at her? She is young. Paul is older and is immature with other issues to boot! I worry for her.
@mirandasthebest Jon's friend smirked when he revealed Jon's previous relationships. He was NOT being a friend at that moment to either Jon or Rachal.
@angelamariex3 I went through the process and the regulations need to be overhauled. It is a financial burden. It would be better if the fiance could also get a work permit before marriage. Extending the 90 days to a year would allow people to see if it will work.
@TheDapperPup They are both immature. She due to age and he is without the excuse of age.
@navyplush I agree it was hard to watch. She expected a "magical moment" from someone she is falling for. He did not express himself well, so she felt second best, as would I.
Jesse hitting the arm rest in the car during slow traffic tells me he is frustrated and has a short temper. Darcy seems to want to create the perfect relationship, without being aware of the reality of their relationship. Maybe counsiling sessions would have helped? #90DayFiance
@vperot I felt bad for her. She was being wined and dined and found out it had originaly planned for another. He did NOT communicate well will her and that is a shame on him. He should have kept his mouth shut.
I like Darcy and Jesse, but not together.  I think the age difference does play into the toxidity of their relationship in a negative way. Chemistry is fine, but day to day life is routine, and they argue about everything. #90DayFiance
@bigbrotherfan35 He will be stuck, and should be stuck in Nigera. He has scammed her. Been there, done that to me. Angela, RUN!!!!!!!
I want it to work for Jon and Rachal. I think he would be a great dad and husband. I hope they can find a way to have a family together. #90DayFiance
#90DayFinace Jon and Rachel, just love you both together!
#90DayFinace Ricky just wants someone. I get it, but there will not be a good future without honesty.
I was pretty at 50 and didn't know it until I look back. Ladies, love yourself! #LOVE_YOURSELF_結_Answer
I wrote this because I'd rather see a resume of jobs and job preformance and not putting down others. I'd never hire someone who is not a team player.
#90DayFinace Go home, Angela. Protect yourself and go home.
#90DayFinace Michael and Angela have no chance. Too much of a cultural and age difference. I bet she'd be a hoot to hang with, but she needs to leave him alone and let him have a life. He's a boy to her.
#90DayFinace Darcey and Jessie need to split. I like both, but there is too much of an age difference and insecuities. A relationship should be loving and fun.
#90DayFinace Love Rachel and Jon. I think they have the strongest relationship and can work it out.
#90DayFinace Congrats to Karine and Paul. I hope it works out. Bless you both.
@RealitySpoon I agree Angela is not a normal American 20/30 year old woman. She is an old woamn who wants to have a young man work for her. Not marriage material. She needs a redneck her own age!
@heathermcnall15 Yeah and she spent the night thinking he went to see her. Pfft! I'd be furious if someone did that to me.
@Ilispeaks One that doesn't have a family ogf his own and wants to make a nice girl he doesn't know cry. Shame on him!
@dwrm2230 Angela is too old and not in love enough with him  to want to know his culture. She needs to get her butt back to redneckville.
@Ann_Deeeez Karine and Paul need to wait. Paul does have issues and she needs the chance to grow.
@MandaPandaAF I think Darcey is a strong independent woman. However, I think she becomes insecure around Jesse and pulls away and becomes bossy.  She wants a 24 yr old daddy for her teen girls. That is NOT realistic!
#90dayfiancebeforethe90days 	Darcey needs to be herself and lay off Jesse. Karine needs to stay at home and let Paul go home.
@ericstonestreet My favorite scene was when Cam ended up in the tree in costume and couldn't get down.
#DrPhil  Those parents are hurting that young woman.
@TMZ That is sad. I hope they work it out together.
#90DayFiance  Molly needs to send Louis home. He is immature. Annie needs to run back to her country. She will not be happy or protected.  Azan will never trust and is not ready for marriage.
Old Woman and a Dog will start our journey this week. "Old Woman and a Dog Travel". More to come.

I will vote Trump and Adde Russell (Assembywoman for the 116th district) on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.	I still have to decide on others.
Funny how this garbage about Trump is coming out now? Who is paying for that, and what is their  (Democrats) agenda?
@KimKardashian  So sad what happened. Be safe above all! It is not your fault there are criminals. Just be safe.
I am sickened by media spin. Republicans should represent us. If not, they should not have a job. I vote @realDonaldTrump
@mike_pence @realDonaldTrump I back Trump and Pense
I am a single female, college educated, retired, and will vote for Trump. We need a change and someone real to speak for us.
I am certain money was spent to do the research.	Be careful what you say or post. It can haunt you.
I watched the debate tonight. I found Hillary to be on the attcak and somewhat smug. I wonder who PAID to find old tapes  @realDonaldTrump .
@TMZ He didn't need her permission to write or publish the song.
@TMZ Nor should they.
@realDonaldTrump I'd probably let him speak, too. He sounded like a backstabbing sore loser.
@TMZ I think she did agree. I think she did know that the call was recorded. I bet she has the same copy at her end. It is publicty, people
Who pays the bills at CNN? I am finding their coverage totally bias.

@TMZ That emoji may have been what was needed to express anger and defuse the situation,  and just be that and nothing more.
@TMZ Yes, I'd take heed, depending on past history with the person.	 But, to arrest someone for sending an emoji is ridiculous.
@TMZ  You can not prosecute people for something by projecting ones/yours interpertation into what they were thinking at the time.
@TMZ Maybe the emoji's should be banned?
@jessetyler His response sounded "rude" to me. I am learning to "ban" rude negative people. Everyone deserves to live happily.

@KimKardashian She is beautiful.
@KimKardashian How do you balance your marriage, children, and your appearences?
@TMZ @lovebscott Kim has much more class. Why would she drag herself down to their level?
@TMZ @etnow Body language. When Lauren sat, her knees were crossed away from Ben.
I finally had the opportunity to watch, "I Am Cait". I agree with her more then not. I hope she expands herself to womanhood.
@TMZ There were officers on duty that had to protect him, and those around him. They put themselves in harms way to do their job.
