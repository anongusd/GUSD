@realDonaldTrump The US is paying my father Social Security even though they deported him. Our immigration system is a joke. Too many crooked government officials. Covering up perjury. An investigation into my fathers case needs to be open. It’s so unfair to rip families apart.
@realDonaldTrump ICE took my father and had him deported within 12 days; never got to see a judge. Hearing scheduled August 8th. My father worked in the US for 44 years paying taxes. He’s not a felon. He has work authorization until Dec. 8th. ICE needs a check and balance system.

@SenSanders if my father is deported, he will be barred from entering the US for 10 years. It is wrong! Please help us find justice. My children fear they will never see there Poppa again.
@SenSanders My father has been in the USA for 43 years, legally worked/paid taxes. He’s 68 &amp; collects social security. Documented proof government official committed perjury causing removal order. He was detained Friday for deportation. Please help!
