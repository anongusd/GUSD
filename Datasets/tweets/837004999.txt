@Michael93870436 @AaronButchas @Captain_Ned @AndrewPollackFL All the time, ppl will go in to the jails and give each of them that arent a convicted felon a chance to register, if not already, and the chance to vote..he did not vote.		I think omce again this is being thrown around as a D vs R thing an honestly i dont think thats the case
@Michael93870436 @AaronButchas @Captain_Ned @AndrewPollackFL Okay, my misunderstanding then, i thought you where saying along the lines of it wasnt "right"    well IF in fact it was a Democrat that went in to the jail to register him for 1-we have no proof it was a D, at least i have not seem it. 2-he registered as a R. 3-this happens 1/2
@Michael93870436 @AaronButchas @Captain_Ned @AndrewPollackFL Be able to register, exactly which constitutional right of your would you like to give up or be taken away, only because something think you dont deserve that right
@Michael93870436 @AaronButchas @Captain_Ned @AndrewPollackFL Not going to argue that point..we we just stating tjat it was perfectly legal for him to register to vote, and vote if he wanted to (which he did not end up doing) you nor I nor any victims family can take the constitutional right away from him... and if you think he shouldnt 1/2

@idontevenknower @low_tex @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael His party affiliation is irrelevant.. i dont. are if a Democrat took him the forms or a Republican took him the forms while he was in jail... THEY DID NOTHING WRONG

@lWillRedPillYou @RhymesWithRight @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael @FBI Not sure if im understanding you correctly but if i am... it does not matter who new or who he admits to doing.. he has to be convicted by the court of law in order for any rights to be taken away, at this point in time the courts entered a plea of NOT GUILTY

@4ReUnitedStates @Krsaint @QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael It is heartbreaking what vtuz has done, i do not support him or condone this type of behavior.. we were simply try to figure out what the LAW was in fl about voteing IF you were a CONVICTED FELON and also trying to figure out if he had been convicted yet..ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@4ReUnitedStates @Krsaint @QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I mean not to be cold hearted but it really doesnt matter, i dont think it is right either however, thoes or OUR rights as a US citizen, you probably should thank God that each of us have any rights at all left! The law of the land cannot be carried out be feelings! Plain 1/2
@jrank0012 @Krsaint @dog_pdx @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Who exactly are you referring to as a hypocrite?
RT @GeoffThorne: @realDonaldTrump too late. you already gave your real reaction.
@Krsaint @4ReUnitedStates @QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I looked at your profile but could not tell, and you only have 4 followers, but my question is do you hold a position as to where you can assist andrew if he takes it to the state legislature? Or do you mean as a normal civilian you can help (honest question)
@APiercea45 @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Felt the same way as what? He shouldnt be aloud to vote?? Which is what this conversation was about i thought

@QUnitedWeStand @4ReUnitedStates @Krsaint @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael üëè
@QUnitedWeStand @4ReUnitedStates @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I dont think anywhere in any of this mess of a tweet thread has ANYONE eluded to the fact that they "supported" cruz.. this is what makes me so frustrated
@4ReUnitedStates @Krsaint @QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael He IS NOT A FELON... this the above tweet serves no purpose.. idk, maybe you have not read all the tweets on the thread, but that is what we have been trying to figure out...not one single person on he has said anything close to "they support, defend ect. This person"
@QUnitedWeStand @EmilyPetro22 @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Yeah i  am super glad i asked for some sotes u got your info from
@EmilyPetro22 @QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Be informed all of a sudden once you saw him and i talking about sites and i guess "conspiracy theories" if you would even call it that.. sorry to judge, but just odd to me and thought I would ask 2/2
@EmilyPetro22 @QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I noticed you dont have many followers and you do not follow hardley anyone..no profile picture.. idk just all thinhs that i look for when discussing deep government debates with... and when some see what i mentioned they will call, bot and block..just seemed odd u wanted to 1/2

@QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Now wait i do think i remember something about the brother and him dieing...can i can, where did you find out or get or whatever this information of this theory
@TheRealTomKeen @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Well said!
@QUnitedWeStand @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Oh wow! I did not realize that there were possible ties to way bigger things.. this is crazy
@Krsaint @allwaysfunky @BriereBear @WAlberts3 @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Oooh okay.. i guess i should end myself on some of the fl laws.. i have a hard enough time keeping up with the Illinois and surrounding states laws lol
@JeffreysGroup @Goodegirl73 @Krsaint @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael But someone just said fl passed law nov 6 convicted felons can vote now.. so really this conversation is solved
@JeffreysGroup @Goodegirl73 @Krsaint @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael So i took that as he did not plead anything.. so i guess my question is where did he admit guilt? (Honest question)
RT @allwaysfunky: @BriereBear @adparker0426 @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael FL just passed (nov. 6) law a‚Ä¶
@allwaysfunky @BriereBear @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Okay well even though i agreed he had nt been convicted and could vote you piece of info just blows this whole thread apart.. there should be me reason to debate it any longer.. he can vote weather he has been convicted or not! Thank you for this
@MartiniShark Matically entered as not guilty 2/2
@MartiniShark Okay now the way you worded your last tweet would not frustrate me.. I completely understand what you are saying.. however im not sure you are correct on the claiming insanity or him admitting to killing 17... i have learned that he did not enter any plea therefore it is auto 1/2
@Goodegirl73 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Correct, everyone must be done the same and it must be, law and rights over feelings
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Thank you! I absolutely love it!!
@My_dawg_is_Game @stefhen @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Okay it was brought up respectfully on this tweet but another thread..you are welcome to join in over there, but im not going to repeat myself on the same tweet
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I do fully agree with you! And i am completely against tampering with any election at all... i have actually sat as an election judge (in a different state) for years now, i take that position extremely serious and can not stand to think things like #BrowardCounty are going on
@stefhen @BrokenSince93 @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael K thats what i thought but just checking
@My_dawg_is_Game @stefhen @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael No one said anything about that topic, and is pretty irrelevant in this thread
@2shotOlympia @orkoftw @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael That is a very good point
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael The country has to be run by laws and right instead of each individuals feelings... qe just simply can not base things on feelings.. and i know that is so hard 2/2
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Okay i can agree with you on that one, yes the law mite need a little work done.. because im with most of you, i think this is so incredibly sad, heartbreaking and really just "not right" for a lack of better words.. i wish it wasnt like that.. but i am a firm believer that 1/2
@orkoftw @2shotOlympia @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Very true, i questioned that to myself at first, but then got caught up in this back and forth
@TimothyJPadilla @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Thank you! You said it perfectly and i guess better than i could because i could not get these ppl to understand qhere i was coming from
@stefhen @BrokenSince93 @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Who are you referring to
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I mean im not sure how you were coming across in this tweet.. but i mean i guess my answer would be yes like him... to my knowledge he was never proven to do any of the allegations that would made
@orkoftw @2shotOlympia @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Okay i see the clear picture now.. that is where i was getting confused.. they just entered not guilty
@BrokenSince93 @WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Yeah i definitely am nt defending him at all, however laws are laws, rights are rights and they must be played the same for every citizen
@MartiniShark Difference of opinion i guess man.. no hard feelings, but i was also beging to become frustrated while reading your tweets..however i no this is a very heartbreaking touchy subj, so i chose nt to argue
@busytimes6 @muchmoresalt @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I dont think he was "proven guilty" was he?
@WAlberts3 @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Oh more than likely not, however https://t.co/MckPC0xX8I not how things work here..
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I am again thankful that in order for me or you or joe blow down the road to be convicted of a crime, credible evidence must be provided..i sure would not want to be convicted of a crime the someone just "claimed" i had done with zero bit of evidence... 2/2
@leavinAtrail @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I mean yes i understand your point, i truly do.. do i think he did the crime, yes i do, therefore do i think he just get to vote, no i do not!! However i am extremely thankful my rights as a US citizen are not soley based on what the general population "thinks" furthermore 1/2
@muchmoresalt @Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael You are correct
@GamecockLt @MartiniShark @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Okay maybe that is what i was thinking of, his brother taking a plea... well then i stand corrected and really have no viable reason to be mad, bevause that is intact his right, mine right, and your right if we were in jail... weather we agree or nt that is our cons. Right
@MartiniShark @GamecockLt @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Well in his defense you were kinda talking in circles...
@Krsaint @JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Okay, i was mistaken, i thought he had already been convicted.	 If in fact he has not then, i understand his right as a US citizen to be able to vote
RT @JackPosobiec: Semper Fi! 		Happy birthday to the US Marine Corps!
@krassenstein Maybe he was afraid he would run in to @Acosta lol
@JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Agree, that is completely irrelevant to the main point
@GamecockLt @MartiniShark @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Means vote away, i mean that is a right! 2/2
@GamecockLt @MartiniShark @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Im with you @GamecockLt gamecocklti dont think he fully understands, its either that or he enjoys talking in circles.... my only question is this was.. i thought he had been convicted when he took the plea... or am i wrong and there was no plea? If he is not convicted by all 1/2
@ljreader @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael But i thought you stated above "he isnt convicted yet" so then if that is the case why wouldnt he get to vote... im just confused buy your differences in tweets
@ljreader @RattyMouseman @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael Honest question, but how is he not? I thought he took a plea, i may be wrong
@JeffreysGroup @AndrewPollackFL @ScottJIsrael I would also like to find out how this was done...

6 Sides of the aisle. I dont understand why ppl from both side dont have an issue with his "social behavior" i wish someone could explain that to me
5 Act like that or treat ppl like that, make fun of ppl like that" ect. I am just appalled at his actions.		And btw my feelings about this have NOTHING do it with what party anyone is, him/myself whoever. i could care less at this point. This is not about a party line &amp; opposite

3 This is okay, how can they possibly respect him for the position he holds, how just jow is this type of action okay from the PRESIDENT for crying out loud.. granted everyone can be act a tad childish at time, yes he is still a human i get that	 However he is held to a higher
2 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!! This was at one time an incredibly highly respected position! Why would he think he decided such respect (ie media reporters) when he acts, talks, and tweets such childish things, about a senator nonetheless! How can anyone from any party think
1 "Jeff Flake(y)" i had to check and recheck to make sure this actually was @realDonaldTrump &amp; not some pretend account! Are you serious right now, how old are you?

@jefoson7 @GozoTweets @GOP @TheDemocrats I am excitedly waiting patiently for @GozoTweets response to the above 2012 article concerning @BarackObama
@GozoTweets @jefoson7 @GOP @TheDemocrats @BarackObama 2/2 agree the the party "across the aisle" but i do not necessarily agree for the way they are go about things to get such thing accomplished.. make sense?
@GozoTweets @jefoson7 @GOP @TheDemocrats @BarackObama 1/2 I think you hit the nail! That is what i see alot of (process vs legislation) you can be debating "the process" of an action or event, you pretty soon the opposing side has turned it in to debating "the legislation" part... there are things, policies ect that i do agree
4 Pleading with each person or coutry i had contact with along the way to please help me and my children).... as for Trump and the "children n the cages" that is a different deeper issue that i would have to explain my thoughts and feeling on, im out of characters lol
3 Heck would NOT be, 1- flying that country's flag while i was fleeing, nor would i even have thought it was an important item to flee to safety with. 2- i would not be throwing rocks, shouting, yelling as well as other heinous acts while running for help (i would be begging &amp;

@rhealyrhealy @MizFitKiKi @Mavtha3rd @fanniesdream That is so upsetting to me to see an unopposed Republican

@kmh1268 @LeslieMarshall Where did you hear he was a Democrat? Im just curious, last i heard was he was a registered Republican in the state of Florida. Honest question, i may have missed something

@GozoTweets @720CreditNow @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Okay i understand now..lol.. 		I would say you are correct on your assumption..
@GozoTweets @720CreditNow @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Now i am really lost lol
@GozoTweets @720CreditNow @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Im lost, did i miss some..
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP We have lost sight in many things, today i have became just as disappointed in the R party as i was/am the D party..i am now fairly certain on my "struggles" of last week!

@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 2) stand on abortion, you would probably face palm yourself
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 1)This is where my original (forgot) problem was. Should i care more about one's soical morality (qhich i am struggling with) or should i care more about the Dodgers of taxes ect.. at one time i firmly new what meant more but as a whole is where i because wishy! If i told u my
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @Cher_n_NJ @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I just had a family member say to me.. "Im not ruling out a crazy Democrat" which i think is basically what you ment by instability
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @Cher_n_NJ @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats It just sickens me that it qould be happening at all
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @Cher_n_NJ @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Honestly im not sure.. i could certainly list reasons for ppl on both sides.. i may have a more soild informed answer as more things come to light, idk. if 1 was to stay close minded to their party only u could easily blame and beleive it was the other party-if that makes sense
@GozoTweets BUt point taken, i stated i wasnt giving the slamming a response
@GozoTweets I think you are correct, i think the fight at this time for us will be getting others to do the same
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Correction.. old enough
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats You are correct
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2) back that far.
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1) Ahh okay, i missed the in general.. i think myself and maybe @eroctyl went to current times.. we are both not quite other enough to go back quite that far, in terms of experience and living in thoes times..im quite away of things u just mentioned just initially did not think
@GozoTweets @Cher_n_NJ @3kids4gkids @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats After the events today i am deeply concerned that the majority of ppl from BOTH sides are willing to step back and try to improve america.. i just tweeted about this..
@GozoTweets @GOP üôåüëè
To a point of being livid! And so mad at all sides.. someone or something better happen to make everyone get a grip quickly before Americans start saying there is no hope!!! If you intend to start slamming me on this tweet please no you are not getting a respon.
Tweets blaming one party or the other or  blaming trump himself..probably being if we are at this point it has gone way way to far.. this is crazy, i am a calm, loving, carring, open minded person who doesnt anger easley (unless u mess with my kids) but the events today angers me
Dont care which side..it makes me angry, my kids are living in this, it scares me of what things will be for them as young adults.. this is nuts absolute nuts.. i probably need to just stay off Twitter for the remaining part of the day because i have already seen enough of the
1) ATTENTION My piddly 2 cents for the day-  I think both parties and there following  have flipped a switch a lost their ever loven minds! I think someone or something better happen to get back to some basic before a full blown civil war happens. Todays events are appalling i
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 3) Im not going to debate a whole terribly bunch on this or even claim and speak my thoughts.. just curious as to my original question
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2) to even think about.. i have done my part and attempt to educate myself on the deep parts of this event but honest all can say is wow this is a tangled web going back a long way.. so i have not dug as deep in to the M. Invest as much as other or as much as i should be. There4
@GozoTweets @eroctyl @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1) Im not sure if this is a yes or no question but if it can possibly be, no explanation need to this question. Are you referring to those such as : Flynn and Manafort ect charges surrounding the Mueller Investigation.. Im not gonna lie that who mess of a thing makes ny head hurt
@JohnDays6 @WendellSherk @glennbeck I try so hard.. as u can see if u look at my replies to be a kind person, but some times i have to call it like a see it.. probably beeing we are all human here no matter which side and some how that factor has been lost
@JohnDays6 @glennbeck I am stating to see there are very very few at least on the D side that are willing to listen and think outside their box.. i am just blessed i can be one to try and be that way
@psilgod Glad you agree üòâ

@TimKline9 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 1 Hmm i often have a hard time deciding if ones tweet is sincere, some are so good at throwing in a snide comment just because, welcome to non verbal internet communication.. bt i am going to nt over think this one and only hope this is nt one of those snide remarks. so now i can
@GozoTweets @TimKline9 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Its great, wish this could hapoen more. What pleases ne more is u &amp; I more than likely will disagree on political view more than we will agree but looky here we can be adults and accomplish so much more than if we bashed ea other with hate because of veiws
@GozoTweets @GSantagiovani @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats At the beginning of our talks i would never would have thought we could have a civil conversation, besides back and forth around in circles.. i must a caught u at the end of a day where u had already been in debates that made ya wanna beat ya head against the wall lol

And you are respectfully helping all over now üòâ
@GozoTweets @GSantagiovani @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I do believe i have to say you only one time said something about "my mix of words" in the middle of some rough tweets.. and im pretty sure u can find something in every single tweet of mine..
@GozoTweets @geterdoneb421 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats ( @geterdoneb421 )
@GozoTweets @geterdoneb421 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Wow, i seem like i have seen this tweet somewhere, actually i feel like someone once told about the same to me lol i look forward to his response (gozo) qill it be different than mine the same, hmmm
@GozoTweets @doe_spike @greenlightgg @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I think maybe you could be on to something lol
@GSantagiovani @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2 and i said to my self, wow wait a min, this is not okay with me and i was shocked to see the D backing it because i thought it was the total opposite.. which lead me on my mission to educate my self the best i can
@GSantagiovani @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1 I believe you just said it all.. they, do not fully understand what they are supporting..qhich leads us back to me, a 36 year old qho is a registered Democrat and have always voted Democrat, and then one day some time ago i was reading about a view/stance the Dem were supportin
@geterdoneb421 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I definitely do not disagree with you, and those are a few of the topics i have been really uneasy about
@EmilyEggbert @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Exactly my point!
@EmilyEggbert @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 2 been acting a little "uncivil" as well... do you truly think the R are the only part being uncivil
@EmilyEggbert @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 1 Smh! I am fully a wear of the R party and them being "uncivil" i think i said that above.. but i would think if said person is going 2 start listing things about the R party that make them "uncivil" that said person should also be about to stand and say yes the D may have also
@eroctyl Should they?
@TimKline9 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Respected
@EmilyEggbert @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 2 been the most civil either. But i would very much have to say, only speaking about our party, that the democratic party as a whole has been very uncivil at times recently
@EmilyEggbert @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 1 But havent we as a party been a tad "uncivil" the last few weeks? Weather the majority of the party thinks it was warranted is beside the fact, there were reasonings yes but as a registered democratic i have seen a lot i would consider "uncivil"  and i am nt saying the R have
@GozoTweets @TimKline9 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Look at you go! üòâ just given ya hell! But im a little jealous, u have interacted, explained &amp; answered so much more than u did with me from the start, thats ok though i see how it is i had to push &amp; fight my way n to get an answer *funny funny*
@GozoTweets @doe_spike @greenlightgg @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2 be as great as this, it most definitely would not be a waste to go back through qhat i missed haha
@GozoTweets @doe_spike @greenlightgg @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1 I cant tell solely by just these 2 tweets, if u r agreeing or disagreeing with momof4. But nevertheless doesnt matter, however this tweet of yours is about the funniest thing i have read on Twitter today. I literally was LOL.. if i new all of the tweets i missed today would
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @brookemorter19 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 3 continued to tell me that i was a liar, because i was not a registered Democrat, and i was lying about being a democratic election judge, and then i was nothing but a fake account.. i mean sad sad sad
@doe_spike @GozoTweets @greenlightgg @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I was appalled at how my own party was in most ways doing nothing productive to "help" out a party member that is stating she doesn't think she can stand behind and support them any longer.. all but a few, just flat out said if u cant vote straight Dem then leave our party.. one
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @brookemorter19 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2 on the issue we discuss but they may be times i do..
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @brookemorter19 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1 Yep, i have learned this "strategy" i read &amp; read &amp; read.. but i also want to actually engage in that discussion with someone with different views as myself.. they might possibly educate me about something i thought not known or i had not considered.. i may nt change my views
@BobbyKeel4 @glennbeck First time i have heard it put this way, and in fact it may very well be the truth
@GozoTweets @AFrizzBey @mattpetersons @pacelattin @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I didnt not both to go through and see how i got involved, or who was concerned about where i went or what ever the case may be.. but to whom ever, i was tking care of my three children before school, one of which is extremely sick so i had to prioritize for a bit sorry guys

@EmilyEggbert @GozoTweets @MsTonieaton @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GozoTweets  here i go.. i have just read these 5 tweet of trumps.. i dont see anything wrong with it, other than the fact i think it is crazy the US president is blowing up social media worse than a high school girl.what is wrong w these 5 tweets, sure he is rooting on his party
@GozoTweets @MsTonieaton @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I honestly do nt need 2 ask the question. i deeply no the answer! But i also no the answer 2 some of the D issues that have happen over the course of the last say 4 mo.. sooo back to square one, i dont even know what is right &amp; what is wrong some days or if ne of them r right
@GozoTweets @EmilyEggbert @daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Okay.. did he say "ppl from that state are..." or "ppl who are Democrats are..." do i dare ask you a question lol what group or whatever was he referring to qhile stating that... cause that is wrong, no to agree with that and it serves no purpose and does zero good
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 2 there is a possibility that not every single cop is a "good cop" um cause last i check that aint what i was taught in school about the police.. no excuse for me, but do that give u a little deeper insight on my crazy continuity going mind lol
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP 1 I am learning to respect that way, in my defense, which is no excuse. I am just now seeing some of what i would consider "corrupt" things that you older ppl have lived and seen first hand..this right here is the hardest part for me, it has taken me yrs to even beleive, just say
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Credit for that one haha
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Wholeheartedly agree.. not that my opinion matters to you lol but i am content we have pushed through the crap and joke around.. but if i hadnt of continued to send tweet and tweet try to reach something, hell anything we probably would have never spoke good bad again ill take
@GozoTweets @MaxMc612 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And i have three children to attempt to get up and get on a bus they dont want ro be on going to a school a couple of them could care less about.. do i got ya beat yet haha

@GozoTweets @MaxMc612 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Well i dont feel real sorry for ya.. as i sit in good ole southern Illinois, at 620am STILL discussing politics with you, it is approx 34¬∞ outside, to that of which came directly after a 100 humid week 2 weeks ago, im still looking for fall and possibly spring..
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 4) and who knows someone may be able to make me see or think deeper or different than where i am right now.
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 3) which i can feel better at standing behind and supporting.. im sure that is nt the answer u wanted but if u look back i gave u the same very honest answer i hve stated time and time again. I am more than willing to listen to anyone either side on one particular View at a time
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2) however there have been a handful of in my eyes major things for the Democrats that even shake my core democratic beliefs. I dont no the answer, so the o ly thing i can do is continue to correctly educate myself and when it comes that time take everything and decide which of
@3kids4gkids @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1) Can i stand behind that, im not sure at this point hence this whole conversation, my core values are democratic,  but do i agree with all the do, nope.. do i agree with some of the things the R are doing, yes i do. Everything, no absolutely nt.. that is pretty common i feel..
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP I agree, and on occasion i try to number, but you should see how fast my fingers and hands were moving replying to you and my brain was moving even faster lol no excuse
@GozoTweets @tallnblonde1 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP But to answer the ?  Yes amongst all these ungodly tweets of a mess there have been R state that you were nt very nice lol
@GozoTweets @tallnblonde1 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Mean? No.. im not afraid to get my sweet feelings hurt lol a little snide and at one point very um, well i dont no the word, but mean.. no your good.. my main hang up was how can someone who "sided" with me in the party be anyway but helpful to the other member &amp; party
@GozoTweets @JeffMelody2 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Like me, but in reality um its probably hard as crap for anyone the least bit old than me or my generation.. how about that lol
@GozoTweets @JeffMelody2 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats SOME things seem so simple 2 me yet it becomes something huge &amp; im nt sure it has to.. i will admit and thunk i have.. i am young, i went through many years of "being TAUGHT in a university" and yes can be ext naive at times.. honestly wait it would seem easy to talk to those
@GozoTweets @geterdoneb421 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats No its prob not your resp. But in my perfect world haha i would hope one would feel strongly enough bout party &amp;  truly believe in the good of party that u would nt want 2 c ppl (walkaway). I mean at least attempt 2 have a discussion when u c u mite could give some useful insite
@GozoTweets However with me you arent, i listen and take it in and then decide if my views changed
@GozoTweets I see you point, i guess i just see it as "well i would do my best to answer a question, what would it hurt them" or "if you have a soild foundation to support your answer y nt share it"  i say, y nt answer &amp; share it it wont hurt. Bt n reality n tweet land u may b wastn breathe
I must start fresh today by keeping a running tally of my "left-wing" feed activity &amp; "right-wing" feed activity, i hve 2 b carefl &amp; nt let 1 out way the other, bc obviously n Twitter land one must never agree with or "side" w which ever "wing" comes n bhind on the running tally https://t.co/VkQsju2k55
@ChiefDanLight @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I am fairly convinced in how true your statement is
@mattpetersons @pacelattin @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I figured it was silly autocorrect, but just when you think you know something, BAM here in Twitter land, as i call it, you honestly have no clue lol give me a few but i will be responding to your question
@mattpetersons @pacelattin @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Are you wanting an honest answer was to why i am "done" with the democratic party?
@mattpetersons @pacelattin @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I hate assuming, nevertheless im going to assume you are a part of my current political party! 		Will gladly accept if my assumptions are wrong
@mattpetersons @pacelattin @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats What are you asking "them" to tell me? Im sorry i cant quite decipher what your "?" Is
@doctriggerswife @WendellSherk @glennbeck Myself or Wendell?

@NBredl @glennbeck *funny reply- as I was reading you tweet, i just keep hearing "for the love of God stop tweeting and walk away Amber just stop, take a spin and walk the heck away.. all being said in a deep comedian voice
@Michael10plus10 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats How to weigh out the bad and decide out of both bad options or both bad views and parts which one can you live with supporting
@Michael10plus10 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats The alternative of Trump  being? Oh i definitely thinks we could have and be worse off, i think and view both parties have major faults what I'm saying is some of the faults the Democrats are having right now or false that I cannot stand behind right or wrong at some point you
@SGearheard @glennbeck With the R party either.. but at this point that party is  becoming the "right way" the easy way! I guess i should say what im struggling with is my core democratic values.. right or wrong it is hard for me
@SGearheard @glennbeck One would think it should be easy! To be "fair" i do still stand with and behind things that the D party stands for, but some of the more recent situations and events i can not no questions with good faith stand behind and support it.. &amp; we all no the flip side i dont fully agree
@Aliciastarr001 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Thank you for these words!

@PatriotMadd @glennbeck @WendellSherk Democratic state of ILLINOIS, i could even give you give you a location to the local courthouse and im sure somehow in your non fake/trolling ways u could see my voter registration card, or talk 2 the gov/stofficial that writes my check after i sit as YOUR party election judge
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck @WendellSherk Okay, that is fine.. you are entitled to your thoughts in our free country, actions like you just did hurt only u and the party u stand for &amp; for that im sorry. I mean if wanted to stoop 2 your level i could let you know what county i reside in this oh so beautiful majority democ
@eroctyl I mean its simple i guess.. i dont get what they are continuing to go on and on about.. it serves zero purpose in my eyes, what is it doing to benefit Americans/America as a whole.. acting like this is doing nothing productive 2 even slightly make things better ahhhh geez
@eroctyl @OldTehanu @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Could explain to me why and what the facts were for continuing to beleive and view this issues as D do.. so basically what did my party do for me today, show more some more true colors
@eroctyl @OldTehanu @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats The R views on this matter and i thought hey i will see, since it was being discussed already, what their views are to help me decide if my once strong D views were truly how i still felt or if it was just time.. it was horrible, and after about 6 hours no one for the D party
@eroctyl @OldTehanu @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Yes, and i made it extremely clear my affiliation.. i asked a democratic one simple question, and it was an actual honest question, aomething that i wanted anothers insight on, oh my gosh u qould have that i was literally throwing rocks at person..i had been leaning more toward
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 @TPUSA @usminority And that speaks volumes to me
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 @TPUSA @usminority Definitely would attempt 2 answer the question as best as could, not dodge the question or immediately start making excuses or start attacking me.. i dont know you other than this talk but im willing to bet im correct about that assessment of you and for the most part, your party
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 @TPUSA @usminority As well.. and even thought i am at this point in my "D, R party life" that doesnt mean i am always going to agree with you, and thats fine but i can almost bet if i asked u or ne other true R a honest question about some veiws i felt like i need some others input on, you most
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 @TPUSA @usminority I appreciate that greatly.. i mess up all the time but i do pit forth effort and try to be right and do right by everyone.. yes i would have to agree being a R your whole life you will probably be pretty biased towards that party, and that is wonderful i hope you are, i once was

@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats At that point i had to take another step back...
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And saying what they were about who they were... told them i was not going to listen to it until one of them could show me some credible facts and information.. well approximately 12 days later they can to me with a stack of information and facts to back up what they were saying
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Okay then, i wasnt gonna name any names tonight haha but after i got done typing i then saw where you had added to your tweets and pretty much stated what i was referring to.. i honestly did not beleive it at first, i honestly told some of my family that they were nuts thinking
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Extremely shocking and absolutely appalling things and ppl involved in this whole sex trafficking issue.. i just cant beleive it, and this is one of the few things i cant not what so ever in good faith support at the end of the day
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I will most definitely be visiting that site.. you deserve some credit and a huge thank you for any and all ppl! What a wonderful thing you are giving a fellow human.. i cant not say thank you enough.. and we dont have the time to get in to this BUT i have been discovering some
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck At this point they are becoming really hatd to come across
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck Much.. i did have one person from the dem party eventually start to discuss things respectfully and correctly for the party, but it took us ALL DAY 2 get 2 that point, nevertheless we did, therefore i no there are still great Democrats supporting their party but at rhis point
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck To "keep" me, not one single one was able or has had a constructive discussion to bring me back or keep me.. all i have seen out of my own party is hate, and snid remarks along with some opinions and non credible "facts" and lots of round and round but saying nothing that means
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck I am working extremely hard to see it all ways.. the party i was once so proud of is slowly becoming a party i am not okay with, a party i am still registered with a party i am representing at the election as a judge.. and so far i have had zero ppl from my own fliping party try
@B60196717 @WendellSherk @glennbeck I dont think they fully grasp what they are doing, most of the party is helping push them on out not trying to keep them geez
@OmegaVox @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats For many years.. they were sure not sitting here saying things to keep me in the party and standing by their fellow party members MOST of them only made things more clear for me..
@OmegaVox @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And im not so sure about "Democrats protecting their own" you should go and look and the way MY OWN PARTY is acting towards a once extremely strong member, and who is still currently a registered republican and has sat on their side on the election board and election judge for
@pacelattin @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Debating walking away from the dems, is not doing your/mine party any justice, your actions are only makeing those who are questioning switching sides easier on them to switch..
@pacelattin @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I mean your thoughts and assumptions in reality mean zero to me, and i honestly could care less to prove myself, however i could very easily show you what my affiliation is with my current party.. i can also state acting like you did in this reply only makes those ppl who are
@greenlightgg @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I honestly wondered how long it would talk for this statement to come out somewhere in all these threads today.. i will be anxious to see where is goes
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Its like they refuse to listen to anything other than their veiws and ways
@GroverMonster1 @tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And what is sad i have listed many of these accomplishments that you have provided, and it never fails they have something negative to add.. im baffled, this is currently "my own party" that is arguing like this..
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck And think about some of the actions and things being done and said.. now on the flip i most definitely do nt all of a sudden support every single thing our prest says and does, because i dont.. but there comes a point one must weigh out the good in both and the bad n both
@PatriotMadd @glennbeck Honestly not trying to argue but there have been some major things done and said by "my party" that i cant in good faith support.. not saying i woke up and all of a sudden dont agree at all with the dems.. but wow come on the most sane hard core straight ticket dem has to stop
@eroctyl @OldTehanu @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I start each day saying that i will continue to have civil discussions in hopes there will b something myself or others say to make ppl think and look at the big picture.. by the end of the "twitter day" i am so wore out for fighting with MY OWN PARTY ahhhhhh
@OldTehanu @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Where did i refer to myself as a "man" please show me. I dont no about you but i most definitely know my gender therefore if you are correct and i did indeed refer to myself as a man it was clearly a typo
@DebFlanigan @glennbeck Thank you greatly i have enjoyed read and taking in what you had to offer.. i now have to make a small funny, you said "there is some much LEFT to do" lol i no u probably didnt mean it like that but i laughed and laughed
@DebFlanigan @ReedKama @glennbeck Thank you
@daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Democratic election judge 2) i tend to lose my calm, loving, non confrontational, we can all agree to disagree self when someone starts in on the "asylum/refugees" that issue grids my gears bad
@daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP They are a few things i could dispute, especially the things you listed that a basically opinions, im not going to dispute with you at the moment how i feel and am seeing things differently, but i am going to say 2 things 1) being i am a registered Democrat sitting as a
@EmilyEggbert @daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP And i respect that, you may have possibly miss, i am a registered Democrat, thought that may intrest you to know
@EmilyEggbert @daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Possibly, yes.. but as a whole, we could most definitely have it worse than we do at this moment
@Craig97456673 @DebFlanigan @glennbeck Honest question. Why to you say this, based off of her reply
@AgingGrace10 @glennbeck Totally understand know.. i misunderstood, my bad üòâ
@DebFlanigan @JasonDisalvo44 @glennbeck I have heard that good ole Abe would probably be considered a Republican.. i haven't read the platform, i dont believe.. i may have to find some time to do that
@sandlady73 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I kinda enjoy the middle to, why cant we just stay there and live in a perfect world lol
@sandlady73 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats That's what I keep trying to relate to these people I've said it a million times I am a registered Democrat I sit as democratic judge I am / was on your side why are you fighting with me.. ahhh i feel like i should currently beat my head on the wall, because of my own party
@dan40221 @glennbeck Hey by the way, could i borrow or could you loan me about 50 bucks hahahah.. 		I just went to your page to follow you back!
@dan40221 @glennbeck Oh not at all! I have enjoyed your words of wisdom, and look forward to seeing/hearing more!
@dan40221 @glennbeck The thinking for themselves is pretty much gone we are far and few between in this generation and in the generation below me which I consider the all talked about millennials
@dan40221 @glennbeck Generation below me and if something doesn't change I fear for all the coming Generations cute even people my age don't even think remotely how I'm trying to think about things what one better I'm not but I think my generation the political thinking the open-mindedness and
@dan40221 @glennbeck Kids are young a matter of fact my youngest is 10 and my oldest is 14 they have some rough years ahead of them there is already things they are having to go through and Witness what is mind-blowing to me I am scared for my generation and I am most definitely scared for the
@dan40221 @glennbeck I will gladly do that favor for you and more than willing and have a sense of pride that I am able to do so actually call Pat. I just twisted somewhere else that it actually kills my soul to have to think about the world my children will be living in when I am gone I'm young my
@Kimjord40496251 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Not sure anyone or everyone is telling the American ppl or "leaking" out to the American ppl .. i feel like to make assumptions that like i need some facts, no matter the party.. does that make sense
@Kimjord40496251 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Honest question.. do you truly believe and feel you know all the information for all parties involved that make a statement saying "he" new the fake Russians that he knows qont come over here to answer questions? Because i feel like i could not that assumption, o ly because im
@MslillieMaga @glennbeck I can say i am being educated in ways that need, i feel i am doing my part to see thi gs from an open mind and a clear head.. i cant promise anyone anything but i can tell you i am doing my best to become correctly informed about both sides and views
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats "Reprogram" some things for me... oh lordy i used the word Reprogram- im sure i opened the flood gates haha
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats The Turks and dead ppl.. i wont go there on my opinion for that.. that issues/event whatever makes me extremely mad/upset...the corrupt voting, yeah cant say i ever remember hearing talk about that... i definitely see it all laid out in black and white, just gonna take me a bit
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Hear what he would have to say about the last 4 mo ths..yikes!!
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And this is one issue i am having a really hard time with, no i dont remember my dad or grandpa doing that either! Well actually im sure the gpa that help raise me is rolling over in his grave over that issue, which retired after 20+ years in the Air Force.. yeah i would love to
@daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP And to add, i cant recall which main topic thread this is.. but have you seen what party i am affiliated with? And how i am affiliated with them?
@daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Now i have an honest question for you? Have you honestly taken the time to look past his all mighty trump way and researched what he has accomplished? Im not saying i agree with all he does n says but somehow the 2 parties r going 2 have 2 come together &amp; help this country
@daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Oh i strongly and most definitely think there could be way worse than good ole Mr Donald Trump.. that is without a doubt.. do i think only the Democrats can give us some worse, no but i do think it could definitely be so much worse!
@dan40221 @glennbeck I was infact wrong, incorrect, misinformed or uneducated about the issues" "wow, maybe i need to reevaluate my views and feels on said topic"
@dan40221 @glennbeck Agreed, heck i dont a lot of his social affairs with his use of Twitter and the way he speaks to and about ppl however i respect him and like you said there comes a point when you must look at the black and white facts.. i have caught myself saying in my head, " um i think maybe
@Surfbone1 @glennbeck Be getting baptized very shortly.. so i am definitely on the same page as you as far as that goes
@Surfbone1 @glennbeck Not to open a can or qorms for other to jump in on but there is truth to your words, i was born and rasied in church and every time those doors were open, im gar far from perfect however i deeply no prayer and God can change anything.. my youngest save was recently saved and qill
@Surfbone1 @glennbeck I honestly deeply feeling so crushingly sorry for my generation and all the ones to follow.
@redhead_true @HanluxThe @glennbeck Agreed, for the majority üòâ i cant stress enough to myself and everyone and its the only reasonable suggestion I have is to educate educate educate in a respectful way especially to my generation and the younger Generations
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And Grandpa's Generations they did not have it in their face all the time they did not hear about it but I do strongly believe a lot of it was there
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats However I do strongly believe that a lot of the quote-unquote evil that is happening amongst everybody has always been there but we have it in our face 24/7 we have smartphones we have media we have access to it all the time so we see it day in and day out now as to my dad's
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I am going to have to quiz my dad on what he sees, feels or thinks has changed within the party.. it will be interesting to see.. just based on how i was raised, im going to have to say i agree with you
@Surfbone1 @glennbeck With the day i have had on here, im nt sure which way i should take your reply lol im not sure if i am missing the sarcastic tone or not.. but ill give it a guess and say, "thank you, keep those who feel like me in your thoughts"
@GozoTweets @MaxMc612 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Hahahahah thanks for the ending laughing of the "Twitter day"
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP SCREENSHOT THIS or KEEP RECORD of my next words.. 		I completely 100% AGREE with you üòâ seriously though i do
@GozoTweets @OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Heck no, i dont know what im doing, not at all!! Im as cluless and the rest of the world, but i cant just sit and not at least attempt to make a tiny difference.. and i dont mean make a difference as n swaying someone to my side
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP That make you, yourself, dig deep and see what side of that situation you stand on.. make sense?
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP And to answer, only for myself, yes i have been involved in discussions where i was like "wait a minute, i need to look in to that deeper" or i thought "hey they may actually be right, what was i thinking" did it change my party, no &amp; and im nt asking 4 that..but words exchanged
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Agree, i try super hard not to, only 2 explain them if challenged but always ask for theirs. I honestly would like to hope there r still some out in twitter land that could use the correct words to help (key word) a persom THINK about things deeper. I no im asking a ton lol
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Interesting to say the least. &amp; look we made it almost full circle lol honestly look forward to seeing more of your views!
@dan40221 @glennbeck I may be young but i can honestly tell you, i am hanging on to every bit of info i can get that is creditable and working hard to make the best choices for my kids my family myself and ALL of those in OUR great country! I promise u that much
@GozoTweets @tallnblonde1 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP My time arguing with some young kid that aint gonna listen or aint go change anyhow" i get it.. i just feel we should always start out trying. Now im going to sound my age, i didnt even start out being mean to you or nething, why be mean back lol &lt;c that age coming out lol
@GozoTweets @tallnblonde1 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP It has been trying.. i am extremely passionate about these things, but also am excited to learn if i have missed something in my way of thinking . I now feel u are vary passionate as well.. &amp; u dont no me from &amp; i no it goes through ur head and many others "i am not going to wast
@GozoTweets @Kramer_Hamster @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Ppl dont listen and pay attention to rude, hateful, snide remarks.. both parties and sides need to educate, so what if it just is piddling ole twitter
@GozoTweets @Kramer_Hamster @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Very true! We probably will never agree.which means nothing to either u or i.. but if i got just ONE person to look at things deeper,  dont give a crap which side doesnt have to be mine, then i feel i have done what was rt for the great of AMERICA AS A WHOLE
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP See there ya go.. be a change, be proud, stand up.. no matter the "category" haha
@GozoTweets @JeffMelody2 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I respect that.. i suppose i am different, &amp;  im more than likely from a different generation than u lol but in a perfect world if we all tried a lil harder &amp; respectfully stood up for r beliefs we would see a change, but i am nt so much naive to know my "request" is a long shot
@redhead_true @HanluxThe @glennbeck I probably think way out there, parties aside, but here goes anyway.. i honestly think we (maybe not we) but probably my kiddos will see a full blown civil war break lose in this co before any of WW happens again.. okay let the hateful bashing start lol
@MaxMc612 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Thats right! I try so very very hard but man one can only take so much.. ahhhh
@HanluxThe @glennbeck That is exactly what is taking place. It blows my mind.. i guess one can say im young and dumb, but i was not raised to act like that.. the best part, wait for it i was raised by a long line of straight ticket DEMOCRATS.. what happened
@GozoTweets @canisvex629 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Yeah that comment by canisvex completely lost me lol
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP You are grand, you can handle the task üòâ
@GozoTweets @pcodignoni @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP You are most definitely correct! Both parties need some major adjustments, big time!! Im mot to good to see the bad in BOTH as well as the good.. but please, go do something to help change it.. spread your views in the correct way and you could possibly change 1's way of thinking
@GozoTweets @OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Why do you continue to tweet, but how about tweet things and ideas and facts that would actually HELP you party out, there is zero purpose served tweeting things like ur last reply.. both parties and the ppl involved need help and need educated, why dont you attempt that
@GozoTweets @JeffMelody2 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats See this back and forth is unnecessary.. however i did ask a question to get a strong democratics view and you act like im out of my mind.. but you will carry on like this about useless tweets.. dont get it
@GozoTweets @Kramer_Hamster @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats See you make great points at times, i see what you are saying in regards to her tweet
@GozoTweets @tallnblonde1 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Okay you got her there lol
@GozoTweets @MsTonieaton @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats U will get a kick out of this.its a predominantly democratic state. &amp; yes we are n a mess, heck took yearS to even get a budget in place.yes im sure there are "worse" states but i have yet 2 talk 2 a resident of ILLINOIS that will say any different than I, if u no of ne let me no
@GozoTweets @MsTonieaton @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Im impressed.. see i new there were still some good sides in the mix of this party somewhere
@GozoTweets @geterdoneb421 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats With someone that might possibly disagree with you.. and heck currently i am affiliated with the SAME PARTY.. should you not want to do all you can to keep me there
@GozoTweets @geterdoneb421 @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats With.. is it because of your party affiliation, i have no clue.. but that behavior is becoming status quo for the democratic party.. and i hate that for that party i do, my heart and vote has always been with that party, but guys listen to the way you have a conversation with
@geterdoneb421 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I for one have NEVER called anyone on here "stupid" or even so little as insinuated that.. i most definitely do not need to call names to vet anything across to anyone, i will simply say it if need be... yes you are what i would call an extremely hard person to have a discussion
@GozoTweets @MsTonieaton @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats You are quite welcome, this is derived from my reply thread. And while i am hear let me say this is funny you r insinuating  i am shifting things 2 the rt.. please remember i am a registered Democrat! Mind has been blown by your input today, simply blown
@redhead_true @HanluxThe @glennbeck I respect your reply.. things are becoming more sad than i truly think most ppl cAre to admitt
@GozoTweets Not have a simply discussion.. goodness it becomes easier every time a Democrat acts this way, for no reason at all.. so be it
@GozoTweets Knows maybe you could have changed my way of thinking.. shouldnt you want to educate everyone on what you guys or u think the best way to handle these poor kids.. cause if it was up to you those poor kids would never get back to mommy, because it is clear tou and your party can
@GozoTweets This ENTIRE thing is only because i asked you ONE, just ONE question and i have yet to see you answer it.. all you can do is talking down to or about anyone who believes different than you..i most definitely dont need us to agree, however i would liked to see "your side" who
@tahoebearrr @MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Something, somewhere is going to have to break lose and change..
@daBruceJuice @pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP Do you mean "blinders" if so, mine r slowly coming down &amp; i am starting to question some major things my party once stood for, hence this whole conversation &amp; btw i am a registered Democrat, so you can do your own assuming on which party i am starting to see through clear glass
@Dalila24249083 @ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff You have completely lost me with your reply, who is discussing what?
@geterdoneb421 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I am seeing that quite quickly.. well, whatever i suppose to each THERE own üòâ
@OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck Agreed! And i clearly remember hearing/reading around election campaigns that the (r) didnt even want him
@leftisright62 Only speaking on this post... i have no clue how much deeper it can get.. i had no words
@AgingGrace10 @glennbeck The "vote for the best i agree with" but to me this isnt just one election to me and a lot.. each election is huge to me and worth researching and trying to help others see all points
@lynncos7 Get Americans to be proud and RESPECTFULLY stand up for yourself and your beliefs i would be so happy.. showing pride and being proud for something is NOT responding in the way i have seen a lot of Democrats act hear recently
@lynncos7 Pride in your state take some pride in your country.. do something or be apart of something YOU CAN BE PROUD OF... come on America we are quickly losing our core morals and values, respect and PRIDE for this country.. and this may be wrong of me but at this point if we could just
@lynncos7 Reading that honestly brought years to my eyes just now.. this is what needs to happen. ppl, of all parties, need to get back that "pride feeling" be proud! Thousands fought for you and this country so that we could live like this, now take some pride in your beliefs take some
@OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck The K escapade is what really made me starting look at things a tad differently.. i was absolutely baffled by what was taking place
@OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck Perfectly said . .by "last tweet" was that telling me this was your last tweet to me? lol
@ReedKama @glennbeck I just had a strong no gray area Democrat tell me that there was not one single Republican "walking away" or one single Republican welcoming a democratic.. told me thoes were all lies i listened to by my president lol
@OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck I was born in 83 so honestly i just know the name gary hart, i no nothing about him
@OmegaVox @WendellSherk @glennbeck "Billy bob Clinton" this seriously made my entire coming week! I honestly never realized how closed/small minded a lot of that party is. I guess cause im nt at all like that i wrongly assumed others in my party were no different..definitely my bad lol
@lynncos7 I have probably never been so proud of a US senator like i was her! I tweeted many times how much respect i have for her and how proud her constituents of Maine must feel so awesome to actually talk to somebody from Maine today
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck Not that I can promise they understood everything but I can promise they listen to me and I can promise they were involved in a senate vote in that type of manner that probably a lot of children did not even know what was going on
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck And continuing to use this as a teaching tool for many different aspects especially teaching tools for my two sons and a valuable teaching tool for my daughter some may agree some or a lot May disagree that I involved in this but I thought it was the right thing to do at the time
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck And i also have 2 sons, i also have a daughter, oh and a husband lol boys are 14 and 12 sissy is 10.. I chose not to include them on every detail however I as a parent thought it was my job to involve them in a possible life changing event and Circumstance in our country I also
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck That was my major eye opening moment! I was truly amazed by some of the things that were done, said and have transpired after the fact
@HanluxThe @glennbeck I agree, the majority probably are "good ppl"
@pcodignoni @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP It has become hard
And this is why ppl are walking away.. you cant speak to half of them with making a clear point and then being blocked.. you have got to be kidding me https://t.co/SwlMqaUJbC
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff What you just said made zero sense to my comment
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff And let me make it clear i am a registered Democrat for now, sitting as an election judge as a DEMOCRAT
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff So basically you are a straight Democrat period no questions asked... as a caring human, what? A caring caring human that us a straight no gray area pro abortion? What? A "NO GRAY area democratic" and "caring human" do not belong in the same sentence.
@Observed2Long Okay i most definitely see what you are saying and respectfully understand it a little better now, thank you
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Oh i could tag multiple ppl today only that has walked away, i no ppl personally
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Skin color
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff And they do nothing about it the more people that read the post that I put about standing up for yourself if you get told that the better I have two people read it and actually stand up for themselves instead of powering down and going home I don't care what party it is nor your
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Have to go through things like that it's horrible my main point was people like me or you or the next person down the road and Jim Bob on the road need to express to these people that they need to stand up for their rights it hurts me to think somebody would be treated that way
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Yes I am sorry I am compassionate about that I understand that it goes on I'm not naive to it and you are correct I probably won't have to face in my life a lot of the horrible wrong things that some people do face whether they're black or white and I hurt for the people that
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Affiliation and who they're going to vote for not their skin
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff I'm just going to throw this out here since it got to this point chances are if a black person is being told they can't vote can't ride a bus to the polling whatever the case maybe it isn't because they're black if they're being told that it is probably because of their party
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff I don't know if they objected or not what I'm saying is I can't fathom someone not objecting to it I don't care their skin color is rainbow or what party you're from you're missing the point in the big picture and turning it into something that it's not
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Which brings me back to the whole topic of today on people walking away from the Democratic Party because of certain things that are being done and said and tested and lied
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Please don't try to turn nothing into something I was on your side to begin with but now I'm questioning myself
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Okay i understand that, but you co completely was attempting to say that I was white therefore I didn't sell them those kind of situations because I was white which is not at all what I was saying and I clearly said I feel sorry for them it hurts me that nobody will stand up
Hard time standing behind this type of thing from a party. &amp; its nt just this 1 person or this 1 post, it is becoming the new norm for a lot of them.. idk maybe i am missing it or an wrong
Guys help me out here. plz go 2 this thread &amp; review the replies from a loudly voiced dem &amp; tell me how this tweet tells a person I AM WHITE. this is a perfect example of my struggle, this party is changing things to fit what they need or want, i hav a https://t.co/xNMNGHVbog
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff They will just accept that and go home... does that makes more since to ya? Or did i get that out a different more clear way?
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff No no, see that is where either you misunderstood or i did not say it clearly	.. i can fathom the issues, what i can not fathom is being the person these things are being done to and NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT... because we all know there are some that will be told "no vote" and
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Okay, wasnt going to waste my time or yours with answering the question if you were being sarcastic
@MaxMc612 @glennbeck Thank you, some days the struggle gets easier and easier
@lindaslade68 @WendellSherk @glennbeck As each day with new events pass us.. its a shame.. thank you for even bothering with the time to let me know and replying..
@geterdoneb421 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I guess im the crazy one cause im more than willing to listen to their reasonings, not saying they will change my way of thinking, but im not closed minded enough to think my way is the only way
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff What in the world did my last reply say that you would assume that.. i honestly dont understand
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck I appreciate your words! I honestly do care, i care about our country and i care about the ppl in our country! We are going through some sad, tough hard times at the present time but i have pride and faith it wont always be this way, it will get better, even for just a little bit
@GozoTweets @MsTonieaton @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats It is interesting indeed, especially when ppl all over the world assume they know said person solely based on a few tweets on their Twitter feed üòâ
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Are you honestly asking me for an answer here? Honest question
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Keep me from voting.. that is sad
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff I just cant fathom being a person turned away or one of the purged ppl and not standing up or speaking up and doing something.. to me the sad part is to think of all the votes that will just accept the reason given for them "not being allowed" to vote or accept a party trying to
@geterdoneb421 @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats Gozo has a hard time answering a direct question, so good luck getting an answer, i sure couldnt get anything with an honest question besides some dodging and answering a question with a demanding question lol
@Lalexam09 @glennbeck You are correct, their are quite a few social turn offs.. some times i think there are some that have not only "went of course" but went off the deep end.. i am really trying to find that mix, because when i do the ole pro con lost sorta speak my list is becoming way off balance
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff My naive world and thinking that just because the poll watchers are supposed to be there for BOTH parties in all reality it not always happens like that.. i truly do wish something could be done for you and your state, i hurt for the ppl
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff I completely and honestly understand what you were saying and I was really just trying to help or give a suggestion. I know it may not do anything or mean much but if I could tell one person about it that may not know it may help somebody out.. i guess sometimes i still live in
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats And right now the state we live in is such a mess financially and with taxes and the programs to hurt the poor, ppl are moving out state left and right
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats My dad and his parents are fairly big farmers &amp; always have been. So they worked for what little they had even though they farmed a bunch of acres, they were definitely not upper class or even middle class some yrs, so they had very similar thinking as your momma
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff And yes they could help with the x amount of purged names
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff Would claim their name wasnt listed as being able to vote.. or any of the reasons that were listed farther up in the thread... i qas just trying to help out and see if you could request some poll watchers to be very present, i am sorry and i will leave you be
@ckn4502 @moroccandna @KaivanShroff I understand that.. i just know the state i am in we have them, and those ppl would be the ones to report or handle any judge handling the elections at that polling place that would possibly not give someone a provisional ballet because of a misspelling in their name, or if they
@GozoTweets Would have been a bit more informing.. must not wanna "change the world the the better" that bad
@GozoTweets Possibly want to change there mind or opinion.. you guys need to learn to communicate and not dodge questions and actually stand up and back up what you supposedly believe in.. you mite just mite sway a few votes that direction.. have a great day, i do wish your part of the convo
@GozoTweets Now we both have stated my words mean nothing to you, and you dont have many words to back up anything so that is pretty easy to mean nothing to me &amp; now we can end this conversation, but just some advice if in the future you or "your side" want someone to see your point or u
@GozoTweets Children... and it is completely sad... i thought maybe you could be the one to make me see your side a little better, but all you did qas dodge questions and then "demand" answer on my views.. what good is that. So there is my educated well informed answer, right or wrong
@GozoTweets A little  it of civil talking and for once working together for the better of ALL ppl and co..  ut i have found those that believe along the lines as you, qont listen to a word anyone else says.. it has to be that way or no way, then we are all cold heart mean Americans that hate
@GozoTweets Will make it a tiny bit better.. for both sides all parties everyone to COME TOGETHER  for just as long as it yakes to figure a way to help the familes that really need help in a better way than we are now WITH OUT hurting or harming our own co and ppl.. thats all it would take,
@GozoTweets Am i 100% correct nope, are my thoughts and views all perfect and correct nope.. but i also cant support the side that is wanting to welcome possible terrorists to do as the please while they wait, children included! Im sorry the world sucks, it does for everyone but one thing
@GozoTweets But no one can expect the US to do everything the way they want it done.. if they didnt agree with what was happen DONT COME THAT WAY..
@GozoTweets However it hasnt happened yet and over half of these familes coming here claiming they need help immediately already knew what was going to happen the minute they stepped foot over here.. they new they would be separated, so if that is not something you were ok with, then im sorr
@GozoTweets To be together in a group possibly plan an attack.. are they all "bad" ppl no definitely not, and if you are honest and on the up n up you wont mind do things a different way to ensure your child stays with you.. do i think the US could stand to change some policies ABSOLUTELY
@GozoTweets "Okay u guys in this group can just all stay together, you can be with your husband and your kids, here just chill out in this huge shed we have and dont do anything bad or mean to this co.. yeah i dont think i want a child and their family that before left home shot the town up
@GozoTweets For those seeking help and most definitely  etter for the children... do you realize in some places in this world there are 5 and 10 yr old kids killing for the fun of it.. it will not be good or safe for the US or the citizens to just let them come on over here and tell em
@GozoTweets She is hearing and has completed all of her documents she jumped through all the hoops and her child never left her side, and she is a legal US citizen as well as her children... my point is it can be done many ways, ways that are better for the US and safer for the US, better
@GozoTweets 11) bad happening.. and she would NEVER put her children through the hell of jumping countries, swimming through rivers/lakes/oceans or being taken or SEPARATED from her at any moment.. so she did thi gs the leagal and proper way that was the SAFEST  for her children.. guess what
@GozoTweets 10)US soil.. she will tell you she could have very easily skipped borders and go in the big "group" that was coming to "seek asylum" at the time.. but she new if she did it that way it would not be easy on her or her family, if she did it that way there was a chance of anything
@GozoTweets 9) she needed her family, herself and her children out of the mess they were getting in to as a co.. she didnt however starting "skipping borders" to get here, she started the processes the proper way and was already in contact with US government agencies before stepping foot on
@GozoTweets 8) the US, they are doing Mexico "wrong" as well.. Mexico most definitely does not want them there and in all reality cant afford to have them there, they have enoigh problems as it is.. i have a very dear friend who is from Nicaragua.. she has lived in the states about 10 years
@GozoTweets 7) out of their horrible life, their are different options for them to cross the border.. they most definitely do not have to act and do what the "huge" caravan is doing as we speak.. they are breaking all kinds or policies, procedures, and laws, and they arent only dealing with
@GozoTweets 6) detained, and yes that means the children as well.. do i still believe they are breaking the rules and "laws" in place some of them yes! Are they causing the US problems once here waiting, yep... there are also many other different options for thoes who truly just want to get
@GozoTweets 6) over there supposedly needing help from their co have NOTHING.. no proof, no form of any id, nothing for the children, no birth papers NOTHING.. so while all of these ppl claiming they need help are hearing waiting to be processed to see if, they are telling the truth, have to
@GozoTweets 5) memory the difference, you could look it up but that part doesnt really matter.. those saying they are "seeking asylum" MUST prove their home co is putting them in harms way or jeopardizing their family.. "so i have read" cause none of us no the truth, many of these ppl coming
@GozoTweets 4) it states it doesnt matter how you got here... i fully understand that, HOWEVER they still have to follow the procedures in place once they are here.. there are also 2, 3, 4 if i am remembering different varieties of asylum.. affirmative asylum and defense. No i do not no by
@GozoTweets 3) in place that states the US will help refugees and families seeking asylum, however one most go through the steps through the gov agency's and the embassies. Yes i am knowledgable that one of the stipulations is to seek "asylum" you must be in the US, &amp; yes i pretty sure some
@GozoTweets 2) i will give u the bases to my reasons.. like i stated there are TONS of familes from more than 1 co trying to cross the borders into the US, so i realize there may be different "rules/laws" available for each. However i do know that the US has had &amp;has policies and procedures
@GozoTweets 1) I was nt throwing college at you to prove anything or prove myself, i was simply giving you a little background as to i didnt just pull my views out my butt.. now because i dont go and dodge questions asked of me, i will do my best at answering u, weather it be right or wrong
@MsTonieaton @GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats I stated something similar a few replies ago concerning my father and being a die hard straight ticket Democrat, until a few short months ago.. no clue if he changed his card but if not im assuming he will by the time he has to pull a dem or rep ticket
@jbenton62 @WendellSherk @glennbeck I am appalled, because as you can go through and look i am very open about things, and i have not once be rude, slamming, degrading nothing! So "creepy" idk, but extremely alarming? Absolutely
@GozoTweets Haven't read *^
@GozoTweets Adult life.. maybe there is something i have not seen/read. Or something i have missed
@GozoTweets You lost me now, what is inaccurate? Me stating they were breaking the rules and laws? Im sure i have read each and every policy concerning all the countries and the US borders, althought throughout my 6 yrs in college i have been threw many of them, as well as resources in my
@GozoTweets Point being the parents are breaking laws and rules that are most definitely in place for a reason.. please please come and seek asylum in the proper and legal way for your family, i beg you, get your family out of the horrible mess you are living in, do it correctly please
@JulieHouston @NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff @staceyabrams So yes, it can always be used in a harmful or unnecessary way, you are correct
@JulieHouston @NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff @staceyabrams I have a dear friend who has interracial twins, when enrolling them in school (town census about 1000) she had to check a race.. she chose the one race. And do you know the school called to see if she "really wanted" to pick that one.. i was appalled
@JulieHouston @NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff @staceyabrams Yes i would like to know what you find..im not that far from you, so i woyld bet they will be the same, however i know that doesnt mean anything, no matter how close state to state is different
@NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff Party aside, dont even know your views did look, right is right and wrong is wrong.. and props to YOU for taking a stand and doing your best to do something about it.. way to go, the entire "C"ountry needs more ppl willing to be like you
@NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff I just dont understand, well i do, but how can ppl sit back knowing and watching this happen.. and to me i dont care which party kemp is from, the situation down there just is very wrong in my eyes.. i would care i would say the same if the opposite party was doing this to u guys
@lynncos7 @WendellSherk @glennbeck üëç.. after i typed my responses, i thought well heck i dont guess ive ever ran a mental tally of my left and right activity, maybe it is. I didnt think so but i have been wrong once or twice in my lifetime ha üòâ
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck Well good for me, at least some ones agrees or "gets it" my morning is accomplished lol
@JulieHouston @NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff @staceyabrams You are more than welcome!
@NancyWallaceGA @JulieHouston @KaivanShroff I kinda assumed so, but didnt want to speak out of truth just because thats how "ours" were
@cbrower2141 @WendellSherk @glennbeck I dont understand how small/closed minded some people can be
@cbrower2141 @WendellSherk @glennbeck Okay well that is how i took it at first, but then ya no.. ppl are pretty quite to come out in attack force lol i honestly enjoy hearing others reasonings behind things but wow sometime i question my sanity when i attempt to
@GozoTweets I have asked cant seem to answer that question.. the question being "what is the difference" i have an answer i dont need to research any farther, there is ZERO difference. But at least i can say i feel for every child is that situation i do but their parents BROKE the LAW!
@GozoTweets I mean no personally your views dont matter, but to me by reading some of your tweets it seems you want these children reunited with there parents, so with out you becoming a double standard i would only hope you could have answered the question, however you like the many others
@cbrower2141 @WendellSherk @glennbeck I couldnt tell from the first part if you were being a smart alec or not lol nevertheless the more i "group think" the worse my thoughts become, so i agree there with ya.. but i do like to think i use my brain quite nicely to try and decipher all the craziness going on
@GozoTweets Pretty much.. no matter the country
@GozoTweets Is that they same to you.. or the mom who is unable to work therefore starts selling drugs to put food on the table, she ends up going to jail, there the children have to be separated from her and placed possibly in a hell of a life..do you hope thoes children are reunited w mom
@GozoTweets An education therefore couldnt get a job to support the child they had (possibly out of rape) and these parents need to "work the streets" to even provide bread for there child and themselves.. of course those children are going to be in a horrible horrible place more than likely
@GozoTweets Would you mind me asking u an honest question.. what do you feel about the American infants and children who are placed in a foster care establishment, cause their parents lived on and off the streets because thats how they grew up, then these parents couldnt get to school to get
@GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats @GOP I do not completely disagree with you! Thank you i appreciate it, you as well
@lynncos7 @WendellSherk @glennbeck If you are referring to him stating that about my feed, thank you.. it is most definitely not all right winged..
@lynncos7 @WaldoTames @glennbeck Thats the thing right there, there have been things go on that i can not comfortably feel good about supporting when i lay my head down at night.. does that make since
@GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 5) absurd to me
@GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 4) do i like and agree with a lot kf what trump has done and said.. no i sure dont, do i respect him as our president, yes.. do i think he has done a good job on some things yep i sure do.. so how ppl in twitter land can claim what my "feed" is full of is how i am as a person is
@GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 3) as far as my "feed" and it being full of "right-winged" things.. please take a look again, i love with a pasion politics in general.. i love hearing and reading both sides, all sides.. i love the debates, i love learning others way of thinking about issues/events..
@GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 2) democratic.. i sit as a democratic judge for the elections.. but there have been some major things going on with a party i was once extremely proud to be a party of, that i just cant stand behind...
@GozoTweets @WendellSherk @glennbeck @TheDemocrats 1) I honestly and truly see both and all sides..there are tons of things the dems stand for that i dont but on that flip side there are things the Republicans are doing and stand for that i dont either.. i was raised to become a STRAIGHT ticket DEMOCRAT.. i am still a registered
@WaldoTames @glennbeck *has.. sorry was ising talk to type 		Had to put my correction before the people who dont have a clue who i am start coming at me lol seems thats the norm on here
@WaldoTames @glennbeck Well i was born in the Reagan era, so no help from carter for me, but as I age my ways of thinking are changing.. but you are correct both, well anything and everyone to do with politics was a corrupt side..but the last few months things have went down that im just not okay with
@toniava @WendellSherk @glennbeck Are you referring to me there, toni?

@KeepEugeneWeird @KaivanShroff @joncoopertweets 3) "nope to bad you cant vote" but the moral of this is.. we do check those things that you listed
@KeepEugeneWeird @KaivanShroff @joncoopertweets 2) local courthouse and get help as to providing someone for said person to vote.. send them to our local courthouse or provide said person with a provisional ballot.. you never just check a persons infor and if it doesnt match or things have changed just say
@KeepEugeneWeird @KaivanShroff @joncoopertweets 1) I sit as an election judge, doesnt matter which party i sit for, and have for many many.. i am not in the state of Georgia and i can tell you we check the same things HOWEVER I always ALWAYS either try to find the person correct polling place if address has changed, call our

@NancyWallaceGA @KaivanShroff @staceyabrams Do you know, are there laws about "conflict of interest" with him sitting on the board and running? I dont know, its an honest question, not being smart.. it would seem to me there should be a "law" or rule in place for a situation like Georgias situation

@MsDuhMeanor @sosayu3 @AshaRangappa_ That is merely an assumption of yours, with zero facts to back it up
@sosayu3 @AshaRangappa_ I would have to say i agree with you on, the American people need some peace of mind and comfort right now. yes we all have different opinions on how to be serious, but we, all parties,  should be able to say we need some comfort n knowing things are being handled n getting beter
@sosayu3 @AshaRangappa_ Well Trump did state, before the meeting, on fox and friends, something along the lines of the great amount of African American supports and voters he had... which i did a little research and im actually finding Hillary Clinton had a higher %
@sosayu3 @AshaRangappa_ Can definitely see why one would say that! My whole thing was, what did we gain out of the meeting, what was the purpose, and what will change for the good because of it?

@weaver_1965 @krassenstein That is absolutely fine for you to have an opinion, the above is your opinion and i respect that, hating him or someone is not an opinion, and yes hate is part of the problem, as well as ppl not willing to listen and respect anyone else if they dont agree with them, i will leave
@paige_not Such a sad time in this world! But props to your lil bro for standing up for himself and what was right!
@weaver_1965 @krassenstein Hate is not an opinion.. but you are correct , the good Lord will separate everything out when it is time.. but meanwhile we could being down here attempting to make things better and bring ppl together, not stir the hate
@weaver_1965 @krassenstein I do, and if you read what i said along this whole thread you will see, it doesnt matter which "side" you are on... in a time like now we need to come together for the good of this world, not hating ppl and definitely not wishing death on anyone

@barbde65 @sosayu3 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse That is what it is going to take to begin to change anything in this world
@barbde65 @sosayu3 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Us where we are the last two years I can't honestly blame it on one person or one thing I'm with you I think it's been brewing for some time
@barbde65 @sosayu3 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Probably the best thing i have seen all day ... I'm not saying that I agree with everything he does because I don't and nobody is going to agree with everything any president does I don't care what side you're on I honestly think it's a combination of a lot of things that has got
@sosayu3 @barbde65 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Amen! Look forward to talking to you more
@SwedishDavid @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Okay but this has nothing to do as to him holding his rally while people are suffering from hurricane Michael... that is what was being discussed
@sosayu3 @barbde65 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You are are correct, i have a feeling you and i do not completely agree on politics and that is fine, i can learn from you and listen to you weather it changes my mind or not, but acting like some are is most definitely not going to change my mind

@sosayu3 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I completely understand what you mean. Honestly! And enjoy talking and learning at a time like things the views of others.. because now i deeply understand that above all him canceling the rally would show a sign of respect, thank you
@sosayu3 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I definitely agree, and i honestly try to listen and hear out both sides..

@Corndawg007 @paige_not @realDonaldTrump @kathygriffin You just have proven my point, thank you!
@sosayu3 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Can you tell me what any of the president's say from Clinton until present did in a time like this? Honest question
@damnyakeez @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse So basically you personally arent saying he should being physically doing anything, but you are saying he just should respect thoes affected and not holdd a rally? If that is the case, weather i agree or nt i completely understand what you are saying and respect that
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse The help the state needs.. geez what more do you ppl want him to do, go scoop water in buckets... my heart goes out to everyone affected and much prayers are being said
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse The help they need
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse What do you want him to do right now at this moment? Im positive he will be going to the effected areas, but literally there is nothing more he could do other than what he has already done!
