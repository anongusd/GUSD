One thing is for sure. With the passing of the #NationalEmergency declaration, most of Trump's base have secured their 2020 vote for him as he has shown that he will go to the limits to protect the southern border

THIS JUST IN: Schumer said there will be a "discussion" on border security as "we promised."  		[paraphrasing] The American people were agast at what Trump did to the federal workers, Democrats are firmly against the wall but can agree on other sercurity things #RealTalk
Pelosi seemingly got what she wanted or asked for based on this analysis by John Roberts https://t.co/NOz9QSN8WV
@JoeDanMedia Sorry buddy. he caved. He said he wouldn't do this without funds. He did it "without funds"	 	Optics with who? His base?
I am sorry federal workers went a month without paychecks but that wasn't Trump's fault. 		Democrats didn't want to protect over 300 million Americans from illegal activity at our southern border and that's the truth. Trump offered many things and Dems said no. #RealTalk
The ball was in Pelosi's court when Pres. Trump offered her 30 days government open and she said no		He offered extension of DACA she said no		and so on. The ball has been in her court so stop telling me ..... Now the ball is in her court. Please STOP! I told you I am #tired

It's funny how people are telling me the ball is in the Democrats court now		Excuse me, it's been there the last month and they have resisted. Why would they make a deal now? They got the gov't reopened on their terms - no border funds. 		We're actually back to the Dec proposal
Democrats learned today they don't have to really compromise on anything.		They just need to lean on the opposition media for anti-Republican polls and fake group panels blaming the GOP for hating the American worker and like always they will cave. #RealTalk
@willchamberlain @Cernovich I didn't think she was that effective and I guess I didn't see the forest for the trees
@kimmieguy and along comes another poll blaming Republicans and Trump and same results.

@kimmieguy bluff? The government is re-opening and he said he wouldn't do it WITHOUT border funds

@kosh_1 The Black Hebrew Israelites were starting stuff for over an hour and Phillips wasn't around. Their hate speech toward the kids is what started it and yet you're giving them a pass
@thewoman62 So? What information do you have about the black men that started the incident. You don't have none right? 		The media played this well
@thiskevinandrew No, the media made it about him and our side attacked the Native American allowing the racist bigots to get away.		They wanted to make it look like the kids were attacking a Native American and it worked. Look at all of the hate toward him and not the bigots that started it
@StruxMel No he wasn't. He was chanting. The stories have been merged. There's no where in the video that you see Native American saying nasty things or did you see that? He was beating his drum chanting. The nasty things came from the five black men
So how is he still directing films? Wasn't there allegations on #BryanSinger before these four came out? https://t.co/6aUBOWvdPe

Dems won't come to the table because they have exactly what they want. They have no plans to govern - just to shut Trump down. They wouldn't even know what to do next.
To achieve their plan of single-party rule, they must continue to swear in 900,000 new citizens(Democrat voters) each year as they have been.  If Trump stops the influx, the plan will fail.
President Harry Truman, NOT a lawyer, called Congress back from recess and made them work 7 days a week until he got his bill passed. Trump should adopt the Truman method.
Dems don't care about a wall or the money it takes.  Their only goal here is to prevent Trump from succeeding no matter what it does to the US

@Catmcnap3 Change does take time but what you do with that time means a lot too. Republicans have to have an effort to outlast and outsmart Democrats with a better message and strong agenda. Tweets and Facebook posts aren't going to do it.
@charlesrmonroe or possibly get Republicans to start talking to urban voters like they were humans and give them new options of proven successes. What do you think about that?

@karldav84202052 Really? Are you exactly talking to urban voters or you think Fox News is doing the job. Remember, minorities do not watch Fox News and that network doesn't care or they would make sure their programming touched issues important to minorities
@RichardBravo You have to have dialogue to win people over. T-shirts and Twitter hashtags are not a winning solution. Also denigrating blacks as if they can't think for themselves is an immediate turnoff
@Isaiah11_2 or maybe Republicans can start going into minority communities and begin dialogue instead of just tweeting?
@darren_nell It makes all the sense in the world. (1) I am speaking to conservatives. If you don't want to read it correctly that's on you. (2) Dems have worked by lying to blacks over the past 60-plus years so don't say they haven't worked
