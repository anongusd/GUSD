Sunday nights are as they should be, now that #MadMen is back
GOP starting to win the Internet? So Good“@GovChristie: Thanks @bennyjohnson, or as you’re also known: BuzzFeedKitty http://t.co/w6oKIvs46F”
We have an amazing family! “@KCRG: SaPaDaPaSo Parade a Glynn Family Tradition http://t.co/TJTXGo5TNZ - Mobile: http://t.co/DJjsjUSZJZ”
@itsbetsybone I couldn't be more excited to come to IL this weekend, it has been much too long since I've seen you!

RT @RNCResearch: 6 Obama administration sequester claims shot down by fact checkers	http://t.co/qdHG7tpkFi
They should have started using the #Jaws theme for the cutoff at the #oscars years ago. Definitely adds to the drama #OSCARS2013 #Jawsed
Absolutely unbelievable MT“@cbs2iowa: Linn County Board of Supervisors approved 20% pay increase this morning boosting their pay to $94,000"
Great night for @IowaHoops with @HaleyVanSoelen  #ICalwaysfeelslikehome
I can hardly believe that Sen. Harkin is retiring. 2014 just got a lot more interesting for Iowa #IASEN  #2014startsnow
RT @WSJpolitics: Court Rules Obama Picks Are Illegal http://t.co/0wjDx8A9
Dear #2012, it's been quite a year, but I am not sorry to see you end. #NYE #2013
So blessed to be able to spend the holidays with such an amazing family! #merrychristmas #myfamilyisthebest
Every time I go back home to #CedarRapids there are new traffic lights, ridiculous #moreplacesforcameras #imsureitsaboutsafety
“@PatGrassley: Excited to announce that I will be chair of the Agriculture Committee in the upcoming legislative session” Congrats!

RT @AnnCoulter: I feel so sorry for Mitt Romney, but sorrier for the country that will never have him as president.
RT @RumsfeldOffice: Voted by absentee in New Mexico with optimism that a new president can turn this country around. The last thing on m ...
RT @coryjcrowley: Revenge is a TV show, not a reason to vote. #LoveOfCountry #RomneyRyan2012 #cantafford4more
@coryjcrowley evidently people can build campaigns, but they can't build businesses #CantAfford4More
The only thing that rivals my excitement for @MittRomney to be our next President, is for @AnnDRomney to be our next First Lady #Romney2012
Wow, @DMRegister finally got a presidential endorsement right! #RomneyRyan2012
Proud of to see my hometown so fired up for soon-to-be President Romney #RomneyIA #CantAfford4More #RomneyRyan2012
Obama hasn't learned to sit without smirking or giggling til it's your turn to speak, his kindergarten teacher must feel like a failure
“@jlglynn: @stephcrowley Pronounced Crow-Leigh is more sophisticated. Get on board. Sheesh.” I'm so behind the times
Since reporters said it, it obviously must be true #deweydefeatstruman
To clarify, @coryjcrowley and I are in fact not related to the tonight's moderator, she doesn't even pronounce our last name correctly
@coryjcrowley glad to see Syria finally getting some attention
Can't decide which is better the Obama smirk or the Biden laugh #vpdebate #thecameraisalwayson
RT @NRCC: Clear eyes. Full hearts. Can't lose! #GOP2012
@MittRomney speaking straight to the camera during the debate I can see what our next President will look like speaking from the Oval Office
Love that @MittRomney is bringing up Obama '08 campaign promises that he has proved he will never be able to deliver on #wecandobetter
When @BarackObama smirks down at his podium, he knows we can see that right? #2012Debate #CantAfford4More #isitnovember6yet?
@itsbetsybone it's finally time! So excited #ilovedebates
Always love the Iowa/Iowa State game #GoHawks #HawkeyeState
After watching #DNC2012 I #Literally couldn't be more excited to vote for #RomneyRyan2012 #excitedfornovember
It's hard for grads to pay of student loans, regardless of the interest rates, when they can't find jobs #DNC2012
8 months after casting a vote for @MittRomney on a scrap of paper in a middle school auditorium in #cedarrapids so glad he's the nominee!
@CondoleezaRice amazing speech at convention, enthusiastic response from the crowd #RomneyRyan2012
Great speech by @ArcherForIowa at convention, great for Iowa's second district! #RNC12
Started day at the #iowastatefair wonderfully seeing @RepPaulRyan ending on a worse note passing @davidaxelrod #cantwaitfornovember
Huge crowd excited to hear @RepPaulRyan at the soapbox! #iowastatefair #RomneyRyan2012
Excited to vote #RomneyRyan2012 in November! #gopvictory
Is there any Olympic event that is odder than the steeplechase? #London2012
So awesome the US women won team gold in gymnastics! #London2012 #TeamUSA
As bad as the opening ceremony was, the ads for @BarackObama were far worse. Can't wait to cast my vote this fall for @MittRomney
Reason to be glad that we won the Revolutionary War, we don't have to pretend the opening ceremonies are good out of patriotism #London2012
Sweet corn being put to good use in DC as a flavored tonic in gin w/ @coryjcrowley #ofalltheginjoints

Overheard @ dsmbeerfest: someone asking if the Iowa state Capitol is a Mormon church #fail #yesourcapitolisamazing
Blessed to live and work in such a wonderful state #TopStatesIA
Excited for Death Cab for Cutie with @JessRundlett #8035DSM
Turned out to be a great night for Yankee Doodle Pops! with @HaleyVanSoelen #DSM #IndependenceDay
Just finished "Destiny of the Republic" very interesting book, I thoroughly enjoyed it #summerreading
Americans deserve accountability in government, today was another step in that long process #holderincontempt
RT @coryjcrowley: Even if court says this is constitutional, it doesn't mean the American people want it.  Elect #Mitt2012 and let's REP ...
“@DarrellIssa: After our meeting, we're on for a #Holder #contempt vote tomorrow. Didn't have to come to this” it's definitely time!
Beautiful night for dinner outside with @Lindsayfelty #IowaSummer
@DonMcDowell I was in fact at #Menchies last night. I'm a fan of all the frozen yogurt places opening up in #DSM
Agreed! “@JessRundlett: What's better than a #Mojito Monday at @Dos_Rios with @stephcrowley and @_LindsayNic_? Not a whole lot! #tacos”
@coryjcrowley always happy to recommend new ice cream. Knew you'd love it!
RT @PatGrassley: 61% thanks HD50 voters its an honor.  #positivecampaign

Seeing the beautiful Iowa countryside, listening to '60s French pop with @coryjcrowley #caseofthemondays
Beautiful night to sit outside on a patio in downtown with @JessRundlett
Congrats to @jamesandjene on the launch tonight! Best of luck!

RT @DarrellIssa: RT this if you think AG #Holder should be held in contempt for #FastAndFurious stonewalling
Excited to finally be seeing Titanic 3d with @HaleyVanSoelen  #ilovethe90s
Wonderful opening of the new Iowa and the Civil War exhibit!
It has been too long, glad #MadMen is finally back tonight!
@coryjcrowley I think it has to be done #itsnotgoodbyejustseeyouaftereaster
@gichygichy are there going to be #presidentialvalentines this year? They are the best part of the holiday!
My only hope for tonight's debate is a special appearance by Jimmy Fallon to help Brian Williams slow jam the debate questions #fldebate
@coryjcrowley I agree that McCain-Feingold is a mess too. I just love seeing campaign finance getting so much attention!
Why do moderators/networks ever think they can have a debate without an alert when time has expired ? Never seems to work...#SCdebate
CR 17 indicative of state at least for the lead, Romney 44 Paul 44 santorum 33 Gingrich 22 bachmann 10 perry 8 #iacaucus
