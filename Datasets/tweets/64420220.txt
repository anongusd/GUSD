Reproductive justice can only be achieved when all people have the social, political, and economic power to make decisions about their own health, bodies, and sexuality.
The fight to end violence against women and girls must include a focus on reproductive justice, as it is a necessary component of gender equality and racial justice.
Violence against women and girls takes many forms, including reproductive abuse and reproductive coercion. Within the context of domestic violence, this occurs when an abuser uses intimidation, threats, and/or physical violence to control their partner‚Äôs reproductive choices.
