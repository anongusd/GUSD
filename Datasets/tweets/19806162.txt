@ellievan65 Ouch!  Gonna need more than a bandaid!
@darylwolke @blynchca @jonathanvswan @soledadobrien @realDonaldTrump When we know the answer to that we will all be better off.  I don’t think it’s about seating judges asi don’t think trump thought that far ahead. That’s just a by product that he can point to some success about.
@AzDerbyGirl @8USC12 @SpeakerPelosi @CBP @ICEgov Handing the president more power is perhaps the most dangerous thing of all.  Whoever it is.
@8USC12 @AzDerbyGirl @SpeakerPelosi @CBP @ICEgov Sure
@AzDerbyGirl @SpeakerPelosi @CBP @ICEgov @8USC12 In some places yes, but not everywhere
@AzDerbyGirl @SpeakerPelosi @CBP @ICEgov @8USC12 I think they were basically saying that an ancient solution won’t work.  You could say that the wall is a metaphor but that’s not how it was sold to the general public.
@AzDerbyGirl @richgibson59 @1776Stonewall Open borders is a nonsense argument.  Nobody in either party has ever advocated that.  It’s just a trump talking point not based on fact
@AzDerbyGirl @richgibson59 @1776Stonewall State and local tax.  You can no longer deduct anything over $10000.
@richgibson59 @AzDerbyGirl @1776Stonewall I think the decision to move is not based upon lawlessness but rather economic.  The latest salt tax changes could accelerate that as they were clearly unfavorable to the east and west coasts.
@GeckosarahSarah @NRDC Behold the wolf in charge of the chicken coop
@nick_ramsey @nytimes Errrr!  Here come the alternative facts...
@richgibson59 @AzDerbyGirl @1776Stonewall What’s California becoming?
@EdKrassen @Chicago83772043 Another sycophantic puppet
@realDonaldTrump Translation...believe me I’m a total war hero!  I know more about wars than all the generals as I’m a stable genius who can’t read and gets his diplomacy by watching 🦊.
@realDonaldTrump Translation...pay attention as everyone I say lies ends up being the truthful ones.  Everyone I praise profusely are the very people I’m most afraid of telling true tales about the house of trump.
@jdice03 From the sublime to the ridiculous.  This is truly one of the best soap operas on tv!
@DemWrite @annita_bowman Akin to putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank
Bummer.
@CactusAnnie1 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Maybe you can learn to read and understand the section 3 and 4 which clearly are relevant here.
@RWPUSA @HCPRpro3 Stupid is as stupid does.
@HCPRpro3 They really are members of the keystone cops.
@wandamill61 @CGAdamo I don’t think you need to be Christian to be happy or sad.  You could be atheistor any other religion.  Happy that you find comfort find your religion.	Trump isn’t and never has been Christian.  He only worships money which maybe is why he’s so angry all the time
@wandamill61 @CGAdamo Except I voted for Trump so you are both wrong
@CGAdamo Christopher, how many children have you adopted?  None I suspect.	For your information not that you care I voted for the same person as you.
@CGAdamo @wandamill61 Cristian hypocrites like you are sad
@CGAdamo You are funny.  You are a blowhard.
@wandamill61 @CGAdamo Actually trumps current power grab with his emergency declaration and the acquiescence of the senate is far more dangerous than two people talkeking about invoking the 25th on a mad president
@CGAdamo @wandamill61 McCabe is a life long republican.   Calling me names when you know nothing about me is simply a sign your a blowhard.  Doing what is right is not based simply on your opinion but should be based upon the constitution. McCabe was in fact following it.
@CGAdamo @wandamill61 Trump is not king!  It is the duty to protect America not to pledge loyalty to a president. Sections 3 and 4 of the25th amendment are applicable here.
@Munchki01236749 @CactusAnnie1 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I’m reading the amendment.  History is not relevant here.
@Bigskydok John,section 3 and 4 apply
@Munchki01236749 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Section 3 and 4 seem to apply
@CactusAnnie1 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Section 3 and 4 seem to apply.  You should read them.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It’s actually incumbent upon all to follow the constitution.  The 25th amendment clearly instructs the Congress, senate and senior officers to safeguard the country from tyranny.	The act of treason would actually be to not consider the 25th amendment.
Ulan ude was just like this too
@realDonaldTrump Translation...serious professional tenured civil servants were so alarmed by what that saw they openly considered the unthinkable.	There are many that consider it a very reasonable response.
@thatginamiller @gemn_gavin_ The consequences of Brexit are starting to play out. It will be indiscriminate of course but only the rich will benefit
@HCPRpro3 @ShoujoWitch @SocialPowerOne1 Probably a better policy than being tolerant as it removes the reward
@HCPRpro3 @ShoujoWitch @SocialPowerOne1 I’m pretty tolerant.  I take chances all the time.  I was just surprised by the venemous tone our friend took.
@HCPRpro3 @ShoujoWitch @SocialPowerOne1 I’m not typically a blocker but there have been some exceptions
@ShoujoWitch @HCPRpro3 @SocialPowerOne1 Because that was the subject matter.
@ShoujoWitch @HCPRpro3 @SocialPowerOne1 Your a troll right? Your logic is warped
@HuffPost One of the very few things she says I’d agree with
@HuffPost Just curious, why do you devote so much space daily to Jim Carrey’s art?
@HCPRpro3 @ShoujoWitch @SocialPowerOne1 Exactly
@BillKristol Ironic
@ShoujoWitch @HCPRpro3 @SocialPowerOne1 We have six kids.  Ones adopted.  Why would that disqualify me from supporting others choice?
@HCPRpro3 @ShoujoWitch @SocialPowerOne1 We adopted, but then we are pro choice!  Ironic!
@SocialPowerOne1 @HCPRpro3 I don’t see all the concerned prolife folks who want everyone to have babies lining up to adopt.  Far from it!
@Stop_Trump20 @Berlidge I do believe that Obama rides around in limousines. Who exactly is winning mr ancient ford guy
@ktcougar13 @thehill One spine at a time
@ktcougar13 @thehill Different situation.  You will be citing houses as the next example.	I think you will find you are not in the majority as the election was decided by who did not vote rather than who did.  That’s a different discussion
@ktcougar13 @thehill It’s a deterrent not a solution
@ktcougar13 @thehill You are right.  I intensely dislike trump but I don’t think that clouds my judgement on the wall. It won’t work.	 I have friends on both sides as frankly I like to hear everyone’s viewpoint.
@ktcougar13 @thehill Nobody is for criminals. The wall is nothing but symbolic
@ktcougar13 @thehill I think the constitution is respected by all sides, just interpreted differently.
@ktcougar13 @thehill Do you think a wall would stop that?
@ktcougar13 @thehill Most illegals simply overstay their visas.  A wall won’t help there.
@ktcougar13 @thehill Your diverting your argument.  We were talking about a wall.  The premise made for the wall is pure BS.	Sure a wall is needed in places and not in others.  Most folks arriving at the border and presenting themselves are refugees looking for immigrant status.
@ktcougar13 @thehill How so?  By that same logic China is paying tariffs!
@ktcougar13 @thehill Clearly you don’t know me.  	I think the latest elections did not back up your assertions. Any reasonable person would come to that same conclusion.	But then you appear to not be a reasonable person as you insult strangers just like your boss.
@ktcougar13 @thehill And of course Mexico will pay for it!
@thehill Name one.  People understand fully that robbing Peter to pay Paul is business as usual in DC.	Saying it’s too complicated is really just an insult.
@rjcrock2003 These folks are vultures
@realDonaldTrump Hold on!  You may be causingmuch if the depression!
@DavidLammy @endededdie He should go to jail and not pass go!
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Name one.
@Cryptosophus @iamthetruth2019 @realDonaldTrump Very true.  He’s pandering to Avery small and I believe shrinking crowd
@iamthetruth2019 @realDonaldTrump It all works better if we work together. He’s really not doing that.  He doesn’t even listen to his closest advisors.	Presidents are always criticized from both left and right. This guy however is on steroids do the reactions are equally venomous
@realDonaldTrump A win would be equal approval if you actually gave a healing non partisan sotu.  Sadly you did not.  Your poll only confirms how little you moved the needle towards the middle.  I’m not sure you will ever learn how to govern all
@BSnobblepopkin @BillKristol Pence is going nowhere.  His options are very limited to the Donald’s fate whatever that may be.
@samstein @1Jedi_Rey The god complex is strong with this one..
@activist360 He’s always good for a belly laugh!
@realDonaldTrump Sentence structure is really not a strong point
@MillerCoors @MillerLite @CoorsLight I don’t choose either but bud light tastes way better
@HFiskJohnson I understand it mainly comes from 7-8 particular rivers
@Allen_740 Family trait.  No soul either.
It’s WE the people, not I the people!
@Allen_740 Like what?
@PalmerReport It’s kinda funny how he thinks about walls.  They haven’t worked for thousands of years!
Welcome to the. State of disunion
@TeaPainUSA @BrendaWeese Interesting
@realDonaldTrump Irony!
@MarkWarner @MarnieRose2 So true
@tim_fargo Essential really
@ForeverLogical @Delanie87595583 @realDonaldTrump Behold a president
@Chascabass @MFrance923 @HoarseWisperer @GOP @realDonaldTrump The circle of life
@Alexand40818925 @realDonaldTrump Seems to be a patern brewing....
@realDonaldTrump Translation..borders do need wallsbut not everywhere.  I exaggerate a lot,actually the time.  When I really don’t know what I’m talking about I make even bigger exaggerations using alternative facts
@realDonaldTrump Translation..I’m really old and senile.  This is all too much for me as I barely work an hour a day.  The USA is in chaos as a result.  I’m a one term president as my base is dwindling but the rnc is desperate as they hitched their wagons to my sinking 🚢
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. I made this crisis as I like being in television.  Drama is what I live for.  It serves nobody’s purpose but mine.
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. I’m delusional.  Time existed before me and will after. Borders were secure under democrats and republicans long before a stole the 2016 election.  I like to make up fairy tales so I don’t have to think about mueller knocking on my door
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. I have 3 weeks to wag the dog about a scary refugee caravan full of women and children.  I will make up stories about gangs, terrorists and drug dealers as I don’t have to prove it’s a big lie..
@realDonaldTrump Translation...let me point out some bright shiny objects in an attempt to distract you as I wait for the knock on the door from mueller.  I did everything that you suspect and a whole lot more.
@SpeakerPelosi @taniacarey123 @realDonaldTrump Probably something embarrassing like the pee pee tapes
@jmpalmieri @taniacarey123 Because they have a common enemy.
@blynchca @TheRickWilson Possibly
@TheRickWilson He’s a one term president
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I hurt a lot of people unnecessarily.  I want to look like a hero for doing what I should have done at the start.  I made this mess and look silly as a result.  If I had a heart I would have stopped this nonsense before it started.
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump Agreed.  I enjoyed the discussion.
@SeanTrende @JohnJHarwood Out gunned, out smarted, and best of all by a better female stable genius
@PatsyResists @jlhulsman That should be a badge of honor
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I was humbled by a smarter female stable genius
@DonnaNoble10th One can only hope so
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump Actually it’s not a left or right argument.  You would like to think that elections are not swayed by foreign actors.  Hence mueller.  His job is not to prosecute trump.  Just the truth. Ironicallyhes a republican
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump We shall both find out at the same time.  FYI I don’t dislike all trumps policies, some are good and even smart, I just dislike the manner he chooses to go after them.  I didn’t like Obama either.  I’m a natural republican but not for this guy.
@GunReformRyan Translation.. he likes to make stuff up
RT @behindyourback: he's opening the government for 3 weeks so that Super Bowl crowds don't get stranded at airports, riot, and burn down h…
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump Rico charges rarely show what the intended outcome will be. Current charges are simply related to stupid people caught in stupid lies.  The truth comes at the end when all the lies and liars are exposed.  Kinda the way the law works here.
@BHPIII13 @LynnLynniepoo @MichaelSteele @realDonaldTrump Translation ...I have been humbled by a much smarter stable genius woman
@BBCBreaking Translation.. I’ve been humbled by a much smarter stable genius woman
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump Collusion with a foreign government
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump I’m confident he’s up to his neck
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump Lets wait for muellers results.  That would be the no bs way.
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump It’s fascinating.  I have no idea what the truth is but the president keeps digging an ever larger hole.
@NoBullShtPlease @realDonaldTrump That we are waiting to find out.
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I better instruct my lawyers for a knock on the door as they are getting closer the truth.	Of course I colluded and instructed others to do the same.
@iamthetruth2019 @realDonaldTrump I’m in finance.  It’s not me who can’t read.  I’m translating our dear presidents twitter feed.
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. if I could read I would see that earnings are reported 24/7/365.  Thank you Obama for handing me the winning economy.  Like all my business dealings I will find a way to mess it up
@realDonaldTrump Translation..I’m old and senile and can’t remember yesterday never mind 3 years ago.  I gave an interview that’s constantly haunting me.  Of course it’s all true.
@SenSchumer @Josephi88756868 @realDonaldTrump Wilbur Ross is a great private equity guy but not a great statesman
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. building a wall really works well in my LEGO set.  I know more about everything than anyone else
@realDonaldTrump Translation...slowdowns don’t happen overnight so let me self  flagellate
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. I’ve run out of ideas so I thought I’d say the same thing over and over again.
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. Kim has a new puppet
@realDonaldTrump @DougWead Translation.. but they weren’t in debt up to their eyeballs.  2 trillion!  That’s a lot of money!  Bezos is worth 15 x what I’m worth even after his divorce.  I like money like Kavanaugh likes beer.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Translation..I make up stuff when I’m stuck
@Lucky13Leigh @AzDerbyGirl @SpeakerPelosi Not always by land
@Lucky13Leigh @AzDerbyGirl @SpeakerPelosi Sorry, I was referring to fentanil.  Pot, heroin and coke of course have come from the south but not
@Ron29623775 @realDonaldTrump They are all an awful but some are more awful than others.
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. Sarah got tired of being put in indefensible positions
@realDonaldTrump Translation... where’s the beef?   Jingoism is all I have to offer
@realDonaldTrump Translation.. I didn’t write this as there are no grammatical errors
@realDonaldTrump Translation..how am I going to get myself out of this mess?
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I was thoroughly outmaneuver day and outmatched by Nancy.
@AzDerbyGirl @AdamSchiff @selfhelp5 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump All true, but that doesn’t make trump right.  Drugs don’t really come through the southern border at least not the type that kills you.  Killings by illegals is rare albeit tragic.	A wall is not going to fix the above
@PrincessBravato Deflect deflect deflect
@realDonaldTrump Translation...just like my health exam I wrote this!
@iamthetruth2019 @realDonaldTrump Translating agent orange
@realDonaldTrump Translation.... when I don’t have a good solid foundational argument I like to bake things personal.
@realDonaldTrump Translation..when I have nothing worthwhile to say I make up stuff.  It comes naturally and nobody calls me out on it so I repeat
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I don’t study anything so I make stuff up I think will play tomy base.
@J_Lutz8 @TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber He did,but thenat this point we know that the truth is not his strong suit
@iamthetruth2019 @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Of course
@realDonaldTrump I thought she was stopping cyber bullies yet you persist.
@FT Farage not garage!
@MaraJade_2017 @realDonaldTrump Pence will go down in history as the worlds biggest yes man.
@FT Time to stop beating about the bush.  Time to put Brexit toa 2nd vote.	This time be aware that Russia is trolling and hold garage etc accountable for their lies
@realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx Translation..I like to complement myself as I self justify the worst presidency ever.  I’ve signed lots of bills into law using executive power.  Many haven’t worked.	I managed to get only one bill though congress and the senate.	I wish I was king.
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Translation...yes Schilling was a great bb player. Sadly he’s a total asshole off the field.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Translation...it’s my actions that put my family at risk.  The democrats are simply holding the mirror up
@realDonaldTrump Translation...finally something we can agree on
@56blackcat @ellievan65 Delusional
@realDonaldTrump Translation...the dossier is all true including the pee tape.  I’m very worried about Cohens testimony in 2 weeks.
@realDonaldTrump Translation...trump tower in nyc doesn’t even have a sprinkler system.  The wall is always getting renovated and repaired and has nothing to do with me
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I like to talk and make stuff up.  Like Chancy Gardner, I like to watch tv as I’m illiterate.	The state of the union is a chance for me to be on tv so I can watch myself later on replay.	I wonder which orange makeup I’ll use
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I like to threaten people and I like to make up fake statistics when I don’t know what I’m talking about
@realDonaldTrump Translation...if I could read I would realize that the economy is written about daily.  Most of the credit however goes to Obama even though I think it was all me. But then I think everything is about me.
@realDonaldTrump Translation..the crisis I created is what I’m looking to solve
@freedom_moates Actually they said inaccurate not false
@kenolin1 @LindaSi51445306 Maybe both
A well placed phone call may help the students see the error of their ways.  Simply let them know that Christians show love not hate https://t.co/3QMrO0HBlW
@tturnt1 @realDonaldTrump He is unaware of what a mockery he is
@TwitterMoments @MarieBudd6 Respect.  Thank you for your service and thank you for your grace
@MuslimIQ Beautiful man
@MuslimIQ @kazweida @CovCathColonels Perhaps they can all be rejected from any college they apply to.	Consequences
@katstails @GilbertJojoMama @PaulLeeTicks @LibsInAmerica You can only hope that the consequence is that any college he applies to rejects him.  	Perhaps then he will understand the depth of his disrespect
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should ask rather than tell.  Just a suggestion.
@tturnt1 @realDonaldTrump Maybe sense will prevail
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I think you just need to look in the mirror to understand who is to blame for your troubles
@Sensimilla7 @Early2Rise2 Very sad
@Sensimilla7 @Early2Rise2 I know a few but this kids a prick
@Sensimilla7 @Early2Rise2 Very disrespectful
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I’m making phony statements to try to bolster my case for a useless wall
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I don’t know anyone who thinks that so I made it up as I’m so unpopular
@realDonaldTrump Translation...thank you Obama
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Translation...newt is really old and I’m super unpopular
@EdKrassen @EricLuna1216 @realDonaldTrump Mueller didn’t say not true, he said not accurate
@realDonaldTrump I think it was a Republican dossier first.  Oops!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump It’s a process. It takes time.  Be patient.  The president will either be proved correct or otherwise.  Whatever your bias.  Wait awhile.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Translation...of course I’m guilty so I’m just going to resort to distraction and threatening witnesses and their families.
@gmbosslady64 @ellievan65 @JasonLeopold And still the titanic hasn’t-sunk yet.  How many icebergs does it take?
@JasonLeopold @BakerStGhost @a_cormier_ How many icebergs does the titanic have to hit before it sinks?  Turns out one a day.
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I’ll tell you who’s unhinged....
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I need to wake up!  Borders weren’t porous before I got elected and they won’t be after.  There’s actually net migration the other way.  I think a wall will look as good as a badly styled toupee...
@realDonaldTrump Translation... it’s not that you fire him, it’s why you fired him.
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I need to write and thank Obama for handing me a winning ticket where everyone is lifted by the tide.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Translation...none of this proves I should build a wall.  Actually to the contrary as fentanyl and criminals mostly come in anywhere but where I want to build a wall.
@realDonaldTrump Translation... there will be witches and they will be found but they won’t be on meullers team. No sir!
@krassenstein Chances are he is already dead in the water
@CNN Why not
@kylegriffin1 @LynnBarnett8 I’d be interested in hearing his answers after the shackles are off too.  Sadly I think he’s likely to avoid implicating himself.
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I don’t have an original thought today so I’m just going to keep repeating and repeating
@realDonaldTrump Translation...the humanitarian crisis I caused with families and children, I’d like to blame someone else for my ill conceived policy.  Ooh look it must be the democrats who had no power or control...
@realDonaldTrump Translation... I gave each team member a single Mac and ate the rest.  That’s how I stay trim at 239lbs..
@joelytrumpshate @mommamia1217 At least they were cooked and not frozen!

Barr actually is not a terrible choice given you have no choice. https://t.co/YgjXSJ0nSX
@KKatMiss @HazardThomast @Montel_Williams The border invading caravan was definitely false btw
@KKatMiss @HazardThomast @Montel_Williams False is not my point.  I just said they are awful.  CNN can be awful too
@KKatMiss @HazardThomast @Montel_Williams I think you need to watch them all to get a balanced view. Fox is particularly awful
@realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk Translation, I want to distract you as I’m getting very worried.
@brianstelter @selfhelp5 @jimrutenberg The levels of irony where Trump feels entitled to comment on anyone’s divorce is staggering.  Bezos will still be 20x richer than trump and Amazon will only continue to get stronger.  Trump must feel very small.
@MarnieRose2 Very true
@JohnRam23609234 @Montel_Williams Most are biased.  Some are more biased than others.
@ellievan65 @annita_bowman Why anyone would want to work for this guy is way beyond my understanding.  He is a textbook bully abusive boss.  Employment laws are written to protect employees from exactly who trump is. #trumpbully. #abusiveboss
@realDonaldTrump Translation.  I’m jealous as Bezos even after his divorce is at least 20 x richer than me.	I don’t like the Washington Post as they tell stories about me I can’t read as they don’t have pictures.
@Montel_Williams Fox is a joke!  There is no semblance of unbiased news available in the news entertainment division
@CopperSiren @BBCWorld Sadly he is disinterested in correcting his central ignorance
@CopperSiren @BBCWorld Exactly
@blindfox9 @travellingbex @BBCWorld Definitely born privileged
@travellingbex @BBCWorld Probably true
@BBCWorld Trump does not understand Europe
@L3Always @UROCKlive1 Truly.  It’s probable that the suppression of the black vote was the key reason for the loss.  Probably some gerrymandering too.	Either way fingers crossed next time.
@JRubinBlogger The daily surprise. One cannot make this stuff up.
@thomaskaine5 White entitlement.  Nothing new, just more blatant
@UROCKlive1 Conservatives didn’t elect trump.	If you look at the data, he was elected by the folks who did not vote and independents.	Conservatives voted conservative.	Dems voteddem.
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons Do you think that trump has brought the population closer together or otherwise?  I’d say otherwise.	Sure he’s a disruptor but he seems to lack a compass morally and strategically
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons When you start your argument as our dear president does most days with a belittling comment then that’s divisive.  If trump had wished for democracy he would have reached acrossthe aisle but he didn’t.	Now of course he has to.
@ProTrumptopia Nonsense
@DeannaDeanna061 Yes.  He has said that more recently.	Immigration should actually be expanded to include the folks who study here but then cannot start their company here.  That sends billions elsewhere.	I believe 1/2 of the hot new companies are created by immigrants
@DeannaDeanna061 April 2016 trump campaign memo calls for Mexico to make a 5-10billion one time payment. Clearly it’s not going to happen.	So your claim that he didn’t actually say Mexico would write a check is semantics.  The trade deal nonsense is a reach
@DeannaDeanna061 Research will show you that’s exactly what he said and variations of it too.
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons You are welcome.  6 kids gives little time for debate
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons He belittles everyone he disagrees with, which is quite a lot of folks.
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons Kind of extreme.  He’s not really interested in anyone else’s ideas and demonstrates that daily.  He belittles almost everyone yet lacks any cohesive strategy other than not that or Obama/Clinton are bad.
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons How is it helpful to be so divisive?
@harjo111 @thotless_me Deep state is a figment of your imagination
@iamthetruth2019 @JaneSepmeier @RagingGayCons How is this president representing everyone rather than the few?
@RandyResist @JaneSepmeier That would be fifth risk!
@gtconway3d @selfhelp5 This ceo would be long gone for multiple reasons.  Incompetence, lies, alternative facts.....
@AdamSchiff @selfhelp5 Insulation is the word here.  Trump and McConnell are insulated from the world they say they represent.	How can you represent everyone when you lack the empathy to feel what they feel when they feel it.	You can’t.
@WRosenbergTX @lfkraus @realDonaldTrump Tsos!
@RandyResist @JaneSepmeier You should read the Michael Lewis book “ the fifty risk” to understand how the red states have no idea how the blue states support their way of life.
@leahmcelrath @fannybisson A subpoena should be able to fix that
@realDonaldTrump Translation...I have no plan
@realDonaldTrump Translation...Comey was unpopular on both sides of the political spectrum.  I fired him as he had figured out i was potentially working with a foreign government.  Comey was doing his job.
@realDonaldTrump Translation..not a single mile of new wall has been placed at the border.
@realDonaldTrump Translation.  Comey was unpopular on both sides of the political spectrum.  Hilary has nothing to do with the above statement but I need to throw in a bright shine object to distract everyone.
@realDonaldTrump Translation .. Flourishing nyt, honest trustworthy fbi opened an investigation into potential Russian puppet president after firing Boy Scout Comey.  I am very afraid as I, my family and campaign staff are guilty of treason.
@debbiesideris How does our dear president intend to make America great again if his only firm if communication is to belittle people?
@realDonaldTrump Sadly Mr President, every time you describe someone as lying,crying, low energy and the rest of your insults you make yourself less.		Your insults are like an unaccepted gift.  You get to keep them which is exactly where they should stay.
@MSNBC @LynnBarnett8 When your scratching your head saying how-on earth did we get here,remember, this guys main accomplishment is to pretend he fires people for incompetence.	Incompetence he has mastered.	He’s  an actor and not a particularly good one at that.
“I never said that Mexico will pay for the wall”	Ministry of truth!!!
@matthewamiller @AndreaHolsomba2 Make you realize that they are really not working in the interests of the population, but rather the masters of the swamp they had previously claimed did not exist.	Sold to the highest bidder even if their flag is not🇺🇸
@MaddowBlog @SnowBiAuthor Rosenstein is not really the hero in this story but he is a brave soldier to stand up to our dear president.	Obstructing the obstructionist.  Poetic!
@MissNyetTrump @HarryPotterMAGE No he’s not.  He’s actually better as he’s totally unelectable.		Get rid of trump and pence cannot win
@BuzzFeedNews Only the best people he said....like most things he says and said...		There seems to be a lack of veracity...
@Franktheshank88 @realDonaldTrump Why is that a surprise?  I think he went through 7800 lies so far so why are we surprised each time he lies anew?
RT @rosskennedy: @realDonaldTrump $2 trillion and counting.  That what you have spent so far increasing the national debt.  $2 trillion whe…
@jentaub @ElastigirlVotes @BetteMidler This would be funny were it not true
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump This really is the epitome of fake news
@aking4news @KimWeinberg8 Go figure!
@realDonaldTrump $2 trillion and counting.  That what you have spent so far increasing the national debt.  $2 trillion when the economy is humming thanks to your predecessors that you and we can never repay.	Yet you obsess on a wall that won’t work.
@BobBrauns @realDonaldTrump Basically a know it all.
@ABC @matthewjdowd Simple first amendment issue.	Are you objecting because she’s a woman, or a Muslim or because you are losing  control?
@thotless_me @realDonaldTrump No sympathy needed
@alexsalvinews @thotless_me He probably didn’t write it
@thotless_me @realDonaldTrump A lot more than lies.  Love the truth
@realDonaldTrump When you write this stuff, are you seeing how many untrue statements you can make in a single tweet?	What’s your current record?
@johnpavlovitz @joycieb66 The woolly mammoths are heading for extinction!	Time to evolve fellow Americans
@realDonaldTrump Have you looked into a career as a comedy or fiction author.  You are very funny.
@realDonaldTrump I’ll be proud to shut down the government said yourself and not in the 3rd person.
@realDonaldTrump Hello!  Hello!  It’s 2019!
@realDonaldTrump When does the winning start?  Getting impatient.
@realDonaldTrump Nonsense!  Seriously no one believed that nonsense!

@mccluretweet @ananavarro Maybe a mixture would be best
@mccluretweet @ananavarro Maybe so.
@waltshaub @MarieBudd6 The consequences will show at the ballot box.  Ultimately the USA lives in the middle of the political spectrum.
@ananavarro She missed her chance 4 years ago.	Time for new leadership
@Marmel @VictoriaVanHor7 What realm is that possibility?
@bennydiego @KimWeinberg8 Time to evolve fellow Americans.  Otherwise  you really are just playing Russian roulette with your health and your financial wellbeing
@thehill @selfhelp5 Why is this a surprise?  Ask anyone who is paying attention!
@realDonaldTrump Clearly you realize you are at the end of the road and need a distraction which you have no chance of delivering.	Deflection towards the Obamas is just desperate, as you know he was a better president than you could ever be.	Honest too!  You should try that.
@realDonaldTrump @Clark2June @JesseBWatters Time to change channels.  Your audience is getting bored of the same biased and factually incorrect drivel you keep spewing out after watching fox.  A change would do you and us some good.
@brucerossbrc @VeritasEver Other nations should really be ashamed of there lack of evolution.	It is time for women to be leaders just as frequently as men with nothing unusual or noteworthy about it.	Respect Iceland!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Blame blame blame.  Seriously!  Man up!  This is your doing!
@TomthunkitsMind @LynnBarnett8 A wall is a deterrent not a full solution.  It should be placed in some parts and frankly it is already.  But to suggest it’s the only solution is ludicrous
@jazzbear09 @thehill @elauv22 I have a number of kids who have add.  I also have 2 kids with dyslexia so I think I’m standing on firm ground here.	The Presidents attention span is measured in nanoseconds which is a definite add trait.
@jazzbear09 @thehill @elauv22 I have 2 kids with dyslexia which of course they did not choose either.
@jazzbear09 @thehill @elauv22 You are right of course.
@thehill @elauv22 ADD is real as evidenced by our dear presidents off topic speeches.
@funder @grinningbamE He’s basically a salesman who has no idea about managing anything
@TomthunkitsMind @boldbizcoach He definitely gets an a+ for effort there!
@CREWcrew @LynnBarnett8 How could that happen....
@BoomalayBoom @WatchingWhatYou Life’s a bitch
@AdamParkhomenko @JaneSepmeier Big Mac zone in the presidential bed
@tommyxtopher @victory1261 I hate her but this is out of context
@ACTBrigitte @gpa70 Kinda like a comfort pony
@realDonaldTrump There is no USAR. Or USAD. Only USA. Act in accordance and you could get your wall or at least border security
@JanetYeaney @amiilu71 @realDonaldTrump Can private citizens build on federal land?
@AaronBlake @DougStolzenber2 Unless he still has the bone spur which would show up easily in an X-ray then there might be a scar from it’s removal even if there are no records in the docs office
It seems fitting that there are so many “acting” cabinet members.
@TeamTrumpKAG @Hippygirl1000 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Congratulations upon visiting the troops.  You should do it more regularly.
@ANTITRUMPMVMT @VictoriaVanHor7 Tight end for a tight end!
@SenSchumer @MKKidWrangler The theat of a shutdown loses effectiveness when a shutdown means relief
@Alexand40818925 @realDonaldTrump He’s not reading of course
@kenvhunt Luckily he only thinks he’s a tyrant in his mind.  Restraints are coming entallyand perhaps physically
@downbytheH2o @DougStolzenber2 @realDonaldTrump Senility means he forgets what he said a minute ago.
@debiowens @ellievan65 The business of Jesus is farfrom the ideal he represented
@realDonaldTrFan @Jesse_values Truthfully you are always alone because self centered folks always are,even in a crowded room.	Perhaps if you were not so mean constantly you might actually have friends!  Novel concept!
@NJViewz @realDonaldTrump Facts! Who needs facts when you have alternative facts!
@Kathie_Walters @realDonaldTrump Are you basing that upon your opinion or the agreements struck in The Hague?
@realDonaldTrump International laws have rules about returning monies confiscated and the interest you must pay
@larhing @realDonaldTrump Might I suggest Gump!
@realDonaldTrump How many of those are by executive order as Mitch McConnell for all his bluster couldn’t get the bill passed?
@CraneLandis @realDonaldTrump History can be a great guide if you can read
@realDonaldTrump How did that wall work out for the Romans?	How about the Welsh?  The French?	I know you like television so turn on the history channel.	Still think a wall is the be all and end all?	Sad!
@MotherJones @larhing Errrr!  Nope!
@tribelaw @fannybisson Nature abhors a vacuum
@OMGno2trump @MTPSU1987 It’s simple really.  The trump organization didn’t have a board meeting for 20 years.  He is clearly not going to start to listen to advisors in the wh either.	Eventually people stop advising
It does feel like the wheels are coming off the trump train
@kaitlancollins @VictoriaVanHor7 @barbarastarrcnn Honorable soldiers can only follow honorable soldiers.  Integrity is key.
@armyWCT @EricLuna1216 Thank you all for making the world a better place.  I’m very grateful for your service.	Never forget!
@marcorubio Chances are about 30 seconds before our dear president tweeted victory someone on Fox News suggested pulling out. Ron Burgundy couldnt have done better.
@realDonaldTrump You must be using some kind of new math.
@realDonaldTrump Your tax returns will no doubt show that or maybe not
@realDonaldTrump History will likely show that is not true
@jaketapper @MarieBudd6 Given that the prior trump organization didn’t have a board meeting for 20 years, why do we think our dear president would start listening now?	They might have prevented trump university, casino, vodka, water....
@ellievan65 @VictoriaVanHor7 Given that these folks run the government via television policy briefings it’s not surprising.  I’m beginning to think our dear president is basically Ron Burgundy.
@coleyworld @PRAYING4MUELLER Because people assume that money means more than it does
@LFC Keep going!
@realDonaldTrump All citizens?  You are hardly a good example of someone who fights for all citizens as you constantly blame only one side.
@McDutchoven @WatchingWhatYou Yet another guy without a soul
@realDonaldTrump Seriously enough.  A wall didn’t work in Hadrians time and won’t work now.		Want to save billions?  Stop visiting your golf clubs and sending your children to vacation on the taxpayers dime.
@realDonaldTrump History shows that walls don’t work.  They didn’t work when there was no technology and they certainly don’t work now.	Time to move into the 21st century Mr President.
@realDonaldTrump Since when did the President of the United States start sounding like a mob boss?
@realDonaldTrump It’s funny or tragic I can’t decide which, how little you understand about the law you are elected to protect.  Mueller however understands the law fully and has skillfully caught each of your Leutenants in unnecessary lies.		All without revealing his true purpose
@Josephsonofthe2 @realDonaldTrump The spin may change but the story remains essentially true
@realDonaldTrump If I recall you said that healthcare would be fixed in 2 weeks.  That of course is like many other promises that slipped from your grasp.	Pushing your failure onto others does not make your failure less, it just means that the reality that your reach is limited will sink in.
@realDonaldTrump Essentially you are accusing the press generally of creating or manufacturing news which is patently untrue.  I realize the stories are uncomfortable for you but or the most part they have an uncanny  knack of being true.  	Perhaps you need to look inwards rather than outwards.
@trumpster93907 @thedaveandrew @realDonaldTrump I think that’s called the prelude to the end game.  Mueller is not showing his best cards, just using tools to flip those who can bolster his case. Seems to be doing pretty well.
@reimann_rob @realDonaldTrump 2
@lancearmstrong Heart failure apparently.  Very sad.  He and Kelly used to show up for the chain Gang ride from the Wirral to Cheshire and back.	Only the elites ever made it all the way round.  Superb rider.
@JennyWhitham Normal day then
@TaubPhilip Well deserved!
@lancearmstrong That’s actually pretty funny
@realDonaldTrump How is this illegal?
@kriswood Stupid
RT @harrismonkey: Guilty want. https://t.co/pt5MGbHdzX
@kriswood @realDonaldTrump very scary man
@jane203405 yo!
