@RagingGayCons I know sevral gay people who go to church they believe in God and understand this.		It is like the gender issue wanting to be called a women, m am, etc, but for Christians we call it a marriage which is a covenant not just a a legal document.
@RagingGayCons As far as just a contract to be joined as a couple under illegal precedent all of the states and law from the United States sure why not more power to them.		The piece of paper that you sign it's not what makes you married your souls being connected together forever as one is

@666_nostradamus @NRA I think communities should come together and stop relying on the police to do everything, take shifts as parents to protect kids at school , get training, have security, not sell to any 18-21 year olds in public school, there's tons of other things besides banning
@666_nostradamus @NRA But once you can establish a ban on one type of weapon then they can establish nitpicking and taking other things out rendering them all useless eventually and this Army everybody except for bad guys and government, that's why there's so much opposition about this issue!
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA Well regulated militia not well regulated people
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA Also the Constitution doesn't grant us Privileges and rights so henceforth your determination is debunked again it protects our natural sovereignty you might try looking all that stuff up if we having a conversation with somebody on an intellectual level
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA Nobody has any right to regulate another human being especially when that human being needs to protect his or herself when your life is at risk! If I point my 45 at you, you have the right to point one back at me!
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.		See the comas these separate statements that are not objective,
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA So now you're trying to interpret unless you're a constitutional attorney such as myself then I'm not going to argue semantics with you
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA Are depending on what state you live in we have laws that are derived by UCC regulations but no laws derived from the common law per state about owning weapons, I can go buy any weapon off any person I know and I don't have to have a license to do so I'm allowed to own a guns
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA Every Supreme Court decision has been turned down in the last 200 years they don't patronize me dude because you think bad guys are going to listen to laws I think that governments are going to be truthful to you because they're not wake up
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA I'll tell you what you go to the ruff area around your closest local city and you go tell all the bad guys there that they have to follow the new laws and see what happens bad guys don't follow laws those who do have a right to protect themselves, even kids
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA There's no limits on what types of weapons we can use go look up the f****** word arms it means armaments and ammunitions doesn't specify what types what kind what are bump stocks AR-15 S8 ends it doesn't matter! Any gun we want is fair game
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA This protects our rights are god-given rights we already have the right to own a weapon whatever we want to protect ourselves if you're trying to come at me and kill me I'm going to use whatever is around me to try to kill you back that's the purpose of this amendment
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA That is the exact definition: verbatim		A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.		We the people are the well regulated militia to oppose a tyrannical goverment
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA There's no limit on what types of weapons we can own to protect ourselves, arms definition. Means armmerments and ammunition! 2A doesn't grant us rights it protects our basic human rights to protect ourselves in anyway seen fit by us Americans
@Thoughtdogbuns1 @NRA You might try reading the definition of the Second Amendment the right to bear arms shall not be infringed! Unbroken valve that protects our basic rights it doesn't grant us rights and protects the right for us to Bear any kind of weapon or gun to protect ourselves no matter!
@666_nostradamus @NRA You tell bad guys not to use guns? You think they will listen so you? You make laws bad guys don't follow laws! And leaving gun to military and police only it's not safe for anyone! The liberal-left lies everyday they want to disarm the American people so they can take them over
@GreveChad @NRA We should be getting our communities together around our schools and taking it upon ourselves as parents to take shifts texting our children with armed services, make kids programs to turn in other kids with guns I mean there's all kinds of ways
@GreveChad @NRA So what you think you could tell bad guys not to have guns and make laws and that they'll listen? or if you just remove every gun on the planet leaving just military and police that no corruption will happen! Are you crazy!
@NRA @donnamoon81146 A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.		Def: Arms , armaments and ammunition 		Infringe:  to violate or break (a law, an agreement, etc)		It is an unbreakable law!
@TheLarsWord @NRA Sorry I missed printed that's what the second amendment protects not grants

@SarahBHoll You want to fight a good fight then tell people to start putting more focus on ports of Entry getting volunteers building campuses to help with clean water, electric, in amenities, translators volunteers to help people fill out 2 forms and come in legally!
@SarahBHoll How is it they can process 3 billion income tax returns every year that they can't process a few thousand people through US Customs every year? The politicians don't want people coming in here legally the black markets provide them with too much oppritunity for $$ and power!
@SarahBHoll This is politically driven and is being paid for by people like George Soros you spend millions of dollars on propaganda  and champagnes here in the US and in countries like Honduras paying off leaders to evict there citizens forcing them to come here against their will!
@SarahBHoll Your not fighting the right argument! Since 1933 when the Fedral reserve took power in our nationalist constitutionally elected Republic with fiat (Fake) currency locking down every market &amp; industry down enslaving Americans who are a Sovereign people.
@SarahBHoll The problem is not as simple as you are mislead o. Social media and mainstream media! Do research and you will find Elites like DNC officials Nancy and Chuck get paid from elite contributors. To traffic humans, used in research, and human trials with pharmicutical corps!
@SarahBHoll 400,000 undocumented people entered our nation which all Americans have to pay! 4000 Americans died at the hands of  these people, people who belive the same as you and not!
@SarahBHoll No you are right people are not illegal! But we live in a nation. When you advocate people not use the port of entry, your allowing bad people which do exist in! Murders, child trafficking and slavery from cartels and gangs. People who make big business, politicians tons of money
