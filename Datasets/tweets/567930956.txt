@MaryLorettaW I will not. Nowhere in the Constitution does the Federal Government get the powers to enforce immigration. Article 1 Section 8 is very specific in its scope.
While we are selectively outraged about In and Out or Nike, we are still watching the debt soar, violent conflicts are still ongoing, and the NSA is collecting our information.		#Priorities
@JennyWilsonUT @MittRomney Don't forget he won't debate either of us outside the Utah Debate Commission on important issues either.
Last day of August. Help us reach our fundraising goals so we can keep fighting! https://t.co/3t5NYiqIlW #utpol #BreakingBarriers #BuildingTheFuture
As much as I disagreed with Sen. McCain on policies, I wish his family peace as they mourn. May we find a cure in our lifetimes.
@dmturner1232 That's a stretch. Anyone can see that I have repeatedly said the rights remain even if I disagee with what they say. I also disagree with Commmunists and socialism. Doesn't mean people can't talk about them. Good ideas don't require force.
@dmturner1232 I'm not trying to stifle their speech. There are plenty of things I think people should not do. However, in terms of laws, if it isn't protecting life, liberty, or property, it shouldn't be law. I was appalled at the baker refusing to serve the gay couple. But it's his right
@dmturner1232 @UtahJazzyman I find it appalling David Duke speaks on policy positions as well as Richard Spencer. The right is maintained in spite of how much I disagree
@dmturner1232 Saying a group should stay out is what is called a dissenting opinion. Just as I think Trump should get off Twitter. In neither instance am I advocatin force be applied to stop. People shouldn't drink, but it isn't my body. See how that works?
@dmturner1232 @UtahJazzyman That is because they are influencing a vote that will uphold a law to place innocent people in jail. Also, a dissenting opinion is not stifling their speech. Seems plenty of news outlets published their words and I'm not advocating a law be passed against them
@JennyWilsonUT @MittRomney He has time. He won't debate because if he does, he might lose some points based on what he says.
@dmturner1232 And when religion is trying to inject its doctrine into law, that is appalling. The libertarian position is that laws should only protect life, liberty, &amp; property. Not be involved in morality legislation.
@dmturner1232 What big government programs? Please point them out.
As a member of the LDS Church, it breaks my heart that I must choose between what they said about medical cannabis and giving people the agency for medical decisions. I hate to be put in this spot, but I must err on the side of agency. I WILL BE VOTING YES ON PROPOSITION 2 #utpol
Was invited to a debate today out in Duchesne on the 23rd. We accepted the invite. @MittRomney has not responded to the city government who is hosting. Hopefully @JennyWilsonUT will attend too.

@kennedymitch12 My opinion is that it should not be able to be done beyond viability of the child. I would also prefer that it only be used in cases of rape, incest, and medical necessity. My biggest thing would be advancing technology to the point the discussion becomes irrelevant
I was recently asked, what is one thing on why you wanted to run for the Senate? Well, to start off, there are over 21 trillion reasons why someone needed to step up. #NoMoreDebt #utpol
One of the most common things asked is "what experience do you have to be Senator?" It's a valid question. I'm a combat veteran from the infantry, a business owner, and national board member of the third largest political party in the United States. #utpol

@rayjaysworld Thank you for your support. Hope to see you when we hit the trail, touring Utah beginning in March.
@tomforutah Taxes do not clean up the air, nor do subsidies. Mandating federal building have solar panels and mandating government buildings/computers shut down at the end of the day does have a real impact.
@tomforutah Subsidizing any business, including current practice of Big Oil, is wrong. And you're talking to someone who doesn't believe taxes as a solution. Govt is the biggest polluter, so downsizing, especially what the military does, would do far more good than assessing another tax
Please join us on March 15th	https://t.co/3iRybeZH6d #utpol #Election2018 #Bowden4Senate
@tomforutah Neither are currently done. This will help lower consumption of coal fuel.
@tomforutah Federally, there isn't a lot we can do, however, one thing I am ready to propose is fitting all federal buildings with solar paneling. A second thing is requiring power down of computers at federal facilities at day's end.
Now is the time to get behind the only fiscally sound candidate in the race for US Senate in Utah. https://t.co/oR4ub9dJcg #utpol

@Dis_CT this gives incentive for people to step up &amp; actually help each other instead of reliance on govt. And increases the impact of the $
@Dis_CT the overhead on government doing it costs about $.30 on every dollar, while charities on average are about .10 overhead
@Dis_CT one plan is a tax rebate for those who donate money to charities that assist people in circumstances like yours. 100% rebate
@ytooooj I think that's a disgusting practice and I would be putting through reforms to make sure it couldn't happen.
@ytooooj I don't blame them for greed. Lots of people will do anything for power. I'd prefer giving the power to you &amp; keep my integrity
@ytooooj and for the record, I have denied special interest money.
@ytooooj Maybe Hillary will get the GDP up past 3% unlike the current administration. I can throw stats too
@ytooooj first, that would be illegal. Second, I'd take the donate to charity path.
This is the main reason I'm #libertarian. The only role of government, if it is to exist, is to protect life/liberty https://t.co/qtk54hJVal

@chnsaw5210 good to meet you too
@LLH713 lastly, it sounds like any other road argument that I've ever heard. Not everyone agrees with the priority order in any state
@LLH713 also, this series of articles points to legislative involvement and multiple departments as well. He was just the signer
@LLH713 the accusation on Koch puppet is stated as inherently false. They donated to a general fund to the RNC, given to many candidates
@LLH713 a WordPress blog? I'll read it, but it better cite sources
@LLH713 I hold the same standards for anyone levying accusations. If they aren't back by reliable evidence, you really going to convince me?
@LLH713 *you're dam auto correct
@LLH713 your welcome to refute the cited sources at the bottom one at a time
@chnsaw5210 they can do that regardless. That's what law enforcement is for
@chnsaw5210 that's a border issue, not refugee issue.
@LLH713 that's how courts work. The accuser has to prove the case. All the defense has to do is show reasonable doubt.
@LLH713 looks like they fall under the Dept of Corrections. 	https://t.co/YhzfqUKr5x
@chnsaw5210 they aren't screening
@LLH713 I'm telling ypu to back up your claims. Proof is the burden of the accuser.
@LLH713 link
@LLH713 both are state run. To get funding from public funds, you have to meet the state standards.
@chnsaw5210 refugees are mostly a non issue. All that's needed is a good screening process
@LLH713 show me the bill. And show me who the wardens reported to. Bet they fall under Dept of Corrections
@LLH713 show me the appropriations bill that forade the governor from housing prisoners
@LLH713 how? Was the money appropriated for use in Dept of Corrections? Yes. Was the funding used to house prisoners? Yes.
@LLH713 ok? And Trump uses eminent domain for business but preaches liberty
@LLH713 checks &amp; balances. He is given the check for the prisons. How he administers funds is up to him as long as it's used as appropriated
@LLH713 what branch controls Dept of Corrections? The executive. Not the legislature. You got things backwards
@LLH713 @chnsaw5210 civil matter. Not criminal. Glad to know where you stand on non violent civil matters though
@chnsaw5210 biggest help we need right now for a peaceful revolution is for people to spread the news of Libertarian candidates.
@chnsaw5210 BLM is only one cog in a giant wheel. And I doubt there will be a hold on elections. Get out and be vocal for liberty
@LLH713 nor anything of a DWI. All I see is that this guy backed up marijuana legalization bills the Gov wanted. Which is expanding liberty
@LLH713 I'm seeing nothing about fraud in that article.
Looking to stop govt from going to war? Check out https://t.co/p1L4E8yoy6. The only party that only believes in defense, not aggression.
@chnsaw5210 that's why I stopped supporting Rs and Ds
@LLH713 which is it?
@LLH713 you just preached to follow the Constitution. Now you're saying he doesn't have the authority to direct an exec dept.
@LLH713 who is the one in charge of all executive departments? The executive.
@LLH713 does the Dept of Corrections fall under the executive? The answer is yes. He does what he needs to w/ the budget the leg gave
@chnsaw5210 I definitely understand that kind of thing. One more reform needed at every level
@LLH713 is the Dept of Corrections not under the executive branch?
@kew9909 I'll follow you back once my ratio allows.
@LLH713 and technically speaking, this is an administration function since he took the funds available and ran the budget better
@LLH713 do you prefer that no one do anything for overcrowding or prisoner injury? Especially considering most are non violent offenders?
@LLH713 my mistake. However, the legislature wouldn't do anything. Best of bad options available as originally stated.
@LLH713 it was passed by the legislature. Government was used
@usa_truth when it comes to liberty, we've been the only consistent advocates (few exceptions in major parties). Since 1972, we have fought
@usa_truth Frank, I know you care too, but don't look at the LP as the bad guy. 1 million votes wouldn't have made a difference in 2012.
@usa_truth look what they did to Ron Paul. The one I definitely would have supported. The one I did support
@usa_truth done voting for the lesser evil that still erodes liberty. Used to be in the RP for a long time. Corruption rampant.
@usa_truth look at the election numbers.
@usa_truth one million votes all going Romney would have still given us Obama. So the blame isn't on Johnson or the LP
@usa_truth that's an old argument used by fear mongers of the two parties. Democrats say the same thing when they lose and we're involved
@usa_truth unfortunately she and he will be. I may have broken party lines for Paul, but that's not the case. I vote without holding my nose
@usa_truth Cruz won't be the nominee and you know it. It's Trump v. Clinton which is a screwing either way. #TryLiberty for a change
@usa_truth and most Libertarian Party voters won't ever vote for either party, so they aren't votes either had to begin with.
@usa_truth actually we take equally from Rs and Ds. Same argument for years. Same scare tactics used by both parties.
@usa_truth who supports raising debt ceilings? Patriot Act? Bailouts? Wars/intervention? Mass incarceration? Govt expansion? Rs &amp; Ds.
@usa_truth I'm not working to screw anyone. You're thinking of the RNC and DNC who have passed countless anti-liberty legislation.
@usa_truth so our choice is Hillary or a Hillary supporter/donor under the R vs D likely nominees. Sounds bad either way you slice it.
@BrendaKaye_USA will have to on this. It's abused far more than you could imagine.
@LLH713 best of bad options available. He also brought surplus to NM, cut the budget, shrunk the size of govt, &amp; vetoed more than any1 else
@BrendaKaye_USA and I know plenty that have been screwed over.
@usa_truth biggest factor: two parties have been screwing the American people. Democrats and Republicans. People are fed up.
@BrendaKaye_USA without it we also wouldn't have homes torn down for business interests.
@usa_truth actually, it would be the millions who didn't do anything. If you think 1 million votes gave Obama the election, you're mistaken
@BrendaKaye_USA would that not be what we do when we disagree?
@BrendaKaye_USA which can be changed and opposed.

@RisingRedStorm I'm not here to argue with you Ben. I will be running. I will stand for my principles.
@RisingRedStorm Entitled to your opinion. I prefer to spend as little as possible. I don't like that money has become so influential.
@RisingRedStorm maybe because my time is spent in the homes of voters talking with them directly instead of running ads.

Today has certainly been a busy day. http://t.co/u9b0YJwJiP
@ChrisDevineMA Thank you. I will. If you have any questions, I'm always an open book.
@ChrisDevineMA Thanks for the tip. Ultimately, I went with the Libertarian Party, but putting that out there would probably help
@watchingfreedom thank you!
@ChrisDevineMA I'm neither.
@RisingRedStorm I am not a Paulbot, and I won't be dropping form the race. Thanks for asking though.
I officially filed to be 1st District's next Congressman. Thank you all for the support so far, and here's to November! #tcot #ctot #tlot
