@realDonaldTrump We own you...You are bought and paid for by the American people. You stand naked before us...I hope global warming kicks in soon buddy.
@realDonaldTrump Who wrote this? This is outside of your 13 word vocabulary and you know it.
@EdKrassen He doesn't need one....His baitch lives in the White House....k?
@DennisMNews @MattGertz My last Trump supporter supporter dumped me...I can't respect her any longer
@SeanMurf215 @DarinJWeeks @MattGertz "You can keep your own doctor."
@enbybelievable @ShaneGoldmacher I'ma steal this one!
@KarenBur51 @realDonaldTrump He doesn't love himself...Pray for him. He is a broken man.
@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump He's not sorry. Please don't encourage him to tell one more lie. Let him do him..
@realDonaldTrump Look Donald Trump! Those brutal dictators rule EVERYTHING! You love them because deep down inside you are them. You are so pitiful that you won't even let them lie for themselves. You lie for them. What is wrong with you? I'ma keep praying for you because Mike Pence is worse.
@MichaelSteele Don't play...You know what's up. We call it....in the hood.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Who wrote this for you?
@realDonaldTrump What if he called you "Stupid Donald" or "Con Man DJT" or "Lyin' Ass Don" or "Ex-con Don" would that be ok? Do you treat people the way you want to be treated?
@realDonaldTrump Nope...just you. They didn't borrow money from the Russians..You did. They didn't help the Russians launder money...you did. What you are doing is called projection...k? Cofefe
@realDonaldTrump An ENEMY like you? Or a different kind?
@BuckSexton She did it all by herself?
@EdKrassen Lessons are always needed. We must always be vigilant. Trump is a product of slavery. How do you think "This great country" will overcome this perpetual system of unfairness? George Bush didn't open the eyes of the privileged...DJT is doing a much better job.
@TheRickWilson For 30 days? 6 weeks? He has privilege.
@goodreads They hold my interest..
@CongressmanHice @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Are you saying that lying matters to a Republican? If he lied and it mattered...he just told the wrong lie. You have no credibility at all. All of  your father's integrity is lost.
@theamazingjeesh @Macros1 @M26HIL @ChrisSamarin @AOC The wages won't allow the people to live where they work...Is that ok? 1/2  of their income will be spent getting to work and the other half on taxes. Is that ok? Oh..what about child care expenses..unless they are hiring a bunch of Medicare recipients. What is wrong with people?
@tconstant1 @siano2020 @AOC When is anyone 100% correct? There are no right or wrong answers in politics. It is about what your beliefs are and who is willing to help you bring them to fruition. Even Jesus had naysayers. Tell me one politician you know to have been 100% correct.
@paulsphillips1 @AOC Is it evil to want everyone to prosper or at least be free from poverty?
@realDonaldTrump You really don't get it...I thought they were making it up :(
@realDonaldTrump Will the real Donald Trump please stand up...Who wrote this?
@SenBobCorker This is awesome! I am inspired!
@realDonaldTrump How is it that everyone around you is lying but you?
@ewarren I have been hoping that you would run since the Obama years however if it is true that you are refusing/ignoring invitations to be on Black radio television&amp; social media programs I cannot support you and I will  make sure that the word is passed on

@realDonaldTrump Mexico already paid for the Obama's wall it was a gift...Your turn
@MrEvilVoice @AOC She can get one letter wrong cofefe 		 The usual past participle of ‚Äúshow‚Äù (that is, the form of the verb used with ‚Äúhad‚Äù or ‚Äúhave‚Äù) is ‚Äúshown.‚Äù But ‚Äúshowed‚Äù is also acceptable and not a mistake.Dec 24, 2007
@goodapplejokes @AOC Please...
@JohnWDean I hope you kept it real simple...
@silvanus39 @realDonaldTrump AND they are getting a pay cut when he gets them back to work...He gonna use dem poor lackeys that voted for him to pay for the tax cuts to his pals...Shhhhh don't tell 'em...he's special!

@CharlesMBlow Why is it shocking to you? Spell out exactly how this should have occured in this country. They are hunkered down into making sure another Barack Obama never ever happens again.
@Peeka_P @adamcbest @MutazElnour Cause he is black??? Black men tend to make white men feel threatened in general (for an example think prisons).
@nancy180 @adamcbest Because he has insulted her family multiple times. She did not care for him at all especially after what he said about Megan Kelly. They said having him there would suck all the air out of the room.
@deezBdadaze @pgoodemote @adamcbest @DearAuntCrabby They are at a funeral-Michelle is not a clown. Barack is doing what he can to make Milania feel comfortable. She is sitting really close to him their arms are touching  there is plenty of space on the other side of her

@CNN Don please ask one of your guess why is the NRA the most powerful lobbying  group in the USA? We as Americans need to drown them out...Today!
@TrumpEra_2017 Oh my...are politicians that sad? He is pitiful.
@VABVOX Where is the list?
@AC360 Can you imagine being treated like a criminal while being traumatized by a shooting? Is there a better/different way? Sadness in America again because of  gun violence.
@AC360 So a depressed or anxious person shouldn't have a weapon? That is too broad of brush to paint with. IMHO let's start with people committed to a psychiatric facility against their will should not be allowed to have a weapon.
