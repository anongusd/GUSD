Isolated tornadoes are also a possibility. 		"Friday and Saturday will be good days to stay inside and catch up on Netflix," @WeatherWes said. "Things start to improve Sunday."
Winds of 39 mph or higher can be expected during the next two days, downing trees and potentially causing power outages. Several inches of rain can be expected, which could lead to isolated flooding.
