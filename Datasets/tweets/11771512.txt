@bmaz @JamilSmith There's a *huge* difference between a subject-matter expert expressing frustration that reporters are only now coming to realize what they've known forever and a rando troll saying "you suck for being surprised by that explosive news development"
This is a super interesting - nearly forensic - look at the relationship between the Green New Deal and Obama's stimulus. If you are interested in the former, check this out. https://t.co/WBOiBG9LDi
@bmaz @JamilSmith Because when I post something I find interesting or important or newsy, and the @ is a scornful "this surprises you? And you call yourself a reporter?" it's pretty aggro.
@jmpalmieri check your DMs, young lady.

@michael_steel @noonanjo agree.

@BalkansBohemia That might be part of it, Fellow old Person! And yes, it was ferocious. Remember the late 1998 wag-the-dog stuff?
@tjkturner @JamilSmith This has nothing to do with reporters being *late* to anything. It has to do with world-weary posturing.
@noonanjo The key to Twitter - I do not say this sarcastically - is to follow a bunch of national parks, so that your stream can be "ok...ok...vitriol...ok...stupid...interesting...ad hominem...whatabout...awwwwwwwwwww beeaaaaarrrrrrrs"
@epicciuto @JimSwiftDC I'm not old enough to have covered DC before that (started in journalism in July 1996), but it's plausible.
@noonanjo Hmmm I'm not *opposed* exactly, but I really think the "and you're surprised?" pose deserves its own class of awful.
@noonanjo That feels like a sub-category more than an addition to that class of tweets, no?

3/3 Johnson joked that if he had become president under those circumstances, it would have been through a personal failure as homeland security secretary to secure the events.
2/3 the "undisclosed location" is different for those two events. And Johnson noted that he served until John Kelly was sworn in as his successor, meaning he was technically the first member of Trump's cabinet, and the first to resign.

@JerylBier Correct read.
Now senior Trump economic adviser Kudlow is asked whether the White House supports getting back "shutdown" pay to government contractors? "I’m not sure, I’m not an expert on that," he says. "I’d have to take a look at the scope of it, but I don’t know."
@sarailola Sometimes one discloses a true thing for tactical effect.
(Last bit seems pretty tactical: effectively inviting Maduro to be suspicious of top Venezuelan brass)
What about Venezuelan military's relationship w/ Maduro govt? Bolton says "rank and file" are acutely aware of chaos, "look for ways to support" Maduro's rival, same with junior/mid-level officers, &amp; claims "significant contacts” betw top officers and supporters of Maduro's rival
@LbbLaura agree
@JerylBier There are definite variations. "We believe in a diplomatic solution to this crisis blah blah blah" putting (sometimes very heavy) emphasis on non-mil options before saying the options are there.
Announcing sanctions on Venezuelan state-run oil firm, Maduro govt, Treasury Seceretary Mnuchin says "I don't expect" an impact at the gas pump in the US, predicts Middle East will pick up production in response.
National security adviser Bolton does not rule out US military action in Venezuela - "all options are on the table" - and says "stability and democracy in Venezuela" are in "direct" US national interest.
@taylordobbs She spoke too quickly for me to get it right, but one of the agencies supposedly after me had a name like "The Department of Enforcement." Which sounds badass.
She emphasized "you are on a recorded line." Me: Good, I'm recording too! (I'm not). [Long pause]. She tells me I'm in trouble. I tell her that would be surprising since the info she has is fake. The conversation...ends. [End]
What bank? ("[BS answer]") What's the balance in my account? She reminds me I need to be truthful or I will get in trouble. I tell her I'm not comfortable telling her. She warns me that I am in a lot of trouble and she can't help me without more information.
I could be in very serious trouble, she says. Do I own bank accounts in Texas? ("No.") Have I ever given out my Social Security number over the phone? ("No.") How many bank accounts do I own where I live? ("One.")
There are, she says, 7 allegations against me and in my file. Someone with my name and Social Security number owns 25 bank accounts in Texas, with a total balance of $10,000,000. "The authorities" have found ties to money laundering and drug trafficking.
She informs me "I have your file in front of me" and tells me that "there are seven arrest warrants issued in your name." (Oh dear!). Tells me that I must “be specific and honest” in my answers or I will be in trouble with four govt departments.
Operator asks for my first and last name. I gave fakes. Asks for last four digits of my Social Security number. Fakes again. She identifies herself as "Kalli" and says her "badge number" is 417J2741.
So I got the same scam call today. But from (800( 772-1298. This time, I opted to press "1" to find out what this was.

@ajhoward121 The recognition?
One challenge: Maduro's play will probably be to portray Guaido as a US puppet. How will the Trump Admin avoid giving him ammo on that score?
Couple of things to watch for: Reactions from other countries in the region. Maduro response to protests and Guaido declaring himself interim president. US messaging *to* the region. US-Colombia communications.
Bolton may have gotten it over the finish line, but the hard line was there at the start. Remember Aug 2017, when POTUS talked about a possible military option? https://t.co/ncJCYK3cQc
(As a recovering Latin Americanist, I find this to be bigger news than the willtheywon'tthey of State of the Union.)

My understanding after a couple of conversations is that, to the degree that a co-del wasn't going to rely on military transportation/assistance - if a lawmaker were going to, I dunno, Japan - that can proceed.
OK, so, thus far we have no announced changes to the Davos travel by several members of Trump's cabinet (could of course change). As for other co-dels, any co-dels that rely on military air travel are "postponed," source says.
Editor's note: The House Speaker is *second* in line for the presidency, not *third* in line. First in line is VP. POTUS is not in line.
@bullpen34 Too close to the headlines. Tempers, and all that.
Someday, Twitter, but not today, Twitter, remind me to tell you the story of what happens when someone other than the president reveals that the House Speaker is going to a war zone.
Congressional source texts: "Now, according to the rules of our simulation, there will be a tweet from a shaving company about the shutdown."
I have now asked the White House whether all co-dels are canceled or just Pelosi's, and how the Cabinet members attending Davos will get to Switzerland.
@petersongeorged He specified air travel, which he would control

Oh. @TerryMoran asks Trump whether he has considered declaring a national emergency and building the wall without Congressional buy-in. Trump says he has. Adds: "I may do it. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly." Adds he'd prefer a “negotiated process.”
This is a pretty fascinating bit from Trump about eminent domain, prompted by @AprilDRyan's question about how that affects the Mexico border wall.
@35start I smell politics in your future, Ken.
Readers draw a lot of bad conclusions. https://t.co/1rlWtlYane
(1. USMCA isn't law yet. 2. Let's say it's ratified, trade booms and this results in more tax revenues - enough to fund this construction. Congress would still have to direct that $ towards the wall. Which...if they were on board, we wouldn't have this partial shutdown).
Well, @hunterw gamely tried to get Trump to explain his very curious claims that the USMCA (new NAFTA) will pay (or is paying) for the wall. Trump says again that "what we save" from that deal will pay for the wall. This makes no sense.
Arguably a lesson the GOP learned in 1998. https://t.co/gD0bTcmjZf
Trump says Pelosi told him today: "We're not looking to impeach you." Let's see what her office says, but tracks broadly with her public comments (which boil down to "let's see what Mueller has or does not have.")
Another follow-up on DACA. Trump says it's "gonna be a great subject, I look forward to discussing it," envisions "great things" if Democrats cooperate and Supreme Court nukes it. Not showing any leg on how it factors into current shutdown talks.
Follow-up from @esaagar about the context of the DACA part of the negotiation today with Pelosi/Schumer, Trump gives long recitation ending with speculation Supreme Court will nuke DACA, setting up possible deal, and: "The Democrats want that and so do we."
Ah. Asked by @colvinj whether DACA was part of the negotiations at the White House today, Trump replies: "Yeah." (Does not elaborate).
Trump rejects Pelosi/Schumer push to reopen the govt and *then* negotiate. "We won't be opening until it's solved," the president says.

So the Syria withdrawal, and this potential Afghanistan draw-down, will be managed by Mattis, who certainly opposed the former and most likely opposes the latter. And departure in February means House Dems could have him testify.
Parsing the Mattis resignation letter. What does "these" in "these and other subjects" refer to? Just allies? Allies plus China/Russia?
Confirmation process - always an opportunity to drill down on policy - is going to be interesting, given GOP anger at the Syria decision.

@joan_mediator Thank you!
Cheney made another big overseas trip in March 2008 (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc). I was on that one, too. As we sat down for the end-of-trip briefing, I said it had to be on the record. He agreed, noting he had taken "a lot of, frankly, crap" for the background briefing. /END
(btw, if you want to see how dumb/nuts this was, here's the transcript: https://t.co/qB78M9C9H4)
Reporters *not* bound by the agreement filed stories outing Cheney (here, via @froomkin, is an account of this whole silly episode https://t.co/FIrNOuX8Cf). But wait! There's more!
the entire traveling press attended. I can't speak to whether everyone filed. How did Cheney -- sorry, the "senior administration official" -- start this briefing? "The reason the President wanted me to come..." The entire briefing was full of "I" "me" "my"
that it would be "on background" - meaning that we would only be able to attribute his comments to a "senior administration official." We argued with them. They did not budge. We had to make two decisions: Attend or not? File a piece or not?
The trip started out as Japan-Guam-Sydney. In Sydney, they added stops in Pakistan and Afghanistan. (I'm simplifying how this works). Flying out of Afghanistan, towards Oman, Cheney press staff told the traveling press that we'd get a q-and-a with Cheney BUT
Despite a total lack of popular demand, I will tell this story now, in abbreviated form. Scene: Air Force Two (a C-17 flying out of Afghanistan). Players: then-Vice President Dick Cheney, exhausted traveling press, exhausted Cheney staff. https://t.co/2gre2dbuYt

@WeeLaura I've been humming a certain Beatles tune this morning.
@DavidMDrucker Well sure, if you meant "pays" in that sense. I'm curious about the breakdown between the traditional econ theory (tariff costs get passed on as higher prices to consumers) and not-that.
Except, as the tweet after that one was meant to show, not always. https://t.co/Y8qWvsEgIu
One other point that's easy to overlook: If you're raking in cash from a tariff, that tariff is *failing* - at least for now, the product you're targeting is *still* at least as attractive to consumers as its domestic competitors (barring an overall shortage, I guess)
(For example: Harley-Davidson said when it announced it was moving production overseas that it could *not* pass along the thousands of dollars in additional cost resulting from tariffs to consumers.)

Everyone is pointing out "unless extended," and "I am a Tariff Man," and fair enough. But what I would like to read is a comprehensive assessment of just who is paying the tariffs on Chinese goods. Typically, you'd see the cost passed on to consumers. Is that happening here? https://t.co/GPnNfy5l5q

So I had @b_fung on the show yesterday to talk about potential regulator interest in looking at videogame "loot boxes." Came home, mentioned to Nibbles, and he knew *alllll* about it. Interesting experience.
@ericdemamp No, I've opted out of buying that. Dislike the concept, early reviews were instructive, too.

Kudlow also says the new NAFTA - USMCA - will be signed in Buenos Aires, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit. Approval by Congress is still up in the air.
White House top economic adviser Kudlow says Trump administration will be "looking at certain subsidies" for electric cars to see whether they'll stay "or not." This is curious. One reason GM is closing some plants is lack of US appetite for them.
Full diplomatic plate. Ahead of those meetings, senior US officials rattling sabers - if no trade deal with Xi, US tariffs on a 200 billion dollars in Chinese products, for example, could go from 10% to 25%. And new tariffs on another $270B in Chinese products. https://t.co/RPsPvbYML5
