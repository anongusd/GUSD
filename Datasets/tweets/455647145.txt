# NBSMorningBreeze Hon. Muwanga you are presenting statistics of 95% of Ugandans don't support amendment. But they sent you to consult your constituent. But where you busy consulting the whole Uganda? Liar

@Bigpunchx7 @nbstv What is your basis for lying when they have majority MPs who consulted their people while opposition was just causing  chaos in the city?
@nbstv I think Muwanga Kivumbi &amp; his friend s are the flop of MPs instead of persuading other members they chose to be hooligans in parliament now they are realising it is already dawn for reality
NBSMorningBreeze Muwanga Kivumbi is just an alarmist opposition are so thin on ground that they didn't even reach 20% of population now he is on air boasting 99% of Ugandans don't support amendment.
#NBSMorningBreeze what Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi is a day dreamer he is floating un supported information that 99% of Ugandans support Togikwatako. What does he base his argument? Liar

@KCCAUG @KCCAED Again at Nabulagala rd this road handles over flow from Hoima rd but taxis decided to make it a one way rd &amp; created a taxi park in the middle of the road yet again no one is bothered to control them thus jam in morning. Who is responsible??
@KCCAUG @KCCAED Again at Lugala junction in the morning taxis make Sentema rd a one way they park &amp;road in the middle of the road. So unnecessary jam. Can some one control them please
@KCCAUG @KCCAED. Kasubi Masiro road taxis &amp; bodabodas blocked  3/4 of the road &amp; made it a loading park to Mulago and to Masanafu. At Kasubi junction again bodas blocked Kimera rd from Kikoni but no one is bothered. So endless jam at junction. Really!!
@KCCAUG @KCCAED @UNRA_UG We appreciate for job well done on road net work of Kampala but I urge you to control the lawlessness bodas bodas and taxis. Kasubi junction is a jam spot at wee hours. Boda bodas blocked Kimera rd at Kasubi junction but no one bothers to remove them
@KCCAUG @KCCAED @MakerereU The new Makerere road leading out of the main gate has been already completely blocked by loading taxis and boda bodas. Seriously they are not only sight polution they are a menace. Can some one control them and put them to order?
@greisaine @KCCAUG @like_a_gem @MakerereU @KCCAED Doesn't matter what matters is work well done .There was a lot of work to be done on this road and it was not closed off. So a lot of inconvenience.
@KCCAUG @kabalegau @MakerereU @KCCAED This is incredible work well done but KCCA must stop neglecting a follow up of their project s Right now 1/2 the road has been blocked by parking taxis and boda bodas &amp; no one seems to care to bring them to order

@alfbyaru @nbstv How true is this information? Because the lawyers are quoted as if they have not reported yet. We have professional police

@alfbyaru @nbstv When I suspect does it mean you have information? Didn't we hear Mabirizi was abducted. Was he really abducted? SUSPECT no
@alfbyaru @nbstv When asked if they have reported to police the lawyers said no. This speaks volumes. Can't it cause suspicion? Why not?
@alfbyaru @nbstv But trust our police will investigate and come to conclusion. All those who did it will be arrested.
