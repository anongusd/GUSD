@thehachland @DineshDSouza "If I can't see the earth then it can't possibly be round" easily converts to "if I didn't see him molest all those girls then he couldn't have possibly molested all those girls"
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Last question:		Just because you've never actually SEEN a vagina, does that mean you doubt their existence as well?
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Like I said, they're a big problem where I'm from on the 90 degree angle at the edge of the earth
@thehachland @DineshDSouza You're pathetic
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Congrats on the Google search
@thehachland I didn't need to go there to confirm theire existence. It was a vacation retard
@thehachland @DineshDSouza I recommend you seek help dude. Seriously, life will improve for you if you get the proper medication. It's possible a "well-rounded" (pun intended) education would also do you good
@thehachland Dang! You got me. I'm not willing to go to outer space to confirm the earth is round for my personal satisfaction.
@thehachland @DineshDSouza What exactly does that have to do with it? Do you not believe that anything exists that you can't see from your parents basement?
@thehachland @DineshDSouza I have actually
@thehachland Lol okay buddy
@thehachland @DineshDSouza There is simply the fact that the earth is round. When it was only a theory it was originally proposed by a Greek mathematician
@thehachland Therefore there is no such thing as a "round earth theory" as you suggested.
@thehachland Well shit. You really are simple. Let me explain. 		1. The Catholic Church did not start "the round earth theory."		2. A theory becomes a fact after it has been proven.
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Also it's not called a theory when something has been proven. It's called a fact.
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Sorry but that's false
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Honestly man I figured you would believe in those things based on the fact you believe the earth is flat.
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Correct
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Wtf does that have to do with it? If a tree falls in the forest and a thousand people hear it, but you don't, did it make a sound? You're fucking mentally insane
@thehachland @DineshDSouza If you believe the earth is flat and you're not on serious drugs then your life must be really fucked up and I am sorry about that but until you see clear logic and recognize concrete evidence, it will not get any easier for you...
@thehachland @DineshDSouza FUUUUCCCCKKKKKK YOURE RIGHT!!! The earth must be FLAT! Thanks for enlightening me !!!!
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Yes. I've also looked up at the moon. Ever seen it? It's that round thing that pops up every night when that round orange thing goes away
@thehachland @DineshDSouza Yes. Tomorrow go outside and watch the movement of your shadow in the Sun as time passes.
@thehachland @DineshDSouza I honestly feel bad for you.
@thehachland @DineshDSouza You don't believe the earth is round. I win.

Discovering motive (I.e. $17million in Russian money from a Russian Oligarch linked to Putin) is relevant to an investigation of Russian interference when the man laundering the 17M was the head of the campaign.
@FamilyTrumpGolf @subschneider @njdeplorable31 @Stevenehumphrey @jafreder3 @carolyn_heising @mitchellvii Yes this must be the case. I'm curious what were the charges against the Podestas again?

@njdeplorable31 @FamilyTrumpGolf @subschneider @Stevenehumphrey @jafreder3 @carolyn_heising @mitchellvii It's stated in his plea agreement. If you can read then the information is available to you. He is a "cooperating witness" in an investigation that includes potential obstruction of Justice against POTUS. He is not cooperating in any investigations of Obama since there are none..
@njdeplorable31 @FamilyTrumpGolf @subschneider @Stevenehumphrey @jafreder3 @carolyn_heising @mitchellvii This is a pathetic deflection. He was fired by the Obama administration, that later informed the Trump administration not to hire him. They did and were forced to fire him too. Now he has pleaded guilty to federal crimes.
@FamilyTrumpGolf @njdeplorable31 @subschneider @Stevenehumphrey @jafreder3 @carolyn_heising @mitchellvii I guess you haven't read the plea agreement
@FamilyTrumpGolf @njdeplorable31 @subschneider @Stevenehumphrey @jafreder3 @carolyn_heising @mitchellvii It's called a "plea deal" and the agreement has been made public. I recommend you read it.
@FamilyTrumpGolf @njdeplorable31 @subschneider @Stevenehumphrey @jafreder3 @carolyn_heising @mitchellvii This actually is really simple, you just still don't understand. He wasn't charged with violating the Logan Act because he has turned federal witness against the administration...

@SirJonSimpson @raook1962 @mitchellvii Watch her attorney's statement. She said they are "willing to submit the yearbook to the Senate for 3rd party analysis" if Moore is willing to go under oath as part of a hearing. His accusors is willing to testify under oath and penalty of perjury. He's not.

@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 All meetings detailed in the dossier took place prior to the election and yes it is still illegal (Logan Act) to discuss policy prior to the Inauguration
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 The dossier revealed these meetings which all Trump associates denied. The dossier also alleges what was taking place at those meetings, which would be illegal but is yet to be confirmed (at least publicly but Mueller may already know since Papodopolous is cooperating).
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Are you kidding? Have you watched the congressional hearings?
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Keep denying facts put right in front of your face. Truly dissapointing from a fellow Georgetown Alumni
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Ok be ignorant
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Without the context of conversations taking place at those meetings it's impossible to know whether crimes took place. Why all the lying if everything was innocent?
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Majority of those fake stories were originating in St Petersburg at the "Internet Research Agency" aka the Russian troll farm. So I would say it's highly likely they had a significant impact on voters
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Correct. You said they were not affected. The fact is that nobody can say either way. We'll likely never know but I can tell you for a fact I know individuals who were dissuaded from voting Hillary bc of clearly false conspiracy theories (I.e. Pizzagate, etc.)
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Where would you like me to begin? I can name several. Carter Page and his contact in London, Eric Prince meeting in Seychelles w/Putin linked fund manager, hookers at the Ritz (confirmed by Shilling) Can you detail one part of the dossier that has been confirmed to be false?
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 Without interviewing the 145+ million Americans exposed to fake news from Kremlin backed FB and Twitter accounts, how can anybody definitively say that no votes or opinions were changed due to that exposure?
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 "....it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion."
@Gav4955 @DennisLittle19 "We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze....
