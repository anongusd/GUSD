@DougMoormann @GovMikeDeWine It’s regressive and impacts disproportionately working class families who often have longer commutes because their income can’t always support living close to work. An increase is more impactful on someone making $15 an hour than someone making 250k per year
If Mike DeWine wants to fix Ohio’s infrastructure he should have the political courage to tax the mega wealthy before he tries to raise taxes on working families. A gas tax is proportionally levied on the backs of everyday people and inherently unfair! #APforum2019

Every federal elected official, from POTUS down to Congress, should forego their salary until the hundreds of thousands of patriotic public servants who aren’t getting paid at Christmas get a paycheck. 		Most of them are pretty rich anyway, but this is one way to make this real.

Maybe if John Kasich spent less time in New Hampshire stuff like this wouldn’t happen. 		We are ranked 33rd in job growth for a reason and part of it is we’ve had a governor who seems to spend more time with Chuck Todd than he does with Ohio workers. https://t.co/GlVk6oPajs

@plunderbund Does demanding problem solving = resisting?
@JohnKasich @thehonorablecsc You know that you are still the Governor of Ohio and we have a crippling opioid crisis, right?
We need to compete in every state. Democrats can and will win in the heartland. Sherrod Brown won by 6 a week ago. We lost by 4 points statewide. That’s not a blowout.

@MalloryInPink They are probably out there. We had GOP trackers at almost every event and they uploaded all of it. Of course we remember that when Dr King was killed in Memphis he was there supporting AFSCME workers who were killed on the job. Labor has long led in the fight for racial justice.

I especially spent a lot of time around @LValentineOH and her manager @SpencerDirrig - they both fought the good fight against a guy who literally is at the center of a charter scandal that has caused lots of harm for our schools. Great effort by team Valentine.
Another great experience was running alongside some amazing women candidates Tuesday. Within our district, we flipped seats for @Liston4Ohio Allison Russo &amp; Mary Lightbody while @LValentineOH ran very close in a tough district &amp; Kathleen Tate improved our numbers in HD67 from ‘16
@birkirstin @ohjohnrussell Thank you! We were honored to win every county in our primary &amp; receive 155k votes which would have flipped all but a few seats that we flipped Tuesday. Grassroots campaigns are the way of the future. Excited to see how folks like @StopBigMoney continue to fight as well!
@LarcyRaLosa Also, I think we still have some Dannycrat shirts! @AnneEllisonn -	Do we?
@LarcyRaLosa Our local and state party did a great job. And the activists were amazing. We needed tv help from the natl party and they never stepped in. Even when it was tied and Trump’s pac came in with a million bucks, the help never came. Compare that to other districts and it’s baffling!
@Esz1257 That would be great actually. And needs to happen.
Both. I certainly don’t feel like it’s a wave year when you lose ground in a chamber! If we think we are in good shape going into 20, we are wrong. We have a lot of work to do.
@amjaros I agree. Though we were proud that we cut some serious margins in rural areas. We had a chance to win when we tied the race up - but the outside money came in hard against us and our national party didn’t step up the way our activist base always did.
@missk8_OSU Thank you!!! I will be fighting! Am I still going even though I turned 32 the other day??
@TrishMayhorn1 I didn’t see that coming!
By the way, running to serve #oh12 was so much fun I don’t know why anyone is asking me if I’m ok. I’m so grateful. More than anything I will miss taking breaks during the day by playing hoops in our office. I came on strong with my jumper at the end!
What do we think, folks? What can we do better in Ohio? Nationally? I know we wanted a wave but it didn’t quite live up to the wave level of 2010 and 1994. Our #oh12 team is proud we cut the Trump margin by 7 while outside spending was 6-1 agains us, but know we could do more! https://t.co/iloJLsPau9
@SJWDefense @politico I wish you woulda tweeted this earlier. Given that you are in Ann Arbor, *ichigan, you opposing me would have put me over the finish line! Go Bucks!
@GreenleeGazette @RichCordray Can I use the term ‘blue current’ when people ask me about the election? Thanks for your support!
@PrplePaisley It will be ok! The sun keeps coming up!
@chucknboop Thank you!!!!
@Denison_Repubs Very nice of you to say. Hope that even though we are on the opposite side of the issues, that you all stay engaged in politics in the future!
@RichCordray Same city as the UMW.
Another day, another heartbreak, this time in California. Praying hard for the victims and their families. Hoping that we see action ASAP against this scourge.
The best team! https://t.co/a5IoUqgZWy

I’m glad @joingles brought up the issue of bipartisanship. We need new leadership in both parties in Washington. Democrats and Republicans must find common ground — I will do that. Heck, I am engaged to a Republican! #OH12
The issue of health care is personal to me. My mom survived breast cancer because she had access to the health care she needed. It ticks me off that some leaders in Columbus and DC want to take health care away from millions of Americans. #OH12 https://t.co/E06daLGLZs
I support Governor Kasich’s expansion of Medicaid and I agree with the governor that giving 83% of a tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent showed the wrong priorities. Those are two major differences in this race. #OH12
I will not raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare. Washington’s $1.9 trillion tax cut helped big corporations and the wealthiest Americans. We need middle class tax cuts that are permanent. #OH12
Communities like New Albany have been hurt because politicians at the Statehouse have starved the local government fund. Meanwhile, Paul Ryan and others in DC put trillions of dollars on America’s credit card. We need new leadership. #OH12

Families are the fabric of the heartland. They’re the fabric of our COUNTRY. We must do everything we can to act now and #KeepFamiliesTogether. 4/4
It shouldn’t take guts to speak out against this disgraceful policy. And Gov @JohnKasich is right. What’s happening at the border is SHAMEFUL and it must stop. This isn’t who we are. Not in America, not in Ohio. 3/
.@Troy_Balderson’s silence on this issue speaks volumes about his character. I know Donald Trump won OH-12 by 11 points. THAT. DOESN'T. MATTER. We’re talking about families. We’re talking about children. Even INFANTS. 2/
I DON’T CARE what party you’re in or what part of the country you’re from. Ripping children away from their mothers and fathers at the border is WRONG. It’s DISGUSTING and it’s morally repugnant. 1/ https://t.co/nQLGHtyy5g

.@IvankaTrump talks about pay equity. Yet republicans like .@robportman have opposed pay equity time and time again #equalpay #RNCinCLE

Ted Cruz just got treated like a Michigan fan in Columbus by his own party. #RNCinCLE #fractured #booo #pleaseleaveohiocruz
I think .@tedcruz has a flight to catch to Iowa after this speech. Those poor Hawkeyes won't know what hit them.
.@tedcruz believes in your freedom - unless you are a woman who seeks the right to choose or LGBT who seeks the right to marry. #RNCinCLE
.@BegenyforOhio @jenhouse @tedcruz 		Joe, hearing the GOP message shows us why we need to send you to the statehouse!!!
@jacobmanser it will be over soon. Someday, when we wake up, Ted Cruz will no longer be in the buckeye state.
@bobwsyx6 yet the weapons used in that attack are weapons Cruz fights tooth and nail to keep legal #banassaultweapons
@tedcruz can pay lip service all he wants about violence, but he will never do a thing about banning murderous assault weapons #RNCinCLE
No ted Cruz, you cannot use @KingJames in your speech. Go away. Ohio doesnt share your 'values' #RNCinCLE #BetterThanThis #GoCavs
@GovWalker 17th place is about right for someone who thinks teachers should be paid pennies.
