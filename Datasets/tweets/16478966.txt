Yes, we‚Äôre ready. People don‚Äôt always use their imagination when answering polling questions. They may give reflexive answers that do not reflect what they are truly willing to accept. And all polls are biased.
@jimmy_dore @MostlyEnds Let me rephrase. Temporary unpopularity is acceptable in the arc of #leadership. It is almost inevitable that great leaders will experience unpopularity at some point. Nancy will become more popular ... and it will cast a different light on everything you ‚Äúknow‚Äù about her.
@JohnnyArgent @jimmy_dore @matt_erion We need change soon, and now we can get it with Nancy at the helm for two more years, where she belongs. She deserves her success. Stop accepting GOP talking points about her. She may well be our new president when Trump and Pence go.
@jimmy_dore @MostlyEnds Popularity, by itself? It‚Äôs not always an arbiter of political success, nor a requirement for good leadership. Nancy‚Äôs good at her job. She raised millions for Dems running in the midterms. She delivered the #BlueWave. She ushered in a new health care system. Don‚Äôt be ungrateful.

But getting your information taken off of @whitepages takes about six weeks through DeleteMe, far longer than any of the other third-party sites. And if you try your own hand at having info removed from @whitepages, you will be stymied at every turn. Why? https://t.co/0845e3BKDh
This is an ad for @abine, the online privacy company whose DeleteMe service scrubs your personal information from third-party sites like @peoplefinders &amp; @BeenVerified. Pay $129 per year as an individual, and DeleteMe will keep your information out of easy reach. Do it.
