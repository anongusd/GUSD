@sistertoldjah per NandO  https://t.co/yvpOQoHzLy
@sistertoldjah Bartlett says his NCSBE  wanted to investigate Bladen in the past, but couldn't get law enforcement- SBI or AG- to investigate. Riiight. Although it would be difficult to get local gov folk to investigate a PAC that they run.
Lack of funding didn't create election fraud.  Lack of funding can create unintentional consequences, but it doesn't create inept or illegal actions.
@ronnieglassberg Just because the NCSBE didn't investigate the raised concerns in the past doesn't mean it didn't happen.
@ronnieglassberg Actually, not sure if we truly know about past efforts.  You are correct on that detail, though. However, the 'assumption' the woman made may indicate that ballot harvesting- which is illegal whether or not the envelope is sealed- may have been done in the past by BCIA.

@jaketapper @DrewGriffinCNN @TheLeadCNN The county in which this happened has a Dem backed group that has been under investigation for several years.  It is a local PAC funded by the state party. PAC leadership had been county electeds.  It is a local corruption issue.
@ReubenJones1 @SpecNewsCLT Does a ballot not making it back mean that it was stolen? Couldn't it also mean the 'voter' never returned it? Or the distributor of the ballot never collected?

Cooper won by a very, small percentage. We heard that the people had spoken and given him a mandate. Yet 55% on an amendment isn't a high enough standard?
What is 'voter education?' It seems that to many it means 'knowing how to get a ballot.' To others it means 'learning about issues, viewpoints, candidates, and basic laws.'  In my view, every right has a responsibility. Does 50% of reg voters indicate the latter?
Is the goal 'speed voting?'  Is the goal 'as many votes possible?'  Is the goal 'a secure process to protect eligible votes?'

@sistertoldjah Let us suppose that Kavanaugh withdraws.  Will the Leahy and Hirono commit today that they will seek impeachment to remove the vile man from the bench on which he currently sits? Or are they only concerned about him as a USSC justice?

Can't take Durbin seriously when he declares Booker an honest politician.
So, Durbin sics the dogs on a private individual in order to tank a SCOTUS nominee.  Seems like typical behavior.
Whitehouse:  "Because I don't accept rules, I won't follow the rules."  I had a small battle with my 5 year old this morning over the same argument.
Didn't Booker donate to the Menendez legal defense fund?
I wish Grassley would stop feeling defensive.  Just let Booker complain and then get the hearing started. Stay focused.  It doesn't matter if you hand-delivered every piece of paper from the National Archives, obstructionists will obstruct.

@PoliticalShort @SaraCarterDC @PeteKalinerThis is an interesting thread.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows I am not defending Trump integrity.  To me, this memo is about the FISA process and the motivation of the dossier.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows I'll read it.  If it deals with substance I will give it consideration.  If Schiff or Lieu wrote it, I'll not put much stock in it.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Ok. Discount all the info in the memo. All of it.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Other than a generic objection, what did Wray point to as inaccurate?  He can't point to accuracy or inaccuracy because of ongoing investigations.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Correct.  Unless the info is backed up by sworn testimony- like the McCabe testimony.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Wray hasn't said anything that debunks the info in the memo. Not saying Wray is dishonorable or has conflicts of interest, like some others seem to have been. He cannot divulge info, but he hasn't said the memo is inaccurate.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows What in the memo is inaccurate?? Since what we know of the FISA app is in the memo. What in the memo is inaccurate?
@HARRISFAULKNER And you know this is true because Yahoo News said so!  After all, Yahoo News was used to corroborate info in the Steele dossier.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Again, if there was enough then why was the dossier submitted as evidence? We need to see the warrant application. Until then, I'll take @RepMarkMeadows word over Schiff, Lieu, Holder, and Shumer.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Sure, I don't have all the information.  I would hope that if a judge was told that a political document was partially the reason for the FISA app, the judge would say, "get other sources and dump the political doc.'.
@MattWalshBlog Back in the day, that was called 'stretching.' Is Matt also listening to mind-opening sitar music while trying to memorize Scripture?
RT @MattWalshBlog: Yeah but you gotta admit my form is pretty good https://t.co/t6alkINr9p
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows Even if there were enough leads from the dossier to support a FISA, why even use the politically born document in the application? Seems that political research would undermine the cause.  McCabe was under oath.
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows That is funny!
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows Hmm.  The October surprise was certainly mitigated by political interference by political appointees at the DOJ.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI Big deal.  Former AG Holder was also promoted under GOP leadership. He was a hack.
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows Oppo research is one thing.  Fabrication is something else.  How much of the 'dossier' could the FBI verify, without using sources that sourced Steele?? I understand why Page is important to the collusion narrative. But Uranium One could be, too. So could HRC Fnd pay to play
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows Nope. And we dont't what the FBI wanted out of the memo.

These are connections that we do know, and seem problemati

@costareports What attack??  Is pointing out that an FBI investigator's spouse was working for the firm that was supplying his office with unverifiable information an 'attack'?
@chris_allman The Ohr angle seems like a problem for FBI.
@chris_allman It is also interesting to note that a noted 'we get Dems elected' law firm is in the middle of the dossier work.
@chris_allman Nothing can be done.  It is interesting, though when you see the same investigators that 'handled' the HRC email investigation, were also initially in on this investigation.
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows I'm with you that all of the supporting info needs to be released in order to truly understand what went on.
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows But the memo was to discredit the 'dossier' that could not be verified. It is vital to see the application for the FISA.  That won't happen until the Page issue is over. Hard to trust the same investigators that handled the HRC email investigation.
@sternosu @RepMarkMeadows McCabe testified under oath that the FISA would not have been sought without the dossier. The only apparent verification of the dossier was found in news pieces that sourced Steele.
@opus163 @BelieveKC87 @RepMarkMeadows Hmm.  The loudest Dems barking about their 'memo' admitted to not reading the Nunes memo. Schiff has a proven record of fabricating leaks. Why trust his memo??
@lefty_old @RepMarkMeadows Correct. Did you see the part of the memo that pointed out that McCabe testified under oath that  the FISA wiretap wouldn't have been sought without the dossier??

@jkempcpa I'm also reading about the behavior of the law enforcement folks and other upstanding gov agents that handled the IRS, VA, Clinton investigations. Acting in a partisan manner with a FISA warrant is not unbelievable.
@jkempcpa That there is a BIG if. Unverified info used to get a warrant to spy on citizens?
@jkempcpa And what is your proof that Trump is using the FBI as his secret police? He hasn't shown a track record yet of weaponizing gov agencies.
@jkempcpa After seeing how the Obama DOJ handled the Clinton investigation, I am suspicious of how it handled all other politically related cases.
@jkempcpa If the FISA warrant was gotten based on the Democrat paid for Fusion research, than I don't believe the Obama DOJ operated honestly.
@jkempcpa I think the memo will show that the FBI acted exactly like Obama's secret police.
