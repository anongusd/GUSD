Türkiye, Dışişleri Bakanımız Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu’nun da belirttiği gibi, tehdide pabuç bırakmaz.		Türkiye, Trump’ın tehdidine derhal Şam’da Büyükelçilik açarak yanıt vermelidir.		Suriye ile askerî işbirliği, ABD planlarını bozacak en önemli adımdır.
Suriye ile işbirliği, Türkiye’nin ittifak birikimini harekete geçirmek açısından anahtar değerindedir. Rusya, İran, Irak gibi komşularımız ve Çin gibi cephe gerisindeki güçlü dostlarımız, Türkiye’ye güven duymak için Suriye devletine el uzatmasına bakıyorlar.
Türkiye Hükümeti, Kuzey Irak’ta başarı kazanmış olan modeli, hem Suriye’nin kuzeyinde, hem de Doğu Akdeniz’de uygulamak durumundadır. Bunun için Suriye hükümeti ve Suriye Devletinin Ordusuyla derhal işbirliğine geçilmelidir.
Irak askeri Kerkük’e girince, ABD’nin peşmergeleri ve PKK piyonları silahlarını atıp kaçmışlardır. Bugün durum, ABD için çok daha elverişsizdir. ABD gidiyor ve PKK bitiyor. PKK, bugün teslim olmayı tartışıyor.
Hatırlanacağı üzere, ABD ve İsrail’in 2017 yılı güzünde, “Kürdistan” amaçlı referandum girişimi, Türkiye, Irak, İran, Suriye ve Rusya’nın ortak hareketi sonucu bozguna uğramıştır.
Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri, Fırat’ın Doğusunda ve Menbiç’te PKK ve DEAŞ teröristlerini temizleyecek güce sahiptir. Türkiye’nin kararlılığına ABD’nin karşı koyma yeteneği yoktur.
Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri, PKK Terör Örgütünü sınır ötesinde de bitirecektir. Türkiye ve Suriye başta olmak üzere bölge ülkeleri, ABD emperyalizminin ve İsrail’in “Kürt özerk bölgesi” adı altında İkinci İsrail kurmasına izin vermeyecektir.
ABD, bölgemizde Bölücü Terör Örgütü PKK’nın destekçisi olduğunu, Trump’ın ağzından bir kez daha itiraf etmiş oldu. Ancak şunu kesinlikle belirtelim: ABD, PKK’yı hendeklere gömülmekten kurtaramamıştır ve kurtaramayacaktır.
Ekonomik baskılar, ABD’nin dayattığı programın tam iflasını getirecektir. Türkiye için çözüm vardır. ABD’nin baskıları, Türkiye’nin Üretim Devrimiyle büyük karara yönelmesine yol açacaktır. Kaybeden, yine ABD emperyalizmi olacaktır.
ABD’nin sıcak para musluklarını tamamen kapatması, Türkiye için bir tehdit değil, fakat Üretim Ekonomisini kurma fırsatı olur. ABD’den gelecek ekonomik baskılara Türkiye, Vatan Partisi’nin Üretim Devrimi Programıyla yanıt verecektir.
Ve Türkiye için buradan Sıcak Para bularak çıkmak diye bir çözüm bulunmuyor. Borcun borçla çevrilmesi dönemi bitmiştir. ABD, Türkiye ekonomisini batıramaz da, kurtaramaz da.
Türkiye ekonomisi, ABD’nin dayattığı Borçlanma Ekonomisi nedeniyle çıkmaza girmiş bulunuyor. Ekonomimizi mahveden zaten ABD’nin dayattığı programdır.
ABD Başkanı Trump, Türkiye ekonomisini mahvetme tehdidinde bulunuyor. Oysa bu sözler, bir tehdit değil, fakat Türkiye ekonomisi için bir kurtuluş fırsatı ve müjdesidir.
ABD’nin Türkiye’ye karşı koymak uğruna yedi trilyon dolar daha gömecek bir ekonomisi bulunmuyor. ABD ekonomisi artık savaşı taşıyamıyor. Bu nedenle eğer bir ekonomik tehdit varsa, o da ABD’nin karşı karşıya bulunduğu tehdittir.
Dahası, ABD’nin çekilişinin çok önemli ekonomik nedenleri var. Trump’ın da seçim kampanyalarından bu yana belirttiği gibi, ABD silahlı müdahaleleri nedeniyle Batı Asya’ya yerdi trilyon doları gömdü.
ABD, yenildiği için Suriye’den çekiliyor. Trump’ın bu açıklaması, ABD’nin iç kamuoyuna yöneliktir. Yenilen ABD, kuru sıkı atarak ABD kamuoyunda geri çekilişini perdeliyor.
Trump’ın tehdidi boştur. Trump, kuru sıkı atıyor. Çünkü ABD, Türkiyemize yönelttiği tehdidi savaşı sürdürerek hayata geçirebilecek durumda değildir.
Suriye’nin kuzeyinde bir YPG/PKK terör devletinin kurulmasında şemsiye görevi demek. Ardından, Kuzey Irak’la-Suriye’nin kuzeyini birleştirme adımı gelecek.
‘Tampon Bölge’ ya da ‘Güvenli Bölge’nin varlığı, ‘Uçuşa Yasak Bölge’yi gerektirir. Fırat’ın doğusunda ‘Uçuşa Yasak Bölge’ ilanı, 1992’de Kuzey Irak’ta ‘Çekiç Güç’ün yerine getirdiği misyon gibi,
PYD/PKK terör örgütünü koruma, Suriye’yi parçalama ve gelecekte Kuzey Irak’la birleşme potansiyeli taşıyan bir bölge oluşturma amacını güden ABD, bir taşla çok sayıda kuş vurmanın peşinde.
Türkiye’nin, YPG/PKK terör örgütünü etkisiz duruma getirmek için Fırat’ın doğusuna yapacağı olası operasyona karşı çıkan ABD’nin, bir tampon bölge/güvenlik bölgesi hedefi olduğu ortaya çıkıyor.
1992’de ‘Çekiç Güç’ün ilanından bugüne gelindiğinde, 27 yıl sonra bu kez Suriye’nin kuzeyinde benzer bir tablo ortaya çıkarılmaya çalışılıyor.
Bu durum PKK’ya yaramıştı. Bu uygulama, Irak’ta ABD işgalinin başladığı 2003 yılına kadar 12 yıl sürdü. ‘Çekiç Güç’, 12 yıl boyunca Kuzey Irak’ta Kürt Devleti’nin kurulmasına şemsiye oldu ve PKK terör örgütünün canlanmasına uygun ortam sağladı.
@ikalin1 1991 Körfez Savaşı’ndan sonra ABD liderliğindeki İngiliz ve Fransız uçak ve helikopterlerinin Kürtleri Irak’ın o zamanki lideri Saddam Hüseyin’den korumak için Irak’ta 36’ncı paralelin kuzeyi ve 32’nci paralelin güneyinde bir 'uçuşa yasak bölge' ilan etmişti.

Ancak Bolton'un İsrail'den verdiği mesajı yutmamız mümkün değil. Bunlar bu ülkede benim Kürt vatandaşım kimdir, YPG kimdir sanırım bunları tanımıyorlar. PKK-YPG/PYD benim Kürt kardeşlerimin temsilcisi olamaz.
DEAŞ'ı etkisiz hale getirip darmadağın eden Türkiye olmuştur. Kahraman askerlerimiz tarafından söndürülen DEAŞ balonu sonrası Suriye toparlanma sürecine girdi.
3,5 milyonun üzerinde Suriye sığınmacıyı barındıran ülke olarak en büyük insani yükü biz üstlendik. Terör örgütleriyle gerçek anlamda mücadele eden tek ülke Türkiye'dir.
"Suriye meselesinde kritik bir dönemden geçiyoruz. Suriye'nin toprak bütünlüğü, yeni anayasa ve özgür seçimler konusunda aynı kararlı duruşu sergiliyoruz.
Bizim Trump'la net anlaşmaya varmış olmamıza rağmen, ABD yönetiminden farklı sesler çıkıyor. DEAŞ'a yönelik operasyon konusunda hazırlıklarımızı tamamladık. Bu müdahalemize engel olmaya kalkan olursa gereiğini yapmak boynumuzun borcudur..." dedi.
Arapların içinden çıkmış, Kürtlerin içinden çıkmış fark etmez. Bunlar teröristse gereğini yaparız. Bolton çok ciddi yanlış yapmıştır. Bizim bu noktada azla taviz vermemiz mümkün değil. Suriye'de terör koridoru içinde olanlar gerekli dersi alacaklar...

"Following the United States withdrawal from Syria, we will complete an intensive vetting process to reunite child soldiers with their families and include all fighters with no links to terrorist organizations in the new stabilization force," he added.
According to Human Rights Watch, the Y.P.G. militants have violated international law by recruiting children," Erdoğan said.
"Under wartime conditions, many young Syrians had no choice but to join the P.Y.D./Y.P.G., the Syrian branch of the P.K.K., that Turkey and the United States consider a terrorist organization.
Regarding the PKK's Syrian affiliate the People's Protection Units (YPG), Erdoğan said that Turkey has no problems with Kurds, but rather with terrorists like the YPG.
Recalling Turkey's humanitarian efforts in the region, he said that a Turkish-funded hospital provides treatment for Syrian patients and new business projects create jobs and bolster the local economy. "This stable environment is the only cure for terrorism."
"Turkish troops and fighters of the Free Syrian Army went door to door to root out insurgents in Al Bab, a former stronghold of the so-called Islamic State," he added.
Criticizing the coalition operations in Raqqa and Mosul, Erdoğan said that they relied heavily on airstrikes and with "little or no regard for civilian casualties."
"In 2016, Turkey became the first country to deploy ground combat troops to fight the so-called Islamic State in Syria. Our military incursion severed the group's access to NATO's borders and impeded their ability to carry out terror attacks in Turkey and Europe," he wrote.
"Turkey, which has NATO's second largest standing army, is the only country with the power and commitment to perform that task," the president added regarding Turkey's upcoming battle against the Daesh terrorist group.
"The United States withdrawal, however, must be planned carefully and performed in cooperation with the right partners to protect the interests of the United States, the international community and the Syrian people," Erdoğan said.
President Donald Trump made the right call to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, Erdoğan said.
Turkey has a plan to restore peace in Syria and has "no argument" with Syrian Kurds, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in an article published in The New York Times late Monday.

A quick look into Erdogan-Putin diplomacy in 2018 @TRTWorld https://t.co/ULMSVyvIIW
Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the president of Turkey. #PresidentofTurkey
We are counting on the international community to stand with us.
Turkey is volunteering to shoulder this heavy burden at a critical time in history.
It is time for all stakeholders to join forces to end the terror unleashed by the Islamic State, an enemy of Islam and Muslims around the world, and to preserve Syria’s territorial integrity.
We will build on those partnerships to get the job done in Syria.
Turkey intends to cooperate and coordinate our actions with our friends and allies. We have been closely involved in the Geneva and Astana processes, and are the sole stakeholder that can work simultaneously with the United States and Russia.
Turkish officials with relevant experience will advise them on municipal affairs, education, health care and emergency services.
Local councils in predominantly Kurdish parts of northern Syria will largely consist of the Kurdish community’s representatives whilst ensuring that all other groups enjoy fair political representation.
Individuals with no links to terrorist groups will be eligible to represent their communities in local governments.
Ensuring adequate political representation for all communities is another priority. Under Turkey’s watch, the Syrian territories that are under the control of the Y.P.G. or the so-called Islamic State will be governed by popularly elected councils.
Following the United States withdrawal from Syria, we will complete an intensive vetting process to reunite child soldiers with their families and include all fighters with no links to terrorist organizations in the new stabilization force.
According to Human Rights Watch, the Y.P.G. militants have violated international law by recruiting children.
Under wartime conditions, many young Syrians had no choice but to join the P.Y.D./Y.P.G., the Syrian branch of the P.K.K., that Turkey and the United States consider a terrorist organization.
Only a diverse body can serve all Syrian citizens and bring law and order to various parts of the country. In this sense, I would like to point out that we have no argument with the Syrian Kurds.
The first step is to create a stabilization force featuring fighters from all parts of Syrian society.
We want to ensure that citizens do not feel disconnected from government, terrorist groups do not get to prey on the grievances of local communities and ordinary people can count on a stable future.
Turkey proposes a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the root causes of radicalization.
The international community cannot afford to make the same mistake again today.
A military victory against the terrorist group is a mere first step. The lesson of Iraq, where this terrorist group was born, is that premature declarations of victory and the reckless actions they tend to spur create more problems than they solve.
Militarily speaking, the so-called Islamic State has been defeated in Syria. Yet we are deeply concerned that some outside powers may use the organization’s remnants as an excuse to meddle in Syria’s internal affairs.
I say this again: There will be no victory for the terrorists. Turkey will continue to do what it must to ensure its own safety and the well-being of the international community.
A few years back, the terrorist group called me “treacherous Satan.” We saw the horror in the faces of thousands of Christians and Yazidis, who sought refuge in Turkey when these terrorists came for them in Syria and Iraq.
More recently, the so-called Islamic State terrorists targeted our citizens, our way of life and the inclusive, moderate worldview that our civilization represents.
In 2003, when I became prime minister, coordinated attacks by Al Qaeda claimed dozens of lives in Turkey.
Turkey is committed to defeating the so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups in Syria, because the Turkish people are all too familiar with the threat of violent extremism.
Today, children are back at school, a Turkish-funded hospital treats the sick, and new business projects create jobs and bolster the local economy. This stable environment is the only cure for terrorism.
Our approach left the city’s core infrastructure largely intact and made it possible for life to return to normal within days.
Turkish troops and fighters of the Free Syrian Army went door to door to root out insurgents in Al Bab, a former stronghold of the so-called Islamic State.
Unlike coalition operations in Raqqa and Mosul, which relied heavily on airstrikes that were carried out with little or no regard for civilian casualties,
In 2016, Turkey became the first country to deploy ground combat troops to fight the so-called Islamic State in Syria. Our military incursion severed the group’s access to NATO’s borders and impeded their ability to carry out terror attacks in Turkey and Europe.
Turkey, which has NATO’s second largest standing army, is the only country with the power and commitment to perform that task.
The United States withdrawal, however, must be planned carefully and performed in cooperation with the right partners to protect the interests of the United States, the international community and the Syrian people.
President Trump made the right call to withdraw from Syria.
