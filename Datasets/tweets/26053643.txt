@franklinavenue They brought me on set and, for the next four hours, had me shoot this promo I didn’t know I was the “star” of. They told me later they had a backup standing by, in case I wasn’t good.  When the promo aired, it got a “Cheers” in TV Guide and now, I am America’s sweetheart.
@franklinavenue He asked me to come in anyway.  Someone then called and asked for my shirt size. I assumed it was because they were going to give me a t shirt.  When I got to Fox, they sat me in a makeup chair.  I still didn’t know why.
@franklinavenue OK Michael, but only for you.  When I was a young radio sports guy at @kroq, I had a side job punching up Fox network promo scripts. A guy named Geoff Calnan asked me to look at a promo script for a new show (POF). I told him the script looked good and I had nothing to add to it.
