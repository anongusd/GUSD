More than $100 million in terror tunnel/illicit construction sites have been discovered thus far, according to the State of Israel.  Did Hamas pay any Israeli taxes during year one of the building of this illegal construction site?  AAMLAV. https://t.co/JMQFNe8oIu

The State of Israel estimates that this 200 meter illicit construction site cost $3 million, including labor.  How much did the multi-mile tunnels cost?  If they had been lawful construction sites, wouldn't Israel have collected significant tax revenue?  https://t.co/fCFkfHA7Ue
The terror tunnels documented in the WSJ news report were estimated to have cost more than $90 million by the State of Israel. Did the Iranian-backed terror entities pay Israeli taxes during year one of the excavation of these illicit construction sites? Cost is not value. AAMLAV
What if the off duty officer had been framed &amp; murdered instead or had become permanently disabled as a result of the alleged poisoning assault, in 2017?   Justice must be done otherwise, others could be similarly victimized. https://t.co/0JeUr8VRGp
Why are FTOs getting a money laundering-enabling tax break?  How would the Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) assessment have been approached for these multi-mile illicit construction sites over the lifespan of the illicit asset?  By the square foot? https://t.co/UkYT5BsyJ0
@AIPAC Over how many years were these terror tunnels constructed &amp; operated by Hamas? If they had been lawful construction sites, Israel would have received tax revenue. Could Israel now assess back taxes based upon the AAMLAV valuation of the materials, overhead, square footage, etc.?
@AIPAC @marcorubio @SenatorShaheen @MikeCrapo @SenSherrodBrown Congratulations!  Could Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) be utilized to assess taxes, fines &amp; fees against any and all illicit assets of Hezbollah, including illicit drug shipments and its Iranian-made rocket &amp; missile arsenal?
@IDFSpokesperson @AIPAC Could AAMLAV assessed back taxes over the lifespan of a Hamas/Hezbollah terror tunnel enable new discretionary counter-terror tax funding with which to purchase bomb shelters, Iron Dome interceptors and warning systems?  Why give FTOs an automatic tax exemption?
@AIPAC Could Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) mitigate the global money laundering operations of Hezbollah/Iran?  Further, if Hezbollah's rocket &amp; missile arsenal is illegal, could an AAMLAV tax evasion assessment be pursued in Lebanon? Why are SDGTOs getting a tax break?
@CUFI Perhaps Iran's genocidal threats could be likened to evil-Haman's edict and to threatening to use his own gallows? -Esther 7:9-10  As Elie Wiesel warned, these are not idle threats &amp; they must be answered.  Is Iran's nuclear weapons program a modern expression of Haman's gallows?

I predict that all countries will have a domestic AAMLAV policy in the future. Why should criminal organizations get a tax break, simply because the assets are illicit? My Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) concept is not proprietary, and thus I view it as a gift to the world. https://t.co/LDVl4W1LU3
What would the AAMLAV assessment have been for the 14 Hamas terror tunnels? Its Israel's land, Israel's property rights and thus theoretically shouldn't it be Israel's discretionary counter-terror tax revenue (per square foot). https://t.co/AnPkNDcDOp
I predict that every country in the world will soon have an AAMLAV policy, and Israel could lead the way, with a Solomon-esque definitive &amp; brilliant judgement.
@wsls Would it be wise to valuate these illicit assets in absolute terms utilizing Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV)?  Could existing capital gains and tax evasion statutes then be applied?
@AP Would it be wise to consider the Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) of any and all illicit drugs interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard?  Could an AAMLAV assessment apply to existing capital gains and tax evasion statutes?
501(c)3 nonprofits have to work very hard to gain &amp; protect their tax exempt status. Why are criminal FTOs, SDGTOs and Iranian IRGC proxy terror organizations getting an automatic tax exemption, without even having to file a single form?  AAMLAV. https://t.co/GVlxnwljeG
Well said, P.M. Netanyahu and Ambassador Friedman.  Happy 243rd Birthday to the U.S. Navy! Perhaps each U.S. Navy interdiction of illicit assets could be valuated utilizing AAMLAV against dangerous criminal &amp; narco-terror organizations worldwide?   	https://t.co/cHfFnDXEJC

The U.S. was the first country in the world to record that more fatally-injured drivers tested positive for drugs than for alcohol, yet legislators have failed to pass new DUI-D laws &amp; approve the use of evidential RDT kits in support of existing programs. https://t.co/PQ8nQqFMtT

@NSRAPT @DrugWipeUK @LilliansLaw1 Thank you for your road safety leadership! Perhaps one day it will be feasible for forensic experts to estimate the time-frame of illicit drug use relative to the traffic stop or collision, based upon the relative levels of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in the system of the driver?
A few days ago, a maestro of a major orchestra refused to even listen to my "Piano Concerto No. 1" and said that he was not interested in conducting any of my compositions, so I have therefore decided that I'm going to conduct my "Piano Concerto No. 1" from the piano bench.  :) https://t.co/xvBukRn46q

@kentpolicemaid Thank you for your road safety leadership.  The new drug driving law is arguably the most comprehensive, equitable and just DUI-D law yet enacted by any country around the world!
@OSHP Could Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) apply to the sum total of more than $421 million in illicit assets seized by OSHP?  If so, why are criminals getting a tax break? Perhaps such a valuation would enable the pursuit of accumulated illicit wealth, beyond fed. forfeiture.
@nbc4i Could Absolute-AML-Asset Valuation (AAMLAV) be assessed against the $421 million in total illicit asset seizures? Why are criminals getting state and federal tax breaks? Is willful blindness to illicit asset valuation enabling the money laundering engine to continue indefinitely?

@drmelbailey Dr. Bailey's 30 sec. fingerprint drug screening technique could become the ideal roadside drug screening technology due to a variety of factors including the rapid time frame, accuracy, lack of false positives, unprecedented throughput and low cost per testing iteration.
State laws might address DUI-D (cocaine) among CDL school bus drivers &amp; providing the test kits. A 47-year-old TX school bus driver was found to be under the influence of cocaine at the time of the collision with 32 elementary school children on the bus. https://t.co/totVUw5V1A

@MinJusticeEn @Puglaas Thank you for your road safety leadership!

@cbschicago A federal law might address the use of roadside drug testing kits to detect DUI-D commercially-licensed drivers, including ambulance drivers, school bus drivers, commercial truck operators, pilots and taxi/ride-sharing service drivers.  Canada passed a similar DUI-D law in June.
@abc13houston An entirely preventable tragedy.  There are on-site evidential drug testing kits which could have detected the cocaine in the driver's system in 7 - 10 minutes.

@catzcosta @drmelbailey Dr. Bailey's 30 sec. fingerprint drug testing technique is an ideal in situ test, considering the lack of false positives. An RDT kit takes 7-10 min. and costs $20-$30, whereas the 30 sec. method has a negligible cost per test. Confirmatory lab tests may negate legal challenges.

Canada is leading the NAFTA region to safer roads &amp; highways with this initiative. The new zero-tolerance DUI-D standard will apply to all commercially licensed drivers, including school bus drivers, commercial truck drivers, and taxi/ride-sharing drivers: https://t.co/lpHiQjzUW1
Were either of the commercial truck drivers involved in the deaths of Becky Dwojeski-Phipps and John W. Crozier evidentially drug screened at the roadside following the fatal collisions?
@BostonTarget DUI-D (cocaine) always puts the lives &amp; safety of others at serious risk.  The approval of similar RDT initiatives here in the U.S. will save many lives on our roads &amp; highways, including innocent families and children.

Excellent question. Effluent testing could have determined whether or not it was human, and if the person had recently used illicit drugs.
I am reminded of the time that feces were in the flowers and vase at my mother's grave. A friend of a mafioso asked if it was human feces.
I asked the worker if he kept his M4 AR in his vehicle, and he then stated, "If anyone F(*&amp;# with me, they're dead."  Unprofessional chat.
Also, the worker who fixed my garbage disposal yesterday claimed to take his M4 AR everywhere he goes but sold his AK47. Unprofessional &lt;?
