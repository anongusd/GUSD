Takeaway 2 #MunichSecurityConference:  In the battle of the VPs, Biden won decisively.  His “We’ll be back” speech reminded Americans our national interest dictates alliance with Europe.  Pence’s hectoring on Iran+in-your-face criticism of Germany, France+UK a disaster.

What made America great around the world?  Our Alliances, Free Trade; Defending Democracy; Immigration to enrich our nation.  Trump is trying systematically to undermine all of them.
Missing from Trump’s lengthy State of the Union speech—that defending democracy should be a priority, especially in Europe where it is under challenge by leaders such as Victor Orban whom Trump supports.
NATO allied budgets began to increase when Putin invaded Crimea in 2014 and have continued under Trump.  So Putin, Obama and Trump deserve the credit together for a strengthening NATO.
There is another anniversary this year—the 70th anniversary of #NATO.   There will be no Summit to mark it because the allies fear Trump will act up and ruin it as he has done all his meetings with European leaders.
This is significant. https://t.co/5fDxBJXAZy

The Mattis resignation letter is one of protest and principle.  No praise for Trump.  Its two major points: 1) The U.S. must value and respect our allies; and 2) stand up to Russia and China—two issues in which Trump is the weakest U.S. President in the modern era.  Remarkable.

Americans should support European efforts to build a stronger defense, of course.  But France better advised to seek a stronger NATO rather than “autonomy” from the U.S., Canada and other non-EU countries. https://t.co/TagqxjRmhY
For nearly seventy years now, the NATO allies have never paid the U.S. to protect them.  This is not how #NATO works.  Each ally has its own defense budget.  The President should not mislead Americans and try to turn us against the allies who are our closest global friends. https://t.co/yYLmvzAzpt
Trump is the only President in seven decades who does not see the value of NATO—the greatest power differential between the U.S. and Russia.  We would be far weaker without the allies.  Deeply flawed Presidential logic. https://t.co/yYLmvzAzpt
Two former American Ambassadors to #NATO in Brussels today pointing to the text of Article 5 at the new HQ. Doug Lute+I know all too well how much we Americans depend on Europe and Canada.   They backed us on 9/11 and are still in Afghanistan with us today.  #Allies https://t.co/CLdx52INfz

International law governs asylum seekers.  They are asked to present themselves at the border in any part of the world.  We are accustomed to this.  No reason to panic.  But that is what President Trump has done—for electoral reasons. https://t.co/h5DUuMKeTQ
You make a good point.  That is why our immigration and border control officials need to vet all such people before deciding to admit them or turn them away.  Our civilian officials know how to do this. https://t.co/YEf3iyuB3A
If the U.S. maintains its decades-long policy of taking in a fixed number of immigrants and refugees legally, there will be less chaos, not more.  This is a very American story.  We are an immigrant nation, after all. https://t.co/pcQcl7R1SN
It depends on each individual case.  They don’t have a right to enter the U.S. but the law actually encourages them to approach the border.  Our civilian personnel know what to do. Asylum seekers are sometimes admitted, sometimes not.  This is not a crisis unless we make it one. https://t.co/Q88uWZFEgI
I don’t support illegal immigration.  The people marching to our southern border are asylum seekers.  They have the right to request asylum.  It is our right to then admit them or not admit them.  But they as a group do not pose a threat to US security. https://t.co/NddJFnLGIm

Yes, Putin understands intelligence.  But he does not understand Justice and law enforcement in a democracy.  Embarrassing and a dereliction of duty for Trump to refuse to say one word of criticism on any issue.
Putin is going after the American anti-corruption crusader Bill Browder.  Trump should not let him.
Trump won’t say a single word in support of the Grand Jury’s indictment of the 12 Russian intelligence agents.  And he should say Nyet to Putin’s idea of exchange of law enforcement and Justice officials.  The Russians won’t tell the truth.
Given the opportunity to criticize Russia by Reuters, Trump can’t bring himself to say a single negative word about Russia—our most dangerous adversary.
It is not enough for Trump to say he got along with Putin.  Where is American strength and conviction on Crimea, the nerve agent attack on the U.K. and Putin’s own cyber attack on our election?   Diplomacy is not about being polite.  It is about defending our country.
Trump gives Putin a pass on Moscow’s cyber attack on our elections.  No mention of US concerns.  No mention of sanctions.  Weak.

In this interview with @MorningEdition, I argue the U.S. benefits enormously from #NATO.   Trump’s criticism is over the top.  He needs to lead NATO, not just bash it.  https://t.co/Gyb4nr4k9i
Putin crossed the brightest red line in international law by invading and then annexing Crimea.  And then he launched an attack on our elections.  And then a nerve agent attack in the UK. Sanctions must be maintained or else we’ll have a policy of weakness and appeasement. https://t.co/sZRgqtNRH9
As a former U.S. Ambassador to #NATO, I think Trump is right allies should increase defense spending.  But trend is positive—all have increased military budgets+great majority should be at 2% of GDP by 2024. Only fair for Trump to acknowledge this.  They have our back. https://t.co/X757L2VeoS
All the #NATO allies have spent more on defense since Putin annexed Crimea.  They are fighting with us in Afghanistan and against ISIS.  They have deployed to Poland+Baltics to contain Russia.  Shouldn’t Pres. Trump also praise allies for all they do for our security? https://t.co/rJrmhCUrqp

Trump deserves credit for turning to diplomacy with North Korea.  His meeting with Kim was powerfully symbolic.  But their agreement was paper thin. Trump needs to bring South Korea+Japan into the talks.  Keep China close.  Will he have patience to manage the 1000 steps ahead?
President Trump is right to meet Kim.  It never made sense to consider war without having made the effort to try diplomacy first. Having said that, Trump will need lots of strategic patience for the twists and turns ahead.  This will be a long and tough negotiation. https://t.co/nQKHBTF2KX

After cancelling summit with North Korea, Trump now needs to keep South Korea and Japan with him and encourage China to apply sanctions on Kim.  Hope Trump has a Plan B.  Worry he may not.
