I have a nephew that plays #Minecraft and it is too #Liberal for him to play. I have to monitor it so he only plays #ChristianMinecraftServer . #HeilHitler #Christian #Republicans #BanFortniteFromExistingBecauseItsBadForMentalHealth
We must deport all Muslim Missourians back to Muslim Missouri. Don't let East St. Louis be the next St. Louis. #Deported #MAGA #HeilHitler #Nazism #HillaryClinton2020 #BruceRauner2018 #Illinois #Christianity

@YSherri7 I am sorry for your father. Now, if you must, he was abusing alcohol, that was the reason he is the way he is. If he weren't to abuse it, he would still be a literate person.
@__neilk__ Cannabis is a bad substance, yes, but people die from alcohol-related, or any other kind of drug-related death, is caused by people misusing the substances.
@sherlock1313 You think a man dressed as Hitler would have a German accent too.
@sherlock1313 Hell is true, and if you don't believe it you will burn too. And to your second point, I know what is what. I am a Congressman you know.
@YSherri7 Alcohol is not as toxic or as mentally devastating as marijuana.
@Mata_Monitor Mr. Mata, please keep in mind that sending her to the hospital will prevent her from killing more innocent people, and by doing this at an early stage, you can get into her mind that if you kill people, you will burn in hell.
@allgood_pat I agree, what she did was horrible, and better hope to make it to heaven. May our Lord save her.
@Syl2944 But you must realise, that someone who is sick in their mind shall be treated. And if she does not get rehabilitated, she will most likely do it again.
@cnni This drug is and shall remain illegal. There is no place for a drug like this in our first world society.
It is sad to me that liberals want this so-called 'Real Version' of @realDonaldTrump memo. He released it, if you don't believe it, then you can go out and protest again. But good luck, since the weather is going to be below freezing for the next couple of days.
@ksdknews Aw, he was a friend of mine.
@cnni Good, the good women should not have to wear that hot, sweltering "scarf" all day.
@ksdknews This is a horrible act of violence. I will have these two individuals in my prayers.
CNN lies, FOX has alternative facts, CBS and PBS hire sex offenders, NBC should get its license taken away. All of our news has failed. I blame @HillaryClinton
I stand with French President @EmmanuelMacron. The Jewish boy who was attacked on the streets of Paris was a horrible, horrible crime. This is an example of why we should ban radical Muslims from our great nation. God bless the boy, and hopefully, he can live a strong future.
I, with my wife, was on a train earlier today with other members of Congress. Luckily, I or my family were not hurt. But I still mourn for the truck driver who was killed and his family. I also mourn for the other driver who was hurt. May the Lord bless them both.
@discordapp I have tried to open your website numerous times, it will not load. And when it does load, none of my friends or servers is available.
@J73Jim The Bible is as conservative as Iran.
I’ve long said that gov’s first obligation is to protect the safety &amp; security of the American people. This bill strengthens our military, provides our troops a pay raise, bolsters missile defense, &amp; drives innovation in military technology. https://t.co/egOhULStyb
In order to get liberals out of Illinois, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.
We must abolish liberals.
Why are we allowing our country to be overrun by liberals?
Why must we let those filthy liberals take over Illinois when they are only in Chicago?
