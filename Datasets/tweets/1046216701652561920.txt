@thehill Also, it makes you look ignorant when you assume things about people you don't know...		#TheMoreYouKnow #RedWave #SocialismSucks
@thehill It's okay....Cortez doesn't understand what unemployment rate means and she has a degree in economics. She maintains that it is low because everyone has multiple jobs lol. Even if everyone had 10 jobs, it still wouldn't change the number of people that AREN'T working.....
@shiggtr0n @realDailyWire @benshapiro It must be blissful being this ignorant...incitement of violence and polarized rhetoric have overwhelming swallowed similar circumstances of the right. You can turn on any media source and see evidence of this. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like facts will sway you though.

@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson It never worked great for the majority of people, dems or reps. This is exactly why they couldn't get votes to fund it until they held a non-bipartisan vote with only dems to get it passed...even in the blue states. Major repeals and reforms have made it better thanks to Trump.
@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson You are unfortunately the exception, not the rule...which I am sorry you ended up being the shark attack scenario politicians use to convince people that situations like yours were somehow rampant.  For most, insurance premiums skyrocketed and were less flexible/available.
@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson Okay then you understand that it specifically taxes (mostly) the upper middle and higher tax brackets. We have a high sales tax because of the fact that there is no state income tax, and don't get it twisted that sales tax will go down bc of state income tax implementation.
@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson Ummm we definitely had insurance before ACA lol. Where have you been? I was covered under blue cross blue shield for quite a while until ACA, which then became double what I would have paid per month otherwise. It then became unaffordable and I paid 695/month anyway for nothing.

@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson No one is taking away their healthcare lol. You sound like the gun rights people now. If anything happens of the sort it is much needed reform of the formerly failed plan that made those services much more expensive and less accessible to the majority of Americans.
@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson Yes...it is 9.5% where I live in East TN.  I was talking about RoI for dividends, stocks, and bonds. You do understand I was talking about the Hall Tax I mentioned in my last response, right?
@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson 9% is really good too...most people don't make that much.
@BlueByrdie @DeeIbdulJackson State income taxes have been in contention for a very long time now, and we actually have a hall tax that only taxes people drawing from any dividends, bonds, or stocks at around 6% (not your poor people for the most part). Imagine making 9% and paying back 2/3 of it every year.
