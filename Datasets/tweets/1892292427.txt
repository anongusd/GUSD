I will complain about her once I get off this bus and head into the county mental hospital.
Nah, she wanted to make an "example" out of me.
She could have been nice, but decided to "throw her weight around" and try to hurt me further than I have been all ready.
Before we could get going down the street was when she chose to embarrass me.
New Orleans to Houston.
She--the driver--is so effing fat that it's probably painful to squeeze down the aisles of this Greyhound bus we're on together.
Yes, I was loud--and very open and honest about what I have been going through since 01/28/2019 after a suicide attempt.
I was trying to talk with my old friends in Lawrenceville, GA.  I'm running from my home state--GA--to keep my former roommate from killing me.
Bout 30 min ago I was HUMILIATED in front of the riders of this New Orleans to Houston bus on the effing P. A.!

@___f1f I am happy that you are a proud Muslim.  Muslims were keeping Higher Education alive and advancing mathematics and science during the Dark and Middle Ages in Europe.  Islam often gets a "bad rap", but Islam kept Israel alive.
Hello WORLD!  I'm @csoderberg1 .  Nice to be "meeting" all of you.  I have to admit, I'm HOPELESSLY monolingual.  English is my ONLY language.  But if we can look past my limitations, then we'll be followers of each other!

The Super Bowl is on in the background.  While many of you have chosen to boycott the NFL to support @Kaepernick7 , I feel that the NFL needs to have viewers who can have MOMENTS of quiet protest while the National Anthem is being sung.  #osaycanyoukneel
⚡️ “Too late for the National Anthem, but not out of time.”		https://t.co/JDIWOcrEX6
@Kaepernick7 Hi.  I'm @csoderberg1 (Carla Soderberg).  Although I am quite disorganized, I kneel with you.  Don't ever stop kneeling. https://t.co/bvSfZVGgsA
Hello Twitter!  It's Superbowl Sunday.  I am asking all of you to join me when The National Anthem's first words are sung, please go live or record yourselves kneeling while holding a sign saying #osaycanyoukneel for those who can't.  #osaycanyoukneel https://t.co/q28jNLfbrw
Should NFL Players be allowed to peacefully protest the National Anthem by politely kneeling to bring attention to the "Plantation Mentality" that exists within  ALL professional sports?
@MicrosoftHelps i am having a problem installing windows 10 pro oem into another computer I own.  Help!
@FreedomPop FEDEX is not going to be able to properly deliver my effing hotspot!  Fix this mess you incompetent boobs!  My apartment number is A-2.
@FreedomPop I contacted FEDEX to check on my order status.  There was a problem.   My apartment number was not on the package!   OMG!   10 times I told that agent my apartment number.
@FreedomPop OK you jerks.   I am passing mad.   A few days ago I was on my umpteenth call with your customer service department.   I had trouble trying to get it in to the agent's head my address.  Well,  it seemed that all was well and I was going to be getting my device.

First Carrie Fisher.  Now her mother Debbie Reynolds.  Death has gotten them.  Sad.
Not sleeping.  Again.  Thinking about Carrie Fisher.  So sad.
Once again sleep eludes me.  Thinking about Carrie Fisher.  Hoping she recovers soon.
Sleeping issues again.  Ugh.  Hope to drift off soon...
Couldn't sleep.  Still wide awake.  One day I will sleep...
Can't sleep.  Probably going to stay awake all night.  Ah well....
Hoping not to spend Christmas and New Year's alone.
Watching Falcons football.  They are up 21 to 7.  Go Birds!
Can't sleep.  TV remote broke. Hate what is on now.
