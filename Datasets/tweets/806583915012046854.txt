As a WWII Navy veteran, Congressman, Ambassador to the UN, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Director of the CIA, Vice President and 41st President of the United States, there is no question that President Bush devoted his life to serving his fellow Americans.
He once said that ‘the American Dream means giving it your all, trying your hardest, accomplishing something. And then I'd add to that, giving something back. No definition of a successful life can do anything but include serving others.’
President George H.W. Bush was a man of integrity and humility and a devoted public servant throughout his life.
I am humbled by the outpouring of support I've received from the good people of #GA03 this week. None of this would be possible without you. I am excited for this opportunity to better serve the folks of the Third District in the 116th Congress https://t.co/W72MJLpWes

That's why @davidcicilline and I introduced the Protecting JOBs Act. This legislation would prevent states from suspending, revoking or denying state professional licenses solely because borrowers fall into a delinquent or default status on their federal student loan payments
Yet there are currently 19 states, including Georgia, that have laws on the books allowing state entities to take adverse action against an individual’s professional license
It is completely contradictory to think that revoking someone’s professional license will help them pay down their student loan debt when, in fact, it often blocks them from working entirely

As a Christian, I consider it a moral obligation to support the Nation of Israel and the important holy sites it encompasses
It is unacceptable the administration turned its back on Israel &amp; our long-standing policy of supporting a peaceful 2 state solution
