All these people Trump hired are people willing to do things that are illegal Trump knows all along what's legal or not and even plays the idiot card all the time, Trump could pass the Bar exam with out any problems and be an Attorney himself https://t.co/HVbPFgWpWA
And sees work do with out a permit  fines the developer and the developer blames his staff and the contractor that did the work, contractor gets fined looses license or even jail It was cheaper for the developer to do it this way the small code fine is cheaper https://t.co/HVbPFgWpWA
Another thing Developers not all just few like Trump so code enforcement hates you and you have some code problems no work around so, the Developers look for a sucker contractor who will do the illegal work knowingly or unknowingly with out permits someday code comes https://t.co/HVbPFgWpWA
Some people  who speak to the FBI like President Reagan could not remember anything and you never ever leave paper email trials even if it's legit work because today your actions could be legal but tomorrow could be criminal https://t.co/HVbPFgWpWA
So that lie to the FBI about the 130 thousand is a felony plus he purjerd himself to Congress and in Court any thing over 1,000 is a felony the Best thing to do with law enforcement like FBI is to tell the truth. Or plead the 5th amendment you dont have to self incriminate https://t.co/HVbPFgWpWA
We have so many laws on the books that just about anybody is a footstep away from being a jailbrird like Michael Cobden he got that 130 thousand to pay that chick off he probably didn't pay any taxes on it, I bet The IRS believes that's taxable but he then lied to the FBI https://t.co/HVbPFgWpWA

I bet they have no receipts of the payments to Mike and it's probably  hidden in a personal hour bill rate Trump will say his attorney  told him to do it, paid for that legal advice. See developers always look for fools that will break the law for them		 https://t.co/KwH7KEx9cv

@WrittenComedy @CNN So it's the way I said Black men can invent things.... you think that implies  that blacks cannot or something like that
@WrittenComedy @CNN But I am curious.... You said " That" implies that black people are incompetent.  You'll noticed I did not use " people  of color " because that denotes many different colors. And I wanted to be specific.  So how does my statement  make blacks feel incompetent?
make these deals it's still not evidence, because Trump will just denied it, there is no money trail even with Mike Conan , unless you have a big fat check for 130 thousand bucks which I am sure you don't, you just have a tax cheat etc lawyer and the National Enquire word come on https://t.co/Irnd09TVTF

@AC360 @andersoncooper And not only ten Terrorist have been captured including ISIS but a 100 of them!!!! So again Anderson Cooper lies again!!! Insanity!! 	Read and weep ! By Newsmax https://t.co/WiB5bImlbq
@AC360 @andersoncooper Trump knew the order to replace the fencing and funding was Their, so Trump had them replace the fencing not with the same old type fencing but the New border wall material instead. So why would CNN allow for Anderson Copper 360 to lie on National television! I want an Apology!
@AC360 @andersoncooper fencing replaced by Trump's border wall if you go back to the original fencing it look nothing like this new border wall being put in, so why does Anderson  Cooper 360 make up A lie and say it's not a border Wall? replacement fencing when Copper knows it's not the same deception?
Yes, it's replace fencing but they replaced it with what Trump wanted for the border wall the old fencing looks nothing like this new border wall stuff so your making up a lie, why would you do that? https://t.co/3BLRGFR9he

@Yelda888 @AC360 meet in court face to face your accuser. That's another right you have. Which is a direct violation of this IV Article. He was not allowed to see Dr Ford 		An impartial Jury you get that right, and Job interview or not the Committee Should of known that people have certain rights
@Yelda888 @AC360 The IV 	My argument is he didn't even have charges brought against him. No charges no crime.		So this Job interview is not a court of law and has no way of knowing if any Criminal complain is valid. why they should have referred it to local authorities so they can investigate https://t.co/Q1WHOEkl4l
By the way it's happened before in history where a Judge was put in power only latter to be arrested and charged with crimes. Ok. That's our system we're not Mob rule COMMY puks https://t.co/JwGVBzJWNz
The Judiciary Committee does not investigate crimes! If someone accused like Judge Kavanagh with a past crime they send that to the local state or FBI if it's. Fed crime. You don't interview them because of section IV if the United States Of America Constitution! https://t.co/JwGVBzJWNz
Dr Ford was a heavy drinker who passed out all the time, that's why she can't remember much. Some her beach buddy's fed her that the soon to be Judge was the one that almost rapped her! Noticed she doesn't want to say who they were! Hilldabeast best friends? https://t.co/JwGVBzJWNz
Ford dosen't want local authorities to investigate, because they would find her year book with her slut friends. Yes miss innocent was trying to fuck as many guys as she could!

@AlanJade1 @jay224466 @NBCNews The real reason  why Chinese don't invent things is because they are communist. In America  you have a great idea and you can make lots of money! Look at Bill Gates Billionaire  many times over. In China they give wealth to intellectuals communist Party members not to inventors.
@AlanJade1 @jay224466 @NBCNews I guess you have to define  that, because  the Chinese invented gunpower and had rockets way back before anyone else. In fact if I remember  right they had a few battles with ships in the ocean  and the Chinese rocket's setting the wood ships ablaze.

@discjocke52 Syria has been a safe haven for Terrorist for a long time. It's a thorn in our foot. And the only reason it exists today like that is because Russia is running the show. Assud is just a puppet for Putin and Russia. As long as Syria is anti America, UK, etc then Russia loves Syria

@HelihellScott @DRUDGE_REPORT You should see 6 to 7 per Gallon Gas price jump soon maybe this year. Because of inflation. 	Which will cause everything to go up again. 	We still have not seen the Collapse of the commercial real estate market yet. Just some. That has been on the brink of Collapse for some time.
@HelihellScott @DRUDGE_REPORT So Trump will have to double at least the National DEBIT just to keep our economy as it is. That's 40 Trillion dollars in the hole. 	If Trump wants to expand that's another 20 Trillion! That's 60 Trillion that's why WWW 3 on the way
@HelihellScott @DRUDGE_REPORT I think the Republicans will cut as much as they can, and then spend as much as they can to stop this Economy from tanking. If they do that like Bush and Obama did, Trump will have to spend Double what Obama did just to keep up with inflation.
@HelihellScott @DRUDGE_REPORT All that's happened is Debit piled on debt, or transferred to other companies. Some paid off most not. What was making this Economy going is health care. Which soon will end. Trump said he will spend more on the Military but the Military keep saying they are cutting ..
@HelihellScott @DRUDGE_REPORT To keep the Economy going, like it is or make the Economy Expand you have to prop it up. Since Pres Bush until now that's why the Economy is doing as go as it had been is because of some Spending. You see it everywhere new business created many old new Collapsing

#TaxReform So Feds give from 35% to 21% back But the States raise taxes 15% and also raise employee tax now all that savings is now going to the state Instead of the Feds, and once again Tax Payers are screwed !
#TaxReform The Fed Gov one day said I have 1000 employees that's to many and fires 500, then the Gov said we have to few Military and hires 1000 that my friend is Government Expansion
#TaxReform ah yes, the feds give back taxes to you and the States raises taxes and takes it away, dog and pony show. You your it!
#TaxReform If your firing Gov workers in one part of the Gov like EPA only to rehire Gov Workers In the Military your not shrinking Gov. So Feds lower taxes but now States like California Have huge state tax increases, so your just trading taxes from one part of Gov to another!
#TaxReform will Trump be able to stay below their Spending limits ? Will they not add to the 20 Trillion debit? In order to keep our economy like it is, we will have to at some point feed the fire,

@sama Bestiality People have the same acceptance Problem as Gay's and Lesbian's  perhaps that why you felt more free in China than in San Francisco since beastiality has been outlawed and condemned in the United States. But not so in China. Pressure to preform but not in China.
@sama China has a dirty Secret of Chinese women having sex with there familys pets ....like their dogs! So if you see Chinese people walking down the street with a dog with big balls etc it makes you pause and Wounder. I am sure just as you have gay acceptance feelings these bestiality
@sama Sam however there are and will always be certin People who have high morals when it comes to gay men or Lesbian Activitys. However I believe the United States also has the highest Degree of tolerance than any country in the world. Just as you might be acceptable being gay,
