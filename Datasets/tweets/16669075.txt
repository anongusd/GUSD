@JaneBIVL Hi Jane, Presidential Alerts are not to be used for general communication, and will only be used in cases of extreme national emergencies that affect public safety.
@UseltonP @FCC @LisaMei62 Hi, no need to do anything on your part. Cell phones that are switched on, within range of an active cell tower and whose wireless carrier participates in WEAs should be capable of receiving the test message.
@The_Britany Hi there, this alert is not a text message. It will look like messages you get for AMBER alerts &amp; weather. The Presidential Alert will only be used for national emergencies. The test is intended to assess the readiness of our nationwide alert systems.
