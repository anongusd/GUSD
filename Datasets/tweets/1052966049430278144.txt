@NevilleD35 @LibertyAndTech @redsteeze I don‚Äôt even care about where they lean, I just want someone that will praise the guy when they see fit, and criticize him when he does bad. We hardly have that. It‚Äôs either full for or full against. Such a turn off
@LibertyAndTech @NevilleD35 @redsteeze I was skeptical of it to begin with, due to some of the positions by the Weekly Standard.
