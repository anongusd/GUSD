@MSNBC The Donald is ABSOLUTELY correct! And you yo-yos at MSNBC are one of the MAIN culprits. You tell lies, spin and skew the facts and foment hatred and violence. You should be ashamed of yourselves. How do you yo-yos sleep at night?!
@MSNBC @maddow @chrislhayes Madcow has anxiety? Say it ain't so, Madcow.
@charliekirk11 @SebGorka Liberals are animals. They are base with inherent turpitude. They are brainwashed by the likes of Hill-the-Pill, Spartacus Booker, Crazy Pelosi, and that particle physicist, Maxine Waters. #MAGA #TrumpRocks
@MSNBC Duh!
The NBC network is like a psychotic horse regarding Megyn Kelly. They took her comment out of context and politicized it. @megynkelly  They deserved to be sued and sued hard!
@MegynTODAY @rolandsmartin Not a Megyn fan, but I heard her, yesterday, and she DID NOT say or do anything WRONG! Al Roker: You should be ashamed of your self!
@SenatorTimScott This is probably a left wing radical group sponsored by Soros to garner sympathy for the Dems in the upcoming election.
@MSNBC @NBCInvestigates @jonathan4ny The people are sick and tired of Bolsheviks like the Clintons and Soros when they are fomenting violence. Whoever sent these packages got down on THEIR level. Bad and sad. Be better than the Clintons and Soros.
@Reuters Sure he is. What goes on in the kingdom needs to STAY in the kingdom. This cat needs to understand that he can't run around outside the kingdom and whack people with whom he disagrees.
@MegynTODAY NBC and Al Roker: YOU people are OUT of LINE. Megyn Kelly did NOTHING WRONG!
@DRUDGE_REPORT This Ocasio-Cortez "anomaly" is dumber than a bag of hammers.
@LindseyGrahamSC Let's get to the bottom of this and MOVE on. The U.S. populous has NO idea what goes on in the Saudi kingdom and does not understand the Whabi and Sunni factions. Rap their knuckles and tell 'em they can't run around the world whacking those who criticize them.
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams Juan is a smart guy. Why would he say something this stupid?
Ocasio-Cortez, that is. She just lies and makes lies up as she goes along and the Dim-witted-Dims believe her dreck and drivel.....although, she would have NO clue what the word "dreck" means and I doubt she can write a cohesive sentence.
Who IS this kooky chick?! https://t.co/ZeSgBkALdO
This LUNATIC LEFT must be stopped. Thank you, Heitkamp, for calling Hill-the-Pill out on her "ridiculous" comment.
@washingtonpost Major this WaPo: You yellow muckraking "journalists" are part and parcel to the divisiveness that is sweeping our great nation. You won't be satisfied until we are in the next Civil War 2.0.

Judge Kavanaugh has been pummeled to a bloody pulp in the court of public opinion. Then he was dragged into a bogus senate judiciary committee inquisition where he was tarred, feathered, and then, draw and quartered. What more do you want?
@washingtonpost I doubt this WaPo skewed "perspective." Kavanaugh has been pummeled to a bloody pulp in the court of public opinion. Then he was dragged into a bogus senate judiciary committee inquisition where he was tarred, feathered, and then, draw and quartered. What more do you want?
This "trigger" business is beyond the pail! "Trigger" is a HORSE, not a mental condition! https://t.co/rjylHXvjDU
@washingtonpost More opinion reporting from the WaPo. C'mon, people at WaPo, do your job and report, fairly. Be journalists and not haters. Kavanaugh DID not do what Ford said he did. She probably had something happen to her, but it wasn't Kavanaugh.

@FoxNews Dr. Ford may have been assaulted, but the Republican proxy attorney who is asking questions needs to come in hot-and-hard on Ford. Ford is a smart chick and her attorney has prepped her well.
Dr. Ford may be telling the truth, but it isn't about Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.
@PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump Probably the best presidential speech I've heard in my lifetime! And, @PeteHegseth, I was born during the Eisenhower administration.
Kamala Harris is out of control. Harris needs to shut up and step up.
@TODAYshow Nice job, Savannah, interviewing the 2nd accuser's attorney. They don't have anything on Kavanaugh and they know it.
I don't think Bill Cosby should be in jail. I think he should be in a high security mental hospital where they treat people humanely and treat their problems, effectively.
The Today Show is going crazy over what The Donald said about Kavanaugh's 2nd accuser. The 2nd accuser says she "can't remember." Read the New Yorker article and you'll see she doesn't remember poo.
