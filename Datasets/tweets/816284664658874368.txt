While it’s not ideal, @POTUS has the legal authority to deal with much of this crisis by declaring a national emergency, and I am pleased he has indicated he will do so
Unfortunately, Democrats were not interested in offering credible compromise-solutions and the final agreement fell well short of the President’s comprehensive border security proposal, not even funding half of his requested amount for both infrastructure and personnel.
I have been adamant that our country is facing a national security crisis and that Congress must give the President the resources and tools he needs to secure the border and protect our citizens.

The State of our Union is STRONG!
The President’s message was spot on:	• establish a safe and legal immigration system with real border security	• protect American workers in trade	• rebuild America’s infrastructure	• lower the cost of healthcare	• protect America’s national interests abroad
"We must keep America first in our hearts; we must keep freedom alive in our souls; we must always keep faith in America's destiny - that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" - @POTUS
AMEN!
"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life, and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God." - @POTUS
President Trump negotiated from a position of strength, and the USMCA will provide freer and fairer trade markets with our neighbors to the north and south. #SOTU
Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners, representing 15% and 14.3 % of the US’ total trade market respectively.
"Our new USMCA will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA" - @POTUS
"Simply put, walls work and walls save lives." - @POTUS
In fact, illegal immigration costs Texas $12 billion a year, and since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with more than 291,000 criminal offenses in the state. #SOTU
As a border state, no one is on the frontlines of this fight more than Texas, and the federal government has been derelict in their duty to secure the border.
"The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens." - @POTUS
Our porous border has allowed for rampant criminal and gang activity to occur in our communities. We need to secure our southernmost border and BUILD THE WALL where it is appropriate. #SOTU
"Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business." - @POTUS
"In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, A SWEEPING NEW FARM BILL, historic VA reforms ..." - @POTUS
"After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. The State of our Union is STRONG" - @POTUS
Great news for West Texas producers!
"We have unleashed a revolution in American energy - the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy." - @POTUS
The American people are seeing more money in their pockets thanks to the booming economy. #SOTU
Under the leadership of President Trump and Republicans in Congress, our nation’s total real gross domestic product growth exceeded 3% over the last four quarters, with it topping 4.2% in the second quarter.
"In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom - a boom that has rarely been seen before." - @POTUS

BUILD THE WALL!
Whether it was No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, Kate’s Law, Securing America’s Future Act, Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, or a resolution backing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, House Republicans received little to no support from our Democrat counterparts.
Throughout the 115th Congress, Democrats refused to come to the table to discuss meaningful immigration reform – instead, they’ve resorted to open-border, sanctuary city policies.
Their stance may have changed, but the facts haven’t. We’ve seen that where walls and fencing have been built, illegal border crossings have dropped upwards of 90%: El Paso – 95%, Yuma – 95%, San Diego – 92%, Tucson – 90%.
The fact is that walls work, and Democrats have supported border security in the past.
Our porous border costs Texas alone $12 billion a year, and since 2011, our state has charged more than 186,000 illegal aliens with more than 291,00 criminal offenses. https://t.co/ivS5rhgQWN
Border security is a national security issue, and our southernmost border needs reinforcements: a physical barrier, advanced technology, and boots on the ground.

Then-Senator Obama: “The bill before us will certainly do some good. It will authorize some badly needed funding for better fences and better security along our borders, and that should help stem some of the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
Senator Dianne Feinstein: “Democrats are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence. . . We’ve got to get tough on the border.”
Senator Schumer (3/3): "Any immigration solution must recognize that we must do as much as we can to gain control of our borders as soon as possible."
Senator Schumer (2/3): "The progress includes 9,000 new border patrol field agents in the last four years, construction of a 630-mile border fence, or 630 miles of border fence, that create a significant barrier to illegal immigration on a southern land border."
Senator Schumer (1/3): "Because of our efforts in Congress, our border is far more secure today than it was when we began debating comprehensive reform in 2005. Between 2005 and 2009, a vast amount of progress has been made on our borders and ports of entry."
Speaker Pelosi: “What are the options that we have available to us, let's make sure they work. Because while we need to address the issue of immigration and the challenge we have of undocumented people in our country, we certainly don’t want any more coming in.”

Less government and more freedom has been the key to our recent economic success, and now the Democrats want to go backwards with more taxes, more spending, and more government control.

Doing these things will solve most of the problem. How about it Senate Democrats? Let’s solve the problem and not just give lip service to the American people.
- close loopholes being exploited by illegals regarding asylum, sanctuary cities, and others; and 	- build more detention facilities and increase the number of immigration judges to end catch and release and expedite deportation hearings.
If Democrats are truly serious about stopping illegal immigration, as Schumer and Pelosi have repeatedly stated, then they should at least support the following:	- turn off all magnets - no jobs and no federal funding of any kind for illegals;
In addition to physical barriers, we must STOP rewarding people who come to this country illegally.
Washington has failed us; Trump is fighting for us!
Schumer’s current posture is disingenuous, and I believe he and the Democrats are putting politics ahead of the safety and security of our citizens. Border states like Texas have spent billions of dollars doing the federal government’s job.
The President and Republicans in the House also put forth a DACA fix along with border security, which received ZERO Democrat support.
I support President Trump and his unwavering commitment to securing the border, including funding for the wall. Senator Schumer and the Democrats voted for wall funding last year as well as 700 miles of fencing in 2006.

Agriculture and traditional American values go hand-in-hand. Farmers and ranchers represent more than food and fiber – they symbolize a culture of faith, hard work, and independence, which has always been at the heart of America’s greatness.
... They also provide support for critical infrastructure in rural communities that support our family farmers and ranchers.
Agriculture plays a critical role in America’s prosperity and national security. Farm Bills provide the certainty that our producers desperately need in the face of tremendous weather volatility, trade inequities, and global market swings. ...
Additionally, the final bill includes two amendments I introduced to strengthen access to healthcare for rural communities and allow universities like Texas Tech to compete for more agriculture-related research funding.
I am pleased that much of the House bill is reflected in our final legislation, including provisions to strengthen the agriculture safety net, make important investments in rural infrastructure, and improve the oversight and integrity of the Food Stamp program.
As the representatives of one of the largest agriculture production regions in the United States, no legislation is more important to West Texas than the Farm Bill.
After two years of hearings and meetings, as well as months of negotiations on the conference committee, I am excited to be sending a great #FarmBill to the President’s desk. https://t.co/chIElrKTj9

I expect the conference report to pass both the conference committee and House and Senate chambers within the next few weeks.
Even so, it was imperative we closed the deal in order to provide our producers with the economic certainty they so desperately need and so we don’t have to start over in the 116th Congress with Democrats writing the Farm Bill in a Pelosi-led House.
I am deeply disappointed that the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate made little effort to improve one of the largest welfare programs in the country, which, in its current form, has trapped millions of Americans in a cycle of government dependence.

The next step in reforming our budget and appropriations process is to encourage more fiscal responsibility by reducing deficit spending and our mountainous debt, which remains the challenge of the 21st Century and the greatest threat to the next generation.
That is why I am introducing a legislative fix with my colleagues, @RepDerekKilmer and @SenJoniErnst, to implement a “No Budget, No Recess” provision in our budgeting and appropriations process as a way to hold Congress accountable to the same standards as the American people.
It has been over 20 yrs since Congress passed all spending bills before the end of the new fiscal year. The failure of Congress to do its basic job of funding the government and instead rely on stopgap spending measures has created needless waste, disruption, and inefficiencies.
As families across America prepare to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday this week, Congress has once again prematurely closed shop, this time, with seven of the twelve spending bills still outstanding. https://t.co/Fq2bCznE2i

My legislation, currently awaiting a House vote, would prevent VA employees from spending 100% of their time at the VA on union activity. Should the House &amp; Senate pass this legislation &amp; it be signed into law, the VA would be able to apply this policy throughout the Department.
VA doctors should not be working on union duties when there are veterans waiting to be seen. Employees with the most expertise &amp; responsibility should be doing the job they were hired to do - not union business.

It’s time to change the culture within the VA so that our veterans receive the benefits they deserve and the care they need.
I believe that the root cause of these failures and the Department’s problems is unchecked bureaucracy. Veterans are now` paying the price for the VA's short-term fixes.
The vague answers, the delays, and the “we'll have it fixed” promises we've received from the VA about GI Bill benefit payment delays are unacceptable.		See below for thoughts from my last opening statement as Chairman of the VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee. ↓ https://t.co/DWRRBrCiY2
There is no doubt that the VA has some great people that work there, but the bureaucracy of the agency is hurting our veterans, not helping – there needs to be a refocus of the VA: serve our veterans, at all means necessary.

Farming is our heritage and remains our economic engine – with regulatory relief and strong farm policy, West Texans can keep this tradition thriving for years to come.

I believe this legislation accomplishes that goal and has the potential to save lives, and I am proud to have seen this pass the House last night.
We owe it to Bill and to all ‘who have borne the battle’ to do everything we can to prepare them for civilian life just as we have equipped them for their military careers.
If we do a better job supporting our servicemen and women on the front end of their transition to civilian life, we can reduce the number of veterans who struggle with unemployment, homelessness and suicide.
When our soldiers come home from war, it doesn’t mean the conflict for them is over. There is often a battle that continues to rage on inside of them. That is a big reason why each day we lose 20 veterans to suicide. https://t.co/p7DHIvvCsf

They arrested nearly 5,000 gang members, including 800 MS-13 members, and rescued over 1,500 victims of child exploitation and human trafficking.
ICE agents stop drug cartels, human traffickers, and murderous gangs along our border. In 2017 alone, ICE agents seized almost one million pounds of narcotics, including opioids, from entering our country.
Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our citizens, and crucial to that mission is the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
A great example of what happens when you cut red tape and lower the tax burden – consumers have more money in their pockets, businesses are able to grow, and communities flourish.

We must continue to focus on policies that grow our economy, not diminish it.
Not only would a carbon tax harm all Americans, it would especially harm middle and low-income families who use a large chunk of their paycheck on energy costs, and it would greatly impair the economic progress we have recently seen.
The U.S. has already made substantial strides in reducing carbon emissions. In fact, our nation leads the world in reducing carbon emissions – we have a reduction rate higher than the entire European Union.
For over a year and a half now, our economy has skyrocketed, and hardworking Americans are seeing more money in their pockets due to comprehensive, across-the-board tax cuts. The last thing our nation needs is a carbon tax increase. See below for a few of my thoughts ↓ https://t.co/dTraRhFP2h

His actions will prohibit taxpayer money, intended for family planning counseling, from being used to ‘perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion.’
Today I signed a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar thanking him for implementing new pro-life protections under the Department’s critical Title X family planning program. https://t.co/AvUnxBYUDJ

I had the pleasure of working with Judge Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley, a fellow West Texan, in the White House. Knowing Brett’s character and qualifications, I believe he is an outstanding choice whose absolute loyalty will be to the Constitution and Rule of Law.
As my favorite Justice, the late Antonin Scalia was fond of saying, the Court's job is to apply the Constitution, not write it. President Trump has once again fulfilled a central campaign promise to appoint such jurists by nominating Brett Kavanaugh.
In order for our democracy to work, our judges must interpret the Constitution - not according to their personal or political preferences - but as it was intended by our Founders when they wrote it.

How do you make America great again? Return to the Constitution, restore the Rule of Law, and renew our traditional, West Texas values.

In case you missed it, read my column below from Sunday’s edition of the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: 	https://t.co/r7o6Vit761
“A farming culture is ingrained in our country’s heritage, and with the passage of the House Farm Bill, we are one step closer to a stronger and more stable ag economy for the United States and a more prosperous future for West Texas and rural America for generations to come.”
In Albany, getting ready for the Fandangle. Go Lions! Go West Texas! https://t.co/Ty2GHDXZOf
As the House and Senate engage in negotiations on a final Farm Bill, I will continue fighting for West Texas and a strong and prosperous agriculture economy in the United States.
Additionally, as the Representative for the largest cotton producing region in the United States, I have concerns about an amendment that, if adopted in the final Farm Bill, would weaken market stability for U.S. cotton producers and manufactures.
With tremendous growth in our economy and millions of surplus jobs in America, there has never been a better time to promote the dignity of work and self-reliance.
Without requiring able-bodied adults to work to receive government assistance, we will continue trapping low-income Americans in a bleak cycle of government dependence and poverty instead of a bright future of prosperity and self-reliance.
However, I am disappointed the Senate did not address the long-overdue and much-needed reforms to the food stamp program, which accounts for roughly 80% of Farm Bill spending.
I commend the Senate for passing their version of the Farm Bill, which maintains many of the same provisions in the House Farm Bill, including a strong and reliable safety net and language similar to my House amendment to help sustain rural health care.
Farmers across America are struggling with the steepest decline in net farm income since the Great Depression. Without a strong Farm Bill delivered on time, they will not be able to continue feeding and clothing the American people and fueling our economy.
With Justice Kennedy’s retirement, President Trump has another opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise: to appoint justices who will interpret the Constitution as intended, not to rewrite it and legislate from the bench.
I wish Justice Kennedy a happy retirement. I am overjoyed at the historic opportunity for another appointment from President Trump and the generational impact a more conservative Supreme Court will have on the culture of this country.
As a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I will continue to monitor the progress of VA facilities across our district and work on legislation that ensures VA serves our veterans with the same level of care and service they gave us.

I commend the administration’s action and urge the Senate to take up my legislation that permanently makes these changes. Doing so will mean more small business can obtain affordable, patient-centered health care for years to come.
This week the Trump administration issued a rule to expand access to association health care plans, providing much-needed relief to these Main Street job creators. It is estimated that the new rule could lower premiums by $8,000 and provide coverage for over 400,000 people.

Fresh off of the House floor after casting my vote for the 2018 Farm Bill. It’s a great day for farmers and ranchers across West Texas! https://t.co/zY4wr37mAF
A farming heritage is ingrained in the very fabric of our country, and this Farm Bill will ensure that our farmers and ranchers have the support they need and keep farming part of America’s future.
America was pioneered and built by the grit, sweat, and determination of farmers throughout our great land.
Not having to rely on other countries for our basic needs is a matter of national security, and the biggest reason this Farm Bill is so important to all Americans.
Thomas Jefferson said agriculture was the ‘first and most precious of all the arts.’ Jefferson’s words reflect the self-evident truth that if we cannot feed and clothe our own people, we are no longer an independent, self-sufficient nation.
Our food stamp reforms increase accountability, reduce waste  and inefficiency, and - most importantly - break the cycle of government dependency and restore the dignity of work in this country.
The 2018 Farm Bill gives our producers much-needed certainty and stability, makes critical investments in rural infrastructure, and requires able-bodied adults to work in order to receive food stamps.
As a trillion-dollar industry, agriculture is 5.5 percent of our total economy and employs over 21 million people, including one out of every seven people in the great state of Texas.
Elizabeth Walker from Abilene is the epitome of a servant-leader and one who is well-deserving of the Congressional Award Gold Medal, which honors young Americans for service in their communities. Congratulations, Elizabeth - West Texas is proud! https://t.co/duJTnoN5MF https://t.co/xjI6EPNe0G
UPDATE ON THE UPCOMING IMMIGRATION VOTES: https://t.co/MndC2YaJSL

Yesterday, the House Budget Committee released our Budget for a Brighter America which will balance over the next nine years, achieve $8.1 trillion in deficient reduction, and cut at least $302 billion in mandatory spending over a ten-year period.

.@POTUS enforcing the laws as they are highlights how broken our immigration system is, and puts pressure on Congress to do its job. I joined @TeamCavuto today to discuss our nation's immigration policies and possible legislative reforms. ↓ https://t.co/z1cBji1jYG
Congress must act on legislation that funds border security, expedites deportation hearings, authorizes new detention facilities, and allows families to be kept together while waiting for court hearings.
We can administer both justice and mercy by ending ‘catch and release’ policies in order to deter illegal immigration, while at the same time, keeping families together - but it is Congress’ responsibility to change the law to do it.
...of our country as de facto residents. These Obama-era ‘catch and release’ policies not only circumvented our own immigration laws and undercut those who sought to respect them by waiting in line, but they exponentially increased illegal immigration over the years.
The word is out, if someone wants to bypass the legal immigration process of the United States, bring your children – even if you are risking their lives in the process – tell officials you fear for your lives, and you will be released into the interior...
The current situation at our border highlights the fundamental brokenness of America’s immigration system. The President is doing everything in his power with half of the tools and resources he needs to protect our citizens and enforce our laws.

In an era when faith in the system is waning, it is important the 115th Congress take steps to restore the confidence of our fellow citizens by fundamentally changing the status-quo of politics in Washington.	Read more about the legislation here. ↓	https://t.co/3XT3tguaiv
However, I believe it will help achieve a much-needed change in the current structure, one that’s necessary to evoke more courage in policy makers to solve the big problems and focus on the interests of the people who sent us here to serve.
Setting limits on the time politicians can serve in a particular office will not solve all the problems with Washington’s broken culture.
Following our bipartisan meeting with President Trump, and with his full support, we introduced this legislation to reflect both the intent of our Founders and the will of our citizens.
Today, I introduced, along with my fellow freshmen colleagues @RepBrianFitz , @RepRoKhanna, @RepGallagher, @RepGonzalez, and Rep. Gianforte, a Constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms an individual may serve as a Member of Congress.
From the beginning, @POTUS has led from a position of peace through strength. This WIN for America – freedom for three – displays the vigor &amp; integrity of our nation, one that reinforces the U.S.’s commitment to its people &amp; the “America First” policy. https://t.co/EzQI8njZmK

Today’s announcement by @POTUS sends a clear message that we will not be held hostage by the nuclear ambitions of a rogue and destabilizing regime. I applaud President Trump’s resolve and share his commitment that Iran not become a nuclear-armed state, not now, and not ever.

I always call Dyess a ‘crown jewel’ of West Texas, and today’s announcement gets us one step closer to cementing that jewel for the next generation, and beyond.
The Airmen stationed at Dyess are well-aware of the critical importance of their mission, and their commitment and resolve in carrying it out has long been a point of pride for both their superiors in the Air Force and their neighbors in the city of Abilene.
I am proud the Air Force recognized Dyess’ proven ability to command the skies by selecting our base to enter the final stage of the process to house  the next generation of bomber aircraft, the B-21 Raider. https://t.co/GwGAcE9y8Q
Through award-winning community support and the most capable Airmen in the Armed Forces, Dyess Air Force Base has uniquely positioned itself as an indispensable weapon in our national defense arsenal.

I am proud to have introduced the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William "Bill" Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement Act of 2018 . . .
Bill Mulder was a true American hero who served our country with honor and distinction. Like many of our troops, Bill’s greatest fight wasn’t on the battlefield, it was the struggle that often ensues from the mental, emotional, and physical wear and tear of military service. https://t.co/7xZOYhNepJ

If we do a better job equipping our servicemen and women on the front end of their transition, we can reduce the number of veterans who struggle with unemployment, homelessness, and suicide. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of intervention.

That being said, NAFTA must be renegotiated to allow for free and fair trade, and should be done before further addressing China’s unfair trade practices. NAFTA works for our producers, but it could work better.
The agriculture industry relies on trade for long-term success. Thirty five percent of farm income is derived from export sales and trade with Mexico and Canada under NAFTA account for $3.3 billion in economic activity.

The Farm Bill impacts more than just farmers. It impacts banking, the food industry, and rural economies across the nation – nearly every industry is touched by this legislation.
See the list below ↓ of Texas based companies giving tax cut bonuses, raises, and benefits. https://t.co/5lAhsW3276
470+ companies across the country are investing more in their employees because of #taxreform. That means additional CASH in the pockets of hard working Americans. Many of those companies are in Texas.
My family and I wish you a joyous Easter celebration! May God bless you and your family.

Now Congress can resume its work on behalf of our citizens to solve the problems facing our country - funding our military, securing our border, and reducing the cost of health care.
Nothing was gained by anyone, including DACA recipients, as a result of the Democrat shutdown. This was an enormous waste of the American people’s time and money.
I am glad to know Senate Democrats have retreated from their ill-conceived and outrageous demand we shut down our government, disrupt our military, and halt funding for other important obligations over amnesty for people who entered our country illegally.
