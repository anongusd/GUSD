Instead, @mridleythomas and I are proposing scrapping plans for CCTF and replacing it with new plans for a Mental Health Treatment Center— one run by our Dept of Health Services and staffed by @LACDMH mental health professionals.
I have been troubled by plans to replace the decrepit Men’s Central Jail with the Consolidated Correctional Treatment Facility aka a mental health jail.  While I believe it was well-intended, I do not believe a jail paradigm is compatible with mental healthcare.

I want LA County to be the place where if you HAVE to grow old anywhere— you will want to grow old in LA County!
It would allow us to not only better coordinate existing efforts — but give us the ability to be proactive in addressing everything from housing, mobility, health and mental healthcare, caregiving services, to independence and preventing social isolation.
Today I am proposing we create one new stand alone County department solely devoted to serving Los Angeles County’s huge and growing older adult population.
Right now— older adults are served in some way or another by most if not all of our @CountyofLA departments. But these efforts are fragmented and uncoordinated. We can do better.
This presents challenges. How can we serve a population facing mobility issues, dealing with more health challenges etc— and shape LA County into a place we can not only live comfortably but thrive?
LA County’s older adult population is skyrocketing. Our (yes— and I’m proud to be one of them) population is expected to double in the next ten years! (Short thread)

A zero-emission lane on the 710 freeway isn't a radical idea! The @portoflongbeach and @PortofLA are going to be zero emission by 2035! The Metro Board voted for a zero-emission bus fleet.  This is commonsense and the LEAST we could do for the communities along the 710.
The 710 freeway project was an opportunity to reduce pollution, reduce congestion, and finally separate cars and trucks.  It was an opportunity to build a freeway to the future.  The current plans for 5c fall short.  My goal today is to improve it. #MetroBoard #DieselDeathZone

My heart is with the students, teachers, and parents of Parkland, Florida and their families. The images and videos of terrified children are horrifying. 18th school shooting in this country this year. This is not normal.
We should be bold. We should show leadership. We should make the I-710 project one that is worth the decades our communities have had to wait.
Zero-Emissions is the future of our goods movement and we should insist on it as part of this project.
2. Dedicate one of the new lanes in each direction to Zero-Emissions vehicles only — complete with rechargeable roadway.
1. Change the Near-Zero Emissions Truck Technology Development Program to the ZERO Emissions Truck tech development program. And double the funding to $200 million.
Alternative 5c (the more conservative I-710 option) should and could be better. Today I am proposing improvements to 5c:
Happening now at Metro: Our communities deserve a bold, innovative I-710 project that improves congestion AND prioritizes air quality.

Today, I'm directing County Staff to draft a rent control ordinance for Mobile Home Parks with the goal of protecting residents from unfair &amp; unreasonable increases in rent, preserving affordable housing &amp; combatting our homeless crisis. https://t.co/NbhKBlyy3j
At a time when rent increases are forcing families into homelessness —  it is crucial the County step in and provide mobile home residents with a level of reasonable protections.
So-called “mobile homes” are often not mobile at all. When rents increase residents may be forced to sell their home to the mobile home park owner — often for far less than it is worth.
Mobile home residents often find themselves in an impossible situation. While they own their home, they rent the land it sits on.
Keeping people in their homes is the best strategy to fight the homelessness crisis. Today I am making the case for rent control at our Mobile Home Parks.

By simply changing this definition-- these victims will finally be able to access the aid they need to leave their abusers.
The House has just passed my legislation to update the definition of "homeless veteran" to include vets fleeing domestic violence!
By just updating a definition, my legislation will prevent victims from having to choose between staying with an abuser and homelessness.
For too long, an outdated definition has prevented vets fleeing domestic violence from accessing homeless aid. http://t.co/q2JlGhXIcf
In a few mins the House will vote on my legislation to extend aid to homeless veterans fleeing domestic violence. Confident it will pass!
