Every politician who has demanded Northam's resignation should themselves resign.  Why?  Because Northam stated the he is attempting to learn how those pictures appeared on his yearbook page.  To not give him a reasonable opportunity to do so is as as disgusting as the pictures.

What is wrong with this country? The sexual allegations regarding Kavanaugh are now irrelevant. The contempt that Kavanaugh displayed before the Senate Judiciary Committee should be a disqualifier among all decent Americans, regardless of their politics. https://t.co/Snu0l4RCgX.
@Rosie   Ms. O'Donnell, I write to thank you for your acknowledgment on Ari's show that our democracy remains an experiment.  I recently published a book of short political essays that tries to make the same point. You might be interested. See https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
@Max_Fisher Mr. Fisher, your article in today's NYT was brilliant.  Thank you.  On a more self-serving note, you seem to be the kind of person who would appreciate my new book of short political essays: "Toward A More Perfect Union", https://t.co/NUrMxZunrX. Cheers, Bruce.
The liberal press obsession with whether Trump's recent behavior constitutes treason is superfluous. Trump took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He should have been impeached the day he said the press is the enemy of the people.  https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
Dear Mr. President, why limit your selection of the next Supreme Court Justice to opponents of Roe v. Wade?  Why not ad to the list jurists who agree with the Dred Scott decision?  https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.

A real man stands up and takes responsibility for his actions. So by falsely blaming the Democrats for Trump's own child separation policy, Trump has proven that he isn't a real man. So maybe he doesn't have the equipment to have the illicit sexual affairs he is accused of.
@reneegwytherabq Thanks, Renee!!
@thehill No doubt Ken Starr, who bilked the country out of about $80 million over several years, would agree with Hypocrite McConnell.
See https://t.co/gMjRHkOrUJ.  There has been a lot of talk in the liberal news media about how Trump's anti-Mueller campaign is succeeding with the public.  But just you wait, Mr. Trump, until the report comes out.  Just you wait.  https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.

Re withdrawal from the JCPOA:  The talking heads who criticize withdrawal conveniently ignore that Iran never allowed inspection of its military facilities. Therefore, there was no way the ICEA ever could truthfully confirm that Iran was in compliance. https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.

@chucktodd Mr. Todd, today's Data Download impels me to tell you that I would be honored if you took a look at "Toward A More Perfect Union": https://t.co/NUrMxZunrX.  There is a brief description at https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.  Regards, Bruce Lieberman, balieberman@me.com.
Comey says in his book that he is not certain that what Trump has done is illegal. Has he considered that a daily violation of the president's oath of office is illegal?  https://t.co/xwsTzJmt3y.
Pelosi's comments about Ryan's resignation were very gracious but disingenuous: Ryan led the passage of a tax plan that lined the pockets of the rich and will bankrupt the country. He also served in Trump's harem of prostitutes.  https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
Depending on your politics, we all have different opinions as to whether Trump is the best or worst president we have ever had, or somewhere inbetween.  But there should be no doubt that he is by far the most disgusting president we have ever had. https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
If there ever were a reason for  Republicans to support efforts to impeach the president, it would be if Trump refused to fully support Theresa May by not implementing the sanctions already voted by Congress.  The oath of office of the US President is supposed to mean something.
As someone who relies mostly on CNN and CNBC for news, I was disgusted with their constant editorial criticism of Cohn's departure. Cohn was the principal cheerleader for Trump's tax plan.  He is no better than any of the other idiots in the White House. https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
@thehill This is sort of funny.  Why isn't Kushner paranoid for being an asshole?  https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.

@thehill That makes sense:  anyone with any sense of human decency should be trying to delegitimize the fake president.
@JeffFlake Senator Flake:  thank you for your tweet.  You seem to have an uncanny grasp of the obvious.
As for the pathetic Nunes memo, I think it would help if the people of Wisconsin reminded Paul Ryan that prostitution is still illegal in his state. https://t.co/btV8iAwLqE
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris Really?  Do you think the American public is being energized by a president and a party that is tossing away fundamental American values as if they were garbage?  A bread and circus approach to governing does not work over the long term.
@thehill How much of this grief could be avoided if the people of Wisconsin reminded Paul Ryan that prostitution is still illegal in that state?
Re that pathetic memo: Someone should tell Paul Ryan that prostitution is still illegal in most states.
@juliemason Hi Ms. Mason, Is there any way I can get you to read my new book, "Toward A More Perfect Union", which is right up your alley?  It can be found on Amazon at https://t.co/NUrMxZunrX.  I would be happy to send you a copy if you would like. Regards, Bruce Lieberman
https://t.co/j4xkLwNPkf . What troubles me most about this excellent editorial is that the true whores, like Paul Ryan, don't care. If they did, they wouldn't vote for any of the fake president's proposed legislation that wasn't the product of good faith bipartisan negotiation.

https://t.co/MyM0gEXRbB. Why is this such an important issue, when the real issue should be how do we get rid of the fake president?  https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
Forget about politics for a moment. On some issues conservatives have the better argument (especially after Obama). On other issues liberals have the better argument. But as a species, how can we us support a sick demented disgusting individual like Trump? https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs
https://t.co/zy99J5yPxR.   Interesting, but naïve.  What it is going to take is for Trump to become even more despicable so that, finally, enough of the deplorables (which now include a good part of Congress) will finally be done with him.

Let's talk about Putin for a moment: Putin is a recognized expert in jujitsu.  What could be greater evidence of this than the way he has taken Trump's psychotic need for self-aggrandizement and turned it against the United States? https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.

https://t.co/PXNcuvO8sr.    To all Trump voters: not voting for Hillary Clinton is entirely understandable.  Not demanding that Trump and his incestuous band of lying crooks be thrown out of Washington is unforgivable. https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.

Has anyone noticed that President Trump has seemed a little more presidential the last few weeks? Thank you, Generals Kelly and Mattis.
IMO, in the long run, this is far more threatening to US interests than North  Korea: https://t.co/ZO6QqlNTZa.
Congratulations to Lindsay Davenport and Madison Keys for Madison's unbelievable performance at the US Open.  Way to go!!!
See https://t.co/4s3o3wqAkM  If we don't start supporting the Kurds more against Turkey, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
@FranCifelli @NIVIsa4031 I don't know if it's comical, but I do know that she has no idea "What Happened". If you want, see https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
@maggieNYT Well thought out.
See https://t.co/jCeoHAMDyH. This is precisely where a competent president would be coordinating with Congressional leadership. But ....
@Thomas1774Paine Maybe  -  but neither would Jackson.
@lorihack_az Flake is running for president.  He is hoping that playing both sides will not be held against him.  He has some good ideas,  but only some.
See https://t.co/dghYXAUKve. A shining light in the darkness of partisanship.
See https://t.co/dxbUSZqoW8 . Telling or not telling the truth is a strategy???  This is shameful.
What a perfect time to appropriate money for this.  Right after Harvey.  Sigh. https://t.co/zKEBSFFLps
@LDavenport76 You are doing a great job with Madison.  Way to go!
The obstruction issue is not going away.  Hopefully, it will be resolved in months - not years. https://t.co/rgDhkCtF1W
@HouseGOP No.
I would hope that folks of all political persuasions would agree that Trump's tax returns should be released. https://t.co/kVrmwnftjP
Pro Trump? Anti-Trump? This is well-balanced and worth reading: https://t.co/096BBpMsRa.  See also https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
Here we go.  The blame game has started:  https://t.co/tCtl5BXPnp.
See  https://t.co/bOa24ZwreV.  Good, but a little too complex. More effective would be to shoot down DPRK missiles wen they are launched.
Trump almost has it right: https://t.co/sPhsWRaW2B. There should be talks, but initiated by DPRK after a few more missiles are shot down.
Re voting: Many Reps want to reduce minority voting participation, and many Dems don't see a need for IDs. They're both wrong.
@WashTimes If the commission was created to investigate Trump's false assertion re the number of fraudulent votes, why is the US paying for it?
@dcexaminer This program deserves as much funding as it needs.

I am neither Catholic nor a fan of Sean Spicer.  However, I do think there is justice in this.  See https://t.co/16NRtYdUTX'
@HouseGOP How about a commitment to work with the folks across the aisle?  I know this is a radical idea, but I think you owe it to the country.
@mr_mookie @W7VOA @nhk_news One miss and we learn from that.
Have you seen https://t.co/gZJArxYbDG?  If this is true, my hope that Ivanka would be going her own way is seriously undermined.  Sigh.
@W7VOA @nhk_news Again, there are only two solutions: 1) accept DPRK as a nuclear state; or 2) take out the missiles when they are launched.  I vote for #2.
This makes impeccable sense. https://t.co/Ano5QG15TV
America needs/ More serious leadership / From honest people
@GregAbbott_TX @Cynthiastruth Wouldn't it be nice If members of Congress could learn to cooperate and work together like this?  There is a lesson to be learned here.
A thought: Cong. bipartisanship after the shooting of Rep.  Scalise already has gone by the wayside. What will it take to come together?
@PaulTonko @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Isn't it now time for Congress to put a limit on the the funds allocated for presidential vacations?   Enough is enough.
There is definitely a liberal media bias.  But that bias has been increased substantially as the consequence of Trump's incessant lying. https://t.co/ExYcZkf7uE
@HouseGOP You are definitely correct. But do you have the fortitude to do the right thing and confer with your Democratic colleagues?
@thehill No, all she did was meet with Hillary's husband during the FBI investigation.
@DailyCaller @JonathanTurley His logic is questionable.  Obama's overreaching is not the same thing as demeaning the office of the presidency.
@bpolitics I am conflicted re Merkel's decision, but there can be no question that she is a very principled leader.
RT @bpolitics: Merkel stands by her decision to open Germany's border to an influx of refugees in 2015 https://t.co/IGnqd01KBt https://t.co…
See https://t.co/9AhP1NGZJt. Whether you agree with the  pardon or not, this is entirely specious reasoning.
It sounds like justice was done at little cost to the State of New Mexico.  Hoping the officer's injury will heal quickly. https://t.co/cswvZyOcAB
@bartonswaim An early sign of literary talent!
@EdwardLuttwak Mr. Luttwak, I would like to send you a copy of my new book (see https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs). Please advise if interested. Thx.
@bartonswaim PS: re "Toward a More Perfect Union": I would be more than happy to FedEx a copy to you.  Thanks again.  @BALieberman2017
@bartonswaim Mr. Swaim, please consider reviewing my new book (see https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs). It is right in your wheelhouse. Many thanks.
@thehill "Contempt" implies thoughtful conduct.  It is not clear to me that thinking is part of Trump's repertoire.  Many good conservatives agree.
@mad_cotten Excellent!  Bravo!
There are two legitimate sides to how to deal with Egypt.  See Part 2, Chapter 9, https://t.co/NUrMxZunrX. https://t.co/I7GXahBDbq
Giving credit where credit is due: I am in favor of establishing closer ties with India at the expense of Pakistan. General Mattis's idea? https://t.co/0LPMbcXDOK
@politicalwire Possibly.  But an alternative explanation is that Trump simply has a compulsive need to be loved; ergo, he simply panders to his base.
@ProuzaTomas @SamDoesPolitics I wonder if the increased public bickering in the EU Is related, or the consequence of, the current divisiveness in the US. Just a thought.
@coton_luver @SamDoesPolitics For better or worse, the voters - not the media - elected Trump.  Please see https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs.
@sehwsj @siobhanehughes @WSJ Congratulation, Paul.  Continue playing both sides.  It really makes you look like an honest politician.
A thought: Trump's pandering to his base is criticized as politically unwise. But Trump doesn't care about politics; he needs to be loved.
@SallyQYates Sally, I entirely agree. However, the pardon of Arpaio is no more morally disgusting than Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich.
@USNWCMuseum @NavalWarCollege Teddy Roosevelt read every word he wrote.   Mahan's writings greatly influenced Roosevelt's desire to have a strong naval presence.
@RepBera I would be more sympathetic to the ban if so many countries had not  already determined that the military is fine with these men and women.
First Bannon, now Gorka.  If General Kelly doesn't fire Stephen Miller next, it will be a real shocker.
@W7VOA It seems to me we either 1) accept DPRK as a nuclear state; or 2) shoot down their missiles when they're launched.   I vote for (2).
Enough Trump voters are sufficiently embarrassed that the Dems could make some real gains. But NOT if the party keeps moving to the left.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the folks on the Gulf  Coast – especially the brave men and women in the police, fire and rescue units.
Re: https://t.co/8k5xRw0Pxo.  Proving Trump is the complete unTeddy Roosevelt president.
@marklevinshow Most of the time I relate more to the liberal media; but I do wish more of them had the intellectual honesty to admit their liberal bias.
@tombrokaw @johnmdonnelly Tom, better would have been: "Mr. Fake President".
Re Hillary's new book, "What Happened".  No, Hillary, you don't know what happened.  Please read https://t.co/NUrMxZcMAp.
@iowapoliticsnow I admired Corker until he bailed on the Iran deal and then tried to walk a tightrope re Trump.  Maybe he is now redeeming himself.
I say this as a former prosecutor: every time Trump says he does not want Mueller to succeed, he is potentially obstructing justice.
The press assumes that when Trump is off script, you see the real Trump. Maybe. But it's equally possible  that's another fake Trump.
@smartflexin @SamDoesPolitics Possibly, but there are other valid explanations.  See Part 1 of my new book "Toward a More Perfect Union" at https://t.co/UOFGfoxtFa.
I wasn't able to watch Trump's rant last night; but from what I've read, Trump managed to dig an even bigger hole for himself. Excellent!
@PatrickWalker @nielslesniewski @SenDeanHeller That assumes no delay caused by Congress's efforts to remove Trump and/or Trump's resignation.
Leaving today for a reunion of Contra Costa County Cal. Dist. Attorneys and Assistant and Deputy Dist. Attorneys.  We had a great office.
A president can be removed from office when he is "unable to discharge the...duties of his office". Doesn't so demeaning the office qualify?
@thehill Excellent!
Re my previous tweets: one does not have to be a liberal in order to be disgusted with Trump's incessant dishonesty.
@RepLizCheney Liz, my dear, it was a very good speech that made a lot of sense.  But do you really think the fake president can  do more than bloviate?
Re Trump's speech: the fake president actually sounds reasonable when somebody writes his stuff and he is before a teleprompter. Sigh.
Paul Ryan, you hypocrite:, beware: "you can fool some of the people some of the time,.but you cannot fool all the people all the time, etc."
What better way for Trump to deflect attention from last week's pathetic performance than to rally around the military tonight.
@rachaelmbade @SpeakerRyan Regrettably, someone like Ryan who tries to straddle both sides of the fence with Trump is likely to pretend that he  understands you.
@W7VOA @USNavy Twice this year!  Hopefully, but unlikely, the missing sailors will be found alive.
@DailyCaller Perhaps, but that is a gorgeous picture.
@JeffFlake @facebook Senator, with all respect, I believe my new book " Toward a More Perfect Union (https://t.co/NUrMxZunrX), may be as timely as yours.
@RanttNews Very well said.  The ironic part is that so many people think (wrongly) that he is intelligent.
The Failing Trump Presidency https://t.co/wYB7cg1AXg.  I must disagree.  The editorial assumes a level of intent that Trump sorely lacks.
@keithellison Keith, of course you're correct, but don't you realize that the country is not helped when you help lead the Democrats away from the center?
A comic genius and a great philanthropist.  We have lost a truly wonderful person. https://t.co/Axg1jfB2yk
@seanhannity @RhondajlacyLacy Sean, do you really think that a purveyor of tabloid journalism like yourself should have his tweets taken seriously?
@GeorgeTakei Well said.  Freedom of speech also does not mean freedom to incite violence.
Q. How does Trump  attempt to regain national support?	A.  He starts a major crisis with China and North Korea.	   Republicans: do you hear?
Adam Schiff  said today it is premature to consider removing Trump. Maybe. But it is not premature to round up his Republican colleagues.
That should have been "comes".
If Trump were a samurai and recognized his dishonor, well, you know what come next....
Invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump might have more support among your Republican colleagues than you realize.  Give it a try. https://t.co/fjGxTIyivA
@donnabrazile True. But you don't think  you are partially responsible for Hillary Clinton losing the election?
@Jonesie1967 @FoxNews Lack of remorse is irrelevant and inadmissible. The threat itself may be a crime under the federal statutes, but not for lack of remorse.
@FoxNews Criminal charges for refusing to apologize?   That is about as Nazi as the Nazis whom you (and I) hate.
You're speaking about the man who will pardon Trump after Trump resigns or is removed from office. Is it really surprising what Pence does? https://t.co/x7GzdIpkX4
@RealJamesWoods You are right, James.  There is a liberal bias to most of the mainstream media.  But it is not the media that gave us a fake President.
If Trump resigns, he might very well be indicted.   Will he strike a deal with Pence  to be pardoned? https://t.co/zvSefhoR3L
With so many tweets  from Congresspersons out there, I am surprised there is almost no discussion of the 25th Amendment.
Celebrate ethnic diversity and support Trump at the same time?  Come on, Senator. https://t.co/DfHPs1YrPQ
Republicans remain stymied over what to do about Trump https://t.co/qG7rPEX4Yz. But not one mention of Trump's inability to tell the truth.
Agreed, but part of the problem is 24/7 news coverage. That format virtually requires that anything arguably "newsworthy" be reported. https://t.co/PG3IXy2CSs
I consider myself basically a liberal; but there has got to be a better way to come together than  tearing down statutes.

Thank you very much.  If you are interested, you may want to check out https://t.co/Eam69lBqGs. Cheers!
Can someone explain to me why all the TV "pundits" who opine on how Congress can remove Trump fail to mention the 25th Amendment? Thank you.
Re Bannon firing: it's the same as Trump's teleprompter comments about Charlottesville.  Trump has to be told what's the right thing to do.
In the spirit of national unity, we should adopt Trump's method of using language.  Let's start by referring to him as the fake President.
