@wildbez @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 How about the birther movement? That was pretty racist.
@wlaplant2 @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC That’s why nobody actually wants real socialism. If you’ll actually read that last tweet, you’ll see that I already mentioned that.
@mnHomeLoanInfo @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Lots of other replies have already answered that question. Pretty much all of Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have successful social democratic policies.
@Slang3006 @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Well the rich ones are. But there are a lot of sheep who don’t know any better and just don’t believe it.
@Ravens_Thunder @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Every planet? Care to show me a source? Because I’ve heard about the moon and Mars warming, and neither of those warming patterns have anything to do with the sun.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The world laughs at all of you Republicans every time Trump opens his mouth. We aren’t respected anymore. We’re a laughing stock.
@BeetlesMomma @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC You're going to have to provide some evidence that larger populations make it harder for this to work before you use that to make your point.
@trickyman007 https://t.co/xUn2Z613tl		You'll notice that many of these other countries actually rank higher on the Human Freedom Index, which is run by a libertarian think-tank, so you can't just dismiss this as liberal propaganda.
@trickyman007 @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC The people who usually say this are the same people who think that Middle Eastern refugees should stay in their home countries and fix them.
@ElkaSelzer @Dawn_Rivera @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC If your definition of "socialism" is just things that are publicly funded, then we already do socialism. Social security, Medicare and Medicaid, emergency services such as firemen, and many other things. Every country in the world is socialist under your definition.
@yepsuzn @WFmerica @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Katie Hopkins is a racist quack. 		She's criticizing people for "voting on their religion," when that's exactly what many Christians do too. 		I grew up around a lot of Muslims. My high school graduating class was about 5-10% Somali. They're good people, just like the rest of us.
@KerryV_KAG @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC I'm sorry, but where did any of us claim that those countries are socialist?
@cpnovelas @FiestyLiberal75 @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC And when only a few people actually have any power? Because that's what happens when wealth accumulates at the top, leading to more and more poor people and a dwindling middle class. That's not a good system.
@KerryV_KAG @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Thank you for proving my point. This article says the exact same thing I've been saying all day: WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT IS NOT SOCIALISM.
@yepsuzn @WFmerica @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC "The Muslim thing?" What Muslim thing?
@WFmerica @yepsuzn @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC I never said they did. Why is it that all of you have such terrible reading comprehension? I said they've changed the definition of the word "socialism" to include basically anything they don't agree with.
@cpnovelas @MaridanceDB @FiestyLiberal75 @charliekirk11 @AOC Not my values, nor the values of millions of other Americans. We want an America that values all its people, not just the rich. One that takes care of its citizens and doesn't let them go bankrupt over medical issues.
@ElkaSelzer @Dawn_Rivera @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC That's exactly why I said "publicly-funded" instead of "free."		Sorry to ruin your little gotcha moment, but I see you didn't mind trying to go for it anyway.		But to my previous question: if you think that's socialism, then you must think that Europe and Canada are socialist.
@cpnovelas @MaridanceDB @FiestyLiberal75 @charliekirk11 @AOC No. My opinions on how this country should be run are just as valid as yours. I love it here, and I want to help make America even better.
@cpnovelas @MaridanceDB @FiestyLiberal75 @charliekirk11 @AOC I find it funny that the people who usually say that are also the people who say, "Well why can't those immigrants stay and improve their own countries?"
@r_d_holman @cnedelea @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Probably not. Most of them don't seem to. They just hear "70% income tax" and think that literally means we want to take 70% of everybody's income.
@ElkaSelzer @Dawn_Rivera @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Publicly-funded healthcare and education, yes.
@MaridanceDB @SacTaxiDave @charliekirk11 @AOC Do you understand how many countries have had universal healthcare for decades now without devolving into communism? Apparently you don't have the best grasp on history either.
@MaridanceDB @SacTaxiDave @charliekirk11 @AOC You don't seem to be learning from the present. Many of the most successful countries in the world right now are all "socialist" under your twisted definition of the word.
@ElkaSelzer @Dawn_Rivera @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC So in your opinion, most of Europe and Canada are socialist countries?
@ElkaSelzer @Dawn_Rivera @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Jesus Christ...		Us: "We don't want socialism. We just want the programs that other first-world capitalist democracies have."		All of You: "gEt OuT oF hErE wItH yOuR sOcIaLiSm!!"
@Dawn_Rivera @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Do any of you people actually ever read what I'm saying? WE DO NOT WANT SOCIALISM IN AMERICA.
@MaridanceDB @MichaelGarry11 @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC He's just giving an example of a country with a better healthcare system, since you seem so convinced that ours is best. It's actually a very relevant point.
@MaridanceDB @RoyalSlade1965 @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC I said "Nobody is advocating for full on socialism." Once again, work on that reading comprehension.
@MaridanceDB @RoyalSlade1965 @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC Me: "There are so many examples of successful social democracies."	You: "Name one"		Those are direct quotes. I think your reading comprehension needs some practice.
@JustifiedbyJC @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC There are already many social programs in the US. It wasn't a slippery slope in the past. So why is it going to be a slippery slope in the future?
@MaridanceDB @RoyalSlade1965 @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC You told us to name successful social democracies. So that's exactly what we've done.
@graytwinsmom @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC We're not talking about socialist countries. We're talking about social democracies like Canada, the UK, Norway, Switzerland, etc.
@MaridanceDB @SylviaMargarit4 @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC Funny you mention Venezuela. Do you know what party our buddy Juan Guaido represents? The Popular Will party, which is a social democratic party. 		If Guaido was running for office in America, you'd attack him for being a "socialist."
@SylviaMargarit4 @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC These so-called "no-go zones" have less to do with the religion of the locals and more to do with their economic situation. Dangerous neighborhoods exist everywhere that rampant poverty exists, no matter who lives there.
@ConstituteBeer @MaridanceDB @mantalicious @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC https://t.co/zB1T32E6j6		And another one.
@ConstituteBeer @MaridanceDB @mantalicious @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC https://t.co/9GqPLVuwhS		And another one.
@ConstituteBeer @MaridanceDB @mantalicious @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC https://t.co/MLPMgDQeD0		And another one.
@ConstituteBeer @MaridanceDB @mantalicious @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC https://t.co/keYosStjm9		Alright. Here's another source.
@Katie_Rae45 @hanneori599 @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Yes. All of them are capitalist. So why are democrats being called socialists for wanting to be like those countries? You guys keep making my point for me. 		And btw, the US has plenty of natural resources too.
@MaridanceDB @mantalicious @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC They don’t have to run to France. Mexico is closer. 		https://t.co/CoLHfGrvCa
@GingerMemeBoi @yepsuzn @Casey_tweeter @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC In this case, Republicans don’t know better either.
@mantalicious @MaridanceDB @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC Important note: “People who need emergency surgery or treatment receive it without delay.”
@MaridanceDB @janineyve @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC This is exactly how this argument is going with you. The only difference is that I never claimed Norway was socialist.
@MaridanceDB @janineyve @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC https://t.co/7fUfOx5dXx
@janineyve @MaridanceDB @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC Nobody is saying you are. How do you not understand our point yet?
@janineyve @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC EXACTLY! They aren't socialist, and neither are democrats.
@MaridanceDB @janineyve @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC How do you still not understand this: DEMOCRATS AREN'T SOCIALIST EITHER!
@bibleman1976 @KamalaHarris "The main character in the last chapter fulfilled EVERY prophecy of the first chapter! That's crazy! It must be real!"		Listen man, I'm a Christian too, but you can't use the Bible to prove that the Bible is fact. Especially because it's not fact. It's mostly allegory.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 Yeah, she's one of the ones who've given up on correcting people and just embraced the new meaning of socialism. In reality, she's a social democrat.
@janineyve @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Um, yes. Each of those countries is a perfect example of what Democrats want for America.
@cnedelea @HomerOnLSD @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC It looks like you're telling a German what kind of economy Germany has.		Nobody believes Germany is a socialist country. It's not. None of the countries we've listed are, and that's exactly our point:		Social Democracy != Socialism.		Democrats != Socialists.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 The Forbes article supports the idea that countries with these ideas can still be mostly capitalist. Democrats don't want to get rid of capitalism either.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 It's the right that has twisted the meaning of socialism to include everything they don't like, and unfortunately some Democrats have just embraced the distorted meaning and claim to support "socialism" when they really don't.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 Us: "We want the same programs they have in social democracies like Sweden and Norway."		You: "So YoU'rE a sOcIaLiSt?!"		Also you: "Sweden and Norway aren't actually socialist. Checkmate libruls."
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 I love that you guys keep using this article as proof we're wrong, when it just proves my point that Democrats aren't socialists either.
@cnedelea @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Exactly. None of them are socialist. Which means that Democrats aren't socialists either. After all, we just want what they have in those countries.
@XRPMAGA @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC I don't mind paying higher taxes for more programs to assist the poor and the people in general.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 Not the final ban, no, but that isn't what we're talking about. We're talking about his initial plan. The one that called for "a total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States."
@bibleman1976 @KamalaHarris The Bible isn't proof of anything. It's just a book that was written thousands of years ago.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 I've seen other people claim that other countries are moving away from their social programs, but nobody linked any source for that. Would you care to, so I know what you're talking about?
@T_Ritious @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Why? I love it here in America. I just want to help fix the flaws we have as a country.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 Wrong? 		"Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States."		There was literally video of him saying that right in the article. How can you possibly spin that as wrong?
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 That's not even remotely accurate. What we're trying to do is akin to teaching him the concept of being nice to everybody.
@MaridanceDB @FiestyLiberal75 @charliekirk11 @AOC Democrats want what they have in all of the other countries we've listed, and many of them actually rank higher on the Human Freedom Index (from the CATO Institute, which is run by libertarians, so don't dismiss it as leftist propaganda).		https://t.co/xUn2Z613tl
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 The concept of social democracy is not incompatible with our system of government. It's not a form of government at all, which means it can be a part of all of these other countries as well as ours.
@FrankRose17 @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC And you can look up how many Americans go to Mexico for their medical care, especially for dental work. And how many Americans go to Canada to buy their prescription drugs that are way too expensive here.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 Which part of that was naive? The quote from the president? The fact that US gun violence is a far greater problem than other developed countries have? 		Are you ever going to back up your own point, or are you just only going to try to shoot down the other side?
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 He didn't do it, but he definitely did call for it. 		https://t.co/6QVhpneBzz
@yepsuzn @WFmerica @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SAYING! Bernie isn't really a socialist either. Republicans have twisted the definition of that word to the point where even some Democrats are falling for it and have started describing themselves as socialists when they really aren't.
@yepsuzn @Casey_tweeter @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SAYING! Bernie isn't really a socialist either. Republicans have twisted the definition of that word to the point where even some Democrats are falling for it and have started describing themselves as socialists when they really aren't.
@MaridanceDB @WFmerica @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC I have done research on this. Wait times aren't actually that bad in most places. If you really need an operation soon, you get it.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 7) If you had a child with behavior issues, would you also say, "you don't try to fundamentally change something you love?" No. You'd try to fix the issues BECAUSE you love them and want them to be the best version of themselves.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 6) We don't support socialism. We support social democracy, which you may recognize in just about every other developed country in the world, including Canada, the UK, Finland, Germany, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, etc.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 5) First of all, illegal immigrants are essential to our farming and construction industries, but even ignoring that, calling for common sense border security instead of an ineffective wall is not the same as supporting illegal immigration or open borders.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 4) We hate the Constitution? We seem to be the only party who supports the checks and balances enshrined in it. Republicans don't ever want to check the power of our president, who loves to push the limits of his powers and praises dictators.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 3) Who hates the third amendment? Honestly? Has anybody in recent history actually even been affected by it?
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 2) No Democrat actually wants to ban all guns. But we do have a problem with gun violence that no other developed country has, and we are just looking for ways to solve that.		Also, remember this? "https://t.co/M90gI606OC"
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 1) You claim we hate the first amendment, when your president is the one who calls the media "the enemy of the people" and has inspired actual attacks on said media. Also, he did say he wanted to ban an entire religion from entering the country. That goes directly against the 1A.
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 This might be the record for most incorrect information I've ever seen packed into one tweet, so it's going to take me a few replies to make you understand.
@JoshuaJPatula @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC How do you not see that each of these countries has exactly what Democrats are pushing for? Universal healthcare, in some cases universal college, and many of those countries have begun experimenting with universal basic income.
@WFmerica @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC 1) Do you have a source for them cutting back on those programs? I haven’t heard anything about that. 		2) They pay more in taxes, but they also get more from their government. Nobody in those countries ever goes bankrupt from medical bills, for example.
@MaridanceDB @BobDergay @charliekirk11 @AOC Better do your research. Democrats are social democrats, which is also not socialism. Our policy ideas are the same as those countries. We aren’t trying to get rid of capitalism or democracy. That’s only what the right wants you to believe.
@byteme1944 @BobDergay @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Exactly! They aren’t socialist! And neither are the Democrats’ policies. It’s called social democracy, and it works!
@ScottWalker @JayInslee @AOC Do you actually misunderstand the point of the #GreenNewDeal, or are you intentionally being misleading again?		Wanting to invest in other measures to make air travel more obsolete is not the same as wanting to ban airplanes.
@MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Canada
@GallantStreams @MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC Right... because all those other countries with universal healthcare are right on the brink of real socialism. 		But wait, they aren’t.
@Rolling16258443 @charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr @AOC Republicans
@meyla1965 @charliekirk11 @AOC Then you should be aware that no democrat is actually pushing for real socialism.
@MaridanceDB @charliekirk11 @AOC There are so many examples of successful social democracies like what Democrats want America to be. Nobody is actually advocating for straight up socialism.
@Paul34388010 @charliekirk11 @AOC The left doesn’t want socialism. We want social democracy, which absolutely works. It’s what the rest of the developed world has.
@Rolling16258443 @charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr @AOC Is that why you people usually shy away from it?		Nobody is trying to make America a socialist country. Unless you consider Norway or Canada socialist countries. But if you do, then you don’t know what you’re talking about.
@LTC_Pirate @metrikk @wymow_ @charliekirk11 @AOC Just about every other developed country manages to pay for these social programs just fine. So why shouldn’t we be able to? Are we not the richest country on Earth?
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr @AOC Democrats aren’t trying to turn America into a socialist country. Stop with the fear mongering. 		Also, Juan Guaidó is a social democrat. If he were American, you’d be attacking him for being “socialist” too.
@TheOne41262571 @Dan_Donovan_17 @AOC “Disastrous economic policies,” he says about states with two of the largest economies on Earth.
@EricFasci @SenateDems Haha 80% of scientists think there’s no evidence of evolution? Thank you for making my day already with the most ridiculous argument I’ve ever heard.
@Dan_Donovan_17 @AOC Yeah but more people voted for Hillary than for “the wall.” And then more people voted Democrat in the midterms too, partially because we don’t want the wall.
@HM2099 @AOC You know Democrats aren’t actually socialists, right? Social Democracy is not socialism.
@realDonaldTrump What’s the over/under on total number of verifiable lies he tells?
@OkButNo10 @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 How do we hate this country?
@wildbez @DombyGallery @charliekirk11 I’m sorry, but supporting a man so lacking in any morals whatsoever, and who’s as bigoted as Trump is, is a very immoral and indecent thing to do. We need a President who we can respect again. One who has class and actually cares about the American people.
@EricFasci @SenateDems The fossil record? Observations of evolution in action in insect species? The entirety of taxonomic and genetic studies? None of that means anything to you? Evolution is very much a real thing. As is climate change.
@c_davisec @SenateDems Why not? They aren’t being paid to study it. In fact, insurance companies would love for climate change not to exist. It’s causing their claims to increase.
@c_davisec @SenateDems That sure is a lot of evidence you have there. Would you care to prove your claim, or just keep denying the facts?
@DonaldJTrumpJr I must've missed it. Can anyone tell me what she said this time? And is it actually antisemitic, or is it overblown like that last time with her "all about the benjamins" comment?
@c_davisec @SenateDems Mars is undergoing natural climate change yes, largely due to the same cycles in orbit that have changed Earth's climate in the past. However, those cycles are insufficient to explain the warming we are experiencing now on Earth.
@EricFasci @SenateDems What exactly does that say about my philosophy? That I don’t blindly trust the word of a book from thousands of years ago over hard evidence?
@c_davisec @SenateDems If you don’t believe the experts, that’s your problem. Would you believe the insurance companies?		https://t.co/JMgf26GFNh
@c_davisec @SenateDems I didn’t make anything up, but nice try. 		https://t.co/emcfOe3uq4
@rebjack18 @FamilyInternet @SenateDems @AOC @SHSanders45 @JordanSekulow @robertjeffress https://t.co/90Rly4eJUy
@c_davisec @SenateDems Who? 97% of climate scientists agree that it is real, and we cause it. On top of that, other industries such as insurance companies and the Department of Defense have done lots of research on how climate change is going to effect them.
@BrentAnderson99 @turningaphrase @amyklobuchar Is this the same effort that Trump didn’t know about when asked about it?
@rebjack18 @FamilyInternet @SenateDems @AOC @SHSanders45 @JordanSekulow @robertjeffress But climate change is happening no matter what you people believe.
@BrentAnderson99 @amyklobuchar I can’t believe anyone is still criticizing Obama for golf considering that Trump golfs way more.
@BrentAnderson99 @amyklobuchar I know that other world leaders made it there. So why couldn't Donald?
@miamivandynyu @RonTiger36054 @guypbenson @brithume You can have universal health care without making doctors work for the government. Can you point me to where this proposal suggests that'll be the case?
@RonTiger36054 @guypbenson @brithume Do doctors work minimum wage in the rest of the developed world that has universal healthcare? I don't think so.
@guypbenson Universal healthcare works very well in every other developed country. How much longer are Republicans going to plug their ears and shut their eyes to reality. Ask anyone in Europe if they'd rather have our healthcare system. They wouldn't.
@KarolynsKorner @SenateDems I have studied up. I’ve literally taken a class on this.
@theblaze @tedcruz You know who else would be a “crazy socialist” here, Ted? Our buddy Juan Guaidó in Venezuela. 		The only thing is that you Republicans keep framing your support of him as a fight against socialism. 		So which one is it? Are Democrats socialists, or is socialism actually ok?
@BrentAnderson99 @amyklobuchar If president trump supported the troops, he wouldn’t use them for political stunts at the border, and he wouldn’t have waited two years to go visit them overseas. And he wouldn’t have canceled on the memorial ceremony over in Europe because of the rain.
@EricFasci @SenateDems No actually we don’t come from monkeys. Monkeys and humans both come from the same ancestor who was neither human nor monkey.
@EricFasci @SenateDems The planet is still warming on average, so Global Warming isn’t incorrect. However the term climate change includes all of the other changes that the warming will cause, as well as the few localized cooling trends.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Huckabee should do another one of these about all the lies his daughter tells to the American people every time she opens her mouth.
@c_davisec @SenateDems I get that some people still don’t acknowledge 2, but for anyone to deny the first point is ridiculously ignorant.
@Paulalovestruth @SenateDems You’re saying that it’s not real at all? Not just that humans don’t cause it, but that it literally isn’t happening?
@McPig514 @SenateDems You wise up. Humans are the driving factor behind the current changes is climate. That’s what all the current evidence suggests.
@thoughtsof37 @SenateDems Humans contribute more to it than the natural factors that usually change the climate.
@KarolynsKorner @SenateDems Humans are the PRIMARY factor behind the current climate change.
@FamilyInternet @SenateDems @AOC @SHSanders45 @JordanSekulow @robertjeffress Did you actually just deny it outright? Not even just that humans are causing it, but that it isn’t happening at all?
@KCChiefsUpNorth @SenateDems Literally none of that is true, bud.
@EricFasci @SenateDems You can’t quote the Bible to dispute science. It doesn’t work like that.
@BrentAnderson99 @amyklobuchar That’s just another All Lives Matter situation. While technically a good message to support, it completely ignores the issue on hand.
@nickyscarfo8 @KamalaHarris Democrats respect California. I respect California. They are doing good things over there, and they’re one of the top economies in the world. 		As for China and India, at least they signed onto the Paris agreement.
@DombyGallery @charliekirk11 Any decent conservative has already distanced themselves from the Republican Party. I know plenty who have. 		Anyone who still stands behind Trump however, there’s no excuse for them. They’re either insane or immoral.
@nickyscarfo8 @KamalaHarris Do you think it’s just California that’s warning us about climate change? It’s not. It’s people from all around the world. And many Californians are trying to fix their pollution problems, but Republicans criticize all of their attempts to do so.
@mmillalpha @SenBobCasey We don’t need to kiss ass for evil people to avoid war.
@Grizzly_Stevens @KamalaHarris @girlfrmtheisles They can be partially, and they have been in the past. But the evidence just doesn’t support the idea that natural factors are the primary reason behind the current changes.
@VP Juan Guaidó is a social democrat just like Bernie and AOC. If Guaidó was running for office in America, you’d be calling him a socialist.
@VP Is Norway a socialist country? What about Canada?		They’re not, so stop implying that Democrats are socialists when we just want to be more like other devolved countries.
@rickshaw00 @SenatorMenendez Otto was imprisoned in the last year of Obama’s term. You can’t honestly have expected any president to get him released from North Korea within 9 months.
@Kansei13Kansei @SenatorMenendez He could’ve said hundreds of better things:		“We’re still looking into the matter.”		“We’re hoping that continued investigation alongside the North Korean authorities will lead us to an answer.”		etc. 		But instead it’s “I will take him at his word.”
@politico @DonaldJTrumpJr “Biggest supporter of religious liberty”:		*tries to ban Muslims from entering the country*		Give me a break.
@P_Missile @SenatorTomUdall @POTUS “increased enforcement of our immigration laws is not a good way to prevent murders.”
@P_Missile @SenatorTomUdall @POTUS Nobody should have to suffer from any of that at the hands of anybody, not just illegal immigrants (who by the way, commit crimes at a lower rate than US citizens).		https://t.co/zU3JrH0td9
@SnStell @SenatorTomUdall @POTUS You realize that most illegal immigrants pay taxes too, don’t you?
@DamonTrahan2 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Congress is not the military. I fully expect every member of Congress to call any president out on their bullshit publicly. 		We the people have a right to know when our politicians fuck up.
@Dan_Tognetti @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So you think we should just ignore all the bad things Trump does instead of calling him out on them? 		And what about all the hate that comes from the Trump administration? Do you condemn that too?
@nickyscarfo8 @KamalaHarris Yeah. If you want to live in a warmer place, move to a warmer place. Don’t damage the environment just to make your hometown warmer. 		I don’t see how that’s an asshole suggestion.
@CryPartisanUK @jericho71 @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP It’s clear you are never going to argue in good faith here. You have shown yourself to be simply dismissive of all evidence against your position.
@CryPartisanUK @jericho71 @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP You’ve just dismissed three credible sources without even opening them. Shows how much you really care about facts.
@CryPartisanUK @jericho71 @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP You didn’t read it.
@CryPartisanUK @jericho71 @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP You didn’t even read it.

@CryPartisanUK @jericho71 @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP https://t.co/wzmHrvoqKb		It really is simple science.
@jericho71 @CryPartisanUK @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Also at the time that the hole in the ozone layer was becoming a problem, there was less evidence of the causes of it than there is now of the causes of climate change, and yet we still acted on it and banned CFCs. And it worked! The ozone hole is getting smaller.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP We’d be happy to say something nice about Trump and Pence if there was anything nice to say about them.
@CryPartisanUK @jericho71 @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Much of our scientific progress in history was built on consensus. If we needed 100% proof of anything before we acted on it, we wouldn’t be where we are now.
@jericho71 @CryPartisanUK @2ndLtRipley @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP And that’s another thing. We all do hope that we are wrong. We don’t actually want to be the cause of climate change. But that’s the most likely explanation.
@2ndLtRipley @jericho71 @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP We've known the world is round since before Columbus, who if you remember your history, became famous for what he did in 1492.	The idea of a round Earth has been generally accepted for far longer than that, going way back to the ancient Greeks and Romans.	https://t.co/efi2Qy7PNT

@GOP He's also really good at walking away from deals that are actually good.		See: Iran
@Grizzly_Stevens @KamalaHarris @girlfrmtheisles That doesn't mean it's wrong. The surface Albedo of Mars has still gotten lower, meaning it absorbs more of the sun's energy, leading to warmer temperatures.		The change is due to the planet itself. Not the sun.
@Grizzly_Stevens @KamalaHarris @girlfrmtheisles I'm saying that it's not causing climate change. It obviously affects temperatures. Just not how you claim it does.
@Grizzly_Stevens @KamalaHarris @girlfrmtheisles The temperature increase on Mars is not because of the sun. I suggest reading NASA's actual findings.		https://t.co/5Bwh0jKs8H
@Grizzly_Stevens @KamalaHarris @girlfrmtheisles The graph didn't come from NOAA. 		https://t.co/CkFCl4jdjT
@WHFakeNews Because climate change is making weather more extreme on both the warm and cold ends. 		Or is that what you're saying? If so, I apologize. It's just that I've seen too many people use unusual snow as "proof" that the planet isn't warming.
@K4IDX @KamalaHarris Nobody is saying that we cause these events, just that we're making them worse. If you need evidence, just ask the people who need to pay out claims every time these events happen.		https://t.co/wxrZhJXMx1
@Grizzly_Stevens @KamalaHarris @girlfrmtheisles https://t.co/7WrSArnG4C
@roseyjo57 @KamalaHarris That's not what we think at all. We aren't causing these events, but we ARE making them worse. 		Insurance companies have been studying the effect on climate change on their claims for years now.		https://t.co/wxrZhJXMx1
@SKingofChi @KamalaHarris I'm not sure you quite understand how the Grand Canyon was formed...
@bibleman1976 @KamalaHarris STOP REPEATING THIS VOLCANO MYTH. I see it all the time on here, but it's 100% false.		https://t.co/rd3f7INKey
@Laural4705 @KamalaHarris "The report notes there is strong scientific evidence to suggest that climate change is having an influence on the frequency, severity and distribution of natural catastrophes and extreme weather events."
@Laural4705 @KamalaHarris Nobody is taking credit for causing these weather events, just for making them worse. Which is definitely happening. Insurance companies have been studying these effects for years now.		https://t.co/wxrZhJXMx1
@deron_le @KamalaHarris That's not true. If you're going to argue that man made climate change is real, at least do it correctly. Climate has changed naturally since the Earth was formed, but those natural factors of change are not enough to explain the current warming patterns.
@WHFakeNews @KamalaHarris So what?
@EddieHorn @KamalaHarris How is it that you people can't understand what we're saying? Are you being willfully ignorant, or do you actually believe you're making an intelligent point?		We aren't claiming to be the CAUSE of these disasters, only that we're making them worse.
@nickyscarfo8 @KamalaHarris If you like warmer weather, move somewhere warmer. Climate change is having other real, dangerous effects that aren't worth your city being a little warmer for. And this is coming from a Minnesotan.
@raincitymatt @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Only once we account for human factors do the models match the current warming trend.
@raincitymatt @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP To give you a better answer, there have been many naturally occurring changes in climate in the past, but the factors that were the causes of those changes are not enough to explain what we’re seeing now.
@raincitymatt @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP I don’t want humans to cause climate change. Every democrat hopes that we’re wrong. We’d love for it to turn out that we aren’t really at fault, but right now that’s what the evidence suggests.
@raincitymatt @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP That depends on where you live. If the glaciers were there during your lifetime, then it was the current warming caused by humans. If you’re talking about glaciers thousands of years ago, then it was natural changes in climate.
@Crystal61892589 @2ndLtRipley @CryPartisanUK @BigBlueBlazes @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP He’s just trolling. He knows that his arguments are nonsense. I’m done responding to him.

@MarkVivoda @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP You seem to think that it’s just one group of scientists who’ve reached that conclusion. The data has been verified and studied numerous times by different research groups.
@edredmny @alantbaird @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Because in this case, we are changing the climate much more than it would naturally be changing. It’s our fault.
@MarkVivoda @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Assumptions was a poor word choice. But if we have over a 95% chance of one thing being true, we always act on it as though it is true.
@MarkOliver1776 @HotTakeDebate @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP @BjornLomborg Here’s what they say about the sun’s role: 	https://t.co/tKwTHWURsX
@CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP And there it is: someone keeps presenting me with facts and evidence counter to my beliefs!! I better block them so I don’t have to reconsider my ignorant position.
@CryPartisanUK @alantbaird @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Ok how’s this. It’s a pretty simple start for people like you who don’t understand how science works. 		https://t.co/bmRVZ1o2ap
@hooklandry @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP It’s the same concept. Smoking is proven to cause cancer just like carbon dioxide is proven to be a greenhouse gas.
@MarkOliver1776 @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP I can’t believe how insane these conspiracy theories are. The real conspiracy here is fossil fuel companies (and the Republicans they buy) not wanting to lose revenue streams to clean energy/environmental regulations.
@CryPartisanUK @MarkOliver1776 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Yeah because my argument wasn’t “smashed.” Only truly ignorant people don’t acknowledge man made climate change. It’s like being a flat earther or antivaxxer.
@CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP If 97 doctors told you you had cancer because of smoking, and 3 told you they didn’t know for sure what caused your cancer, would you really keep smoking because the 3 doctors said it might not have been because of the smoking?
@MarkOliver1776 @CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Just because the climate has changed naturally in the past doesn’t mean we aren’t responsible for it now. Stop ignoring the science.
@CryPartisanUK @will6750647 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Just because it’s naturally changed in the past doesn’t mean that’s what’s happening now. 		You’re just being ignorant if you refuse to acknowledge the evidence we have that debunks your claim.
@CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP That’s a pretty good level of certainty for science. We can’t conclusively “prove” a lot of things in science, but when all the evidence we have points to one thing, we have to assume that thing is correct. At least until a better-supported theory develops.
@CryPartisanUK @will6750647 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP No it’s not. The natural cycles that cause climate change do not explain the current trend.
@rustyweiss74 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP Then why do 97% of climate scientists agree with that point?
@CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP There is a 95% confidence level (according to NASA) that we’re the cause of it. 97% of climate scientists agree.
@edredmny @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP But it is mostly humans this time.
@will6750647 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP It’s also known science that even though past warming events have been natural, this one isn’t. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the fact that we are the cause of this.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse But ignoring violations of the law because someone is on your side is kind of fascist, and that’s exactly what the right is doing about Trump and other members of his administration.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Locking up political opponents isn’t fascism if they’ve actually committed crimes.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews Tweeting an article from Breitbart like that proves him right. Try again Jr. Next time use a real source.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse “If they’re not trying to fix the problem my way, they’re not trying to fix the problem!!” 	-You right now, and too many other Republicans.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Is that convicted felon and conspiracy theorist Dinesh D’Souza? The one who was pardoned by Trump because of his political beliefs? I’m sure he’s a believable source.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse No actual democrat supports open borders. We just want security that will actually work and not be a waste of money. 		As for abortion, we don’t like it either, but it’s a necessary evil that won’t go away by criminalizing it. 		And higher taxes only for those who can afford them
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse For the record, I don’t support Maduro. I think ultimately it is the right decision to back Guaidó. I just think we need to point out the hypocrisy of some of Trump’s justifications for doing so.
@CPAC @GOP @GOPChairwoman This “far left” still would barely be considered left in Europe. But keep up the fear mongering.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse I love how Republicans constantly argue with Democrats about what Democrats support. 		By the way, Juan Guaidó of Venezuela is a social democrat. Just like Bernie. Or AOC. Trump’s fighting against socialism in Venezuela by propping up what you’d consider a socialist in America.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump US Intelligence: “Mr. President, here’s what we know.”		Trump: “That’s not right. I think you’re wrong.”		Pretty Much Any Dictator: “I didn’t do this thing that I clearly did.”		Trump: “I believe you.”
@senatemajldr And once again, Trump takes a dictator at his word (over the death of a US citizen), while he consistently ignores his own intelligence agencies. 		This man is not fit to be President, and because you support him, you are not fit for office either.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse There’s nothing communist about Democrats. Social Democracy is not the same as socialism, and neither of those things are the same as communism. 		Do you consider Norway a communist country? No? Then neither are the democrats.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Right. Because Republicans are the ones electing representatives of color.		Oh wait. That’s Democrats. 		And Democrats are the ones attacking those representatives based on their religion. 		Oh wait. That’s Republicans.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse I said I thought that Republicans think Democrats are socialist. I think your reading comprehension needs a little practice.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Where does that say, “Republicans are socialists”?
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse You need to understand that while in the past, those people were democrats, those same southern racists are mostly Republicans now.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse My parents are Republicans. And I have a couple of really good friends who are Republicans. 		And I didn’t say anything about Republicans being socialist. That’s ridiculous.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse I’m not denying they were founded by democrats, but nowadays they support Republican candidates.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse I don’t think all Republicans are racist. But most racists vote republican. Just ask the Klan who they support.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Democrats used to be the party of slavery yes, but those democrats were conservatives. Abolition was a progressive policy.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse And your only examples are from 150 and 50 years ago. Both parties have changed since then.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse How can you suggest that Democrats are fascist when Trump is the one showing fascist tendencies? And I thought Republicans think we’re socialists? Socialism and fascism are inherently opposite.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse Which part of that is silly?
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse 1) Republican corruption is way more out of control. 		2) It’s not just Democrats that recognize climate change. It’s almost every major party in the world, as well as 97% of climate scientists.
@maureeninct @SenWhitehouse 97% of climate scientists agree that we’re causing climate change. That’s a pretty strong consensus. Stop lying @maureeninct.
@McjiltonTony @hoefsd @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse That was a reply to @hoefsd, not you.
@hoefsd @McjiltonTony @amyklobuchar @SenWhitehouse It’s because people like you have been convinced by Republicans and corporations to ignore science and believe it’s a hoax.
@GOPoversight I've ran, but I am not a runner.	I've swam, but I am not a swimmer.	I've made dumb mistakes in the past, but I am not a Republican.		You're all really grasping for straws if this is the best criticism you have about the testimony.
@RobbyKuester @SenJeffMerkley Nobody is saying we only have 12 years to live. The 12 years is just the estimated timeframe in which we have to act before things start to get out of control.
@scootster7 @SenatorLeahy By claiming we can't effect our climate, you are ignoring overwhelming mountains of evidence to the contrary, as well as other historical examples of organisms changing the atmosphere, such as the Great Oxygenation Event, which was caused by simple cyanobacteria.
@KenDilanianNBC @ckubeNBC @carolelee Hey GOP, is this what you call winning? 		Maybe once this is done, and we walk away with basically nothing again, you will see that @realDonaldTrump is nothing more than a conman.
@arrowonthebow @TrueAme12118111 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yeah, I have. From a reusable water bottle I've had for 4 years now.
@PresSCHULTZ2020 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr 97% of climate scientists agree that we’re causing this climate change. 		According to NASA, there is a 95% level of confidence for that conclusion. More than enough to be fairly certain of it.
@C6E150nJTLTalfj @SenSchumer @senatemajldr You’re the fool if you believe that humans can’t change the climate. It doesn’t matter what caused it in the past. We KNOW what’s causing it now. We are.
@Biggirlpants2 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Anthropogenic climate change is very real. Stop being ignorant.
@DocFossick @SenSchumer @senatemajldr The climate is always changing, that’s true. But this current change is happening more rapidly than can be explained by the natural cycles of climate. And it’s tied directly to humanity’s emissions of greenhouse gasses.
@TrueAme12118111 @arrowonthebow @SenSchumer @senatemajldr You know better than NASA? You know better than the experts just because you lived near a volcano? How does just living near a volcano give you more knowledge than the people who actually study them? Where's your evidence?
@AmericaFirstPAC @seanspicer They did schedule it on a different day. But then the President went and threatened Cohen's family, and it got postponed. Stop blaming the Democrats for this.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump We would rather see our justice system succeed.		We would rather see America succeed.		Why is it always that President Trump succeeding is counter to those other successes? Our president is a criminal, a traitor, and a fraud.
@TrueAme12118111 @arrowonthebow @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/H3pHaKW4ZT		Here's the rest of it.
@TrueAme12118111 @arrowonthebow @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I linked to the specific page that debunks the relevant part. The rest of the evidence, causes, and effects, can be found on other parts of NASA's website, but since Republicans and science don't get along very well, I figured I'd do the work of finding that part for you guys.
@nick_solorecon @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/rd3f7INKey		Volcanoes release very little carbon compared to people. This myth needs to die. I've seen so many people spout this bullshit. Maybe do a little research before you do again.
@arrowonthebow @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I don't know where this volcano myth keeps coming from, but they actually don't release that much carbon comparatively.		https://t.co/rd3f7INKey
@Patriot177620 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr "Our car would slowly inch towards the cliff anyway, so why not just floor it?"
@CryPartisanUK @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Humans ARE the ones who caused it. 97% of climate scientists say so, including organizations such as @NASA.
@DocFossick @SenSchumer @senatemajldr How do you people not understand that just because the climate changes naturally, that doesn't mean humans don't change it too? In your example, that change has occurred over 100,000 years. The change we're seeing is more immediate than that.
@HezekiahMunson3 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It is caused by humans. The evidence overwhelmingly supports that conclusion.
@SakalYarah @SenSchumer @senatemajldr 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is caused by humans. The sun is not causing climate change. Do some real research.		https://t.co/tKwTHWURsX
@ThrasherAtl @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Ben Garrison really has a talent for fitting so much idiocy into one comic.
@joniernst *Disclaimer: Only for the rich
@robare53 @SenateDems @EPA @SenMarkey That’s completely false. Science overwhelmingly supports the fact that it’s happening and that it’s our fault.
@TJKy176 @SenateDems @EPA @SenMarkey Coal is a dying industry. Let it die. It’s harmful for the planet, and it stands in the way of green energy investments.
@MR93827457 @SenAngusKing No, this climate “alarmism” is based on hard evidence and science.
@shermanator1015 @SteveKingIA Diversity is good, and groups with diversity perform better than groups of all old white guys. Diversity should definitely be a factor when making appointments, but it should not be the only factor, or even the main one.
@shermanator1015 @SteveKingIA What a terrible argument. Democrats know that gender/race/sexual orientation aren't everything about a person. If Democrats voted against all of those, it was because they were unqualified, or there were better candidates. Not because of those single identifiers.
@firecracker302 @SenateDems @SenatorCarper It's easy to say it's real because it IS real. The evidence we have overwhelmingly supports that fact. Stop being ignorant.
@johntdoerame @JoeTalkShow @DonaldJTrumpJr The people who still support Trump usually don’t have the best grasp on how the government works. That’s what happens when you have a base that treats education as brainwashing.
@ByronYork @DonaldJTrumpJr You people are really stretching to find these “inconsistencies.” You must truly be desperate.
@justininglv @ArthurSchwartz @Nvr4Get91101 @RepAdamSchiff You support a president who’s basically a puppet of a foreign government, and you call us anti American?
@HouseGOP That’s because Republicans have twisted and distorted the definition of socialism to the point that even some democrats are starting to believe that social democracy = socialism.
@smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris Because this is not a natural cycle! In the past, it happened slowly enough for life to adapt, and even then, many species still weren’t able to. We are changing the climate too quickly, and many species that we don’t always realize we rely on are in danger of dying out.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Don't forget that he was confirmed to be lying about evidence of Russian collusion, so if you do admit he was lying, are you also admitting that Trump had closer ties with the Russians than he was admitting?
@fdmfive @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Not if you actually understand what patriotism means.
@GOP Well they were scheduled for earlier this month until the were postponed because our criminal president started threatening Cohen's family.		The timing of the hearings is all on Trump, not the Democrats.
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump You're right, Eric. It really is incredible just how this president somehow manages to be wrong about almost everything he says and does.
@GrahamAllen_1 @GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP "Real American" here! Trump has to be one of the most interesting presidents we've ever had. I can't think of any other president so completely lacking in redeeming qualities. If a bag of trash had a mouth, it would say more intelligent things than Trump ever has.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP A good leader makes his people want to follow his example.		So if Trump wants the American people to be corrupt, conspire with foreign governments, lie about everything, and just be garbage human beings in general, then yes, I guess he is a good leader.
@gatewaypundit @DonaldJTrumpJr @TuckerCarlson You guys have it all wrong. We hate President Trump BECAUSE we love America.
@TheReal_AGarcia @smi5504 @KamalaHarris He definitely is. Climate change being a good thing is just too ridiculous to be something anyone truly believes. Unless they've been taking in too much Russian propaganda.
@beachykeen21 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov I don't think you read it right. THE SON WAS GOING TO DIE EITHER WAY. And who are you to say what others would decide in that situation?
@DerferDarren @MartinHeinrich @SenateDems @senatemajldr I can't believe how willfully ignorant this statement is. We can be as certain that climate change is real as we are that evolution is real. In fact, there's no debate that the climate is changing. Any debate is over what causes it, and scientists say we do.
@qofcode @MartinHeinrich China and India do emit a greater volume of carbon, and they should do something about it, but that doesn't change the fact that on average, each American citizen emits over twice the carbon of a Chinese citizen, and almost 10x that of an Indian citizen.
@qofcode @MartinHeinrich That article says absolutely nothing to dispute those numbers. Do you not understand what per capita means?
@qofcode @MartinHeinrich 2014 Carbon emissions per capita (metric tons):	US: 16.5	China: 7.5	India: 1.7		Both of those countries are doing much better than us on a per capita basis.
@beachykeen21 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Did you read the article?		"The doctors said they had to quickly dilate her cervix and perform an abortion to save her. 'I fought it,' she says. 'But they told me I would die — that it was either me and my son or just my son.'"
@MartinHeinrich @senatemajldr They know they have no real evidence for their denial, so they’ll never want to risk proving that in a debate, as much as we want them to.
@beachykeen21 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Both cases were over a decade ago, and I don’t think I ever heard what the exact condition was, but I can give you this. There’s an example in the article. 	https://t.co/nJt1GbuuSc
@Tony85058128 https://t.co/nGbCO5cbdQ		Do you wanna actually prove me wrong, or just make baseless claims?
@SharknessaWhite @HouseGOP @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @USATODAY Haha I stole it from somewhere too. Probably a Reddit comment.
@smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris We weren’t driving motor vehicles, but we were cutting down forests, mining and dumping in large portions of the landscape, and polluting the air and water. We’ve always had an effect on nature.
@Lurkt @metrikk @jzpopp @ReaMackay @JohnCornyn How do you think they make a profit? Your premiums are calculated with a profit in mind. Collectively, premiums have to account for paying out benefits, covering other expenses, and then some extra to make a profit.		That's basically no different than taxing on top of the premium
@Joyce88923188 @chan7843 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov That way hopefully abortion can be an option for those who really need it, while cutting down on the other cases.
@Joyce88923188 @chan7843 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Then we have to do our best to reduce unwanted pregnancies. Free birth control (at least for those who can't afford it themselves), better sex education (not abstinence only, begin at earlier ages), and improve the foster system so that people are more likely to consider adoption
@Joyce88923188 @chan7843 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov THAT is why abortions need to be available for those who need them. Because that abortion actually had a net positive effect on the number of lives. At the cost of one fetus that wouldn’t have lived anyway, 4 people are alive today who otherwise might not have been.
@Joyce88923188 @chan7843 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov ...Today, she is the mother of 3 healthy young boys, none of whom would probably be here if she hadn’t had that abortion. And maybe she wouldn’t have either.
@Joyce88923188 @chan7843 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Because some people literally need them to save their lives!		Personal Story Time:	My aunt had an abortion. Her first pregnancy had a complication where the baby wouldn’t have survived long anyway, and the birth would’ve been dangerous for her...
@joniernst I think you mean, “Washington Republicans fail to pass a bill that is already law.”		If you want to fight for the unborn, maybe start by learning the laws that are already in effect.
@smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris We do have that power!! Humans have been changing and damaging ecosystems for thousands of years!		Plus, look into the Great Oxygenation Event, where organisms much simpler than us also had a major impact on the composition of the atmosphere.
@Lurkt @metrikk @jzpopp @ReaMackay @JohnCornyn 1) We wouldn’t have to include illegal immigrants		2) We already pay the bills for many people, illegal or not, who don’t have insurance		3) You also wouldn’t have to pay premiums for private insurance, which will offset the tax increase in many cases
@SenRickScott @orlandosentinel And how much have Republicans wasted on much more pointless things?		Spending a lot of money isn't always a waste, especially on something so crucial to the continued health of our environment.
@DebbieK38358536 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/c0ptY4Ta4O		Nobody want to murder babies. This legislation was pointless. These protections already exist.
@AmericaRising17 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov You mean their votes on the recent legislation that literally would not have made ANY change at all?		There is already a Born-Alive Infants Protection Act that was signed into law back in 2002. This last one was just for show, and that's it.
@beachykeen21 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov And even if it isn't always necessary, we can't make it completely illegal because many people DO need it. I personally know a couple family members who've had to terminate pregnancies because their lives were endangered by complications. Would you tell them it wasn't necessary?
@beachykeen21 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Ah, so you know more about liberals want than an actual liberal?		What's next? Are you going to try telling a dog it barks wrong?
@kdgirl324 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov How about not being such a prude? There's absolutely nothing wrong with people having sex. Abstinence-only sex ed is ineffective and unrealistic.
@chan7843 @Joyce88923188 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Your hyperbole aside, we do need to take more steps to ensure that unwanted pregnancies don't occur, and Democrats have a much more comprehensive plan than Republicans do in that regard		Regardless, we can't make abortions entirely illegal because a lot of people really need them
@HouseGOP @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @USATODAY Always funny to see the GOP judge someone for being a "known liar."		If Republicans didn't have double standards, they'd have no standards at all.
@SenSasse https://t.co/c0ptY4Ta4O		We didn't need your empty legislation Senator. In the rare cases when a baby is born after a failed abortion, they already have the protections you're calling for.	You're either misleading Americans, or you don't have knowledge of the law. Which is worse?
@MarkOrlandi1 @SenWhitehouse They have protection! The Born-Alive Protection Act of 2002 was signed into law by George W Bush, and is still in effect today. Democrats didn't vote no to kill babies. They voted no to stop Republicans from pretending to do something about a problem that doesn't exist.
@SenWhitehouse With all the evidence we have, denying man-made global warming is as unscientific as believing the Earth is either flat or only 6000 years old.
@Tony85058128 @SenatorBenson Except there's already protections in place for that. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 was passed and signed by GWB. This new bill literally would not have done anything new except for allow the GOP to pretend they were doing something about abortion.
@smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris In the past it was natural. Now it's our fault. We can't stop the natural cycles, but we can change our own activities.
@Bimteck116689 @KhalidAbe1 @lostcoonass @Ilhan Obamacare decreased the rates of uninsured people in all 50 states, in some cases dramatically. It also introduced protections for people with preexisting conditions and allowed younger people to stay on their parents plans until the age of 26, which are both very popular.
@Joyce88923188 @BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov I personally know 2 people who never would’ve had an abortion if their lives weren’t threatened by the pregnancy. It WAS necessary for them. 		And I probably know more than just those two, but people don’t usually talk about it because it’s a traumatic experience to lose a kid.
@BeeNewsDaily @SenBlumenthal @ICEgov Nobody “supports” abortion. But rational people understand that it’s a necessary evil. We should never criminalize necessary medical operations. 		Instead we need more access to birth control, sex ed, and other options to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.
@lostcoonass @Ilhan Obama tried what was really just a very watered down version of that and increased health care coverage significantly. The ACA wasn't perfect, but it was a step in the right direction.
@GOP Oh no! He wants to provide people with healthcare and an education?!		This tweet right here only shows that the GOP are fighting against the good of the American people.
@Honda753 @brianschatz Climate change denial is a hoax. Fossil fuel companies (and the Republicans they buy off) need to keep people believing climate change isn't real so they can keep making money. Science fully supports the fact that climate change is real and man made.
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar And the other author literally thinks CO2 is not a greenhouse gas. I'm pretty sure chemists are very familiar with the properties of CO2. Saying it's not a greenhouse gas is like saying dogs aren't mammals.
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar One of the authors of that article is a mechanical engineer. If the ICSC was actually a legitimate climate science coalition, why couldn't they get an actual climate scientist to lead them?
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar 97% of climate scientists say it's real. Denying climate change is as unscientific as antivaxxers and flat earthers.
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar So you just don’t understand the science? Or you just want to stay ignorant?
@defaultuserxyz @GOP @realDonaldTrump Do you not see the irony in wanting to install a social democrat as the President of Venezuela to fight socialism, but then also attacking Democrats who hold similar beliefs as Guaido for being “socialist?”
@GOP @realDonaldTrump It’s funny how Juan Guaidó is a social democrat, and everyone on the right loves him right now (I do too tbh), but then they attack democrats for holding those same “socialist” beliefs here in America.
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar Plus, back then, that prediction was not actually mainstream among scientists. You’re using a fringe theory from 30 years ago to cast doubt on a serious problem.
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar Just because we used to think the earth was the center of the universe doesn’t mean we can’t be sure now that we revolve around the sun. Our understanding of science gets better every year, and right now it tells us we’re causing climate change.
@dross_sense @amyklobuchar I just want people to recognize the impact we have on our climate.
@cari_rickman @amyklobuchar There’s no doubt about the science. It’s absolu possible (and exactly what’s happening) that the planet can be warming on average while seeing more extremes on both the hot and cold sides.
@dross_sense @amyklobuchar Because climate change is causing more extremes on both ends of the temperature scale, while still warming the planet on average. It’s not a difficult concept to understand, if you get how stats work.
@WhiteHouse Fun fact: The opposition president that the US supports is a member of the social-democratic Popular Will party. Which just so happens to work towards the same kind of “socialism” that the president attacks democrats for supporting.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Typical Republican strategy. Losing an argument and proving yourself to be a bad person? Just block the other person so you don't have to come to terms with being wrong! Works pretty well, doesn't it @bymoon02?
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Describing multiple races of people as "vermin" is straight up racist.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump I've already told you that assimilating is never a quick thing. Even the European immigrants in the 1800s didn't assimilate right away. Give them time. The original immigrants won't adapt quickly to our culture, but their children will. As will their children's' children.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Most of the Muslims I know don't want Sharia law here. Just like with Christians, most Muslims don't actually follow everything in their holy book. We wouldn't want to live under strict biblical law either.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Bigotry has never been on the right side of history, and it never will be.		A vast majority of the Muslim immigrants are not preying on anything. They're just looking for a better life, just like you and I would if we were in their position.		Have some compassion.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Because if they stayed in their home countries, they're at risk of being killed by these extremist groups, or being caught in the crossfire of war. The immigrants, for the most part, are not the ones who agree with the terrorists. That's why they leave!
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm not putting all the blame on Christians here, but the Western world really did a lot to fuck up the Middle East over the last 100 years. It's not hard to understand why extremist groups have developed, as much as we condemn their methods.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump If you are honestly denying that about the Quran, you really are ignorant. Also, claiming that Muslims are liars is pretty bigoted. They are regular people just like you and I are. 		You have very limited experience with them, and you're arguing with someone who knows them well.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump And that's exactly what most of them are doing. As a descendant of Norwegian and German immigrants, I'm very confident in the ability of the Somali population to assimilate to the level my family has, if they are given a couple generations. Assimilation isn't an instant process.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Except they don't exist in the city that I'm from. At least not because of the Muslim immigrants.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump It's always funny how the people most afraid of Muslims are the ones who never actually interact with them. You don't have the real life experiences to contradict the fear mongering you hear from your right-wing "news" outlets.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump And don't forget that at some points in history, it was the Christian crusaders destroying what the Muslims had built. The Middle East used to be one of the most tolerant and scientifically literate places in the world under Islam.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump The Bible and the Quran are very similar books. In fact, Jesus is the most mentioned person in the Quran, and Muslims teach the Old Testament as well. I know for a fact that most Muslims in America don't see us as enemies.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump And there aren't any no-go zones where I lived. That's just fear mongering. 		But I wouldn't expect anything less from someone who proudly calls themselves Islamophobic. 		Stop being ignorant and xenophobic. Get out and get to know some real Muslims. That'll change your mind.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump The European immigrants to MN in the 1800s did the same thing the Somali immigrants are doing. They didn't assimilate right away either. They mostly kept to their own communities and spoke their own language instead of English.		It was a slow process, but look where we are now.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump He didn't turn around the unemployment rate. He just maintained the trend. That's all he's been doing. Maintaining the trend.		But I at least give him credit for that. I just don't give him more credit than he deserves. https://t.co/cNqj33hwwV
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I don't expect anyone to be without fault. I just expect the President of the United States to not be so obviously dishonest, bigoted, greedy, and narcissistic.
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump That's fair. I get that there are some policies that people support regardless of who the president is. My parents are conservatives too, but they despise Trump, and as far as I'm concerned, as long as we all can acknowledge Trump's immorality and corruption, then we're fine.
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/G2q5de8mRj
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump But what about when the administration doesn't put America first? Do you keep siding with that administration, or do you speak out against them then?		Like when a president is almost certainly a criminal and/or under the influence of a foreign nation.
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump If the Trump administration was honestly working for that, I'd support them no matter what party they belonged to. But time and time again the President has shown himself to be working against the interests of the American people, Republican and Democrat alike.
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump “I keep supporting a criminal because it hurts my feelings when Democrats call me out for supporting a criminal.”
@MSmith_Flight @PressSec @realDonaldTrump This right here is why Trump supporters still believe in him. The lies make them feel comfortable. They don’t have to challenge their worldview or admit to being wrong about the president if they keep believing in all the falsehoods that spew from this administration.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump You gotta stop arguing with the facts. Trump supporters are really good at rewriting any history they want if it helps make Trump look better. https://t.co/jSHzKXlYbQ
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump I grew up in a city with a pretty large Somali population. They’re more like the rest of us than a lot of people give them credit for, and there’s no shortage of wonderful people in their communities.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump So they found a few people with more extreme opinions. Every group has some of those. There are lots of Christians in this country who think we should govern based on the Bible. There’s literally no difference there. But that doesn’t mean that most Christians agree.
@Lurkt @metrikk @jzpopp @ReaMackay @JohnCornyn That's absolutely ridiculous. Do you realize how many countries have universal health care or other social programs? Hint: it's pretty much every other first-world country as well as many others. Even the US has plenty of helpful social programs. Stop with the fear mongering.
@mnsrc @GovTimWalz Dear Republicans,		I know you don't have a great grasp of economics, but good things cost money. 		Sincerely,	A Minnesotan who would gladly pay more in taxes to make our state better for everyone.
@JohnCornyn Our ideology is incompatible with freedom? Why don't you try telling that to Norway or Denmark and not having them laugh in your face? 		You are a Senator. You should not be misleading people like this, John.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump And my point wasn't that "socialism" will cause our economy to grow, it's that it isn't going to wreck the economy like the right always loves to claim.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Our country grew economically under Obama. I give Trump credit for not screwing up the growth that started with our last president, but the way you phrased that suggests that Obama did not grow the economy, which is just plain false.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/T6NZq0ofz8		I do think so. And that's not to mention how they're all still growing economically. I'd say these countries are definitely doing pretty well for themselves.
RT @IdaBWel32081443: @GOP @RepWalberg https://t.co/T08klWV6xP
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Do you have any awareness of global politics? Sweden, Norway, Denmark, The UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and dozens of other successful countries all have the things that Democrats are pushing for.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Did you reply to the wrong tweet? That has nothing to do with what we were talking about.
@1PatrioticBitch @SteveKingIA @IowaPress How exactly is reporting his direct quotes brainwashing? If a guy says racist things, he's probably a racist. It's as simple as that.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump These countries have a healthy mix of mostly capitalism, but with some socialist policies to help take care of even the poorest citizens.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump Democrats want America to work more similar to social democracies like many European countries. The "socialism" that we want works. We know it does because there are many examples of it in developed countries.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump When Republicans use it, they want people to believe Democrats want to make America similar to countries like Venezuela or Cuba. Democrats do not want to abolish capitalism. But a purely capitalistic system fails the people just like a purely socialist one does.
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump “[S]ocialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of private ownership of the means of production, and the creation of a system of “planned economy” in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body.”
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump That's not the definition of socialism though. Republicans use socialism to describe anything they don't like because some people still have a Red Scare mentality where they're afraid of anything that's not 100% capitalist, and they can easily rile up their base.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Good for him for not fucking up the trend set by Obama, but he really can't take full credit for this. https://t.co/AZPDd0avZl
@bymoon02 @sabrinamhg @GOP @realDonaldTrump You talk about brainwashed stupidity and then call Democrats socialists?		How about you learn what socialism really means instead of just listening to Republicans accuse everything on the left of being socialism?
@1PatrioticBitch @SteveKingIA @IowaPress America does not need white nationalists making decisions for the whole country. Looking down on your fellow Americans based on their skin color is not patriotic in any way.
@Keydet1977 @smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris https://t.co/DPB9bJUfin		10 second google search for "surface temperature of moon rising"		Hopefully that wasn't too long of a wait for you.
@jzpopp @metrikk @ReaMackay @JohnCornyn That's why I put socialism in quotes. Democrats aren't actually calling for socialism. We want social democracy, but Republicans have twisted that to accuse Democrats of wanting socialism, and many Democrats just don't know the difference and go along with it.
@jzpopp @ReaMackay @JohnCornyn Then you should know that what the Democrats actually want works pretty well for Europe.
@metrikk @jzpopp @ReaMackay @JohnCornyn Exactly. And the “socialism” we are calling for is working very well in Europe. People just need to take a look at the Nordic countries to see that.
@JohnCornyn That’s exactly right Senator, which is why everyone needs to stop saying Democrats want socialism. Republicans have twisted the meaning of the word just so they can attack Democrats, and unfortunately many Democrats have simply embraced the new meaning.
@AnnGables3 @brianschatz What’s sad is when people like you ignore all the science that supports the fact that people are causing harmful climate change.
@MariannaDC3 @LoylPatriot @KamalaHarris That's pretty funny, coming from someone who doesn't believe in man made climate change.
@LoylPatriot @MariannaDC3 @KamalaHarris Then 97% of climate scientists are Democrats. Which would make sense, because educated people usually are.
@GoldNome @KamalaHarris The Sahara is now inhospitable, so if you want to keep peddling your ignorant arguments of how we'll be fine, you might want to pick a different one.
@JohnnyD1two3 @KamalaHarris Imagine believing that people honestly wanting to help the environment and the unfortunate must be trying to scam you, all while supporting the worst conman to ever disrespect the office of the President.
@smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris 4) Climate models without human factors included fail to reproduce historical data.		5) 3 &amp; 4 strongly suggest that humans are to blame this time		6) 97% of climate scientists support this idea
@smi5504 @TheReal_AGarcia @KamalaHarris 1) The Greenhouse effect is a proven and known effect.		2) We emit much more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere than are released by natural processes.		3) Climate models, which can accurately reproduce historical data, all include human factors.
@MariannaDC3 @KamalaHarris It was a giant meteor that killed the dinosaurs, not the normal changes in climate. 		And just because the climate has changed naturally in the past doesn't mean that we aren't causing it now. The science strongly supports the conclusion that we're to blame.
@Michael54567540 @KamalaHarris Ok so how about you tell us the positives? And also explain how they outweigh the many negatives. 		And by the way, even though the climate does change naturally, the change we are seeing is being primarily driven by humanity, not nature.
@WCivility @KamalaHarris What the fuck are you talking about? None of that is happening.
@RandyLawson2 @KamalaHarris Not all of them unfortunately. Too many of them are older people who just don't care what happens to the rest of us once they're gone.
@spalkeen @KamalaHarris Somebody needs to set the example. If the whole world waits for someone else to change first, we'll all regret it.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The "socialism" that Democrats want brings economic security and prosperity to hundreds of millions of people in Europe and other developed countries like Canada and Australia. Stop repeating the President's lies and stop deceiving the American people.
@RealGio4 @KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar https://t.co/emcfOe3uq4		Do you want to source that claim, or do you just want to keep spouting conspiracy theories?
@RealGio4 @KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar And you're just going to point out a few of NASA's failures without mentioning all the amazing things they've done? There's a reason people say "it's not rocket science." Rocket science is hard! And while NASA has made mistakes, they've also put people on the moon!
@RealGio4 @KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar But it's not just NASA. 97% of climate scientists agree that people are the primary driver of climate change. Do you really think you know better than the experts?
@RealGio4 @KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar https://t.co/tKwTHWURsX		NASA says you're wrong.
@randyfi54602168 @gdmcdowall @amyklobuchar Except that’s not true. Volcanic eruptions produce only 2% of the levels produced by man.

@dannybeckwith5 @ChrisGr86712795 @GoldsoundsG @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA “Allowing the government to take away property”? If you’re so worried about that, why not complain to the president who’s seizing land at the border for a worthless wall?
@ChrisGr86712795 @dannybeckwith5 @docohm47 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA You certainly know how to twist real arguments into a false narrative don’t you? None of those things are actual things Democrats want. (Except the taxation, but we only want to increase taxes on the rich, and “ridiculous” is very much a matter of opinion)
@ChrisGr86712795 @GoldsoundsG @dannybeckwith5 @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA The Nazis were not socialist. Open up any history book and you’ll see that.

@ChrisGr86712795 @GoldsoundsG @dannybeckwith5 @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA The Nazis purged the socialists. I bet you also think the DPRK is a republic.
@docohm47 @ChrisGr86712795 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA The more educated a society is, the better off it is. Investing in higher education for everyone should be obvious.
@docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Student loans are a big part of the problem. Many of them have very high interest rates that make it difficult to dig out of that debt. And we don’t want to get rid of that competition. We just think nobody should start on 3rd base, when most start from home.
@docohm47 @JayinMarietta @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Democrats want EFFECTIVE border security and humane treatment for asylum seekers. That’s not the same as open borders.
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I bet you can find “science” on the internet that says cows are actually reptiles. That doesn’t mean anyone should waste their time reading something so obviously wrong.
@docohm47 @ChrisGr86712795 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA And here’s a tip: don’t go around claiming Democrats want to destroy the constitution. People will know right away how delusional you are.
@docohm47 @ChrisGr86712795 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA “...It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country.” - President Teddy Roosevelt.

It is patriotic to support him in so far as he efficiently serves the country...
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr You have made claims that go directly against all observable evidence. Why should I bother to read your “sources” when I’m sure they’ll be just as garbage as your claim of cooling?
@docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Not every job provides health care, especially not the ones that 18-21 year olds would get. There’s a little thing called college that takes a good chunk of our money until well after we graduate.
@docohm47 @JayinMarietta @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Identity politics? Open borders? Actual Socialism? Those aren’t really Democratic policies. As for the rest of those, I proudly support every one.
@ChrisGr86712795 @docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Because the right is so prepared to defend us from Russian interference and our puppet president. You want to talk treason, ask the president why he’s selling out America’s interests?
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Which is exactly my point. The sun is definitely not causing warming, but the planet IS warming anyway (the last 5 years are the hottest on record). So what else is causing it? The answer is us.
@moekamerow @TheDemocrats If you think the Democrats are actually communist, you’ve taken in too much GOP propaganda. Stop seeing the communist boogeyman everywhere.
@newjunetune @TheDemocrats That’s like saying, “At what point in your life have your cells not divided?” to a cancer patient.
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr We are definitely not cooling. That’s as crazy as thinking that the earth is flat or that vaccines cause autism.
@ChrisGr86712795 @docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Only to people who don’t understand the meaning of the word patriot.
@dbirch214 @Meanjean2300 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yeah I have graphs too. https://t.co/tKdTXU7pye
@docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Health care for all, more power for workers and minority groups, support for the poor, and actual better trade, for starters. Also not ruining our environment.
@dbirch214 @Meanjean2300 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr No I’m not. None of what I said contradicts that.
@KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar ... Human activity has driven climate change to a degree not seen in natural processes. That’s why we should be worried. Not just because the climate is changing (although that can cause problems of its own), but because we’re making it change too quickly.
@KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar I’m not saying it’s not a natural process. But human activities can often have the same effect as natural processes. 		Just because most lakes are formed naturally doesn’t mean that manmade lakes don’t exist (they do). And they are created much faster than when nature does it...
@Hoosierchip @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That is fair. The rich/politicians definitely need to do more themselves aside from just telling others to, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we should ignore policy to get us going in that direction.
@docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA https://t.co/I3eKDIZSVA		Yeah, sure does sound like they ruined it. I would love for Minnesota to do some of the things California does.
@R_Canaway @BruceOlley @GoldsoundsG @SenSchumer @senatemajldr And unless the poor are the ones in power, then you’ve contradicted yourself.
@R_Canaway @BruceOlley @GoldsoundsG @SenSchumer @senatemajldr “Making everyone miserable, except those in power.” 		You mean like Republicans?
@docohm47 @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA That certainly is a lot of people. It must be why Trump is so popular.		Except he isn’t. Nobody but the far right still supports that criminal. Even my Republican parents despise the man.
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr 5) Without including human activity, climate models fail to replicate the current warming trend. 		6) This indicates that humans are primarily to blame for climate change. 		7) 97% of climate scientists agree with that finding.
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr 3) The current period of warming has happened over a much shorter period of time than past warming/cooling events. 		4) The only climate models that have accurately recreated historical data have taken human activity into account.
@Meanjean2300 @dbirch214 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It’s actually pretty easy to figure out for yourself. 		1) The greenhouse effect is a known and proven thing. 		2) Humans release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than otherwise would’ve from natural causes
@gdmcdowall @amyklobuchar Chemists side with the climate scientists on this. In fact, many climate scientists have strong chemistry backgrounds because chemistry is essential to understanding how these gasses interact in the atmosphere.
@KCChiefsUpNorth @amyklobuchar This warming is more rapid than any other period we have observed. And the cause is as clear as science can be: humans are responsible.
@Bluehawk23 @amyklobuchar Common sense says that @amyklobuchar is correct. There’s no denying that the world is warming, and the evidence strongly suggests we are responsible.
@horsegramps @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Scientists love to prove each other wrong, and there is no shortage of organizations that would love to disprove climate change. So why don’t we see any real studies that do that? Certainly someone is trying, but they aren’t succeeding.
@KennyKenny412 @SenatorDurbin Well would you like to source your claim that Obama was worse about this than Trump? A claim made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
@madhvacman @SenatorDurbin Plus they literally are asylum seekers. That’s why they end up where they do. Do they all legitimately need asylum? Maybe not, but that’s what they’re waiting for a judge to decide.
@madhvacman @SenatorDurbin Parking violations are illegal too. Does that mean you’re a criminal if you get a ticket? No, because it’s only a civil violation. As is being here illegally.
@dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA If you paid attention to anything but GOP propaganda, you’d know that the left isn’t coming for everything you have. Especially not if you’re lower or middle class.
@KennyKenny412 @SenatorDurbin I think you’re the one who fell for the propaganda bud.
@madhvacman @SenatorDurbin Being in this country illegally is not a criminal violation. And turning yourself in to request asylum is absolutely legal anyway. Most of these people are not criminals.
@horsegramps @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr This is not even the first time living things have changed the climate. Sure climate changes on its own, but scientists are certain that mankind has had a much more drastic and sudden impact than the natural change that happens only over very large periods of time.
@Hoosierchip @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It’s not people existing that’s the problem. It’s the fact that our lifestyle is not sustainable for the ecosystem. I have taken steps to reduce my carbon footprint, as should everyone else.
@dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA A blue collar man like yourself would be a lot better off with the Democrats, instead of the Republicans who only exist to make the rich even richer at the expense of the rest of us.
@dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA So you're just assuming we're unemployed because we want everyone to be insured?
@MWoody29 @charliekirk11 Obama wasn't a criminal or a bigot. That's the difference.
@ridgydidgedw Really? You want to show me where they say otherwise? Because both of my claims can be found right on their website.		https://t.co/bmRVZ1o2ap
@ridgydidgedw Everything about this tweet is wrong. According to NASA it is nearly certain (95%+ probability) that climate change is man made. Also, arctic ice caps are declining at a rate of 12.8% per decade. Both poles have lost over 100 billion tons of ice each year over the last 25 years.
@dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA No it's not.
@dannybeckwith5 @docohm47 @JayinMarietta @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Nobody has any idea what socialism is anymore. Wanting universal healthcare does not mean we want to turn this country into Venezuela. The rest of the Western world does just fine with all of their "socialism."
@dannybeckwith5 @JayinMarietta @docohm47 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr No Democrat wants to abolish the Republic. We just want to make sure all our fellow citizens are supported. We want democracy. We want capitalism. But we need social safety nets for those who are failed by the current system.
@docohm47 @JayinMarietta @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA Jesus, you people are so terrified of the socialism boogeyman, you think everything is a socialist plot.
@DomeijMarshall @tjdwyer89 @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr What we are seeing is nowhere near a "tiny change" when compared to natural changes in climate. And yes, it is almost certain that it is primarily caused by humans.
@docohm47 @JayinMarietta @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA As more ice melts, and more of the planet's surface is covered by the rising seas, more of the sun's energy will be absorbed by the planet, which will contribute to further warming and ice melting.
@docohm47 @JayinMarietta @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @NASA And the more the oceans rise, the worse global warming gets. Ice caps are one of the most reflective surfaces in nature, so more of the sun's rays bounce off them, while ocean water is one of the most light-absorbent surfaces on the planet.
@docohm47 @JayinMarietta @dannybeckwith5 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr "Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100. This is the result of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms." -@NASA's website on climate change.
@dannybeckwith5 @JayinMarietta @docohm47 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yes and those ice cores support the idea that this warming is happening far more quickly than at any other time we know of. We're almost out of time to act.
@DomeijMarshall @tjdwyer89 @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/CKcOpZKsMl		Here's a simple little rundown of the ice cores by NASA. More evidence can be found elsewhere on their site.
@DomeijMarshall @tjdwyer89 @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That volcano thing is just plainly wrong.		https://t.co/rd3f7INKey
@RealCarlGoodwin @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Sea levels have been demonstrably rising for at least 100 years. And have you ever heard of a thing called the water cycle? Evaporation? Do you really think the water flows into the ocean and just stays there?
@chloetreadwell1 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It does get debated. The debate is in how much damage is this going to do to our society. That we are still unsure of. But the fact that it’s happening, and that we’re causing it, is as settled of a science as evolution.
@tjdwyer89 @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr We have evidence of what the climate was like going back hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists can analyze the composition of large ice cores drilled from the arctic that contain ice left over from those periods.
@TexBrussow @No1_Suspicious @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Why don't you point out 1 thing in there, just 1 sentence, that actually supports your point?
@DougWilkey1 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yeah, those scientists are being super selective by using all the data they can get..
@docohm47 @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That’s actually a significant amount of warming over that short a time span. https://t.co/HmwqJ2veER
@TexBrussow @No1_Suspicious @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Cool stuff. But nothing in there disproves the fact that the Earth is warming and that people are the primary reason.
@mtnbke @vcwalls @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I'm a bot just because I only signed up a month ago? Every account needs to start at some point.
@mtnbke @vcwalls @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Do you mean the x axis? Because that's the one in years, and it's clearly labeled right on the graph. The axis is in years before 1950.
@No1_Suspicious @GoldsoundsG @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That's just straight up wrong. Care to cite that number? Because I can cite the real one.		https://t.co/rd3f7INKey
@USPatriot66 @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yes because I love America, and like you do with things you love, I want to see it reach it's full potential as a country, not slide backwards into GOP ideals.
@Meanjean2300 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/tKwTHWURsX		Short answer: no.
@vcwalls @mtnbke @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/H3pHaKW4ZT		You can start here at the NASA website. It's a fairly comprehensive collection of evidence, explanations of the processes involved, and reasons why common skeptic arguments are wrong.
@sgmeyer01 Not at all what I'm saying. We just need to live more environmentally-conscious.
@Walker01660523 @Alisand3 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Are you serious? The agreement is so high because the science is so simple and pretty much every scientist who works with the data can see the story it tells. The idea that if something is almost universally believed, then you have to be suspicious about it is crazy.
@Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/bmRVZ1o2ap	Here's a good summary from NASA with links to many further details. Note this part: "The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity..."
@Alisand3 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @JussieSmollett 1) Yeah, I do believe it because there is no evidence to suggest otherwise		2) I didn't form an opinion right away on the Smollett story. There's history on both sides of people faking encounters with the other side. I waited for more of the story to come out.
@Alisand3 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Really? Because in reality, 97% of climate scientists support the fact that humans are the primary driver behind climate change.
@kingmanmarie39 @HartKariann @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Wheather isn’t climate.
@WftRight @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenatorEnzi @SenJohnBarrasso Cool. You got any evidence with that, or are you just here to deny the facts?
@BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr “Your cells were going to keep dividing anyway, so don’t worry about the cancer that’s making them divide too quickly.” 		That’s essentially your point.
@Texansan1 @WftRight @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenatorEnzi @SenJohnBarrasso The problem isn’t just the level of CO2, The problem is how quickly carbon levels and temperatures are rising. In the past, change was slow enough to allow life to adapt along with it. This time it’s changing too quickly for most species to keep up.
@Bannanaram @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I have. And all the research supports anthropogenic climate change.
@Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It is a scientific theory. And like other famous scientific theories such as evolution or cell theory, it is supported by vast amounts of evidence, and no other theory can explain the data we observe so accurately.
@Bannanaram @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I love that two of you now have only replied “wrong.” Although I cant expect anything else from climate change deniers. After all, you have no actual proof of your argument.
@Meanjean2300 @Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr https://t.co/gNZijpB46n		Here’s the most recent IPCC report.
@Texansan1 @WftRight @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenatorEnzi @SenJohnBarrasso It’s as settled as science can be. Denial of anthropogenic climate change at this point is as baseless as the anti-vax movement or flat-Earth theory.
@ProgPoison Funny. That Koolaid tastes a lot like science and hard data. What kind of research have you done? Your little conspiracy theory is based on nothing but the unwillingness to accept that our lifestyles and culture have a real impact on our environment.
@jackeroo60 @BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Yes. I have. In fact there have been many ice ages. I think you are underestimating just how quickly the climate is changing now. It’s not at a normal/natural rate.
@SuzibrewG @mtnbke @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Not wrong. Have you looked at the IPCC reports? I have. They’re very clear on how certain each of their results are. Stop believing the denial propaganda and start trusting the experts.
@Walker01660523 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Climate changes naturally yes, but never at the rate we’re currently seeing. Scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the idea that humans are the primary cause of the current change in climate.
@BruceOlley @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Natural causes have never changed the climate as drastically as it is changing now. Humans are not just a factor, we are the PRIMARY factor of the current changes in climate.
@mtnbke @SenSchumer @senatemajldr We have more than enough data to say that with high certainty, humans are changing the climate in ways that will be detrimental to life on this planet.
@WftRight @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenatorEnzi @SenJohnBarrasso 1) The earth is always changing, but never as dramatically and rapidly as it is now. 		2) Humans do not change weather. We’re changing the climate. There is a difference. 		3) Congress, as well as every one of us as individuals, definitely needs to act.
@CWGraves15 @Sta7ic @Bjpate1911 @amyklobuchar @dominos "Higher wage, higher tax bracket" means less income? That's not a very good understanding of how taxes work.
@EqualityIsHere @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Here you go. The pink areas are the results of climate models that include human factors. The blue are models that don’t. The black lines are historical data. https://t.co/1mW2Zj5PhH
@EqualityIsHere @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump The current rate of warming is unprecedented. It’s far greater than any other period of climate change in the known history of the planet’s atmosphere. And scientific theories aren’t just theories. They’re backed up by mountains of evidence.
@EqualityIsHere @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Mankind is the cause of the current warming of the planet. Would it have happened anyway? Eventually. Would it be happening now, or at the current rate without us? Absolutely not. This is our fault, and we need to take responsibility.
@HappyPreppers @GOP @GOPChairwoman Which is why, believe it or not, Democrats don’t actually want to get rid of capitalism. What we’re asking for is not really socialism as you see it in Venezuela. It’s just capitalism in a better form, like you see in Europe.
@EqualityIsHere @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Mankind is causing climate change, so why do you assume we can’t stop it? We can definitely mitigate the effects of it if we act now. But that requires immediate and drastic action, which may be unpopular, but it is necessary.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You're right junior, it is real. Your father is the most deranged man to ever be president.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman If you want to pretend that isn't a problem in this country, you go right ahead and ignore it. Republicans are used to doing that, I suppose. Problems and facts mean nothing to them anymore.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman Sure you have.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman Right, because free market solutions have always done fantastic things about pollution. Or climate change. Or labor rights. Or wealth inequality.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman You really believe that government-run insurance would be any worse with so-called "death panels" than private insurance is? That's ridiculous.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman Ok but what about situations where surgery is needed immediately, or there are only a limited number of specialists available who would be able to help? Or times when the patient is brought in unconscious? An unconscious patient can't say, "Too expensive, take me somewhere else"
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman Why don't you ask Europe how they enjoy their universal healthcare? It's pretty popular over there. And more importantly, it works.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman And buying McDonald's or a truck is a lot different than "you have to get this surgery or you will die." That's basic supply and demand. There isn't hardly any buyer power when the demand is so inelastic.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman That was a lot of words to tell me something I already know. But while price clarity would certainly help things, it will never fix the whole problem. In many cases, people don't have a choice in what hospital they go to, so knowing the prices beforehand won't matter.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman I definitely agree that the medical costs themselves are unnecessarily high, which is one reason why Medicare for All would be better. When there's only one system that pays medical bills, they're better able to negotiate those prices down.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman And yet many families go without that assistance, so you do agree that something needs to be done at least?
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman An accusation to "seize power and rule us," coming from a Republican is laughable. You elected a wannabe tyrant, and your party has a problem with election fraud and voter suppression. Nice try though.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman You don't think that a functioning society should help each other with their misfortunes? You have your coverage, so you don't care that others don't?
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman So you're saying that in this country, we each have to buy our right to live? Doesn't sound like it's treated much like a right in that case, even though it obviously should be.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman It is in the rest of the Western world. It should be here too.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman The difference is exactly that it can often be a life/death issue. That's a big enough difference to treat healthcare differently than auto repair.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman A human life is not a car. The means of getting car problems fixed and the means of treating potentially fatal diseases should not be treated the same.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman A patriot would try to make the country they love a better place, which means taking care of ALL of their fellow citizens. Unfortunately the only way to do that is for the government to get involved, because letting only private parties try that has not been effective enough.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman The "inalienable rights," as described by Thomas Jefferson, include the right to life. That's not "the right to life, as long as you can afford your medical treatment." It's simply the right to live. And nobody should have to give up everything they have for that right.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman The right to affordable healthcare, for one. And there's no such thing as too many people going to college. The more education everyone has, the greater society benefits.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Good for him for taking a stand on this, but doing one good thing for the LGBT community does not erase all the anti-LGBT sentiment and actions from his administration in the past. You can't use this to pretend he's not a bigot.
@Kultursmog @GOPChairwoman You mean their true intent to provide basic human rights to Americans? To ensure everyone has access to higher education and that nobody goes bankrupt in the future from medical bills? To make sure future generations have a clean planet to live on? Sure does sound awful...
@BJWiggy @ChrisCoons @CNN @MSNBC Plus, here's another somewhat older article that pretty much addresses the exact point you're trying to make.	https://t.co/SEyQiF0GtY
@BJWiggy @ChrisCoons @CNN @MSNBC https://t.co/ocMDD7XWeY
@BJWiggy @ChrisCoons @CNN @MSNBC The only thing I'm seeing about disproving collusion is a Republican senator saying they haven't found anything conclusive, while Democrats are still saying there is evidence against the Trump campaign. And that's from NBC, about a week ago.
@BJWiggy @ChrisCoons Well we know for sure that Russia interfered in the election, so there's the factual basis. We don't know for certain how involved any Trump campaign members were, but there is definitely a lot of reason to be suspicious.
@BJWiggy @ChrisCoons Does Fox News tell you these things to post? Many top officials in the intelligence community are Republicans who are only investigating Russian interference because it's literally their job, and they won't let their party affiliations get in the way of the truth.
@coolmommy123 @TinaSmithMN Most of Trump's justifications for the wall are at best misleading and at worst complete lies. It's exactly what @TinaSmithMN is talking about, and she's completely right.
@realDWVS @Jonathan_Young_ @ChrisCoons Because it's not just about the money. It's about not giving into a toddler's demand to fund his vanity project that won't help anything. There are far more effective measures we can take along the border to stop this "emergency."
@TKroul @MatthewDicks @realDonaldTrump If you surround yourself with criminals, chances are you're also probably a criminal.		But dipshits like you are clueless
@JohnCornyn You'd have a very tough time convincing anyone from Scandinavia that we have a better system here in the US. The kind of "socialism" that Democrats want is tried and true.
@TheKynik @TheBaxterBean @realDonaldTrump If you think America's democratic party is "extreme leftist," you need a better understanding of global politics. And if you wanna complain about propaganda tools, why not look at a real propaganda network like FOX?
@LRNWS2 @Daytona47 @coleyworld @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump and his administration is the physical embodiment of hate. How anybody could listen to what he says and think that he's "motivated by love" truly shows how delusional you people are.
@sgt_true @Cooley729 @JamieJjaallin13 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry anyway. A wall won't stop that. Also, last year, Trump tweeted that illegal border crossings are at a 45-year low. If that's true, there's no "invasion of illegal people." At least not one requiring a national emergency.
@sgt_true @JamieJjaallin13 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Does that awful attempt at a meme have anything to do with the discussion, or are you just deflecting because you know you're wrong?
@JamieJjaallin13 @Bijou0921 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That is such a ridiculous stance. In reality, voter fraud is statistically a non-issue. On an individual level, the penalties for voting illegally are simply not worth the benefit that one extra person's vote would bring.
@sgt_true @JamieJjaallin13 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How about you learn how tariffs work? A tariff is a tax on imports. That means that AMERICANS are paying more for importing goods. Mexico does not pay the tariffs that Trump implemented.
@Bijou0921 @JamieJjaallin13 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So you think that just because Democrats don't support the wall, that means they aren't trying to protect our country? They have offered alternative, more effective, measures to protect our borders, but I guess you'd rather support the president's little vanity project.
@RobertD36462036 @lizlovesmarilyn @AOC He doesn't have to do it because it's an ineffective waste of money that could be better spent elsewhere. The wall won't help anything.
@Devansfarms @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What is right for the people of this country is to spend money on things that will actually help, not waste money on a vanity project just so our criminal president can feel good about himself.
@JamieJjaallin13 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He campaigned on Mexico paying for it.
@brendonkinzel61 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr All the current science points to modern climate change being caused primarily by humans. There is little evidence to suggest otherwise.
@brendonkinzel61 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr If organisms that were much simpler than us can change the climate, it's ignorant to believe that humans couldn't.
@brendonkinzel61 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Not all climate change is man-made, but it's not all natural either. Look up the Great Oxygenation Event. Billions of years ago, the first organisms to perform photosynthesis evolved, and the resulting addition of so much oxygen in the atmosphere drastically changed the climate.
@blupony3 @EricTrump Trump spearheaded the ridiculous birther movement against Obama for years. He doesn't get to bitch about "presidential harassment."
@TerenceJCarter @IlhanMN What does segregation have anything to do with these tax brackets? If that’s really the best argument you have against this, then it shows how good of an idea it is.
@ZoeHillbilly @PattyMurray Illegal immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than the Trump administration. That's where we should be focusing our efforts on crime.
@WhiteHouse Does this mean @realDonaldTrump doesn't need to go to work today? 		Oh wait... that's every day.
@LeoVasq98066427 @CNNPolitics @SenJeffMerkley You Republicans sure love to believe that Democrats just go around slaughtering babies for the fun of it. Get a fucking grip. We don't like abortions either, but we recognize that they can be necessary.
@ConservaGrrl @brianschatz 4) One side isn’t so deperate to keep their opponents from voting that they commit fraud in elections	5) One side believes in science
@ConservaGrrl @brianschatz 1) One side wants the ability to save a woman’s life from late-pregnancy complications	2) One side wants to make healthcare available for everyone and compromised with the opposition to make steps towards that goal	3) One side doesn’t want people to keep dying in mass shootings
@terit007 @ByronYork @oannewsfeed No puppet! No puppet! You’re the puppet.
@terit007 @ByronYork @oannewsfeed And don’t forget the sweeping victory by Democrats in the midterms that further shows that the American people do not want to keep supporting the ridiculous ideas that come out of the White House.
@terit007 @ByronYork @oannewsfeed A lot more than that voted for border security. Almost 63 million voted for a wall in 2016. But 66 million Americans voted for solutions other than the wall. But sure, keep acting like the wall is what this country actually wants.
@danomedia @rcrouch1969 @ByronYork @JohnCornyn You may think that now, but once you get to 6th grade and start studying US History, you’ll realize how wrong you are.
RT @MrDanZak: This is the majority leader of the U.S. Senate admitting that, if voting were easier instead of harder, Republicans would be…
@EricTrump @amazon @washingtonpost This just in: Hypocrite doesn’t understand how hypocrisy works or why people would be upset by it.
@Zip_It_Hippie @WaysandMeansGOP @HouseGOP I’m glad you’re so willing to admit that human lives should be treated the same as any other asset. Shows what Republicans really think about people who aren’t themselves.
RT @tedlieu: Why hasn't @realDonaldTrump declared a "National Emergency" on the southern border yet? Because he knows he will lose in court…
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @foxandfriends “In the President’s effort to destroy the media, he is actually destroying himself. Given all of the tremendous threats the media has faced, it’s amazing they keep revealing the criminal activity of his administration.”
@RepMikeJohnson Man, it really is funny to see a Republican say something about protecting the integrity of votes. 		You’re full of shit, Congressman.
@tkayyyy @RepPeteOlson Yeah the Republicans are so full of shit on this one. Not only have they tried to repeal those protections in the past, but they actually successfully eliminated all penalties for ignoring the individual mandate, which is a NECESSITY if pre-existing conditions will be protected.
@harif2 @SenatorDurbin Read the article. It says how they do it. It’s easy to smuggle drugs in hidden areas in vehicles because they can’t just dismantle every car coming across the border. Some do get caught, but enough get through the checkpoints that it’s worth it for them to do it that way.
@KerwinYenter https://t.co/3RJcTvYG6l	These are the other security options I mentioned. The compromise isn’t about how much to spend on a wall; it’s about what to do to solve the border issue. They ARE compromising, but because they refuse to cave on the wall, you think they’re doing nothing.
@harif2 @SenatorDurbin https://t.co/bWxTpynY9o
@KerwinYenter @SenatorDurbin Republicans: “The wall is the only way to fix our border!”		Democrats: “A wall won’t work, but we will gladly fund other border security measures.”		R: “Why don’t Democrats compromise?! They only want it their way!”
@myid4maxmillion @SenatorDurbin 3 million more American voters voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2018, 8.6 million more Americans voted for Democrat representatives in the House than Republicans, in part to put a stop to this terrible idea. The American people did NOT vote for a border wall.
@harif2 @SenatorDurbin Most of the illegal drugs coming in through the southern border are not coming through the gaps in the existing barriers. They come through the ports of entry that are already staffed by border agents. Building a wall will do nothing to stop that.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe they should start by writing letters to the Representatives of their districts instead. No Congressman representing a border district supports the wall (including the Republican)! That should tell you something about how much this wall is really “needed.”
