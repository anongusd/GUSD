Why is Trump refusing to come clean about both his foreign interests &amp; tax payments, when he wants to run our country? Congress has the responsibility &amp; the legal authority to find out. Getting his tax returns will do that. Here's my FOX debate on this today. https://t.co/4RfI7dZw8o
Trump's tax returns are fair game. He's Commander-in-Chief, but we don't know about his foreign entanglements. He has the power over our taxes but we don't know if he's paid his share. Past presidents were transparent w/ the American people. He should be too. https://t.co/EEG3Y0Pze4
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs wilting in the heat. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs making people frustrated. https://t.co/JiaXtCZ2CF
Ilhan Omar is being deliberately harassed not just because she is a Muslim woman who has succeeded, but because she did it while maintaining fidelity to who she is. America is better than this. https://t.co/9RJ5eKYa1S
President Trump refuses to release his tax returns. Democrats have the subpoena power to get them. The American people deserve to know his full record, especially since he's running for president again. I'll be on FOX News to debate this today at 4:15pm EST.

Predictably, this is not going over well with either side of the aisle. Democrats will never support any funding for #TheWall, while the one budgetary expenditure that Republicans are most likely to defend is defense. #Trump #NationalSecurity https://t.co/mfa3VRpisT
What‚Äôs truly terrifying is we seem to be getting more truthful details out of the Vietnam Summit from Kim than from Trump. We need a truthful accounting of what happened in Hanoi.
No Wall.	No Jared.	No Exceptions.
Our national security was compromised by the Trump Administration the day it took office (paging Michael Flynn). This latest layer just confirms our suspicions. Kushner should resign immediately, but he won‚Äôt. This, not the wall, is the national emergency.
President Trump is witnessing that it's a lot easier to trash nuclear deals that work - see Iran - than it is to make them happen. It's time for him and his team to get back to work to end the North Korea nuclear threat, just as President Obama did with Iran. https://t.co/UkxGT4HeC4
The #VietnamSummit ended without a deal. Nuclear negotiations are tough. It‚Äôs time for Trump to dig deeper, ensure his team is on board w/ diplomacy &amp; look at the successful #IranDeal for guidance. Here‚Äôs my post-summit debate on FOX.		https://t.co/oJSY1casZx

Pro-Israel money is influential in American politics. But who's allowed to say this publicly? This question is at the core of the fight over Ilhan Omar's recent comments about Israel advocacy. My take for @WJWeek @jstreetdotorg @AIPAC https://t.co/xbAQi9sbFb
It‚Äôs hard to imagine a better gift 2 the BDS movement, which aims 2 isolate Israel, than Netanyahu‚Äôs normalization of the racist Jewish Power party. I don‚Äôt want 2 hear any Israel advocates complain about BDS if they don‚Äôt condemn this https://t.co/PsLgJ0uSuG

SAY WHAT!? Nuclear plants for Saudi Arabia? A country swimming in oil in the heart of the Middle East doesn't need nukes. Why would Trump appointees pursue it despite White House legal &amp; national security leadership's opposition? This one begs Hill oversight. https://t.co/DtG0oa8wrT
Questions for House Intel &amp; other Congressional investigators to ask: What was edited out of the letter? Who met w/ Trump to discuss the contents of the letter? Was #Trump angling to fire #McCabe right away because his wife is a Democrat? Who typed up the letter? https://t.co/Be10mt6n3Y
#Trump's #SpaceForce has a ways to go &amp; it's past time that we have a real diplomatic strategy that accompanies his military one. We need to deal w/ the challenges that space exploration &amp; commercialization present without starting a new arms race in the sky. https://t.co/xDjsB27tcm

The word I used before her name was ‚ÄúSenator‚Äù Klobuchar not ‚ÄúSarah.‚Äù That‚Äôs because I respect - &amp; don‚Äôt fear - women in power.

If the #Republican spending bill passes the #Senate on Thursday - &amp; it won't - it still won't pass the #House. Such political posturing means a longer #GovernmentShutdown. It's time to #OpenTheGovernmentNow &amp; negotiate an agreement. Here's my take 4 @trtworld https://t.co/OywtaIPrgP
The situation here is escalating quickly. #Maduro is an autocrat, but President #Trump's inconsistent approach to dealing with autocratic rulers around the world highlights this administration's lack of a coherent #ForeignPolicy. #Venezuela https://t.co/YCEeF0OTRF
The political calculus for @SpeakerPelosi couldn't be more clear. The wall is overwhelmingly opposed by Democratic constituents and the country at large, while a majority of Americans blame President #Trump for the gov't #shutdown. Why would she acquiesce? https://t.co/IcvXFbE3TB

Pres. #Trump on Saturday ".. should have 1st opened up the gov't immediately &amp; 2nd confirmed that Mexico would pay for the wall as promised." That could have gotten @TheDemocrats on-board. But neither happened &amp; #GovernmentShutdown persists. My take 4 @ANHQDC https://t.co/y2tynjTkd6

The Trump Administration has put all of its Middle East eggs in the Saudi basket. Think Iran, Yemen, Counterterrorism, Israel-Palestine, oil. But it‚Äôs now all at risk.
And now there are calls for an international investigation into the killing. And with the @CIA assessment that bin Salman ordered the killing, the pressure for Saudi contrition will only increase. 	#. @hrw @sarahmargon
And as @RT_Erdogan of #Turkey keeps up the pressure by releasing audio tapes of the murder, Saudi has sought to insulate its leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from blame for the Khashoggi murder. Unfortunately 4 Saudi, it isn‚Äôt working @washingtonpost
Yet #Congress doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough and now, 6 bipartisan leading Senators have introduced legislation designed to increase the pressure on Saudi to come clean, including calling for the blocking of military aid to Saudi. @SenatorMenendez @SenBobCorker

Looking forward to joining @MSNBC this afternoon to discuss the latest on Putin and Trump‚Äôs next meeting... where will it be?
@literide @axios Half of those being targeted already don‚Äôt hold clearances, but for some reason, still have credibility. Oh wait, that‚Äôs because of their knowledge and experience! Case closed. And time to move on. Nice engaging you!
@literide @axios That‚Äôs not how it works. And they have cred because these people have real experience and credibility by virtue of their knowledge from that experience.
@literide @axios Having the clearance isn‚Äôt giving them their cred. The fact that they held the position is what gives them cred. Many former gov officials no longer have clearances and still have cred. Stripping the clearance bc they have an opinion only weakens the cred of the clearance process
@literide @axios Having an opinion is not ‚Äúmisuse.‚Äù Revealing classified information is. These individuals aren‚Äôt being accused of revealing classified.
@axios It stays active for two years after a resignation from Gov service. The goal is to keep expertise nearby if needed, as described in the piece. After two years it then expires, and if an individual needs to get a new one, they have to go through the whole clearance process again.
RT @axios: While President Trump may want to challenge the legitimacy of his political adversaries, misusing the security clearance process‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs great to have @NATO allies like #Montenegro. Let‚Äôs stand with both them and all of our NATO allies, just as we have done for decades. Alliances like this are what keeps America strong. And, no, I don‚Äôt think WWIII will start here. https://t.co/l5hXXZo1mu
#Transparency now! Trump should disclose details to #Congress on what he discussed in his 130 minute mtg w/ Putin. Basic oversight is required. Americans deserve to know about the issues he raised &amp; the deals he cut. National security depends on transparency.

RT @Gochmanity: @mddems Proud to support my friend and neighbor @JoelMartinRubin for Delegate (D18) https://t.co/TuvPdKOI3v
Great debate last night. We have a lot of work to do as progressive Democrats, both for our state and for the country. Let‚Äôs get to work! https://t.co/BWq2FE5V44
Closing statements happening now. Joel: ‚ÄúDistrict 18 is losing experienced delegates. My 20 years of experience, at the federal and local levels, coupled with my ability to create sustainable movements and fight for opportunity, will bring about real change in Annapolis.
What are your policies for seniors? Joel: Retirement security is a high priority for me as my mother in law lives with us. We should support tax incentives that let seniors stay in their homes, protect their healthcare, and mobilize with fed delegation to protect social security
Question: what‚Äôll be your top priority in Annapolis? Joel: Taking back our democracy. I will strengthen it with public financing, redistricting reform, + by bringing disenfranchised groups into the process. We can‚Äôt be complacent, our values are threatened, we must protect them
Next question is on federal tax reform. Joel: the Trump Tax Bill is an abomination. It‚Äôs a sell out to the ultra rich, locked in perpetuity. The MD delegation will have to work with Congress, and it won‚Äôt be easy, but it‚Äôs going to hurt us in Maryland and we can‚Äôt allow that.
Next question is on guns and school security. Joel - I favor protecting kids with trained officers but never arming teachers. I‚Äôm not afraid to debate gun rights activists but at the end of the day we need guns off the street, and we can‚Äôt let them distract us from that goal.
Question on state liquor board: Joel: I grew up in Pennsylvania, they had state stores and transferred them over to the private sector. Think the same can work for MD, but also feel like counties should take a leadership role on the issue, best prioritizing their communities.
Question: how do we attract business to the area? Joel: The federal gov is a top employer and MD needs to work hard to attract them, same with Amazon and innovative tech companies as part of a larger push to plan for the future of work. We need to plan for 2030, not 1990.
Question: Will you fight for MoCo students? Joel: Absolutely. I have 3 kids in MoCo schools. Rising population putting stress on school budget. School construction is not moving fast enough so we need to get creative. Consider leasing space for pop-up classrooms, new revenue
Joel responds to challenger, offers more transportation policy: Currently, transit funding is separated from other types of infrastructure. He sees this inntown council debates. As Delegate, Joel will change that. It should be integrated so it can grow and evolve with population.
Next q: What are your priorities for transportation? Joel: Transportation is a quality of life issue. The Hogan gov has not treated it as such.. projects like purple line are rushed, not responsive to communities, and suffer botched rollouts. Need sustainable leadership.
First question, for each candidate, what differentiates you on the issues? Joel steps up: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only candidate making a case for security: security in our retirement, in our healthcare, and for our homeland.‚Äù #mdpolitics

A quick update from Joel following tonight's @actfortransit #MDPolitics forum  https://t.co/h8iZ7Jp9gn
Transportation is a unifying, bipartisan issue - I'll fight for our values in Congress.     @actfortransit forum #MDPolitics
Joel will be effective as he has been in the past in the house of reps - advocating for a deal with Iran. @actfortransit forum #MDPolitics
It's not the infrastructure that matters but the impact. We don't want a second bridge to nowhere. @actfortransit forum #MDPolitics
Transportation is a quality of life issue, and it isn't working for us. We currently have inequity.     @actfortransit forum #MDPolitics
RT @actfortransit: Audience question: do you support free tax supported transit mentioned in @drgridlock column? #mdpolitics #transit
#md has 80+ deficient bridges, we need and should use smart technology to work smarter on our #infrastructure. #md08 #actforum
As a MoC I'll promote buses and #brt which bridge us to a carbon free future, but we need to invest in it.
If we don't get this right and make smart investments in trans. we'll miss the boat on #climatechange leaving our kids a heavy burden.
Joel uses his @wmata #smartrip card daily-and has for a decade and a half. Riding informs smarter decisions as #md08 rep.
We need to start listening to the engineers as we make transportation decisions. I'll represent citizens, not developers. #md08 #actforum
Joel's vision for how to move us forward: prioritize the GROW Act, fight hard for $ in Congress and work together to advocate for #md08
