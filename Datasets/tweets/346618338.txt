I'm not the PILOT defender-in-chief. I just can't stand lazy arguments based on a total misunderstanding of how incentives do and don't work.
How could this $42 million be spent if the companies weren't here to pay the $42 million in taxes in the first place? Please answer, @tonyaajw https://t.co/jROWKDPtKP
Generally speaking, does land with oh let's say a 10-story office building and fully leased by an anchor tenant and a PILOT produce more tax revenue than if the land was vacant and unused? https://t.co/5m3miAKLNw
@tonyaajw @NoBearing And you might want to.check your CA archives for my background and what I know about this stuff.
@tonyaajw If the company isn't here - and therefore not paying taxes - then taxes can't be given away. Can you at least admit that is accurate? https://t.co/CyYTdso4HV
@tonyaajw @NoBearing Very aware of Amazon's concerns, and I use MATA every day. How do u fund MATA? With tax revenue. Your still not addressing my criticism. You're assuming company/companies would be here sans PILOT, right? That a the only way tax revenue can be "given away."
@tonyaajw @NoBearing Fyi, I wrote most of those stories for the CA, and partnered with Daniel on the Electrolux investigation. I covered these issues in Memphis for a decade.
Any land could "potentially produce taxes." I could "potentially " be a billionaire one day, but only if I buy a lottery ticket, or produce the next big thing in tech. Your solution seems to be to just hope a company comes here because it likes us. That's a dream, not a strategy. https://t.co/ipM0Lkt45X
Re: Electrolux. There is hope. The city could find another company to use site. Happened with Birmingham Steel. City invested heavily in Birmingham Steel site and it closed. Years later Nucor needed a new steel mill and Memphis was ready. Nucor operates there now.
@NoBearing @tonyaajw Ok, Dave. Say no to FedEx. What will you say when they move to Indianapolis. While you're at it say no to St. Jude too.
Gee, the city should also land Amazon's HQ2, but it's not. Of course the city should attract companies that don't need incentives. Problem is that company's don't exist. Hell,  look at the incentives Amazon will in fact receive. I'm talking about the real world not imaginary one. https://t.co/ipM0Lkt45X
@memphisnews @tonyaajw I'm only talking about PILOT program, not any other incentives. Just the PILOT program.
Asking again. The company's restructuring will cost $111 million. If history proves anything it's that Electrolux doesn't do much of anything without incentives. https://t.co/n1IMFIk2G6
@memphisnews @tonyaajw If a company isn't here and paying full taxes there's no $42 million. You can't spend what you don't have.
@memphisnews @tonyaajw "PILOTs siphoned off $42 million in property tax revenues from Memphis. That’s money that could have been used to boost the city’s schools and produce the kind of workforce that would attract companies without incentives." FALSE. Only true if company here sans PILOT.
@tonyaajw I'm not defending Electrolux, or even PILOTs. I just hate the argument that PILOTs "give away" tax revenue. It's disingenuous, lazy criticism based on a fundamental misunderstanding (or worse, intentionally misleading) of how the program works.
@tonyaajw in fact the PILOT is producing tax revenue. How much tax revenue was the vacant Electrolux land producing before it was developed? Not much? How much is it producing with factory and PILOT? More than it was when it was just fallow land.
@tonyaajw Watkins and you by extension argue that taxes "lost" because of PILOTs could pay for city services, a common misconception. The company wouldn't be here without a PILOT, so you're not losing a cent with the PILOT. In other words u can't spend what u don't have.
My problem with PILOT critics? They assume the companies would be here without the PILOT. They say the $33 million in taxes Electrolux avoided because of PILOT could be used for services. But that assumes Electrolux would be here to pay that $33 million in taxes. They wouldnt. https://t.co/88i0QINV4S

And that will come just as economic development officials want to argue, in some cases rightly so, that our incentives process should be easier to navigate, or streamlined. Tough sell given the Electrolux news. https://t.co/lRyiMOswnT

State always invested heavily in other areas - car plants in East TH, etc. - and local officials really pressed the state to finally step up for Memphis. I think it's terrible what Electrolux is doing &amp; strongly believe state &amp; local officials could have crafted better deal
The company walking away from its promises is terrible. Period. But some context is important. This deal was consummated just after the great recession and Memphis was desperate for jobs. https://t.co/4fsEp7nHwJ

@ryanpoe Can you imagine a council member saying sissified men? What would happen if a POTUS candidate attended a meeting where that was said? Outrage, and we would demand the candidate disavow that message and/or group.
@ryanpoe We wouldn't accept that kind of talk from anyone else. We would expect any organization to condemn that sort of vile language, offered in public at the group's largest annual meeting, and we should hold COGIC to the same standard.
@ryanpoe And to dismiss service industry concerns as just possible FB racism is too flippant. A lot of people work in that industry, I did, and to a person they hate working during COGIC. HATE IT.

@pjmaxmaloney @sylamore1 Wait, what? There's a constitutional right to go to a mall?
And that's why there's a big distrust of the police throughout this city. Not all cops are jerks drunk on power, but far too many are and they make life difficult for the good officers.
Sadly, the whole Wolfchase episode is a true look at how far too many cops act. The "keep talking and you'll go to jail" line, the twisting of mall policy on filming to intimidate the filmer, the bullying behavior, etc. Unfortunately this is how many cops act.

@wendi_c_thomas @winstondakid I traveled to Ohio as a 17 year old high school junior to see my first Grateful Dead show. My second, third and fourth shows came a year later just after senior year. We were a pretty wild bunch. Of course privilege allows us to get away with it. We didn't have cops in our hood.
@wendi_c_thomas @winstondakid We didn't drink at home! We went to parks, secluded areas, show homes in new subdivisions, in our cars. As we got older we would drink in the neighborhood. Take flasks to football games, etc. Then pot entered the scene and psychedelics.

I'd love to see @MayorMemphis and City Council use MATA for just one week to get to and from work, shopping, recreational events, etc. Not holding my breath though. https://t.co/qx6iUiyV9T
@MemphisBRU @wendi_c_thomas @tonyaajw Memphis can't be an Opportunity City if people can't get to work or school. Period. Currently, if your bus is late and u miss your connector you're screwed, because another bus won't be along for another hour.
For years, MATA has been the red-headed step child of city government. It's suffered a "slow death," death by a thousand cuts. And I highly doubt we'll see @MayorMemphis spend any political capital supporting the sales tax increase needed to fund the new service plan. https://t.co/qx6iUiyV9T
@Memphis3point0 And 3.0 will consider the MPO plan as the long range component is developed?
@craigfitzhugh @RepAkbari Great idea. I totally support this. Did the exchange program pass? HB2675
@Memphis3point0 Sorry, not trying to be obtuse. Just confused. Is the MPO TPB crafting the 2040 transportation plan? Or MPO TPB is working on a separate track, but using the 3.0 plan? Can you clarify?
@StevenReid901 Seem to recall a double-digit lead not long ago. Sure hope that's the case.
After all, Jim has never met a tax or fee increase he didn't want to kill. :)
Thanks again for response. Does the mayor plan on actively campaigning for the tax increase needed to fund the plan, or does he plan on leaving that to you MATA leadership &amp; supporters on the council, as I seem to recall previous statements indicating? https://t.co/lBoR9Ua6El
@brittneymemphis Great cause! Good luck!

There's an old saying that "generals are always fighting the last war" and this plan has a whiff of that. It gets us to where we should be right now (and the blame for that lies with previous administration's) but it doesn't really position us for the future. IMHumbleO https://t.co/lBoR9Ua6El
Thanks! Very familiar with it, and I know the proposed increased frequency will have huge positive real-world benefits for riders. But I guess I'm asking about a grand vision for public transit, including light rail, that positions us for decades to come. https://t.co/lBoR9Ua6El
In the early 2000s Tom Fox and MATA developed a light rail plan for Memphis. But the recession struck, and MATA, which was and is the red-headed stepchild of city government, shelved those plans. I'd say it's time to dust them off. Anyone focusing on this @MayorMemphis ?
Next month Nashville voters could approve a $5 billion transit system, including light rail. If approved, the already widening gap between Memphis and Nashville will stretch into a yawning chasm? What's our plan? @MayorMemphis
All other things being equal, many (most?) companies would choose the path of least resistance. If one community mandates hiring or contracting quotas and the other doesn't, my (informed) guess is that companies choose the one that doesn't. https://t.co/8MJzRjuIZ2
IDK. It's different for each company. But generally speaking any additional risk or uncertainty is probably viewed negatively. https://t.co/8MJzRjuIZ2
Yes, I am speaking about people earning a check as journalists. In fact, I thought that should've been done by now. It's one of the first calls I would've made. https://t.co/24obYW1mvY
@wendi_c_thomas After watching the local process for over a decade I consider myself something of an expert on it. :)
Good question about MMBC and BBA. Now that the plan is out and in the open, some enterprising journalist should ask them what they think. https://t.co/6EQSH0V5KO
I use MATA every single day. I would give anything for it to be a modern, efficient transportation system. Sadly, it's not, and that is a huge barrier to employment and advancement. Fixing this one service would be a boost to the economy, but that requires $ and political will https://t.co/hIwFAyH0Vh
In fact, these, not our incentives or process, are our key barriers. Incentives and process fall behind all of these areas. https://t.co/hIwFAyH0Vh
Those are all factors, no doubt about it! We can only fix those by growing the economic pie. Period. The government doesn't have money if we don't have a thriving, dynamic economy. https://t.co/hIwFAyH0Vh
I agree. In fact, I'd love to see you and @Rwsmith1977  - who I have no doubt has the best interests of the city and all her people at heart, just as you do - come together and maybe produce a plan we all agree on. https://t.co/YmEruPbWrd
@wendi_c_thomas @Rwsmith1977  I think my point about companies working with WMBEs after get established here is an important one. Many companies - IP, Service Master,etc. - fall in love with city once get here. They become huge Civic boosters. But we have 2 get them here first.
@wendi_c_thomas @Rwsmith1977  I guess I just don't see the "harm" in trying something new. And it's not like we'd be "losing" anything because currently we're not getting HQs/back office/advanced manufacturing. You can't "lose" what u don't have.
IDK. Possibly. The mandate would be lifted just for these specific efforts. However, companies would be incentiveized - through additional tax breaks - to do business with WMBEs. I think many would do that, maybe not at first but after they get here &amp; become established. https://t.co/wf2YhC0wiZ
What I witnessed, time and time again, is that the vast majority of businesses chose to go where the process was simpler and there was less uncertainty. Period. The current system, when compared to our neighbors &amp; competitors, isn't "simple." https://t.co/AHmft99TSh
I think what you'll hear from folks in the economic development arena is that Memphis' lack of success in recruitment under the current system is the empirical evidence that the current system doesn't work. https://t.co/1iTFKn5pg0
Again, just asking a question. Wouldn't African Americans, business owners and employees, stand to benefit if the proposed changes work, and Memphis recruits more HQs/back office/ advanced manufacturing? https://t.co/TgPGu86ed7

Can you imagine Joe "If it ain't painting Jesus it's got to go" Brown interacting with businesses considering coming to Memphis, or having a say in which companies get incentives? Lord have mercy. https://t.co/aivJfX87hy
More good news for the airport. Weren't some council members recently talking about asking Delta to re-open its high-priced hub here? Craziness. The airport has been steadily rebuilding service with a focus on low-cost carriers. I see no reason to change that strategy now. https://t.co/YLO9VNFoJb
Agreed. The economic development professionals I know, and to a degree admire for what they attempt to do for this city and her people, truly believe in their heart of hearts that Memphis can be just that, a juggeraut. But we have to "get out of our own way" first. https://t.co/QgoZg9M8iT
On the other hand, "oversight" can go too far. I do not want local legislators on the board approving incentives. They drag politics into what should be an apolitical, fact-driven process, and they are often deal killers.
I'm also open to the idea of no longer offering PILOTs to warehouse projects, unless the salaries are very, very strong. If, for this reason, a distribution or logistics company selects N. Mississippi over Memphis, then so by it. Memphians will still work in thiose jobs.
So, it looks like changes could be on tap for EDGE. But what kind of change do we want? Oversight is also very important, and I think that can be improved. Some PILOT receipients, including large employers enjoying significant tax svings, rely on temp services. That MUST stop.
And I do think EDGE could use a more "dynamic" salesman, or woman, at the top. The current leder is a very competent bureaucrat. He's just not the kinetic whirlwind, press-the-envelope personality I think would benefit EDGE, the city and county.
However, the incentives process in, oh say N. Mississippi, is much more streamlined. The application for incentives is (or was as recently as just a few years ago) literally only a few pages long. With EDGE, the application and paperwork can be as thick as a dictionary.
To be fair to EDGE, as a quasi-governmental agency they are just naturally going to be slower than a private organization like the Chamber. EDGE is dealing with public funds, which rightly demands a certain level of caution and transparency.
I also think Smith is correct when he charachterizes EDGE as "more bureaucratic than dynamic and deal making." And that has been the criticism the biz community has leveled at our recruiting efforts and incentives program for years. Just too hard doing biz in Memphis, they say.
Perhaps the Chamber can be criticized for focusing too much on distribution and logistics, especially lower paying pick and pack jobs, but they are laser-focused on bringing jobs to Memphis.
Any criticism leveled at the Chamber for not doing enough to sell Memphis is, IMO, misguided. The economic development team at the Chamber is the city's biggest booster/sales force. It's the first thing they think of in the morning and the last thing they think of at night.
@Rwsmith1977 pens a letter criticizing EDGE leadership and defending the Chamber's long-running efforts to "sell" Memphis. Smith is spot-on here. Couldn't agree with him more. https://t.co/wIlXoz2NC0

@jmay11 It's complicated. In some cases nobody was actually shot. The number appears to be 8 mass school shootings, 30 mass shootings overall in the country. One is too many. I'm tired of this shit happening, man.
@BizballMaury @PenaltyBoxBones Ok, buddy. Don't shoot the messenger!
@jmay11 Not the 18th school to experience mass shooting this year. That number is incorrect. One is too many, buy we shouldn't sacrifice accuracy in our quest for change.
@BizballMaury You said 18th mass school shooting. Yes, the number of overall mass shootings is outrageous. We're only a few months removed from the horror of Las Vegas. Yet it's hardly ever talked about. Until the next mass shooting. #oneistoomany

He could start by forming a task force that will explore and then provide guidance on how to dismantle this culture of failure. Establish grading policies that are so clear a third-grader can understand them. Have those crystal clear policies in place before next school year.
If Hopson is serious about helping kids, and I believe that he is, he needs to give this crisis of culture the attention it deserves. It must stop. Period.
That's an incredibly flimsy statement from Hopson, an attorney who l always found to be razor-sharp, in response to what is clearly a pervasive, entrenched culture within his school district. That's unacceptable, folks.
"I think one of the things we have to determine is, how much of that is just the natural pressure of people wanting to do well versus people pressuring folks in an unreasonable or illegal way?" said Hopson.
But SCS superintendent Dorsey Hopsin isn't prepared to admit the district is facing a massive culture crisis.
That culture appears to permeate the school district. Administrators ask teachers to change grades.  Vague "grade floor" policies. Possible salary losses tied, in part, to poor grades.

@wendi_c_thomas Hotel would probably boost theatre industry. Plus, Midtown sorely lacking in "nice" hotels. Tough call, though.
@wendi_c_thomas Wages are low but many would still gladly take those jobs. Wage numbers dragged down by restaurant too. In TN servers paid $2.13 an hour. 2
@wendi_c_thomas Have to weigh/consider/balance many things. Hotel with PILOT would produce more tax $ than parking lot. 1

@SABJArnold @sylamore1 @FlinnShady @MayorMemphis 5 and intense opposition that boiled down to, "council hates kids, give us more money." Turned convo to double taxation of Memphians.
@SABJArnold @sylamore1 @FlinnShady @MayorMemphis 4 Really a remarkable, and I think brave, move by that council. Impact will be felt for decades. Move was against all conventional wisdom
@SABJArnold @sylamore1 @FlinnShady @MayorMemphis 3 It was so ballsy and fresh thinking that it took a few days 4 me to convince a couple editors that effort was real &amp; likely to pass.
@SABJArnold @sylamore1 @FlinnShady @MayorMemphis 2 Total game-changer. I was brand new on city hall beat, as where most of the council members. I think 8 or 9 newly-elected members

@jmay11 @jacobsamuels Yep. I really hope one day we'll get a mayor &amp; 7 council members who say, "enough is enough," and go for it. Would love 2 see that debate.
A decision to somehow give up the city charter will take a ton of political courage and will. Maybe we'll get there one day. #MemphisFirst
My dream would be for city to dissolve it's charter like MCS did and force consolidation so everyone shares in community's cost and future.
I hope @MayorMemphis doesn't back down from this. Pushback from suburban developers and others will be intense. https://t.co/gLYbJnN6uJ

So we Memphians are paying for law enforcement in Lakeland, allowing that town to keep it's costs lower, which Lakeland uses against Memphis
An example. Thus far Lakeland has avoided creating a police force and relies on Sheriff's office for public safety. Why can't  Memphis?
... that fund the Sheriff's office. Why aren't they servicing us?Would put more officers on the street and reduce city cost. @MayorMemphis
I'd like to see @MayorMemphis call on Shelby County Sheriff's to patrol in Memphis. Memphians are county residents and as such  pay taxes...
Now, the suburbs have to pay for their own schools. School funding NEVER decreases. Never. Those suburban tax rates will creep up every year
For years Memphis suburbs and developers have used lower tax rates there against Memphis to attract residents, employers. Tide turning.
Love this decision. Memphis and Memphians need to stop subsidizing the suburbs. More of this please, @MayorMemphis ! https://t.co/gLYbJnN6uJ

@resqvol So you're freeloading off of Memphis taxpayers and complaining because the city is broke. If you &amp; others lived here more tax $
Agree https://t.co/6zz1wF32vR
@resqvol @FlinnShady There would be less money but for the PILOTs.
@resqvol no, I'm not. You still work for Memphis? You don't live here so quit bitching. You gave up that right when you fled.
But back property taxes on abandoned/blighted properties is a big problem, no?  https://t.co/T0ttr1hJ5K
@resqvol The taxes from those business fund public employee salaries! Do you even live in Memphis? Yes or no?

@memphismorris @mjtomek @memphisdaily Yes, as I said at the start of this the brewery will produce more tax $ with a PILOT than it does now.
RT @memphismorris: @mjtomek @HigdonCPM @amosSmaki don't confuse biz pilots with development pilots. Very different.
Yep. Cities, counties, states in tough spots because companies can always choose the next place that says "yes." https://t.co/0ak0cSt32W
@mjtomek @HigdonCPM ..but when the SC Sheriff is handing out $60k and $80k jobs to retired politicians and appointees you have to wonder.
Agree. I don't think about it often, but what the hell do we get for that $1.2 billion? Schools are big part of it.. https://t.co/teLj3UdDt5

Exactly. Wouldn't be a need for them.  https://t.co/3sX9zrBLNB
@mjtomek @HigdonCPM But it's so true. People always talk about Memphis tax rate but rarely mention the Shelby County tax rate or budget.

Great point here, Matt. County taxes get a pass in this discussion way too often. https://t.co/BiQyfAIx88
@mjtomek Vast majority of city budget goes to two divisions, after all. Police and Fire.
@mjtomek But since the city is in such desperate need of money shouldn't cops &amp; firefighters "do the right thing" &amp; live in Memphis?
Yes, I am.  https://t.co/VVGCt6zSmx
@mjtomek Matt, it's pretty clear the project won't get done. It's been EMPTY for DECADES.
@mjtomek Large majorities of police and fire employees don't live in Memphis, yet make a decent living off the city.
@mjtomek Your making the same argument some make when they call for residency rules for firefighters and cops.
So you want a charity to redevelop it? Which one?  https://t.co/jv1cjnPSre
@mjtomek What is your point?
@mjtomek Not in favor or against. Just asking basic questions. The project obviously wouldn't happen without the PILOT.
@mjtomek Do you prefer a decaying eyesore,empty for decades, that produces little taxable revenue? Or a vibrant place that produces $?
They'll be paying more in taxes with a PILOT than the building is producing now. That's raising revenue, right? https://t.co/4Ylin2uLdm

@tvia84 @treyheath Totally agree re: sales pitch and that's why I said an independent third-party review would be a good move.
@tvia84 @treyheath .. improvement but it's light years ahead of where it was just a few years ago.
@tvia84 @treyheath I'll say Trey and Reid have made great strides in making PILOT info more accessible to public. Still room for ...
@tvia84 @treyheath EDGE has posted a ton of data on its website. I would agree that independent, third-party assessment would be useful
@tvia84 not saying you're guilty of that either. Anyway, good conversation!
@tvia84 And look, I'm not a "fan" of the PILOT or anything. Just see a lot of misunderstanding and criticism without solutions/alternatives.
@treyheath @tvia84 Trey is the authority on the PILOT program. Thanks, Trey! Point is PILOT recipients do pay taxes. Many think they don't
@tvia84 But if the company doesn't locate here or moves away because it doesn't get a PILOT then city and county aren't collecting anything.
@tvia84 .. only a handful of companies that fled after PILOT term. There's no doubt some have left but I don't think it's a high percentage.
@tvia84 Anecdotally, I would venture to say the vast majority of companies stay. Having dealt with this issue for a decade I can think of ..
@tvia84 Where would the "many more" jobs come from? Jobs allow people to buy homes and buy goods/services, which contributes to tax base.
@tvia84 With a PILOT and developed they produce more in tax revenue than vacant land. Then they come off PILOT and pay full taxes.
@tvia84 But there is no guarantee that would happen. Take industrial developers for example. Many own vacant land here and not building.
@tvia84 But there's no guarantee that it WOULD be. You seem to be assuming that a company would come in, invest and pay full taxes.
@tvia84 So the PILOT property produces more tax revenue than a vacant/idle property or building.
@tvia84 formerly abandoned building back to use, city and county receive more tax revenue than if building/property remained vacant.
@tvia84 ... assume the company would be here anyway when that's just not the case. If a company moves to town and gets PILOT and puts ...
@tvia84 In many cases the company wouldn't be here if not for the PILOT. City/County can't give away what they never had. Many people ...
@tvia84 Understand. But that's assuming a PILOT company would choose to be here without a PILOT and pay full taxes.
@tvia84 Yes, A PILOT project is a publicly subsidized project. The subsidy is in exchange for new or retained jobs and capital investment.
.. are "giving away" taxes is faulty because city and county can't "give away" something they never had in the first place.
And there is no guarantee a company with a PILOT would locate in the city or county without said PILOT so assumption that city and county ..
Companies with PILOTs often then pay taxes on land/property that was formerly vacant and producing little to no revenue. Also provide JOBS
PILOTs are an easy political target and very misunderstood. While imperfect, it is the only major incentive the city and county have.
See a lot of complaining about PILOTs and city benefit cuts but precious few ideas on what to do about it.
.@kwhalum You said media has ignored your PILOT ideas/talk and then you want to block a reporter who does ask you about it?
@kwhalum I understand that. Many of those folks have jobs at companies that have a PILOT.
@kwhalum Why would you want to block me for asking your opinion? What's up with that?
@kwhalum I'm just asking you to share  ideas on how to solve the problem and how PILOTs play into that and your thoughts on improving PILOT
@kwhalum When PILOT rules were tightened/more strict elected folks then complained not enough jobs were coming and loosened them again.
@kwhalum the question is how do you cover the unfounded liability. PILOT program has been studied inside and out, up and down.
@kwhalum I'm trying to understand what you're proposing. What are you proposing the city do? City, county many others involved in review.
@kwhalum How else does the city pay for it. If you have an unfounded liability you need revenue from somewhere to pay for it, right?
@jungleroomcom @kwhalum people have long said we don't have enough tools in economic development toolbox.
@kwhalum just asking based on some of the tweets. Few months ago EDGE launched review of PILOT system. I wondered what your ideas were.
@kwhalum please tell Mrs. Whalum I said hello!
@kwhalum How else would the city fill the gap? It's either cuts or more revenue. Perhaps we could discuss over fish n chips.
@kwhalum Raise taxes to fund municipal benefits and do away with business incentives?

Make a run now!
Guards, please for the love of God box out!

Defense! Make em work for it! #GritNGrind
I'm getting there “@BeauregardJones: Just F you so much OKC now I hate you Clipper level you weak assed team”
Of like to see us put somebody on their ass, Rambis style.
Hard to adjust to them draining everything they put up “@ministerdbrown: Unless Coach makes an adjustment, our season is over. #GritGrind”
That could do it, folks. But it's also hard to believe OKC can keep up this shooting pace.
Ugh
Defense!
Now we have to get stops. Only way we'll stay in this thing.
Have to establish some form of identity on offense right now. Appear aimless
