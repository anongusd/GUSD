The fake punt wasn‚Äôt a totally bad call. The bad call(s) were the decision to fake into a run for 11 yards and not adjust when everyone saw Bama line up to play safe against a fake.
Notre Dame shouldn‚Äôt be considered for the playoffs until the play a conference title game. Or make conference title games irrelevant to the playoffs.

@srankin Indeed on the automazation. But I‚Äôm reading recent news and markets and I do see a resurgence in domestic manufacturing. My larger point was the article avoided that the company moved jobs south to SC. They didn‚Äôt close up
@JHazlette @Bakari_Sellers You‚Äôve missed my point. And I appreciate you‚Äôre contribution here. Trump can‚Äôt control the company moving jobs around. They NYT piece is based on a lie.

@godiskeisha @realDonaldTrump No president should get as much or as little credit for the economy. We are full of working individuals. It‚Äôs our credit. But the article was based on bad research. Moved jobs to another state. Carry on
@SawyersRobyn @Bakari_Sellers Again, no one can measure economic policy in less than a year. I agreed his campaign rhetoric was bad. But this story was written on 1plant that moved its jobs to SC. So it‚Äôs fake. Undeniably so
@NancyNills You haven‚Äôt read the thread, nor the article. Please do.
@MRD1st When making a point, the burden on proof is on you. I‚Äôm sure Trump has used foreign steel as a private builder. As have too many. As POTUS, I want proof. You prove it.
@rickluna1 @dellcine @Bakari_Sellers No worries. @Bakari_Sellers and I were having a good conversation (need more of that). My point was; economic policy needs time to work and this specific company moved jobs to a SC steel mill. NYT didn‚Äôt cover that.

@Bakari_Sellers I had to look it up, but yes it‚Äôs true. The same company that is cutting jobs in PA is reopening the Georgetown, SC Steel Mill with 200 new jobs. I‚Äôd suggest the entire article is misconstrued. https://t.co/GXpbdwDcb2
@BMDon4U @Bakari_Sellers I‚Äôm not sure what he nailed. I agree about the rhetoric. But economic policies cannot be measured in less than one year. My next tweet addressed that point.
@ragley Agree completely. Yet they are often the arbiters of what goes public in a crisis. I‚Äôve had a few aggressive negotiations with clients lawyers.
@Bakari_Sellers I‚Äôll cede completely his campaign rhetoric was beyond the pale. I‚Äôve put my head through that wall a lot. But i actually think in ~5 years we may see a resurgence...in the anti union south.
@ragley Lol. We‚Äôd totally do it. But even we can‚Äôt overcome the idiot grip legal has on the c suite at major companies. We get locked out.

He thought you Americans were so easy to manipulate. He believed his star power would seduce you. That's what he thinks of you. #2

Moral of my story is, don't get in trouble in Clemson. You will be prosecuted if it involves a local or money making athlete
In Clemson, you better not call the cops if a football player is involved. You may never see the next day.
One female Clemson athlete was an Olympic star. Her star football BF beat her. They did nothing until media found out.
Clemson suits up entire team of women who've been beaten by male athletes. Bit doesn't get play locally. National media has to expose.
Then there was the Clemson kicker last year who got busted with a small mountain of cocaine. He didn't do any time until media found out.
Then there was Clemson Headcoach Dabo whose brother was stopped by police. He attacked the officer the poor officer was fired. Because Jesus
We can illustrate how 1 Clemson star üèà player beat his girlfriend w/ a towel rod and nothing happened until media. 1 game suspension
