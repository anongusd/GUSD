Just like how the US said it would pull out of Syria in 2017 and a few days later there was a "chemical attack" by Assad. Unconfirmed even by the OPCW that Assad did said attack. We need to get out of there and let Syria deal with Syria and ISIS how they please.

Yes, 2018 was a big win for Democrats. But the gains were not in places where we needed to win. Okay, we flipped seats in California and New York. Two deep blue states. Congrats. But to win Middle America we need a stronger message.
It is easy to blame a scapegoat and not really look at the uglies that have impacted and eroded the parties ideals. When Democrats and liberals began to get comfortable with embracing Neo-cons towards the middle of the 2016 elections, I began to worry.
There is this continued perceived notion that Democrats love to fall back on and that is to blame everything on "X" and nothing else. Instead of admitting that they have completely dropped the ball when it comes to immigration, trade, healthcare, income inequality, etc.

...that the American people are sick of reading about. WE are being cheated by not only our government and bad trade deals but we our workers are being cheated by being put up against $1 a week workers in China. Wake up Democrats. Let's make trade actually fair.
Tariffs are also just another form of taxing the middle class. Tariffs also don't hurt countries like China because the way the "Free-Trade" system is set up, there are plenty of loopholes for their goods to be sold in the US. This is the sort of unregulated globalization...
As he should. The American middle class has been decimated by NAFTA and so called "Free-Trade." 		Trade has become such a complex multinational mess where working conditions are forgotten about and workers rights in more countries are non-existent.
"Meanwhile, the president has expressed his desire to change the trade landscape even more dramatically, by threatening withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization."	https://t.co/VU0fX9qgAQ

Governments need to really work on transparency and coherent visions of the future. When we call for tax increases, there needs to be a clear and distinct reason for said increase. When governments take action, the citizenry need to be informed. This isn't rocket science.
From Red Hats in the US to Yellow Vests in France, our leaders need to wake up and realize there are people who are suffering. But we also can not forget those who have continuously felt the brunt of economic perils the working class has faced.	https://t.co/XB94eCKraY

The Obama administration also gave $60 BILLION to the Saudi regime in an arms deal back in 2010. These liberals are losing the fight on common sense because there is such distain for the President. It is frightening how moronic some people are and how many people flock to them.
Plenty of administrations have embraced and allowed the Saudis to purchase billions of dollars of US assets and control policy in Washington. To pretend Trump is the only president to embrace this regime is disingenuous.
The Obama administration supported the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worried the fight would distract from the more important battle against the Islamic State.

I remember when @GovHowardDean called for Tulsi to essentially resign for speaking truth to power. There are so many left leaning Think Tanks that are funded by the Saudis and I am sure they won't be giving that money back or donating it.
I find it funny that liberals, democrats, republicans and conservatives are all now denouncing Saudi Arabia when they have been preforming these kinds of atrocities for DECADES. But because of the political climate we are in now it is popular to now denounce the Saudis. https://t.co/iyiDIdlvgG

@Smitty_1911 @Brunsj09 No victim role playing here. 🤣
@Smitty_1911 Well I will stick to the fact that both Gore and Clinton ran horrible campaigns and didn’t have a winning message for disenfranchised voters and you can keep putting part of the blame on our democratic system.
@Smitty_1911 You can keep on with these snide remarks. I know that’s what you’re good at. 😂
@Smitty_1911 You are using that name as a scapegoat. Again. Gore didn’t even win his home state in that election. There was more to the 2000 election than Nader. To say that Nader cost the 2000 election is again, flawed.
@Smitty_1911 The notion that third party candidates sway elections is a faceleas argument.
@Smitty_1911 And Gary Johnson (who got more votes than Stein) is a Republican and if either of them were in the ballot would have resulted in the same result. So your initial premise that Stein cost Hillary the presidency falls apart on that logic.
@Smitty_1911 It wasn’t Jill Stein or Gary Johnson who cost Hillary the election. In the last decade the Democratic Party has been decimated as a political powerhouse. The party has become the party of wealthy Wall Street and Silicon Valley billionaires and have abandoned the middle class.
@Smitty_1911 I’m well aware that the presidency isn’t picked by popular vote. So you can stop these undue history lessons. To pretend that people voting third party only pulled from Hillary is laughable and completely naive.
@MSNBC, @FoxNews and @CNN are all a complete circus of crazy. Why I love @cspan. 🤣

@Tremayne_Smith Back in 2015 in light of Windsor and Obergefell the State Department would towards marriage as the gold standard and slowly phase out recognition and benefits of other forms of partnership. Many advocates including GLIFFA pushed back hard on this.

To be frank. I think Kavanaugh should resign. His actions alone in his testimony yesterday is clear that he will not be able to be impartial on large legal matters. But both sides have treated this nomination with total disrespect and buckled to the prevailing political climate.
He is a key vote! This is why Democrats on the Committee SHOULD NOT BE LEAVING! But them leaving is kind of symbolic to how they have treated voters for the past decade. https://t.co/2vmKacEwk0

@KyleIM Oh I can believe it. Republican voters are going to LOVE this.
Exhibit A. https://t.co/BiF0bQabKa
A very unpopular opinion.....but Kavanaugh is reacting how Republicans will love for him to react.
Kavanaugh is PISSED.
This is not surprising at all. https://t.co/th2nmRcry2
@jayctigerfan @hellodaddy__ Personally, I don't think term limits would all of a sudden bring about some bipartisan work in Congress. I actually think it would actually suppress voter turn out in fact and make primaries virtually unnecessary. We already have a system for term limits. It's called voting. lol
@jayctigerfan @hellodaddy__ Trust me. You'd be the first person I would want to sit down with, have  a drink and discuss this throughly.....but.....you moved. 🤣
@hellodaddy__ @jayctigerfan Oh I totally agree. But with folks I have been discussing it with it has only been going by yes/no. So I am just polling by what the conversation has been leaning towards. I would love to have a dialogue about the ins and outs but for the most part there is no if, ands or buts.
I may already know the answer to this but......do you believe in term limits?

@MitchSSimon Me either. What an age we live in, huh.
@Smitty_1911 I would love for a constructive dialogue! 😁
@MitchSSimon Ending 2018......Collins wins NY-27 and Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. The GOP plays dirty and they don't care.
The only way I see Kavanaugh not being nominated is if Trump pulls his nomination or Kavanaugh withdrawals.
@Smitty_1911 The only way we "let" those members keep their jobs is if folks don't vote. So we have to battle the notion that voting doesn't matter. Hence why I think term limits is a blind solution to a problem.
@Smitty_1911 As for House Members "not working" that is fundamentally not true. Being a member of Congress is hard. I think it is easy to pass off the idea that members of Congress don't work a lot but there is a lot that goes into running an office on Capitol Hill.
@Smitty_1911 We have seen in this years primaries that when young blood challenge the status quo...that's when we can change Congress. Putting term limits didn't help primary challengers with platforms that represent their constituents.
@Smitty_1911 With all due respect there are plenty of flaws in your argument for term limits. As a citizenry we need to vote. When primary numbers are less than 20% in primaries that is not the fault of the member of Congress that is the fault of the constituents.

@Tremayne_Smith @ChuckGrassley WE AGREE! 😂🤣😂
@Smitty_1911 Members of the house are up for re-election every two years. Working on a bipartisan fashion is virtually impossible especially in this climate. So giving members of Congress X amount of years to do their jobs isn’t the best course of action.
@Smitty_1911 We need to fix our political financing system rather than term limits in my opinion. If a politician is serving the interest of their community then they deserve to be in that position. Also to push for legislation that can help their constituents.
Though I don’t support term limits.....@ChuckGrassley is making a strong case for them.

@Tremayne_Smith Unfortunately the two biggest nuclear frontmen are Trump and Putin. We have to live with the consequences and until the Dems learn to stop only embracing Silicon Valley and Wall Street and fight for the working class, you will see more Trumps in the world win elections.
@Tremayne_Smith I’m in no way, shape or form a Trump sympathizer. What he is doing domestically is plain awful. But I’m trying to open the eyes of Democrats to see that being the party of Russiagate will not win back the House, Senate or Executive Branch.
@Tremayne_Smith I’m not deflecting I’m just stating facts. This administration has done more against Russian interests internationally than any other previous administration. I’m fighting against the notion that Russia is a nation at which we should be at war with.

She didn’t give in to these bogus talking points about indictments (which first year law students should know is based on NO evidence) and establishment name calling. Democrats aren’t embracing the lessons they should have learned in 2016 and are already starting to demonize her.
Until the Democratic Party figures out to once again become the voice of the working class, we will continue to see Trumpish candidates continue to run and win. That is why the victory of @Ocasio2018 was so exciting for us on progressive end because she focused on the issues.

@Tremayne_Smith Yes. I'm not affiliated with those who praise and retweet necons and war mongers like Schmidt, Kristol and From. Something that has been all too prevalent in the Democratic and liberal establishment. Just because they are anti-Trump doesn't mean they get a pass.

@SawyerHackett @Tremayne_Smith I AM NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU GUYS ON THIS! What is happening is utterly disgusting. I am just saying that to imply Republicans are doing nothing is not ultimately true. I don't agree at all at what they propose will solve the issues and I support the Feinstein bill.
@Tremayne_Smith First off Tremayne. After all our talks you clearly don't know my political stances and we should probably keep it that way. If you want to be a supporter of Schmidt, a man who calls those who opposed the Iraq war as "Un-American" and who worked for Dick Chaney in which he said..
@SawyerHackett @Tremayne_Smith ....when I bring up that immigration and the separation of families is viewed as immoral on both sides. I totally understand that one side is more apathetic towards immigration (Rs) than the other but I am just trying to say that finger pointing is going to get us nowhere.
@SawyerHackett @Tremayne_Smith Just because I bring up that there is legislation being proposed doesn't mean I support it one bit. What Cruz is proposing is just quicker deportation and complete lack of empathy towards asylum seekers. I have no idea why there is so much animosity (not from you)
@Tremayne_Smith I’m well aware that that administration is Republican so thank you (?) for the clarification. But last time a checked the Senate is not part of the administration. You’re completely undermining my whole argument here about bipartisanship with recycled talking points.
@DebtCrisisOrg I’m going to keep retweeting this until this issue is truly addressed and not used as a political tool.
RT @DebtCrisisOrg: Today, the student debt crisis reached $1,549,512,148,055
@Tremayne_Smith @SawyerHackett Zero Democrats will back the Cruz and Cronyn bill that will address family separation as well. Again, to pretend only one side is concerned about family separation at the border is fundamentally false. Can I also emphasize that I support the Feinstein bill.
...nothing to combat this administrations disgusting and inhumane treatment of immigrant children is irresponsible. This needs to be a bipartisan effort.
Your initial tweet was extremely vague and misleading to start. To imply Republicans don’t support, in your words “a bill” is my first issue with said tweet. Cruz introduced legislation (if you like it or not) on Monday. To pretend Republican Senators are doing or plan on doing..

@Brunsj09 I completey disagree about the endorsement point. Like I stated, it's not an issue that a woman should endorse a women. It's the issue that Clinton proclaimed herself as a "progressive" during the latter part of the campaign. NYS is and has been corrupt for decades.
@Brunsj09 If I remember during the campaign someone said “There is a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” Plus this isn’t toward Clinton herself it’s against the prevailing orthodoxy within the Democratic Party.

@Tremayne_Smith But also this is 2018 where a wave election COULD happen but I don't see the disenfranchisement that voters felt back in 2006 and 2008 that could carry Dems into a wave. Who knows though! It's still exciting to see the energy.
@Tremayne_Smith This is cute but I still don't share your optimism. Just because a district moves from "Likely" to "Lean" R (based on data) doesn't mean Democrats will win the district. In 2016, one D won out of 12 "Lean R" districts. Where R's picked up 3 out of 7 "Lean D" districts.

I could go on about Syria and I have not fully displayed my disgust with the way the media has dealt with the whole NK/Trump deal. But Twitter allows only so much and my mind is moving faster than my hands. 😂
Those on the left and the right continue to recycle the same "America can fix everything" mentality that got us into an un-winnable war in Iraq. We are making the same mistake in Syria right now and there will be dire consequences if continue thees antiquated strategies.
When folks like Maddow foam at the mouth regarding the thought of having a dialogue with NK, they are continuing the one sided escalation and unreasonable disdain for a country that is just trying to function without western interference.
National pride isn't something that is unique only to North Korea. Also the continued fallacy that men in NK only have a handful of haircut options continues to be a talking point for pro-war NK opponents. But back to the US involvement.
For example, Pyongyang has been a robust city that excels in green energy and heavy investments in the education of it's citizenry. Now you can have the opinion that these people are being brainwashed with pro-NK rhetoric but in hind site doesn't the US do the exact same thing?
...who have been on the ground. When people from the west criticize the DPRK and Kim as some cartoonish ruler, they undermine the lives the people live within this nation. Just a simple YouTube search can show the progress NK has made even under heavy sanctions since the 50s.
But I will get into a more broader misconception and bold face fabrications of what we are being fed about North Korea. Same argument could be given the Syria as well. Let's start with actual life in the DPRK. Not from corrupt and unnamed government sources but from journalists..
So this morning I come across tweets regarding @maddow and her tirade regarding @realDonaldTrump planning to meet with Kim. This is utterly embarrassing and hypocritical not only for her but MSNBC as a whole. I will not get into the fact that Obama also planned on meeting Kim.

The hypocrisy is stunning (mostly in the Senate) when it comes to privacy issues. I’m sick and tired of our Congress and the fake care of their constituents.
Democrats and Republicans alike can’t complain about privacy when half the folks yell that our country is being run by a toddler but will give the NSA more secrecy power to spy on it’s own citizens.
So when DINO Durbin presented his condescending questions, I was extremely ticked off at the fact that he was implying that Facebook was forcing people to advertise what they like or where they are.
So to wrap up this whole social media Facebook frustration. We heard a lot of people asking Zuckerberg if there would be more “opt-out/opt-in” options. 		🗣FACEBOOK ITSELF IS OPTIONAL!

#Zuckerberg Testimony Day 2 in a nutshell.		Dems: How much do we need to regulate you until you become a government entity?		Repubs: Why does my Mother-in-law keep poking me?
@Tremayne_Smith If he had accomplishments to speak about I would agree with this but other than tax cuts.....he hasn't done much. I read AEI needs a new President so I wouldn't be surprised if that is where he goes. Senate or Think Tank.
I think Paul Ryan is going to announce his run for Senate against Baldwin. Could you imagine.......Ryan and Romney in the Senate? Oy!
@Brunsj09 What?!
I AM SHOOK-ITH BY THIS AD! This will be a tough Democratic Primary for the 1st district of Wisconsin. This new revelation regarding Ryan (if true) will be a tough battle for Democrats but they have two strong candidates which is exciting. https://t.co/ePHobeZTOi
@Tremayne_Smith The only thing is that the 1st district is a solid Republican stronghold but there are only two candidates in the Republican primary so I wonder who would possibly step up. Paul Nehlen has ran against Ryan before but only got 15% of the primary vote so he's not very popular.
@Tremayne_Smith THIS IS HUGE!

The only folks who are "emboldened" are those like John Bolton, Bill Kristol and David Frum who are salivating at the mouth to go to war and decimate the Middle East. The media is and continues to do a disservice to those they are accountable to. The American people.
I am getting continuously frustrated at the polarization against ANYTHING this administration does on a daily basis. This fight or flight reaction by those in the media is becoming extremely dangerous and misguided. The media is taking the sides of Bush Era neocons.
I'm sorry and this is a rarity but I have to side with the WH on this one. The notion that the will to get troops out of the Middle East has "emboldened" acts like this is just completely moronic.

@thenewyorkdose what we should talk about when legalizing marijuana is how it (as of right now) only positively impacts predominately white &amp; gentrified cities while there is still mass incarceration of people of color. There is a constant misconception on the discussion of pot.
based on facts and not demonize the substance and those who use it. I can see the reason why your guests would be against it but the things they were saying was just factually wrong. But overall another great episode. :)
Also, this notion that the government is pushing to regulate marijuana is again, completely false. States are struggling to keep or even get state legalization passed through their own state legislatures. When we talk about legalization of marijuana we should have a discussion
when I heard completely fact-less opposition to those who use marijuana on a regular basis, it truly irked me. There is absolutely no study that suggests the substance negatively impacts the brain. In fact there are studies that support the exact opposite of that.
@thenewyorkdose loved the latest episode (as usual) but I have to take up one part that I had a fundamental disagreement with and that was the section when the discussion turned to those who smoke marijuana. Now personally I am not an avid smoker in the least bit but...

I’m going to be frank here. I’m getting kind of fed up with this notion that ANYTHING Trump does is right away seen as a disaster. Ex. what is possibly going to take place with the North Korean dictator. Yes, Trump isn’t my ideal person to start diplomatic talks with  NK but it

This is a very chilling trend that the Democratic Party and their operatives are and have been taking against those who don't conform with establishment ideals.
We can have differences of opinions and if you think a campaign is a joke, then let the candidates debate on their merits and let the voters decide and not sling mud from the beginning.
Cardin is no doubt a great Senator for the state of Maryland but when journalists and opinion writers portray a candidate in a primary as an agent of the Kremlin, it deters those who care deeply about the state of the party to actually run.
People may not see @xychelsea Senate campaign as a threat but to constantly portray her candidacy as a joke or not serious is a huge mistake. She is running on a platform that is popular but is also dismissed by establishment Dems. https://t.co/NJvsYdYTWA
So @Dennis_Kucinich is a well qualified politician who is running to be the Ohio Governor and no one in the MSM seems to even give a care. He would make a great Governor.

Someone is bitter that he got called out and looked like a fool on live TV. 😂 https://t.co/Pl6Na07CYl
This book and this mindset is not going to win over folks for 2018. This wave is rapidly shrinking and it's all due to the fact that Hollywood and media elites are blind to what the real issues real Americans are facing.
It is an absolute joke that folks like @HillaryClinton, @johnlegend, @cher etc. would read from that trash book. I know it was just for fun but the person behind the book is a complete scumbag and they are feeding into gross narratives.
Michael Wolff
When confronted Wolff is a complete coward and buckles when he is called out on a obscure accusations and assumptions. The fact that a sleazy man like that can make millions over nothing is unfathomable. I hope everyone who purchases that book enjoys the nonsense.
Wow. I never would have thought I would say this but I am very impressed with @morningmika and how she just put @MichaelWolffNYC to task about his trash of a "book." This man is making millions on a fake and grossly indecent pile of paper.

@AdrianXpression He is one of the most scripted members of Congress. Since his time in office (2013) he has only had 1 bill enacted. Looking at his record with bills he has put forward....he is not the future of they Democratic Party.
@Tremayne_Smith @RepJoeKennedy No, I don’t dislike the guy. He just seems so scripted. I have never heard him off the cuff. Every time he speaks on the floor or anywhere it seems like he studies his speeches. I’d rather have @rosadelauro to be honest. Her passion doesn’t sound artificial. 🤷🏼‍♂️
RT @briantashman: Trump finally seems passionate about something: preserving human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay
@Tremayne_Smith @RepJoeKennedy Why is he whispering doe?! 😂
@AyannaPressley just take over this #DemocraticResponse please. Congressman Kennedy is not doing it for me at all.
Also, why is he whispering?
Joe Kennedy gives the same speech every time. He uses the same tone and speaking patterns. It’s bland and uninspiring. Why did the Dems pick this guy?
Should I live tweet the #STOU tonight? 🤔
DEAD! 🤣😂🤣 https://t.co/pEZF6XEspa
The Crop of Engineers has a large queue of projects on the table that if not funded in some way could take over 17 years to complete. This is completely unacceptable. There are over 50k bridges that are just a mess. Let's get serious about infrastructure for once!
@realDonaldTrump please do not toy with infrastructure tonight. The American people need a robust plan to create jobs and rebuild out completely outdated and crumbling roads and bridges.
Multi-employer pension plans are going to be drastically cut in states where Trump promised they would't have to worry about their financial futures. To find out that the Treasury Secretary and the Administration has no plan whatsoever is sad but not surprising.
Democrats are the only ones who have a proposal on the table to help save pensions. Some states are estimating to have a 70% loss in pensions for retirees. There is absolutely NO PLAN on the Republican side to deal with major issues middle America is facing.
While listening to the Senate Banking Committee hearing with the Treasury Secretary, I hear about the Butch Lewis Act of 2017. I don't get why the Secretary wouldn't say if he would even look into the logistics of this bill.

@skipkune Because these are real issues that got him elected. I hate his boasting as much as you do but we do at times have to listen. His words in the end could be his downfall and a key for actual Dems to use against him in 2020. Oprah and members of congress can't do it alone. lol
@skipkune I'm hoping that he won't be as broad speaking has he was in his first address. Highly unlikely but if he starts touting his plans on immigration, infrastructure, etc. it is an opportunity to hold him accountable. (Which many on the Republicans haven't been.)

I really wish @daemencollege president would be willing to throw his name in the ring for the New York Gubernatorial Race.
It is easy for someone like Cuomo, who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth to attack and lambaste folks who work hard to shape the next generation of leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. Shame on Cuomo and I truly hope he only stays a loud mouth Governor.
I am ashamed that Cuomo would even think about attacking those who work for private institutions as if they are out for the money. I'm telling ya, I have only worked for private institutions and I have worked for close to nothing and have even volunteered my time with no pay.
The success rates of students post graduation at private institutions is above and beyond most schools within the SUNY system.
I can tell you this much, if I had a time machine I would for sure have preferred to have gone to private college rather than the state run debt machines that SUNY system creates.
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING HIGHER EDUCATION BEING USED AS A POLITICAL TOOL AND TALKING POINT.
Anyone who argues that he is trying to make higher education more accessible to those who can't afford it have absolutely no leg to stand on. The excelsior program alone is a GIANT farce that was pushed through and ill conceived.
Cuomo continues his assault on private institutions by not listening to the education leaders and only following what is "politically popular." His track record in Higher Ed is a complete joke.
Andrew Cuomo is the biggest threat to higher education in the state of New York. What Albany and his administration are doing to not only private institutions but to students who prefer a more intimate learning experience is a shame. https://t.co/GWtR0JDfx1

Yes, quotation marks are highly needed these days.
We are dealing with a political landscape that doesn't base anything on facts or evidence anymore. It is only emboldened by the combatant talking heads that stir up ratings for their respected "news" organizations.
As inappropriate as a "war on the deep state" is troubling. To throw out McCarthyism as a one sided tactic is laughable. There are folks that work in "the deep state" that want to find truth so this "war" on the deep state is troubling as well.
@Morning_Joe is implying @FoxNews is invoking McCarthyism while MSNBC, CNN etc. have been pushing a no evidence based Russian collusion story within the Trump administration.

Conversations between those on the left just become a nodding head game. They all use the same playbook and there is no room for differing opinions. It’s a travesty and a shame.
The way the left just utterly dismisses EVERYTHING and EVERYONE that disagrees with their non-fact based accusations is just plainly pathetic. Those who conform are complacent.
The “left” in America is a complete joke. Glenn nails this perfectly and their lack of acknowledgement is going to cost them not only 2018 elections but also the presidency in 2020. https://t.co/M9kY9F9UWN
