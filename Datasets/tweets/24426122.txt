@VerizonSupport You are going to send someone today. We aren‚Äôt going to wait anymore. This is absolutely unacceptable. This is he bullshit that companies in third world countries get away with.

@VerizonSupport You have provided the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever seen a company provide. Your technician lied and ended up closing our ticket. It‚Äôs unacceptable for it to take 2 days to get someone out here, only to have them cancel for no reason - on a reoccurring issue.
@VerizonSupport Words mean nothing. Had a technician call me before scheduled time this morning to say he was coming. No one was home and I asked him to stick to the original time of 12-2pm and he agreed. He ended up closing our ticket. I want to talk to Ken Dixon, your head of Customer Service.

@baywatchboy Well he got $84 million to be selfish and not a team leader elsewhere. It‚Äôs a joke of an organization under Snyder. Pretty soon I‚Äôm even going to start to turn them off, and the media will have little to do with it.
@baywatchboy Losing has more to do with it than the media. Loyal fans can have their own opinion and not let the media influence it. They nitpicked a good QB out the door after not having a franchise QB since Joe Theisman. People are fed up with this crap. The media has little to do with it.
@baywatchboy @kevinsheehanDC You don‚Äôt think years of losing has anything to do with it?
@kevinsheehanDC @baywatchboy No. That‚Äôs what happens with a quarter of a century of ineptitude and mismanagement. Fans eventually won‚Äôt care and won‚Äôt buy merchandise. Hit Snyder in his pocket book until he sells the team. Tired of this crap!

@ASmittay5 @seldo @fivethirtyeight I agree. You're preaching to the choir. Just saying us supporting the Muslim Brotherhood is f'ing wrong.
@seldo You're right. Then it's bigotry. And it's hypocrisy when it comes to supporting regimes that mistreat women.
@seldo It makes them hypocrites and aiding racism. I'm tired of dems accusing the other side of crap they're clearly guilty of.
@ASmittay5 Instead of supporting radicals we need to support liberal groups over there. @seldo @fivethirtyeight
@seldo He backs the Brotherhood. And it's a speech, what do you want him to say? The truth? That he supports regimes that mistreat women?
@seldo I think this is a healthy debate. Just asking you to see my perspective and how I find your previous statement hypocritical.
@seldo Not a single Democrat speaks out against Christian persecution in the Middle East &amp; women's rights being trampled. "War on Women".
@seldo And President Obama supports these awful regimes. Millions of protesters in Egypt and he still backs the Muslim Brotherhood. #Weird

@140elect You're further proving my point: your guy supports terrorists in Egypt and Middle East and you refuse to acknowledge this mistake.
@140elect No, it's called taking out terrorists that are supporting terrorism in your own country. What they're doing is democratic.
@140elect Do you know what the Egyptian government has been doing this past year to roll back democracy? It's not democratic.
@140elect And that's what they're protesting against in Egypt. Radicals, that your guy is insisting on propping up, i.e. Syria, Egypt, etc.
@140elect I think that's why you made your original statement no? Not trying to pick a fight. Bottom line, your guy supports radicals.
