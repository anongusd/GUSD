Dunno guys, not sold on the monetary value or any value really. Any thoughts? I mean it's a fun tool, but what else?? Maybe I'm misdirected?
I guess I could could just @Twitter or @facebook my updates where I am since that's where @gowalla @foursquare post my whereabouts?
@foursquare @gowalla I get the geo thing but c'mon is it worth a 50mil investment?? It's cool for school kids maybe.
