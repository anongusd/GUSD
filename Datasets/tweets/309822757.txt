QUESTION: "As someone who was in these negotiations, do you think the president underestimated the speaker and do you think that he thought he could get what he wanted?"		SCHUMER: "I think he thought no one should ever underestimate the Speaker, as Donald Trump has learned."
SCHUMER: "Hopefully it means a lesson learned for the White House and for many of our Republican colleagues. Shutting down the government over a policy difference is self-defeating. It... incurs an enormous political cost to the party shutting it down."
SCHUMER: "The President has agreed to our request to open the government and then debate border security... Democrats in the Senate and in the House were united behind this position throughout the shutdown, and ultimately, this agreement endorses our position."

New Cohen document says "Client-1 and his public spokespersons were seeking to portray contact with Russian representatives in any form by Client-1... as having effectively terminated before the Iowa caucuses" and Cohen was "seeking to stay in line with this message."

Trump on Ruth Bader Ginsburg: "I wish her well. I hope she gets better. And I hope she serves on the Supreme Court for many, many years."
Trump on recounts: "You notice the votes never go the other way? They hire lawyers, and the votes don't ever seem to go the Republican way... Now in Arizona, all of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes, and the other candidate is just winning by a hair."
President Trump on concerns Whitaker isn't Senate-confirmed: "Mueller was not Senate-confirmed. Why didn't they get him Senate-confirmed? ... Don't tell me about Whitaker, because Mueller was not Senate-confirmed."
Trump on stripping press credentials: "It could be others, also. When you're in the White House, this is a very sacred place to be. This is a very special place. You have to treat the White House with respect. You have to treat the presidency with respect."
TRUMP: "There was no collusion. It's a whole hoax. This was a thing set up by the Democrats."		(It is not a whole hoax and it was not set up by the Democrats.)
Trump on FL recount: "All of a sudden, they're finding votes out of nowhere. And Rick Scott, who won by, you know, it was close, but he won by a comfortable margin, every couple of hours it goes down a little bit... I think that people have to look at it very, very cautiously."
TRUMP: "Well, Matt Whitaker -- I don't know Matt Whitaker. Matt Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions... I don't know Matt Whitaker. Matt Whitaker has a great reputation, and that's what I wanted."

Whitaker on @CNN, June 16, 2017:  "[Rosenstein] is one of the reasons that this investigation is kind of spinning out of control... The appointment of Bob Mueller in the first place... I don't think was necessarily appropriate under these circumstances as we know them."
Whitaker on firing Comey on @CNN, June 8, 2017: "There is no criminal case to be made on an obstruction of justice... Quite frankly, his story just doesn't rise to the level of the intent necessary, on behalf of the president, to even substantiate a criminal case."
Whitaker on Trump Tower meeting, July 10, 2017: "I continue to believe it's reckless to suggest that sort of the crime of the century has been committed here and it is slowly evolving in front of our eyes."
Whitaker on @CNN on Mueller probe, August 6, 2017: "My understanding of the scope is that it is limited... There is a very specific scope to this investigation and anything that is outside of Russian coordination or the 2016 campaign would be outside of the scope."

Trump on the new Democratic House: "Now what's bad for them is, being in the majority, I'm just gonna blame them. You understand. I'm gonna blame them. They're the majority. Honestly, it make it much simpler for me. They will be blamed."
TRUMP: "I think I am a great moral leader."

9:00pm is another important poll close. Most likely Dem flips include: AZ-02, CO-06, MN-02, MN-03, NM-02, NY-19 and NY-22. But MN-01 and MN-08 could flip back the other way. Senate races to watch: #NDSEN, #AZSEN and #TXSEN.
Hold onto your hats at the 8:00pm poll close. The most likely to flip: IL-06, IL-12, KS-02, ME-02, MI-08, MI-11, NJ-03, NJ-07, NJ-11, PA-01, PA-05, PA-06, PA-07, PA-17, TX-07, TX-32. The key Senate races: #FLSEN, #MOSEN and #TNSEN.
The 7:30pm poll close gives us just a couple more potential flips: NC-09 and OH-12 seem most likely, though NC-02, NC-13, OH-01, OH-14 and WV-03 are on the radar too. This also includes the #WVSEN race.
The next poll close at 7:00pm will tell us more. VA-02, VA-07 and VA-10 will be a really good early look at how the night will go. Other potential flips include: FL-6, FL-15, FL-18, FL-26, FL-27 plus Atlanta suburbs GA-06 and GA-07. #INSEN is a key potential GOP Senate flip.
The first exit polls will land at 5:00pm so we'll have some ideas about makeup of the electorate compared to previous years, etc. The first actual races close at 6:00pm: KY-6 will be the one to watch, with an eye on IN-9, but we won't read *too* much into these.
Here are the magic numbers to keep in mind tonight: 		Democrats need to flip 23 SEATS in order to win back the House. 		Democrats need to flip 2 SEATS in order to win back the Senate.

Here's the full story via @CNNPolitics: https://t.co/IRbmSMCTMU
Here's what the @CNN polling looked like in November 2014 on the Republican side --&gt;		Romney 20%	Carson 10%	Bush 9%	Christie 8%	Huckabee 7%	Paul 6%	Ryan 6%	Cruz 5%	Walker 5%	Perry 4%	Rubio 3%	Kasich 2%	Santorum 2%	Jindal 1%	Pence 1%	Portman &lt;1%		No Trump.
Here's what the @CNN polling looked like in November 2014 --&gt;		Clinton 65%	Warren 10%	Biden 9%	Sanders 5%	Cuomo 1%	Patrick 1%	Webb 1%	O'Malley &lt;1%
It's also worth noting at this point in 2014, Hillary Clinton had 65% support in the Democratic primary - double where Biden clocks in (33%) in new @CNN poll. It's clear Biden is the front-runner at this moment, but not to the extent Clinton was.
Younger voters are less in line behind Biden: Four in 10 (39%) potential Dem primary-ers over 45 years old support Biden vs. a quarter (26%) under 45 years old. Under 45 list continues: Sanders 21%, Harris 13%, Warren 11%.
Bernie Sanders -- like in 2016 -- performs way better with Democratic-leaning independents (21% support, trailing Biden by 10 points) than Democrats (9% support, trailing Biden by 25 points and falling to third)
A few interesting nuggets from the crosstabs of this new @CNN poll...
The first @CNN numbers for 2020 Democratic presidential nomination just released this morning:		Biden 33%	Sanders 13%	Harris 9%	Warren 8%	Booker 5%	Kerry 5%	Bloomberg 4%	O‚ÄôRourke 4%	Holder 3%	Garcetti 2%	Avenatti 1%	Gillibrand 1%	Klobuchar 1%	Patrick 1%	Bullock &lt;1%	Delaney &lt;1%

President Trump says he'll call King Salman "probably tonight or tomorrow." "I will be also calling King Salman of Saudi Arabia because I think it's appropriate for me to ask him what's going on."
Trump asked whether he's asked Turkish authorities for recording of Khashoggi murder: "We're going to be seeing it very soon." "We've all heard a lot about the audio. Nobody's seen it yet. So we do want to see it."
President Trump asked repeatedly how the United States could respond to Saudi Arabia's alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi: "Let's determine what happened first."
President Trump on ending the $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia: "All they are going to do is give it to other countries, and I think that would be very foolish for our country."
President Trump in the Oval Office on alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia: "As of this moment, nobody knows what happened."
President Trump on killing Saudi arms deal: "If they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or they're going to buy it from China... I actually think we'd be punishing ourselves."
President Trump says "it's a total coincidence" that Pastor Andrew Brunson was released from Turkey just days after Jamal Khashoggi was allegedly killed in the Saudi consulate there.
Trump on 60 Minutes on whether Khashoggi was killed by the Saudis: "Well, nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out. It's being investigated... as of this moment, they deny it and they deny it vehemently... They deny it every way you can imagine."

MURKOWSKI: "It is not something that we say we'll get to tomorrow. We've heard those voices and I hope that we have all learned something: that we owe it to the victims of sexual assault to do more and to do better and to do it now."
MURKOWSKI: "If there has been a silver lining in these bitter, bitter weeks... I do think what we have seen is a recognition by both sides that we must do more to protect and prevent sexual assault and help the victims of these assaults."
MURKOWSKI: "I believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a good man. He's a good man. He's clearly a learned judge. But in my conscience, because that's how I have to vote at the end of the day, I could not conclude that he is the right person for the court at this time."
MURKOWSKI: "There are only nine seats on the bench of the highest court in the land... Those who seek one of these seats must meet the highest standard in all respects at all times. And that is hard."
MURKOWSKI on Kavanaugh temperament: "After the hearing that we all watched last week, it became clear to me, or was becoming clearer, that that that appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable."
MURKOWSKI: "Even in the face of the worst thing that could happen, a sexual assault allegation... the standard is that a judge must act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary."

RT @ryanstruyk: I know there's a lot going on in the news, but the Secretary General of the United Nations @antonioguterres gave an remarka‚Ä¶
"There is no more time to waste... It is not too late to shift course, but every day that passes means the world heats up a little more and the cost of our inaction mounts... The world is counting on all of us to rise to the challenge before it‚Äôs too late."
"Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge."
"If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us."
"The high level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making rice crops less nutritious, threatening well-being and food security for billions... More people will be forced to migrate from their homes... This is already leading to many local conflicts over dwindling resources."
"The planet marked another grim milestone: the highest monthly average for carbon dioxide levels ever recorded... But we have now surpassed 411 parts per million and the concentrations continue to rise. This is the highest concentration in 3 million years."
"Every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants -- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth. Our fate is in our hands."
"There is another reason to act: moral duty. The world‚Äôs richest nations are the most responsible for the climate crisis, yet the effects are being felt first and worst by the poorest nations and the most vulnerable peoples and communities."
"We know what is happening to our planet. We know what we need to do. And we even know how to do it. But sadly, the ambition of our action is nowhere near where it needs to be."
"Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge... There is no more time to waste... We are careering towards the edge of the abyss."
"What makes all of this even more disturbing is that we were warned. Scientists have been telling us for decades. Over and over again. Far too many leaders have refused to listen. Far too few have acted with the vision the science demands. We see the results."
"I have asked you here to sound the alarm... We face a direct existential threat. Climate change is moving faster than we are... Let there be no doubt about the urgency of the crisis. We are experiencing record-breaking temperatures around the world."
I know there's a lot going on in the news, but the Secretary General of the United Nations @antonioguterres gave an remarkable, urgent speech on climate change on Monday. It's worth reading the highlights (thread) --&gt;
WARNER: "An executive order that inevitably leaves the President broad discretion to decide whether to impose tough sanctions against those who attack our democracy is insufficient... We need to spell out strong, clear consequences, without ambiguity."
McConnell: "On the Senate side, I'll  just list you a bunch of races that are dead even: Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and Florida. All of them too close to call."
Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello on Trump comments on Hurricane Maria: ‚ÄúThe historical relationship between Puerto Rico and Washington is unfair and unAmerican. It is certainly not a successful relationship. This was the worst natural disaster in our modern history."

Kavanaugh says the four "greatest moments in Supreme Court history" are: Marbury vs. Madison, Youngstown Steel, Brown vs. Board of Education and United States vs. Richard Nixon.
Kavanaugh on executive power: "After September 11, I thought very deeply about the presidency and I thought very deeply about the independent counsel experience and I thought very deeply about how those things interacted."
KAVANAUGH ON CASEY: "Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed Roe and did so by considering the stare decisis factors. So Casey now becomes a precedent on precedent... Casey is precedent on precedent, which itself is an important factor to remember."
KAVANAUGH ON ROE: "As a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade...  I said that it's settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principles stare decisis."
KAVANAUGH ON GUNS: "The violence in the schools is something we all detest... Guns, handguns, and semiautomatic rifles are weapons used for hunting and self defense... You rightly say they're used in a lot of violent crime... That's what makes this issue difficult."
Trump on Kavanaugh hearings so far: "I've watched his remarks. I've watched his performance. I've watched his statements. And honestly, they've been totally brilliant."
Trump on Woodward book: "The book means nothing... The book is a work of fiction. If you look back at Woodward's past, he had the same problem with other Presidents. He likes to get publicity. He sells some books."

OBAMA: "That's perhaps how we honor him best, by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party or ambition or money or fame or power, that there are some things that are worth risking everything for; principles that are eternal, truths that are abiding."
OBAMA: "While John and I disagreed on all kinds of foreign policy issues, we stood together on America's role as the one indispensable nation, believing that with great power and great blessings comes great responsibility."
OBAMA: "So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. Trafficking and bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's the politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear."
BUSH: "Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended.  Some voices are so vibrant and distinctive, it is hard to think of them stilled. A man who seldom rested is laid to rest. And his absence is tangible, like the silence after a mighty roar."
BUSH: "He respected the dignity inherent in every life - a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators. Perhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power.  He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots."
BUSH: "At various points throughout his long career, John confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this.  America is better than this."
Obama criticizes "a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but instead is borne in fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that."
Obama on Oval Office talks with McCain: "We enjoyed the time we shared away from the bright lights... We never doubted the other man's sincerity or the other man's patriotism or that, when all was said and done, we were on the same team."

George W. Bush on John McCain: "To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this. America is better than this."

TRUMP: "President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer. OK?"
COLLINS: "The President‚Äôs statements today in Helsinki demonstrate his continued refusal to accept the unanimous conclusions of U.S. intelligence leaders and the bipartisan findings of the Senate Intelligence Committee."
New statement from US intel chief Dan Coats: "We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence."
TRUMP: "Just to say it one time again -- and I say it all the time -- there was no collusion. I didn't know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign... But to the average reader out there, they're saying, 'Well, maybe that does.'"

MCCAIN: "Today‚Äôs press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. The damage inflicted by President Trump‚Äôs naivet√©, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate."
Trump in press conference with Putin: "The Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. We won the Electoral College by a lot: 306 to 223, I believe."
TRUMP: "That was a clean campaign... And it's a shame that there could even be a little bit of a cloud over it. People know that, people understand it. But the main thing -- and we discussed this also -- zero collusion."
RYAN: "The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally. There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia... There is no question that Russia interfered in our election."

Former CIA chief says Trump's comments were "nothing short of treasonous." https://t.co/RPRj2qnwWe
FWIW, Putin never actually said "no" he didn't have compromising information on Trump. He just said he didn't personally know Trump was in Moscow and it's "difficult to imagine an utter nonsense of a bigger scale" than collecting info on everyone at that conference.
Trump on whether Russia has damaging information on him: "If they had it, it would have been out long ago."
Putin, through a translator, says Trump "continued to maintain that it was illegal to annex" Crimea.
TRUMP: "All I can do is ask the question... Dan Coats came to me and some others. They said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this. I don't see any reason why it would be... I have confidence in both parties."
Trump says "I have confidence in both parties" when asked if he believes Vladimir Putin or the unanimous conclusion of US intelligence on election meddling.
QUESTION: "Would you now, with the whole world watching... denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again?"		TRUMP: "So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server..."
Trump says "our militaries do get along very well" at Putin press conference just 72 hours after Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for interfering in the 2016 election.
Putin on potential extradition for Mueller indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers: "President Trump mentioned this issue and I will look into it."
Putin, through a translator: "Could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense, just like the President recently mentioned."
TRUMP: "We ran a brilliant campaign and that's why I'm president."
TRUMP: "I beat Hillary Clinton easily... we won that race. And it's a shame that there can even be a little bit of a cloud over it."
QUESTION: "Do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular?"		TRUMP: "I hold both countries responsible. I think the United States has been foolish. I think we've all been foolish. We should have had this dialogue a long time ago... I think we're all to blame."
Trump corrects Russian journalist who says Trump called Putin an adversary: "Actually, I called him a competitor -- and a good competitor he is."
TRUMP: "President Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States."
TRUMP: "Our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed, as of about four hours ago. I really believe that."
TRUMP: "A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia. It is good for the world."
TRUMP: "We had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue. It went very well."
Putin, through a translator: "We're glad that the Korean Peninsula issue is starting to resolve. To a great extent, it was possible thanks to the personal engagement of President Trump who opted for dialogue instead of confrontation."
Putin, through a translator: "Negotiations with the President of the United States Donald Trump took place in a frank and business-like atmosphere. I think we can call it a success and a very fruitful round of negotiations."

Finland statement on Trump-Putin summit: "The wider talks will be followed by a joint press conference given by President Trump and President Putin in the Hall of State."
MCCAIN: "Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression.... If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.‚Äù
SCHIFF: ‚ÄúBecause it is abundantly clear that the President will not confront Putin on the charges laid out in this indictment and its predecessor... it is in the strong national security interests of the United States for the President to cancel any meeting with Putin.‚Äù
PELOSI: "‚ÄúThe stakes for the upcoming Trump-Putin meeting could not be higher... Failure to stand up to Putin would constitute a profound betrayal of the Constitution and our democracy."
WARNER: "There should be no one-on-one meeting between this President and Mr. Putin. There need to be other Americans in the room."
ROSENSTEIN: "There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime. There is no allegation that the conspiracy altered the vote count or changed any election result."
ROSENSTEIN: "The conspirators corresponded with several Americans through the internet. There is no allegation in the indictment that the Americans knew they were communicating with Russian intelligence officers."
SCHUMER: "President Trump should cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin.... Glad-handing with Vladimir Putin on the heels of these indictments would be an insult to our democracy."
Trump: "I call it the rigged witch hunt. I think that really hurts our country, and it really hurts our relationship with Russia."		Rosenstein, 3 hours later: "The indictment charges 12 Russian military officers... for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 presidential election."
INDICTMENT: "The Conspirators also hacked into the computer networks of the DCCC and the DNC... the Conspirators staged and released tens of thousands of the stolen emails and documents."
ROSENSTEIN: "I briefed President Trump about these allegations earlier this week. The President is fully aware of the Department's actions today."
ROSENSTEIN: "The indictment charges 12 Russian military officers... for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 presidential election."
Trump sets low expectations for his summit with Putin:		- "I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much‚Äù	- "It's not going to be big schedule"	- "I'm not going in with high expectations"	- "It's just a loose meeting"
Trump on Putin summit: "I'm not going in with high expectations but we may come out with some very surprising things."
TRUMP: "I guarantee whoever it is in Russia, they're saying, "Oh gee do we wish that Trump was not the victor in that election. We have been far tougher on Russia than anybody. Anybody."
Trump on Putin meddling: "I know you'll ask, will we be talking about meddling. And I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.'"

MCCAIN: "Putin is not America‚Äôs friend, nor merely a competitor. Putin is America‚Äôs enemy... It is up to President Trump to hold Putin accountable for his actions... Failure to do so would be a serious indictment of his stewardship of American leadership in the world.‚Äù
MCCAIN: "There is little use in parsing the president‚Äôs misstatements and bluster, except to say that they are the words of one man. Americans, and their Congress, still believe in the transatlantic alliance and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
Trump on Putin summit: "It's just a loose meeting. It's not going to be big schedule. I don't think it should take a very long period of time. And we'll where it leads. But it could lead to something very productive, and maybe it's not."
Trump doesn't rule out recognizing Crimea as part of Russia: "That's an interesting question because, you know, long before I got here, President Obama allowed that to happen... What will happen with Crimea from this point on? That I can't tell you..."
Trump on Putin denial of meddling: "Well, he may. I mean, look, he may. You know, what am I going to do if -- he may deny it. I mean, it's one of those things. So all I can do is say, 'Did you?' and 'Don't do it again.' But he may deny. I mean, you'll be the first to know, OK?"
Trump on Putin meeting: "I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much. We want to find out about Syria. And we will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling. I will be asking that question again."

Worth noting Amash called Kavanaugh a "disappointing pick" and "not even close" to another Gorsuch. Rand Paul says "open mind" but wonder if Paul's vote is more in jeopardy than Collins/Murkowski. https://t.co/tLCcFAQWt1
Here's a fun fact: Kavanaugh called for considering a single six-year term for Presidents to "alleviate the pressure to think about re-election and the need to run something of a permanent campaign." https://t.co/vecLkkKjn0
Here's the 2006 vote on Kavanaugh to be a DC Circuit judge. Collins and Murkowski both yes. https://t.co/rjjyJNunOF
Obama, Biden, Feinstein, Nelson, Carper all voted yes on cloture for Kavanaugh in 2006 vote for DC Circuit.
Kavanaugh in 2006 hearing: "If confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, I would follow Roe v. Wade faithfully and fully. That would be binding precedent of the Court. It's been decided by the Supreme Court."
COLLINS: "Judge Kavanaugh has impressive credentials and extensive experience...  I will conduct a careful, thorough vetting of the President‚Äôs nominee to the Supreme Court, as I have done with the five previous Supreme Court Justices whom I have considered."
Kavanaugh in 2012 law review article: "The impeachment process is available...  In short, the Constitution establishes a clear mechanism to deter executive malfeasance; we should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions."
Kavanaugh in 2012 law review article: "Criminal investigations take the President‚Äôs focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President."
Kavanaugh in 2012 law review article: "Congress might consider a law exempting a President‚Äîwhile in office‚Äîfrom criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel."
SCOTUS justices nominated, by days before election (last 100 years):		Sutherland (Harding) - 63 days	Goldberg (Kennedy) - 67 days	Souter (HW Bush) - 104 days	** Kavanaugh (Trump) - 120 days **	Scalia (Reagan) - 133 days	Rehnquist (Reagan) - 137 days	...	Garland (Obama) - 237 days
KAVANAUGH: "Mr. President, I am grateful to you and I am humbled by your confidence in me."
Trump says "there is no one in America more qualified for this position" than Kavanaugh.
TRUMP: "I do not ask about a nominee's personal opinions. What matters is not a nominee's personal views, but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and Constitution require."
TRUMP: "Tonight is my honor and privilege to announce that I will nominate Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court."

Sotomayor says SCOTUS "merely replaces one 'gravely wrong' decision with another" by overruling Japanese internment camp case but deciding for Trump on travel ban case.
Sotomayor: "This new window dressing cannot conceal an unassailable fact: the words of the President and his advisers create the strong perception that the Proclamation is contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam and its followers."
Sotomayor references Colorado baker case in travel ban dissent: "Notably, the Court recently found less pervasive official expressions of hostility and the failure to disavow them to be constitutionally significant."
Sotomayor: "Based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus... The majority holds otherwise by ignoring the facts..."
Breyer: "I would, on balance, find the evidence of antireligious bias, including statements on a website taken down only after the President issued the two executive orders preceding the Proclamation...  a sufficient basis to set the Proclamation aside... I respectfully dissent."
Thomas not happy that district court judges could halt travel ban unilaterally: "In sum, universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious. If federal courts continue to issue them, this Court is dutybound to adjudicate their authority to do so."
SCOTUS: "Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and ‚Äî to be clear ‚Äî ‚Äúhas no place in law under the Constitution.‚Äù
Kennedy concurring: "There are numerous instances in which the	statements and actions of Government officials are not	subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention. That does not	mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution	and the rights it proclaims and protects."
SCOTUS on travel ban: "Under these circumstances, the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review. We express no view on the soundness of the policy."
SCOTUS majority bashes Sotomayor dissent for bringing up Japanese internment camp case: "Whatever rhetorical advantage the dissent may see in doing so, Korematsu has nothing to do with this case."
SCOTUS: "The Proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices. The text says nothing about religion."
SCOTUS: "Because there is persuasive evidence that the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility, we must accept that independent justification."
SCOTUS: "Plaintiffs allege that the primary purpose of the Proclamation was religious animus...  The issue, however, is not whether to denounce the President‚Äôs statements, but the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face..."
SCOTUS on ban: "It is expressly premised on legitimate	purposes and says nothing about religion. The entry restrictions on	Muslim-majority nations are limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national	security risks."

Here's where you can read the United Nations report on human rights violations in North Korea, both a 36-page summary and 372-page full report. https://t.co/Jgkzzz3GoM (fixes link)
@SamWangPhD try this one - https://t.co/Jgkzzz3GoM
"These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution... the forcible transfer [and] the enforced disappearance of persons and... knowingly causing prolonged starvation."
"The police... systematically employ violence and punishments that amount to gross human rights violations in order to create a climate of fear that pre-empts any challenge to the current system of government... The institutions and officials involved are not held accountable."
"The commission finds that decisions, actions and omissions by the State and its leadership caused the death of at least hundreds of thousands of people and inflicted permanent physical and psychological injuries on those who survived."
"During the period of famine, ideological indoctrination was used in order to	maintain the regime, at the cost of seriously aggravating hunger and starvation... It also delayed international assistance that, provided earlier, could have saved many lives."
"There is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association... The State operates an all-encompassing indoctrination machine that takes root from childhood."
"Hundreds of thousands of inmates have been exterminated in political prison camps and other places over a span of more than five decades... This raises the question of whether genocide or an international crime akin to it has been committed."
"The imposition of forced abortions on female inmates who become pregnant without authorization not only results in immediate physically harm, it also interferes with the victim‚Äôs reproductive rights and causes severe emotional suffering."
"Rape is regularly committed in the political prison camps of the DPRK. They are a product of the environment of the prison camps and the impunity generally enjoyed by camp officials... In other cases, women are pressed into 'consensual' sexual relations."
"The intentional killings... through summary executions, beatings, infanticide, deliberate starvation and other illegal means, all amount to the crime of murder... The prisoners are often so weakened from malnourishment and disease that they are literally worked to death."
"The death toll is further exacerbated by executions, deaths from torture, the	denial of adequate medical care, high incidence of work accidents, lack of shelter and lack of appropriate clothes... the camps have the objective of	gradually eliminating the camp population."
"The living conditions in the political prison camps are calculated to bring about mass deaths. Forced to carry out grueling labour, inmates are provided food rations that are so insufficient that many inmates starve to death."
"Inmates are imprisoned, usually for life, in camps without ever having been brought before a judge... They have never been charged, convicted or sentenced... [Many] are incarcerated based solely on the principle of guilt by family association. Some are even born prisoners."
If you've never read the United Nations report from 2014 about the egregious human rights violations and crimes against humanity in North Korea, you need to read it. I'm threading some key quotes below:

TRUMP: "I feel really great. I feel really great. We're going to have a great discussion and I think tremendous success. We'll be tremendously successful. And it's my honor and we will have a terrific relationship."
Trump says "it's my honor" as he sits next to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.
