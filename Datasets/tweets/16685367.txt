@Ghost1776 regarding Rush,  I never listened to him.  He is not for real freedom...  just war spending.
@Ghost1776 I agree!  Especially those who say they are for individual rights... but only watch out for their own interest.
@RasmussenPoll Why not call people like me?  Who are you calling for these polls?
@Ghost1776 Exactly!  Their hasn't been a moderate let alone a conservative or libertarian from Chicago... that I know of
@Ghost1776 that explains your "left" leanings. I can understand your defense of Chicago, since its your hometown, I defend Michigan too.
@Ghost1776 WRONG!  Look it up for yourself.  The list of the Safest /most dangerous cities sites this as reason for ALWAYS excluding Chicago
@Ghost1776 gun sales have risen, ALL crime outside of Chicago have gone down... Chicago cannot be counted by FBI they hack the results. FACT
@Ghost1776 Cuidad Juarez, MX has very strict gun laws, yet very dangerous, El Paso has very lax gun laws, very safe. Neighboring cities.
@Ghost1776  More guns (less gun laws) mean less crime: Vermont has virtually no state gun laws, yet very little crime.
@Ghost1776 The problem has existed ever since the strict gun laws have been in place, how convenient. I have family in the Chicago area
@Ghost1776 ...and if Chicago's gun laws worked wouldn't they want to be accurate in reporting crimes?
@Ghost1776 Let's see, Chicago doesn't meet FBI standards in violent crime reporting, and yet they have the strictest gun laws in the country
