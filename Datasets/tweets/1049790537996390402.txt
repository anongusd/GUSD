@RandPaul I know you are planning on leaving but you still should support what your constituents want.  Trump was voted in campaigning on the wall; that is what they want. I am sick of the Rhino's fighting Trump on things that they would support if it was anyone else. Build Wall!

@Cindybin20022 God bless you in your walk with Jesus.
@Cindybin20022 The Bible is the inspired word of God, complete &amp; finished, no other book is necessary. The Book of Mormon has too many contradictions to the Bible. Christians put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. Jesus is the perfect sacrifice for sins; said "It is finished" on the cross.
@aanalyst50 Trump is the first president to lose money in office. Kamilla Harris, Maxine Waters, and Pelosi have made millions.  Watch the girl who could not afford rent, AOC have millions; next year.  She does not know how to budget and looks to everyone else to know what to say, but watch.
@JorgeD46471811 The courts took the decision away from men.  Men don't have the say anymore, just like a teenager does not need parent approval for an abortion.  This aggression is on the women and the abortion doctors.  Women wanted equal rights and this major crime of murder is theirs to bear.
