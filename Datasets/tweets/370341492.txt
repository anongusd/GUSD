@MsCharlotteWWE you deserve your own title shot. Becky, as you know, deserves her own as well. At the same time, @wwe needs a heel in there to mix things up against a (too far over "heel") and who's supposed to be the face. We would basically have face vs face match without you.

Or is he just a filler until they resolve all other issues and let him play out his rookie contract to see if he is in fact the QB of their future.
Comparing him to Sean McVay, who is an elite coach and offensive mind? Your comparison between the two is very accurate. This team can't get much worse. Wilks deserved a second shot, but you can't tell me bringing in someone who thinks the same way McVay does is a bad choice. https://t.co/yzm7eejePe
@EricLPark @DeBronc03 @RapSheet @TomPelissero I agree, he's young, but he's their franchise guy. I am only interested in seeing who he favors. I would never imagine that he has any sort of say-so. I think he realizes that as well.
The @AZCardinals are hiring @RyanGosling as their HC. Wait, is that.. is that @KliffKingsbury!? Good things happening in Glendale!
@YahooFantasy DJ will eclipse 1,500 all-purpose yards next season. Completely revamping the OL is a start... Building a bond with his locker room is much more important, these guys all looked disconnected this season. Kingsbury will need to bring them all together and the offense will produce
@RapSheet @TomPelissero I'd be interested to hear who Baker is favoring here. I know that's only a minimal piece of the puzzle when it comes to this hiring, so early in his career, but still something to pay attention to. We don't want to see Rogers/McCarthy over again.

@rich_medina01 @MyFantasyLeague @FantasyFB_Addic @FFBeard @Fantasykillers @topshelfguys @FantasyBrosFF trade D. Adams for D. Adams and see if it's accepted.
@FantasySits 2-8. I can't see what moves have been made from the beginning of the season, but besides Mahomes there is plenty of inconsistency down the roster. There were even a couple weeks where you saw very underwhelming performances out of Thomas.
Don't let anyone tell you, "you aren't doing enough". As long as you're putting in the work to be better, you're doing enough. After 4 years, I still can't seem to catch back up and that's because I allowed someone to overwork and underpay me until I sank.
@KingJames is shooting &lt;50% from the line. He's still the best in the world. He got their by focusing on his weak points. Sometimes the workload is still too much. I was fired for "under-performing". I was actually at home, working 80+ hours w/ a newborn baby just to stay afloat.

Not a division matchup. My mistake. Nonetheless. Made the moves this week. Bought Allen on a bye during what should be an easy win this week even without Odell.
Odell, Clement and Mike Will for James White, Keenan Allen and Royce Freeman. Dropped AZ and picked up SF. Tough division matchup next week. Needed a WR in place of Odell and a defense with top ten potential next week. @TheFFBallers @nfldata @BeerFueledFF #fantasyfootball #trade
@CMZ318 @MyFantasyLeague plus, Rodgers has 5 targets now, who knows how productive Allison will be with Cobb healthy and MVS being in the mix moving forward. There's a lot going on in that offense, Juju is just matching up perfectly opposite Brown every week.
@CMZ318 @MyFantasyLeague depends on your situation. I love Juju going forward. if you are good to go in the RB slot, i would do this in a heartbeat.
@HoustonTexans @jharrisfootball @TexansVoice @RTICCoolers #texans @jharrisfootball @TexansVoice how do you think this offense performs against the upcoming slate without Fuller in there? Will the offense continue to thrive without the extra threat downfield?
@CMZ318 @MyFantasyLeague Murray is a solid bet. He has averaged nearly 15 points in .5 PPR format. He‚Äôs averaging 5.1 Y/A as a starter. Obviously inflated by the Cardinals game but nonetheless impressive numbers for a team that struggles to run the ball.
If you don't believe that @DeAndreHopkins isn't the most underpaid player in the league, you can go ahead and fight me on it. This man balls out every week, day in, day out and provides that team with the most explosive weapon they've ever seen. #thatwasacatch #apologize

@nfldata @TheFFBallers @athielen19 @cheetah That‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôd have no real replacement for Juju. Agholor if nobody else had hands to catch a ball in Philly.
@TheFFBallers @nfldata thoughts? .5 PPR. Juju and David Johnson for Zeke.  already sitting very..VERY pretty with @athielen19 and @cheetah. RBs would then be Mixon, Zeke, Clement and Lamar Miller. I'm just digging my WR Trio with Juju in there.
@BlackHoleFans who's gonna be in Phoenix with me!?

@FFHitman @andyholloway @TheFFBallers Michael Thomas seems to be a lock #1 for the season. How do you target him? What are you risking in order to have him on your team? The person with Thomas needs a RB. Do you risk Schuster and maybe Johnson? ask for Thomas and a RB? Thoughts?

I wasn't out reaching for a RB on a team without a 100 yard rusher in the 5 years. and Mike Williams wasn't on my target list.

I walked away with my dreams being crushed. I had cash in my wallet, cash which came from hard work and selling the things I've worked hard for. I know it wasn't enough to walk out with a new MacBook, but it was enough to be close. Just need it to get my family back on its feet.
Went to an @apple store last week. The employees all stared at me as I stood next to my dream #MacBookPro. 15 minutes later, an employee offered help and all she did was ignore my question about layaway and point me towards your Barclay card. I was turned down, embarrassed,
I believe in taking care of my family first. That's why I've sacrificed everything. 40 hrs./wk. and sold all of my belongings to start a side hustle. Turns out, what I sold is gone forever and it paid some bills.. @Nike @Kaepernick7 #BelieveInSomething #Sacrifice #sidehustle

@TheOriginalWes @Browns Put some players on defense and stop playing from behind. I imagine not a lot of these top QBs coming out in the draft are too used to playing their way out from a large deficit. The @Browns need a complete rebuild just like the @Giants. The @49ers are getting there.
@TheOriginalWes @Browns I agree. But hey, it‚Äôd be a start. Might just be better not to even draft and let these players have a future.
I think it‚Äôs time the @Browns pick up a free agent veteran to make play calls and draft a couple or a few young playmakers both offense and defense.

Finally able to sit down and enjoy some @NBA. I‚Äôll tell you what.. it‚Äôs a joy to see the young guns on the @Suns out there trying to keep this a game against the @Pacers. @DevinBook was snubbed on his all-star roster spot. Can never sleep on that guy. The numbers show it.

@RSherman_25 not to disagree with you at all. I have to ask.. don‚Äôt you think that will eliminate the deep ball pass? DBs will commit DPI on every deep ball so it backs it up to only a 15 yard gain instead of 20+ https://t.co/0iljrLADWT
It‚Äôs game day!! Who y‚Äôall got in the #NFCChampionship and #AFCChampionship. I‚Äôve got @Jaguars by a TD+1 and a late pick to seal it. @Vikings pull ahead early and hold on by 6 with a 4th down stop near the goal line. @Eagles and @Patriots both lose at home.

Anyone wanna tell me why we don‚Äôt see a challenge during @NBAAllStar weekend? Give them a 3 point contest of their own! @NBA we all know there‚Äôs centers who can shoot.
@RippinDank @Vikings @Patriots @NFL Aye! I agree. I‚Äôve been calling this all from the beginning. Not to say that these two teams don‚Äôt deserve it. All 4 teams deserve to be where they are.. but it is slightly obvious. You start hearing all these players and coaches talking about the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù of things nowadays.
Now that there‚Äôs rumors about the Super Bowl being rigged.. if the @Vikings and the @Patriots do go, it‚Äôs gonna go down as a rigged Super Bowl. That‚Äôs not fair. If those two teams DONT go, everyone will think they changed the plan to cover it up. The @NFL has got itself in a bind
I may be a fan of the @SanJoseSharks but let me tell you.. the @GoldenKnights have the best Twitter in the game right now. #onpoint #Millennials

@SuperBowl conspiracy. Brady prepares to retire, tells Belicheck. ‚ÄúInjures hand?‚Äù just before AFC Championship and it just so happens.. the @Patriots trade @JimmyG_10 for a second round pick to an NFC team. Preparing for the end of a legacy. Second round pick QB in the 2018 draft
What?? That the @SanJoseSharks were gonna steal another from ya? https://t.co/hCpOjVjVYJ
I think it‚Äôs time to recognize the @NFL and their players/teams that are donating to each other‚Äôs charities. A show of unity as well as a show of respect. Maybe the people in the world should start to follow in the footsteps of these gestures and realize we are still all one.
