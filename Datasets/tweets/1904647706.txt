@RepJoeKennedy U all R unbelievable.  All concerned parties need 2 B in a room NEGOTIATING/ finding RESOLUTION instead of conducting social media &amp;TV performances that R stubborn, inflexible &amp; represent only those who share the same opinion.
@SpeakerPelosi U all R unbelievable.  All concerned parties need 2 B in a room NEGOTIATING/ finding RESOLUTION instead of conducting social media &amp;TV performances that R stubborn, inflexible &amp; represent only those who share the same opinion.
@RepJeffries You need to stop pointing fingers at each other....remember why U were elected....put yourselves and any others who need 2 B involved in a room and not leave until U negotiate, compromise and find resolution 2 this horrific stalemate.  FORGET PERSONAL AGENDAS &amp; BE LEADERS!!
@RepCummings BOTH SIDES NEED TO PUT ASIDE THEIR PERSONAL AGENDAS....GET IN A ROOM AND NOT COME OUT UNTIL COMPROMISES/NEGOTIATIONS ARE ACHIEVED AND RESOLUTIONS ACHIEVED.   ENOUGH OF THE POLITICAL FINGER POINTING &amp; DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR FROM ALL OF YOU

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Also Congress needs to do what Corporate America does when they have priorities that aren’t met....goals that need to be attained....serious issues that are compromising the business....they DO WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE JOB DONE.  WORK WEEKENDS, LATE NIGHTS, PULL EXTRA SHIFTS.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What happened to you feeling strongly in the past that we needed to secure the border?  	All of you (Congress) need to give up YOUR paychecks....instead of just “mouthing” how terrible this is &amp; join the people you are concerned about. WALK YOUR TALK!!!!
@PghSuptHamlet @PghSchiller Congratulations!  Keep the good PPS news coming.
@tdutko11 Where in Fla?
@ktko101 👍.  Sounds delicious.
@MarkWarner Agree  but until it’s ended all in Congress should immediately  volunteer to have their salaries withheld.....and no time off until they come to resolution
@CharlieBatch16 You’re a great guy who choses well how to spend your time and energy. Stay on the high road where you are really respected and loved.
@cher I can’t help but wonder how many people who are saying they don’t want a border wall have high fences/walls and/or security systems installed in their homes.  They want to manage who enters their homes! Seems pretty sensible!
@cher The entire issue is about securing our borders so that ILLEGAL immigrants do not	enter.  We have a process (as does every country) to enter 	into the US legally.
@cher There R videos of past presidents stating we need 2 secure R borders.  This about Trump. I don’t support federal workers not being paid. I think both sides have to negotiate a compromise that ultimately results in improving R immigration procedures/policy AND secures R borders.

@Dat_Dude_Nix  Roosevelt, please keep the guys focused, post and “BELIEVING”.   Don’t let yourselves..or anyone else..take the team down the tubes.  There’s a lot of talent on the team...now challenge each other to play Steelers football.  You all CAN do it!!!!
@KDPomp Can someone please try to have Art Rooney, Jr see that we NEED coaching changes NOW!
@JoshYohe_PGH Amazing!
@JamesConner_ Praying for your full and speedy recovery.  🙏
@tdutko11 Make it a date with a date to go 😊❤️
@AB84 That’s the right attitude!  Please lead the younger guys to put passion into their formula to play their best!  Fire them up!  Thank you for all that you give to every game you play.  Outsmart every opponent whose purpose is to stop you.  You’re faster &amp; smarter.  🔥
@ktko101 @DanAndShay So glad you went &amp; enjoyed
@ThePoniExpress 👍
@qaman13 @ThePoniExpress 👍

@JKCorden Wow 😭
@ktko101 Loved it
@latelateshow Loved it 🎶
@GabbyBarrett_ ⭐️🌈⭐️
@CadeFoehner You two looked great.  I’m sure it wss quite an experience!
@PittsburghPG Not good.  Was hoping to see Stephon step up not out
@ThePoniExpress 👍
@KDPomp Agree
@LeVeonBell Creative now?
@penguins .....and they WILL...
@SteelersG702 @MarcusGilbert88 now now
@shamarko21ya You have a wonderful positive strong attitude.  Never let anyone or anything take that from up!   It’s your signature stamp, Shamarko!
@YandR_CBS Nick &amp; Phyllis - a glass door right there....come on, writers!!!		Finding a watch in a park does NOT make it a crime scene.....	Come on writers!!!
@PensInsideScoop Snen,  Sid.  Looked like you guys lacked energy....and chemistry.  That’s fixable.  On to Monday’s game.  Get your guys fired up!!!	❤️
@JFowlerESPN @SteelerChickPGH Let him dress and let him sit on the bench.  His actions tell the story about how he feels about his teammates, the fans, the organization.
@DaveDiCello Absolutely gorgeous!
@ktko101 Certainly hope not. You need to find a specialist who determines what’s wrong and defines a treatment plan that you must follow so you get better once and for all. ❤️
@ktko101 ????
@ktko101 Love this guy 😍
@ktko101 You can change to 😊😁😂😍
@RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump Please STOP investing so much time &amp; energy in fake news/media.....enough already...if people don’t get it by now they never will.
@DaveDiCello GORGEOUS
@DaveDiCello There are a lot if us eho can’t wait to sed the pictures.
@nikkihaley Totally agree
@ImmunePharma Di you have any successful findings for  1) CRPS 2) Sjorgren’s  3)Fibromyalgia 	I need help!
@ktko101 Agree totally
@DaveDiCello Politics has no place.....this was a massacre olain &amp; simple as a result of deep hatred.
@shamarko21ya ❤️...from a Steeler die-hard fan
@shamarko21ya 👍
@penguins Nothing but love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
@BonnieDutko @carrieunderwood Wish i had done it 😪
@Epj7Now Everyone stop bullying!!!
@CelinaPompeani @SalArmyPGH Well you sure look beautiful in it.
@amyschumer  Sorry, Amy, a football field is not the forum to take a stand regarding racial injustice.  I believe everyone has the right to have their voice heard, but there’s appropriate time and place to do so.
@carrieunderwood How precious.   Write things like this in a book so one day when the kids are older you can read it.  You will laugh, cry and have time to appreciate more the beauty and/or magic of your young children.  Enjoy every minute you can now as it goes way too quickly.
@Michael_Mealor You’re a great actor.  Love the energy  you bring to the show. 	LOVE the chemistry between you &amp; Summer.   Convince fhe writers you belong with her 👍

@YandR_CBS @eileen_davidson @MyJasonThompson @MelissaOrdway @ginatognoni @ameliamheinle @BethMaitlandDQB @Michael_Mealor @JessWaltonYR Why is she leaving?
@thehill It’s s sad and pathetic day when “adults” think this is appropriate behavior any time!!! I feel sorry abd concerned for our next generation that have these type of role models.
@YandR_CBS Kyle &amp; Summer
@YandR_CBS 	Kyle and Summer only
What in God’s name has happened to our country????  	Hate ... closed minds ... not talking through differences and spewing ugliness towards each other is decaying our society.
@HealingMB Really believe this!  Pick carefully
@Michael_Mealor You
@shamarko21ya You are so right ... it is the best ... and can be toughest job in this world.   Just think...you and their mother created your children...as babies you have the cherished privilege of taking care of them...then develop them as children/young adults.   	Loved it.  Miss it.
@YandR_CBS @Michael_Mealor @SashaCalle Summer
@YandR_CBS @Michael_Mealor @SashaCalle No......unbelievable chemistry between him &amp; Sunmer.  Need to get back together 🙏

@GabbyBarrett_ ⭐️🌈⭐️🖤
@cassiebettis @ktko101 You do......and you CAN. make it happen. ❤️
@ktko101 O God me never
@KDPomp I wonder the same.  They’ve actually created more problems than they’ve handled.   Unacceptable behavior,  problems , chronic negativity and poor attitudes needs to be MANAGED QUICKLY EFFECTIVELY and CONSISTENTLY.
@ktko101 Agree. So happy she won!
@JoeyThornhill @CamHeyward Can’t do that to #7!!!!
@ktko101 So cute...so sweet....seems so sincere........but seems so stiff. 	He needs to know how to be romantic.
@ktko101 So true....can’t fix someone else.
@AB84 👍
@realDonaldTrump How can he be going representing our country as an authorized representative of our country when he is NOT?
@PensJG 😢😭😂
@PensJG Thank you!
@mrsmoats52 So sad.  Another situation where a young man, someone with great talent, is gone because DRUGS WIN AGAIN.   The message R children/young adults need 2 hear is why/how he died &amp; that no amount of money can prevent drug addiction &amp; an overdose. What’s broken inside has 2 B fixed!
@YandR_CBS I think Victor
@WTAE We work at round the situation and move on
@ktko101 OMG 😭
@ktko101 Kristie, your heart and spirit belongs volunteering in a children’s hospital or a NIC unit holding little ones.  ❤️
@Pirates Let’s go Bucs! 🖤💛
@elizabethforma Women’s reproduction is a PERSONAL matter not a government matter.
@Steelers_FAN Agree.  They shouldn’t be.   His behavior/actions doesn’t spell TEAMWORK...COMMITMENT..RELIABLE...DEPENDABLE to me either.
@gerrydulac If he was worried about wear &amp; tear on his body then he could have chosen another career.  He has demonstrated a selfish &amp; arrogant position in a career that REQUIRES teamwork. He can take care of himself &amp; his body SITTING on the bench watching the guys who put teamwork first.
@mrsmoats52 Some guys would give anything....and some have given their all...to play!  Find it unacceptable to not be reliable, committed and dependable for your teammates.
@PensJG BTW, they can take the girl out of Pittsburgh, but will NEVER take the Pittsburgh out of this girl.   Love it!
@PensJG U have no idea what U’re response means.  2 think U remember is very touching &amp; uplifting.  Josh, we follow U’re tweets &amp; my hubby got the NHL channel hoping 2 B able 2 C some games on TV.   I am DETERMINED 2 get well...maybe we’ll get 2 C U  in Tampa @ a Pens/Bolts game.  🐧🖤💛
@JoshYohe_PGH Yes.... we’ll take them wanting to “prove something” ... 	LET’S  GO PENS!!! 🖤💛
@KDKA Until he develops some team spirit and a work ethic that does not let his ego get in the way SIT him on the bench.
@Chickillo56 So ready.....
@EdBouchette 👍👍👍👍👍👍
@TheNextPGH @astockeyWTAE @Pirates @CityPGH @danielgilman @billpeduto Good decision!
@PensJG I’m sure you won’t remember us but my husband and I were always at the Lemieux Center watching  the Pens practice.   Due to my health we moved to Venice Fl.  We really miss going there &amp;  to the games 😭	Let’s Go Pens!!!🖤💛
@DanielGoddard @MyJasonThompson Please come to Venice FL so that I can hang with the two of you.  🙏
How pathetic that we have grown adults who think that “heckling” is acceptable and appropriate form of demonstration.  PATHETIC!!! https://t.co/g5XVO0iIpl
@Epj7Now @LindseyGrahamSC Ditto
@ThePoniExpress No....let him have to sit  on the bench while he’s under contract with the Steelers!!!
@CamHeyward I know I’m “a bit older “  but in my day we sweated it out
@sorlando73 As long as he can’t play for anyone else let him sit out!!!!
@CNN 😢
@ktko101 😢❤️😢❤️😢❤️😢❤️
@MarkKaboly When a player doesn’t have more regard for his team and fans it’s just not worth trying to hold on to someone who doesn’t seem to care at all.  He’s behavior to date doesn’t reflect a player ready to commit to his teammates and start the season prepared.  Not good &amp; acceptable.
@GabbyBarrett_ 🙏⭐️🌈🙏⭐️

@Liz_Wheeler Thank you!!!!
@3williethadude9 Just can’t keep a good man down.  👍
@JudicialWatch Why did they wait so long #?
@TeamPelosi @BarackObama Guess what, Nancy....his legacy should speak for itself!! How about putting bipartisan energy, priorities into our country’s current needs and focus on what’s best for our countries people???????  Actually seems there’s more than enough need to start in your own state!
@PPSnews Who (position titles) makes up the school leadership teams?
@mrsmoats52 @dabody52 You have every reason to be proud of him.....he’s not a quitter....he loves you and his children and isn’t afraid to let the world know it....he’s a good man.  He’s also blessed to have a woman who loves and supports him as you do.  I’d say, you’re a great team!
@michaelmuhney Funny!
@BernieSanders How about first starting with “grown adult paid politicians” acting like adults who are focused on the “people” of this country and not party affiliation, spreading negativity, anger and malice.
@michaelmuhney Great news!  We’ll keep the prayers coming!
@DocMcCoyAtDice @PPSnews @PghSuptHamlet Plez work 2 gether 2 *provide the very best comprehensive education possible 2 the students *evolve in2 a nat’l example of how 2 turn student &amp; educator performance 2 higher levels *define/implement best practices that other US schools want 2 emulate.

@dabody52 @mrsmoats52 You two are blessed with each other ... and your children are blessed with you.  ❤️
@michaelmuhney You played your role In a way that made it easy for us to embrace you both as Adam and Michael.
@TeamPelosi You know what you are....a huge trouble maker....one who stirs it deep in order to direct attention to the “other” side...doesn’t appear that you care one thing about what it’s doing to those you, and all govt officials, are supposed to be serving.  BTW, I’m an an Independent
@VernonShazier I admire how strong your faith is.  Has it always been that way?
@realDonaldTrump plez quit attacking-take high road-deal with facts-let results &amp; facts define what U’re doing or not doing.  R govt “adults” need 2 start acting like adults-quit the finger-pointing- B accountable 4 themselves-opponents taking 2 much time, resources &amp; attention
@emalkin71geno You couldn’t get a better gift.  Happy Birthday!  Wishing you a special day and a fantastic year. 	🎂🎉
@TeamPelosi U continue 2 run U’re mouth spread hate &amp; divide R country instead of trying 2 UNIFY it.  The priority is R country &amp; R people.  In due time the govt players will change &amp; R country will B better or worse because of how U all perform now.  Do U believe U’re any better than him?
@YandR_CBS 😢😭
@RamonFoster 👍.  Wishing you a full and quick recovery.   🙏

@michaelmuhney Welcome back.....hope your family trip was very relaxing and  memorable.
@JacksonLeeTX18 Just Y don’t U use U’re experience, networking, resources and whatever else 	it’ll take 4 nonpartisan involvement in finding SOLUTIONS 2 the situation. Instead U bring attention 2 yourself by ranting &amp; raving about Trump...seems like a tremendous misuse of adults  time &amp; energy.
@FoxNews @dallascowboys @dak @NFL Totally agree!
@PPSnews @Drake @TheEllenShow I really liked how the student body was welcomed...I think it was last school year.
@steelers What a joy it is to have him on our team.  Love him
@kathygriffin Refreshing 😊
@d_nic5 @r0bbo_ @AB84 @DezBryant trial not trail
@ktko101 😊
@d_nic5 @r0bbo_ @AB84 @DezBryant Sorry ... there wasn’t a trail...	judge or jury never evaluated evidence &amp; therefore therefore in our country a person has to be proven guilty.
@DanielGoddard Writers did a great job with Hilary’s departure.  I think Devon should get help &amp; work though Lily driving the car.   It was a horrible acciden.  All in Hilary’s apt before the accident could have done things mmdifferently.  Cane should  help Lily ldeall but no secrets/lies!!!
@aliciakeys I bet no matter how much he keeps you up you’re still the same loving gentle patient mom who transfers as much positive energy to him as he’ll accept at that time.  😊
@VernonShazier  good morning, Vernon.  How are you doing?   	Please keep the prayers coming. Thank you.
And so unselfish
What a wonderful, mature,loving 	Dad.  By the way she clung to him I think she realized he’s the blessing not the dress.  She grew up in that minute.  ❤️ https://t.co/RSRZNQo7NY

@KDKA Well deserved
@GabbyBarrett_ Hi Gabby, I don’t know if Bonnie told u but because of an illness I have Ed &amp; I moved to FL. Since i can’t be in Pgh the 30th maybe you can just whisper the “surprise” in my ear. I promise my lips will be sealed...girl scout’s honor ⭐️🌈⭐️
@hokiebro76 So sorry, Chris. What a tragedy.  Prayers for all who loved him and grieve his death.
@YandR_CBS 💔
@realDonaldTrump For God’s sake, get these children back with their parents or guardians.  This is America....how is it possible these children aren’t reunited by now????
@GabbyBarrett_ Gabby, you are easy to love. ❤️⭐️🌈⭐️
@HillaryClinton Reach into your purse...use YOUR time and resources to help get it straightened out.  LAY YOUR PARTY AFFILIATION AT THE DOOR AND JUST HELP TO GET THE KIDS REUNITED INSTEAD OF USING THE SITUATION FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES
@JacksonLeeTX18 Please start trying to use your talents, experience and resources to UNIFY our country instead of DIVIDING it through hate. Forget party affiliation and just start doing what corporate America has to do....work through differences, negotiate, compromise &amp; resolve
@YRInsider @camryngrimes @CBSDaytime So deserved
@camryngrimes @MishaelMorgan1 I can barely watch myself.  There’s just something between your &amp; “Devon’s” roles that translate way beyond “soap opera roles”.  The chemistry and reality of the anger, the passion, the caring and loving portrayed is so deep and real.  😢😭
@RepCummings  Please start trying to use your talents, experience and resources to UNIFY our country instead of DIVIDING it through hate? Forget party affiliation and just start doing what corporate America has to do....work through differences, negotiate, compromise &amp; resolve
@Comey Please use your talents, experience and resources to UNIFY our country instead of DIVIDING it through hate? Forget party affiliation and just start doing what corporate America has to do....work through differences, negotiate, compromise &amp; resolve
@TeamPelosi Why wasn’t this done previously?  Now these are upcoming campaign promises.   	Shame on all the party affiliations!!!  Finally got it....no matter the party...it’s all self motivated.
@tdutko11 I don’t understand it either!
@VernonShazier Appreciate those offered up....still needing them if you think of it.  	BTW, I still pray for Ryan....your spiritually, physically and emotionally strong son.  You must be so proud of the man he is.  I do hear that the apple doesn’t fall from the tree. 😊

@kathygriffin You’re offended why?
@kathygriffin You just love stirring the pot, don’t you?  Wonder just how many extreme left and extreme right have contributed to dividing Americans!
@tdutko11 Where’s the dislike button?
@ktko101 Why????
@TeamPelosi Are you really really insinuating that  Republicans are the only men who have, or do, demean women?
How sad that grown adults ...and PEOPLE WE VOTED TO SERVE THE PEOPLE...would not vote 4  the organization that protects us, our families, friends &amp; communities all because of hating the current administration.  Seems they’d rather destroy our society/country. https://t.co/5oxpAv8gJW

@carrieunderwood  @carrieunderwood It seems U &amp; U’Re  hubby R wise in making U’re relationship personal &amp; about the “quality” of U’re time spent 2gether  not quantity.   	No matter how busy U R make time 2 have date night.
@MaestroMichaels @kathygriffin @MonicaLewinsky It’s really sad and unfair to lump all people under one label....whether it’s political, public service roles, religious,etc

@DaveDiCello Shame that a person is so dishonest....guess their money must come a lot easier so they don’t have have respect for an honest man trying to make an honest living (such as yourself)  	Hope you can get it repaired quickly and easily.

@Epj7Now I do NOT want us to be a socialist country
@Pirates 👍
@IslesRW Sid is a class act!
@PensInsideScoop We welcome you back 👍
@tdutko11 What a wonderful gesture.  👍
@billpeduto Did you attend?
@MaddiePoppe It’s good you’re allowing yourself to be seen as human.  Don’t lose being down to earth.
@shamarko21ya Love your attitude, Shamarko.
@penguins @tdutko11 Ugh
@tdutko11 Just remember everything in moderation can be OK.....excess is the problem.   👍
@kathygriffin @THR Wonder if that #1 ranking is due to you finding  “a way”  to bring  attention to herself.
@kathygriffin You just don’t let up. Trouble makers 2 trouble makers no matter how they package their cause. 	We need 2 come together 2	use R voices, energy, time &amp; resources 2 lobby 2 get the things we feel R unacceptable &amp; inappropriate changed.
@MikeHilton_28 OMG, Mike.....we can’t wait!!!
@ktko101 @JackieCainTV So true
@Chickillo56 👍
@TeamJuJu That just doesn’t sound like you, JuJu.
@kathygriffin Oh come on, adults, please stop inciting each other.
Please Pittsburgh....show everyone your Pittsburgh pride.  Voices can heard without violence, disrespect and hate! https://t.co/43QD225IsL
@MaddiePoppe @MichaelJWoodard ???
@kathygriffin @ACTBrigitte Better ratings on the opposition side?????
@pvnktrashzak There is NEVER a time when life isn’t worth living!  “If” you feel that way please talk to someone.
@tdutko11 Did you go and get it?
@GabbyBarrett_ Can’t wait to hear what it is.
@tdutko11 Everyone has times when they can’t do something they want to do....no $$, no vacation time, sometimes it’s just not the right time. Think back to the many times you were able to go and remember the great memories you made...know there’s always another time! ❤️
@WhiteHouse Publicize this everywhere you can in a way that the average person unders it.
@MarkKaboly 👍
@pgh2o @billpeduto Great.....and correct....goal. 👍
@BebeRexha 👍  perfect advice.
@jharrison9292 Great that you’ve taken....and continue to....take care of your body.   Good for you!  I really admire your commitment to take care of yourself.
Great advice.  Those of you still working ... bring your best work and team effort to your job everyday.  👍 https://t.co/977fQPve6Y

@BandB_CBS Yes.

@BandB_CBS Glad for Wyatt &amp; Sally
@MishaelMorgan1 When is your last day? 😢😭
@michaelmuhney @Cubs For Truman to be such a special child you all must be a special family.
@BandB_CBS 	Enough of this horrible storyline.  Let Steffy tell Liam what Bill has been doing, stay strong about her life with Liam and the baby.
@colin_dunlap Not me
@Epj7Now 👍👍
@Epj7Now That’s obsession and is not ok
@BandB_CBS He has no business starting to confide in Hope....and Steffy has no business talking to Bill at all.
@BandB_CBS @JacquelineMWood @don_diamont I hope NOT.   Her letting him coming in to her &amp; Liam’s home has to stop
@GabbyBarrett_ Give your best performance ever!  Make the fans want to see lots more of the two of you ⭐️🌈⭐️
@AB84 Just keep your eye on the prize!	LET’S GO.STEELERS!!!
@BandB_CBS 👍
@YRInsider @Michael_Mealor @soapsindepthcbs Really like him as an actor and love the Y&amp;R role he’s playing
@MaddiePoppe @calebleemusic That’s really neat that you realize how special he is.  While you both are busy building your careers make sure you both prioritize qualty fun time together.
@kathygriffin @MELANIATRUMP Really, Kathy???? .....and did Melania or any people who weren’t Obama advocates then create a movement to have him removed from a restaurant, not serve him gas or a retail store?
@YandR_CBS I am
@ktko101 Neat!
@BandB_CBS ABSOLUTELY.....SHE MADE  THAT COMMITMENT TO HIM.   	 SURELY THE WRITERS CAN BE MORE CREATIVE THAN TO DRAG THIS ON.....LET STEFFY TELL BILL TO DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO BUT SHE WILL NOT LET HIM OR ANYONE RUIN HER, LIAM OR THEIR DAUGHTER’S LIVES.  PERIOD.
@LeVeonBell As high up as you can get yourself through hard  work, focus, safe and relentless Steeler football.  I’ll be cheering loud and hard for you every game no matter what the number is, LeVeon.
@kathygriffin Besides running your mouth and perpetrating division within our country and spewing hate what are you doing to CONSTRUCTIVELY facilitate appropriate change?
@KelvinBeachumJr Great you have strong family values.
@tdutko11 Why?
@carrieunderwood @Carrie_under17 @Ludacris @AmericanIdol @YO_RANDYJACKSON You’ve worked hard...you deserve for it to be good.  Stay “grounded”, keep God in your life and I’m sure it will stay good.
@shamarko21ya He is so beautiful and blessed 2 and have a dad who loves him so much &amp; is committed 2 raising him well. No matter what job we have there’s no greater job than being a good committed parent. When the sun is out I’m sure that’s your mom looking down smiling &amp; beaming with pride.
@ktko101 @AllTimeLow @JackAllTimeLow @riandawson @zackalltimelow Love this picture.  What beautiful happy smiles on both of you.
@GabbyBarrett_ You are an amazing young lady, Gabby.  Your love and enjoyment of your fans is so admirable.
@PressSec @POTUS Take the high road.  I feel sorry for people who have intolerance for others having a right to their own opinions, views and choices.
@dabody52 @mrsmoats52 Congratulations.   May you have many many years of love, friendship, health and partnership together.   Never stop having a date night together regularly.
@ktko101 @tdutko11 @DanAndShay Wow.  I’m shocked.   Glad you’re enjoying it. ❤️
@ktko101 🙏
@BandB_CBS MARRY LIAM!!!!!!! Don’t even talk to Bill!
@Arlene72092407 @allenwallace @gerrydulac Nice!
@IvankaTrump Agree. It has to be done sooner than later.....for ALL concerned
@Epj7Now This is nuts!
@BreitbartNews THIS IS NUTS!!!
@colin_dunlap I totally agree
@Epj7Now 👍
@kathygriffin Agree....someone doesn’t have to have children to be heartsick over these innocent children.  We just need to band together and use our voices, energy and resources to constructively and quickly fix this
@kathygriffin How do you know a person who doesn’t like you swearing voted for him?  I don’t like it because social media is a public forum that has many impressionable children and young adults on these forums.
@DavidMTodd @Shenk77 Agree.  How about shooting someone in the legs?
@kathygriffin Do you have children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews? Surely you  don’t  	talk like this around them.
@BandB_CBS Love that he chose Steffy
@jennimiller29 @HillaryClinton I will call the White House and ask about this.  But I won’t use my energy &amp; efforts to broaden the divide among us.
@jennimiller29 @HillaryClinton I’m living because both my dad &amp; my mom’s parents immigrated legally from other countries. They made a life 4 themselves &amp; their children.... which their children benefited from.  They didn’t have 2 run, hide...neither did their children.....because of trying 2 enter illegally.
@jennimiller29 @HillaryClinton Let me make this clear....I am in total support of people .... &amp; their children... who enter R country LEGALLY (follows R immigration policies, process &amp; procedures).  I do not, and will not, support individuals entering ILLEGALLY.
@colin_dunlap I initially speak to them and then base if I continue to do so based on how they respond.
@brennamsullivan @timonei42144713 @kentuckygrandma @kathygriffin Really??????
@KATELINDER @YandR_CBS @YRInsider @CBSDaytime 👍
@jennimiller29 @HillaryClinton Even the prior president wanted to tighten up on illegal immigrants entering our country.
@jennimiller29 @HillaryClinton For the millionth time a person seeking asylum has various LEGAL paths 2 go through. If a person crosses the border, has the intent 2 stay here but does NOT follow the LEGAL paths they R here ILLEGALLY. 	This should not be hard to understand &amp; should not be causing division.
@HillaryClinton Agree but doesn’t give license 2 break the laws of this country!!!  Parents should insure the safe &amp; secure entry 4 their children into this country.   	It’s a travesty that instead of trying 2 legally change the laws many would rather use their “words” 2 tear R country apart.
@HillaryClinton This is a country that has laws...	There’s a procedure to enter legally....Where was all of your humanitarian concern 3 years ago when u could have effected immigration and legally changed the laws?	Have you and Bill opened your home to help? Are you in a “gated” community?
@DaveDiCello You ALWAYS manage to capture such beauty and interest in your photography
@YandR_CBS I smell TROUBLE
@kentuckygrandma @kathygriffin ANY AND ALL
@timonei42144713 @kentuckygrandma @kathygriffin What is BOT?
@YRInsider I want it to be Victor
@kathygriffin Unbelievable, Kathy.
@JudicialWatch 👍👍👍👍👍
@BetsyBG @kathygriffin I think it’s inherent that adults be role models for children and young adults.
@kentuckygrandma @kathygriffin I was speaking directly to Kathy Griffin but it apples to all adults 	who don’t seem able, or willing, to communicate and get their point across without using vulgar, disgusting, inappropriate language, terms and references.
@kathygriffin How about....	lacking the traits of being a role model 4 children/young adults...	using U’re resources &amp; means 2 influence appropriate changes in a positive way...	“respecting” the female gender by not using disgusting terms when referring 2 a female that U don’t like..
@tdutko11 You really need to work on that, Ty.  How long can you run your car on near empty?
@kathygriffin  I’d say as “adults” we have a responsibility to be “role models” for our children/young adults.  Your remarks are disgusting and by no means are role model material!!
@DOCnation_7 OMG, I can’t believe he’s that big already.  I saw him several times at the home games when he was an infant.  The years go by way too quickly. 😢
@michaelmuhney Don’t know where that Dey came from 😖
@HillaryClinton It takes a lot more than “thinking” about these children.  Children need to be taken care of (HOUSING, CLOTHING, FOOD, EDUCATION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, SOCIAL EXPENSES) Seems to me the greater sin is to bring them here &amp; have no means to do the above.
@BillClinton It takes a lot more than “thinking” about these children.  Children need to be taken care of (HOUSING, CLOTHING, FOOD, EDUCATION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, SOCIAL EXPENSES) Seems to me the greater sin is to bring them here &amp; have no means to do the above.
@TheCUTCH22 What a great picture of you &amp; your son. Enjoy every minute that you can with him....it all goes way too quickly
@michaelmuhney Something tells me you are Dey one of those good ones. 👍

@YandR_CBS   Victor/Nick battle “again” is an over used story line.

@KelvinBeachumJr @nyjets @heykayadams @SkydioHQ You a good man, Kelvin.  For certain you would represent the US well
@MClaireEgan It’s upsetting to see people have phones at the table during meals as they text or accept calls.  Many have lost basic social  &amp; verbal communication skills because their phones, video games, social media rule their priorities.   Really sad. 😞

@michaelmuhney Deserved
@michaelmuhney 👍
It’s time adults quit using profanity on social media. We need 2 B example 4 young adults (&amp; children who have access).  In private conversations adults can talk as their moods, vocabulary, self respect &amp; respect 4 others permits but that shouldn’t B the case in a public forum.
@jonnybrenns Very scary.

@ChrisDenvergi @DougDavidsonYR Agree
@DougDavidsonYR Also the writers need to get real....women don’t wear sexy blouses &amp; dresses to work and people don’t make out or have sex in offices.
RT @HealingMB: You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back…
@DougDavidsonYR Women should dress appropriately for the office not like they’re going out partying.
@michaelmuhney So great that you see&amp; hear the beauty &amp; preciousness of your children.  That is marvelous.
@DougDavidsonYR Agree totally.  I’m disgusted with the writers.  The Victor/Nicki/Nick/ Victoria on again off again is old &amp; pathetic.   	Can’t stand that every scene with Billy &amp; Phyllis they have to be making out.  What happened to Billy being supportive to Victoria &amp; their 2 children?
@ktko101 IS THIS TRUE?
@AB84 So many do not, AB.......	unfortunately who are going to suffer the most are our precious children.   Heartbreaking!
@ClarenceElijah Some not all.

@shamarko21ya The best job in the world, Shamarko.....bring the best parent we can be 👍
@GabbyBarrett_ Agree.  Gabby, you are turning scars into stars...way to go	⭐️🌈⭐️
@davebirkett @MarkKaboly Absolutely agree
@DavidMTodd Pittsburgh being ridiculous...I’m biased
@AdamSchefter @astockeyWTAE Personal issues should remain OUT of the workplace...to include a field.   No one should prevent a player from appropriately and legally expressing their views outside of the workplace.  		@nflnetwork @NFLonFOX 	@KDKA @ESPNNFL
@dabody52  @mrsmoats52  @steelers 	I am a Steeler die hard fan. I am going 2 pray the Steelers pick U up again.  U’re a great athlete, but more importantly, a good human being, husband, father, teammate.  You’re mature, wise, positive &amp; a respected leader...all traits we need 🙏
@kelly_clarkson @BrynnCartelli @NBCTheVoice Congratulations!  Was happy to see you both win.  🎈💕🎈

@colin_dunlap Why doesn’t the media and haters just leave him alone?   He’s a damn good hockey player who elects not to be in the limelight.  Plain &amp; simple.   	 	@penguins 	@PensJG
@NFL   	ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY MISSED TO GET THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT!!! YOU’RE GOING TO PUNISH THE “ENTIRE” TEAM FOR THOSE THAT KNEEL??	CERTAINLY NOT THOUGHT OUT BY DECISION MAKERS. https://t.co/3mH9h8pQyD
@DavidMTodd .....and why would that be???
@realDonaldTrump Quit teasing us!
@soapcentral @BandB_CBS This nonsense needs to quit...Wyatt not telling Liam 	that he &amp; Steffy were being 	set up is a disgrace.  Katy encouraging Wyatt to not tell Liam is a bigger disgrace.  Adults shouldn’t sell their souls &amp; adults shouldn’t play matchmaker for grown adults.

@LukeBryanOnline BTW, your vocabulary is just fine, goshdarnit.
@LukeBryanOnline I sure hope that when you’re doing a show in Pittsburgh you’ll have Gabby sing some songs with you.  You two sound great together.
@thecrossover23 Disgusting - Sad - Heartbreaking.

@katyperry @LukeBryanOnline Katie, as a judge I can respect u giving your honest professional opinion after each performance &amp; if that favors a specific contestant that’s just the way it goes...but as a judge I think it was very inappropriate for u to make a statement that you were voting for one candidate

@1SteveBurton Just wonder why some people just don’t understand that
@AB84 Sad but true
@iammikemitchell Amen.  Just doesn’t make a lick of sense!

@dabody52 @mrsmoats52 You seem to be an amazing husband and father.   There is no greater job on this earth than that if a spouse and parent.
@DaveDiCello You have an amazing eye and talent, Dave.
@katyperry @GabbyBarrett_ @RyanSeacrest Love to see the “human” side of people from all walks of life.
@GabbyBarrett_ I can understand how nerves can get the best of any contestant.....just stay in touch with the fact that God has given you a talent that you’ve chosen to use and grow.   Sing from your heart and soul as you do when you’re on stage ❤️
@kristoffstjohn1 Can’t wait for the writers to bring you back.  Would love to see you with Ashley.

@jharrison9292 You sure know how to keep yourself healthy.  👍
@TeamJuJu AMEN.  Negativity is like cancer....continues to destroy/poison a person’s mind, thoughts and heart.   Need to work to replace it with positive thinking and actions.   Much easier and happier way to live and keep and grow relationships.
@TeamJuJu You are just too cute, JuJu 😊
@Dat_Dude_Nix My husband and I really enjoy First Watch as well.
@LeVeonBell None of the above, LeVeon.  They bite....only want one bug to bite you.....the “Steeler bug” for you and your brothers to win #7 this upcoming season. 😊
@CBSPittsburgh Another Pirate blunder....should of went after Neil when he was available!
@PensInsideScoop So precious
@Dat_Dude_Nix Ugh......super frustrating!

@Steel_Curtain4 Please stop!
@VinnyVidiVici98 Walk to school - depends on how far it  is - run in the rain -            	Not really.   Agree with you, Arthur- I believe a person should praise publicly and provide negative feedback privately.
@YandR_CBS ABSOLUTELY
@LeVeonBell Praying that you all reach an agreement so the focus can be on a winning season and unity on the team.
@_BigBen7 Happy Belated Birthday, Ben.  Hope you had a special day. Wishing you a fantastic year!	🎂🎉🎈
@LeVeonBell Something I say repeatedly to myself.
@VernonShazier So so true!

@VinnyVidiVici98 Amen....true for so many!!
@ktko101 Amazing to watch!
@VernonShazier You’re a very wise man  👍
@BarackObama This has been a SERIOUS NEED for MANY MANY  years?   What is wrong with a government that doesn’t fix it?
@VinnyVidiVici98 I’m not aware of why they’re mad at you. Can someone tell me?
@DOCnation_7 I loved them....still do
@penguins Agree completely

@penguins Miss him...and his boys... at practice
@AB84 Can’t find the right words yet. It hurts the way you all lost.  The brotherhood, experience and talent was there  - this was to be the year! I can’t imagine how you all must feel.  Know this... Steelers have the Steeler Nation....we’re here for the long haul.  ❤️
@KDPomp The only other time I remember feeling this bad was when we lost to Green Bay in the SB.   	I need a 12 step program to help me not take Steeler losses so seriously.  😢
@mrsmoats52 I just feel sick.  This was the group of guys that could have done it....but didn’t.    Give your hubby an extra hug tonight...I’m sure all the guys need one
@AKinkhabwala They WILL!
@gerrydulac D didn’t show up!!!!
@LedyardNFLDraft Pathetic!
@Steel_Curtain4 So sad....so unnecessary

@JMackeyPG @Letang_58 Heartwarming ❤️
@KDPomp If the Pirates owners don’t have the passion for a winning team, the city and the fans they should sell it to someone who will and go in a corner and count their money.

You’re a veteran.... help the younger ones experience winning a SB 👍
@_BigBen7   I pray you never wanted “it” this badly and that you’ve never prepared for any prior games like you will for these next games.   7 is waiting for you and the guys to come and get it.  Want it...taste it...breath it...smell it...feel it...see it...until you hold it!!!
@VernonShazier Perfect

@PaulZeise It’ll be all up to them.  Since it’s mid season anything is possible.
@L_Bell26 Neither did we, LeVeon.  Good thing #8 never took his eye off  	the ball
@realDonaldTrump 1st step to handling it well is stop tweeting.               	2nd step- stop calling people names.  Take the high road.     	3rd step- Listen to people trying to help you.
@VernonShazier Everyday we wake up is a bonus day.  With gratitude and personal pride we should make every day count with all that we do.

@camryngrimes How are you able to determine that it’s the same guy?
@colin_dunlap Just telling it like it was!
@KDPomp Agreed with you.

@Steelersdepot I don’t .....I love the Steelers ❤️
@Steelersdepot Huge loss
@chasepwilliams @champssports @AB84 He has a big heart

@VernonShazier He is, and will remain, in my prayers.   Asking God to put His healing, loving and caring arms around Shazier.
@ThaBestUNO  Happy Birthday, Martavis.  Wishing you a special day and a fantastic year!
@AB84 You are certainly loved.
@KDPomp @937theFan Work on their passing - take more shots - be more aggressive at the net - minimize penalties.
@TeamJuJu JuJu - never let a thing or anyone change you. You’re a great, caring, thoughtful young man.    God bless you.

@KDPomp @CBSPittsburgh You are unfortunately right, Bob.  Very sad...and troubling.
@DaveDiCello @jmarshfof Dave, don’t give an ounce of apology or rationale to rude people.  You are a one man gallery owner....you have every right to run your business as you need to.  If people don’t like it they can express themselves in an appropriate manner &amp; go elsewhere.  Wishing you the best.
@DaveDiCello Sad how rude and inappropriate supposed adults can act.  It’s a shame.
@PaulZeise I’m a Steelers die hard but I’m really glad you’ve been medically cleared.
@TeamJuJu I know one thing for sure....Boujee will be in a loving, fun and caring home.     Enjoy your new family member!
@TribLIVE He is a really neat young man with a good caring heart.
@TeamJuJu ....and trust us we’re glad of it!!!!	👍💕🎉🎈
@VernonShazier Praying for your wonderful son and all of you.  ❤️
@VernonShazier God will hear your, your family’s, Ryan’s family, friends, teammates, Steelers management and fans prayers.   Ryan is a good man .....he has a lot of future positive impact to make as a family man, a friend and an athlete.   I’m praying for all of you.
@TribSports How motivated  can  the  players be with what he says &amp; does.   It’s a disgrace.!  If that’s all the feelings he has towards the game,  the players, the city &amp;  fans he should take his money &amp;  go  off into the sunset  doing something else.
@dlolley_pgh Sure glad he didn’t know.  Now come on Steeler coaches, play him!!
@Realrclark25 Not true
@realDonaldTrump So do many of us!!!
@shamarko21ya Never lose your positive attitude, Shamarko.  Keep the faith.
@BryanDeArdo Good to see you honoring your teammate, AB, as you are.
@AB84 Steeler Nation does not take well anyone trying to hurt you or any of our guys!!!
@jharrison9292 Happy Birthday, James.  Hope daddy made sure you had a special day.  Siding you a great year! 🎉🎈🎉
RT @VernonShazier: Keep praying for my boy. God’s going to give him a great testimony.
@VernonShazier Praying hard for Ryan. 🙏
@PensInsideScoop Love that man
@dabody52 @mrsmoats52 You are a beautiful family.  Merry Christmas and Happy Healthy and Peaceful New Year
@DaveDiCello Unbelievable
@937theFan 🙏
@44_Matakevich Wishing you a full and quick recovery as well, Tyler.
@Steelersdepot @TeamJuJu Now that is brilliant!  Fast thinkers!
@FranGarro_ Can understand how he feels that way
@Steelersdepot Don’t buy consistently administered
@iammikemitchell Mike, love what you have to say....put all that heartfelt energy on the field your next game but play safe &amp; smart.
@TeamJuJu I can spot some tip money....just let me know
@soapparty411 @MClaireEgan @Susan_Lucci I remember
@MClaireEgan They are heros.  God bless and protect them.
@TeamJuJu We will not quit praying until we  can clap and holler as you walk back onto the field dressed in black and gold.   Then you’ll be in my “group” prayer thst the Steelers play relentless, smart and safe Steelers football.
@jharrison9292 We need you on the field in black and gold.  PLEASE do whatever you need to do to get improved enough to play	🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
@EdBouchette @PittsburghPG Can certainly understand why
@fsmikey @ktko101 Don’t understand how Groningen got a one game suspension as JuJu a and Iloka.  Doeś’t make sense
@KDPomp @TroyVincent23 Good question.  Corrective actions need to be relative to the offense(s) and implemented consistently and fairly.
@RyanShazier @44_Matakevich Lots of us still praying 🙏❤️
@PensInsideScoop BELIEVE
@PensJG 😭
@EdBouchette Absolutely
@EdBouchette I think JuJu just let his emotions run ahead of him last night.
@TheCUTCH22 I have been really praying for him.
@penguins @PensJG YES
@iblok1 @L_Bell26 No it isn’t, LeVeon
@SirWilliam9691 @L_Bell26 No it isn’t, LeVeon
@2blueyes @L_Bell26 I was too.  It was awful
@L_Bell26 I tho k what’s awkward is the silence...so I try to visit e up with some chit chat to break the ice.
@Dat_Dude_Nix Bring your right eye lid down slowly while you leave the left eye open    Practice  You can do it 👍
@nicks_right @KDPomp How could that be?
@KDPomp NFL just doesn’t get “consistent” “equitable” and “fair”
@KDPomp @937theFan Exactly what he should have told hin!  We have to have the same expectations for our team as we have for other teams.
@Steelersdepot @ProFootballTalk Praying for his complete and quick recovery.
@Steelersdepot @ProFootballTalk Thank God.  Praying Goff his complete and quick recovery.
@3williethadude9 @RyanShazier Praying hard.
@KDPomp Same with me.  I just couldn’t focus on the game.   Just want Ryan to be OK
@EdBouchette That would be the best news his family and friends, teammates, coaches, fans  could hear.  Praying that we all get good news!

@MarioLemieuxFdn Mario, thank you for selecting Pittsburgh to be where you and your family would initially reside and as well invest in the Pens.
@dabody52 @ProjectBundleUp Arthur,  you are one of the people God made to be so special
@PensInsideScoop ....and the Pens
@PensInsideScoop Glad for Jarry

@camryngrimes You’re beautiful no matter what.
@MLB Me
@_TJWatt TJ, make your mark in the remaining games.  You CAN do it!
@KDPomp Ridiculous!
@TheCUTCH22 He’s an amazing athlete.... but so are you, Cutch.  Always have been, and always will be, a Cutch fan.
@dabody52 You are an amazing family man, athlete, team player and human being.  God made you special so that you could be a role model and touch the lives of so many.
#VoiceSaveJanice
@jharrison9292 You’re jersey, cleats and gloves may be worn but you aren’t!
@jharrison9292 Just want you to play 🙏
@KelvinBeachumJr Congratulations!  Wishing you and your family only the best.
@realDonaldTrump   Since you like to tweet please tweet back to this....	Would you say ‘he said he didn’t do it” if it were a man who allegedly fondled, groped or sexually assaulted your adolescent child?
@realDonaldTrump You are a narcissistic person who must have attention, recognition and the last word for everything you do.  A leader is able to credit those team members around him and not always be a right fighter!
@blakeshelton @NBCTheVoice You made the initial self choice...thank you!
@dabody52 What a great picture.  We love you guys (in God’s way).....we believe in you....and you have our total support.  @

@KDPomp I don’t need anything to remind me to appreciate Ben.  He is our warrior.  Takes a lot of hits, sacks &amp; just gets up &amp; refocuses. Love him.
@Dat_Dude_Nix Homeless Shelter
@L_Bell26 Absolutely precious
@ShelbyCassesse Stephon is such a great guy.
@dabody52    Your beautiful eyes that smile...your big &amp; caring heart....the love u have for your family...the commitment you have for the community...the great attitude you have as a teammate ..all make you the terrific man that you are.  Thank you for being a great role model.

@jharrison9292 Please get better so you can get back on the field doing what you do best when you’re out there.  YOU ARE MISSED!
@Steelersdepot Let’s get Harrison playing again.  We need him defensively
@blazedd0nut @khaIeesi_ Tell him/her politely that you prefer to leave work at work when you leave and that you’ll be glad (if that’s the truth) to discuss things during work hours
@RealSaavedra @AnnCoulter Pretty disgusting
@ktko101 That is too funny
@TheTalkCBS @people Agree

@Wes_Saunders88 Great post!
@Wes_Saunders88 @NFL @nflcommish Wishing you the best, Wes. How did it go?
@ThePoniExpress I agree AS LONG as he understands Y what he did was so unacceptable 2 so many &amp; wouldn't use a sports forum 4 a personal stand
@dabody52 @RMHCPittsburgh @UberEATS @mrsmoats52 You have a heart of gold! Your wife and children R blessed.  So R the Steelers &amp;Steeler Nation! May God continue 2 bless U and your family
@NFL @AB84 Must be nice! Would love to ride in one once!🙏
@AB84 @_BigBen7 AB, where's that "million dollar"	smile?
@jharrison9292 Y R so focused,disciplined, relentless &amp; have an "over the top" work ethic. If only more guys worked out as u do..team would be unstoppable
@EdBouchette Let's Go Steelers! Make this year YOUR year!🏆

@DOCnation_7 Great attitude! I believe when the body is in crisis it needs the mind 2 stay positive	U r a great team leader &amp; role model 4 u're family.
@__bELIeve17 Eli just respond no matter what he calls you.  Become invaluable 👍
@DOCnation_7 @KDPomp Hi Stephon, I'm the older woman who should speak 2 u @ the radio show @the Wexford Giant when you filled in 4 AB. How r u &amp; u're family?
@WizardOfBoz09 What was their rationale?   I see people doing that every home game we go to.
@ThePoniExpress Me neither
@DOCnation_7 @CamHeyward Hope you'll be doing the radio show st Giant Eagle this upcoming season.  Enjoyed those shows a lot.
@PensJG I'm already missing coming up to the Lemieux center to watch the Pens practice and going to the arena for home games.  😩
@ROOTSPORTSPIT This is what support looks like between teams.......
@WTAE Will pray for this poor child.
@mstr824 @DaveDiCello Hope your right
@switzthetroll @KDPomp They ALL need to play their "A" game on Monday.
@KDPomp PP - horrible	passing - horrible	energy - left in the locker room	penalties - our gifts to them	Not happy how they played tonight!
@penguins Pens only played reacting to Nashville playing THEIR game.
@chrisv828 @KDPomp Great question.   Dislike him immensely
@KDPomp Don't understand why we don't double up on Subban &amp; Fisher to show them down. Why aren't we making hard LEGAL hits?
@ffsta12 @KDPomp AMEN
@bobgrove91 Not happy how we played tonight.

@KDPomp Bob, please be right TONIGHT 🙏
@DOCnation_7 I kind of like:   earn respect so that it can then be demanded.
@DarylRupnik @KDPomp Unacceptable!!! I'm ticked!
@KDPomp What the refs are "missing " is DISGUSTING!! Something NEEDS to be done - it's just NOT ok.  Calls should be consistent
@camryngrimes Me too.  I love coming home to a clean house.
@DOCnation_7 That's great.  Wishing him the best!
@PensInsideScoop Love that man. Thank God Pens kept him 👍❤️

@ben_geier @JacobGiggles @Real_RobRossi Pardon me??????
@JimmyMack66 @KDPomp Really . Did you watch the Ovi replay????
@KDPomp DISGUSTING!!!!! He just gave his henchmen an OK to play dirty and then try to justify doing it.
@DOCnation_7 You can do it, Tuitt.  Waiting to see you have your BEST Year to date.
@KDPomp I don't get it either.  Don't understand it.
@KDPomp  My theory: Caps held their mtg w/o mgmt so they wouldn't b involved in the plan 2 win this 1 way or another - so henchmen arrived!
@YRInsider @ginatognoni @MyJasonThompson @CBSDaytime Enough already.  There's nothing redeeming about a relationship between them two.  Get him back with Victoria and his kids!!!
@soIoucity @penguins We need him for all the remaining games.  	LET'S GO PENS!!!	🐧❤️🐧❤️🐧❤️

@PPSnews   Great game.  Carrick goalie is amazing.  Cougars played hard.
@KDPomp   Me neither
@penguins  I would have never guessed it correctly 😭
@PensJG @Highmark   Will be glad when he's back but only if 100%

@Epj7Now @KDPomp Totally agree.  Sure miss The Huddle.
@EdBouchette I'll never understand why he didn't pull Ben!! He's too valuable long term when they've locked up the win!
@gerrydulac  hi gerry - donna from the Cranberry Giant Eagle-I think Tomlin should have taken Ben out the last 3 - 5 minutes
@CamHeyward Please keep the guys fired up on &amp; off the field today.  thanks for all your effort when u play &amp; team commitment when u don't

@steelers 	POOR coaching- NOT PREPARED - penalties are a disgrace = lack of discipline &amp; lack of coaching control
@BleacherReport @AdamSchefter Ben is our WARRIOR
@espn Ben is our WARRIOR!!

@KDPomp   POOR coaching  - guys NOT PREPARED - Penalties are a disgrace = lack of discipline lack of coaching control
@KDPomp   BYE BYE TOMLIN ---- ENOUGH OF YOUR EXCUSES!!
@Steelersdepot  Cam has every right to say what he feels.
@LILCOREY_TRILL @ThaBestUNO @. Will pray that the day you walk is sooner than later.  🙏
@ThaBestUNO how are you doing?
@realDonaldTrump I've repeatedly asked you or someone who has your ear to call me.  Only a few days left!!!
@WTAE   DISGUSTING!
@KDPomp  He was on the team - missed why his name wouldn't be on it
@937theFan @Radiodotcom He has to be ACCOUNTABLE that are guys are READY &amp; FIRED up for each game &amp; play!!!!
@937theFan @Radiodotcom  	He needs 2 ENSURE the guys are ready 4 EVERY team opponent. He needs the players making bad penalties ACCOUNTABLE
@KDPomp Switching sports - why wouldn't Tomlin have doubled teamed up on Gronk?
@KDPomp @penguins great to see him  in black
@MolinariPG @PittsburghPG What seems to be the biggest obstacle to the Pens playing like defending champions at this point in the season?
What seems to be the Pens biggest obstacle to playing like defending champions at this point in the season?
@realDonaldTrump  Waiting for you or someone who has your ear to call me.
@KDPomp. Why wouldn't the coach put double coverage on Gronk?? Also Tomlin not managing all the bad penalties -- way too many!  Not OK!!
@CoachTomlin U also need to MANAGE the guys making penalties that gift our opponents and harm our team.  Unacceptable!
@CoachTomlin Mike, it's really time 4 U to do some serious hard self evaluation.  Some of your play calls are very questionable &amp;
@CoachTomlin   Mike, u NEED to rally around QB2.  Needs uplifting comments from you.  Now is the time for EVERY one of our players to man up
@mlogan31 tough not getting sleep. Our first 1st daughter had days/nights confused- took me 5 days to get her schedule turned around
@Wes_Saunders88 @NFL   How are you?

@EdBouchette  I can't wait. I'm going to let the "younger partier" me out when I'm there.    	LETS GO STEELERS!!!
@KDPomp -- our guys need to find ways to rush the opponent QB's faster &amp; tougher. They too frequently are given way too much time!!!
@EdBouchette glad to hear you admit to watching Nashville.  My husband &amp; I love it. Going to Nashville for first time in the spring. 😊
@CoachTomlin I am being a non Tomlin supporter. Shame as I WAS a big supporter!
@CoachTomlin   YOU &amp; the coaches NEED to MOTIVATE the team &amp; ENSURE they're TOTALLY and FULLY PREPARED for EACH game they play!!!
RT @BobLabriola: Landry Jones will be prepared to start vs. Browns on Sunday. https://t.co/DORXUseZko
@CoachTomlin Please manage guys getting emotional/reactionary penalties -- they're gifts to opponents &amp; hurt us.
@steelers @CoachTomlin Lots of practice needed protecting our QB!!!
@steelers No Big Ben until he's FULLY recovered. We need him long term!!
@CoachTomlin plez get the guys who get emotional/reactionary penalties managed. Don't need to benefit r competitors &amp; hurt ourselves.
@Steelersdepot He is amazing!  Wonder if he works out as consistently and with the intensity as James.
@Steelers__News ONLY if he's COMPLETELY healed/recovered. His health and well being is #1 and we need him long term.
