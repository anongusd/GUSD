@DANahyINREALIFE I think you've seen it over the last 5 or so years. Women supporting women. Employing women, purchasing goods created by women. We saw the systemic issues and said: "Alright, let's be better... let's move forward together."
@DANahyINREALIFE What an unfortunate thing to make human decency a left or right issue.
We were having this conversation in our house recently. Why has the general response been "I didn't know it was THAT bad. It's certainly not me, I don't know guys like that" Instead of "Wow. This is clearly a systemic problem- how can we move forward and make our sons better?" https://t.co/KXqVFlDjdn

@MrJeeps123 The only option then becomes a full time care-giver which is so prohibitively expensive that most women just leave the workforce altogether.
@MrJeeps123 I‚Äôm talking about more childcare options. So many preschools or daycares won‚Äôt take a child until 6 months of age, what if a woman doesn‚Äôt have maternity leave-(which most don‚Äôt, especially not one for 6 months.) When there IS available childcare, there‚Äôs a year-long wait list!
@Watwood6pack Oh I know.. it‚Äôs impossible! I liked this story because it showed how challenging it is even WHEN you are the boss, have an office, and have everything at your disposal. You‚Äôre exactly right. Think of the people who don‚Äôt have this kind of access. We have to figure it out.
I have so many friends facing this very problem, and more often than not their only choice is to leave the workforce. Businesses are losing talent because there aren‚Äôt enough options for families. Thank God for places like @TheJaneClub , but we need more.

.@AmericanAir morning. They get to their hotel, still excited for the vacation to come. Then they get a notification at 10:30p (they were in bed) that their NEW flight was cancelled. They had been rescheduled- economy- on a THIRD flight- now with a LAYOVER in Dallas..
@americanair because the suction in the toilet is broken. Hm. Okay. They deplane. They wait. The flight is cancelled. Fine, that‚Äôs understandable- no one wants a broken shitter for a five and a half hour flight. You did the right thing &amp; re-booked them for a new flight the next

@jetsjets @mrBobbyBones I agree with that- however, the reason they said it significantly changed wasn't because of the race of the victims, It's because it went from looking like targeted murder (a box specifically on someones front porch,) to killing anyone randomly in a neighborhood (a trip wire)

@marcericnorton Yup!
@katiebellmoore I don't think many people knew the extent of it- I certainly didn't. But I believe that everyone knew.
@_Lake_ Ha. Not even close. So much worse.
It's the kind of behavior (I too am guilty for turning a blind eye) that enabled this and will continue to enable it.
I think that's one of the things that upsets me the most. I'm not a "Hollywood insider" and I knew. This "shock" felt by so many is bullsh*t

@mcornelia precisely!
@Whycensored @ispizzaratalive to be clear- I am NOT a Trump supporter- I just think this nickname is kinda funny.
@smopper why does finding one thing funny dictate my entire political stance?
@smopper please read my replies. I'm certainly not supporting- just find this one phrase funny. Simple as that. I guess humor is dead.
@MichaelSCooper it's a pet peeve when people misunderstand my intentions. I need to let it go!
@PJTheWorkaholic @dav88ide doesn't necessarily mean it's factual at any given time... but the phrase has always been there.
@PJTheWorkaholic @dav88ide for years and years the phrase "leader of the free world" has been synonymous with the US president. That's all.
@BTSC_Radio @SmokeysHowl I don't disagree, but we're allowed to laugh at an absurdity without it dictating our entire political stance.
@BTSC_Radio @SmokeysHowl HARDLY making excuses. I just find "rocket man" to be funny.
@CarlinBob I know... but come on... it's a little funny...
Oh Mexico City üíî...
@SmokeysHowl agreed. But at the very least it gives us a comical break from the usual depressing/terrifying news cycle.
.@pedroambriz absolutely, but TYPICALLY speaking the phrase "leader of the free world" is synonymous with The President of the US.
@ispizzaratalive absolutely not. In no way shape or form. I just find this one thing amusing.
I have to say, Trump calling Kim Jung-un "Rocket Man" might be my favorite thing he's done as the leader of the free world.

Lovely. ‚Äú@1LondonPaul: take it easy, remember what happened the last time we drank at the airport..Cc: @andyroddick https://t.co/GiUqblIuH0‚Äù
@Bonnie_D_Ford this is incredible. How have we never heard of this, @andyroddick ?!
I'm inclined to agree with this statement. Specifically the "gr8" part. 		‚Äú@BlakeX10: @BrooklynDecker you wld make a gr8 shaman‚Äù
@keithkreeger apparently I said "wholeheartedly" because you said "wholeheartedly" #winemusings
@keithkreeger I'd have to wholeheartedly agree with this statement- and I've only hung out with the incredible woman twice!
Crazy thing is I got off to pump thinking "I don't want to offend the guy next to me" But why? He probably sucked a boob too. #winemusings
As women and as moms we try to do it all but it sure ain't easy.
@craigy714 thank you, Twitter. üëç
And I repeat-this is the FIRST TIME leaving my baby. I don't know why I'm sharing all of this. I'm just livid. And tweeting. Whilst drinking
Me: https://t.co/vPSEWWD31L
Me: run to pump because we're already delayed almost 2 hours. I pump in bathroom. Return to gate. Plane is there.. 		"Sorry. Gates closed"
Them:"We're sorry for the mechanical delay" 	Me: Understandable	Them:"Another issue. Bringing a mechanic on. Passengers can leave &amp; return"
WHO LETS PASSENGERS OFF, THEN CLOSES THE GATE SHORTLY AFTER?!? *GULPS WINE* MISSES BABY *SOBS*
RT @andyroddick: Awesome @Delta! 2 hour delay so she has to get off to pump. You give passengers permission to get off and then leave https‚Ä¶
2 mechanical delays. Told we could de-plane. I did. Pumped in the bathroom. Returned 15 min later. Flight closed. Deeeeep breaths.
And do you pump in your seat on the flight?? Or the bathroom?? #Spiraling.
First time leaving baby. It's only 1 night &amp; doesn't make sense to fly him back &amp; forth. I'm a mess.		Moms: booze is my only solution,right?
