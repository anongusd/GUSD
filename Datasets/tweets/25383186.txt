@wethreemusic Great audition! I can't wait to see you on stage again!
@KSNNews That is awful! There should mandatory minimums for those convicted of crimes like this that include actual time jail.	You can't rob someone of a person's life or independence without consequences.

Just watched the latest episode of @GreysABC. There is a very good chance that it is complete coincidence, but I am going to pretend that at the beginning when Alex and Jo(@camilluddington) are on the bridge, Bishop (@D_SAVRE) from @Station19  runs by.
