@AlanLCross @TheAlanNoble Many of my colleagues were privately fine w/ family migration reform, especially because it would reduce the 4 million backlog. Wouldn‚Äôt see a reduction of legal immigration for a decade (which Congress could adjust). Appreciate your concern. Just want you to have the background.
@TheAlanNoble It‚Äôs a gamble. The same President who said he would sign whatever the Senate sent him is the same President who gave a veto threat re: Collins-Rounds-King today. A million Dreamers‚Äô lives are at stake. I chose to support a bill the POTUS would actually sign.
@AlanLCross @TheAlanNoble Because of multiple private conversations I‚Äôve had w/ my Dem colleagues. The Grassley bill had multiple provisions, including family migration reform, from the 1995 Immigration Commission (led by Democrat Rep. Jordan). Many of my colleagues support that Commission but, not POTUS.
Very disappointed we failed to pass immigration legislation this wk. This was a unique opportunity to protect #Dreamers &amp; secure borders. It‚Äôs also disappointing that Dems would't consider our bill simply because the Pres. supported it. Immigration is hard, but we can't give up.
The Schumer-Rounds-Collins plan is well-meaning but has serious flaws.
