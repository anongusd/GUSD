@filosofella Yup.
@packerfn55 I'm responsible for keeping my house in order, but I rely on experts like plumbers and mechanics to keep it from falling apart....
@knarFWzelaznoG2 That's not how ratios work. At a 1 to 1 ratio, the total amount spent could be the same as it is today.
@feminishteacher We support paying staff fairly! Diversified staff will lead to better policy. No question. But when you forgo shifting the cost onto other people, something's gotta give.
@filosofella Those are drops in the bucket. The bigger hole in my logic is the shared assets - the committee staff, other institutional support personnel, the Government Accountability Office, and so on, which help legislators do their jobs.
@packerfn55 Enough to get good policy made?
For every dollar spent by the executive branch, a legislator has  0.00004 cents to spend on making sure that tax dollar was spent well. That's a crazy ratio. It's "trust but don't have the cash to verify."		Who does this arrangement benefit?
Congress's "one job" is to create laws for the executive branch to implement. And it must understand that implementation to make good laws. But while the executive branch has a budget of around $4 TRILLION, each House legislator has about $1.5 MILLION to spend. 2/x
With a fixed office budget, legislators can either hire fewer staff or pay staff less. AOC has chosen the former. Most legislators choose the latter, with affluent staffers or post-Congress lobbying careers making up the difference. With fewer staff, less will get done. https://t.co/GAeDixEc6g

@marcilynflanne3 I expect we won’t know for sure until after it’s all over. Right now, it’s reasonable to presume everything everyone in both parties says is intended to affect the outcome of the negotiations.
@marcilynflanne3 How do you mean? Why did they meet there as opposed to somewhere else or did that meeting make things better or worse? If the former, I assume it’s nice there and if the latter, hard to know for sure. Talks may have started to stall before Sunday.
Good question! Things seemed to be going well through Friday, then yesterday there was a sudden flurry of stories that talks were breaking down. It seemed like that might just be a tactic to pressure each side to concede more. Now? Still not sure. Hoping for more detail today. https://t.co/NcvVli370B

Accidentally un-RT’d this while trying to note that Rep. Zeldin’s inaccuracy is in “free college”. The students would be undocumented people with DACA protections. https://t.co/xk3UFwEFCi
@THEMissMarie Are we The Dude here? If so, which report? This one? https://t.co/eqYWBtXNpg Bc we have read it &amp; it does _not_ say that noncitizens voted. It says people applied for drivers licenses while noncitizens (legal). Unknown is if they naturalized and if that was before voting.
To sum up: if you see an article that both matches what you already believe and falls into the "whoa, if true" category? Don't tweet it out until you've read it very, very carefully and you're sure you're not converting "maybe" into "definitely" in your head. 8/end
Why not? Because "messy data exists" wouldn't confirm @JohnCornyn's belief that noncitizens successfully vote. But a headline implying that noncitizens did vote? That does. It's very easy - and we all do this sometimes - to go from "maybe" to "definitely" in case like this. 7/n
In other words, this article could have just as easily been headlined "22 years of changing voter registration requirements result in messy data, officials say". That would have been just as accurate, although it probably wouldn't have garnered a link from the Senator. 6/n
No. It doesn't mean that despite the fearmongering in the opening paragraphs. Look at what the Travis County Tax Assessor who handles voter registration says: the dataset is new and its validity is unknown. That's _why_ these folks are being contacted. 5/n https://t.co/4YWVFkmvPa

@untoldbumpkins hello@govtrack.us
@untoldbumpkins It doesn't ignore the search text. It's just not ordering by the search text.  And it depends on what you're searching for.
@untoldbumpkins Because I have other things I need to do besides answering your questions, I answer as many as I can get to at a time. If you want to send them all in an email, that'd be easier.
@untoldbumpkins I have a long list of many other things that need fixing on GovTrack, two other jobs, and other life responsibilities. It'll get fixed when it gets fixed, unfortunately. (Also I have no idea what you think the fix is supposed to be that wouldn't make it worse for other uses.)
@untoldbumpkins Here's our code repository: https://t.co/E1ahSiQBpb If it's so easy, please go ahead and make the change!
@untoldbumpkins And I'm not saying that's intuitive. It's not. I'm just letting you know how the site works today.
@untoldbumpkins There's a different default depending on how you get to the search page. If you start with a search in the search bar at the top of every page, it defaults to Relevance. Elsewhere to secret sauce. Depending on what you're looking for, that can be helpful.
@Moore1766 I don't think we've ever applied for a grant from the Open Society Foundation, no. I have done consulting work for them, so I guess the answer is yes once? ~JT
@untoldbumpkins That's me. (I'm not the only person who operates our twitter account, but I am now.)  I wrote the "secret sauce" but not the "Relevance" algorithm.
@untoldbumpkins The last thing to keep in mind is there's no bill currently before Congress with that title. Our search results all default to showing bills currently pending before Congress because that's the primary way we believe people are intending to use the site. It's not always ideal.
@StanleyNormoyle That has nothing to do with whether we're corporate or not.....
@untoldbumpkins The "Relevnace" sort order means relevance of the bill title and text to your keyword search, so that's what you want to use. It's the Solr search engine default sort order.
@untoldbumpkins The secret sauce isn't really a secret. It's the result of a linear regression that takes into account various factors correlated with bills being enacted. It doesn't take into account your keyword search term, which is why it doesn't help you find that bill...

Now that the Democrats have the majority in the House, they have pledged to conduct more thorough (and presumably more adversarial) oversight on a host of topics they felt were under-investigated in the 115th. If they follow through on even a small fraction, it'll be a lot. 3/n
Oversight can be simple and minimally adversarial check-ins with federal agencies to find out how, say, a pilot project for which Congress allocated funds is going. Or, it can be complex and highly adversarial as in the Iran-Contra investigations: https://t.co/WVq4B1tZOg 2/n

@bravehearttexas @lawfareblog I thought you were saying that we can kind of not worry about (i.e. skip) the Senate's advice and consent for the appointment because we can guess how the Senate would vote.
@bravehearttexas @lawfareblog The Constitution doesn't permit steps to be skipped because someone makes a guess.
@msbellows @Diplopundit The legislators *did* expressly say otherwise --- that's what we said in the tweet you're replying to.
So which law applies? The Vacancies Act's committee report specifically says that 28 USC 508 overrules the Vacancies Act: "Senate confirmed Justice Department officials will be the only persons eligible to serve as Acting Attorney General." https://t.co/ihTtH6b39K (5/5)
An earlier law 28 USC 508 specifically addressed how to fill the Attorney General's position. "In case of a vacancy in the office of Attorney General...the Deputy Attorney General may exercise all the duties of that office." https://t.co/0fBD36nEXW (4/n)
The Vacancies Act governs most cases of temporarily filling a vacancy of a Senate-confirmed position, which (generally speaking) allows someone in Whitaker's position to step in. Here's a good overview of that law: https://t.co/WJ8dvDGmS7 But it might not apply for the AG! (3/n)

@HotlineJosh The split result between the House and Senate is due far more to the structural difference in how the bodies are elected than in some voters voting D for House but R for senate, right? How many voters do you think preferred a D House but a R Senate?
Welcome to the "lame duck" session of Congress, the period between the election and when the elected legislators take office, which will occur on January 3 at noon. Consequently, we'll only be updating the site with special election results as they are finalized.

If the Trump Administration’s priority is the end of the ACA, regardless of consequences &amp; without any subsequent replacement legislation already passed, then it entirely reasonable to describe the President’s recent statement on pre-existing conditions as lies. /end
Which means that, regardless of what the President tweets, the Trump Administration would rather see the ACA go away entirely even if it takes protections for pre-existing conditions in the process. A legislative solution might subsequently be found, but it also it might not. 4/n
Texas v Azar has tacit support of the current administration &amp; you can tell because the administration has chosen not to defend the ACA against this suit.  Such support is consistent with Preaident Trump’s opposition to the ACA. 3/n

If such legislation actually existed, it would be possible to introduce it. However, no such tax cut legislation does exist. So, no introduction because no bill and even if there was one, there’d be no vote because everyone’s out campaigning. 2/n
Clarification on the plausibility of a tax cut bill in the near future: Congress is not meeting to do work this month, but they also aren’t in recess. Instead, they hold brief “pro forma” sessions to avoid formally recessing. Thus, bills have been introduced all month long. 1/n

@ldunn723 @RealSagacity @GayPatriot @jaker1419 @EsotericCD Hi. We looked at hundreds of thousands of votes over more than 100 years, so we of course had no way to apportion the population by actual sentiment on particular issues.
@sigetijem Hello. As our mission says, we take sides on issues that further our mission. Our post was therefore in line with our mission.
Before President Trump, the nomination confirmed by senators representing states with the smallest population was G.W. Bush's 2001 nomination of Ted Olson to be solicitor general: https://t.co/pErn5Azv61	Senators represented 44% of U.S. pop. Dems chose not to filibuster.
Another good question. The Dems ended the filibuster for non-SCOTUS nominations in 2013 and used slim majorities to confirm too. But the % of U.S. pop. in states represented by the majority never went below 53% from then until 2017. Here was the lowest: https://t.co/rHqFM6tF8M https://t.co/VvNnYCQCi1

One of our Facebook users asked, what about the ACA, which was also famously passed along party lines? 60 senators voted for it (all Ds/Is), and those senators represented states covering 65% of the country's population. Well over a majority.
@RealSagacity @jaker1419 @EsotericCD Thanks for the compliment! (Or are you saying official websites typically look like they're from the 90's and our design is also really bad?) Either way, please note that every page of our website says that we're not a government site.
@Kalani_Reed Since we looked at several hundred thousand votes over more than 100 years, we had no way to account for how individuals feel on any given issue.

The Constitution created the Senate as a check on the rule of the majority. There’s nothing inherently wrong when a minority group controls an outcome —that’s part of the American dream.		But we may have begun a new, sustained period of minority rule. (3/3?)
The Senate Republican majority represents a historically low proportion of the country’s population. Their 6-point advantage has never been used so much as in the last 21 months, we found in a new analysis of one hundred years of Senate votes: https://t.co/Eo0Fr2rVeg (2/n)
In yesterday’s vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh, the 50 senators voting yes represent states covering just 44% of the U.S. population or 143 million Americans. That’s less than a majority, less than the 181 million Americans represented by the senators voting no. (1/n)

With our site proving the possible, Congress recently passed a law to create the first official unified committee calendar too. More: https://t.co/ZGvazjt9lw	Kudos to Congress for moving forward with this transparency initiative.

@PiratePartyINT We'd still argue that, as phrased, this is still a logical fallacy because a) Raytheon is a publicly traded company in which U.S. people across the economic spectrum have a stake and not a person and b) not the sum total of the US billionaire class.
@Hackett_Graham1 GovTrack does not take a position on how pension funds are managed. We're noting that investment in the stock market can affect people at all income levels and pension funds were one example.
@LAFGolfer For the last 10 weeks, we've been picking statements by members of Congress to analyze rhetorical devices they use rather than the content. Other topics have included federal response to hurricanes and NFL police brutality protests. It varies based on what legislators discuss.
Moreover, Raytheon is a publicly traded company. It's entirely possible that lots of people wealthy or not, such as those whose institutional pension funds are invested in stocks would gain financially from increased U.S. arms sales. 3/3
If Sanders had said _Raytheon_ uniquely benefited from having one of its former lobbyists in an influential position, then that would be relevant and supported by the linked article. 2/3
Sanders implies that the presence of lobbyist in a policy position means that the billionaire class uniquely profits off of the deaths occurring in Yemen due to U.S. manufactured bombs. We think this is an irrelevant conclusion. 1/3 https://t.co/PF06GQS57n

The debt ceiling has always been a manufactured crisis and a wedge Republicans have used to keep control over federal spending. But with Rs overall now backing deficit spending and suspending the debt ceiling, maybe the era of the manufacture debt crisis will be over.
With the federal deficit now heading to surpass recession levels, the national debt will of course continue to grow. Just seven months ago "extraordinary measures" were invoked to avoid the US defaulting on its debt and the statutory debt ceiling was suspended until March '19.

Grassley asks Garry, friend of Kavanaugh, what’s good about about him. Garry says he’s a good listener. #Kavanaughconfirmation

This is clearly a losing battle, but “I move” is a more concise &amp; therefore better construction than “I make/made a motion” &amp; this grumpy GovTracker wishes people would use it. #pedantshakesfistatclouds

Interesting. Klobuchar asked about what, if anything, separated “settled law” &amp; “precedent” &amp; if either has anything to do w/which questions he answers. Kavanaugh mostly tried to deflect this too, but seems to have said the key was whether future cases seemed likely. +

Now we’re back to the putatively substantive portion of the hearing in which Kavanaugh - like nearly every other nominee in the last few decades - refuses to answer directly the vast majority of the questions.  #Kavanaughconfirmation
Finally, in what I assume was merely an attempt at reductio ad absurdum, Tillis suggests that if Dems are so keen on transparency,  then they should be happy to release all of the committee members’ emails unredacted on the #Kavanaughconfirmation
Also a thing that happened back in the day (duel happened too). In fact, Congress has so many rules about decorum because of, well, most of the late 18th &amp; 19th century.  Scroll to the bottom of https://t.co/eZ959kx8Ki &amp; work your way up. #Kavanaughconfirmation https://t.co/7BCRF6R0zL
Cornyn reads out Senate rule regarding sharing confidential information which I believe was used to censure Pickering in 1811: https://t.co/y1I1Q94Yi6 #Kavanaughconfirmation
Coons &amp; Feinstein too. Back to Booker now who says this is his “I am Spartacus” moment thus kind of ruining a lot of journalists’ jokes #Kavanaughconfirmation
Coons argues that the Presidential Records Act (PRA hereafter) means, contra Lee, that these records belong to the public &amp; that only National Archives staff can review. #Kavanaughconfirmation
Lee argues that if Dems are mad about the document review/labeling process, then they’re really mad at the Presidential Records Act. Until it’s changed, the Dems should back off. #Kavanaughconfirmation
*Kagan #darnyouautocorrect
@dolores_wagner Yes. This one I can blame on autocorrect.
So far Whitehouse, Durbin, Hirono, &amp; Klobuchar claiming solidarity with Booker with Hirono also planning to release docs in violation of rules. Not sure what this means in practice. Guess we’ll all find out. #Kavanaughconfirmation
Cornyn responds that a private attorney affiliated with Dems served in the same role during the Karan confirmation process. #Kavanaughconfirmation
Also at issue is the Dem claim that for this nominee all CC designations have been determined by a GOP-affiliated private attorney not on the Judiciary staff without any input from committee Dems.  #Kavanaughconfirmation
At issue (in part) is that committee confidential docs may not be used in hearings bcthen they’d have to make the documents public. Dems want all of the CC documents made public; GOP says case by case is only fair bc there’s sensitive information in them. #Kavanaughconfirmation
Lee argues the process is working &amp; bipartisan because he &amp; Booker worked together last night to get a particular document released. #Kavanaughconfirmation

Third: Presidents have no formal role in determining what Ethics Committees do or do not do. If they're of the same party, the chair might take informal direction from the President, but there's no reason why they would if the President is of a different party.
Second: House Ethics investigations happen or don't or go slow or go fast based on what that Congress's Ethics committee wants to have happen. The party that controls the house controls the Committee. The GOP has controlled the Ethics committee since at least the 112th Congress.

@Cozy1950 This is week 6 of Sunday Fallacy Friday; we’ve done 3 Republicans; 3 Democrats.
48% of you said it was misrepresentation which is correct. The CNN article says 41% of poll respondents want to see more documents and that just isn't representative of "most of the country". See you next week! https://t.co/yKYYK6abjH

Welcome to week 6 of Sunday Fallacy Friday. Sen. Murray (D-WA) tweeted that most of the country thinks "it's not too much to ask to see" Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh's full record before his confirmation hearings begin.	 https://t.co/X8AUwYRStj

Out of some 100,000,000 votes across the nation, @POTUS's DOJ has found not even two dozen, unrelated cases of voting by noncitizens. No conspiracy. And they have yet to go to trial, so it could be fewer.  Voter fraud is basically nonexistent in this country, thankfully. https://t.co/TmOKk5L74x

@Doverpost Sounds like it, but then another way to describe ad hominem is “consider the source”. Not sure if it says more about logic or people that perfectly good advice for social interactions is also often logically fallacious.
So, we think it's an appeal to consequences. Rep. Zeldin says that if everyone protested injustice, the end result would be bad because nothing else would get done, so these specific people shouldn't protest it in this circumstance. 5/5
It's also not a slippery slope fallacy because he's not claiming that since NFL players have done this one thing, now everyone else has started to as well. Instead, he speculates on what would happen if everyone did. 4/5
"Moralistic fallacy" sounds a lot like "moralizing", e.g. to make claims about what's right to do or not to do. You could argue that Rep. Zeldin is moralizing about the issue, but that's not a logical fallacy. 3/5
The moralistic fallacy is when you infer what is the case from what ought to be the case.  Clearly, Rep. Zeldin thinks NFL players shouldn't kneel - he says so - but he's not suggesting that they _aren't_ kneeling. 2/5
Belated follow up to this week's Fallacy Friday in which Rep. Zeldin said that if everyone took a knee over a cause, no one would ever be standing so NFL players shouldn't do it during the anthem. 61% said it was the moralistic fallacy. However, that's not it. 1/5

So, we're going to try this again, now just quoting the text of Rep. Zeldin's tweet in the hopes more people will be able to see the poll choices and respond to them on desktop or mobile devices.

@alexlyte Paul isn’t trying to explain Brennan’s reasoning. He says Brennan’s argument is bad because Brennan is bad so ad hominem.

@alexlyte We’re not taking a position on whether this is a good reason to discount Brennan just identifying the logical device in use. Plus, it is actually true. Brennan did vote that way.
@KitWinter It’s possible Paul meant it that way but the ad hominem reading seems more persuasive to us. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

It's also true! John Brennan did indeed vote for a Communist Party candidate for president in 1976. https://t.co/JOW6cyplRo Whether this is a _good_ argument against Brennan is a different question. Depending on one's perspective, it might be. But it's still ad hominem.
The poll has closed and as 57% you noted, it's ad hominem. This is rarer than people think because it's often confused with just saying something unkind. In fact, it's discounting someone's argument, not on its merits, but because of something they are/have/believe/etc.

Tweets like this one would count though. Rep. Adams has jumped to the conclusion that President Trump is acting directly on the orders of President Putin when Trump's behavior is so far so contradictory as to leave his motivations opaque. https://t.co/c8nGnhvHj3

If the congressional candidate mentioned in the special counsel indictment won the election, there's a sitting Member of Congress who Russia has had leverage over for the last two years. Were congressional votes coerced by the possibility of blackmail?

Gowdy’s questions to Strzok re S’s text mentioning impeachment are about - per Gowdy - the idea that Strzok was not interested in being part of Special Counsel’s team unless SC was going to recommend impeachment. At least I think that’s what I heard Gowdy say. #StrzokHearing

Goodlatte says that (during the break I guess) the FBI said Strzok could now answer Gowdy’s question about how many interviews he did in the first week of the 2016 investigation. Gowdy asks again, Strzok says “I don’t recall.” Gowdy asks incredulously “we waited for this?!”

Now there’s a discussion largely between Dem committee members about whether there’s any reason why the transcript of Strzok’s first hearing can’t be released in full. Nadler says not that he’s aware of; Goodlatte says yes, they agreed they would not. #StrzokHearing
@CaligulasReven1 No, he signed it. Given his remarks at the time, he didn’t want to do so, but presumably the administration felt the optics would be too negative if he did not. https://t.co/qmO0e38tcv
Well, not on work-supplied phones, no. https://t.co/MXKCXX5HdJ
And now we’re in a Surrealist interlude in which both Goodlatte &amp; Strzok discuss an obviously non-literal phrasing as if it was literal. https://t.co/t3fOAqLfRW
A pet peeve: Presidents _do not_ have to sign passed bills for them to become law as long as Congress remains in session. Congress rarely formally recesses anymore - that’s what all those pro forma sessions are about - and if Speaker Ryan doesn’t know this, he should. https://t.co/W20YMprnH7
@thekarmaqueen Chair Goodlatte said he would hold Strzok in contempt if Strzok didn’t answer Gowdy’s questions. I’m not sure if that’s still in force since Strzok did respond in _some_ way. This hearing is a trip!

@DDBFarm @_oversaturation He also claimed that he never pushed Republicans to support one of the proposals, but he was on the Hill a few days earlier telling them to vote for it, and he tweeted the same in all caps. (That might not be a lie either if deep down he believes he's feckless.)

Spirited debate between the branches of government is what keeps the American system of government at its best. The Founding Fathers were skilled trolls too --- look it up! https://t.co/sa8Cp5YJBR

@jackiekashian Hi. The information is standardized. You're just looking at different things. On Sander's page click the report card link. Or on your first link, click the link to go back to Warren's main profile page.
@AaronPrince18 There are things the courts can do without Congress, but for sure Congress should make judicial branch transparency a matter of law.
The executive and legislative branches have both completed major transparency initiatives recently (the DATA Act created massive new data on exec branch spending; bulk access to legislative data in Congress).		I'm not aware of any comparable judicial branch initiatives.
RT @derekwillis: On judicial nomination votes, Collins has not strayed from the GOP majority line in the 115th Congress &amp; did so just twice…
The most transparent branch is the judicial branch? That's the most laughable claim I've ever heard about transparency. Federal courts charge you to read their records by the page... even when its electronic and there are no pages! ~JT https://t.co/3YHEHdDW96
@hughhewitt So you supported a simple majority / up or down vote for Supreme Court nominees in 2016, or is that only if the President is in your party?
They also actually wrote down that they wanted the Senate to provide advice and consent for nominations, but Hugh is "100%" just winging it.	https://t.co/3mHDZDy3tW. https://t.co/Twem66oMTy
@BetsyRo14525 How is that relevant to what name we call ICE?
@miketay84627281 Do you care what the agency is called? Or where in the federal government the agency is organized?
@ComesDarkness @ICEgov If you support ICE now, you can probably imagine how important it was in 2002 to reorganize things to create it in the first place --- and so you might see how reorganizing it again could make it even better.
@miketay84627281 So you'd support going back to having a NIS instead?
@BetsyRo14525 Lots of people, including the President, have long been saying that much of immigration law needs to be changed. It's hard to find any American who thinks the laws are just fine as they are.
The White House, for example, recently put out a plan to merge the Departments of Education and Labor, literally abolishing two federal departments. That has consequences *even if* the new "Education Agency" in the merged department does the same thing as today's Department.
This is a good point but misses the fact that ICE as such didn't exist until the post-9/11 hysteria that led to the creation of the whole Department of Homeland Security. Reorganizing agencies and reassigning responsibilities, like when ICE was created, has consequences. https://t.co/MWWu6tHZR3
RT @ddale8: Did you know Procter &amp; Gamble makes Charmin at its factory in Mehoopany, Pennsylvania, which is represented by Republican Senat…
Fact check: ...		Also a stunning admission that POTUS had "captured" some House R's to vote yes (prior to "releasing" them). What kind of dealing is going on? What were they getting in exchange for their yes vote? https://t.co/BwBRJO66YO
Update: Nearly half of House Republicans voted it down https://t.co/rvU2YzEQyW, the Administration reversed its policy (for now), and a court has ordered families be kept together. Also due process remains in effect per the Constitution after the Admin. floated curtailing it. https://t.co/qhyHw1L867
