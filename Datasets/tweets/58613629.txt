@MikeVee_ @MolinariPG Not Fleury's fault. 4 periods of being the ONLY player does not win a series.
@dtrip20 @penguins Not his fault. 18 other players failed to show. He can't play the game by himself.

@PensInsideScoop Sad thing is people will blame Flower for blowing a 3-1 series lead. Not his fault. 18 others need to play to win.

@MolinariPG They line hasn't worked most of the season. Why try it now?
#Pens have no heart in this game. #Fleury needs other players to show up for him.
@penguins Can't win if you don't shoot! Keep it simple and play. It's not too much to ask. #Pens #Playoffs
@penguins Wake up #Pens! Take control. This is your house. Win this and give me something positive about my day.

@ChrisMorelli MAF was amazing,  but the biggest concern of the fans is Sid's health status
@DKPghSports Ovi caused the injury to Sid! His stick to the head is what knocked Sid off balance and into Matty. I don't blame Niskanen fully.
@MolinariPG Bad move
@penguins DO NOT PULL FLEURY!!!!!!!!!
@Satanclause1 @Real_RobRossi I thought the original review was for that. If It had been the case the goal would have stood
@Satanclause1 @Real_RobRossi 1st review to see if puck crossed line before net came off. Challenge was for interference. Sucks,  but correct call.
@MolinariPG Not a good sign
@Evo4Stevo @NBCSports @NHLonNBCSports Penalty should have been to Ovi. It was his stick  that took Sid down. NHL needs to stop coddling Ovi and suspend him. Very dirty player.
@Kennedy4848 More worried about Sid than the scoreboard.  Hope he's ok. Not the first time they've played without him, but it will get in their heads.

@penguins the less blocked shots the less likely to add to the injured list
@albhere @realDonaldTrump All of the above
@penguins 18 guys are paid to play the puck &amp; keep it away from our goalie. They have failed at this the last few games. Injuries no excuse
@penguins Someone please tell these guys that this wasn't supposed to be a 60 minute PK. No production and invisible defense. Poor Flower üòï
@PensInsideScoop OMG we're not being shutout
@penguins Sheary was no where near him
@penguins the 18 players in front of Flower need to play hockey and not have it be Chicago vs Fluery!

@YahooSportsNHL @Sean_Leahy so much for trade bait
@penguins Let's Go Pens
@Letgopens @DKPghSports @Dejan_Kovacevic @JoshYohe_PGH Fluery needs more play time.
@PensInsideScoop Murray is why we have such a high GA. Sully needs to play Flower more. He always gets us to the playoffs with a lower GA
@PensInsideScoop tired of everyone yelling to trade Fluery. If he actually got to play, he'd be good. Poor team effort doesn't help.
@bobgrove91 yet another reason it bothers me that Sully favors Murray over Flower. Fleury is the franchise goalie.

@PensJG @krisletangorg BS. Murray kicked it in. He's not as perfect as bandwagon fans think.
@mtnhomecare @PensInsideScoop Murray was out of position both times. He has been D support than Flower gets
@PensInsideScoop if that were Fleury in net the 4 Pens in the net would have been 200 ft away. They need to guard him as much as Murray!
@bobgrove91 #pens to bad his loss earlier in the week went to Fluery.
Our Democracy Has Gone Nuts. Can The Electors Fix It On Dec. 19? https://t.co/s0ZOQy9vuC
@penguins the team plays different in front of Murray. They protect him. They tend to leave Fluery out to dry. They use him as the defense.
