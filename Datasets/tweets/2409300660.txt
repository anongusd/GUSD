@VainandAble Therefore BLACK LIVES MATTER NOW AND THEN!
@VainandAble ........no matter your social standing. We will always look for acceptance. That's when you've lost.

@VainandAble Or of greatness without rebellion. As long as you go along you can get along. MLK has a holiday but Malcolm X never will....
@VainandAble History of POC is one of bondage and servitude in this culture. Greatness as a whole is replaced with gangsters and hoochies

@VainandAble Had someone reminded the people of the past terrible policies and corruption there would have been no way the republicans win.
@VainandAble Nah it's systematically done, Obama could have easily pointed the finger and reminded the American people, the media as well.
@VainandAble It does, just according on who it is faced with the issue. Lil George Bush is the perfect example.
@BrookingsInst Not at all because it's not a matter of strategy of war, it is a fight on principles and beliefs. U.S. should lead by example
@politico True Nigga, True Rebublican, we hate fags, we love to have children and we are the best entrepreneurs with little or nothing...

@ZulaQi @wizdom4you That goes for women and men. This brings on self destructive behavior and animosity. PTSD=civil rights struggles as well

@ZulaQi @wizdom4you Non educated black men speak from experience however, the conversation can't be held with non educate black women. Weird

So if ISIS is truly under the control of a "Khalifah" then these rules must apply or the entire objective will never be successful.
It is impermissible to strike a foreign land prior to establishing peace in the place of turmoil. An attack outside of the realm is unlikely
So when I see ISIS has beheaded someone, I automatically assume it's agents of another entity trying to distort the real intentions.
Prisoners of war are to be treated with equality of the participants of Jihad. No harsh treatment of prisoners is allowed.
3 things that are protected during Jihad. Non combatants of women, children and the destruction of property.
The reward is happiness beyond the present life of this world. Jihad carried out with bad intentions and incorrectly will not be accepted.
The truth about ISIS and jihad. In Islam jihad is a religious obligation just like Ramadan and the 5 daily prayers.

@roachman61 @toddstarnes What about others who thought differently but are never mentioned? You can choose whatever you want.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes Ive, seen it, lived it and witnessed it with my own two eyes.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes Watch what happens next in Chicago. It's the same thing that's happened in every Metro city across the country.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes White people live in make believe and fantasy worlds. In suburbs and books. You are far removed from reality.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes So are white kids the massacre numbers in schools, shopping malls and movie theaters.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes Look man this is your country not mine you have a right to believe or think as you choose.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes In the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! THAT'S TERRORISM!
@roachman61 @toddstarnes Michael Brown, Dante Parker, John Crawford and Eric Garner all killed by police in 1 week.
@roachman61 @toddstarnes You don't think the killing of 4 Black Men in a week is not terroristic?
@roachman61 @toddstarnes You don't think the actions by government aren't terroristic? They attacked people with dogs! The same police!
@roachman61 @toddstarnes Remember 9/11 and it didn't stop there. Please!
@roachman61 @toddstarnes If you are gonna die you might as well go down fighting...
@roachman61 @toddstarnes No and look what it got him ASSASSINATED!
@jaketapper @tanehisicoates This government harms.more Whites than any others, your freedoms and Constitution are vanishing quickly.
@jaketapper @tanehisicoates The same reason White people don't protest for White on White exploitation.
@okokokIgetit @denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly it's been nice chatting with you...
@okokokIgetit @denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly What power? It's the police that are afraid of unarmed Black Men, now that's POWER!
@okokokIgetit @denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly I'm not here to persuade you, as a matter of fact who actually cares what you think.
@okokokIgetit @denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly However it is typical of cowards to hide behind sheets, pillow cases and keyboards.
@okokokIgetit @denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly I'm wasting precious thought.just typing this reply.
@denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly Dante Parker, John Crawford, Eric Garner, Michael Brown and you say PEACEKEEPERS!
@denice_ruptly @RT_com @Ruptly There were 4 Black Men Massacred in 1 week and we have "peacekeepers"!
@ReporterFaith @USATODAY All are owned by foreigners, that sell alcohol, lotto and cigarettes. The food sucks!
@ReporterFaith @USATODAY Those stores rob black communities. They are twice as high and sell illegal paraphernalia.
@jorenzor @Yamiche @USATODAY So tell me who's really the thugs?
@jorenzor @Yamiche @USATODAY I don't profess to be a thug and DC police placed me on a wall and broke my ribs.
@Yamiche @zerohedge I should be there with ya....ENOUGH IS A DAMN NUFF!
@Yamiche @zerohedge Damn right! Eric Garner, Dante Parker, John Crawford, and Michael Brown. 4 Black Men in a WEEK!
Let's not forget Eric Garner http://t.co/XVvuPHW7Ip
Let's not forget John Crawford http://t.co/zAQEAyXvVI
Let's not forget Dante Parker http://t.co/LB6Lixc13B
@ciccmaher @YourAnonNews I apologize carrying*
@ciccmaher @YourAnonNews This has all just happened in a week! Please bring light for all of these victims....
@ciccmaher @YourAnonNews Blackman strangled for selling loose cigarettes, another killed in Walmart caring a toy gun!
@ciccmaher @YourAnonNews There were 2 or 3 more incidents that have take place. No mention! Victorville Ca. Blackman dead.
@niclott @blackrepublican CONVICTIONS! Felons can't vote. Duh! POLICE BRUTALITY! Are you following along!
@carolmswain @blackrepublican They have no AC and won't let you slide with a penny. It's just FRUSTRATION! Bad  products, lots of alcohol!
@carolmswain @blackrepublican When is the last time you've been in a store in the hood. It's owned by foreigners. Prices are high as hell.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican @KevinNR Of course you would, you've enjoyed the product of exploitation.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Property values increase services are better and Blacks are now dispersed.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican And are now paying pennies on the dollar for the property. Case in point Detroit, D.C. and Philly.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Yes the Black Middle Class fronted the load. Now they want the cities back.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican However the services got worse except in the suburban areas.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican It had nothing to do with taxes, the inner cities pays the higher taxes after white flight.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Suddenly the schools and public services were better in the "burbs" than in the cities. Try again!
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Let's not forget how at that time White took flight to the suburbs, taking all the tax dollars.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Let's not forget how the Black Middle class thrived for years because of the manufacturing prosperity.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Civil Rights leaders and progressive organizations have been the target of this government.
@MJosephSheppard @blackrepublican Only some book read White Man believes this stuff. You play statistical games and practice amnesia.
@blackrepublican People care more for their animals than a human being! Just ask Michael Vick.
@blackrepublican This story would have made headlines if the cop shot someone's dog. The only difference is the people are able to protest.
@blackrepublican Must be the Orange County California Chapter!
It is the very reason every police department across this country is equipped to massacre anyone, White or Black that steps out of line.
Those in charge know what is really happening. Just like these last few events, the system fears the day of a total revolution.
Orange County California has no Black Middle Class. It's population is 3 million, you find no Blacks working nowhere almost.
@StateDept Smart on the part of Northern Sudan, don't here much about rebel violence there. Way to Go South Sudan!
@Ameri_Canadian @MMFlint Hire police that reflect the community, not outsiders who think they are prison guards with guns.
@widowmaker2007 @brownbomber @blackrepublican It has just wasn't called socialism. Actually for quite a while.

@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican I don't need to be entertained, I need a job! Comedians, athletes, rappers and movie stars.
@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican So ask Oprah and all these professional folks to invest in  Black communities.
@widowmaker2007 @brownbomber @blackrepublican You could give every American 10k and still wouldn't have a deficit as high as today.
@widowmaker2007 @brownbomber @blackrepublican that's the problem, most look down for the solution when the problem comes from above.
@widowmaker2007 @brownbomber @blackrepublican I  agree if I didn't have to make room for the illegals. We reward them for breaking the law
@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican And reganomics is part of this socialists change?
@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican Honestly, change is difficult and comes with a hefty price. Too many "l's" nowadays no more Us
@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican Let's first start with Corporate welfare then work our way down....
@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican I can't imagine what's in store for your generation and you future offspring.
@brownbomber @widowmaker2007 @blackrepublican Young man I've been on this earth 46 years and have traveled and worked coast to coast.
@brownbomber @dreamaboutmeK @blackrepublican Most of those degrees help in small companies and communities. Your connection reply is dead on
@widowmaker2007 @brownbomber @blackrepublican And which planet did you say you just flew in from?
@dreamaboutmeK One obvious thing still remains, we are not God, so just be prepared.
@dreamaboutmeK Good for you my Sister, good luck to ya.
@dreamaboutmeK @brownbomber Spoken like a true republican. I, emphasis on the "l" did it.
@brownbomber @dreamaboutmeK @blackrepublican Tech schools? How much does it cost and what's the average salary upon completion? SMH!
@dreamaboutmeK @brownbomber @blackrepublican Have you actually had to go to school through a metal detector? Let's be realistic.
@brownbomber @dreamaboutmeK @blackrepublican Maybe it's do to the lack of opportunity and fare wages.
@Ameri_Canadian @MMFlint it can be compared to the Egyptian uprising. When enough is enough, people will sacrifice their lives.
@Ameri_Canadian @MMFlint That's because you haven't felt it to the extent of feeling helpless, hopeless and fed up. It's an everyday thing.
@Hotflashes10 @blackrepublican I'm a blk male lost my job in OC Cali. Guess what? I was a minority in the welfare line.
@AP Why are they compensated for breaking the law? Does the term "illegal" mean anything?
@Forbes In a nutshell....stop being such a prick!
@Heritage Just ask Halliburton and Dick Cheney.
@Heritage They shouldn't have never been there from the start. NO WMD's and No involvement with 9/11. Plenty of oil.
@BUBBAHILLBILLY1 @MMFlint You should visit Orange County California, "Welfarepets" SMH! AND LMAO!
@Ameri_Canadian @MMFlint Until you understand how harassment really feels, you won't understand when enough is enough.

@truthout @MikeElk today it seems that all that matters are pensions and pay raises. What about protecting the individual worker.

@OccupyWallSt @nytimes @NRA Unfortunately the NRA has nothing to do with PTSD military installations and military weaponry. Wrong drum!
@AllenWest It is always convenient to make talking points when your looking from the other side of a two way mirror.
@AllenWest How Morsi is expelled. Hundreds sentenced to death and Mahmood Abbas is still looked upon as the spokesperson for Palestine.
@AllenWest Let's see you post about the sexual assaults, or unreported abuse in conflict regions. The inability to back elected officials.
@AllenWest You don't. So far from the truth. Your position is as a career military person, but as a humanitarian you may need a little help.

@WayneDupreeShow I think she had a valid point management don't build planes. Design them, fly or sell them. So if they left who'd notice?
@WayneDupreeShow She says let the company leave the building and the workers will still remain. Therefore the workers run the company.
@WayneDupreeShow I did hear a very unique idea coming from a young lady in Seattle when Boeing threatened to leave during a strike.
@FranklinCenter @WayneDupreeShow Once again where ever there's a union involved you can best believe unemployment is considerably high.
@WayneDupreeShow No matter how hard they try conservatives are assimilated with Bible thumping racists.
@WayneDupreeShow The recent government shutdown, same scenario. Extreme right wing conservatives determined against the left wing Obama Admn
@WayneDupreeShow Left wing extremists were MLK and John F. Kennedy. Majority Black families had pictures hanging in their living rooms.
@WayneDupreeShow Why are extreme right wing fanatics mostly consist of religious zealots and separatists?
@dianabald yes I am I'm in La Mirada. I actually have my camping gear packed and ready at the door.

@Sarah_Santorum @WayneDupreeShow It goes against what you believe so millions of others should avoid it instead of deciding for themselves,
@WayneDupreeShow Religion is protected under the Constitution until it opposes certain individuals. That's the purpose for the amendment.
@WayneDupreeShow It's ironic The Constitution separates church and state, however, religious issues become political.
@SteveScalise @WayneDupreeShow @RepWalorski Oh yeah and a decent health care plan.

@_wallabeeCLARKE No wonder the Black Community is considerably getting worse, but it's leaders continue to get richer by the minute.
@_wallabeeCLARKE Where are all your so called "Civil Rights" leaders today. Taking bribes and making illegitimate babies.
@VP_Renewsit @GOPBlackChick @_wallabeeCLARKE @ericgrimey She's not she's just giving an alternative to what's been crammed down your throat.
@VP_Renewsit @GOPBlackChick @_wallabeeCLARKE @ericgrimey They would have adopted the ideology of the disenfranchised.
@VP_Renewsit @GOPBlackChick @_wallabeeCLARKE @ericgrimey So if there was a White Civil Rights leader he or she would be Black Washed.
@VP_Renewsit @GOPBlackChick @_wallabeeCLARKE @ericgrimey That would be true. Civil rights are for disenfranchised against a white majority
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick The Grand "OLD" Party is just that to OLD for change..Guess it's true can't teach an old dog new tricks. Shoot it
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick Today conservative=profit over people. Turn that to people=profit and savings. You've got your winning solution.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick It's time for conservatives to start putting their money where their mouth is, less complaining and more action.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick Conservative truly focused on the needs of the people the world could be their oyster! Saviors of the universe.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick That's why minorities are afraid of conservative ideas, they seem to be the ones that are getting left out.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick The conservative idea of privatization isn't the problem, it's the unfair balance of services that's the problem
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick Privatize trash collection equally throughout the municipalities. Privatize policemen more cops where needed.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick That eliminates the tax burden on the wealthy to support broken public school systems.Everyone must do their part
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick Conservatives privatize education, concentrated on quality; than shareholder dividends. No more public education
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick That would be wonderful if everyone started with the same resources and opportunities. We must be more realistic.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick Unfortunately it goes back to the 1% rule. If you can afford a better life you get a better life.
@joemonroe5 @GOPBlackChick Modify the welfare system. Provide All US CITIZENS with decent education, public services and employment. .
@WayneDupreeShow @FeministaJones Learned attending an HBC Black History class. Might wanna look into it before you get to far off track.
@WayneDupreeShow @FeministaJones The republican and democratic parties made major transitions, just can't remember during the period.
@WayneDupreeShow @FeministaJones Actually, look back in history, Lincoln was a republican. There was a political shift.
@JoannMuller @Forbes That's why it's called re-gentrification.
@JoannMuller @Forbes If the property value hasn't sky rocketed. You will never find it. Services are always poor until everyone is moved out
@WayneDupreeShow If you looked at the unemployment rate of the districts of the RMSP members you will find the highest rates in the country.
@WayneDupreeShow Labor Unions impose restrictions and fees on certifications and licenses making it difficult for most people to work.
@WayneDupreeShow Any political entity associated with Labor Unions have simply strangled a large portion of the labor market.
@WayneDupreeShow You think conservatives are exclusionary, try dealing with a Labor Union. It's lost sight of it's primary purpose.
@larryelder More interest payments to bankers and debt, where as interest payments in ND is considered profit and capital for loans.
@larryelder Something the Feds should learn, however, they are clung to the breast of the Federal Reserve.

@WayneDupreeShow There is a conservative group amongst others that doesn't fit the GOP's structure anymore. The NPP (New Progressive Party)

@WayneDupreeShow Afghanistan prior to the US invasion had eradicated it's poppy production almost entirely. It's returned to be the #1 crop

@GOPBlackChick Please suggest something, I don't think I can stomach the likes of a Dr. Claude Anderson. The new ghetto superstar!

@DearWhitePeople An idea for your next film "The Price of Your Soul, What's it Worth to Ya'..."
@DearWhitePeople Do you think there are more people in the world that share the views of the "militant" sister that are never heard?
@DearWhitePeople  Does that play a part of the stereotypical view or successful black men?
@DearWhitePeople I watched the interview with Amy Goodman and the actor says "I don't live that life". Referring to being militant.
@DearWhitePeople Do you think the success of the film is do to the stereotype that (gay) black men are non threatening.
