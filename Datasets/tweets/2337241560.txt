We need to move beyond the mindset that the gas tax is the end-all-be-all to fixing our #infrastructure. We need an all-of-the-above approach to create jobs, boost productivity, increase safety and work for all Ohioans. Read my op-ed in the @toledonews https://t.co/se1UCYzOlg

Whether a user fee, or another solution, there are many options to pay for roads and bridges. Let's take our time, review all options and do this right. https://t.co/JpwzCHkPAY

The Senate left this morning thinking they were heading home for the Christmas after jamming the house with a clean CR.  McConnell now is asking them to come back.  Question is will they remove the wall funding and send it back?  The American people need to watch and remember.
Glad to hear the President will not sign the spending bill passed by the Senate last night.  It's about time he forced Congress to do their job.  This isn't about shutting down the government.  75% funded thru Sept.  It's about a Congress that just kicks the can down the road.
Over the last month I have commented on radio and TV that Congress will drag out this wall showdown until Christmas and at the end pass a short term CR and kick it into February or March. Watch my prediction come true this week.  I support the wall funding but not CR's.

I will work to make Ohio &amp; Ohioans first. I came here 34 years ago and this great state gave me the opportunity to live the American dream -- making me the only qualified candidate to provide that dream to our children and grandchildren. #OhioFirst #OHSenDebate
Sherrod Brown talks a big game about his opposition of Wall Street &amp; the financial system - but over the last two years, Sherrod Brown accepted nearly half a million dollars from big banks and insurance companies, the same ones providing those student loans he protests so much.
.@PolitiFact has said “most taxpayers are projected to enjoy lower federal taxes through 2025” because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. @PolitiFact also said “those most likely to see their taxes go up include wealthy wage earners in high-tax states and cities.”

I'm a CPA, so I understand the specifics of the tax law I helped craft. Before our tax cuts bill, companies that moved jobs overseas were paying 0% US tax after planning. Now, thanks to a new provision, they’re paying 10.5%. Revenue that was not getting taxed under the old law.
The Ohio Farm Bureau supported the free trade agreements with South Korea, Columbia and Panama. Which Brown opposed all three agreements, once again voting against Ohio farmers.
The President is a savvy negotiator and that is why he was elected... to fight for the best deal for the Ohio worker. We need free and fair trade and I support the President's fight to get us that.
Let's not forget that doubling the child tax credit amounted to a $573.4 billion tax cut for working families.... and Brown voted against it.
Sherrod Brown says expanding the Child Tax Credit was a priority of his proposal. The Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act DOUBLED the Child Tax Credit for millions of parents across the country and yet Brown voted against it. https://t.co/wwYbY3O586
Economic growth in the second quarter of 2018 was 4.2% —under President Obama, annual growth averaged 1.9%. I will continue to work with this President to grow our economy for ALL Ohioans. #OHSenDebate
After the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act was passed, CBO predicted that revenues for the fed government would be $3.3 trillion. This year, revenue was 3.3 trillion— the most revenue ever collected. Economic growth means more revenue. #OHSenDebate
Brown said women who come forward about past abuse are 'brave' and that their 'story matters.' He even called on Sen Franken to resign when allegations of sexual assault against him were brought to light. But I guess these sentiments don't apply when Brown's the one being accused
.@SherrodBrown you take a back to seat to no one? Then I want to know who is driving that car! #OHSenDebate
Listen, you can have coverage for pre-existing conditions AND replace Obamacare with a system that actually creates affordable, accessible care and that won't bankrupt Ohio families. #OHSenDebate
And just last Congress, I co-sponsored a resolution to ensure protections for those with pre-existing conditions https://t.co/JoN5eCM8uU #OHSenDebate
As a cancer survivor, I understand first hand the importance of needing to cover these individuals &amp; what we need to do is make sure they can get access to affordable coverage. In 14 I signed a letter to Obama stressing the need for coverage for people w/ pre-existing conditions.
I came from the business world where it doesn't matter what party you are from. All that matters is that you come together to solve the problem. My opponent only knows a life in politics, which is working for the next election, not the next generation. #OHSenDebate #OHSen

Another very clear choice, someone with no experience in the workforce &amp; only collects a taxpayer funded paycheck. OR someone who has created over 1,500 &amp; employeed over 3,000 people across our state with the real world experience to put Ohio first. #OHSenDebate #OHSen
Americans want to work.  We don’t have to incentivize them.  They’re some of the hardest working people in the world.  What we have to do is make our economy strong &amp; competitive, which tax reform did, so companies want to do business here. That’s what creates jobs. #OHSenDebate
The U.S. used to have one of the highest tax rates in the world.  Now, thanks to tax reform, the U.S. is competitive and that’s what keeps jobs in the U.S.
What’s more, the new 21% corporate rate makes keeping jobs in the U.S. much more attractive now. It’s 13% more expensive in France, 9 % more in Australia and Portugal, 8% in Belgium, 3% more in Korea and Spain.
He’s assuming that 10.5% is 50% off of the new corporate rate but in fact, it is a new provision to ensure fairer taxation &amp; allow the U.S. to tax those who were not paying taxes at all through international loopholes.
Now, thanks to a new provision, they’re paying 10.5%.  That’s revenue that was not getting taxed under the old law. https://t.co/29zwh3cjZk #OHSenDebate #OHSen
It's frustrating to hear someone with no TAX background talking about the 50% off coupon for companies that move jobs overseas. That’s just not true. Before the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, companies that moved jobs overseas were paying 0% U.S. tax after planning.
I went to Washington because the Federal Government took away my business and I wanted to make sure that didn't happen to others, you went to Washington to get a job. https://t.co/29zwh3cjZk #OHSenDebate #OHSen
In 1997, @SherrodBrown said “Voters support term limits because they want to get rid of the people who have been here for 20 or 30 years.” https://t.co/29zwh3cjZk #OHSenDebate #OHSen
In the business world, when there is a problem you either fix it or you fail. In Washington, career politicians like @SenSherrodBrown have created a system that perpetuates problems, &amp; creates go-nowhere gimmicks w/ the next election in mind. #OHSenDebate #OHSen
That’s revenue that was not getting taxed under the old law &amp; according to the nonpartisan, Joint Tax Committee, analysis estimates that Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) will bring in $112.4 billion dollars in new revenue between now and 2027.
Remember, before Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, companies that moved jobs overseas were paying 0 percent U.S. tax after planning. Now thanks to a new provision, they’re paying 10.5 percent.
Regardless of your views on immigration reform, we should all be in agrmt that those who are in our country illegally &amp; are among the worst criminal offenders shouldn’t be free to place others in harm’s way. My opponent supports sanctuary cities which threatens our safety.
I don’t think it’s ever right for a man to put his hands on a woman.  No matter what party you’re from, if you put your hands on a woman, I believe you are disqualified from serving in the Senate because of the standard that it sets. #OHSenDebate #OHSen
I'm not scared to work to solve our mental health &amp; gun control issues. This is something my bipartisan working group has worked on relentlessly to find common ground within our Consitution. Unlike my opponent, I won't let leadership stop me from doing what is right for Ohio.
Ha! Now, my opponent loves lobbyists more than Ohio. Thanks for that reminder. https://t.co/3Md4ZmGtS0 #OHSenDebate #OHSen
@AndrewJTobias And let's not forget, in 2014, I sent a letter to President Obama with ideas to improve healthcare, which included “guaranteeing people with pre-existing conditions affordable coverage.
@AndrewJTobias I voted for legislation that would prevent insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. I co-sponsored a bill that would prevent insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.

Sen Brown talks a big game about his opposition of Wall Street &amp; the financial system - but over the last two years, he has accepted nearly half a million dollars from big banks &amp; insurance companies, the same ones providing those student loans he protests so much. #OHSenDebate
I was the son of a railroad worker, I worked 3 jobs to get through college, I understand student debt and as someone who spent 30 plus years in the business world I understand dollars and will find real solutions to keep these debts from ballooning out of control.
Remember, I was ranked in the top 14% for bipartisan in the House. The Lugar Center named @SherrodBrown as less bipartisan than @HillaryClinton &amp; Barack Obama were when they were in the Sen. He was ranked in the bottom 38% for bipartisanship &amp; is ranked the 4th most liberal Sen.
I created a Bipartisan Working Group. We meet every week Congress is in session, because THAT is how you get things done in DC. Our problems are not Republican or Democrat, they are American problems &amp; coming from the business world I know how to work together to get things done.
I voted and helped craft a tax bill that is providing more $$ in Ohioans paychecks (most Ohioans will get a tax cut of nearly $2,000) which also allows small &amp; large businesses to expand and reinvest in their employees.... my opponent voted to halt that growth #OHSenDebate https://t.co/r334YGRfAD

Judge Kavanaugh is a thoughtful, experienced jurist who will make an excellent Supreme Court Justice. Once again, Sherrod Brown is proving he's completely out of touch with Ohioans and far too liberal to represent Ohio in the Senate. #OHSen
After voting for 100 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees, Brown is now putting party loyalty ahead of doing what's right.
No one is surprised that one of the most liberal senators who votes in lock step with Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer would vote against yet another of President Trump's Supreme Court justices.

Brett Kavanaugh is a thoughtful jurist with a proven respect for the Constitution and with extensive experience as a federal appeals judge.

Ohioans are tired of ineffective career politicians like Brown lying to them in order to remain in office. As I told Bob today, I think Ohioans want someone who will challenge overreach by the gov. and fight for them in Ohio - just like I did in this case.	https://t.co/hn00wQie1n
After challenging this in the courts, the OH Supreme Court ruled unanimously that I acted properly in pursuing this appeal &amp; withholding my tax payments while I challenged the retroactive tax. The Court then ordered the State of OH to refund me nearly $360,000 in penalties &amp; fees
Here are the facts: As a Certified Public Accountant and taxpayer, I was proud to stand with over 1,000 other Ohioans over a decade ago in appealing an attempt by the new tax commissioner to impose a retroactive tax on Ohio taxpayers.
This morning I joined Bob Frantz and he asked me about the false attack Sherrod Brown has leveled against me in some of his ads and gave me the opportunity to set the record straight.
Great being in Wayne County this evening! Thanks for your support! #OHSen https://t.co/oghX3awMnF
Saddened to hear about the tragedy in Annapolis this afternoon. The victims and their families are in our prayers.
Brown argues that tax cuts don't help American families.		But, American businesses that were overseas are returning home because of tax cuts. Their funds coming back into the US can be used for hiring, boosting wages, and helping American workers. https://t.co/Itk69BYaK6
Ineffective career politician Brown continues to call tax cuts a 'scam.'		Yet, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported ~ $305.6 billion returned to US from overseas accounts, equaling a $1.2 trillion annual rate, far more than the $35B one year prior. https://t.co/UX83eV8rzm

As Ohioans know, last year Sherrod Brown immediately bowed to Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren and opposed Neil Gorsuch moments after the President announced his nomination.
I want to thank Justice Kennedy for his service to our nation and congratulate him on his retirement. I am pleased to see President Trump has the opportunity to place another highly qualified judge on the Supreme Court like Neil Gorsuch.

@aetiology As I've said, we need major education reforms that prepare students for a 21st century economy. Four-year college and its costs are not the answer for every student &amp; simply throwing money @ schools to promote test scores instead of skill sets is a failed model &amp; isn't working.
@Curlyprinmom I've held over 100 town halls and public forums across the 16th District during my time in Congress. I'm sorry to hear that you've missed all of them.
@wsilverado Just like @POTUS, I strongly support &amp; defend all of our constitutional rights, including the First Amendment.  And unlike my opponent @MikeDeWine, who has an F rating from the @NRA, I also strongly support the Second Amendment &amp; am proud of my @NRA A rating.
