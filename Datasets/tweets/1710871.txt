@taykendesign @GA Happy to do so. I’m a fan of taking part in all kinds of discourse!
@taykendesign @GA Fair. I think job #1 for creating #AltEd is to Know Your History. In order to create a compelling alternative, you should know what has been tried and what has been learned. So many of those conversations start from scratch and assume all “innovative” ideas are new ones.
@taykendesign @GA I feel like that is what you are doing, but maybe I’m reading it wrong. I believe there is something to learn in every environment, even if it is only how to “not do” something.
@taykendesign @GA Hmm… lots to learn from privilege. Probably just not what they are trying to teach you.
@taykendesign @GA Are you looking to connect with folks or something else in that space?

@GoogleGuacamole Very cool! Thanks again for including me.
@GoogleGuacamole I’m super excited to learn more about how you have set this up. So many of our Canvas uses are incredibly old-school, and anything that helps to get rid of the “module 1” followed by “module 2” (read, PPTs) expectation, is a great opportunity!
@GoogleGuacamole @bethanyvsmith @whitneykilgore You rock! Thank you so much for being so open with your work. #eli2019 		Also, I was digging back through some of your tweets, I really appreciate your push back on the keynote (among other things). I think it helps everyone move forward!
@GoogleGuacamole Do you have a public-facing resource on your Digital Escape rooms within Canvas? I’d love to learn more!

@davecormier I was playing around a bunch with this yesterday and I think all generations will be able to recognize the pitfalls and potential behind such technology. No more need to steal real photos to mock up a prototype. And yet, knowing if you have a real person or a bot, will be harder.

@bdharnke Exactly! Life should imitate art in this case.
@bdharnke I’m in. Here you go… hey, wait a minute!
@SnySciCHS @torchapp @LumaTouch @emulsioapp Ha! I think they take all different kinds of folks. Not just folks who obsess about #RealWorkOniPad
@marnixst360 @torchapp Agreed, and if you ask really nicely, they let you open them early. ;)
I had so much fun with this project, and @torchapp is the perfect app for making things in AR. I can’t wait to build more with Torch! #ade2019 https://t.co/YlYSGvcBzD
@torchapp @marnixst360 I found the tracked image to be incredibly helpful for making sure that each scene was anchored to a particular location in the building. With only the original project anchor, the further I got away from the start, the more things can drift. It is a simple and elegant solution!
Did you know that Netflix allows for Educational Screenings of its Documentaries? I didn’t. Although, according to copyright law, teachers can do this with pretty much any movie or video that is integral to instruction within a f2f class. https://t.co/xJ7z1lKNl6 https://t.co/LK4Acai6kw

@BrennanHatton @Equal_Reality I’ll definitely send you an email soon.
@dogtrax Yes. It worked extremely well.
@BrennanHatton @Equal_Reality Only when looking at the mirror in the initial interface. Nothing else is “doubled.” I’m using HP Windows Mixed Reality headset, which works well with all other elements.
@BrennanHatton @Equal_Reality Oh, and yes. I did try multiple times. Same results.
@BrennanHatton @Equal_Reality I’m running the equal reality beta from viveport. I’d love to try a different one, but I didn’t see any others that were offered online.
@BrennanHatton @Equal_Reality You have to close one eye to see the image correctly. If you have both eyes open, you see an overlap of two different images of the same “person”. Does that make sense? It hurts my eyes to look at it, so I choose the experience right away to avoid this.
@Equal_Reality I just tried your application and I like it a bunch. I did notice, however, that when you are looking at yourself in the mirror, the face is shown in "double vision." When you choose an experience, though, all of the other people are not "doubled" Why is this?

By far, the best band I have heard in a really long time is “The Beths”, which for some reason, are @LizstokedStokes on Twitter. Seriously, listen to them.
I feel super special that @hankgreen liked one of my tweets. I know it won’t rank on @deletethispod, but I’m excited nonetheless. #piples
So excited to be seeing @hankgreen /w my 11 yr old daughter on Oct. 2 at Littleton HS to celebrate “An Absolutely Remarkable thing” (available for preorder now). Sure hope we get to meet him as a part of the first 100 tickets! Thanks to @TatteredCover! https://t.co/NeepD8YCkb
I’m learning from Diana Lautenberger of @AAMCtoday on “Unconcious Bias and Busting Myths about Women in the Workplace” at @CUAnschutz. Such an essential topic on our campus, and for our wider working society. 		Looking to dig into my own biases &amp; ways that I can be a better ally. https://t.co/TyYcjyIBTP
I’m at an Imagine Dragons concert in Albuquerque with my son, who just turned 10. It is his first concert ever and it is a great one. 		However, I just realized that Imagine Dragons is “secular praise music”. 		Those who grew up in a “Youth Group” will know exactly what I mean. https://t.co/QXMzfRfarI
I have always loved this Cat Stevens song. And this cover is ridiculously good. https://t.co/ZLFcmr4H9B
@MrNeibauer @CUDenverAlumni I certainly hope so! Looking forward to learning and leading alongside some amazing folks.
Sometimes there is a community of people just waiting for you to join. Sometimes you have to make your own. Sometimes the community you once joined or created is no longer yours. Knowing the difference between these opportunities is the hard part. #NewJobRealizations
Anyone have experience with distributing iBooks to student devices using JAMF/Casper? I’d love to talk with someone who has done this before.
I’m currently doing a semi-annual twitter “following” purge, in which I unfollow EVERYONE. So, don’t be surprised if it looks like I’m following you for the first time later today (or in a week or two when I realize there are missing voices in my feed). #TooMuchNoise
Getting ready for orientation at @CUAnschutz. Lots to learn about this new place. 		And, the slightly later start time also provided me the opportunity to bike around the beautiful campus. I wonder if there is an art guide somewhere… https://t.co/HNcYB3caeL
I just realized this morning that I’ve been using the same bike lock for more than 15 years. 		Is it weird to have an emotional attachment to a bike lock?
This feels important. 		“The Last Laugh” on Netflix	https://t.co/WwC1BBtqm1		Thank you, Ferne Pearlstein and crew. Truly great work.

My youngest son loves rainbows, unicorns, and playing with trucks. My middle son can’t handle any loss of control. My oldest daughter never stops reading (except to play Minecraft). 		They each need different things to learn, none of which are labels. 		#NoLabelsEdu
I have decided it is never a mistake to tell others how you genuinely feel. Especially, if those feelings are of gratitude, love, or thanks. 		It is entirely possible that you will never get another chance to say those words. 		#NoLabelsEdu
There are, of course, some songs that make a larger impact than @LosCampesinos’ “A Litany”, but I’m sure not aware of them. https://t.co/dTqCT28FIc
I am trying out a new email app called Maily McMailFace. Seriously. It is kind of awesome, actually. https://t.co/b3vzaxpMt6 https://t.co/1kyNXiBOBU
And @johngreen does it again with helping us to understand “the water we are swimming in” and why we should be skeptical of wise older fish.  https://t.co/GaXGPBg7QB
The in-between space between established labels is also much harder. 		The gap between Student and Employee is artificial. 		The gap between Novice and Expert is fictional. 		The gap between User and Creator is long gone. 		Learner. That’s it.		Labels hold us back. #NoLabelsEdu
There is sweet solidarity in labeling myself a Teacher, English Teacher, or Middle School English Teacher. But, it also separates us from anyone who isn’t those things. I can learn from CTE or Industry professionals. I just need to make my circle wider. #NoLabelsEdu
We don’t learn from labels. We learn from individuals. 		I don’t learn from #EdTech or #PersonalizedLearning or #GrowthMindset. 		I learn from @MatteaGarcia or @TyrnaD or @CarryOnEDU or @kmriebau or @chrislehmann or @gimmym or…		They are learners, with me. 		#NoLabelsEdu
The “Hashtagification” of learning has made it easier to follow conversations at #ISTE18 or on #GoogleEdu, but it also limits who can join in on the conversation, including those who might need them most. How can we show up as our whole selves and be inclusive? #NoLabelsEdu
It is clear that #highered learners need different things than those of elementary school students, but the label distinction of both learners means that any successful innovations happening in one space are not likely to transfer to other spaces. #NoLabelsEdu
Grade levels are only useful in their ability to describe large categories of learners. They are far less beneficial to the actual learner. What does “being a 3rd grader” mean when it (should) look different for each kid? #NoLabelsEdu
Labels like #GenZ make it seem we are incapable of understanding those who are younger. Like their existence is incompatible with our own. Like we must solve for a new species of learner, rather than making systems and environments that work for each individual. #NoLabelsEdu
If I make things, I’m a maker. If I think things, I’m a thinker. If I learn things, I’m a learner.		I’m not sure I need many more labels than that. #NoLabelsEdu

@l_vijay @hypervisible Even though your statement was rhetorical, I don’t think your broader point should be. Can we be literate without considering our privacy?
@mattrich0722 The pressure is from all sides too. Even if I don’t pressure my kids for grades and tasks, they still get it from others.
@hypervisible Exactly. The “kids these days” rhetoric is a tired trope. Same thing was said about baby boomers, and gen x.

@_connectedfm @imyke I hope that all makes sense. What do you think?
@_connectedfm @imyke So by merging the lock screen and Notification Center, iOS 11 is stating that there is little difference between a locked an unlocked device
@_connectedfm @imyke This would mean that essentially the lock screen is no something that needs to be dismissed because touching the screen is enough.
@_connectedfm @imyke If there is no home button on the new phone (the whole screen is Touch ID), a 3D Touch could both unlock the phone and Open a notification.
@_connectedfm @imyke Like you said, there must be a hardware component with the new iPhone. I believe the key is likely the screen.
@_connectedfm @imyke I may have figured out why the “lock screen” and Notification Center are the same in iOS 11.

@CaseyParksIt whoa. Definitely don’t want that. Wish I could see it both ways. These words mean a lot to me, but clearly don’t outside Ed.
@CaseyParksIt so interesting to me that you look at that and see something awful. Clearly there is a divide here. I hope we can bridge it.
@CaseyParksIt thank you. Always good to hear other viewpoints.
@CaseyParksIt totally agree. Do you think different kids need different things to get there or no?
@CaseyParksIt very interesting. It has value for me, but clearly not for all.
@CaseyParksIt what are the useless phrases do you see? Again, just trying to understand.

@jon_rogers @cinehead amen to that.
@cinehead greater than? How so? Video and audio are still far less searchable and hyperlink-able than text. Cc @jon_rogers
Google Sheets now lets you visually know which sheets are tied to a Google Form. Very nice touch! https://t.co/vv3SQUT82t
@ScrnsvrNinja seems very early Web 2.0, but anything that brings back the functionality will be welcome.
Last chance to vote for your favorite #InnEdCO17 sessions: https://t.co/sW2a7Ax7Rv. The form closes tonight!
@mweinraub87 put it on 2x speed and you should be fine. ;) @aurorak12
@audreywatters that’s awesome! Sorry for jumping ahead. Your last newsletter got me thinking I need to dig deeper.
@audreywatters Do you, by chance, have that research collected somewhere/have a good starting point so I can go down a rabbit hole. Thx!
@audreywatters Hey. I was looking on @hackeducation and in back issues of the newsletter for research on EdTech leading to worse outcomes.

@wfryer I had to significantly tweak what force touch does. I didn’t like that it did the “look up”. With BetterTouchTool, you can modify it
@wfryer I just know that this machine is going to be the inspiration for many other computing devices afterwards, and I like that idea.
@wfryer Additionally, it is more expensive than I would like and is impractical as an everyday teacher/student device.
@wfryer With all that said, I have had mine for less than a week. I will surely find things I don’t like, but certainly haven’t yet.
@wfryer Reason 10: The build. I have never owned a computer that has been built as well as this one. It is so solid in my hands every time.
@wfryer Reason 9: The Power Cable. I love that the USB-C charger disconnects from the cable. No more tangling things around each other.
@wfryer Reason 8: The Speed. I don’t have to wait for anything to load. I don’t have to constantly check the system resources either.
@wfryer Reason 7: The trackpad. I love the force touch trackpad, and how big it is. It feels so good to swipe across Spaces.
@wfryer Reason 6: The screen! I have totally changed my setup at my desk so that my monitor is the secondary screen. It is that good.
@wfryer Reason 5: The Touch ID. I know other computers have had biometrics for a while, but the responsiveness of Touch ID is ridiculous.
@wfryer Reason 4: The USB-C ports. I love moving forward with better I/O options. Have always used adapters, why not better ones like these?
@wfryer Reason 3: The Touchbar. When combined with BetterTouchTool, I have a customizable set of keys that I can make do literally anything.
@wfryer Reason 2: The keyboard is my favorite. It is so responsive and I love how loud it is.
@wfryer It literally is the computer I have been waiting for. Reason 1: Has enough horsepower to render 4K video without trouble.

@ShazamMcCartney Lots of school leadership that I’ve been meeting with. They want to replace with something more useful. It is a good thing.
@Taml17 yeah. Across Colorado, biggest reason to purchase devices in last 3-5 years has been to insure there are enough for assessment.
@Taml17 neither. The only 1:1 we have currently is where students don’t take devices home.
@milobo yeah. This one’s really tough. I think one of the smartest things svvsd did was purchasing devices that can’t be used for testing.

@LeadEdTech Absolutely! That strategy works for many Ts. I most struggle when Ts need to “see it” before engaging in that discussion.
@LeadEdTech sounds about right. I just see student screen sharing as such a core practice now, I want to support all Ts in doing it well.
@LeadEdTech hmm… do you have confusion amongst teachers in knowing what to choose in the moment?
Is anyone using Google Cast for Education as the default solution for sharing screens in their building? If not, what are you using? #Help
Our @aps_it_director goes and speaks with every school leader, every year,  	to talk through planning for tech refresh! #UserFocused

What would happen if we started looking for those orgs/businesses who can endorse our badges rather than trying to go it alone? #BadgeSummit
Digital Badges allow for kids to gain access to “credentials” in K-12 that they formerly had to wait until they graduated. #BadgeSummit
RT @Amanda66044: How do we address the digital divide with open badges? #badgesummit
The teacher badge toolkit from @aurorak12 is no joke: https://t.co/Hf0VrEce6c #APSMovesTheBoxes
“Badges help students have language for their assets.” Teachers can use that language to value the assets outside of grades. #badgesummit
I really like the stories from teachers and students about badging in @aurorak12. “I knew nothing when we started…” #badgesummit
Where do badges belong in a College or Job Application? Personal Essay? Skills and Experience? Profile and Resume? #badgesummit
Oregon trail was created before there was a “right way” to create learning apps. It still created huge opportunities for kids. #badgesummit
“If you don’t put evidence in a badge, don’t both creating it.” #BadgeSummit
“Badges establish for students what it means to be self-directed and values that skill. It says, @aurorak12 believes in you.” #BadgeSummit
“By the time Kids come to me in 11th grade, they’re good at failing. People told them they are failures and they believe it.” #badgesummit
@sarahdateechur Thank you! I love your moderating approach here.
Shapes of badges have meaning too. Pentagons=summit badges, the highest level of evidence and giving access to opportunities. #badgesummit

@PLearnMC I noticed you changed up your Parking Lot on your website. I liked the four categories, but wanted to leave contact info.
@smartinez absolutely! I love the new Pablo extension from @buffer.
@SenorG I was not. What is a task fair?
@dlaufenberg @funnymonkey yep. GDocs OCR tools can help in a pinch, but even then it can be rough.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg Yeah. Me too. I’d like to see an end to white papers, but until that time I will continue to remix PDFs.
@funnymonkey Yes. PDFs create hierarchy and control dynamics by default. They are anti-read/write. I still find them useful.
@funnymonkey Then they are doing it wrong.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg Maybe, but I’ve used many open source PDF tools for annotating and reading that I really like a lot.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg You will get no argument (from me or anyone else) on scanned/poorly formatted PDFs (gaps between letters, etc.)
@funnymonkey We should choose the right tool for the right job, I agree. I just think they have (and will continue to have) value.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg Exactly. I wonder if we can help people to transition between things like gDocs and PDFs: https://t.co/GG6e8Z6BL8
@funnymonkey That is the issue for me. There are more/better options (plural). PDFs are legacy docs, but they are universally readable.
@funnymonkey But, should it be? Is it any harder than Forking a github project? Is it harder than running your own blog? @dlaufenberg
@funnymonkey It definitely isn’t limited there, but the ways in which we see accessibility for all requires common formats.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg It is about formatting for me. It is the tumblr effect. So many people take textshots with their ideas on top.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg PDFs aren’t where ideas go to die. They are where people accept unchanging ideas. We should stop doing that.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg But, PDFs aren’t stopping us from doing that. Our own understanding of file storage is stopping that.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg I’d like to see us move to version control of ideas and distributed/forked processes for sure.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg I see them claiming to be a format for dissemination, which isn’t my favorite. But, I don’t see that as a barrier.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg I have never found PDFs to be revolutionary, but they don’t claim to be. I rip them apart all of the time.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg What about the value of drawing/notes. I annotate PDFs often. Even more often I have them read to me as I drive.
@funnymonkey @dlaufenberg What do you suggest? Where should we be annotating and collaborating on ideas?

@kelriz Ah, yes. Clarity is key. cc @rjclarkmu
@kelriz What do you mean by mitigating the coachee’s thinking? @rjclarkmu
@rjclarkmu I fully recognize that paraphrasing, especially when it is done poorly, doesn’t lead to new learning.
@rjclarkmu Your coach should be able to flip into consultation if that is what you need. “Suggestions” can both help and hurt.
RT @rjclarkmu: @bhwilkoff Frustration comes when a coach tries to paraphrase  and all you want are practical suggestions for practice.
Sometimes you need to filter out your “consulting” in order to let someone else make their own meaning. #CognitiveCoaching #dpsppl
.@Den_Petersen I think that this speaks to our need to clearly define our learning and share it so that others can come along with us.

I’m going to be live tweeting a video in Cognitive Coaching for the next few minutes. Sorry if you are annoyed by this “learning out loud”
A teacher may struggle with reflection for diff. reasons. Often they need to hear: “Your thinking matters more than my thinking right now.”
Planning and Reflecting are best used with teachers who are NOT stuck. Problem resolution is best for those that are. #CognitiveCoaching
Sometimes, the only thing you can do in a coaching conversation is paraphrase. (If they are so frustrated or low in all states of mind.)
How are “cognitive styles” different than (debunked) “learning styles”? #CognitiveCoaching
