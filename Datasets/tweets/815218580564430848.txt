@polborta He actually did try to resolve the issue. He reached out and heard nothing back for hours before publishing the email.

@MattWalshBlog But why do you equate these two headlines for the entire left? I could do the same thing with Breitbart and Fox News

@NealBruceBC @CazHansen I think it's 1...ke2! 2. kg4 ke3 3. kxh4 kf4 and you never let the white King leave the h file unless it abandons the pawn.
@CazHansen @MarkTWIC 1...Nxe3 2. Nxe3 Qxd4 forks Knight and rook. White queen occupies the square that could resolve the fork.
