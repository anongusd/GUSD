@ScottMonty Only fools pursue it
You should ban "future-proof" from your organization. It will put you on the wrong path and set you up for failure. &lt;/&gt;
Preparing yourself/ your team/ your organization for the future means accepting uncertainty. Looking for multiple possibilities rather than a linear pathway. Seeking out new data all the time. Being willing to recalibrate your strategy again and again. /7
Future-proofing is a stand-in for the challenge of confronting deep uncertainty and having the emotional fortitude to live with unknowns. You cannot prevent against every kind of change that you don't control yourself. This is a hard lesson for companies and leaders to learn. /6
"Future-proofing" is a myth. 		A promise intended to make people feel secure, certain, easy during a time of great technological upheaval. 	 	/5
But asserting that a certain part of the population is "robot-proof" because of their skills set? Or that you can "future-proof" a company against automation? 		That would mean that nothing will ever change or that you already know everything that's going to happen in life. /4
You can make something "waterproof," because there are a limited number of variables. It is possible to coat a fabric with the right polymer that meets the criteria to repel water. /3
First, the word "future-proof" implies that you can fully prevent something damaging. That would mean that we have all of the data necessary right now to predict what will happen in the future. 		With emerging technologies, this is a mathematical impossibility.
I hate the word "-proof" when used to describe the future. As in "robot-proof," or "automation-proof" or the absolute worst offender "future proof." 		I have a few thoughts and a few minutes, so here come a handful of tweets. /1

4 - #TheBigNine launches on March 5th. For those in Congress who must now start working on the ‚ÄúAmerican A.I. Initiative,‚Äù read Part 3 and I would be happy to give you a detailed briefing, either in person on on the phone. @WHOSTP @housescience @senatecommerce
3 - Part 3 of #TheBigNine will help Congress execute Trump's executive order on #AI. I've written substantive guidelines for norms and standards for AI, policy recommendations, solutions for our workforce and education systems, and directives on how to build a global coalition.
2 - Congress will now have six months to figure out how to take the Executive Order's bullet points and turn them into meaningful #AI policy.		I hope that staff will consult the broader AI community -- academics, researchers, ethicists -- as they begin this difficult work.
1 - Regarding Trump's executive order on #AI...		‚Ä¢ I'm thrilled that @POTUS and his team see AI as a national opportunity as well as a significant threat.		‚Ä¢ But the EO is vague and makes no mention of detailed policy, concrete budget or longer-term vision for our future.
Scientists Gave This Robot Arm a 'Self Image' and Watched it Learn https://t.co/L5xDcpcbUC https://t.co/OYDaRD7NMD
@_DarrenCohen Yep. That is right.
3 - Was saying that it is possible to offer detail &amp;context without outing sources. This would give readers confidence in the reporting -- so that they don't immediately sink to arguing about "fake news."		That's all. Clearly threaded tweets are a bad idea. (And I did it again.)
2 - I am worried about the downstream effects of our current political climate on our futures and on the future of American society. The stakes are high when breaking big scoops about elected officials. People are already distrustful of quality journalism and that is a problem.
1 - A tweet I posted Friday went viral without folks reading the *whole* thread. (See screenshot.) I've now deleted it. For the record, my questions had to do with the strength of the reporting and reliance on unnamed sources. Not with the validity of the claims being made. https://t.co/QZkz1FGjyn

If you care at all about the future of America's role in geopolitics, all of this should be very, very concerning. 		Investors and analysts need to think not just about the near-term market, but about longer term economic implications. &lt;/&gt;
Meanwhile, in China, AI‚Äôs developmental track is tethered to the grand ambitions of government. China is quickly laying the ground- work to become the world‚Äôs unchallenged AI hegemon.
Rather than treating AI as an opportunity for new job creation and growth, US lawmakers see widespread technological unemployment. In turn they blame US tech giants, when they could invite these companies to participate in the uppermost levels of strategic planning in govt
The US has subjugated AI to the revolving door of politics. Instead of funding basic research into AI, the federal government has effectively outsourced R&amp;D to the commercial sector and the whims of Wall Street.
It is LITERALLY the opposite in #China, where tech R&amp;D spending at the Chinese side of the Big Nine (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) is not only encouraged, it's supported by Beijing. 		America's side of the Big Nine has an antagonistic relationship with Washington -- on good days.

The fact that analysts are upset with Alphabet for lower than expected margins is why American #AI is in big trouble. Investors are concerned that @Google is spending big on R&amp;D. Google is building exponential technologies. We cannot -- and must not -- expect constant big margins

@hilarybmiller I think it had to do with a lump single check vs payments spread over two checks. It isn't treated as salary. Sounds like sorting out federal back pay at this scale is unprecedented...so there are some logistical questions
Journalists: Just talked with a friend who's a lawyer in the Labor Department. She mentioned that back pay is taxed at a different rate than regular government salaries. Which means that when gov't workers get their back pay, it could be +/- what they normally receive.

@arpitrage so good. so true!
Bricks come in pallets of 500, weighing about 1.7 tons. 		So you need A LOT of human workers to lift, haul, and deliver all those bricks.		*scribbles some more math*		You'd need a minimum of 80 people able to work more than 8 hours. 		But! Furlough. No dice!
Next, let's talk about logistics. 		The Certified Website of President Donald J. Trump‚Ñ¢ is planning on sending 100,000 bricks to Congress, apparently in bulk. 		*does quick back of the napkin math*		That's 3.5 million pounds of bricks!
So I went to USPS, UPS and FedEx to look up how much it would cost to send a single, 3.5-pound, 65-cent brick.		On the cheap end, it's around $5. On the expensive end, it was $15.		But the Trump Administration has jacked up the price between 34% and 304%!!!
Bricks literally cost 65 cents a piece. And that's buying a brick at full retail at a place like @HomeDepot 		https://t.co/5iYBefvTog
But here's what I find so ugly. 		So deeply offensive. 		So awful.
As you undoubtedly know, America has a long, terrible history involving bricks and people. This is not a glib, sophomoric response to Pelosi and Schumer. 		"Sending" a brick invokes certain images we're all very familiar with.
The president of the the US -- the world's largest economy -- employs a team of people who are asking Americans to send bricks to elected congresspeople who have divergent views. 		This is a screenshot of the website. https://t.co/t7Kt1c2mkK

We already know what happens when the market is saturated not only with content, but with content providers. 		Netflix and every company with OTT plans for 2019 should engage in strategic backcasting to figure out a better ending to this story.
Quantity leads to the tyranny of choice.		Tyranny of choice leads to fatigue.		Fatigue leads to disinterest.		Disinterest leads customers to alternate products and services.
Like this: "I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs really worth the time suck of endless scrolling or the money."		In 2019, you're going to see a ton of streaming services launch. Disney, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Discovery... and once again, the business model = quantity.		https://t.co/LRZVwhPEyR
And yet... look at the success of newsletters and podcasts. Niche audiences, with limited content. (This was one of the plausible outcome scenarios we developed at @FTI back in 2012.)		This brings me to the Netflix news today -- and to the backlash I'm seeing.
The impetus appears to be drawn from the eHows and Upworthy headlines and BuzzFeed listicles of yore.		But in practice, quantity at this kind of scale dilutes quality at a rate that confuses and confounds consumers. To the point where they turn elsewhere.
At one point, Time Inc's business model aimed to produce at &gt;500 pieces of content a day and to distribute it across platforms. I know this because at the time, they were a client and I told them it was a bad idea. I created models and scenarios detailing why.
Somehow media orgs have come to this idea that distributing enormous amounts of content is the best way to capture attention, and therefore revenue.		When it was still "tronc," the business model was -- and I quote -- "publishing 2,000 videos a day with artificial intelligence"

Wealth doesn't mean an easier life necessarily. Yes significant hardships go away. They are replaced by new kinds of hardships that can be equally difficult. Divorce is hard, regardless of wealth. Keep in mind as you're turning @JeffBezos's divorce into a national joke today &lt;/&gt;
Here's what happens next: twitter will continue to make jokes for the next 24-48 hours, followed by vloggers and podcasters, followed by late night talk shows. While everyone is snarking, real humans will have to deal with the messy realities of divorce in America. (2)
When a famous couple divorces, for whatever reason, they're now forced to make public declarations in front of the entire world. Which is hard enough. It's sick watching twitter make snarky jokes about Alexa and prenups and what happens next to the "world's richest couple." (1)

Think about the ratio of American citizens using high capacity automatic guns to defend themselves against a violent attacker vs American citizens using those guns to commit violent acts.		That ratio does not support the argument being made by the gun lobby.
If we look at the data between 1918 - 2018, though, what number of "violent attacks" have been *thwarted* by an American citizen -- not law enforcement -- defending her/himself using a high capacity magazine? 		There is an answer to this question.		The answer is zero.
"However, implementation of the legislation was quickly opposed by the California Rifle &amp; Pistol Association...  arguing the new rule would violate their Second Amendment rights by restricting their ability to defend themselves against a violent attacker."
See:		California Voters Outlawed The High Capacity Magazine Used By The Bar Shooter. The NRA Sued And Blocked It. https://t.co/AoRO35NPDX

@samwmarks Right. I just worry that anger swings the pendulum away from democracy and towards authoritarianism. I wonder about alternatives.		I keep running this thought experiment. What if Twitter, FB, WhatsApp, etc all went dark for a month? Could society reset?
@AndySwan @GenePark ah yes
@samwmarks I had a profound experience at the national WWII museum a few weeks ago. It's hard not to draw parallels. I see polarization as a benefit to authoritarianism. The immediate reaction and anger is an accelerant. That said, I don't have an alternate plan for us.
@AndySwan @GenePark I hadn't heard that he got one too
The Trump White House prioritizes immediate reward over future risk. It is modeling that behavior on the world's stage, and this poses significant threats to the near-future of American society. 		I‚Äôm concerned about us. 		And for us.
You could argue that this is cyclical, and that we are simply transitioning through a period of intense disagreement as we did in the 30's and 60s. But this time is different. What's different is transmission, speed and immediate reward.
What's happening on social media, in the White House, in our homes and offices isn‚Äôt discussion. It isn't logical argument. It's arguing. 		We are vulnerable because we've allowed ourselves to become habituated to arguing with each other, all the time, about everything.
We are rewarded for our quick reactions in the form of others‚Äô reactions (likes, retweets), which in turn become aggregated reactions by various media orgs, in print, online, in podcasts, and on TV newscasts across the entire political spectrum. 		We emote first, think later.
I am gravely concerned that our society has become vulnerable, and that our American vulnerability is now being exploited by those who cherish authoritarian rule. Those who don't believe in democratic ideals. Who don't value freedom.
The person/ people sending pipe bombs to the homes of Soros, the Clintons, the Obamas. That vulnerability blinded them to logic. 		Who likely gets and opens their mail? Especially strange packages? Staff. Regular people. Moms and dads. People who are just making a living.
Somehow we aren't able to see clearly that polarization, anger and mistrust makes us incredibly vulnerable.
I worry that in the earliest days of social media, we were seeking dopamine hits of affirmation, and that now we‚Äôre getting the same high off of feeling pissed.		We are being habituated ‚Äî via data, digital design, political rhetoric ‚Äî to take a binary position and react quickly.
Since my job is to model risk and opportunity for the future, I‚Äôve been concerned about the farther-reaching implications reactive anger, mistrust and disgust ‚Äî and the speed at which we now react ‚Äî on democracy, geopolitics and our economy.
This leads to only a surface understanding of the issues leading up to that initial anger. Over time, that surface-only understanding compounds. It blocks out truths in favor of emotion. 		I worry ‚Äî I deeply worry ‚Äî that we‚Äôve been habituated to prioritize anger over analysis.
My observation is that in the aftermath of the 2016 election, we are too quick to condemn. We‚Äôve been habituated to feeling immediate anger first, followed by social media posts, followed by essays/ videos, which fuels more anger, more posts, and seeds distrust and disgust.
I have some thoughts regarding politics, polarization and our future. Many tweets are forthcoming.
My point is this: I can fly first class whenever I want. But I tend to fly Southwest because I can always change my ticket to suit my real-time schedule. Even without involving a human. Since I never check bags, this means that I don't have to wait around for planes as much.
This is a smart move by Southwest. I've primarily flown Southwest, which doesn't have first class seating or any real perks - but I could easily change my ticket and hop on other flights with zero hassle. This new policy is now, I guess, negative hassle?		https://t.co/96Mk4HfIDl

@beth_janson Ok, I can understand that it makes logical sense. I don't know that removing the designation addresses that however. I also don't know how to solve athletics. Much nuance and complexity there.
So, I'm stuck. I can't create risk scenarios that would prove how our futures would be worse off if the designation and legal definition of trans people were to change. Risk and deep uncertainty is kind of my thing.		And yet, I can only write opportunity scenarios.
Recognizing trans status would be very good for business. There are numerous opportunities to serve a community that has been historically ignored.
If the argument is financial--that a trans status would harm others' individual access to wealth or success, or that recognizing trans people would be an economic risk to the US, the math doesn't work.
The comfort argument fails because we arguably feel uncomfortable around others who are not like us and we still use official designations to describe them, and we therefore give them certain protections: those in challenging socioeconomic, cognitive, and physical situations.
If the objection is about comfort, again, I can understand this. We do not have all of the cultural and  educational pieces in place. And not enough time has passed for us, as a society, to have gained a level of maturity for us to feel completely at ease. However!
I've spent some time thinking this through. If the objection is religious, I understand that. However, if the person objecting to trans identification isn't also living their lives according to rigid definitions of scripture, then I think the religious objection fails.
Honest question from me, because I'm trying very hard to understand the other side. 		Why would one person care so deeply about how another person recognizes their gender? How does someone's gender identity cause another person harm/ suffering/ peril?

@jarroddicker @pilhofer @jkeefe Agree. The real problem is that the market doesn't reward media companies for R&amp;D that might take years (a few, several) to pay off. 		The private sector likely can't produce the research that leads to radically different business models on its own.
@dansinker @pilhofer @jkeefe Cool.
@pilhofer @dansinker @jkeefe Summary: The Civil token sale may have been an initial disappointment, for reasons that were both controllable and uncontrollable.

@dansinker @jkeefe Also keep in mind that this is a first attempt. Usually v1 of a new tech idea takes a lot to get off the ground. (Friendster v1, Myspace v2, Facebook v3 finally hits.)
@dansinker @jkeefe 4. The reason for investing in tokens wasn't explained well by Civil	5. The use cases for tokens within the Civil network wasn't explained well	6. Serious lack of marketing (which needed to include all that explanation)	7. It's early, and the tech is still maturing
@dansinker Here's where I think things went wrong for them...		1. Very few people understand what tokens are	2. The process for buying tokens is convoluted for the average journalist	3. Even tech-savvy jurnos like @jkeefe tried to buy tokens and complained (rightly) about the process

@drsyb @FTI @wakeuplaughing @EbonyReed Thanks for being amazing!!!
@Chronotope @pilhofer @losowsky @noahchestnut @coralproject @dqandrade I like that better. Anything to avoid forcing people into binary positions. Which would be an antidote to what happens on social media and, sadly, in DC.
@noahchestnut Well, you're talking for a former Hoosier! The four years I spent on IU's speech and debate team were magic. We were top five the whole time I was there. (They defunded the program after I left, which was awful.)
@pilhofer @losowsky @noahchestnut @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade Agree and agree. Add complexity later. We should acknowledge that forcing hard questions into two sides is not what we're eventually after... but it might be a place we have to start.
@losowsky @Chronotope @pilhofer @coralproject @dqandrade +1
@losowsky @pilhofer @noahchestnut @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade That's a good starting question. Two sides would be too limiting... a seven-person debate would be hard to observe. So I think the constraints are going to have to answer:		‚Ä¢ highest number of possible positions (2 min, maybe 4 max?)	‚Ä¢ highest number of possible debaters
@noahchestnut So I've always said that if you were a former athlete, you can play a pickup game of basketball or football. If you were a debate nerd, there's........ twitter. 		Emory is strong! We relied on Baylor in hs. When I was in college a million years ago, we were always in the top 5.
@Chronotope @pilhofer @losowsky @coralproject @dqandrade Hover would be preferable -- but I think before commencing the debate folks should have to state their positions/ affiliations on the subject. No way to verify easily, but it'd be a value add for observers.
@noahchestnut @pilhofer @losowsky @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade I worry that too many rules might discourage a robust conversation. To streamline, maybe set time constraints (24 hours, 48 hours) and you can't add new points until the other side/ person has responded.
@noahchestnut represent! Policy for 4 years in high school and 2 in college before switching over to LD and extemp, impromptu, rhet crit, ADS and (because I wanted to pentathlon each week)....... duo. Are you from the midwest?
@pilhofer @losowsky @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade Adding my requests:		‚Ä¢ editability, but in a way that preserves and shows the original text	‚Ä¢ place where I can quickly see bios of debaters - important, so we understand their POV	‚Ä¢ ability to upload images and videos
@losowsky @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade @kgardnr https://t.co/1BdJ0DkHcA
@Chronotope @losowsky @coralproject @dqandrade Hey @francium. Help some very cool people out? (See thread)
@losowsky @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade Looping in @pilhofer, since we've both debated on twitter and debated about how it'd be nice to debate using a better tool.
@losowsky @Chronotope @coralproject @dqandrade Doooooo it. (Befooooooore the midterms?)
@Cekent @Chronotope Branch! Couldn't for the life of me remember the name of it.
@Chronotope @coralproject @losowsky Closer. I'm thinking of something not tethered (necessarily) to a news story... @dqandrade reminds me of Talkshow, which doesn't exist anymore. I have to think that there'd be appetite for something like this. An iteration of Talk @losowsky?
@dqandrade Ah yes, forgot about that.
Others can provide feedback by agreeing with points, disagreeing with points, and offering additional facts/ research/ resources.		If the letters section of the Atlantic, Twitter's UX, and Reddit's upvoting system got together and had a baby, that'd be the platform.
We need a debating platform that will allow 2-5 people to discuss a central idea/ question in a public forum using a conversational UX (like twitter). Others can observe. They can also make comments. If the comment is valid/ helpful/ trusty, one of the debaters can include it.
Free idea! @Chronotope and I have been debating this morning, and we got to a point where I couldn't squeeze my points into tweets without way more editing than I was willing to do. (I'm at work, and this hasn't been a productive morning.)
@Chronotope I feel like debating platforms have come and gone, and we're just left with twitter. We need a platform where two people (or maybe 2-5 ppl) can debate, others can only observe but can DM ideas to the debaters for approval and inclusion. But is threaded and conversational.
@Chronotope That makes sense, and it's good to make that counterpoint. I still very much disagree with you -- but your detailed public reply was the right thing to do. It's hard to have these conversations in tiny (physical) spaces.
@Chronotope I hear you. This is a complicated, nuanced debate that's definitely better suited over drinks than 260 characters (even threaded ones). So let's do that sometime.
@Chronotope given the current capacity of the tech companies and our military, there are big gaps that the military on its own can't manage. 		So again, what's different in 2018 is the expectation of transparency. Which, by the way, I'm all for.
@Chronotope We can go back to the 1880s and look at how large US tech companies have been intertwined with military advancement in this country. Just because that's the way it has always been doesn't necessarily mean that's the way it will always be. However...
@Chronotope Did you read everything I wrote before that last tweet? I'm not shrugging at big tech. I'm acknowledging the way our military and our tech sector have always partnered.
@jsargentr Not debating that point. I'm reacting to yet another story saying that workers in the tech sector should be surprised that their companies are responding to government contract RFPs.
6. I'm sure we'll hear more stories like this in the years to come. Just remember that ours is not the first generation to see partnerships between the tech and military sectors. And remember that the relative peace the US enjoys is something we work at, all the time. &lt;/&gt;
@Maria_Arce @business @magicleap No, it isn't scary at all. I would be MORE scared if the military was attempting this kind of innovation completely on its own.
5. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Magic Leap ... This is the latest generation of companies partnering with the military. These contracts are not unusual. 		What's changed is our expectation that we ought to be informed about everything, all the time, regardless of circumstance.
4. Disagreeing with the premise of a geopolitical conflict is natural. However disagreeing with the premise that the US ought not to be prepared is misguided. It's that preparedness that serves as a preventative shield against conflict.
3. Throughout our country's history, technology companies have always worked together with our military. Always. Consumers enjoy the downstream benefits of those partnerships in the form of services (GPS) and devices (mobile).		But our *primary* benefit is safety and security.
2. Peace comes at a cost. This is something that a lot of people don't think about until something catastrophic happens.
1. Magic Leap and Hololens are adjacent technologies, but they are not the same. 		Magic Leap is not an augmented reality device. Neither is Hololens. This is a misuse of the term.
I have lots of thoughts on this @business story about @magicleap and Hololens. So...		https://t.co/QOi9Czpfy5

Tech Trends in this cluster: DLTs, self-sovereign identity, immutable records, tokens, tokenomics and shared resource computing  #ONA18Trends
Key Finding Two: In 2018, blockchain technology is ready for news distribution and payments.  #ONA18Trends
Scenarios - remember, I‚Äôm only showing optimistic this year. Let‚Äôs see some opportunities on the horizon! #ONA18Trends

What‚Äôs a post-smartphone world like? Smart glasses and tablets.  #ONA18Trends
So the new iPhones. Incrementally better. #ONA18Trends
For the first time, the global sales of smartphones have peaked. This is something that @FTI forecast two years ago. #ONA18Trends
If you were at ONA 2008, the Flip camera was everywhere. EVERY. WHERE.  #ONA18Trends
Ah, nostalgia. Who remembers burning music to Minidiscs? Or the Nokia 5110?  #ONA18Trends
Yes, I know that this week Apple launched a bunch of new phones.  #ONA18Trends
Key Finding One: 2018 is the beginning of the end of smartphones.  #ONA18Trends
As I show you trends for 2019, I‚Äôm going to tie them back to opportunities for news. #ONA18Trends
I‚Äôm going to highlight some of the key findings from our 2019 report and show you some of the trends. #ONA18Trends
Trends are just the beginning. Use them to develop your strategies for the years to come. #ONA18Trends
This work is done to calculate risk and opportunity, so that our @FTI clients can develop new/ existing business units and make better strategic decisions. #ONA18Trends
Then we build data-driven models for possible, plausible and probable futures scenarios. #ONA18Trends
Then use tools to analyze patterns so that we can spot emerging trends. #ONA18Trends
We first identify weak signals at the fringe. #ONA18Trends
What kind of data we use ‚Äî quantitative vs qualitative ‚Äî depends on the technology we‚Äôre forecasting. #ONA18Trends
AT @FTI we use a data-driven process that relies heavily on evidence and pattern recognition. We do some of it by hand, and some of the work aided by machine learning systems.  #ONA18Trends
Just a few notes on the methodology we use to surface and track trends, then I‚Äôll reveal what‚Äôs in this year‚Äôs report. #ONA18Trends

You‚Äôre going to leave here ready to fight for our futures. #ONA18Trends
You‚Äôre not going to be scared today. You‚Äôre going to get fired up. #ONA18Trends
Enough is ENOUGH. #ONA18Trends
But this year, I choose the optimistic framing. #ONA18Trends
Of course there is risk ahead. We still have to acknowledge optimistic, pragmatic and catastrophic scenarios. #ONA18Trends
I see people who are thirsty for solutions. I see a room full of tough, resilient journalists. #ONA18Trends
I know there is opportunity in this room, because I can see it. I‚Äôm looking at smart people. Innovative people. Thirsty people. #ONA18Trends
Because I see opportunity in this mess. I hear opportunity in the cacophony of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù insults. #ONA18Trends
Instead, this year I‚Äôm going to focus on opportunity. #ONA18Trends
With apologies to @mjenkins, this year I‚Äôm not going to scare you. #ONA18Trends
At this point, I don‚Äôt know what I can possibly say at @ONA that would be scarier than what‚Äôs happening in real life.  #ONA18Trends

5 - Independent booksellers may not have big law firms on retainer, which explains why they're being targeted. 		But they have a strong defense. If FB, Amazon, Twitter are conduits for content and aren't subject to libel created by others, then neither are bookstores.
4 - Which we've heard before. Facebook is just a platform. Twitter is just a platform. Amazon is just a platform.		Why wouldn't this also apply to independent booksellers?!
3 - Some of the bookstore owners have defended themselves, saying they're just the store, not the reporters or publishers. They're not the content creators.
2 - Rather than going after Hachette and the authors directly, the subject of the book has lawyers sending threatening letters to bookstores around the world.

@editorialiste To be fair, our conversation was sprawling and I did offer a ton of alternate models and ideas... they didn't make the story.		Completely agree, re: capturing us with the right content at the right time. Which is why some niche newsletters are finding success with monetization.
@hollywoodspin @editorialiste @MiamiHerald @TheAthleticMIA I feel like there are other possibilities that haven't been explored yet. Capturing opportunity often means shouldering some risk, though. I understand why news orgs are reluctant to experiment, but I don't see any other way forward.
@hollywoodspin @editorialiste @MiamiHerald This isn't a markedly different approach. It's the same business model applied to a segment of the newspaper: sports.

REM was basically all I listened to between 1985 - 1993 (with some time saved for George).
Those two bands are, of course, the inimitable REM and the B-52s. Not only did these two bands influence everyone else that followed -- they also influenced established and beloved musicians. The B-52s are what inspired John Lennon back into the studio.

16 - which, for our near-term future, is the biggest problem of all.		&lt;/many tweets about twitter&gt;
15 - bigger problem: at the moment, there is no competing platform. So there is no competitive pressure to improve.
14 - the challenge is that Twitter has become a powerful tool for strategic communication. One that can move markets, impact geopolitical relations, impact public safety.
13 - I suspect I'm not the only one.		Twitter doesn't really work as a source of interesting, useful content. There's too much confusion now woven in by too many accounts, even after the purge, and even after my own purge, when I unfollowed a bunch of accounts.
12 - for me, Twitter is a great platform for microblogging and live-tweeting conferences. It works as a publisher.		But I now spend *significantly* less time reading tweets and engaging with people on the platform.
11- that confusion is exacerbated by our glance-based reading habits, by repetitive content, and by the strategic gain of distraction.
10 - the problem is that Twitter has been repurposed to intentionally confuse people, and this is happening at scale.		The problem isn't just misinformation campaigns by Russian bots.
9 - and here's what happened next: I told my other half that Sacha got some guy on camera lying about being a military vet, but he really worked for the post office. We both sort of rolled our eyes and had a laugh.		I got the details wrong, but it took days to find out.
8 - ...but then turned out he was a vet of the postal service. I saw this letter tweeted and read only the first paragraph, and because of the way it was displayed on my screen, I didn't see the Vice President Palin part... https://t.co/xTcCc327rm
7 - I was glancing at a tweet sent by... I don't remember, because I was putting on my shoes at the time... And read something quickly about a Billy Wayne Ruddick who was duped into telling Sacha Barron Cohen that he was a vet.
6 - In the past week, @elonmusk sent out disparaging tweets about the Thai cave rescue. I can only speculate as to why... 		But the tone seemed unusual for him. Which made me think "subterfuge" much more than "submarine"
5 - The problem with every technology is that it is often repurposed for bad/unintended uses.		Sometimes even by people you really like.
4 - Twitter launched 12 years ago yesterday. https://t.co/DrZrXT8X5j
3 - For me, Twitter has been most effective as a replacement for RSS readers. 		But that is no longer true. The reason illustrates why Twitter was once so great -- and why it no longer serves its original purpose today.
2 - for the past 12 years, I've  typically used Twitter for the following, in order of use:		- microblogging (like this string)	- aggregating news content	- aggregating commentary	- DM-ing friends	- live tweeting conference speeches	- intentional distraction	- live event fun
1 - During the past month, I've mostly stopped using social media. After the break, I'm seeing Twitter in a very different light.
&lt;many tweets about Twitter&gt;

16 - Last thing. My dad isn't elderly. He's in his early 70s.
15 - I realize this thread is full of typos. I'm tired and I'm pissed.
14 - Precision medicine and AGI for healthcare can't get here fast enough. I'm done with humans.
13 -  If docs are concerned about the emergence of AI, they ought to be worried about their jobs. Because an AI system, with access to lots of data, can run circles around four ego-driven specialists who aren't really talking to each other.
12 - Meds are a stand-in for the hard work of thinking.
11 - We've engendered a system in which docs don't really talk to each other long enough for any serious analysis or insight. They certainly don't have time to talk to patients or their caregivers in a meaningful way.		So instead, medications and more medications.
10 - How do I live in a country with one of the largest economies on earth... a country that sent a car into space... a country that is home to the most influential and important companies anywhere...		and yet America's system of health care is so profoundly screwed up?
9 - His GP "doesn't do rounds at hospitals." There is a "hospitalist," but that person has to defer to the admitting doctor, who in our case is a specialist overseeing a problem in a different part of the body. There is a "patient advocate" mostly deals with payments.
8 - But if he refers a patient out to specialists, he stays in the loop and co-manages all the care, and he's the person who works with the patient to coordinate. That makes sense.		I'm quickly learning that in the rarified field of American medicine, that's rare.
7 - My other half is an optometrist. He's the kind of eye doc who manages disease, and he researches how technology helps people see better (or makes their vision worse). If he needs to cut into the eyeball, he refers patients to an opthamologist who does surgery...
6 - This is what happened next.		Me, to the cardiologist: WTF?		Cardiologist: the body is complicated.		Me: so are you taking him off the other meds?		Cardiologist: maybe		Me: When will you know to recalibrate?		Cardiologist: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
5 - Last night, the cardiologist prescribed yet another blood pressure medication (that brings him up to 4) and yet another diuretic (he's now on 3).
4 - At the moment, my dad is at a small community hospital with a chronic prostate infection, but a cardiologist admitted him. While there is a urologist and a nephrologist involved, the cardiologist is calling the shots. And guess what?
‚Ä¢ We've elevated specialists and disincentivized GPs. If you're not at a teaching hospital, it's unlikely you have a quarterback with a game plan who's thinking through all the possible plays. (3)
2 - Somehow in America, this is what we've allowed to happen: 		‚Ä¢ The standard of care has been to forego rigorous discovery--determining why, specifically, someone is sick--for piling on more meds. (Argue with me all you want, but show me evidence I'm wrong.)
1 - My dad is in the hospital, again, for the third time in four weeks. The reason? Various "problems" diagnosed by various specialists. Here's my diagnosis: the guys is on 14 different medications, prescribed by 4 different doctors, who aren't looking at the bigger picture.

What I learned: I'm going to change my news consumption radically. Different sources, different tools to read/listen/watch. And far less immediate detail.
I'll also say that I made a clean break -- no news at all for a week, and virtually no social media.		There's no question: I didn't miss the daily DC play-by-play, and I was able to catch back up on my drive home. 		Distance from the DC circus has given me better perspective.

14 - In summary:		* Bathrooms should be better. It's 2018.		* We can all use the same bathroom. It's seriously not a big deal. Japan does it!		* We need more women and nonbinary industrial designers and engineers.
13 - Seriously, wall mounted retractable doors! That alone would dramatically improve the bathroom experience for all.
12 - there is a urinal area in one part of the bathroom, for those who want to use it. And a wider space between the sinks and the stalls themselves. 		While there are fewer stalls overall, it will be much easier for people to get in and out of them thus saving time.
11 - Key features include a wall mounted retractable door to save space, a much wider stall that can accommodate a suitcase or a stroller, a little area for a kid to sit down and wait, a narrower disposal bin for tampons/pads, and a shelf to put bags.
10 - It seems like we're missing a human centered design opportunity to make bathrooms more egalitarian.		So I've redesigned a gender-neutral bathroom that would be great for everyone. https://t.co/l2zxqIjUZf
9 - This isn't just a problem at BWI or even at airports. In America, public bathrooms are clearly designed by men who aren't doing real-world usability studies in advance.
8 - For reasons I won't get into right now I have spent some time in men's bathrooms in America. I can say with authority that men's bathrooms are designed with men in mind.		I think the problem with women's bathrooms is that they were also designed with men in mind.
7 - The space between the stalls and the sink is quite narrow. So it actually takes women more time in the bathroom in part because it takes extra time to maneuver in and out of the stalls especially when there are other people crowding around the sink.
6 - I have a regulation-size international carry-on and it doesn't clear the door unless I sort of straddle the toilet seat while walking in, which is uncomfortable and honestly a little gross.
5 - the door opens inward and barely clears the toilet bowl. There is a large toilet paper dispenser next to the toilet itself, jutting almost into it. On the other side is a extremely large receptacle for tampon and pad disposal. 		The math doesn't work out.
4 - This is a mostly to scale drawing of the women's bathroom at BWI. https://t.co/Zzk1BiSypd
3 - Somehow, humankind has managed to get to the Moon and back... has mapped the genome... 		And yet, women's bathroom design hasn't evolved at the same rate as technology.		Bathrooms also haven't evolved to reflect our changing expressions of gender.
2 - Specifically, I've been thinking about public bathrooms.
1 - I'm stuck in summer air traffic hell. Bad storms have disrupted flights all around the East Coast. So I've been at the airport a loooong time today, and I have had a lot of time to think.

All that said, I wish America was ok with letting stories end. (Like they are in Japan.) As much as I love Westworld, I can't imagine a S03 that builds on and improves the storytelling from here.
While I am generally against anthropomorphizing AI, Westworld's storytelling -- as it related to learning machines -- was incredibly good. 		Dialogue about choices vs decisions was also great...and they did their research. It mirrors historical debate on AI and mind.
The second half of Westworld's season finale completely fell apart, and the S02 narrative arc lacked continuity. 		But it's still the most exceptional, remarkable show of our generation. It asks the sort of questions we will find ourselves confronted with in the future.

6. The patents which might offer some practical application are already outdated by better research at Amazon.		7. Now more than ever, we need independent, quality newsgathering and publishing across different channels. 		&lt;/&gt;
5. I'm also concerned because the term "AI" is being thrown around a lot, as if a handful of patents will somehow enable the LAT to turn a profit overnight. I've read every single patent (details below). They aren't applicable to the news business.		https://t.co/Zv3EBVrK6g
4. Therefore, we can assume that the papers were either (a) bought out of a sense of civic obligation or (b) for ego and the misguided sense that newspaper ownership offers certain PR opportunities, which it can and should not. 		(Let's hope it was the former.)
3. This implies that without significant investment in new business models (that uphold standards of high quality journalism) it's implausible that profits will be realized anytime soon
I wish all the best to @DrPatSoonShiong and the LAT, but I'm concerned.		1. $500m + $90m in pension liabilities was a dramatic overpayment, especially given the fact that there were no other serious bidders		2. It's going to *cost* more than $100m to upgrade digital assets https://t.co/uyLlKaQ0Tk

RT @corinne_podger: @amywebb Hi Amy enjoying this thread. Today I read this extraordinary essay by @Brrnrrd about Grenfell [https://t.co/6B‚Ä¶
RT @samwmarks: @amywebb Amy, it's not just zero tolerance.  It's racism. Please, let's not be afraid to call them out for what they are.
21 - Because children grow up to become adults, and adults make decisions about things, and America's reality isolationism is generative. 		We're imbuing future adults with horrible ideas about Americans and what America stands for. 		It's short-sighted and disgraceful.		&lt;/&gt;
20 - If ever there was a time for us all to take a much wider view of the present day, and to force ourselves to consider the relationships between seemingly disparate weak signals, it is right now.
19 - I'm a mom and I have a young daughter. I'm gutted hearing the stories and seeing the photos. 		Paradoxically, our collective outrage about what's happening at the border, I fear, is playing right into the reality isolationism playbook. (Such as there is one.)
18 - At the moment, the only optimistic reframing I can offer is this: if we can distinguish this current period of American isolationism and retreat as something fundamentally different, global leaders might hold a seat at the table for us, at least temporarily.
17 - America's isolationism 100 years ago was misguided, but there was a reasonable way out that didn't cause our elected officials to lose face.		Reality isolationism doesn't offer the same advantage. The only way out would embarrass our current administration.
16 - (scenario cont)		Our future conflicts are economic. Our future wars are fought algorithmically. America doesn't have the right alliances at the right time. We find ourselves in a valley we can't quite climb out of.
15 - (scenario cont)		‚Ä¢ Reality isolationism prevents the current administration from rebuilding trust. New alliances are formed, with China in a power position, and the world moves on without us.		‚Ä¢ American businesses suffer. Tourism suffers. Everyday life is a little worse
14 - (scenario cont)		‚Ä¢ America has no leverage as global leaders negotiate our global economy in an age of automation 		‚Ä¢ China winds up playing a much bigger role, has much more leverage, and offers significant economic investment. Issues like human rights are put aside.
13 - (scenario cont)		‚Ä¢ This happens at a critical moment in modern history, as the global economy reacts to automation and AI. This transition will take 70 years, but we're already in it.		‚Ä¢ New alliances are formed without America there to weigh in on critical decisions.
12 - Here's how reality isolationism plays out in the near-future.		‚Ä¢ Global leaders understand that America is more than its current president, but they can't put all decisions on hold until the next election.		‚Ä¢ America's global political stature is greatly reduced.
11 - The reasons for America's isolationism 100 years ago made it easier to pivot, to join our allies, and to eventually make the world a better place.		With ego on the line, reality isolationism makes it impossible to pivot. This Administration can't reverse course easily.
10 - America's previous isolationism had to do with fear of the unknown, trepidation about war, political pressure, and the misguided idea that America was better going it alone.		Reality isolationism is withdrawing from the world because of ego, power and status.
9 - But at least our isolationism wasn't performative. It wasn't being announced and shown on TV and codified on Twitter. 		We can draw parallels between the mid 1930s and today. They're not perfect, but weak signals are there.
8 - ...within just a few years, the Great Depression hit, ravaged our country, and we lost sight of what was happening overseas. We didn't see the rise of Japan and Europe's militaristic dictatorships coming.
7 - The world in 2018 is not as the world was in 1918, when post-WWI America withdrew into itself. Money was flowing, GDP was up, technology was being invented, innovation abounded. America entered a period of isolationism and grew a little more nationalistic. But...
6 - The Trump Administration has invented a new kind of isolationism. It's a total retreat from the world while simultaneously treating the entire world as a stage. It's reality isolationism. 		Here's why reality isolationism is catastrophic for America's future.
5 - This, from @jbmoorephoto, is a powerful image because of what it says... not just to us, as American citizens, but to people around the world. https://t.co/BuMOKTe6gz
4 - The very public debate, invoking the Bible, converting an old Wal-Mart into a holding center, and all the horrific photos are -- I believe -- intended to animate the zero-tolerance policy for a global audience.
3 - The zero-tolerance policy stems from three issues: xenophobia; a perception that somehow, American values are being eroded with new immigrants; and the notion that other programs haven't worked in the past.
2 - It's clear to me that the genesis for separating families at the border stems from the Trump Administration's zero-tolerance attitude on immigration.
1 - This morning I have some thoughts about immigration, what's happening at America's southern border, the Trump Administration's use of the Bible to justify separating families, and future scenarios/ implications. 		Here come the tweets.

You can think like a futurist. Our future selves depend on you!  #CLUS
I also published my complete methodology in The Signals Are Talking, which you can find at bookstores everywhere and online (Amazon, iBooks, B
The 2018 @FTI Tech Trends Report is available for download here: https://t.co/ncmgKO7yG2  #CLUS
Here‚Äôs a curated folder of forecasting tools, research, and reports. https://t.co/oj7CQa9Fe3  #CLUS
The good news is that the future hasn‚Äôt happened yet. It is up to you. YOU have the power to create your own preferred futures. #CLUS
The Amy on stage (not me, I‚Äôm digital) recently open-sourced work and made everything - her models, research and methodology - free to the public. #CLUS
We also made you a how-to guide and framework to help you get started. It explains how to get started lookin for weak signals and trends. #CLUS
It also answers the most common question we get: where do I start looking? what sources? We made you a list!  #CLUS
We know this sounds bad. Like, really bad. #CLUS
After building those scenarios, we typically assign a probabilistic model to indicate the confidence level we have. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre seeing  #CLUS
As part of our forecasting methodology, we develop scenarios using four emotive framings: optimistic, pragmatic, pessimistic and catastrophic  #CLUS
Ok, now the fun part. We‚Äôre going to make connections between all of thse dots and show you how this could play out over the next 10 years. #CLUS
Splinternets are real, and we‚Äôre going to start seeing regulatory/ compliance challenges in the U.S. soon. #CLUS
These are The Big 9 ‚Äî the companies who control the future of artificial intelligence  #CLUS
If someone hacks your face, how do you get it back? #CLUS
If your photos are in the public domain ‚Äî ex: Facebook, Instagram ‚Äî who can use your face, and for what purposes?  #CLUS
The application of AI in this way should force us to ask: who, exactly, owns your face? #CLUS
As it turns out, it wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault, legally speaking. That‚Äôs because in the U.S., no one broke the law doing this. #CLUS
No one hacked any routers or network infrastructure. It wasn‚Äôt IT‚Äôs fault! #CLUS
That‚Äôs Daisy Ridley, who portrays the strong, fierce Rey in Star Wars. She‚Äôs a feminist icon for the next generation. #CLUS
Here‚Äôs the Univ of Washington research on synthesizing Obama: https://t.co/uKChA1bGlR  #CLUS
Technology often evolves in ways that diverge from its original, benevolent intent. #CLUS
This is an example of augmented reality combined with faceprints and generative voice algos. I created it using Snap. #CLUS
It requires a bunch of data (in this case, photos), machine learning algorithms to train, and powerful processors to do the work. #CLUS
Werid! But also weirdly convincing. #CLUS
Remember this? It was funny when people were face swapping Nick Cage into all those movies. #CLUS
Time for another dot to connect‚Ä¶  #CLUS
Or you can scape anyone‚Äôs published works and voiceprint and generate spoken conversations‚Ä¶ like this. #CLUS
This essentially allows you to modulate any voiceprint to your specific liking. #CLUS
Your voice divulges way more about you than you probably realize. Used with AI, your voice becomes a powerful tool. #CLUS
Voiceprints are another interesting technology we‚Äôve been tracking. #CLUS
.@FTI‚Äôs model shows that 50% of your interactions with machines will be using your voice by 2021. #CLUS
Within the next 10 years, conversational interfaces and non-visual UIs will enter the mainstream.  #CLUS
AI isn‚Äôt an outlier, or a tech trend, or a buzzword. AI represents the third era of computing behind tabluation and programmable systems. #CLUS
When it comes to AI, we all have a lot of misplaced optimism and fear. #CLUS
So in the next 28 minutes, I‚Äôm going to show you the future of AI, given what we know to be true today. #CLUS
Thinking like a futurist really means making connections. Not predictions. #CLUS
Science tells us that if you want to know the future, you have to focus your attention in the present. That‚Äôs more difficult than it sounds. #CLUS
You can‚Äôt possibly have all the information needed at any one time to accurately model every possible outcome. #CLUS
There is no way to predict the future when humans are involved. It‚Äôs mathematically impossible. #CLUS
We‚Äôre going to lead off with your big takeaway, which may come as a shock. #CLUS
Connecting the dots indicates plausible outcomes. Example: you‚Äôll need to start thinkg about IoT BATHROOM security! #CLUS
Quick - what connections are you making?  #CLUS
Go back and tell the 2008 version of yourself that in 10 years that Kodak -- yes, THAT Kodak -- would try to make it big in the cryptocurrency market with an ICO. #CLUS
We will show a link to the digital downloads at the end.  #CLUS

14 - D'Souza may have broken campaign finance laws, but he's done far worse.		&lt;/storm&gt;
13 - And why people like D'Souza, who understand how to use numbers to tell a story and who are so desperate to be seen as a public intellectual, to be a talking head on TV and to be praised by others in power--are dangerous.
12 - You know why I won the crit category with this book over and over? Because I needed every single person I could reach to understand why books like this were so dangerous for our futures.
11 - The End of Racism was a 750-page invitation to stop thinking. To allow your brain to be hijacked by false patterns and a narrative that felt comfortable.
10 - Of course Hispanics crossing the border are going to join gangs and sell drugs and rape Americans. Just look at the numbers! I'm not racist. Stereotypes exist for a reason! 		(Don't retweet this out of context. I don't actually believe this. Read what came previously.)
9 - Of course two Black men in a Starbucks are up to no good. If you look at the data, Black men aren't educated and commit way more crimes than whites. It's not racist, it's just the numbers.		(Don't retweet this out of context. Read what came previously.)
8 - Then, those numbers become a kind of gospel. It feels wrong to go against the numbers. The numbers, the argument, and the new cognitive and emotional patterns form a shared, justified belief.
7 - People who are good at making arguments using numbers, especially when those arguments play into a cherished belief, are dangerous. Because they cement that pattern for us not just cognitively, but emotionally. And then it sticks. It's hard for us to get unstuck later on.
6 - As humans, we are cognitively limited by our own biology. Our brains rely on patterns in order to save on energy. Stereotypes leverage this biological deficiency. 		D'Souza's book focuses on our biological traits while completely ignoring the realities of our biology.
5 - All of these arguments (and more) are backed up with numbers. Of course, the numbers are designed to substantiate a single viewpoint. And that's where things got so interesting--and so dangerous.
4 - The End of Racism makes the argument that stereotypes exist for a reason. Black people are just more prone to violence, and they don't work hard. Jews are more intelligent because intelligence is a heritable trait, and they (we) don't interbreed. Etc.
3 - Meaning that in order to win, I couldn't just say "hey, this dude is full of shit." I'd have to pick apart his arguments and refute each with analysis, data, and evidence. It was going to be a challenge, and it was a book that would challenge me. That's why I chose it.
2 - The reason I chose D'Souza and The End of Racism was because I wanted something that completely challenged my own viewpoint. In order for me to win at crit, I'd have to apply serious analytical frameworks and make a convincing, data-driven argument.
1- Dinesh D'Souza's book, "The End of Racism," was the subject of my sophomore year rhetorical criticism competition speech and analysis in college. (I was on the speech team and I also competed in policy debate.) I spent a significant amount of time with all 750 pages of it.

In America, we've been taught that pills and surgery are the only options worth considering. Which is not only wrong, it's preventing us from living our healthiest lives.		So anyhow, read that @qz story. It's good. &lt;/&gt;
Acupuncture doesn't work for every ailment. Neither do PRP injections, therapeutic massage, etc. My point: seek out the best possible treatment for each situation.
For such an advanced country, we still have primitive, inflexible views on treatment options. 		And it's a shame that these treatments are labeled "alternative," which makes them sound hippy-dippy or ineffectual. They're alternatives to the big pharma machine.
There are important use cases for traditional pharmaceuticals. I'm grateful that I live in a country that develops and makes available those medications.		However, America has allowed a small number of pharma companies to dictate medical education, health care and treatment.
And it worked like a charm. Never once had to take pain medication. Never had to undergo really awful surgery.		So this brings me back to the @qz story, Japan, and medical options...
It's called platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections -- and it was never once mentioned by the surgeon. Basically, a doctor draws your blood, spins out the platelets, and injects them into the tear site. A few weeks later (and some physical therapy), you're back to normal.
Tears in other parts of the body typically self-heal. The problem with rotator cuffs is poor circulation. Not enough blood gets to where it needs to go for healing.		So I did some research and discovered a different, more personalized technique that helps the body heal itself.
Last year, I was having some shoulder pain. I went to a doctor, had some tests, and found out that I had a sizable tear in my rotator cuff. His only option for me: surgery, followed by pain meds. 		It seemed weird that there wasn't any other option.
Acupuncture and massage did the trick. Never once ingested pain medication -- which, let's remember, wasn't designed specifically for me. Medication is, at its best, a blunt-force instrument designed to treat the widest number of people.
I was at the doctor because of sciatic nerve pain, and I was given a choice: therapeutic massage and acupuncture or pain medication. I tried the former, figuring I could always pop pills if it didn't work. And I was fairly shocked...
I was first exposed to the idea of Eastern medicine vs Western medicine when I first lived in Japan. For example, when I went to the doctor, I was asked what my usual temperature was. 		I was surprised at the question. They were surprised that I didn't know it.
Just read this very good story about acupuncture and opioids on @qz, and I have some thoughts...		https://t.co/sX7GyevSrx

10 - Today, as you're reflecting on #MLK50, the past five decades, and the next five decades still to come, I'd urge you to think about intersection of civil society, government, data and technology.
9 - We humans learn from each other. But we're also teaching our future code bases, networks, and systems to learn from us as well. 		Eventually, these systems will learn from each other.		And then they will make decisions -- millions of micro-decisions -- on humanity's behalf.
8 - If we do not address bias, discrimination, social inequalities and our inability to get along in 2018, when people and technology are still malleable, 50 years from now humanity could find itself segmented into groups that literally make no sense.
7 - You know that phrase, "history is doomed to repeat itself"? 		It's been attributed to ancient Chinese philosophers, George Santayana, Winston Churchill, Edmund Burke... for thousands of years.		This ought to tell us something about our ability and willingness to learn.
6 - (It‚Äôs Austria‚Äôs turn to hold the position.)
5 - From earning less than a coworker who performed the same job to experiencing repeated, small slights.		Outside the US, Austria's ultra-right chancellor, whose People's Party aligns w/ former members of the Nazi party, will become president of the EU this year.
4 - Today marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King. Yet America feels increasingly divided, in ways that are explicit and less obvious: 60% of black STEM workers say they've experienced racial/ ethnic discrimination at work...  #MLK50
3 - If you want to understand the future of AI, biotech, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, green tech, fintech, agtech... you need to reflect on humanity's long trajectory. 		It may seem like everything has changed. Or very little.
2 - In order to confront the future, you must remember -- and reflect on -- history. This is true regardless of your professional or personal interests. 		Context is necessary because time operates on a continuum. #MLK50
1 - I want to share some thoughts on #MLK50 and our future. I'm asking for a few minutes of your time right now... but I'm also asking that you spend the next days, weeks and months reflecting.

My friend @RevTakaZen told me a wonderful story of his temple in Kyoto. 100s of yrs ago, monks planted trees for the next generations. 70 years ago, monks harvested just the right number of trees -- prepared them, treated them, stored them -- for the temple's future roof repair.
Right now, Chinese satellite Tiangong-1 is about to turn into a fireball overhead. The @esa estimates that there are now more than 170 million pieces of space debris in circulation.		We humans are very, very good at creating garbage. Garbage is the result of "nowist" thinking.

4 - I get a lot of questions about this ranging from "why?!" to "are you retiring?!" 		Here's my explanation: I'm extremely concerned that we're running headfirst into a complicated series of technologies and haven't thought things through.
3 - In practice this means that I'm inviting others to use our research and to use, tweak, and build on my methodology for strategy and foresight.

@jbenton I'll also note that I personally don't want this funding. I want funders to rethink what they're supporting and whether that makes tactical sense.
@jbenton It's a collaborative effort. I don't have complete answers yet. But I have seen enough from other people to suggest we're missing out on plausible scenarios. I want foundations to fund that work -- new biz and tech models -- first and foremost.
@jbenton You lack imagination.
@jbenton Wow... so fatalistic. Of course there are other possibilities. We're not robots living in someone else's simulation. 		(At least, I don't think we are.)
@raju We need managers capable of thinking very broadly... Who excel at the fridge and can calculate (but who aren't hindered by) risk... Paired with those who excel at organizational management

@cshirky I agree. Which is why part of the conversation has to include a critical look at distribution. The cycle of modern clickbait is the product of our distributors: Google, Twitter, Facebook. They seem opposed to change.
@cshirky It could be part of the revenue pie -- maybe part of the equation is making the real stories more palatable.

@maxjrosenthal Look for emerging tech trends, since technology and journalism are intertwined. Find connections between nodes. Get with people who are brilliant who care about news but aren't journalists. Think through plausible scenarios for business models.

@derekwillis @pilhofer I don't know, but that's my point. Let's explore it. Let's come up with original thinking -- let's borrow from what others have tried. Let's research, develop, test, pilot and learn.
@moorehn @NYUStern So good, we're getting somewhere. Maybe the bonus approach doesn't work in this case. 		Maybe we ought to rethink org charts and compensation models, too, for news. There are people who choose to go into public service for a period of time. They're not in it for the money.
@pilhofer @derekwillis They've come up with some weird, wild ideas. Some (understandably) are terrible. Some are ingenious. None would be given any attention if we brought them to one of the big news orgs.
@pilhofer @derekwillis I honestly don't know if they are -- but I'm also not a fatalist. The MBA class I teach at NYU Stern each semester works through a case study to see if they can forecast alt revenue models for news. (The class is strategic foresight, not media-related.) And...
@cshirky Dunno... aren't there other ways in which news orgs could generate revenue? Here's an extreme model that I'm not advocating - but using as an example of thinking radically different.		Using news sites to mine for crypto on the backend.
@moorehn @NYUStern ... we always do an in-class case study on sustainable business models for the future of news. Their professional backgrounds, combined with what they're learning in other @NYUStern classes = original thinking on business models. From my vantage, MBAs can be valuable.
@moorehn Actually a lot of them don't hold MBAs. I've now had three classes of extraordinarily talented, bright @NYUStern students who've had unique takes on the future of funding the news. That isn't the focus of my class -- I'm teach strategic foresight. However...

@pilhofer Not recommending that foundations support hedgies/ investors/ etc., by the way.
@pilhofer Whatever happened to that debate we were supposed to have?
@cshirky Surely there are plausible scenarios where news generates money but isn't a blunt-force product, subsidized by ads, or paid for via subscriptions? The revenue pie surely has more possibilities.
@BostonAbrams @ConversationUS And I'll throw out there that I love The Conversation. I *love* it. And I'm on the site all the time. But... (the but, I know)... ongoing funding from foundations and universities is also not a business model that is sustainable in the long-term.
@WmBrangham Less "read this entire thread." More action.
@mattcoolidge @alexkotch @readsludge @Join_Civil Trust and verification models ‚â† business models. They are different things, adjacently related. 		Again, I applaud your approach - it's good for trust. But it's not a radically different revenue model with new kinds of profit centers.
@tmsimmons @nickgrube Less thread. More action.
@merbroussard Less preach. More action.
@AdamS @BGPublic @mattervc Less thread. More action.
@DillonDavis Less thread. More action.
@meghanbkelly Less thread. More action.

@mattcoolidge @alexkotch @readsludge @Join_Civil You're talking to someone who knows a lot about blockchain and cryptos. I appreciate your approach. I advocated for this approach to address verification &amp; trust starting in 2015		But it is not -- at its core -- a fundamentally different business model for sustainable journalism
RT @robpegoraro: This. If you run a hedge fund or private-equity shop and think you can wring 1980s profit margins out of a 2018 newspaper,‚Ä¶
@alexkotch @readsludge @Join_Civil That's applying technology to deal with trust and verification. It isn't a business model.
32 - I'd like to see tweets explaining what steps you're planning to take, and when you're planning to take them.		Less emoji. More action. https://t.co/VFfMIsdtOn
@alexkotch That describes new content and new reporters. I don't see a radically different business model.
31 - To everyone who's now sending me the üëáüí™üëè  emoji and who are reposting the thread with "read this"... 		STOP. 		Stop it now!		I don't want your support. I don't want your praise. I want your ACTION.
@dkiesow No... (and now I need to get back to work)
30 - To summarize:		‚Ä¢ Media consolidation is happening, and that's bad for journalism.		‚Ä¢ We need quality journalism, but we don't have radically different business models to support journalism in 2018.		‚Ä¢ The best time for action was 1980. The second best time is TODAY.
29 - News orgs have to fix their payment and subscription models for this to work. 		So, we've come full circle!
28 - So you have some options. 		1. If you can afford to pay for news, you should.		2. If you can afford to pay for your news and someone else's news, you should.		3. If you can afford to defray the cost of producing news for your community, you should.		However...
27 - Last stakeholder group: humans living in America.		This is easy. It's time to start paying for your news. Your insistence that news is always free is part of how we got to now. 		To be fair, not everyone can afford a subscription to the NYT or WSJ. I get that.
26 - To the hedgies, PE firms, VCs and boards of newspapers:		By slashing and burning America's newspapers, you're putting your future financial positions at dire risk. If you want to keep making the profit that I think you have a right to earn, you need to stop.
25 - But here's an argument you might actually listen to. Business likes stability. Unless you're *that* kind of investor, you don't like unpredictable volatility.		The best way to ensure volatility is to take away quality journalism within a community. Or a country.
24 - If you're a successful investor in real estate, fin-tech, pharma, tech...  that doesn't necessarily make you a successful investor and steward of a news media business. You're coming in with zero context. Your spreadsheets don't translate.
23 - NEWSPAPERS ARE NOT THE SAME FUCKING THING AS BASEBALL TEAMS.
22 - So it turns out that I actually know quite a bit about baseball, because I grew up in the stands at Wrigley. I indulged his analogy, explaining that most teams have a number of pitchers and other players because of injuries, strategy, and rotation needs... but mostly...
21 - I once heard a board member liken a newsroom to a baseball team. He said, and I'm paraphrasing here...		"You only need 9 guys on the field at once, so you don't need a roster with 50 guys to make a newspaper." https://t.co/GmegqVpMdw
20 - I'm specifically talking now about the boards of @tronc, MediaNews Group, New Media Investment Group... and those individuals who are major shareholders.		You have a fiduciary duty to your boards. And you have a moral responsibility to the citizens of the United States.
19 - Now, to the funders (VCs, PE firms, hedgies). 		I know you want to make money. You have a right to make a profit. I want you to make that profit. 		But I want you to do all of that while thinking critically about whether that money will matter 30 years from now.
18 - Last thing for Grantmakers: Pay for newsroom managers to get MBAs (full or exec). 		Better yet, establish an MBA program that combines traditional MBA coursework with emerging technology and journalism.
17 - And THEN, fund the next iterations of R&amp;D, testing, and deployment of those business models. Because the future is constantly in flux.		The problem is that there's been too much funding into storytelling formats and products. None towards this kind of work.
16 - Fund newsrooms to test those models. This process should take 2 years. 		Then -- importantly -- fund scaling those models across other orgs.
15 - Grantmakers, during that time, do the following:		‚Ä¢ Convene newsroom managers, up-and-comers, and high-quality, smart, biz execs w/ a successful track record who genuinely want to help. Have them do the R&amp;D and develop radically different models for testing.
14 - Grantmakers: it's time to pony up operational funding, even if that contradicts your charters and rules. Give newsrooms some breathing room for the next 2 years.
13 - So here's what needs to happen across those constituent groups. 		We no longer have the luxury of time. You can't wait until next year's conference for inspiration.
12 - But the time to take action on all of this was three decades ago. 		If you think the past two weeks are an anomaly, or that you won't see more of the same in the coming year, you have your head in the sand.
11 - Now more than ever in modern human history, we need quality journalism.		Now more than ever, we need quality journalists.		Now more than ever, we need trustworthy, actionable, informative news. https://t.co/yyCTKFLEPW
10 - While everyone acknowledges that the business model has been dying since the 1980s, little has been done to radically change the business model for news.		Meantime, newspapers ceded distribution to third parties like Twitter, FB, Google, YouTube, and (God help us) Snap.
9 -		‚Ä¢ Universities aren't mandating that communications students learn basic business fundamentals.		‚Ä¢ Cities -- which ostensibly want quality news orgs to inform their constituents during this time of widespread misinformation -- aren't helping in any way.
8 - Here's what's happening:		‚Ä¢ Grantmakers aren't throwing their weight behind the research, development, and piloting radically new business models. 		‚Ä¢ News orgs don't have any humans left, let alone $$, to research, develop and pilot radically new biz models.
7 - The @chicagotribune also announced massive layoffs yesterday. I would urge you to read @davidfolkenflik's very smart take and explanation here -- and to listen to it as well.	 	https://t.co/qK037bGcsh
6 - The @DenverPost's union pleaded with the hedgie owners, asking them to sell the paper rather than slowly decimate it.		https://t.co/knJqTHCnU4
5 - The @DenverPost was forced by its hedgie owners to lay off 30% of its staff yesterday. That's after massive layoffs last year.		https://t.co/t8p6KplUpu
4 - "A company with a reputation for downsizing newspapers takes over Texas‚Äôs capital city publication"		Cox Media Group made inscrutable investments into social platforms and video without running implication scenarios.		https://t.co/wV5vqV1SDw
3 - The past few weeks have been brutal. Mass layoffs, consolidation, and announcements about dubious new job titles. 		These are more signals that, I fear, have been falling on deaf ears. To wit:
2 - Some of you were at #ONA17 and at the recent @knightfdn Media Forum, and you heard my catastrophic scenarios for the near-future of news. These weren't predictions. I don't make predictions.		These were plausible data-driven models showing where we were headed.
1 - Journalists, foundations that fund journalism, publishers, city officials, venture capitalists/ hedgies who've bought news orgs, and people who care about democracy, we need to have a chat this morning.		Like, right now.

Creative people: use @FTI‚Äôs tech trends to make our future more human-centered. We need you! #TechTrends2018
Government people: use @FTI‚Äôs tech trends to AVOID writing policy and regulations under duress  #TechTrends2018
Business people: use @FTI‚Äôs tech trends to build strategy and make smarter strategic decisions and investments in 2018  #TechTrends2018
The good news is that we still have time to influence these scenarios. We‚Äôre not @WestworldHBO hosts - we have agency.  #TechTrends2018
Here come your final set of scenarios. These are more speculative - 25 years out - but they‚Äôre still rooted in evidence.  #TechTrends2018
We should remember that AI is a thread throughout this biotech trend section - with autonomy playing an important role  #TechTrends2018
This is a reminder that trends evolve over time. This autonomous robo-DNA research from Caltech is from 2010 ‚Äî nearly a decade ago.  #TechTrends2018
CRISPR and other editing techniques will continue to be a hot area of funding and growth over the next few years  #TechTrends2018
The biotech section of this year‚Äôs @FTI Trend Report is robust ‚Äî there‚Äôs a lot of research there for you  #TechTrends2018
Trend clusters: molecular robotics, biological DVRs, nano-scale ingestibles, CRISPR, genomic editing, comprehensive human cell atlas  #TechTrends2018
Key Finding Three: Biology is emerging as the most important technology platform of the 21st century. #TechTrends2018
Let‚Äôs see how these AI trends evolve over the next 15 years. Here are some scenarios for 2033.  #TechTrends2018
I urge you to get familiar with the GDPR when you have a moment. https://t.co/wMAiAzBkiG  #TechTrends2018
Another trend for 2018: widespread consolidation in the AI ecosystem. #TechTrends2018
These are what I call The Big 9 ‚Äî the companies who control the future of artificial intelligence  #TechTrends2018
Tangent: you all realize this is happening, right? https://t.co/bUJHEJOynY  #TechTrends2018

In this year‚Äôs @FTI Tech Trends Report, there are 27 trends in the AI section alone. We also included a non-technical primer to help you get ahead. #TechTrends2018
AI is the next ‚Äî or 3rd ‚Äî era of computing.  #TechTrends2018
AI is more than a tech trend. #TechTrends2018
When it comes to AI, there‚Äôs a tremendous amount of misplaced optimism and fear. #TechTrends2018
Tangent: @WestworldHBO is my favorite show ever. It does a spectacular job telling the story of AI as it might unfold. #TechTrends2018
We‚Äôre surrounded by ANI - your car, your email, the plane you took to get to SXSW  #TechTrends2018
Trends in this cluster: adversarial ML, generative adversarial networks, machine reading comprehension, multitask learning  #TechTrends2018
Key Finding Two: AI is already here. It just didn‚Äôt show up as we all expected. #TechTrends2018
After building those scenarios, I typically assign a probabilistic model to indicate the confidence level we have. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre seeing  #TechTrends2018
These are evidence-based scenarios, not sci-fi. #TechTrends2018
As part of my forecasting methodology, I develop scenarios using four emotive framings: optimistic, pragmatic, pessimistic and catastrophic  #TechTrends2018
Ok, so let‚Äôs see how this trend cluster plays out in the year 2028  #TechTrends2018
I‚Äôm happy to share this slide showing our projected AR growth scenario trajectories with you after ‚Äî it‚Äôs not in our annual report.  #TechTrends2018
If you‚Äôve not yet heard of Face++, you‚Äôre not alone. They‚Äôve been quietly becoming one of the most important players in AI  #TechTrends2018
That‚Äôs research from CSAIL  #TechTrends2018
So again, this is why you can‚Äôt track tech trends in a vacuum. You need to look at them as nodes and see how they relate to other trends  #TechTrends2018
Here‚Äôs the generative techniques NEC is working on in Japan: https://t.co/H12j8uTCts  #TechTrends2018
Here‚Äôs the academic paper I‚Äôm referencing: https://t.co/HS8cPhsimr  #TechTrends2018
In addition to Voiceprints, we‚Äôre also tracking Faceprints.  #TechTrends2018
Your voice divulges way more about you than you probably realize. Used with AI, your voice becomes a powerful tool. #TechTrends2018
Voiceprints are another interesting technology we‚Äôve been tracking. #TechTrends2018
MRC is important, because it lays the groundwork for our future conversations with machines. #TechTrends2018
Here‚Äôs that Machine Reading Comprehension paper (PDF): https://t.co/hdyprdUbpE  #TechTrends2018
MRC may not seem momentous to you, but it‚Äôs a lot more complicated than it looks. And massively important to what follows. #TechTrends2018
.@FTI‚Äôs model shows that 50% of people industrialized nations who interact with computers will use voice by 2021. #TechTrends2018
Within the next 10 years, conversational interfaces and non-visual UIs will enter the mainstream.  #TechTrends2018
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Bixby.  #TechTrends2018
For the first time, the global sales of smartphones have peaked. This is something that @FTI forecast two years ago. #TechTrends2018
Ah, nostalgia. Who remembers burning music to Minidiscs? Or the Nokia 5110?  #TechTrends2018
Tech Trends in this cluster: NUIs, digital assistants, MR and AR, Faceprints, Voiceprints and generative algorithms  #TechTrends2018
Key Finding One: 2018 is the beginning of the end of smartphones.  #TechTrends2018
At the end of each trend section, I‚Äôm going to spin out plausible scenarios for the near future.  #TechTrends2018
I‚Äôm going to share 15 of the trends from this year‚Äôs report with you ‚Äî they fit into 3 clusters  #TechTrends2018
Anyhow, you get my point. So let‚Äôs move on to key findings from @FTI‚Äôs 2018 report. #TechTrends2018
Behold! The Emerging Trends Cycle of Opportunity! #TechTrends2018
What you‚Äôre seeing on the screen is just a tiny fraction of the crypto futures landscape.  #TechTrends2018
Which is why I‚Äôm wondering about all the exuberance around cryptos‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a technology with A LOT of dependencies and variables.  #TechTrends2018
You‚Äôll see that some trends have been on the list for many years. That‚Äôs because they evolve as they emerge. #TechTrends2018
The @FTI Trend Report has 6 key pieces of information for each trend. #TechTrends2018
I open sourced our complete methodology last year, and I encourage you to use it and build on it. #TechTrends2018
This work is done to calculate risk and opportunity, so that our @FTI clients can develop new/ existing business units and make better strategic decisions. #TechTrends2018
Then we build data-driven models for possible, plausible and probable futures scenarios. #TechTrends2018
Trends themselves aren't the end goal. Our job is to make CONNECTIONS between the trends. #TechTrends2018
Then use tools to analyze patterns so that we can spot emerging trends. #TechTrends2018
We first identify weak signals at the fringe. #TechTrends2018
What kind of data we use ‚Äî quantitative vs qualitative ‚Äî depends on the technology we‚Äôre forecasting. #TechTrends2018
.@FTI uses a data-driven process that relies heavily on evidence and pattern recognition. We do some of it by hand, and some of the work aided by machine learning systems.  #TechTrends2018
Just a few notes on the methodology we use to surface and track trends, then I‚Äôll reveal what‚Äôs in this year‚Äôs report. #TechTrends2018
To escape the cycle of doom, you have to continually track emerging tech trends #TechTrends2018
But in my experience, this is what that cycle tends to look like in practice. #TechTrends2018
This cycle of doom is describes many companies and senior leaders. #TechTrends2018
Failing to distinguish between trend and trendy - and then taking action on the real trend - is how so many senior leadership teams miss big events in tech. #TechTrends2018
Because of all the noise and change, you‚Äôre likely to misclassify an emerging tech trend as a meaningless outlier. That‚Äôs a mistake. #TechTrends2018
1-they‚Äôre driven by basic human needs; 2-they‚Äôre timely but they persist over long periods of time; 3-they evolve as they emerge and‚Ä¶  #TechTrends2018
Why do trends matter? Because they‚Äôre signposts on the way to the future. Real tech trends usually have four characteristics  #TechTrends2018
With so much disruption and change, it‚Äôs difficult to distinguish between trend and trendy.  #TechTrends2018
Go back and tell the 2008 version of yourself that in 10 years that Kodak -- yes, THAT Kodak -- would try to make it big in the cryptocurrency market with an ICO. #TechTrends2018
ICOs are the new IPOs #TechTrends2018
Futurists practice elastic thinking. We look back and forward simultaneously. It‚Äôs been a strange year. #TechTrends2018
You‚Äôre going to get a copy to download at the end. I‚Äôve also brought some copies of the coveted, book version to share.  #TechTrends2018

14-Los Angelenos deserve better. The journalists who worked hard to make it to the @latimes deserve better.		Further reading: https://t.co/EmkmIEsGoP		https://t.co/X2s2UH5Gth
13-And that's the real problem with this whole mess. Sustaining quality journalism requires one or more radically different business models.		Radically different business models need to be theorized, studied, piloted and analyzed first.
12-How deeply depressing it is to know that Tronc's board was so easily swayed and distracted by buzzwords and the promise of business-saving patents, which I'm thinking the voting members probably didn't read.
11-It's exciting, and I suppose fashionable again, to own a media property. Tronc's anxiety about the future coupled with Soon-Shiong's presumed media imposter syndrome were likely an inauspicious combo. 		$ + buzzwords = hope
10-One might also see this as Ferro and Tronc's board members not using the skeptical, higher-order reasoning that's a hallmark of great journalists... 		...the journalists they presumably thought that "machine vision" would soon replace in pursuit of 2,000 AI videos a day?
9-It's also worth noting that a lot of the patents everyone at Tronc was so excited about were filed in 2013 - 2015. Given the publicly-available information about Soon-Shiong, the optics here aren't good. 		One might see this as his way of buying a seat on the board.
8-There's a patent for digital payments and subscriptions, but again, nothing that's so forward-looking and so concrete that it would be a strategic advantage for newspapers or Tronc. (Unless the plan was to go full patent troll and sue others for infringement.)
7-Some of the patents have to do with object recognition -- but anything that might be extrapolated from them is already being done (and done better) by Google, Microsoft and Magic Leap.
6-I read the patents at the beginning of all this, a few years ago. There was nothing I saw that made good, sound, durable business sense to the future of Tronc in those patents, unless the plan was to sue others for infringement and reinvest the winnings into the newspapers.
5-A lot of the initial excitement about Soon-Shiong had to do with his "AI patents."		From @Adweek:  "But efforts to use the doctor‚Äôs [machine vision patents] have long since fizzled, insiders say" https://t.co/vuFFjHEHuy
4-Now technically, these are all words. "machine vision..." "machine learning..." "artificial intelligence..."		However, to paraphrase the immortal words of Inigo Montoya: Tronc board executives keep using those words. I do not think they mean what the board thinks they mean. https://t.co/A3OY5AHXJH
3-At the same time, Soon-Shiong was a new Tronc board member and vice chair, and he was making inscrutable promises about "machine vision technology" to journalism. The idea: to use an "invention" he "designed" to connect print newspaper readers to the website.
2-Two years ago Tronc chair Michael Ferro was making wild, ridiculous claims about artificial intelligence. Not the stuff about publishing 2,000 AI-generated videos a day... though that was indeed ridiculous and demonstrated a fundamental lack of foresight into digital media.

Humans are being horrible to each other here in America. And in too many places around the world to count. 		We can choose not to be horrible. Xenophobia, homophobia, racism and hate are like viruses‚Äì‚Äìcontagious, costly, deadly. And preventable. #HolocaustMemorialDay
I hope you'll take a few moments today to remember that while humans can be horrible to each other, we also have the capacity to be generous, kind, and inclusive. #HolocaustMemorialDay
More than anything, we learned powerful lessons of resilience. 		And of #resistance.		#HolocaustMemorialDay
And so we studied...hard. We practiced. We learned. We pushed. We were taught that the future would be nothing if we didn't remember, always, remember, the past. #HolocaustMemorialDay
The people with numbers on their arms didn't teach us to hate in return. 		We were taught that no matter what comes, no matter what others might try to take away, they can never take away an education. #HolocaustMemorialDay

The Trump Administration may be in denial of climate change and the catastrophic agricultural, national security, economic and human migration scenarios that could result.		But state and local governments can and should do long-term planning on their own.
Climate change will lead to climate refugees, who we will send away when they arrive asking for help. Cape Town isn't the only crisis zone. In a few years, 20% of Bangladesh will likely be under water. They'll be refugees in their own country.
No, it will bring out the worst in us. Because when we're faced with something so basic--like water--being taken away suddenly, we won't be able to cope.
Environmental crisis won't bring humanity together. Poitical enemies won't rally and become allies like in Independence Day.
This is a cautionary tale for us all. Our weather patterns are changing. Our climate is changing. Local and national governments need to do scenario planning now...and develop "what if" contingency plans.
Cape Town has been in the middle of a severe drought. City residents didn't all take water rationing seriously. Now, they're left waiting for rain, which peibably won't be enough.
It would be the Earth's first modern major city to lose its water supply. A city and its citizens cannot function without potable water.
Meanwhile, Cape Town has fewer than 100 days until it completely runs out of water. #DayZero	 https://t.co/qarR3wqMit

@TWiT I was a 20th Century American kid, and I grew up with a constant barrage of ads, classes and programming to teach me about AIDS, STDs and the dangers of drugs.		Of course, a lot of the campaigns backfired. But overall, we got the message.
@TWiT 21st Century American kids haven't developed the digital street smarts they need. 		Included here are: digital literacy/ fake news; keeping phones safe from malware, adware, spyware; knowing what's at stake when you share your biodata (fingerprints, faceprints, etc)
@TWiT My fear is that without advance planning, if something bad happens we'll wind up with a dramatic, public fight pitting Silicon Valley against Washington... as the problem spreads. 		But I have a worse fear for our future.
@TWiT It isn't just about monitoring. And it isn't just about cybersecurity alone. We need something like the CDC that takes a more comprehensive approach. 		It's about getting the public informed quickly, and setting up the networks and systems that can act quickly.

@TWiT Emerging biotech and fintech won't behave exactly as intended, producing second and third-order impacts that are both positive and negative.		The US must get more sophisticated in its approach to monitoring tech systems.
@TWiT We're going to see more complex security vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre -- not less. 		Soon, our technology will be tested by unpredictable, erratic climate changes.
@TWiT Four years ago, I wrote about the future, and our impending need for a government agency to manage our nation‚Äôs tech health. In short, a CDC for tech:		https://t.co/1KNRD9nOht
@TWiT US-CERT, for all the good it does, simply doesn't have the same level of public visibility as the CDC.		Be honest: how many of you'd heard of US-CERT before now? I'm guessing not many.
@TWiT US-CERT doesn't focus comprehensively on all intersections of technology and everyday work/ life in the U.S. It doesn't collaborate with similar agencies outside America.		And also...
@TWiT While we do have the US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (which is part of the DHS), and it does put out useful information on security vulnerabilities, it isn't also doing basic research. 		https://t.co/iiKvWeZEta		And also.....
On this week's @TWiT I made the case that technology impacts our public health and national security -- so we will soon need a CDC-like center that helps educate the public and our government officials.		https://t.co/54NcYu38qD

@SouthwestAir So I'm noticing that a bunch of pilots are boarding on this sudden unscheduled stop. Does Southwest have a fleet management problem? Again, something folks might want to know before they book their  flights for the holiday travel season.
Still waiting for a response to the DM you requested, @SouthwestAir. Meanwhile your crew didn't communicate, so a bunch of the passengers we're now picking up in Ohio can't bring suitcases on board because there's no room. Which is delaying us further.
@SouthwestAir I just did and I'd like a prompt response
I'm on this flight too, @SouthwestAir https://t.co/IhMbL3ujXh
@SouthwestAir That's a non-response. Since when does Southwest jocky planes and passengers like this? It'd be good for folks to know going into the holiday season that Southwest might randomly change their flights without any notice or compensation.
@SouthwestAir Really disgusted with @SouthwestAir today.
@SouthwestAir Correction: it's flight 1308. You have a plane full of angry passengers who will unnecessarily miss connections and more.
@SouthwestAir It also breaks the TOS with the passengers who booked this nonstop flight. You're now delaying all the MDW &gt; BWI passengers significantly and doing absolutely nothing for us, in order to solve a problem for a different group of people.
Hi @SouthwestAir. I'm on flight 1380 from MDW and we've been told, before leaving, that we're now making a pit stop in Cleveland to pick up some customers. That effectively strands a whole bunch of people on this flight.

17 - Education matters to our future. It must be made more affordable to all Americans. 		Take a minute today to call or email your elected member of Congress. Here's how to get a hold of them: https://t.co/klqnu4BXv3		-end-
16 - But if we continue down this path, we will see a new set of global superpowers emerge within a generation. Within your lifetime. 		And America WILL NOT be one of them.
15 - An educated electorate is strong workforce. An educated country innovates, solves challenges, gives rise to new businesses, supports new jobs, makes the economy strong, and creates the creature comforts we all want.
14 - For the moment, putting undergraduate and graduate students in the middle of a political crossfire does no one any good.
13 - The tax legislation is a problem. Tuition at American universities is a problem. But mostly, our collective lack of foresight -- connecting the dots, to see how future scenarios will play out as a result of our actions today -- is a big, ugly problem.
12 - Because schools won't suddenly reduce their fees in response to cuts. What will wind up happening is that wealthy kids from other countries will fill those seats. Which puts American kids at a further disadvantage and jeopardizes our future competitive edge globally.
11 - Congress doesn't understand the value proposition of an education to the future of a strong, resilient, productive economy. Yes, schools are absolutely charging too much. But the way forward isn't to make provocative cuts.
10 - I would hardly call my undergraduate experience "elite." And I'm certainly not arguing that a traditional 4-year university is the best course for every American kid.		But these tax proposals would make college more expensive for low- and middle-income families.
9 - Here's what Congress doesn't seem to understand. The future of any country depends on an educated electorate. The GOP seems to think that "education" is synonymous with "elite."
8 - At Oxford, one of the world's top universities, students are paying $12k a year, all inclusive.		Once you factor in tuition, room and board and books, the STATE school I attended costs TWICE as much. Roughly $22k.
7 - My experience is not the experience kids in Sweden, Norway or Finland have. In those countries, students don't have to pay for their education.
6 - So I dropped out of the music school, switched my major to economics and political science, and worked two jobs during the school year and three during the summer to pay for tuition. I went to a state university. Not a fancy, high-end, "elite" college.
5 - Like many of the kids I grew up with, I needed a low-interest loan to fill in the gap. 		I never wanted to be a professional musician, and I was taking up one of only 6 seats. I constantly felt guilty for taking someone else's spot.
4 - I worked my ass off in middle school and high school, earning good grades, extra money and practicing music. I wound up with a significant scholarship to attend a prestigious music school, which was embedded within our state university. But that still wasn't enough.
3 - There was never a question that I would someday graduate from college, but how to pay for my education was a question I heard over and over from elementary school. My parents scrimped and saved for me and for my sister.
2 - I am the first person with my last name to go to college. My dad is brilliant, but he grew up in a family forced to supplement what little they could earn with subsistence farming.
1 - Good morning. I'd like to share something about myself that not many people know, because I think it could add some texture to the current debate about tax cuts and reforms. I'd really appreciate it if you read through to the end of this thread.

In the ‚Äô90s, one-hour color film processing, single-use cameras, videotape camcorders, and digital cameras pushed instant film to the side.
By the 1980s, instant film was in decline as better cameras and one-hour photo developing booths popped up around the world.
Patent wars ensued. Kodak assigned up to 1,400 researchers to try dozens of instant-photo techniques, according to court documents.
In the 1970s, Kodak released its own camera and instant film. At that point, Kodak was 7x the size of Polaroid.
They got free studio time and film in exchange for their photography. Here's more from the Boston Globe:		https://t.co/ft3XqdHHoZ https://t.co/rd2uszZ3Ys
In the late '60s, Polaroid recruited the world‚Äôs best-known photographers--Adams, Wegman, Warhol--for a clever marketing campaign.
...it charged $1 for each sheet of film sales, resulting in massive profit margins. For a while, Polaroid was without competition.
Polaroid‚Äôs invention of instant photography created a new business line that didn‚Äôt just sell cameras...
The pic was already developed in the camera. You're just watching the film's acid layer remove the white opacifiers--a chemical reaction.
This story has great technical details on how the magic of instant polaroid film works: https://t.co/K6cREshUTs https://t.co/H3ipw5Fsyc
Fun fact: you know how you have to wait around for the film to "develop," as the all-white sheet reveals the photo? Actually...
The "instant" development happens within the reagent level, which holds many different chemicals including blockers and neutralizers.
Noticed a bump at the top of the image border? That's spent chemicals that've been spread across the film by the camera‚Äôs internal rollers
The layers are then squeezed between a bottom black base layer and four additional top layers: the acid, timing, image, and reagent layers
When the sheets are exposed to light through the camera lens, photons react with the layers and leave a record behind--the image.
The color layers sit on top of a developer layer that contains dye couplers that attach to non-exposed areas of the image...
Land kept tweaking the camera and the film, eventually creating integral instant color film sheets.
Polaroid didn't plan for success. They made only 60 units of the 95, which sold out instantaneously. ;-)
They have multiple color layers which are each sensitive to different parts of the color spectrum. https://t.co/7bHO647a1j
Land's camera used two separate positive and negative rolls, allowing the photograph to be developed inside the camera. https://t.co/UoA0ymltwD
He didn't have an answer, and as a scientist he wanted to investigate. When he returned home, Land set about developing a new kind of film https://t.co/UB4wEdTC2f
In 1948, his invention -- a camera that used instant film -- hit the marketplace as the Polaroid Land Model 95 camera. https://t.co/SeVuL8WMsE
She asked what turned out to be a life-changing question: Why couldn't she see the photo right away?
In the mid-1940s, scientist Edwin Land was on vacation and took a photo of his 3-year-old daughter.

...that we need paid learning leave. A few weeks a year to learn something new. And to pursue curiosity. Not just technical/ code.
Seems like we'd all be better off committing to structured learning throughout our lives. I'm thinking...
We've time-boxed learning in a reality where time is fluid and the variables of life keep changing.
I understand the benefit of uninterrupted, concentrated research time. For most people though, our current system doesn't really make sense
That assumes that technogy, work, culture and society are static... Frozen on graduation day. That really seems strange.
It's so strange that we concentrate learning into 4 years. Or 6-8 years including grad school. Then the expectation is that we're done.

But new technologies ‚Äì‚Äì headbands, wristbands, embeddable and ingestible nanobots ‚Äì‚Äì will soon change how we manipulate our brains.
Up until now, we've primarily relied on pharmaceutical neurotransmitters, like Celexa, Prozac, Lexapro, Paxil, or Zoloft.
That‚Äôs why the standard practice is to start with a base dose, and adjust it higher or lower over a period of months.
Not only do we not know how, exactly, neurotransmitters work, we don‚Äôt even know what dose to administer.
The problem? There isn't any concrete evidence to back up this theory. So we've kept manipulating neurotransmitters for the past 50 years.
That early finding became the basis for the core of modern psychiatry: that depression is caused by a ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù in the brain.
Soon, scientists knew enough about the brain to suggest that Iproniazid and Raudixin were changing the brain‚Äôs levels of serotonin.
... after being prescribed a drug called Raudixin to control blood pressure.
Meanwhile, few 100m away, doctors had taken notice of some patients who suddenly complained of feeling lethargic, hopeless, and depressed..
Doctors noticed that patients treated with iproniazid suddenly transformed from sullen and despondent to happy and energized. https://t.co/nZfrXTHFsX
It proved to a be better therapy than the previous drugs used, but did not control the intense tissue death in the lungs.....		But!
In the early 1950s, doctors working at Sea View Hospital on Staten Island were treating tubercular patients with a drug called iproniazid.

#DevLearn folks -- yesterday on my flight home I added a bunch of resources (specific to learning and algorithms) to your Dropbox folder.
Pro tip: When I share a Dropbox folder at a conference, the folder stays active. I add to it as I find things you should read/ watch.

@ChiTribGraphics I wonder if the cancer rates are higher on the southside / NW Indiana than elsewhere. So many people I grew up with died from rare cancers.

Really good investigative work by the @ChiTribGraphics team and all the reporters who worked on the project. Thanks for your effort.

@pilhofer @howardowens Dooo it!
@pilhofer @howardowens Ok, so here's a proposal for you. Let's do something for just one day at Temple. Start off with a debate, then small sessions to discuss
@pilhofer @howardowens It would probably be worthwhile to have a public discussion about all this -- maybe some kind of hangout?
@pilhofer @howardowens Absolutely there is! My concern is what I'm seeing outside of journalism.
@pilhofer @howardowens It wouldn't surprise me because I knew that.
@pilhofer @howardowens Well, that depends on the newsroom. But for what your fmr employer spent on VR it could have spent on R&amp;D in news biz models
@pilhofer @howardowens So we agree on the real prob: paywall experiments &amp; ad products rather than distribution, radically diff't biz models, etc. What do we do?
@pilhofer @howardowens (BTW, I‚Äôm not casually throwing out VR. It‚Äôs intentionally aggressive. I think money would be better spent elsewhere right now.)
@pilhofer @howardowens Yes. This has to do w/:		‚Ä¢ lack of serious planning	‚Ä¢ not using forecasting models	‚Ä¢ making big rather than incrementals decisions		But!
@pilhofer @howardowens We're in this situation now because not enough substantive work was done to radically rethink business model during the early internet
@pilhofer @howardowens I completely agree with you, and on the storytelling, too. What I'm saying is that execs are not engaged with building out distribution
@howardowens Because they shouldn't be fiddling around with drones. They should be figuring out how to make money once voice interfaces are everywhere.
@howardowens And yet that's no excuse...
7. What I've read is not the way forward. It describes the past.
6. Because in the coming era of voice, zero-UI and AI, there will be no newsroom of the future without meaningful changes today.
5. Like every news organization, the AP must get serious about the future. And it must take significant action.
4. The AP was only willing to look out five years -- and it hired a firm for design thinking, rather than quantitative foresight.
3. What I'm reading in the report is evidence of the catastrophic framings I described at #ONA17.
1. All of the recommendations should have been in the works five years ago. 		2. Only looking ahead five years in news is a huge mistake.

@pgreenberger Enabling and promoting the unencumbered spread of misinformation undermines the goals of "democratization," no?
@pgreenberger That was not a compliment to Twitter. It was a comment on a grave problem we're facing.
I hope when you have some time this week, you'll read through both reports. They're intended for everyone working in tech and media.
+ a Global Survey on Journalism's Futures. It's a sobering look at how journalists are thinking about the future.		https://t.co/YWdOZSYFTl https://t.co/iRlqfotCld

RT @mitsmr: Futurist Amy Webb believes that everyone should learn and use the tools of a #futurist. https://t.co/dGU8wKsCaH @amywebb @Futur‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs all from me! I‚Äôll be around today to chat/ discuss/ debate/ ideate. Ping me to meet up. #ONA17Trends
If you weren‚Äôt able to get a free copy of my book Signals, you can find it here: https://t.co/U5ZkCPL3l8  #ONA17Trends
Here‚Äôs the dropbox link again: https://t.co/UdzetykPKl #ONA17Trends
YOU can go out and write the future of news for all of us. #ONA17Trends
My hope is that I‚Äôve motivated and encouraged you to start tracking trends on your own. You can do it! #ONA17Trends
Everything is in this Dropbox folder for you: https://t.co/UdzetykPKl  #ONA17Trends
Final surprise: As of today, I‚Äôve open-sourced all my tools and all of my IP. You‚Äôll find everything in the folder.  #ONA17Trends
As journalists, you are uniquely positioned to do this work and to think like a futurist.  #ONA17Trends
Which means not chasing after the latest shiny object. But instead, methodically listening for signals. #ONA17Trends
YOU have the power to create the future you want. But you must become early ADAPTERS. #ONA17Trends
The good news: these scenarios haven‚Äôt happened yet. There are lots of variables still in play.  #ONA17Trends
I‚Äôm a pragmatist. I believe that we can still achieve the optimistic framings. But it will take a collective effort. #ONA17Trends
ICYMI: Here‚Äôs the link to download the full 2018 Tech Trends For Journalism and Media Report: https://t.co/W4wWaVX0on  #ONA17Trends
Final set of scenarios...  #ONA17Trends

This explains how we got to now.  #ONA17Trends
So now let‚Äôs layer all the trends and clusters together  #ONA17Trends
Dozens of industries are all experimenting with blockchain for verification. And yet...  #ONA17Trends
In the Dropbox folder I‚Äôve put some great analysis about splinternets  #ONA17Trends
If this were to happen, journalism would flow differently through each splinternet‚Äôs geographic boundaries. #ONA17Trends
And this is what our fractured internet could look like by 2027: a series of regional splinternets.  #ONA17Trends
This map shows countries with cases/ regulatory policy pending against Google, Facebook and/or Twitter  #ONA17Trends
Within the next 10 years, these platforms and distributors will face government regulation. #ONA17Trends
Max Read asks very good questions about what Facebook is, exactly, in the beginning of this piece: https://t.co/rPCWaCew9Y  #ONA17Trends
Twitter is our 21st century wire service. Everyone with an account can create and distribute news. #ONA17Trends
Our modern distribution systems were built for speed, not accuracy in reporting. #ONA17Trends
Speed is incongruous with quality, especially in this era of machine learning. #ONA17Trends
Basic question #3: Why should journalists care about the future access to quality news? #ONA17Trends
Final trend cluster has to do with access and authentication #ONA17Trends
So, how do these trends pan out by the year 2027? #ONA17Trends
Here‚Äôs the Univ of Washington research on synthesizing Obama: https://t.co/uKChA1thKr  #ONA17Trends
That‚Äôs more research from CSAIL  #ONA17Trends
So let‚Äôs connect the first cluster to this trend cluster. #ONA17Trends
Politwoops from @ProPublica is clever and serves a strong public purpose: https://t.co/Kpbn6wTeJ9  #ONA17Trends
More on Lyrebird AI: https://t.co/jbEp6WJzab  #ONA17Trends
This shouldn‚Äôt come as a shock to you: those big 9 companies are the same ones dominating voice interfaces. #ONA17Trends
Once again, I‚Äôd urge you to consider how news orgs are sustainable once we‚Äôre talking to computers.  #ONA17Trends
Once we‚Äôre in a zero-UI setting, consumers might have a difficult time figuring out where their news is coming from.  #ONA17Trends
Within the next 10 years, conversational interfaces and zero-UIs will enter the mainstream.  #ONA17Trends
MRC is important, because it lays the groundwork for our future conversations with machines. #ONA17Trends
Here‚Äôs that Machine Reading Comprehension paper (PDF): https://t.co/hdyprebMOe  #ONA17Trends
Let‚Äôs look at all the possible non-obvious reasons why. #ONA17Trends
Basic question: why should journalists care about the future of voice interfaces? #ONA17Trends
Now I‚Äôll move on to trends having to do with the future of voice interfaces.  #ONA17Trends
Side note: it‚Äôs helpful to use different emotive framings for scenarios. Helps mitigate cognitive bias. #ONA17Trends
Now I‚Äôm going to show you some scenarios that show how these trends play out over the next 10 years. #ONA17Trends
Both these glasses and rings are conceptual -- they don‚Äôt exist yet. #ONA17Trends
For the past three years at ONA, I‚Äôve been talking about the importance of AR. #ONA17Trends
Let me make this abundantly clear: we are teaching ML systems to recognize stereotypes  #ONA17Trends
Here‚Äôs the ‚Äúgaydar‚Äù paper, which I encourage you to read later: https://t.co/fcCovg6v8c  #ONA17Trends
