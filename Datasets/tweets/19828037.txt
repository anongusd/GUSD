Bottom line: @JacobOgles gave up a Saturday to crank out four stories about the rescinded appointments based on a tip from a source no one else had. If nothing else, Jacob deserves credit for that. 		And I won't ever stop fighting for my reporters.
#FlaPol got this story because of our cultivation of sources within the admin. 		There's just as much reason to suspect this news would not have gotten out had we not reported it as there is to say it would have. 		The timing of the reporting helped shape the narrative.
Because this wasn't just a case of the admin rolling out a press release &amp; @Fla_Pol getting it up first. 		In fact ‚Äî &amp; here comes the real reason this is important ‚Äî https://t.co/HigqBBpJSx
Second, Spear &amp; Co are literally investigators. When they write their stories, they should investigate if other outlets had the news first. 		I do every time I write. There's no excuse otherwise, because...		This story did not happen in a vacuum!
But wait, what if @KevinSpear or the other reporters learned of the rescinded appointments separate of @Fla_Pol? Maybe they didn't even know @Fla_Pol reported on them. 		First of all, Google. https://t.co/WbrZBoB9xf
.@KevinSpear offered none of the attribution that his colleague did. 		This happened a lot on Monday morning, when reporters rolled up to the office and learned that boards in their community were impacted by the Gov's decision. 		Some credited @Fla_Pol reporting, most did not.
... Gray's colleague, @KevinSpear wrote about how @GovRonDeSantis rescinded the appointment of water board chair John Miklos 48 hours AFTER @Fla_Pol broke the overall story about the rescinded appointments &amp; wrote a specific story about Miklos. https://t.co/dGJlob46OX
The @OrlandoSentinel's @GrayRohrer writes a fresh story on the crisis at UCF. 		Even though he bring a new perspective to the story, he RIGHTLY credits @WFTV for first reporting the item, even though the gap between the stories is a few hours. 		Good job, Gray. 		BUT... https://t.co/3T8btO9LkM
Some people wonder why I spar with some in Florida's legacy/traditional media. And some, including friends and allies, wish I didn't, thinking it probably doesn't do me much good. 		They're probably right, BUT...		Here is a good example of why I get upset:

Ron DeSantis agreed to take this all under consideration and his transition team got the office space. 		But when DeSantis transition announced that someone else was going to lead DEO, that was another turning point. &amp; that's when Scott really bared his fangs.		To be continued...
At that meeting and in subsequent meetings between Scott, DeSantis and their chief advisers, Susie Wiles, transition chairs, and Brad Pipenbrink, @ScottforFlorida made it clear that he wanted @GovRonDeSantis to keep on:		Cissy Proctor at DEO	Julie Jones at DOC	staffer John Tupps
.@GovRonDeSantis, of course, went to meet with Scott. I'm told he flew to Naples on the Sunday after the election. Meeting was particularly friendly say those familiar with what transpired.
DeSantis Transition wanted use of the 16th Floor in Capitol where OPB is hubbed. Scott initially said no. Wanted to meet with DeSantis to discuss key personnel decisions.
It got so bad that, according to one transition staffer, Susie Wiles jokingly threatened to hang a banner outside of an office on Adams Street that read DeSantis Transition Offices.
It has not yet been reported the resistance Rick Scott put up to the DeSantis transition team about it getting official office space. According to top sources close to @GovRonDeSantis, Scott would not sign off on getting DeSantis space until DeSantis would meet with Scott.
Up until that point Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis were on friendly terms. Not best buds, but certainly more amicable to each other than they are now. 		But Scott did not like facing a recount and really did not like that DeSantis was pivoting to transition.
The bad blood (and that's a bit of an overstatement) between the outgoing and incoming governor began post-election when it was clear that Rick Scott was headed to a recount (of some sort) and Ron DeSantis wasn't. https://t.co/57ovhy6Dw7
I feel like if I don't get this all out there now, I might get scooped again, as I was here that @GovRonDeSantis administration is likely to rescind ALL of Rick Scott's last minute, Senate-confirmable appointments. https://t.co/bj6uykJxIP
