@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN There are plenty of liberal Israelis &amp; American Jews who are also grateful for her starting the dialogue. I had no idea about those anti-Semitic tropes either. But I do now. So, educating people is one thing, but assigning intent is dangerous &amp; only furthers more hate.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN I say this after attending a candle light vigil last night in front of the Supreme Court where I listened to a sister of a young Muslim Afghan-American who was just shot in the back 7 times by an American Jew in Indiana. It was heartbreaking. It was a hate crime.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN In this time of hyper-polarization, we all need to be incredibly mindful of the language we use, including Omar. But when people start making baseless claims about her intent as a Muslim, it's crossing a line into bigotry.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN I would wait for a confirmation, but ok. My point is that it is dangerous to apply anti-Semitism rhetoric in 1 Muslim country to any one Muslim individual who is clearly critical of Israel's record of human rights abuses against Palestinians.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN Listen, there is a lot of misrepresentation &amp; misinformation out there, especially by the radical right wing. Until, this is corroborated, I'm not taking some dude's word for it. The fact that you are so quick to fill in the blanks with conjecture is dangerous.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN First, before I believe that she actually said that, there needs to be corroboration by respected new sources &amp; so far there aren't any. 2nd, if she did say that, I need context bc w/o it, it's all speculation.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN I just read that piece &amp; everyone in the comments section of the tweet can't believe that article was published. The author provides zero evidence or context. He inserts Jews into the article after using her alleged noncontroversial quote.
@jonathanchait This is horrible, irresponsible reporting. She "smiled"?! Seriously?! What event was this? You took her alleged quote and in the next paragraph you insert Jews as the topic that she was speaking on w/o a shred of evidence. This piece is a hit job.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN When did she say anything about Jews' allegiance to Israel?
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN Please provide examples of Omar's statements that come even close to the examples provided in the Egyptian story. There is a difference between anti-Semitism &amp; being critical of Israeli policies &amp; government actions.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN Palestine, &amp; a special interest group devoted to Israel that effectively uses its abundant resources to exert powerful influence on U.S. politicians. Yes, she should have been more sensitive w/ her language &amp; she has apologized.
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN I am ignorant about anti-Semitism in Egypt. 	He compared a 9/11 conspiracy theory that is trafficked, apparently, in Egypt to Omar's statements?! Seriously?! He is conflating Egyptians' attitudes about Jews with Omar's political position on Israel's human rights abuses,
@MichaelRWeis @DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN Yes, I know many Egyptians &amp; haven't heard this before. But that's not the point he was making. He used that story about Egyptians, &amp; therefore Muslims, he met to support his case against Ilhan Omar. There are only 2 common denominators in his comparison: Muslims &amp; anti-Semites.
@DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN I'm not the 1 who used a personal story about some Egyptians to support an argument against a Muslim Somali-American elected official. 	If your point wasn't to imply that Muslims are anti-Semitic, you could have used any white anti-Semite with similar conspiratorial views.
@DanielMillerEsq @IlhanMN You just used a handful of Egyptians to paint all Egyptians, &amp; therefore Muslims &amp; @IlhanMN, as conspiratorial, anti-Semites. Do us all a favor and work on your Islamaphobic rhetoric first before you make assumptions about the intent of a respected, elected Muslim Congresswoman.
@DanielMillerEsq Your point isn't to make a statement about Egyptians; it was to make a statement about Muslims and then tie in Omar. Sounds like you're doing exactly what you falsely accused @IlhanMN of, but worse.
@ZerlinaMaxwell For too long, people have left Ivanka alone bc she seems like the least shitty Trump spawn. But I assure you, as Trump's favorite child, she is most closely aligned with him. She's just a more refined version of her father, which in many ways, makes her more dangerous.

@trevordeke @sunrisemvmt @LindaKWS1 @MalcolmNance @SenFeinstein @justicedems @sunrisebayarea If Feinstein backed # 2, I'd fully retract. That's not what she said. GND has implications beyond climate change (all that I agree with, for most part). I wish it stuck to climate change and was more specific reg how it would translate into laws.
@trevordeke @sunrisemvmt @LindaKWS1 @MalcolmNance @SenFeinstein @justicedems @sunrisebayarea I'm not a constituent of Feinstein's, so I'm pretty ambivalent about her. What I care about is beating Trump. If we are divided, calling for Dem lawmakers to resign over relatively small differences, then expect us to fall behind further during Trump's second term.
@LoveEachother14 @_waleedshahid @sunrisemvmt Hey, great topics for conversation. But this Feinstein video didn't turn into a convo about either. The whole argument was about Feinstein's character &amp; how she treated these children. Sorry, but that's not a convo that pushes changes to save our planet.
@trevordeke @sunrisemvmt @LindaKWS1 @MalcolmNance @SenFeinstein @justicedems @sunrisebayarea I'm all for activism on climate change &amp; I understand the immediacy. But with 2020 around the corner, the most important thing is to stay unified otherwise we might as well hand over the election to Trump. Activism done in a way that doesn't cause so much petty divisiveness? 100%

@MegRJohn @CharlesMBlow Girl, I hear you. I'm just concerned about the lack of nuance in people's reactions. Someone who yells out racist slurs today &amp; would do it again, given the chance, should not be treated in the same way as someone who apologetically admits to a racist reaction 30 years ago.
@CharlesMBlow 9/ is there no spectrum of response that is based on each individual case? The reactions to Neesom are at about the same level as the ones to Steve King. We're setting a dangerous precedent if someone like Neesom deserves the same consequences as someone like Steve King.
@CharlesMBlow 8/ I think it goes against confronting and addressing racism if that person is relentlessly attacked as evil and unredeemable. How do we confront &amp; challenge covert, individual racism if we punish those who admit to it &amp; are ashamed of &amp; apologetic for it?
@CharlesMBlow 7/  &amp; labeled as an example of racism. However, in this case, there needs to be room for context, dialogue, &amp; learning. When someone comes forward and admits to once having racist beliefs, &amp; feeling ashamed, sought help,
@CharlesMBlow 6/ He's def no hero, but his honest admission does not warrant a write off as a vile racist who should be condemned to hell. Systemic racism exists &amp; it's an issue that plagues our country &amp; must be confronted &amp; addressed. Neesom's reaction should be condemned
@CharlesMBlow 5/ He expressed feeling ashamed and scared of his reaction, so much so that he sought help for himself through friends, a priest, self-help, &amp; therapy. And he just told his story publicly.
@CharlesMBlow 4/ His thoughts about targeting any black man as a representative of the man who raped his friend is racist. And any actions he took on those thoughts are racist. Thank God, he never ended up confronting or harming anyone.
@CharlesMBlow 3/ "How could this have happened to her?" "I should have been there to stop it." If one's not careful, rumination turns into ache that then becomes hate, irrational hate. Then comes revenge fantasies.
@CharlesMBlow 2/ from the news of his friend's traumatic experience, just as it cannot be separated from systemic racism. If you've ever felt powerlessness in being unable to protect a loved one from serious harm, then you know how much this can haunt and fester inside of you.
@CharlesMBlow 1/ Mr. Blow, you are 1 of my fav opinion writers, but I have to respectfully disagree. I have no idea how close he was to his friend who alleged being raped, but I'm going to assume they were close, so his reaction, as horrible &amp; disgusting as it was, cannot be separated

@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham I'm not a feminist, in any formal sense. But I do believe that women deserve equality, men who have used their power to violate &amp; disrespect women should be held accountable, and there are some men who hate the prospect of any it.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham Lol @ "a system of female dominance."  Where are you living? Among the Amazons?!
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham I'm a Licensed Mental Health Counselor with over 10 years of experience. The last 5 years of my work has mainly been with men, whether it be individual or group therapy. Blaming 50% of the world's population for 1 man's issues would be a dereliction of my duties.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham That's NOT what I said. Empowerment does not in any way mean "superiority." But I'm going to assume that you interpreted that way based on your own sense of superiority over a woman. Watching your superiority diminish must threaten you to your core.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham Something to ponder: Your experiences are NOT the experiences of ALL men. Your sense of "unbalanced" is rooted in the balancing of power relations between men &amp; women. It's scary for men like you, huh? Learn to deal with it.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham Men or women in toxic relationships suffer issues related to self-esteem, childhood abuse, family dysfunction or psychiatric disorders. May be easier &amp; in your interest to blame an entire sex for individual problems of some men, but you are failing to resolve their problems.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham Do yourself a favor and refrain from mansplaining what women should be grateful for. As a man, your opinions about women mean nothing.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham Sounds like a fucked up situation involving 2 mentally unstable people. Stop using people's tragedies to perpetuate your own irrational hatred towards a movement that fights for the empowerment of women.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham The only thing we are grateful for are all the strong women throughout history who sacrificed everything so that future generations of women could enjoy their God given human rights &amp; no longer be subjected to the cruel &amp; violent whims of men.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham Suicide &amp; depression are mental health issues and should be dealt with as such. Blaming feminism &amp; social/gender equality for men's mental health issues would be like blaming black activism for white people's mental health issues.
@ToddMitchem @RKJ65 @rchapman2341 @frankthorp @MSNBC @RalphNortham I have no doubt that those men feel that way. But claiming that their realities are reflective of the realities of larger society is wrong. Claiming that their depression is rooted in female superiority is absolutely wrong. Depression causes distortions in reality.
