@Porter4Us @ChuckGrassley I certainly get a better sense being in the room and I suspect others do.  	It's going to be a circus no matter how small the room is and which journalists are let in.  That's why Ford's request and Grassley's compliance are useless.
@Porter4Us @ChuckGrassley Ford made a number of requests.  Grassley makes the rules and decided which ones to honor (limiting press) and which to reject (who questions, which order).  This is first time I can recall a committee requiring list of individual reporters approved for entry.
Just spoke to @ChuckGrassley staff and am told they would be willing to have reporters rotate through and not insist on pre-approved list of names.  That would be a great improvement if it happens.

@ggreenwald Fair enough.  I was thinking of her attack on his special-interest-money as tactical rather than ideological, but I can see how it is both.   I would like to see a more full-throated populism from Democrats and dark money corruption as a campaign theme.
@ggreenwald Could not agree more.  As I wrote in the column:  Ocasio-Cortez "improved the odds of a younger and feistier Democratic opposition emerging [and] the new blood is urgently needed."
@ggreenwald @Sr_Penalosa FWIW, my column said the Ocasio-Cortez win was a gift to the Democrats. It also called for Pelosi et al to step down and  for Dems to bring in young, female, non-white progressive leaders.
@ggreenwald I absolutely agree that the Democratic Party is a pile of rubble now, thanks in large part to Obama. That's why I think making the Democratic "establishment" the enemy is a straw man.  The party is shifting to the left.  There is little resistance. You're pushing on an open door.

@ryangrim @matthewstoller No, though I would say the whole party has moved to the left and the differences among the three are dwarfed by voters’ overriding concern this year, which is stopping Trump.  If/when Dems regain power, those differences will emerge again.
@ryangrim @matthewstoller I do agree with you that there’s a progressive uprising.  I just don’t see the pushback that you see.
@ryangrim @matthewstoller Are the first-time candidates more progressive? Yes.  But they aren’t getting a lot of pushback from the party.  Everybody is moving in that direction.
@ryangrim @matthewstoller 3. In 85 percent of Dem House primaries this year, the candidate who raised the most money won.  Of the exceptions, 70% are women.  This is the year of the woman, not the anti-Democratic-establishment candidate.

Comey: calling for Clinton email special counsel would've been "brutally unfair" bc "there was no case."  But he wanted one to probe Trump.
Two hours into hearing, no @realDonaldTrump tweets.  I now suspect duct tape is involved.
Get this man some Pepto Bismol. Comey at last hearing said he was "mildly nauseous."  Now he reports being "queasy."
Angus King again is the star questioner, spurring Comey to quote Henry II on Thomas Becket: Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?
Comey repeatedly says he took notes because of Trump's "nature." Quite a statement on the president's character.
One hour into hearing, no @realDonaldTrump tweets.  Is Reince using manacles or zip ties on him?

@HotlineJosh @AndyOplas Surely there's a spectrum between people who merely think blacks lazy and David Duke. But it's a spectrum of racism.
@HotlineJosh I think the former.  But good points.  Will write some more on this. Thank you for the back-and-forth.
@HotlineJosh @AndyOplas Right, 61% believe blacks are dumber, lazier or both. It's a horrifying but accurate gauge of white prejudice.
@HotlineJosh @AndyOplas You're absolutely wrong. As I wrote, the 61% are those who said blacks are dumber or lazier than whites.
@HotlineJosh @AndyOplas You don't have to wear a sheet to hold racist views.  Racism is far more pervasive than the David Dukes.
@HotlineJosh @AndyOplas You're saying white people who believe black people are less intelligent and lazier than whites are not racist?
