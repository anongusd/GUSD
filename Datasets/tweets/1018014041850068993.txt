@realDonaldTrump You are an obstruction to humanity.
@tribelaw @JoyceWhiteVance There should be no more appointments allowed, no more executive orders rendered by this corrupt, and compromised  administration and top @GOP enablers.
@AshaRangappa_ Don't do me like that!!
@SenStabenow maybe you are ok with people threatening lives? Are you ok with causing severe distress in individuals with disabilities? Are you ok with someone using their status as power to do so , while agencies , lawyers and judges help them to do so knowingly?
@SenStabenow I just need to know , because I have done everything I can to get someone,anyone to do the right thing here. As you see I am still trying to find the answer in the dark The system fails people like my son everyday because he doesn't have the power to manipulate it.
@SenStabenow , you see ma'am,  in this country we protect the ones who can buy the system and turn lies and criminality into a false truth so we protect their position as not to ruin their accomplishments. Friends in high places you can do whatever you want to anyone. Is this law
@fred_guttenberg I'm not a N.R.A. member, but he needs to go to prison.
@SenStabenow , ma'am I'm sick and tired of this nonsense , no-one would be allowed to do what has been done to these kids if they were a average or common person, but since the perpetrators are such pillars of the community they are given free reign to terrorize challenged people
@SenStabenow , when someone threatens a life and continually harasses another individual and they seek help from law enforcement,  protection should be given when proof is shown. This has not happened in a year and a half of trying. Are you complicit with death threats Senator?
@SenStabenow , good morning ma'am,  maybe you don't understand what is or has been going on with my son and his family, or maybe you like the State has been don't care what happens to him? In any other time a threat to children would be removed from the household. He is in DANGER

@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano Just my opinion, but equal opportunity doesn't exist still to this day, and as we have witnessed with Trump, racism certainly does. The comments and slurs coming from him and candidates as of late are for me mind blowing,  unacceptable in this day and age. Lacking intelligence.

@Alyssa_Milano , I don't know you , but I love you. I love us all. I don't know your situation, no games,  I didn't want to wait weeks ago. Rest, be blessed.
@Alyssa_Milano It is a travesty, moreover it should be a wake up call for all of us , our water supply. I fear things are much worse than any of us are aware. Who and how many should be held accountable? Thank you for your voice, your passion, your activism. Dynamite in small package.
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano Have a blessed week.
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano Personally , i prefer simple, I don't require or aspire for wealth or material things. To each their own. Unless you have lived the life of the under priveledged,  is easy to condemn.
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano There are extremes at both ends. So you didn't score quite high enough on this test , sorry about your luck, or since you have money we'll offer you this loan at a low rate, while the poor man will pay through the nose. Oh you make less than 8 bucks an hour, &lt;2 gallons milk =1 hr
@emarvelous @NAACP_LDF The sad thing is , this administration knows it, and is using it as a weapon. The fear , the anxiety, it should be considered an attack on all our well beings.
What do you think?@Alyssa_Milano, I'm up for adoption...you interested?üòÅ https://t.co/tNpUs42Mn0
@GeorgeTakei I cant imagine why?
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano You sound confident Trump is capable of carrying out the duties of POTUS? I think we both agree there are good and bad seeds in both parties respectively as in all humans? A system that benefits the wealthy by punishing the poor, that poisons waterand ignores warnings from nature
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano This is a festering for many years . They cannot expect for emotions to not run amuck when it is a calculated attack on intelligence and well being. When the man who is in charge is inciting and inflicting those attacks. It is as it has been, oppression.
@GeraldoRivera So much for progress.
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano Agree 100 pct., this is why we are where we are , it is sad , unnecessary. However the bleakness may be, we can change it. I hope that all of us step back,  see what we have become , or allowed to happen, and  understand how deep and far back this goes. The reason for emotion.
@ChrisCuomo Personally the extreme violence comes mainly from what side? It's not a secret. This is why we are where we are , continued oppression.
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano For me , I do not affiliate with any particular party. I tend to lean towards who looks after the poor, the disabled, the disadvantaged, the elderly, and our veterans. I agree there must be a middle ground of compromise,  but it is hard to trust when party comes before conscious.

I see people sleeping in sub zero temps., people  unable to obtain healthcare, people poisoned by their water supply. I see conflicts of interest , no end.
@ThrashMikki @Alyssa_Milano We all have a right to our own beliefs , there are many serious issues to be dealt with. I don't have all the answers. I do know that a government that systematically targets certain  groups , fails to provide for the general welfare of the public will fail.
