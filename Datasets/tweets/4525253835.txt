@ATabarrok @maximlott @bryan_caplan I think many Europeans wrongly think that a string welfare state should go hand in hand with heavy labor market regulation. IMO the opposite is true - it is precisely when you have a liberalised labor market that you need a welfare state, and it also makes it less expensive.

@mheatherly3 @JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet For sure there are lots of added complexities in the US, and differences from Europe. That said, from a European perspective all the hullabaloo about socialism in the US because of Bernie and AOC seems a bit like a big fuss about nothing at all.
@mheatherly3 @JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet Same in the United Kingdom, where I currently live. But it also has universal healthcare, almost free higher education, and same taxes as I would have paid in Norway. But nobody calls it socialist, and bernie would have been mainstream here as well.
@mheatherly3 @JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet Sanders policies are mainstream in Europe. The whole discussion of capitalism vs socialism is a bit silly. All of the west is capitalist, and it will be capitalist with or without high taxes, universal healthcare, or a welfare state. Socialism is a completely different paradigm.
@mheatherly3 @JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet Pretty much all of the west, including the US, had much more heavy-handed government involvement in the economy than today during the 50s, 60s, and 70s, but liberalised the economy in the 80s and 90s. The swing of the pendulum was not much different in Sweden than in f.ex. the UK
@mheatherly3 @JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet I am from Norway. Sanders would be a mainstream politician in Scandinavia. The two big things are universal healthcare and free higher education. Those things are not even up for discussion in Scandinavia, nor in pretty much every other developed country in the world.
@JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet As a Norwegian, I'd agree with most of the points made here - but I don't see how it's in any way pushing against Bernie &amp; co. If anything, Norberg's arguments should make Americans *more* favourable towards social democracy, and debunk the myth that it leads to socialism.
@JohnStossel @maximlott @johanknorberg @FreeToChooseNet It is 100% right that Scandinavia is not socialist. But its still true that most of the policies that bernie sanders, AOC, etc. propose would bring the US closer to how Scandinavia is run. Its the socialist label that is spurious here, not American left wing policy proposals.

@maximlott @piersmorgan I agree with everything you say here. In particular, I think that the desire (from both sides) to paint him in a particular light undermines their credibility, and leaves us with an overall worse-quality public debate.
@maximlott @f_thomassen @piersmorgan Apologies for the rant. But what the hell happened to "great statesmen"?
@maximlott @f_thomassen @piersmorgan It doesn't matter if you are a republican, democrat, libertarian, or a social democrat - we should demand leaders who are thoughtful, responsible grown-ups with integrity and character. From that perspective, I can hardly think of a worse candidate than Trump.
@maximlott @f_thomassen @piersmorgan I just don't think it's elitist or unreasonable to demand that our leaders are thoughtful people who recognise complexity, uncertainty, and can talk about things like a grown up. Trump is not a "man of the people" with a bombastic style, he is a complete buffoon.
@maximlott @f_thomassen @piersmorgan That includes most right wing politicians. I disagree with e.g. Rand Paul on 50-70% of his policy positions, but think he is immeasurably more qualified for high office than trump, because its clear that Paul has thought properly about what he thinks.
@maximlott @f_thomassen @piersmorgan I think almost every other senior US politician shows an order of magnitude more thoughtfulness, reflection, and appreciation of subtlety when they talk about big issues (but its a low bar) . Maybe Trump is secretly a thoughtful guy in private, but that feels like a leap of faith
@f_thomassen @piersmorgan @maximlott As a broader point on the narrative about the "mainstream media" - I think it's a bit bizarre to exempt Fox News from this category when they are the largest news network in the US. Their political slant is just as strong as CNN etc. - but it's for Trump, not against.
@f_thomassen @piersmorgan @maximlott That, of course, is not a good reason for the media to also reject subtle analysis in favor of knee-jerk partisan reactions for or against everything Trump says, does, or is. This is a problem both on the mainstream left, eg. CNN and the mainstream right, eg. Fox.
@f_thomassen @piersmorgan @maximlott That's a fair point. In my mind, though, the unreedemable thing about Trump is not his answers to tough questions, but his total lack willingness or ability to treat them as tough questions at all. His total rejection of subtle analysis is the main reason why he is so horrifying.
@piersmorgan @maximlott Fair enough. But is it also possible that an impartial view of Trump is likely to conclude that he is a terrible person? One could argue that serious bias is required to *not* be extremely critical of him and his presidency - even if you agree with 80% of his policy positions.
@JackPosobiec I'm interested to understand why when an unnamed Chicago police source leaks an investigative theory it's taken as fact, but when the same happens with the investigation of Trump it's a witch hunt. Jumping to conclusions tends to confirm partisan bias rather than get at the truth
@pepsipepsi @JohnStossel A 1/3 chance for Trump winning on the eve of the election might have been the most accurate prediction possible. And it is consistent with Trump becoming president in one out of three alternative futures - the one of the ones we are in.

@maximlott @David_Boaz I am biased here. My view of Trump is that he is so deeply narcissistic, unthoughtful, and close minded that he is incapable of caring about anything except realising his own bizarre delusions of grandeur. I think that view is based on strong evidence - but I still could be wrong
@maximlott @papabearnc @RepMarkMeadows These are good points, and to be fair my argument above was more polememic than rational.		I think immigration is fundamentally a question of: what do you want your country to be like?		There's no real right or wrong here, so democracy makes sense as a decision making mechanism.
@JackPosobiec @maximlott This is true and a good thing. There's not a single socialist country in the western world, and the US would be an unlikely candidate to buck that trend. This might also a reason to argue there's not much reason to fret about a few loud lefties in Congress.
@David_Boaz @maximlott This is hardly credible coming from a president who consistently ignores the anti-semitism of some of his own most ardent supporters on the alt-right. Not saying this isn't a problem in parts of the far left as well, but Trump's words here sound like empty boilerplateisms.
@maximlott I think there's a need for some serious, Conservative fact-checkers, that would make possible a properly unbiased bipartisan meta/consensus fact check. Currently, Americans on the left and the right inhabit different realities, and the media on both sides is making it worse.
@maximlott This is a problem. I think fact checks are super important, and there should be scope for pointing it out when facts are accurate but taken out of context - but this is a step too far and undermines the credibility of the whole concept.
RT @NateSilver538: Giving yourself some "executive time" is awesome IMO, way better than filling up your whole schedule with meetings.
@LisaV_CT It's not "my opinion" that Democrats flipped ca. 40 house seats in the midterms, it's a fact. Immigration being a big issue in the elections is a fact. The wall being extremely unpopular amongst democratic voters is a fact. I'm not sure what "says you" is supposed to mean here.
@LisaV_CT "A wall with Mexico will solve America's drug problems" is magical thinking. The opioid crisis being driven by painkillers is not a "dem deluge", its the only conclusion that is consistent with facts. Drug smuggling is also a problem, but not the main driver of opioid addiction.
@LisaV_CT Republicans are much more popular in rural areas than Democrats, which means they have a structural advantage over the Democrats in the senate, since representation is not adjusted by population. There's no special math.
@LisaV_CT Sure, it will be more difficult to smuggle drugs across the border from Mexico if there is a wall. But the cause of the US opioid crisis is overprescription of legal painkillers produced and marketed by American companies in the US. A wall is not going to fix that problem.
@LisaV_CT The house democrats won big in a midterm where immigration and border security was a big deal. If their constituents wanted a wall they would have voted for a republican.
@LisaV_CT Haha, yes. They are gonna have to do their jobs negotiating on behalf of their their constituents who elected them not wanting a wall.
@LisaV_CT Sure - but, but he needs more dems to cross over now. No matter how you look at it, it makes no sense to think that he can get wall funding after losing 40 seats in the house when he couldn't get last year and the year before - especially as the wall was an issue in the midterms
@papabearnc @maximlott @RepMarkMeadows The most American of America used to be: "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me". Now it's "build the wall to keep out the rapists" What happened?
@papabearnc @maximlott @RepMarkMeadows The United States is an incredible and amazing country. Every wave of immigration has made it greater. Where does this paranoia about immigrants come from? Has the idea of America become so fragile that's its no longer able to make Americans of millions more who want to be made?
@papabearnc @maximlott @RepMarkMeadows Yes. Before the last election he needed Democrats in the senate. Now he needs them both in the senate and the house. So its become harder after the midterms, but he chooses to push it now. That's bizarre. If he didn't have a mandate before the midterms, he definitely doesn't now.
@papabearnc @maximlott @RepMarkMeadows Even if a wall would reduce crossings doesn't mean you have to do it. Free health care would reduce infant mortality - that doesn't mean you have to have free healthcare. The question is, how big a deal is illegal immigration? Dems say its a medium big deal - not worth a wall.
@papabearnc @maximlott @RepMarkMeadows I dont know. Maybe their voters changed their attitudes so they had to as well. Maybe Trump's boorishness and thinly veiled xenophobia made Democrats want as much distance from him as possible. At any rate, the senate wouldn't pass it in 2017 or 2018, so why the hang-up now?
@maximlott @papabearnc @RepMarkMeadows So, previously he could (maybe) have gotten it though the house, but not the senate, and now - after congressional elections where border security has been an issue for voters - he can't get it through either. Doesn't feel like much of a mandate.
@mirimquin @RepMarkMeadows ?
@RepMarkMeadows If a wall is so fundamental, how come republicans didn't pass funding for it while they still controlled both Chambers of the house? Somehow this only became urgent when Democrats won the house? This is bizarre.
More mind-boggling than Trump's pathological hypocrisy is the continued support he enjoys from conservative Christians who ostensibly care about character and moral integrity. https://t.co/lo3v3jRkCD
In my opinion AOC is a breath of fresh air on the American, left but this well written critique by @marcthiessen suggests that she needs to start doing her homework more carefully. @maximlott	https://t.co/cCY7YdapqF
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer I agree 100% that socialism in its traditional definition necessary leads to disaster. But perhaps it's more useful to argue about policy than dictionary definitons. The historical definition of "liberal", for example, is very different from how it's understood today in the US.
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer Good point - apologies for implying that, it was more directly responding to @BernardKerik above.
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer In which case you can have a reasonable discussion about the trade off between a stronger welfare state and lower taxes economic growth, the trade off between freedom of choice and equal accessability in education and healthcare, etc.
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer Europe is the most similar place to the US in the rest of the world - in spite of "socialist" policies and governments run by left-wingers. Venezuela is different on almost every dimension, with or without the socialist label. Comparing to Europe seems much more appropriate.
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer I agree that comparing to other countries is reasonable, but struggle to see Venezuela as the most relevant comparison. What about *all of europe*, which has lots of "socialist" politicians, higher taxes, and free healthcare, but also freedom and strong democratic institutions.
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer The socialism label has been used and abused in lots of different situations - and perhaps its not the best description for the policy positions of left wing Democrats. But labels change meaning and I struggle a bit to see the case for alarm.
@maximlott @BernardKerik @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer Fair enough. But the descent to tyranny is not about higher or lower taxes, or more or less public services - its about the erosion of democratic institutions to allow a tyrant to take control of a country for his own benefit. This happens independently of economic policy labels.
@BernardKerik @maximlott @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer ...some have higher taxes, some lower, but the differences are not massive. Most have free, public, healthcare and higher education, while a few don't. But all are stable democracies with a free press, private property, rule of law, etc. and look nothing like Venezuela or Cuba.
@BernardKerik @maximlott @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer Pretty much every developed country is somewhere in the middle, the US included - regardless of how they label themselves or are perceived externally. All of them are capitalist market economies with a few things run by government, but most by private business...
@BernardKerik @maximlott @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer There's no such thing as a purely socialist or capitalist economy. Norway calls itself a social democracy and has higher taxes than the US and free healthcare - but many of things owned and run by the government in the US are private enterprises in Norway (e.g. airport security)
@BernardKerik @maximlott @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer It might very well be the case that higher marginal taxes and public healthcare *isn't* right for the US - but oversimplifying the debate to be about a choice between capitalism vs socialism is trading nuance and thoughtfulness for sensationalism.
@BernardKerik @maximlott @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer The same type of argument could be made in the opposite direction: "look at Somalia, this is what happens when you have small government with little or  no regulation or taxes". This is obviously ridiculous, just like "higher taxes and free healthcare will turn us into Venezuela"
@BernardKerik @maximlott @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @SenSchumer Nice historical anecdotes, but completely unrelated to the current US political debate. Proposals by AOC &amp; Co echo policies from mid 20th century USA (taxes) and present day Europe (free healthcare and Higher education). The comparison with Venezuela or Cuba is spurious at best.
@ScottforFlorida @BernieSanders @ewarren This level of oversimplification should be below us. To argue that higher taxes and universal healthcare will turn the US into Venezuela is not an argument made in good faith. Most other western countries are evidence to the contrary, and ignoring that feels a bit bizarre.
@SeanMcElwee What you are suggesting is tearing apart the very thing that makes a democracy possible at all - talking together in good faith when we disagree. Coercing people to build what you think is a better society is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. @maximlott

@BillSpadea @maximlott The article you quote does not support your claim that these are facts. This is *one* assessment of the effect of a policy compared to a hypothetical counterfactual.

@maximlott Here's one potential contributor https://t.co/CJtGiKsEJs
@maximlott I could believe that it's maybe the tenth most important contributor - but to paint it as *the* main thing that causes a lack of stable families feels like a politically motivated (rather than analytically-driven) conclusion.
@maximlott This argument is repeated over and over again on the right, but is not often supported by robust empirical evidence to support a causal relationship. I find it difficult to believe that bad welfare incentives is a major cause of a lack of stable families amongst poor Americans
@TMIWITW @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny Liberal or not I think the language policing has gone way too far. And I was also one of the first to call this guy out.
@Not_On_Duty @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny I think you make a fair point and. To the extent that it's true that's not the way it should be. In my mind the language policing trend has gone way too far and is hugely damaging to the integrity of the left. But I don't speak for all liberals, and not all liberals speak for me
@always_on_hold @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny Arguably, the very idea of strongly identifying oneself as part of a victim group is one of the trends conservatives are highly critical of, so a willingness to claim victimhood due to political persecution seems a bit incongruent with the ideological position.
@always_on_hold @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny I mean - clearly they can say much worse than this guy and still be elected president. For sure there's lots of out of control pile-in language policing, but I'm not sure it's accurate to unequivocally paint conservatives as a "victim group" in modern America.
@Seabee201 @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny I think that's a reasonable worry
@PolitiBunny @HTX_Con @AmoneyResists Seriously though, 1) I lived in the US for many years so I take a strong personal interest, and 2) the world is so interconnected that whether you like it or not what happens in the US politically has a big impact on the rest of the world and the rest of the West in particular
@PolitiBunny @HTX_Con @AmoneyResists Haha no I'm a globalist
@HTX_Con @PolitiBunny @AmoneyResists I live in Europe so I will stick with what it actually means (and still means here).
@Seabee201 @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny Mate - I completely agree with you that the PC movement has gone way too far. In my mind it's fundamentally illiberal. There's more than two ways to look at the world, and no reason why "liberals" or "conservatives" should be monolithic blocs of people who hold identical opinions
@PolitiBunny @HTX_Con @AmoneyResists https://t.co/n78dMHdrJM https://t.co/5ThcvbP6eq
@PolitiBunny @HTX_Con @AmoneyResists I have no idea how Liberal came to mean leftist in the US. Not really relevant to this discussion, but classical liberalism is still pretty conservative ideological ground, and fairly consistent with a lot of what American conservatives are all about.
@PolitiBunny @HTX_Con @AmoneyResists According to this definition, the United States, with its system of government as enshrined in the constitution, was and still is the first modern "liberal democracy"
@PolitiBunny @HTX_Con @AmoneyResists Sorry - I realise "Liberal" has come to mean "leftist" in the US. I meant "liberal democracy" in the classical, sense of the word, basically meaning democracy with free speech+elections+separation of power. You can substitute it for "Western  democracy" https://t.co/fvQWGyrOK0
@ScottPaterno Sorry, Scott - didn't meant this as a criticism of anything you said. I meant it as a general observation of the public debate. Fully agree with you that there's way too much ugly labelling going on, and that the left has been pushing this in particular.
@HTX_Con @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny To be clear - I think we should apply the same standard to conservatives. In my book, aggressive language policing is not consistent with liberal democracy, and I think the American left is throwing the baby out with the bathwater with their SJW approach to public debate
@BklynBirny @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny Haha fair game
@always_on_hold @AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny They would be called a racist, just like this guy was.
@ScottPaterno We need to be consistent here. If you're a conservative complaining about snowflakey liberals being offended for no reason, it looks pretty stupid to get all up in arms about a football player kneeling for the national anthem. But liberals need to do some serious soul-searching
@ScottPaterno It creates a super unhealthy public debate where everyone is just looking for a reason to get super offended and triggered. Both on the left and the right.
@ScottPaterno Tbh - and I'm saying this as a Liberal - I think there's way too much focus on words and how they are offensive or not vs. actual substance in the public debate.
@PolitiBunny Haha - "guys" here meant as a gender neutral term.
@AmoneyResists @PolitiBunny Guys - he said it was a poor choice of words, deleted the tweet, and apologised. Let's call back the Spanish Inquisition here. If you complain about America being too PC you need to give people the benefit of the doubt when they say that their offensive remarks were unintentional
@AmoneyResists @thecjpearson Andrew: I'm a Liberal - comments like these don't help us (or anyone). Resorting to racism and insults to call out what you think is a self-important Conservative is like beating someone up to protest the use of violence.

@maximlott @jsolomonReports Well - if they are crimes they arguably should be gone after regardless of whether they are related to Trump or not. Eg. Paul Manafort is a hardly an innocent good guy being thrown under the bus to get at Trump. He's a scoundrel that should have been in jail long ago.
@maximlott @jsolomonReports Fair enough - that feels interesting. One the other hand, you could argue that any investigator should have a concern that there is nothing there, and that its a sign of being objective and dispassionate.
@jsolomonReports @maximlott Given that collusion between a presidential candidate and a foreign power would be one of the most serious violations of national security, and the presidential mandate, even a small likelihood that this took place should be enough to warrant a significant investigative effort.
@jsolomonReports @maximlott What is the bombshell here? Saying that something is suspicious enough to start an investigation is hardly the same as claiming to have evidence that something has happened. Finding out whether it not such evidence exists is the purpose of starting an investigation.
@AndrewCMcCarthy @BradMossEsq @jsolomonReports I have trouble seing what the supposed scandal is here. "perhaps" is hardly a claim of hard evidence, but a claim that it is possible that such evidence would emerge from an investigation.

@maximlott Another point to be made on bias or criticism or an explicit stance against Trump is that this isn't the same as being biased against conservatives (although the two are often correlated). Neither his character nor his policies are representative of classic American Conservatism
@maximlott That said, I don't think they should use their search algorithm to intentionally bias results against him. And I'm not sure they do, even if media outlets that are more critical of him tend to rank higher.
@maximlott And to your other point, if he were "literally Hitler" - which he is not (but perhaps he would like to be a Mussolini?) - i would actually argue that Google (and everyone else) would have a moral duty to do *a lot more* than stop promoting the state of the Union on its homepage.
@maximlott Fair enough. But companies small and large make ethical and political choices all the time - both based on self interest and on conscience. Perhaps we should embrace it. There are lots of issues with this, but perhaps its unavoidable in a society based on freedom of speech
@maximlott It also raises the question of whether taking that position on Trump also implies a sort of arrogant scorn and disregard of his supporters that is both morally questionable and doesn't exactly foster an inclusive political climate or help "heal the divide" in the United States.
@maximlott I'm not sure if it's true, but I think it's a question worth asking. I also think that this is entirely independent of search engine algorithms (although it certainly makes claims of bias more credible).
@maximlott Maybe it's OK for Google to say that Trump - irrespective of politics and irrespective of the state of the Union - is such a horrible guy based on almost any measure you can think of, that they don't want to be seen to promote or associate with him any more than necessary?
@NateSilver538 In a sense, it doesn't matter if you're reporting the truth if you can't show it, because the lack of transparency allows everyone who doesn't like what you are saying to dismiss it out of hand. That's a very poor foundation for constructive public debate.
@NateSilver538 It would also improve the quality of the public debate - when sources are transparent it's more difficult to dismiss information as "fake news", which focuses the debate more on the substance of the issues.

Great article on some of the broader issues around the way Trump ran his summit with Putin on Helsinki. Not fake news. 		https://t.co/BCqW8XAQxo
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson So youre saying the intelligence on Russian interference, the Mueller investigation, and the bipartisan outrage over trump trusting putin over US intelligence is actually just a vast conspiracy to harm US-Russia relations in order to increase budgets? Is that really plausible?
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson The other explanation is that pretty much *everyone* at the senior levels of the fbi and the justice department, including trump appointees, are secret democrat supporters who are abusing their power in order to put in motion an investigation in order to take down trump.
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson We don't know *all* the background to the investigation, but the fbi and the special council neither have to nor should share this while it's still ongoing. But if the Trump-appointed, Republican, deputy AG thinks there's enough background to investigate - then there probably is.
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson Of course we don't know whether Trump colluded. But even if it's unlikely, it needs to be fully investigated if there is even a small chance he did.
Sorry for the typo above - I meant to write Democrat. Misspelling was not meant as a pun.
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson Even if there's a 10% chance that the dossier was accurate, and there was nothing else to indicate either interference from Russia, or involvement with trump's team, it would warrant investigation. In spite of the fact that it was paid for by his opponents.
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson And it would be quite extraordinary to expect the intelligence community to make thw details of its work public in the middle of a counterintelligence investigation, in order to "prove" that its *not* politically motivated. And extremely reckless at that.
@Franky_Banky @BrexitMania @guypbenson There's no doubt the research behind the dossier was paid for by trump's political opponents. That makes it less credible, but doesn't mean its not true. We don't know. We also don't know what other information the cia, FBI, nsa etc. had to suggest trump might be involved.
@BrexitMania @Franky_Banky @guypbenson If you want to reach a certain conclusion, you will find the evidence to support it, spurious or not. I'm happy to entertain a discussion with people who are willing to look at things from multiple sides, but neither of us are getting much out of this. Good luck with life.
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump If you want to believe that everyone in government who speaks out against trump is "politically corrupt", that's fine. But the more complex and all-encompassing this supposed deep state conspiracy against Trump becomes, the more implausible and plain crazy it seems.
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Comey, Clapper, and Brenner - highly distinguished US intelligence leaders who have spent a lifetime protecting their country, have criticised Trump heavily on a number of issues. There are two hypotheses for why: 1) they are "politically" corrupt, 2) their criticism is justified
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Dan Coats, DNI, is the Head of the entire US intelligence community (all 16 agencies). Here is a list of other people who have reached the same conclusion. All corrupt? https://t.co/FqCTpsQZNZ
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson On the Mueller investigation - the simplest possible plausible explanation: its possible, but unlikely that Trump and his team colluded, but plausible enough that it warrants investigation because of the extremely serious consequences of true.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Just because you don't like Hillary doesn't mean that the investigation into her emails was compromised. Again, a simpler explanation, maybe the FBI were right, she was careless, but did nothing criminal. She's been investigated at length and they found no reason to charge her.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Or, a simpler explanation, they're all doing their jobs to the best of their ability to protect America from external and internal threats, according to their mandate.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson I'm sorry I was unclear - I'm saying *your* explanations  make sense if you presuppose the conclusion, but seem a bit far fetched otherwise. Basically, they rely on the assumption that almost everyone who has done anything trump doesn't like is part of a vast conspiracy
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson If there's a 5-10% chance that Trump colluded with Russia, that means that he's most likely innocent, and also means its extremely important to investigate so we find out whether it's true or not, cause of it is its perhaps the greatest breach of national security in us history.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Again, if you presuppose the conclusion this all makes sense. A simpler explanation is that they are investigating credible, but unproven indications that the president or members if his campaign could be compromised investigation, to find out if these are true or false
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson No, you're slowly making it up.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Alternatively, the prime reason was that Trump fired Comey for refusing to stop an investigation that *might* implicate him. That seems like a pretty good reason to appoint a special counsel. It also suggests that Trump has stuff to hide.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Trump suggests at the same time that 1) no one did anything to stop Russian meddling, and at the same time says the investigation that was launched into Russian meddling should never have happened. There are at least two self-contradictions there.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Him as his entire team, including Stzrok and Page, did not leak even the slightest indication that Trump was under investigation, in spite of being personally opposed to him and knowing a leak would be guaranteed to cost him the election. That is how people with integrity work.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Comey started an investigation, as he should have, because there were credible, but unproven, indications that 1) Russia was meddling in the election, and 2) Trump or members of his team *may* have been colluding. That needs investigating, in order to find out if its true or not
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson The president in no way had his legal powers constrained by the investigation. Not even slightly. If he has nothing to hide, the investigation is good for him, as it will prove beyond doubt that there was no collusion, rather than having it be an unresolved issue hanging over him
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson His probe was started by Rod Rosenstein, deputy attorney General of the United States, a republican appointed by Donald Trump - hardly a "frequent criminal"
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Suggesting that the president is beyond questioning or investigation is to invite authoritarianism, saying that it undermines him too much implies that he is weak. Neither is a good loom for the president.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson There have been lots and lots of special counsel investigations of previous presidents over far smaller issues, and most of them have gone on for much longer before any indictments have been made or evidence made public. Here is a fact-based comparison: https://t.co/rNDfv1f9U3
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Two core ideas in the constitution is that no one is above the law, and that there should be a balance of power. Both of these suggest that *possible* serious wrongdoing should be investigated and be proven or disproven.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson That approach also has the advantage (or disadvantage) of making it impossible for you to be disproven - regardless of what is actually true.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson If you presuppose the conclusion that Trump is beyond reproach and everything that has the potential to make him look bad must necessarily be a misunderstanding, fake news, or a Liberal/democrat/globalist conspiracy, everything you say makes sense.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson You can call it a witch hunt all you want, but these indictments are not based on make-believe Any patriot who cares about protecting America should recognise that, regardless of political beliefs.
@Franky_Banky @guypbenson Well, do *you* belive that Russia meddled in the election? Do you think foreign spies, when discovered and there is evidence against them, should be outed, or is the United States better off turning the other cheek?
@guypbenson It's a blessing that Trump has a few grown ups around him, the "great offer" notwithstanding.
@BrexitMania @jphlogiston @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Congratulations on your twelve likes.
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump (his own fragile ego, that is)
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump There are lots of ways Trump could have answered the question posed to him without being inflammatory or directly attacking Putin. Trump's disawowal of American intelligence was in no way necessary to achieve diplomatic goals. It was a knee-jerk reaction to protect a fragile ego
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Reasonable people can disagree about his broader approach to engaging with Russia - but its hardly a cause for outrage. A commander in chief who says he trusts the personal assurances of foreign dictators over US intelligence should cause all patriotic Americans to be outraged.
@BrexitMania @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump If "I have no reason to believe it would be [Russia]" is the truth, then the United States is in serious trouble, because it has a president who believes the "strong denial" of his adversaries over the assessments of *all* of his intelligence agencies.
@CB618444 @robjh1 @POTUS What about... The United States? What happened to "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.."?
@JohnRLottJr @maximlott Of course he would still be critisised, like any president would regardless of what they do - but on completely different grounds than for throwing his own intelligence community under the bus in favor of the "strong" denial of a geopolitical adversary.
@JohnRLottJr @maximlott Example: "I believe the us intel assessments regarding election interference are accurate, and it is a serious issue that I have discussed at length with president Putin. However, I hope we can put these issues behind us and focus on building a more productive relationship"
@JohnRLottJr @maximlott There are lots and lots of diplomatic, non-hostile ways Trump could have answered the very reasonable question posed to him without quite explicitly saying that he believed Putin over his own intelligence agencies.
@JohnRLottJr @maximlott The reaction is to Trump saying he "has no reason to believe it would be [Russia]", in spite of the collective US intelligence apparatus saying that it is, because Putin "very strongly" denied it. This is not even nearly the same as reacting to Trump not "attacking" Putin.

@JesseKellyDC @politicalelle You can disagree with feminists who go marching with pink hats, but the fact they do is a sign that they care about America - just like conservatives organising gun rallies.

@JesseKellyDC @politicalelle And people who think they care about patriotism ought to know the difference.
@JesseKellyDC @politicalelle So when a draft-dodger like trump tells you he loves his country becsuse he flies the flag and stands for the national anthem - that looks to me like someone who loves talking the talk but doesn't really give a shit about anyone except himself - least if all his country
@JesseKellyDC @politicalelle Seriously, why does a flag have anything to do with whether you love or hate your country? It certainly might mean you want everyone else to think you do, but å the end of the day it's what you do for your country and your community that matters.
@JesseKellyDC @politicalelle How on earth does not having a flag make you hate your country? I spent five years in my country's military, and deployed twice (alongside our allies, the US). But I don't bother flying a flag on my balcony. Does that mean I hate Norway now?

RT @JohnKerry: My thoughts on President Trump's remarks in Brussels this morning: https://t.co/x0k3k0lOkA
@maximlott ..you can of course argue that some people are irrational, but then it hardly makes sense to combat the problem with incentives based on the assumption of economic rationality.
@maximlott Even with massive substitutes, it would be very difficult to see how it would make economic sense to have a kid as a single parent for financial reasons. The impact on your life and the effort required just to keep your head above water makes it completely irrational..
@maximlott Thinking about how to combat the problem of single parenthood, free and simple access to birth control, as well as proper sexual education in schools is probably the most effective means.
@maximlott ..and being divorced/separated would not make a difference to that at all. Arguably, the notion that it automatically should fall on the mother to raise a child herself if parents are separated is based in highly archaic and anti-feminist notions of gender.
@maximlott On this note, you could argue that single motherhood is highly inconsistent with modern/feminist ways of looking at gender, which would lead to the conclusion that parental responsibility as well as financial responsibility should be split evenly between men and women...
@maximlott It depends what you mean by single parenting,but overall I'm not sure it's true. Anecdotally, I thunk its much more common than in many other countries for children's time to be split more evenly between fathers and mothers in the case of separation or divorce.
@maximlott Single parents are already limited in the time and effort they have avaiable for their children, and are often people with low education. It is not good go put them in a situation where they must neglect their kids even more in order to work 14 hour days to put food on the table.
@maximlott Furthermore, even if there may be a small minority of cases where it becomes an incentive, it still makes a lot of sense to provide extra support to single parents moms and dads). It is even worse for a child to be raised by a single parents if that parent can't afford to.
@maximlott ..women actively choosing to leave their partners and raise children without the father in order to take advantage of welfare payments.
@maximlott The reason for single motherhood are complex - they include fathers going to prison or choosing to leave, fathers refusing to take responsibility when a child comes unexpectedly, or in some cases even death or illness. I find in extremely hard to believe that a big driver is...
@maximlott That said, government can likely do a lot more to support shared custody in cases where relationships break down. Both parents can still be present even if they are separated, and this should be the best practice when the parents don't feel that they can continue to be together.
@maximlott That said, I think the point that government support for single mothers has caused fathers to be more absent is a massive stretch - in spite of the anecdotes from an interview in the eighties.
@maximlott Congratulations on your first video as host! I think you bring up a very important point here, and I think it's super important that we tell the story of how fathers play an important role in children's development - which, as you point out, is consistent with the data.

@maximlott @bryan_caplan At the end of the day, the market values education *a lot*. If it really didn't make any difference, one would expect the market to figure out better and cheaper ways of detecting value.
@maximlott @bryan_caplan Caplan's argument presupposes that it is true that much education doesn't add any real knowledge or "learning how to think" or anything else of value. This may be true based on the available evidence, but it might also be an overgeneralisation based on a few limited scope studies
@maximlott @bryan_caplan Even more so because we don't really know what we are looking for. That is, its not straightforward to determine how to measure value of the actual learning in a good Liberal arts education.
@maximlott @bryan_caplan The measurement issue is a real problem with the rigorousness of caplan's critique. Because there are so many confounding variables it's almost impossible to seperate the signaling value from the "real" learning value.
@maximlott @bryan_caplan I thunk the closest you could get would be to compare degree holders with non-degree holders who have taken a the same course load in open online courses. But extremely difficult to measure.
@maximlott @bryan_caplan I'm not sure you can estimate signaling value by comparing different subjects, because you don't know the relative proportion of signaling and real value there is in each. Just because something is not obviously relevant doesn't mean it doesn't have real value.

@Education4Libs @Nov2018election Much easier for good guys with guns (including police) to stop a guy with a handgun than a guy with an assault rifle.
@Education4Libs @Nov2018election A pistol is a far less dangerous weapon than an assault rifle - much more difficult to be accurate, less powerful munition, lower rate of fire, smaller magazines, etc. Is it reasonable to infer that gun control is part of the reason he "only" had a handgun, and not an AR-15?
@maximlott @NateSilver538 It's perhaps only a theoretical point now - but if the right algorithms, money for exposure etc were not just important but (almost) entirely determined election outcomes, its difficult to argue that it would still be a democracy. We'd also be in a situation with no free will.
@maximlott @NateSilver538 Definitely agree with the latter. Does that mean regulation is in order?
@ameliatd @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight To be fair, this is a good article - but the summary-in-a-tweet seemed like a weak argument for a correct conclusion.
@ameliatd @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight Completely agree that this is a nonsensical way of approaching the opioid problem. But how is the decreasing popularity of the death penalty evidence that it will be ineffective? This is an uncharacteristically sloppy analysis for 538.
@maximlott @NateSilver538 Then again, that's predicated on the conditions already being in place for a 2-3 point move to in the vote to change the outcome. So Shapiro has a point about Hillary being a crappy candidate.
@maximlott And @NateSilver538 makes a compelling data based argument that *the* key thing that won trump the election in the endgame was comey's letter about the re-opening of the Hillary email investigation.
@maximlott Regardless, I think @NateSilver538 is right to say that the in-built tendency of social media to massively signal-reinforce sensational and hyper-partisan material through organic sharing and "interest"-based feeds was massively more important than Cambridge Analytica.
@maximlott I don't think we know enough to say how effective they are today, and what impact they had (for either side). Ben Shapiro saying it had no effect is an opinion, not a fact.
@maximlott In theory, if the algorithms become effective enough, you could imagine a situation where free choice is undermined to such an extent that elections can't really be called free and fair anymore (regardless osf which party wins).
@maximlott This is a fair point. That said I think it's still reasonable to assume that sm data mining techniques have become far more sophisticated and powerful between '12 and' 16. It's nevertheless difficult to determine when good campaigning becomes nefarious manipulation - if ever.
@maximlott Don't get me wrong - it's a very good thing the shooter got stopped, and gun control does not guarantee that mass shootings don't happen. Still, I wonder if the point at which someone needs to get shot, something has already gone wrong, and the real problem is not security

@maximlott In other words, *a lot* of voters might care quite a bit - but it still might not matter...
@maximlott Or, his voters won't believe it / care anyway, and those who do care believe would never vote for him in the first place?
@FergHodgson @JohnStossel @maximlott Fair point. But who, really, is the common man? And how common is he?

@maximlott @DonaldJTrumpJr The goal of terrorism is to spread fear. So if we turn it into a top-of-agenda scary threat we have already let the terrorists win.
@maximlott @DonaldJTrumpJr Terrorist attacks are like insurance salesmen, they should be avoided but not feared.
@maximlott @DonaldJTrumpJr We should absolutely fight terrorism - hard - but making it into a big scary thing is doing exactly what the terrorists want us to.
@maximlott @DonaldJTrumpJr Fair points. But overblown media attention given to tiny events like in Sthlm and Ldn massively exaggerate perceived threat from terrorism

@DonaldJTrumpJr @maximlott So much for not letting terrorists change our behaviour and influence policy...
@wikileaks @maximlott And how do we define political ads? Trump's tweets and speeches (not ads) were filled with personal attacks.
@wikileaks @maximlott Arguably Trump's personality was and still is the most important reason not to elect him, so maybe ok to focus on it?

@NateSilver538 And it ought to be rare.
@maximlott @PolitiFact I think you are right. It also arguably needs well educated people - so the problem is perhaps a wider one
@maximlott @PolitiFact interesting point. But this would also apply more broadly to education, job prospects,etc., not just journalism, no?
@maximlott @PolitiFact the real problem arises when discussions become isolated from each other, and stop interacting in a dialectic way
@maximlott @PolitiFact and accept that different outlets reflect different ways of looking at the world
@maximlott @PolitiFact so instead of worrying about bias, maybe it's more valuable to look at reporting as part of a discussion
@maximlott @PolitiFact and what one reporter honestly believes is balanced to the best of their ability may seem skewed or unfair to another
@maximlott @PolitiFact the words one chooses, what context to provide, which sources to use, etc. even more so.
@maximlott @PolitiFact just choosing what is worthy of reporting requires subjective judgement, and relies on how you look at the world
@maximlott @PolitiFact at the end of the day, there's no such thing as just objectively reporting the news.
@maximlott @PolitiFact Bill o'reilly had the most watched show on cable TV for 15 years, until he was overtaken by hannity. Liberal bias?
@maximlott @PolitiFact the right loves to complain about Liberal bias in the media, but that too is an accusation that lacks nuance
@maximlott @PolitiFact but it seems wrong to dumb down commentary that adds value and understanding in order to avoid being accused of bias
@maximlott @PolitiFact I agree that the "mostly false" label arguably isn't the right one. Politifact should probably be more nuanced
@maximlott @PolitiFact fair enough. But is true/false by itself really useful or interesting? Hitler was a dog lover - true.
@maximlott @PolitiFact perhaps whether or not a piece of information is true is sometimes less important than what context it is placed in..
@maximlott @PolitiFact I would also be very comfortable with true but highly misleading :) and arguably that's what they said?
@maximlott @PolitiFact they call it highly misleading. And aren't they right? https://t.co/Zw5PaOU3vl

@Rotevatn Eller at Buzzfeed er like bra som The Atlantic, fordi Buzzfeed er veldig gode på det de driver med?
@Rotevatn Fair enough. Men med samme logikk må vi vel også si at McDonald's er like bra som Maemo, fordi de driver med forskjellige ting?
@Rotevatn Ok, fair enough. Men tør vi virkelig ikke si at Morgenbladet jevnt over holder høyere kvalitet enn VG? Eller er det elitistisk?
