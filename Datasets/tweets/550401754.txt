If you haven‚Äôt already signed up for the next @RxSummit, I encourage you to save the date: March 28-31 in Atlanta, Georgia.
We need to get abuse deterrent meds to patients, so that folks won‚Äôt be tempted to crush, snort or inject these dangerous drugs. RxAbuse
The Pharma industry, with support of @US_FDA, is making great strides in developing pain meds that are resistant to abuse or tampering.
Doctors should be required to access their states‚Äô prescription drug monitoring program to get a glimpse at patient #Rx history.
After med school, doctors should be required to pursue continuing medical education in #RxAbuse treatment. #HHS
I am convinced that with more training in the medical community, we will have fewer Americans getting hooked on pain pills. #RxAbuse #HHS
Americans consume 75% of the world‚Äôs pain meds, but as 5% of the world's population, I'm sure we don't represent 75% of the world‚Äôs pain.
Its important that naloxone be a point of intervention ‚Äì that administration by a medical professional spur discussion for treatment options
There is a full spectrum of options for #RxAbuse &amp; doctors ought to be trained in all of them to decide what is best for the patient. #HHS
We need to be careful to realize that fighting fire with fire (or opioids with opioids) is not our only option. #HHS #RxAbuse
I have been disappointed by recent stories that aim to demonize abstinence-based treatment when it has undeniably worked for many.
If provided under the care of a medical professional trained in addiction, MAT can change lives. But it isn't the only option.
There is no ‚Äúone size, fits all‚Äù #RxAbuse treatment. We need to foster a regimen which tailors a patient‚Äôs treatment to individual needs.
It's heartening to see federal leaders, like @SecBurwell uniting colleagues to address the crisis: #DOJ, @CDCgov, #HHS, @ONDCP &amp; Congress.
Just like UNITE uses a multi-faceted strategy at the local level, those of us in DC need to be looking at this challenge holistically. #HHS
