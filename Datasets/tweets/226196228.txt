@MyPartnerTest @realDonaldTrump Fake journalists are an enemy of the people passing off opinion as fact.That sir is called propaganda. No one called for violence against journalists. One guy who sued and threatened the newspaper had a personal vendetta. Ramos lost his defamation case.
@paulsperry_ Actually it was a personal vendetta because of an article ran about the suspect.And Subsequently, a defamation that was thrown out.

@Roxy33000 @Randan77 @qanon76 I also remember a rumor that was said to be a conspiracy theory from two years ago. That basically said two investigators that were investigating Bengazi ended up dead. Everyone said it was a hoax at the time, but that's what they said about JFK too.
@Roxy33000 @Randan77 @qanon76 Yes, I remember that, but he had zero back up.

@DraconesHc @ladymachir @FoxBusiness @Jim_Jordan I read all of it. The actual document said there was bias...not the summary or the intro tho.We need to get the first drafts and some oversight on this.
@realDonaldTrump I was extremely disheartened today by Wray's press conference. I hope indictments are coming.  I Respect the rule of law and due process,but it has taken enormous amount of time just to get here. Send in someone who can get this done...please.
@realDonaldTrump Is it true you already paid the money back with fines? I saw that on PBS. I figured I would ask the source.
@SCPorts @RepSanfordSC @LindseyGrahamSC @henrymcmaster @SenatorTimScott @Clyburn @CongJoeWilson @TGowdySC @RepJeffDuncan @RepTomRice @RalphNorman Okay you still have some time left... I read the entire OIG report. Wray was extremely disappointing at his press conference. Do something! 9 people broke the law. If it was me who had broke the law,I'd already be in jail.
@Jim_Jordan I was expecting something more substantial. Wray at his press conference was disappointing. The FBI needs serious oversight and maybe some hand holding to do what is right. If that was me, I'd would already be in a cell,but this slow walking is ridiculous.

@Kelly28227 @NatashaBertrand I read that earlier it is just a petition for discovery. A few things that are damming if that is the evidence, but I will hold back my judgement until it goes to court. I want to see the discovery myself. If he is dirty, I want justice.
@Kelly28227 @theTradLife @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 I am not sure exactly. It looks like several people are going down for prosecution...I am still reading. It is a very thorough report. Haven't gotten to page12 yet..  I am curious what you think after reading it.
It is long people...just a warning. https://t.co/On0RyIdliZ
@Kelly28227 @theTradLife @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 As I do, but only until proof is established. The OIG report is coming out today at 5 pm that should give us plenty to talk about. The press sec is scheduled to speak at 2pm est.
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan That is outrageous! I am appalled that anyone in the fbi thinks they have that much power.
@Kelly28227 @theTradLife @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 Actually, I have no political allegiance. I am against all child traffickers,all corrupt.I am an independent as well. I have no idea what happened to any deleted tweets As I haven't been on Twitter for long,Maybe someone out there knows...
@realDonaldTrump Happy Birthday, Mr. President.
@cher You should publicly apologize. He already sent 100 million dollars to Flint to repair the water infrastructure.
@theTradLife @Kelly28227 @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 Thank you trad. I am usually middle of the road,and look for evidence first.
@NefertitiVerita @realDonaldTrump Actually,it is just a petition...no final court order. I'll wait for that.
@ScottNYRose @NefertitiVerita @realDonaldTrump Thank you,Scott.
@Kelly28227 @theTradLife @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 It is probably because you assumed I was talking about a political party. I was referring to answering a poll on Twitter and being attacked for it...just like you did.
@NefertitiVerita @realDonaldTrump They tried to extort a settlement. Not uncommon.
@Kelly28227 @theTradLife @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 I do not have a side,but thank you for pointing out that I am an American first and foremost. Funny, I don't like the double standard either. Maybe you should not assume you know anything about another person until you know them.
@theTradLife @_etgeeee_ @neubienose @Kelly28227 @TommyEhrlich @James_politico @charliekirk11 Yea...why answer if we gonna be attacked for it?
@northwestyogi @Judd5ter @luigibleu @Mellzah @KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just because you are the loudest,doesn't mean you are the biggest...
@BAPDCO @ChatByCC 1998 paris
RT @charliekirk11: Net worth before running for President: 		Trump - 4.5 billion 	Obama - $3 million 	Clinton - $500,000		Current net worth…
@NoScience4WAR @QuriousQanon99 @EyeTheSpy @TheRealCheshCat @NKSummit_ First,it was a question. No need to be defensive. All, I can find is this photo. The better one has now been deleted.  https://t.co/E6GPXnqk6M
@NoScience4WAR @QuriousQanon99 @EyeTheSpy @TheRealCheshCat @NKSummit_ Who is this guy? He was in the photo that Sec Pompeo released today. Pompeo was thanking a group of guys for their work in Singapore.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should stop calling them fake news...All news has an agenda and is propaganda. Btw, I will be pissed if the OIG report is heavily redacted.We have been waiting too long for this to come out. Great job in Singapore,sir.
@bethanyshondark Maybe you should do the same... Ignore the political party lines, I.e. narrative and bring all Americans together.
@bethanyshondark Bethany, I am neither a  Republican or A Democrat. So before you judge which you will, as evidenced by your judgement of a 15 year old, I am an American. I will vote and make determinations on who to vote based on the best assessment of the candidate's abilities and character.
@DeeRobi31628176 @BTrivison @chicksonright Nah, the roosters are misogynistic cows.
@RepTedDeutch He wasn't attacking the news or free press. He was simply stating that those who lie to push a narrative are fake. Why are you butthurt? Are you lying to push a narrative?
@MarkSanford I had high hopes for you while you were in office, but then you went to Venezuela and I knew you were dirty. That's why I voted the other way! Not Trump's idea... Mine.
@Iddybud No ,we do not embrace the dirty. If you are dirty,we will vote the other way.
@kabamur_taygeta Question... I have observed a higher vibration in other people happening around me... Are they causing this Or are we?
@BornABadass2 @realDonaldTrump No,the biggest allies, the ones who called themselves are friends have been acting like enemies for a long time now.  If a friend of mine stabbed me in the back,and stole my children, I would stop the friendship too.
@xguojin @realDonaldTrump World governments are totally corrupt, not partially,and not in the best interest of humans.
@RealEyeTheSpy Any update on Larry Kudlow?
@MicahKolding @KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I did read it. The actual document. Not what reporters were saying about it. All networks were making suppositions.
@Mellzah @KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump think I'm very well-prepared. I don’t think I have to prepare very much. It's about attitude, it's about willingness to get things done. But I think I have been prepared for this summit for a very long time,” Trump said in the Oval Office when asked by a reporter .
@MicahKolding @KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Read the second sentence. He has been making deals for at least 50 years. Second, he is extremely reliable. Fact, at 4 am on the tarmac meeting our hostages. Actually ,the document commits to complete denuclearization. Read it. No concessions were made.
@KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump "I think I'm very well-prepared. I don’t think I have to prepare very much. It's about attitude, it's about willingness to get things done. But I think I have been prepared for this summit for a very long time,” Trump said in the Oval Office when asked by a reporter .
@Judd5ter @northwestyogi @Mellzah @KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump For what? World peace, a great economy, fair trade, the end of corruption, the end of human trafficking?  Those who are the loudest are usually the most dirty and the most wrong. Question everything.
@Judd5ter @northwestyogi @Mellzah @KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump When are you just gonna be hopeful that complete denuclearization is gonna happen?  Why bash? Division is all that you are creating. Can't we all just get along?
@oliverg2014 @realDonaldTrump Actually your meme is incorrect, ....smh
@Patrici50952853 @realDonaldTrump Our allies aren't acting like friends are they?
@moyusuf14 @realDonaldTrump Well when your supposed allies act like enemies...
@KathrynMarieMcC @john_meketa @rageinggranny @RCalohan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Do you honestly think there was a lack of preparation? Sec. Pompeo has had lots meetings. Maybe you weren't watching?
@TheRealCheshCat Not sure I trust her tho...spitting hate on her Twitter account calling Tommy Robinson a bigot white supremacist. Wasn't he a journalist trying to cover a story about rapists?
@TheRealCheshCat @MateoSPage Looks like they are reporting Larry Ludlow had a minor heart attack and will make a full recovery. That's good news.
@TheRealCheshCat @Friochilly @MindFullDesignz There was a reporter on scene who said there was one suspect in the back of a capitol police car, but capitol police's official statement was there was No active shooter and the call saying so came from a third party. So, I am utterly confused by this well.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump A wrecking ball? I think you are projecting.When are you going to do your job for the American people?
@JonZielinski1 @realDonaldTrump No,  I based my opinion based on your own words.
@4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump I suggest you read the 89 pages before talking out your a#*. It makes you look uninformed.	https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	How many lies can you tell in one day Palmer report?Here is some advice talk to the horses' mouth not the other end.
@PedotoSot25 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	I suggest you read. It is good. 89 pages.
@dffisher @realDonaldTrump You do realize this was a Supreme Court decision?
@JonZielinski1 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	I always suggest reading before forming an opinion.
@mayqueeeen @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	Read.
@mryannagy @realDonaldTrump Read. You can read right?	https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6
@4_TouchDowns @realDonaldTrump Actually.this was a SC decision. Nothing to do with The President.	https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6
@CPTDoomDC @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	Read before forming an opinion. Or are you a sheep?
@Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump Do you always think what people tell you to?	https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	Quit being lazy. Read.
@david36604 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6	Read first.
@JonZielinski1 @realDonaldTrump Learn about the law before believing the fake news. Read.https://t.co/ISgiRpnLR6
@KikiwahTara @TheRealCheshCat No formal charges are listed either in Sweden or the US courts as of 1 week ago. Assange basically has statue of limitations of 2020 in Sweden for rape. In the US, I am not even sure what the charges would be given how many documents involved...
@KikiwahTara @TheRealCheshCat I am not sure if he has been charged, but I have noticed a lot of the early classified docs have been declassified by trump.
@TheRealCheshCat I did see Pamela Andersen asking for JA's pardon in the news. I hope that happens. Trump could pardon him.
@TheRealCheshCat @Quirky80458101 There are no limits either...only self imposed.This is a great time to live.
@De_Niro_Officia I used to like and appreciate your work,but that is before I found out...	Tomorrow should be interesting.
@RealMAGASteve @doc_jason @MilitaryEarth @30SecMilitary @Military_First @codeofvets @kwilli1046 @grizz_meister @pinkk9lover @Jamierodr10 @justanavywife @CodeOfPatriots It is a debt we can never repay, but. I truly appreciate you and your family's sacrifice for my family and neighbors.
@LisaMei62 OMG, yes! Thank you! Makes perfect sense.
@RepBarbaraLee You can't call someone a friend when they repeated stab you in the back.
@SarahKSilverman How is that show going strangers with candy? The loudest are always the most guilty. You must be scared after Weinstein's arrest. He sang like a little bird on everyone.
@SarahKSilverman @LeoRules1 Yup, illegally invading our country, stealing our resources,using our facilities without any compensation. Not to mention human trafficking.
@TheRealCheshCat It actually makes sense now.
@RepSwalwell @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP No ,with stand with American citizens.
@RepDonBeyer Good ,but what exactly did the cable say?You are paraphrasing to say the least.
@tomperriello Except you do see this is just a photo op,right? And now you look...well....dumb.
@tomperriello Sure,sure. Until they realize,that they need the US.Why are we funding the UN again?
@RepGregoryMeeks We don't negotiate with terrorists and pedophiles. You know better.
@AGBecerra @pbartolone Who are you kidding? No one has access to quality medical care,but our senators and representatives. Doctors won't even accept Obama's Healthcare. You guys can do better, make a better plan. CDC already has the analysis breakdown.
@SenatorCardin @SenateDems @POTUS When you are more concerned about Americans than citizens from other countries, Our citizens benefit. Either build a wall or shut off human trafficking, those are your options.
@SenatorMenendez Not likely. It will show them we aren't a bunch of pushovers. Grow a pair.
@RepDonBeyer He is getting a fair deal.What are you doing?
@RepSwalwell @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP We do not stand with pedophiles. Maybe you forgot that.We also don't negotiate with terrorists. FYI
@RepAdamSchiff Is that all you got?We have it all.
@radar1093 @FoxBusiness @SebGorka My husband got an 8%bonus...highest we have ever seen. Trickle down effect from companies getting a tax cut. More hiring than we have seen in20 years.
@billmaher You are so out of touch. You literally bashed more than half of America. You must be going thru withdrawal or you are trying to stay relevant. United we stand.
@DevlinBarrett @johncusack Until we do DNA testing we won't know if they were really family.
@SenGillibrand @SenFeinstein I hope you are including DNA testing to make sure they are the kids parents.
@RepAdamSchiff Sounds like you are projecting again. You must be scared because everyone knows what you did last summer.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Then,do your job. Your job is to protect Americans... Aren't you also responsible for drafting laws?
@SenatorCantwell You are responsible for writing the laws in this country. Do your job!
@SenDuckworth Then do your job...write a bill...you are ultimately responsible for that.
@ChrisMurphyCT Wow, that is a stretch... You must be worried.
@RepKarenBass Okay, how about in that bill,we also have limitations on impeachment only if criminal activity was done while in office?  Not based on whether your team lost...
@BillPascrell @tedlieu He has pardoned 7 people.Really?Don't you have a job to do that doesn't waste taxpayer money?
@dinahsteward @SenBlumenthal https://t.co/P5voEmLuk6
@EyeTheSpy @nonspamming @CbboFOtcZs Play nice, we have to live with each other after this all goes down.
@dinahsteward @SenBlumenthal Actually, look at the map of human trafficking around the world.  It is much bigger than you think.
@dinahsteward @SenBlumenthal Thank goodness we got them out of the hands of Pedos.
@baird_sylbaird @Haroldj111 @SenBlumenthal Neither is eating it molesting children. Stop the human trafficking.
@NickCoombe @SueDenim18 @SerenityTau @RickAMDay @mollylyons @SenBlumenthal The UN countries are just mad...most don't have any exports but children.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Schumer,it is you who are the joke. A strong person stands up for our children. An immoral ally who sells people like commodities, eats children,and sells out the American public is treason. Keep your friends close but your enemies closer.
@RepBarbaraLee Why did they deny you? We have had them for over 50 years...duh.
@chrissyteigen Do you think with all the suicides that have gone on this week that it is coincidental?  When do you they(the cabal)will come?
@RepTedDeutch @katgal2 It wasn't dissolved. 		The 25 members of the Consumer Advisory Board, established by law as part of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were told on a conference call Wednesday that the board would not meet again until new members are appointed.
@klingensmith_j @RepDonBeyer Nope,just a person who happens to know about the hundred million dollars sent to Flint.
@SonofLiberty357 It really isn't these men's fault. Coddling, chemicals in our water and food,and sensitivity training helped cause this issue.
@Hanhnguyen79 @ABC Neither is unbiased. Fox or CNN or ABC.
@applecharlie5 @Robert4787 @NastyNastyVet @ABC Give em a chance...that redpill is a little difficult to swallow...let them research...they know not what they are talking about yet.This will help.	https://t.co/5r220NzCpZ
@JeremyinAkron @Serenitydogg @ABC Nope, dirty is dirty. I want all the corrupt gone no exceptions regardless of what political party they are with. Americans first.
@_ImperatorRex_ @almostjingo @GenFlynn Who knows where the bodies are buried?
@almostjingo @Nick_Falco @ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein I really like this guy...Sen	Grassley.
@LawLibCongress @librarycongress Thank you, for your transparency.
Thank you,current administration for your complete transparency!  https://t.co/5r220NzCpZ
@mynamdeplume @JJDoD3891 Actually, look up my page the global map is on 🔥.
https://t.co/hTtagmWqBn
@SkenePhilosophy @therealroseanne Interesting Bill &amp;Hillary Clinton both show up on the flight plans to Little St.James(Epstein Island), hmm I would never known.
@mynamdeplume @JJDoD3891 Just wait. No look up on Google child sex trafficking busts since August 2017. Plenty of proof. In fact,there was one today.
@LiberalNavySeal @joenapoli7 @PrincessSoupCan @passantino Actually that video is on Weiner's laptop,and will be coming out shortly.
@RepDonBeyer If Trump was against clean air and clean water,why would he sign a massive budget to fix the water supplies?Remember Flint.
@MichaelZibit23 @MSNBC @trilingual1946 Stormy Daniels is part of NVIXM. So,when is her arrest gonna be so I watch?
@EyeTheSpy @Stephanielk1 Can anyone see me? Am I shadowbanned I would appreciate it fam if you can tell me if you see me.
@EyeTheSpy Who was this?	https://t.co/9YtAozGtez
@EyeTheSpy @Mumsyto2 Good! A housecleaning is in order.
@Snowden @nytimes Thank you.
@GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Actually he was quoting someone else, you might want to read.
@RepTedLieu @POTUS Not threats to our children...?
@haterofgreed @ReutersBiz Before you tweet look up some facts..
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Senator Merkley, when the world find out about the skeletons in your closet, there will be hell to pay.
@drovja @TECH4U_20 @shayrapet @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Really,is that why Hillary also said it?
@RepAdamSchiff Shifty shift,should n't you be running now since the OIG report is about to drop?
@Scotus It isn't based on religion if it is a peaceful religion,but those that murder,rape,and traffic children are fair game.
@boogeywithstu40 @realDonaldTrump That is not nice! Are you in middle school? Use your manners and your indoor voice.
@TalbertSwan @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump Are you sure about that Bishop? Maybe you should go pray for forgiveness.
@Simpsonn019 @realDonaldTrump Are you sure about that Simpson?
@TruthOfTrevor @realDonaldTrump Nope,we are still here..watching you snowflakes melt down.
@madasednam @realDonaldTrump He is putting tariffs on countries that actively human traffic children, drug run,and produce chemical weapons. Look up the documentation.
@Resist_TheClown @realDonaldTrump Really,you guys are going to hound the President for not being a singer? He was probably off key...smh...so he paused..big deal.
@Blocklegend14 @realDonaldTrump Who stood over Americans with flags on their coffins when she knew she made it happen?Remember Bengazi.
@aangrybirdd @SecPompeo We can't leave until every human trafficker is done. We cannot play with children's lives.
@TalbertSwan @GregShugar @amysuds @realDonaldTrump Name calling without proof lessens your case.
@realDonaldTrump I love my country. I love my family. I appreciate the work you are doing. The brainwashed will wake up soon. Hang in there.
@MarksMars @Erik_Robbins_ @EyeTheSpy @jack No do not seek answers from the universe. Know thyself...and ask yourself. You have it all already.
@realDonaldTrump I am really surprised at how hateful these comments are...this is getting old...grow up. It is one thing to not like someone personally, but to not even give a person a chance to do his job..it's unreal,the amount of unfairness.I don't watch football. No skin off my nose.
@facebook Okay, Facebook, I deleted my accounts months ago,remove my accounts. I keep having friends check them...still there.
@HymieHiesenberg @VP @POTUS @FLOTUS @SecondLady Were you dropped on your head as a baby?
@BleuSuerte @jonny_red32 @Mediaite @law_newz @HillaryClinton Child sex trafficking and murder.
I hope this is how they are gonna keep the market from imploding. https://t.co/8FIhHOTDBk
@EyeTheSpy I am glad we have a President who is into women for a change, lol.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Yay!
@treehugger90802 @realDonaldTrump No, they aren't laughing anymore...look at Iran, they are scared sh*tless. Pleading and begging for support when they knew where the children were and what they were going to used for(sacrifice)... Worldwide peace that is the goal...Take aim higher, our children deserve a chance.
@realDonaldTrump Try not to let it get to you.I realize you are human, but the things you are doing are important and unprecedented. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump We are keeping track. Keep it going!	https://t.co/Ip3fYa50gf
@realDonaldTrump Good job, Mr President! Keep the (heads) rolling.
@LisaMei62 Please tell me this is an f...ing joke!Unbelievable!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, if you have time, could you please address the problem in public schools since it is apparent that reading comprehension is down in our schools.
@rusdall @realDonaldTrump Wait until you watch the tapes of Hillary that one is a horror show.
@valerieonmaui @realDonaldTrump People die. President Trump can't stop it. Death is a part of life. So,are you gonna blame him for every person who dies? He isn't GOD.
@Icanbelievemyey @realDonaldTrump That is not nice. You cannot speak to the highest authority in the country like that...grow up.
@FedUpResistrGrL @realDonaldTrump Yeah ,Hillary used it too....during The bengazi depositions.
@skeller85 @realDonaldTrump Again, where is your proof of wrong doing? So, your old tired argument, wah wah wah, we (Hillary) didn't win.
@_ReaalAmerican_ @Patri56 @realDonaldTrump Where's your proof that the President did this? if you can't find any...please shut it.
@RepAdamSchiff How can you fire someone who you don't know is lying when they are doing it?
@Katie4Trump @LarrySchweikart Treason requires a public execution.
@gfgjr @LarrySchweikart There is no statue of limitations for murder,rape,and treason.
@CarlHensley3 @robbystarbuck @CNN Please turn your TV off.And read.
@Dalton_Stigmata @rurrozt @robbystarbuck @CNN Actually both have snippets of real information, but then you have to go research for yourself, but all their programming is propaganda,subliminal  messaging, and mind control techniques such as hypnosis.
@BadAstronomer I  hope he pardons Flynn.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Well done! Looking good.
@Rhyne0929 @EyeTheSpy Sr or Jr? Sr was a pedophile. Open source. 2 15 yr male prostitutes have on video that they were snuck into WH and participated in criminal sex acts.
@AndrewOnSeeAIR @SenFeinstein Yes we should send them all back. Legal immigration exists.
@SenFeinstein Why didn't you introduce legislation while Obama was in office?Of that's right the white house was in on the child sex trafficking. How can you sleep at night?
@MichelleObama @BarackObama You must really regret that speech you made praising Weinstein now?
@BarackObama @MichelleObama Why are you wishing Michael a Happy Mother's Day?
@BarackObama Oh orange will be your new color!
@HillaryClinton Still in a backbrace, huh?
@HillaryClinton @Everytown @MomsDemand Then, stop staging events like Parkland.
@HillaryClinton Why you were doing it? In even greater numbers.
@realDonaldTrump Look up US Treasury Dept on Twitter. I applaud your stance on human trafficking and sex slaves.Anyone in violation of that should feel the effects including Canada.
@Outnfullyawake @Microsingular @malavai00x @F8ceman @realDonaldTrump This is true,but let's make it clear Obama's administration tripled the debt. Why did he pay1.8 b dollars for a soldier who went AWOL?
@Lady_RainMaker @a1411522414 @NoScience4WAR @EyeTheSpy @POTUS I can remember in 2011-2012 President Trump saying he was thinking of running for President. It was in a interview on the street in NY.
@obr_sean @SeanWill92 @nickjfrost @realDonaldTrump Mean is still mean. Grow up it isn't kindergarten anymore.
@realDonaldTrump Why with all the specific labels?I thought liberals want to be inclusive. Or was that a lie?
@Shaler1967 @realDonaldTrump Not everyone agrees hence the debate.
@badnono78 @Marketers_Edge @TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump I thought we wanted fair and equal treatment for everyone.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS This is just wretched. It makes me cry for the children.
@mflynnJR @FullFrontalSamB I stopped watching her a long time ago. Brain washing in television( all networks )is not okay.
@realDonaldTrump I want to believe in the power of redemption, but I also know that there have been plenty of people setup by a corrupt system. I was setup myself.	We should fix the system. Thank you for taking this problem seriously.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe I just don't know enough about Dinesh. Is there something that was obtained illegally that was used against him? Something like entrapment?Or a setup? I once was forced to plead no contest to a charge because I couldn't prove it was somebody else's.
@hardhouz13 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Unfounded allegations can result in libel cases I would watch yourself.
@Kakaymarie01 @therealroseanne @RealKiraDavis I have never been a racist, I have judged people in my life and who I have met by the content of their character.
@good_wifey @VP @POTUS That is not nice. I am sure you learned in kindergarten not to say mean things.
@Debdicker @VP @POTUS Look up Flint. Already being fixed,but never made CNN. Look up Puerto Rico new solar array in place already.
@TheRealMcpcd @realDonaldTrump That is not nice !didn't you learn in kindergarten not to talk to people like that?
@HarvardChanSPH @afrakt @aaronecarroll @nytimes Maybe because I don't trust your vaccines...
@zoekrupka Teaching moments end when you stop assuming a person's heritage based on physical appearance.
@doc_jason @HHSGov @DHSgov @TheJusticeDept How can this happen? 5000 children given to who?I PRAY TO ALL THAT IS HOLY THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE SAFE.
@loondale @samsung_lotto_p @therealroseanne That was not nice. Let her celebrate their success. May those two young men always prosper.
@easydoesit41 @Deeekapp @KurtMSchermerh1 @MeetThePress @janestreet It is already done.
@Jeremy26302786 @spies60 @caciquecaonao @MeetThePress @janestreet @BarackObama Where is the adenosine?Must be getting desperate now.
@VtLakey @HTJ2016 @Zachydoodle8485 @f_clochettes @krassenstein Wait until the IG reports drop.And wait until Julian Assange testifies. Then you can call me crazy.
@ZumaDogg Did anybody find out yet?
@CoreyHenson76 @StormySkies9 @THEsaragilbert @therealroseanne @Rond_m @prayingmedic @MagniFieri @realDonaldTrump @qanon76 @EyeTheSpy The only people spewing that Trump supporters are racist seems to be you.
@RachMiata @realDonaldTrump They can't use a calculator in prison. I am just waiting on the sealed indictments to become unsealed.
@sutton2429 @realDonaldTrump No if you are innocent, you howl and make it rain.
@NeilYoungSaveUs Bless the meek for they shall inherit the earth.
@peter_cazar @UrbanAchievr is it really racism if we are going after All the corrupt and vile?
@EdKrassen @krassenstein Do not assume to know me for we will take down the wicked and corrupt because they will not take our children from us to do vile things.
@SenSchumer You mean informant or foreign liaison from the UK?
@RepLeeZeldin 3 Hours is more than I have seen of my representatives in SC. Grow up people name calling is not the way to change anything.
@realDonaldTrump To the past, present,and future soldiers who by their commitment protected/protects  the freedoms and liberties that I hold so dear I love you and appreciate you. There is not an amount that I can ever repay, but know that I will always support you.
@MarisaJBaldwin @bowlingmailman @realDonaldTrump Our President may not be eloquent, but at least he didn't leave our soldiers behind to be killed.#bengazi
@mcox75 @realDonaldTrump What are you gonna do when Barack Obama goes to prison for treason?
@ChrisMurphyCT What exactly is the "live art"that was being shipped during Obama's admission? And why does it receive no inspections at customs?
@RepAdamSchiff Except you forgot one thing, we have it all.
@royalviking04 @therealroseanne What happens if the ones who did their homework gets the A?
@Pr0Truthh @therealroseanne @royalviking04 It is only illegal because it was classified material, but I don't know if you noticed most of the material posted on Wikileaks is now declassified. He may only get a slap on the wrist.
@LionelMedia @therealroseanne I wonder what sort of dirt she has on him.
@NetflixFilm Pedoporn. I am so disgusted.
@SLSmith000 @realDonaldTrump Do you guys know what is going on? Huge child trafficking ring on multiple continents. The 1500 children missing happened from 2009 -2015. This is a mess inherited from Obama's administration.
@SpeakerRyan I cannot support a Pope who paid almost 4 billion dollars for child sexual assault cases. I do not see how you can either...
@Scotus Just Beautiful!
@PatriciaRyan17 @BiggPinky @JTMYVA @realDonaldTrump Not a bot.Aren't you gonna be surprised when you find out Hillary sold uranium already, spied on trump using the UK, planted a fake dossier, and murdered children?Why aren't you upset that you were betrayed?
@tracybeanz I never had Netflix. When I learned Soros owned a huge chunk of that company, I  was appalled.
@realDonaldTrump Definitely rigged.What were they trying to hide?
@realDonaldTrump I love the symbolism. Poetry usually isn't a strong point of mine. I prefer transparency in my readings. So when are the indictments on ex-President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Susan Rice coming?
@NancyPelosi Isn't it weird that the CDC under Trump's administration is sending the Ebola vaccine to the Congo when we had it during The Obama administration?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Isn't ZTE where your burner phone came from? I can forward you the shipping photos if you like.
@575haiku @NancyPelosi At least he wasn't selling children.Right,Nancy?
@fowerli @RodStryker Really? Why was Facebook originally called Lifelog and run by the CIA? Why is Google listed as a subcontractor of the U.S. government? Why was the designation of a government entity status changed to allow it to be publicly traded on Wall Street?
@MaryPipat Thank you to all our True Patriots!
@bartlet4amer @Amberly13812444 Aren't you causing more division? The reason is issue is important to me is the child trafficking and sex crimes perpetrated. I would think you would want this to stop.
@bartlet4amer Even the Pope paid almost 4b dollars to child sex trafficking, child molesting charges. Look at the big picture. I am not a Republican or A Democrat. The corrupt now have to pay the piper. My children aren't here for their sick games.
@bartlet4amer Second, why aren't you in outrage about pizza gate or #pedogate? Why did the amount of missing children from around the world spike during the Obama administration,but is now dropping? Please wake up these people we thought we knew betrayed our trust.
@bartlet4amer First it wasn't Trump's policy. He inherited this mess from Obama. It has been in practice since Bush.
@Totalitarian_1 @POTUS Good work!
All Russiagate Roads Lead To London As Evidence Emerges Of Joseph Mifsud's Links To  UK Intelligence https://t.co/Af8Eofd0mW
@HiMaui @CBP @CBPWestTexas @CBPArizona @DHSgov @SecNielsen You lost me when you called me a Nazi.
@realDonaldTrump And zero media coverage to boot!
@Jim_Jordan Did you see this? Bias reporting helps no one. The research does. https://t.co/3gF5M9L2DV
@AGoodStoic Here's an interesting read., but again only a theory. https://t.co/McaZp57SmW
@OARichardEngel @tparsi @MSNBC @RichardEngel Who is he talking about? NBC why are  you editing the most important part? And why is the volume so low? I just wasted my time.
@kherm14 @realDonaldTrump Actually wait until the evidence is presented, jumping on a bandwagon is folly.Just my advice.
@analysisnytimes @NBCNews @RichardEngel @obama Wow, that was unproductive. Told me nothing. Just supposition. NBC quit wasting my time.Stop bias reporting. The news should be telling all sides of the story.All evidence.That's what investigative reporting means.
@AGoodStoic You have evidence of this accusation?Any proofs?
@TheKRockUpdate @realDonaldTrump Actually Clapper on Fox news admitted from his own mouth that there were spies inserted into the campaign. Read or listen to both sides to get a full picture.
@TheKRockUpdate @realDonaldTrump How about pizza gate? And pedophilia?
@robreiner Because... I am voting for Trump in the next election and I am not religious or evangelical. Labels help no one.
@robreiner Except that almost all propaganda attacks occur after the election.
@realDonaldTrump I am not sure if you saw this, but ...but the new research coming out of Washington state. The mussels contain opioids. Can you have Pruitt look into this?Opioid addiction being peed into the Puget Sound.https://t.co/rCqEqAHaLo
@USNavy @NavalAcademy @USMC Congratulations! I wish Alton L.Grizzard were here to see this.He'd be proud.
@l_burcher @An_fibrofog @JoyAnnReid Please do some research on Puerto Rico.
@tjgranger74 @JoyAnnReid I am happy you have an opinion and can think. Please read the Constitution,The Bill of Rights,and Associated amendments.Then read the executive powers of the President. Then, tell me how he personally violated any law and provide proof. Not supposition.
@khristiepaulson @JoyAnnReid We won't  stop racism by arguing amongst ourselves. Only love can conquer hate.
@winsdy @JoyAnnReid Name calling does not make your case solid.
@irishrygirl @JoyAnnReid @Rosie310501 They still have the ability to wait on the sidelines,in the locker room, just not to hold a public protest on private property.
@An_fibrofog @LeonardHougham @JoyAnnReid Kenya does too.
@Maryleemilazzo @JoyAnnReid Please read the bill of rights. Then realize that every state also has a different version of law.
@luckydoghot @JoyAnnReid @NFLPA The NFL voted on it. Only one team, the Jets said no. The NFL is a corporation who lost 10%in revenue because the fans only came to the game to see the game. Not a protest.Not a government agency. Corporations can make their own policies within the law.
@patriautism @JoyAnnReid @jncbooks This should be good when Obama , Hillary,and Huma are indicted.What are you gonna do when you find out they were involved in heinous crimes, &amp; money laundering.
@JenniferDePott1 @JoyAnnReid Also, Puerto Rico has power we sent the Army Corp of engineers. As of a month ago 60% have power.Also Elon Musk built a huge solar array. It all takes time.Lots of mountains.
@JenniferDePott1 @JoyAnnReid Flint has clean water now that Trump's EPA Scott Pruitt sent 100 million dollars last year for renovation. Obama's administration never sent any. Remember during the campaign Hillary's speech in Flint, residents 2 years without clean water at the time.
@JoyAnnReid Actually,that's isn't what he said. The twisting of someone else's words is called lying which doesn't help your credibility.
@davidhogg111 @Publix That's extortion.
@ItsAngryBob Thank goodness,there was a man with a gun.This could have been much worse. Police take approximately 5-6 minutes to respond to 911.
@WiredSources @ItsAngryBob We will see if it will pass the house.And in one version US Treasury funds can still be used in certain circumstances. How about we all just keep our hands to ourselves?
@Pigletscooter @WiredSources Can you get me an actual link to the data?
@Microsingular Actually,it is a spider hence the cobwebs all over dollars.
@CatoInstitute @MikePompeo4USA And completely capitalist society like ours was in the early1800s was detrimental to the citizens health. Moderation is key in everything.
@MikePompeo4USA Actually, I agree that the funding should be gotten, but can't we hang them or something after a fair trial or tribunal. Maybe the UN could do It. It is just so much cheaper.
@mariposa2566 @PeteSessions Name calling?Is that all you got? In unity, only then can we fix what is broken.
@brucedudley1 @PeteSessions Flint Michigan got 100m in funding already last year to clean up that mess. Obama let them sit for almost 3 years without access to clean water. Trump funded them in less than a year.
@VotersDemand @sms0257 @PeteSessions @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @CNN @Oprah @HillaryClinton @MSNBC Won't you be surprised when Obama gets indicted for treason? Then, he'll claim his Kenyan citizenship.
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Ray Chavez, thank you for your service. Mr. President,thank you for all your hard work especially Flint Michangan last year. My heart just broke when they lived for years during the Obama Administration without access to clean water.
@MaraReinstein @RealCandaceO Usually crazy happens due to trauma.
@RealCandaceO @CNN @jaketapper @VanJones68 @realDonaldTrump Maybe switch networks...since the FCC raided CNN.
@RealCandaceO No, I don't think I agree with you on this one. Where does the expression line start and end? Is the shirt tasteless?Yes IMO, but I don't classify myself as a snowflake who takes things personally either. I just think this is a slippery slope to tread on.
@FLOTUS @POTUS @WhiteHouse I hope you are feeling better. I was getting a little worried when we hadn't seen you in the media.
@slpage63 @larriemoss @kevquinnvoice @iam_novacaine @FBIRecordsVault @FedupWithSwamp @POTUS https://t.co/2V8Po3qnjM
@iam_novacaine @FBIRecordsVault @FedupWithSwamp https://t.co/2V8Po3qnjM
@Cmwkrn @Bewitched9 We actually know originally he was listed as a defendant first like 8years ago. Now we know he is listed as a witness.
@Bewitched9 @FBIRecordsVault Maybe doing a little homework first before jumping the gun.https://t.co/2V8Po3qnjM
@Bewitched9 @Cmwkrn So were the Clintons.
@kilmeade @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsradio Where is the link?
@cody_washburn @Barnes_Law @KurtSchlichter Actually ,one other person was named as defendant.
@stephanbugaj @Barnes_Law What are you going to do when you find out Facebook, Twitter, Google, are part of the government?
@gerrigarrick @Barnes_Law It is called shadow banning. Most people don't know that twit has blocked them.
@PolitixGal @Barnes_Law @KurtSchlichter @jack @Twitter Yes, I agree no one is above the law.
@KellyScaletta @takabrawn @Barnes_Law You said fake authoritarian? He is the commander-in-chief.He has the authority in the executive branch.
@dave_quist @UninformedGuy @MorgandyLives @Barnes_Law @POTUS It also infringes on the plaintiffs right to be heard. And she only half won.  Yet, still President Trump congratulated her.
@ncsujen @csualum1994 @canadianpie1 @rpbp @elueroy Except it is a public forum free speech, no more blocking. Yay!First amendment. Twitter is going down for shadow banning accounts.
@rpbp Actually, In part you won.
@RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump My cats and dogs are offended.  They are nothing like MS-13.President Trump should have called them psychopaths.
@realDonaldTrump Please stop legislating my body. It should be considered as my property until a baby is born. Indiana's case vs Patel is q slippery slope. Just as my hair or skin cells is mine until I shed them. Possesion is 9/10 th of the law.
@cali873 @Jenl2025 @VP Asking her what if questions...is not doing her job. Asking direct questions relating to the scope of the new job is and so is her knowledge of the rule of law.The what if questions were asked only when Gina gave an acceptable answer.
@marcelotienoJ @CNN She left our soldiers behind at bengazi. She funneled money into the Clinton foundation for Haiti for relief but built 1 house. Research for yourself.
@eireflute @CNN @AprilDRyan She looks stoned.
@TheGreyWolf1776 @CNN She won't be in a state prison. Gitmo, most likely.
@kingfish1377 @CNN Child sex trafficking, money laundering, and treason are among her crimes for which she will be indicted for, She is gonna need a good lawyer.
@bladek_joan @CNN Both obtained illegally.
@madmarNH @stacyjostacyjo @SenFeinstein Except they did find insurance files...
@PapaCarlyle @EvelynA94591769 @GodsLoveHeals1 @SenFeinstein The Clinton foundation and Haiti. Research for yourself.
@MissMia_1996 Hey I may or may not be a new age freak, but I am against corruption, for equality, for equal rights, privacy, and against the swamp. We can discuss things like adults.
@julie_gower2 @realDonaldTrump @JohnBrennan Except that he lied(Brennan), and gave up the name of the informant.
@John_Barnitt @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks aren't the problem. I have never killed anyone with a gun. Nor a hammer.
@RBReich I am offended that you choose to smear my great uncle, James Buchanan. He was the first gay President. He was far from being a bigot.
@joshtpm So stormy Daniels is lying when she said that there was no affair?
@rredrrocket @realDonaldTrump How many lies can you spew in one minute?How hateful without proof?
@BrianJasonEvans @realDonaldTrump @nytimes https://t.co/Ia2HJyyB1t
@kplusfan @misterbumface @DawnENelson1 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes https://t.co/Ia2HJyyB1t
@AronesSaxet @realDonaldTrump Why are you preaching hate?
@Daakusutepsu @realDonaldTrump So So angry...Why?Because your choice lost?
@MonicaKitten53 @realDonaldTrump So angry!Why were you taking kickbacks?
@EdwardTHardy Actually he was talking about gangs.
@maroni1988 @realDonaldTrump Actually,read the documents. I did.
@RogerTh57577670 @washingtonpost College deferments 4F are legal and acceptable. Draft dodger means he was drafted and ran to Canada or Mexico neither of which he did.
@Xena80547255 @realDonaldTrump @CortesSteve @BarackObama That is not nice. If you can't say anything nice...I know you were taught this in kindergarten.
@ZJemptv You know, I didn't vote for Trump,but I will next time. Name calling is bad form. My parents taught me to respect everyone.
@VABVOX Good.
@ColorOfChange @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Umm ,you should actually look up What he said.
@Hlf_Grd_Krshr I would like to see due process before deportation,then bus them back.
@Microsingular I do not pray as you do,but I stand beside you as you pray.
@KraftBrand You know what I would like to see in a commercial.Sorry,we didn't know we were poisoning you and your https://t.co/cdSf8xRKvY all our products are organic with zero price increase because we believe in feeding our family the best so you can feed your family the best.
@danielspsych @WhiteHouse @POTUS You mean getting rid of the swamp creatures who are corrupt,right?
@MikeyPullman @WhiteHouse Actually, I can read and I vote.
@mahoneypaul1 @WhiteHouse @usatodayopinion Well that is the pot calling the kettle black if I ever heard. I have bullied no one. I have not name called any one. I just disagree with your position.
@roseann_cannon @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP For someone who doesn't like labels and is presuming to know me,You sure are labeling.Actions always speak louder than words.
@thearchieagency That's because it was most likely a joke blown out of proportion.
@Abdalazizawill Maybe Israel wouldn't have shot or injured anyone if they weren't throwing fireballs at armed personnel. I'm just saying.
@ashirsch @npfandos @maggieNYT Neither was Obama.
@SecretlyPrivate @thegraceharding @npfandos @maggieNYT You really like to label people,don't you?
@TheDailyShow When commenting about a length of hospital,you should probably get your facts straight(2-3days) and respect that there are hippa laws in place that protect a patient's privacy.
@cher Will you apologize when he does it?
@prosprw @peplamb Actually, I have died twice and have come back. God,Source,a greater power whatever you want to call it is real.I have seen them, but they are us.
@realDonaldTrump Get well soon Melania.
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr I am glad you are there cleaning out the corruption. I think you are doing a great job.Sorry, I didn't vote for you. I will next time.
@ChildOfStardust @qanon76 Except for the fact that Trump dismantled Nasa's geoengineering program.
@realDonaldTrump I won't buy Chinese products ever since lead and mercury was found in my daughters' children's makeup kit. We can do better than thisIn order for me to buy a Chinese product, I want assurances that we tested them at the epa dea and cdc.
@JodiBradley16 @realDonaldTrump Can't you see the end of your nose ,can you?
@Arslan_Sadiq @realDonaldTrump If you mean spreading terrorism by decentralizing their base of operations, then yes, but if you mean he is indirectly or directly for terrorism...NO!
@sunshine2cats @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump And he(Obama) paid 1.8 b dollars to do it. Trump paid nothing.
@BermudaLove65 @ErwrightWright @Rockprincess818 @realDonaldTrump God hates no one.He doesn't pick sides.
@COFightsBack @realDonaldTrump That is not https://t.co/cyDRdzT7cx need to go meditate.
