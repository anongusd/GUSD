@juniebacabo @sosayu3 @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro I think the world would be better off if we stopped treating sex as flippantly and carelessly as we do and started treating human life as the miracle that it is, but yeah sure go ahead and mute me.
@sosayu3 @juniebacabo @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Yes, it is, and the healthy and natural consequence of sex is a child.
@juniebacabo @sosayu3 @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Uh.... rape is against the law
@sosayu3 @juniebacabo @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro I do make it easier; I remain celibate until I am in the confines of a loving relationship. It really isn't that hard to do.
@sosayu3 @juniebacabo @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Yeah, you don't have all of the responsibility if you choose a partner that you trust to be there when you need him. Sometimes, it doesn't work out that way. But innocent human life doesn't deserve to die because living beings think he or she would be better off not being born.
@AmberAudio @Blackhawk442 @emiruffdc @JessicaValenti So, between 20-24 weeks, then? Because most babies born prematurely between those ranges are capable of surviving.
@sosayu3 @juniebacabo @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Nobody is saying that they shouldn't. What I am saying is that, to avoid pregnancy, it is very possible for women to refuse to have sex with men without a condom on if they are not already on the pill or something similar.
@sosayu3 @juniebacabo @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Why can't you just ask your partner for help paying for birth control? Men can take responsibility if you demand it of them.
@CampbellCinema @emiruffdc @JessicaValenti None of those things have value like life has value. Your own life is not more valuable because of the circumstances of your birth, or circumstances predating your birth. Life has value beyond an education or a degree for one who is already here.
@AutisticMadeArt @rehemaneema @Kevin13263461 @MonicaBisha @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Or provide emotional and material support while his partner deals with the physical tolls of bringing another miracle into the world.
@CampbellCinema @emiruffdc @JessicaValenti I mean, you 100% aren't being born if any one of 40,000 different sperm cells fertilizes your mother's egg, either. Your existence is a statistical miracle -- a truly unique combination of humanity with a special value -- and so was the existence of the child your mother aborted.
@AmberAudio @emiruffdc @JessicaValenti So you need a personality to be a person? I am confused as to what exactly your line is between personhood and genetic material that can be disposed of on a whim.

@AmberAudio @emiruffdc @JessicaValenti So cognitive function determines human worth? Fascinating, tell me more.
@emiruffdc @JessicaValenti The only thing I advocate is that we choose to recognize human life as human life. I wouldn't vote for a ban myself, but I do want you to understand that not everybody in your story lived happily ever after. A human life was sacrificed in that story.
@_ablebakercindy @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Or you could just... choose not to have sex with them without a condom on. Or even better -- choose not to have sex with the ones who aren't responsible enough to be a father.
@juniebacabo @Kevin13263461 @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro No, it wouldn't. A vasectomy isn't like a pill you can just stop taking. It is a very complicated and decently costly procedure to undo once it is done. And most men, like most women, do eventually want to raise a family in their lives.
@rehemaneema @Kevin13263461 @MonicaBisha @SamDaMan723 @benshapiro Well she chose to have sex with her body, didn't she? And for the record, so did he! That child has both of their genetic information, and raising that child is both of their responsibilities.

@CathyYoung63 Your last two points are things I have also criticized Trump for so I won't quibble on those. But does the author of the op ed mention unsavory takes he has had in this context? If not, then your tweet appears to me like little more than red meat for Trump haters (no disrespect)
@CathyYoung63 Okay fair, but the key word is "exaggerated," right? I haven't read the op ed itself because paywall, but you can water down "narcissistic egomaniacal bully" to "assertive and self-assured" to describe the average American, for instance.
I don't understand the problem with this subhead. Is calling Americans "blunt, simple, willing to fight, and mistrustful of intellectuals" a bad thing or something? https://t.co/0AWAik6Onx

@WandaSpeaks67 @LisaSartin Here is a list of some of the PACs that lobby Washington and donate to politicians. I am willing to bet that there are some causes that you like among this list. Not all PACs are created equal. https://t.co/p7bcOnkEIm
@WandaSpeaks67 @LisaSartin They literally met one time. Once. Uno. When the president-elect from your party calls you to an interview, you take the interview. How is that a violation of principle? Just because he has been critical of the president doesn't mean he's lost the desire to serve his country.
@WandaSpeaks67 @LisaSartin Groveling for a job is definitely not how I would describe the one meeting that Trump had with Romney. Running your own PAC for your own causes is different than having a party/corporate machine finance you. Neither of these contradicts principles.

@5280_native Pharmacists aren't doctors. Glad your wife is okay, but that doesn't change the fact that people have the right to not sell what they don't want to sell. The consequences of that can be negative, admittedly, but it doesn't mean that it is not their right.
