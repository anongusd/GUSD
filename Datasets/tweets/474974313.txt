At the Capitol later that day, Mike Bishop said something that's stuck with me as practices started this year: the field was a safe space. You're up at the crack of dawn playing baseball (or softball) -- you don't think anything bad is going to happen, but that changed last year.
I got to the field as members were getting on buses to the Capitol. Rep. Palmer said they should've realized they would be a target. So the rest of the day was spent trying to figure out why police weren't regularly at these practices	https://t.co/6bw56diQi3
