Leaders have to spend most time to bann and rebuke some of the groups which spreads worst culture that can be copied by some youth in other countries and then ruin them.Moral of social media should be noted,most youth have been ruined by social medias.
To encourage what was left by former leaders is together with actions, undermine tribalism, religionism, poor tradition and establish strong foundation for education because education diminish ignorance.Unity is strengthness and separating is weakness. https://t.co/3dG7lbc9W1
I remember wisdom and love of our former leaders between our countries,back in the days Africa and USA had a good relationship.We should inherit love and bonds left by our leaders.White people and black people are equal in God's creation. https://t.co/X57NHWl1ng

Kupeana kazi kwasababu ni ndugu au kupitia rushwa hii imepelekea kutokea majanga mengi hapa duniani, mtoto wa tajiri au kiongozi akimchukua mwanafunzi mwenzake shuleni kufanya naye ngono walimu wanakaa  kimya kwasababu kuna chochote wanapata kutoka kwa huyo mtoto wa tajiri.
Kuna mataifa mengi yanalia hapa duniani kwa matukio mbalimbali yanayotokea kama ajali za magari,vifo vya uzembe wa madaktari,mimba mashuleni kwa ajili ya uzembe wa walimu,maghorofa kuanguka kwa ajili ya uzembe wa mainjinia haya yote tahadhari hawakuwa nayo.
Angalizo liwepo katika kupeana madaraka ya kikazi madereva watoto, walimu watoto,madaktari watoto,mainjinia watoto,manahodha watoto,marubani watoto hizi ni kazi ambazo zinahitaji historia ya mtu,umri wake na vipindi alivyopitia siku za nyuma.
@juliuslegend 	Kupata elimu ni kufahamu baadhi ya mambo yalioandikwa lakini kuna elimu nyingine ya matendo halisia,ukiwa na hofu utaogopa kufanya matendo mabaya maana ulishaona uhalisia wake na sio kwenye kusoma.Utu uzima ni pamoja na kupata elimu na kuona katika uhalisia
@CarolNdosi	Watoto watafanya ya kitoto ukiwa mtu mzima utafanya ya kiutu uzima ukiwa kijana utafanya ya vijana,msichana mwenye umri wa miaka 25 anatakiwa kufundishwa na mwalimu wa miaka 45 mpaka 50,hapo kutakuwepo na aibu ya kufanya matendo mabaya.
Hekima ya mtu hailetwi na elimu pia heshima ya mtu hailetwi na elimu wakati unatafuta elimu mwili nao unadai haki yake hisia na macho yanadai pia haki yake,unawezaje kuupinga mwili wako kutumia elimu.Walimu watoto au walimu vijana hawatakiwi kuwe na mipaka.Thanks cc @CarolNdosi
@CarolNdosi @phelickmsemwa and @JuliusLegend  Mwanadamu huwa anapitia vipindi vingi katika maisha yake kuna kipindi cha moto kipindi cha vuguvugu na baridi kabisa kwahiyo hekima ya mtu mzima haitakaa ifutike kila mtu ataipitia.Asanteni na mbarikiwe
@CarolNdosi Kwa upande wangu naona kuondoa hili tatizo ni pamoja na kuwaondoa walimu watoto mashuleni na kuweka walimu watu wazima wenye hekima zao na kushirikisha wazazi nyumba kwa nyumba kuwa na maadili mazuri ya malezi kwa watoto.
Africa	Every war in some African countries is not for fighting for right If you deeply investigate you will find there are interests of minority or plans of certain interests,there is no any reason to kill innocent people since people are resources of a country.God bless Africa
Amongest mistakes which are done in some countries based on tribalism ideology, religion ideology,race and sexual discrimination this situations has led some countries in to war.We are all supposed to be one,such acts should be condemned.
Instead of getting your country in to war it is better to stay aside from power if you real love your nation and that is patriotism because you can't find peace easily since it disappear.We should respect peace God gave us.
Message to various leaders, as a leader you must evaluate yourself that by the moment you get in power you found some steps of developments what have you added? or you just consume/spend the work of your predecessor.
Forgiveness for the interest of majority is a best thing, leaders must be kind,loyal and be open to forgive also they should learn to apologise and that is quality leadership.	God also enjoy such humbled people.
Value of a person is himself, that lifestyle you live can upgrade or downgrade your value so you must evaluate yourself by looking how many friends and enemies have increased in your list.The value of the country is a one with big number of good friends.

Any nation which valued agriculture and agriculturalists and which avoided political disputes and which advance its primary industries that nation must become rich.Therefore this is why we need leaders in the nation
Land is for agriculture but agriculture should be operated by agriculture experts not in class but practicing it for real.The government is responsible to take experts in rural areas,we will advance the quality of agriculture.
AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA.	It has remained to old people with no food ended in drinking local alcohol then finally it is no longer fine agriculture.If you go to rurals you will feel sympathy to women who suffer from poor farming with their kids https://t.co/wykEFv1zBi
When we always talk bout politics we forget there are people in the rural take single meal a day,their opportunities to be employed or self employed has been blocked and they have been forgotten if they exist.Their existence is active only during election. https://t.co/xCbBeutk9s
As long as there is increase of pets that are eaten like dog,snake,mouse and donkey.Government,health and food authority stakeholders should edacute the public about the effects and if is there legitimacy of eating those pets?
I would like to know about relationship between a human being and a dog in cooperating in terms of food.For instance pregnant women who stays arround with animals what will a born kid inherit through the air? when a kid is in womb always inherits what the mother likes.
The public should be hand in hand to give cooperation to security forces towards arising scenes in the community such as rape, cruelty to women and men,abortion and abandon of children also government and spiritual leaders should interfere this.

When want a nation to have honest leaders we must have build a clear background to childrens on the fear of God.A poor leader today is due to  poor background in the past.Lets sorround ourself with our kids in order to build their strong foundation.
There are some stuffs need to be put clear to those who are responsible for ruling that there are some stuff that seems to be ignored and underrated,these stuffs have been causing loss and have arisen unnecessary cost in our countries therefore we need to be aware.
We have to learn to pray for our leaders also we have to learn to pray for our nations,our borders and army forces.Tommorow is Sunday everyone go give offering for your nation.God bless you all my friends

I would like give kudos to Trump also to his assistants who advised him to leave the arrested https://t.co/Rf0pivJlAi you have showed a good example of a father,our hopes is you to perform the best not the worst.Thanks God bless you
When Press freedom will underperform its role will lead to massive corruption,silence evil scenes and poor management in various institutions also the general public will miss the basic rights then press freedom should be defended and secured by all people.
Government is a house full of people and those people are various institutions within that government,not every decision can be made by the president and each institution is statutory accountable	Whoever is employed knows his/her responsibilities so interference is not required

To every protest there should be security to avoid violence or any crime but I would like to say outdated laws which lead to protest should be eliminated and form new which care equality and dignity of human. https://t.co/AU9uVJ20jc
We should direct our efforts to sensitive issues such as; hospitals, unemployed youth, calamities,take measure on technology advancement which destroy our societies,deal with selfish leaders and defend rights of widows of soldiers died in peacekeeping tasks.
Separating mother and child is not good to God,this is seeking for God's anger.We know the love of mother to a child also we know the love of a father to a child.Laws which allows this should be made amendment immeadiately.
Message to USA goes to leaders who have responsibility of the country.	I have been appreciating politics and decisions of USA leaders but   whoever performs better must also perform bad.USA is the great country in the world which I believe have enough critical thinking capacity.
@Kennyclavius Thanks May God bless you ,it is nice that we have similar view on this
During this time we live,we have to pray a lot because moral of human has eroded,no love at all and peoples have become after money also politicians disturb democracy.Democracy is the gateway of rights and equality and should be respected.
Aids which are given to orphans, widow and poor societies do not reach the targeted group as it's intended rather this peoples has become source of income to some people.We would like donors to make follow up if those aids reach the intended group.
I request all Governments should give support to businesses moreover they should do research to discover new talents of rising business.Businessman between one nation and the other should cooperate each other to create mutual relationship in terms of business.

People should respect each other disrespect,annoyance and self pride all this is acts of devil,we people should change and get back to Almighty God
To all people there who forget God and allow satan to dominate their life still there is a chance of going back to God,once you believe your life can change immediately or your nation can change immediately because leadership without Almighty is dangerous. https://t.co/rAXof1F60v
At the moment you were asking vote for leadership opportunity you were very humble then when you were elected you have forgotten problems of the citizens,I remind you If you are a leader what you promised to your people.
Love is great pillar to the life of human in the world but love is God himself,this is the time every society, citizens and nations unite together to pray for the world,we are nearing to ending moment of the world as written in holy books of God.
Every leaders of nations should believe in true God who create the entire world because worst politics has caused to destroy respect to some nations,poor leadership is massively in track currently and people have escaped God.
Effects of barriers does not only cause a country to miss income but also cause economical suffer and close business opportunity to citizens,understanding is only which can be solution to barriers and tarrifs.

Promise which is promised should be fulfilled,If you put promise with God you should fulfill it same to satan,Once you won't fulfill these promises there are so many effects in our lives.Lets be careful with our pre decisions
Problems which face the world currently is due to revengeful spirit within people, people to be after money than humanity, people to compete with globalization and people leave the real God to worship other gods.
Problems which face the globe currently the source is parents forgot to train their kids on education to love God therefore kids have grown up in poor moral and are those who disturb the world,due to lack of technology education has also caused moral erosion.
I greet you my lovely friend who follow me by doing so God bless you also I give thanks to all governmental leaders who follow me without judging my status.Twitter is half seeing each other,let's cooperate each other by love.
