Surely decreasing your molecular resolution would cause irreversible damage, but to alter the fundamental laws of physics seems quite extreme.
If an individual were to shrink, such as Ant-Man from the hit Marvel comic and movie series, would you be shrinking the size of atoms themselves or decreasing your "molecular resolution?"

So much information is carried in waves you cannot perceive. The physical realm only acts as a receptor for them. For now.

I have reason to believe my roommate is likely a hologram. I have never actually made physical contact with him, nay not even for a handshake- how peculiar.
@yunginternetgrl I can see that many similar traits have been passed down to you and you have become quite a high quality human yourself. I wish your grandma, you, and your loved ones with a healthy life filled with love, happiness, and success. Much love
@yunginternetgrl Greetings my good friend Dr. Kate, I hope your grandma is doing well and recovering swiftly. She seems like a remarkably resilient and strong human being with much love for those around her. Her pursuit for knowledge is a beautiful thing and she likely benched 540 lbs.
@yunginternetgrl That is truly so kind of you to propose :'), I don't know what to say except I love you and hope you have a blissful life filled with happiness and support. The trip will require us to dematerialize into photons, potentially unable to revert to physical form. Is that ok with you?
