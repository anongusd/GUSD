@The_Java_DEV @AniketSMK Not precisely. 		Post hoc ergo propter hoc. 		NASA lost the orbiter *because* of the root cause(s) of the error. Using diff time units was symptom. Design, review and testing errors were made. The processes in place failed to lead humans to catch them.
Whether CNN loses on Tuesday or not, IMO they should announce Wed they're refocusing their new "single issue" format away from politics. Flint water gets the spotlight, advocacy, and shame until all problems solved and all culpable charged. Celeb coordinator @MMFlint
@benedictevans I believe people have internal scorecards for assessing things. IMO, experts' scorecards should be written. My scorecard deducts points from an analysis that contains hyperbole words (always, never, etc), confuses feature, benefit &amp; offering, and doesn't address that "it" changes
It's remarkable how the evil folks in House of Cards S6 who are dedicated to take down POTUS "for the good of the country" sound so much like the resistance folks on twitter.

@rhianna You asked me about my position that if the govt can suspend/prevent a legal activity then it's not actually an inalienable right, it's only a privilege. 		Is driving a car in the USA a right or a privilege?
@rhianna What you're describing is how the system works. After the felony is no longer serving time, on parole or on probation, they may register to vote. 	People made that determination, which is what makes voting a privilege, not an inalienable right (in this country).
@rhianna Believe me, "feeling sorry" for anyone doesn't factor into the equation (for me) at all. 	One last thought. 	If you exercise the power to suspend or end one Inalienable right for a person, you claim the power over all inalienable rights for all people subject to your conditions.
@rhianna Rights, conferred automatically as a consequence of being human, are not subject to any human's discretion. That's the big conceptual leap that freed the non-royals from the royals.  Humans still have plenty of instruments at their disposal. Inalienable rights are off limits.
@rhianna Govt derives its power from the consent of the governed. Not the portion of the governed that it selects. 	You (and I admit the vast majority of people) want to use voting as an additional instrument of punishment.
@RadioFreeTom Even selecting which folks to show is editing. 	Finding undereducated people is valuable? Maybe in a story about the quality of the education system.	So HBO paid someone to do an episode of "Jay Walking" to promote an agenda and tell a story to make some folks feel superior. #smh

@jack #wellPut @Jack, except the word "our" is not needed. A service constructed (bounded) by any personal views is not worthy of the public square. A private service? Sure. That's a different box of pickles.

@NickFalacci Come to think of it .. why limit the Amendment to just SCOTUS nominations?  Federal bench is important. 		Which brings us to a very interesting deal (albeit completely rhetorical) ...
@NickFalacci Also, what would have to be an Amendment, has to answer the question, "Who does nominate for SCOTUS if POTUS ineligible?"  Which is okay. It could be left to a majority house vote for/against who ever the speaker of the house proposes.
@NickFalacci "fed investigations" would been judicial review at least on the back end. i.e. when they are over. Else starting a 4 year fed investigation freezes out your next POTUS too. That makes too many stars to align to ever get someone on the big bench.
@NickFalacci That's not a bad notion, but needs a little polish, imo. 		e.g. everything after "for colluding.. " is too specific. 		e.g. "under fed investigation" is too general. Those come pretty cheap, from any committee from either leg. body.

But that's okay. It would be a mistake to think traditional investing players will be needed to topple FB. They aren't. 	No second bite of the apple, because it's an orange. Still plenty of action elsewhere.
But that just means they will miss this ride. For some investors missing second ride really means they were lucky the first time. For others it means they just don't know good from bad until everyone else shows them.
Two most important things FB has going for it - VCs still mistakenly believe FB is too big to topple AND most VCs have smoked so much blockchain recently they can't see straight

@bryanrbeal So "big co" gets caught standing still w/ (ex:) mortgage sw that can "originate," "sell," "foreclose" a home loan, but not "refinance" #fail
@bryanrbeal Even though, really, really, you me and 1/2 dozen experienced friends could build it for &lt; $1MM. And it would cost 1/10 to operate it...
@bryanrbeal So what's a Kroger to do? If they sent RFPs to the big shops, not one would touch the project for under $10MM, no chance.
@bryanrbeal ..innovative projects chasing new business models and new customers come -- even in the name of defending market share.
@bryanrbeal Sure Kroger (et al) probably still has its own data center, mostly running software from wherever, but that's not a base from which..
@bryanrbeal Trouble is it takes real wisdom and courage to know when to apply it! Trading off tomorrow for today can "look so good on paper"
@bryanrbeal prime example of how humanity's childlike relationship with time itself hurts us over and over. Tortoise and Hare isn't just a kid's story
@bryanrbeal ("I don't mean to get off on a rant.." - Dennis Miller) 	But "outsourcing" was not only a huge disabler for many corps, but also it was..
@bryanrbeal ..tomorrow opportunity. 	What a shame. 	#pennyWisePoundFoolish
@bryanrbeal But then the 90's came and some MBA innovation killer convinced big corps that outsourcing skills saved more today money .. while ignoring
@bryanrbeal Another challenge is software. In the 80's Kroger probably had its own developers who could've been the base from which to grow new ventures
@bryanrbeal One challenge is space to operate, but for many, many grocery store locations, lotsa room available in same corner mall.
