Stop those plays before they happen #BeatWVU
Can we start really winning this game? I'm sick of worrying about the next play.
RT @OUnation: If our calculations are right Hunnicutt has just tied @DeMarcoMurray for all time scoring at #OU! #BOOMER #fb
RT @CodySirk: Perine is a tank. Takes almost the whole Virginia D-line to take him down. 	#truefreshman #OUvsWVU
RT @OUnation: How many WVU players does it take to tackle Perine
RT @OUnation: Dear Josh Heupel please let Trevor Knight run the ball.
My universe is back in balance - the #Sooners are in the lead!
RT @OUnation: Going into the game we knew they would throw on us.  We need Sanchez and the D to step that game up.  We will win this if we ‚Ä¶

RT @logan_stalcup: Dumb penalties are dumb. But kickoff returns for a touchdown are not!!
Touchdown!!! #SOONERFOOTBALL #gainthelead
RT @OhKayKayKay42: ........WHAT? Come. on. Ref. http://t.co/glMlUHuiUy
RT @CodySirk: Damn it all. Come on Sooners! You have a 1:20 till halftime! You need to pull it together!
A half dozen flags + rocky defense = unranked teams scoring too much
RT @OUnation: Not sure about this new head ref...
Stop this drive and stop this stress, Sooners
RT @OUnation: OU kicked it short but WVU got it. WVU's ball.  OU should have had that inside kick.
RT @CodySirk: That was totally West Virginia causing that fight! That player took Williams's helmet off and swung him to the ground!	#bull
RT @GabeIkard: Have to call the extra ref out of the bullpen. Hopefully he's been doing his calisthenics.
This game is giving me a headache
RT @OUnation: Retweet if Josh Heupel just surprised you with that play call! #Boomer
RT @OU_Football: Trickery! TD Sooners. Knight with the TD CATCH. Durron Neal with the TD pass. Tied 10-10 in Morgantown with 8:58 left in 1‚Ä¶
THANK YOU #Sooners @SoonerFootball #InBobWeTrust
RT @joshstickney: Let's stick to our bread and butter, Sooners. #RunDaBall

Shoutout to the idiot who rode his longboard into my bike today! Now I'm in pain, my favorite sweatshirt is torn, and my bike is broken.
@Walmart has lost all my respect. Botched my transfer, fired me for missing days after I moved for college, and I don't hear for a week.
RT @OUnation: Happy Birthday @OU_CoachStoops #Boomer
