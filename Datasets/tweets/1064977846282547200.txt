@Everytown There weren't background checks prior to the 1960s and mass shootings were virtually unheard of.		Again: we would do far better as a nation acknowledging the social upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s is far more responsible for the social decay we see today than inanimate objects.
@Everytown @RepJayapal By "update background checks", what-say-you about IL proposing to use social media as a form of 'check'?		Red Flag Laws can already be used absent due process and criminal conviction, so the Death Star is curious just how far Individual Rights are going to be suffocated.
@WaGunResponsib Make domestic violence convictions a capital offense?
Going to reiterate a point made in one of his earlier videos: creating own characters instead of co-opting goes much, much further.  (E.g. Miles Morales instead of just POC Peter Parker.)		Aside from being lazy, it as - as he says here - tokenism.		https://t.co/IlWKxQHzvk
@MomsDemand @Everytown ...increasing restrictions on anything, I would hope, would decrease the number of individuals able to acquire anything, no?		Isn't the question why should US citizens undergo rigorous background checks to exercise an individual right?
@Everytown Shouldn't being able to exercise an individual right without a background check be celebrated?		The Death Star is of the belief, for instance, that a great number of US citizens whose debt to society has been repaid via incarceration should having voting rights restored.
And should be "afforded".		The Death Star: in need of an editor since at least 2001.  (Some Followers might remember Live Journal.)

@BFriedmanDC At least we can agree DHS - ATF, IRS, and TSA - all need to be abolished.
@GunReformRyan @NRA @OklahomaBway Because the firearms laws in the US have only become more strict since the 1930s - with the 1960s and 1990s being two major increases as well - with the results growing worse.		Likely isn't the inanimate objects and is the People (already referenced the Cultural Rev. in the US)..
@GunReformRyan @NRA @OklahomaBway Or do you mean post-1960 US society that has undergone massive social upheaval resulting in a failed culture and reduction of Individual Rights?
@GunReformRyan @NRA @OklahomaBway By "right side of history" do you mean the ~100 years firearms have been commercially available to the public and remained largely unchained or everything before the 1960s when there weren't background checks and mass shootings were unheard of?

@shannonrwatts Firearms are inanimate objects.		Why would anyone voluntarily sign-up for the path to Skynet?
@shannonrwatts Translation: the State is going to force its way into your Home via your Children.		This is straight "1984".
@WaGunResponsib Pray-tell: why is it mass shootings have become more common as the gun laws have become stricter?		Is it the inanimate object which has remained virtually unchanged for ~100 years or the society which has undergone massive upheaval since the 1960s?
@lauraladida @MomsDemand @Everytown Again: the US is far more ethnically diverse and populous than "other high income nations".		But don't let wealth stop your tyranny.
@Everytown How do you reconcile violating 4A protections for citizens to purchase a firearm but asking citizenship status for a national census is 'too intrusive'?
So let the Death Star get this straight: it isn't terminating the 40-week old "fetus" that got everyone riled up - being argued for present day - but...		...doing 'black face' decades ago?		@SenateDems	@HouseDemocrats		https://t.co/AtNDrTBfus

@lil_brown_bat @shannonrwatts @voguemagazine The point?		Again: the technology is far from new and the culture is far more restrained.		So I am asking: how do the Masses come off asserting nonsense to the point of stripping Individual Rights?
@GunReformRyan You understand the firearm technology has remained largely unchanged for a century and that since the 1930s and 1960s the only things that have happened are:		- stricter firearms laws	- massive cultural changes		Accept failure.
@shannonrwatts @voguemagazine The argument makes zero logical sense.

Maybe the cultural revolution since the 1960s is the failure and not the inanimate objects?		Just spitballing.
@krassenstein Once again: @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor: if allowed, the Death Star would personally execute Mr. Jackson to demonstrate what a competent and strong state looks like.
@Well_Regulated_ So do you want to talk about how the US operated just fine with opium dens and how SWAT was introduced as an answer to hostage situations in the 1970s or blame inanimate objects?		Again: the Death Star wants to Lawmakers, not Law Enforcers.		Let's talk failed policies.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Acknowledged.  View the Death Star as a continuation of that discussion.		Which: the Death Star argues using the processes already codified is far more preferable to using the judiciary and legislatures to bypass.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ The Death Star argues human behavior is difficult to regulate, but removing options such as corporal and capital punishment is the wrong direction.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Automatic and semiautomatic weapons absolutely were available to the US public ~100 years ago; arguably with greater ease to acquire.		The method - magazine - to expel the ammunition in large quantity has also been - again - commerically available for appx. the same period.
The Death Star just interacted with a Vietnamese emigrant ~1975.		Same as when the Death Star worked with a Vietnamese emigrant ~1970s earlier in life.		The Marxists in the US are chomping to line their own people against a wall.		Surrender nothing.		@SpeakerPelosi 	@AOC
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Why?  Why, after a century of access to said weapons commercially, is it now a problem?		Our society underwent a massive upheaval far more recently than firearms have changed.		Why not regulate society?
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Iraq had a very efficient central government prior to the US invasion under the Bush administration.

@Crackpotkin @Desolate_Dude @mmMMMmmChase We can agree to the extent those at the top of the System not being held to account is a core problem in the US.		"Too big to fail" is an utter disgrace to anyone claiming to be a free marketeer.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Locking a toddler alone for days strikes the Death Star as radically dissimilar from the negligent discharge of a firearm in youthful indiscretion.		The Death Star is not arguing children as property, which is what locking someone in a closest seems to be.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ ...being "grounded" for a period of time.		So again: why is it 'necessary' to involve the Almighty State where private individuals can reach a preferred outcome?
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ She was injured, likely traumatized, and it was not intentional to the degree my intent was not to hit her.  (Simply being stupid and wanting to scare, I shot from the hip at a decent range ~50 yards.)		Our parents reached a mutually agreeable outcome and my punishment was...
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ "And that loss of child should be enough."		I mean: is it not?  Why is a Victim or deceased body not enough?
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ We have a motto here: "Empire Abroad, Republic at Home".		Being able to reason with people of the same culture should not be difficult and yet, here we are.
@geronimo_phil @thehill Good to know.  So do only Brown (and Red) Latinos get to keep Culture?		As an aside: on my maternal side, my grandfather was indigenous so like myself you understand: the original Mexicans didn't speak Spanish.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ You write that based on the premise the Death Star supports those regulations...
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Why?  Why should *you* be held responsible for the wanton disregard of others, by others?
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ I am simply interested, where there is a Victim and clear 'life learning curve' (adolescence), in what the Almighty State provides in these instances?
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Why?  Having grown up around loaded and unsecured firearms, none of them simply 'jumped out' and shot either myself or my friends.		I did once shoot a girl with a BB gun in junior high doing 'stupid kid stuff', but is there being a Victim not enough for you?
@geronimo_phil @thehill Ah: good-thing I am an ethnic minority.  (Latino)		Which is not mutually-exclusive from being "White", leaving me to wonder: are only dark Latinos allowed to retain culture and who the racist here is, exactly?		My view doesn't change on race.  Y tu?
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ ...dictate how arms are stored in the soverignty of one's own dwelling.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Neither the individual right to arms nor the arms themselves are new.  Same with the mixture of children and unsecured firearms.		The Death Star refuses to believe the only way to go about this is to  strip the populace of the individual right to arms or otherwise...
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ Why is the firearm owner in herently the irresponsible party?  Although one-in-the-same for this story, why are these never portrayed as 'parents failed to instill discipline into children'?		These objects have been commerically available for centuries.
@NPR Islamists in the Philippines?  No.  Way. - Moro of 1899
@Desolate_Dude @Crackpotkin @mmMMMmmChase The US economy is absolutely *not* the inevitable result.		The current US economy is the result of people who claim to be capitalists having zero inkling Smith wrote of morality before finance and being too scared to let the market wash away its losers.
@Desolate_Dude @Crackpotkin @mmMMMmmChase This isn't "private" health care by any stretch of the imagination, just like university tuition.		By-and-large, most of these outfits should have been crushed by the market long ago.
@Desolate_Dude @Crackpotkin @mmMMMmmChase The current US economy is far from capitalistic and has been for some time.		"Too big to fail" is nothing Smith's free market knows of.
@NYCAntifa Good morning, comrade.
@Desolate_Dude @Crackpotkin @mmMMMmmChase And "LOL" the Donald is an authoritarian.		Again: forced into collective health care V border controls.		Very light border controls at that!
@Desolate_Dude @Crackpotkin @mmMMMmmChase Or that Marxism is flawed from the 'jump'?		Why this needs to be demonstrated repeatedly in the real world is something beyond my comprehension.		I just know *a lot* of bodies are left in the aftermarh each time.
@kittensnotkids @Well_Regulated_ What purpose does this story have?		What is the 'take away' the audience supposed to leave with knowing said information?
@ewood02 Fix. Society.		Broken communities and homes, not inanimate objects or individual rights, led to what transpired.
@mmMMMmmChase @Crackpotkin ...because the Death Star suspects if the US Taxpayer could be presented with tangible gains?		Overhauling our health care system would be far more enticing...
@mmMMMmmChase @Crackpotkin "[D]ue to lack of access to healthcare."		...I wonder what a resurrection of the Civilian Conservation Corps coupled with expanded Tricare would look like...
@Crackpotkin @mmMMMmmChase Forcing everyone into a health care collective is far more authoritarian and Marxist than basic border controls.		It is not by accident Mussolini, for instance, was a part of the socialist movement prior to facism.		In the end, Marxism survives only by the end of a weapon.
@geronimo_phil @thehill So do I need to assimilate into the nation I am emigrating to or what?		Because being able to ram my culture down someone else's throat sounds rather appealing.
@geronimo_phil @thehill I don't know?  You going to cheer for me if I emigrate to somewhere outside the US and, while holding down two jobs, refuse to assimilate into the host country?		Better still: you going to call the host country on forcing me to assimilate?
@thehill Why?  Not advocating for a return of physical violence a la the 1940s Zoot Suits, but what *exactly* is wrong with some degree of assimilation into a host culture?
@Well_Regulated_ Pray-tell: aside from their kid with a bullet in his head, what punishment do think should be extracted from the family?		This is interesting, where people seem to think the Almighty State is greater than Nature.

@Dazy_Parade @MomsDemand Amazing how, prior to the 1960s, we didn't.  We didn't have background checks, we didn't have regular mass shootings.		I wonder what changed?		Oh, right: we did have a cultural revolution.
@Dazy_Parade @MomsDemand And "surrender a thing" isn't limited to firearms.		Sovereignty of own home, to include how weapons are store, among them.
@Dazy_Parade @MomsDemand We live in a world where, internationally, child euthenasia is acceptable and domestically New York now allows for abortions up to the due date.		Nobody should surrender a thing because a kid wants to blow his or her brains out.		https://t.co/ibLEt7Ktnp

@shannonrwatts So what punishment do you plan on dishing out to the mother that Nature hasn't already?		Aside from taking other people's Individual Rights, of course.
@peter_masiakos No, because this will be the avenue through which more control and monitoring is utilized.  (Without getting into the 'Skynet' fears.)		Firearms are currently inanimate objects.		Let's keep it that way.
@MomsDemand And yet being asked Citizenship status for a national Census is a no-no?		Prior to the 1960s there were neither background checks nor regular mass shootings.		Fix society, not incresase background checks to exercise a Right.
@Well_Regulated_ @FredOstu @ESpooker6 @NRA Good, because nobody - especially the State - should be telling anyone how to store firearms.		Store your firearms in the manner which works best for you.		This isn't difficult.
@thetimes Of course, @SpeakerPelosi, @AOC, @GovInslee, and many others are pushing to disarm You 'for the Environment'.		The Death Star wagers at least two of these individuals has profitted from Big Pharma, with the third simply not having a chance to...yet.

@WaGunResponsib ...and realizes it.		How you can celebrate diminishing our 2A and 4A guarantees and rights is simply baffling.
@WaGunResponsib There is nothing "commonsense" about destroying the equal partnership of the Individual-State relationship.		Once semiautomatic rifles are surrendered the People will no longer be able to hold the State in check and will only be a matter of time until someone steps into power...
@GovInslee @AGOWA Yeah, no.  Both bills are an egregious attack on the balance between Individual and State.		Once semiautomatic rifles are surrendered?  Any notion of equality and equity in the Individual-State relationship in the US is finished.		#AgainstAllEnemies	#ForeignAndDomestic
@enoughmom1 @fred_guttenberg @MomsDemand @TDOnline Obviously.  For whatever reason, it seems nobody has any interest in actually fixing this society in decay.
@becher_casey You are advocating to diminish two Constitutional Rights - 2A and 4A - and are calling me "garbage"?		As the kids say: 'LOL'.
@Everytown Want to talk culture and demographics or just going to continue to advocate to diminish our Individual Rights?
@becher_casey Same with the other photos you posted: by the groin area.		Why you looking at underage boy's groins?  Husband not giving it to you?
@becher_casey You can see the kid to the left of the player in the background doing it.		Which, he is doing it correctly: by his groin, which is fully-in-line with from when I was a kid.  (Because you must be looking at my groin to see it, hence 'you're gay'.)
@becher_casey Again: neither you nor I has zero idea why the mouth is rounded up and the first conclusion you come to is Minstrel Boy.
@becher_casey Don't know?  There was also the alternative that if you look, 'you're gay'.		I would absolutely hate coming-of-age as a kid in 2019.		We used to play "smear the queer" as well, which would have certainly sent us to the Death Camp of Tolerance today.

@AngryAnok @JohnsmcmV1 @Kherman112 Was he convicted in court or something?
@AngryAnok @JohnsmcmV1 @Kherman112 "Tried" means 'nothing happened'.		Additionally: if I have to fill out an ATF 4186 in order to 'legally' transfer a firearm, I trust that fat white chick had her paperwork to be in the street?
@AngryAnok @JohnsmcmV1 @Kherman112 ...themselves in order to accommodate Islam in the US.
@AngryAnok @JohnsmcmV1 @Kherman112 You do realize I couldn't care less about who the protagonists and antagonists in "Watchmen" are and identify far more with the perceived antagonists, right?

@iamelbaum @MomsDemand Again: if there is 'certification' and 'training' "required" to exercise the Individual Right to Arms?		There must be a Literacy Test to Vote.  And yes: Voting is every not, if not more, dangerous than a Firearm. https://t.co/vk0PuoGQDm
@Acceber_x @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand "In other high income countries."		Once again: US demographics and Total Number dictate it cannot be compared to "other high income countries".		When contextualized - held against nations in S. America and Africa - the US is doing fine.

@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Courts and Judges matter only to a degree.		https://t.co/9RswtwvuPk
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Our government also regulates millions of People, so that is a Wash.		So again: one is an Individual Right, the other is just something that happens in Life.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Better still: one is an Individual Right, explicitly protected in the federal constitution and multiple state constitutions.		The other - a Partner in Life - is nowhere to be found in any charter document I am aware of?
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Makes far more sense than regulating an inanimate object.
@SenateDems @SenAmyKlobuchar Better still: why SHOULD the American Taxpayer desire a government which has not decisively won a major military engagement since 1945?		When you win your wars, everything else follows.
@SenateDems @SenAmyKlobuchar Do you also weep for the private industries forced to shutter due to government regulations?		#KeepItClosed

@simplyemc @themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace You do understand the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade was the best thing that happened to any Black American alive today, correct?		Or am I mistaken in thinking being born into the First World is preferable to the Third...?
@simplyemc @themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace "Stereotyped"?  I was flat-out told an entire subset of the US population 'must' resort to Violent Crime due to "centuries" of Institutional Policies.
@simplyemc @themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace Really?  And why can't people "open their front door"?
@simplyemc @themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace Weird, because the #Freedmen's Bureau of Reconstruction Era in the US after its Civil War were strong proponents of the Individual Right to Arms.		You know?  Because former slaves, change in management, distrust of local authority...
@themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace Again: what is it like to be the #WhiteSavior?
@themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace The fact you think Poverty is an excuse for Violent Crime is even more curious.
@GiffordsCourage So basically, no crimes were committed and yet it is being celebrated as such.		I wonder if you would apply this logic to municipal demographics and where Violent Crime is concentrated?
@themartorana @Jupiter13DFS @teamtrace Restriction of Arms is kind-of inferred from the Original Post because the Death Star highly doubts you are as liberal to the Right to Arms as It, given your placing blame for "centuries" of policies being responsible for Individual Decisions in 2019.		Could be wrong.
@Jupiter13DFS @themartorana @teamtrace What is it like being the #WhiteSavior, anyway?
@Jupiter13DFS @themartorana @teamtrace That is exactly what he told me: that an entire subset of the US population is unable to lift itself from institutional discrimination and poverty and thus must resort to crime after "centuries" of existense.		And I already addressed "sunset".
@themartorana @teamtrace And "sunset" should be "subset".  Fucking Auto-correct.
@themartorana @teamtrace No?  But you just told me an entire sunset of the general US population is stuck in poverty after "centuries" (evidently incapable of rebellion?) and thus must resort to crime in order to function.
@themartorana @teamtrace And apologies.  That should read "subset".		The Death Star still needs an editor.
@themartorana @teamtrace So according to you, after "centuries" an entire sunset of the US population is unable to navigate themselves out of crime and poverty.  Thus, you need to promote the restriction of the Individual Right to Arms in order 'save' this group, correct?		#TheNightmareIsComing
@themartorana @teamtrace "Centuries"?  Interesting.  I didn't realize we have vampires amongst us.
@teamtrace Want to talk demographics or just going to cower out of the conversation?
@teamtrace It seems only to be an excuse by which to further restrict the Individual Right to Arms of adults.
@teamtrace Why does this matter in the context of doctor-assisted suicide being available to the general citizenry?

@teamtrace In the context of individual states allowing for the citizenry to choose to end their life with a doctor's assistance and no raw data presented in the article concerning suicides...		...yeah: this article means nothing.
@becher_casey And honestly, I will go even further: nobody should comply with Red Flag Orders and the Law Enforcement Officers who enforce them need to read their oaths again.		#AgainstAllEnemies	#ForeignAndDomestic
@becher_casey Again: due process would occur BEFORE Rights are violated.		After is an Appeal.  		Everyone affected by the Red Flag standard has to APPEAL to a judge why they should be able to exercise their Rights.
@becher_casey It really isn't and the fact our Individual Rights are being reduced to emojis frightens me.
@becher_casey Having to explain to a judge AFTER Rights have been violated where no crime has been committed is not "due process"...		...how?  How do we have amongst us people who place such a low value on Rights?
@becher_casey You mean having to present to a judge evidence of a crime having occurred or currently occurring?  		Yeah: fully-aware of how a Warrant works.		The Red Flag standard is nothing like a Warrant.
@becher_casey You really believe that violating someone's Rights and granting them an Appeal is "Due Process".		This is insanity.
@becher_casey Due Process would be seeing a judge BEFORE Rights are violated, not after.
@becher_casey The court hearing is an Appeal.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ As far as Red Flag Standard, it is called the 2018 Florida Risk Protection Act.		Nobody has to threaten to kill anyone to be subject to it.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ No, it isn't.  "Due process" occurs BEFORE Rights are violated, not after.		After is called "Appeal".  So yes: you let people APPEAL their Rights being violated.		I can't dumb this down any more for you.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ You can't take something away and then call everything after "due process".		It is absolute insanity Rights are being denegrated in this way.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ ...and then force the Individual to grovel for something granted by Divine Providence, not the State.		'Nice society'...
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ I will frame it for you this way:		I go to cast a ballot.  My ballot is then removed from the total based on an accusation and judge's signature.  I must explain why my ballot should be counted to a judge.		That is your "due process" to exervise a Right: take the Right away...
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ If the Red Flag standard was the same as a Warrant, it wouldn't exist.		The Red Flag standard is nothing more than accusations and a judge's signature with zero evidence a crime has actually taken place.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ And apples-to-apples absolutely is the Free Speech Zones from the George W. Bush administration.		No crime has been committed in either scenario - Free Speech Zone or Red Flag Law - and both make the Individual practically beg to exercise their individual rights.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ It absolutely blows me away you think a judge's signature and having to grovel for your rights is "due process".
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ "Overreaction" to defending individual rights?  Hardly.		Additionally: you write "peaceful", yet enforcing the law is inherently violent.		So the people in the street are advocating for violence against those who do not comply.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ ...taking someone's rights away with only a signature is absolutely NOT due process.  Additionally: nobody has to threaten to kill anyone in order to be subject to Red Flag Standards, so why you continue to use that example is perplexing...
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Tens of thousands of people in the street advocating for the prohibition and suspension of constitutionally protected individual rights is not "hysteria"...?		'Okay'...
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ I would prefer we keep all of our Rights.		I will take #DangerousFreedom over whatever nightmare the Masses have planned.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ ...apples-to-apples would be the "free speech zones" from the George W. Bush administration.		Did you support the "free speech zones"?  Because I sure didn't.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ ...taking your constitutionally-protected and legally-acquired firearms with only a judge's signature is anything but "due process"...
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ ...advocating to restrict and outright ban access to a device protected by multiple state constitions and the US federal constitution...		...a device which kills less than Fists...		...yeah: that is hysteria.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ And maybe you won't be nearly as intellectually dishonest as the others: can you please explain to me how to Red Flag Standard would be applied to the 1st Amendment suspensions and violations?
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Protesting Rifles.		https://t.co/m8cw2IljPL
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ Apologies: need an Editor.		So again: Fists + Knives &gt; Rifles + Shotguns yet access to semiautomatic rifles - see: WA I-1639 - is under assault by the Masses.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ It is called WA I-1639.  Affected ONLY semiautomatic rifles.
@becher_casey @Well_Regulated_ ...then if you add Knives, both Fists and Knives FAR outnumber Rifles and Shotguns.		Yet again, guess which ones the Masses are hysterically in the streets for...

@mcp0711 @ckelvidge @Well_Regulated_ ...so why doesn't the person whose dwelling it is get to dictate how they address their own safety?  Again: on own property, not the party initiating contact...
@ckelvidge @mach5potato @Well_Regulated_ What does that mean?  The occupant of the residence would have been in the wrong to meet me while armed?  If pointing a weapon at me?		I think not.
@davidgaliel @Well_Regulated_ @ckelvidge ...the "rest of us"...?  The dude was on his OWN property...
@endofbellcurve @ckelvidge @Well_Regulated_ As I said: the big take-away here is how early he declared himself to be armed.		But on own property, at dusk?  I would hope our Rights have not devolved to the point where I cannot choose how to meet unknown visitors on my own property.
@Well_Regulated_ @ckelvidge You understand law enforcement is reactionary in this situation and that an arrest is always "suspicion of", yes...?
@mach5potato @ckelvidge @Well_Regulated_ I didn't claim to be "big" and it is interesting you paint meeting an unknown vehicle - again: on own property at dusk - as "sociopathic" behavior.		#IntellectuallySkullFucked

@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee Additionally: it is not only our right to arms under assault, but also our rights to expression and speech.		Poll-after-poll confirms US university students favor curbing the 1st amendment as well.		https://t.co/xVYjgCC53S
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee For instance?  The man who killed the child would enjoy his full rights as a US citizen to a speedy trial, appeal, and execution.		Why would I surrender my Rights when the state can use capital punishment?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee I wouldn't be allowing many criminal offenders out in the first place, as most would be executed.
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee It isn't a "right to guns".  It is a right to arms to defend both self and state.  (The WA state constitution is perhaps the most clearly written.)		Additionally: I think you grossly underestimate how liberally I believe capital punishment to be used.
@Everytown ...but start asking if the same standard will be applied to Voting and get familiar with hearing and reading the word "disenfranchised"...
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee Always funny when people cite nations far more ethnically homogeneous than the US.  (Not to mention far less populous.).		Were you trying to make a point with the BBC link?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee "That's madness."		Individual freedoms and rights clearly scares you.		'Give me freedom or give me death' evidently escapes modern Western liberalism, which is what brought us individual rights in the first place.
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee I would not only give them their firearms back but also their full rights as citizens.		If they can't be full citizens, why are they being released?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee ...but that US society has undergone major upheaval since the 1960s.		Yet you fancy yourself as an academic, unable to recognize what has remained static (the firearms) and what has changed significantly (social norms).
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee ...your article proves my point entirely: the US must be compared to So.

@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee So the right to defend self (and state) and right to life are equal.		Only criminal convictions should lead to suspension of individual rights and all rights should be restored upon completion of incarceration.

@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee ...if the right is "outdated", there is a - wait for it - process to amend the US federal constitution.		Using the judiciary to usurp the constitution is banana republic nonsense, and will send us into a crisis - starting at the state level - if continued.

@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee ...how about waiting 10 business days until your identity can be verified...?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee "Voting shouldn't be the nightmare it is."		I promise you it is far easier for my to cast my (absentee) ballot than any of my firearm purchases.		So which is it: voting becomes more difficult or arms becomes easier to acquire?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee Because I am fighting to grow the Right to Vote, e.g. felons who have completed their incarceration period should immediately have full rights restored.		#AllOfOurRights	#DangerousFreedom
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee ...so you may not be aware, but in the US both the Individual Right to Arms and the Right to Vote are...wait for it...Individual Rights.		And please - please - do not use the tired line of 'but nobody gets killed from voting'.

@danielfrost @Well_Regulated_ Better still: why the CAPS?  Don't go Donald @realDonaldTrump on the Death Star...
@danielfrost @Well_Regulated_ ...there weren't even background checks before the 1960s and the Death Star is of the position that a felon should have full Rights restored upon successful completion of sentence...		...so why the hyperventilating...?
@danielfrost @Well_Regulated_ Considering the Loss is contained within the Family?		Yes. 		My question to you: how does an entirely internal incident involve the State, @NRA , and @SenateGOP ?
@pepeisacat @Well_Regulated_ ...and he very well may do that?  I certainly wouldn't root for it, but could understand the decision if what you are saying is accurate and true...		...so why not let Nature sort this all out?
@Well_Regulated_ ...because his granddaughter being dead isn't enough, so the State needs to take away his freedom and confine him with - possibly - hardened criminals...		...it really amazes me how the Masses eat nonsense like this up.
As far as the former deputy?		I probably wouldn't bring up previous occupation for a while, if ever.		Take the pension because yes: it is owed.  He did his service to State.		But being a recluse would not be the worst retirement option...
@Well_Regulated_ @NRA Money doesn't matter and Arms can be used to simply take Currency or, even better: Labor.		#NextQuestion

@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts @JayInslee ...to ensure this is apples-to-apples: would you apply a literacy standard to Voters?		Just because the paper says you can vote doesn't mean you should be allowed to, right?
@shannonrwatts ...why would NC press charges?  Is a dead kid not enough or do you worship the state that much...?		Pretty sure Nature doled out enough punishment, no?
@Well_Regulated_ ...so basically the firearm did nothing, even involuntarily...
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts ...so Afghan and Iraqi civilians trained to fight US forces but the US population would be unable to train and fight Russian forces...? 		I hope people like @JayInslee are ready for legislatures to come back into session.		#AllOfOurRights
@zubaida_ula @deanna_woolston @MomsDemand @AMarch4OurLives ...you are celebrating stripping individual rights away...
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts ...so if Afghan and Iraqi civilians can beat back the US, why can't US civilians beat back Russia in this mental exercise...?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts ...right...are you under the misconception the US won in Afghanistan or Iraq or something...?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts You write "untrained" and yet...I mean, I wasn't John Rambo or anything but I have been to Afghanistan and Iraq both as a US service member and defense contractor...?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts "Do you really believe an armed civilian such as yourself could hold them off?"		By myself?  Unlikely.		Fairly certain the US occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq disproves the nonsense of the general US public being unable to fight back, though.
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts I don't know?  If you turn on any major US media outlet in the last two years, it certainly appears our Executive branch is simply a proxy for Russia.		No?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts "No one is trying to steal your lands from you."		I am pretty sure for the last two years the Media has essentially told me the current Executive administration has been colluding with a foreign government.		So I/we should disarm in the face of that why...?
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts "The right to arms is an outdated right."		I pray that all Americans recognize this is the End Game as far as firearms laws in this nation is concerned.		Not sure how you think 'this' will end, but I doubt you will be on the frontline enforcing what you allude to.
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts And really, it shows what disregard for human life you have that you would make the process of exercising the individual right to arms - in defense of both self and state - more difficult.
@canuckbookworm @SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts Inanimate objects cannot possess "rights".  What I am for is the individual right to arms, which people can - and do - possess.
@Well_Regulated_ ...so just perform a summary execution and be done.		Not sure why everyone is grating to take individual rights away but here we are.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...so basically, you aren't going to apply the same standards to our other individual rights as our right to arms.		Good talk.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...so does this mean you still won't be explaining where Expression and Speech fit into a worldview where Arms can be stripped away with only a judge's signature and no due process...?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA How do I 'know'?  I don't definitively and only suspect based on your...reluctance?...to address where Expression and Speech fits into your world where Arms can be stripped away with a single accusation and a single signature.		So "we are Venom" if it allows you to 'win' the day?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...because I can already walk you through - what I suspect to be - your planned avenue of reporting me to the Twitter Gestapo.  (If you haven't already.)		Even this Reply, being antagonistic as it is, will be used to 'justify' why 'people like me' should not have access to arms.
Inanimate objects can neither be Causasian nor possess Rights.		Re: Use of the words: "gun-rights advocate".		@WaGunResponsib 	@ThisIsOurLane 	@teamtrace 	@shannonrwatts 	@NRA 	@KaitMarieox
@SteveABC13 @shannonrwatts Still blaming the inanimate objects and not the depravity in Man's heart...?

@ThisIsOurLane @NBCNews @PublicHealth ...100% preventable by not touching someone else's personal belongings...		...amazing what happens when you keep your hands to your own stuff.
@shannonrwatts ...or don't have kids?  Better still: teach kids firearm safety.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...am I left to assume you wouldn't apply the same standard to stripping-away the individual right to vote as the individual right to arms..m?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...you mean like you have been doing this entire time...?		You still haven't addressed whether voting rights should be taken away with a single judicial signature and no due process in the same way 'Red Flag Laws' strip the individual right to arms.

Hey, @Well_Regulated_: want to comment on the NYE incident in Japan or just advocate for confrontation between Individual and State?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA We are confused by "LOL" and such, so call it even?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA Thus, what you should be trying to figure out - what we here at the Death Star are doing - is identifying the social decay and policies which got us to this point.		Hint: open borders plays a significant role.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA I love that you cited an article that lays out exactly what I am saying: the US must be compared to So. Am. nations, not Nordic states.		So contextualized properly, there is nothing wrong with the US.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA Making the observation the 3-year-old may have survived had the attacker used a knife, at best, only addresses a symptom.		At the end of the day, the 3-year-old is still being attacked.		I would be far more concerned with the societal decay creating that reality than the object.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA We don't have a "high level of gun violence".  Again: needs to contextualized properly.  I.e. not compared to Nordic states.		Firearms CAN'T be the problem because they are inanimate objects.  Inanimate objects are wholly incapcable of causation.
@Well_Regulated_ @shannonrwatts ...you realize human silouettes is what both law enforcement and the military shoot at, correct...?		You should read Grossman's "On Killing" to understand why.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA I am 'okay' with it because the firearms aren't the problem. 		The firearms as a mechanical device remain static.  It is the culture and people around the firearms that has changed and is changing.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA Yes, I am very sure.  Where you look only at Homicide rate, I look at the entire picture.		The US was FAR safer from violent crime in 1960.  (And the numbers will get even more glaring if we go back to the 1950s.)		https://t.co/ZcZtDB1RXG
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA 1. Not in the slightest.  However, as firearms are inanimate objects, the population in possession of them is what must be compared for apples-to-apples.  Thus, the US cannot be compared to more homogeneous societies.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA 3. Again: we didn't even have background checks prior to 1968 yet mass shootings were unheard of.		I would propose restoring our culture back to its 1950s glory.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA 2. Seeing as how the level of violence is very much lower than our peers in Africa and So. America?		Yes: I am fine.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA 1. What "other countries"?  For that matter, what is "exceeding"?  Keeping apples-to-apples, the US is closer in ethnic diversity to nations found in Africa and South Am.  We are doing just fine when compared to our peers.  So since firearms are inanimate objects? 		People.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA To tell you how anti-freedom I think you are: I want my POC lesbian neighbors to be able to defend their cocaine with firearms.		I suspect you view the world radically differently and are an enemy to freedom.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA Because here is what I think: I think your standard for suspending and otherwise limiting the individual right to arms is at a FAR lower threshold than any other individual right.		This is intellectual dishonesty and, if true, demonstrates you as nothing but a schill.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA So again, for intellectual honesty: are you fine with voting rights being suspended only with a judge's signature?		To demonstrate where I stand, I firmly believe it to be absurd full-rights are not immediately restored upon completion of sentence.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...if you think any of our individual rights are free to be suspended with only a judge's signature, you clearly place little value on them...
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ @NRA ...so basically our individual rights can be suspended with only a judge's signature and no due process (since, you know: nobody was actually convicted of a crime in a court in the Maryland instance)...I suspect you sing a different tune when discussing the Red Scare in the US...
For instance: you better believe the Media - and when control is resumed, the State - will be downplaying incidents such as these in order to advance a social agenda.		https://t.co/E8dFTgNk8T

@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ I am not an @NRA member and think the organization is worthless.		If the group was legitimately fighting for our rights, we wouldn't need a Class III license for automatic weapons. https://t.co/bkZavFtCMZ
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ What "point"?  That criminals steal firearms so the 'solution' is to make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to exercise a constitutional right?		How, exactly, is that a solution?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ More fun facts: ~70% of firearms used in crimes are stolen.  So less US household firearm ownership, more strict gun control measures, and more deaths are caused by criminals and the 'solution' is to...		...make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to exercise a right...?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ These "limitations" are confined to what is commonly available to the 'militia', per Heller.		That means absolutely nothing less than a semiautomatic rifle and, I would argue, 'squad automatic weapons'.  (Which are available only via a Class III license, which is also bogus.)
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ "More gun deaths are suicides than homicides."		In the context of legalized assisted suicide within individual states in the Union, why are suicide by firearm numbers relevant to any discussion?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ Additionally, "well-regulated" is clearly written in reference to a militia and Heller also determined - even though any literate could read - our right to arms is not collective and not bound to any militia or any militia "regulations"...
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ Available to the US public since 1910, no background checks until 1968, judges come along in 2008... https://t.co/cBHR3Cp9UB
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...'amazing' how the Heller decision referred to semiautomatic rifles as being 'uncommon' to civilians, even though it has been available commerically to the US public since the 1910s...and again: there weren't even background checks until 1968...Judges don't trump constitutions.
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...so why is the ATF 4187 "reasonable" and how is this different from a literacy test in order to vote...?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...and again: you referred to 'easy access to firearms', yet do not dispute acquiring a firearm in 2018 is infinitely more difficult than any other time in our history...		...so would you like to walk back the assertion it is 'easy' to acquire a firearm...?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...so background checks - the ATF 4187 - doesn't conflict with the Fourth Amendment...?
@shrimpfajita1 ...I "ask this nonsense" because people act as-if reality is similar to "Beauty and the Beast", where inanimate objects act of their own volition...
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...so you are going to need to clarify "readily accessible" as compared to what?  Nations without explicit constitutional protections to the individual right to arms or our own history...?
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...by "readily-accessible" do you mean far more restrictive than any law before the 1960s or any law before the 1920s...?		Because before 1968, anyone could walk into a hardware store and walk out with a firearm...		...household-ownership is also at all-time lows in the US...
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...so it isn't the fact "road rage" and having to interact with people is the problem, or needing to grow better citizens who don't resort to physical violence over traffic infractions, but the...		...inanimate object...
@DrylyRiley @Well_Regulated_ ...weird, because the headline references "road rage" and the article describes motorists being aggrivated with each other...
@peecheykeen @shannonrwatts ...and correction: "infants", in the plural.		Start from youngest on both Maternal and Paternal bloodlines and ascend from there.		Those are the rules.		Now: is it the inanimate object or people?

So much for 'rather die on my feet than live on my knees'..
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...you mean like how countries such as Belgium and France have far higher robbery rates than the US?		No, thanks: I will keep my firearms and belongings.  You can be the sucker without a means to meet the threat on equal terms... https://t.co/aDrRhVFlbu
@Well_Regulated_ ...this is a constitutional republic, not a democracy.		The will of the Masses and judicial decisions only matter so much.
@Well_Regulated_ ...no, how you are living your life is by trying to regulate mine through Tweets, which I am sure you hope translates into votes at the ballot box legislating and restricting access to arms...
@Well_Regulated_ ...don't bring a firearm with you to look at a vehicle because the guy selling it might be armed and we wouldn't want you to be able to meet him on equal terms...?		https://t.co/4gHLQDAJFM
@Well_Regulated_ ...because if someone else with ill-intent comes in with a firearm, I want myself and my fellow citizens to be at a disadvantage because...?
@Well_Regulated_ ...your Tweet has no power other than to influence the Masses to pass legislation authorizing the blunt force of the State to impede my individual right to arms.		Not sure how you think this all ends...
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...what I look forward to is when a law-abiding citizen cannot retrieve his or her firearm because of storeage laws.		I hope the estate cleans the local municipality out of every cent it has.
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...so since we have already established household ownership is at its lowest point in the US ever and that ~79% of firearms used in a crime are stolen, we need more laws because...		...it needs to be more difficult for law-abiding citizens to retrieve a firearm?
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...and I just showed you hard data where ~79% of criminals who used firearms in the course of a crime acquired it in Pittsburgh: stolen.		So basically, make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to acquire a lifesaving device because criminals violate the law...		...logical.
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...you do realize there is more firearms in the US than people, correct...?		"Down on the corner, out here in the street" isn't just a song lyric or meme...
@Dawnsway63 @DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...yeah: if we are resorting to "punctuation and grammar", you may as well send your Gestapo and we can get this started since logic, evidently, eludes.
@Dawnsway63 @DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...just curious: in what instance has prohibition of anything has resulted in whatever is being prohibited being completely unobtainable...?
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...you are presuming 'they won't have a gun' and neither will you based on...?		...the fact it is more difficult for you to obtain one.. ?
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...why is the person who demonstrated a willingness to use violence over a petty dispute assumed - disregarding laws prohibiting assault and murder - to have less of a chance to possess a firearm if more barriers are put in place to legal ownership versus the law-abiding citizen?
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ @Everytown @CONSMILITIA @WaGunResponsib https://t.co/K72qxB9tGw		Gun Rights = Civil Rights
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ https://t.co/a1pEz5hkuv
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...~79% of crimes committed with firearms are performed by someone other than the person who purchased the firearm...		 ...so why is it, exactly, it is 'so obvious' more laws will work when that is proven false by a staggering amount...? @Everytown @CONSMILITIA @WaGunResponsib https://t.co/rnRdx7LxTR
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...no: you will just be the sucker without the ability to meet the threat on equal terms.
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ..."most people aren't determined enough"...		...no, just determined enough to commit to violence against me for petty reasons.		No, thanks: you can be the sucker.
@Well_Regulated_ https://t.co/uvoUqvX1tt
@Well_Regulated_ ...'shocking' that some of us aren't just going to roll-over like a dog when it comes to individual rights, I know...
@Dawnsway63 @DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...explain what?  The imaginary world where a tool doesn't exist...?
@DavidHRobb @Well_Regulated_ ...how can the firearm be removed from this equation when the assailant disregarded laws already prohibiting assault and murder?.		Why is the onus on the law-abiding citizen to 'play by the rules' when it comes to individual defense...?
@Well_Regulated_ ...so basically one person who violated multiple laws (e.g. illegal to assault people) was stopped by another person who was able to meet the threat quickly and on equal terms.		So we want to make it more difficult for the latter to acquire the device which saved him because...?
@MelissaFoersch2 @CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @Everytown @NRA You refer to this as a "weird rant" and @CONSMILITIA wants to advocate for an institutional body as satisfying an individual right.  (Never mind the people writing it distrusting standing armies.)		I bet you don't think the ATF 4473 violates the Fourth Amendment, either...
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA (Flees Crown, distrusts standing armies, guarantees the right to arms only under permission and guidance from the State in the form of 'militias' and is 'understood' to be a "conjoined right" in a list of individual rights.)		Yeah: I am the "uneducated"...
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...so I will continue building my own 'militia' in order to make this explicit that the State does not have a monopoly on either war or local security.		Our individual rights come first and absolutely no not depend on the State asking me to muster.
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ..."absurd" is arguing - once again - that "the People" is understood to be a "conjoined right" in a list of individual rights.  (To include where the word "individual" is explicitly used.)		The 'militas' are a byproduct, not foundation, of the individual right to arms.
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...so what if I already did 5 1/2 years of "militia duty"?		Do I get to be in charge of my local militia?
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...the local municipal parade does not satisfy my right to peaceably assemble.		The local newspaper does not satisfy my speech protections.		Arguing a local militia - approved by the State - satisfies my individual right to arms is insanity.
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ..."the People" is not a collective or "conjoined" right.		To say the explicit word "individual" means 'something else' where such application is found nowhere else is disingenuous at best and outright "1984" horrifying at worst.
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...render the WA state constitution as 'unconstitutional' and watch what happens.		#ConstitutuonalRepublicNotBanana
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...'unconstitutional' since ratification by your logic... https://t.co/lXfmZHaHsV
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...a "conjoined" right?  Yeah, no: no government institution statisfies anyone's individual right to arms.		The general US public is going to be shocked to what degree individuals will preserve these rights granted by our Creator.
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...and again: why has the WA state constitution been allowed to stand as an explicitly individual right?		By your logic, the guaranteed individual right to arms in WA has been federally unconstitutional since ratification.
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...rights are not limited by the tecnologies available.		Why is "the People" only 'understood' to be a collective right in the second amendment to the US federal constitution but not every other?		Why does the New York Times not satisify first amendment protections?
@bychadsokol @OlympiaJoe ...this means the municipality will defend me against the ATF/DEA/DHS also, correct...?
@teamtrace ...why is the firearm at greatest fault 'ever' but not the selfie...?		...why not regulate selfies...?
@MelissaFoersch2 @FredOstu @CONSMILITIA @Everytown @NRA ..."more guns"?  Household ownership of firearms in the US is at its lowest point ever...
@MelissaFoersch2 @FredOstu @CONSMILITIA @Everytown @NRA ...you can draw far more correlation between societal decay, declination in household firearm ownership, and increase in firearms laws than arguing the laws being lax are the reason for deaths...
@MelissaFoersch2 @FredOstu @CONSMILITIA @Everytown @NRA ...how can our gun laws be at a "20 year low" when there weren't even background checks before the 1960s...?
@MelissaFoersch2 @CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @Everytown @NRA ..."and for support of this declaration, with firm reliance on Divine Providence, we pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Sacred Honor."
@CONSMILITIA @FredOstu @MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown @NRA ...the WA state constitution was ratified in 1889, long after the federal constitution, and explicitly protects the individual's right to arms in defense "of himself and the state".		Where again, it is simply making explicit the federal constitution's commas.
@MelissaFoersch2 @FredOstu @Everytown ...so let me get this straight: because I am willing to defend my individual rights - "argue about gun control" - I 'must be a paid bot'?		A portion of the US public is going to be in for a very rude-awakening if they think citizens are going to quietly surrender their rights.
@MelissaFoersch2 @FredOstu @Everytown ...I am getting paid for this?!  "LOL".		Every time that accusation is made, I laugh.  It is an enormous compliment.
@MelissaFoersch2 @Everytown ...is being popular supposed to be synonymous with something or are you still waiting for people to sit with you at the lunch table like this elementary school...?		My - our - individual rights depend on no one else's approval.
@SilverFoxReturn @Bradybuzz @Well_Regulated_ ..."regulate" what...?
@Well_Regulated_ ...Washington state's state constitution is explicit regarding the individual Right to Arms, lest the commas in the US federal constitution prove confusing...
@Bradybuzz @Well_Regulated_ ...so is my driver's license a Right at this point, then...?
@Everytown ...the Useful Idiot label is appropriate.		#ThisWeWillDefend https://t.co/g9GYwkZaxO
@shannonrwatts @NRA ...dollars-to-doughnuts the NSA facility in Utah which houses untold amounts of data can match firearms to individuals...
@shannonrwatts @NRA ...Manning and Snowden leaked all of that information and you think the State keeps zero records that would enable it to match firearms with individuals...?		'Okay'...
@SilverFoxReturn @treecarverbill @mlnphilapa @ThisIsOurLane @peter_masiakos @Well_Regulated_ ...so regulate how copper and/or steel can be cast...?		..."LOL"...		...wouldn't fixing society be a more permanent solution that benefits the greatest number of people...?
@sandyhook ...this entire Tweet could be dedicated to the public's inaction in challenging state and federal governments...
@Independent ...he didn't use a firearm and everyone is pretty kosher with abortion in the US at this point so, unfortunately, this won't be gaining traction...
@davidhogg111 @DLoesch ...the US defended against the Bolsheviks so...?
@SilverFoxReturn @mlnphilapa @ThisIsOurLane @peter_masiakos @Well_Regulated_ ...honest question: would you support capital punishment for theft?		E.g. if someone is convicted of stealing multiple times, they are put to death.		Because it is 'my' "responsibility" to protect against burglary, no?		Capital Punishment &gt; Surrendering Individual Rights
@mlnphilapa @ThisIsOurLane @peter_masiakos ...so my driver's license is an individual right now...?		...and why isn't voting being treated as a "public health crisis" with literacy tests...?
@Ocasio2018 ...an open subscription Marxist ideology being fraudulent is probably why you aren't being given the benefit-of-the-doubt...?		And spare the Death Star any Collectivist Poker.  The Turn is ceded in order to (eagerly) await the final results of 'real' communism/socialism...
@Daytonanurse @davidhogg111 @NRA ...couldn't care less about the candidates donated to...		...at this point in our economy, some 7-year-old is making a monetary figure analagous to his age to open toys on YouTube...		...our individual right to arms does not depend on campaign contributions (or lack of)...
@JamesWi61543868 @shannonrwatts ...the appeal to one's rational nature and subsequent compromise each iteration of legislation is makes the Death Star grow concerned for individual rights...
@bjamesbarlow @davidhogg111 @NRA ...one would think "necessary ally" is somewhat synonymous with "found a way to work with", but as it is not...		...does persuasion into the UN after the War qualify...?		...also, while rivals, neither side has been eager to get into a 'hot' confrontation.  That must count?
@davidhogg111 ...considering our grandparents' generation found a way to work with Stalin and the Soviets, the Russia fear-mongering won't work with the Death Star...		...our individual right to arms does not depend on the @NRA...
@Everytown ...so if "comprehensive background checks" are so popular, why not literacy checks in order to vote...?		And please: don't say 'voting has never killed anyone'...
@GreeleyLiberal @shannonrwatts ...nobody at the Death Star is a fan of the Donald...		...what we are fans of is hard reason.  You know what else has exploded since the 1970s in the US?		Children born out of wedlock.		But yeah: it is the inanimate object...
@davidhogg111 ...research the inanimate object all you want.		The only thing you are doing is exposing how faulty our society is.		To wit: the data you and @Everytown has been repeating concerning gun violence in the black American community.
@shannonrwatts ...amazing how the semiautomatic rifle has been commercially available to the US public for ~100 years and background checks didn't start until the 1960s but somehow the decimation of US culture since the 1950s isn't on social trial...
@ACLU @davidhogg111 ...it is called "fratricide".		(Insert whatever word @ArianaGrande says to bring on her next male suitor.)
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...we can agree people shouldn't kill themselves, certainly.		Beyond that I don't think we will find much common ground, as the Death Star is not going to advocate for the suspension of individual rights due to self-determination, to include suicide...
@rolf_boone @theolympian @AbbySpegman ...looks like the South Sound could use a private security company that is more willing to allow its employees to assert their lawful standing as guardians of private domain...
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...we can tell people to not kill themselves until we are blue in the face.		So what?  What actions are being suggested to mitigate the fact people use firearms to kill themselves?  		And why are we trying to mitigate? Isn't self-determination a right...?
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...Method and Motive: people are killing themselves via firearms...		...what does that have to do with every other firearm owner not killing themselves...?
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...if the goal is to eliminate homicide and suicide, focusing on the inanimate object is the wrong way...		...where is the campaign to restore the nuclear family in the US...?
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...but what does that have to do with the firearm and by extension, anyone else...?		People are killing themselves with firearms and awareness is being raised.  And then...?
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...suicides should absolutely not be a factor in determining who is able to exercise the individual right to arms...		...as far as mass shootings?  The Death Star argues social decay in the US since the 1950s...
@UHartVSGuns @sandyhook @USATODAY ...so what happens when someone does not 'seek help' and more directly: who gets to determine who 'needs help' and thus cannot exercise their individual right to arms...?
The same people - @NancyPelosi, @Ocasio2018, @GovInslee, and so on - pushing for the authority to increase taxes for our 'collective good to fight climate change' are the same people pushing to disarm you.		The real resistance is just starting.		#ArmedPeopleCanViolentlyObject

@teamtrace ...using children to control the parents is straight "1984"...

@ACLU ...it is called "fratricide" and it doesn't discriminate...
@KamalaHarris @davidhogg111 ...why is the minimum age to possess a firearm increasing (and the process to obtain one significantly more strict) while at the same time arguments are being made to decrease the voting age and expand domestic social welfare programs...?

@Everytown ...always interesting the inanimate object is blamed.		Why not regulate interpersonal relationships?
@Hot_McBastards @nowthisnews @Ocasio2018 ...(turns on news for last three weeks) how is it a "fantasy" when it is actively happening...?
@nowthisnews ...so anyone - @Ocasio2018 - want to explain the "Green New Deal" through the prism of the rioting in France or are we just going to see how hard any pushback here in the US is once the Green New Deal's authoritarianism and taxes takes hold...?
@loganlife14 @shannonrwatts @NRA 3. So in addition to his ears not working, is the Death Star now to presume his eyes could see neither the flash light nor officers?
@loganlife14 @shannonrwatts @NRA 1. So then how do LEOs and soldiers communicate with each other during shootings if shouting commands and responding as a listerner is not possible?		2. Gerald M. Smith, Summit County (OH), ~March 21, 2012.  Broke into stepson's home with firearm.  (Shoots self in arm.)
@shannonrwatts @NRA ...actually, it is pretty simple: when authorities are giving you commands to drop a firearm, it is probably in one's best interest to do so...		...how many more times should the officers have told him to put down the firearm, Junior?
@davidhogg111 It is called "fratricide" and is unfortunate part of armed conflict.
Gun Control is Racist		#TheFreedmensBureau		@NRA	@Everytown	@WaGunResponsib		https://t.co/k1Du1nI7Uv

@sandyhook ...if you are a Veteran promoting the State to forcibly violate an individual's right to arms and claim 'red flag laws' are "due process"...?		Always remember: against all enemies; foreign and domestic.
@OurRevolution ...just as a semiautomatic rifle cannot "assault" anything, a wall cannot be "racist"...
@nytimes ...so then Firearms aren't the Problem...
@MarlowNYC @Trevornoah False.  The Freedmen's Bureau were proponents of the individual right to arms.		Why?		Because being a former slave in a territory just defeated in war with new management means at a local level...
@teamtrace ...so the US has a penal code...?
@davidhogg111 ...our individual rights are not contingent on the funding levels of non-government organizations...
@tomselliott ...the Death Star's stance is to deplete the Resources of Others before Self...
@Everytown And to @NPR as-well: the Death Star absolutely will not leave an Individual LEO to the Masses in an incident where facts are not known and which can best be described, thus far, as "fratricide"...
@ClaytonClent ...this is supposing the Citizen-State relationship is inherently unequal...		...the Death Star argues the Citizen and State must be Peers...
@teamtrace @AlexYablon Our Rights do not depend on the @NRA.
@ClaytonClent ...those actions involve harm to another Party, which the Death Star agrees with laws pertaining to (e.g. Murder)...		...nobody should have firearms taken away because they do not wish to be part of the collective, however...
@davidhogg111 ...the 'funny' part is the number of people killed by democide would be staggering when compared to current levels of violence in the US Populace...
@delaneytarr ...you mean 'human violence with firearms'...		...guns are inanimate...
@davidhogg111 ...the @NRA doesn't matter to constitutional and individual rights...		...our Rights are granted at Birth by our Creator.  The State's job is to acknowledge those Rights or get out of the way...
@loisbeckett @VivianHo ...is this a joke...?
Good morning, @seattletimes and @theolympian: maybe today @GovInslee, @WaGunResponsib, and @Everytown will answer?		Will honorably discharged veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with WA I-1639?
@ClaytonClent ...not "all laws", but most certainly laws which aim only to discourage "antisocial behavior".		The idea of depriving individual freedom because someone does not wish to be part of the collective is freightening...
@Everytown And we are now at the point where utilizing the State as a blunt force against the Populace to forcibly remove a quarter of legally owned firearms from homes is being argued.
The Death Star wishes to be very clear: your constitutional and individual right to arms has nothing to do with the @NRA.
@teamtrace ...very "1984" for the State to use the children as the avenue through which to control the parents...
@robferdman @Ocasio2018 ...'interesting' disarming of the Jews is not mentioned as part of the process...
@ClaytonClent ...and remedial typing classes for the errors in the last response.  Apologies, should be "subjective"...
@ClaytonClent ...so there are indeed restrictions then.		"Bigoted" is a subiective word.
@ClaytonClent ...in short: a white supremacist ran over - killing - a protester last year in Virginia (US)...		...it is the Death Star's stance that if you believe someone is going to run you over with a vehicle?  You may do what is necessary - to include using a firearm - to prevent it...
@ClaytonClent ...the Alan Jones saga would not happen in the US....
@ClaytonClent ...if "that is what law enforcement is for", why is there currently a trial regarding the death of a protester in Virginia last year...?
@bjorn ...hey, @markzuckkchs16: just sit down in front of these elected 'leaders' and tell them: "At least Cambridge Analytica paid."
@sandyhook ...how many other "high income nations" have a constitutional and individual right to arms...?
Hey @Ocasio2018: https://t.co/ST5SuWquWx
@dorothyofisrael @AuschwitzMuseum @yadvashem @LindseyGrahamSC @Ocasio2018 ...curious no mention of disarming the Jews prior to extermination as well...		...dehumanize anyone all you want.  If armed, the group can actively and violently disagree and resist...
Hey @seattletimes and @theolympian: can you get @GovInslee and @WaGunResponsib to answer whether honorably discharged veterans will have to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
@jchaltiwanger ...you mean like disarming the Jews prior to extermination?		Is that what Herr @davidhogg111 and @Everytown has in store for us...?
Again, @GovInslee, @WaGunResponsib, and @Everytown: will honorably discharged veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with WA I-1639?
@cairand @Everytown ...it is freightening you choose to disengage conversation when the topic at hand is the individual right to arms...		...where do you think this all ends, exactly...?
https://t.co/DiHhWIkD1R
@cairand @Everytown Because I can look families in the eyes knowing the inanimate object is not the problem.		You can't, I suspect, look them in the eyes and tell them People are.
@cairand @Everytown ...there has been 11 major pieces of federal firearm legislation made into law since 1934.  Before 1968, there weren't even background checks.  Household firearm ownership is down significantly since the 1960s.		Yet the 'problem" persists.  So what is it MORE laws will do?
@cairand @Everytown ...because I will sit here all take and take responsibility for inanimate objects and, if need be, tell it to victim's families.		You going to do the same as the access to arms is restricted?
@cairand @Everytown ...reduces "lethality" for whom?  As a law-abiding citizen, what guarantees do I have that once my access to arms is restricted I won't be the victim of a violent crime I *could* have addressed head-on with a firearm?		And if I am a victim, are YOU going to take responsibility?
@ClaytonClent "Happy for licensed individuals to possess any weapon necessary for occupation."		...so it only pleases the Crown for those with a license in an occupation to have a firearm...?
@ClaytonClent ...the right to armed defense is a "personal hobby"...		...interesting.  So being able to fend off, say, 30 white supremacists is a past time...
@ClaytonClent ...what "hasn't happened"?  Tyranny?		It absolutely has.  Just the expression and speech restrictions our colonial cousins enforce distinguishes political cultures between the US and its colonial cousins.
@ClaytonClent It is the Death Star's position the US populace cannot surrender semiautomatic rifles.		Once those are removed and greatly restricted?		All bets are off as far as being able to legitimately entertain holding back the State.		#USOccupationsInAFGandIZ
@ClaytonClent ...so keeping with the lead-public health analogy, what level of firearm does it please the Crown for me to possess...?		Additionally: that fewer people are keen to assert their rights is of no concern to the Death Star.
@ClaytonClent ...inanimate objects aren't a "public health issue"...		...the "public health issue" is a society in decay since the 1960s...		...interestingly, in the time US society has declined?  Household firearms ownership has gone down significantly...
@cairand @Everytown ....here's one for you, Professor: https://t.co/iecmu8DhAr
@MBSpaff @SBCMS @ThisIsOurLane ...forgive us at the Death Star, for we are illiterates...		...please, Professor: explain what 'it is about' if it isn't about what actually happened...?
@cairand @Everytown ...the firearm isn't inserting itself into a "contentious encounter" of its own volition...		...the problem is People, which is why the Death Star believes the attention is on the inanimate object...		...otherwise, the Masses would have to concede People are the problem...
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...either a Class III license or NICS check requires more than just a signature...		...what kind of investigation should be done, exactly...?
@cairand @Everytown ...seems like a better avenue would be to address our societal decay.		Choosing to tackle the symptom - firearms - does nothing other than give people good feelings...		...firearms laws have only become more strict since 1934...
@cairand @Everytown ...those are all societal problems, not anything to do with firearms...		...continuing to restrict firearms will only make it more difficult for DV victims to acquire...		...the aggressor will acquire, legally or not...
@SBCMS @ThisIsOurLane ...still confused as to how a medical doctor gets to dictate a constitutional right...
@Everytown ...isn't the problem relationships...?		Because of the three parties to the conversation, one is an inanimate object...
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...prior to 1968 there weren't even background checks so...		...I don't know?  But you can't argue the laws are 'loose' when, historically, that is completely untrue...
@shannonrwatts @NRA ...so do you know what happened?		Because to the Death Star this appears to be "fratricide", with the caveat the deceased was not in any easily distinguishable and identifiable kit...
@Everytown ...so does anyone actually know what happened other than a chaotic situation where the deceased is connected to one of the victims or just using this as an opportunity to blame inanimate objects...?
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...but the firearms laws have only become more strict since 1934...
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...with a Class III license there would be no difference...		...if the point is to regulate handguns in the same manner as Class III items I would argue that is nothing short of extortion...
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand Additionally: there has been 11 major pieces of federal firearm legislation enacted into law since 1934 in the US.		At what point does it stop?  Because mechanically, nothing is really changing with the firearms in that time.		What has changed since is our society.
Hey, @WaGunResponsib: the semiautomatic rifle has been available to the general US public for over a century.		Ever considered the culture which has been created in the US since the 1960s and 1970s is the problem?
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...you write "banned" yet multiple examples you used are able to be transferred with a Class III license...		...regarding "poison" being "banned", would you like a picture from any household section in a grocery store...?
Maybe @Everytown will answer: will honorably discharged veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with WA I-1639?
Good morning, @GovInslee: will honorably discharged veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
Hey, @DonaldJTrumpJr : why am I now reading about China holding 2 x US citizens as part of a growing trend known as an 'exit ban'?
@DJChurchTwitch @Simmonds91R @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand I would start by asking, after every shooting: 'Where's dad?'		The questions should ascend from there.
@DJChurchTwitch @Simmonds91R @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...if you want my alternative?  We need to fix our culture.		One-way-or-another, we have to see ourselves as unified...		...coherent as a populace and state.
@DJChurchTwitch @Simmonds91R @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...so the inanimate object, which largely remains static over centuries as far as basic principles, is the problem here and not...		...the variants around it?
@DJChurchTwitch @Simmonds91R @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...the Death Star agrees we need more amendments - though we should be careful not to become France with hundreds - but if it was so 'common sense', why has the right to arms not been amended to be reduced or prohibited...?
@DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...if I already have to ask permission, why is more scrutiny needed...?		Because if following firearms legislation in the US, the items are becoming less easy to legally acquire, not more.		So what is the end-game here, exactly...?
@DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...you say 'you'll still get the gun', and yet...		...why am I having to ask permission?
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...as-in a ballot and firearm in the US must be scrutinized in the same manner.		I promise you: it is FAR easier to vote in the US than purchase a firearm.
@Simmonds91R @DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...so in the US, "arms" is a constitutional guarantee...		...in the State of WA it is explicitly individual...		...for an apples-to-apples analogy, the word you are looking for is "ballot"...
@DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...so why would I agree to limit my ability to acquire a device that protects me from the far greater risk (People) using the argument that same device is 'more dangerous' when that is patently false?
@DJChurchTwitch @MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...I promise: in a setting of me and either 100 Loyal Opposition Political Members or 100 Loaded Firearms, the latter will most certainly not kill me.		The former, on the other hand...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so then why the complaints?  The optics look bad with him hitting her, yes.		That is using your eyes, not your brain.		Reason dictates the LEO acted accordingly.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...as-if that statement exists in one.  (Again: if you don't want to get punched in the face?  Don't kick at people.)
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...I get the feeling you don't understand Vacuums, since you want to create one by refusing to acknowledge what happens when Local Security Forces do not have the monopoly on violence and continue to refer to 'hitting a female in handcuffs'...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...and controlled by Robber Barons...		...which I am completely fine with.		And you?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...local security forces, whatever...		...what do you think happens when local security is not the dominant party...?		Because even looking at US history, it would just be privatized (think the Pinkertons)...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so at a base level, local law enforcement is the reason I - or someone like me - am not your local warlord...
@mic @Uptown_Buck You know who did?		The Freedmen's Bureau.
@MarkSeamonMD @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @DocsDemand ...it is called "fratricide" and again: we have zero idea what happened here other than it was a chaotic situation with a lot of people.		Let's pump the brakes on blaming the inanimate object and LEO.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...unlike many of these LEO's own Departments, will not leave individual officers to the Masses for Use of Force.		If you don't want to get punched in the face?  Don't kick at people.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...we probably have common ground regarding the War on Drugs and the Death Star will be taking Departments to task on why SWAT was created and how it was hijacked...		...but LEOs are the same as anyone else and the Death Star...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...when its members cannot even explain an alternative resolution to meeting physical force with physical force.		#MikeBrownDeservedEveryBulletHeGot
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so I find it abhorrant the populace wants its 'pound of flesh' from someone who elected, while compensated monetarily by the state, to perform a societal function very few individuals actually want to do...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...decling to meet physical violence by electing to withdrawal and wait, while a strategy, is not a definitive solution...		...thus far, only a stalemate has been presented...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...I know of more than one female who would love such an advantage in physical combat.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so you don't have an actual solution other than to have to resort to physical force as well, you just don't like the LEO depicted...?		It is strange to me that when presented with physical violence, the first thing you consider is who is committing it...
@HScornik @ThisIsOurLane ...it is called "fratricide" and isn't unique to concealed carriers...		...it is an unfortunate byproduct of armed conflict...		...we have no idea what happened here, other than it was a chaotic scene with a lot of people.
@krassenstein @DLoesch We do have common ground, Brian, in-that teachers should not be armed.
@krassenstein @DLoesch This is called "fratricide", @davidhogg111 .  It is an unfortunate but very real part of armed conflict.
"What is going on here?" with the Saudis, @DonaldJTrumpJr .  Figure since your dad won't answer why the House of Saud is considered an "ally" to the US, you might step up and answer?		#The911HijackersWereSaudis
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...still waiting for your Move after withdrawing from physical violence and contemplating...		...or is that your plan as an LEO?  To withdraw from physical violence and wait until the Second Coming...?
Hey, @WaGunResponsib: will honorably discharged Veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...because if your plan is to wait me out, I can lay on my back in handcuffs for hours/days/weeks/months/years/decades/centuries/millenia...		...unless, you know?		You got something?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...you wrote that you would respond to physical violence (kicking) by 'stepping back' in order to evaluate...		...so, Professor: are you going to play your next move or are we staring at each other...?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...oh, sorry: you would respond to physical violence by retreating your position...		...and then we would what?  Sit there and look at each other...?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...I am proposing to respond to physical violence with physical violence, you are proposing to respond to physical violence by 'thinking', and I am wrong...		..."LOL"...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa Going back to a model where private parties assume local security is in the best interests of the US.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...the state is currently 'holding things together' and doing a poor job of it.		Which is why the Death Star welcomes the return of private security, such as the 19th century Pinkerton agency.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so once done 'planning', you would...?		Or do your actions stop with you stepping away and thinking while someone else is actively using physical force...?
Again, @GovInslee: will honorably discharged Veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...in other words: just continue to be kicked...		...curious nobody here has offered an alternative to physical force when being kicked...		...what should have been the 'right' response?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa I am not certain of any "thin blue line" and assure you my control of the battle space will be drastically different from what you are accustomed to.
@dannazaruk @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...as a citizen, when I am engaging in physical conflict against the state's armed representatives, I expect the representative to meet me with physical force.  		Doing so most certainly does not violate my rights.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa Because once local law enforcement is cleared from the 'playing field', so to speak, the power vacuum will need to be filled.		Overwhelming violence will rule the day and I look forward to being your local warlord.
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa Interesting it is "spineless" to meet physical force with equal or greater force, but what?		'Heroic' to take a few kicks to the face...		...we at the Death Star celebrate the continued erosion of local law enforcement and are eager for Thunderdome.
@dannazaruk @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...you continue to write "HANDCUFFED" as-if that precludes the female from being the primary aggressor or renders her legs inoperable...		...I suspect the optics of this incident is what bothers you the most, not anything rational.
@dannazaruk @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...if I kick you and you punch me, how is the latter action "retaliatory"...?
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa https://t.co/D2pp1bYCOk
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so if I am kicking you and otherwise physically uncooperative, which part of that makes you feel like you're 'in control' of the situation...?		Better still: as a public employee you are supposed to tolerate physical violence without meeting it...
@dannazaruk @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so when someone kicks at me multiple times and I punch them in the face to end the threat, that is "retaliation"...		...and evidently being kicked isn't "threatening"...
@MonroeSputnik @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...so it is not possible for me to kick you when handcuffed?  Interesting logic...		...do you frequently deal with combative individuals?  I have never met someone who wins all physical confrontations without taking any shots...
@OIFvetUSMC02 @MomsDemand ...nobody needs the @NRA to advance individual rights.  The basic function of a semiautomatic rifle has not changed in the approximate century the rifle has been available to the US public.		Society, on the other hand, has evidently declined?
@TopKniFe_B @ThisIsOurLane @NRA @Bradybuzz @GiffordsCourage ...freightening to watch the same crowd clamoring to disarm the populace be the same people decimating local law enforcement in order to appeal to the Masses in the street...		...our own Cultural Revolution a la Mao in China is on the horizon...
@dannazaruk @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...and strange it should "never be an option."  So in order to meet a threat, you don't meet it with equal or superior force?		How, exactly, do you propose gaining control of a geographic area, Professor?
@Everytown ...so rather than teach children how to use firearms properly and try to mitigate dangers (don't handle them if there isn't a 'need'?), instead condone increased surveillance and the march toward "1984"...
@Teressa_Raiford @RoseCityAntifa ...because nothing here would lead any normal observer to suspect possible amphetamines and various organ failures could be at play...
@dannazaruk @theappeal @RoseCityAntifa Hope you are ready for the descent into chaos with such an inept security apparatus.		The Death Star will be here for you when needed, though. https://t.co/0Ws9vJfbwc
Classic. https://t.co/SKekPO5B1I
@theappeal @RoseCityAntifa ...if she didn't want to get punched, why was she kicking at the officer...?		Like Charleena Lyles: does she not understand force will be met with greater force?
@Ocasio2018 ...people "are going to die" even if we do nothing...		...on top of that?  The Earth is going to be fine.  It has survived long before Humans and will survive long after.		What you want is control.
@sandyhook ...nothing more American than arguing to violate your Fourth Amendment guarantees and deem due process irrelevant in order to disarm you...
Hopefully not scared to answer today, @GovInslee: will honorably discharged veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
So @WaGunResponsib: will honorably discharged Veterans have to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
@NewtownAction @ThisIsOurLane ...a semiautomatic rifle is not a "weapon of war".  The firearm is only a tool.		The person pulling the trigger is the weapon.
@Bradybuzz @ThisIsOurLane ...celebrating the State's increased ability to forcibly disarm individual citizens without due process for thought crime...		...because it has a signature...
@Ocasio2018 Why not bring back the Civilian Conservation Corps and Draft?  @cbrangel
So @GovInslee: will honorably discharged Veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
Just going to ask daily: @WaGunResponsib: will Veterans have to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
Hey, @realDonaldTrump : you know which nationality the 9/11 hijackers were, right?  Referring to the Saudis as an "ally" is a misnomer as bad as "assault rifle".
Groups such as @Everytown and @WaGunResponsib are filled with individuals who won't stop at firearms when using the Masses and State as blunt instruments.	#WeAreAllAlexJones	#DangerousFreedom
@seattletimes ...so will private property owners eventually be expected to remove all Unwanted Individuals using own resources?  E.g. the days of the Pinkerton agency?
@ThisIsOurLane @RambaKy If you are a Veteran propagating the suspension of individual liberties to grant the state more power in order to disarm individual citizens you need to rethink your sworn oaths.
@Everytown ...so Black American children are being taught what at home, exactly...?
@Everytown ...what is the point here?  The firearms aren't shooting of own volition, are they...?
@brownam130 @ThisIsOurLane @NRA Yeah: the firearm didn't get up of its own volition.		Let's ask the question which deserves to be asked: where was the shooter's dad in his life from adolescene to the shooting in the hospital?
Will honorably discharged veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639? @WaGunResponsib
@JenniferWexton @ThisIsOurLane ...so rather than restrict the individual right to arms, why not restrict romantic partnerships...?
@Everytown: Will honorably discharged Veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with WA I-1639?
@WaGunResponsib: Will honorably discharged Veterans be forced to pay for "training" in order to comply with I-1639?
