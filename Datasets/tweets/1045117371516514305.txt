@ellekay I think she has deleted her account and Twitter is sending everyone to you instead
The people of Melbourne have had enough https://t.co/ibOKaTfpKy
It‚Äôs time to legalise weed!		https://t.co/LaTKrEWnN6
If the libs want to win federally, they have to come up with something good. The HSR project CLARA is trying to get started is a good plan. Included are 8 new cities between Melbourne and Sydney. If they dribble on about debt and don‚Äôt give us something good, they‚Äôll suffer
The most compelling argument for a better education system is the people who disregard facts and blindly follow a side in politics. Facts, fairness and common sense go out the window and people who don‚Äôt give a shit about you get to steal off us, tell us lies and dumb people down
@kashmiragander Why would someone ‚Äúhack‚Äù Wikipedia when all they need to do is press the edit button? Your article sounds like fake news
RT @Auspol6: Apart from being around 10x more likely to commit a crime, the Sudanese have been rorting our childcare system and the scale o‚Ä¶
@realDonaldTrump 	Please do it. There are millions of people around the world who have been waiting and hoping this would happen. 	https://t.co/K3kWEBq8M9
@Acosta President Trump made some great points and definitely made the right decision here
#VoteTonyOut
@Acosta Says a lot about how hateful your side is compared to theirs
God you dribble shit https://t.co/RdOVjyiG81
Fake news https://t.co/BYMeIKpLgo
One rule for you, one for everyone else... https://t.co/H60plx8hEm
Hopefully this will teach you to pull your head in https://t.co/11GJPRrj01
@Acosta Stop man handling women you pathetic man baby
You're full of shit. When you push your own flawed agenda and call it news, you are the problem https://t.co/7UThvQgctk
Be a rude cnut, get treated like one. Why are the left so feral and stupid? https://t.co/fZXqzWbBzl
What was our excuse before? The TV? The reality is, most people in western countries can't spell, suck at maths and have a very narrow view of the world. https://t.co/HMV4R1GbNi
When you're having a bad day, just think, it could always be worse. You could be as dumb as this.... https://t.co/WVEtBiBpP4
No aid for countries that support terrorism, kill gay people, execute people for apostasy etc https://t.co/39Wuig1NaO
@AdamBandt That's because your party is a joke and nobody in their right mind would want your party to have any kind of power
The left doesn't care what their own people do. Their side can assault people, rape/sexually assault women and that's ok https://t.co/Sb3uJRi91u
Obama's legacy continues to get worse and worse https://t.co/SDVVF4X6Oa
Not surprising given that the left actively spreads pro hamas (terrorist) propaganda https://t.co/D3bt8JqMjg
You're a moron if you think Acosta handled himself gracefully. You are part of the problem https://t.co/x4ns5bI3A5
Trump is THE MAN https://t.co/o8VxwAvVkh
@KremlinTrolls Acosta is a rude POS and he was shut down because of it. Well done Trump
@JuliaDavisNews Because the reporter is a rude POS
@TeamTrump What a rude POS Jim Acosta is. It's about time that big mouth was brought down a peg or two. Well done president Trump
It IS ok to be white
I heard the KKK and Nazis used the word "yesterday" in a sentence once. Using your lack of logic, you also support them https://t.co/8MIUzJm2vZ
@JasonClareMP What a ridiculous statement. Using your lack of logic, the KKK and Nazis used the word "yesterday" in a sentence once. You also support them
@FoxNews Awesome!
@the_erc How about the attacks that lead to it? Or doesn't that matter?
@JuliaDavisNews @YahooNews The US and South korea have been preparing for a war with North Korea for decades so it is unlikely to have a huge impact on their readiness. Given the relative peace on the Korean peninsula right now, wouldn't it be better to try and keep the peace?
@cher @nytimes I'm not sure how you can blame Trump for debt past administrations have caused
@jdickerson What's most surprising is that US debt is rarely mentioned
@Stanjez @MRowlandMP Our groups focus on facts, fainess and common sense. The issue of ABC's bias is easy to see if you're not a leftist
@CGTNOfficial Israel should declare the idea of a Palestinian state a failed one and take the #shithole over. Billions have been poured into the place and it is still a #shithole
@MRowlandMP It should be sold off. The people shouldn't be paying for an organisation to provide biased news

@BBCWorld Billions of dollars has been poured into that #shithole but it's still a #shithole due to its leaders. A compelling case of colonialism right there
@RitaPanahi @Imamofpeace The place is filled with leftists, no surprise there
@ScottMorrisonMP People are sick of paying for the ABC to feed them left wing crap
