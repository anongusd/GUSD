@MikeFreddoso @ColMorrisDavis No hangun has even one third the muzzle velocity of an M16 or AR 15 which means if victims survive, wounds are more disabling and harder for surgeons to treat.
@MikeFreddoso @ColMorrisDavis and rifles semi and full auto allow perps to more easily outgun and kill  1st responders, "good guys" police etc.
@MikeFreddoso @Mellecon @PollySpin I've heard handguns aren't  much good at less than 50 yds or against someone who is fleeing.
