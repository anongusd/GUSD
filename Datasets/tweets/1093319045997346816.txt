@StefanMolyneux If the minimum wage kept up with inflation and worker productivity it would be at least $22 an hour. No CEO is providing that much value to their company, to justify paying less than a livable wage to is lowest employee.
@StefanMolyneux that workers are doing more work, for far less compensation than they should be getting. Where does that missing compensation go? Right to the fucking top.  Its wage theft on a societal scale, and wealthy to-do assholes likes yourself dont help by pushing false narratives.
@StefanMolyneux That bullshit dude.  The Average CEO makes 361 times the amount of their average worker, in the 50s it was only about 20 times. This insane increase correlates with the stagnation of the minimum wage in comparison to the increase of worker productivity  and inflation. This means
