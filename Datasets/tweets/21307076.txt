3/ Pelosi also notes that Tlaib‚Äôs comments are ‚Äúnot the position of the Democratic caucus‚Äù on impeachment. About the impact of her words: ‚ÄúI think it probably consolidates his (Trump‚Äôs) base, but I don‚Äôt think it needs much consolidation.‚Äù #MSNBCTownHall
2/ Pelosi asks @JoyAnnReid, ‚ÄúLet me ask you this, if she (Rep. Rashida Tlaib) was a man,‚Äù would there be such a flap over her words? She adds, ‚ÄúWhat she said is less offensive than what President Trump said about John McCain.‚Äù #MSNBCTownHall
Pelosi addresses at greater length the comments by Rep. Rashida Tlaib on impeachment. She says it‚Äôs ‚Äúgenerational,‚Äù that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the language.‚Äù But she also says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in the censorship business.‚Äù 1/ #MSNBCTownHall
Nancy Pelosi on what she hopes the legacy of her second tour as Speaker will be: ‚ÄúThat we head on addressed the issue of disparity of income in America...(and) we must address the climate issue.‚Äù #MSNBCTownHall
Nancy Pelosi on whether Rep. Rashida Tlaib‚Äôs controversial call for Trump‚Äôs impeachment ‚Äúhurts the case:‚Äù ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm that our members have helps the case, any case....We try to build our consensus on how we go forward. It doesn‚Äôt hurt the cause when people speak the truth.‚Äù
Asked about impeaching Trump, Pelosi notes Nixon wasn‚Äôt impeached; GOP senators stepped up. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs shameful right now is not just the president‚Äôs behavior,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs shocking is that the Republicans in the Congress of the United States will not hold him accountable.‚Äù
At #MSNBCTownHall, @JoyAnnReid asks Speaker Pelosi: What‚Äôs the threshold that would make it time to impeach President Trump?‚Äù It‚Äôs about the facts and the law, and where that takes you.‚Äù
Nancy Pelosi doesn‚Äôt directly respond when asked about Rep. Rashida Tlaib‚Äôs provocative call for Trump‚Äôs impeachment. Notes some Dems have supported impeachment for 2 years. ‚ÄúThe outrage that people feel about impeachment is legitimate,‚Äù but reiterates her view it‚Äôs premature.

Nancy Pelosi says ‚ÄúMedicare for all is a good idea‚Äù but emphasizes the need to protect the Affordable Care Act and its benefits. #MSNBCTownHall

Not even suspected explosive devices in the mail prompt a ceasefire in American politics. The election of Kavanaugh and the caravan is now one of the suspicious package, too. Here's my take: https://t.co/XxyNsprQTL via @usatoday
By 51-43%, likely voters say they would support the Democratic candidate, not the Republican one, if the election were held today.
