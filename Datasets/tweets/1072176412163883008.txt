@JohnCornyn You misspelled #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpsShutdown
@JohnCornyn You're grasping at straws.  Basically you are acknowledging Trump had his chance and failed. This is the #TrumpsShutdown
@JohnCornyn Nope.  The President broke the deal to keep the govt open.  This is all on him.  #TrumpsShutdown
@LindseyGrahamSC How long will #TrumpShutdown last?
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign because you are not a leader
@hughhewitt @JohnCornyn @chuckschumer Still a #TrumpShutdown

@senatemajldr Propose permanent DACA, protection of Mueller and protection for ACA and maybe you could have a deal.

@realDonaldTrump #TrumpShutdown and while you are at it #TrumpResign
@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump is a coward and incapable of empathy
@LindseyGrahamSC The most tragic part of the  president's whimsy is that 1000's could die for his short-sighted view.
@SenSchumer Please don't give in to Trump's extortion.  Congress should decide how money is spent not a tantrum throwing @realDonaldTrump . #TrumpShutdown
@HoarseWisperer I love your responses.  MAGA's are so easy to trigger.  Happy Holidays
@Aglw1956F @gregorymeise @realDonaldTrump USMCA has to be ratified by Congress.  That has not happened yet.

@JohnCornyn Can you address the issue of children being held in effective jails because of our bad policies for managing refugees
@GeorgePapa19 Who would want a known felon who lies as a Congressman?
@LindseyGrahamSC Mick already has 2 jobs (budget director and consumer affairs) amazing that he can pull off a third...maybe this is just window dressing.

@jammy33 @SandraR71947960 @senatemajldr @POTUS Perhaps you need to look closer at our presidents associates.  Flynn, Cohen, Manafort, Papadopoulos have all admitted to being liars, and some have conspired to commit fraud against our country.  Mueller who served our country in Vietnam and as FBI director is not the bad guy
@Jo12538172 @senatemajldr @POTUS https://t.co/o58Et85015
@JohnCornyn Flynn knew better and he lied, and then tried to cover up.  His dishonesty landed him in court, not any trick by the FBI.  Shame on you for promoting this false narrative.
@RepJimCosta Shame on you for refusing a vote on Yemen.

@MerriamWebster Kleptocracy
@WhiteHouse This is partisan crap.  Shame  on you all.  Just give us the facts not Republican commentary.
@Reuters @pdacosta Maybe your headline should indicate that his claim is false...again
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Who is going to pay for the wall?  Should we really extend credit to Mexico like that?  Or just keep pretending?
@BradMossEsq @foxandfriends Jesse Watters is the worst.  He is ignorant and arrogant.  A reasonable person like Jaun Williams cannot expect anything different from him.
@Ocasio2018 Keep moving forward.
@WhiteHouse Is there a wall?  There were fence repairs and concertina wire added, but no wall.  You cannot fool all of us.
@shannonrwatts That's our girl!  She's got this

@WhiteHouse It still shocks me that taxpayer money is used so you can lie to everyone.  These drops occurred without the "wall"
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump is having a tantrum.  If you can get House to vote for wall then do that.
