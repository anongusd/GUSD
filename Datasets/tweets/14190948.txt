"...with similar economic status live in dramatically different residential environments with blacks living in areas with higher crime rates, poor quality schools, higher poverty rates, lower property values, and severe racial segregation."
Just as startling is this:		"About half of middle- and upper-income blacks were raised in neighborhoods with at least 20 percent poverty, compared to 1 percent of whites. This finding is consistent with extensive research demonstrating that blacks and whites..."
"Even today, 31 percent of African American children live in neighborhoods where the poverty rate is 30 percent or greater, a level of poverty that is unknown among white children."
one of the findings that still sticks with me is from patrick sharkey's stuck in place, where he shows that fewer than 10 percent of black children born since 1955 have lived in a neighborhood less than 10 percent poor https://t.co/g0lwQUgOZM

@tressiemcphd me picking up my AP test scores from the school office and the person at the desk being visibly surprised at how well i did
madison, my EXTREMELY problematic fave
james madison, to his credit, favored popular election of the president.
and the "small state" mythology is basically taking Southern complaints of being "out voted" at face value. but none of the southern states were especially small: virginia, north carolina, and south carolina were all pretty big! they just had large enslaved populations.
reading convention debates about the method of election for the president and it is striking how several of the delegates are straight up like "yeah we can't do popular election because we got too many slaves who can't vote"
sitting in the gym lounge (this is a fancy gym) doing work and listening to people sing the praises of elon musk
but having said that, the idea is neither as complicated or as unreasonable as critics like these make it out to be. the federal government committed or facilitated a series of crimes against its citizens, and the descendants of those citizens want a reckoning of some sort.
i'm not even sure that "reparations" as a set of payments or whatever is even a good idea. i think the value is in the united states government taking a full accounting of its role in creating and entrenching a racial caste system. and that, in turn, will inform policy-making.
@cjane87 "the editors"
i know this is national review but they could probably do better than this
just 10 percent of the black population of the united states is foreign-born and critically their children do not escape the racial caste dynamics of american society’ https://t.co/wiw3mXxtON https://t.co/LCpbgaTemS
and as always "slavery was a long time ago" both ignores the (again) continuous nature of the US government and is basically a claim that any crime, no matter how large and monstrous, is excusable once a sufficient time passes, in this case, two consecutive human lifetimes.
again, reparations are a claim against the (continuously existing) united states government which facilitated and benefited from slavery and the slave trade. also, slavery created and entrenched racial caste which constitutes an ongoing offense against a class of people https://t.co/DTZ7U7XIk9
@cjane87 who wrote this trash?

@notdred @jesseltaylor @grisuy The other thing about Doom is his pathological arrogance isn't neediness.

"...and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good."
A little later Hamilton adds this:		"If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority..."
"Sophistry may reply that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common sense."
"Its operation contradicts that fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail."
"The right of equal suffrage among the States is another exceptionable part of the Confederation. Every idea of proportion and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a principle, which gives to Rhode Island an equal weight in the scale of power with Massachusetts."

@realajoster yeah, you can’t fully explain housing markets with econ 101 logic because housing (and land) are very different goods than say, TVs. but yeah, broadly speaking, sharply limiting the possible supply of housing will lead to increased prices if there is demand
i guess, in fairness, you would make 72-inch OLEDs more available, but televisions as a broad class would become unattainable for most people, and it is a similar thing with single family housing and places like chevy chase
no one would accept this logic in any other context. “we’ll make televisions more affordable by outlawing everything but 72-inch OLEDs”

abraham lincoln is the perfect example. here is a dude who was a ruthlessly ambitious political operator who we remember as a humble country lawyer
the truth of this is evident in how we evaluate past politicians. the extent to which we deem them “authentic” or not is the extent to which we hold them in esteem and thus accept their mythmakinf as truth.
applied to politicians, words like “inauthentic” and “opportunistic” are just contrived ways of saying “i don’t like this person”

The height of blackface's popularity in the North was the 1840s and 1850s. the politics of anti-slavery, and the civil war, had a big effect on white northern attitudes about that kind of racial mockery, although that effect faded by the 1870s and 80s.

so, to repeat the original point, it is really important to understand racism as a pleasure-seeking activity as well as a expression of contempt or hatred.
@BrandyLJensen people love to dump on the American South in general!
This is still part of why blackface continues to appeal to people. It allows whites who engage in it to inhabit a body they imagine as "freer" and more animalistic, giving them license to indulge themselves.
"Beyond simple mockery, the pleasure of blackface for white performers and their audiences lay in the vicarious experience of an imagined blackness — a wild, preindustrial “savage” nature that whites attributed to black Americans."

@chappiesinclair i think that someone who attempts to kill a random black person in retaliation for the assault of a white woman by a different black person in an effort to inflict violence on the community is attempting a lynching, even if it isn’t with a rope, even if there isn’t a mob

@chappiesinclair and i’m not parsing this. i have a broad definition of lynching, you are the one who has excluded everything but a mob using a rope, which as i said, would exclude hundreds of documented lynchings.
@chappiesinclair no, emmett till was killed by two men, who kidnapped him from his uncle’s home. you cannot come here, make a dispute, and then not even have the facts right
@chappiesinclair “nearly exclusively by hanging” is just false and would exclude hundreds of cases documented as lynchings.
@chappiesinclair well, i have done a lot of reading about lynching and spent a lot of time going through documented accounts of lynching, and you are mistaken. by your definition, emmett till was not lynched, for example.
@chappiesinclair lynching is defined by the social context of the violence not the method of killing

@GeeDee215 he'll leave these people for the police to the extent that he thinks it's important just to get them off the street, although he is aware of how fraught this is. he tries to justify it to himself by way of his philanthropy aimed at giving kids opportunities.
@GeeDee215 have been thinking about this and i think the way to square the circle is that black Batman is less concerned with "crime" then he is with "victimization." he doesn't care about corner boys or even petty thieves, he does care about violent criminals (and violent cops)

@GeeDee215 it opens up so many avenues for storytelling!
to add to this real quick, someone had the idea of making Joe Chill a cop and i think that is perfect. nothing changes about the death of batman’s parents scene, but the implications are vastly different.

others may be the same, but the dynamic vis a vis the city and the police is more akin to what you see in spider-man: authorities would happily kill batman and the joker if they could.

as i write this out i realize i'm basically adapting big parts of Walker's Nighthawk into a proper Batman story, which is to say, again, read Walker's Nighthawk
@mattBernius big fan and it's an inspiration for this
he still playacts at being a billionaire playboy, but he's also a philanthropist and something of a celebrity. hangs out with actors, with gotham's professional athletes, etc. https://t.co/BT44lCRx3f
batman becomes a number one target for the cops, a target for organized crime, something of a folk hero for black gotham, and highly controversial—even hated and disdained—among white gothamites.
...his targets are crime and police brutality. he becomes a problem for the cops and the world of organized criminality, making himself an enemy of both. jim gordon still exists in this world, but he's one of the few black people in the GCPD and is sympathetic.
when he returns, he decides to take a different path than his parents. he's abandoned uplift in favor of a more crusading spirit. he's more public facing. white and black Gothamites know who the waynes are now. and when he finally enters the fray as batman...
he doesn't go to the HBCU, forsaking his family's legacy at the school. he instead travels abroad, learning the skills he needs to be batman, and also trying to experience life free of American racism. (borrowing from Douglass and DuBois here).
bruce comes away from this experience with two emotions: grief at his parents' death, anger at crime, and rage at the police. as he gets older (and here we are borrowing from the tradition of black autobiography), this becomes a fierce, righteous anger at racism.
it isn't until they realize who the victims were—and again, the waynes may be well-known in black gotham but far less so in white gotham—that grasp the magnitude of what happened. by this point though, it's too late and the killer is never caught.
when the call comes in that two people were shot and killed, the police...shrug. they take their time. they're indifferent to bruce. alfred is there (and, what the hell, he's still michael caine), and they ask him if he was assaulted.
now, the origin of batman. the situation is the same. the killer is still a man named "joe chill." it still takes place in "crime alley" after the wayne family—with like an 11-year-old bruce—see a play or movie. the difference is all of this happens in black, segregated Gotham.
(this vision of gotham will be a bit inspired by DC, so it will have a well-known HBCU for which the wayne family is a major benefactor)
thomas and martha wayne take this seriously. while lucius fox runs wayne enterprises—a obscure but wealthy and profitable conglomerate—bruce's parents work as philanthropists, devoted to the black community of gotham, which is still segregated and disadvantaged.
the wayne family isn't reclusive, but it shies away from public life and only interacts with white society when necessary. if it has a guiding creed or belief system, it's a booker t. washington-style uplift ideology.
the wayne family can still be old money: they are descendants of prosperous free northern blacks who arrived carved out a place for themselves in gotham, which for our purposes is a chicago stand-in.
first, here's why i think this is necessary: you could just racebend batman and be done with it, but i think there's a real opportunity in reimagining the character as a black American, and how race shapes his background and the circumstances of his vigilante career.
so as soon as i said you would have to rewrite batman to be black i started thinking about how i would do it. here's what i have.
having said that, if you are not worried about the worldbuilding and just looking for a great actor, Kaluuya is the one. i think he could do the Michael Keaton thing of communicating so much about the character with just his eyes
Walker’s sadly brief Nighthawk run is honestly one of the most audacious comics I have ever read
batman is the one character you would have to completely rewrite to make black, since his background depends on him being an old money Rockefeller Republican type.		better idea: Daniel Kaluuya in an adaptation of David Walker’s Nighthawk. https://t.co/6rAgG7u3hx

senators! the filibuster is an extra-constitutional burden. get rid of it! you only have your chains to lose!
“but republicans will be able to repeal democratic policies”		republicans had a trifecta for 2 years and couldn’t repeal the signature policy of the last president. successful programs create constituencies that then defend them
what’s more, the design of the senate itself—a small chamber with six year terms—produces deliberation and discussion. the filibuster is superfluous for that purpose
“but the filibuster encourages bipartisanship”		in a low partisanship/low polarization environment, the filibuster is not needed to create cross-party coalitions. and in the reverse, it distorts the process itself, forcing majorities into contortions to achieve agenda items
gah. reluctance to kill the filibuster is pure status quo bias. if the filibuster never existed, no one would propose it. https://t.co/mxbIL29rXG

@ethantate @MaggieEThornton @socialistdogmom What I am also curious about is, if Charlottesville becomes inhospitable for young people and young families, how is the city supposed to sustain itself?
@ethantate @MaggieEThornton @socialistdogmom i don’t own a home but if i did, i would be fine with a significant reduction in the rate of growth in home value
@MaggieEThornton @ethantate @socialistdogmom If I am being uncharitable, it is affluent white people who have decided Charlottesville belongs to them.
@ethantate @MaggieEThornton @socialistdogmom I have spoken to people whose response to “it is becoming unaffordable for all but the affluent” is “well it has always been expensive so that’s just how it is.” It’s maddening.
i kind of think you should watch both the hulu and netflix fyre festival documentaries. the former is kind of a thematic look at influencer culture, the latter a more in-depth look at the planning or lack thereof. both do a good job of showing the founder as a scammer.
@ethantate @MaggieEThornton @socialistdogmom “We cannot build more housing because it may overwhelm existing infrastructure” suggests that a) we have reached carrying capacity with the housing we have and b) additional housing is a kind of luxury that we should forgo if we can’t “pay” for it. neither is true.

@mttsimon basically
An excerpt https://t.co/4dUNwHoeEo
For example, this piece quotes from the speech “Where Do We Go From Here” but in King’s book of the same title, he has an extended and sympathetic analysis of the Black Power movement. Any read of that speech should be in dialogue with the analysis.
Piece has all the hallmarks of someone who doesn’t have a holistic understanding of King’s work as much as he worked backwards from a conclusion.

@ClipperCitizen my big idea for the start is making cassian a partner in crime who, working as a rebel spy, “betrays” her to the rebellion by orchestrating an arrest and capture. the character arc of the movie becomes the two learning to trust each other again.
@ronmexicoisreal oh really?
this gets to my overarching problem with the Star Wars stories. they are ironically *too* concerned with connecting to the larger mythos/continuity, and are constrained by the need to establish those links.
basically, one planet per act with the rebel base as our transition point, more time establishing Erso as a rebellious personality and reworking the “capture/rescue” situation that connects her to rebellion
my three big ideas for how to make ROGUE ONE better is spend much more time with Jyn Erso at the start, spend more time on the desert planet/fold the “rescue the dad” sequence in as the climax of the desert planet, and leave the third act more or less unchanged https://t.co/Ho1OzCwp2b
but as i think about it the story and character beats aren’t actually that bad. what this needs, like i said before, is to be reedited and cut down.
i know i just said OCEANS 11 as the model but if i were writing this i would have turned to THE STING as my guide
but really, save the han solo origin stuff for the companion comics or novelizations. we, the audience, already know who Han is. so just give us a fun Han Solo adventure
i will say it shows less evidence of being sliced and diced to hell than ROGUE ONE
you could probably cut this movie down to 105 minutes and it would be all the better for it
i would drop the first 25 minutes, start with the train robbery, and use brief flashbacks to fill in any necessary information. move the plot along as fast as possible to get to Lando, and then set the film up as an Oceans 11-style heist with Han &amp; Lando as our leads
so i am halfway through this movie—had to pause to help the baby get to sleep!—and i think its big weakness is the apparent mandate to explain everything.

My last thought here is that while it’s fun to play the “how many people hold racist views” game the actual problem of racism isn’t the personal beliefs of individual Americans but a political economy that uses race hierarchy to determine &amp; distribute wealth, opportunity, &amp; life.
Anyway I have been told that this is a “banal” take so you’ll forgive me if this is all very boring.
When you understand racism/white supremacy as an existential threat—which is what it is—then tolerance of white supremacy and its legacies looks very different than if you simply see racism as a kind of extreme incivility.

Something like a quarter of American adults hold explicitly racist views so 42 percent really isn’t a stretch. https://t.co/eeUpMAkLuJ
Of course, racism isn’t that—it’s a violent and eliminationist ideology and its expression in Red Dead Online reflects this, with players using the game’s freedom to attack and kill black characters, not just insult them.
Gamers and game developers, like much of the larger public, understand racism as a type of “impolitic behavior.” And if racism is just an extreme form of being an asshole, what reason is there to regulate it?
Then there’s the larger problem of the industry itself, which doesn’t see racism as a problem to address. https://t.co/rhz164UeRT

the president of the united states is an open racist trying to strengthen and reify race hierarchy so you’ll forgive me if i think an analysis of racism in american life is especially pressing right now
the real questions are “what constitutes racism” and “what is its relationship to our political economy” but to the conversation at hand i will note that your “decrying racism is banal” take comes as steve king is finally chastized by his party after 15 years of open racism https://t.co/4suZrnvpfP

I’m sorry that my “racism is bad” and “political parties shouldn’t tolerate or support racists” views aren’t fresh, interesting, or heterodox enough for you. Perhaps you want to try Stormfront instead? https://t.co/SRJZx01AJT
And that same principle is why the action against King isn’t prompting any criticism of the president—Trump hasn’t said “I love to do a racism” so he’s all clear.
The main lesson of Steve King for other congressional Republicans is that as long as you don’t say “Racism is actually good” you can say all kinds of racist stuff and remain a member in good standing.

my verdict on VENOM		the bad:		the pacing	the plot	the action setpieces	most of the CGI	michelle williams’ wig		the good:		tom hardy’s performance and every single scene involving him and Venom. seriously worth watching for that alone.
this entire movie is like a throwback to 1990s blockbusters and the pre-Sam Raimi Spider-Man era of superhero movies, right down to Eminem’s (bonkers) credits song explaining the plot of the film
what a genuinely insane performance
I DIDN’T KNOW TOM HARDY DID VENOM’S VOICE TOO AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE EVEN MORE
anyway swear words are not a big deal and Trump isn’t a problem because he’s a naughty boy he’s a problem because he is the vector for plutocracy and white supremacism

Or, to put that in the negative, I don't think it's a coincidence that America's democratic backsliding coincides with resegregation and retrenchment of civil and voting rights gains for black Americans.
You don't have to be a Marxist-Leninist (I'm certainly not) to see and think through the argument that broader social and democratic reform in the United States is tied to the fate of black Americans, especially those in the South.
"...in their fight against the imperialist exploiters	and war-makers. The Negro people themselves are demonstrating the qualities of a decisive democratic force in American life."
here's the passage: "The unsolved Negro question is a focal point of vulnerability of American imperialism. It is therefore a most vital part of concentration for attack by the working class and the masses of democratic Americans..."
this is all apropos of a passage in Harry Haywood's 1948 volume "Negro Liberation," where Haywood—a black leader in the Communist Party of the USA—makes an impassioned case for the national liberation of black peoples in the Black Belt of the United States.
i think you can generalize that point: the black struggle for democratic equality has, historically, been a key driver of larger political and social gains.
a while back @fivefifths made the astute point that the passage of Medicaid and Medicare was intimately tied to the democratic struggles of the 1960s—the fight for black civil rights and universal health care were part of the same struggle https://t.co/ROzKlTwLSD

@jlindleywilson recommended reading on this?
just a thought
democracy at the workplace as well as the ballot box. democracy as a way of relating to each other as equal citizens deserving of dignity.
one of the reasons i think “the new deal” has gained traction as a progressive lodestar isn’t just because it stands for expansive social policy but because it holds out the possibility of reinvigorating democracy of the deep sort—
i think you can argue that one of the ills of america in the present moment is the profound absence of democracy from much of everyday life. of the ability of ordinary people to have real control over the larger forces that shape their life.
the logic of these movements is that democracy is a way of life that must be manifested and bolstered throughout society, lest it is overcome by the forces of modern society: financial capitalism, industrial organization, etc.
inspired a great deal by @lionel_trolling i have been thinking a lot about america in the late 19th century and in particular the expansive visions of democratic life that you see from the Populists, the early socialists, and the progressives

@rortybomb @squarelyrooted my sense is that the new deal push for mass (white) homeownership is basically an attempt to square the circle here, to make american capitalism more compatible with republican citizenship by making wage work a viable path to owning property
@rortybomb @squarelyrooted and what i see from warren and sanders is basically a resurrection of that idea, in its debsian formulation: that american democracy is populated by citizens (versus consumers or proletarians) and its economic system must be in harmony with the values of republican citizenship
@rortybomb @squarelyrooted hmm. i think the truly radical elements of the Populist and Debsian critiques—that american capitalism is in tension with, and possibly incompatible with, the social and republican basis of american democracy—weren't fully synthesized
fascinating argument here that, constitutionally, the present structure of the Senate is in tension with the logic of the voting rights amendments—14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, &amp; 26th—and that congress could resolve this by changing how the Senate is apportioned https://t.co/oYdDSY0KXR
@squarelyrooted i've been playing around with how they both embody different aspects of the "home grown" American critique of industrial capitalism that gains strength in the 1890s. warren borrowing from the Populists and sanders from Debs and his followers.
@Melanism @ParkerMolloy it was an insane idea executed almost perfectly
glad to see democrats fighting it out over their domestic policy visions but the nation's challenges are also international and i hope to see similar discussions &amp; arguments around foreign policy. from my view, sanders and warren are, so far, the only two with a real vision here.

@fivefifths there are a lot of reasons for it but i think two big ones are the underrepresentation of women in high-level policymaking and the underrepresentation of young parents in politics
@fivefifths working families up and down the income scale need as much help with early child care as they do with higher education. both should be universal.

@minaisen but i will say that the evidence of white identity being dispositive for this particular cohort of trump voters is very strong
@minaisen that might be true but no one has tried to survey voters on those questions or do any sustainrd research related to it, so, for me at least, i can’t really say either way
biden was a vocally pro-drug war/incarceration democrat https://t.co/NgEXZ0SOM2
The dynamic described in this is probably the biggest problem for Joe Biden, given his abysmal record.
@minaisen Irrespective of the substance of her rhetoric, voters perceived vast differences of opinion on race btwn her snd Trump. Clinton did not lose exclusively because of that dynamic, but it—in addition to other missteps, mistakes, and errors—is a critical part of the story.
@minaisen The argument is that the 2016 election was polarized around the racial views of white voters, such that “racially conservative” Democrats bolted for the GOP. That racial polarization was supercharged by Trump, but Clinton also couldn’t avoid the dynamic.
@minaisen That isn’t quite what I‘m arguing.

@surlyurbanist i think it is a strange movie, structure wise. it’s an irish political thriller where chan exists almost as this force of nature almost disconnected from the main plot
@jonathanchait anti-black attitudes/symbolic racism is a distinct phenomenon, i think, from what you might call “explicit” or “old fashionrd” racism, to say nothing of open advocacy of white hegemony
@surlyurbanist it’s pretty good!
watching this controversy over boycotts play out my only thought is how the objection depends on classifying racism/white nationalism/white supremacy as just another category of political speech rather than something qualitatively different, and more dangerous, given our history.

If instead of asking “do you want the country to become more politically correct” you asked “do you want Americans to address each other in respectful ways” or “do you think Americans should be more attuned to each other’s dignity,” you’d have a different answer!

@PompeyMalus right. it's one thing to have a little finishing salt. but if your cooked food requires salting to attain any flavor, something has gone wrong in the cooking process.

This chapter, The White Worker, should be read along with DuBois' "The Souls of White Folks" where he makes an argument about capitalism *as a racial system* inseparable from and dependent on the creation and exploitation of imagined difference ("racial capitalism"). https://t.co/KyVEMlCMNT
DuBois' Black Reconstruction is also useful here. Free and freed blacks moving North (and West) threatened to undermine an emerging white "labor aristocracy" that escaped proletarianization and thus the precarity of industrial capitalism. https://t.co/V03lZYyQzy
one last thought: the extent to which enslaved africans were a large class of skilled and unskilled labor is critical to understanding the emergence of virulent anti-black racism among northern white workers. this on the 1864 NYC draft riots is helpful https://t.co/1VoP8bw11R
anyway, the common belief that slavery would have died out sans the war is probably wrong. if anything, we're probably lucky the war happened when it did
not that difficult to spin out a scenario where the slave south attracts investment geared toward industralizing the plantation system

@DavidKlion @ConnorSouthard @BobbyBigWheel @OsitaNwanevu eh, i don't think that's really the case. i think the degree to which he is *now* an outsider is overstated. i think "hated by party elites" begs the question of "who are party elites," and i think the particular dynamics of GOP '16 are not present in Dem '20
@ConnorSouthard @BobbyBigWheel @DavidKlion @OsitaNwanevu In all seriousness I think he's in a position similar to Hillary '08. A frontrunner with a clear, but far from guaranteed, path to winning.
@ehnottooxabi @DavidKlion @InternetR0bot @OsitaNwanevu Eh, I'd say Beto is more a competitor for groups 2 and 3.
@DavidKlion @InternetR0bot @OsitaNwanevu if i were advising him, in fact, i would say he should declare in january and immediately move to box out as many competitors for weak democrats and independents as he can.
@DavidKlion @InternetR0bot @OsitaNwanevu if he can knock out competitors for those groups, i think he stands a good chance of winning. but if he has to compete, it gets dicey.
@DavidKlion @InternetR0bot @OsitaNwanevu the democratic primary electorate is comprised of basically three big groups:		1. strong democrats (largest group at around 54%)	2. weak democrats (next largest group)	3. independents leaning democrat (smallest group)		the question for sanders is "who divides groups 2 and 3"
@InternetR0bot @DavidKlion @OsitaNwanevu it's not? most evidence from 2016 is that the ideological differences between bernie and clinton voters were narrow. the salient divides were around identity, specifically age and party identificaiton. https://t.co/7LkvrM9pxv
@TopherTBrennan @DavidKlion @OsitaNwanevu Warren, if she declares, will not survive past New Hampshire.
@DavidKlion @OsitaNwanevu i think the winnowing is going to be very aggressive! i also think there are many unanswered questions about all of the candidates. for bernie, the unanswered question is: "to what extent was his 2016 performance *dependent* on having hillary clinton as an opponent?"
@DavidKlion @OsitaNwanevu generally i think the 2016 primary has created a skewed, overly binary understanding of intra-party dynamics. there is more than one establishment and voters fall into more categories than "insider/outsider"
@DavidKlion @OsitaNwanevu 1) resource constraints will significantly winnow the field by iowa		2) elite and public opinion will do the same		3) there is no "party establishment" there are multiple establishments and most of the candidates who survive past iowa will be broadly acceptable to most of them

make congress great again, my friends
the presidency is important but given the expansive authority the constitution delegates to congress, the legislature is the real prize. and progressives seeking social democratic reforms should want an active, competent, and confident congressional majority
democrats should especially take this seriously because the best defense against a conservative SCOTUS is an active Congress flexing its constitutional authority, and that will require a Senate majority

You see that here, where “Madison and Milwaukee” are clear stand-ins for “white liberals” and “blacks,” whose votes are of questionable legitimacy, if not outright illegitimate. https://t.co/INSIk0KOFw
But I also think it is informed by a kind of identity politics: The belief that the opposing coalition—consisting of white liberals, blacks, and other nonwhites—is fundamentally illegitimate, and that power rightfully belongs to rural, conservative whites.
An additional thought: Some of this is just a naked drive for partisan advantage, and some of it reflects self-awareness that pro-corporate austerity politics is unpopular and can only be preserved by counter-majoritarian action.

@mikeduncan Give me a weaker presidency and a stronger Congress, including more lenient norms around holding executive office holders accountable through use of censuring and impeachment, and I could give up presidential term limits.
@mikeduncan I go back and forth on this. On one hand I object to rules that prevent voters from being able to choose their representation. On the other hand, the combination of an imperial presidency and a weak Congress means presidential term limits are necessary.

@bentwhee yes, as the black journalist whose subject matter expertise is race and democracy, this is “the hill i am going to die on”

@Campylodiscus or is your view that it is rude to say you dislike a food in a conversation about foods you like or dislike

@Campylodiscus I didn’t tell anyone they were gross.
@CryptTrash Or is your view that unless I enthusiastically enjoy canned tuna, I am classist?
@CryptTrash It is a perfectly fair comparison given how I expressed a preference for a very particular type of food. I didn’t say, “I think canned food is gross” or “I think cheap food is gross.” I said “I do not like this particular thing.” The reasons are due to smell, texture, and taste.
@CryptTrash I’m not making fun of anything. I am expressing my preference. I don’t like foie gras either. I think it is gross. Am I making fun of it too?

Even among respectable Republicans, there appears to be an implicit acknowledgment that the party depends on a restricted electorate for its political success and a willingness to tolerate whatever steps necessary to make that happen.
It’s not just that there’s no mainstream Republican opposition to attacks on the voting rights of black (and other nonwhite) Americans: you would be hard pressed to find a conservative writer or columnist who voices any concern for attacks on voting rights.
Just this year, Tim Scott has had to join Democrats to block confirmation of *two separate* conservative lawyers who were either indifferent or hostile to the civil rights of black Americans. Nearly all of his GOP colleagues were prepared to put them on the federal bench.

@StillCrankyAF @cjane87 What you want to believe about this country and what is true appear to be two different things.
@StillCrankyAF @cjane87 I mean, you can disagree with whatever you want but there’s a well-documented history here.  Read about the history of gun ownership in colonial America or about its history in the antebellum South or about the highly contested history of black gun ownership after the Civil War.
@cjane87 @boyfromsi I come from a family of gun owners and sportsmen! I’m far from hostile to gun ownership.
@cjane87 @boyfromsi It is so incredibly interesting that these folks are reading that statement as someone meaning black people should give up the right to own guns.
@cjane87 @StillCrankyAF Right. The claim isn’t that blacks and other nonwhites can’t own and use guns, it’s that the full scope of what American gun ownership entails—the ability to be a “good guy with a gun” and have that recognized—is unavailable in practice to those groups.

@BrandyLJensen @ryanlcooper hah. watched that about five years for the first time since i was a kid and was genuinely horrified by what kevin does to those men
@SWGoldman @attackerman yep! my local butcher sells smoked turkey necks that we use on the regular for bean soups
@SWGoldman @attackerman i think that's right. if you're cooking turkey according to the properties of the bird, you're treating it like you would any tough cut of meat
@ryanlcooper @HeerJeet but does Dirty Harry torture or does he just murder people straight up? same with Death Wish?
@GeeDee215 this is true of all meats though! chicken isn't just good, you have to make it good. i've eat some trash beef and pork too!
@JamilaRobinson @GeeDee215 i think a wet brine is a waste of time but a dry brine is totally worth it
@ryanlcooper it would have to be a cop film of some kind. maybe one of the 80s reagan action films?
i love gene but he is wrong on turkey. turkey tastes fine the problem is it's the bird least conducive to roasting whole https://t.co/dAuZsen3ih

@SeanMcElwee likewise, "who do they listen to," "what incentives are they responding to," "who do they understand as their constituencies," "what are their instincts about politics and policy," etc.
@SeanMcElwee and this ignores how the content of an ideological position isn't static—today's moderate democrats are well to the left of yesterday's blue dogs—or how its the ideological shape of the coalition that matters more for governance than that of the politician in question
@SeanMcElwee exactly. to the extent that they do, voters process "ideology" in terms of affect and style and approach, which is influenced by how the candidates are covered and how the issues are framed.

Be Smart: Public opinion isn't static and while there was evidence of anti-immigration attitudes among black Americans at the beginning of the decade, subsequent developments in national politics have changed the landscape.
basically, there is no black analogue for the hardline anti-immigration politics you see among whites, which is likely a function of partisanship, political identity, and a kind of linked fate ("if they go after them they'll come after us eventually")
and as i understand it these days, findings of negative attitudes themselves are contested, and in terms of practical politics, black Americans are more likely to ally with Hispanic groups, including advocates for immigrants, than the reverse
the "can be" in this is doing a lot of heavy lifting and i need people who make this claim to contend with the fact that negative attitudes towards immigration among some blacks have not yielded any support for anti-immigration politicians or even restrictionism https://t.co/RPn9hl7BPP

to repeat a point i have made many times before, there’s never been a serious consensus that racism is bad. rather, it’s been that “openly expressing racist views is impolite.” with national leadership celebrating that expression however, the norm is eroding. https://t.co/sW8MW3cIMk
