@realDonaldTrump STOP felon!  President Obama did not mean to build a useless wall!  Always looking to the past...right traitor?
@BlkSantaX Wait.  What?
@realDonaldTrump So American voters wonder what you will campaign on for 2020?  You and Putin, and the corrupt @GOP Congress have already destroyed the Worlds confidence in Our Country, and have filled your pockets with taxpayer money.  Maybe Northern Border Wall?  @GOP pick a new leader.
@realDonaldTrump Wondering if there is also a manhunt for the Border Patrol members who killed two refugee kids this month, while they were in U.S.A?  I guess not.

@washingtonpost Trump agrees?  He had no choice.  The entire family is caught up in their scam.  Disgraceful use of a Foundation.  üá∫üá∏
@NancyPelosi  Americans expect you to lead the fight to return ethics and Democratic principals to Our Country.  If there is money available, use it on Healthcare, and DACA.  Not one penny should go to build a useless wall.
@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry...did you say something?  I was following a factual thread on your Tax Evasion.
@CBSNews @PressSec  Sarah...pretty hard to do a briefing when all you have are lies.  You don't even let media ask questions most of the time.  Walking out...is so Trump.  Americans expect the truth.
IMAGINE:  Some seniors, must choose between medication and food! Shameful way to reward citizens for diligently working to make America a World Leader. https://t.co/ZjhHq4KQtB
@politicususa Bravo MSNBC!  Also, don't attend the so called briefings when they blow the whistle.  Sarah simply spews the Trump hate.
@Charles_Lister @DionNissenbaum @WSJ So, Trump is repaying Putin for his help in gaining the Oval Office?  Disgusting.  After all of the civilian lives lost to Assad and Putin...Trump hands the remaining patriots to the executioners.  Crimes against humanity?
@cnni @realDonaldTrump  what a fitting honor!
@CNNnewsroom OK...so what has changed?  Why the urgency to withdraw now?

@JSavoly Hello...@GOP before Trump wastes money on another campaign...show him the off ramp.
@JSavoly Maybe it's just my bias...but why is Flynn likely to get off without prison time?  He betrayed America, and worked as an agent of Turkey, for $$$.  I don't care how he cooperated, He needs to experience the same justice WE would feel for a similar set of crimes.
@PhilipRucker TRUMP:  Looks like all of my work is done for today.  Time to watch cable.

@realDonaldTrump I guess if Russia news doubts something...it has to be true, right traitor?  Americans are just now starting the see the evidence of your crimes against Our Country.

@realDonaldTrump FROM TENNESSEE:  Get used to the orange traitor!
@SDISBEAUTIFUL1 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a pig!  I was so angry when I saw this video.  I definitely would not have remained calm if I attended.  The racist, sexist, orange traitor, knows his days are numbered.  üá∫üá∏
@BlkSantaX Blk...sad...but I gave up trying to interpret the rantings of a racist, sexist, maniac.  Trump just needs to go...5 weeks.
@GOP Wow...such support for Kavanaugh!  Wondering how does the rest of America feel?  Not so good.  Lies are not tolerated for a Judge.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Nice Try!  Hope you have plans for a career change?
@GOP STOP!  Your days of deceit and greed are almost over.  YOU authorized the FBI inquiry...so let the pros do their jobs!  üá∫üá∏

@GOP Save your money.  The GOP will not exist by then.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump Guess Americans missed your promise to contantly attack females all over the country. The @GOP will be voted out, for enabling your sexist behavior.

@SDISBEAUTIFUL1 @GOP @SenFeinstein The entire hearing was planned in advance.  From Kavanaugh's tears, anger, and deception...to Graham's rant and interruption.  The only legitimate questioning and testimony was from the Democratic Senators, and the victim...Dr. Ford.  Sad day.

@GOP @BrettKavanaugh  crying, gulping water, attacking the victim, attacking Democrats, refusing to answers questions about an FBI investigation are not traits WE want to see in a SC judge.  üá∫üá∏

@benjaminwittes Ben...keeping calm...getting harder with each passing Trump tweet.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Ah yes, reminds me of the nomination process for Merrick Garland...doesn't it Lindsey?
@GOP @BrettKavanaugh  still standing with your lies?  Now three accusers and counting.  Withdraw your name!
@Acosta @JaySekulow  when do Americans get a time out from Trump's hate?
@Newsweek WE know...it's called opioid abuse.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Ronna...too late to start caring about the Hispanic population now.  Should have thought about that before Trump started kidnapping children.
@frazmandemo If Mueller is going to act...he may not have any time left. What happens after the first domino falls?
@SenatorLeahy @CHHolte Senator...I pray there are still Americans who will fight to protect Our Demcracy, regardless of the day of the week.  üá∫üá∏

TRUMPSPEAK:  I'll take one Rosenstein, in exchange for one Kavanaugh.  @realDonaldTrump  when Rod walks...he brings evidence of your crimes with him.  Recordings?  Documents?  Bob?
@soledadobrien @JSavoly @mschlapp  what planet do you live on?  Does the name Merrick Garland come to mind?
WONDERING:  When will WE see Trump's Executive Order nullifying this document?  NEVER! https://t.co/gNzjPfCrrc
@realDonaldTrump  WARNING:  You fire Rosenstein...Americans fire you, with or without an election.  Want to unite all Americans against you...threaten Our Freedoms and Rule of Law!
@JRubinBlogger Probably Kelly?  It;s time for Bob Mueller to raise the stakes, before Putin arrives in D.C.
@CNN @MSNBC  Let's be clear...Rosenstein is not resigning.  Why would he?  It's simply Trump moving to plan B, after witnessing his Get Out Of Jail Free Card (Kavanaugh) burst into flames.  Mueller needs to pull the trigger...NOW!
@AP_Politics America....BE PREPARED TO MARCH!  üá∫üá∏
IF Rosenstein is fired...that action confirms Obstrcution of Justice, Abuse of Power, and other Trump crimes.  Bob Mueller MUST act today, to preserve the investigation!  Americans may have to remove Trump if that fails.  üá∫üá∏
@washingtonpost So...when will WE know the names of these clients?  Just for grins.
@realDonaldTrump So much better with the sound off.
@WhiteHouse Simply more of the same, on a global scale:  Blah, Blah, Kavanaugh...Blah, Blah, Me.

@cnni So, just wondering, how does the WH deny for Kavanaugh?  Do they have inside knowledge, perhaps acquired during a practice testimony?  Conflict of interest?

@SDISBEAUTIFUL1 Yep, I'm sure a line is forming.
@NatashaBertrand @ktbenner @MSNBC And the best the NYT could come up with is hearsay?  Hardly worth the print!
