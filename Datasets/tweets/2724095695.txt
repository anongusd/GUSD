Thoughts and prayers go out to all affected by the recent shooting at a Santa Fe High School near Houston, Texas. Gun Violence in America especially in our schools must stop!
A hungry child cannot concentrate, cannot focus, cannot learn. Roughly 265,000 low-income kids will lose access to meals at school because of partisan #GOPFarmBill. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAP
An estimated 2 million hungry Americans will be forced off SNAP by changes in the #GOPFarmBill.
400,000 households will lose SNAP benefits under the #GOPFarmBill. Shame on the Republicans.
Cuts to #SNAP would be devastating to low income families and many rural groceries and farmers markets. ‚ÄúFaith apart from works is dead.‚Äù (James 2:26) The #GOPFarmBill doesn‚Äôt do the work. #ProtectSNAP #HandsOffSNAP
265,000 kids will lose access to free school meals under the #GOPFarmBill.
House Republicans say the #GOPFarmBill doesn‚Äôt cut #SNAP. That‚Äôs not true. H.R. 2 cuts $9.2 billion in benefits to create unproven state workforce bureaucracies.
