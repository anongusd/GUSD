It's still possible we see as much as five inches of snow, and the rain should continue until the morning, with very cold temperatures and high winds coming in tomorrow afternoon around 2 PM. We again urge you to exercise caution if you have to travel tomorrow.
We are still expecting snow fall to begin around 6 PM. It will turn into a wintry mix around 10 PM and into heavy rain overnight. This is better than predicted but we still urge you to exercise caution and stay inside tonight if possible.

One year after the terrible attack in Charlottesville, we recommit to stand against racism and white supremacy everywhere it exists. Hate is ingrained in our nation’s history, but it shouldn’t define our future. NYC proves embracing our diversity is the best way forward.
And @BrianStelter, the lives of millions of Americans have been made more painful because of NewsCorp's agenda. We need to acknowledge that
Tragically @BrianStelter, NewsCorp fostered the hatred that threatens journalists and public servants alike. That wasn't created by the Left

Upon arrival in Texas, Eddie was separated from his mother and put on a bus to New York City. His aunt is worried sick about him. His grandma is worried sick. His mother is worried sick in detention.
Weeks ago, a young boy named Eddie left Honduras with his mother seeking asylum from a situation they felt was literally endangering their lives. Eddie didn’t know much — but he knew his mother was by his side.
We have to make sure we understand that each one of these children is a human being with a name and a family and a story. We cannot let the efforts to dehumanize them infect the rest of us.
Children are being ripped from their parents at the southern border. It’s painful, it’s dangerous, and it’s starting to suggest things with polite names like “tender age shelters” for places that keep young children from their mothers.

New York City saw firsthand the devastation of storms like Sandy, and we're investing $20 billion in resiliency to prepare for floods, rising tides, and heat. Protecting our city and our people from climate change is more important than ever.
On top of that we're suing Big Oil for the devastation they wrought. Hurricane Sandy left destruction across New York City, and the companies responsible must pay for it. We're the first city or state to sue and divest from Big Oil. Everyone who values our planet should join us. https://t.co/C8KtYxrCRv
We also refuse to support a backwards industry any longer, so we're divesting $5 billion in our pensions from fossil fuels. We won't pay Big Oil for harming the earth anymore.
We want to encourage every driver to drive electric, so this year we're setting up high-speed charging hubs in every borough. And by 2020 there will be 50 across the city, so it's even easier to use a electric car in New York City.
Buildings are the biggest source of emissions, so we're setting strict standards on energy efficiency. Smarter boilers, heaters, and windows will use less energy, and smarter buildings will be the equivalent of taking 900,000 cars off the road. https://t.co/8QxMo1gpB9
Our biggest goal is to lower our greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050. This means making sure every part of life in our city is more sustainable. Everything can be greener. https://t.co/0EoYfLGlkP
The first step is committing ourselves to the goals of the Paris Agreement. New York City was the first city to sign on to meeting the goals because it's important cities step up even if the federal government won't. https://t.co/4ZWrjQ14Nz
Earth Day is a call to arms for all of us to keep making big changes. We can act in so many ways to fight back against climate change. In New York City, we're trying to live differently so we can protect our earth.

The stereotypes you've heard are wrong – good, hardworking people fight for our public housing every day. There is more work to be done, and we will be here to see it through.
And our hard work continues every day, not just when it's convenient. We've installed high-speed internet and brought crime down 21% percent in the Queensbridge Houses. That doesn't mean we're done yet. We will keep delivering and pushing crime even lower.
We've invested $2.1 billion in major repairs at NYCHA because the residents are people, not political footballs. They deserved safety, so we spent $140 million to install more cameras and better lighting.
Our money is at work as we speak, and it's getting the job done. So far 65 roofs have been repaired, and they were completed on time and under budget. Another 78 are being fixed right now, and we plan to start work on 100 more later this year.

They said our vision for zero traffic-related deaths was too audacious. But we've proven that for New York City's pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists, Vision Zero is the only way forward. We will keep working until we make our vision a reality.
Queens Blvd alone has seen a major turnaround. In the last three years, we've lost no cyclists or pedestrians on what used to be called the "Boulevard of Death." In the years to come we'll keep working to redesign streets and intersections to make this city safer for everyone.
2017 was our safest year on record! The streets of New York City have been the safest they've ever been since 1910. https://t.co/F1rPauKt6c

Today, @NYCFerry service is suspended. The Staten Island Ferry will run on a modified schedule. The MTA will continue running. With wind picking up, use caution on your evening commute.

If you can, stay off the roads for your own safety and so that @NYCSanitation can continue to clear the streets. We will tow any vehicles blocking the roads.
Snow is coming down at a rate of 1-2 inches per hour. We now estimate a total of 6-10 inches, but it could be more in some places, with the snow tapering off this evening.

@NYCComptroller @NYCPA The deepest, truest stakeholders in this city are the people who do the work, who make this city come to life every day, but who too often do not reap the rewards. We commit ourselves to making sure this is ALWAYS their city, that it will not be taken away from them.

For the 2700 local businesses who pay up to $500k/yr in rent and make less than $5 million/yr in revenue, we are reducing Commercial Rent Tax. They stand to save $13k a year, and that can be the difference between being in the black or falling in the red.
Local businesses give our neighborhoods character – they can make this large city feel like a small town. So we’re taking steps to fight the Commercial Rent Tax to make sure they can stay in business.

Corporation Counsel Carter's list of achievements is longer than one tweet, but highlights include resolving stop and frisk litigation, reaching a settlement for the Central Park Five case, resolution of the Vulcan Society lawsuit, and reaching a settlement in the Nunez case.
With Commissioner Nigro at the helm, 2016 had the fewest fire deaths in New York City in a century and 2017 is on track to be one of the safest years on record. We also had the most diverse group of hopefuls ever to take the firefighter exam.
@NYPDONeill @FDNY Commissioner O'Neill started his job on the day of the Chelsea bombing and showed leadership that would set the tone for the rest of the term. NYC continues to be safest big city in America and neighborhood policing has built vital bridges between police and communities.

It’s a negative and discriminatory system that keeps Americans disenfranchised. This must change. It’s time we had a voting system that actually lives up to the needs of the people in this city and this state. We need state leaders to move these reforms.
As it stands today, it’s hard for many of us to vote in New York State and participate in this country’s democracy. We don’t have early voting or same day registration. It’s hard to file an absentee ballot and primaries occur over multiple days.
We just signed a bill to make it easier for New Yorkers to vote - soon they’ll be able to register online to vote. If we want the most energetic and diverse electorate we can get, we have to reach people in the way that makes the most sense for their lives.

Today we’re also happy to announce Melanie Hartzog will be our new OMB Director - the first African American Budget Director of New York City. She has a long record of thinking from the grassroots up - understanding what we do and what it means for New Yorkers.
Emma Wolfe is being advanced to Chief of Staff. She has been our partner since 2009, and is one of the best strategic thinkers there is. I’ll be relying on her more than ever to bring together all the pieces of this administration and have them work in harmony.
Kevin O’Brien has done an outstanding job as acting Chief of Staff as we went through a very intense 2017 and will continue with us in a senior capacity.
We are also creating a fifth Deputy Mayor position and naming Laura Anglin as Deputy Mayor of Operations. She’s done outstanding work with DM Shorris’s team - taking complex challenges and working across agencies to create new approaches and policies with speed and excellence.
Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio joined us later in the administration but she caught on quick, taking the thorniest issues of New York City and helping us move the ball forward on all of them.
I’m thrilled that two tremendous stars will continue with us. Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen has done stunning work. I asked things of her that were nearly impossible but she has a habit of doing impossible things.
Deputy Mayor Richard Buery took our most challenging idea — Pre-K For All — and brought it to life. He has changed the lives of tens of thousands of New York City families.
We will welcome Dean Fuleihan to succeed him. Everything we have attempted to do has been audacious. He brought calm thinking and creativity that was needed as our Budget Director to make it possible.
First Deputy Mayor Tony Shorris has been deeply involved in every success of this administration. It’s been a joy to watch him in action and I look forward to the many good projects in his future.
We’ve built a wonderful team of very talented and committed people. Over the last four years, they have helped us give you Pre-K For All, the biggest affordable housing plan in history, the safest big city in America, and better relationships between police and our communities.
