The speedy and excellent @buzzfeedben captures news of our exchange with @emmanuelmacron https://t.co/cMcRyptc4c
News: just come from a group interview with President Macron. * Trump is very likely still to withdraw from Iran deal, French persuasive powers notwithstanding	* He is an excellent Trump whisperer. Views him as 'predictable' 	* thinks Trump believes tough rhetoric worked w/NoKo
Great example of old adage: if you have an insoluble problem, enlarge it: https://t.co/lBlRbuGP2N
'we cannot say we should get rid of it like that'--Macron on Iran nuclear deal.
'we have to fight against the ever growing virus of fake news' -- macron to congress (and trump)
Very likely Macron could win 2020 Democratic presidential nomination...
Hard not to listen to Macron speech against 'isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism' as anything other than a lecture to his hand-holding friend President Trump...
