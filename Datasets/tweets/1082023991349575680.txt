@lquessenberry @Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw Where is the misinformation my beardy friend
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw Yes, are you aware of the many loopholes
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw That was not what you asked. I, myself, believe that this is the right way.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw That‚Äôs why you need more checks, the Republicans did during their time nothing to improve the laws and reduce the problems.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw It‚Äôs what I believe
@lquessenberry @Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw You are to generous with the LOL, stop that.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw No.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw Yes, I do. But you are true, it doesn‚Äôt matter what I think. I am not in power. I also think that as long as it is protected no one in power should take them from you.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw Well, I can ban handsc that‚Äôs up to the lord.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw Well, we can discuss that. I don‚Äôt think that these weapons should be protected under 2A. But as long as it allowed, no person should take it away from you.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw No it doesn‚Äôt. But to be fair, yes I am penalizing (in statements, not in actual power) law abiding citizens, because I feel it‚Äôs the right thing to do to battle all the needless and horrific deaths per year. I like the government to prevent.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw That‚Äôs not true, there are plenty of options still left. False narrative as well.
@lquessenberry @Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw I didn‚Äôt invite you in any conversation, you can and should stay away. Idiot.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw Because the best tool available cost lives elsewhere. I am not against hunting, I wish you all well during hunting season, I am just against the type of weapon used. These doesn‚Äôt make sense.
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 @mattgaetz is not only an asshole, he is a witness tampering asshole. He should be sued, ousted from cmmt and or GOP by @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader and investigated by @RepAdamSchiff. Also an ethic commission should look into this abhorent behavior.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw The use of this weapon is stupid, I don‚Äôt say that these people are stupid.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw If you can‚Äôt hunt a hog with a normal rifle, like many hunters do, you shouldn‚Äôt hunt at all. The AR is not designed as an hunting weapon. It‚Äôs like fishing with dynamite, it‚Äôs stupid, lazy and cruel.
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw The best choice for you doesn‚Äôt make the use of it stupid
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw I know the numbers, but the other solution is to ban it all. I like to ban the stupid firearms like the AR and other power rifles. An AR for hunting, that‚Äôs just stupid and cruel.
@JoeSmit61751870 @RepDanCrenshaw This is just stupid, 40000 deaths a year is idiotic. Under Republican leadership Congress did nothing to prevent and everything to expand the number of deaths. These are the facts!
@Pyrotese @RepDanCrenshaw I summed just a few things up, there is no sense in selling AR‚Äôs or firearms simular to the AR. The AR is the weapon of choice in many shooting. Fully automatic or not.
@RepDanCrenshaw If life is so important to you, would you support a bill to ban firearms, other automatic armory, all high capacity magazines and fully automatic guns? Would you support the closing of every loophole and universal background checks. #gunsense #parklandschoolshooting #ProLife
