In a shutdown, those who feel the most pain are public employee unions, advocates for government spending, social safety net dependents, all traditionally Democratic constituencies. If they believe Trump is unmovable, look for them to ramp up pressure on Schumer/Pelosi to end it.

Sen Warren has money, message and the ability to put together a national organization. What could sink her is if voters think she's being dishonest about who she is. Dishonesty sank the Hillary Clinton campaign. Democrats are not going to want to go down that road again.

What is contributing to perception that Republicans are having a good night? Partly it was the fawning pre-election coverage of "rising Democratic stars" Andrew Gillum, Beto O'Rourke and Stacey Abrams, all headed for defeat.
Invisible primary watchers, take note. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, running in the blue state of MA, has more absolute votes and a bigger margin of victory than @SenWarren in her race. https://t.co/boqpcJd3gD
Seems to me like there's still a hidden Trump vote that only reveals itself on Election Day. RCP averages had Donnelly +1.3 (losing by 11), Gillum +3.6 (losing by 1.1%), Nelson +2.4 (losing by 1) and Bredesen -5.2 (losing by 24).
Still early and could change but Wall Street responding positively to a better-than-expected GOP showing in the midterms. Futures have swung from a loss earlier in the evening to now a healthy gain.
