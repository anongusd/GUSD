Must Read: House Permanent Select Committee Memo on FISA Abuses at DOJ and FBI https://t.co/3et2ANl5QB
The FBI spied on American citizens using information they knew to be fraudulent without informing FISA court judge of “political origins” of info (dossier paid for by Clinton and Dems).
RT @JaySekulow: Radio: BREAKING: POTUS Declassifies #Memo; Full Release Imminent. https://t.co/D5SUA4a4eU
From #Memo: “The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials, but excluded from the FISA applications.” (This means FISA judge didn’t know info was from opposition research paid for by Hillary Clinton and Democrats, not FBI intel)
In #Memo, “Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information.”
Catherine Herridge on Memo: Steele Dossier formed essential part of initial and all 3 renewals of FISA applications against Trump campaign official - waiting for release of full memo,	excerpts being released now
