@SpeakerPelosi @RepGonzalez 		A border wall has nothing to do with race &amp; everything to do with breaking our laws.		It is WRONG for white, yellow, brown, purple or polka-dotted people to ILLEGALLY enter or stay in this country.  		Intentionally breaking the law IS a moral issue.
@Here4Not @TomDangora @HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris If you are referring to me as the MAGA moron, you are grossly misinformed.  	I did not vote for him.  		I merely point out the hypocrisy of the left denying facts about HRC’s illegal &amp; treasonous activities that have even been corroborated by lackey James Comey, for heaven’s sake
@TomDangora @HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris So voter fraud began with electronic ballot boxes?  Really?  		Some unscrupulous people have always tried to ensure that their choice wins.		Speaking of the lengths people will go to.....	That pesky little HRC bought &amp; paid for dossier just won’t go away, will it?
@SherrodBrown Sounds great if YOU are paying for it. 		That  increase will translate into higher prices and more expensive services meaning that raise won’t go so far.
@charliekirk11 Of course they know. They want illegals to be allowed to vote for them. 		When will good people get courageous enough to fight the insanity? 		Our legacy will be that we allowed the radicals to blow our country up &amp; we expected someone else to try to build it back together.
@SenatorMenendez @ChangeTheRef @manueloliver00 Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the country and so much gun violence. 		Law abiding citizens lose their guns and crooks benefit because 	they will keep theirs. 		Shouldn’t you punish the BAD guys instead of the GOOD guys?#backwardthinking #foolish #sittingducks
@AOC @guardian We wouldn’t have an economy if we left it to you. Pun intended.
@aaaparking why don’t you put a number to report out-of-order ticket generating machines in your large lots?  That would be good customer service.
@SamCatClemens @def_not_banksy @artdecider @ChelleHoniker @furmple @LouisatheLast @KEVIN_639 @RealJamesWoods Or perhaps he recognizes the attack game blaming all the world’s ills on white males. Caucasian men AND WOMEN certainly bear the guilt for some evil deeds. In reality, every race has had its victimizers. Any groups’ prideful claim of moral superiority lacks historical awareness.
@staceyabrams sorry, I guess this was actually meant for you, not a satire of you. https://t.co/CmcrxmO4EX
@RepMGS LEGAL IMMIGRATION ≠ ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION		This has nothing to do with race and everything to do with breaking the law. 		It is WRONG for white, yellow, brown, purple or polka-dotted people to ILLEGALLY enter or stay in this country.
@DJSpacePants @DevonGrayCA a lot of those 1950’s &amp; later liberals who like Lyndon Johnson appeared “benevolent” toward African Americans had an agenda that was anything but.  LBJ’s infamous quote, that I will not repeat, shows the terrible plan to use minorities &amp; make them dependent
@DJSpacePants @DevonGrayCA Liberal like Lincoln who wanted Slaves NOT to legally be someone else’s personal property like a dog? Yes, that kind of liberal.                Not the kind of liberal who high-fives and applauds killing children.
The definition of RACISM is an attitude or belief in superiority &amp; the right to dominate others or that a particular racial group is inferior.		Too many today say there is no racism against whites because we are the majority.		That is a lie.		Racism is racism no matter your color https://t.co/qvQSbJZ46X
Pick me, I’m definitely an everyday person.

The gray areas are becoming stunningly black and white. Let’s hope voters in 2020 see the stark contrast. 	Basic presuppositions about the value and worth of people influence your policy decisions.

Hypocrisy? @staceyabrams if you run for senator representing Georgia, expect a fight, and it won’t be because of race.  I cannot trust a person who thinks there is ANY kind of justice derived from an abortion. Don’t care where you got your degrees, that’s utter foolishness. https://t.co/gfd3fFYOmY
For 40 yrs. I have carefully used language that would not offend as I have spoken against the horror of Abortion. They answered with more heinous demands. We must speak truth &amp; stop allowing those who celebrate killing to control the narrative.@nrlc @DevinNunes @LindseyGrahamSC
Are any democrats left who are brave enough &amp; honest enough to stand up &amp; say abortion has gone too far?  Your “line” was supposed to be viability, but now that “killing window”is shrinking. Will you lay down your very soul at that bloody altar? @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @nrlc
@DevonGrayCA I dare say some held and still hold that the court practiced illegitimacy when it made the still controversial Roe v Wade ruling.  The high court can, in fact, be wrong. I’m thinking Dred Scott, for example. (Oh, those 2 dissenting voices were Republicans.)
@staceyabrams Exactly what do you mean by “advance voting rights “?  If you mean encouraging US citizens to register to vote, being educated on the candidates’ positions &amp; history, and getting out to exercise that right, absolutely.  After your “reproductive justice” comment, I wonder.

@staceyabrams “Reproductive Justice”??  Margaret Sanger, Lyndon B. Johnson and all those other eugenicists are giving you a standing ovation from hell.	Killing babies is evil.	All your bravado can’t hide the inconvenient truth.
@HeatherKay72 @slabandsauce @xan_desanctis @SethAMandel @SenSasse @NRO The party a person claims isn’t the issue. In an abortion, someone dies and it is the defenseless one with no voice in their fate. We call that victimization. If you want to celebrate that, we can discern a few things about you. That’s just the way it works.
@obfusicationx2 @CrazzyDemm @ConservativeMua @AlenciaJohnson It is a travesty to argue that since something is wrong with the baby it should be aborted. So only those guaranteed to be “perfect” deserve to have life?  In an abortion someone dies, and it is the smaller person with no say in the matter. Don’t we call that victimization?
@Bran_William_ @KatrawnerRawner @cpearceesq @darrentweets2 @RubioFrancisc12 Sir, there is nothing fun or silly about being dismembered or being burned alive or having forceps shoved in your brain. You are afforded the luxury of being crass, but 61,000,000 in the U S are just dead.

@SpeakerPelosi Barriers making illegal entry into the US more difficult might discourage some women from putting themselves in a position where perhaps 80% are victimized. Ignoring facts &amp; people in your power play seems a tad immoral. @senatemajldr @JudicialWatch @Jim_Jordan

79% of Trump voters wanted a wall built on the southern border per pew research. And that was before Yale &amp; MIT told us perhaps  22 MILLION illegal people from all over the world are already in our country. Those implications are pretty pricey. @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi

@RepPress THIS is what caused me to forget about logical investigation. Now that video has disappeared.  Wonder why that is?  Wonder who edited it and put it out to so many people?  Someone knows and someone else has their scent.  Whoever did this was WRONG &amp; we all know it. https://t.co/LvIAMZy6fh
@RepPress This is one of my observations that I would particularly appreciate you addressing.
@RepPress Actually, I looked again and I am wrong.  I think he is speaking of Nathan.  He surely is an angry guy though.
@RepPress With whose group?
@RepPress So, yes, I guess I am swallowing it because significant lies were told to make this look bad. This did not have to be such a divisive situation. Someone tried to make this look like something it wasn’t.  We do not need any more division in this country. Why did someone do that?
@RepPress If ice/snow is on one side of Nick, there is another side where he could have walked.  That photographer managed to utilize it for minutes.  The truth is, Mr. Phillips chose to stop any progress and beat a drum &amp; chant loudly in a youth’s face. The made up story has fallen apart.
@RepPress The gentleman yelling “I got him” has an angry tone to his voice and combative body language.  It makes no sense that the “him” is Nathan.
@RepPress Why did Mr. Phillips have so many different versions of this account? Why could other people with Mr. Phillips get past Nick up the steps but Mr. Phillips can’t? You keep focusing on Nick, please address so many inconsistencies in other people’s stories.
@RepPress Mr. Hooligan claims that he was with Nathan, surrounded by a sneering, jeering crowd that molded to their huddle, causing panic to grow in his gut &amp; as tensions grew “I pulled out my phone” He is obviously walking into the crowd with his phone already recording. Why so many lies?
@RepPress For days I have asked you to seriously look at the many inconsistencies I point out. I hoped to get your perspective. I just sent my research to an investigative reporter. Facts are facts.
@RepPress Sir, when will you be able to get around to giving me your input on the issues I have raised?  I would greatly appreciate your thoughts.
@RepPress Sir, in this technological age, I have read that video can be manipulated. We are trying to wait patiently but start to wonder why it is taking so long. Would you please look at my YouTube comments? I appreciate it.
@TaePhoenix @RealJamesWoods Those crimes are horrible . No person should victimize another person. 		It is worth noting: 	-not every white person owned slaves 	-The movement that abolished slavery in the British Empire was born in the heart of lily-white Wm. Wilberforce
@SavannahGuthrie shouldn’t you have asked Mr. Phillips if he should apologize for lying about being a Vietnam Vet?  A video on his Facebook proving he said those exact words was widely known BEFORE you let him lie about it again. 	Hmmm..wonder what other lies you overlooked?
@RepPress Thank you very much
@RepPress Sir, would you mind looking at my questions in the comments of your video saying Nick moved? You seem very busy but I would really appreciate seeing what you think regarding my observations.   Thank you so much.
Experts in border security advocate for a wall. You know what they say yet completely ignore it just to look like you won. I’m super impressed @SpeakerPelosi 🚫 https://t.co/gWEjzJTqmF
And fewer victimized women &amp; children, fewer gang members &amp; less illegal drugs would be in the US. Gee, I can definitely see why @SpeakerPelosi thinks that wall is so immoral. 🤦🏻‍♀️@Jim_Jordan @SenSchumer https://t.co/RGrns6qPkp

@ArtisanPastry She voted to allow more info gathering on us without a warrant. If someone getting information without going through proper channels (hacking HRC’s emails) is so offensive to her, she shouldn’t have voted for it.
@sfpelosi https://t.co/ASUb4t6nJ5 if that hack was so wrong, maybe @SpeakerPelosi should have fought this for protection of privacy of all Americans. Aren’t you so upset because someone was caught hiding the fact she did things that she knew she shouldn’t? @HillaryClinton @JudicialWatch

@dailycaller Confident all those politically impartial journalists will cover this like they did Mr. Phillips confronting a kid standing on a public step. They ignored his political agenda. Do you hear her say “it don’t matter, it’s all ours anyway”? Wow https://t.co/5pCX8GUqPK

@FBI Should @HillaryClinton and @Comey be expecting you soon?  Why won’t you apply the same principles and do something about their crimes?  @TheJusticeDept , your partisan behavior lately is wrong.  You seem to have forgotten that the lady with the scales wears a blindfold.
@DailyCaller Why do all these early morning FBI raids of late make me flash back to images of Nazi’s dragging people off to the camps? @FBI
@briantylercohen I’m truly sorry for the losses in CO, sir, but please listen to Obama’s own Border Patrol chief, Mark Morgan. Please listen to the people like Raul Ortiz,  risking their lives to PROTECT us at the border. Both say a wall is necessary. Please look at the facts.
@LindseyGrahamSC @RepAOC @SpeakerPelosi @GOP @realDonaldTrump I thought the US House Chamber in the US Capitol Building belonged to the CITIZENS of the United States, not you.  Speaker Pelosi, changing long accepted protocol for your political agenda is rather presumptuous. #BuildtheWall .
@DanLamothe - your article ensuring Mr. Phillips bears no responsibility for ALL the times reporters called him a Vietnam vet (and Mr. Phillips just forgot to correct even one of these) may need an update.  He LIED.  He lied about things in the Nick Sandmann incident, too. https://t.co/Kw9mXL6bJf
@kathygriffin so instead of admitting any fault in calling for harm to be done to a KID you dig in and have to justify your insanity. Do you have a shred of humanity left? I used to think you were funny. At least I can admit when I’m wrong.
@gsiskind Thank you for helping this poor lady, and thanks for rallying the troops. Would it help change policy if citizens wrote or called someone? Would it help this lady if we started a campaign of calls and letters on her behalf? I’m so saddened that she was treated like this.
@shaunking I’m sorry you have been accused falsely.  You should know how this feels. I saw that short clipped video I thought he was such a punk.  But the hours of videos and interviews I’ve seen &amp; read prove otherwise.  Your commenters have convicted &amp; executed him. Where is your humanity?
@Archgabester @jimwexell @bethg1017 @shaunking What kind of person says this about a KID? All this pent up hatred is just sucking the air out of our country.  I saw that short video and thought that kid is a punk.  THEN I saw hours of videos &amp; listened to conflicting accounts by Mr. Phillips. He got in the kid’s face.
@HinshawTeta @KimberNerd @bethanyshondark @benshapiro No but it isn’t good enough for them to just destroy some of the kids.  Guilt by association (and skin color of course). What are we teaching our kids by our example? God have mercy on us all.
@NYDailyNews There is literally no story in the entire world as important as DESTROYING a bunch of kids?  That is your mission in life now?  You think you are honestly making the world a better place? Blind hatred makes you an empty shell. Just stop.

Mr Phillips says 1)”when I started going forward ..people started separating..to allow me to move out of the way or to proceed” then 2)”he aligned himself with me so that he would stop my exit” 3)”wouldn’t allow me to retreat”what direction did he want to go? https://t.co/chVMUpeieN

@Piratical_Turk @DouthatNYT Mr. Phillips has several conflicting story versions. I have researched for hours &amp; listened or read his interviews.  He was followed by his “photojournalists” and could have walked to his right, going up the steps around the kids. He intentionally got in the middle of them.

@Piratical_Turk @DouthatNYT So you STILL think this is the kids fault? Seriously?
@MSNBC did you watch that 2 hr video? Those kids were not an angry mob taunting the Black Israelites. why didn’t your reporter ask Mr Phillips why he got in that kids face and said he was blocked in? Look at the facts. https://t.co/k5YOKXgWWt
@AnaCabrera Mr Phillips claimed this kid moved to intentionally block him and that he was surrounded. The guys crowding behind him were WITH him. Did you even watch those other videos? https://t.co/aRkGAiSDP7

@ktumulty This is slander to run when you know it is false. A calculated attempt to try to provoke “rich”, white, MALE, pro-life, TRUMP lovers and hope one of them fought back. You guys were rabid over this. Lost any credibility you had left.
@dshwa76 @annehelen Nope
@kathygriffin I thought comedians were supposed to be funny. I didn’t even vote for him but You insane people have made me hope I have the chance to vote Trump. If you hate him, he must be doing something right. #DemsAreHaters #DemsThreatenKids
@SashaMinsk1 Did you watch other videos besides those that proved your narrative?  I thought that kid was a punk, too, until I saw the truth.  He just stood there and Mr. Phillips beat that drum in his face, touching him. Mr. Phillips was aggressive to a kid.
@NathanLerner @joncoopertweets @funder @TheDemCoalition you all have actually pushed me over the edge.  I didn’t vote for TRUMP, but I will if I get the chance. You people want a civil war.   You maybe went too far vilifying A KID who didn’t deserve it.  People are waking up.

@Truactive @AdamSerwer @Currying_Favor You really telling a kid’s name? Why? Hoping he’ll get a little justice? If he gets hurt, you should get sued. Mr. Phillips got in his face. He was blocked in by his own camera people!long video proves it.
@Uncle_Jimbo @benshapiro @BuckSexton @IngrahamAngle @SaraCarterDC This guy spread the MAGA hat kid’s name on twitter, over and over.  If anything happens to that boy, this guy should be prosecuted. Who does this kind of stupid stuff? https://t.co/I5JVgV5msC
@DailyCaller This is the kind of damage that cannot be undone.  Maybe you all should investigate this incident.  It seems very contrived.  Mr. Phillips had several people following him and videoing before he approached the kids.  Wonder who those people are? this is fishy https://t.co/I5JVgV5msC
@SharylAttkisson this @invisiblehandd spread the real name of that MAGA hat kid all over twitter.  Someone needs to do an expose of what went on.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump And you and @SpeakerPelosi are doing exactly WHAT to COMPROMISE?   That is defined as “coming to agreement by mutual concession”. Give US the wall and see if we are proven wrong in our claims that it will aid in securing our border. Dare you.
@joncoopertweets BUZZFEED??? Seriously? watch the longer videos from different angles. This story has layers. This kid did not walk up to the gentleman and initiate this face off like I initially believed from the clipped version. Maybe he should have walked away, but he did not confront anyone.
Sounds like an idea worth considering. Thank you. @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump (and voting , by law, is the privilege of citizens, so of course they cannot vote) https://t.co/XhwhnNpyJR
Except that it has been removed. Someone needs to find that and put it back. Truth is important. https://t.co/WIMMRiYMDq
@MackPolitical I feel a little betrayed by what we were meant to believe about this. I really should have known better than to jump to conclusions. https://t.co/eRReWLt5A3
Would somebody please try to revive these two  @SpeakerPelosi &amp; @SenSchumer and tell them we need a wall? (Maybe play that “fact” video of Schumer proving the point). @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @SenateGOP @HouseGOP https://t.co/zIUk4nhqjZ
I may be the lone pro-life voice here but this is wrong. Do not endanger the life of this woman and do not endanger her child. Why is she not receiving her medication? What can we do? https://t.co/oOPwGHoOBY
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you do know that when you tweet trying to defend yourself, those calculated deceivers use it against you, right? What would happen if you didn’t give them any more ammunition?  Please consider giving it a try.  Proverbs 17:28. Thank you.
@SpeakerPelosi I didn’t even vote for Trump.  Our Border Patrol says they want a wall.  Obama’s Border Patrol Chief, Mark Morgan agrees. You’re sacrificing federal workers to prove your point.  You don’t represent WE THE PEOPLE - only those who are like you. The truth is showing.
@TheDemCoalition @GOP Negotiate? @SpeakerPelosi has already decreed she will not give US the wall. I didn’t even vote for Trump and can see your childish game. And @SenSchumer is so afraid of her he caves.
@funder But you are absolutely right. America is losing. This is narcissistic behavior @SpeakerPelosi. Of course you recognize a temper tantrum.
@funder You know this is not true. Compromise is what you should advocate. The American people want a secure border. You don’t even pretend to care. It is all about your agenda. Hope you are really proud of yourself.
@JamesMartinSJ @MackPolitical I am pro-life. It is NEVER cute or acceptable to try to humiliate someone else. EVER. You have just succeeded in confirming what a lot of people think we are like. I’m embarrassed for you since you seem too foolish to know you should be.
@funder @realDonaldTrump It is called a COMPROMISE to solve these problems. You wouldn’t be able to accept that ever - simply because Trump is proposing it. Your obsessed hatred is hurting people and our republic. Dems need to compromise, too if you care at all about any of these people.
@NathanLerner If he is guilty he should be prosecuted. Hillary Clinton should be, too. Equality all around. But I bet you would fight that, Wouldn’t you?  You only think those who disagree with you deserve to be punished.
@ChrisMurphyCT And 100 years ago women could not vote. A heck of a lot is different today. There was a different impact on society from illegal immigration 100 years ago. Today we are talking as many as 22 Million people.
@DGComedy @joncoopertweets Because GOD FORBID anyone with a Y chromosome be allowed to say that the most defenseless members of our society are worth defending!  Those unreasonable sexist pigs!!! @DailyCaller
@sfpelosi @TheDemCoalition Did your mom listen to the men and women risking their lives on the border yet? Did she listen to OBAMA’s own Border Patrol Chief, Mark Morgan? No, her rabid hatred of @realDonaldTrump has made her deaf to reasonable solutions. How does that serve any of us?
@SenMajLdr @SpeakerPelosi This is the second time (that we know of) that our elections have been manipulated by these unscrupulous &amp; corrupt shysters. Please DO SOMETHING!!! https://t.co/fXKmMmKdGE
@ParantoKristine Agree, we need to know facts, not all of this wild speculation from people who seem to have forgotten what journalism should be. Whipping people into a feeding frenzy with theories just breeds civil unrest and hurts our republic. @JudiciaryGOP @senjudiciary @JudicialWatch
@SenFeinstein @JudicialWatch @SenTedCruz what if we build a wall and incorporate technology to detect digging activity? It must take more than a few minutes to tunnel. Agents could have time to intervene. Just a thought.
@SenFeinstein Hillary Clinton DID lie to Congress.     No “ifs” regarding Hillary’s lies. So while you are feeling all judicial, she needs some justice, too. @HillaryClinton @JudicialWatch @Jim_Jordan
@NARAL I have 3 daughters &amp; 4 granddaughters.  I’m very pro-woman.  It is not a lie that in an abortion someone dies.  We rightly rally against men who victimize women, yet applaud women who victimize their own children.  Something is terribly wrong with that picture. #MarchForLife
Thank you for being a voice for those whose voice cannot be heard. @SenatorTimScott @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/gzIvrD6JHV
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary Great! Now you’re going to prosecute @HillaryClinton for lying to Congress? @comey even testified she lied over and over during her testimony.  Not even the rich and powerful should be above the law. Be consistent.
How many of these socialists are signing over 70% of their personal assets to the government?  If it is such a smashing idea, go ahead, lead by example.  Oh, I forgot. You just want to force the rest of us to. https://t.co/8cWB5xgMYI
Thank you Rep Lipinski.  Can I trust a politician to protect my rights, or my elderly mother’s, or my infant grandchild’s if they think the most defenseless among us legitimately should be disposed of because they are inconvenient to someone else? Who was never an inconvenience? https://t.co/lZlpWVRxv7
@kausikdatta22 @NCCNeon @KristenClarkeJD @Amy_Siskind @AFJustice @LawyersComm “It’s because of your gender and color that you can afford not to care”. I am a mostly white woman. I refuse to bow to the absurdity that mirroring my race &amp; gender are the most important considerations for a judge’s suitability. There is WAY too much focus on identity politics.
@kausikdatta22 @NCCNeon @KristenClarkeJD @Amy_Siskind @AFJustice @LawyersComm So I should just want any old white woman as a judge so she somehow “represents” me?  RBG most certainly does not.  I refuse to support someone simply because they look like me.  I have voted for people who looked nothing like me, but they had character and wisdom.
@KristenClarkeJD The “legal mainstream”? Shouldn’t our first concern be that they have a proven record of upholding the Constitution of the United States of America, not trying to re-write it?
@WokeRomney @joncoopertweets I actually voted for you. I COULD not vote for Trump or deceitful HRC. If you are just sitting around hoping the worst is true about the president &amp; not working your TAIL off for more secure borders, I will forever regret that I wasted my valuable vote on you. Do something FOR us
@TheDemCoalition You are KNOWINGLY pushing untruth here.  Actually LIES.  He is going to a private hospital. NOT SOCIALIZED.  You people know no shame.  @RandPaul
@funder “Undocumented workers...see little option but TO REMAIN IN THE SHADOWS “ so is Barack Obama racist for saying that? @DailyCaller @BarackObama
@ManMadeMoon I have 3 grown daughters &amp; 6 grands. Husband traveled a lot and no family close. It was exhausting but being consistent in explaining rules then enforcing appropriate consequences is key. They learn to obey &amp; you enjoy them more.

@ConanLouis1 @SenSanders I’m not playing a game. All politicians lie because we let them. It is our fault. I didn’t vote Trump but it is ridiculous to hold him to a standard you don’t hold anyone else to.
@ConanLouis1 @SenSanders Impacted, yes, but not to the extent Obama said. One in 5 jobs are still left, not 1 in 10. Sorry, I guess I should have said it was an exaggeration. When Trump “exaggerates” it seems as if he is called a liar. And I personally think anything less than truth is untruth.
@i8dbbq @SenSanders If you are honest you know Clinton, Bush, Obama all lied. Not just in little things. We have to demand truthfulness but we can’t demand it while excusing it from someone we voted for. A lie is a lie is a lie.
@ConanLouis1 @SenSanders Unfortunately a heck of a lot of politicians lie. And they lie a lot. Conservatives and liberals.
@ConanLouis1 @SenSanders “My position hasn’t changed” on using executive authority to address immigration issues. Barack Obama 11/20/14. Untrue
@ConanLouis1 @SenSanders “Most young Americans right. Ow, they’re not covered” by health insurance. Barack Obama. 3/11/14 untrue

@RepMarkMeadows Thomas Homan, former acting ICE Director, states that walls are an important part of the equation to secure our borders that includes technology and people on the ground.  Walls make access more difficult and allow agents time to get to the scene to intervene.
@TomFitton @DailyCaller Listening for the left’s moral outrage over this intentional and calculated campaign of lies.  Nope, can’t hear it over all their laughter at how easily we are manipulated.
@funder @TheDemCoalition DNC &amp; Clinton Campaign..Perkins Coie..Fusion GPS..Steele..Jonathan Winer..Sidney Blumenthal..Cody Shearer... just connecting some dots.  People in glass houses....
@SenSanders Kind of like Obama saying we could keep our healthcare if we liked our healthcare plan.  Over and over and over.  All lies.
@paperchase71 @JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump HRC gave assurances of accountability and understanding of the need to separate her gov’t job from Clinton Found. Her private server is registered under the name Eric Hoteham days before she was confirmed by the Senate. Gee, wonder why she went to such lengths to hide her emails?
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition I am a lifelong republican (until 2016) and that’s exactly what was asked of me.  I wasn’t going to sell my soul for the GOP. I hope with all my heart there are Democrats who will vote, not for a party, but for a person of character - if any are on the ticket.
@SenatorTimScott Thomas Homan, former acting ICE director states walls are an important part of the equation to secure our borders that includes technology and people on the ground. Walls make access more difficult and allow agents time to get to the scene to intervene.
@SenatorTimScott Those who voted for Trump, and I am not among them, overwhelmingly wanted a wall along the entire southern border https://t.co/eKx4fbtWmq.  He seems to be trying to do what they asked.
@funder @TheDemCoalition We may all want to help the entire world but how can that be a logical option?  There is a difference between a person seeking asylum here fleeing persecution versus those who would just like to have the funds we so freely give.  Reasonable choices do not equal racism.
@NathanLerner The Yale Study in the fall said there could be as many as 22 MILLION illegal people in this country.  That is an illegal immigration problem.  When we visited Australia years ago, I had to prove we had a flight back home.  I did not consider that racist, it was their right.
@SonjaHanneman @Comey And there are more than a few examples of rich and powerful people who, in spite of a boatload of evidence, somehow managed to avoid prosecution. Conservative crooks and liberal crooks alike. Money and power often tip the blind lady’s scales.
@SonjaHanneman @Comey Don’t hate her. I have read liberal and conservative accounts, Congressional testimony, her own words. Fact is, Comey, one of her supporters, testified that she lied again and again about a list of pretty significant things. I’m just taking him at his word.
@SonjaHanneman @Comey Even Mr. “ I can’t seem to remember” testified that HRC lied over and over and over. National Security was all that was at stake. Ah who really cares anyway?
@TheRealUgom @DailyCaller Because they have a culture of death. Like Margaret Sanger’s eugenics, Killing off the inferior human weeds was her mission. Sick and depraved.
@DailyCaller Of course they did. They want to be allowed to vote when people finally give them what they so justly deserve.
@funder @TheDemCoalition I hope your vocabulary is not indicative of what is in your heart. But of course it is.  No wonder this world is in the turmoil it is in. And before you start assuming things - I did not vote for Trump and I’m not a white man. Words matter. Words have consequences. Hate isn’t ok
@HillaryClinton Actions have consequences”?? How incredibly self-aware you are.	Gowdy: Secretary Clinton said all work related emails were returned to the State Department. Was that true?	Comey: No. We found work related email, thousands, that were not returned.
@norcalbbgm @bennyjohnson @ChrisLoesch Some “jokes” are veiled insults and are NOT funny.
@CRTV @HillaryClinton “they all look alike”????? @HillaryClinton did not at all appear to be reprimanding the host for her mistake. Her facial expression and body language suggest she was using an OFFENSIVE racial stereotype to appear witty.  Her little “I’m so clever” grin is outrageous.
