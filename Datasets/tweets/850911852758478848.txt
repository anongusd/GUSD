Let's stop treating this as a game. Elections matter not because you want your team to win - but because people's lives are at stake. 		We've got 714 days until the 2020 election cycle ends. 		Let's figure this out, and let's start now. 		Organize. Donate. Vote.
It starts with what we've heard time and time again in past cycles - a narrow and focused message. But that's not enough. 		Normal people don't react to politics the way politicos do. 		The bubble needs to pop, and normal people need to bring the real world back to D.C.
So how do we fix that?
But the fact is, the American moderate is not consuming this and critically analyzing it. For people who don‚Äôt live in the bubble, they have real life to live. So they shut down. They tune out. They give up, become bystanders, because someone else out there will dissect it.
This is not a value judgement, it‚Äôs a fact of the matter. For politicos, this is great! More high-information voters create a strong democracy, right?
The American moderate is exhausted. They‚Äôre exhausted because they are now exposed to more politics than anyone in any other era. At no point in human history has so much of our time involved exposure to politics.
This is all true. But that‚Äôs not what the reality of American politics is. The moderate is not a believer in a centrist ideology nor are they (necessarily) a low information voter either.
It‚Äôs a common theme of the left to bemoan the enlightened centrist, the perpetually moving moderate. The concerns aren‚Äôt unreasonable - the Overton window shifts and the middle is not a static nor automatically justifiable place.

@TedraCobb "You can't be a sometimes environmentalist". Says she agrees in investing in renewable energy. @EliseStefanik smirking ?
@TedraCobb again speaking to the diverse solutions that we have available. Her strength today has been her her ability to focus on the issues. @EliseStefanik talks more bipartisanship, says she doesn't support carbon tax. @lynnskahn continues to talk about fairy tales.
@lynnskahn talks about hydrogen fuel. @TedraCobb reminds that @EliseStefanik voted against Clean Power Act, says that we need to rely on military when it comes to knowing that climate change is an issue.
Next question is about climate change and carbon tax.
@TedraCobb reminds us that we've been waiting four years for @EliseStefanik to take action on Health Care.
@lynnskahn has spent most of the debate up to this point being used by @EliseStefanik as a tool against @TedraCobb. Very clear she is not taken seriously on policy. @TedraCobb says that her decision to not take insurance money is the start of making decisions.
@TedraCobb says she‚Äôs starting with the problem, not the solution. Gives diverse array of solutions. Reminds that @EliseStefanik voted to repeal without a replacement. 		Fact Check: True.
@TedraCobb says that she‚Äôs in the race because @EliseStefanik voted to repeal the ACA. 		Fact check: True.
@EliseStefanik lies about ACA, repeatedly. An incredible amount. Not even an attempt to be close to the facts. @lynnskahn talks support for Universal Healthcare - vision, dental &amp; mental health. Says she'll amend Medicare For All with 8 changes.
Moderator says a majority of questions are about healthcare. "How do we resolve the healthcare crisis?"
@TedraCobb says that H2C visa has been "sitting". @EliseStefanik mentions Fort Drum, thanks the soldiers.
@EliseStefanik calls @TedraCobb misinformed regarding AUMF. @lynnskahn talks about the failures of Congress when it comes to Iraq - "What are we doing in Africa?". Says most wars are for oil, for empire and for ego. Says it's a bipartisan problem.
@TedraCobb says that this Congress has failed to act as a check. Talks about the repeal of environmental regulation. @EliseStefanik says AUMF should be updated, talks immigration re: agricultural issues.
@TedraCobb reminds that healthcare is an essential issue to voters. Question asked regarding the balance of power between executive and legislative.
Seems to be an issue between understanding if Kahn or Cobb is being called on.
@EliseStefanik brings up "settled law", says she agrees with this. Stefanik says she is pro-life, but supports birth control covered by health insurance. Supports LGBTQ rights in context of employment. @TedraCobb reminds that @EliseStefanik voted to defund @PPFA
@TedraCobb talking about how important health care is to women's rights. Decision should be between women and doctor. Discusses how President is rolling back LGBTQ rights, says that she'll be a check against this.
Question directed to @lynnskahn about SCOTUS, Kahn talking about how we can decrease abortion. Says it's going to "piss off" other Greens. Probably true. Not an answer to the question though.
@lynnskahn continuing to talk about waste in government in response. @EliseStefanik jumping onboard.
@EliseStefanik continuing to talk about @NancyPelosi. @TedraCobb reminds us that 2008 happened, even if @EliseStefanik pretends it didn't.
Cobb goes hard and fast, talking about how Stefanik has directed plans to privatize social security. Talking about her experience in local government.
Kahn, pen in hand, talking big ideas about NY-21. Disagrees with word ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù. Brings up War on Terrorism &amp; Drugs, wants War on Government Waste
Stefanik repeats lies about Cobb‚Äôs record on taxation. Blames Pelosi and Obama for deficit. Dodged question about social security.
Brian Mann asking the first question to Stefanik - about tax cuts and deficit.
Cobb opening strong, talking about her background in this district, how‚Äôs she‚Äôs helped the district &amp; how Stefanik has harmed #NY21.
Kahn opening with how she‚Äôs *not* a native to NY-21. Talking about her psychology background in government.
Elise is opening, talking about her bipartisan results, fort drum, jobs etc. Seems to be stumbling a little bit - trying to relate opponents to Cuomo and Gillibrand.
Debate is starting
Kahn has taken to stage, located at middle podium. @TedraCobb on right side. Stefanik seems to be taking notes on something. Candidates are getting mic‚Äôd.
Debate starts soon - @EliseStefanik seen briefly at leftmost podium
Going to live tweet the debate before a 4:00PM meeting

RT @AP: BREAKING: Trump says he'll be "signing something" on immigration, wants to keep migrant families together.
The current family separation policy is entirely the doing of the Trump administration. It is entirely within the power of the administration to stop this. There is no law, no requirement that mandates the caging of children. It is wrong, inhumane and un-American.

What happened in #SantaFe was a tragedy, one that in all likelihood was preventable. I am absolutely horrified to see that days like today have become so common in this nation. We must take action to stop this epidemic of gun violence in our schools.

Haspel must provide a reasonable answer on the extent of her involvement in the CIA's Thailand prison. If she cannot, she is not fit to hold the position.
