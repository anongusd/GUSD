@TheWantedEmcees @BettinaSumner Can't wait!
@Jordan_Sather_ I already told you! Update avatars to picks of the real people behind the accounts. Even if out dated. They will not touch for fear of lawsuits.	I've already contacted several via DM. I guess many wish to play martyr here. :(
@russ_ayers I hear u but recent actions are not good. I know human nature and I perceive this a vanity thing for those remaining. The 'ego train' will take you to Hell quicker then good intentions. Russ I never speak out or disagree except this one time. I see human error in play here. :(

@RyanAFournier I really like how you covered that. It was great! :)
@almostjingo I guess he gets the stupid stick award for the week. :(
@russ_ayers Go for what? I'm not the list. I only offered suggestions. I'm guessing because I'm not a financial supporter my words are falling on deaf ears. Makes me wonder. ;(
@1776Stonewall No offense intended but Get off the 'ego train'. I sent you a private message. You guys can play martyr or fight.
@TimRunsHisMouth @DonnaShelley2 Lol! That's what I thought. Bet he likes his old pay rate now. lol
@russ_ayers @Jordan_Sather_ I hear you Russ but I wipe my own ass. I don't wait for someone else to do it. We are required to be proactive.
@michellebullet1 Bannon had his 15 minutes. Next!
@steph93065 @NevadaJack2 @AOC Steph, you're talking to a 'valley girl' want a be. Lol!
@russ_ayers @Jordan_Sather_ Really? I doubt it. I'm talking about the ones on the 'hit list'. That is if this list is in fact real. Which is better? To play martyr or show courage? 	If one really believes their cause and knows others are depending on them why not try?
@russ_ayers @Jordan_Sather_ I agree Russ but look at the pattern. All the avatars don't have pics of real living people. To go after a person with a such a pic would open them up to a lawsuit! I've been trying to notify the ones on the list not yet hit. I wish they would humor me and at least try.
@Jordan_Sather_ Look at the avatars for the people on list! None of real living people. See the pattern?
@1776Stonewall Like she's a 'vally girl' but she's so totally NOT! lol
@imx007 You as well! :)
Please listen and RT to those currently involved. https://t.co/nseutw0GWP

@caholcom53 @customdeluxe79 @wikileaks @rogerwaters Sadly, that's the nature of the business.

@caholcom53 @customdeluxe79 @wikileaks @rogerwaters Well didn't Obama make that legal/ Via propaganda?
@caholcom53 @customdeluxe79 @wikileaks @rogerwaters Did they try to screw Trump?

@mimimayes13 That's correct. Which is why I was surprised he added her. I do see his reasoning as to why he did.
@mimimayes13 Oh I remember.
@mimimayes13 Yes but wasn't it prior to joining the Trump administration? don't get me wrong. Her tweet today shows her lack of loyalty.
Ok I'm going to debate this post cause I suspect Barr was brought on to help prosecute but while keeping the Bush name out of it. Just my thought and I'm aware I could be wrong. https://t.co/KGeHsDLrME

@mimimayes13 Ok I just did a quick read. She signed this back in 2015. Now that I think about this I remember hearing about it. When we rewrite history we lose who we are both good and bad. :(
@mimimayes13 Damn! Yeah, this is bad. I'm so sorry. :(

@MarthaB34710975 In fact, I will avoid them at all cost.
@michellebullet1 Good. A new home perhaps. Cause this one is going to shit.
@WBHChannel So sorry.
@RealSShawn17 I missed the drops but it will be no surprise if one one or more will hit the curb this coming week. From from I understand, an EO would bypass those roadblocks.

@outlawjw One word: Legally. Just one.

@BusyElves @ProtestChris I don't know. Tell us why.
@DanrolandDan You think like me!
@DanrolandDan That might be my case. I was kept locked in a room for 12 years. My experience was nothing like my son. We wanted so much to help him.

@FuctupMike I can't go there! I've saved so many.
@outlawjw Shit! girl here. Now with a boner! How is that possible? lol

@Sunny777Girl You always have my support! I see what's happening! People are losing their homes! Ca is actually my favorite state. Apparently it's also a favorite of the deep state. :(
Don't hate CA and VA! They are so screwed by the ones in control. :(
@Sunny777Girl God bless you for being able to still survive in Ca! A most beautiful state. That's why the dems want it! We so need Ca. The produce alone suppors so many states. So many want to scrape it. I will FIGHT for Ca and their people!
I don't need to be right. I need for the right things to be done!
@FreeSpeechRN i don't doubt it. i want to know! God bless the ones that share!!!!
@Sunny777Girl Go for it! I want to know!

@kill_rogue Only cause they don't see it. It time they will. Sadly few will admit.
@Karin_in_CA Another actor I won't support.
Don't fall for Pence not being seen or being invilved with women. It's not what you think. That slick MFer is at the hearth of child trafficing!
@YackyDoodleDnDy Your response deserves a RT.
Think about it. https://t.co/M2rIuHE5Re
@YackyDoodleDnDy You're correct!
@outlawjw I have no doubt! :(	sick motherfuckers!
Pence was invited to 2020 campain to keep him in check!
I am Not here to slam people. I'm here to share what I have learned!
@JesseNada441020 He's a fucken child mover! :(	He might not touch it but he moves it. I pray God deals with him soon!
Oh I lost some followers over my Pence statement. Question: why was he so accepted? Wake up!
@JesseNada441020 Look at his state. Real big on child trafficking! :(
@outlawjw So he fucks little kids? :(
@1776Stonewall @steph93065 The business channel is typically more factual.
I think Pence was suggested in the hopes that Trump would fail. Surprised. Trump kicked ass! So Pence sits back and waits.	I will never trust this man! Pence is deep state!

@5Strat I had been telling him this but it took hearing it from the doctor for it to hit home. :(
@5Strat I'm not sure but it's becoming normalized. Friday my husband had gone to the doctor. He's been having serious complications from the medicine he had been prescribed. During their discussions our doctor started praising the benefits of using fetal cells in many new drugs.
@GM062616 Which probably translates to: were executed for an unsuccessful launch.

@russ_ayers that explains much. :)

@frfrankpavone @MSPOA Actually it's been crickets. Thanks for reminding us. :)
@russ_ayers I so totally get that. Have you not seen my tweets? :)
@russ_ayers Lol! Smart ass! :)
@jujubee8mama8 It was covered as a bleeding vegan burger. no lie. :(
@jujubee8mama8 sounds so similar to me except that we raised our own meat. it's a big deal here when/if we put an animal down for purpose. On another note I make almost everything from scratch...….even down to Doritos! Lol
Why R we still discussing Northam?
@Robert_QSentMe No! for the record, I'm glad you said something. You got me off my ass to prove different. My hubby didn't believe me either until our doc brought the subject up.	I will find it.	#ThisShitIsReal
@backt0nature It works! lol
@jujubee8mama8 She even mentions Pepsi
@Robert_QSentMe Actually Robert if I can my notebook that has all the links I'll be good.	It's the one and only time I did that. :)	Now I just need to find the book.
@jujubee8mama8 I watched it and I remember when this was featured on Fox and Friends and possibly the Five. Real short segments on both shows. It was set to be targeted toward vegans.
Shocking! https://t.co/cljVObLRhc
@jujubee8mama8 I can do that. Thank God for timelines on Twitter. lol
@Robert_QSentMe It just requires re-digging. But all that data lost is horrible. I researched this for days prior. I'll find it again!
@jujubee8mama8 Do you have the link?
@Robert_QSentMe I had it! I had it all! I had where it was approved with Pepsco which was fought and won. Later it was introduced in another bill and passed in 2016. I'm having to retrieve it all! :(	Everything I've said to you is open source and on government sites. :(
@Robert_QSentMe You know Robert I had all this info saved and ready to deliver but it's no longer there so I'm n a major dig. I WILL FIND IT!
@LDknepper @NanaDeb42271069 I know. :(
@Jordan_Sather_ @mlhcromwell16 It's not even listed with the CDC. I believe you pointed that out.
@LDknepper @NanaDeb42271069 It's totally jacked up. :(
@Robert_QSentMe And I should add my husband was awakened this week to what I've been saying when our doctor started talking about the benefits of fetal tissue being used in foods and medicine. OUR DOCTOR said this!	Pretty sad.

@SoulOnJourney11 Same here. :(
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs I have 10 arches here and I'll gladly set you up a spot.
@Robert_QSentMe I respectfully disagree. I know what you are talking about. That was in fact shot down but was approved in another action. The first action involved Pepsi cola.
@TWalkingDWorld True.
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs Let's research this.
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs If you're really close would you be interested in trying implement our own? If we get it working then we set it up at both our locations.
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs We need to hook up!!!!!!
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs That I know. :(
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs PAT! Do you live in Ok?
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs I live right by there. Can you locate or find contact info?
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs What's tragic is that we've had this technology for a long time. :(
@55true4u Then 'they' killed him. :(
@highhopesUSA @StormIsUponUs You're so spot on!
@GinsburgDrunk @JesseNada441020 Apparently. :(
I've said it before I'll say it again. Aborted fetal tissue is in almost every snack you can think of. It's that good ol favor enhancer approved by the Obama administration in 2016.	Think of that when you open a bag of Doritos, (yes, in there). :(

I never really appreciated the real value of life until I saved one.	Perhaps that's the lesson we need to teach.
I say let Northam stay. 	He's lost face.	His voice is gone.	He does the Republican more good than you could ever guess.
@tracybeanz Blessings your way Tracy. Blessings your way. :)

@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump I suspect trump's announcement might have spurred Mueller's office to rebuke the Buzzfeed article. All of this is a distraction from what the American people already suspect to be true.
@mutts4me_sherri Yeah it usually takes several months to document but that's in the commericial field. Goverment has a different set of rules.
@M2Madness @RedestPill Yes!

@kill_rogue Any good lie has an element of truth.

@SaRaAshcraft @Annabarbe6 @prayingmedic @POTUS @GenFlynn I trust no one. Surprised you do. :(

@StormIsUponUs @belkkathy512 It is Joe. :)
@SecretAgentQ1 @rentonMagaUK Well an asshole is born every minute. Some are lucky enough to get on TV.
@occulturalism Ok. And......
@JesseNada441020 @1776Stonewall I will augue that the court system is so slow. It's horrible! It's designed to wear one down. If a person doesn't really know the system it's easy to lose faith and that's a fact. :(
@JesseNada441020 @1776Stonewall And God forbid if you speak your mind about him. Why should I or you trust any of them?
@JesseNada441020 @1776Stonewall Yeah I know. I sensed an attempt at distruction. This was before he was elected. Don't get me wrong. I totally support Trump. I just don't think we;re getting the whole story. My heart says we're being played. :(
@seanm850 We can trust all we want Sean but it's not going to happen until WE MAKE IT HAPPEN!
@seanm850 I don't trust any 'plan'.
@MikeBaliff1 I know but it's so hard to swallow.
@JesseNada441020 @1776Stonewall Fuck Tucker! He laughs at people too much. I don't like that.
@MikeBaliff1 I know! I'm so pissed!
@JesseNada441020 @1776Stonewall AMen! I did see his aura. Something I haven't seen in years but I saw two colors, white with pink at his head. I was told later that both colors were good but I didn't feel that. I sensed corruption trying to get to him. I can't completely explain but I do believe Trump knows Q.
I don't know about Q but there are some sharpe people out here connecting dots!	Thank God I know them! :)

@WWG_1WGA_ Amen sister! Why are we sugar coating this shit?
@russ_ayers Thanks Russ! :) I'm just hating my new phone. I thought I share stuff right away...NOT! lol

@deanbc1 This is a good thing!
@seanhannity @CorinnaBohme Not under oath I hear. :(
Once we figure out that all our wars have been goverment inspired we might just wake up. :(
@minxy99 LOL! Yep! :)
@DigitalMartyr1 I'm on the 'death' side. There is no cure for it. :(
@SosoMkosana @minxy99 Beautiful words of truth.
@crystalleight5 @lgmichael1 Have you not noticed that the government is complacent to us eating our own?
@Susieseeker A blessing to you! Susieq!
@ROYALMRBADNEWS @LoveThyTrump At least you said goodbye. lol. He didn't get that from me!
@MarthaB34710975 I know. You're right. :(

@ScottC20012 But didn't they do just that to Flynn?
@ScottC20012 I know! Protecting that basturd!
@mflynnJR @PRheydt @Comey His day is coming......
@MikeBaliff1 Well I have to be cool Mike. I'm in the F word phase right now. Hubby is laughing at me. I'm so pissed! lol.	I'll get over it.....
What? Why not? https://t.co/QGWZGzSZzT
@_realBlackTrump @tanglefootpines Hero in my book. :)
@paulsperry_ @k2patriot What? Why not?
@MikeBaliff1 Well they did transfer everyrhing. At least that's what I heard. I guess I need to download a few things so I can access them? :0
@israelistone @JesseNada441020 You're singing my song!
@MikeBaliff1 Yeah and this phone is old in their books. I couldn't even trade it in. lol
@MarthaB34710975 God bless you!
@MikeBaliff1 I actually had one ringtail die cause of a snake. The ringtail people did not believe me. It was a freak thing. :(	Mike I have so many stories.	I just need to get my pics off this new phone! I hate upgrades!
I have this new phone with a pretty cover and ALL my pics and I don't know to get them!	I hate upgrades!
@steph93065 No kidding1 :(
@MikeBaliff1 Minor cats! Have you ever heard of that pharse? The minors had them as friends when they went in the mines.
@JesseNada441020 Metz I'm lucky! I see it. But I got this way cause of who I am. Real disfuctional in my family so to keep me silent, I was aloud animals. I don't know what else to say. I talk to them like people. I don't understand them but they unferstand me. Even my USDA inspector saw it.
@MikeBaliff1 They are native to Texas and Calafornia. Before also in Oklahoma but not so much any more. It's a major lose. Better moucers then any cat and they're great for killing snakes!
Don't get me wrong, domestics are cool. I'm angry more people haven't erxperience other animals. Why is this so? Why?
I really dislike domestic animals. It's cause I've worked with exotics all my life. I was blessed to get their love. It wasn't bred into them. It was earned! That carries more value to me!
@Jordan_Sather_ OMG!
@MikeBaliff1 Not at all! They have size. Just little weight. They're like a dog crossed with a ferrat and a cat.
Learn from this! :) https://t.co/peiz6pw9i7
@MikeBaliff1 3lbs is average size. They have a bushy black and white tail. They typically hate people. Damn they hate there own kind. But when or if they bond with you it's unlike anything out there.
@jsolomonReports @Ramses03241956 No kidding! We're sick of it!
@DFBHarvard @FaytheJMM7 So spot on! :(
@CaplatypusC @russ_ayers Isn't this sort of true for all of all of us? When will we figure this out?
Oh I'm spilling tonight!
P{rayers for the unseen. The unknown. The unheard of. Just a little prayer please. It's so powerful in numbers. I've seen it first hand. Thank you for your effort! :)
@QTAnon1 Hahaha!
@mymaxamoose @5Strat @get4208 Yes! I'm on it!
@MikeBaliff1 Did you know that ringtail cats love bananas? As do coatis and kinkajous. They're crazy for them. :)
Wow! I can tell critter stories until I get my new phone working. Then I can do show and tell.	Right now it's all tell. :(
Who the hell is Bixy? I just want to get my pics! I hate new phones!
Take this for what it is. I have a pair of ringtails that never raised their young. I found a baby on the floor. Raised it for 31 days. It died. I got ugly with the mother. Cussed her out. Next year she raised her babies. Has done so ever since.
@rowdy_tt @WomenForTrump4 @EntheosShines @AllenWest @MikaelThalen @StevePieczenik That was bad days when it happened. We had just moved here. :(
@LisaMei62 Put her traitor list.
@minxy99 You will see the pics! lol! I promise! I'm so excited! :)
@5Strat Wow! You're welcome! We're getting hit hard. I know you know what I'm saying. We are all in this together. We're all so different yet we want the same for all. We have to stay strong! We have to!
@minxy99 He didn't like my hubby but he was cool! I have picS! I just need to get them off this new phone!
@5Strat You are in my prayers! You're special you know!
@minxy99 Actually I was asked to pick up one. They didn't want to kill it but they were concerned about their stock. I contacted the state. Showed where I would keep it and the state said ok. I dealt with it as a new pet.
@SoulOnJourney11 Yes. Thank you Mary Mo!
@minxy99 Yes!
Right now what is here is some ringtail cats, a pair of blond coaties, a pair of Artics, two pairs of marmosets, several tortoses as well as other animals. I recentenly saved a baby marmost. I was ready to let it die. My husband said he knew I could save it and I did! :)
The coaties! The Artic foxes! The marmosets! The rigntails! The skunks! The skunks apear to be borning but I think there is more to them. :)
@RCoonhound I said thank you already but I mean it! This new phone is evil. It does have my pics which means I can share them as soon as I figure it out! lol
Damn! I actually have people that care here. So hard to believe. i have to get this new phone working! I'm in shock about the animals. So many stories to tell! :)
@RCoonhound Oh thank you soo much! New phone now so I'm trying to get it going!	New phones suck!
The ony reason I accepted a new phone is because I want to share my animal pics! I so hate this new phone!
@minxy99 No I don't but I have stories to tell you about a red tailed hawk that ended up here! Wow!
@5Strat Really? It's my whole life. I've met so many animals! Zoos have contacted me about said animals! My whole life has been being with these guys! No ideal people wanted to know. It's everyday to me! Bless you!
@SamusAran2020 Share them! :)
@minxy99 I had a lot of people block me cause I said I had a monkey. That was my reference because I actually have a monkey, (you know this should never be a reason to block another.
@SamusAran2020 Sharknado! OMG! What a week! I think we are friends now! :)
To the people thatwant to know about my critters: Thank you so very much! Now I have to do some chores but I'll be back. :)
@minxy99 Oh thank you so much! I really felt I was a bad guy for a while. Thank you! Thank you again!
@minxy99 :)	Wow! So happy!
@minxy99 Oh I'll follow you back! Just waiting on my new phone. So many pics I want to share. A real pleasure to meet you! :)
@SamusAran2020 I know! Sci fi channel! lol
Ringtails! OMG! You got to learn about rigntails! They aren't for everyone. But to get one to bond with you is a gift from GOD! Really! They are my blessing!
Look up ringtail cats! :)	OMG! So many stories about ringtails!	So many!.....
@SibylBrown11 Really!? I have such wonderful animals here! I see them every day but I've never told their stories. Not So sure I could do them justice but I want to. Thank you so much for letting me know. :)
@mitchellvii @WWG_1WGA_ Fuck that noise. Move on.....
@5Strat @realDonaldTrump Whoa! So you see it to?
I'm blessed beyond words. I have to remind myself this!
I'm getting a new phone and then I can share pics of my critter friends! Damn! :)
@5Strat I have a lot of critters. Not as many as before. But yes. They are my life. Not much to show I guess. lol
They're really cool animals. lol. Even USDA couldn't wrap their heads around our interaction. ;)
@Michael19711992 @WWG_1WGA_ @GOPChairwoman @POTUS @SenMajLdr @SteveScalise @Jim_Jordan BAM! That's how it's done! :)

@5Strat @LBF777 I know! Can you believe that?
@SamusAran2020 Me too. :)
I'm on the fence here. I want to share my animal stories but does anyone want to here them? I'm often blocked cause I'm a conseverative with a monkey. Ca you let me know?
@5Strat @LBF777 I used to think that. Not so sure any more. :(
@steph93065 @DailyCaller Steph it's the 'deep state' fighting back. This shit is viscous!

@lori8288 @PolishPatriotTM Oh yeah, totally get that! No doubt there but the leaders of both sides have already done the photo opt and that opens doors. Rocket man has made it a point to display to president Trump that he is doing his part. :)
@TWalkingDWorld I'm thankful for the walking dead! :)
@tracybeanz It's really not so shocking when you stop to remember that the division is leader driven. Many have relatives on the other side.	In fact, I would wager that our conflicts are driven by those in power.

Another suggestion:	Just scrap the 2 counties that didn't comply.
My suggestion regarding Broward country:	Have  those residents revote in another county that is compliant with voting rules. Then count them.

Wonder what's up. https://t.co/HOqnKzJmkm
@dutchess_becky It's sad. :(
@unseen1_unseen While at the same time offering them a carrot. :)
@RealJamesWoods @AMemedna Actually I feel it's more of a no win situation. :(
@JKirking Yes. :)
@PamelaUnplugged @cis_gracchus Lol!

@colette_palomba @crystal_night20 @marklevinshow Every town needs it's jester. :(
@almostjingo @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump Yes he has! How quickly people forget! :(	He was one of few who had actually read the TPP and knew what it would do to our country. :(
@LizCrokin @MilspecP I've always liked and held the highest regard for Sessions. That has never changed.	I trust Sessions. :)
@GATrumpTrain @sookie1_ @FoxNews So proud of you! I'm weening myself from them cause of Hannity.
@SoulOnJourney11 Are you implying something was in the works? Cause it you were I would agree. :0
@danpalka You choose the latter. We're done here. :(
@kill_rogue Of course it does. Same as with most social networks. :(
@danpalka And I already presented you with facts in a previous reply but you choice to ignore. Now. do you want to have an intelligent conversation or do you prefer having a superior, subordinate attitude? I do not have time for the latter. :(
@danpalka The term Nationalist is neither what you perceive or been conditioned to believe. President Trump was addressing how the reporter was presenting the question. It was framed as a set up. You're welcomed to listen to the entire meeting and not just an edited clip. All in the optics
@unseen1_unseen Know the beast, deal with the demon. They've been warned and they will fail.
@hfinch63 It's sad that people don't seem to retain info. :(
@danpalka Fair answer. But you had time enough to make a flip response instead of presenting facts.
@Rambobiggs Says who?
We all saw it! #FoxIsDirty https://t.co/WjdiFylJOs

@unseen1_unseen It's a beautiful thing. It also got them to stop talking about that 'blue wave'. Lol!
