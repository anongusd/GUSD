@celinedryan Agreed, it‚Äôs no different than introducing yourself and saying you‚Äôre a celebrity. If you‚Äôre a true celebrity or a true influencer, people ‚Äúwill know.‚Äù
@AndyGrewal Have you not read the bible? God is described as "a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully." - @RichardDawkins
@ConceptualJames Via the Washington Examiner?? Let's be real. I do agree there is a need for a solid, reasonable, left and I'm sad to say that I just don't think that anyone is the democrat's current arsenal of presidential contenders has all of the elements it will take to defeat Trump in 2020.
@jimgeraghty Trump literally said on video that because he's a celebrity he could just grab women by the pussy and do whatever he wants to them. People elected him President just a week or so after that. Forget the yearbook picture of blackface, Trump wears blackface to work every day.
@TheTweetOfGod Billions of people legitimately believe that this is the word of God..."paying a woman 50 shekels of silver" for raping her and violating her. Lest we forget, he must also marry the woman because he raped her. I bet she'd just love that! Phew, at least my rapist has to marry me!
@thehill Lindsey Graham has truly lost it. He has jumped the shark.
@thehill Are you arguing that he should get the equivalent of a ‚Äúparticipation ribbon‚Äù at your old junior high science fair? Request is granted.
@DavidAFrench Are you joking me?? Pizza day was the best day ever compared to the other slop they‚Äôd usually serve.
@gtconway3d Or as Fox News and the cult following of Trumpeters out there would say, ‚ÄúBest President ever!! Trump has accomplished more in 2 years than all of the past Presidents this country has ever had in over 200+ years combined!! He knows everything better than anyone else does.‚Äù ü§™
@IlhanMN I agree with you here. However, as an American, democratic Jew, I‚Äôm still disturbed by your tweet re: ‚Äúmay Allah awaken the people...etc.‚Äù I know you apologized, but I‚Äôm just being honest here in that I have mixed opinions about you and am torn on some of your views / beliefs.
@AriFleischer @davidcicilline The Senate doesn‚Äôt have the votes to remove him from office. Impeaching him might just help him in the same way that Bill Clinton‚Äôs numbers and popularity only went up after he was impeached!
@jonathanalter I‚Äôll believe it when I see it. Unless SDNY really shocks us and pulls a rabbit out of a hat and has the chutzpah to go after the Pres? One can only hope.
@JoyceWhiteVance @gtconway3d @neal_katyal As a lifelong Democrat, I unfortunately just don‚Äôt think we have a candidate that has what it takes to beat him in 2020. I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but as shocking as it was when he first won, I just think we‚Äôre in for a similar ‚Äúshock‚Äù (which won‚Äôt really be a shock at all).
@thehill Yeah, OK, good luck with that. In all seriousness, it would take a miracle from God (pun intended).
@NathanLerner I'm a democrat and will get behind whomever the party chooses to run against Trump, but I just don't think Beto is the guy or that he's ready for the Presidency. When he said he would absolutely tear down the existing border walls on the southern border, he pretty much lost me.
@JoyceWhiteVance @PreetBharara Haha, yes you do. On some level üòÄ
@JoyceWhiteVance @JoyceWhiteVance Do you legitimately think that the judge will revoke Roger Stone‚Äôs bond and put him in pre-trial detention for this statement? What‚Äôs your prediction?

@cpugh29 @HamiltonMorris @BKLYNlibrary I‚Äôve tried Ketamine IV infusions after a doctor recommended them and they were definitely a bit of a ‚Äútrip‚Äù while you were on it and the IV was in your arm, but ultimately not something I would personally keep doing as I didn‚Äôt find them especially ‚Äútherapeutic.‚Äù

@gtconway3d But the question is how does the polling compare to past presidential candidates and their polling at the time, outcomes, etc. Any insights? Thx!

@thehill Honestly, at this point, she should just be saying, ‚Äú Look dude, I‚Äôm a bitch, get over it. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm running on. Being a bad ass bitch boss lady.‚Äù Probably more effective and more likely to attract voters. People are drawn to raw honesty, take a page out of Trump's playbook

@CubeSteve @sherlockmichael Awesome, I see we've arrived back at the dictionary definitions of agnostics. Good chat.
@CubeSteve @sherlockmichael Plenty of people believe that God can't be "known," but still believe in God anyway. That's why they call it "faith" and not reason/logic. An agnostic believes there very well "may" be a God (neither faith nor disbelief). Atheists believe there is no God.
@sherlockmichael @CubeSteve This is the dictionary definition of an agnostic. Do you disagree with it? Just because philosophical issues require analysis doesn't negate the fact that there are also definitions for philosophical concepts or positions. Just like "theist" has a dictionary definition.
@CubeSteve @sherlockmichael From the dictionary: "a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God." You're free to challenge all dictionaries and say they are wrong
@CubeSteve @sherlockmichael So, people must either make a decision and either believe that aliens exists in some far away galaxy or make the decision that aliens do not and cannot exists anywhere in our universe. Saying, "I don't know" is unacceptable to you. It's actually the most appropriate position.
@CubeSteve @sherlockmichael You're misunderstanding the definition by saying "not not believe." Again, agnostics acknowledge there may or may not be a god. Just like someone saying there may or may not be alien life outside our galaxy. It is not "logically impossible" to say or believe that.
@sherlockmichael This is nearly completely unintelligible. I can see you‚Äôre now adding qualifications to your flawed argument l, but it really needs clarity to be considered coherent in explaining what you mean.
@sherlockmichael Your premises and logic are flawed. Agnostics = neither belief NOR DISBELIEF in God, so you shouldn‚Äôt have made the deduction that you therefore don‚Äôt believe in God (which I see you put asterisks on). Agnostics acknowledge there may or may not be a God, NOT that there is no God.
@AnnCoulter And there goes Ann Coulter. For a while you had us going there regarding Trump‚Äôs handling of the border wall, or ‚Äúmishandling,‚Äù rather. But, I see you‚Äôre ‚Äúback‚Äù to being yourself. Party on.
@RepKevinBrady We just had the biggest Fentanyl bust in US History and it came through a legal port of entry. The El Chapo trial also showed us that the largest drug cartel was pushing their drugs through legal ports of entry. https://t.co/37TplPHfc6
@charliekirk11 That‚Äôs all just fake news. Am I right or am I right?
@thehill Seriously, we aren't North Korea over here. If any news channel or media outlet doesn't agree with his views or is in any way critical of him, he calls it "fake news" and now "the enemy of the people." Only media outlets that agree and endorse everything he says are "legit."
@DanCrenshawTX It works both ways, if only you were fair and balanced.
@CharlieKae17 @CNN Um, you literally just contradicted yourself. You said in the CNN quote that the analyst asked "Will he be subject to rape?" That is in no way "promoting" him getting raped, can you not read? Oftentimes, prisoners are put into "protective custody" while in jail to for own safety.
@PsyPost Seems intuitive.
@ianbremmer yikes.
@GOPChairwoman Relax, she called it ‚Äúaspirational.‚Äù Seems like you‚Äôre reaching a bit. A little worried about @SenAmyKlobuchar it seems...hmm
@BarbaraBoxer He only hires the best people!!
@Asa789 @Pgh_Pete @ccpatter74 @NatashaBertrand Happily, hopefully the next person will be coherent and make sense.
@Asa789 @Pgh_Pete @ccpatter74 @NatashaBertrand That's completely unintelligible, but great.
@Asa789 @Pgh_Pete @ccpatter74 @NatashaBertrand The Judge explained the reason when she issued it. I assume you've read it. Right? Of course. So, the question really is, explain why and what part of it you disagree with? We're waiting :)
