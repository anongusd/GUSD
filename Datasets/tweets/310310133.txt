Wonderful time at the Annual Chief Marshal’s Banquet, and congratulations to this year’s Chief Marshal Lt. Colonel John Beatty, US Army who served our country for 23 years. Thank you @SBAWVC for hosting - great way to kick off the month of St. Patrick’s Day celebrations! https://t.co/dhPGud8uuC

(1/2) Great to be at the Jimmy Flaherty Kick-Off Breakfast this morning. It was an honor to present the Henry Knox Unsung Hero Award to my friend Fran Dempsey, who owns one of the most trustworthy, helpful and reliable auto repair shops in South Boston. https://t.co/1myPDciMA3
Proud to join my colleagues to pass #HR1112 which would enforce a new process that allows the FBI more time to conduct a thorough background check on firearm purchases, extending the hurried 3-day period to a 10-day investigation. Another commonsense Bill to combat gun violence.
Yesterday the House passed #HR8 which would require universal background checks on all potential gun sales so individuals who are a danger to themselves and others are no longer able to purchase a gun. This is the first major legislation passed to address gun control since 1994.
Tune in to CNN Prime Time with @ChrisCuomo to hear me discuss Michael Cohen’s testimony in the Oversight Committee today.
Republicans ran away from the truth, and now Democrats are trying to bring the truth to the American people. #CohenTestimony https://t.co/ZhQZwj6yP0
For two years, House Republicans refused to bring any of Trump’s convicted or indicted associates before the Oversight Committee, so today for the first time during the Trump administration, we have one witness who voluntarily is coming forward to testify. @OversightDems
Today the @OversightDems are hearing Michael Cohen’s testimony regarding conflicts of interest and illegal payments involving President Trump. The American people deserve to know the truth about their President’s actions and character. No more lies. https://t.co/0LW9TPofDu
The use of the same flight paths while landing cause relentless noise and pollution over the same houses, schools, towns and neighborhoods every day. Enough is enough. #Quietskies. https://t.co/jOX4FZa2EE
Today in @TransportDems we pushed back on the use of the RNAV NextGen flight system used at Logan Airport, which forces tens of thousands of planes to use the exact same flight paths over the Towns of Milton, Hull, Dorchester &amp; South Boston when landing. https://t.co/jOX4FZa2EE
(2/2) The United States government should never forcibly separate children from their parents. Full stop. It is now our responsibility to ensure every family is reunited.
(1/2) Today @OversightDems voted to issue subpoenas to require DOJ, HHS and DHS to provide information about the children that were separated from their parents during the Trump Administration’s child separation policy.
As sea levels steadily rise and carbon emissions continue to escalate, we must take federal action now to confront climate change and make our Nation’s infrastructure more resilient. #ActOnClimate
Local leaders, like Mayor Martin Walsh of Boston and Mayor Tom Koch of Quincy have been vigilant in urging sustainable solutions to protect coastal communities from the effects of climate change. #ActOnClimate
Today @TransportDems are holding a hearing on how investing in federal infrastructure resiliency could help mitigate the impacts of climate change. During recent epic storms we have seen firsthand how the Commonwealth’s critical infrastructure has been threatened and undermined. https://t.co/ORcMNcVhED
Always enjoy joining Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on WGBH Boston Public Radio. This week we discussed the Mueller investigation, my priorities as Chairman of the National Security subcommittee and other Oversight Committee responsibilities: https://t.co/HaArriHfzy
No President should be allowed to subvert the Constitutional authority granted to the elected Representatives of the people. With 227 cosponsors, Joint Resolution 46 must first pass the House and then will be voted on in the Senate.
Proud to join my colleagues as a cosponsor of the H.J. Resolution 46 to prevent the President from removing funding from existing programs for National Defense that were authorized by Congress and he already approved.
ABC Dallas News did a story about why a small town with no airport has over 1,000 registered aircrafts. My Bill, the Aircraft Ownership Transparency Act, would help address these serious national security risks posed by our aircraft registration system. https://t.co/YSbNc3lu1I

(2/2) - such as requiring universal background checks, banning high capacity clips, restricting people on the “no fly” list from purchasing firearms, etc. We can honor their memory by fighting to make our communities safer from gun violence. #NeverAgain
(1/2) Today marks one year since the worst high school shooting in American history, where 14 students &amp; 3 staff members lost their lives in a senseless tragedy in Parkland, FL. We can honor them by passing common sense gun reforms to #EndGunViolence -
H.R. 1201 would also require federal agencies to develop corresponding plans to address the impact of climate change on their national security missions and to update these plans at least annually. https://t.co/9oEvPm1Pqz
The Climate Change National Security Strategy Act would ensure our government actively prepares for the impacts of climate change in the development of relevant national security policies.
Climate change must become a bipartisan national security priority now. Rapidly rising sea levels threaten our power grid, our water systems and vital infrastructure. That is why I introduced my Bill, the Climate Change National Security Strategy Act, H.R. 1201.
Last month I signed on as a cosponsor of #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. This is a first step to combat gun violence, which killed nearly 40,000 Americans last year. Requiring background checks on all firearm sales is a commonsense law we must implement now.

I’m proud that my Democratic colleagues kept fighting and refused to surrender to someone who showed such blatant disrespect for America’s workers. https://t.co/5rk0fL6Bbk
It was the President’s reckless and irresponsible decision to shut the government down and use federal workers as hostages, forcing air traffic controllers and TSA employees to work without pay. https://t.co/63p2iQ5ohF
The lapse in federal funding burdened our overworked, unpaid FAA employees and disrupted safety-related work. H.R. 1108 will ensure that doesn’t happen again by providing funding from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for all FAA activities in the event of a government shutdown.
Today the Subcommittee on Aviation held our first hearing about the impacts of President Trump’s shutdown on U.S. Aviation where I spoke in strong support of H.R. 1108, which would allow the airline industry to operate during government shutdowns. @TransportDems
Guns with a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition have been used in some of the most horrific mass shootings in American history. Congress must act now and pass these modest, common sense laws so this history does not repeat itself. @RepTedDeutch
Today my colleagues and I took legislative action to address the spate of mass shootings in America and introduced the Keep Americans Safe Act. This Bill would prohibit the transfer, importation and possession of magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
More than 100 million people, or 83% of American workers, do not have paid family leave through their jobs and we must ensure people who work can take the time they need to address serious health and caregiving needs. #FAMILYAct
Proud to join my colleagues as a co-sponsor of the Family And Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would create a strong and inclusive national family and medical leave insurance program. #FAMILYAct
The Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, H.R. 1065, will	also allow more efficient adoption of evolving technologies. Sincere thanks to Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) for his great support. @RepCummings
The enhanced national security clearance process provided in my Bill, H.R. 1065, will better protect government workers, federal facilities and sensitive government information from malign individuals who may seek to threaten our National Security.
Very thankful for the support of my House colleagues today in passing my Bill, the Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, which now heads to the Senate.

(2/2) While the State has spent over $500m to aid repair efforts, the Federal Government must do more to facilitate commerce, protect the public and to make our airports, seaports, rail, roads and bridges more resilient to climate change, and we must make it a priority now. https://t.co/6VZK0j531N

Rather than spending precious time and resources trying to deploy a military force into outer space, the President should focus on doing his job by nominating qualified ambassadors to these important posts.
This year more than 150 military generals and admirals wrote a letter to President Trump to express the importance of strong diplomacy in keeping America safe and keeping our men and women off the battlefield.
Meanwhile President Trump has proposed cutting the State Dept budget by 30 percent as these posts remain vacant.
... however, 18 months into his administration, Trump has failed to nominate ambassadors to dozens of nations, including countries where U.S. diplomacy is absolutely critical: 	Egypt	Honduras	Jordan	Libya	Mexico	Qatar	Saudi Arabia	Turkey

I will continue to fight to ensure that workers have dignity, fairness, and a strong voice in the workplace.
This decision undermines decades of precedent that protects the freedom of public service workers like teachers, police officers, and firefighters to negotiate for fair pay and safe workplaces. Unions are a force for good and are critical to rebuilding the middle class.
Today the Supreme Court ruled against unions’ right to collect fees for services they are required to provide to all workers.
H.R. 6136 was no “compromise” as the Republicans claimed – it was an attempt to cut down on legal immigration while addressing none of the real issues with our current immigration policy.
It also would have made it more difficult for people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek asylum in the U.S. – a tenet our country was founded upon and that U.S. immigration law guarantees.
This bill would have also ended the program that allows U.S. citizens to sponsor their siblings and married children for legal immigration to the U.S.
H.R. 6136 would have ended the visa lottery program – a legal and effective program that treats immigrants from different regions of the globe equally and carefully vets applicants before they are granted green cards.
Today I voted no on the immigration bill that was defeated in the House. Here’s why:
Three years ago marriage equality became the law of the land, but #LGBTQ people still face discrimination across this country. I urge my colleagues to pass the #EqualityAct to prohibit housing, employment, and other discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Wells Fargo robbed customers by setting up fake accounts and charging unauthorized fees. They were fined $1 billion. But then to the rescue came the Republican tax bill to benefit WF more than any other bank. Meanwhile regular working Americans get only a temporary tax cut. https://t.co/7A6U1CRcZD
H.R. 4760 includes similar policies that would curtail legal immigration, like ending the visa lottery program and reducing the number of citizens and legal permanent residents who can sponsor family members for green cards.
H.R. 6136 is no “compromise” as the Republicans claim – it’s an attempt to cut down on legal immigration while addressing none of the real issues with our current immigration policy.
H.R. 6136 would also make it more difficult for people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries to seek asylum in the U.S. – a tenet our country was founded upon and that U.S. immigration law guarantees.
This bill would also end the program that allows U.S. citizens to sponsor their siblings and married children for legal immigration to the U.S.
H.R. 6136 would end the visa lottery program – a legal and effective program that treats immigrants from different regions of the globe equally and carefully vets applicants before they are granted green cards.
I am opposed to both immigration bills being voted on in the House tomorrow. Neither of these bills would help fix the current issues we face in our immigration system.
If Republicans are serious about ending the separation of children and parents at the border, they should help us pass this bill and send it to @POTUS for his signature. #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct

In December I stopped by to speak with some folks who were outside the FCC in Washington to demand a free and open internet. We must continue to raise our voices until we have overturned the FCC’s harmful decision. https://t.co/VmoQthZwDV
There has been a groundswell of support to #SaveTheInternet since the @FCC decided to reverse #NetNeutrality rules in December. Last week the Senate voted to overturn the decision, and this week I joined my colleagues to petition House leadership to let us vote to do the same.

Governing is about making choices and decisions. This is a major health crisis. This is something the White House needs to pay attention to and be held accountable for.
Yesterday I introduced an amendment to H.R. 5925 that would hold the Trump administration accountable for repeatedly missing this deadline by requiring them to report directly to Congress if there is any further delay and explain why the strategy was not produced.
Congress authorized a funding increase of $3.2B for opioid addiction prevention and treatment. But we cannot just throw money at this problem without a strategy. It's the responsibility of @POTUS and executive branch agencies to articulate and coordinate a cohesive national plan.
The President is required by law to release a National Drug Control Strategy in February of each year, but he missed that deadline in 2017 and again this year. Congress must make sure this does not happen again.
The opioid epidemic is taking 115 American lives a day. We are facing a devastating public health emergency and it is deeply troubling that 16 months after taking office, the Trump administration still has not introduced a National Drug Control Strategy to combat this crisis. https://t.co/Br1UmPXMrs

It is shameful that Congress is weakening rules that protect American taxpayers and the U.S. economy. #S2155
#S2155 weakens critical consumer protections that were put in place after the financial crisis and makes it easier for banks to issue the risky home loans that led to the financial crisis.
#S2155 makes it more likely that big banks will resume risky behavior and that taxpayers will once again be required to bail out the biggest banks when they fail.
Today I voted against #S2155 because it is another big give-away to the nation’s biggest banks.
My heart aches for the families and friends of the Stoughton students involved in yesterday's car crash in East Bridgewater. My prayers are with you as you mourn this tragic loss.
Democrats have proposed numerous common-sense gun safety bills that would help make our children safer, but Republican leadership refuses to bring these bills to the House floor for a vote. Congressional leadership needs to allow us to vote and protect our kids.
My prayers are with the victims of the tragedy in Santa Fe, TX, their families, and the courageous first responders. It is outrageous that there has been another school shooting in America with absolutely no effort from congressional leadership to pass any gun safety measures.
Just months after giving massive tax breaks to corporations and adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt, Republicans are shamefully trying to pay for it by cutting food aid to children and struggling Americans.
Today I voted against reducing food assistance for children, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. The #GOPFarmBill would have cut free school meals for 265,000 low-income kids.
Today the Senate voted to overturn the @FCC reckless decision to end #NetNeutrality. The House votes next and it will be a tough fight. We must continue to raise our voices in support of a free and open internet.

It is important that members of Congress have ready access to this data so we can monitor the effectiveness of our strategy in the region and that the American people are fully informed.

While I fully support this bill, there is much more work to be done, and we must keep our government open and working to address all of America’s priorities.
... $8.8 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which rejects President Trump’s attempt to reduce the EPA’s budget by 31 percent.
... $80 billion for national defense, including a 2.4 percent cost-of-living pay increase for our sons and daughters in uniform.
... $37.1 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for medical research – a $3 billion increase in funding.
... $10 billion in new infrastructure funding, including increases of $2.55 billion for the federal highway program, $1 billion for TIGER grants, which fund road, transit and maritime projects, and $600 million for rural broadband infrastructure.
... $13 billion for Special Education Part B State Grants (IDEA), an increase of $275 million in funding.
... $9.9 billion for Head Start, which is $610 million more than 2017 funding.
... $5.2 billion for Child Care and Development Block Grants, which is a $2.37 billion increase over 2017 funding.
... More than $6 billion for WIC – the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children – which helps low-income families afford food, health care, and nutritional education.
... This provides two years of funding for screening, preventative care, mental health services, and other essential care for nearly one million Massachusetts residents regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.
... $5.4 billion in total funding for all of our fantastic Community Health Centers across the country and in the 8th District, from Brockton, Dorchester, South Boston and the North End to Quincy and Hull and beyond.
... and this funding will help institutions like the Gavin Foundation's Cushing House in South Boston and recovery home in Quincy continue to combat the opioid crisis until we end this devastating epidemic once and for all.
... A $3.2 billion increase in funding for opioid addiction prevention and treatment. Nearly 2,000 people in Massachusetts died of opioid-related causes in 2017...
... This funding increases the chance that necessary renovations at the VA hospitals in Brockton and West Roxbury get done sooner, giving our military veterans the care they need and deserve when they return home.
... A $7 billion increase in funding for veterans’ health care and other priorities, including $2 billion for VA hospital maintenance and construction projects.

We must continue to invest in this key part of our nation's social safety net, so today I proposed an amendment to make sure Congress includes sufficient funding for public housing in next year’s budget.
The Trump administration’s budget cuts the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative – an essential program that helps revitalize severely distressed public housing.
I know firsthand what a blessing public housing can be for families struggling to find a safe, affordable place to live: I grew up in the Old Colony Housing Project in South Boston – recently renamed the Anne M. Lynch Homes, after my mom.

We cannot wait for another tragedy at a school or a church or an office to act. We must vote on these bills so members of Congress can be held accountable and, hopefully, create new laws that will keep our children and our loved ones safe from gun violence.
The Select Committee on Gun Violence Prevention would investigate causes of mass shootings, the background check system, closing loopholes that give domestic abusers access to firearms, and the implementation of gun violence prevention laws, while respecting the 2nd Amendment.
The Gun Show Loophole Closing Act would require purchases at gun shows to be subject to the same background checks that are required at gun stores.
The Handgun Trigger Safety Act would authorize grants for the development of new technology that allows only an authorized user to fire a handgun. The legislation would also require that newly manufactured handguns include this technology.
The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act would make it easier for federal law enforcement to go after people who buy guns for those who are prohibited from buying guns by making such purchases a felony offense.
The Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act would ban the sale or possession of bump stocks like those used by the shooter in the Las Vegas attack last fall. These devices effectively turn semi-automatic rifles into automatic weapons.
The Keep Americans Safe Act would prohibit large-capacity magazines like the ones used in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is endorsed by law enforcement organizations like the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association.
...But Republican leadership has prevented these bills from even coming to the House floor for a vote. In this session of Congress alone, Republican leadership has refused to vote on dozens of bills including:
No one gun law will prevent every shooting in our country, but there are actions we can take to reduce gun violence and save lives. As this epidemic of gun violence has progressed, many members of Congress have introduced legislation that would keep Americans safer....
Thank you to @BetterMarkets for all the work you do to give a voice to the concerns of American consumers and individual investors. https://t.co/0G0RVnuHGM
No single law will prevent gun violence, but we owe it to victims, their families, and the American people to act. Common-sense gun laws will make Americans safer.
Today we again mourn the loss of life due to gun violence at one of our nation’s schools. This is the 18th school shooting this year.
Community health centers like South Boston Community Health provide vital care to 27 million Americans, and they rely on federal funding to do it. Congress ought to pass long-term funding for these centers – not continue funding for a year or two at a time. https://t.co/GVIoHJzO4D

I voted NO on the House continuing resolution because it provides inadequate resources for veterans, community health centers, the fight against the opioid epidemic, and #DACA recipients. We cannot keep funding the government weeks at a time.
We cannot continue to fund the government a few weeks at a time. We need a long-term funding bill that includes resources for veterans, community health centers, and the fight against the opioid epidemic.
The government funding bill fails to address critical needs in Mass. and beyond: funding for community health centers, resources to fight the opioid epidemic, and a permanent fix for DACA recipients.

Wishing you and your family a very happy New Year. I look forward to continuing to serve the 8th Congressional District in 2018. Please keep in touch with our office about the issues most important to you.
Merry Christmas to you and your families. Sending warm wishes and thanks to those in our armed forces who are away from family this holiday season. Thank you for your service.
The House just passed a bill that simply pushes a government shutdown into next month and inadequately addresses overdue priorities like VA funding and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This is NO way to run a government.
Sent a letter to Deputy AG Rosenstein urging him to allow Special Counsel Mueller to continue investigation of the Trump campaign. Mr. Mueller has bipartisan support and should be allowed to continue without political influence or threats to his authority. https://t.co/dwoaf1ct7X
On days like today, after watching Republicans pass one of the most shameful bills in recent history, it is good to have a reminder of what democracy is supposed to be about: serving the public good, morality, and truth. https://t.co/VtaUKmSj5Y
This is what happens when you try to jam a massive tax overhaul through Congress at the last minute: mistakes. Clearly Republicans are not giving this bill or the American people the consideration they deserve. https://t.co/D2Y4fd5Fja
Congress should be creating a tax system that helps the middle class and hard-working families, but instead Republicans just jammed through a plan that will help corporations and the wealthy while raising taxes on millions of hard-working Americans.
The @FCC will vote this morning on #NetNeutrality rules. We must say NO to handing power to big corporations at the expense of public access to information. I am calling on Chairman @AjitPaiFCC to keep our internet free and open to all.

Our country is facing a public health crisis due to gun violence, but the House is voting to allow states with the weakest gun laws to override concealed carry laws in states like MA, which have common sense laws in place to protect their citizens. I will be voting NO on H.R. 38.

Changes to our tax system will affect every American. Congress should work together to create a system that benefits hard working families. Instead R’s are jamming through a plan that benefits corporations and the ultra-wealthy.
Republicans want to lower the corporate tax rate while raising taxes on millions in the middle class. The #GOPTaxPlan is bad for working families.
Residents of MA’s 8th District claim an average of $15,000 in state and local tax deductions. The #GOPTaxPlan would eliminate the itemized deduction for these taxes, disproportionally hurting residents of MA and other high-tax states.
This week I cosponsored House Resolution 630, which requires members of Congress and employees to complete workplace harassment training. This won’t end harassment, but it’s an important first step to making necessary changes to the current system. https://t.co/njrPvaBEG0

Taking away #NetNeutrality gives telecom companies control over which websites and services consumers can access. We should NOT be handing power to major cable companies at the expense of public access to information.
I support free, open, equal and democratic access to the web and oppose any attempts by the FCC to repeal #NetNeutralityِ rules.
Happy #Thanksgiving. While we have much to be thankful for in our country, it is a time to remember those who may be struggling. I am very thankful for the opportunity to serve the families of the 8th Congressional District of Massachusetts.

Seniors spend nearly 20% of their income on health care expenses. The #GOPTaxPlan would eliminate the medical expense deduction many seniors use to get relief from their medical bills.
We should be working together to come up with a tax plan that benefits the middle class and hard working families. Instead Republicans are helping corporations and the wealthy by jamming the #GOPTaxPlan through Congress.
The #GOPTaxPlan gives tax breaks to corporations on the backs of hard working, middle class Americans.
Homebuyers in MA would be hit hard by the #GOPTaxPlan, which would eliminate the mortgage interest deduction above $500k
36 million middle class working families will see tax increases under the #GOPTaxPlan
The #GOPTaxPlan hurts middle-class families in MA by repealing state and local tax deduction, which is claimed by 1/3 MA residents
It is time for Congress to take action and pass common-sense gun legislation. These tragedies are preventable. We must do our jobs and protect American lives.
No single law will prevent gun violence, but we owe it to victims and their families to act. Common-sense gun control legislation will make Americans safer.
There was another tragic shooting yesterday. As we pray for the victims and their families, we must adopt common-sense gun laws to stop this violence.

Exiting the #IranDeal would undermine US leadership &amp; credibility on the global stage and threaten our national security.

Senate Republicans are asking everyday Americans to pay more for less coverage while cutting taxes for the wealthy #Trumpcare
Senate #Trumpcare bill seeks to raise costs for older Americans making it more expensive for seniors to get healthcare they need.
Future cuts to #Medicaid funding in #MA would have detrimental impacts on benefits &amp; services available to #Massachusetts families
After reading #Senate proposal, I have serious concerns hard-working families in #MA may lose access to healthcare coverage they depend on
Americans deserve transparency from government. Instead, Senate Republicans are rushing to the floor a proposal crafted behind closed doors.

We need to do more to remedy conflict of interests that remain in credit rating agencies’ business model. #WrongCHOICEAct does the opposite.
The #WrongCHOICEAct rolls back accountability and reporting standards for the credit rating agencies.
Horrible bill repeals @USDOL fiduciary duty rule which requires that financial advisers put their clients’ best interest ahead of their own
The Consumer Protection Bureau exists to defend average families. #WrongCHOICEAct would leave consumers defenseless by removing its funding.
The idea that it's good for America if we destroy the only consumer protection entity in the United States Government is a sham. #DefendCFPB
#WrongCHOICEAct harms consumers, lets off bad actors, and hamstrings our financial regulators. It will lead us to our next financial crisis.
This nearly 600-page bill destroys the good work we did to reform our financial system after the 2008 financial crisis. #WrongCHOICEAct

We appreciate all of the calls we are receiving from #MA08 in response to today's #TrumpCare vote. I will #VoteNo.
#TrumpCare does nothing to address the rising cost of prescription drugs. We need bipartisan action to address this to help working families
#TrumpCare would hurt retirees' access to healthcare by weakening #Medicare and by dramatically increasing costs for individuals over age 50
#TrumpCare would weaken pre-existing condition protections, causing premium increases for millions. I'll #VoteNo to oppose this action.
I remain strongly opposed to #Trumpcare and will vote no tomorrow. This is not a genuine attempt to improve access to affordable healthcare.
.@AARP wrote to us expressing opposition to #WrongCHOICEAct. They asked us to protect #retirees and I ask my colleagues to stand with them.
It's my hope that common sense in the best interest of retirees will prevail with my amendment to preserve #fiduciaryrule. #WrongCHOICEAct
My amendment to the #WrongCHOICEAct would ensure financial advisors are required to put clients interests ahead of their own.

I strongly believe that we must continue to support the @iaeaorg’s work now that the Iran nuclear deal is in place.
.@iaeaorg enjoys unprecedented and open access to Iran’s nuclear facilities and conducts formal reviews on at least a quarterly basis.
Determination of whether Iran is living up to its commitments is based on proof in form of a robust nuclear inspections regime by @iaeaorg
A key advantage we gained with the #IranNuclearDeal is the ability to place inspectors and investigators on the ground in Iran.

#Veterans earned their hiring preference. We must pass Veterans Federal Hiring Protection Act to exempt veterans from #federalhiringfreeze
Delivering for our #veterans includes ensuring the federal government does not close its doors to veterans when it comes to employment.
#TaxReform needs to take working families into account. Instead @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP plans give major cuts to wealthiest Americans.
Public investment from the federal government is critical to help cities and towns fix crumbling roads and bridges and create new jobs.

America’s workers need the #FAMILYAct, which was reintroduced today in Congress. I am a proud original cosponsor of this legislation.
Access to #paidleave shouldn’t depend on where you live or work. The #FAMILYAct would set a standard and advance the FMLA’s vision. #FMLA24
The FMLA allows America's to take time off when they need it most without worrying about losing jobs or health insurance. #FMLA24
All of us have a duty to our constituents to hold accountable President Trump’s choices to lead the executive branch.
It's atrocious that a President who has promised to drain the swamp would rely so much on Goldman Sachs. Are we expanding the swamp instead?
Trump's cabinet is filled with wealthy Wall Street insiders that have financial stakes in the industries they are meant to be regulating.
Treasury secretary must work on behalf of the American people so allegations regarding #Mnuchin's prior dealings are concerning.
Oversight is increasingly necessary given conflicts of interest &amp; financial entanglements that already emerged with @realDonaldTrump Cabinet
Congress has responsibility to conduct oversight to ensure Trump Cabinet acts in best interest of American public, not out of self-interest
Conflicts of interest at @USTreasury and federal financial regulators undermine interests of working families and federal agency missions

Pattern of conduct by new administration: tried to eliminate ethics office, employee #gagorder, hiring freeze, inquisition on @ENERGY staff
Obtained e-mail believed to be from Trump team ordering vetting of #IGs &amp; informing #IGs that they are being held over on a temporary basis.

.@OversightDems must ensure federal civil service can retain/recruit staff who make sure government is open for business of American people
Or through the deterioration of constitutional due process, or the degradation of whistleblower and other workplace protections.
.@GOPoversight cannot compound these attacks on federal workers through the enactment of further cuts to salaries, pensions, and benefits.
This action will have a chilling effect on whistleblowers and it impedes Congress’ role to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.
Trump administration sent gag orders to professionals working at federal agencies forbidding them from speaking to congress or the public.
.@POTUS already signed hiring freeze that will inevitably increase wait times for people &amp; small businesses seeking vital services.
Dedicated federal employees undertake a variety of missions that are essential to the security and safety of the American public
Calls for upholding due process and workplace protections which insulate civil servants &amp; whistleblowers from partisan disciplinary measures
Amendment notes need to protect key foundations of civil service: its independence from partisan politics and its professionalism.
Amendment underscores strong independent federal workforce is critical to curbing waste fraud and abuse across federal government

Speaking with @GeorgeColli of @fox25news about today's @FSCDems hearing on @WellsFargo fraud #WellsFargo https://t.co/gS9hfCijCG
When we asked #FinCEN @USTreasury about these suspicious activity reports, they don’t match up. You aren’t in compliance. #WellsFargo
You had responsibility to file suspicious activity reports when you notice bogus cards/accounts being opened by employees against customers.
No question about mail and securities fraud at #WellsFargo. Also an HR employee said you had a system of retaliation against whistle-blowers
Other members mentioned criminal activity. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, you satisfied all the elements.
In this case, these are your customers. They became victims because they did business with your bank. Unbelievable. #WellsFargo
Credit card companies have been before this committee who sent cards to noncredit worthy borrowers.
They assigned fictitious pin numbers and fake e-mail addresses to get a bonus. #WellsFargo
Banking industry exists on trust. But your employees used social security numbers of customers to open fraudulent credit cards.
Ask Chairman @RepHensarling of @FinancialCmte to consider holding a hearing with #WellsFargo employees – whistle-blowers and others fired

When will banks take responsibility &amp; admit guilt? Without admitting guilt, we build perverse incentive for this to happen again #WellsFargo
It is disgrace what happened at #WellsFargo. These low-level employees that were fired did not think this up themselves.
Relatively small fine for #WellsFargo in light of what they did with 2 million fraudulent accounts and more than 5,000 employees fired.

We must also include coordinated and proactive efforts to push back against extremist propaganda online.

While fed. law specifies several grounds disqualifying potential buyer from firearms eligibility, being on terrorist watch list is not one.

I didn’t have to spend taxpayer money to find out what Secretary Powell did. He wrote it in his book.
I don't understand why Secretary Powell is being held to a completely different standard than Secretary Clinton.
The State Department asked Secretary Powell to contact AOL, but he didn’t do it either.
It is ridiculous that the National Archives asked the State Department to contact AOL for Secretary Powell's e-mails, but they didn't.
The problem is that, unlike Secretary Clinton, Secretary Powell apparently did not save or print out any of his emails.
In his autobiography, Secretary Powell discussed how he frequently used his personal email for work.
We are completely ignoring what Secretary Rice &amp; Secretary Powell did.

I look forward to discussing with our witnesses what steps we can take to further strengthen Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program.
Primary reason Orlando lost funding is that Congress imposed additional guidance &amp; restrictions for #DHS to distribute #UASI funding.
For an area that experienced terrorist attack by shooter who pledged allegiance to Islamic State, lack of assistance merits re-examination.
While Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford area received nearly $45M in funding from '04-'12, the area did not qualify for assistance in '13, '15, '16.
Oversight will ensure that no city is arbitrarily or unjustifiably denied this assistance.
Given importance of these grants to anti-terrorism preparedness &amp;response, it's imperative we conduct meaningful oversight of the program
The nearly $18M Boston received in #UASI funding in 2013 proved critical in the midst &amp; aftermath of devastating Boston Marathon bombings
#Boston, #Orlando, &amp; other cities have had issues receiving this funding in the past. We need to ensure cities receive funding they need.
The purpose of the Urban Area Security Initiative is to assist cities in their anti-terrorism preparedness and response efforts.
Thanks to our witnesses for dedicated public service in the wake of the devastating terrorist attack and mass shooting at Pulse Nightclub
Before we begin, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of the victims and their families in last night's horrific terrorist attack in #Nice

Speaking now on the @HouseFloor on H.R. 4992 Fund Transfers Involving #Iran. Watch live: https://t.co/fqFsoyoSpk
If you distrust #Iran, then you should want unfettered access for #IAEA inspectors.
The consequence of this bill is that #Iran would have the right to kick out inspectors, which would completely stop inspections.
My main concern is that the bill is a direct violation of the terms of the #JCPOA.
Isolation under Iranian regime is not in our best interest. Let people of #Iran travel &amp; see what democracy is like, let them travel safely.
We have an opportunity here. @iaeaorg reports on whether #Iran is in compliance with #JCPOA – June report shows full compliance.
This bill is making it more dangerous for regular people to fly in #Iran.
Last year, I sat with an @iaeaorg inspector who said the most dangerous thing our #IAEA inspectors do is fly between cities in #Iran.
According to @CRS4Congress, Iranian pilots have consistently complained that U.S. sanctions have led to deterioration of passenger aircraft.

Commend @jasoninthehouse @RepMarkMeadows @RepCummings @GerryConnolly for leadership as we continue to work towards bipartisan #postalreform
That’s because current law does not require them to enroll in medicare once they’re eligible.
While #USPS reports employees have contributed $29B to #medicare since 1983, many postal retirees are not drawing on benefits they paid for.
The bill will remove this burden by requiring the full integration of postal health care with the medicare program.
Bill eliminates unfunded liability &amp; avg annual payments of $5.5B @USPS has been required to pay to prefund future retiree health benefits
We cannot continue the status quo of net losses and a decline in first-class mail volume.
Believe this bill provides us with a key opportunity to address some of the most outstanding challenges facing @USPS.
Like any agreement, H.R. 5714 is not perfect &amp; I welcome additional feedback from postal stakeholders and members on both sides of the aisle
Developed bipartisan postal bill focused on commonsense reform that we agree would place the postal service on more stable financial footing
HR 5714 follows months of negotiation and compromise between @jasoninthehouse @RepCummings @RepMarkMeadows @GerryConnolly and I.
All of whom have been working in support of sensible #postalreform.
Reflective of meaningful input from coalition of postal &amp; federal employee unions, management organizations, mailers, &amp; the postal service
The @USPS mission is to “provide postal services that bind the nation together through the correspondence of the people.”
Product of shared commitment to ensure our most trusted government institution @USPS is able to continue its vital public service mission

If you read the 14th and 5th amendments, equal protection means equal protection. You can't have people opting out.
This bill essentially has an op-out provision for a constitutional right. #SupremeCourt says same-sex marriage is a right. #FADA

Earlier tonight, I spoke on @HouseFloor calling for a vote on three bills to address #gunviolence. https://t.co/RJ0vTU2bW9
As I stand here tonight, I am enormously proud to speak on behalf of this body.
Victims of gun violence can’t speak for themselves so it is our job to speak on their behalf and on behalf of their families.
Those three bills won’t stop everything but they are good place to start.
And the third bill says that the CDC should do a study on gun violence as a health issue because we are losing so many Americans to it.
The second bill says we should check on the background of people to determine they can handle the responsibility of having a weapon.
The first bill is pretty simple – people on the terrorist watchlist shouldn’t have access to weapons.
This whole fight is to talk about these bills and have a vote on them. We want open debate on the floor of the people's house.
We are asking for modest changes by calling for a vote on these three bills. Three bills I happen to be a cosponsor of.
But when they shut off microphone/cameras wouldn't let Members stand up for people out there, well then its time to get in some good trouble
I thank @repjohnlewis. I am a rules guy so I had trouble with the idea of a sit in in the House of Representatives in the U.S. Congress

Discussion draft of the bipartisan postal reform legislation is now available online: https://t.co/HEFkcguDd3
Thank @USPS 4 major postal employee unions &amp; key mailing industry associations for coming together on joint proposal of Medicare integration
It would also reduce expenses by $38 billion over the next 10 years.
Medicare integrationwould eliminate 94% of the Postal Service’s unfunded retiree health benefit liability.
Medicare integration would eliminate onerousrequirement from 2006 that the Postal Service prefund healthcare costs for future retirees.
Agreement would establish postal-specific health plans within FEHBP that would be fully integrated with Medicare beginning in January 2018.
This is costly for the Postal Service and its employees/retirees becausenon-participation shifts claim costs from Medicare to FEHBP.
However, postal employees are not currently required to enroll in Medicare once they are eligible.
Postal employees and retirees have paid over $29.4 billion into Medicare but are not drawing on the benefits that they’ve alreadypaid for.
The Postal Service currently spends approximately 20 cents of every revenue dollar on healthcare.
In Fiscal Year 2015, the Postal Service reported total healthcare costs of $13.6 B including $8.8 B in retiree health costs alone.

Current protocol with #FATF and #FIUs is fairly effective to stop wire transfer of resources to fund terrorist financing.
As we adapt, some of these terrorist groups are re-engineering their terror funding. We are seeing a new iteration of terrorist financing.
We were able to take them out as a primary money laundering concern. They are now defunct.

Adding that "the way in which despots have hidden behind what we have at Guantanamo to justify their own positions."
Colin Powell said “Guantanamo has cost us a lot over the years in terms of our standing in the world."
General Martin Dempsey added that Guantanamo “does create a psychological scar on our national values. Whether it should or not – it does.”
Jones added "maintaining the facility at Guantanamo indefinitely will have a lasting and deleterious impact on our standing in the world.”
"America’s greatest attribute in garnering support for #nationalsecurity initiatives is leadership/fidelity to values &amp; principle of justice
There are people who I respect in military with strong opinions on #Guantanamo including former National Security Adviser Jim Jones who said
Continued evidence of terrorist reengagement reiterates need to further enhance our detainee review process to assure that custody is secure
This is a marked improvement over previous vetting conducted by only a single agency, the @DeptofDefense.
Board also determines detainees' eligibility for transfer to a third country, prosecution, or continued detention
In order to strengthen detainee vetting process, President established an interagency board in 2009 to evaluate detainees on a rolling basis
.@ODNIgov reports approximately 17.5% of former detainees transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist activities
Must assess if we can securely transfer eligible detainees to foreign custody &amp; mitigate potential to return as militants to battlefields.
Must work on bipartisan basis to examine whether each detainee poses a threat to the national security of U.S. and our coalition partners.
I do believe that we should afford the @DeptofDefense flexibility in resolving the disposition of the remaining detainees under rule of law
Political &amp; legislative debate over Guantanamo focuses on broad question of whether closing facility would serve national security interests
.@DeptofDefense also estimates that closure would lower annual operational costs by between $140 million and $180 million dollars
.@DeptofDefense reports cost of operating the detention mission at Guantanamo in FY'15 was approximately $445 million dollars.
As such, this plan will require explicit congressional approval.
For detainees subject to continued detention, plan proposes relocation to appropriate detention facility in continental U.S.
Administration will review detainee eligibility for secure transfer to foreign government custody or prosecution by U.S. military commission
Plan will implement the President’s intent to close the facility as “a national security imperative.”
In accordance w/Defense Authorization Act for FY'16, @DeptofDefense submitted plan to Congress to resolve disposition of remaining detainees
During my last oversight visit to Guantanamo a couple of years ago, the number of detainees stood at 174. Today, there are 80.
With more than 530 detainees transferred by President Bush &amp; 158 transferred by President Obama to the custody of an estimated 60 countries
Over the past 13 years, the detainee population has been dramatically reduced by 85% or 691.
According to @DeptofDefense, nearly 800 detainees have been held at #Guantanamo since 2002, including peak of 684 detainees in June of 2003.

That issue along with beneficial ownership creates a real issue for all of us and we are working to address it.
#PanamaPapers shed light on role of offshore financial mechanisms to move and store money anonymously.
Through appropriations process Congress must support vital work of @USTreasury &amp; #FinCEN to safeguard financial system from illicit activity
It is imperative that the U.S. implements a cohesive strategy to determine the roles and responsibilities of @USTreasury attachés.
However, he is responsible for a portfolio that covers many challenging countries-a portfolio too robust for one person to properly manage.
I recently met one of a mere 17 treasury attachés while in the U.A.E. He is a very bright, capable, person.
This can be accomplished through a robust, dedicated team of @USTreasury attachés that are posted in relevant countries.
US could address these risks by providing technical assistance to countries that fail to implement adequate AML/CFT measures.
Countries with weak financial institutions and ineffective financial sector oversight are breeding grounds for terrorist activity.
They share this financial intelligence with law enforcement agencies and international financial intelligence counterparts across the globe.
FIUs serve as national centers that promote info sharing by receiving and investigating financial intelligence
We must mentor and support Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in vulnerable countries that lack the rule of law.
Detecting and disrupting the flow of funding to terrorist groups is crucial in our fight against terrorism.

I do have concerns about storing this information and the need to protect against potential hacks. Look forward to discussing cybersecurity.
The recently released social media policy the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has developed is a step in the right direction
Omnibus requires agencies use social media &amp; other publicly-available government &amp; commercial data when reviewing security clearance holders
In December, Congress passed bipartisan funding legislation that included a robust directive to enhance the security clearance process.
Security clearance candidate completes Standard Form-86. This 127-page form already requests variety of personal applicant information.
Federal government conducts investigations to determine whether an individual may receive or retain a security clearance

My amendment is another tool in the toolbox. Quite simply, we need to do everything we can to keep these drugs off the streets.
By regularly reviewing best practices &amp; updating protocols, we can keep these drugs secure and save some lives in the process.
My amendment gives local communities resources to work with hospitals and community health centers to improve security of prescription drugs
In the wake of our nationwide prescription drug abuse epidemic, these “drug diversion” crimes have increased across the country.
One way these drugs get onto the street is after they have been stolen from a medical facility in which they’re kept for legitimate use.
The road to use and abuse of illicit opioid drug often begins with the legitimate use of or diverted use of prescription opioid painkillers
My amendment expands grants to provide for developing implementing or expanding programs to ensure security of opioids at medical facilities

That is good news for the Postmaster General, for the postal unions, and for the people that do this important work each and every day.
84% rate the postal service favorably. That is the highest of any government employees.
.@pewresearch polled Americans about their government and they said the most trusted government employees are our postal workers.
The best judge of the @USPS is the customer, the American people.
There is a wonderful opportunity with postal service and #census. Our postal workers are walking the streets already and know the community.
#Japan came in 2nd and it's less than a third of that. Also @USPS has universal service which a lot of these countries don't have.
.@USPS scores highest for efficiency even as it delivers far more letters per employee than any other service in the G-20.
It is notable that @USPS was the only system in the group that does not receive taxpayer funding.
A recent report from Oxford Strategic Consulting examined the efficiency of the postal services in the G-20. @USPS was ranked the best.
I want to push back on some of the criticism about the comparative performance of @USPS vs. international competition.
One thing that may be done quickly is considering 50% of health benefit trust fund being managed by commission rather than held in treasury.
I realize we can’t fix everything, but that doesn’t mean we can’t fix something. A major piece of legislation can help @USPS immediately.
You’ve done a great job with this proposal and it ought to be adopted. We ought to move this forward.
I think it is fair and reasonable that people who paid in $29B might use those benefits.
The only criticism I have heard so far is that postal employees who pay into medicare might actually use it.
.@NALC_National President Rolando mentioned that this would eliminate almost all of the $50B in unfunded liability.
25% of employees relying on #FEHBP rather than #medicare as their primary ensurer.
Postal service is the second largest contributor to #medicare. Postal employees paid in $29B to medicare.
Pleased to see bipartisan coordination in Congress as well as coordination of Postmaster General, postal unions, mailing community, and PRC.

Or else making oversight, examinations and penalties much tougher than they currently appear to be?
Do you really believe it's possible to do without either eliminating financial conflicts of interest in the ratings agency business model
Your testimony states that the OCR attempts to “serve the public interest and protect users of credit ratings”.
And Office of Credit Ratings (OCR’s) public examinations do not even identify the specific ratings agencies that violate procedural rules.
You have not used your statutory authority under Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act to suspend agencies or individuals from ratings.
Yet, you have not levied any fines or penalties on ratings agencies.
Your most recent examinations found several failures by major credit rating agencies to comply with their own stated policies and procedures
It seems the system is designed to shield rating agencies from accountability.
The model that created these conflicts of interest. Credit rating agencies have returned to record profits.
Since the financial crisis, your agency has not instituted any fundamental change in the credit rating agency business model.

Important to examine how can we track and halt the sales of cultural antiquities by terrorist organizations on apps like #WhatsApp.
We need to bring better transparency to this industry so that antiquities trafficking is no longer profitable for terrorist organizations
Must curtail antiquities laundering from #IslamicState controlled territories so these goods cannot be integrated in legitimate markets.
We need to do better job policing routes so #IslamicState can no longer smuggle antiquities &amp; other contraband out of territory it controls
Currently, there is ample opportunity for terrorist groups to exploit these routes with low risk of being caught. This is not good.
The same strategies we need to combat antiquities trafficking can be used in our broader strategy to combat the #IslamicState.
We need a network of trade transparency units for proper customs enforcement.
We need to cut off trade routes that terrorist organizations use to funnel illicit goods.
We also need to be able to track the true owners of property whether that property is an ancient artifact or a high-rise apartment building.
To cut off #terroristfinancing, we need better information sharing between government agencies, between countries, &amp; with the private sector

If evidence continues to show that service dogs are one way of helping veterans with PTSD, I certainly support expansion of these efforts.
.@RepMcGovern reintroduced HR 2493 that establishes grants to assist nonprofits in developing &amp; establishing service dog programs for vets
.@RepDeSantis introduced HR 4764 that requires @DeptVetAffairs begin  service dog pilot program specific to post-9/11 veterans w/severe PTSD
Proud to cosponsor 2 pieces of bipartisan legislation that have been introduced to facilitate the use of service dogs to assist our veterans
Initial academic studies have revealed that veterans paired with service dogs report less severe P.T.S.D. symptoms and other health benefits
One alternative is the topic of today’s hearing: providing service dogs to veterans with P.T.S.D. to help alleviate their related symptoms.
We must also encourage the development of commonsense alternative solutions that could further assist #veterans with rehabilitation.
I was proud to support the #omnibus that included $50B for VA medical services, including mental health care and suicide prevention
This includes robust funding for the @DeptVetAffairs to continue to expand its mental health services.
Impact of #PTSD in veteran’s community is difficult &amp; far-reaching issue that demands a comprehensive approach to treatment &amp; rehabilitation
.@DeptVetAffairs reported #veterans w/#PTSD are particularly vulnerable to suicide risk. This continues to affect vets at devastating rate.
Prevalence of #PTSD among Iraq &amp; Afghanistan veterans is primarily the result of multiple tours of duty &amp; repeated &amp; severe combat exposure
Up to 20 out of every 100 veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom have P.T.S.D. in a given year.
With post-9/11 veterans returning from wars in #Iraq #Afghanistan, effective treatment for #PTSD is one urgent area of veterans' healthcare
The fundamental duty of @DeptVetAffairs to provide dignified care to America’s veterans and their families remains as critical as ever.

Tune in to @CNBC @PowerLunch with @TylerMathisen @MCaruso_Cabrera. I am joining them live to discuss efforts to halt terrorism financing.
When federal agencies face budgetary constraints, every #homelandsecurity $ must be allocated towards most critical #nationalsecurity risks.
It is this type of fact-based oversight that should guide our review of our immigration and border control procedures across the board.
For the small % of families who do seek resettlement to the U.S.,  we found a multi-layered vetting process that is robust and extensive.
Primary goal to ensure financially-strained host countries &amp; humanitarian agencies have  resources to provide dignified life for refugees
Rather, they seek to stay in neighboring host countries in the hopes of returning home.
We discovered that the vast majority - about 70% - are not even interested in resettlement at all.
We assessed and even participated in the vetting processes required for Syrian refugee resettlement to the United States.
.@RepRussell and I recently traveled on an oversight mission to #Turkey, #Jordan, and #Lebanon
as a signatory to 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, to protecting highly-vulnerable individuals who are fleeing from persecution &amp; violence.
In the interests of #nationalsecurity, it must be undertaken in a manner that continues to reflect our longstanding international commitment
Critical &amp; necessary examination that must entail fact-based oversight of existing immigration and border security policies across the board
Have led to policy debate in the U.S. over how best to prevent terrorists from infiltrating our legitimate immigration processes.
The stark increase in global forced displacement coupled with devastating terror attacks in #Paris #SanBernardino #Beirut  #Ankara #Brussels
Approximately 7.6M have been internally displaced within #Syria and more than 4M refugees have fled the country since conflict began in 2011
The War in #Syria and the rise of the #IslamicState have been the primary factors behind the unprecedented surge in global displacement.
Over 50% of the refugee population is now made up of children under 18 marking the highest child refugee figure in more than 10 years.
That’s a 60% increase from the 37.5 million displaced people recorded by #UNHCR a decade ago.
Conflict, persecution, violence, and flagrant human rights violations have forcibly displaced nearly 60 million people worldwide.
As reported by the #UNHCR @Refugees, we are witnessing the largest global forced displacement of people since World War II.

#FMA's strong advocacy has a tangible impact on improving working conditions for federal employees across the board.
We must modernize parental leave benefits for the federal workforce to both strengthen families and improve retention. It's common sense.
Federal government should be a model employer for the private sector. However we continue to lag behind in paid parental leave.
The RECOVER Act would provide lifetime identity theft protection coverage and insurance to the nearly 22M victims of the #OPM data breaches.
#FAIRAct is one step towards ensuring federal workforce is fairly compensated for critical work they do on behalf of the American people.
Another priority is coming together in a bipartisan manner to fund federal agencies in order to improve retention and recruitment.
Enactment of #WoundedWarriors better ensures that wounded warriors entering federal workforce have flexibility to attend VA appointments
A chief example is the #WoundedWarriors Federal Leave Act. Legislation that stemmed from the admirable work and support of the #FMA.
Invaluable role in supporting efforts to improve working conditions for all federal employees &amp; encourage meaningful bipartisan cooperation.
#FMA recognizes the critical missions that federal agencies undertake are dependent on retention &amp; recruitment of a strong #federalworkforce

I voted for tighter restrictions in #VisaWaiverProgram, but I do believe in affording Secretary flexibility that he was granted by statute.
Conflict reporting by journalists is critical to informing US officials &amp; the public about security and humanitarian facts on the ground.
It de-incentivizes desperate populations from making desperate choices. This humanitarian aid keeps refugees near their home country.
During recent CODEL to Syrian border, organizations noted aid provides a dignified living for people in need and also makes us all safer.
However, our shared interest in #nationalsecurity does not exclude goals of humanitarian assistance, accountability, and economic stability
We must conduct meaningful oversight of the implementation of this #nationalsecurity waiver authority.
The agency has underscored that such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis.
It requires an annual report be submitted to congressional committees of jurisdiction on each instance of a waiver
The Secretary of #DHS may grant a waiver to a foreign national if it is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the U.S.
In select cases, restrictions could potentially run contrary to #nationalsecurity excluding #UN personnel #IAEA inspectors or relief workers
Citizens of #visawaiverprogram countries who traveled #Syria #Iraq #Sudan #Iran since March 2011 are no longer eligible for visa free entry
#VisaWaiverProgram was strengthened following the devastating terrorist attacks in #Paris where perpetrators were citizens of #VWP countries
In the #omnibus, the bipartisan #VisaWaiverProgram Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevent Act, which I voted for, became law.

Inclined to agree that a global network of trade transparency units would help bring the opaque system into the light.
Currently, there is ample opportunity for terrorist groups to exploit the international trade system with low risk of being caught.
#TBML involves using trade to transfer value in order to obscure the true origins of illicit wealth.

This fund may authorize up to $20 million to certain U.S. victims in the aftermath of a terrorist attack.
Congress recently enacted a #omnibus bill that established a new United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.
Imperative we conduct meaningful oversight of DOJ’s victim assistance process to find additional ways to facilitate its important mission
We must make every effort to ensure that U.S. victims of overseas terrorism and their families are afforded the justice they deserve.

OVT remains critical in light of recent terror plots &amp; attacks perpetrated by ISIS, Hamas, al-Qaeda, Jahbat al-Nusra, &amp; other organizations
OVT also works with #FBI, United States Attorneys’ Offices, &amp; other offices within #DOJ to safeguard rights of U.S. victims &amp; their families
OVT is responsible for monitoring investigations and prosecutions relating to terrorist attacks against Americans abroad.
The #OVT ensures that the investigation &amp; prosecution of deaths of American citizens overseas are a high priority within the #DOJ.
Congress established the Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism (#OVT) in December of 2004.

Thank you State Rep. Angelo Scaccia for your illustrious service to our nation during the #VietnamWar. https://t.co/e3uJTqw78s
Honored to speak with #APGov and #ModelCongress students at #QuincyHighSchool about my work as a member of #Congress https://t.co/2PislhxL4y
I encourage you to let our office know how we can best assist you and what you would like to see Congress focus on in the year ahead.
Passage of the #WoundedWarriors Federal Leave Act demonstrates our deep appreciation for the service and sacrifice of our wounded warriors
Assisting our service men and women with the transition back to civilian life is also a top priority.
I have taken a lead role to examine our efforts to strengthen homeland security and counterterrorism strategies.
As the Ranking Member of the #NationalSecurity Subcommittee and #FinancialServices Task Force to Investigate #TerrorismFinancing,
We have been focusing on issues close to the hearts of residents of the 8th District.
To working with local, state, and federal officials to better coordinate our efforts to tackle the devastating #opioidabuse crisis
From working to increase accountability at the #FAA to ensure community health and wellness is taken into account during decision making
As your representative in Congress, responding to these concerns is of the utmost importance to me.
Each day my office hears from constituents who are concerned with what’s going on in #DC and in their local communities.
As 2015 comes to a close, I would like to highlight a few issues that our office focused on over the last year.	https://t.co/4rgrx8zHdd

We must continue to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that these and other #VisaWaiverProgram reforms become law.
#DHS has taken steps to enhance #VWP security and House passed HR 158 to reform program with stringent security and oversight requirements
However, its sheer size, traveler volume &amp; continued threat of terrorist activity worldwide demand that we make efforts to strengthen it
The Visa Waiver Program has also served to promote commerce and tourism in the United States.
#VWP reflects a security partnership between US and 38 countries by establishing minimum standards for acceptable travel documents
One area where we have found significant bipartisan agreement is the subject of today’s hearing – the Visa Waiver Program
Imperative that we continue to work together and take steps to enhance our national security against threat of a homegrown terrorist attack
#ISIL has demonstrated its savagery and willingness to expand its terrorist activities beyond its controlled territories in Iraq and Syria
This shift in strategy is even more concerning given the continued terrorist threat posed by foreign fighters returning from Iraq and Syria.
Horrific #Paris terror attacks evidenced shift in #ISIL strategy with centrally-planned terrorist attacks against civilian targets in West

I have 727,514 bosses back in Massachusetts. They sent me here to do my job &amp; I’m trying to do that on their behalf. http://t.co/LAAX0LER6y
We need to give the American worker a voice. Let’s have an open debate. It should not be a national secret.
My constituents sent me here to do my job and I’m trying to do that on their behalf. We can’t do that if #TPA goes through.
Let's have a fair deal for the American worker that I can read and share with my constituents.
I’m not against free trade. I think free trade works when it’s balanced, but the #TPP is a lousy deal.
Let's vote this #TAA bill down. Stop #TPA and be involved in the process.
We are leaving it up to multinational corporations. America wants their representatives back in the fight.
It is unacceptable that the people who represent American workers have been kept out of the #TPP process.
I would rather have my Representative fighting for my job than fighting for a public assistance program after I lose my job.
I oppose this bill because I want a stronger America. Our trade agreements have a continual pattern of exporting American jobs overseas.
