Burdick uphed that you don‚Äôt have to accept the pardon and a court cannot recognize it unless accepted. Burdick was an editor at the New York Tribune, took the fifth and refused to give up his sources. History is fun. https://t.co/Jxy0nZQ1sw
I should take another Constitution poli sci class, or whatever it was called where we had to memorize SCOTUS cases. Who doesn‚Äôt enjoy reading SCOTUS rulings from 1915?
Burdick vs U.S. says a pardon carries an imputation of guilt and acceptance of a confession of it. That it remits punishment and condones infractions of the peace of state. In other words, you‚Äôre still guilty.
Why would Martha accept this, unless she was pursuing it? Her brand has survived, she‚Äôs on a TV show with Snoop Dogg, she‚Äôs joked about earning street cred from her prison time, she‚Äôs moved on, why remind consumers of her past indiscretions. https://t.co/yMSHHQIRT2
