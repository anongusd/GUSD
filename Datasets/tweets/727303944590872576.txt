@SenWarren we are at war. Ms Warren please continue twiting your stupidity
@brithume We have very serious issues in our country and we are talking about bone spurs. Give me a break!!
@elizabethforma @DHSgov @CBP Wait a minute. Immigration has been a serious issue for years. It took 2 deaths to get s twit this does not include 100rds of others that have died. You politicians disgust the American people
@SenFeinstein Attention Politicians, you are all responsible for the immigration issue. For years all if you have collected your paycheck and not addressed immigration. So now you want an investigation. Shame shame
@SenFeinstein They took this child to the hospital. The child was released from hospital. Fact is the hospital should be investigated
@NBCPolitics The politicians do your job and pass immigration reform

@cnni He will not be defeated 2020. He just will not run. Would you if at every corner you are hated. I believe if this hate continues President Trump will decide for the love of his country he will not run. God help this country.
@kilmeade @Jim_Jordan The politicians are not fooling anyone. They could have secured the border and fixed the immigration but here the American people lose again. If you want the Americans to stop voting completely then continue down this road of game playing
Stock market drop pure emotional. Our country is fine
If we the people allow this game playing to continue we the people will pay the price. Security is priority!!

@KirstenPowers Not sure who you polled but my vote is with Mr K
@DiamondandSilk This is a Politicians strategy to keep a Constitutional judge off the court. So they used the scare of Roe v Wade to do this. I never thought my gender would or could be used this way. Be on guard females this could happen to your sons, brothers, fathers and etc.
