The major parties can have *gasp* both moderate and progressive competitive candidates. Can someone explain why this isn’t a no brainer??
Voters get the candidate that is at least acceptable to the broadest group of people. Candidates get a fair shake, voters get more (realistic) choices, minor parties get an opportunity to slowly build support, and major parties...
The ballots that had the eliminated candidate in their #1 spot then get their #2 candidate’s votes added to the rest of the candidates. They do that until there is only one left— the winner! It eliminates the 3rd party/independent candidate #spoiler problem.
📢May I take this moment— #HowardSchultz2020 announcement, to remind people that rank-choice voting is a way better way to structure #voting ? You would get to rank your top 3 choices, in order 1-3. When the votes are tallied, the candidate with the fewest #1 votes is eliminated

"If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?" (NIV, 1 John 3:17)
Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.” (Luke 12:15)
"Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint."  (NIV, Proverb 23:4)
"Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil."  (TNIV, 1 Timothy 6:9-10)
"What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?" (NIV, Matthew 16:26)
"No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money." (NLT, Luke 16:13)
"Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you... You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. James 5:4-5 (NIV)
"Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless... The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much, but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep. (Ecclesiastes 5:10,12)

News organizations- especially local ones- have a responsibility to engage in neutral, thoughtful reporting and the “report” I just witnessed is not even close to that. Do better.
And before you say it’s innocent, consider how this language shapes our public discourse. They are acting as judge and jury and spreading a harmful “tough on crime” rhetoric that contributes to or massive #massincarceration problem in Ohio.
This one-sided, dismissive language and coverage is why local news is missing a huge opportunity to build our community with empathy and understanding rather than divide it with fear, name-calling, and judgmental assumptions.
In the 1.5 minute of coverage I saw, a “reporter” on @wsyx6 called a petty theft suspect a “creep”, “dirtbag”, “loser”, and “bad guy”. That’s not reporting and is absolutely shameful. Please go to @BreitbartNews and give an actual reporter an opportunity.
