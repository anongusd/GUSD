@econwonk thanks for this!
@econwonk It’s retroactive for four years! For prior tariffs, if Congress doesn’t pass an approval resolution within 75 days of enactment, tariffs would be repealed
Per one-pager, goods would also have to constitute a "substantial cause" of a national security threat to qualify for Section 232 tariffs.
ITC would also have to issue future and retroactive reports on effects of 232 tariffs. Additional cosponsors: Lamar Alexander, RonJon, Angus King, James Lankford, Jerry Moran, Brian Schatz, and Jeanne Shaheen. @RepGallagher and Ron Kind have intro'd companion bill in the House.
It would transfer investigative authority to DoD rather than Commerce, limit items that can be considered for tariffs to those related to military equipment, energy resources, and/or critical infrastructure, and would put ITC in charge of exclusion process instead of Commerce
Per release, Pat Toomey, Ben Sasse, Mark Warner and Maggie Hassan are introducing a revamped Section 232 bill that builds on Bob Corker's previous effort to require congressional approval for national security tariffs. (1/2)

@conservmillen Look. All I came here to say is that painting the other side with a broad brush and claiming they have a near monopoly on dishonesty and are inherently opposed to American ideals is *actually* part of why political discourse is so rotten. Not because of the reasons in your video.
@conservmillen You may not agree with Trump on some of these things, but polling shows the majority of GOP voters *have* shifted on trade. This paper is informative: https://t.co/i7tWe0ij2l https://t.co/mMXmakhREB
@conservmillen Allie when did I say conservatives are monolithic
@conservmillen I guess it’s just not accurate imo to portray Democrats as ideologically monolithic in this way — for instance, many Dems who won in the midterms ran pretty moderate campaigns.		And conservatives *have* dramatically shifted on issues in the past two years. (Tariffs are good now!)
@CRTV @conservmillen all i'm saying, as someone who has covered Congress for two years and who interacts with lawmakers frequently, is that in the real world, both parties are filled with dishonest people who lie on a regular basis about all sorts of things
@CRTV @conservmillen hi allie I don't know how you can look at the current political environment (or even just the president's twitter feed) and then make a video broadly claiming that it's primarily ~the left~ that's unconcerned with the truth and determines its own subjective reality

RT @DJJudd: @byrdinator On...Veteran's Day? Of all days?
If you know me, you know I try not to get upset about politics too easily or very often. But this should infuriate every Republican who has even an ounce of respect for McCain.
@jmartNYT so strange
My jaw actually dropped open when I saw this in a print WSJ. The piece’s main premise, that McCain’s vote lent credibility to the notion that ACA repeal would have gutted preexisting conditions, is baffling.		The bill would have gutted preexisting conditions. That’s just a fact.
This is disgusting. Jason Lewis, a GOP congressman defeated last week, blames John McCain for Republican losses in the midterms bc of his no vote on ACA repeal. 		It’s appalling that Lewis and his team thought this piece—which is filled with lies—was OK.	https://t.co/KNr6rDHMKv

WASHINGTON — at an outdoor screening of the Empire Strikes Back, a little girl dances ballet to the soundtrack
Part of why we’re able to do that is because Capitol police do an excellent job of protecting members, staff, and press. I appreciate the important work they do.		I also know they’re not to blame for the changes with regard to press.		I’m simply saying this can’t become the norm.
One of the best things about the Capitol is the extraordinary level of press freedom here — you can catch up with any member of Congress as they’re walking to a meeting or going to votes and ask them questions. They get to decide if they want to answer or not. It’s great.
In all instances, no protesters were present. It was just reporters, staff, and senators. I understand a need for heightened security. But some of this was just nonsensical. I’m not sure who is making these decisions, or how long it will last. But it’s not ideal.
The past two days I’ve watched police stop reporters from doing their jobs by kicking them out of an area where a meeting was being held, and I’ve been physically pushed away from following a senator through a public Capitol hallway. Mobility has been severely limited.
Whitehouse: “There is perhaps increasing sense in the Republican caucus that they risk getting in real trouble if they vote this guy through without a proper investigation and then some of these claims prove out." https://t.co/fcuyY5eOT9
"There's lingering doubt out there among a lot of people that we haven't taken every measure that we should to make sure that these allegations are dealt with. And so that's what this effort is about.” https://t.co/fcuyY5eOT9
“We want a more fulsome process that the country can be proud of." https://t.co/fcuyY5eOT9

It’s mostly a very good @tonymecia piece! https://t.co/w1xNqIutTc
Oftentimes constituents have no idea what’s going on! And staffers have to explain why they’re suddenly on the phone with Congress.		Other times, the constituent goes rogue. Example: “Somebody called me and told me to tell you not to pass tax cuts, but I actually like tax cuts.”
These are called patch-through calls. They happen when an advocacy group dials a constituent and asks them about a particular policy issue, before patching them through to talk to a congressional office. Read @tonymecia and me on the tactic here: https://t.co/cuGz4nApzt
A conversation that happens on the Hill every day:		CONSTITUENT: “Hello?”		STAFFER: “Hi, you’ve reached the congressman’s office. How can we help you?”		CONSTITUENT: “Umm. You called me.”		STAFFFER: “You called us. This is the congressman’s office.”	https://t.co/cuGz4nApzt

@JoePerticone @_WilliamsonBen Mainly I thought it was funny that Zeldin felt like he had to apologize for answering questions from other reporters
@_WilliamsonBen That wasn’t my point at all. The whole story is about how a conservative reporter was fuming when the HFC guys chose someone other than a GOP-friendly outlet, which they did several times. Never tried to imply otherwise
The reporter, of course, got the end the press conference with two or three more questions, which were sympathetic to Zeldin’s cause or added pressure on the Republicans to escalate the situation even more. It was like watching an echo chamber in action
A Fox News reporter, who had already asked Zeldin a question, tried to ask another. He called on a different reporter in the back of the room. The Fox reporter gave him a death stare. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” he mouthed at her.		I was almost falling out of my chair laughing

It's always possible they cave! But there aren't that many incentives to do so in this situation. 		A lot of Republicans take issue not only with the idea of a bilateral deal itself, but also with the substance — minimum wage requirements for auto manufacturing, 16-year sunset
Republicans are very reluctant to proactively check Trump.		But when a questionable plan requires congressional action, they ignore his directives. (How's that $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill coming?) 		The US-Mexico deal likely falls into that category.	https://t.co/YKv5oQV5aG

@ActuallyImGood I'm not saying reporters shouldn't have gone to it to observe and report if anything happened.		I'm saying the wall-to-wall coverage in advance was premature. And now that they've seen the "rally," there is no reason (thus far) to dedicate substantial airtime or print to it.
