@Duffy_1958 @charliekirk11 It's over 10k now. It's pretty sad that so many people fall for his snake oil.
@charliekirk11 Does anyone else find it weird that @charliekirk11 just makes things up but his followers aren't smart enough to realize it? No wonder Charlie panders to the lowest level -- theyre the only ones dumb enough to believe him!!!
Did @RepMarkMeadows really just try the political equivalent of "Trump can't be racist, he has a black friend"? And try to spin that into evidence that Cohen is being dishonest? Rep. Meadows should be ashamed. It's 2019, not 1960.
@charliekirk11 Did you know:		@charliekirk11 frequently lies or uses intentionally misleading data to make his points? Just like he did here...
@ETNAV537 @StupidVetTricks @pjp_designs @KamalaHarris @NRA What a stupid sign. So if a parent slaps their kid (not saying that's okay, it's not) they will be shot? That's just murder.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse ... your defense to being called a propagandist is basically "I retweeted clearly false information to get people to think about the issue I wanted them to think about, in the light I wanted them to think about it in"?		That's exactly what propaganda is. Absolutely pathetic.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Again, trying to direct away from your lies. Classic propagandist. My issue (why I tweeted) is you're spreading obvious propaganda just to incite people. Don't try to justify propaganda. Real Americans (again, CLEARLY not you) put truth over lies and propaganda, not justify lies
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I see that you're desperately trying to change the subject away from the fact you were caught spreading lies and propaganda. Classic propagandist move. I'm discussing your obvious foolishness and dishonesty, not my opinion on that issue.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If someone claimed the Earth was made of Legos would you blindly accept it as fact, like you did here? "I've never heard someone say it's not... and who says it couldn't be?" You're a fool if you think that way. Worse, you apparently don't care that you spread lies. Pathetic.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Only liars and propagandists think you can justify a made up statistic (with ZERO evidence) evidence by saying "who's saying it can't happen?" If you say something is true, you need evidence. Honestly that's one of the single dumbest things I've ever read.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Nothing says "fooled into spreading propaganda" like copying the same non reply that justified falsehoods as for a good cause. The sad thing is that there are more "Americans" like you out there. Real Americans (to be clear, obv not you) put truth above lies and propaganda.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Read. The. Article.		It says nothing about those people crossing into the US. You're just being lazy and spreading ignorance instead of using your brian.
@tlfeathers880 @ScienceGuy66 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse So you're saying that justifies totally making things up and spreading them because it fits your agenda? That's called propaganda, not truth, and you've clearly been fooled into helping spread it.
@ScienceGuy66 @tlfeathers880 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You do realize that your source made that up, right? Of course not,  you didn't actually read the article she linked, just the tweet. Her own article doesn't even support her (clearly wrong on its face) claim. You need to stop being so gullible and actually use your brain 😂😂
@phillyodilly @OceanPatriot9 @OceanPatriot9 is either a Russian troll or too dumb even for Twitter (and eating up the tweets from the Russian trolls). There's no other way to explain her tweets.
@OceanPatriot9 Your own article doesn't even support your claim (and that doesn't even get into the errors in the article). You're just making things up to incite people.
@gracy69epixnet You're definitely not watching the same thing everyone else is... but then again, you're a #RussianTroll
@littletomahawk @MarkDice Nobody actually supports "baby murder" lol. You're using childish and outlandish language solely for the purpose of spreading lies about others and misleading people. Sad!
@Brown43Doug @ntbay @ColumbiaBugle @DowdEdward @POTUS So... your complaint about the Dems is that they have a cohesive party message... while also lauding the GOP base for sticking to a party message... you get the absurdity in that, right?
@olamilekansi4 @ColumbiaBugle @POTUS The BS is that he clearly doesn't understand what he is and isn't able to do...
@ntbay @ColumbiaBugle @DowdEdward @POTUS It's become clear that @POTUS  has no clue what the legal standard is. Either that or he's planning to try, knowing he'll fail, just so he can cry to his base about how he tried. If he couldn't get it done with a R House and Senate he's just not capable of getting it done.
@Jude11415 @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS They're not bailing themselves out on anything. Trump made a VERY stupid promise and now it's clear he's not going to be able to keep it. It's more accurate to say Trump dug a hole for himself and now he needs the Dems to bail him out but they're not doing it.
@Brownfractals @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It's wrong to say Dems don't care about DACA. But that doesn't mean that Trump's offer was a good offer (or even a defensible offer, it was horribly lopsided despite having no negotiating leverage). Trump failed the negotiation then tried to hold DACA hostage.
@Brownfractals @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Legal analysts are saying declaring a National Emergency is unlikely to work. Declaring one would just be for show. Trump is unlikely to get any money for wall. He'll have to settle for current Dem offer (money for border sec but no wall) and try to sell it as a sad "victory"
@Brownfractals @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I agree that opening the govt without funding was negotiating in good faith (finally). But he wasn't negotiating in good faith before that, despite having zero leverage. He totally blew this one.
@Brownfractals @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It would be better for Dems to get them protection but it didn't justify the cost. Trump wasn't negotiating in good faith so there wasn't much Dems could do.
@Jude11415 @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I just don't see what the Dems motive is to give a wall. Most of the country is now anti-wall, his approval rating has been trashed, and most of the country blames him for the shutdown. He backed himself into a corner. Why would the Dems bail him out?
@Brownfractals @dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The Dems position isn't anti-DACA but that it wasn't worth trading the wall for it. This was a pretty transparent attempt at strong-arming the Dems and they weren't willing to legitimize Trump's attempts to negotiate in bad faith.
@dochartdc @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I don't think there's any way to spin this for Trump other than a clear loss.
Looks like @realDonaldTrump is admitting defeat to the Dems over the shutdown. No way to spin this as anything but a bad loss.
@JLNCollection @Lrihendry I think the more likely answer is that his client (Trump) is impulsive, inconsistent, and has a short memory. Taping him was probably how Cohen kept everything straight and covered himself from potential fallout if Trump forgot what he told him to do.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @999VBDV It's irrelevant because McConnell left. The Senate can't vote as long as McConnell is gone. But you don't care about facts, do you?
@LisaMei62 @tevet You do realize there are more that two options right? Or are your really dumb enough to think that the rest all walked across the border at points without entries?
@dennis_sorce @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Experts say the wall won't do much good but will cost a lot of money. Friends of Trump are rumored to be the beneficiary of any wall. Start steel tariffs then call for a steel wall... weird plan right? Follow THAT money. The wall is just a politic stunt that pays his friends
@Jimgarr40404874 @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump A stupid attempt at a lame joke. The moon landing was researched under Democratic presidents lmao.
@JohnGunson @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Yup. It's a problem that needs to be fixed but instead of a real solution to immigration Trump got fixated on this stupid wall and can't let it go. A wall won't work but I'm sure he thinks it sounds impressive.
@EifertMathew @LoveJuggernaut @JackPosobiec @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer The other problem, of course, is that a $5b wall won't have much affect on illegal immigration, drugs, or crime, but would be expensive and damage the environment. It's a waste of money.
@EifertMathew @LoveJuggernaut @JackPosobiec @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Yes, I see at least part of the problem. You were apparently fooled into believing things that didn't happen. We didn't hand over any cash, it unfroze assets that already belonged to them. It sounds like you're getting your info from bad sources.
@EifertMathew @LoveJuggernaut @JackPosobiec @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I'm not pretending to be Scalia lol. It's pretty obvious I'm not.		But you clearly have no worthwhile thoughts to add, or you would have made an actual point instead of just being a snowflake about it.
@LoveJuggernaut @JackPosobiec @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Donald Trump has verifiably lied more things than any other POTUS on record. Using his tweets as a source for your point is hilaiously stupid. Your own article even quotes GOPs saying Trump was demanding too much!! 😂
@Lord_o_Flys @Scully64 @AOC And it's not going to her. I'm thinking you don't understand taxes?
@Lord_o_Flys @Scully64 @AOC Unless you make over $10m in income/year (and judging by your typing, you definitely don't) it doesn't affect you, so no, she's not in your pocketbook and it's not your money. Plus her proposal isn't even that high by US historical standards.
@Joshcha03559272 @MarkDice @AOC So AOC isn't a progressive? She's just returning America to it's former policies? Interesting take.
@tevet It is a fact that there are ongoing criminal invs that have implicated him and have already resulted in convictions. It's a fact that he lied about the facts underlying the investigations. It's a fact he admitted to obstruction (firing Comey re Russia inv) on TV. Should I go on?
@k7keith7 @Danny86300305 @charliekirk11 You live in a tiny state that gets the same representation in the Senate as larger states like NY, CA, or TX. This causes small states like NH or WY to be historically over-represented when determining policy. You're complaining about something that benefits you.
@LoveJuggernaut @JackPosobiec @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer That's not really accurate. Trump demanded a one-sided deal on the wall and even refused Pence's attempts to compromise with Dems. He's not negotiating and he has no leverage, so the Dems have no reason to budge until he starts trying. He's not leading, he's just pouting.
@tevet It takes a lot of willful ignorance to act like impeachment is only about "hating" him. Did she forget about Mueller or any of the other allegations?
@JamaalRPorter @JackPosobiec Congrats, this is the dumbest wall argument I've seen yet. Smh what an embarrassment.
@LoveJuggernaut @JackPosobiec @TheDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Probably true because Trump wouldn't read it or pay attention to anything other than the wall, but it would never get out of the Senate.
@b3g11 @JackPosobiec You do realize that a wall across the entire southern border is VERY different than a wall around a house... right?
@LisaMei62 @digi1lam I don't think @RealJamesWoods can last more than a minute or two without an unhinged rant. It'd definitely be fun to watch.
@dougflo77128849 @faisal_matahari @winstonCovfefe @CryptoGayGuy At least you're open about the fact that your problem with them is just that you're a bigot.		You dont get to choose which God is "okay" or "not okay" to pray to. America has freedom of religion. There are plenty of other countries without religious tolerance if that's your thing
@BAB2532 @winstonCovfefe @Sue564 Yeah, how dare they enjoy freedom of religion! Their exercise of their constitutional rights needs to be stopped. I like your idea of a hate crime, maybe that will stop them from enjoying the Bill of Rights!!!
@billybr61 @winstonCovfefe Fortunately, most people are smart enough to realize that gas prices are only a small piece of life. Unfortunately, some people aren't.
@DarryDekens1 Smh. You don't seem to understand that not all walls are the same. Repeating broad generalizations (eg walls can "stop people &amp; objects from entering unauthorized areas") is just stupid and trying to obfuscate the point. Its not about "walls" as a general idea.
@Joshcha03559272 @MarkDice @AOC It's a progressive marginal tax rate. It only affects the top tax bracket and is still low by historical standards. If that's "socialist" then Amercia is a socialist country. Just go look at the top marginal tax rate in the decades before Reagan.
@DarryDekens1 @BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi It doesn't matter what I "see." It's stupid to base an opinion on this off of anecdotes or generalizations. What matters is that experts in the field say a wall would be ineffective, cause environmental problems and be expensive. I dont like wasting money on things that wont work
@DarryDekens1 @BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi And that's not what's happening here. It sounds like you've been tricked by propaganda.
@DarryDekens1 @BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi Merely declaring something true doesn't make it true. There's piles and piles of evidence out there that disagree with your claims.
@DarryDekens1 @BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi Except those things aren't happening in a way that would justify the wall. You keep saying it works with no support, just bald assertions. The fact is, the wall just doesn't make economic or nat sec sense, it's purely a political stunt. You need to get out of your echo chamber.
@DarryDekens1 @BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi Most of them are legally entering then overstaying visas (66% of illegal immigrants in 2014 according to CMS). A wall would have no effect on them. Some studies have even found that a wall would actually INCREASE illegal immigrants by reducing seasonal workers returning to Mexico
@GroverNorquist @HKirsh1 @GroverNorquist CLEARLY has to know that what he's saying is inaccurate (70% is marginal tax on $10m+). If he didn't he wouldn't be qualified for his job. So does that mean he's intentionally lying to try and manipulate people? I think that's the only reasonable conclusion.
@DarryDekens1 @BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi You do realize that a) zombie movies aren't real, and b) every border/country is different, right? Just because something works in one scenario doesn't mean it's not a stupid idea in a different one. Most of our illegal immigrants don't walk across the southern border.
@dlhuffmanjr @BentleyJodi @SpeakerPelosi I think she'd be fine with you doing the same as her and building a wall around your property. Wanting a wall around a house doesn't mean a wall on the southern border is necessarily also a good idea.
@robjimmyerts @EricHow04464909 @BentleyJodi @fatoldbag @SpeakerPelosi I think most Dems would support that. It's the GOP that's been blocking requests for tax returns. I wonder why that is...
@BentleyJodi @ConfusedEnginee @wls72160 @SpeakerPelosi A wall around a house is economically feasible and has been shown to be effective. A wall across the southern border is expensive and experts say it won't significantly curb illegal immigration (because most don't walk across the border).
@InflationF @Joshcha03559272 @MarkDice @AOC It worked out great, we turned into an economic powerhouse. And our global economic position has been slipping ever since it was lowered in the 80s with Reagan. The numbers speak for themselves.
@Joshcha03559272 @MarkDice @AOC I'm sure she would be willing to pay the taxes required by her own proposal. It's laughably stupid to suggest she wouldn't. Smh it's like all logic disappears when people talk about AOC.
@renravan @charliekirk11 They don't want open borders now. Border security is great but the wall is a waste of money. Experts say it won't really help curb illegal immigration. It's a stupid idea, it doesn't matter who is pushing it.
@badgetoskirt @charliekirk11 That didn't happen.
@charliekirk11 Because the ACA had actual benefits. Experts say the wall won't actually "secure our border and strengthen our country." It's just a political stunt Trump can't let go. 		Sometimes I wonder if @charliekirk11 is really this dumb or if it's all just a character he plays.
@Joshcha03559272 @MarkDice @AOC That 70% was only for income over $10mil (and still wouldn't be as high as taxes used to be)
@dutchguitar @MarkDice @AOC Considering that it was a marginal tax only affecting income over $10m, I'd guess no.
@objectivistar @alllibertynews @katyperry @justinbieber @Oprah @TheEllenShow @BarackObama @rihanna @taylorswift13 @ladygaga @selenagomez @AynRandInst @FoxNews @TheFive A more accurate analogy would be that wanting a wall for border security is like using the birth control pill to prevent STDs. Border security is a great goal but the wall won't do much to prevent illegal immigration.
@TheSeanMcGough @MarkDice It's pretty laughable that @MarkDice (of all people) is criticizing someone else's parenting.
@MarkDice Silly @MarkDice doesn't understand a joke because he has the intellectual capacity of a child. Poor thing.
America has no Def Sec, no AG, and no Chief of Staff. The stock market is in shambles, ISIS just got a reboot, and the government is about to shut down. Is this "winning"? It doesn't feel like winning.
@soopahgenius @MarkDice There are a few ways, e.g. you can be born a citizen but not learn English. There is no national language.
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump And whatever helps you feel better for falling for an obvious scam
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump Americans laugh at people who do stupid things every day. I'd say falling for such an obvious scam counts...
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump If you donated knowing it was a scam but having an ulterior motive, that's your call. But I don't support scammers, even if some of the scammed claim they were okay with being scammed. It's a scam, plain and simple, and it would be unamerican to support scamming fellow Americans
@O_IrishT @ca_godwin @cs00582scs @andrea77214732 @POTUS Who has no legal obligation to give the money to anyone. And there's no logical way for it to be successful. Even at 2 million donors at the current pace it'll only fund ~2% of the wall (with none left for upkeep). It's obvious on its face that the money won't go to a wall.
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump You're trying to find good in it to make excuses for the fact it's just taking money from the gullible. At the end of the day the money won't go towards a wall and it won't get refunded.
@HouseCracka The guy hosting it. It's an obvious scam.
@pigeye007 @Fuctupmind Yeah, he's already wildly successful and retired. Oh well.
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump I never said you were an asshole. All I said is you fell for an obvious scam.
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump Youve assumed my beliefs even though it's irrelevant. All Ive said is this is an obvious scam. Its too late for some but hopefully calling attention to it will save others from falling for it (&amp; people can laugh at others for falling for an obvious scam, but theyre still victims)
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump More whataboutism. I haven't said anything about welfare or socialism. All I've said is that you fell for an obvious scam. For what it's worth I don't mean to patronize you for falling for the scam. Falling for a scam doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a victim.
@dubbletee66 @mitchellvii You're calling for the POTUS to ignore the Constitution and the rule of law?? VERY unamerican and just pathetic.
@KaranStJohn @mitchellvii Or he's interpreting and following the law...
@toolfool @mitchellvii That'd be ignoring/defying the Constitution.
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump Classic whataboutism. But all you're saying is there is hypothetically something he could do (if everything goes right, which is unlikely) so that it ends up not being a scam. It's FAR more likely than not that a) no wall is built, and b) these donors never see their money again
@OcalaTop @mitchellvii Lithium batteries plus solar panels sufficient to electrify a fence to a level that would deter immigrants (plus upkeep!) would be massively expensive and inefficient. You're clearly no Sherlock if you think that's how electricity works 😂😂
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump It has shown that 0.007% of the country is willing to pay for it. Hardly enough in a democracy. And Congress passing a bond act (which they won't) is irrelevant. This GoFundMe me is a scam, plain and simple. #MakeAmericaGriftAgain
@Fitz78T @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Hasn't this already been covered to death? And it's totally irrelevant to this point. Drop the whataboutism.
@JamieG1972 @mitchellvii This is a scam...
@MyrtleBeachWeek @mitchellvii It's a scam lol
@OcalaTop @mitchellvii You're clearly not an engineer because that wouldn't work (and actually electrifying it would be cost prohibitive)
@ca_godwin @cs00582scs @andrea77214732 @POTUS This one won't be rolled over because it's a pretty transparent scam...
@Xianleather @cs00582scs @POTUS Then you fell for a scam... this guy has no legal obligation to give the money to the gov't for a wall.
@bbute This is a scam... he has no legal obligation to give that money to anyone. It's sad how many people have already been victimized by this.
@freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump DC Chronicle is a trash website. Why does anyone care what they think?
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump Simple math says it won't fund the wall (at current rates even with 2 mil donors, which won't happen, it would fund about 2% of the wall, without accounting for upkeep). Misappropriation is donating it to a different cause, like vets or, more likely, himself #YouGotPlayedForAFool
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump So you're saying you have blind trust in someone you've never met to handle more money than they've ever seen, and even if they do misappropriate it, you're okay with that because of your blind trust? Lmao!! #SuckerBornEveryMinute
@ohmercy_me @Cattalyzt @Gingrich_of_PA @JeanneLoberg @realDonaldTrump 1) that's not how appropriations works, and 2) much MUCH more importantly, this guy has no legal obligation to send the money anywhere. He's effectively scammed $1.5mil from gullible people (and growing!)
@mikePdu02 @Gingrich_of_PA @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, there's been little to no winning.
@flm22 @Gettingtrump @LisaMei62 That's not what I said, what I said is that listing people doesn't make things like Pizzagate true. There's honestly not a single sane person on the planet that still believes in that 😂😂😂 you discredited yourself the second you tried to push Pizzagate
@flm22 @Gettingtrump @LisaMei62 Listing a bunch of people doesn't make thoroughly debunked things suddenly become true 😂😂
@flm22 @Gettingtrump @LisaMei62 You just listed a bunch of things that have been debunked as conspiracy theory. You honestly still believe Pizzagate? That was THOROUGHLY debunked. The building didn't even have a basement! Even Fox says it was debunked! You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
@Gettingtrump @flm22 @LisaMei62 You have no evidence of that (because there isn't any). It was investigated (TEN times!) and no evidence of a "setup" was found. It's just a conspiracy theory. The reason it wasn't adjudicated is because the investigators didn't find evidence to support adjudication.
@QuillnInk1776 @Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 How can it be "proof" if there's no actual evidence of criminal conduct worthy of jail time? You can't start with the assumption that crimes were committed then use a lack of prosecution as "proof" of a conspiracy.
@AnglesOfVenus What happens if that person decides to just keep all the money? This seems like a scam.
@QuillnInk1776 @Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 That it happened isn't a conspiracy. That there's a deep state conspiracy to cover up wrongdoing is CERTAINLY a conspiracy theory.
@AnglesOfVenus @LisaMei62 @digi1lam If that's true then I'm sorry to hear that you wasted years of your life. What effect does your "research" actually have on the world? What has it accomplished? Other than leading you to believe in a conspiracy theory, nothing.
@Hatchetpacker83 @QuillnInk1776 @LisaMei62 You're using strained logic. Of course we're pursuing the foriegn perpetrators, but it's silly to say we must be doing it as a tool to investigate domestic issues. Logic says that 10 (6 by GOP!) investigations would have found SOMETHING if there was any truth to the conspiracy.
@QuillnInk1776 @Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 You're just saying that something must be happening because there's no evidence it isn't happening. There's no evidence it is happening. Trump has been in office nearly two years and there hasn't been a word about it (and it wouldn't take 2 years to review already known info).
@DLZMAGA @LisaMei62 @digi1lam Twitter is NOT the place to rely on for info 😂😂😂 no wonder you believe the false narratives!
@DLZMAGA It's accurate. Did you watch the clip?
@QuillnInk1776 @Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 That's not reopening the domestic investigations, that's continuing to pursue the foreign perpetrators. Way different. Trump hasn't done anything re: allegations of domestic wrongdoing.
@QuillnInk1776 @Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 So you're saying GOP leadership is corrupt? What about Trump? He has access to all of the classified info but he hasn't reopened anything. Why not? Either there's nothing to see there, he's corrupt, or he's wildly incompetent. Those are the only three options.
@DeltaTheBravo @LisaMei62 @digi1lam So you're saying the investigators (GOP leadership) are incompetent? What about Trump? He has access to all the info but hasn't done anything with it.
@DLZMAGA @LisaMei62 @digi1lam It's unfortunate that you're not open to new info or a different perspective, but you have the right to approach things that way if that's what you want to do. Merry Xmas!
@DeltaTheBravo @LisaMei62 @digi1lam If it wasn't thoroughly investigated despite six (SIX!) GOP-led investigations, the only possible reason is that GOP leadership (including Trump, who hasn't pursued the issue) is 100% incompetent. Is that what you believe?
@DavisVjdavis60 @Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 If there really was evidence showing that Hillary and co committed crimes re: Benghazi, don't you think Trump would have done something or said something? He has access to all the info and he wants to lock her up. If there was really something here he would be all over it.
@DLZMAGA @LisaMei62 @digi1lam So the first TEN didn't get the result you liked, including six run by the GOP, so you assume everyone involved was corrupt? That takes some real mental gymnastics. 		And if there really was damming info out there about Benghazi, don't you think Trump would be using it?
@flm22 @Gettingtrump @LisaMei62 It takes a lot of mental gymnastics/belief in conspiracy to think that hundreds of Americans (including mostly GOP) would know damming info and not say anything or do anything. Unfortunately the attack has been used as a political chip by talking heads + people have fallen for it
@Twyztyd @LisaMei62 @digi1lam Sometimes bad things happen and sometimes tough decisions don't work out well. That doesn't mean a crime was committed. It's already been investigated ten times, and six of those were GOP. Either the GOP leadership is WILDLY incompetent or punishment wasn't justified by the facts
@tonnabonnona @LisaMei62 @digi1lam What a silly answer. It's sad that people died but that doesn't justify endless investigations. It's already been investigated ten times.
@AnglesOfVenus @LisaMei62 @digi1lam And you assume it's not the truth based on what? Do you have secret knowledge the GOP investigators didn't? You just don't like that it doesn't fit your narrative.
@DavisVjdavis60 @LisaMei62 @digi1lam The decision has been investigated and vetted over and over again by dozens if not hundreds of officials. What makes you think that you, sitting behind a keyboard, have knowledge that GOP investigators didn't?
@Gettingtrump @LisaMei62 @flm22 The first investigation wasn't a stunt. But there have been 10 investigations, 6 of which were led by the GOP. It's one of the most investigated events in recent history, yet the right claims it's still not enough. At some point it absolutely became a GOP political stunt.
@Hatchetpacker83 @LisaMei62 So you're claiming something that you have zero evidence for and isn't supported by any of the 10 investigations that have been done into the matter (6 by the GOP)? 		I don't think anyone is dumb enough to believe you on this.
@jjilmary @LisaMei62 I think the political stunt is that it's been investigated TEN times (six by GOP committees) and none have found wrongdoing, yet people still try to use it for political purposes. How is that not a political stunt?
@LisaMei62 @digi1lam To be fair, the first investigation wasn't a political stunt, but bringing it up over and over after it's already been thoroughly investigated is certainly a political stunt. How many hearings do we have to have before people are satisfied?
@SirClopton @Cory_1077 It sounds like you've been duped into believing narratives that aren't supported by facts. Clinton didn't have the power to sell uranium (she wasn't the deciding vote) and there's no evidence Mueller delivered anything. You've been played for a fool.		https://t.co/QVZbQ6DL3m
@charliekirk11 They just voted for a $26 billion border security package to move out of committee. Once again, @charliekirk11 is trying to manipulate people and ignoring the facts.
@theMichele526 @steph93065 Did you read yesterday's memo? He clearly broke the law and they have evidence to prove it. He's a criminal.
@steph93065 The memo released yesterday shows that he did lie. There's really not any way to defend him at this point.
@KerriMeine @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Both the Steinle and Tibbets families have been adamant that they don't want their daughters' deaths used as political ammo (and that the women wouldn't have wanted it either). Have some respect.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I feel so badly for the Steinle family. They've been adamant that they don't want her death to be politicized but slime like @charliekirk11 don't care and are even willing to fudge the facts to do it.
@clayranck @Kaysuede @charliekirk11 His "facts" never hold up. That's his thing.
@FR81771958 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 All I've said is that @charliekirk11 is dishonest and/or inaccurate. Saying that other people are dishonest or inaccurate doesn't excuse @charliekirk11 being dishonest or inaccurate.
@FR81771958 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 Sadly, many people don't realize that @charliekirk11 posts false facts and tries to manipulate people. And maybe the problem is that people are too close minded to let their minds be changed? You've been given govt statistics showing he's wrong and you don't care. Why not?
@Think51783608 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 You're starting with the assumption that it's acceptable for others to do what @charliekirk11 does (it's not) to justify him doing it. That's prime mental gymnastics. A liar is a liar. Don't defend dishonesty (or, if it's unintentional, which I don't believe it is, sloppiness).
@FR81771958 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 So your issue is you don't agree with the source of the statistics (i.e., the govt)? Or you're saying your stats background leads you to prefer totally unsourced stats (like @charliekirk11 gave) over sourced stats?
@FR81771958 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 And how does that undermine the govt statistics he linked? You're just dismissing his stats because you don't like his conclusions. Get out of your echo chamber.
@FR81771958 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 There are mountains of news articles/tweets/etc breaking down his inaccuracies. You can easily Google it. Just glancing over this post there are a few people doing it for this one. See, e.g.,	 https://t.co/XEihcYtxus
@Think51783608 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 I didn't say anything about anybody else. I'm talking about @charliekirk11. You're trying to change the topic to other people. And even so, other people being inaccurate doesn't excuse @charliekirk11 being inaccurate/dishonest. Dishonesty is bad, it doesn't matter what others do.
@Think51783608 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 Classic "whataboutism." You can't argue that @charliekirk11 isn't dishonest/inaccurate (it's easily proven) so you're trying to shift the point to "what about [unrelated things]". What you said has nothing to do with the original point.
@FR81771958 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 No, @charliekirk11 is well know to post misleading or outright false statistics to push his narrative (like he did here) because he relies on people being too lazy to look them up themselves. Sadly, it works.
@Think51783608 @blakEr0ck4rd5 @charliekirk11 @charliekirk11 is well know to post misleading or outright false statistics to push his narrative (like he did here) because he relies on people being too lazy to look them up themselves. Sadly, it works.
@CarmineZozzora No... the NRA allegedly accepting Russian money and arranging meetings for them with GOP officials is NOT the same as a foreign country attempting to hack US computers. The fact that I even have to write that is astounding.
@TroyHulstine You don't seem to know what a stereotype is...
@TroyHulstine Lmao I wasn't calling you racist because you were being mean. It was the racist part I was calling racist. Why is that so hard to understand?
@ZeroOpie @999VBDV Lmao this author is trying way too hard to take the comments out of context and make something out of nothing. It takes some real mental gymnastics to spin his comments that far. Or just dishonesty, I guess.
@TroyHulstine So you're saying you used "racially charged" language to insult someone when your issue with them had nothing to do with race? Yeah, that's textbook racism. Is it really that hard to leave race out of things that aren't related to race? Why did you use racially charged language?
@cdiedrick @ChuckCallesto @cdiedrick I have more issue with your DMs 😂😂. You must be pretty insecure because this is not how normal, well-adjusted people act. How dare someone point out your error? I hope you're not teaching your kid it's okay to be this much of a snowflake and act this way. https://t.co/VR6RsMMJZN
@TIGGERR00 @chuckwoolery @FSPat80 @BreitbartNews I don't think you're a victim because you disagree with me lmao. I think you're a victim because you're clearly regurgitating a narrative that you're not smart enough to see through. You've been played for a fool.
@cdiedrick @ChuckCallesto 6 year olds can't join Boy Scouts. If you're going to lie at least make it believable.
@TIGGERR00 @chuckwoolery @FSPat80 @BreitbartNews Just because you can't understand the law doesn't mean that the law is wrong. You've made it pretty clear that you have zero clue what you're talking about.
@TIGGERR00 @chuckwoolery @FSPat80 @BreitbartNews Wow you really have zero clue how the world or legal system works. Maybe read a book? Or go outside? This is just laughably stupid. It's clear that you've been duped into believing an illogical narrative. Who victimized you?
@TroyHulstine I never said you were being mean (that's irrelevant). I said you're being racist, and you are. And I've since realized that you're so racist you view this level of racism as "normal." That doesn't mean you're not racist, you absolutely are. It just means I pity you for it.
@charliekirk11 @TroyHulstine Just because some walls are a good idea doesn't mean ALL walls are. What a stupid tweet.
@TroyHulstine Wow you really are too dumb to get this. Even if that statistic you just made up is true, you're using it in a racist way. I really do pity you if you can't wrap your head around it.
@TroyHulstine Wow, more racism. You're assuming their dads aren't present because of stereotypes. And, again, them being black has nothing to do with their bad behavior. Just call them POSs. You don't have to bring race into non-race things. That's just being racist.
@TroyHulstine Correct, it was racist before I pointed it out. It didn't magically become racist once I said something 😂😂😂
@TroyHulstine No, but a) you didn't give any statistics, and b) applying stereotypes about a race to an individual you know nothing about is pretty much the definition of racism. Statistics might not be racist, but you sure are.
@TroyHulstine Nah, but I know that calling someone "black pieces of shit" and telling them to go visit their dads in jail is racist. You don't know their families and their race has nothing to do with the clip, but you're using a lame stereotype and trying to make their race relevant.
@TroyHulstine Wow. Either you're trolling (badly) or you're so racist that even blatant racism seems "normal" to you. Very sad, very unamerican.
@TroyHulstine No, it was everything else in the tweet. Pretty obvious...
@TroyHulstine Wow. Most people try to hide their racism, but you're explicit about it. People like you (and comments like this) are a big part of why people connect MAGA and racism.
@ANGELAHLEONG @KamalaHarris That $150bil wasn't *sent* to Iran. It was just unfrozen. Get your facts straight. #cantfixstupid
@marlow_marlow2 @sotnak @BobbyM62 @KamalaHarris Israel is a completely different situation. Study after study has shown it would be expensive and ineffective. That has nothing to do with supporting or not supporting Trump. A bad idea is a bad idea no matter who it comes from.
@TIGGERR00 @chuckwoolery @FSPat80 @BreitbartNews We're not talking about telling "nosy strangers" your secrets. We're talking about whether someone with Flynn's background should know that lying to law enforcement officials is unlawful / obstruction of justice (hint: yes! His excuse that he wasn't warned holds no water).
@BrigdonStacy @RealJack @SaziCakes Congrats, you've been suckered. Have fun giving the fraud your money!
@RealJack @say3738 I think a lot of people would be surprised because that's illogical and not how the world works.
@GorillaBaz @Cernovich Wow. Are you really glorifying a child murderer? If that's who you revere what does that say about you?
@Jim1961 @Cernovich Only morons believe in deep state.
@MrThomasFord @Cernovich Shhhhh, @Cernovich doesn't care about facts, just spin.
@kennypowersKP @BigTexHat @Cernovich Wow. It takes some serious mental gymnastics to paint honesty as a liability.
@AlexN1952 @ColumbiaBugle It's just another mismanaged business that failed. That's how capitalism works.
@ColumbiaBugle @steph93065 It's just capitalism at work. If you can't run a profitable business...
@geniekri @chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Yeah! How was an experienced military man supposed to know not to lie to law enforcement officials?? They set the poor guy up!
@chuckwoolery @FSPat80 @BreitbartNews It's so weird that an experienced military officer didn't realize he shouldn't lie to law enforcement officials. They should have told him! How else could he know not to lie??
@RealJamesWoods @ChristieC733 Oh @RealJamesWoods, such a snowflake that he can't handle someone speaking a language other than English.
@wannabe_expats @franksdcaudill @BuckSexton Some walls (or portions) make more sense than others. That's what Trump is too obstinate to realize.
@BuckSexton Wow, weird. It's almost like not all walls are equal, and some might make sense while others don't...
@IrishVol69th @LindaRockers Every time I hear them referred to as an "invasion" I just think about how cowardly that sounds. The US has a massive military yet people are concerned that a few refugees is an "invasion"? You clearly have no faith in or respect for our military if you think this is an invasion.
@mitchellvii @HillaryClinton What a shocker, @mitchellvii is making things up again. Why does anyone listen to this moron?
@gmanos1926 @ChatByCC ... you don't seem to understand how the law works...
This article is so painful to read that it makes me embarrassed to share a name with the author's institution. Who gets this offended by (and reads this much into) a yard sign? The author needs to ditch his victim complex.		https://t.co/LNzcpfY0Uj
@MarkDice @999VBDV This is an incredibly stupid attempt to make something out of nothing. You do realize that there's no national language, right?
@whyzee61 @morningmika @SenatorDurbin The "ape" comment wasn't a use of a common but problematic saying, it was an unambiguous attempt to make a racist comment. And you're also ignoring the co-stars who said she wasn't right, or the Twitter rants. It's a laughably bad comparison. Stop being such a snowflake.
@whyzee61 @morningmika @SenatorDurbin Roseanne said multiple things that were problematic on their face including openly racist attacks (not a common phrasing that has problematic roots) and only apologized for some of it (and not immediately). That's a terrible comparison.
@LisaMei62 @ArleenCandiott1 @BreitbartNews So... nearly 1/3 of all voters support it?
@whyzee61 @morningmika @SenatorDurbin Fire someone over an unintentionally poor word choice they immediately retracted? You're the very definition of "snowflake."
@Barnes_Law @steph93065 Wow you really have no idea what you're talking about. Are you sure you're a lawyer?
Today the former deputy finance chair of the RNC was sentenced to 3 years in jail for fraudulent campaign activity during the 2016 presidential election. Think about that.
@whyzee61 @Ocasio2018 Uhh... that's literally the Trumps' go-to move - point out others' perceived faults to try and make themselves look better. How hypocritical of you.
@HouseCracka https://t.co/KXCMgrA6bd
@RodStryker @JVER1 https://t.co/EiI1e2zrQb
@Prayingmom77 None of those countries are shouting that they want Trump. There's no evidence for it. No audio, no video, no firsthand witnesses, nothing. You've been duped.
@danschex @999VBDV LOL you clearly didn't watch the same thing the rest of the world watched. There's a reason Trump threw his papers in a tantrum at the end-he broke down and got embarrassed on national TV!
@drakeu85 @Tommy_tt1 @luckymee22 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump That meeting showed pretty clearly that he's horrible when challenged face-to-face. I guess he can only counter punch from behind a keyboard? No wonder so many trolls like him!
@GOPChairwoman @bn81159 @realDonaldTrump It's almost like they supported improving border security but not economically irresponsible policy... weird.
@Calidreth @JackPosobiec And you don't have to do it here because the left isn't waging a war on Xmas. The overwhelming majority of people on the left don't care what holiday people celebrate. Jack just likes claiming victimhood.
@somuch_depends @charliekirk11 Lmao @charliekirk11 can't give sources. If he had to give sources he wouldn't be able to keep saying things that aren't true!!
@RogerBarker5 This is so dumb I literally can't stop laughing lmao. It's easy to Google that there's no evidence it happened and the lie came from Rush. You think something is true just because there's no proof it's false? Not how the world works lol! No wonder you're so easily fooled!! 😂😂😂
@RogerBarker5 Care to provide a link? Or is this just another example of making things up and claiming there's evidence with no proof, like Rush did to start this whole thing?
@biancasprinkles @JackPosobiec Lmao you really don't get it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.		Those links are definitions for "urban" and "urbane". They're not the same word. Maybe the third time is the charm...		https://t.co/1FuuJkytRA		https://t.co/HtJdqcBHxn
@biancasprinkles @JackPosobiec Again, "urban" and "urbane" are not the same word (but they do have the same Latin root). It doesn't matter if Trump is from a city--that's urban, not urbane. Just look the word up lmao, don't double down on using it incorrectly.
@MindyGr39194656 @JackPosobiec Lmao what does that even mean?
@Ken_Coulson @JackPosobiec ... you're asking why someone would believe a decorated law enforcement official with an unimpeachable record and bipartisan support? Over someone that has been provably dishonest literally every day of the presidency? You need to open your eyes and stop drinking the KoolAid lmao
@fjdinardo @JackPosobiec Showing your true colors... fortunately most Americans don't support crime (unlike you, apparently!)
@Marchandbruin1 @JackPosobiec No, anyone who loves this country cares and wants to know what the truth is. Anyone who says they'll support Trump even if he committed felonies to become POTUS isn't a patriotic American. We're a democratic republic, not a dictatorship.
@Bryan11965883 @JackPosobiec To be clear, there is zero evidence that anyone in France is calling for Trump. No first hand witnesses, no video, no audio. Rush Limbaugh claimed he "heard it from a friend" and that was good enough "journalism" for his supporters. It spread from there. Rush just made it up 😂😂
@elmleerockstone @JackPosobiec You couldn't have done better than zero substance or effort? ... that's sad.
@AbrohamLincol10 @JackPosobiec No... that's not how the global economy or the Paris Agreement works.
@foxielives @JackPosobiec @scott_felps "Urbane" is a positive quality... the only way your attempted jab works is if you're confusing it with "urban." Not a good look to spin something into an insult if you don't even know what the words mean...
@ccastlex23 @JackPosobiec @GodlessNZ To be clear there's literally no evidence for that "we want Trump" claim. No witnesses on the record, no video, no audio. Limbaugh claimed he "heard it from a friend," that was all the "journalism" Charlie Kirk needed to repeat it as fact, then Trump said it. Rush made it up lmao
@donotcongratula @JackPosobiec Standard for Jack lmao. Low effort, low accuracy, and propaganda. Unfortunately the sheep don't think for themselves.
@biancasprinkles @JackPosobiec Except it's not accurate lmao. "Urbane" doesn't mean "coming from a city". That's "urban." But hey I guess you can use any word to describe anyone if you just make up the definition! 😂😂😂 The silliness and ignorance is incredible.
@LauraR77 @biancasprinkles @JackPosobiec @JoyAnnReid Except it's not accurate lmao. "Urbane" doesn't mean "coming from a city". That's "urban." But hey I guess you can use any word to describe anyone if you just make up the definition! 😂😂😂
@suscepit @AltheDentist @LabRatRho @JackPosobiec Well now you're just changing the topic and putting words in my mouth. I guess you didn't like being criticized for supporting child murder?
@suscepit @AltheDentist @LabRatRho @JackPosobiec Honestly, you're defending child murderers by saying they murdered the children in a nicer way than burning them alive. Personally, I think all child murderers are bad. I don't care how much stress the gov't is causing you, murdering your own children is wrong.
@suscepit @AltheDentist @LabRatRho @JackPosobiec Sure, mercy-killing can be better than letting them die in a fire, but you're starting with the assumption that they HAD to murder the children. They didn't have to kill those children. They could have let them live. They chose to murder them.
@ClydeMarcantel @Tom4CongressNY6 @JackPosobiec Lol especially if there's hard evidence, like recordings of them talking about it...
@ClydeMarcantel @Tom4CongressNY6 @JackPosobiec Not disagreeing about the spectacle though, govt definitely messed it up. Doesn't excuse the BDs or their crimes though, esp their murdering of children.
@ClydeMarcantel @Tom4CongressNY6 @JackPosobiec They weren't all triple burst, some (48+ seized) were full auto, and there's audio of the BDs talking about how Koresch ordered them to start the fires. And Koresch had a lawyer he retained before he died lol. Obviously he didn't try to retain one after he was dead 👻👻👻😂😂😂
@AltheDentist @LabRatRho @suscepit @JackPosobiec Uhh... are you really making excuses for murdering children? Being hassled by the govt is no excuse for shooting children point blank. It's pretty silly to blame others instead of the gunmen pulling the triggers. I bet you also think Sandy Hook shouldn't be blamed on the shooter?
@MajorMarkB @JackPosobiec So on the one hand, there is audio of the fire starters themselves talking about starting the fires... on the other hand is you saying you've listened to unnamed people with no evidence. 		I'll trust the openly available audio over someone claiming something with zero evidence...
@ClydeMarcantel @Tom4CongressNY6 @JackPosobiec Koresch's own attorney admitted they had illegal weapons, survivors admitted it too, and they seized a bunch. And there's audio of them talking about setting the fires. There's hard evidence for all of that. Sounds like YOU'RE buying the fabrication 😂😂
@LabRatRho @suscepit @JackPosobiec But a cult murdering their own members has nothing to do with totalitarianism... unless you're describing Koresch I guess.
@frankiek9191 They seized 48+ illegal automatic weapons and survivors testified they also had illegal grenades and silencers. Koresch's attorney even admitted that the BDs had illegal weapons. The BDs don't deny it.
@AltheDentist @LabRatRho @suscepit @JackPosobiec I don't see how that's relevant to the BDs murdering their children...
@RageofAchilleus @JackPosobiec I keep coming back to this and laughing so hard. You're angry about something that is just so amazingly stupid and easily disproven. It's spelled out in the First Amendment! Clearly someone has fooled you 😂😂😂😂
@RageofAchilleus @JackPosobiec We're not a Christian nation so what's your point? We have no national religion. America (and any good American) is explicitly against prostylization.
@LabRatRho @JackPosobiec Yes, by the Branch Dividians. They shot their own women and children point blank before setting themselves on fire (on orders from Koresch). The audio is very sad.
@MikeYoungLaw @Traversablmgtow @JackPosobiec It's not a great position, but there are also plenty of people in this thread and on Twitter blaming Obama for children's deaths in military strikes... it goes both ways or neither.
@dewkdewk @jmpnc7 @JackPosobiec @KFerrugia Then you imagined it. There's audio recordings of the BDs spreading accelerants and talking about how Koresch ordered them to light the fires.
@MajorMarkB @JackPosobiec That's been debunked over and over again... you have to ignore significant audio and forensic evidence to reach that conclusion...
@LabRatRho @suscepit @JackPosobiec I don't get your point... the only point blank shots fired were by the Branch Dividians murdering their own women and children before setting their own building on fire... there's even audio of it...
@frankiek9191 @hurtboxoftruth @JackPosobiec Waco had both legal and illegal weapons. The legal ones weren't the problem.
@ClydeMarcantel @Tom4CongressNY6 @JackPosobiec You're being hypocritical. The detained immigrants (most?) are seeking asylum legally. And there's legal ways to stockpile/sell firearms but the BDs/Waco did it illegally. Be pissed at the BDs who broke the law, lied to law enforcement, then set the fires and murdered the kids
@MAGAxMal @thefacialdiva @Havadonut @JackPosobiec We're not a Christian nation. We don't have a national religion. Patriotic Americans wouldn't support that sort of proselytism.
@melikopi @JackPosobiec There are holiday cards other than Xmas cards.
@RageofAchilleus @JackPosobiec This is laughably wrong... Hanukkah predates Xmas...
@JackPosobiec That's because "holiday" is broader than just Xmas... it's not denigrating Xmas, there are several holidays in the same period of time. Why do these snowflakes get so offended by people acknowledging that there are holidays besides Xmas??
@Mo_An2016 Except she is lying about that. This has been debunked over and again. Omar is the youngest of her siblings... but older than her husband. Pretty easy to prove.		BUT, even if Loomer was right on this thing (she's not) it doesn't excuse the many other times she's been caught lying
@FrankieFuller13 @pauldwilliamsjr @castatelender @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer I provided multiple links in response to her (which you obviously know because if you saw her question you also saw the response). It's telling that you replied to this Tweet, not her question/my proof, to claim that I never gave proof.		Why the dishonesty? Don't be a liar 😂😂😂
@Mo_An2016 Because she's been repeatedly debunked and outed as a liar and a fraud... haven't you been paying attention? 😂😂😂
@Mo_An2016 Again, you're just making things up. I never said I liked the ban. I said she's a fraud. I don't think anyone should listen to her (not if they have a brain, anyway) but she can shout into the void all she wants. 		You really need to stop lying... it's sad... I'll pray for you
@Mo_An2016 Where did you get that from? Because I called a fraud a fraud? Lmao the fact that your only response is to make up something off the wall says a lot about you... Oh! I get it! That's why you like Loomer, right? Liars stick together? 😂😂😂😂
@Mo_An2016 Where did you get that from? Because I called a fraud a fraud? Lmao the fact that your only response is to make up something off the wall says a lot about you... Oh! I get it! That's why you like Loomer, right? Liars stick together? 😂😂😂😂
@Mo_An2016 It only took a few seconds of browsing your Twitter to confirm that you're *definitely* drinking in Loomer's lies... I'll pray for you and I hope you learn not to follow her hatred any further... (seriously, just Google her, she's been REPEATEDLY  outed as a fraud...)
@Mo_An2016 Wow. I point out that a liar is lying and that makes me a "radical" to you? Just wow. If pro-truth is a "radical" position to you then you need to reevaluate your morals/character. 		I'm guessing you're one of the bigots she caters to?
@castatelender @pauldwilliamsjr @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer @Michelin Well, I've linked it twice and it's VERY easy too Google... 😊 I encourage you to think for yourself instead of just blindly trusting Loomer...
@therealcornett @999VBDV Promoting violence because of political differences is the very definition of terrorism... @Therealcornett
@castatelender @TrueLauraLoomer @folseinc @castatelender your tweets make a LOT more sense now... I'm very sorry to see that you're one of the people Loomer has fooled. I apologize if I was overly harsh-I dislike manipulators but I pity the manipulated. I'll pray for you, I hope you can find a better shepard/path forward
@castatelender @pauldwilliamsjr @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer @Michelin I linked it above, it's in the chain you replied to. Here's another source with the same story. I wish a bigger news agency had a link but fortunately most people won't waste their print space on Loomer.		https://t.co/NWJjQHjjRC
@castatelender @pauldwilliamsjr @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer @Michelin So, @castatelender , I have to ask... you said that you think for yourself, so, now that you have evidence that Loomer has been caught falsifying information, are you still going to blindly trust her? The evidence says she's a fraudster. Don't be a sheep, Google her yourself 😊
@castatelender @pauldwilliamsjr @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer @Michelin But, to be fair, even if she hadn't been shown (repeatedly) to be a liar, I'd dislike her anyway for her attention-seeking and immature antics. She harasses innocent people for her own personal gain because she knows she's pandering to fools who will eat it up. It's just sad.
@castatelender @pauldwilliamsjr @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer @Michelin @castatelender is a news article with photo evidence good enough for "just one time"? There's also all of the easily verified things she's got wrong when covering Parkland, but I chalked that up to her being a moron.
@castatelender @pauldwilliamsjr @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer Sure! I did in my reply to myself, but her "slashed tires" is my favorite one because it's just so stupid. Even @Michelin jumped in to call her a liar. (There are plenty of links to the story, this is just the first Google result).		https://t.co/uwjCQAtm9Q
@pauldwilliamsjr @castatelender @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer @pauldwilliamsjr Example: remember her "slashed tires"??? LMAO!!!! Or the threats she got caught faking?? She's been discredited so so many times but hey, don't let facts get in the way ;-)
@pauldwilliamsjr @castatelender @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer 1) Laura has a looooooong record of misrepresenting or just falsifying "facts." Shes a fraud, plain and simple. 2) This narrative is based on twisting Omar's quotes/religion to appeal to xenophobes. Think for yourself, dont get fooled by a con artist like Laura.
@castatelender @JackPosobiec @Mo_An2016 @LauraLoomer To be fair, it's not really "exposing" anything because the allegations that keep getting pushed about Omar have been repeatedly debunked. Unfortunately, some are appealing to racism/bigotry to discredit her, banking that others are dumb enough to not do their own fact checking
@67dfm @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas You know he won't, it'd be too damaging to him.
@PatriciaLRiver5 @bhad669 @NychelleX @MichaelAvenatti For a criminal trial. This isn't a criminal trial. There should be a higher standard (and there is) for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the country.
@John_KissMyBot What house of cards? She hasn't had a position of authority in 5.5 years. Why are people still so obsessed with her? The country has real problems to address.
@nsmith_98 @RichardFitswe13 @JackPosobiec I didn't say it was a political statement, but it's the result of politicizing tragedy. The right politicized the Benghazi tragedy to a *disgusting* degree and it's pretty obvious based on history that it wouldn't have spawned shirts like this w/o the extreme politicization
@RichardFitswe13 @nsmith_98 @JackPosobiec People who want to ignore facts and politicize tragedy.
Never forget -- 17 years ago, Trump was happy about the 9/11 attack giving him the tallest building in the area. https://t.co/J0omtC9sRg
@CassandraRules @RealAlexJones is always comedic. What's strange is that people take his "act" for news instead of the comedy relief that it is. He even admitted in court that it's just an act!
@onesoldiersmom @JackPosobiec @marcorubio @RealAlexJones He's being silenced by private industry. All his screeching about 1A just shows that he has no idea what the Constitution says.
@onesoldiersmom @JackPosobiec @marcorubio @RealAlexJones misstating facts to fit his own faked narrative? Shocking...
@JackPosobiec @999VBDV Just another example of @RealAlexJones being completely divorced from reality. Why does this surprise anyone anymore? He's a hack and a fraudster.
@Suzi3D @AdrianJeune7 @CassandraRules Also, you have to love someone from Moscow weighing in on how Americans should view the Constitution... Smh
@Suzi3D @AdrianJeune7 @CassandraRules I wouldn't say it's pro-social media, I'm literally just saying what the First Amendment does (and doesn't) do. It sounds like you have a problem with 1A and you're projecting it, but that's a different issue.
@AdrianJeune7 @CassandraRules @Suzi3D 1A just says the gov't can't punish you for protected speech. It doesn't apply to private citizens (or businesses, like Twitter, FB, etc.). Anyone saying differently has no idea what they're talking about. If you get sued for it it's because your attempt was a tort, not b/c of 1A
@patrick9271949 @DrEtiquette @SassySculptor Ah, false flag nonsense. It'd been a while since I'd seen crazy conspiracy theories peddled as facts, ever since Alex Jones had to admit in court that he made them all up. Thanks for the laugh!!
@chrismattix @HeatherMarsee @sbiv56 @EmerickTrent1 @DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump Uhhhhh you went to an unaccredited college with under 80 people per class...
@JoyOfPi @JackPosobiec Because a larger growth isn't always better? It depends on a lot of factors. Sometimes less would be better.		So no, not bias, you just don't understand what's going on.
@RemoveRINOs2018 Thank you! All donations to @ScaliaLawSchool are appreciated. If you would like to donate to @ScaliaLawSchool DM me for instructions how.
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin Exactly. Entitlements move to the highest value use regardless of initial allocation if transaction costs aren't prohibitive. There are (essentially) no transaction costs here so I think the only conclusion is that they value it less than I do.
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin I'm certainly going to read into this more with your comments in mind. Even if it was inadvertent I appreciate you tagging me and giving me something to think about.
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin To be honest I don't  think @georgemasonlaw even wants the @ScaliaLawSchool handle--they've never asked for it.
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin I fully admit I haven't read up on this matter as much as others have. But there are enough red flags that I don't think it can be brushed aside as nothing. The lack of transparency should be enough to make people skeptical.
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin Even the Koch Foundation has implicitly acknowledged that the contract provisions people are upset about are problematic--they claim they're no longer in the current contract after the FSU backlash. But we haven't seen the new contract so we just have to take their word for it?
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin University Pres Cabrera admitted that the agreements “fall short of the standards of academic independence I expect any gift to meet." And this shows that the school was, at best, highly misleading in its past statements about the donations.
@HoffProf @georgemasonlaw @FedSoc @IlyaSomin I'm not a squatter, I had this handle before the school changed it's name to Scalia Law School. #Original #Trendsetter But since you tagged me I'll say that I think you're wrong to brush these allegations aside.
@BattleBornThom @JackPosobiec This is just a list of the loony conspiracy theories that people have dreamt up. Just because it's in a meme doesn't mean it's true lmao.
@YorkieMom4Trump @Don_Vito_08 @realDonaldTrump Calm down Russia bot, the actions were a) legal and b) not done by Mueller.
Trump: I had no knowledge of Stormy Daniels payment. 		Also Trump: Looking into communications my attorney had regarding SD payment violates my A/C privilege (which could only apply if Trump was part of the comms about the payment). 		Only one can be true (or neither)!
@justicetime @1choicebailbond @awestllc @ScottPresler Yes, it has. Only conspiracy theory sites are still pushing this. Look at sources outside of your echo chamber.
@irmahinojosa_ @Keque_Mage Lame.
@JiMiZnHB @LindaRockers @LoraKayM @RealMattCouch These just aren't true. Take Foster for example... He died of ONE gunshot wound and it wasn't to the back of the head. You're just making things up to try and push a lame conspiracy theory. Kind of pathetic...
@1choicebailbond @awestllc @ScottPresler That's been pretty thoroughly debunked. Where have you been??
@MattsOurSemite @blaircottrell89 @DSA_GamerGirl What would your point be? Limit gun ownership based on race? That's unconstitutional. Or just trolling people?
@blaircottrell89 @AndrewQuackson What a stupid tweet. Even without taking a position on the issue it's pretty obvious to anyone with a brain that terrorism and homicide aren't the same thing. This is comparing two different things and acting like there's something intelligent that can be drawn from it. Just dumb
@HouseCracka SCOTUS held that abortion is protected by 14A. How can you be against 14A while simultaneously upset about 1A and 2A? Seems hypocritical.
Trump is talking about doing more to harm gun rights than any Dem president ever did but still claiming to be pro-2A. I don't get it.
@Husssein_jr @SLAMonline @KingJames @nikebasketball He already did, it was on Feb 15 or 16.
@libertyladyusa Have a good night! This made me smile--a positive tweet when most of Twitter has been negative 😊
@SandraTXAS @SaysMissy @lah3309 @Goz_1911 @SKYRIDER4538 @GaetaSusan @GemMar333 @ClintonMSix14 @LVNancy I'm not sure I follow? The armed people were useless. How does that support 2A? (Not trying to be anti-2A, I own a gun, but this wasn't a good showing for pro-2A)
@HouseCracka The false flag narrative is pathetic. It's easily disproven every time it's been alleged and it's immoral to try to go after victims for political gain.
@SteveMichael40 @LindaRockers The "crisis actor" argument is illogical and pathetic (and nonpartisan). Only truly defective minds can try and whitewash tragedy like that. Don't attack victims for political gain.
@SandraTXAS @SaysMissy @lah3309 @Goz_1911 @SKYRIDER4538 @GaetaSusan @GemMar333 @ClintonMSix14 @LVNancy Frustrating. "Good guys with guns" were there but did nothing. Doesn't help the pro-2nd argument one bit.
@DynastyDanimal @RastaCakes @CassandraRules Rasta isn't wrong. McCain served our country admirably. I understand that people disagree with his recent political decisions but that's no excuse to erase the fact that his military career is that of an American Hero.
@Forgottenone17 @CassandraRules Isn't this an odd stance for someone who has Reagan as their profile pic? Reagan had his own mental health issues--by this comment, it looks like you support him while also thinking he should have been replaced?
@redpillgreen18 @CNNPR @realDonaldTrump @CNN @TuckerCarlson @POTUS It's definitely not implied (and if the entire box is overfeeding, which you say is implied, then he did overfeed because he used the entire box). You're just making things up to be mad about.
@redpillgreen18 @CNNPR @realDonaldTrump @CNN @TuckerCarlson @POTUS What is your complaint? The headline doesn't say "overfed" anywhere. It says he fed fish and poured the entire box of food in--two claims that are clearly supported by the picture YOU posted. You're just trying to create drama that doesn't exist and being overly sensitive.
@Awoooment @TaylorLorenz @sahilkapur Why can't it be both? Cruz is his adopted name.

@realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump @WSJ Just because an individual's taxes go down doesn't mean they automatically have to favor the tax policy. There are a lot of costs to the tax plan as well (the money doesn't just come from thin air). It's 100% reasonable to say that the costs outweigh the personal benefit.
@OctoMutant @RepHagan @NIVIsa4031 @clevelanddotcom @brent_larkin The article wasn't by the left, it was by a GOP who supports her opponent. And it didn't attack her for being Christian, it criticized her for touting her Christianity while acting decidedly unChristian.
@Hoosier84 @RepHagan @clevelanddotcom Here you go: https://t.co/IuLYOapoiB		Spoiler--it doesn't say what she claims it says. It doesn't attack her for sexist reasons. The things about her religion is criticism for touting her Christianity while acting decidedly unChristian. The article supports her GOP opponent.
@JonBibbs @RepHagan @clevelanddotcom There's a reason why @RepHagan didn't link the article... It just doesn't say what she claims. She has a reputation for twisting and misrepresenting facts.
@DanaSharpe18 @bcwinbig @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump He was literally sued by the DOJ for racist discrimination violating the Fair Housing Act and has had numerous allegations of racism dating back over 40 years... 		Just because it's in a meme doesn't mean it's true.
@PatriciaDameron @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump Lol no it's very not true. Trump has been called those things for over 40 years. There are numerous people over the years who have accused him of frequently using racial slurs and rhetoric. He was even sued by the DOJ for violating the Fair Housing Act via racist discrimination.
@simplysmith @Kumpilicious66 @TreCraigGolf @magnusson_kyle @WeeNeiller @JackkCSilva @Drivincrab @FoxNews If that's the answer, why does the article complain about the "homofascist mob that boycotted their business"? That's exactly what you're saying they should do if they disagree.		As an aside, it's weird to complain about a boycott from customers the store wouldn't serve anyway...
@jkaccinni @RichardMurphyUK @ColMorrisDavis @realDonaldTrump This is a clear case of ignoring easily verified facts because they don't fit your narrative.
@2wallyworld @JaniceTXBlessed I don't think she needs more info on it because it doesn't look like she actually said it... Looks like trolls are just making things up.
@JaniceTXBlessed Do you have a source for that? I can't find any reputable source claiming she said that, only Twitter trolls. Where did you get that?
@KazmierskiR @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama ... you clearly don't understand what global warming means. One hot/cold day or week or month in one spot doesn't prove or disprove it. It's about *global* climate *warming* over time (which scientists agree is happening), not localized weather.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Isn't it a bad thing that POTUS is going out of his way to hide his actions from the public eye? What happened to transparency and draining the swamp??
@newjohnmill @josdez_76 @AnnCoulter @WorldMedia4u @josdez_76 don't worry about what this fool says, real Americans don't agree or think this way.
@newjohnmill @josdez_76 @AnnCoulter @WorldMedia4u Wowwww... Usually people try to hide their racism, but you just put it right out there for the world to see.
@Red2GenX @realDonaldTrump Every poll has Trump with historically low approval ratings + and his foreign policies are routinely condemned by the rest of the world. That means consensus is that he's a historic failure both domestically and internationally. How is that not worst of all time?

@CassandraRules I don't understand your point? It was right for the Alabama Senate election, Jones won!
@TheTHale @bigdogup @KirstenPowers You're just posting the same 4 month old story in response to everyone. Trump has strongly endorsed Moore. No way Trump can save face here, he looks B.A.D.
@TheTHale @scott_hays @JAS16AZ @KirstenPowers This story is 4 months old. He flipped and started endorsing Moore, and now he looks like a fool for doing so.
@wsfoodsafety2 @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump C'mon now, just because it's in a meme doesn't make it true.		Trump was accused of sexual assault twice (by Jill Harth and Ivana Trump) before he ever started his 2016 run. You're just plain wrong.
@wsfoodsafety2 @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump 1) Clinton was impeached. Google it. 2) Why does it matter when Trump sexually assaulted those women? He's admitted, on video, to multiple acts of sexual assault and other instances of grossly inappropriate conduct. Does it stop mattering if enough time passed?
@wsfoodsafety2 @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump That's a complete non sequitur. This is about people in power using that power to take advantage of their female employees. You're talking about something completely different.
@wsfoodsafety2 @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump So... you're not tired of people who use their power to get whatever they want from their female employees? Smh. Just plain sad.
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump Fact: Donald Trump is on video admitting to behavior that constitutes sexual assault under the law. 		Now can we converse?
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump It's extremely telling that you have no substantive response to any of this--hint: it's because your position is plainly immoral.
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump People who put politics over basic morality are a stain on America.
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump Not sure what your point is. The law is pretty clear. Why is it so hard to be moral?		Half-baked conspiracy theory about Dems and children-&gt;GOP outrage and guns drawn on a pizza parlor.		Credible evidence of actual GOP child molestation+sex crimes?-&gt;GOP says politics come first
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump Both sides have perverts, but the Dems skewer theirs (B. Clinton impeached, Conyers and Franken forced out). The GOP gives their perverts promotions (Trump, Moore)!!
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump The same can be said for Roy Moore. Too many  R's to count have come out with statements saying "even if the accusations are true and he's a child molester, we need his R vote, so we'll still vote for him!" The GOP has a huge morals problem right now.
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump If there's anything "politically motivated" here it's that people are willing to ignore his admissions of sex crimes because of politics. It's sad that people will put a tax cut over basic decency, will gladly support an admitted sex criminal just to get a few bucks.
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump These aren't politically charged accusations (Trump admitted it, it's not just an accusation) or a SJW definition (it's the law). Trump admitted to committing sex crimes. There's no way around that.
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump What Trump admitted to is legally sexual assault. If you think thats stupid then your issue is with the laws defining SA.		And youre showing a really sad/toxic view of women. Just because a hypothetical woman might do something doesnt mean all women lose the chance to say no. Smh
@AmericanAsIs @POTUS @CoreyBooker 1) This isn't English. Please try again. 2) I find it hilarious that your posts go "Trump didn't sexually assault anyone. Oh wait, he admitted he did?? Dang it... Well... Umm... The Dems!!!!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Thanks for tagging me, I had a long day and needed a laugh.
@AmericanAsIs @POTUS WOW. You really are drinking the Kool Aid. 😂😂😂 "He didn't actually do it, it was just talk. And if he did do it, it wasn't that bad." What he admitted to (unwanted, forced kissing and groping), on video, is sexual assault under the law.
@AmericanAsIs @POTUS @POTUS admitted on video that he sexually assaulted multiple women. How is that a false allegation?
@Steven_In_Exile @slone @realDonaldTrump The proof is the infamous video where Trump admits he sexually assaulted women or multiple occasions? The accusations just establish who some of those women likely were.
@Trumpster4Trump @DarLovesAmerica @President1Trump Well, so far at least 16 women have said they objected, so what's your point?
@medets @PenetratedLobe @Cernovich You nailed it, @PenetratedLobe just made that up (or pulled it from someone who did). It's typical white nationalist garbage.
@lsmith4680 @shaalinar @realDonaldTrump Are you saying that she's not allowed to have and discuss her own political views because she's good at a sport? That's absurd. She's still a citizen and an individual.
@Trumpster4Trump @DarLovesAmerica @President1Trump In the infamous video Trump brags about both groping and kissing women without consent ("I just start kissing them... I don't even wait."). That's sexual assault. Don't sugarcoat and dismiss admissions of sexual assault, especially from a POTUS.
@DarLovesAmerica @President1Trump There's literally a video of Trump bragging about his sexual assaults, which he admitted to and apologized for...
@johncardillo @ResidentOfFL @CNN @realDonaldTrump Uh... What are you talking about?? The bombing is @CNN's lead story. You're just making things up to get mad about 😂😂😂
Roy Moore and his team are truly morons if they thought this was a good idea.		https://t.co/CJx2glrVvd

@bunniemommie @ILperspective @ABC Right, I think NK is waggling because they know POTUS can't do much back. Trump has severely weakened our international position.
@WontShootUrDog @ABC Probably, but not without huge losses.
@Geneoldfort @ABC Lol that's much easier said than done.
@ILperspective @ABC Yup. I think it's because other countries feel POTUS is incredibly weak both domestically and internationally. He can't get anything done at home and is failing at foreign diplomacy so countries like NK aren't going to respect him or the US or what we say.
@charliekirk11 So? That doesn't make Trump's joke any less offensive or any less ignorant.

@whyisthegingone @Frel_ @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser Oh man, I really did hurt his feelings, he blocked me over it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@whyisthegingone @Frel_ @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser Lmao. I see what happened here... You made a lame joke that was SO lame it didn't even make sense... And now you're upset about someone pointing out that it didn't make sense? Is that right? Sorry I hurt your feelings 😂😂😂
@whyisthegingone @VeraEffi @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser You're awfully rude... You posted something incorrect about a major religion, acknowledged that you didn't know if it was right, was corrected in a friendly way, and so you go on the attack? Sad way to live...
@whyisthegingone @Frel_ @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser What you wrote doesn't make sense even with sarcasm? But your attempted save did make me laugh and 1 for 2 isn't bad!!		😂😂😂😂
@VeraEffi @whyisthegingone @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser No. Virgin conception isn't what "immaculate conception" refers to. Christian doctrine is Mary was "immaculately conceived" (ie without sin) so she could birth Jesus through the Virgin Birth. I think you might be mixing up your terms.		https://t.co/Whil4h4gWM
@Frel_ @whyisthegingone @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser I'm not sure what your point is? The phrase "immaculate conception" literally refers to the conception of Mary. I'm not revising anything and I'm certainly not in an argument over it. 		https://t.co/Whil4h4gWM
@whyisthegingone @NicCageMatch @OliviaMesser Not quite. Immaculate conception refers to the conception of Mary.
@ddmau1968 @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump It wasn't? Only lunatics and morons think there was a conspiracy theory there.

@lynn_weiser @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump ISIS didn't grow unchecked it was rapidly shrinking by the time Obama left office. And he put massive sanctions on NK and led multinational efforts against their nuclear problem. Maybe you don't get "the intelligence of his approach" because you don't know what actually happened?
@lynn_weiser @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump Why is that a problem? Trump seems to think all deals are bad, even win-win deal, unless we "win" more than the other side. That's stupid. If you get $5 and I get $7 we're both coming out ahead. But Cuba deal DOES help us more. Better Nat Sec position, huge economic boost.
@lynn_weiser @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump Trump hasn't stopped ISIS, they just perpetrated the largest foreign terror attack on US soil since 9/11... And in Obama's last year they lost 1/3 of their territory and were quickly losing more. Hmmmm... 🤔🤔🤔🤔. Plus significant blows to other terror groups under Obama...
@lynn_weiser @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump 280 chars short to describe a POTUS's entire foreign policy lol, but it was multilateralism (eg Paris agreements, relations with Cuba and Iran, efforts to end our military ops in the Middle East). Basically solving probs through global initistives + flexing US power intelligently
@lynn_weiser @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump That's a) a completely different topic and b) incredibly untrue. Good comment.
@AustinScotch101 @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump I've seen many sources, reviews have been overwhelmingly negative. Watched it myself, thought it was pretty poor (but not so bad compared to his past speeches)

@Bobbyh214 Those aren't really "socialist"? That's why I didn't want to comment on that. France, Spain have "Socialist Parties" but def aren't socialist. Venez is closer but still isn't really socialist. Socialism has been given 1000 different meanings so it's hard to discuss w/examples
@Bobbyh214 Just my 2 cents. Not taking a position on socialism either way, just not sure Venz proves it doesn't work. Maybe Im overthinking a cartoon
@Bobbyh214 Absolutely true that he's not helping. But I don't think you can say 1 bad leader running a country of bad decisions reflects on an ideology
@Bobbyh214 Pegging Bolivar to USD was huge mistake. Country cant buy goods or make money w/o exporting 1st to get USD. Became race to export everything
@Bobbyh214 That country was sunk (economically) whether they were socialist, democratic, republic, anything. Doesn't matter.
@Bobbyh214 Without taking a position on socialism itself (b/c word often misused), Venz's economic problems are severe regardless of political ideology

@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux Read the article yourself, don't just take some liar's word for it, CNN covered it fairly and accurately:		https://t.co/CWOrfuJkW5
@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux Also from CNN art: "The move got Trump some laughs, and a smile from Abe, who actually appeared to dump out his box of food ahead of Trump."
@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux But people like @StefanMolyneux like to make up things and claim CNN is lying when they're reporting objective facts he doesn't like.
@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux The full view video has text that says "Trump follows Abe's lead" in dumping the rest of his food into the pond. It's 100% upfront about it
@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux Okay you said they called him impatient. They didn't. But moving to what they DID say. Their article has both zoomed in and full view videos
@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux Okay... Only thing on there from CNN is 100% accurate. Trump fed fish and poured the entire box in. So where did CNN lie or call impatient?
@The_Dragon_King @StefanMolyneux 1) Then cite that, not something true he falsely calls a lie 2) Where? Not in their story online. Twitter has been lying about what CNN says

@MAD_III @NRA Lmao well you cant fix stupid so I'm wasting my time here... Already enough in the replies for any1 w/ a brain to not fall for your bullshit
@MAD_III @NRA "Oh shoot I've been caught spouting bullshit, better call them a bot!!!!"		Lmao stop trying to politicize tragedies by making up lies.
@MAD_III @NRA You seriously don't get why that matters? You said all of those shooters were left wing. I pointed out 2 (now 3) that plainly weren't.
@MAD_III @NRA No, you literally proved me right. Both examples I used to disprove you are on that list. You're making things up about that group.
@MAD_III @NRA So yeah, what you claimed is STILL bullshit even if you limit it to those shootings
@MAD_III @NRA Yes... Both of the examples I used to disprove you are on that list 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 and another example, Holmes (Aurora) wasn't registered to vote
@StefanMolyneux What is the lie here? He did feed fish. He did empty the entire box into the water. That's all your quoted tweet claims.
@MAD_III Right here		https://t.co/G5B8HeAO9V		Someone said all mass shootings involved AR15, you said "and crazy left wing nut jobs."		Too easy.
@MAD_III @NRA Yep, right here		https://t.co/G5B8HeAO9V		Someone said all mass shootings involved AR15, you said "and crazy left wing nut jobs."		Too easy.
@MAD_III Also lmao at calling me a bot. Can't defend your obvious lies so you dismiss me as a bot + rewrite what you initially claimed. Smooth 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@MAD_III You claimed all shootings involved "crazy left wing nut jobs". That's plainly untrue. You're trying to politicize tragedies. It's gross.
@MAD_III You claimed all shootings involved "crazy left wing nut jobs". That's plainly untrue. You're trying to politicize tragedies. It's gross.
@MAD_III @NRA No... You claimed all shootings involved "crazy left wing nut jobs". You can't weasel out of getting called on bs by making more things up.
@MAD_III Oof. Sounds like you're mad someone is calling out your bullshit.		Stop making up lies to politicize tragedies.
@MAD_III Lmao I'm a bot for calling out your lies? You're trying to politicize tragedy by making up false facts. It's disgusting and sad.
@MAD_III Okay, maybe member was wrong word. NRA supporter. Fan of NRA literature. Still doesn't prove your false claim true that he was liberal.
@MAD_III Um what? Both examples of conservative shooters show I'm wrong in disputing your claim that all shooters are liberal? You're making no sense
@MAD_III Like what? A simple Google search shows that what you're claiming isn't true.
@MAD_III No? Vegas shooter said that he liked Trump's presidency, Lanza was an open conservative NRA member. Both are easily verified.
@MAD_III But even those that do have known political views are all over the map. Eg, Vegas shooter (loosely) supported Trump, Lanza was conservative
@MAD_III Did you just decide they were left wing because you don't like them? Most shooters have had no political affiliation, don't vote, don't care
@TheatreHoBo @SamElmore8 @bakedalaska Okay reading over some of you're other comments you're definitely trolling 😂😂😂😂 I'll admit it, you got me for a little bit 😂😂😂😂
@TheatreHoBo @SamElmore8 @bakedalaska ... I'm going to assume you're trolling because there's no way you don't see the obvious problems with that.
@Alex_Symington @TheatreHoBo @SamElmore8 @bakedalaska But I was just addressing the laughable idea of "only good guys get to buy automatic guns!!"
@Alex_Symington @TheatreHoBo @SamElmore8 @bakedalaska Tbh this time "good guy w/a gun" didn't add harm, prob saved lives, but studies consistently show they typically make situations worse
@BTelevised @TheatreHoBo @SamElmore8 @bakedalaska Then his suggestion makes no sense.
@TheatreHoBo @SamElmore8 @bakedalaska How on Earth would you enforce "only good guys are allowed to buy them"??
@RepGonzalez PLEASE post a retraction, you gave the wrong name of the shooter. Not just sloppy, it's dangerous. Own your mistake, undo harm.
@Sysyfus @RealDrDonna @HarmlessYardDog "Easiest option" isnt always what police should do. Eg, easiest way to deal with anyone with a weapon is to shoot them. Obv not right answer
@RealDrDonna @Sysyfus @HarmlessYardDog You're 100% right. They didn't follow protocol. No defense to say "well I was in danger because I didn't follow protocol so I had to KO"
@RealDrDonna @HarmlessYardDog I think you're absolutely right. The police officers screwed that situation pretty badly then made it a LOT worse by retaliating/escalating.
Anyone else confused at far right media tying Vegas shooter to ISIS AND calling NY attack "deadliest terror attack since 9/11"? Cant be both
@JoeyHar82789769 @Maximus_4EVR @Smokeysmom68 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Steps to delusion: 1) ignore statistics you don't like, 2) make up your own numbers, 3) declare it "easy math." 😂😂😂😂

@Blood362 @Mouwser2 @BrennaSimonSays @charliekirk11 Also, fwiw, right now authorities are saying there's ZERO evidence actually linking him to ISIS. Desperation move by ISIS for attention.
@Blood362 @Mouwser2 @BrennaSimonSays @charliekirk11 Being linked to ISIS is not same as claiming FBI told to stop investigating. FBI made a statement yesterday saying invest was ongoing.
@columbia1969 @S_Vlad101 @wondergirl_M @Lrihendry Id ask for a source but its obv you dont have one because thats a plainly stupid claim. HC had 8.8m total in CA. Claiming ~60% illegal?? 😂😂😂

@whreno Promised a donation to a fallen hero's family then failed to follow through until eviscerated by the media...
@whreno Based on what? He dodged draft, ridiculed POWs for being POWs (McCain), didn't know fallen hero's name, claimed his generals lied to him...
Trump: Peaceful protest disrespects the military.		Also Trump: Can't remember fallen hero's name, claims generals lied to him. 		What a joke

@KimAllen69 @kpk67 @RosannaMaga I'm sorry if I misunderstood you. It's hard to separate individual opinions from the national storyline sometimes. It's all such a mess.
@KimAllen69 @kpk67 @RosannaMaga Haha I'm tempted to jump back in b/c the hacking is a fascinating topic, but I think my boss would like me to do some work today 😁 take care
@KimAllen69 @kpk67 @RosannaMaga Unfortunately we're so divided that it seems like people have to pick one side or the other, can't be moderate + say "both groups are awful"
@KimAllen69 @kpk67 @RosannaMaga Muddied with the narrative that left things are bad too. Being interpreted as defending/making excuses. Thank you for sharing your views.
@KimAllen69 @kpk67 @RosannaMaga Unfortunately I need to hop off Twitter but I've enjoyed the debate 😊 i think the narrative you're sharing (alt right is bad) is getting...
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga He said many were "very good people" and made excuses for their actions. And it's known that he keeps alt right advisors. Not a coincidence.
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Trump's comments, esp Tuesday. If he had come out with a hard line stance unambiguously condemning nation would be much less upset.
@KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga @kpk67 Really? Lots of GOP criticizing Trump for defending alt right... Said many were "very good people"
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Maybe. But that's no excuse to give these extremists any pass on their actions. And at least antifa is anti facism, not pro.
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Trump...?
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Defending them makes the entire right look bad, when it's really fringe extremists.
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Alt right are encouraging violence for political purposes. That's terrorism, plain and simple. We should all be condemning them, bipartisan
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Antifa was right to bring weapons. But for some reason right media is using it to defend alt rights actions. Why are we defending them??...
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga My message may have been lost in the back and forth (my own fault). Antifa is violent too, not saying they aren't. But nobody is saying...
@KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga @kpk67 Vast majority of right (and left!) are good hardworking people who abhor this behavior. But for some reason some GOP are defending alt right
@KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga @kpk67 I'm not blaming all of right, just alt right extremists. They're an extremist group trying to normalize their beliefs, it led to violence
@KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga @kpk67 Yes, but blame is on group for showing up to "peacefully" protest while looking for a fight (eg guns, riot gear, military exercises)
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Not you, @RosannaMaga 		https://t.co/i7K1KcpxJC
@Snoopyraym I 100% agree, i think alt right and Antifa are both properly classified as domestic terrorist groups. Their methods are unacceptable.
@RosannaMaga @kpk67 @KimAllen69 And I disagree with you trying to pin responsibility for the murder on anyone but that alt right terrorist. Agree to disagree I guess.
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga Scalia believed in the right to public demos (eg Snyder v Phelps). Also, he was strongly anti facism. He'd be fine with them protesting https://t.co/oTdmJg4TOq
@KimAllen69 @kpk67 @RosannaMaga Tbh, the issue of gathering in protest/permits/1A is complicated. I strongly suspect we're both oversimplifying.
@KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga @kpk67 😂😂 you can't just say someone isn't allowed to be a part of someone else's rally because you want to divide them based on your own beliefs
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 I literally haven't said white supremacists a single time 😂😂 but white supremacists are a subgroup of white nationalists
@kpk67 @KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga They're still criminals. But I support anti facism more than facism. We fought an entire war over that (WW2)
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 I said alt right, which is what the white nationalists self identify as. It's their term they invented for themselves.
@RosannaMaga @kpk67 @KimAllen69 Both sides had permits. You can't say BLM or Antifa was unpermitted, they were there with the permitted group
@KimAllen69 @RosannaMaga @kpk67 I agree Antifa isn't great either. Their underlying motivation is better than the other two groups but their methods are bad
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 I'm not saying the entire right are terrorists like that a hole. But bringing guns/riot gear/military formations encourages violence
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Like this guy		https://t.co/OCy5kHEVN6
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 The problem is there isn't a good list, just a lot of anecdotal reports. But it's easy to Google and find people showing their wounds
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Also, it's well reported that the white nationalists were using riot gear + military formations. You don't do that unless you want a fight.
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Well, the white nationalist leadership is bragging about some of the attacks... So there's those lol		https://t.co/t0jXw3xcqF
@SmythRadio I'm not trying to critize 😊 I just don't want you to get in an accident
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 I didn't say that. But the majority of reports of violence coming out of Charlottesville were perpetrated by the alt right, incl only murder
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Not that either side should be absolved for it's violence, but context is important
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 And reports sound like the alt right was responsible for far more violence that day, including the only murder
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Alt right is accused of numerous other attacks. You can't just point to the left and ignore the alt right attacks
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Alt right is accused of multiple attacks beyond the terrorism that killed Ms. Heyer. Can't pin it all on the left.
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Not trying to excuse violence on either side, but it's misleading to complain that one side had bats and ignore the other side's weapons
@kpk67 @RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 Don't need a permit to carry a bat, just like alt right legally had guns and riot gear. Both sides were armed, alt right more so.
@RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 @kpk67 Also, it's worth noting that BOTH sides brought weapons. Alt right was very heavily armed. Doesn't excuse violence from either side though.
@RosannaMaga @KimAllen69 @kpk67 Both sides had permits. Both sides accuse the other of not having permits but it's public info both did. #FakeNews		https://t.co/qu2tkmlQ7W

@DaveEpoc @SteveJarrott @MarkDice @CNN Yes, they got it absolutely wrong at first, but (slight) credit where it's due--they realized it was wrong and are trying to fix report.
@DaveEpoc @SteveJarrott @MarkDice @CNN To be fair, the 1st paragraph of the story is correction saying the headline and article have been changed following Comeys prepared remarks
@FizerCindy @InxsyS US lost another 30k manufacturing jobs in April, according to most recent jobs report 😕
@GayConservativ3 There was no way this election wasn't going to be divisive. Sad but true. Two divisive candidates. My horse didn't make it out of primary 😕
@GayConservativ3 Good! Demand truth!
@GayConservativ3 I have to jump offline but it's been nice debating with you. But please give facts/respect another try, maybe a Dem will surprise you 😊
@GayConservativ3 Well, I disagree, but I understand your position.
@GayConservativ3 Not at all. But we can stand up for ourselves and party without stooping to their level. Make good points in a civil manner, that's all
@GayConservativ3 Maybe bad ones do, but I have a lot of Dem friends and we have a lot of reasonable debates. Sometimes I even learn a thing or two lol
@GayConservativ3 I'm saying right now we're BOTH the parties of division and obstruction. I support defending, but not by rolling with them in the mud
@GayConservativ3 Absolutely defend. I just want people to be civil and remember we're all Americans here, if we dont we have no chance of bridging the gap.
@GayConservativ3 Please do call them out. Not just Dems, any #fakenews. But more will listen to "that's wrong. Heres better data, let's discuss" than insults
@GayConservativ3 If we start with insults, 0% chance of productive dialogue. If we try respect, there's a chance. I'd rather be the party that tried
@GayConservativ3 Someone has to stop first. Right now, Dems ridicule right for hyperbole, disrespect, just like right does to Dems. Let's be above reproach
@GayConservativ3 Personally I think thats hyperbole. I believe in the patriotism of all individual Americans until they show otherwise (like R Winners, bleh)
@GayConservativ3 And we didn't confirm theirs lol. Obama faced record obstruction. We lost bipartisanship​ a long time ago 😕 but we can get it back if we try
@GayConservativ3 I criticize a lot of people 😂😂😂😂		And I'm only judging this particular statement, which was counterproductive.
@GayConservativ3 Yup, and they're a black mark on the rest of Dems. But we have our own vocal group doing the same. Makes both parties seem crazy!
@GayConservativ3 I agree 100%. But that can be done while treating other side w/respect, and they'll be a lot more open to listening to our good arguments!
@GayConservativ3 I agree. But we can set narrative through facts and respect, be bigger party. Right now rhetoric from leadership is divisive, hyperbole
@GayConservativ3 In fairness, GOP controls Congress and POTUS and we're nowhere near bipartisan. We need GOP leadership to mend or nothing will get done
@GayConservativ3 Sorry, bit of a rant there lol
@GayConservativ3 We can't be the greatest country in the world if we're fighting ourselves. It takes all of us.
@GayConservativ3 It's easy to get caught up in emotions, esp on Twitter. But at the end of the day, Dems aren't just people, they're fellow Americans
@GayConservativ3 Its not true. Most Dems (like GOP) are good people. Dehumanizing only further the divide. Country needs bipartisan progress, this hurts that
@belandibelan @Pamela_Moore13 That's probably nothing, but, again, I don't know how deep to read into it. Lots of potential for this to get jucier, or nothing to see
@belandibelan @Pamela_Moore13 True. I dont know how deep to read into some of it. Hes specific that counterintel inv is not same as criminal and Trump isnt under *CI* inv
@belandibelan @Pamela_Moore13 Sounds like counter intel investig doesnt always mean subject acted badly, could be target. But wld sound bad to say hes now being investig
@belandibelan @Pamela_Moore13 He said several existed, but main reason is that if they said it publicly, then later opened one, they'd have a duty to announce the change
.@EricTrump: Dems "not even people."		This is the sort of divisive BS that helps nobody, hurts the whole country		https://t.co/SacLC7MyIp
@trend_auditor @SandraTXAS Lost 30k manufacturing jobs, gained 118k food service jobs 😕😕
@trend_auditor @SandraTXAS I thought the job numbers were bad? We're​ hemorrhaging manuf jobs and gaining low wage food service jobs, +growth fell short of projections

@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Have a good day! Nice chatting with you. (And I hope all is well re dialysis. Eek!)
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I sit at work and listen to lib co-workers ridicule right for obvious lies, strengthens their base. It needs to stop! It hurts our cause.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Sad that people would rather lie and create false narratives than put good of country first. It's unamerican and shameful
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Being civil? Doc attacked me first, I started nice. Being better? I am! I'm insisting on truth and integrity! Patriots put #CountryOverParty
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Both parties accuse the other of dishonesty. It's giving left low hanging fruit when we tell obvious lies. Harms the party and country.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 If someone wants to insult me just because I want the truth, I'm happy to be insulted. I won't let other's insults push me away from truth
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I'm not playing victim, personal attacks brush right off. I'm angry at fake conservatives making our whole party look like morons.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I'm trying to be civil, present facts. But I'm being attacked by people for it. Why???? Conservatives are supposed to be better than that
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Worse, she and others are attacking me, assuming I'm lib, because I wanted truth. How does that make our party look?? Right cant want truth?
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Only data point I have on Doc is she's knowingly spreading a lie and doesn't care, putting politics over truth. How should I interpret that?
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Saddest thing about this is watching my own party attack and assume some1 is lib because they demanded truth. How does that make us look???
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Even if that's true (I think it's hyperbole) that's no excuse for us to abandon our own integrity! Most of us are better than that.
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 But apparently this got me blocked. I guess @camaro19don70 doesn't care about integrity either 😂😂😂😂😂
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Here you go @camaro19don70. Quote is at 6:17, Prince himself says he doesn't vote (it's against his religion).		https://t.co/X72Jvo5J0r
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Ignoring truth is exactly what the libs attack the right over. They tell their base the right just lies. We can't give them more ammo.
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I'm angry not because I want to attack her beliefs, but because disregard for the truth makes our entire party look bad.
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 One of her fans linked a quote from Prince directly refuting what she claims he said. Why do you defend her continuing to spread the lie?
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 If you don't support lying in return why are you defending her spewing lies even after her own supporter told her it was false?

@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Yes, @peddoc63 has shown she likes the lies that make her feel better. Sad but true. All I said was to be truthful, she objected. Sad.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 It didn't start as an attack, trying to be nice, promote truth. Only became attack when she said she didn't care about truth. Not partisan.

@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Blindly following others like sheep just because the label themselves a certain way is how corruption and extremists take control.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 The more I think about this the more it upsets me. Conservatives (and libs) MUST challenge each other to preserve integrity of party.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 (Plus, SHE assumed I was liberal bc I wanted truth. I didnt make any generalization. But I think most people like truth regardless of party)
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 That's a horrible view. Conservatives shouldn't challenge bad Conservatives? No thanks, I'm a patriot first and foremost. #CountryOverParty
@TapTheGadfly @peddoc63 Really sad that this is what politics has devolved to. No hope of bipartisan progress w/o truthful, open dialogue.
@TapTheGadfly @peddoc63 Right 😂😂😂😂😂 she *believes* it's true and that's all that matters. Never mind that Prince himself said otherwise.
@camaro19don70 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 So you support lying to people in return? Why sink when you can rise?
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 This isn't a partisan issue. It's integrity, simple as that.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 And again, I haven't said left or right. All I've said is truth over lies. Why is that controversial? Why attack me for disliking lying?
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Wipe the floor? She just keeps pointing to a meme as fact. No real source, ignored quote from Prince himself. Cmon now, that's just silly
@peddoc63 What evidence? That I said something you dont like?Youre literally defending lying to people. Stuff like this makes our whole party look bad
@shalomel22733 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I'm really not trying to troll. It's a fake quote making its way around internet. Thought it was helpful, but OP doesn't care about truth
@shalomel22733 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Um... What? My initial response was literally that quote in the original tweet isn't true. How does that not apply to original tweet?
@peddoc63 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂		A doctor who trusts memes over quotes from the actual source. Wow.
@Deplorable58 @kfrketic61 @peddoc63 Agree on assumptions. Not sure why agree assumed I'm liberal just because I like truth! Seems like compliment to libs lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@donald_aper Why so defensive here? All I've questioned is @peddoc63 using lies to manipulate others opinions. Why do you defend that?
@donald_aper Scalia was an ardent supporter of truth. I've taken no political position here, only pointing out something was false. So whats the problem?
@peddoc63 But I'm open to any non-meme source you can provide. Of course, I think we both know you know it doesn't exist.
@peddoc63 Don't doctors look at available evidence to make decisions? You have a good source (Prince himself) contradicting. In favor? Just a meme 😂😂😂
@peddoc63 One of your followers posted an article quoting Prince saying he never voted. Solid evidence your quote about who he voted for is fake

@peddoc63 Okay. Up to you. But fact is its now clear you're spreading a lie that you KNOW is a lie, and you don't care because of politics. Shameful.
@kfrketic61 @peddoc63 But feels like she'd rather attack me than use truth. Too much fake news today, not enough integrity. Wrong to manipulate opinion w/ lies

@kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I'm unfamiliar with @peddoc63 but apparently she is not a fan of me, assumes my beliefs. I just tried to help, assumed it was an accident.
@kfrketic61 @peddoc63 I completely agree. If you have to stoop to lies to defend a position, it's not a defensible position. #TruthOverAll #CountryOverParty

@peddoc63 If you're comfortable spreading misinformation, that's your own right. But I was trying to be helpful in case you weren't aware it's a lie
@peddoc63 Here who comes? I'm not promoting either party, I'm just opposed to falsehoods pushed as fact for political gain. Too common these days.
@peddoc63 His political leanings were complex. But he supported BLM and openly criticized both parties.
@peddoc63 The quote about voting GOP is #FakeNews. It was invented by internet trolls. Prince never voted, he considered it against his religion.

How do you assign valuation to policies? To harm over time and lingering effects?
@Hollymac87 @katt9454 @Geoclewis @lizvlx @StefanMolyneux @Cernovich Okay. They still hold extreme views and they've still committed violence. But that's sort of irrelevant here, point is they don't represent

@Donwhitmore One man doesn't represent an entire culture. That's ignorant.
@Donwhitmore @HLRowe1 *Didn't read one specific book, so is a racist*		Yeah okay.
@Donwhitmore @HLRowe1 Yeah, this shit is what I'm talking about. Smh.
@Donwhitmore @HLRowe1 My original complaint was about the effects of oppression. Are you really this dense?
@Donwhitmore @HLRowe1 Trolling, glad you finally admitted it.
@Donwhitmore I have no interest in listening to a bigot justify his bigotry. Your skin color is irrelevant. Stop hiding behind it.
@Donwhitmore I quoted what I said several times. Never said u didn't say it. Stop being a fool.
@Donwhitmore That's incredibly ignorant.
@Donwhitmore No, I spent my day arguing with an ignorant bigot who claims they should be allowed to be a bigot because of the color of his skin
@Donwhitmore Who was the native woman I railed against? Where did I do that?
@Donwhitmore Not at all. I don't want recognition, I want you to stop spreading ignorance through your vitriol.
@HLRowe1 @Donwhitmore I'm always happy to talk and learn but I draw a hard line at bigotry. Just bc hes a PoC doesnt mean he can spread hate through his prejudice
@HLRowe1 @Donwhitmore Tried to clear up misunderstanding, called racist again. Asked why it was racist, apparently that's racist too lol
@HLRowe1 @Donwhitmore Said "[W]e have very limited information about many [of the 500+ NA] tribes. It's a shame..." So Don repeatedly called me racist.

Most are very nice and not this ignorant
@Donwhitmore You still haven't given any reason I'm wrong other than "I'm a PoC, you're not, therefore you don't know" 😂😂😂😂😂 #bigot
@Donwhitmore NA scholars are lamenting to loss of knowledge about some tribes. You assume you know more than experts because your skin color? Smh.
@Donwhitmore For some tribes we know virtually nothing beyond the fact they existed as a unique culture. In those cases we've lost nearly all knowledge
@Donwhitmore Wow. This is... Dumb. Okay. So at some point people knew about the culture and language. Now we don't. By definition some was lost.
@Donwhitmore I literally copied and pasted what I said 😂😂😂😂😂😂 how is that not what I said?😂😂😂😂😂😂

@Donwhitmore There's nothing muddy about it 😂😂😂😂😂 one thread you're talking about how smart you are, in the other you can't read 😂😂😂. Amazing.
@Donwhitmore Yes, of the 500+ tribes that used to exist, we've lost a lot of knowledge about many of them. Why is that so hard for you to grasp?

@Donwhitmore You started by quoting me, saying there was a reason why my tweets true, then called me a racist for saying it and flip flopped to not true😂
@Donwhitmore We know certain NA languages used to exist. Nobody knows them anymore. (Prob lost related oral history at same time too) Pretty simple...
@Donwhitmore No, saying some things were lost is shown by noting specific things that were lost. I did. You ignored it. Smh.
@Donwhitmore I didn't say your knowledge is gone (implying all). I said some was lost and pointed to a specific language that is lost due to oppression
@Donwhitmore @HLRowe1 If that's true, she just needs to say it and I'm gone. But our DM chat has been really pleasant and I don't think you should speak for her
@Donwhitmore I gave a specific example that proves my point, keep mentioning it, and you keep ignoring it over and over acting like I haven't 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@Donwhitmore Honestly only reason I engaged u this long is bc @HLRowe1 called you to the convo. Gave benefit of doubt bc assumed better from her friends
@Donwhitmore ... awareness of my own limitations, and a genuine interest in learning and improving things. All you've done is spew hate and bigotry.
@Donwhitmore Being a PoC doesn't insulate you from being a bigot or an asshole like you seem to think it does. I tried to approached this w/kindness...
@Donwhitmore Paging @HLRowe1.... Are all of your friends this hateful and ignorant? Smh.
@Donwhitmore This is funnier more I read it 😂😂😂 this started with me noting the effects of oppression of NAs. But thats doesnt fit your bigoted narrative
@Donwhitmore You gave me time? 1) how entitled to think I need your permission for anything, 2) time to read a novel in the last 20 min? Wtf do you mean?
@Donwhitmore I gave evidence supporting my claim, specific example even. You just changed the subject 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@Donwhitmore I gave specific knowledge I claim was lost. Your only response was "no it's secret knowledge because you're racist."
@Donwhitmore Uh, I pointed out a specific language that was lost, and there are many more. You just ignored that by shouting racism 😂😂😂😂 but yeah sure
@Donwhitmore Again, you assume about me. But don't call me racist because of someone else's syllabus. That's ignorant.
@Donwhitmore I didn't say I can't be bothered? You assume again. I just havent yet. Lots to read and absorb, and not just about this topic. Limited hours
@Donwhitmore People like you hurt the fight to stop racism and bigotry. Instead of knowledge all you share is hate and assumptions about others. Fuck off
@Donwhitmore No, you're being a bigot and I'm not going to give you a pass on it just because you're a PoC and claim every non PoC is racist
@Donwhitmore Either use facts to show something is wrong or shut up. But crying racism to rebut facts doesn't make them not true.
@Donwhitmore That's not incorrect. I've given examples of lost knowledge. All you've said is "nuh uh we have it it's just a secret". Bullshit.
@Donwhitmore Articles but not novels. And Coates isn't even NA but I was going to let that go 😂😂😂😂. What, am I supposed to read every work by every PoC?
@Donwhitmore You're calling me racist. How is that not an attack?
@Donwhitmore I didnt pretend to understand anything. Ive said several times it's not my culture. But I do know that academics lament the same thing I did
@Donwhitmore How am I to assume you're using a specialized definition, not the prevailing definition?
@Donwhitmore You keep assuming things about me. You assume I've done wrong because of what you assume about me. That's just bigoted.
@Donwhitmore No, I've read others too. I just listed more recent reads (or, for Ellison, someone I consider an esp incredible writer)
@Donwhitmore Thats the dumbest thing you've said yet. People who actually care about NA culture want to preserve it, not hide it until forgotten by world
@Donwhitmore I dont deserve to be attacked for doing the best I can. You're saying I'm racist for things outside my control. You don't know shit about me
@Donwhitmore That's on the NA side. For PoC generally I'm a big fan of Ellison (Invisible Man)
@Donwhitmore Sherman Alexei, Janet Campbell Hale, and Momaday are what's jumping to mind. I'd have to look to see who else.
@Donwhitmore You said nothing was lost, just ignored. If not lost, where is that knowledge? The other *lost* NA languages? Lost stories?
@Donwhitmore @HLRowe1 this guy could not have been a bigger fail. What were you thinking???
@Donwhitmore So... You still know Apalachee language? You should let Smithsonian know... Because nobody else does.
@Donwhitmore Educate yourself. Many NA languages are dying out because of a lack of native speakers. Theres a huge effort to try and preserve what's left
@Donwhitmore I lamented a problem caused by institutional​ racism. That's all I did. So you call me racist for it?
@Donwhitmore I didn't ask you for anything. You attacked me for lamenting a well reported complaint among NA scholars. Youre hurting your own cause.
@Donwhitmore I've tried to be an ally. Your bigotry leads you to assume I haven't because you assume I'm not a PoC
@Donwhitmore No, yes, no. But I've taken classes, visited museums/reservs with NA friends, tried to be ally. But your bigotry is making you assume hate
@Donwhitmore Just because you're a PoC doesn't mean you get to assume things about me or attack me based on your own bigotry. It's still bigotry.
@Donwhitmore Uh, I tried to draw attention to the fact that we've lost a lot of NA knowledge. Which is true and is a real issue. You distracted from that
@Donwhitmore Is it correct to assume every modern German is antisemitic because their country had previously antisemitic practices? Surely not.
@Donwhitmore You assume things about me. You don't know about me. You started by assuming bad in others even when they agree with you. Ignorant.
@Donwhitmore And now you assume I'm white. Seems... Sort of racist? And you assume I like the systems too? Plain ignorant.
@Donwhitmore Okay. So you've already admitted I said nothing racist, you're just assuming that about me because you've assumed my background. Nice.
@Donwhitmore But hey, if agreeing with NA scholars who say "this is a problem", and wishing it was reversed is racist, I guess I'm racist for agreeing?
@Donwhitmore Didnt say it was gone, said some knowledge about some groups was lost. Thats a huge concern among many NA scholars so I dunno what youre on
@Donwhitmore Yes, it is wrong to assume that everyone in the majority (or system) is racist. You're being ignorant.
@Donwhitmore It's flat out ignorant to think people can't try to better themselves or look for knowledge outside of their bubble.
@Donwhitmore Just because it's systemic doesn't mean people can't be educated or learn other things or try to be part of solution. You assume I haven't.
@Donwhitmore .@HLRowe1 where did you find this piece of shit?
@Donwhitmore So you're assuming I'm racist by default. Got it. You're assuming things about me. Gtfo
@Donwhitmore Please tell me what I said that was racist? A quote would be great.
@Donwhitmore What can I do other than try to educate myself? You're calling me racist for admitting my own ignorance and wanting knowledge. What a joke.
@Donwhitmore Again, I haven't said anything racist. You're assuming that about me.
@Donwhitmore But I am suggesting that assuming I'm racist just because I'm not NA is not appropriate. In fact... It's racist?
@Donwhitmore I'm not being an aggressor. I'm lamenting the loss of knowledge about other cultures. That's sort of the opposite of racist.
@Donwhitmore Im saying the most effective way to end racism doesnt involve assuming people are racist+attacking them over it. I didnt say anything racist
@Donwhitmore Ceremonies and dances. It's not my culture and I don't claim to know it all. But do not assume things about me. That's being an asshole.
@Donwhitmore Also, again, you're making assumptions about me. FWIW I've tried to learn. I've visited reservations, listened to stories, witnessed...
@Donwhitmore All you've done is been a titanic asshole about it. So either give a fact or shut up, but raging over being told you're wrong is immature.
@Donwhitmore Fine, let me be more direct and not sugar coat it. You're 100% wrong and have given no facts to show you're right.
@Donwhitmore You're being an asshole over literally nothing. You made false assumptions and attacked.
@Donwhitmore I'm not begging for help, I'm saying there are more productive ways to do this than assume the worst about anyone who isn't you
@Donwhitmore You're attacking me based on your own assumptions. Literally all I said was knowledge was lost. You're crazy if you think that isn't true.
@Donwhitmore I'm not choosing to be ignorant? Ive gone out of my way to learn more about NAs. It's not my culture but I don't discount it
@Donwhitmore If it were up to me we'd still have all of that information. You're assuming bad intent from me when none existed.
@Donwhitmore I didn't get into that at all. I was on your side until now. I was lamenting loss of cultural knowledge about certain tribes, not attacking
@Donwhitmore Are you saying every tribe had equal info survive to present day? Are there not tribes we know less about than others? That's just stupid.
@Donwhitmore And even if it was false you could provide a fact and help educate, not launch into insults against someone who agreed with you up until now
@Donwhitmore I haven't tried to make any point other than we have different amounts of info about different tribes. That's it. You need to relax.

Amazing lol.
Wow! Trump is really doubling down on this?? There was nothing ambiguous about the original statement, but Trump omitted the context! https://t.co/GgJctSRvcM
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek It took me less than a minute, if that matters to your argument.
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Uh, don't know who told you that but it's false. Eg:		https://t.co/fJ5eI4En9K		https://t.co/JlOufFV5hJ		https://t.co/MKqPMPgR3H
@3percent4life @realDonaldTrump Lol it was rhetorical. This is classic authoritarian strategy--paint everyone else as enemy, yourself as only good guy.
@realDonaldTrump Why do your tweets always read like you're trying to turn the public against the courts? And media? And legislative? Anyone who isn't you?
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 I'm definitely not arguing for only specialists, we need both. But system shouldn't discourage specialization or make us all generalists
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 It's been lovely chatting with you but I need to log off for the night. Gave me lots to think about. Hope to talk to you again.
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 The difference is that tech has evolved too far. Something as ubiquitous as cell phone requires THOUSANDS of specialists, not small artisans
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 We don't want to make specializing a bad idea or a naturally poor lifestyle for most of their lives. It woukd stall progress.
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 Eg what would an antenna expert do for first 40y of life? Sell antennas with low market $ while they learn? Why would any1 want to do that?
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 Hard to have that extra time 4 people to study and learn if they need to worry about how to deal with the free market. That's its own skill
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 I get what you're saying. But things we take for granted, like cell phone or Twitter, are built on thousands of lifetimes of study.
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ... but you still need to spend time/resources producing something of value to trade instead of devoting the time/resources to specializing
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ... take time to learn. Takes away from ability to specialize. Yes, could try to get goods from others collecting own food, water...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ...@AnneMoose1 says this can be solved by every1 doing everything themselves, collect own water, make own power, etc. But those skills...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ... even if a second competitor wanted to push through and build, not really profitable to invest heavily knowing a price war is coming...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ... so the cost of infrastructure bankrupts competition before they establish in market. Infrastructure is natural barrier to entry...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 Say there is no regulation. Water company can charge as much as they want--every1 needs water. If competition comes in, can drop prices...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 It was an admittedly weak explanation. I'm not discounting people who can provide for themselves. But think of this hypothetical:
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 Sorry that was long and probably not a great explanation. It's trying to condense a lot into 140 chars.
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ...But under the crazy fixes @AnneMoose1 has proposed specialization is undermined.
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ... complete deregulation works. But just suggests ideas with tons of added waste. So it's not "forced" in true deregulation...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ... this is all a big result of @AnneMoose1 refusing to acknowledge natural barriers to entry in markets and trying to explain why...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 ...People to actually do those things, which means they don't have time to devote to specializing and lifelong study of 1 thing...
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 .@AnneMoose1 says natural monopolies don't exist b/c people can grow own food, get own water, build own things, etc. But that requires...
@EverybodyNThDog He still is lol. But we need SOME specialists, which means people who don't grow own food, collect own water, build own basic tools, etc.
@EverybodyNThDog Oh I 100% agree. But @AnneMoose1 is advocating a system where EVERYONE is forced to be generalists, and that's just silly.
@PhillyGlobe @BolindoMiss1975 Based on easily found and evaluated evidence that didn't give reasonable suspicion of crime or threat. No need to investigate further
@EverybodyNThDog Ben Franklin couldnt have dreamed of a cell phone, the Internet, etc. Tech has advanced too far. Takes a lifetime to learn 1 field now
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic So... Still waiting. You said antennas were solved? Just use Yagis for everything? Or... Maybe its more complex than you've admitted? Hmm...
@PhillyGlobe @BolindoMiss1975 Yes thats evidence of a threat, so they investigate. Reasonable. Not reasonable to think KG intends physical harm or pic is evidence of that
@EverybodyNThDog @AnneMoose1 @davidtilburyfl @alllibertynews @nwnc5th @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Lol I know it's an obvious troll but it's still fun. Simply mind-blowing someone could be so out of touch though
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic We're talking about NATURAL barriers to entry for markets. If you don't understand the distinction you shouldn't be arguing they don't exist
@PhillyGlobe @BolindoMiss1975 Thats not good enough to justify it. I could say the same about anyone. How do I know there isn't more about you unless I investigate?
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic You can be a true specialist in a very narrow field, but not enough hours in a lifetime to be better than expert in all fields.
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Circuit boards? Lets assume you know how to acid etch. Can you design a video card? Processor? A motherboard? Better than what's on market?
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic It's okay you don't. But these are complex fields people devote their lives to. But you're WAY underestimating things.
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Or your cell phone? Can't use Yagi there. Do you know how to design a dish if you need one? Know how to design the circuits you'll etch?
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Fine we'll talk antennas, since its "solved." Yagi can't do radar (not high enough gain). Or you want a single antenna for multi signals?
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Also, the name calling is unnecessary. I'm sorry your feelings are hurt but I haven't called you names.
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic That... Doesn't say anything about barriers to entry in free markets. What on Earth are you talking about? 😂😂😂😂
@BolindoMiss1975 @PhillyGlobe That's good 😊 (and to be clear I'm not saying you should be investigated, just that we need more than a pic we don't like to investigate)
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic You're getting upset because I said you weren't an expert in everything. You cant be perfect at everything lol. Damn trophy culture at work
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Some fields require a lifetime to study before one can contribute to the advancement of the field. Nobody can specialize in everything
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Which is very little education in the things I mentioned--antenna design and circuit boards. Not an insult, just not your specialty.
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Article says literally nothing about barriers to entry + whether they exist or not. Also, are ALL of your sources this goofy Austrian blog?
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Are you saying you know more about econ than economists? Maybe people who dedicate to1 field know more about that field? Yay specialization!
@AnneMoose1 @tombstone19391 @HLRowe1 @melmcq1 @josh__gesell @alllibertynews @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic That's subjective though. You can't base someone's livelihood and ability to eat on your subjective tests. That's lunacy.
@PhillyGlobe SS has no reason to investigate unless crime or actual threat of harm is suspected. Where is the crime or actual threat of harm?
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Growing food isn't as simple as you say. Many have no idea how. Advanced societies specialize for efficiency, not all do same basic tasks
@BolindoMiss1975 @PhillyGlobe Eh. Not really. But she definitely didn't give any hint of a crime or actual threat of harm at the press conference.
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Where?
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Okay. Hard to defend an economic position when you refuse to believe in something universally accepted by economists lol.
@BolindoMiss1975 @PhillyGlobe You could say that about anyone. I don't know you and assume you're no threat, but do I wait and risk you going off? Or investigate?
@AnneMoose1 @tombstone19391 @HLRowe1 @melmcq1 @josh__gesell @alllibertynews @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic That doesnt answer the ? at all. Evaluating symptoms is subjective, and symptoms have many causes. How do you test that its drug withdrawal?
@PhillyGlobe Yes because Trump has no say here. And SS isn't investigating crime, just "investigating". That makes total sense 😂😂
@PhillyGlobe So the secret service investigation is civil? Or... Would they be investigating a potential crime? What are they investigating if not crime?
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic You may have skills to get lot of things done. But society needs people who devote lives to specific tasks. Every1 can't be generalists
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic I insulted you by saying you likely don't have extremely specialized skills that take years and years of education? Wow. #Snowflake lol
@walt1999walt Any time! But don't get me wrong, awful for her to do (imo).
@louie4me Oh my goodness yes 😵
@PhillyGlobe Uh, yeah... Yours. It says it's being investigated lol 😂😂😂
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic Ah. Name calling. You're advocating for a very wasteful system that undermines specialization. Use reason to defend, not childish insults.
@AnneMoose1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic But why require everyone to have one when its much faster/easier/cheaper to use current system? It's pointless waste. No gain, more expense.
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic You're completely ignoring natural barriers to entry to markets...
@AnneMoose1 @HLRowe1 @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @josh__gesell @silentboomer @melmcq1 @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic You're completely ignoring natural barriers to entry to markets. You can't just declare that they don't exist.
@walt1999walt Not question of are people incited, but was her *intent to incite* real physical violence? I don't think any1 really believes she did.
@BolindoMiss1975 @PhillyGlobe Su Ct has ruled it's protected unless "present intent" to cause harm. Does any reasonable person believe she actually intends physical harm?
@AnneMoose1 @tombstone19391 @HLRowe1 @melmcq1 @josh__gesell @alllibertynews @raiderman108 @maiabdulrahman @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @davidtilburyfl @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic How do you "test" for that?
@walt1999walt @TheDemocrats Supreme Court has ruled threats against POTUS need present intent to harm to be unlawful. No1 thinks Griffin is actually intending to behead
@wanttruth Arrest and jail for what crime? Its sick but it was clearly free speech. Constitution protects free speech for all Americans, even dumb ones
@JackPosobiec @clowndogs13 @MayorBowser That... Would still be pretty graphic? Giving first aid to a dying man isn't exactly PG.
@PhillyGlobe The photo wasn't appropriate but POTUS is also overreacting. Criminal investigation!? What happened to 1A? Does he not respect Constitution?
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Cmon now Im trying to be nice and apologize, it was an honest mistake. I actually feel bad about giving you such a hard time now. Sorry!
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC But I'm not trying to pick on a kid. It's wrong to lie, but you'll learn that in time. Enjoy your summer break!
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Your point was that its okay 2 lie if it actually fools people 😂😂😂 even being a lil kid doesnt justify that idea. Just means you need 2 grow
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC (Also, its not good look 2 use the word "retard" as an insult, looks immature. It's what clued me to your age. Youll seem older if you dont)
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC And Cartoon Network Punch Time Explosion. Never heard of it but it sounds fun! I'll ask my cousins if they've played!
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I actually owe an apology. I didnt realize youre a kid until I saw your profile just now. My bad, you'll learn w/time. GL w/ Lego Star Wars
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Wait I might understand​ "if". You say its okay to lie b/c it *does* convince them to agree with you? Better? (I think thats even worse! 😂😂)
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC 1) I have no idea what your complaint with "if" is in there. Literally zero. 2) you're trying REALLY hard to justify lying. Why?
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Are you talking about the Mogadishu attacks? They were covered by CNN, BBC, Independent, etc. What do you mean it wasn't covered by left?
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC If the media is using falsehoods to manipulate people that's wrong no matter what topic. It doesnt justify doing it yourself. #TruthOverLies
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I just don't agree with the mindset "it's okay to lie to people if it convinces them to agree with you." Doesn't matter what the lie is.
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC False is false. You're defending using false info to manipulate people. Whether you think that's okay is up to you, but I think it's immoral
@ReeReeC2 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC It's still relevant and a horrible crime, but using it as attack on lib media (who did cover it) is simply #fakenews. People need truth.
@ReeReeC2 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC No, I'm trying to say that it's plainly false to say "Deafening SILENCE from Libs!" It was well covered 9y ago. OP is trying to trick people
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Right. Blame someone else to justify using false info to manipulate others opinions. False is false. If youre right give true facts+convince
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I didn't paint Islam as anything, I'm not sure where you got that.
@knobcreek4ever @Elric66 @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC My complaint isn't sharing the story (I love sharing info!), it's that it was spun to say that it was being ignored by media. Simply untrue.
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Okay, agree to disagree, but I think that's very immoral. People should base their opinions on the truth, not on false info, simple as that
@Elric66 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC It doesn't matter what the topic is, I'm opposed to intentionally misleading people or using false info to manipulate their opinions.
@Elric66 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I strongly disagree w/that mindset. R u saying u dont care if people r being fed/believing false info so long as it furthers your position?
@ACTNOW2015 @EverybodyNThDog @Galt_in_Da_Box @RickyBobby_USA @alllibertynews @nicholaswolfson @HLRowe1 @josh__gesell @100million5 @annenortonnow @NoLeftTurn2 @raiderman108 @davidtilburyfl @LivePatriot @maiabdulrahman @LMPSEBRING @marymuldoon558 @Revive71 @melmcq1 @AnneMoose1 @MuncTomm @AboutOurVote @Donaldtfoster @geinar_geinar @suejonessays @the_grid_runner @sagemoser @TheLibRepublic I do. It's like family--I still love them even when they stumble, and I'll be there to help them back on their feet and grow to be better
@Maga_Mike_ @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek You have 100% right to your opinion+I dont know your country. But Im in US so Muslims are protected by our Const. Our laws say not our enemy
US withdraws from Paris Climate deal yesterday, and now it's incredibly hot outside today. Coincidence??		... Probably.
@Elric66 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Lol someone had to! 😂😂😂		We have to fight #fakenews, regardless of who it's from. Too many people put politics over truth/accuracy.
@Elric66 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC It's pretty easy to Google it and find a ton of coverage of the attack, the trial/sentencing, and even Elorch's next arrest...
@PartyCabSC @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Makes sense thatd be more spirited debate, both sides vocal + have good arguments. Nobody rational is defending these a-holes, so no debate
@Elric66 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I have no problem with re-reporting it. But it's dishonest to accuse a group of ignoring it when they didn't, they covered when it happened
https://t.co/5RFDK2uU8d
@PartyCabSC @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Yes it was thoroughly covered at the time. Just do a Google search, there is a ton of coverage. Was arrested + convicted (+ arrested again)
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC My only concern is the falsehood that it's a recent attack that isn't being covered. It's true that the attack did happen and it was awful
@LaneRic185 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Again, this isn't on your retweet. You jumped into comments in the original tweet to reply to me to defend the OP's lie. Have a good day.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC At the end of the day I cant stop you from spreading lies. Very sad you're so committed to it. All I asked for was truth. I'll pray for you.
@LaneRic185 @knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC If you're accusing someone of wrongdoing for not covering it today, yes it matters a lot. It was the whole point of the original tweet!! Smh
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Wow. Bible verses to defend against lying to others. Smh at "Xtians" picking and choosing when it suits them. World is in very sad state
@knobcreek4ever @LaneRic185 @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Right! All I'm saying is give people truth. Don't mislead people. Why is that so controversial lately? It's a real shame.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Uh, you started this thread by going after me and defending the lie. I never posted on your retweet. Stop. Trying. To. Mislead. People.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Well, literally all I know about you is you intentionally spread false info then defended lying because others do... Hmmmm
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Liberals lie so it's okay if you do??? Smh.
@knobcreek4ever @LaneRic185 @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I would fully support that tweet! It's sharing true facts so people can think for themselves!
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Thats not the lie. Its the claim that liberals have been silent on it. A simple Google search shows that's a lie. It was thoroughly covered
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC You're sharing something you know is false as a fact so that others see it and believe it. Yes, that makes you a liar.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Then retweet it truthfully. Don't lie. That's literally all I've said. Tell the truth. Why are you so intent to defend liars?
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC So that justifies lying about this? Smh. Simply immoral.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC I'm not protecting anybody. I believe people should have the truth and think for themselves. Why are you so interested in lying to people??
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC There's no reason for media to cover this specific story again today. Yet OP is accusing them of wrongdoing for not covering, omits date
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC "Deafening SILENCE from Libs!" is honest even though media covered it throughly and no reason for them to bring it up again now 9y later?
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Like OP alleged here? That the Libs are intentionally ignoring it? The truth is the news covered this pretty thoroughly
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Sure. Make them aware of it. But tell the truth. That's all I'm saying. Don't lie. I don't know why you're so resistant to being honest.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC If youre retweeting true facts I don't care. But youre getting defensive because I want it to be truthful/accurate. Why not just tell truth?
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Again, a shame a totally different attack happened. Doesn't justify lying to people about what happened in this one. Lies are lies.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC "Facts are facts"		*Entirely ignores the fake facts because they fit his narrative*		😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC So that makes it okay to use misinformation and mislead people? Give people accurate facts and let them think for themselves, don't lie
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Its a shame a totally different attack occurred. Doesnt change that the original tweet is trying to mislead people, which is all Ive said
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC More specifically, why are they wrong for not covering a 9y old event like its current news?
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC It absolutely matters if you're calling out a group for not covering it today. It was covered 9y ago. Why would Libs cover it again now?
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC If you retweeted her comments, yes that's misleading. Post implies Libs should report on it now, but are ignoring it. Lies. Covered 9y ago
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek I didn't say anything about any other event. Only that what the poster said about this attack is blatantly false and misleading.
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Okay but this isn't the truth, it's a blatant lie. Libs weren't silent about it. It was appropriately covered when it happened.
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek You think the LGBTQ community barely talked about Pulse? Really? What rock were you under?
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC If you want to bring attention to the story I have no complaints. If you want to mislead people to think press is ignoring it, thats a lie
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek 1) totally different crime than video above, 2) article doesn't indicate they're Muslim or that was a motivator. So what's your point?
@LaneRic185 @plcarlo @knobcreek4ever @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC It absolutely matters when it happened if the post is "Deafening SILENCE from Libs". It's plainly intended to mislead people.
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek Thatd be awesome. But sometimes anon sources can be factually correct. Wrong to dismiss outright just because they need to stay anon for now
@sherrylou916 @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek No, they did, but the attack happened almost a decade ago. It's being presented as a recent story that media wont cover (they did, 9y ago😂😂)

@knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Yup. Arrested, convicted, judge ignored pleas for mercy, and already served time. I think one was picked up again in terrorism investigation
@knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC ... I think Elorch was arrested again for gun charges, found through an FBI terrorism investigation
@knobcreek4ever @plcarlo @AmyMek @ColleenMoreno15 @CNN @MSNBC Any time! Always happy to share facts so people can make informed optinions. Still a horrible crime though, done by some bad guys...
@BlunckLoleta @80sToyStore @shortgirlme @AmyMek They did talk about it. It was all over the news. By now theyve been convicted + already released + I think Elorch was arrested again 4 guns
@onedayready @AmyMek @bfraser747 I do agree that attack is horrible, even worse that they were doing it to promote Trump/politics. But they weren't Muslims, they were bigots
@onedayready @AmyMek @bfraser747 1) that's a different crime, 2) that article doesn't say the attackers were Muslim, 3) this is the attack in video:		https://t.co/kguGRTb9FD

@wturner914 @AmyMek I don't know who you're referring to, but I'll note that this attack happened 9 years ago. Lots of outrage at the time, but very old news
@onedayready @AmyMek @bfraser747 They were outraged 9 years ago when this happened lol. Why would they be fixated on it a decade later?
@lesbianoutsider @G1bsonG1rl @AmyMek @chadfelixg It already has traction? It's a 9 year old story and there was a large reaction at the time...
@ABWright824 @AmyMek @USAlivestrong @morningmika @JoeNBC Why would she? It's 9 years old.
@uplander20 @AmyMek They were already represented (but I don't know who atty was). This attack happened 9 years ago, i assume they've gotten attorneys by now
@alaimoa1981 @AmyMek @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @CBS @maddow This happened 9 years ago. Why would you expect them to cover it again now?

@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods You as well!
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Should Xtians be judged based on Westboro or Kony? Extremists exist on all sides. Manchester is tragedy but extremist to blame, not Muslims
RT @ananavarro: Trump attacked: 1. BO for bowing, so did Trump; 2. MO not wearing veil, neither did Melania; 3. Clinton Fndtn getting Saudi…
@MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods This graphic isn't accurate. As one example, what about the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting? That was Christian terrorism...
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods I think it's a mistake to judge moderates based on the words of an extremist
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods All of those crimes would have been prevented by stopping extremists. But only half would be stopped focusing only on Muslims.
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Yes but they're not all Muslim. All groups have extremists who want to harm others. Let's focus on the right thing--the extremists.

@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Im just saying were safest focusing on the terrorists themselves, not Muslims. Well miss too many attackers and persecute too many innocents
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Sure, but also plenty of non Islamist attacks. Dallas, Bristol, recent UMD stabbing, Charleston (2015), Colorado Springs (2015), etc.
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Youre right, I overlooked Pulse. Point still stands US terrorists come from all groups. But no way to know stops b4 attack w/o sec clearance
@MichaelRWest1 @JHartenstine @RealJamesWoods Unfortunately many sources treat their job as distracting from stories they don't like, not sharing honest facts. Spin is fine, lies are not
@MichaelRWest1 @JHartenstine @RealJamesWoods Agreed! Thoughtfulness, consideration, and accurate information are always a benefit!

@Katastrophy1951 @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Bits. Have you? And what's your point?
@MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods My point is only that its not the grass thats dangerous, we should focus on snakes. Too many people against all Islam, not just extremists
@MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods Sure, but your meme makes it sound like mod Muslims are bad just for existing. Every​ group has extremists hiding within, not just Muslims
@JHartenstine @MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods To follow the analogy, use US and ally intel to identify and address specific threatening snakes, not call all grass evil and eliminate it
@MichaelRWest1 @RealJamesWoods This analogy confuses me. Is this an argument for wiping out all of the grass just to deal with a few snakes? Or find 🐍 to make grass safe?
@SR1911X @GtaThoughts @Destinbeach22 The article uses direct quotes from named sources, with links to the sources. But people invent facts/intentionally mislead to cry #fakenews

@Awake2406 @TrsNihi @purespoken @kwilli1046 Didn't say not serious. Please reread. I don't support either sides crimes. What I don't understand is why you're​ supporting a criminal?
@SiberalsLuck @hollytcollins @purespoken @Awake2406 @kwilli1046 Obviously. I hope they're unharmed and learn to be better citizens moving forward. And I hope you learn not to enjoy human suffering. Sad.
@TrsNihi @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Both are crimes but different crimes, punching more serious. Even so, one crime doesn't justify another. Why defend either crime? Both wrong
@SiberalsLuck @hollytcollins @purespoken @Awake2406 @kwilli1046 Wow. Very sick to describe other's suffering as a good thing. Politics doesn't justify cheering human suffering. I'll say a prayer for you.
@SiberalsLuck @jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 I'm not defending the protestors criminal actions. You're defending the driver's criminal and violent actions. Why???
@SiberalsLuck @jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 Just because one side broke a law doesn't justify or absolve the other side from breaking laws.
@hollytcollins @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Move very slowly forward and see if they move sounds reasonable. Too many people cheering for a tragedy/people getting hurt. Sad and sick!
@hollytcollins @purespoken @kwilli1046 You'd risk massive harm to US citizens just because you need to get to work a little faster? Very immoral and unamerican.
@SiberalsLuck @jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 No, if you use lethal force because you think you're helping an ambulance get through, you're also a criminal. You can't be a vigilante
@SiberalsLuck @jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 That doesn't justify you as a citizen choosing to use lethal force on their behalf. We're a society of laws, not vigilantes and terrorists.
@waynechandler63 @purespoken @kwilli1046 US law defines violence for political purposes as terrorism. Why are you supporting / encouraging terrorism? Don't like US or free speech?
@clmuseum @0bielicious @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 What's your point? You can't do something illegal to someone else just because they're doing something illegal. Youre still advocating crime
@waynechandler63 @purespoken @kwilli1046 You support violence against other humans because you disagree with their politics? Thats literally the definition of supporting terrorism
@Dom1983319 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 If it walks like a criminal, talks like a criminal...
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Do you not have any decency or compassion for other humans? You're laughing at a video of people getting potentially badly hurt. It's gross.
@Dom1983319 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 You said it was enough they touched his property lol. Either way, it's force beyond self defense. Criminal is criminal, even if provoked.
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Why laugh? Pray for everyone to be safe, go home to their families, and be good citizens. It's not politics, it's human decency.
@Dom1983319 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Yikes. You weren't raised right if you enjoy people getting hurt. I hope your future victims' families get justice.
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 I've answered it several times. Both sides are wrong, condemn both. But why are you choosing to defend a violent criminal? Politics?
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Laughing emojis about real people getting hurt or dying? Sick.
@Dom1983319 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Who laughs about real people suffering? Criminals and terrorists. Sociopaths. Only bad people.
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Gee wiz I don't know why someone would WANT others to get hurt when they don't have to. Truly sick. Only bad people cheer others tragedy
@Dom1983319 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Because I don't like violent criminals? I'll defend that any day. That's not left, that's being a good person.
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Both are wrong. Someone else doing something wrong doesn't justify doing anything you want. You still need to follow the law. Condemn​ both.
@Dom1983319 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Being disrespectful or touching someone's property justifies violent crime against them? No place in US for criminals who think that
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 The real problem is people thinking they're above the law. Running someone down like this is a crime. If you don't like US laws, leave.
@Awake2406 @Dom1983319 @purespoken @kwilli1046 You're back on this? So much for agree to disagree. But sure. You claim protestors kept them from going backwards? False, 0 behind the car.
@GeraldKoplitz @Rogue_Zadok1 @kwilli1046 Go around the block? Why do you WANT people to get hurt? That's not self defense, it's attempted murder. That's just evil and unAmerican.
@Rogue_Zadok1 @Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Not an excuse to run them down. What does that say about you that you'd be glad to hit someone with your car? That's sick.
@Rogue_Zadok1 @purespoken @kwilli1046 What kind of person WANTS people to get shot? Or laughs about it? Only bad people. Violence is sometimes necessary but always a tragedy.
@MayorK_jhonson @purespoken @kwilli1046 Maybe. But wouldnt that make it a tragic accident? Why are people cheering someone making a terrible mistake? Just bad people?
@FFgHunter @purespoken @kwilli1046 Them breaking the law isnt an excuse for you to break the law, you'd be a criminal too. Why harm or kill someone when you don't have to?
@waynechandler63 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Harming hundreds just so you dont have to reverse is a incredibly entitled. You cant attack someone just because you aren't getting your way
@waynechandler63 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Only a monster would think blocking a road justifies running over "a couple 100". What the heck is wrong with you??
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Not most. Some do. Sandy Hook didn't. Columbine didn't. OKC didn't. Charleston didn't. Etc. All groups are mostly good but have extremists
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Some are good citizens. Banning Islam strips Constitutional rights from some good, law abiding citizens. That's unAmerican.
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Some do. All groups have extremists. Not all Muslims are terrorists. I support those who are law abiding citizens.
@UnoSteveO @purespoken @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @kwilli1046 American citizens are entitled to the full Constitutional rights. It doesn't matter what you believe or think they believe.
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Protective violence is for those who need protection from imminent violence. Can't be used based on fear of another groups beliefs
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Disagree it represents that, but Constitution protects believing whatever you want. You just can't turn that into action.
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 (2/2) If someone doesn't like the law, too bad, try to change it. Follow it until then.
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 (1/2) Not a lefist sheeple, but appreciated. I just support a strict adherence to law.
@jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 Yup. Both broke the law. But standing in the street isn't the same as using unjustified lethal force. Seems easy to spot the bad (worse) guy
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Even if it's a cult (it's not), the Constitution protects cults. It's their American right. Don't be anti-Constitution/anti-America
@jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 Follow the law. Easy. If it changes then follow the new law. But right now the law is what it is.
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 You don't get to strip Americans of their Constitutional rights just because you disagree with their religion. This isn't Russia (yet).
@jagfannn @purespoken @kwilli1046 That is literally how this country works. It's the law, so it's how this country works by definition.
@UnoSteveO I support your right to use them responsibly. But lots of twitter users with itchy trigger fingers. That's irresponsible.
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 It literally says #BanIslam. You might not like it but it's their American right. All Americans are Americans, no matter what religion
@UnoSteveO @purespoken @kwilli1046 They sure can. But people looking to shoot when they don't have to are bad guys with guns.
@UnoSteveO If you follow the law, great. If not, I hope you (or anyone commiting gun violence) is prosecuted. Gun owners/users need to be responsible.
@UnoSteveO @BelmarCPA @purespoken @kwilli1046 Yes, if God forbid you have to. But that driver didn't have to use lethal force. The law says when you can and I support the law
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Responsible patriots follow the law. And your profile is anti-1st Amendment. You're not a patriot if you're against the Constitution. Simple
@UnoSteveO @purespoken @kwilli1046 Lots of bad guys with guns saying the same thing without sarcasm. Glad it's sarcasm.
@UnoSteveO Thats laughably untrue. Can't use lethal force if it's not justified. Again, making responsible gun owners look bad.
@UnoSteveO @BelmarCPA @purespoken @kwilli1046 War?? They're protestors, not soldiers. Are you really that afraid of them? Or do you just want an excuse to shoot?
@UnoSteveO @GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Statements like that harm good gun owners. Use guns responsibly. They're last resort tools-only cowards go to their last resort first
@UnoSteveO @purespoken @kwilli1046 Please dont. Wanting to shoot someone to avoid a dent makes you a "bad guy with a gun." Makes good/responsible gun owners look bad.
@UnoSteveO You don't get to use lethal force in self defense in one situation just because it would be justified in a different unrelated situation
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Do you see any weapons? Who used lethal force? Only the driver. Can't escalate just because you're afraid of others. Need to be reasonable
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 No I advocate following the law.
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 My whole point is it's not self defense. They weren't surrounded or being met with lethal force. They're the bad guy with a weapon this time
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 This isn't a citizen holding police accountable. You're defending a driver for running over a protestor and not "allowing unlawful behavior"
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Not legal advice, but that's just incorrct. In Texas cant until they enter the car or a reasonable belief of deadly force. See TPC Sec 9.31
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Not a citizens job to not "allow" unlawful behavior. Cant take law into your own hands. Law lets you protect yourself not be a vigilante
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 You're not entitled to do whatever you want just because someone is blocking traffic. You're not above the law. #EntitlementGeneration
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 I think we're on the same page? Using unnecessary violence on protestors is wrong. Protestors also shouldn't block streets. Both were wrong.
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Wow. Very entitled to think someone in your way justifies intentionally hitting them with a car. Agree to disagree I guess.
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Sure, they're breaking the law. But you don't get to hit someone with a car because they're doing something illegal or are in your way
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Enabling? They were wrong to block him but that doesn't justify running them over. Sorry my opinion hurt your feelings. Did you try Tumblr?
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 (2/2) not escalating to lethal force and saying it's okay because they were protestors. Good guys prevent violence, not escalate.
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 (1/2) Also, why wouldn't you want lawyers like me?? I'm encouraging following proper self defense laws and free speech.
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Do you assume every protestor is trying to kill you? Video appears to use lethal force on unarmed protestors. Why encourage escalation?
@Awake2406 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Who said I'm a lawyer?
@BelmarCPA @purespoken @kwilli1046 Can only speak for me, but I couldn't have gotten out of the way. Driver gave little warning. Maybe you're in better shape than me/them
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Snowflake applies to people who cry when people express opinions they dont like. I support free speech, not coddling your snowflake feelings
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Lol! I'm saying don't use unnecessary lethal force, you're crying about someone's​ opinion offending you. Only snowflakes think that's equal
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 You literally told someone to delete their account because their opinion upset you. If you need a "safe space" maybe try Tumblr?
@BelmarCPA @purespoken @kwilli1046 Sure they could have, but the point is that calm under duress could have ended it with nobody getting hurt. No need to escalate
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 (2/2) Didn't realize you were such a special snowflake you'd be offended by seeing something you don't agree with. Grow up.
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 (1/2) Entitled to run them over because they're in his way? And you said to delete my account because a tweet didnt apply to you.
@BelmarCPA @purespoken @kwilli1046 High speed? Nobody was behind him. How fast do you think you have to go to keep someone from walking behind your ca? Maybe 10mph?
@TadHasse @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 What matters for you is all that matters? Smh at the entitlement of people. Twitter isn't just you.
@GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 (2/2) Lots of replies wishing for a chance to shoot. Only bad guys WANT to commit gun violence. Makes us responsible gun owners look bad
@GeraldKoplitz @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 (1/2) Not devil's advocate. I'm against people intentionally causing avoidable violence and harm to others.
@Joelsh12 @purespoken @kwilli1046 Blocking you from going the direction you want doesn't justify intentionally hitting someone with a car.
@0bielicious @RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 Thank you for acknowledging it's not legal.
@Am1stActionComm @purespoken @kwilli1046 (2/2) with all of these tweets itching for an excuse to use lethal force against protestors or "libs", sure doesn't sound like mere defense.
@Am1stActionComm @purespoken @kwilli1046 (1/2) Many states have duty to attempt to retreat before resorting to lethal force. There was no attempt here. First move was lethal force.
@RabbleTheGamer @purespoken @kwilli1046 If you're in the US many (most?) states would disagree. You can't use lethal force if you can get away.
@KI4HRU @purespoken @kwilli1046 Thank goodness you said something. I was on the fence about it.
@purespoken @Capitalist_Jedi @kwilli1046 You literally said you wanted an excuse to attack someone with lethal force. That's not self defense. It's sociopathy.
@purespoken @kwilli1046 You're literally saying you want an excuse to violently attack others while claiming they're the ones mistreating you. Incredibly stupid.
@Capitalist_Jedi @purespoken @kwilli1046 (2/2) but you can't just assume they're going to escalate and use it as an excuse to attack them first.
@Capitalist_Jedi @purespoken @kwilli1046 (1/2) That's​ not what happened in the video. If they're trying to pull you out, drive away. That's actual danger.
@purespoken @kwilli1046 Lol at labeling me a lib just because I disagree with you. I'm just anti evil. Wanting to hurt someone just to get your rocks off is evil.
@purespoken @kwilli1046 And if you can back away and end the encounter without lethal force, why wouldnt you? Who WANTS to hurt other people??
@purespoken @kwilli1046 Why would you pray for the chance to kill someone? That's f-ed up. Shouldn't you want everyone to go home alive and unhamed?
@purespoken @kwilli1046 Lol at calling that a "lethal situation". You have to be a real coward for that to make you fear for your life. Also, why not just reverse?
