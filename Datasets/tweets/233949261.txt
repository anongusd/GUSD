I understand not every Democrat Senator believes the #SchumerShutdown is wise policy OR political strategy... time to make a decision. https://t.co/QFUEkrnN89
Time to make a decision.... https://t.co/l0AJpzB7ci
Despite the political desire of Senate Democrats to needlessly shut down the government, my offices will be open to assist veterans, seniors, and constituents across West Michigan.  Michigan's Senators need to exhibit leadership, not blindly support the #SchumerShutdown.
@rfischer @WOODTV Not blaming a party, I’m implicating a person (and supposed Leader) who is pressuring his caucus to not agree to a reasonable conclusion. There were 5 Dem votes for the last solution, not including either of our Mich Senators. Not House or POTUS. Again, #SchumerShutdown.
@erowekamp @WOODTV See above... NEEDLESS SHUTDOWN.
@slefebreHHS @WOODTV As you know, the current Senate rules require 60 votes for spending bills. The House sent ALL of the spending bills to the Senate in September and a stand alone CHIP bill in Oct but the Minority Leader refused to allow a vote.  Now we find ourself in a NEEDLESS shutdown.
@rfischer @WOODTV With all due respect Ross, this is a completely NEEDLESS shutdown caused by the Senate Minority  leader who can deliver the votes. We are dealing with DACA (which expires in March) but it is more important to keep the Govt open &amp; our military funded NOW. Hence: #SchumerShutdown

The #SchumerShutdown has occurred... still waiting for action.
Very disappointing votes cast just now by Michigan’s two senators. This was a moment for real leadership in keeping the government open. Instead they chose to play politics and follow the #SchumerShutdown playbook.
