These district judges opinions are the same thing as Bernie hiring an illegal. They are engaging in civil disobedience against our laws and core sovereignty. It's no more legit coming from a congressionally-created court than from a member of Congress. This admin is caving.

@kyleraccio He should be deported immediately.
@MarkSKrikorian @kyleraccio @CPAC Actually they never have the contrasting view on crime, you know, the tradition Reagan conservative view. They only have opposing views of the left. They always have home field advantage, we are always playing the away game.
@MarkSKrikorian @kyleraccio @CPAC #KochsRule
It's funny how the Feds seem to be a juggernaut in all areas of life except for when it comes to securing our sovereignty - their core job of protecting from external threats to the whole of the union. Suddenly, private entities and states can defeat them at every step.
So many  more illegals now get to stay, have anchor babies, and saddle us with the costs in violation of our laws duly passed by congress. Nothing matters anymore. We just don't matter.

The "conservative" legal movement cant have it both ways. They cant legitimize judicial supremacism and make the entire racket of the GOP about "Appointing better judges" and then fail to even verify where they are on key issues. "What do you want, a litmus test?"
We are getting killed in the courts on so many key civilization issues, yet when we have a free shot to nominate anyone we want, we refuse to give any confidence in their views and often see red flags to the contrary.

I’m seeing stupid people bring up Israel. It’s not true. Israel forces men to serve in the military. Women have to do national service, such as working in a pre school or at a shelter. Obviously if they sign up for the military they fulfill that, but they don’t have to.

@chiproytx And none of the defense money is for what our founders envisioned, like protecting our ranchers from cartels. It's for social work in a combat zone for Kabul urban renewal.
Whereas in 2005 we had one million-plus apprehensions, we also had one  million-plus returns and turnbacks at the border. Now those numbers are  down to 100,000-200,000 a year (not including removals from the  interior, which take forever).
none of the illegal aliens are returned, as the Mexicans were in  previous years, often within a few hours. Consequently, while the gross  immigration numbers last decade were higher, the net numbers are higher  now.  https://t.co/pd7e0e6DZB
This is the case Trump needs to make and also follow up with *multiple* policies that reflect it https://t.co/pd7e0e6DZB
@FrankelJeremy @WhiteHouse Those who dont have the final say. As for those who do, they need to hear from the rest of the movement that refuses to strengthen the hands of the good guys. Self fulfilling cycle of failure.
There has been a 1744% increase in credible fear petitions since 2009 and that doesnt include FY 2019 which has seen the biggest surge ever https://t.co/pd7e0e6DZB

Drugs don't produce and traffic themselves. The criminal aliens are more of an issue than the product. Drugs come in both at points of entry and between them. But the criminal aliens cooking and trafficking them come from between the points of entry https://t.co/Fwn64vlpQj

This is exactly what happened with jailbreak. The president never supported it and reiterated on Friday his support for tougher penalties and even the death penalty. Yet, Fox faux conservatives supported it bec. they felt they were supporting Trump but it was all Jared.
Remember, the birthright citizenship debate and aspects of the fight over the "Travel ban." They brought one phony scholar after another to attack the president while we gave all the intellectual firepower in support of him. It's about doing what's right consistently.
It's funny how facts don't matter and it all becomes about personalities. "oh you are attacking the president." Actually, what's interesting is that Fox will defend Trump when he goes left but they have no problem attacking him when he goes right.

I'm re-upping my full piece on how Trump has unquestionable authority to shut down all cross-border migration as inherent in Article II and 212f. If he is going to take executive action, this is what he should do and invoke Thomas on nationwide injunction https://t.co/h3bCdRNYft
Once we erroneously accede to the point that anyone in this troubled globe can come here and demand status, plus having the cartels control it, we are done https://t.co/5c6Ya8wSvF
We are also so busy yelping about executive power growing under all administrations. It's a valid concern. But a deeper concern is the notion that the judiciary can sack the other two branches and that their damage is permanent and irrevocable no matter the issue.
I think the decisions of all administrations in Afghanistan have been stupid. Can i sue them in a court of my choosing and determine the outcome? We need to move beyond this notion that a court can randomly adjudicate a policy issue.
@thehill How do you sue a political document that doesnt have any definitive action yet? So A) how is it ripe and B) why should the ACLU get standing? I don't care where you are on Trump, border, or executive order, but we need to stop acceding to the notion that you can just play court

You gotta be kidding me!!! Trump is lamenting our weak prison time for drug traffickers!  He just freaken signed a bill letting them go.
Walls are 100% effective when you dont have lawfare where they want to get caught.
No, we havent been breaking up the caravan. The one at EAgle Pass...we are letting in 28 a day. Might be a slow pace, but we are letting them in, even from a brazes caravan, much less from the quiet migration which is more substantial.
Hence, if you are using executive action, use it on the POLICIES and shut down the loopholes using Article II and 212f.
Yes, Mr. President, Israel's wall works because the wall makes them get caught, and if they are caught, they are either prosecuted or shot. Central Americans are given welfare and everything they need if they meet an agent, so they dont care about getting caught on the wall.
Walls helped in El Paso and Yuma when it was the mexican migration that we prosecuted or returned.
Border walls work if you have a border that you legally assert. But if you announce that you can surrender to an agent and get released, then they come around the wall, at ports, and yes, even over the wall because they dont care about getting caught.

Much better to use 212f and inherent Article II powers to block all cross-border migration, which directly addresses the *emergency* component of this and is the way to deter the invasion. Also, go after the cartels with military as commander-in-chief.
I've always supported treating the past year of migration like an emergency, but it needs to be treated that way across the board, not just to secure a campaign promise of a few billion for partial fencing.
@CBPArizona Yup, when you invite the world to come, they will come from everywhere, irrespective of your gradual partial fencing because they WANT to get caught.

@NateOnTheHill This is chemical warfare on the country that will be exacerbated. Section 224a of this bill will create billions in revenue for the cartels doing human smuggling of Central American teens.
If anything, the gradual construction of a partial wall mixed with the promise of robust amnesty for those who sponsor UACs is the worst possible mix because it gives the impression that the window is closing but still has plenty of places for them to come through.
@JJMitch234 The ACLU has home-field advantage, so they never need standing.
The national emergency we have at the border is not the lack of a wall, it's that we have policies that invite cartels to traffics kids for amnesty. This bill he will be signing takes that to the next level and poses a bigger national emergency than anything he can rectify.
Over the years, immigration lawyers and judges have cleverly taken statutes and flipped them 180 degrees to use for amnesty. Now Congress is green lighting it in plain language. You cannot imagine the cascading affects of this.

The goal of a national emergency is to end illegal immigration and cartel smuggling. Building 100-200 miles of fencing gradually will not do it. With this new amnesty,they UACs will come anywhere including points of entry and not only get amnesty for themselves but for those here
The big question is if the president was briefed on that section of the bill.  None of us even new about it until this morning.
After the president signs the bill he will anyway have to declare a national emergency from the cartel smuggling amnesty provision in it. In fact, it will create an international emergency.

Thus, they brilliantly limited the wall to just the area with liberal politics and then gave them veto power. For example, if they would do this in Cochise County, AZ, local officials would obviously support the wall. But this bill doesnt authorize wall there.
Here is the provision that appears to give local officials authority to block. Remember, the authorization to construct is only in the RGV of Texas. The RGV is some of the most liberal counties in the entire country (wonder why?). https://t.co/yN2hXUppUR
The bill prohibits fencing in 4 federal lands and one state park in the RGV. The whole issue with the wall in Texas was navigating private property. Thus, public lands are the EASIEST place, yet they ban construction. Cartels are setting up shop in these lands.

Any bill that truly addresses the border invasion would clamp down on this. Instead, the bill actually rewards the very family members who broke in and our empowering the cartels to not only erroneously treat the kids like refugees but shield them from deportation!
What is happening now is that our stupid gov't treats the very people who self-traffic and have their relatives pay to smuggle them in to reunite with them as refugees. A 180 degree violation of both provisions.
One of the major factors spawning this invasion is the bastardization of the UAC statute which provides refugee status for those minors who are victims of "A severe form of trafficking" AND have no relatives in this country.

@MarkSKrikorian So then why does he need this? just continue short term CR to keep the issue alive and the pressure on Dems as he uses executive action.
This is why there is only a 90% rejection rate of asylum for central America and not 100% when 0% of them fit the definition.

@IngrahamAngle Most of the Republicans on that committee are ardent amnesty supporters.  Hoeven was the lead sponsor of the final Senate version of the Gang of 8. Also, they know nothing about the issue.

Those being sold into slavery are being sold in Houston stash houses AFTER they are released thanks to catch and release that is not fixed in this deal, and is in fact made worse.
Dems increased their ask, ignored Trump's ask, plus Trump never even asked for asylum/UAC change. Then they walk back their demand and split the difference, but really they are gaining, not losing.
Man, this guy needs better people around him.
RT @TomJawetz: @MarkSKrikorian There is no extra fencing. It's the same level appropriated in FY18. Essentially a CR.
"i will never sign a bill that forces mass release of violent criminals into our country." ahhh...that just happened with the jailbreak bill in December. And those are the worst folks working for the cartels.
Well, Mr. President, Shelby and Republicans just signed off on a deal that also lets out criminals but just not as many.
@MarkSKrikorian Especially when to begin with, the crisis is from the court-driven asylum, not 55 miles of fencing.
To begin with, without getting rid of catch and release, nothing is worth it. Instead, this deal cuts detention beds by 17%. Not worth 55 miles of fencing. Time to deal with the cartels with military.
OK, enough stupid farm bill, jailbreak, and phony opioid bills (the two contradict each other). Get the the real thing already.
Now he's touting jailbreak which literally let go all those working for cartels.
@jamiedupree Except Dems got in detention bed cut.
This deal not only declines to fix catch and release, which is a bigger issue than strategic fencing, it induces more of it by cutting detention beds. Not worth it for 55 miles of fence.
@SteveDeaceShow This is worse than what this entire fight started out with in December. Dems suddenly introduced a new demand and then split the difference on it! ICE policies are worse than the funding issue.

Mexican drug cartel culture is rooted in the belief system and worshiping of the Cult of La Santa Muerte or “Saint Death”.  That is how they justify their satanic behavior. Now you can appreciate why the Left is so pro-cartel. They essentially do the same thing with infanticide.
I've been wondering for so long why the left never cared about terrorist cartels on our border chopping up bodies. I guess we know the answer now: they view them as late term abortions.

If we're just going to play the court game on statutes that arent justaciable, then Trump should preemptively get someone to sue him in a district within the 8th circuit.

Trump could announce the designation of the cartels as terrorists. That would at least cushion the cave a little. But he wont.
This man could have threatened a veto 7 times with House in charge. if this is it, then lets step aside and nominate someone else. It's now or never. This is ridiculous. What will change in a second term?
No border security plan can work without ending the lawfare, Mr. President.
I was actually going to give him some rope when i heard this announcement, but this speech is a "read my lips" speech.
So Trump's threat to leverage Dems in 3 weeks from now is........?
Trump is right about walls keeping drugs out but not with the asylees. That is lawfare and if you dont end it, then forget it.
"This isn’t about nice anymore. This isn’t about committees. This isn’t about let’s get everybody and have dinners, and let’s have everybody go to a Blue Ribbon committee and everybody gets a medal for, frankly, talking and doing nothing."
Trump made fun out of blue ribbon commissions on drugs and promised death penalty before Jared got him to cave. This is the same thing.
So all the non essential HUD workers got a 5-week paid vacation. Hey, ill take delayed pay in return for that any day. Obviously, for essential workers its a different story.

Migration from Mexico to the U.S. is actually down, even as violence  skyrockets there. The number of family units crossing from Mexico is  down almost 50 percent since FY 2015.
Overall, while asylum petitions have spiked by 1,744 percent since 2009,  homicide has dropped 16 percent in El Salvador, 35 percent in Honduras,  and 43 percent in Guatemala.
Yet violence is down in Central America, and Central Americans are more likely to experience violence while making the trip.
Pelosi and Schumer are selling their policies as compassionate to those  suffering from violence, yet their policies are actually inducing  unimaginable violence upon the Mexicans while the Mexicans aren’t even  coming here any more in large numbers. https://t.co/l27cNbsUHG

@AnnCoulter Courts are now giving standing to come in from outside the country now.
@pjnovot Yes, so she will pass something out of the House that takes this and makes it even worse, and then Senate "Republicans" will feel in the hot seat to pass it.
https://t.co/9muxkulDKe The UAC/asylum stuff is literally the impetus for the problems we have. They are a bigger problem than 250 miles of fencing is a solution.
Remember, if potus commits to walk away then it's fine. But if this is just the opening bid, it will be worse than getting nothing. Here are just 3 of many reasons why a partial wall gradually built in return for immediate amnesty and no policy changes is worse than nothing.
Some might say all House conservatives already voted for at least the non-TPS part of this deal last year. But that was in exchange for UAC/asylum/sanctuary/expedited deportations/end of chain migration/limiting court involvement and many other critical things.
We have to be very careful before getting Senate Republicans pregnant on passing amnesty before there is any parallel agreement from Dems to give us anything we want.
@rdetert @MarkSKrikorian Exactly.
If this amnesty deal passes the Senate, i hate to tell you what sort of monster will come out of the House. Once an amnesty train gets rolling like that you are dealing with radioactivity, especially if it throws a few billion $$ that Trump can call "the wall."

@MarkSKrikorian he never gives a darn about the american people and wont speak on this issue unless amnesty comes up. It's like political porn for him.
@MarkSKrikorian Yes, but the question is do we now go back to messaging for our own sovereignty or does this get negotiated down more and become all about amnesty. I'm all ok with this if Trump walks away.
Which is why the most important thing is to stop the self immolating POLICIES.  Then build the wall and it will work for the rest of the problem.

Thus, if you have a strategy of bluffing to expose radicalism of the other side, you need your whole team on board. But if one guy offers it (not really intending for it to happen) but so many others on "the same side" really want it, now they have a license to run with it.
Again, you can't view this offer in a vaccum. You have to ask what is the next step. Also understand that so many people around him and almost all Senate Rs love the amnesty stuff in their own right even WITHOUT all funding and will run with it.
Either way, long time readers of our hundreds of articles and podcasts on every face of this issue understand that this is not about some $$$. The main issue are the policies that are fleecing us and allowing them to steal our sovereignty.
One more thing: the right flank always needs to hold down the flank. In other words, even if u think this is a great political ploy to expose dems but wont ultimately be enacted, the best way of ensuring success of that strategy is to give Trump a right flank pressuring him.
Mark Morgan, former Border Patrol chief tells me so many of these UACs are very problematic. These are the very people who would get amnesty https://t.co/CHzHEe3up3
@CBPElCentro And El Centro is one of the "quieter" sectors.
The ENTIRE crisis now and really beginning in 2014 is from the judicially-driven loopholes in asylum (among many other problems with the courts). It was bizarre that this 800 pound gorilla was never the ask to begin with, but all the more unacceptable once u are offering amnesty
With that said, if potus walks away from Dem balk and then continues just talking about our needs, then this is totally fine. But if this is a way of Jared getting us to negotiate down and change discussion then its a problem.
What this does is take the discussion away from how illegal immigration harms us and moves it to the needs of the very people who empowered drug cartels and brought in gangs (many of them are DACA age). Dems will just negotiate down. Will get a few billion for amnesty sans policy
For those of u who think this is a clever way of exposing Dems for objecting this while ensuring amnesty won't pass, you need to remember how Dems negotiate. If you give them 95%, they initially feign outrage in order to get 100%. They are good. That is how you negotiate.

It's like offering to put out a fire with a blowtorch.  DACA is the impetus for the problem and is a much bigger problem than the lack of the wall. If we didnt have the amnesty agenda , we woudlnt even need a wall.
So now we've taken the first time in years we've finally had a national dialogue on the border and once again hijacked it with amnesty. What is so disgusting is the DACA is the very amnesty that is responsible for this very border crisis, the drug crisis, and the gang crisis.

@JordanSchachtel Just last year hundreds of Bangladeshis came just in the Laredo sector https://t.co/CBRyWp8ZbW We don't need to debate whether we saw prayer rugs.
I challenge anyone in the media to go down to central America and visit the camps of middle easterners coming north that are monitored every day by Panamanian officials with the help of US gov't. @BensmanTodd can give you all the info https://t.co/61wC5U72kr
Just watch this video and look at these pictures of what is happening in Panama now and how DHS has given the Panamanians equipment to help monitor the more problematic ones from the Middle East https://t.co/61wC5U72kr
Here's the bottom line: the media knows that this issue has the ability to break this debate wide-open, which is why they have to deny plain facts that are open to any journalist who wants to interview a border official or any official in a Central American gov't.
Debating prayer rugs when we have thousands of middle easterners coming in plain site is like debating whether you see a icicle during a polar vortex. The prayer rugs are besides the point, but yes, they tend to shed their belonging when they get here so they are not identified
I'll have @BensmanTodd on my show on Monday and he will reveal insane details about this. For now, listen to my interview with Mark Morgan, Obama's former border chief, discussing how many of the middle easterners are getting released https://t.co/CHzHEe3up3
Post 2014 era is when both our magnets of asylum grew and the breakdown of the Middle East with the civil wars. They are coming just like the Central Americans. There are just not as many because its more expensive and logistically harder and we are not as hospitable to them.
Prayer rugs is what we talked from 9/11 to 2006 when House Homeland Committee first observed it and we didnt really see them but suspected there was trace evidence.  That has long changed.
You can check out all his videos and pictures and personal interviews with the middle easterners coming. https://t.co/Q9FFAmhg6I To deny their existence when Jeh Johnson sent out a memo in June 2016  warning of a growing problem is insane.
@BensmanTodd has done the most work on this issue for years as a journalist and then for Texas DPS intel and counter-terrorism. He recently did an entire trip to Panama showing how DHS has an entire program controlling the flow from Panama https://t.co/rrfsaKyoJH
The media is mentally ill with their flat earth denial of Middle Easterners at the border. They are sitting ans debating trace evidence of rugs as if that is all we have to go on. DHS and FBI have debriefed thousands of them every year and have an entire process dealing with them

This is true of asylum, UACs, detention, deportations, sanctuaries, etc. It all comes from a judicial bastardization of the laws, not the laws. The laws say the opposite.
Let's make something abundantly clear: While our legal immigration laws are outdated and broken, our illegal immigration laws governing sovereignty absolutely are not broken. It's the judges and the cowardice of the politicians that are broken and violating them.
The courts accomplish every week what Dems have wanted to but have failed to accomplish in Congress in a generation. And they do so without any electoral reprisal.
If a judge simply says immigration law is immoral and im not following it, is that the law of the land?  Because that has already happened a number of times while everyone sleeps.

By building the wall and dramatically reducing the flow of migrants, which are are the strategic diversion of the cartels (as well as money makers), it frees up the agents to focus on the criminality and security threats, including tunnels.
But of course they fail to tell you that by having thousands of bogus asylees being shoved at our border patrol every day by the cartels, it ties them down and they dont have the resources to deal with the drugs, tunnels, and national security threats.
So for example, after years of calling us kooks for suggesting that the cartels are as serious as Hezbollah in israel and are digging tunnels, now they are running with that point in order to discredit the wall.
If you watch carefully, the media, in their attempt to discredit the utility of a border wall, are actually engaging in a self-indictment of just how serious the emergency at our border is.

This is all happening on OUR side of the border and not just at the border but in all 50 states as a result of the political class's gift that keeps giving to the most evil global criminal organizations on the face of the planet.

In November, we set a record of 25.1k family units caught between points of entry and those were just the ones we caught. While full December numbers arent out yet, the family units appear to have been over 27k, a new record.
It takes about a year to return just the total of aliens that come from a  mere few days of apprehensions! In that sense, this wave is much more  devastating to American taxpayers than previous waves because it’s  permanent.
For example, of the 31,754 unaccompanied minors CBP apprehended from the  Central America in fiscal year 2017, 98.2 percent remain in the country  today.
According to the DHS, only 1.1 percent of non-Mexican family unit aliens  had been repatriated and only 1.8 percent of non-Mexican unaccompanied  alien minors had been repatriated.
While the overall numbers of illegals crossing was hire in some previous decades, the net effect was less because we returned over 1 million annually and usually within a few hours. Now we only return 100-200k because of asylum loophole and courts https://t.co/XLW2nwcKCD

If local authorities were properly fighting the drug crisis,  upon  catching the first street distributor, it would lead them to the  broader network. But that would involve arresting and turning over  illegal aliens to ICE.
That is, unless you operate in a sanctuary city, where they do  everything possible to avoid detaining illegal aliens caught on drug  charges.
It’s one thing to come to this country illegally and get across the  border undetected. But it’s much harder to remain undetected in  perpetuity and successfully operate a profitable drug network.

@philipaklein Exactly! But that is almost entirely the courts. Also, in my view, around summer 2017 he started talking about amnesty again. But yes, that spawned a new surge and this is why now.

"These gangs are also responsible for a substantial portion of the city’s violent crime."
"Chicago is home to several street gangs that are heavily involved 	in drug distribution, and collectively these gangs serve as the primary mid-	level and retail-level drug distributors for the cartels."
"The Mexican cartels provide a steady stream of drugs to the Chicago area. 	Though the Sinaloa Cartel and CJNG are the city’s most notable sources 	of supply, other Mexican cartels that deliver drugs to the area.."
"Besides drug trafficking, street gangs near the Southwest Border engage in a multitude of crimes, including weapons trafficking, alien smuggling, human trafficking, prostitution, extortion, robbery, auto theft, assault, murder, 	racketeering, and money laundering."
More from DEA: "Gang members serve multiple roles, including acting as hit men, providing protection, or trafficking illicit drugs back into the United States for sale and distribution."
DEA's latest threat assessment: "In many of the southernmost states, 	street gangs, especially the transnational Hispanic gangs, exploit the Southwest Border, predominantly in California and Texas, traversing into Mexico to work with cartels." #BuildTheWall

@WhittyPics Thats right. 2014 was DAPA.
The border invasion we've had from Central America on and off since 2014 led to the worst gang and drug crisis in our history. It was spawned by DACA. Romney ran for president right when Obama implemented it and refused to utter a word.
Mitt Romney won the GOP nomination in 2014 by lying about his views on immigration and getting to the right of Gingrich. With a literal invasion at our border as he is slated to take office, Romney has nothing to say on the issue.

Americans would take that any day of  the week over the shutdown of our nation-state at the hands of illegal  invaders and drug cartels.
To that end, today, the nonessential portion of 25 percent of the 30  percent of the government that is discretionary, yet not fully funded  through September, is shut down.
70 percent of government is mandatory spending and not subject to  appropriations, while 75 percent of the remaining 30 percent of  discretionary spending, including the military and Veterans’ Affairs, is  already funded for the remainder of this fiscal year.
if the onetime $25 billion cost of the border wall will trump the  hundreds of billions of annual costs from illegal aliens, then what is  the point of passing a federal budget at all?
If the federal government refuses to take care of us and illegal aliens  get to suck us dry with welfare, catch-and-release, sanctuaries,  birthright citizenship, and being counted in our own reapportionment, then why even have a federal government at all?
We have 50 state governments, over 3,000 county governments, and a total of roughly 90,000  local and municipal governments in this country.  Why do we need a  federal government if not to protect us from external threats?
At its core, we have a federal government to protect Americans from  external threats while states and local governments take care of  internal affairs.

If you look at the last time annual apprehensions reached over 700,000,  our apprehension rate was only 40 percent, which would put us at a  projected flow of 1.7 million per year.
Last week, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen testified  before the House Judiciary Committee that the Border Patrol is averaging  2,100 apprehensions per day so far this fiscal year. That is  an  annualized rate of 766,500 illegals. Those are just the ones we catch.
putting aside the merits of our Middle East policies,  if you believe we need security in the Middle East, then by a factor of  10,000 you should be clamoring for it on our own border.

Remember, we have 3,000+ county governments and 50 state governments that are not even experiencing a fake shutdown.Why do we even need a federal government? Well, the most important role is to protect from "external" threats, as Madison said. If we cant have a border, no purpose

Foreign invaders were given standing through the ACLU to sue our national border and Roberts refuses to even consider such an absurdity of a lower court judge. If he won't even recognize his supremacism over inferior courts, we shouldnt recognize any supremacism.
At this point, just have them put an injunction on a lack of funding and mandate a budget. We only have one branch of government.

This all leads to one conclusion. At some point, it's not the other branches "not listening"to the courts, but the courts engaging in civil disobedience against constitution, laws, sovereignty, and their own precedent. It should be regarded as moot. Especially with bogus standing
Now, you might say that statute (8 USC 1158(3)) explicitly bars judicial review of such a decision. But that hasn't mattered in the past.
However, if we are going to accede to judicial supremacism, it wont matter in the long run. We now have Roberts on record as ok with lower courts screwing with 1182f and inherent executive power to deny entry for the 1st time. They will just "strike down" the agreement with AMLO
The only saving grace is that hopefully the new agreement with AMLO will make this moot. Because if they are processed in Mexico, there is no reason to send to our border point of entry, and its actually better.

Now, there is the issue of Erdogan, where i do believe Trump is being weak (although that is a continuation of the past 2 admin's bad policies), but that has to do with soft power, not so much the 2k troops in the intractable tribal dumpster fire.
Worse, if anything, we were helping Iran there because we were holding down the sunni insurgency for them, which is exactly why they achieved hegemony.
Trump caved to State Department (over objection of Bolton) on oil and financial sanctions and Annex III of Iran deal (civil nuclear cooperation, yet the foreign policy establishment crowd didn't bash him. That is a much bigger deal than 2k soldiers in Syria

Why don't House Republicans demand wall funding in exchange for passing Jailbreak, a Democrat priority? Answer: Republicans want Soros agenda so badly, they give it away for free without getting anything in return.
So there is no misunderstanding, Lindsey Graham is just as much of a Lindsey today as he was before the Kavanaugh saga.
Nielsen just confirmed what we know. Most of those coming here are for economic purposes or family reunification. Again, violence rates are actually down in Central American while migration is up.
So now Republicans are demanding more low skilled visas at the hearing.
Violence is DOWN in Central America. They are coming because since 2013 we announced catch and release and Obama illegally expanded asylum https://t.co/xGtSCFKtet
@JessicaV_CIS And in the past, at this rate, they have predicted only 50% are interdicted. That is an insane fiscal burden, security problem, gangs, drugs. The magnitude of this problem is being covered up by GOP's reluctance to make it an issue.
But these are the ones we caught.  Hundreds of thousands more weren't apprehended, as Lamar Smith trying to say.  And i would say most likely the ones we dont catch are pound for pound worse than the ones we do because Cartels orchestrate it that way.
DHS SEC said they are averaging 2100 apprehensions a day this year. That would be 766,500 annualized.

Why, as the final act of the GOP Congress, did leadership pick the one  thing that Democrats gladly support anyway? Are they trying to save the  Democrats’ time for impeachment? Because they sure don’t want  transparency and a protracted debate.
If they know that every single Democrat supports this, why won’t they  wait until after Christmas and debate this like human beings and from  all angles – Left, Right, and nonpartisan changes to the system? Why the rush?
