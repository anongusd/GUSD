@AskPS_UK Can you resend the link? The one you shared yielded an error page.
@AskPS_UK I was able to get in touch with them and received the below response. This is very disappointing. There are message boards filled with upset gamers who have echoed this issue since 2016. I would still like to return this product and receive a refund. https://t.co/S3aNKlFQWl
@AskPS_UK I am not able to get in touch with them, do you know of any way? Their ‚Äúcontact‚Äù section on their website just refers to a Q&amp;A. The website seems pretty outdated as well.
@AskPS_UK May I return the download I made on the PS4 and get a refund? I have attempted to contact the developer and they are not very helpful. I am going to purchase the original hard copy of the game and play it on my old system.
@AskPS_UK No. It‚Äôs clearly a glitch that‚Äôs built into the game‚Äôs update. How might I get in touch with them?

@AskPS_UK there is a glitch in a download of PS1 game on PS4 that is significantly affecting the quality of the game. Is there anyway we can submit a request to have it patched? There are many others online I have found through message boards that share the same concern.
