Trump is abusing his power to declare an “emergency” so he can use the military to build his unnecessary and wasteful border wall. Putting aside the fact that this is likely illegal, it’s absurd to think what is happening on the border today qualifies as a national emergency.
Things that are a national emergency:	- Opioid epidemic	- Russian interference in our elections  	- Climate change    	- Gun violence 		Things that are not a national emergency:	-Building a wall on the southern border.

This #TrumpShutdown is irresponsible and harmful to the American people. When Democrats take control of the House in January, we will work to ensure the Trump Administration and Republicans do not hold the budget process hostage.
The partial government shutdown is about to hit the one-week mark. 		Instead of ensuring a government that works for American families, #TrumpShutdown means:	➡️25% of federal government shut down.	➡️380,000 workers sent home without pay.	➡️420,000 workers on the job without pay.
Merry Christmas one and all! May this season bring you blessings of joy and peace for the New Year ahead! https://t.co/GdJBYCBLOn

Republicans in the NCGA must understand that changing the law after the election, to require a new primary, is likely unconstitutional. This newly enacted legislation discredits NC once again in the eyes of the Nation. It will further delay representation for citizens of #NC09.
The Republican Party was informed of possible election fraud after the 2018 primary election, but chose to do nothing.  Now that this failure to act has been exposed, #NCGA is attempting to protect this congressional seat by any means necessary, including a new primary election.
GOP in the #NCGA is bracing for a finding of substantial absentee ballot fraud in #NC09 General Election. So much so that they are attempting to change current law after the election has already been held, opening the door for a new primary in addition to a new general election.
UPDATE on #NC09: I am joined by @RepDavidEPrice and @RepAdams in officially calling on the @NCSBE to conclude its investigation into allegations of absentee ballot fraud expeditiously, and pursue all available remedies, including the conduct of a new general election. 		{thread}

It is interesting that this alleged absentee ballot scheme was reported to the United States Attorney’s office after the 2016 elections and no official actions were taken to protect the integrity of the 2018 election in #NC09.
An evidentiary hearing will disclose the obvious misconduct of Republican operatives in Bladen County and determine whether the Republican Party or its nominee knew or should have known of this absentee ballot election scheme.
I am in continued communication with House leadership to ensure the House is prepared for every outcome including holding an emergency congressional hearing to determine whether there is substantial evidence of election fraud in #NC09 on the part of Mark Harris or his surrogates.
Our democracy relies on fair elections.  The evidence of election fraud in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District is mounting by the day. [thread] https://t.co/fhWeImAePP

If confirmed, Farr would represent many of the same people he tried to disenfranchise. The counties in the Eastern District of NC have a large African American population. This is just one troubling reason why there is absolutely no place on the federal bench for Thomas Farr.
Thomas Farr then defended the campaign’s postcard scheme in 1992 when the Justice Department filed a complaint against the Jesse Helms campaign for its efforts to intimidate Black voters.
Thomas Farr served as an attorney for the Jesse Helms campaign during this time and reports indicate that Farr participated in the discussions about challenging voter residency.
In 1990, the Jesse Helms campaign engaged in a scheme to discourage voter turnout, sending postcards to more than 100,000 North Carolinians – mostly African Americans- warning that they might be ineligible to vote and could be arrested for voter fraud if they came to the polls.
The Senate is expected to vote today to make Thomas Farr a federal judge in North Carolina.		Who is Thomas Farr? For starters, he was a lawyer for then-Senator Jesse Helms’ campaign, where he defended the campaign in its efforts to disenfranchise African American voters.

Thomas Farr is an extreme nominee whose record raises serious questions regarding his commitment to equal justice under the law. I will do everything I can to stop his confirmation.
P.S. - The Eastern District of NC has never had an African American judge in its 143-year history, despite having a large African American population. President Obama nominated TWO accomplished African American women for this vacancy (both were blocked by GOP Senators).
If confirmed, Farr would represent many of the same people he tried to disenfranchise. The counties in the Eastern District have a substantial African American population.
Thomas Farr went on to defend a shameful voter suppression law in NC- the same one that a federal court ruled targeted Black voters “with almost surgical precision."
Farr has a long record of defending voter suppression tactics such as voter intimidation and voter ID laws. He advised Jesse Helms’ campaign in the early 90s, which sent postcards to voters in heavily Black areas falsely informing them they could be arrested for casting a ballot.

That is why I am calling for DOJ and ICE to undertake an investigation to examine the circumstances by which these subpoenas were issued, the scope of the subpoenas, and the seemingly political motivations behind them. (end)
Given what we know about the scope of the subpoenas, and the counties that were targeted, I strongly suspect that this is part of the Trump administration’s dangerous and anti-democratic strategy of voter suppression and intimidation to limit equal access to the ballot box.
The subpoenas demanding millions of North Carolina voter records are overly broad, request private voter information, and appear to target voters of color.

Instead of trying to make healthcare less affordable for 130 million Americans, we should be working together to strengthen the ACA, lower premiums, and deliver quality affordable healthcare for every American.
Without the ACA's protections for pre-existing conditions, insurance companies will again be able to deny coverage or charge higher premiums for things like high blood pressure, mental illness, or being a woman.
Today, the GOP is in court with a lawsuit to strike down the ACA's protections for people w/ pre-existing conditions.		If you’re one of the 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition, here’s why we need to do everything we can to #protectourcare 	 https://t.co/FydmP8gw7j

I have vivid recollections of the 1963 March on Washington. A hot August day with thousands of people lining the streets with signs and joining hands for a common purpose. As we remember this day in 1963, we do not just celebrate this history- we commemorate it.

There’s an easy way to improve the lives of millions of Americans: raise the federal minimum wage.		9 years ago today was the last time Congress raised the minimum wage (when @NancyPelosi was speaker). $7.25 is not a living wage in 2018, but thats what millions of Americans make

Republicans continue to push a far-right agenda that favors the few at the expense of the many. But no one wins when our politics devolve to the point of a government shut down.
Let me be clear: The CR that was to be considered by the Senate originated in the House of Representstives. The American people must understand that House Republicans refused to include Democrats in the formation of the budget resolution.
Republicans control the House. They control the Senate. They control the White House. Notwithstanding, we are now some 140 days into the fiscal year, and we still have no appropriations bill...and last night they failed and the American people will suffer.

What happened to making our children a top priority, @GOP? CHIP expired months ago- risking the health care of 9M children.  Yet, you prioritized a massive tax scam that puts tax cuts for the super-rich over the financial security of middle-class families? https://t.co/WWP0XNbyDk
Meanwhile... 	Government funding is scheduled to expire in 12 days. 	CHIP funding is already expired. 	And hundreds of thousands of Dreamers are currently exposed to the threat of deportation. https://t.co/5J3T5KBGfL

Today's vote was the first step towards using tax cuts for the wealthy to justify cuts to programs that benefit many Americans.
Every vote today for the GOP tax bill was a vote for:	-Raising taxes on 86 million middle-class families	-Taking health coverage away from 13 million people	-Giving 83% of tax cuts to the top 1%	-Increasing the deficit by $1.5 trillion.		I voted NO.
I will be voting NO on the GOP tax bill today because there is a better way to reform our tax code- one that is bipartisan, transparent, and fair for all North Carolinians and Americans.

My letter w/ @OfficialCBC opposing Thomas Farr’s confirmation to US District Judge for the Eastern District of NC. https://t.co/ssvNwzUQFx https://t.co/1gJeFgrsla
This nomination continues the trend under the Trump Administration of an attack to the civil rights &amp; voting rights of people of color.
The White House deliberately sought to identify an attorney in NC with a hostile record on the voting rights of minority groups.
Thomas Farr has been at the forefront of the fight to disenfranchise AA voters in NC. Now President Trump wants him to be a federal judge.
This seat is the longest jud. vacancy in the country, in no small measure bc GOP refused to confirm 2 Obama noms. Both were women of color.
This morning, the Senate will consider the nomination of Thomas Farr for a lifetime seat on US District Court for the Eastern District of NC

Before Pres. Obama, the US was hemorrhaging jobs. Since 2010, the economy has added nearly 16 million new jobs. #ThanksObama
Before #ACA, 105mil Americans' employer-provided coverage had lifetime limits. Now, that’s zero –because ACA made them illegal. #ThanksObama

Republicans want to repeal the #ACA, disrupting coverage for 20mil ...and their replacement plan?		Spoiler Alert🚨 : They don't have one.
Before the #ACA, women paid up to 47% more than men for their health insurance. GOP wants to roll efforts back and #MakeAmericaSickAgain.
70,000 #NC children who have gained coverage since the enactment of the #ACA risk having their coverage rolled back. We can't allow this.
Seniors in #NC saved an average of $1,013 on Medicare prescription drugs, but Repubs want to turn back the costs. #KeepNCcovered https://t.co/bMceKZ6z96
