We must focus on actions that can bend the cost curve, like investing in preventive care, using the government‚Äôs purchasing power to lower drug prices, and paying for quality of care, rather than quantity. (5/5)
If you need chemotherapy to treat your breast cancer, but you‚Äôve underfunded your HSA and have a $2,700 deductible, what happens? If your child gets sick, will you take her to the doctor or keep her at home based on how much of your deductible you‚Äôve paid down? (4/5)
Central to the Republican vision has been to move more and more consumers to high deductible plans, which have lower premiums but ask consumers to pay more for doctor visits and services before the health plan covers care.  (3/5)
But HSAs do little to bend the so-called health care cost curve. This is the problem we must focus on ‚Äì how do we provide top-quality care while reducing our overall national health care spending AND lowering consumers‚Äô out-of-pocket costs. (2/5)
RM @MartinHeinrich: HSAs are particularly helpful for those earning more than $100,000 who are already saving for retirement, and have less trouble covering their monthly bills and student loan payments.  (1/5)

Closely monitoring implementation and establishing appropriate guardrails either through rules or additional action by Congress can go a long way toward ensuring that #OpportunityZones bring new economic activity to communities who desperately need it. (5/5)

Dem witness @darrwest of @BrookingsInst on the #innovation economy: It is crucial that all people share in the benefits of the innovation economy. Right now, there are significant disparities in access to digital technology based on income, race, and education. (1/2)

We also need smart policies that can help emerging industries grow.  Targeted tax credits, competitive grants, and prize competitions are all levers Congress can pull. (5/6)
Promoting innovation also means extending already developed technologies, like broadband, to communities currently without access. Today, years after high-speed internet was first made available, 19 million rural Americans still lack access. (4/6)
We need to expand middle-skills pathways into emerging sectors, and make a college education accessible and affordable for all Americans, so that every student has the opportunity to benefit from tomorrow‚Äôs innovations. (3/6)

My Republican colleagues could have joined with Democrats to invest in children, workers, education and our long-term economic success.
Think about how we could have invested the $1.5 trillion spent on the tax bill. We could have erased every student loan in the country. (5/5)
So far, corporations have announced more than $210 billion in stock buybacks, benefiting executives &amp; wealthy shareholders. While there have been some bonus &amp; wage announcements, they total just $6 billion‚Äìa fraction of the money going to executives and the investor class. (4/5)
If we wanted to reform the tax code to help the middle class, we could have simply cut taxes for the middle class. (3/5)
Independent analysis shows that within 10 years, more than half of working families will pay higher taxes than they would have before the new GOP tax law. Meanwhile, the wealthiest 5 percent walk away with an astonishing 99 percent of the tax benefits. (2/5)
