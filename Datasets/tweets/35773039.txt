4/ Those moose occupy more space in the forest‚Äîbrushing up against more trees and picking up more parasites. The ticks, in turn, bleed the moose dry. In some cases, they take one-third of the moose‚Äôs weight or half their blood volume.
3/ As New England‚Äôs climate grows warmer, more ticks survive winter. Furthermore, as the number of moose increase thanks to strict hunting laws, the density of the moose population increases too.
2/ How? It‚Äôs complicated. A combination of climate change and seesawing hunting regulations in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine mean that moose are more uniquely vulnerable to hungry bloodsuckers. (Art by Jonathan Bartlett) https://t.co/RwGbWYLMdb
1/  Adult moose are huge, with females averaging more than 800 pounds and males about 1,100; some weigh as much as 1,700 pounds. It‚Äôs striking, then, that bugs the size of pinky fingernails‚Äîticks‚Äîare bringing some moose populations to their knees. https://t.co/GnWDd8nEvz

8/8 Read the latest from @craigchilds_ to learn more about death caps, including their risks, migrations, and appearances. And don‚Äôt eat mushrooms you don‚Äôt recognize. https://t.co/6MIQFuaD56
7/ Symptoms can easily be confused with those of general food poisoning, but the stakes are much higher. And, unfortunately, there is no antidote.
6/ In 2014, one person died of death-cap poisoning in Michigan; two in California; and one in Vancouver. A 3-year-old boy from Victoria died in 2013 after consuming mushrooms that had been found outside an apartment complex. https://t.co/teaNeuI80x
5/ Both of them died within two days while awaiting liver transplants; one guest also became ill, but survived after a successful surgery. That same year, more than 30 death-cap poisonings were reported, including three deaths, while 2013 saw five total cases and no fatalities.
4/ Unfortunately, death caps are not commonly recognized. In 2012, an experienced Chinese-born chef and his assistant prepared a New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner that included locally gathered death caps.
3/ If ingested, death caps can cause severe illness within six to 36 hours. Critical liver damage is usually apparent after 72 hours, and fatality can occur after a week or longer. They account for more than 90 percent of mushroom-related poisonings and fatalities worldwide.
2/ Death caps first appeared in North America in 1997, in British Columbia. Then they appeared in Victoria, and then in Vancouver. Now, they appear on the sidewalk in urban neighborhoods and have become a constant menace to those in the Bay Area.
