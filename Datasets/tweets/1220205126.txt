@alecjasonn @SeesacksRun Apparently not enough of the base to get the nomination.
@SeesacksRun @alecjasonn That is where name recognition comes in. People will vote for a name they recognize over the better (less known) candidate.
@alecjasonn @SeesacksRun Let me say this, fellas: i have enjoyed this convo. I work in politics, and you two have engaged in a better, more logical convo than many in DC.
@alecjasonn @SeesacksRun I disagree. Having people "primary" our elected officails is a way to, at minimum, keep them active and willing to do things that Bernis has done. I will agree, Bernie is a old man who the young people love.
