@GetUpStandUp2 @shaunking @BernieSanders Shaun King is WHITEEEE!!!! Look at his parents haha this is a joke, he claims his father is not the man on his birth certificate...convenient, then show us who is
@shaunking @CoryBooker It is bullshit because Shaun king is actually a white person biologically, at least cory booker is black in his DNA, Shaun king chooses to be black when it benefits him
@KamalaHarris So an American who spends and invests his money poorly and recklessly and takes out loan after loan b/c democrats have eliminated credit reporting bureaus, this person should just get all his money back and a do-over?
@shaunking https://t.co/wYttsej7gu
@MichaelAvenatti Relax man, the fact that you’re worthy of being mocked on SNL is an accomplishment, people know your name, you’re a lawyer getting the star treatment, be flattered, not offended
@shaunking I love when you conveniently leave out key details like the fact that the “racist” cop who shot him was actually black haha horrible nazi bastard that cop
@AOC Looks like someone is in panic mode after her little wanna be dictator antics were exposed
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Stop referring to it as “their health” as if they’re trying to cut carbs or something, it doesn’t matter if the number is lower, young girls are getting abortions as emergency contraception because of their own irresponsible behavior, not b/c it’s hazardous to their health
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Because I was in high school 15 years ago and these were my experiences
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth I meant medically induced because they are a danger to the mothers life, obviously I believe a mothers life being in danger is a justified reason for an abortion, not some young girl who is embarrassment about being a slut (I know of about 10 of these)
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth So if your neighbor shoots his wife, is that also none of your business
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth What do you think of D&amp;E btw you never said, totally ethical right?
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth No I’m talking about the decision a girl makes in ten seconds after her first missed period cuz she’s embarrassed to tell her friends and parents and liberals tell her it’s ok to not deal with the circumstances of your mistakes cuz we’ll take care of it super quick
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth They’re not trying to control just their own bodies, they’re trying to control the bodies of helpless babies because of their own mistakes, instead of owning their mistakes, they pay 100 bucks and kill a baby as a get out of jail free card instead of using adoption
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Sounds like the hopeless feeling I get when i see thousands of women marching in the streets screaming angrily about their rights to abort and kill their own unborn children
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth I don’t think you can just say your issue is genuine and ours is not just because you don’t share the same view. Both sides are trying to preserve life
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Conservatives have been against abortion of any kind outside of rape and incest, long before this latest fiasco, you say we genuinely have a gun problem, conservatives think we genuinely have an abortion problem, we believe a beating heart indicates life
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth You’re using people from these massacres to push political agendas
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth And if you think they’re is a consensus on when life and viability begins then you’re incredibly close minded, one would imagine a beating heart indicates a living baby but people get abortions long after that
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Isn’t that what you’re doing with gun control then, what’s the difference, are you trying to say it’s different because you’re genuine and they are not?
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Regardless if you agree or not that it’s a viable life at stake, their motive is the preservation of life, which is your entire argument for gun control. So why such heavy criticism for people ultimately trying to do what you’re doing, preserve and appreciate life.
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth What confuses me is that while liberals fight tooth and nail for gun control to preserve lives, as foolish and diluted as that logic is, why do you vilify conservatives so harshly for trying to preserve what they view as a viable life
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth According to this logic, a baby is not a baby until it’s born so why are you against late term abortion if it’s not a baby yet anyway
@ava @shaunking Central Park five may not have deserved to be in jail over 20 years for a crime they didn’t commit, but this is going to attempt to clean up the fact that these dudes were absolute scumbag criminals, this is gonna paint them as these clean cut scholars hahaha what a joke
@ava @shaunking The Central Park five were a bunch of scum bag criminals
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Conservatives are not fighting medically induced first term miscarriages, theyre fighting the miscarriages you use for viable fetuses to cover the fact that you screwed up and brought a child into the world out of stupidity, using abortion as emergency contraception
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth You’re so wrong on so many levels, MANY 2nd trimester babies survive when born at 6 months. Obviously you think nothing of the fact that they rip these babies apart limb from limb, which is just insane, killing fetuses to cover your mistake is wrong, this is not hyperbole
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Ripped apart limb by limb, you support this though, because you’re just so open minded
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth Do yourself a favor and google how most 2nd term abortions are done. It’s called dilation and evacuation. You should probably research these things before you blindly support them like some pet for socialists. You might learn a thing or two
@JimUicker Sex trafficking is for the purposes of prostitution
@JimUicker Hahah so prostitution is now Trumps fault also. Wow Trump Derangement Syndrome is a scary thing
@JimUicker @SenDuckworth The second you take that baby out it’s breathing, is your argument that because the baby has technically not taken a breath outside the womb that it doesn’t count as a person yet? Are you that warped? Out of sight out of mind huh?
@AbdulElSayed You do realize that the top 1% pays 40% of the total taxes in the country right? And the top 10% pay over 70%!!!!! The bottom 50% of taxpayers pay less than 1%! What the hell do people have to complain about. Go out and earn, the victim and race cards are so tired
@SenDuckworth This is not about “women’s healthcare” as you fraud and fake news outlets like to package it, this is about abortion, the process of pulling a living breathing baby apart limb by limb while it’s in the womb. You are clinging desperately to your “right” to kill your own children
@mehdirhasan No that was the Democratic Party, and they clinged to it for dear life
@maddow Why are people upset about this? He’s a high ranking staffer and aide to the President of the United States. Am I missing something?
@ZerlinaMaxwell BLM has done NOTHING to influence criminal justice reform, the disorganized nature of this group has done nothing but serve as a thorn in the side and an obstacle to ppl who are actually trying to help. BLM is a sham for people w/ their own motives. Controversy means money to BLM
@BernieSanders Every child in this country has access to good education, weather or not they want to take advantage of that or spoil it is up to them, but once they choose to waste their brains and settle into laziness and complaints, then capitalism will do its job and spit them out!!
@maziehirono Yet you want the heavy hand of government to take over our healthcare, energy, and transportation systems
@IlhanMN Communists are the worst kinds of terrorists
@shaunking Unarmed and non-violent Hahahaha these are always the words used by the wanna be victims before video inevitably emerges of them throwing projectiles by the hundreds at guards in order to incite a response so that white boy shaun king and other idiots can jump all over it
@IlhanMN None of this stuff will become law haha you just wasted your time and taxpayer dollars on legislation you knew would never pass to make a statement, that’s a monumental waste of resources
@AOC 30th time this week you’ve felt the need to pat yourself on the back for doing your job
@billmaher Not ideal but it’s better than being with Bernie Sanders, a pretty open and unabashed communist
@PattyMurray Again with the “women’s healthcare”? This isn’t about women’s healthcare and you know it. This is about ABORTION, stop trying to package it into something more tidy and public friendly. You want to abort babies, conservatives do not. This has ALWAYS been about ABORTION!!
@LisaBloom He’s also the only Democrat with a chance of defeating trump, no one else is even close especially not Bernie who has NO chance of winning a general election, Democrats need to make a choice, ensure a candidate who is not ideal, or four more years of trump, period
@RepBarbaraLee Is it systemic barriers or just laziness
@washingtonpost Your bias is painful, first you chastise him for taking the meeting at all and now you chastise him for walking away from an unsatisfactory deal, Washington post is FAKE NEWS
@sethmoulton If there was no border in this section, those pineapples would be in the hands of drug dealers you fool, are you this obtuse, a wall literally stopped these drugs, now imagine if these borders were set up everywhere, we’d have a lot more pineapples
@KamalaHarris The fact that conservatives ever wasted time and money fighting this is an embarrassment to my party
@chelseahandler I love calimari, when it’s crispy obviously, nothing worse than stringy calimari
@maziehirono This is easily the dumbest member in legislative branch history, hearing her speak is cringe worthy and an embarrassment to hawaii
@AOC How many times a day do you pat yourself on the back for doing your job
@ryanstruyk @shaunking The fact that Biden is even close in New Hampshire, Bernie’s neighbor, means that he and only he has a shot at beating trump, no one else is even going to come close, Bernie could NEVER win a general election, even democrats know this, it’s Biden or it’s gonna be 4 more Trump
@KamalaHarris Democrats when they lose “the will of the people has been subverted”    Democrats when they win “the people have spoken” haha be more obvious in your bias please
@LarryFulmerJr @JingleB29935991 @tyme_precious @ABC And what part about my statement was wrong, does this man have a constitutional right to wear this hat and sit in peace at a restaurant? Yes he does. Does she have the right to disagree? Yes she does. Does she have the right to attack him because of it? Go ahead and answer that
@LarryFulmerJr @JingleB29935991 @tyme_precious @ABC Haha do you people hear yourselves, do you realize what you’ve become? You have gone so far off the rails that you are comparing a hat with words talking about making our country great, to the KKK. You have become so sensitive it’s laughable. Grow up and be a man, not a 5 yo girl
@AOC @OversightDems I wouldn’t be able to stop laughing https://t.co/KMepUNOHED
@AOC @OversightDems I wouldn’t be able to stop laughing
@LarryFulmerJr @JingleB29935991 @tyme_precious @ABC You do understand you just made our point right, first of all she doesn’t have constitutional rights because she’s here illegally so she has no citizen rights, second of all, she impeded on another mans constitutional rights by attacking him and trying to rip his hat off
@adrineh23 @nytimes Yeah they must have a load of evidence considering the investigation has taken two years, and all the leaks to the press include ZERO hard facts about collusion, sounds like a slam dunk case
@shaunking @AOC @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib And still no evidence of collusion even after the questioning of the three stooges
@JamilSmith @AOC @RepAOC And still no evidence of collusion
@theappeal @shaunking A startled movement? Stealing a car and driving it at people is a startled movement now?
@AyannaPressley @shaunking And still no evidence of collusion
@nytimes And still no evidence of collusion
@RedactedTonight For you to equate this stuff to slavery is an insult to the actual suffering of slaves
@billmaher Hahahaha you’re a smart guy bill, you don’t really believe this answer that he’s doing this out of some moral obligation to the American people! I mean come on, the guys a joke
@shaunking @MarkMeadows Of course because you think think everything and everyone is racist, you’re the clichè of using the race card for every single obstacle in every black persons life, the ironic thing is that you’re white
@RepJeffries If it’s actually a national emergency, why didn’t you ever call for Obama or trump to declare it one before a couple weeks ago? What changed
@Brickh123 @NBCNews There’s video
@shaunking @AOC Every conservative hates her like cancer, that’s half the country right there, and probably about 40% of democrats, while amused by her rankling of the conservatives, think she is wayyyy to socialist to win an election, she has a very loud, but ultimately small fan base
@KamalaHarris I dk why I feel this way, I think it’s because of your bland over simplified tweets, but you’re coming off as extremely boring.
@shaunking Yes according to your standards because according to you, all white people are racist! Which is odd because you’re white yourself
@AOC Learning IN the job? Wow you’re right you’re so smart you should be lawyer you’d be a great success
@washingtonpost It’s called placating, obviously the post doesn’t know how to sell so I wouldn’t expect you to understand
@shaunking Easy answer, we don’t care if Trump lies, we care if he produces results, and that he does... 21% decrease in black poverty since his election, lowest EVER black unemployment, lowest EVER food stamp enrollment, Korean War is all but over, markets and economy booming!!!
@whatstherukkus @AdyBarkan @shaunking Have you even heard the horror stories of the VA, that’s government run healthcare, it’s abysmal, this will cost taxpayers over 30 TRILLION dollars!!! The government should not be intruding into people’s lives like this, it’s another step towards a massive bloated body
@ZamTheWriter @AOC No one is looking at you I promise
@tyme_precious @ABC Such an American thought right there, along with burning books and banning the pledge of allegiance
@TonyRobertsIV @ABC Trying and failing, once again proving their point that she’s a criminal and a perpetual loser as she rots back in her home country
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK It’s called capitalism baby, lousy businesses die and lazy people get pushed out, educate yourself and work hard if you want to stay in your neighborhood, otherwise, more successful people will take over, it’s a perfect colorblind system, only the strong survive
@nytimes The fact that it’s being used in mainstream liberal conversations is why the Democrats are going to lose again in 2020. They are scaring away half their electorate
@washingtonpost And your opinion is that people want money for free right haha and that’s what you’re basing your entire socialist government support on
@RashidaTlaib And here comes the veto, you did nothing but delay the inevitable
@IlhanMN People don’t hate you because of your faith or sex, they hate you because of your socialist policies and the fact that your an idiot, an immature child, and an ignorant America-bashing unpatriotic moron
@rubinafillion @AOC @SenWarren @SenSanders This is so horribly misleading it’s painful. Americans support these things until the second you tell them how much it’s going to raise their taxes and then they want NOTHING to do with it, these figures are DEAD WRONG!!!
@MikeLevinCA @shaunking What about the five emergencies Obama declared, did he NEED to do those?
@Alyssa_Milano So you care about immigrant babies but not about American babies?
@KamalaHarris Wow you’re an idiot, this is the stuff we’re stopping, all the stuff that actually gets through is through the other parts where there is no wall, this woman thinks we just solved the countries cocaine import problem
@AdyBarkan @shaunking Are you really trying to say that if we don’t support this that we don’t care about the well being of the handicapped
@RepJoeKennedy @shaunking @RepJayapal 32 TRILLION DOLLARS hahahaha good luck getting Americans on board
@DanielLMcAdams It means he’d rather starve his people than take aid from his enemies
@ACLU Haha what does this have to do with the color of his skin? Where do you get race from ANY of this?
@marcorubio @DineshDSouza But according to Bernie Sanders, he does not qualify as a dictator. I guess you have to decrease unemployment and stimulate the economy to decade best proportions to earn that label from Bern
@AdyBarkan @shaunking This bill would cost taxpayers 30 trillion dollars, we like to leave that part out don’t we
@nytimes You’re showing a picture of one of the most successful coaches of all time next to a headline that talks about people like this being responsible for a lack of productivity! Haha why is the times such garbage now it used to be so respected
@KamalaHarris I know these are the talking points your team says are going to get you elected, but I’m sorry, you sound like a stale tired Washington bureaucrat, these lines are not going to differentiate you from even the most junior democrat running
@washingtonpost Of course they do because he’s a Democrat and when it comes to the defense of Democrats then they’re all for due process. If this was a republican he’d have people camped outside his office trying to get a viral altercation
@SenDuckworth Do you realize that the 70 year Korean War is all but over and the worst nuclear problem since the Cuban missile crisis has been dissolved? Accomplished nothing? How did Obama and the 10 president who came before do in this arena?
RT @mrotzie: When Bernie Sanders' father emigrated to America from Poland, he left behind many members of his family who would eventually b…
@ryangrim @AOC @BernieSanders @ewarren @mehdirhasan Where do you get this from? Most Americans? Half of the Democratic Party is being scared away and every conservative unequivocally despises them! Where do you get this stuff
@thor_benson Yeah because all of the democrats supporting Jussie Smollett in their tweets went over so well
@RepTedDeutch So your solution is to do what? Let them all in unequivocally
@RealBankReform @RepAOC Yeah let’s stop taking credit scores into account, that way anyone can borrow tons of money and default on their loans. This is the beginning of socialism.
@SenKamalaHarris I honestly don’t know a single person who has ever had a problem voting outside of waiting in a line and I’m from NJ, the most densely populated state in the country. This is such a pathetic political tool
@SenKamalaHarris No one is trying to interrupt “women’s health care” or “reproductive rights”! Please stop using these phrases as a tidy package to disguise the truth. You want to preserve your right to kill children after they were born and that is why people are fleeing the pro choice movement
@RashidaTlaib It has to do with responsibility you fool
@AOC She’s right, people want to feel like their work has value! You want to hand out checks to people without any skills and who are unwilling to better themselves. This is called socialism. This is called the USSR
@alexisgoldstein @AOC This woman doesn’t think banks should look at credit scores when making loans, this will be fantastic for the economy when half the country defaults
@RashidaTlaib Capitalism is peopleism
@AOC EVERY single conservative is against your policies and probably about 40% of Democrats, how do you interpret this the be a majority or a popular decision? Can you possibly be this out of touch?
@SopanDeb So we can’t insult the intelligence of someone of color? We insult trumps intelligence all the time and he’s a prominent white man. This race card is so played that you’ve wasted all your opportunities to do something productive with it, we get it, everyone everywhere is racist
@nytimes This woman should be charged with child endangerment, she is responsible for her child’s death, period!
@saikatc Journalists are the enemy of the people, haven’t always been, but they are now
@MeetYourDA @theappeal It’s shorter because this wasn’t a typical 2nd degree murder case, it was a police officer on the job who made a big mistake, fortunately for you, your work mistakes don’t cost lives, but a mistake it was
@popcornreel @kiernamayo Are you not free? Let me know immediately I’ll call the police
@washingtonpost How again is it catastrophic if the country is benefiting, look at the markets and the unemployment rate... am I missing something? Would people really rather have a guy like Obama in there who says all the right things and then does NOTHING for the economy or it’s people?
@ruthbenghiat Democrats are such fools, they’re all going to cannibalize each other and drive each other so far to the left, they’re going to be virtually unelectable, I can’t wait for their disappointment! They’ll reveal themselves to be such hardcore socialists, moderate dems won’t vote
@chaim_katzman @realDonaldTrump You’re avoiding the central question. We obviously have opposing views about abortion that’s fine, but specifically for this question, do you think it’s ok to kill an infant after it’s been born? Just answer that one question
@IlhanMN Are you so desperate to keep socialism alive that you’re unwilling to admit to the horrors going on in Venezuela
@Annabelle1101 @realDonaldTrump Are you saying you agree that a woman has the right to murder a newborn baby? Forget every other political issue for a second, do you think a woman and a doctor have the right to murder a newborn baby?

@SenWarren @SenateGOP Their health? STOP packaging this as women’s health and reproductive rights!! This is about preserving your right to murder a newborn baby!! You people are sick Pocahontas! You are fighting tooth and nail for the right to murder a newborn baby! How do you not see this?
@AOC You do realize that fascism is a leftist movement right, the Nazis were the NATIONAL SOCIALIST PARTY
@Savannahcatmom @theappeal Speaking in general here, cannot talk about every single case in the history of mankind, how about this 95% of these cases start the same way... better?
@shaunking King, you have made a lucrative career as a white man pretending to be black. You can eat at all the fancy restaurants you want, you can buy yourself a nice car, probably live in a nice home, and yet you continuously trash the country that gave it to you hahah only in America
@RepJeffries Playing footsie? You mean ending the longest running war on the planet? You mean ending the most dangerous standoff since the Cuban missile crisis? It’s insane just how diluted the democrats are. Obama tried AND FAILED to do this so many times!! Trump ends Korean War!!
@shaunking White power?? Haha every legal Latino guy I know in jersey LOVES trump, you’re so out of touch white boy it’s painful, and btw no one is going to take you completely seriously till we see a DNA test
@zblay Well black panther was awful but the others were great
@theappeal @shaunking Jesus, so now we’re going to stop using crime stopping tools because they catch more black people then white people? Now we’re labeling computer programs as racist?!?! This is getting out of control. If there are white people in gangs that it’s not accounting for then add them!!
@Savannahcatmom @theappeal heard of because they were UNQUESTIONABLY justified and you moved on, the media didn’t cover it for months because it didn’t fit their narrative. So they moved on the 1% of cases to dwell on b/c you and the rest of the sheep eat it up with a spoon
@Savannahcatmom @theappeal Wowwww so you’ve got what, 5 or 6 there from the past ten years? This is a country of hundreds of millions of people, obviously there are exceptions. I’m speaking about the VAST majority. You know Michael brown, Eric Garner, Freddy gray and the hundreds of others that you haven’t
@_jhoolelal @Toddkron @cybenning @g0nz4l0g0nz4l31 @marcorubio Go to Venezuela and then when you come back here crying and screaming and half dead from starvation, you’ll see the difference I promise you... socialism is a cancer and it needs to be contained and killed at every opportunity. It’s a system that has failed 100% of the time
@_jhoolelal @Toddkron @cybenning @g0nz4l0g0nz4l31 @marcorubio Are you people moronic, are there poor starving people in a country of hundreds of millions? Yes obviously but our problems are not systemic and nationwide in EVERY city. Here in NYC, there’s not a single street that looks like Venezuela, are you really this blinded by socialism
@NBCNews So basically it started under Obama’s watch
@nytimes Yeah because they’re lazy and have no skill and thought a bachelors degree guaranteed them success, now that they realize they have no talent or skill, they want money handed to them, those of us who have something valuable to contribute will continue to support capitalism
@BLeeForCongress This is a business!!! Not a charity!! Government has no business interfering in the free market? So because black people are caught breaking the law more often, we should start handing out licenses disproportionately to minorities as an apology for THEM breaking the law?
@NYTmag I’m so sick of this min wage thing! If you want to make more money, get off your lazy ass and educate yourself, go to trade school, don’t have 3 kids before you’re 22 years old, work harder, a 15$ min wage will encourage scumbags to keep being scumbags, capitalism kills the lazy
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It also cooled the tensions of a simmering problem that could’ve ended in nuclear war!! We are away from the brink because of our president you old bag, a 60 year Korean War is also all but over once again because of our president #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
@theappeal not sayin that this killing is justified although it can be argued because he was STEALING a cop car and a car is a deadly weapon, but notice all these police shootings start the exact same way, someone breaking the law. You want to protect your kids? Teach them to follow the law
@shaunking @Morehouse I didn’t know they let white people into Morehouse
@shaunking Born to your WHITE parents
@AOC @MylesMill You’re from WESTCHESTER!!!!
@Aistina @HypoSarc @thehill Any country that still bows before a Queen really doesn’t have much ground to stand on, sorry murph
@Aistina @HypoSarc @thehill https://t.co/m7cCryfDfI
@Aistina @HypoSarc @thehill Haha let’s just leave this woman alone she’s clearly out of her mind, you’re right honey, GO EUROPE!!! GO SOCIALISM!!! God save the decaying corpse of a Queen!! And her 90 year old son!
@Aistina @HypoSarc @thehill Capitalism baby... Gods way of determining who is smart... and who is poor, now please go back to worshipping your old decrepit senile leader who can’t even take a flight of stairs, a symbol to the world how great and powerful England is
@Aistina @HypoSarc @thehill And when you take home 50% of your paycheck because of your “free healthcare”, we’ll be just fine over here. Because I don’t need free healthcare, my job provides it because I actually went to college and educated myself while the lazy go without coverage...
@Aistina @HypoSarc @thehill look I’m not saying UK isn’t a very good place to live, it absolutely is. But this is America honey, you’re simply not on our level at this point. This is where the best scientists, models, actors, lawyers, etc. in the world come to compete, not many head to Birmingham do they
@nytimes Thank God for them
@Aistina @thehill Is that supposed to convince me of something? Do you want to be England? This is AMERICA!! CAPITALISM!! Competition, innovation, things that don’t result from a year off in the middle of your career. You want 52 weeks, go to England
@ACLUVA Here’s an idea, if you can’t afford bail, then follow the law. Easy fix isn’t it
@RealSaavedra @SebGorka I don’t know who this lunatic woman talks to but I don’t know a single person who eats a hamburger for every meal. I see what she’s trying to do but her oversimplifications are just patronizing and make her look so insanely dumb
@thehill 12 weeks haha were supposed to pay someone for 3 months without working, Democrats truly act like money grows on trees, with all these new policies enacted we will need an 80% income tax
@nowthisnews Are you saying this guy is innocent?
@thehill Notice how people are trying their hardest to smear the only moderate Democrat running, their sabotaging their own to bring the party further to the left, this is the only Democrat who’s got a shot at winning in the general
@SenSanders @shaunking You DO NOT have the people on your side... people support Medicare for all until you tell them how much it’s going to raise their taxes, then your “support” dwindles away. You know this but you choose to leave it out of your statements
@overtime @shaunking @____wells____ A 15 year old was murdered in cold blood today in NYC by bangers, you talk about far right groups being the worst terrorists in our country, but you NEVER comment on the gang violence across our cities that results in more death than any other type of terrorism
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU As I find abortion, and I feel like there’s almost no place for me in politics anymore because you get dismissed as soon as you fall off the party line
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU The problem is that everyone feels the need so fall so neatly into a deomocrat or republican, there’s no way that every single person agrees with every position their party takes, I support common sense gun laws, I find any discrimination against the LGBTQ community as abhorrent
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU That our politicians have lost all ability to empathize and compromise and the people are taking their cues from the elected officials, which just drives this massive wedge into the country, and it’s making me crazy, the lunatics on both sides are infuriating
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU It’s all good I get it, these are insanely complex issues, I just get annoyed at the fact that every single Hollywood type is a Democrat really haha, I’m a super moderate center leaning conservative so I can see your points, I just lean a little more right, the problem is however
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU Oh no i think the declaration of emergency for the wall is wrong, probably should’ve mentioned that, it spits on the separation of powers and is completely unnecessary and a horrible waste of resources, I agree with you that it’s absolutely dead wrong
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU This is you incredibly unbiased CNN bringing it to you big man https://t.co/4tP3CCdZrZ
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU *not the lowest it’s ever been
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU Ok wait so are you trying to say for example black unemployment is the lowest it’s ever been? This is how desperate you guys have become? When you look at facts now you just say those aren’t real? Please answer that question... are you disputing this fact
@TMZ @shaunking @shaunking is the most pathetic individual on social media. First of all... he’s white and pretending to be black and has still refused tests to confirm he’s white. Second of all, he hates his own whiteness so much, he’s trying to defend a guy who delegitimized hate crimes
@jeffpearlman Do you understand how many guys knelt in protest who are still working happily in the league? 25% of every team was doing it, All these guys are still playing. There’s one scrub crap QB who is not playing because he’s mediocre AND he has a ton of baggage, just like Tebow
@ChrisMurphyCT That just makes me think the Democrats are willing to be short-sighted to gain political capital, why would you just unilaterally rule out the assistance of the military when so many lives are at stake
@AOC Sorry honey but they are making you look extremely dumb, no one cares who’s paying for it, they care that while you move into your new upscale apartment, you’re smiling about taking 11 billion dollars in tax revenue and 4 billion in annual salaries with you
@MichaelAvenatti I think it means that once you’ve beaten a case of sexual assault in court that now you can walk around and sexually assault anyone you want for the rest of your life with total immunity
@thehill All of a sudden the Dems are constitutionalists, despite trying to shred the second amendment every chance they get, not to mention attempt to use the 25th amendment in a way the people who created it NEVER EVER could’ve imagined
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU No idea what he’s doing? US energy is independent, black unemployment is the lowest it has EVER been, Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it has EVER been, he ended a 70 year Korean War, ISIS has been wiped off the mat w/o sacrificing 1,000 marines, and the economy is booming
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU Let me ask you something then, if you thought all of these things were national emergencies, why weren’t you calling for the president to declare them months ago? What makes them so suddenly worthy of being national emergencies? Where were you 6 months ago?
@therealkevinTE @realamberheard @ACLU I never said she doesn’t, but just because you CAN say something, doesn’t mean you SHOULD, the country is fed up with the opinions actors, they seem to think they’re uniquely qualified in politics as if there is some sort of crossover between acting and public administration
@redbeandesign @SenKamalaHarris I know you fervently march in the street and foam at the mouth for the right to murder your own baby, but just because your mind is so warped you can’t see the forest for the trees, doesn’t mean the rest of us can’t see this thinly veiled attempt to preserve your right to murder
@redbeandesign @SenKamalaHarris Every hospital in America has an OBGYN and if they had a real issue, they can go there. Don’t tell me that planned parenthood is saving lives in rural Kansas because Susie can’t afford the bus fare to get all the way in to Topeka to see the OBGYN. This is about ABORTIONS!!
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK When he wins 3 more championships then he has a case
@SenJeffMerkley @PPFA Every single piece of healthcare is offered at local physicians and primary care facilities. Can we please stop pretending planned parenthood is essential to women’s health, this is about ABORTION! No one is trying to limit “women’s healthcare”, just the right to murder unborn
@AOC I guess you’re just better at your job than Dianne Feinstein whose been doing what you do for the past 30 years. Because she staunchly opposes it. Oh my who should the liberals believe
@GOPChairwoman @SebGorka I’m realizing now that no one ever has to resign, they just have to hang on till the next scandal, Nixon would’ve been fine if he was around in the 24:7 news cycle age
@Wilsifer1 @BuzzFeedNews Shit winds capt shiid... shit winds
@NBCNews Is this seriously an issue? A guy wore a confederate uniform in Tennessee 40 years ago hahaha are people really trying to make this into something
@BuzzFeedNews I bet she wants us to wait for due process in this one, not the others but for her son, we need to let the investigation play out right, these people are pathetic
@ChristopOConnor @shaunking Oh you mean the man who refused to comply and then pulled a deadly weapon on police officers. Guess what people, schizophrenics are perfectly capable of killing someone even if they’re in their right mind. Next time the cop should allow himself to be stabbed since the guy is sick
@realamberheard @ACLU Wow another ridiculous actress shooting off about politics, how shocking, what makes people paid to play make believe think their opinions should be taken seriously? This one thinks the president should declare a national emergency over assaults
@AOC A flood of left wing economists back your crazy new deal, how shocking
@AOC Wow you have really taken to the entitled out of touch bureaucrat quickly, these people in the cheap seats are the ones who elect people like you and the ones who pay your salary, first amazon now comments like this, keep biting the hand that feeds you, I’m sure it’ll go well
@Lemi4 @BuzzFeedNews What’s your case for allowing them back
@BuzzFeedNews No one is debating this, no one thinks they should be allowed back, it’s a consensus, not a debate
@NYTMetro @nytimes These people are hilarious, they don’t mind giving trump millions of dollars but they just don’t want people to know?
@redbeandesign @SenKamalaHarris No, the issue is that people want easy access to ABORTIONS, what forms of contraception and healthcare are available at these clinics that aren’t available at your local physician or primary care facility besides abortions please tell me what we’re depriving these women of
@AOC How about the choice to move into a building that excludes normal Americans, a type of building that you yourself destroyed during your campaign? What about that choice you hypocritical wanna-be?
@IlhanMN He’s just gonna veto it you fool, don’t you understand how your own government works
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost I know construction workers who make 90,000$ a year! So if you don’t want to develop your skills in a trade, or educate yourself, you still want to reward these people?
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost And if they don’t have the drive to do any of these things then they don’t deserve to make a lot of money, it’s called capitalism, we don’t reward laziness, we reward hard work... you want to reward people who don’t have the “drive” to better themselves?
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost You don’t need money to be accepted into Harvard first of all, and you want to reward people who don’t have the drive to educate themselves, no one is saying they have to go to Harvard, they can go to state school or a trade school
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost Explain then, and answer that question, does any citizen in this country not have these options?
@sarahkendzior Wow, never stop reaching democrats haha
@SenSchumer Women’s reproductive rights? Ohhhh you mean the right to murder a baby ok ok I wasn’t sure what reproductive rights meant for a second there
@SenSchumer Notice how you leave out the words abortion in all of this, you package it as women’s health and reproductive care because you understand that murdering babies doesn’t sound too great
@KamalaHarris Women marching around screaming and passionately protesting for the right to kill their own children... this is pretty scary
@SenKamalaHarris Please stop referring to it as women’s healthcare or reproductive rights, you’re fighting for the right to kill your unborn children, nothing more nothing less, no one trying to limit your healthcare or your access to birth control, just you ability to kill babies
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost And name a single citizen of this country who doesn’t have the option to work hard enough to get into any school they want, earn whatever degree they want, and become the best in their field in whatever career they choose... go ahead, who does not have this choice?
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost Better tutors? That’s what separates us from becoming part of the 1%? Are you kidding me? Harvard accepts kids from every background imaginable every year. Every single kid has the option to study and work hard enough to attend whatever college they want! They CHOOSE not to
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost And what do you want to do about wealthy children? Limit their opportunities? What opportunities do they have that others don’t? Better schools? That changes nothing, colleges accept students from any high school in America!
@ERNIE444 @washingtonpost yes it is the case, every single child in this country has the choice to go to school, go to college, grad school, trade school, get a PhD, work their butts off and become the best in their field, name a single citizen who does not have that choice please
@verainstitute @Alyssa_Milano Does this irrelevant actress realize that no one takes a word of she says seriously? What in the world makes a terrible actress think people should listen to her?
@NBCNews Are we really trying to blame trump for this?
@NBCNews Who doesn’t have anxiety? We all have it, these kids need to buck up, grow up, and get a job. Every single person on earth has to be diagnosed nowadays, ADD for kids who like to have fun, anxiety for kids who get nervous. Let’s stop pampering please
@washingtonpost Rather than stress 24/7 about income equality, people should shut their mouths, educate themselves, work hard, and work to get their piece of the pie, every single American has these opportunities to become part of the 1% if they weren’t so busy complaining about not being one
@_waleedshahid @AOC @justicedems @sunrisemvmt That just proves the stupidity of them all, or their ignorance of what it actually says
@washingtonpost Do walls really frighten people
@maziehirono @PPGNHI Please stop calling it reproductive rights, you’re fighting for the right to kill unborn children and packaging it as women’s healthcare because the harsh truth sounds too brutal to say out loud
@CharlesMBlow Then why do minorities demonize all police officers for the actions of a few
@KamalaHarris Reproductive rights or the right to abort your child’s life? No one is trying to “limit women’s healthcare” or their access to it, just the right to kill an unborn baby
@WashTimes Haha at this point he has no choice, all in
@kylegriffin1 Do they understand that all their money still goes to the Donald? So basically they’re saying they’re willing to give trump their money, but they wanna hide that fact
@thehill This is so obviously a political theater show it’s painful!
@RBReich What proposal on the table isn’t socialist?
@pastortraci Are you saying this guy didn’t commit a felony and waste weeks of police resources?
@WashTimes Hahahah what have you done that’s so selfless since his election? What if he wins again, will you please leave then
@Alyssa_Milano Or maybe the face is the serial rapist caught in New Mexico in the country illegally
@nowthisnews @AOC So you’re saying the marijuana licenses should be disproportionately handed out to minorities because they smoke more weed?!thats the basic gist right
@davidhogg111 @RashidaTlaib Hahaha you’re such a wanna be man, you’re a joke, armed officers protecting students will result in death? People will go to prison because they’re being protected. Do you understand what you’re saying kid
@thehill Why do people care what terrible actresses think about politics?
@SenKamalaHarris What do you want to do with the ones who do represent a threat to public safety? Let them go
@RepTimRyan I worked with unions for ten years, they are the laziest most entitled workers in the construction industry, that’s what unions create, entitled lazy workers. Use non-union every chance you get. This is the mindset of all contractors
@RandPaul Is this was a liberal activist attacked by a conservative, it would be ALL OVER every network
@Newsweek All this guy had to do was speak to the police officer like a human being. He obviously committed some minor traffic violation, all he had to do was get out, take his ticket and move on, why does he feel like he is above getting a traffic ticket
@SenKamalaHarris California STOLE federal money for a project that never got off the ground!
@sethmoulton How is it dangerous? Because he questions your awful credibility? He says what the rest of us are already thinking. Is it not more dangerous to question the credibility of your president. Free speech and freedom of the press is not limited to journalists
@AOC @paulkrugman So if people are against raising taxes to fund a socialist agenda, they’re ignorant? If people don’t want universal healthcare and they still want to be able to travel on airplanes to see family, they’re bias and ignorant?
@AOC Doesn’t change the FACT that you helped swipe 25,000 jobs from a city of people who WANTED it, I know the only people you talk to are your little groupies but we wanted this in Queens and you stole it from us for your own political gain, ask normal citizens, we wanted this!!!
@TheToddSchulte And because they broke the law... that too
@nyclawgrrrl Follow simple directions from a police officer trying to do his job and your little political theater attention grab would’ve never happened
@ZachMontellaro Endorsements might be the most fruitless, dumbest, most meaningless thing we talk about during elections. They do absolutely NOTHING for candidates
@CarlaRK3 @AP Oh so NOW you wanna wait till the facts come out? What about when the story first broke? Did you give his trump supporting assailants the same benefit of the doubt
@braxtonryn @AP How about every single person who tried to stir the race wars before a single ridiculous fact from this “incident” came out
@RashidaTlaib @shaunking Yes Americans are all for it, until they realize how much it raises taxes, then not so much
@MahemMistressof @NBCNews Ok where do I start? Are you suggesting there are more illegal Canadians in America then people from South America? And secondly, are you trying to say that stopping flights in and out of the country is a possibility? This is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen honestly
@NBCNews How is criticizing journalists equated to putting their lives at risk but you can criticize politicians and not take blame for putting THEIR lives at risk
@SassyMamainLA How the heck did you see it already?!?!
@NBCNews No one wants to eliminate immigrants!!! They want to eliminate ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION!!!
@washingtonpost When all else fails, cry racism... rule 1 from the liberal playbook
@AOC Enemy of the people
@KamalaHarris So you refuse to wait for an investigation with kavenaugh before finding him guilty all on your own and now you refuse to comment on Jussie till all the facts come out Hahahaha egg on the face democrats, gotta love em
@AOC I have not spoken to a single New Yorker who doesn’t think you absolutely botched this, you should get away from your bubbly post adolescent fan girls once in a while and talk to real New Yorkers
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking There will always be players, im not talking about fantasy situations here I’m talking about real world situations, I also have no idea what the hell a bot is, I’m guessing it’s some sort of twitter thing, I just got an account like two weeks ago so I’m behind
@Resist1969 @Raquel4Detroit @MsMarySheffield @stephanielily @RepRashida Yeah and that’s all it’s worth
@Raquel4Detroit @MsMarySheffield @stephanielily @RepRashida Why do people have to seek out things to be offended by? Is this really worth you spending the next two days foaming at the mouth for, give it a rest and laugh a little... cue overly offended how dare you you have no idea what we’ve been through response
@jacobsoboroff Then they should also be old enough to buy alcohol and cigarettes
@AOC Then why aren’t people from the US flooding into France and England you bimbo
@MichaelAvenatti This just makes me like tucker Carlson more man
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking You’re wrong, because if every single one of the top 50 college players left to play overseas, the next best players would take their spots and Duke and UK wouldn’t skip a beat, every game is still sold out and every jersey still purchased
@Angola_Maldives @LeftSentThis @shaunking Redistributing? You’re not even going to try and hide your communism?
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking Therefore, these guys getting paid nothing but a scholarship is capitalism because that is what they’re worth, they’re in and out in 2 years, why pay them a dime, just to be good guys? Because it’s the right thing to do? Sounds pretty socialist
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking Maybe their ticket prices wouldn’t go for as much money but ticket prices are such a minimal part of the equation next merchandising and advertising and duke has been duke long before Zion Williamson
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking People don’t root for the player, they root for the jersey and the school, if Zion Williamson left to go play in China, duke would still be the most popular team in the country, they would still be able to recruit the best players, therefore his value is minimal
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking These guys creates this market and it’s working, these guys are not professionals, they’re amateurs and students... if they want to be professionals then they should start going en masse to play overseas
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking The only factor here is super rich college board members are making a ton of money, they’re not going to give up that power or that money, sure there’s an argument every few years that these guys should get paid but I think most people think they shouldn’t, me not included btw
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking I do not but you’re subtly and unnecessarily hinting at that as the issue which is dumb because these have been the rules since college athletes were mostly white
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking Ok but the NFL has a salary cap so these guys are going to be getting paid more in college then when they go pro, I’m all for the payment of the athlete but it raises issues, and I see where you’re going with this, please just shut up with the race bull crap it’s a tired act
@Angola_Maldives @LeftSentThis @shaunking Wow you’re so woke man thank God for white guys like you, what an inspiration you are for attacking racism on the internet, such a hero
@sleeponice @LeftSentThis @shaunking There’s just a lot of questions like salary cap, would it cause the scales to dip even worse towards schools like duke or Alabama, I’m all for them getting paid it’s just such a tricky thing to start
@5fifthsgeezer @LeftSentThis @shaunking Salary cap or what?
@Angola_Maldives @LeftSentThis @shaunking Jesus does everything have to be about race for Gods sake, I’m just curious as to what the salary range would be
@washingtonpost What does racism have to do with ANY of this
@LeftSentThis @shaunking What do you think the proper salary for a college athlete would be? Obviously it would have to be the same for every player otherwise every top ten player would just go to the schools with the most money
@nowthisnews @AOC IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENTS JOB TO CONTROL WHAT RACE STARTS WHAT BUSINESS!!!! It’s a free market you ridiculous bimbo! No one is denying the applications of minorities! This is textbook communist overreaching
@JStein_WaPo Capitalism baby... Gods way of determining who is smart and who is poor... socialism will never work bern bros
@thehill This is the only Democrat who is worthy to run a country. She’s reasonable, smart, willing to compromise. Every other candidate is going to run so far to the left they’re going to leave every single moderate Democrat behind
@RBReich All of those programs are socialist programs you fool, were calling people socialists who want to take away airplanes and hand out jobs to people who don’t wanna work
@DocMellyMel @shaunking @BernieSanders Yes yes we know you’re a victim you poor thing, you should continue to feel sorry for yourself, I’m sure it’ll help the situation
@neeratanden @Yamiche Yes yes we know you’re a victim, poor you
@thehill This woman is the most obviously self serving sanctimonious annoying human being on the planet. Who loses a a fight and then spends the remainder of their career complaining about the refs besides democrats
@delawareonline Don’t be a scumbag and resist arrest and this won’t happen period... follow the law... sidenote if this kid was black it would be on every news station
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK If these are national emergencies then why didn’t Democrats call for a declaration of emergency months ago for any of these issues
@AOC Are we really at the point where we’re confusing CNN of playing favorites with the pro Trump crowd
@elisafayemakes Whatever you say Bernie bro, be more sensitive next time please the world doesn’t have enough political correctness
@NBCNews Another absolute scumbag whose going to be painted as a hero all around the country, don’t do drugs and carry illegal guns and you won’t get shot, pretty simple formula for success, some people just can’t help themselves
@AOC But you did say those idiotic things and they didn’t make any sense... are you gonna pull a trump here and say that you didn’t say it
@AOC Correct, you do not
@DLHughleyRadio @RealDLHughley Ali was the best of all time, Kap is a below average QB with all the baggage in the world, he’s just like tebow
@RAICESTEXAS @shaunking That’s the same as saying people are going to do heroin anyway, we should just give it to them and make it clean and safe
@RAICESTEXAS @shaunking And your solution is to have open borders so it’s super easy for the sick and criminal to come here instead of being a country with laws
@USATODAY @shaunking How is border patrol responsible for irresponsible people traveling to a new country when they’re not physically capable and risking their lives and their children’s? Did someone force this person to come here and stay at the border while in need of medical attention?
@washingtonpost Wow bombshell of the century post
@MichaelAvenatti @SebGorka You do understand the nazis are a leftist group right
@shaunking Please comment on Jussie you insufferable hypocrite, you’ve already lost all your credibility
@cameron_kasky This is one of the dumbest most amateur posts I’ve seen over and over again, anti vaxxers are definitely worth declaring a national emergency hahah what a joke
@SenWarren Please list one achievement of the Obama presidency
@KamalaHarris The right to bear arms was made to defend us against a tyrannical government, how do you expect citizens to defend themselves against a government controlled military if you take all of our weapons
@shaunking You really don’t wanna get into voter fraud if you’re a democrat, also where the hell is your statement on Jussie dumbass
@MichaelAvenatti You are literally the only person with the stones to come out and say something like this... everyone else, radio silence, don’t always agree with you but at least you have some integrity
@thehill Is that why the investigation has taken two years
@washingtonpost One person doesn’t make the president wrong
@KamalaHarris Jussie Smollett..... please comment
@MichaelAvenatti I hear what you’re saying man and ingraham is a lunatic, but please dont mention swetnick again, she destroys your credibility and you don’t deserve that
@AJentleson @shaunking Is this really all you have to say king, how about you apologize like a man for jumping all over this and cramming narratives down our throats that you want so badly to be true so that you can still have a job
@thehill It’s about our rights as Americans given to us by the founders of this great country
@SenatorMenendez When are you going to realize that your message is old, stale, and falling in deaf ears. You’ve lost whatever punch you had, you should retire sir you’re just being ignored at this point
@MichaelAvenatti You are the first person to make a comment like this and it’s very appreciated... every other person who jumped on this has not been heard from since, at least you have the stones to come out and say what needed to be said
@staceyabrams You do understand how self serving all your statements and work are right? You’re a joke, people are laughing at you
@NBCLatino @Nicolemarie_A @PhilMcCausland @AOC @RepAOC She doesn’t have an old Bronx neighborhood she’s from westchester
@shaunking Should we find out where Obama was after he declared his 5 states of emergencies to help OTHER countries, TRUMP IS TRYING TO HELP AMERICA!!! Buck up white boy
@shaunking Jussie, please comment
@shaunking Jussie
@DebraMessing Why would anyone listen to you, someone whose job it is to fake emotions and play make believe, not to mention how terrible you are at it, and trust you about politics, please just stay out of it, you’re over your head, you’re a random clueless actress, no one cares what u think
@theappeal @shaunking Do you really think this is about race? You think they selectively choose their cash seizures. THY ARE CALLED LAWS!!! The law dictates whose assets get taken you fools
@shaunking @Kaepernick7 @NFL No one cares if you’re watching or not, you’re one middle aged white guy, no one needs your viewing
@shaunking I love how you select your narratives, if this was a white man who shot the place up you’d be saying white males with guns are the biggest terrorists in America, you conveniently avoid this narrative now that it doesn’t fit this story, you’re so obviously awful at your job
@thehill This woman hates trump@what the hell are you talking about
@MichaelAvenatti @kellznation Avenatti you realize that when you respond to this petty stuff, you unmask yourself as the small petty pathetic wanna-be porn lawyer that we all know you to be... you’re sad
@KamalaHarris Ask veterans at the VA how their government run healthcare is going. Ask them how efficient it is
@BernieSanders Those countries are not AMERICA!! We are better because of one word... CAPITALISM bernie
@shaunking Are you going to talk about the completely staged Jussie attack that you were all over, apologies for your stupidity will be taken whenever you get a minute, another manufactured racist incident
@shaunking @Kaepernick7 @NFL It’s an admission of nothing, you know how settlements work don’t be obtuse, it’s their way of saying shut up and go away, we made billions of dollars last year, take 70 million and go away you’re annoying
@NormOrnstein The 25th amendment is for sick and dying presidents, don’t talk about how trump is spitting on the Constitution with this national emergency and then talk about using the 25th amendment to remove a president you disagree with
@RepMaxineWaters Democrats cannot speak about respecting the Constitution and gun control in the same breath, you sound insane
@AOC No you’re totally right, eliminating 25,000$ middle class jobs really is the best thing you could’ve done for the middle class, you’re our hero
@SenSanders Don’t talk about the Constitution like you respect it and then in the same breath talk about gun control
@Acosta Weren’t you the one who said no one in the caravan was trying to cross illegally? That was you right? Aren’t you the one making stuff up
@ChrisMurphyCT Good luck coming to get our guns, there will be a revolution so fast in this country it’ll make your spin there murph
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump As a member of the military, please don’t ever use us as a tool for you. I am based in Hawaii and I can say with confidence then military people hate you more than any politician on the globe, your stupidity is epic, you’re in over your head and you embarrass us, you’re pathetic
@DrugPolicyOrg @AOC Correct genius, the drug dealers are not also legitimate businessmen with the financial wherewithal to open a major venture. You know why? They’re scumbags who broke the law. Now you want to reward them with their own stores haha? Because they smoked more pot then white people?
@shaunking They’re giving him some cash just so he shuts his mouth, stops complaining, and goes away finally. He’ll never play football again, and now the NFL doesn’t have to deal with him or his obnoxious lawyers anymore. Even if they gave him 100 million, thats peanuts for them
@MartinHeinrich We do want it, every single person I’ve spoken to here in NJ wants it, you’re out of touch
@beinlibertarian However dam much you make yourself worth, if you have no skill, you don’t deserve to make a living
@thehill All liberals do is berate Donald trumps appearance! More democrats and double standards, they never stoo
@RBReich Correct
@DebraMessing @nbc @SeanHayes Debra messing is a disgusting cow in over her head every time she opens her mouth... hows that
@DebraMessing Unless you trust your politicians now and forever to remain unbiased and void of serious dangerous corruption that could endanger the rights of all Americans bestowed on us by God and our founding fathers, then the debate on gun control is OVER!!
@BarackObama @MichelleObama She ain’t no Melania that’s for sure
@SenatorMenendez @DSenFloor Wow such an original thought! It’s not like hasn’t been multiple years long investigations already, all of them completely clearing him of collusion. But you probably have exclusive information and facts right
@TalbertSwan So now being a Christian makes you a white supremacist hahaha you understand how insane that sounds right, especially considering that most blacks are Christian and the overwhelming majority of Hispanics being Catholic. You are reaching so far it’s laughable
@RepCardenas So we should hand out wins to people who didn’t earn them to teach kids a lesson? Is this really what you wanna teach the youth? That you can win awards solely based on the color of your skin? How about the best awards go to the best artists, easy day
@theappeal @shaunking So you’re mad when they shoot and now you’re mad when they use tasers? What should they do then? Just yell very loudly, you think that will calm down people who refuse to cooperate with law enforcement
@VoiceDemocrat @StandardFifty @SarahClapp @realDonaldTrump Crumble and fail? Lowest ever black unemployment, lowest ever Hispanic unemployment, lowest female unemployment in 60 years, Korean is war is over, ISIS wiped off the map and the economy is booming! Please explain to me where he’s failing! He’s got 6 more years to get the wall
@SarahClapp @realDonaldTrump If you knew ANYTHING you’d know that filing bankruptcy doesn’t mean you’re broke, he’s insanely rich and he’s the leader of the free world, I’d say he’s doing just fine, you wish you could have his financial setup
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump So California politicians are the real caring ones huh? They’re the righteous right? Not just the left wing morons who want to abolish air travel and cows
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Shut up with your 7 tweet explanations, they’re annoying and you say nothing that everyone doesn’t know already, being a doctor doesn’t make you smart in every other arena, in fact you’re quite dumb when it comes to other subjects obviously
@shaunking @IlhanMN Everything this woman does is for attention. Her motives are completely selfish. She’s serving no ones interests but her own. It may come across is righteous but it is anything but
@hatsbywill @shaunking Sick lunatics
@lsarsour Excuses excuses excuses, gotta love democrats
@DanRiffle For all you morons talking about socialism like it’s no big deal, take a look at EVERY single true socialist country that has EVER existed and tell me that’s what you want America to look like, we can survive one bad president but we cannot survive socialism
@staceyabrams Did you really just use that platform to complain about losing AGAIN?! You LOSTT! It’s done!! Get over it Hilary
@shaunking Ignorance is not an excuse to break the law white boy
@IlhanMN You’re going to be playing the victim card till the day you die aren’t you? What a tired annoying human being you are
@SenKamalaHarris Everything she said makes total sense, it’s like saying I avoid going into a dark alley at night and then saying are you saying people who walk through a dark alley deserve to be assaulted?
@MichaelAvenatti @StormyDaniels What the hell did stormy Daniels put in motion exactly? And please spare us the encouraging of women to come forward and all your coated phony lawyer language
@IlhanMN You think infanticide is messing with a woman’s body?
@JamilSmith Are people trying to take black people away from their homes and take away their votes? I wasn’t aware this was going on
@MichaelAvenatti @TMZ You are not a threat to anyone little man
@MichaelAvenatti That was actually pretty funny, nice work on that one
@Bakari_Sellers Sandra bland committed suicide
@DMogahed @IlhanMN Because of the ridiculous rhetoric she spews that’s radical foramy American, she is an outright socialist, that’s why, her religion or skin color is not what makes her un American, her ideas do
@eraser48 @shaunking @TheNorthStar I seriously can’t believe this guy is still making money pretending to be black, how is no one else questioning this? Rachel dolezal was also so good things for people of color and she got crucified, this guy is doing the EXACT same thing!!
@shaunking @TheNorthStar Can you be any whiter? I can’t believe you still have people fooled that you’re actually black, what a fraud
@shaunking @TheNorthStar Question... are you going to retract what you said last week about white male domestic terrorists and how they are our biggest threat since that dumb kid was proven to be a disgruntled teen at his girlfriends family and absolutely nothing terrorist related?
@rolandsmartin What exactly would black news include?
@IlhanMN @Ilhan And became quite literally the most hated member of our government and revealing yourself to be the most uninformed out of your league child
@shaunking Do you understand the definition of terrorism? This idiot as well as the few immigrants who commit rape or murder are NOT terrorists! Stop using these words to incite a response, anyone with a brain sees right through it
@IlhanMN You really are just so out of your league in this government, it’s scary that you actually represent American interests in Congress, you sound like a college freshman who hasn’t opened her first poli sci book yet
