Why is it every time I turn around I see a Democrat promoting the same actions as what Adolf Hitler death 1934 in Austria. When he took a nation without a shot. Wake up people look at history and you'll see the master plan.
@SenFeinstein Maybe you should give up yours after all isn't senility a mental condition. And aren't people with mental conditions not supposed to have firearms? I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt the people's response. From my cold dead hand.
@SenFeinstein @AGBecerra Like you said you've been a senator for over  30 years. I'm of the opinion you have lost touch with your base. Take a month off and be around the people. You will learn more then a report tells you. Or retire ms Hitler Austria 1934 same tactics he used

@SenFeinstein Can't handle bad media so I'll put this statement out and make myself look better. I seen what you said to the kids you were wrong. They are our future they don't need to be worried about things like this. Step up and do your job once you were hired to do
@SenKamalaHarris goes back to the old philosophy if you want to play the game you need to be ready to pay the price. and besides if they don't want the kid there's always adoption agencies. Give those who can't have a chance.#adoptachild
@SenFeinstein Do you remember what the Austria people were told back in 1934. You sound like the same dictator that did that. Adolf Hitler is he one of your relatives you're sure as heck used his tactics
@SenFeinstein why did you block a bill that would report to ice every time in illegal attempted to purchase a firearm? Aren't you against potential gun violence? Obviously only if you believe it will be committed buy an American legal citizen. Way to go Diane
@SenFeinstein In other words you're doing your job for mr. George Soros who makes 1.6 billion dollars a month off the global warming scam. Good job Diane keep feeding his coffers how much is he paying you?

@SenFeinstein @HouseJudiciary Why cannot people get it through their heads criminals don't care about laws. All you're going to get with is the new gun control laws is more victims. Enforce the laws you already have go after the black market. Leave law-abiding citizens alone.

@SenFeinstein Well maybe he should have been mean and not give you a chance do the right thing. Long-term correction versus right now. And don't forget George soros's Caravan is on its way
@SenKamalaHarris Do not be fooled my friend. Actions like this will not help the American people. This senator does not understand the concept criminals are called criminals for a reason. You can create all the laws you want only effect will be creating more victims out of the American people
@SenFeinstein You really expect us to fall for this crap? The American people are not stupid we know the truth. If you bozos would get up off your butts and do your jobs as you were hired to do as employees of the American people. A lot of these problems wouldn't exist. Do your job employee
@realDonaldTrump They've been pumping this Russian collusion stuff well over 2 years. Only question it makes me ask is what don't they want us to pay attention to? Easiest way to hide something is in plain sight.

@SenFeinstein Are you insane? California Chicago New York have the strongest gun control laws in the nation. They also have the highest crime rates in the nation. I hate to see the future and how many people you are going to get killed because you're an idiot. Please don't push the people
@SenFeinstein All you need to do is propose a bill that guarantees their pay no matter the condition of the government. Simple. But I know how much Nancy Pelosi wanted to go on vacation instead of negotiating

Here's a few questions for the masses. How much ammunition do you use in training and practicing with your firearm? Why do you train and practice? What is the objective in owning a firearm if you don't practice with it?
@Jilchrest You go through a lot of ammunition during your training process. Minimal 1000 rounds just a cure adequate training. You practice two to three times a month to maintain and accuracy with your firearm. All this so no innocent bystander is hit by your round. 3000 rounds per month
@SenFeinstein This just goes to prove you are insane in the membrane. Only law-abiding citizens are affected by legislation criminals don't care. You need to leave us alone. It's almost as if you were getting paid to turn us into victims. Makes you say curious things here.
@SenFeinstein And how much did Barack Obama spend during his presidency. All them 2 plane vacations couldn't even travel with his wife.
@SenFeinstein Secure the Border make acts like this have value. She came back the legal way. Secure the Border don't belittle what she has accomplished.
@SenFeinstein You are just having too much fun going up against law abiding citizen. There's a easy target for you. Why don't you try going after criminal. Instead of creating new victim for the criminal. And decreasing our national security and the people's capability of defending our home.

@SenFeinstein You are partly right skilled operators are effective but a wall forces potential Smugglers into a small area versus it open run. Just like the wall around here place forces people to enter at your Port of Entry. You don't like border wall take down your property wall
@LindseyGrahamSC How did CNN know when to be there where they tipped off? Seen that his wife's condition was well-documented why weren't precautions taken for her? Last question why were cases similar to this indictment handled the same way?
@SenFeinstein The only thing you're upset about is the court you use against the White House is no longer your weapon it has become Fair

@SenFeinstein @ASM_Irwin @laurafriedman43 @AsmShirleyWeber @Ash_Kalra @AsmMoniqueLimon @AsmEdChau @Rendon63rd Take out Sanctuary States status. Deport illegals. Increase jobs for legal immigrants and legal citizens. Increase income taxes paid in that way. Increase people covered by Health Care that way. Illegals don't pay they only take and send back to Mexico or where they come from.
@SenFeinstein If you attempt to ban firearms you only remove firearms from law-abiding citizens. No matter the law the criminals will always obtain their firearms. By disarming law-abiding citizens you create more victims.
@SenFeinstein https://t.co/QS1PAI7Hb6		Truth here
@SenFeinstein In the compromise present from offered was the funds that would have prevented this. You dropped the ball. Time to retire Diane and maybe find a citizen who truly cares and understands. That's why senators and congressman were supposed to go home work a job and know the people
@SenFeinstein You had your chance to stop it and you blew it I watch the votes.
@SenFeinstein They have been preaching global warming for almost a hundred years. Washington Post 1923 November 11th Washington Post 1995 September 8th same figures same article all them years parts. Think now pole shift Theory Ring of Fire increased seismic activity it's happened before

RT @ingineer66: @SenFeinstein Then take up the bill the Dems defeated in the House to pay the employees.
@SenFeinstein I couldn't agree more. Easy solution and you already agreed to it 4 years ago. When the Democrat Party was calling for the wall. Quit making it political and fund the dang thing. You wanted it when Barack Obama was in office and are only fighting it because Donald Trump's there.
@SenFeinstein And as it's been taking today it means to the kids today go out and have sex with his many partners as you can and if you get pregnant don't worry the government up a for your abortion. No longer teaches taking responsibility for the decisions you make.

Ain't it funny during Barack Obama's term as president we did not have nearly as much violence going on as we do now during Donald Trump's. I guess it does mean Democrats are more violent than Republicans.
What ever happened to taking responsibility for making decisions? I was always taught if you play the game you pay the price. Why should I pay for somebody else's bad decision?
@SenFeinstein Here's a question. Isn't Liberty the whole thing behind having the right to make decisions. But also isn't it the right of the taxpayer not to have to pay for somebody else and their decisions they made while using their Liberty?
@dwtalk @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I see a lot of Republican bills that were stopped to
@dwtalk @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ORBIhxcUbc		Introduced by who
@SenFeinstein Yes Dianne Feinstein you must be proud federally regulated to $15 an hour you increase the probability of places like McDonald's going to kiosk and firing employees. You caused layoffs and increase unemployment. Less government more freedom.
People need to check their facts before they complain about something. Funding for DACA was ended well house Democrats and a few Republicans refused to fund it.
@dwtalk @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Please refer to https://t.co/uy6ALXXu19 you will notice that it was House and Senate Democrats that voted down funding for DACA the president does not have the authority to end funding the house has that power. Please check the voting roll call on that thank you
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Increase and time so that Congress can pass proper legislation for DACA recipients funds for humanitarian Aid for people at the border but yet he says it offers nothing. Isn't that what Democrats wanted in the first place. Obviously you didn't listen idiot

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Keep up the good work. I would rather suffer for a little while then lose my country to a bunch of socialists globalist idiots. Unleash the machine capitalism it's what Built This Nation and will save the Nation again.

Who do these politicians think they are fooling. Speaking tactically wall made of metal put in ground connected to a seismograph equals 2 anti tunneling anti border cross. Can be utilized as a early warning setup. Ancient technology meets modern twist.
@SenFeinstein Metal rides of Border fence connected to seismograph guess what you get tunneling detection equipment. Dual-purpose the wall install and utilize. Very old technique with a modern twist.

@yvotesmatter @SenFeinstein Oh I realize walls are not perfect. But they still can reduce Manpower necessity. Utilizing seismic detection alongside the wall would increase the effectiveness immensely. That agents can focus on the ports of entry and detecting those who are paid off not to notice
@SenFeinstein The law is written very clearly only if you are a naturalized citizen or a citizen by birth are you allowed to vote within a u.s. election. You want the illegals 2 count towards that to increase your probability of keeping your job
@SenFeinstein Until the report is finally released those who judge are judging without all the facts. Is this nation innocent until proven guilty or is it guilty until proven innocent.

@SenFeinstein Sometimes reverting back to the basics solve a problem better. Wall equals more concentration of people instead of having spent over a hundred miles they're able to do their job better in that small area. And also can catch the ones being bought easier. Think about it

@SenFeinstein In order to conquer a nation you must utilize the force of emotional response because the citizens of that Nation sacrifice their liberties for the falsehood promises of governmental securities.
