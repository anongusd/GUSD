@ad81109 You are a true national hero. Thank you.
@GrammaticalFict @MaddowBlog @neal_katyal You are welcome. And, if you haven't listened to her podcast, "Bag Man", you should.
@GrammaticalFict @MaddowBlog @neal_katyal She did do a fairly deep dive into it. It all came from the investigations into Agnew. The question was whether or not a sitting vice president could be indicted. The caveat that a sitting president could not be, was sort of an aside to that decision.
@TankSchottle Good luck, Tank.
@GrammaticalFict @MaddowBlog @neal_katyal Rachel did a segment on this sometime in the last couple of weeks.

@WDBJ7 Are you kidding me? Do your homework. Presidents Day was created to combine the birthday celebrations of Washington and Lincoln. It is not to honor Trump. I'd hate to have to stop watching WDBJ7. Most of my favorite shows are there.
@Pommiek @BillKristol Exactly. For a moment, I thought he had finally grown a pair.
@ad81109 I am so sorry you are tired. Please know that you are appreciated by many of us who aren't near enough to honk our horns.	Please take care of yourself. You are a treasure.
@TankSchottle @lizbuddie You are such an inspiration, Tank. Thank you.
@kcroatt @kylegriffin1 Exactly. It is better to get no refund  or even owe a little, than to let the government have your money interest-free throughout the year. People just don't understand that.
This man is such an inspiration to so many of us. https://t.co/HL6txXnQiX
@TankSchottle Great job, Tank.
@RepMikeQuigley So very sorry for your loss. I will keep you in my thoughts as you adjust to a life without him.
@mrs_g_rider Thank you.
@ceceyy @DannyDeraney @kasie @GeoffRBennett @jonallendc None if these offenses were known before the primaries or elections.
@mrs_g_rider As a Virginian, this makes me sad. I promise we aren't all that way.
@DannyDeraney @kasie @GeoffRBennett @jonallendc Please don't judge all of us who are Virginians by these despicable actions from a few.
@TankSchottle Have a great day, Tank.
@TankSchottle Good luck, Tank. 	All the best to you.

@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Why is this something the President of the United States should be concerned with? Aren't there more important things for you to be thinking about? Asking for millions of Americans.
@SaltyWorley @SenDuckworth I should have been more clear. Let me clarify. When will the Republican Senators join the Democrats and demand that McConnell bring the bills, that have already passed in the House, to the floor?
@HoarseWisperer @SenatorRomney @POTUS This disappoints me greatly.
@SenDuckworth Amen! When will the Senate, as a whole, demand that he bring bills to the floor.
@67LuckyJim @kharyp That's the question I have. As a former teacher, I would have shut this behavior down as soon as it started. Shameful!

@Jestbill @Sustain_Joy @BrennanCenter I understand that there is software that may be vulnerable. But I'm not sure why that's the easiest to hack. Does the hack take place before the machine is shipped or after?
@smilon713 @blueslz @BrennanCenter Thanks for the info.
@BrennanCenter In our Precinct in Virginia, voters hand mark a ballot that is then scanned into a machine. The machine is never connected to the internet. What is the problem with that?
@CBSSunday My mother never ever said that there was no Santa. Instead, we read the Dear Virginia letter every year.

@JessTurnerCRU @bcjvt @washingtonpost I'm not sure. I haven't worked the census for several decades. It takes a very long time for all of the census forms to be returned and complete.
@JessTurnerCRU @bcjvt @washingtonpost The census is taken every 10 years.
@JessTurnerCRU @bcjvt @washingtonpost Are you living on your own in 2010, or were you included in someone else's household? If it is the latter, you would not have gotten one.
@Typakil @SamKleinOnline @washingtonpost No. It is used to count the population, citizen or not. The census is used to determine the needs of a community.

@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow Who are these people that vote for such a man?
@JustMyStyle101 @MSNBC Surely you don't really believe that.
@savageshark @charlie_adler @george_capen @realDonaldTrump The paper towels were thrown in Puerto Rico where they still need more help.

@floramcg7 @kurteichenwald So very sorry this happened to you. I certainly understand the many reasons people don't come forward at the time of their sexual assaults.
@gelles @CNNPolitics OMG! Despicable.
@Newsweek Funny how they didn't come up with this claim at the time.
@CFTpersonal @thehill Are you kidding me? Whether he intended it as a joke or not, it was an inappropriate comment. Every time he does something like this he has people like you throwing out the " It was a joke" defense. That just doesn't fly.

@Chiefchuck24 @ChrisMurphyCT @chrislhayes Sigh. You obviously don't know any teachers very well or you would not be dragging out the old "teachers get 3 months off" argument.
@HoarseWisperer He won't quit for exactly that reason. As long as he is in office, there is a question of whether he can be indicted. If he leaves, it will be kicking and screaming, not because he chose to.
@MarineIntellig1 @Top_Sergeant @seunder0409 @realDonaldTrump Priceless! Gotta love Eleanor quotes.
@Chiefchuck24 @ChrisMurphyCT @chrislhayes When do you think teachers are going to have time for that rigorous training, Chuck? Are you one of those that thinks that teachers have the whole summer off? Most of their summer is spent teaching or doing professional development that is required to keep their certification.
@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you!
@samlucasss My sincere condolences to you and all who loved your cousin, Mollie. It makes my blood boil to see her death used as political propaganda. Thank you for your wisdom in knowing this tragedy was caused by one person, not by a whole specific subgroup of people.

@ASUToolman @abefuelling @T_PartyTrucking @glennbeck I think you missed my point. I was certainly not using race as a "non valid excuse". 	I was simply trying to point out that their are classes of people who are protected, by law, against discrimination. Sarah's behaviors do not make her a member of such a class.

@leesantana1234 @AltNatSecAgency @realDonaldTrump @AIVD It saddens me that you are so ill-informed.
@AltNatSecAgency @realDonaldTrump @AIVD I love that they conveniently leave out the fact that Fusion was originally paid by Republicans.
@Comey Thank you, Mr. Comey.

@MarkWarner @timkaine Bravo, Senators. Proud to have you representing me.
@ezraklein I didn't read the article. Do they figure overhead, labor cost, etc. into the price of those meals? The cost isn't just the food alone.
@timkaine What will you do, sir? I am glad to be one of your constituents. But, I am so tired of all talk and no getting anything done.
@MattMcGorry Excellent points. Thank you for sharing them.
@WendySiegelman What about the sanctions Congress voted for and Trump has yet to put into place?
@wsls Not unless courses in other religions were offered, as well.
@TomCottonAR Why not a CLEAN DACA bill. Senator?
@TheEllenShow I am so sorry for your loss. I will keep you, and all who loved him, in my thoughts and prayers as you adjust to a life without your dear daddy.
@KatzOnEarth @RichLowry Thank you for this excellent history lesson.
@Tinuveil @pattonoswalt @TheGoldbergsABC I managed a Ground Round in the early 80s. Fun times.

@SenateMajLdr We need a CLEAN DACA bill. Are you willing to do that, Senator? Or are you going to hold it hostage to get other unpopular  things passed?

@CREWcrew Does this position not require Congressional approval?
@AP So very sorry to hear this news.
@Reuters If only this "business man" had some clue about competitive pricing and how that works. Sigh.
@CNN Interesting fact - if you look at the entire ballot, you will see that this voters choice for Gillespie as governor, has an X through it. So, does that mean the voter didn't mean to vote for him?
@TIME Oh no! Somebody please tell me this isn't so.
@VanetaMcA Nikki Haley can give you directions.
@hardball @shelly_simonds Overvotes, not overcomes. Auto-correct is not my friend.
@hardball @shelly_simonds I agree. Look at the ballot and the governor's box. If one is going to say the mark through shows the vote wasn't intended for her, did they also invalidate the Gillespie vote?	The rules are pretty clear - overcomes don't count.
@jamiedupree Thanks so much for this information, Jamie.
@Newsweek I agree that this is a terribly misleading headline. You can surely do better @Newsweek
@EdgarOfTheMoors @VanetaMcA @FoxNews I hope all of you who are leaving these businesses, for insisting to show Fox, are letting them know why they are losing your business.  Otherwise, they will be clueless and not as likely to change..

@rubenvega1941 @IndivisRichmond @TangoMango5607 In Virginia, voters cast a paper ballot that is then scanned and recorded. No need to count the ballots individually. But, the paper trail is there in case of a challenge. IMHO it is the best of both worlds.

@realDonaldTrump So, if you can't repeal the ACA, you'll just sabotage it? Despicable.

@realDonaldTrump @VP @SecondLady That was a pretty expensive publicity stunt. Oh, I forget, it doesn't matter because it's the taxpayers money.
@faeywrld1 @usaresistanceR1 @dixiecrl7 @ASlavitt @RepGoodlatte Sadly, I don't think Goodlatte has any interest in doing the right thing.
@realDonaldTrump Obviously, Trump has been watching the horrible attack ads for Gillespie. They are full of misinformation. Sad so many will believe them.
@CoryUpdate @realDonaldTrump Part of that, if not all, is straight from a Gillespie attack ad of misinformation. Nothing original for Trump when he can steal from others
@CBSNews I suspect "regulation" is the key word here. They will work to avoid a complete ban.

@_tiptoeing_ @CNN Haven't forgotten that, at all. Just hoped he had more sense than endorsing this nightmare of a candidate.
@realDonaldTrump What if it isn't about getting elected, but about what's good for the average, not super rich,  American instead?
@CBSNews It must be Friday.
@CNN Just when I was starting to think George W might not be so horrible, he does this. Gillespie would not be good for Virginia.
@altNOAA Last sentence of the linked article states that this does not apply to people in Puerto Rico.
@KamalaHarris Thank you for posting about this without including a date it should be sent by. Two days before the deadline is not enough time.

@cmclymer Thank you, sir. That is the most clear argument I have heard on this matter.
