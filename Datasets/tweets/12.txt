@RMac18 @karaswisher @finkd @waltmossberg NO RYAN
@karaswisher Yep. And they don‚Äôt have to be wack. Need to figure this out. This whole experience is a problem statement for what we need to fix #karajack
@karaswisher This thread was hard. But we got to learn a ton to fix it. Need to make this feel a lot more cohesive and easier to follow. Was extremely challenging. Thank you for trying it with me. Know it wasn‚Äôt easy. Will consider different formats! #Karajack
@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC Tried to do too much at once. Wasn‚Äôt focused on what our one core strength was: conversation. That lead to really diluted strategy and approach. And a ton of reactiveness. #karajack
@karaswisher I‚Äôm focused on building leadership in both. Not my desire or ambition to be CEO of multiple companies just for the sake of that. I‚Äôm doing everything I can to help both. Effort doesn‚Äôt come down to one person. It‚Äôs a team #karajack
@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC I think it‚Äôs better to spread that responsibility across multiple people. It creates less dependencies and the company gets more options around future leadership #karajack
@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC Focus on conversation earlier. We took too long to get there. Too distracted. #Karajack
@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC True #karajack
@karaswisher @elonmusk @AOC Totally. She‚Äôs mastering the medium #karajack
@karaswisher I‚Äôm moving as fast as I can Kara #karajack
@karaswisher To me personally? I like how @elonmusk uses Twitter. He‚Äôs focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly. I respect that a lot, and all the ups and downs that come with it #karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We ultimately decided we were better off independent. And I‚Äôm happy we did. We‚Äôve made a lot of progress since that point. And we got a lot more focused. Definitely love the idea of opening more to 3rd parties. Not sure what that looks like yet. Twitter is close to a protocol.
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump Always going to experiment with new models. Periscope has super hearts, which allows us to learn about direct contribution. We‚Äôd need to figure out the value exchange on subscription. Has to be really high for us to charge directly #karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We want to be valuable to people daily. Not monthly. It‚Äôs a higher bar for ourselves. Sure, it looks like a smaller absolute number, but the folks we have using Twitter are some of the most influential in the world. They drive conversation. We belevie we can best grow this.
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We should expect a lot more coordination between governments and platforms to address. That would give me confidence. And have some skepticism too. That‚Äôs healthy. The more we can do this work in public and share what we find, the better #karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We shared a retro on 2018 within this country, and tested a lot with the Mexican elections too. Indian elections coming up. In mid-terms we were able to monitor efforts to disrupt both online and offline and able to stop those actions on Twitter. #Karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump I think it‚Äôs more durable to focus on use cases because that allows us to act broader. Likely that these aren‚Äôt isolated cases but things that spread #karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump Our work against automations and coordinated campaigns. Partnering with government agencies to improve communication around threats #karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We have to enforce based on our policy and what people do on our service. And evolve it with the current times. No way I can answer that based on people. Has to be focused on patterns of how people use the technology. #karajack
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt believe our service or business is dependent on any one account or person. I will say the number of politics conversations has significantly increased because of it, but that‚Äôs just one experience on Twitter. There are multiple Twitters, all based on who you follow.
@karaswisher @realDonaldTrump We hold all accounts to the same terms of service. The most controversial aspect of our TOS is the newsworthy/public interest clause, the ‚Äúprotection‚Äù you mention. That doesn‚Äôt extend to all public figures by default, but does speak to global leaders and seeing how they think.
@karaswisher It‚Äôs the reality. We tried to do too much at once and were not focused on what matters most. That contributes to slowness. As does our technology stack and how quickly we can ship things. That‚Äôs improved a lot recently #karajack
@karaswisher We made something with one intent. The world showed us how it wanted to use it. A lot has been great. A lot has been unexpected. A lot has been negative. We weren‚Äôt fast enough to observe, learn, and improve #karajack
@karaswisher I also don‚Äôt feel good about how Twitter tends to incentivize outrage, fast takes, short term thinking, echo chambers, and fragmented conversation and consideration. Are they fixable? I believe we can do a lot to address. And likely have to change more fundamentals to do so.
@karaswisher @finkd I did. I‚Äôd rather be eating cheez-its #karajack
@karaswisher Feels terrible. I want people to walk away from Twitter feeling like they learned something and feeling empowered to some degree. It depresses me when that‚Äôs not the general vibe, and inspires me to figure it out. That‚Äôs my desire #karajack
@karaswisher @finkd @waltmossberg Ok. Definitely not easy to follow the conversation. Exactly why we are doing this. Fixing stuff like this will help I believe. #Karajack
@karaswisher @finkd Does he check this much?
@karaswisher @finkd Just resonded to that. Don‚Äôt see the twitter purge one #karajack
@karaswisher @finkd For instance, we look at probability of abuse from any one account. If someone is abusing one account, likely doing the same elsewhere. We can use that to potentially interstitial. #Karajack
@karaswisher @finkd 1. Misgendering policy as example.	2. Using ML to downrank bad actors behind interstitials	3. Not too long ago, but most of our work going forward will have to be product features.	4. Not sure the question. We put an entire model in place to minimize gaming of system. #Karajack
@karaswisher @finkd 1. We have evolved our polices.	2. We have prioritized proactive enforcement to remove burden from victims	3. We have given more control in product (like mute of accounts without profile pics or associated phone/emails)	4. Much more aggressive on coordinated behavior/gaming
@karaswisher I think it‚Äôs fair and real. No question. Our org has to be reflective of the people we‚Äôre trying to serve. One of the reason we established the Trust and Safety council years ago, to get feedback and check ourselves. #Karajack
@karaswisher @finkd Likely a reason. I‚Äôm certain lack of diversity didn‚Äôt help with empathy of what people experience on Twitter every day, especially women. #Karajack
@karaswisher I think we tried to do too much in the past, and that leads to diluted answers and nothing impactful. There‚Äôs a lot we need to address globally. We have to prioritize our resources according to impact. Otherwise we won‚Äôt make much progress. #Karajack
@karaswisher @finkd I see the link, and that‚Äôs why we need to put physical safety above all else. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre figuring out how to do now. We don‚Äôt have all the answers just yet. But that‚Äôs the focus. I think it clarifies a lot of the work we need to do. Not all of it of course. #Karajack
@karaswisher We action all we can against our policies. Most of our system today works reactively to someone reporting it. If they don‚Äôt report, we don‚Äôt see it. Doesn‚Äôt scale. Hence the need to focus on proactive. #Karajack
@karaswisher Exactly. What can we do within the product and policy to lower probability. Again, don‚Äôt think we or others have worked against that enough. #Karajack
@karaswisher No, not a police force. I mean we have to consider first and foremost what online activity does to impact physical safety, as a way to prioritize our efforts. I don‚Äôt think companies like ours have admitted or focused on that enough. #Karajack
@karaswisher Within the service? Likely within replies. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been more aggressive about proactively downranking behind interstitials, for example.
@karaswisher I mean off platform, offline ramifications. What people do offline with what they see online. Doxxing is a good example which threatens physical safety. So does coordinate harassment campaigns. #Karajack
@karaswisher Good question. This is why we‚Äôre focused on understanding what conversational health means. We see a ton of threats to health in digital conversation. We‚Äôre focuse first on off-platform ramifications (physical safety). That clarifies priorities of policy and enforcement.
@karaswisher This is exactly the balance we have to think deeply about. But in doing so, we have to look at how the product works. And where abuse happens the most: replies, mentions, search, and trends. Those are the shared spaces people take advantage of #karajack
@karaswisher Second, we‚Äôre constantly evolving our policies to address the issues we see today. We‚Äôre rooting them in fundamental human rights (UN) and putting physical safety as our top priority. Privacy next. #Karajack
@karaswisher First and foremost we‚Äôre looking at ways to proactively enforce and promote health. So that reporting/blocking is a last resort. Problem we‚Äôre trying to solve is taking that work away. #Karajack
@karaswisher Agree it matters a lot. And it‚Äôs the most important thing we need to address and fix. I‚Äôm stating that it‚Äôs a fail of ours to put the majority of burden on victims. That‚Äôs how the service works today. #Karajack
@karaswisher Putting the burden on victims? Yes. It‚Äôs recognizing that we have to be proactive in enforcement and promotion of healthy conversation. This is our first priority in #health. We have to change a lot of the fundamentals of product to fix.
@karaswisher Myself? C. We‚Äôve made progress, but it has been scattered and not felt enough. Changing the experience hasn‚Äôt been meaningful enough. And we‚Äôve put most of the burden on the victims of abuse (that‚Äôs a huge fail). #Karajack
@karaswisher A question we ask ourselves all the time. In the past I think we were trying to do too much. We‚Äôre better at prioritizing by impact now. Believe the #1 thing we should focus on is someone‚Äôs physical safety first. That one statement leads to a lot of ramifications. #Karajack
@karaswisher Ready
@karaswisher To be clear, we‚Äôre interested in an experience like this. Nothing built yet. This gives us a sense of what it would be like, and what we‚Äôd need to focus on. If there‚Äôs something here at all!

Will keep following the conversation and sharing what I learn here. üôèüèº
We know we can‚Äôt do this alone, and continue to welcome conversation with and help from civil society and NGOs within the region. I had no conversations with the government or NGOs during my trip. We‚Äôre always open to feedback on how to best improve.
Twitter is a way for people to share news and information about events in Myanmar as well as to bear witness to the plight of the Rohingya and other peoples and communities. We‚Äôre actively working to address emerging issues. This includes violent extremism and hateful conduct.
This was a purely personal trip for me focused on only one dimension: meditation practice. That said, I know people are asking about what Twitter is doing around the situation, so I‚Äôll share our current state.
I‚Äôm aware of the human rights atrocities and suffering in Myanmar. I don‚Äôt view visiting, practicing, or talking with the people, as endorsement. I didn‚Äôt intend to diminish by not raising the issue, but could have acknowledged that I don‚Äôt know enough and need to learn more.
I took this time with a singular objective of working on myself. I shared my experience with the world with the singular objective of encouraging others to consider a similar practice. Simply because it‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve found to help me every day.
* more color on this given the resulting conversation.		I‚Äôve been meditating for 20 years, with the last 2 years focused on vipassana. After experiencing it in Texas last year, I wanted to go to the region that maintained the practice in its original form. That led me to Myanmar.

And if you‚Äôre willing to travel a bit, go to Myanmar: https://t.co/9qKm78uq7o
Vipassana is not for everyone, but if any of this resonates with you even in the slightest, I‚Äôd encourage you to give it a try. If in the US, this center in Texas is a great start: https://t.co/4Brke5RU85
I also wore my Apple Watch and Oura ring, both in airplane mode. My best meditations always had the least variation in heart rate. When I wasn‚Äôt focused, it would jump around a lot. Here‚Äôs a night of sleep on the 10th night (my resting heart rate was consistently below 40). https://t.co/9fiz8s8DR5
We also meditated in a cave in Mandalay one evening. In the first 10 minutes I got bit 117 times by mosquitoes ü¶ü  They left me alone when the light blew a fuse, which you can see in my heart rate lowering. https://t.co/rz59Wx9yHF
The highlight of my trip was serving monks and nuns food, and donating sandals and umbrellas. This group of young nuns in Mandalay and their chanting was breathtaking and chilling. https://t.co/E2nHFOsHu2
Myanmar is an absolutely beautiful country. The people are full of joy and the food is amazing. I visited the cities of Yangon, Mandalay, and Bagan. We visited and meditated at many monasteries around the country. https://t.co/wMp3cmkfwi
On day 11, all I wanted to do was listen to music, and I again turned to my favorite poet, @kendricklamar and his album DAMN. The greatest effect coming out of silence is the clarity one has in listening. Every note stands alone. https://t.co/FliDncWfnC
The 2nd day was my best. I was able to focus entirely on my breath, without thoughts, for over an hour. The most I could do before that was 5 minutes. Day 6 was my worst as I caught a nasty cold going around the center. Couldn‚Äôt sleep from then on but pushed through til the end.
I woke up at 4 am every day, and we meditated until 9 pm. There were breaks for breakfast, lunch, and walking. No dinner. Here‚Äôs the sidewalk I walked for 45 minutes every day. https://t.co/xDI7gLx6mW
I did my meditation at Dhamma Mahim√£ in Pyin Oo Lwin. This is my room. Basic. During the 10 days: no devices, reading, writing, physical excercise, music, intoxicants, meat, talking, or even eye contact with others. It‚Äôs free: everything is given to meditators by charity. https://t.co/OhJqXKInD3
Meditation is often thought of as calming, relaxing, and a detox of all the noise in the world. That‚Äôs not vipassana. It‚Äôs extremely painful and demanding physical and mental work. I wasn‚Äôt expecting any of that my first time last year. Even tougher this year as I went deeper.
Vipassana would likely be good for those suffering chronic pain to help manage it. That‚Äôs not the goal of course, but definitely a simple practice to help. Being able to sit without moving at all for over an hour through pain definitely teaches you a lot about your potential.
Imagine sitting on a concrete floor cross-legged for an hour without moving. Pain arises in the legs in about 30-45 minutes. One‚Äôs natural reaction is to change posture to avoid the pain. What if, instead of moving, one observed the pain and decided to remain still through it?
Most meditation methods end with a goal of strengthening concentration: focus on the breath. This was not Gautama‚Äôs goal. He wanted to end his attachment to craving (of pleasure) and aversion (of pain) by experiencing it directly. His theory was ending attachment ends his misery.
Vipassana‚Äôs singular objective is to hack the deepest layer of the mind and reprogram it: instead of unconsciously reacting to feelings of pain or pleasure, consciously observe that all pain and pleasure aren‚Äôt permanent, and will ultimately pass and dissolve away.
Vipassana is a technique and practice to ‚Äúknow thyself.‚Äù Understanding the inner nature as a way to understand‚Ä¶everything. It was rediscovered by Gautama the Buddha 2,500 years ago through rigorous scientific self-experimentation to answer the question: how do I stop suffering?
For my birthday this year, I did a 10-day silent vipassana meditation, this time in Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar üá≤üá≤. We went into silence on the night of my birthday, the 19th. Here‚Äôs what I know üëáüèº

@EricaJoy @anildash @Benioff Not true. As a citizen, I think it best we set up the mayor for success, given this is the platform she was elected on. As ceo of square, I think it important that companies are treated equally, and you don‚Äôt have one company pay less than one much smaller in size.

Redid my thread. Missed this tweet https://t.co/cB2f2q9wyb
P.S. I appreciate I could be wrong about this. If I am, I‚Äôll admit it, and work to fix. I‚Äôm committed to addressing this crisis in our city, and mindful of the urgency required. Here‚Äôs the mayor‚Äôs thoughts on the matter: https://t.co/Ef0Xz54FHR
I hope this helps add some color to the conversation. I‚Äôd love to see the Mayor get the funds and support she needs to do her job. And I‚Äôm committed to helping do just that. We need to have long term solutions in place, not quick acts to make us feel good for one moment in time.
The Square/Stripe issue isn‚Äôt something the Mayor or Prop C folks can fix directly. I thought it was important to get our considerations out on the table though, so people understand our corporate hesitation and considerations (separate from my personal ones) around this measure.
We‚Äôre happy to pay our taxes. We just want to be treated fairly with respect to our peer companies, many of whom are 2-10x larger than us. Otherwise we don‚Äôt know how to practically grow in the city. That‚Äôs heartbreaking for us as we love SF and want to continue to help build it.
Hypothetically Square could pay over $20m more in 2019, while Salesforce (4x bigger than Sq) pays less than $10m. Taxes would grow at rates multiple times our adj. revenue, which no company can sustain. Not an issue for Salesforce/Twitter, but unfair to Sq and fintech startups.
I admit that while I come at this as a citizen first, there‚Äôs an unfairness I see in my role of CEO of Square (this does not apply to Twitter). Companies like Square and Stripe would be taxed at a significantly larger total contribution than much larger companies like Salesforce.
I‚Äôll also posit that we do this discussion a disservice when we only look on the surface and make it us vs. them. I find that distracting and diminishing and it‚Äôs all too common in today‚Äôs discourse. Let‚Äôs instead focus on the real issue, the policy, and whether it will work.
I‚Äòd love to see a meeting between the mayor and the @OurHomeSF (Yes on C) folks to work through the disconnect. We all have the same goals, but it doesn‚Äôt seem we‚Äôre talking enough directly. I‚Äôve been attempting to put this together. And I just received word this is in the works!
While I understand an influx of cash is attractive, the mayor has said she doesn‚Äôt have the accountability or controls she needs to manage it well. Ultimately, she is the only one on the hook to make this work. If she doesn‚Äôt feel she can, we need to listen and understand why.
A thread on San Francisco‚Äôs Prop C. As a citizen of SF since 1999, and likely for the rest of my life, my primary objective is to help set our newly elected Mayor @LondonBreed up for success. That means addressing homelessness long-term in a scalable way, with accountability.

What‚Äôs the most effective way you‚Äòve found to organize your day and work?
I answer the daily questions as I head to sleep. üí§
The ‚Äúwon‚Äôt do‚Äù list is often more important than the ‚Äúdo‚Äù list. Setting the intention to deliberately not work on something gives me clearer space to think and work, and be less reactive. Some items stay on the lists for days/weeks/months, some I want to make sure I do every day.
A practice I‚Äôve been using off and on for years: every morning I write a checklist of work I intend to do today, and work I won‚Äôt do today. Focused on more strategic efforts rather than calendar stuff. I check off the ‚Äúwon‚Äôt do‚Äù before sleep (and eventually move them up to ‚Äúdo‚Äù). https://t.co/tm5vrqPXvv

We believe Twitter helps people connect to something bigger than themselves, shows all the amazing things happening in the world, and all the things we need to acknowledge and address. We‚Äòre constantly learning how to make it freer and healthier for all to participate. Thank you.
In closing, when I think of our work, I think of my mom and dad in St. Louis, a Democrat and a Republican. We had lots of frustrating and heated debates, but looking back, I appreciate I was able to hear and challenge different perspectives. And I appreciate I felt safe to do so.
We acknowledge the growing concern people have of the power held by companies like Twitter. We believe it‚Äôs dangerous to ask Twitter to regulate opinions or be the arbiter of truth. We‚Äôd rather be judged by the impartiality of outcomes, and criticized when we fail this principle.
What our algorithms decide to show in shared spaces, like search results, is based on thousands of signals that constantly learn and evolve over time. Some of those signals are engagement, some are the number of abuse reports. We balance all of these to prevent gaming our system.
Also, there‚Äôs a distinction we need to make clear. When people follow you, you‚Äôve earned that audience. And we have a responsibility to make sure they can see your tweets. We do not have a responsibility, nor you a right, to amplify your tweets to audiences that don‚Äôt follow you.
Looking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied.
For our part, machine learning teams at Twitter are experimenting with these techniques and developing roadmaps to ensure present and future machine learning models uphold a high standard when it comes to algorithmic fairness. It‚Äôs an important step towards ensuring impartiality.
Bias in algorithms is an important topic. Our responsibility is to understand, measure, and reduce accidental bias due to factors such as the quality of the data used to train our algorithms. This is an extremely complex challenge facing everyone applying artificial intelligence.
Our technology was using a decision making criteria that considers the behavior of people following these accounts. We decided that wasn‚Äôt fair, and corrected. We‚Äòll always improve our technology and algorithms to drive healthier usage, and measure the impartiality of outcomes.
In the spirit of accountability and transparency: recently we failed our intended impartiality. Our algorithms were unfairly filtering 600,000 accounts, including some members of Congress, from our search auto-complete and latest results. We fixed it. But how did it happen?
We build our policies and rules with a principle of impartiality: objective criteria, rather than on the basis of bias, prejudice, or preferring the benefit to one person over another for improper reasons. If we learn we failed to create impartial outcomes, we  work hard to fix.
A default to free expression left unchecked can generate risks and dangers for people. It‚Äôs important Twitter distinguishes between people‚Äôs opinions and behaviors, and disarms behavior intending to silence another person, or adversely interfere with their universal human rights.
Our early and strong defense of open and free exchange has enabled Twitter to be THE platform for activists, marginalized communities, whistleblowers, journalists, governments and the most influential people around the world. Twitter will always default to open and free exchange.
Twitter cannot rightly serve as a public square if it‚Äôs constructed around the personal opinions of its makers. We believe a key driver of a thriving public square is the fundamental human right of freedom of opinion and expression.
We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from all around the world to see what‚Äôs happening, and have a conversation about what they see.
I want to start by making something clear: we don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions. Period. Impartiality is our guiding principle. Let me explain why.
If it‚Äôs okay with all of you, I‚Äôd like to read you something I personally wrote as I thought about these issues. I‚Äôll also tweet it out now.
Thank you Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and the committee, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Twitter to the American people. I look forward to our conversation about our commitment to impartiality, transparency, and accountability.
@sriramk @aarthir Congrats!
@sarah310 Thanks for the concern. Completely healthy!
@SenAngusKing @Twitter Thanks for the opportunity, and thoughtful questions Senator.
What made it possible was the fact that I was born into a nation built by the people, for the benefit of the people. Where I could work hard to make something happen which was bigger than me. I treasure that, and will do everything in my power to protect it from harm. Thank you.
In closing, when I think of our work, I think of my mom and dad in St. Louis, a Democrat and a Republican. For them Twitter has always been a source of joy, learning and connection to something bigger. They‚Äôre proud of me, proud of Twitter, and proud of what made it all possible.
Today we‚Äòre committing to the people, and this committee, to do that work, and do it openly. We‚Äòre here to contribute to a healthy public square, not compete to have the only one. We know that‚Äôs the only way our business thrives, and helps us all defend against these new threats.
But we all have to think a lot bigger, and decades past today. We must ask the question: ‚Äúwhat is Twitter incentivizing people to do (or not do), and why?‚Äù The answers will lead to tectonic shifts in how Twitter, and our industry, operates. Required changes won‚Äôt be fast or easy.
We‚Äôve learned from 2016 and more recently from other nation‚Äôs elections how to help protect the integrity of our elections. Better tools, stronger policy, and new partnerships are already in place. We intend to understand the efficacy of these measures to continue to get better.
We‚Äôve seen positive results from our work. We‚Äòre now removing over 200% more accounts for violating our policies. We‚Äôre identifying and challenging 8-10 million suspicious accounts every week. And we‚Äôre thwarting over a half million accounts from logging in to Twitter every day.
We‚Äòve made significant progress recently on tactical solutions like identification of many forms of manipulation intending to artificially amplify information, more transparency around who buys ads and how they are targeted, and challenging suspicious logins and account creation.
We weren‚Äôt expecting any of this when we created Twitter over 12 years ago. We acknowledge the real-world negative consequences of what happened, and we take full responsibility to fix it. We can‚Äôt do this alone, and that‚Äôs why this conversation is so important, and why I‚Äôm here.
Our interests are aligned with the American people and this committee. If we don‚Äôt find scalable solutions to the problems we‚Äôre now seeing, we lose our business, and we continue to threaten the original privilege and liberty we were given to create Twitter in the first place.
Abuse, harassment, troll armies, propaganda through bots and human coordination, misinformation campaigns, and divisive filter bubbles‚Ä¶that‚Äòs not a healthy public square. Worse, a relatively small number of bad-faith actors were able to game Twitter to have an outsized impact.
We aren‚Äôt proud of how that free and open exchange has been weaponized and used to distract and divide people, and our nation. We found ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems we‚Äôve acknowledged.
We‚Äòre extremely proud of helping to increase the accessibility and velocity of a simple, free and open exchange. We believe people will learn faster by being exposed to a wide range of opinions and ideas, and it helps to make our nation, and the world, feel a little bit smaller.
In any public space, you‚Äôll find inspired ideas, and you‚Äôll find lies and deception. People who want to help others and unify, and people who want to hurt others and themselves and divide. What separates a physical and digital public space is greater accessibility and velocity.
First, I wanted to step back and share our view of Twitter‚Äôs role in the world. We believe many people use Twitter as a digital public square. They gather from all around the world to see what‚Äôs happening, and have a conversation about what they see.
I‚Äôm someone of very few words, and typically pretty shy, and I realize how important it is to speak up now. If it‚Äôs okay with all of you, I‚Äôd like to read you something I personally wrote as I considered these issues. I‚Äôll also tweet this out now.
Thank you Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, and the committee, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Twitter to the American people. I look forward to our conversation about the work we‚Äôre doing to help protect the integrity of US elections, and elections around the world.

@edbott Will you refer me to those cases? Want to understand why.
@edbott I do. Consistent enforcement is critical to us. And so is evolving our service and policies.
@edbott Guess that‚Äôs one way to see it. But not how I feel.
Appreciate the conversation today. This reflects a lot of our thinking. We‚Äôve changed Twitter a lot over time, but one thing we haven‚Äôt touched is what the service implicitly incentivizes people to do. That‚Äôs the level we need to reconsider. https://t.co/3cqoIz8WHb
@jules_su This has nothing to do with what our competitors do or don‚Äôt do. We believe it‚Äôs important to consistently enforce our rules.
@BrettRedacted Our current enforcement is driven by reports of violations, reviewed by our staff. We didn‚Äôt see reports that confirmed a violation of our rules. CNN brought up some, we actioned one, Jones/Infowars deleted others before we reviewed. Our policies are also not retroactive.
Our enforcement actions escalate, ultimately ending in permanent suspension. These cases are no different, same treatment. https://t.co/iO4dwT038S
We have some evidence to show this does work. It won‚Äôt in every case. And we need to constantly evolve our enforcement actions. There will never be a perfect endpoint.
To clarify: I was speaking broadly about our range of enforcement actions, when asked why we timeout functionality on Twitter. I don‚Äôt assume everyone will change their actions. Enforcement gets tougher with further reported violations. https://t.co/HMHbL1D8hm

Some fair points here. We certainly have a lot of work to do to help journalists do their jobs better. That‚Äôs our intent. Help with reach, balance, and economic incentives. We‚Äôre behind on those last two. Shouldn‚Äôt take away from skepticism and critical thinking tho. https://t.co/2rlNWJnrjO

Relying on algorithms alone will not work. Not today, not tomorrow. And we know providing broader reach isn‚Äôt enough. We need to figure out how to help with economic incentives too. We‚Äôre behind on that, but thinking deeply about it. Open to great and scalable ideas.
One of the most important constituencies we serve is our journalist population. Has been since day 1. We don‚Äôt mean to shift the work here. We must build tools to help (and need to work together to do that). We can‚Äôt be a useful service without the integrity journalists bring. https://t.co/sARY4SgsHt

@emilyjhorne @tristanwalker Not blaming my team mates. Referring to our need to communicate the reasons behind our decisions much more through every channel.
Many more details here: https://t.co/58dc4fwjQz
Accounts like Jones' can often sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors, so it‚Äôs critical journalists document, validate, and refute such information directly so people can form their own opinions. This is what serves the public conversation best.
If we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that‚Äôs constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction. That‚Äôs not us.
Truth is we‚Äôve been terrible at explaining our decisions in the past. We‚Äôre fixing that. We‚Äôre going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.
We didn‚Äôt suspend Alex Jones or Infowars yesterday. We know that‚Äôs hard for many but the reason is simple: he hasn‚Äôt violated our rules. We‚Äôll enforce if he does. And we‚Äôll continue to promote a healthy conversational environment by ensuring tweets aren‚Äôt artificially amplified.

@Spacekatgal Thank you Brianna
Fundamentally, we need to focus more on the conversational dynamics within Twitter. We haven‚Äôt paid enough consistent attention here. Better organization, more context, helping to identify credibility, ease of use.		Challenging work and would love to hear your thoughts and ideas.
‚ÄúThere is an important discussion about journalism that must take place, including about how all of us performed during the 2016 campaign, but Twitter is not where a nuanced or thoughtful discussion can happen.‚Äù		This is what we‚Äôd like to fix the most.
‚ÄùThe downside is that everyone is treated as equally expert on various topics.‚Äù		One of the biggest areas I believe we can help. Helping to determine credible voices per topic in real-time is extremely challenging, but believe it‚Äôs possible. Mix of algos and network.
Powerful, but only if we help organize and not overwhelm people: ‚ÄùAnd it is democratic‚Äîeveryone gets to have a voice, whether they work for a local paper, a small TV station or one of the biggest newspapers in the world, or are not in the media business at all.‚Äù
This is our primary job: ‚ÄúTo be clear, Twitter is a useful and important platform. It‚Äôs a good aggregator for breaking news. I still check my feed to see breaking news developments, and I will continue to.‚Äù		Thinking a lot about how to promote more participation in conversation.
‚ÄúOn Twitter, everything is shrunk down to the same size, making it harder to discern what is a big deal and what is not. Tone often overshadows the actual news. All outrages appear equal.‚Äù		Def a problem. Believe we can help solve by showing more context and related conversation.
‚ÄúBut the medium has changed. Everyone I follow on the site seems to be tweeting more frequently, so I had to check in more frequently.‚Äù		This is the intention behind ranking the timeline. Show you ‚Äúwhat matters‚Äù first, everything else still accessible. Lots of work still to do.

@OrangeLeaderUSA Yeah, a short amount of time considering how long we‚Äôre planning to be here
@Adventure_Works @kayvz Everything is definitely connected. But we need to rethink blue badge. On the spectrum of rethinking is getting rid of it, but of course it would have a high bar of what replaces it.
@boxerbk I think that would cause far more confusion and trouble than the state we‚Äôre in.
@Leila1H We have taken a bunch of steps towards that. See last week‚Äôs actions and press around it.
@nelson Correct. We said we‚Äôd work on it 8 months ago, we didn‚Äôt. On me and us. We did pause general open verification however in November. I believe any accounts you have in mind were likely verified before that pause.
@EricaJoy I believe the account you have in mind was verified before the acknowledgment and pause. Tough state now as any badging or de-badging is conflated with endorsement. We will still enforce violations of our terms however (if that happens).

3. I know nothing.		I am open to constantly learning from all perspectives, experiences, and ways of doing things. I want to consistently experiment with myself so I always improve. No fixed mindset.
2. Everyone knows everything.		Over time, everyone will become aware of everything I know, so I must always act out of truth and fairness.
1. Everything is connected.		Any action I take will be felt everywhere, and eventually come back to me. So I have to be mindful about how those actions contribute to, or take away from, something bigger than me.

Thanks for taking the time to read and consider, and also, come help us: https://t.co/KzlFJWLMjX
We‚Äôre going to get a lot of feedback on this thread and these ideas, and we intend to work fast to learn from and share the ongoing conversations. @Vijaya, @mrdonut and I will do a Periscope next week to share more details and answer questions.
We simply can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to do this alone. So we‚Äôre seeking help by opening up an RFP process to cast the widest net possible for great ideas and implementations. This will take time, and we‚Äôre committed to providing all the necessary resources. RFP: https://t.co/SFb3e8joLl
What we know is we must commit to a rigorous and independently vetted set of metrics to measure the health of public conversation on Twitter. And we must commit to sharing our results publicly to benefit all who serve the public conversation.
We don‚Äôt yet know if those are the right indicators of conversation health for Twitter. And we don‚Äôt yet know how best to measure them, or the best ways to help people increase individual, community, and ultimately, global public health.
Our friends at @cortico and @socialmachines introduced us to the concept of measuring conversational health. They came up with four indicators: shared attention, shared reality, variety of opinion, and receptivity. Read about their work here: https://t.co/A12ZrACs8Z
If you want to improve something, you have to be able to measure it. The human body has a number of indicators of overall health, some very simple, like internal temperature. We know how to measure it, and we know some methods to bring it back in balance.
Recently we were asked a simple question: could we measure the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of conversation on Twitter? This felt immediately tangible as it spoke to understanding a holistic system rather than just the problematic parts.
We‚Äôve focused most of our efforts on removing content against our terms, instead of building a systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking. This is the approach we now need.
While working to fix it, we‚Äòve been accused of apathy, censorship, political bias, and optimizing for our business and share price instead of the concerns of society. This is not who we are, or who we ever want to be.
We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers. We aren‚Äôt proud of how people have taken advantage of our service, or our inability to address it fast enough.
Why? We love instant, public, global messaging and conversation. It‚Äôs what Twitter is and it‚Äôs why we‚Äòre here. But we didn‚Äôt fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences. We acknowledge that now, and are determined to find holistic and fair solutions.
We‚Äôre committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.

6/ We decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them.
5/ We‚Äôve been working intensely over the past few months and focused today on making some critical decisions.
4/ Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we‚Äôre *still* not doing enough.
