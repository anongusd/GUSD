Two years ago today, Mubarak stepped down. Let's hope Egypt's legacy as a stable force for peace in the ME is more than wishful thinking.
Obama admin awards fed employees $11 bil. in raises while DefSec suggests cutting troops' salary. Their priorities seem to be upside down.

Gen. Schwarzkopf led and inspired. Sad to lose someone so devoted to our nation and its troops.

Saw wounded troops &amp; their families at Walter Reed this AM - a truly inspirational reminder of sacrifice to sustain our democracy.
Voted by absentee in New Mexico with optimism that a new president can turn this country around. The last thing on my mind was "revenge."
As you cast your vote today, keep in mind what an exceptional country	this is &amp; how few people around the world share this privilege.
@tish919 Please pass on my best to your husband. Let him know how much I appreciate his service.
Three years ago today at Ft. Hood, America lost 13 heroes to radical Islamist terrorism - not "workplace violence," as this admin calls it.
No nation, foreign ideology, or militant movement can alone obstruct our path to a greater America. Only our leaders can.
Four more years of envy, resentment &amp; division instead of respect for personal responsibility &amp; earned success could forever change America.
The choice voters have is simple: continue the slide toward debt &amp; bigger government or return to the principles that made America great.
Re-election and more "flexibility" abroad for Pres. Obama means more concession of US interests to Putin and others. We need new leadership.

America is not destined to stay on its current trajectory toward becoming a second-rate nation. It can be reversed. It must be reversed.
If Pres Obama loses on Nov 6, it may well be because he has failed to	govern from the center and independents are disappointed in him.
Romney rightly pointed out we can't kill our way out of this war. We need a strategy to combat radical Islamism &amp; Obama doesn't have one.
Despite claims from the Obama admin, those at Ft. Hood were not victims of "workplace violence" but of terrorism: http://t.co/EG3dZ8ZC
Most important debate is tonight - not simply b/c it's the last. Voters need to be clear where candidates stand on US role in the world.
Why is media certain Pres called Benghazi an "act of terror" when days	later his admin insisted it was a spontaneous YouTube-inspired mob?
Our veterans deserve better than this.   http://t.co/paUBlbFx
Our hip hop friend is on the mark: RT @Mr_Dupri: "If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much." -Don Rumsfeld http://t.co/3KNnbNCS
I'm biased &amp; I know it, but Gov. Romney, above all else, came off as presidential. Pres. Obama appeared incapable of defending his record.
From Ft Hood to Benghazi, this administration refuses to acknowledge radical Islamism's role in killing Americans.
If the buck stopped in this administration Pres Obama would say when &amp; how he learned about Benghazi &amp; take responsibility.

The American people deserve to know what happened in Benghazi. We now	know some "video" and "protests" had nothing to do with it.
The Obama administration didn't want 9/11 Benghazi attack to be seen as terrorism, but rather as a protest. Wishing doesn't make it so.
Many thanks to @brithume for meeting with the Rumsfeld Foundation’s new fellows yesterday at Fox News http://t.co/cN0gh1ml
Terrific, comprehensive speech by Gov. Romney at VMI. He knows America's role in the world should be as a leader not as a spectator.
Last night's debate was the pivot Gov. Romney needs to make up ground	w/ disillusioned Obama voters. There are more of them than we think.
Gov. Romney was strong, confident, and smiling. Pres. Obama looked like he couldn't get off the stage soon enough.
It was an honor to celebrate 30 years of @washtimes last night. Our capital is better served by competing papers. Competition is healthy.
Met w/ MD US Senate candidate @dbongino last night. He is a breath of fresh air – smart, experienced &amp; ready to serve. http://t.co/J4xIe1nX
By blaming violence on an obscure video few people have seen, the Obama administration is reinforcing a pattern of blaming America first.
The Obama administration's early confidence about the Benghazi attack was misplaced, according to @EliLake: http://t.co/nl04wQBR

I actually believe in redistribution if it means redistributing our current leadership out of the White House on January 20th.
Romney can make his case for strengthening our economy directly to the voters in the upcoming debates. The path we're on isn't working.
Coming up this AM on @foxandfriends momentarily to discuss troubling Middle East events.
ICYMI: Sobering piece in last week's WSJ by @Liz_Cheney on the President's foreign policy: http://t.co/39iuB4gP
The attacks on our embassies &amp; diplomats are a result of perceived American weakness. Mitt Romney is right to point that out.
Thankful for all those whose serve and sacrifice at home and abroad on this most memorable day.
Saddened by the loss of Neil Armstrong, but let his life be a reminder of what America can achieve if it dares to take giant leaps.

Sitting down with Diane Sawyer to talk #knownandunknown. Our conversation airs Monday 2/7 on @ABCworldnews & @Nightline.
There's a lot of discussion about the author of the new “O” book on Pres. Obama. I want to end any speculation now: it wasn't me.
In tonight’s #SOTU, Pres. Obama should provide leadership to promptly pass free trade agreements with Columbia, Panama, and S. Korea.
Tough day for Chicago #Bears fans. But we're used to disappointment. Speaking of which, the #Cubs' season opener is 67 days away.
With 15 days to publication, I talked with @AP’s Hillel Italie about writing #knownandunknown: http://bit.ly/hQ591e

50 yrs ago JFK became President. In less than 3 wks I will share my personal impressions of him and a decade that forever changed America.
Listening by radio from US Capitol balcony to 1963 #MLK "I Have A Dream" speech left a lasting impression on this then-freshman congressman.
Our "miniature" daschund, Chester, is now more than 18 pounds. Not so miniature. http://on.fb.me/fuuwiY
At a time when our nation needed it, President Obama delivered moving, presidential remarks last night. Well done.

In my experience, Britain has been our strongest friend, through shared values and support in both word and deed. http://bit.ly/hBSqTB
Joyce & I are praying for all those felled by evil in Tucson. We saw a similar rush to judgment w/o facts in Dallas in 1963.
Congrats to @Martin_Dempsey next @USArmy CoS and Gen. Casey for 41 yrs of dedication to our troops. Was an honor to serve alongside both.

To the men and women in uniform serving far from their loved ones this Christmas, know that we are grateful for your service.
Long overdue for Ivy universities to let ROTC programs and mil recruiters back on campus. DADT isn't an excuse anymore.
It’s more urgent & critical to US natl security to pass a free trade agreement w/ Colombia than a dated arms control treaty w/ Russia.
27 years ago today, I met with Saddam Hussein. There's much more to the story than this well known photo: http://bit.ly/e04WVA
Believe it or not I just got an iPad. Now I need my 13 year old grandson to show me how to work it.
There’s a solution to all this talk of America’s preordained “decline,” “multipolarity,” “end of US primacy,” etc. It’s called leadership.
A busy year for the Rumsfeld Foundation. Joyce and I released our 2010 Annual Report today: http://bit.ly/euAPn0

With my book I will release 100s of supporting docs on a website – many previously classified, but unlike #Wikileaks, all cleared by USG.
I was a co-sponsor of FOIA in 1966. There is an appropriate, lawful process for declassifying material. It's not #Wikileaks.
Joyce and I send our Thanksgiving thoughts and prayers to those deployed away from their loved ones this holiday.
Is it “bipartisan” to dismiss legitimate concerns over START and to rush a major treaty through the Senate? Never has been before.
If there is to be a START treaty, it ought not limit US missile defense and long-range non-nuclear strike capabilities.
We all dearly miss Peter’s wisdom. RT @kathrynlopez my reflex is still to want peter rodman's opinion when something happens in the world...

My respect and admiration to all those in our armed forces and to their families who also serve this Veteran's Day.
Many go through life wondering if they’ve made a difference; a Marine never has that problem. Happy 235th birthday @USMC.
Another logical spending cut: abolish earmarks with a moratorium, including pet projects added to the defense budget.
Tough fiscal choices ahead: Reforming entitlements should top the list – cutting the defense budget should not.
