@socialmontoya @JohnPri68926642 @realDonaldTrump Once an addict always an addict.	The difference is the amount of will power they have. 	Making it legal is not making it less appealing.

@socialmontoya @JohnPri68926642 @realDonaldTrump Mixing mental health patients with legal drugs is asinine. That's like giving them permission to commit crimes.

@WTFredux @Biznezz_Prez @1CANNONII @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Funny how this went on with his case for 6 years and nothing was done. He had the surgery in 2016. 	The VA Neurosurgeon was not Fired until 2018... After Trump made the changes. Hard pressed to find it just a coincidence.
@WTFredux @Biznezz_Prez @1CANNONII @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This Dr had many complaints and nothing was done.	I do believe you knew the answer before you asked the question if Trump rendered an expert opinion.	Don't make a mockery of his situation.
@Biznezz_Prez @WTFredux @1CANNONII @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The Dr. reviewed the same MRI's and CT scan the VA took. He clearly saw the 2 fractured vertebrae and performed surgery the next week. He had a laminectomy, a discectomy, fusion, 2 rods, 4 screws, and an interbody cage.	Thanks to Trump this Neurosurgeon is no longer there.
@Biznezz_Prez @WTFredux @1CANNONII @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He suffered for 6 years with no relief. Not even morphine pills helped. We finally found out about the Veterans Choice program. (No one volunteered this info) He went to a Neurosurgeon across the road at another hospital. The Dr. Was appalled at the neglect. See next post.
@Biznezz_Prez @WTFredux @1CANNONII @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump My husband is a Vet. He was diagnosed with 2 fractured vertebrae while serving and was Medically Retired.
