@bigtkirk hi  my parents live in the woodland.
@TrafficGen not losing a fortune in your 401K   too many people are!
@BreezinE As long as U R in a Roth and R comfortable with the risk factors of where ur money is great. if U R 55 and have lost 50% not good
@jporterGOP thanks for the RT
@BreezinE If your have an IRA it does not have to be in the stock market and be at high risk.  IRA' are trust by law and can invest in lots
@BreezinE If you are saving/investing for your retirement without a company contribution Roth is preferred over traditional.
@BreezinE if you qualify for a Roth Ira it is a preferred way to save your money vs a treditional one. There are also Roth 401k programs
The big 401k question! Should U be putting the most U can in a 401k? http://bit.ly/HxX5Y
