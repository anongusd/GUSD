@clbmanning @kmccarthy317 @moonraye @cindewirth @MichelleSteeve4 @bryansilver9 You did great!!!
@bearprincipal Hey! How are you?
@dmvelliaris I understand that!!! Definitely.
@dmvelliaris Ahh!!! I was at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8.
@SgalloSpeech @barbersclass They do! It's funny! I switch the exercises up and as soon as I say squats, they start groaning! I love it! :)
@Fitbound @Ferguson8806 I need inspiration. I'm struggling in my exercise motivation. It's completely mind over matter and my mind isn't mattering. :(
@alison_miller18 @Fitbound Same for PD! When you're in a pd, sitting all day and they tell you how kids need to move! #Ineedtomovetoo!!!
@gmlarese @hsingmaster As a teacher, I love looking around my classroom and seeing my kids productively working however they are comfortable-lying on the floor, sitting under a table, etc. As long as I can see them and they are safe, we are good! #Globaledchat
@SgalloSpeech @barbersclass As an elementary teacher, I often have my students exercise while they count. They have to do squats, arm circles, jog in place, etc. It's great and the kids are tired when they're done!
@clbmanning I'm glad you make it a priority. Thank you :)
@jftrey That's so true! Thank you :)
Hello! My name is Andi and I'm in Arlington, Virginia. #globaledchat
@vB_ibbio Love it, Gretel! I want to be in your biology class!
@dmvelliaris I just saw that you're in Singapore! I lived in Singapore for several months! What part are you in?
@dmvelliaris How do you solve the problem that tends to happen? We have forced lesson plan sharing. Some Ts do all the work and others take. Those taking share all the fun things they're doing while the others are stuck at home doing the work. Lessons have to be on Google Docs for all to see.
@jlatchana I completely agree! We also have to remember that when we complain about school, colleagues, etc. during the school day, there are usually Ss around and they do listen!
@DougHodum @STEMBren We have to keep advocating for our students and ourselves, Doug. You are right, too. We need to own our expertise and pull our folding chair up to the table.
@KellieTaylorEdD Hahahaha Our little ones matter too!!! &lt;3
@MichelleSteeve4 @KellieTaylorEdD @STEMBren Thank you, @MichelleSteeve4 !!!
@dmvelliaris This is true. Sometimes it is hard to get past that some do too much and others do not do enough. How can this balance be improved? It seems we all struggle with it.
It can only help us all if we work together for our kids. 	#EinsteinFellows18 	Thank you so much, @DougHodum You ROCK! https://t.co/CfQnumcFaT
@dmvelliaris Has anyone ever read The Five Dysfunctions of a Team? Great book about working together and communicating!
@jlatchana It varies year to year. Much work tends to be done after school for us.
@vB_ibbio @earthwatch Oh, yeah!!! @earthwatch_org &lt;3
@jlatchana @cwright4math That's funny, Jill!
@vB_ibbio Gretel, I looped with my class from Kindergarten to Second Grade. Best. Thing. Ever.
Q3: It would probably help the Ts to honor our strengths by having our Ss collaborate more. We learn from them. For example, HS Ss could mentor young Ss &amp; young Ss could model a STEM lesson they've done. It can help the flow &amp; connection for Ts &amp; Ss. 		#EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/CXPIts7GI7
@jftrey Music to my ears! Thank you for recognizing elementary!!!
@STEMBren @drdancarpenter I think making sure they are actual PLCs is important too. In my district, our correlates/committees are called PLCs.
@vB_ibbio I like that, Gretel.
@clbmanning Great point, Cheryl.
@DavidJLockett We are so glad you could join us!
@jlatchana Exactly, Brenda!
A2: As an elementary teacher, it is imperative to advocate for our young Ss. Our area is too often overlooked and we lay the foundation! We also teach every subject. Helping others understand that is an important role for us and a challenge simultaneously. #EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/j2yUooN3Wv
A1: I've honestly &amp; unfortunately never seen teachers really collaborating to this extent in my district with the exception of the principals. It could definitely help different areas understand the timeline of what we all teach, Ss needs, etc. #TeamworkGif	#EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/Ex3RS4Yn2s
Good evening and thank you for joining us! My name is Andi Webb and my favorite informal education space for creative #STEM ideas is probably from other teachers. I also like Steve Spangler, Wonderopolis @mimkirk, although it's not really informal. #EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/jJI3yNZ7i2

A3: My 1st grade teacher's assistant, actually. She and I still stay in contact! She noticed me. She was kind to me. The teacher she worked with, my 1st grade teacher, became a principal. She hired me at the job I've worked my entire career. &lt;3		#EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/kP5xl9BfAy

A2: Reframing failure. There's so much to learn from failure and children (and adults) need to know that scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technology experts have ALL failed before achieving success. It may seem simple but it is innovative.	#EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/KCId3aedqx
@STEMBren So true, Brenda.

@hloewecke A5: #globaledchat	Such a great question! It's a fine line. Having lots of critical discussions can help. Discussing the danger of a single story idea definitely can open eyes. If at all possible, incorporate someone else of similar faith/culture to share their thoughts.
@SingingWithJeff I appreciate the honesty. There are many resources to help and I'm sure @hloewecke  and @hsingmaster can help with that too. I've done a lot of research. Have you considered applying to @TGC_IREX ?
@SingingWithJeff Great point! Have they shared their thoughts?
@hloewecke A3: Time! I want to do SO much!!! I have to try to include everything I want to do and make special memories with the little ones! We also have a New Year's Countdown on the last day before break. We throw confetti and wear NY hats, have ginger ale floats, etc!		#globaledchat

@STEMagogy I think it's a pretty terrific idea!
@STEMagogy Hahahaha Thank you!
@STEMagogy I didn't know that! Do #EinsteinFellows18 get a discount? :)
@STEMagogy Climate change is happening and I don't see how one can deny it.
@STEMagogy Even more so after working in Churchill but it does frustrate me. Animals need advocates and it is our responsibility to take care of the environment we inhabit.
@CammieRNewmyer @AEF_Program Thank you! That was 2nd grade! The little ones can do so much! I even had my kindergartners file their own work in file folders---and they did very well! Saved me a lot of time!
@STEMagogy Love it! I've done that with students' self-portraits. I had a kindergarten think I was completely lying to him because he would "never" have drawn like that! hahaha
#EinsteinFellows18 https://t.co/1cVc4cd3JR
Thank you :) I especially loved the personal goals because my kids could see that I value ALL aspects of what is important to them.
@STEMagogy It may not seem that innovative now but Skype (or Zoom, etc.) because it so easily and readily connects us with people around the world. Our students can have conversations with people they may never otherwise meet. Love it.
A3 Cont.	#EinsteinFellows18 	I forgot! I also have had my students set academic and personal goals for themselves. They had to self-evaluate their progress and what may be helping/hindering their progress.
@KellieTaylorEdD @AEF_Program Yes! I love having children debate because to debate well, they have to really understand. It's a process and not a product.

@AzulZR It is important when they are young to begin laying a strong foundation for empathy and understanding.
@MPOWERingEDU @KellieTaylorEdD @TeachingLC @AEF_Program Yes, ma'am!!!
A1 Cont.: It also means teaching empathy, connecting them to a larger world, &amp; working to solve age appropriate problems together.	#FellowsatED 	#IEW2018 	#EinsteinFellows18

@Ms_Vlajic I agree. I like family meetings to talk about issues in the classroom and how to solve them....together.
@JeremyDBond @afterschool4all It was a couple years ago that they wrote the EPA-not current leadership in many respects. I‚Äôve done the lesson since then but they didn‚Äôt write letters.
@JeremyDBond @afterschool4all Do you mind clarifying? When?
@AndyHetheringt2 Love it!
@afterschool4all A6: I initiated a leadership team in our 5th grade with 2 reps from each class as the Senate would have. They addressed school-side issues with our principal and learned about leadership skills. #globaledchat
@klburkinshaw1 @hloewecke üò¨
@hloewecke They never got replies but they recommended double hulls on the carriers, more effective clean up methods, etc. Their letters were convincing!
@sethbrady9 Absolutely! Great point.
@AndyHetheringt2 Not just a student teacher! It‚Äôs an important role and a valuable time for you!
@afterschool4all Oops! A5! Sorry about that!

#globaledchat The Library of Congress and Smithsonian have tons of resources for educators! @librarycongress @SmithsonianLab @SEECstories @SmithsonianEdu @KellieTaylorEdD @AEF_Program
@hloewecke They also debated poaching and all were against it. When I related it to deer hunting so popular in our area, their opinions quickly changed! We talked about the comparisons and that was great.
@hloewecke 4th grade and they were soooo good at it!
@hloewecke Absolutely! Selfishly, I love it! üòâ I had Ss debate if a shopping area was worth the deforestation for the jobs created in an area near our school. Two best friends got so frustrated with each other bc they were both so passionate-for opposite arguments! So fun!!!

@JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach For the application, I made a plan for all the money for year one. If I was going to show a need, I needed to have a plan for it. I didn't plan for a little of the money-all. #bwfcasmtchat
@JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach I apologize that I missed this ?	I couldn't answer from the interviewers perspective. I know that I had valid data to show our need but, in truth, I spoke from the heart. The interview is the opportunity to do that. #bwfcasmtchat
@kcollazo Thank you, Kim! #bwfcasmtchat
@amays_bwfund @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @IBwfund Thank you for allowing us to take part!
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND @amays_bwfund Can you imagine, @amays_bwfund ? üòÑ
@NCWalkTalksMath @totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND @amays_bwfund Uh, yes!!! Claudia, love this! #CASMTtakesNC ;)
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @amays_bwfund You are most welcome! Feel free to keep the conversation going as we all are willing to help you. That's for real.
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND @EducationNC @amays_bwfund Thank you to all our @BWFUND and #bwfcasmt family!
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND @EducationNC @amays_bwfund You are silly, Michelle! Thank you all and, Michelle, you're pretty darn amazing yourself! Love ya, lady! Thank you for your support given to me!	#bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @amays_bwfund Thank you, @yasminbendaas! Please apply! You won't regret it! #bwfcasmtchat
@Betsy90585296 @Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @amays_bwfund @BWFUND The opportunities that are open to you as a CASMT recipient are endless-that's the truth. It all depends on your willingness to make the most of it. #bwfcasmtchat
@Betsy90585296 @Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @amays_bwfund @BWFUND I'm glad your first year has been so good, Betsy! It's true. These are people who do not say they will help-they actually will. #bwfcasmtchat
@JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach We needed instructional materials for math like nobody's business. We also need excellent pd for our teachers. We have it. CASMT did it. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas Yes, and be specific. #bwfcasmtchat
@JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach Some are classroom focused-it depends on your needs. Our district and school both struggle with NBT standards so that was a focus we seriously needed. #bwfcasmtchat
@JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach For me, it was my school and K-1 in particular. I wanted years 2 and 3 to add 2-3 and 4-5. I was able to get a year ahead, though. I had district data too but was school focused. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach I have truly never seen people support educators more wholeheartedly than @amays_bwfund  and @BWFUND They do not see black and white. They see endless possibilities. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach Maybe you find a conference that will support your work that you didn't know about early on. Talk to BWFund about it. Your year one is very specific and you work on years two-five as you go. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach There are things you don't know when you apply. @BWFUND and @amays_bwfund could not be more willing to work with CASMT recipients and allow it to evolve. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach Great question-as the needs of our teachers and students change, it has changed some but without losing focus of the original intent. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @JEnlow12 @yasminbendaas @BWFUND My principal and I talked a TON about my application and interview. She was a huge support for me. Ask questions, get feedback, etc. #bwfcasmtchat
@NCWalkTalksMath @Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach I agree with Claudia. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach I think I used very specific examples. I had standardized test data-we had decreased in math a very significant amount. I used specific school and district examples too. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas Amen! #bwfcasmtchat 	@BWFUND  puts a lot of trust in those who receive this award and it should be taken seriously. That being said, there are so many fun and amazing parts of the award.
@Sallie_Senseney @totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND Yes! #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach Sallie, I feel I had data that supported our huge need for this. I'm not a data driven person, though. I'm child driven so that was my main focus. #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach A6: Cont. @BWFUND  Takes this award very, very seriously and they should. It is huge and if blessed to be selected, you will be blessed for life. #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach A6: Cont. If you are blessed to received an interview, reach out to us again. While the interview was serious and intense, I am very thankful for it. #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach A6: Cont. 	I would suggest not thinking about the interview yet. Cross that bridge when you get to it. Focus on the application. #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach A6: #bwfcasmtchat cont.	Try not to be overwhelmed. Take the app step by step, do your research, and know what you need. Our data supported our dire need for help with math instruction.
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach A6: #BWFCASMTChat There‚Äôs so much help available! Ask us! We are willing to help you. Take your time, do your research. Be specific.
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND That is true, Michelle! #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND That is wonderful, Sallie! Please reach out to us individually too if we can help you. #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND A5: Cont. 	There was another interviewee in the lobby while I was waiting. I would not let that get in my head bc I'm bad about that. I tried to rest in my own abilities and simply put forth my own best effort. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND I did not receive an interview the first time. #bwfcasmtchat
@Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND Much more focused and specific-I had a game plan and did my research. I was not nearly as strategic the first time. 1st was  for science. 2nd attempt was for math. #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND A5: Cont. 	If you apply for many smaller, albeit very meaningful, grants-you can spend your time more focused on this one AMAZING grant. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND I really didn't sleep the night before. Over and over-I practiced. #bwfcasmtchat
@NCWalkTalksMath @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND *her
@NCWalkTalksMath @yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND And @NCWalkTalksMath was one who helped me....and I didn't even know here then. She helped a stranger. That's what it's all about. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND Maybe @amays_bwfund  should show up at our doors like Ed McMahon! LOL #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @BWFUND Hahahaha I can completely relate, Michelle! Except once you know people who've received it, you know it's not a scam! #bwfcasmtchat
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND A5: #BWFCASMTChat For the interview, I practiced over and over. I timed myself. I asked people willing to help tons of questions.
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND A5: #BWFCASMTChat It is a huge award and should be hard work. It is worth it. Cont.
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND A5: #BWFCASMTChat I put a lot of research into it and honestly, I spoke from my heart. I prepared a lot. Cont.
@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach @BWFUND A5: #BWFCASMTChat Yes! I applied once &amp; did not get an interview. In retrospect, I shouldn‚Äôt have. I worked to improve my app. Cont.
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @GoGlobalNC A4: Cont. I studied S'pore math in S'pore for 3 and a half months and am here now continuing my math research that all began with CASMT. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @GoGlobalNC A4: My work is with Singapore Math. When I applied for CASMT, we needed so much help. Since CASMT, we have had so many amazing resources, pd, etc. #bwfcasmtchat 2/2
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas @GoGlobalNC A4: #BWFCASMTChat   The ongoing support, no doubt. Unparalleled pd, support for our kids! The Fulbright and Einstein Programs, definitely.
@totalstemteach @Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas We can assure you that @BWFund has thought of everything with this award and if not, they'll do their best to find an answer! #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @yasminbendaas Same here! I've finished two years of my doctoral work in educational leadership. #bwfcasmtchat
@totalstemteach @Sallie_Senseney @yasminbendaas I agree with Michelle wholeheartedly. There are skeptics but it is REAL! #bwfcasmtchat

@yasminbendaas @totalstemteach A3: The willingness to help, listen, connect you with others statewide, nationally, globally-unparalleled. Cont. #BWFCASMTChat
