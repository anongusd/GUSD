@KissAdDissAd @tonetalks 2) Should they?  Not for me to say. If we ever get a commission - that's an issue it should take up. My husband's pov is that he should get them from Spain. He has however, politically supported Conyers bill. As a black man in the U.S. my husband faces daily racism.
@KissAdDissAd @tonetalks 1) My husband is a black Puerto Rican. His family was enslaved in Ponce. I'm well aware of the history of some Puerto Ricans who won't deal with the African roots of most of PR culture.  Racism there - is no diff than racism here, and was reinforced under US colonial rule.
@KissAdDissAd @tonetalks 4) but the anti-immigrant nativism I'm seeing posted by folks with #ADOS by their names, coupled with claims to being "black natives" stomping all over indigenous folks here - I reject.
@KissAdDissAd @tonetalks 3) For reparations to really counter the systemic racism of centuries - they need to be applied as funding for schools, jobs, mortgages...and yes descendants of folks who were enslaved north and south - should benefit
@KissAdDissAd @tonetalks 2) There were people enslaved here - forced to leave, in order to be emancipated. Others who were sold back to - or transferred to the Caribbean.
@KissAdDissAd @tonetalks 1) I wasn't including or excluding.  I've supported the calls for reparations for years -since Conyers wrote his first bill in 1997. What I am pointing out is that this is not a show me your family papers only enslaved on a U.S. plantation issue.

@sollie1906 @tonetalks You have misinterpreted my point.  Many black descendants of enslaved people here in the U.S. are descendants of black people initially enslaved in the Caribbean, and brought here.  So what is your cutoff point?  Are you rejecting certain enslaved ancestors?

@Jamal43295747 @tonetalks 5) So while I support reparations - don't be so quick to dismiss Caribbean connections - the slave trade was to the "Americas", not to only the U.S. colonies
@Jamal43295747 @tonetalks 4) In 1680, just seven percent of the population of Virginia and Maryland consisted of slaves; twenty years later, the figure was 22 percent. Most of these slaves did not come directly from Africa, but from Barbados  and other Caribbean colonies...https://t.co/rsQCzqjLUz
@Jamal43295747 @tonetalks 3) Breeding farms went into high gear after the trade was shut down, and access to buying the the Caribbean became difficult, if not impossible.
@Jamal43295747 @tonetalks 2)10.7 million survived the dreaded Middle Passage, disembarking in North America, the Caribbean and South America. And how many of these 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to North America? Only about 388,000. https://t.co/taNpCUfu7h  https://t.co/taNpCUfu7h
@Jamal43295747 @tonetalks 1) Between 1525 and 1866, in the entire history of the slave trade to the New World, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the New World.
