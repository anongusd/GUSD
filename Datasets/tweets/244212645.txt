Reporting tips from @jonathanvswan w a twist or two from me:	1. Spend time in person w sources - not on Twitter   2. Sources respond to fear, facts - not ass-kissing  3. Work sources in all factions - live by 1 good source, die by 1.  4. Groupthink is lame, real, dangerous
Every reporter or person who wants to be a reporter should listen to the final 15 minutes of this to learn what it takes to be a truly great reporter...wise advice via@jonathanswan https://t.co/UEmDKzUFKQ
