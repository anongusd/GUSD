@Alyssa_Milano Why isn't he and his family paying for the wall as an act of service to the nation?
@NBCNews Another black kid gone too soon.
@Walter_Zaldana @JasmineStylesTV Of course they are not. I read a story about a restaurant near capitol hill. The owner gave free sandwiches to those who are working for free.
@sarahphinneytv You look cold
@jcfc8 @DukeMBB @dukepbp I was just thinking that same thing. Especially since the crew held up with his absence. I don't see any urgency.
@JasmineStylesTV What story is that?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you and your family can fund the wall. Consider it a gift to the American people. #actsofservice
@TODAYshow Those who do not know their opponents view points, do not completely understand that of their own.
