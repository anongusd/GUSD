Another win for @BarackObama in the 3rd Presidential #debate. Too bad there's not a 4th one. The President would win that as well.

Barack Obama brought his A-game to #LongIsland and ko'd Mitt Romney in the middle of #NassauCounty. Well done Mr. President.
Will soon be heading to @HofstraU for tonight’s debate. It’s just 20 minutes from my house. Will of course be rooting for our cmdr in chief.
Happy to welcome #BarackObama &amp; #MittRomney to #LongIsland for their 2nd showdown. Just not sure which Mitt Romney will show-up here.
Pleased to announce that #FEMA has awarded @NorthHempstead more than $1.2 million to pay for cleanup costs caused by #HurricaneIrene.
Way to go Joe! Biden trounced Ryan in the #VPDebate. Look forward to @BarackObama doing the same to Mitt Romney next week.

Had an enjoyable evening at Temple Emanuel in #GreatNeck where I talked about my 15 terms on Congress.
Will be cheering on @BarackObama during tonight's long awaited Presidential debate in Denver.
Dems still want to pass middle class tax cuts &amp; jobs, farm &amp; cybersecurity bills but the #DoNothingGOP continues to say no. Outrageous!
#MittRomney charges 47% of our country with belonging to the moocher class, and then decries "class warfare?"  Unbelievable!
Heartbroken over the death of Alan Gershuny, 1 of my best friends ever. I owe him so much. He was a great patriot &amp; teriffic human being.
I blasted #MittRomney for criticizing @BarackObama's response to the attacks on U.S. embassies in #Libya &amp; #Egypt. http://t.co/JuqI3VLA

#MittRomney should keep quiet about foreign affairs.The presidency is no place 4 the amateurish &amp; spastic blundering he demonstrated abroad.

The #USPS is in desperate need of reform but Republicans refuse to tackle the matter. Just more inaction from the GOP's do-nothing Congress.
As Republicans chant "repeal,"a new poll says NYers support the health care act. It's time 4 the GOP to accept that the law is here 2 stay.
Jeremy Lin's incredible run in NY was great while it lasted. Goodbye #Linsanity.
Applaud the President for seeking to extend tax cuts 2 the middle class. It's time 4 millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share.
