@GOP logic: Giving a tax break to people like @ParisHilton (who's never worked a day in her life) =Capitalism, while @AOC paying her hardworking Congressional staffers enough to live=Communism. Shouldn't it be the opposite? #FactsMatter #Fightfor15 #AOC #GOPTaxScam #FBR #Resist
@NFL logic: @Kaepernick7 should be banned for life for taking a knee, but #RobertKraft can own an entire team after sexually abusing kidnapped teenage girls held captive in a fake massage parlor. Makes total sense! #BoycottthePats
