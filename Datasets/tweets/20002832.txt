@cornbreadpapa @kayleighmcenany @maziehirono You have proof of that?? Is it buried in the 10,000 documents that were kept hidden?
@cornbreadpapa @kayleighmcenany @maziehirono She seeks answers while others do not. Let the process play out rather than force it through. Pretty simple.
@figment2211 @cornbreadpapa @kayleighmcenany @maziehirono You live up to your handle... Figment, of your wild, misguided imagination.
@figment2211 @kayleighmcenany @maziehirono Please explain.
@cornbreadpapa @kayleighmcenany @maziehirono She's trying to make things right rather than continue the divisive nature of her environment. You believe what you want, veiled in ignorance.
@kayleighmcenany @maziehirono is great woman!! We are proud to have her representing the state of Hawai'i and all that she does for this nation!!! Mahalo Senator!
@iaendzoner @kayleighmcenany Yes, please do. What about her proudly representing the state of Hawai'i??
