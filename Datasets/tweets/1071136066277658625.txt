@GOPChairwoman And while we're at it, we'll be eliminating the GOP.
@senatemajldr That's right - better get out of the way Mitch!
@GOP That's because 80% of Americans can't even spell socialism, let alone tell you what it is.
@GOP The sooner the better!
@GOP @VP Well, yippee for the unborn. Now what about the rest of us?
@nypost So how does Sean Giancola get around?
@business @rob_libadia I'm all for it, but I'll believe it when I see it.
@GOPChairwoman And it's been another MONTH that we've had to listen to YOU.
@marcorubio Maybe you should try spending 17% of your time dealing with the concerns of the American people.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yeah, Trump was in Vietnam, wasting our money.

@GOP "Medicare For All" means no more billions of wasted healthcare dollars raked in by drug companies.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Move along, nothing to see here...
@LaF3mm3Nikita @GOVTWINE It should be illegal to think, say, or write the words "I am a candidate" until January 2020. I haven't even started to recover from the midterms.
@marcorubio So, meanwhile, in the good 'ole USofA...you do remember the USofA don't you?
@marcorubio Where are the trucks with aid to my house?

@GOP @marc_lotter Yeah, I feel real protected - just hope I don't get sick and don't grow old.
@GOP Amazon management obviousy didn't spend even 10 seconds thinking this through. Incompetent, arrogant, indifferent come to mind. A little give &amp; take &amp; it could have been a beautiful thing.

@thehill Why not? So Dems can become mindless stooges like the GOP?
@thehill Lieberman is history and should just get out of our way!
@thehill Give 'em hell Mazie! I'm sick of his shit!
@politico Give 'em hell girl! I'm 69 and retired and so sick of these old men and their bullshit!

@CBSNews Well Senator, why don't you and your colleagues find some energy to dump Trump and save whatever is left of the GOP?
RT @ProudResister: I have never felt threatened by immigrants. I have felt threatened by Trump supporters hiding behind anonymous twitter a…
@stucam7771 You got that right!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The right thing is not build a $5 billion wall!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Time for Republican politicians to dump Trump and save what's left of the GOP!
@thehill I'm sure they'll miss him lol!
@EricTrump @TrumpGolfLA @TrumpGolf @GreenskeeperOrg @Trump Yeah, Americans really care about golf courses for rich guys.
@HouseGOP We have cigarette control. Why don't we have alcohol control and gun control?
@SenTedCruz @POTUS @JohnCornyn Security is fine. A $5 billion wall that anybody can fly over, tunnel under or sail around is nuts!
@marcorubio That's why we don't need a wall - the God of Israel will protect us!
@realDonaldTrump We don't need a wall that anybody can fly over, tunnel under, or sail around. We need cybersecurity!
@nytimes Are they hiring people to provide an invading migrant horde for this spectacle? Where's Cecil B. DeMille when we need him?
@stucam7771 Yeah, what we have to do is get past McConnell.
@RoyBlunt But we don't neet to spend $5 billion on a useless wall! We need cybersecurity! When are Republican politicians going to dump Trump &amp; save what's left of the GOP?
@CongressmanHice @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump They know that it's a stupid idea to spend $5 billion on useless wall. We need that money spent on cybersecurity!
@GOP @GOPLeader Seems to me it's about the GOP committig suicide!
@GOPLeader @WhiteHouse Can't get serious about a crisis when there is no crisis!
@GOP @PressSec The President shouldn't waste $5 billion on a useless wall!
@realDonaldTrump Why spend $5 billion on a wall that anybody can go under, over or around. Let's use some common sense! We need CYBERSECURITY!
@realDonaldTrump We watched Stormy Daniels fold her thongs. You probably saw some of those.
@funder We watched Stormy Daniels fold her laundry.
@GOP Border security is one thing - a useless $5 billion wall is another. Let's use some common sense!
RT @funder: Up for a late night trend session? If this gets to 500 retweets in the next fifteen minutes, we will start to push #MitchShutdo…
@RepLoudermilk That was then, this is now. And there isn't any crisis - except maybe for the GOP committing suicide.
@SenatorWicker Doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that a wall won't stop any of that. Spend $5 billion on cybersecurity - that's where it's really needed!
@senatemajldr We don't need a $5 billion wall! We need cybersecurity!
@GOP @GOPChairwoman It's time to put away the President's delusional perception of reality! Much more important places to spend $5 billion! Cybersecurity for one!
@senatemajldr What's wrong with you? You're a poor excuse for an American! End the shutdown!
@politico He wouldn't be lonely if he resigned and moved back to his 5th Ave mancave full of hookers. Just trying to help.
@thehill Imagine that.
@EdDrantch @WKBW If the media stopped giving him all this attention, maybe he'd stop bothering us!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump That was then. This is now. In case you didn't know.
@stucam7771 Great idea! 9:01 the FBI walks in and slaps the cuffs on him!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Let Beto give the response! Sit him right on the Rio Grande surrounded by the invading hordes!
@JustSchmeltzer @tedlieu Beto! And he's from Texas! Just sit him right there by the Rio Grande surrounded by the invading hordes.
@realDonaldTrump Believe it when I see it!
@GOP Fine! Just not with a wall! Waste of a lot of my money!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump We don't need a wall! We need cybersecurity! One Chinese guy flips a switch and the entire U.S. Is paralyzed!
@stucam7771 I would refer you to Germany - 1933-1945
@KenCalvert We deserve to have our money spent on better things than a wall - like cybersecurity and care for our abused elderly!
@funder Corporate America has totally caved!

@brianstelter Say no!
@politico Sick of it! Let 'em all fight it out and when the dust settles, we'll still get our oil!
@thehill No need to broadcast that &amp; i hope they don't!
@RepByrne @HouseGOP What's the matter with you? We don't need a $5 billion wall! Spend the money on cybersecurity or care for our thousands of abused elderly!

@funder @DearAuntCrabby Exactly!
@realDonaldTrFan MbConnell is from Kentucky. Enough said.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn Solve the issue - DO NOT BUILD A WALL!
@realDonaldTrump Don't bother! There is no national security crisis! You're getting to be really irritating!
@nytimes This is gonna be tricky!
@cvpayne Someone convince me why everyone shouldn't pay the same flat rate on income - no exemptions, deductions, bells, whistles or BS.
@realDonaldTrump What's the matter with you? Better places to spend $5 billion! Try cybersecurity for one. Or how about ending the terrible abuse of our elderly! SHAME!
@realDonaldTrump Yeah. Right. Don't hold your breath.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump All of the above!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Worried about security? Spend that $5 billion on cybersecurity!
@GOP @PressSec Far better ways to protect our country than a wall! Spend 5 billion on cybersecurity!
@thehill Yeah, let's worry about vocabulary while real Americans are really suffering. Jerk!
@RashidaTlaib @detroitnews That's right! Sick of Republican greed and immorality!
@RepMikeLevin @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Exactly!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Their liberal bias can be irritating sometimes.
@kayleighmcenany @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Lies, damn lies, and statistics!
@SenatorRomney @MittRomney Grow a pair, Mitt. Times are changing and we're sick of Republican immorality and greed!
@thehill Not impressed.
@RandPaul Let's get out of this stupid mindset that our border needs to be "defended!"
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne Glad you're taking on China, but "HERO" doesn't mean much nowadays. Way overused.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/nv9KhKx3L5
@goldengateblond @DearAuntCrabby Can't happen soon enough!
@realDonaldTrump @jairbolsonaro No we're not! What the hell is wrong with you?
@realDonaldTrump Nor will there be a replacement for the fact that walls don't work!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS No wall! Better places to spend 5 billion $$$! Cybersecurity for one. We are so far behind! SHAME!
@realDonaldTrump No! 5 billion dollars are better spent elsewhere! Thousands of elderly Americans suffer terrible abuse every day! $$$ should be spent on nursing home staff and training! SHAME!
@realDonaldTrump No! We don't need a wall! They'll just hop on a boat and land in Mississippi or Florida!
Too bad I'm retired and spend 30% of my income on healthcare and you want 5 billion on an unnecessary wall! Shame! https://t.co/quWCB2HD0P
