@SuFord7 @DenverChannel Don‚Äôt really care what friends drafted letter. It was signed by 65 friends at the time on Friday following the original release. That should have come out 8 weeks earlier from Feinstein..
@SuFord7 @DenverChannel I would take anything from news sights both liberal like raw story and conservative with a grain of salt. They did not talk to all 65 and only two would go on record...
@SuFord7 @DenverChannel Wow you really like grasping at straws. But hey I‚Äôll play along. Youthful shenanigans could mean any hundreds of things that are totally harmless. I would not consider an alleged attack of a woman youthful shenanigans. Also, the mrs Hume referenced is one of the 65 signers.
@SuFord7 @DenverChannel Good glad you know how to link. Now try reading and researching and you could find out when the 65 women signed the letter. According to one of the signers in the article, It was the Friday after Feinstein released hers on Thursday. Have a great day!
