NEW: Judge Jackson puts the Roger Stone gag order in writing. Here’s a screenshot of the most important part. https://t.co/HjpysNkSqK
Hearing adjourned. Stone is not going to jail. But he won't be talking about the case anymore. Nor will his surrogates. He can send emails to raise money and say he's pleading not guilty. But that's about it.
Judge Jackson says any more mess ups and Stone may be sent to jail. "I want to be clear today. I gave you a second chance. But this is not baseball. There will not be a third chance."
Judge Jackson in backing up the gag order, which limits Stone from speaking at all about the case: "So no, Mr. Stone I'm not giving you another chance. I have serious doubts about whether you've learned any lesson at all."
Judge Jackson gags Roger Stone.
Judge Jackson notes Stone is charged for witness intimidation. Says his release "poses a danger" to the community. Decision TK.
Judge Jackson not taking Stone's apology. Says it looks like it came from his lawyers: “So thank you, but the apology rings quite hollow.”
Judge Jackson: "There's nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.”
Judge Jackson is giving Roger an earful.
"All rise" We are back in session.
Still in recess: Stone seated and chatting with his lawyers while we wait for Judge Jackson.
Judge Jackson adjourns for 15-minute recess and will come back with her decision. "I'm going to take a break to try to absorb this," she says.
DOJ prosecutor Jonathan Kravis is now urging Judge Jackson to slap a gag order on Stone.
Rogow says Stone's conditions for release shouldn't be changed. This is a "lesson" Stone has learned. “This is the only thing that has come up, that’s caused him and all of us, that brings us to the court...this afternoon."
Stone says he didn't realize the crosshairs was in the photo until he got a call from a reporter.
US asst attorney Jonathan Kravis finished with his questions of Stone.
Stone can't say who had his phone on Monday. "My house is like a headquarters. I have many volunteers." Judge Jackson, "I thought you said you had 5." Stone replies, "5 is a lot for coming and going."
Judge Jackson and Mueller prosecutors pushing Stone to explain his other media statements, to InfoWars and others, about the Instagram post.
Stone says he's asked his volunteers who was it who got the at-issue image. "Nobody will own up to it," he says.
Stone says he had multiple images of the judge on his phone: "I erased all the images of your honor because I didn’t’ want to make the same mistake twice."
Stone: "I recognize that I let the court down. I let you down. I let myself down. I let my family down. I let my attorneys down. I can only say I'm sorry. it was a momentary lapse in judgement. Perhaps I talk too much."
Stone: "I am kicking myself over my own stupidity but not more than my wife is kicking me.”
Roger Stone is taking the witness stand.
Rogow says he's OK with Stone being questioned by Mueller/DOJ and by the judge. He'll be under oath.
Judge Jackson reads from Stone lawyers' initial brief opposing gag order, asks, "How exactly does he pursue his livelihood?"
Rogow: He wants to put Stone on the stand to explain himself. Judge Jackson says she'll let him do that.
Judge Jackson asks Rogow to stay at the lectern. Shows him Exhibit 1, the Stone Instagram post.
"All rise" - the Roger Stone hearing has begun. Judge Amy Berman Jackson takes her seat.

Too funny. The live feed for Roger Stone's hearing has just come back on - showing us an empty courtroom. Good news though for next time.
Stone didn't speak much during the hearing. One exception, he replied, "Yes, your honor" after Judge Jackson asked if he understood the rules restricting him from contacting any potential witnesses via phone, email, Instagram or through any intermediary.
Asst US attorney says he sees Roger Stone trial taking place "somewhere in the fall," maybe October. Judge Jackson said she was thinking July or August, "I'm not saying the fall is unreasonable." Scheduling will depend on defense's review of discovery, pre-trial motions, etc.
More Judge Jackson: She said a gag order if she issues one wouldn't stop everyone from discussing other non-trial topics like "immigration, foreign relations or Tom Brady."
Hello, we're back from the courtroom. Judge Jackson said she's considering a gag order on Stone and will make a decision after getting briefs from both sides due next Friday, 2/8.

Judge Sullivan tries to put the treason topic back in the bottle. "Don't read too much into the questions I asked. I'm not suggesting he committed treason."
"Please be seated. This honorable court is back in session." Judge Sullivan is back at the bench.
We are 10 minutes past the recess's scheduled end. Still no Judge Sullivan. Flynn leaning back in his seat at the defense table, with one finger on his lip. His attorney Robert Kelner is reading a document.
My colleague @joshgerstein points out to me I mistakenly said people are milling around in the judge's chambers. They're in his courtroom. We obviously can't see into his chambers.
A federal judge poised to issue Michael Flynn’s sentence on Tuesday blasted the former Trump national security adviser for lying to the FBI and questioned whether special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors could have tried him for treason. @politico https://t.co/kLh8NKzaY1
Gen. Flynn has returned to the courtroom with his attorneys. Still waiting for the recess to end.
People are milling around in Judge Sullivan's chambers right now during the recess. I can see van Grack and Zainab Naeem Ahmad talking together at the prosecution table. Flynn's table remains empty.
Judge Sullivan has recessed Flynn's sentencing hearing until 12:30 p.m. to give Flynn and his lawyers a chance to rethink everything that's been discussed so far today w/ respect to postponing this entire proceeding.
Judge Sullivan asks Mueller prosecutors if Flynn could have been indicted for treason. Van Grack replies, "That was not something we were considering at the time, charging the defendant."
Judge Sullivan: "All along you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the national security adviser of the president of the United States. ... Arguably that undermines everything that flag over here stands for. Arguably, you sold your country out."
Judge Sullivan again offering Flynn a chance to push off today's sentencing until his cooperation is over. “Do you want to postpone this and come back at some later point and I don’t know what that point will be. That’s fine with me.”
Mueller prosecutor van Grack says Flynn played a cooperative role (and could have been indicted) in the case unsealed Monday against 2 former business partners who were charged with failing to register as foreign agents as they covertly lobbied on behalf of Turkey.
“This is a very serious offense,” Judge Sullivan said, noting Flynn’s crime involved a high-ranking official of the government making false statements to the FBI “while on the physical premise of the White House.”
Mueller prosecutor Brandon van Grack, when asked by the judge if Flynn is still helping the special counsel, “It remains a possibility that Gen. Flynn is continuing to cooperate at this point.”
Judge Sullivan stumbles in pronouncing POTUS's Mar-a-Lago club when ticking through the facts of Flynn's guilty plea.
Judge Sullivan sends Flynn and his attorneys back to their seats as he now turns to talking about the initial guilty plea.
Judge Sullivan once again runs through with Flynn whether he wants to w/d his guilty plea. Again, Flynn says, "I would like to proceed your honor." And the judge announces he'll accept the plea.
Judge Sullivan said he had some "concerns" based on Flynn's pre-sentencing filing. ”I cannot recall any incident in which the court has accepted a plea of guilty from someone who maintained he was not guilty and I don’t intend to start today.”
Judge Sullivan offers Flynn a chance to postpone this sentencing hearing to rethink his guilty plea. Flynn replies, "“I appreciate that, but no your honor.”
Judge Sullivan asking Flynn whether he wants to change his guilty plea in light of 302s and other new info. He has declined.
Judge Sullivan notes he's not the original judge who took Flynn's guilty plea. The also says to the lawyers to let him know if he accidentally broaches sealed info. "I don’t want to unintentionally say something that something that should not be revealed on the public docket."
"All rise." And the Flynn sentencing is underway. Judge Sullivan takes his seat at the bench.
Reporting from the DC Courthouse media room, where we can watch and listen to the live proceedings. Flynn is seated between his attorneys Robert Kelner &amp; Stephen Anthony at a wooden table. Across from them are Mueller prosecutors Brandon van Grack &amp; Zainab Naeem Ahmad.

Here’s my scorecard after sitting for jury verdict in 9th floor courtroom in Manafort trial. N/v = mistrial. https://t.co/tV16iTJqZj
Manafort guilty on eight counts: 2010-14 false tax filings;failing to file 2012 foreign bank account report and two bank fraud counts. Judge Ellis declares mistrial on other 10 counts.
Headed back in for the next Manafort jury note. Goodbye phone. https://t.co/bj0QurrHv6
The jury faces plenty of constraints as they consider Manafort’s guilt or innocence. They can’t Google anything. Phoning a friend is strictly verboten. They don’t even have immediate access to the 2,500 pages of transcripts from the trial. https://t.co/vtwfjfirqf @politico
"Bottom line, the trial lawyers may be posturing in offering their theories, but they don't have any better idea what the length of the deliberations signifies than does a random law student who has not even followed the trial.” https://t.co/vtwfjfirqf @politico
Others say a jury needs one hour for each count. By that calculation, the jury examining 18 counts would be done around today. https://t.co/vtwfjfirqf  @politico
Some legal experts say a jury can take a day for each day of the trial. Under that scenario, the jury that heard 12 days of arguments and testimony would be done on Aug. 31, assuming they keep deliberating at this current pace.  https://t.co/vtwfjfirqf @politico
Among seasoned legal experts, the length of time the jurors are taking in the Manafort case really surprises no one. https://t.co/vtwfjfirqf @politico
Ellis also got upset again at reporters racing out of room to file stories and instructed the US Marshall deputies to block the door while he worked through how to handle the jury note. He did recess for a moment though, allowing me and dozens more out. https://t.co/fJ3cb9eafL https://t.co/oHXLdrTvP7
Ellis also said this kind of not wasn’t uncommon in jury trials. He indicated he would not yet press the jurors to say where they stood in their deliberations.  https://t.co/fJ3cb9eafL https://t.co/T9hapF7u0s
Update from Alexandria: Jurors sent a brief note to Judge T.S. Ellis III for help on what to do if they couldn’t reach consensus on specific counts and what it means for the entire verdict. He replied he would urge them to redouble their efforts. https://t.co/fJ3cb9eafL https://t.co/gJaxs3GcCz

But since who remembers phone numbers anymore I had to look up @politico in an old White Pages. No one answered the number listed. Called 4-1-1, which does still exist. But it’s not free anymore. Then I ran out of quarters. Yeah, I did want to scream “Get me the copy desk!” 2/2

Weissmann added, “Some of the media accounts question the legitimacy of the Special Counsel’s investigation, tending to advance the opinion that the investigation is ‘tainted’ &amp; therefore its results are suspect.” https://t.co/vJE59IFVb8
“The reporting, at times inaccurately, comments on the nature of the evidence collected in the case or activities of the parties,” Andrew Weissmann, one of Mueller’s lead prosecutors, wrote, noting it had found 1000s of media references to the probe. ⁦ https://t.co/vJE59IFVb8

“Hope was a trusted adviser to the president,” former WH press secretary Sean Spicer said. “It’ll obviously have a big impact.” https://t.co/H50JTXVWNq @politico
