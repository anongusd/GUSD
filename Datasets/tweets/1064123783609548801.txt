@realDonaldTrump who gives a shit about this? Please just give us free healthcare, clean air and clean water! #AmericaFirst
@realDonaldTrump yes, please make it even cheaper to turn the earth into an inhabitable mess. Let me know when you invest a penny in renewables.
@ENERGY @LosAlamosNatLab but why do you keep ignoring the solid science on the terrible effects of #CarbonPollution ?
@EPA no wonder you can't find good candidates. Nobody wants to work hard only for their science to be censored. WE WANT A REAL EPA!
@USDOT high speed rail would really help a lot of people to travel. #YesWeCan
@VP @Space_Station @JimBridenstine @Space_Station @ISS_Research @NASA why don't you start taking the science coming out of there seriously? #CarbonPollution
@USTreasury what about the freshly constructed US-Russian-Saudi illicit network?
@USDA virtually all of these lived in horrific conditions and brutally murdered. Would not wish this treatment on our worst enemies. #AnimalWelfare
@realDonaldTrump your policy is more like #ArmageddonFirst
@NickKristof This is a false dichotomy. A person can be both a war hero and a partisan.
@WhiteHouse @RepWesterman why not pardon all turkeys? #AnimalWelfare
@senorrinhatch sadly turned into: "government of corruption, by gerrymandering, for personal profit"
@RepByrne does not really hold true anymore with all of the gerrymandering going around.
@HuffPost @RepRoKhanna How do you define monopoly? Since when is "Big Pharma" a single economic entity?
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @TeamCavuto There are many places in the world with a strict rule of law, way more than the US. What makes America unique are the constitution and bill of rights. Go back to Civics class, dear congressman.
@SenSchumer @HUDgov Can't believe we still are having these issues in 2018. When did we become a third world country?
