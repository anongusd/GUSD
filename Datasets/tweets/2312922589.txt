@apostlelaurind4 And under that constitution, even non-Americans, non-citizens, are guaranteed due process. The President saying we should deport people without due process is a violation of the constitution. Not saying deportations can‚Äôt happen, bet even undocumented people deserve due process.
@apostlelaurind4 Due process is not deporting people without hearings or judgements. Don‚Äôt know why your choosing to argue with the constitution itself, it‚Äôs right there in the 14tj amendment. Read it for yourself, it says persons, not citizens. The American constitution governs America,
