There are 33 counties in New Mexico. We tend to focus on the large ones when registering voters, but the smaller ones need attention too. We are in Valencia county, south of ABQ, to register voters at UNM‚Äôs campus. Wish us luck.	#voteordie https://t.co/h3oIHtHV3E

Janet Bridgers https://t.co/UcueyQQaBI via @YouTube 	When you work on a documentary that wins an Emmy, you know how to do it. Vote for the Bond Issue. Fill out that ballot and mail it back. We can do it. Vote, or Die.
Antoinette Sedillo L¬¢pez https://t.co/DQwG3brn6X via @YouTube	Thanks Senator. The Bond Issue is important. We are voting by mail. Vote, or Die, said some T-shirt.
The clerks office has estimated that 40,000 ballots have been returned for the APS Bond Issue. We are doing well.

It says something about someone who gets a seat in the New Mexico State Senate, and takes the time to advocate for another cause. Thanks Senator Antoinette Sedillo Lopez		https://t.co/gSpQPKGyzm
ABQ NM schools are looking to fully fund their schools--and using a bond issues to do it. We need a good education system--it is the foundation of democracy. Will we choose the future? We should. 	https://t.co/hXvwrHt3ch
A free and good public education is a foundation of democracy. Albuquerque, NM is having a school bond issue. Will we choose to go back to the future, and fully fund schools? Will we believe that our kids need a good education? We should. Vote or Die.	https://t.co/Jf4e4bSbQl

Since it is clear that we cannot go on as we are, let's make a big jump: Age, education, veteran, Midwestern, Harvard educated Mayor, who speaks in whole paragraphs. WE decide by voting. We can't keep doing the same things and expect a different outcome. 	https://t.co/vPCZOoWp3J

@Chas10Buttigieg Toby was around for 15 years and 4 months. He wanted me to only throw the ball, and feed him. He liked the front seat of a truck. He judged me, but only in theory. Long live Toby. https://t.co/uho7Cw3iIl
If you are a person with an elite education, and you are comfortable, and confident, and have had some amount  of success, don't waste it. Reach down, and help people like this. Register voters, help out. You, as one person, can make a huge difference. 	https://t.co/G7AMByZhUx
As we get MORE Democrats signing up to run for President, we will hear..something. Here is a major problem. Which candidate can tell us how they can fix this? How do we provide an economy where millennials can catch up? They deserve a chance. Anyone? 		https://t.co/1tytAdm9RZ
For now. NO ONE had heard of Barack Obama at this point either. You have to earn EVERYTHING. We can do it. https://t.co/kZndJie1id
@PeteButtigieg This will be good to scale, like for a country.
@PeteButtigieg I have lived in 4 parts of the country: Midwest, New England, NYC, and ABQ. Here is a truth  that you learn. All parts of the country are great, in their way, and you find home where you are. Don't let anyone define you, define yourself. Fight for the little guy. Or just fight.
Boom. And we are off. Welcome to 2019, the "Year of a Thousand Democratic Party Candidates For President." Fab.		https://t.co/xSfEExd4Ur https://t.co/0GctVzjTnh
Yeah, so I was busy registering voters, and helping candidates, and I got a VERY late start on Christmas, and my tree totally suffered, but a group, "Gay Fix Christmas Trees," pulled up in a brand new Subaru, and fixed everything. They were great. Happy Holiday. https://t.co/iJCmI7cidE

If you would like to become more involved in local Democratic politics, a good place to start is to run for your states State Central Committee. Every state has one,  and you are elected out of your ward or precincts, then through the county. Call them. 	https://t.co/3OaWGUQZ1r
Great idea for YOUR Christmas tree, VOTE decorations. We are all voters now, all the time. Happy Holidays. https://t.co/gY4Cneccj4
Do you have some affiliation to an educational system, a high school, or a college that could do this? They registered 1,200 voters. They engaged 70% of the entire student body. Everybody Votes has a new mission. 		https://t.co/WOeyRSK6xD

The greatest Christmas tree, ever. Happy Holidays from everyone at Everybody Voters. https://t.co/KuKWjGvMwo
Always time to register voters. We registered a handful, and the weather was beautiful, and it was our first registration drive since the election. We have to concentrate--registering young voters is like having capital in the bank. You can register them too. https://t.co/aIyUBZTqAe

Gays rule. I am interested to hear Mrs. Bollier say, "I can't be complicit." Interesting choice of words. But she, as a State Senator, struck a blow for gay rights. In Kansas. 	https://t.co/ieQyWqTRAM
The 2020 Presidential Primary is underway. We have a huge cast, and a new calendar. Where do you win or lose the Democratic primary, and grab the brass ring that is the Democratic nomination for President? 	https://t.co/KXbmVlalOP
The Democrats did great in the mid-terms, but we have to continue. New Mexico has 200,000 eligible, but unregistered voters statewide. We HAVE to get them registered. 		Voter registration statistics by county, New Mexico. 		https://t.co/8Jzt3YwGuw
What are the next steps, now that the mid terms are over? I did a back of the envelope calculation, and we have, in New Mexico, about 200,000 eligible voters, who are unregistered. That is a lot of vote. We need a plan to get all of these folks registered. https://t.co/uWNOTpAwtI
If you are in NM, and want to run for the State Central Committee, here is an good explanation of how Wards and Precincts work, from the Valencia County Democrats, a county south of ABQ. 		https://t.co/HKiMln6E6i
Yeah, voting can be useful everywhere:		"40 percent of a company‚Äôs board seats would be elected by employees. Germany uses a version of this ‚Äúshared-governance‚Äù model, mostly successfully. ."		https://t.co/Goeqda5waz
If you would like to become part of your states Central Committee, now is the time. The Democratic State Central Committee is the body that governs Democrats statewide. The 2 top Democrats, the Chair and the Vice Chair, automatically have votes at DNC. 		https://t.co/3OaWGUQZ1r
ACT-UP lead the way when a generation of gay guys were engulfed in an epidemic. The Aids Coalition To Unleash Power was run by gay citizens, who had to organize to save themselves and the people they loved. It worked. It is a model for what to do today. https://t.co/o8ug6D2jxh
If you are in New Mexico, and you would like to run for the State Central Committee, the statewide committee that elects Des Leadership in NM, we have dates: 		WARD meetings- March 23 	Bernalillo County Mtg-April 6th	State Central Committee- April 27	Watch this feed for more. https://t.co/dD4ujXhdXa
These are great, and are packed with information. One for each state. 		https://t.co/txx94d7BvI
Here are some tips about how to register voters. This is how I do it, but find what works for you. Try and do it regularly, so that people will know where to go to register--consistency will raise your yield. 	https://t.co/NqW0sj2pGN
Mike Espy did not prevail in Mississippi, but take heart. We need to register voters there, as we need to everywhere. Here is a chart showing the number of kids turning 18--Mississippi has its share. Register voters, and everything else will take care of itself. https://t.co/gsxdBKkk4M
A lot of people gave a lot to register voters in Mississippi. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were murdered during Freedom Summer--they were in Mississippi to register voters. So, if you can vote in the special Senate race tomorrow, you should. Go Mike Espy. https://t.co/TcJPkOFYTr

Here is breakdown of some counties in New Mexico, and how well their voters turned out. A quick breakdown: Bernalillo County, which contains ABQ, did okay, with 57% turnout. Harding only has about 700 people in the whole county. We are a huge state, with a total of 33 counties. https://t.co/7XHmSm3WPF
Everybody Votes reports on voting, voter registration, and how we can get the young to do more of both. We are clear: We need to increase voting rates across the country. One of our co-founders spoke to "Generation Justice," about our mission: 		https://t.co/WrF6tbwH8g
I have anecdotal evidence that social media put pressure on millennials to vote, since I have a family member who called me, and wanted to know where to go to vote. She early voted, because the pressure was intense on social media from her peers.		https://t.co/EBKO5b7uo5

If we could get voter rates up to 70% across the country, for EVERY election, no one would recognize the country. We need to increase our rates of voting, everywhere. San Francisco did it. 		https://t.co/d8PToUGXRQ
Tufts University has a group following the young voter closely. You should like their page, and follow them. The future is young, and we need to get them registered, and voting. 		https://t.co/S1BOA0shNf
If you are wondering what comes next, after the election, look at this chart. We have 4 million kids turning 18. Tufts University has shown that 67% of all new voters this cycle voted Democratic. So, register these kids. Anywhere and everywhere you can.		https://t.co/NqW0sj2pGN https://t.co/NBB2Ebm8RO
