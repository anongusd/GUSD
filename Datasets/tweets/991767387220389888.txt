Remember that, bitch
Instead, beauty lies in who you are when no one is watching. No amount of concealer can cover up a cantankerous heart, but all the make-up in the world can’t add a single lumen to the brightness of a beautiful soul.
A beautiful person is not defined by a hair style, a pair of shoes, it’s not the logos on the T-shirt, the sport’s team on a hat, the designer’s name on a hand bag, or even how you smell.
The best way to avoid disappointment is to not expect anything from anyone.	#profacts #helpfultips #TheMoreYouKnow

What is your definition of #freethinking?
@charliekirk11 I really hope you can make a difference. We need unity...not separation.
@charliekirk11 If you were really a free thinker, you would try to reason with people of other opinions instead of just seeing them as a label and totally writing them off from the start.
@charliekirk11 If anything, you would fall under “close minded”, meaning not willing to try new things or consider other opinions.
@charliekirk11 What is your definition of “free thinking”? Because free thinking means a person who thinks freely or independently. One who forms opinions on the basis of reason independently of authority. I don’t really get that vibe from you guys.
