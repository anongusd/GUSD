@charliekirk11 @LindseyGrahamSC He put his misogyny on full display. More than being a responsible senator, he jumped in to defend a nominee who had just put his partisanship and grudge against a particular political party on full public display. @LindseyGrahamSC refuses to do his job.
@LindseyGrahamSC I thought you were the one yelling. That you don't give a rat's ass about voters is not exactly anything new.
@WillieGeist @Morning_Joe That‚Äôs not really relevant anymore. Their job is to consider him for SCOTUS. In the hearing he unveiled his partisanship. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he did what Ford claims or not after that ‚Äì a good senator cannot approve such a partisan judge.
@SenAlexander So it doesn't matter to you that he spent his opening statement putting his biased partisanship on full display? That he holds a grudge against a particular political party? How can that not be significant if it's important to you that the highest court in the land is impartial?
@thehill He appears to suffer from selective amnesia. The worst political ploy ever was one he himself took full part in when he and his GOP colleagues refused Merrick Garland a fair process in order to hijack his seat on the Supreme Court.
@senrobportman So what you're saying with that is that you will support a nominee who has just in a public hearing exposed his partisanship and his grudge against a particular political party. That means you're willing to not do your job. Shameful.
@realDonaldTrump I agree. We did see why you nominated him. He showed his partisanship. He is clearly not an independent impartial judge, and can therefore not be confirmed. I'm glad you're finally sorta candid about that.

@AveryChasten @FoxNews Sorry my friend, I won‚Äôt stop having opinions on America. You just have to live with that. The rest of the world has opinions on you. It‚Äôs better for your health, I think, if you don‚Äôt get worked up over it.
@AveryChasten @FoxNews Lowest GDP would be an economic disaster. High GDP is what you want. Your stock market is, despite last week‚Äôs slide, at record highs, that is true. Which btw is great for our oil fund too, since we own shitloads of US stocks. Unemployment low, yes, crime not so much.
@AveryChasten I‚Äôm happy to rebut this slander piece if you like, but it would have to be through other means than Twitter. Up to you.
@AveryChasten @FoxNews That‚Äôs one man‚Äôs opinion. I agree with the drugs and alcohol problems,  but disagree very much about things like identity crisis. That foreigners to most of the "dirty work" is just false. I‚Äôm surprised he doesn‚Äôt mention infrastructure, though.
@AveryChasten @FoxNews If you‚Äôre happy with the state of your country, then I have to say you have a very low bar considering the potential you guys have. And if you don‚Äôt like my opinions you‚Äôre very welcome to just ignore them.

@rsshootinggirl @jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz In your world view I‚Äôm sure there isn‚Äôt. And don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt be able to take that away from you. You think assault weapons don‚Äôt exist despite evidence to the contrary, which you are entitled to. I choose to follow the evidence and accept that they do.
@rsshootinggirl @jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz 58, my friend. Look it up. 59 dead including the perp. Amongst the over 20 guns he used we find assault weapons equipped with bump fire stocks, effectively making them assault rifles.
@rsshootinggirl @jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz Again I refer to the Vegas shooting. There are tons of examples, but one suffices to render your claim about statistics proven wrong. Have a good day (sincerely) :-)
@rsshootinggirl @jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz Tell that to the 58 bereaved families of the Vegas shooting, to name just one example. If you believe assault weapons and assault rifles don‚Äôt exist in the US, you refuse to acknowledge an obvious reality. That means further discussion with you is sadly unproductive.
@toehole @GOP Right, because the choice between having health care and not having health care is such a brain tease.. But I agree Obamacare is broken and needs to be replaced by a better system.
@TrumplicanPA @GOP Which is great, for the 10 years they last. But it doesn't help the millions of Americans working low-wage jobs enough to improve their lives. Plus, it blows yet another hole in the deficit.
@rsshootinggirl @jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz 2. Definition of assault rifle, courtesy of Merriam-Webster: ¬´any of various intermediate-range, magazine-fed military rifles that can be set for automatic or semiautomatic fire.¬ª
@rsshootinggirl @jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz 1. Only federally licenced sellers are required to run background checks. But not all private sellers need a licence, and they can avoid running checks. They usually sell at gun shows. That‚Äôs the loophole.
@GOP Love how you guys try to sell this notion that you're giving people these bigger-than-bigly pay raises while you at the same time refuse to ensure tens of millions of Americans a #LivingWage. #GOPHypocrisy
@jenb_81112 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz My personal view is that the entire 2nd is such a piece of crap. But realistically speaking I'm talking something as simple as universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole and banning assault weapons. Common sense ideas.
@VP 3 million is an impressive number. Of course, it would be more like 30 million if you had just raised the minimum wage to a #LivingWage.
@seanhannity No, @seanhannity, this is one individual being an ass. Doesn't mean all of CNN thinks the same way. Like when you spew out your bullshit, it doesn't mean everybody at Fox is just as clueless.
