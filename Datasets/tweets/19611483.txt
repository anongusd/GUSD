Mrs. Wright on how to be successful &amp; maintain marriage &amp; family: The secret is, communicate &amp; manage expectations within your families about what you need from each other, where you’re going, &amp; what you want to achieve to make sure you are on the same place. #ASC18
#CMSAF on how to be successful &amp; maintain marriage &amp; family: Communication is the key. Maybe reading the 5 Love Languages, understanding what type of love your spouse appreciates will be helpful. Making sure you have alignment is key -- communication &amp; love languages. #ASC18
.@CSAF21Spouse: I love the unique culture we have a as a #military, how the spouses take care of each other, &amp; how we take care of other families we meet along the way. Enjoy the journey. Enjoy the adventure b/c one day it will come to an end &amp; we’ll miss it dearly.
.@SecAFOfficial on how to be successful &amp; maintain marriage &amp; family: Humor is underrated in relationships. Being able to laugh about the things in life that get goofed up or when things become stressful, is really helpful.
.@GenDaveGoldfein on how to be successful &amp; maintain marriage &amp; family: Be present when you’re off work and spending that quality time. It’s the most important thing we have to give to our children and spouses.

.@GenDaveGoldfein: It's time to build on the foundational work accomplished over the past year to prepare ourselves for the fight that is coming. We must begin by strengthening each echelon of command to contribute to &amp; lead #multidomain operations against a peer adversary #ASC18

We apologize for the earlier tweet regarding the A-10. It was made in poor taste and we are addressing it internally. It has since been removed.
.@GenDaveGoldfein on RPA pilots: By building up our numbers, increasing the crew ratio to 10:1, we’ve been able to increase dwell time &amp; quality of life for these #Airmen.
.@SecAFOfficial: We sent a joint letter to governors that highlighted 2 things we’ll take into account when we do basing decisions...quality schools for children &amp; #reciprocity of licensure for spouses/family members of military members. This is what matters to our #Airmen.
.@SecAFOfficial: We’ve pushed authorities down to program managers so they spend more time managing their programs &amp; less time managing the Pentagon.
.@SecAFOfficial: We need a near real-time picture of everything that is happening in #space--a global network for security of our space assets in a contested environment.

.@SecAFOfficial: I used to be the head of a science &amp; engineering university; freshman students were always afraid to fail--they needed to learn to productively fail. It’s about finding out what doesn’t work sometimes--learning to figure out the path toward success.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: We’re investing in research &amp; development now to determine what comes after the #F35, so we can maintain the competitive advantage over our adversaries into the future.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: When it comes to Russia &amp; China’s production of fifth-gen aircraft, today, we enjoy an advantage. But, we’re watching their aircraft production &amp; attempts to take that edge away very closely. #Defense
.@GenDaveGoldfein on pilot shortage: this is a national-level challenge; the nation doesn’t produce enough pilots for commercial &amp; military aviation requirements. We have 69 retention initiatives to incentivize our pilots to stay, but ultimately it’s about quality of service.
.@SecAFOfficial: We’ve directed a complete review to look at career progression of #space operators. Want to make sure they have opportunities for career development. We expect it to be complete in 60 days. We’ll look at those recommendations to help with retention.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: The #USAF is investing in hypersonic technology, working in partnership w/the @USArmy &amp; @USNavy, to look for smart commonalities that bring the best technology to bear &amp; save on costs.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: We are acutely aware that every dollar we’re given is a dollar that was earned by Americans &amp; it is our solemn obligation to remain good stewards of those dollars.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: A return to the disastrous budget caps of BCA in 2020 would repeat the damage caused by the 2013 sequester; w/help from #Congress, we can avoid a return to BCA &amp; continue building on our current momentum w/on-time appropriations.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: Ten years of maintenance experience lost cannot be gained overnight, but this budget builds the foundation for full recovery. #FY19
.@GenDaveGoldfein: With this budget, we begin restoring pilot proficiency to 21 hours per month in #FY19. Pilots join to fly &amp; this budget gets them back into the air. #Airpower

.@SecAFOfficial: We are executing on nuclear research faster -- we’ll keep that momentum going. #SASC #USAF
.@SecAFOfficial: Certainty allows us to work with industry to maximize production and sign contracts more efficiently. The FY19 budget brings us certainty with industry. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: Nothing has done more damage to the #USAF than budget uncertainty and sequestration. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: We are increasing our space information capabilities. If anything is moving we will be able to protect our assets in space. #SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein:The next light attack experiment @HollomanAFB will be different in 3 ways: 1. A deeper look at sustainment &amp; mx 2. A focus on integrating allies &amp; partners &amp; 3. Asking how we can integrate this airframe with a lower price point per flying hour. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: We have a science &amp; tech strategic review underway to determine where the #USAF needs to go in the future &amp; to guide us in our research. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: The #space Rapid Capabilities office is looking at how we buy satellite systems. We will strengthen that office to drive forward development to get that capability to combatant commanders. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: #USAF is the best in #space &amp; our adversaries know it. #SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein in response to pilot shortage: we are increasing pilot production, increasing retention through quality of service &amp; quality of life initiatives &amp; continuing to look at the data that drives the requirements for pilots who do the nation’s business. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: This budget reflects an alignment in American leadership. We are building a more lethal &amp; more agile force. #SASC
@SecAFOfficial: To address the pilot shortage we are: 1. Validating requirements, 2. Retaining the pilots we have by increasing quality of life &amp; reducing operations tempos &amp; 3. Increasing the number of pilots we’re training. #SASC
.@SecAFOfficial: The threat is changing; we had to determine what we need to do in a contested environment to support the ground operators. #SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein: As stated in the National Defense Strategy, we are expected to project America’s #military power forward with our allies &amp; partners as we bring global vigilance, global reach &amp; global power to the joint team.#SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein: As #Airmen, we first defend the homeland &amp; our allies with a safe, secure &amp; effective nuclear deterrent. We are also expected to own the high ground with air &amp; space superiority. #SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein: This budget request allows our nation to confront today’s threats &amp; moves us toward the #USAF we need to face tomorrow’s challenges.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: Central to this effort was the perseverance, tenacity, &amp; leadership of Chairman @SenJohnMcCain, who is recovering today in AZ. We wish him &amp; his family our warmest regards as he takes on this latest challenge.
.@SecAFOfficial: Our responsibility is to be strategically predictable to our allies. We are stronger together than we are alone. #SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein: For the first time in years, we have a National Security Strategy, a National Defense Strategy, a Nuclear Posture Review &amp; the resources required to support them. #SASC
.@GenDaveGoldfein: For the first time in years, we have a strategy-driven budget instead of budget-driven strategy. #SASC

.@GenDaveGoldfein: Morale &amp; readiness of the force are inextricably linked. If we’re going to keep this force, our investment in improving readiness is one of the most important parts of this budget.
.@SecAFOfficial: Budget certainty is one of the most important things Congress can do for us. #Sequestration did much more damage to the #AirForce than anything our adversaries have done.
.@SecAFOfficial: Our biggest challenge with security clearances is getting them done in the first place. 79K people in the #USAF waiting to get clearances. We are partnering with OPM to work on the process, but it’s a major issue for all the services.
.@SecAFOfficial: One of the issues is the cost of sustainment of the aircraft. This is a joint aircraft, so the #AirForce, as the biggest customer, has a strong interest in continuing to drive down the cost of the #F35 parts &amp; to bring in competition.
.@SecAFOfficial: The overall priority in this budget is to align with the national defense strategy, we accelerate the move to defendable space, we shift to multi-domain operations and we continue to restore readiness.
.@SecAFOfficial: We often think about platforms. Almost everything flying today &amp; everything in space is a sensor. The trick is to fuse all of that data to give a comprehensive picture of what’s going on on the ground.
.@SecAFOfficial: A combatant commander wants eyes on. They don’t care where it comes from or what platform it’s on. What they need is information &amp; the site picture about what’s going on on the ground so we can win.
.@SecAFOfficial: While we make basing decisions based on the criteria we set &amp; try to be as open as possible, it was a great pleasure to make sure the 187th Fighter Wing Red Tails will have some #F35s to put red tails on. #TuskegeeAirmen
.@GenDaveGoldfein: When you’re on the ground, every second counts. I want to make sure that when the call comes in we’re there when needed &amp; they know it’s us when they hear the sound of freedom overhead. I see this as nothing short of a moral obligation.
.@SecAFOfficial: The FY18 budget would restart line for redoing A-10 wings &amp; would buy probably the first four sets of wings. FY19 budget has $80M for more wings. The #A10 is expected to stay in the inventory through 2040.
.@SecAFOfficial: We launched a year-long review to identify areas for the #AirForce to accelerate research in &amp; look at the way we do research.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: We’re looking at our level of investment in these new technologies, like hypersonics &amp; directed energy. We’re looking at ways we can put the most ressources against a problem to get the best possible end state out of them.
.@SecAFOfficial: This budget funds sustainment to 90%. One of the things that helps most with this workforce is certainty on the budget. We need to drive down the cost of sustainment by taking advantage of new technologies--there’s a tremendous opportunity for us going forward.
.@SecAFOfficial: This budget moves us faster toward jam-proof #GPS. The #USAF has been supplying GPS to the world for free--provided by squadron of less than 40 young people to a billion people every day. It’s an amazing capability &amp; we’re going to keep it ready every day.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: Light-attack is directly tied w/ building competitive space in a new era of competition to drive this violence down to a point where it can be managed by individual countries. When you think light-attack, think allies &amp; partners.
.@SecAFOfficial: Light-attack must be coalition at the core. This is all part of a strategy to deal with prospect of continued violent extremism &amp; is aligned with the National Defense Strategy.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: Pilot shortage is a national challenge--we as a nation don’t produce the number of pilots needed to adequately support all the commercial &amp; military requirements.
.@SecAFOfficial: It’s not about the pay, it’s about the quality of service and quality of life.
.@SecAFOfficial: No shortage of people who want to come in to be #AirForce pilots. The limiting factors are training and retention.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: In the most recent launch of the @SpaceX #DeltaHeavy we were side-by-side with a whole team of #Airmen during that launch--just another example of the Airmen &amp; industry #partnership.
.@SecAFOfficial: There are detailed areas where the FY19 #USAF budget is focused on space including space situational awareness, space control &amp; missile warning.
.@SecAFOfficial: We don’t always have the intellectual property to be able to manufacture parts needed even though a company may no longer be in business. We’re looking to really move forward in additive manufacturing and 3D parts printing. (2/2)
.@SecAFOfficial: If we want to drive down #USAF costs in terms of equipment we must focus on increased sustainment. (1/2)
.@GenDaveGoldfein: We’re working 66+ initiatives simultaneously, looking at both production &amp; retention going forward, to get us on a sustainable track for pilots going forward.
.@SecAFOfficial: We are too small for all the missions the nation is asking of us &amp; I worry we’re burning out our people with deployment rates that are just too hard to sustain over time.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: This budget supports the greatest treasure in our nation’s arsenal: our #Airmen &amp; their families.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: @usairforce budget request allows our nation to confront today’s threats &amp; moves us toward the #USAF we need to face tomorrow’s challenges. It builds on progress we’ll make in 2018 to restore readiness, increase lethality &amp; cost-effectively modernize
.@SecAFOfficial: This budget accelerates our efforts to deter, defend &amp; protect our ability operate in space.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: Our thousands of skilled &amp; dedicated civilians are vital to our @usairforce, to our industrial base &amp; to America’s security
.@GenDaveGoldfein: #Airmen participate in some way in every mission the joint force performs. We operate from below the surface to the outer reaches of space and everywhere in between.
.@GenDaveGoldfein: We remain a global power because of global mobility
.@GenDaveGoldfein: Let there be no doubt, your #Airmen stand ready to defend the homeland, deter nuclear conflict through nuclear readiness, own the high ground w/ air &amp; space superiority &amp; project global vigilance, reach &amp; power w/our joint teammates, allies &amp; partners
.@GenDaveGoldfein: It’s an honor for @SecAFOfficial &amp; I to represent 670K #Airmen today as we update you on the @usairforce &amp; our budget proposal for 2019
.@SecAFOfficial: #USAF is shifting to multi-domain ops--proposing to change how we do battle.
.@SecAFOfficial: #USAF has one continuing effort: to keep improving readiness of the force to win any fight anytime
.@SecAFOfficial: Accelerating defendable space: need to deter, defend &amp; prevail against anyone who tries to prevent our ability to freely operate in space
