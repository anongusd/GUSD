@DonaldJTrumpJr Wow...so you are saying you actually have knowledge of something?   I guess knowing about guns is better than nothing.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP No.  However, there is a reason for that.  Do you think we should say nice things about Stalin?  Does that make us partisan hacks?  The president and VP need to earn our respect every day, not expect it because of their office
@TPM Yea...cause he‚Äôs a racist
@TPM Yea....very few racists say that they are a racist.  But he is....
@samstein Sure....it‚Äôs okay to lie and be a racist in order to get into office.  Every child knows that...

@Jim_Jordan So you attack the person and do not dispute the facts relating to underlying behavior?   Also, what crime ha McCabe been convicted of?   You say these things as fact but it is from fact.
@realDonaldTrump Does Xi get his instructions from Putin as well?
@greta @RepCummings Greta, I don‚Äôt think that this is an irrelevant and superficial question (no matter what anyone says).  It‚Äôs what makes you a highly rated and must see journalist...what station will you be discussions the results of this scientific and well thought out poll.

@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel Oh....so does this mean you are worried that you are going to get swept up in the Epstein kiddie porn ring.  Some people are saying you were a frequent flying in the Epstein ring.   You need to prove that the people you hung out with aren‚Äôt pedophiles.  .
@LindseyGrahamSC @hughhewitt Really, are you gonna mention that Trump is rumored to be a John in the Epstein prostitution ring.
@senrobportman Did you get this talking point directly from Putin or did the White Goise launder Putin‚Äôs thoughts to you?   #whatdoesputinthink

@greta Because you are one of the causes of the current national problem. You probably don‚Äôt realize it and probably didn‚Äôt mean to be the cause but you are one of the causes.
@GlennKesslerWP @washingtonpost I think trump wants Putin to be the fact checker. #whatdoesputinthink
@greta Oh....new show.  Well I genuinely hope you do well.  I have heard you are a nice person.  But you need to work harder at the journalism thing (on air try to not ask leading questions and let the conversation go where the facts go).
@joshrogin Yea, but Putin likes it #whatdoesputinthink
@greta Oh.  Sorry. I am mistaken. Your on line bio must be wrong because it says you are FORMER MSNBC, CNN, Fox and NBC.  Are you referring to VOA (as a contributor)?

@greta Oh.  Sorry.  Not on air.  An error that was corrected.

@realDonaldTrump So your saying you, your campaign and your kids didn‚Äôt do the stuff that you, your campaign and your kids have admitted to?
@realDonaldTrump That means the crime rate will actually go up with fewer illegal immigrants and not go up.  The number of crimes will go down but the rate of crime will rise.  Just sayin 2/2
@realDonaldTrump Dear Dummy:  I know you were not a very good student and statistics but‚Ä¶ I assume you do understand that the ‚Äúcrime rate‚Äù is actually the number of crimes divided by the number of people.  Since illegal immigrant commit crimes at a ‚Äúrate‚Äù much lower than average 1/2

@realDonaldTrump You seem to forget that it‚Äôs the Trump Shutdown and it started when GOP controlled Congress.
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Landslide 45: by bringing down the crime rate do you mean fewer illegal aliens will be hired by Trump branded properties with your employees forging papers for the illegals?   If you mean that I hope so.
@DavidLimbaugh So when trump said ‚Äúcall it the trump shutdown‚Äù....again you are a smart person intentionally saying a mistruth which make you a liar.
@ThisWeekABC This is clearly an example of fake news which means it is actually accurate reporting.

@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs great that you are the founder of he ‚Äúyou too‚Äù movement.  You too abused women.

@brithume Well...let‚Äôs think about it.  What Gorka is doing is criminal and civil fraud, criminal and civil misappropriation of Fox‚Äôs trade name, logo and reputation, exposes Fox to civil and, depending upon what Gorka does, potentially criminal liability.  Other than than it‚Äôs cool.

@marcorubio Dear Senator NRA:  please find me the Bible verse that says it‚Äôs okay to take NRA money and vote to arm damaged children (yes the shooter was damaged) with weapons designed to kill with one shot.  Bible versus won‚Äôt save you or your soul.

@realDonaldTrump The last time I checked the FBI reports to you.  Stop fighting with them and help them do their job.  They knew of the shooter 5 months ago. How many times have you met with FBI and asked them to tell you about what they are doing to prevent gun violence?  i am guessing 0 times.
@marcorubio Dear Senator NRA...I live in the affected area.  I will be going to funeral starting tomorrow.  Will you be with me?  Do you have the guts to see what your ineffective representation has done to your community?  I doubt it.
@marcorubio How much did you take from the NRA?  You are bought and sold like a common whore.
@marcorubio Did you vote to make is easier for people with mental illness be able to get guns?  I think so.  Blood is on your hands.
@samstein Dumb Don did it because he is an idiot.
@Sht_Hapns @CrochetJanet Once again, he lied by omission for forgetting to mention that law enforcement was told about the shooter.
@Sht_Hapns @CrochetJanet Big difference.  Under Obama's watch he didn't fight with the FBI and distract them from doing their job.  FBI was told about the shooter 5 months ago.  Trump is president and is not doing everything he can to protect you and me.  	https://t.co/bdFbZVnNoA
@realDonaldTrump Dear Dumb Don,		You will be in Florida this weekend.  Funerals will be taking place this weekend.  How many are you going to?  These are your citizens.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Dumb Don,  The FBI was told and you are the president https://t.co/bdFbZVnNoA.  Instead of fighting with the FBI, how about doing your job and managing the FBI.  This was on your watch and YOU DROPPED THE BALL.  Blood on your hands.
@nytopinion The blood of our children is on their hands.
@marcorubio Did you take over $3 million from the NRA in the 2016 election cycle?  You are bought and paid for.  Please tell me why you are not a political whore?
@realDonaldTrump Did you sign a bill into law last year that makes it harder to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness?  You are a failure as a President and a man.  The blood of these children is on your hands.
@realDonaldTrump What did you do to manage the FBI find this person and prevent this event?  The social media stuff was in the public domain and his erratic behavior was noted at school.  Instead you decided to pick personal fights with the FBI.  You didn't do all you could.  You are responsible.
@marcorubio Great tweet.  Now, "Mr. Religious", what are you doing to protect my children.  What is your voting record on violence against women and reasonable gun control.  The answer is your rhetoric is much different than your votes.  You are a hypocrite.
@SenateMajLdr You are an embarassment to our nation and will go down in history as a weak leader lacking in character.

@realDonaldTrump No.  Not really.  They are both real and true. Did you have a mini stroke when you did the Jerusalem announcement?  Doctors are saying mini stroke.
@senrobportman Another brave position.  Just like your position on sexual predators serving in the highest levels of government and your position on tearing down our law enforcement and threatening criminal prosecution of political enemies.
@realDonaldTrump @seanspicer @daveweigel Dear Grandpa President 45:   Do you think that crowd size is a metaphor for hand size which is a metaphor for some other size.

@AnnCoulter Ann, you know better.  Think back to when you were in law school and wanted to do good.  It this the way you thought it would turn out.  Lying to cover for a child molester?
@IvankaTrump You don‚Äôt know what it means to be a Jew.  You attended a Hanukkah part where Dems and others that you‚Äôre Dad doesn‚Äôt like weren‚Äôt invited.  You should be ashamed.
@marcorubio You understand you have Jewish constituents, don‚Äôt you?
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Better is you hired Hispanics rather than immigrants to work at your resorts and golf courses.  Also, would be lower if you didn‚Äôt use slave labor in china.
@realDonaldTrump Did you have a stroke?  Not joking did you have a stroke when you did the Jerusalem announcement?  Have you run your last run and you are tired out?   Is it time to go home?
@Eugene_Scott Is there proof he said this.  Please post proof!!
@PalmerReport Seems like he had a TIA.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are an idiot

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS And you now support Roy Moore?  Have you no shame.
@senrobportman @nfib_oh And what about Roy Moore?  Also, you do know your statements about the tax bill are stuff you hope maybe true but aren‚Äôt true.
@marcorubio What is wrong with you.
@senrobportman So the NYTs says you were a principal architect of this.  You should be ashamed.
@IvankaTrump Is that where he is going to seek asylum and try to beat extradition?
@senrobportman You do know this wasn‚Äôt tax reform but a tax cut.   You do know the difference, don‚Äôt you?

@lisamurkowski And that has what to do with tax reform?
@realDonaldTrump @ABC Dear President 45 (who won by the biggest landslide ever and had the largest crowds at inaugural crowds ever): why did people believe Mr.  Ross?   Have you done anything that would make people want to believe that report?
@justinhendrix Why lock him up?  After all, he won the election by a landslide, had the largest crowds ever and has done more than any president ever.
@KellyannePolls @TheView @ABC Hey, how‚Äôs that Hatch Act investigation going?
@SenateMajLdr You are bought and paid for.  Of course you are enabling Trump.  You wife is one of Trumps cabinet secretaries.  Bought and paid for.

@morningmika Mika, you are right; you never have.  I wonder, however, why haven‚Äôt you ever commented on her training and qualifications for the job.  I feel you have given her a pass (for real).

@Slate I hear that President Landslide 45 also turned down every one of the Nobel Prizes, rejected being class President of his high school, didn't want to get into Penn when he was a Freshman (he was a bought and paid transfer student) and turned down an Oscar.  All, this year.

@MSNBC When are we going to say what the real problem is....he is 88 and has dementia
@Marshall_Cohen That fine.  The President and Putin said ‚Äúno collusion ‚Äú.  You need to listen to them and take their denial into account.  After all, if they don‚Äôt admit to collusion or other illegal activity it can‚Äôt have happened.
@realDonaldTrump Or maybe the golf thing is a ‚Äúbeard‚Äù for your trip to be with the troops like Obama, Bush, Clinton, bush, Reagan...even Nixon.  Or maybe it is a fake out while you help at the local soup kitchen making and serving food to the poor.
@realDonaldTrump Do you take shoe phone on the golf course like in Get Smart?   And do you have a cone of silence?  You must not sleep to play as much golf as you do.  You ar definitely better than Obama at finding time to. It work.
@AshleyRParker You do a great job and I always look forward to reading your writing and hearing from you on TV.  DO NOT LISTEN TO ANY CRITICISM.  I am a man and think you are beautiful on tv (and mean it in the most parental and nice way).  I am sure your family is very proud of you.

@JeffFlake True.
@seanhannity @CNN Sean, I think you are having a breakdown.  The pressure is getting to you.  When are you going to admit who you really are emotionally?
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Landslide 45 (you won by a landslide even though you got 3 million less votes): what is wrong with you?  Is your motto ‚Äúwhether they go high or low, I go lower‚Äù?
@seanhannity @CNN Sean, I think you are right that you are under surveillance.  I think CNN has hired aliens from outer space and Syria.  You need to talk about this on air. It‚Äôs your only chance of being safe.
@seanhannity @mmfa @GoAngelo @CNN @brianstelter I think this is a cry for help from Sean. He is clearly projecting what is in his heart and head onto others.  Sean...its okay to come out of the closet.
@senrobportman It is more outrageous that we have a president who is trying to weaponize the justice department.  And, even worse that you are not doing anything to protect us.
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump ( who won a historic landslide by loosing by 3 million votes), you seem to be low energy and low Testosterone?  Can you pick up the pace?   No public events all weekend?  Just nap time?
@PalmerReport It‚Äôs because he is old, low energy and low ‚ÄúT‚Äù.
@IvankaTrumpHQ Great that she is helping women and women‚Äôs rights.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes.  I got into Penn out of HS AND got into Wharton grad and Penn Law when I was a senior.  What about you?  It‚Äôs tough to be the village idiot.
@realDonaldTrump I heard him say in a work place environment that he just walks up to women and grabs their ....oh wait....was that Frankin?
@realDonaldTrump What are you buying for the village idiots (Eric and Don JR) to make them feel better?
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Nice.  Now, how do you feel about living with a cheater?
@FLOTUS @POTUS Did they take ‚Äúart‚Äù photos of you?

@senorrinhatch You have lost your soul.
@senorrinhatch You are wrong.
@SenSherrodBrown And you are surprised why?
@MSNBC @AliVelshi Garmon's comment makes perfect sense.  Velshi, being educated and having lived in other countries, would best understand why Moore wanted to date underage women.  It is because Moore is a pedaphile and in other countries pedaphiles are punished and not protected by the DA office
@SenateMajLdr @GOPSenFinance @EnergyGOP Will the bill also authorize the use of the Justice Department as a political weapon?  I think you need to do that and stand up for what you believe.
@senrobportman And, where do you stand on weaponizing the Justice Department?
@SpeakerRyan Great.  Now, how do you feel about the Justice department being used as a political weapon?
@marcorubio Are you really a US Senator?
@senrobportman Good that you came out against Moore.  Now, what about Trump/Session using the Justice Department to harrass political advisaries in an effort to distract the nation from their misdeeds?  Are you going to have another Profile In Courage or not?
@clairecmc Perhaps you can explain how and why it was okay for the prosecutors in the DAs office to know about Moore‚Äôs attraction to underage girls and not do anything about it. Aren‚Äôt they guilty as well for protecting one of their own?
@marcorubio And, are you the companion or the fool in your mind?
@marcorubio Marco, that‚Äôs really nice. Now tell me where you stand on Roy Moore and on the President  basically lying all the time.   Quoting the Bible is not exactly a profile in courage.
@AnnCoulter Hey Ann, 19 is past the age of consent.  You know this.
@SeanMcElwee @joanwalsh Okay, IÔ∏è dislike the gop but what you wrote isn‚Äôt true.  He is a Harvard Law Grad, worked at a major firm, clerked at the district and appellate federal court level and worked for a legitimate senator.  He also is working as deputy solicitor general for Alabama. He is qualified.
@moryan Dear Mo, what are you talking about?
@AnnCoulter @chucktodd Really Ann?  With your background you say this?   Try to be honest.
@AnnCoulter Really?  REALLY?  Ann, you didn‚Äôt say that when you were younger....
@realDonaldTrump Dear President Landslide 45:  glad to hear you are solving the world‚Äôs problems.  Just one question, why do you trust Putin more than Americans who took an oath to serve?
@JoyAnnReid @KimmiAnne77 IÔ∏è am surprised that you would question anything President Landslide 45 says.  After all he has done more to reshape America and our place in the world in 9 months than every president since Rosevelt combined. And IÔ∏è mean teddy not the interloper from NY.
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump Agree.  If President Landslide 45 pulls it off he deserves a lot of credit.  But...please explain to me, based upon Landslide‚Äôs tenuous understanding and connection to the truth why you believe him!
@senrobportman Will it hold pedophiles accountable?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why don‚Äôt we publish a list of politicians who abused women and admitted to it on tape.
@senrobportman How about Moore?  Do you think a pedophile should be disqualified from serving in the senate?  Take a position.  Show leadership.
@MajorCBS @POTUS So I guess it must be true....after all if President Landslide 45 says something it must be true!!!
@AARP If you continue to associate with Hannity, you will be endorsing the position expressed on his show that real female sexual abuse and harrassment is "few and far between".  You will be complicite.
@NewDay @brianstelter I don't understand how anyone can say that President Landslide 45 hasn't dont anything.  He has made American safe for pedaphiles so that even men who like young girls can run for Senate.  Now we need to work on making America safe for men who like young boys....
@AASchapiro Purging is never a sign of strength.  My prediction is he starts to manufacture international crisis.  Look to Lebonon.
@gmorgenson Thank you for all you have done and written.  What are your future plans?
@senrobportman And yet you are silent on Talley and Moore?  You are a profile in courage.
@senrobportman And how about the Talley nomination?   Is he qualified?   3 years experience, no trials and a blogger?
@senrobportman Rob...very interesting.  But where do you stand on pedophilia
@SenateMajLdr Mitch,  keep up the good work!!  Assuming trump doesn‚Äôt get us killed, you only have 12 more months to worry about you.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you mean elected Democrats
@senrobportman Rob, it‚Äôs time for Washington to listen to the American people and consider ethics, honesty and fitness for office.
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Ann, you know better.  You always wasn‚Äôt like this.  You used to be kind.
@senrobportman Does the common ground include your turning a blind eye to Trump challenging the rule of law.  Rob, you know better.
@FLOTUS Are you going to discuss cyber bullying?
@senrobportman Glad you are having a good time.  Any opinion on the president of the US suggesting political prosecution of his opponents?
@realDonaldTrump You said the unemployment rate was fake. How did you fix the rate so it isn‚Äôt fake anymore.
@donnabrazile Tell the truth.  Did you write that chapter of your book?  It isn‚Äôt your voice. Did you even know the publisher was going to push it?
@AllenWest I am trying to remember.  Why did YOU leave the military?   What were the circumstances around that?
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Folks, I am going to give you a clue.:when it is a great story that seems really salacious and you can hear about it only on FOX, it‚Äôs a lie

@Scaramucci @BarstoolBigCat @PFTCommenter You are a bigger idiot than I thought.
@davidfrum Yes
@ThisWeekABC Also, please explain how trump took the dishonest unemployment rate and made it honest.
@ThisWeekABC I hope you are going to have guests who discuss what happens to his memory...he said he had a perfect exceptional memory.
@IvankaTrump But your daddy said the unemployment rate was rigged, wrong and very dishonest.
@donnabrazile @JoyAnnReid Here‚Äôs a life lesson...when there are two people who can help pay the bills and one refuses, the one who pays calls the shots.
@sendavidperdue And what was that number?  How many total?Was it about 5,000 emigrating to a nation of 325 million? And what was their crime rate?  0%? 1/2
@DonaldJTrumpJr And history is going to say what about you.  Like a few hundred years from now?
@realDonaldTrump If you were judged on merit based, you wouldn't be a Penn Grad (and you didn't get it as a Freshman...Dad bought your way in as a transfer).
@DonaldJTrumpJr Donald Jr., what is wrong with you?  You do understand that there is a difference between being kind and doing good deeds and socialism?

@kylegriffin1 Guys, you shouldn‚Äôt be complaining that he called Hannity and Bolton.  They are both smarter than Trump.
@FoxNews @EricTrump @JudgeJeanine @LaraLeaTrump After all, you are part of news Corp. Why didn‚Äôt you report on Weinstein. What are new sports conflicts of interest.
@FoxNews @EricTrump @JudgeJeanine @LaraLeaTrump Hey FOXNews, are you going to explain how you missed the Weinstein story and your company‚Äôs business transactions with his companies. 1/2
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump Donald, you do realize that by retweeting this advertisement you just broke the law by promoting a private interest use in public office.
@VP @POTUS Solid strategy.  Can we have a war like the one that ended the Great Depression as well?
@VP @POTUS Yes.  It‚Äôs good to cut tax rates down to the level of the Great Depression.  And to start a trade war like during the Great Depression.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Let‚Äôs talk about fox and news Corp. What was your reporting?  And how about O‚ÄôReilly, Airles and Bolling?  Where was YOUR reporting?
@senrobportman What about a trade war?  Is that good for auto co‚Äôs?
@billoreilly You mean because you were a sexual predator and your network didn‚Äôt report it?
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Nope.  But have yours?  What have you done to reduce police brutality?  Specifically?
@senrobportman @POTUS Really?   REALLY?   As the former trade rep are you kidding?
@senrobportman You used to be ethical and smart.  I am assuming you are still smart.  Be ethical and brave.  You have an obligation to help the nation.
@senrobportman Rob, be brave and tell the truth.
@senrobportman Rob, as a former USA Trade Rep, will killing NAFTA and starting a global trade war help or hurt your state's auto and ag industries?
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @HillaryClinton Jesse, are you are reporter?  Why didn't you report about Weinstein?  Did you get pressure from your parent co that made movies with him?
@FoxNews @greggutfeld Please don't tell me Fox Entertainment benefited from Havery Weinstein...that would explain why Fox News is in the tank with him.
@FoxNews @greggutfeld I mean, did 20th Century Fox or any NewsCorp businesses do business with Weinstein?  Is your parent one of the company's that benefited?
@FoxNews @greggutfeld I think I now understand.  Hillary asked Fox News to not report the Weinstein scandal.  Given your reporting that must be it.
@TuckerCarlson @HarveyLevinTMZ @FoxNews So, Tucker, I wonder?  Are you in the tank with liberals?  After all, you didn't report the story either...Why did you miss the story?
@FoxNews @greggutfeld So, I wonder.  Why did fox miss this story?  Are you in the tank with liberals?  Are you not a news media reporting organtization?
@brithume Yes.  As a reporter you did a great job on Weinstein, Ailes, O'Reilly, Bolling.  You were all over it.  Maybe you need better sources.
@senrobportman So as a former USA Trade Rep., do you think Trump is helping or hurting Ag exports?  Show some courage.  You know better.
@senrobportman Great.  Aprofile in Courage.  Now...what do you think of our Pres's trade policy.  You were the US Trade Rep.  Is he helping these workers?
@senrobportman Rob, you were the US trade rep.  What do you think of the President's trade policy?  Silence means you agree with it or you are a coward.
@senrobportman Rob, while you are right we need to stop human trafficking, do you have the courage to comment on our unhinged president?
@realDonaldTrump I agree.  Fox News should get punished for not reporting on sexual abuse/discrimination within its company.  Also, they buried Weinstein
@Bourdain Right. So you knew as well?
@DonaldJTrumpJr I agree that we need to look at the media and ask questions.  Like why did Fox News not report this for years or investigate.
@realDonaldTrump So you think that the Weinstein story being run by fake news is demeaning and denigrating?  Surprised you support Harvey.
@PressSec It‚Äôs because you and the President think it‚Äôs okay to lie and play the victim.
@KellyannePolls Are you saying that Harvey is a pussy grabber?
