I can't replace you..	Because there is no one like you &lt;3
Stop checking your phone..	They are not going to text you :/
Don't depend too much on anyone..	Everyone changes when they meet new people..!
Some Boys don't propose a Girl..	Because they think they'll lose their friendship too :)
There is a reason God put our eyes on the front of our body. It‚Äôs so we can see where we are going, not where we have been.
Beautiful face is not important..	Beautiful heart is Important &lt;3
When you are happy, you enjoy the music..	But, when you are sad, you understand the lyrics :)
If you want to be happy, then never expect anything to anyone :)
Dear Phone,	Thanks for being there when I feel alone :)
Let's take a moment to thank 'Earphones' for helping us ignore stupid people around us.

If I delete your number, you‚Äôre basically deleted from my life üòè
Forgive your enemies, But never forget their names.. ;)
If people are trying to bring you ‚ÄòDown‚Äô, It only means that you are ‚ÄòAbove them‚Äô :)
Silent people have the loudest minds.
If you have crazy Friends, You don't need GF or BF to enjoy your Life ;)
Dear Alle,	If today I lose hope,	Please remind me that your plans are better than my dreams :)
I just want to Restart my Life :/	Raise your hand if you also üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
When a Boy is silent, he is just silent only..	But when a Girl is silent, Million of things are running in her mind..
Best things about being Single:	No Drama, No Fighting, No Crying, No Heartbreak, No Confusion, No Worries and No Problem :)
I am not really single,	I am dating myself..	I take myself out to eat,	I buy me clothes,	I love me :D
Believe it or not,	But one sided love is always true &lt;3
Forget who forgets you :)
19-24 is the age where you can build your future or destroy it.	Everything depend on your hard work :)
I don't care about people who judge me,	I am just gonna do whatever makes me happy in life :)
Raise your hand if you are missing someone very badly but He/She has no idea about it :/
Believing in yourself is the first secret of success :) (y)
Be careful what you tell to people,	A friend today could be an Enemy tomorrow :/
If I sacrifice my sleep for you,	Trust me! you are damn special to me &lt;3
Appreciate what you have..	Before it turns into what you had :)
Maturity is when someone hurts you and you try to understand their situation and don't hurt them back :)
Once I used to be talkative,	But now I am the most silent Person :)
No matter how much you hate School,	You'll gonna miss it when you leave it :)
It kills when you miss someone a lot and they are busy enjoying their life having no idea about it :(
Everyone is busy with their loved one,	And I am busy scrolling my News Feed..
I love chatting with those people who don't stop chatting even after saying bye.. &lt;3
My phone has thousand of songs,	But I listen to same 7-8 songs on repeat all the time :D
There is always a third Person in a Relationship who is waiting for breakup üòÇ
Silent Boy + Talkative Girl	Makes the Best Pair &lt;3
I hate when I am waiting for a text from you and then my phone vibrate but that message is not from you :/
Enjoy every moment of your life,	You never know when these moments turn to memories :)
I wish my Parents could live forever üòç
Don't be so quick to believe what you hear,	Because lies spread quicker than the truth :)
Don't force someone to make time for you,	If they really want to, They will :)
18 to 30 is the age where we meet a lot of temporary People :)
Truth:	People will hurt you and then they act like you hurt them ü§ó
People before knowing me:	OMG! Why are you so quiet?	.	People after knowing me:	Will you please Shut Up! 	üòÇüòÇ
No one cares unless you are Rich, Beautiful or Dead :/
Always remember:	Beauty attracts heart,	But character attracts soul :)
People always remember your mistakes,	But no one remembers the good things you have done to them :)
3 Mistakes of my Life:	.	1) I trust easily.	2) I care for everyone.	3) I don't cheat.
At first I was so innocent &amp; good boy,	Then my Idiot best friend entered in my life and everything changed :D
Don't believe those who tell you they love you,	Believe those who show you that they love you :)
Being a girl is not easy in our Society,	Can't walk out at Night,	Can't talk to any Male Friend,	Can't do what your dream is :/
Every Girl have that one male friend with whom She shares all her feelings without any fear :)
I wish we could talk again like we used to be before :(
Raise your hand if you haven't smoked in your whole life (y)
Raise your hand if you love to travel in night time &lt;3
No matter how busy a Person is,	If they really care, they will always find time for you :)
I don't respect those who don't respect me..	Some people call it Ego,	But I call it Self Respect :)
Know yourself first before judging others :)
I seriously need a break from my current life :(
If you want a long term Relationship,	Follow the simple rule: "Never Lie" :)
You are lucky if you found a Person who never gets tired of understanding your nonsense attitude üòç
Not every Girl wants money,	Some just want your Time, Attention and Love..
One day you will search me to say Sorry,	But that will be too late üò∞üòú
When no one is there,	Music will always be there for you üòç
When couple fight so much and they are not breaking up, They are really in Love
If She ignores you for a Day,	Ignore her for a Week üòè
It's better to wait long..	Then to Marry wrong üòû
Did you know?	Girls usually fall in love with funny boys :)
If you want to be happy then never expect anything from anyone :)
