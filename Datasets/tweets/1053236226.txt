The closest some of them come is a carbon tax. But we see in France one potential public response to levies that hit lower- and middle-income families as well as the One Percent.
What European social democracies do have is VATs. But I have yet to see our new liberals in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail call for broad-based consumption taxes that hit the middle class.
Denmark doesn't tax wealth; its top marginal rate is 60 percent not AOC's 70 percent. Norway has a wealth tax much lower than Warren's proposal. Its top marginal rate is 39 percent. Both states embrace skill-based immigration policies. https://t.co/MZm8LtZ0ZN

RT @PollsAndVotes: Long term trend in ideology from Gallup.  Slow but steady trends rather than short term bumps.		https://t.co/NmBhf5Aufv‚Ä¶
There is another question, too: When Democrats tell Gallup they are liberals, are they really voicing support for the agenda of the Democratic Socialists of America, as some in media would have us believe? The answer to that question would tell us a lot about 2020.
There are definitional problems, of course ‚Äî what do respondents mean when they say they are 'conservative' or 'moderate'? But, overall, the picture in this poll is relatively stable.
More subgroups, too, identify as conservatives than liberals. Indeed, Gallup found that both Hispanics are women are evenly divided by ideology, and that only slightly more under 50s identify as liberal than conservative.
Note, too, that while moderates make up a plurality of independents, there are more conservative independents (28 percent) than liberal ones (22 percent).
Note, for starters, the headline of Gallup's poll: "U.S. Still Leans Conservative." The gap between liberals and conservatives has narrowed in recent years, but looks stable.
I've seen plenty of stories today trumpeting the Gallup poll showing that a majority of Democrats identify as liberal for the first time. This is not necessarily a good thing for the Democratic party. https://t.co/aHfE8Lkl9f

It's worth considering what Star Wars might have been had Lucas deferred or compromised with his longtime producer. Of course, George Lucas is not exactly the compromising type.
When it came time to film Return of the Jedi, Lucas wanted a less artsy director who would stay w/in budget and defer to his leadership. He chose Richard Marquand (1937-1987), whose background was mostly in TV.

5) A defeated Kavanaugh nomination may well become a rallying cry for conservative activists in midterms. A pulled nomination, in the aftermath of interventions by the New Yorker and Avenatti, would cause those same activists to throw up their hands and lose enthusiasm.
4) Any further delay of the confirmation process, including pushing back the hearing schedule for Thursday as Sen. Feinstein now demands, would be tantamount to pulling the nomination in the eyes of conservative base.
3) Republicans now find themselves in the position of having to proceed with confirmation process‚Äîincluding an up-or-down vote after Thursday‚Äîor risk the collapse of grassroots support weeks before midterm elections.
2) Dr. Ford's allegations seriously jeopardize Kavanaugh's nomination. But Ramirez's allegation, published a day after Ford 'committed' to Thursday's hearing, has had the effect of rallying conservative grassroots behind Kavanaugh.
A few observations on the politics of #Kavanaugh 		1) Democrats have driven the argument over his confirmation since day 1 of the hearings when they flagrantly interrupted committee proceedings and paid no price.

To reckon with 2016 would require him to acknowledge that his policy excesses and confrontational responses to electoral repudiation in 2010 and 2014 fueled president Trump's rise. And that is a bridge too far.
It is interesting to me how absent 2016 is from Obama's speech. He is recycling the same tropes from the past decade, ascribing GOP victories to the wealthy exploitation of irrational responses to "change." He could've delivered this speech (but for Trump) in 2010.
He also failed to produce D turnout as the incumbent while stumping for Hillary in 2016 https://t.co/hGwnSI2YAf

I am fascinated by the economic determinism of this Obama speech. As always in his view, concerns over immigration, 2nd Amendment, government regulation are examples of false consciousness, proletarian delusions manipulated by "the powerful."
There is nothing new in President Obama's speech. It could have been delivered the last time he was on the trail in support of Democrats. The result of his intervention then was not what he intended.

I did like this line from the Robin: "It can take a lot of socialists to get a little liberalism." How much liberalism, then, ought we to expect in the coming years?

Democratic socialists cannot escape the agency problem. What begins as "mass action‚Äîsometimes illegal, always confrontational" (Robin) ends in bureaucratic routine and coercion.
I encountered something similar in this 2,300 word socialist manifesto from July. Midway through the idealistic verbiage, you come across a call for state control of (at least) 7.5 percent of the economy. https://t.co/TIe0FqyPfe https://t.co/y5UYZ7HmGZ

I've long thought of @FreeBeacon as a job creator for young conservative journalists. But that's too modest. We also create jobs for the outside reporters to whom Democrats choose to reply to our stories!
So not only is our story NOT "inaccurate," her response gives it legs. Is this why her campaign never responded to @BrentScher requests for comment?
Yet McCaskill's response suggests that she *was* on the plane, at least for part of her trip. Which had been billed as an RV tour.
I'm puzzling over what Sen. McCaskill is talking about here. Beacon never asserts she was on the plane. Only that it tracked her route. https://t.co/DwDwx0jk98
