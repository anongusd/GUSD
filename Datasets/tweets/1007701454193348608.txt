@ClarkKe95563197 @LeahR77 @jonolmstead1 Uhm... okieeee... that does not make Kavanaugh innocent :P
@ClarkKe95563197 @LeahR77 @jonolmstead1 ? What does that have to do with anything?		Lack of law and order in the country come from the current round of corrupt politicians, money and power for them above all.
@Christo87540622 yesssssssssssss conspiracies.
@ClarkKe95563197 @jonolmstead1 @LeahR77 Suuuure... well everyone in the left I know of has said they do not support antifa or violence.... 	so youll have to go debate someone else on that topic :}
@realyumiyacchi @TheMagicIsYou Sure thing spooky, thanks for speaking up! sorry dragged ya into it. 		but yea, as he says, its a stupid immature joke... poor taste yes.. does it make anyone a criminal, no.
@Kansei13Kansei @bennyjohnson Sure, look and see if you can find ANY senate hearing where a prosecutor was brought in to question a victim... 		I'll wait....
@Kansei13Kansei @bennyjohnson laughs... it is not in fact... even in a courtroom you question both sides, not just one.
@ClarkKe95563197 @jonolmstead1 @LeahR77 you just kinda skipped over my tweet entirely. 		You do know not all socialist structures are govt based, right?  You may be thinking of communism instead		A simple coop owned bar here is also a socialist structure		Every gov is a trade off between what the gov can offer citizens

@ClarkKe95563197 @jonolmstead1 @LeahR77 Sure, here you go the=n... how did you get from slandering someone saying they were trying to lynch someone, to socialism?
@ClarkKe95563197 @jonolmstead1 @LeahR77 hehe gluck :}
@Kansei13Kansei @bennyjohnson Kavanaugh gave the particular party, already gave you his testimony
@Sierra_AMV @RaymondArroyo @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Yes, he interview her first about the assault, then asked the two polygraph questions about this report.... 		He has spoken already publicly about this.
@Kansei13Kansei @bennyjohnson So you just changed hte question... 	you stated that there was no date or location, yet Kavanaugh was very specific about which party it was....
@ButchieBad @sheryljeanneH @MagaDesert Best for everyone.
@ClarkKe95563197 @jonolmstead1 @LeahR77 you should maybe go back to school some... not sure who taught ya that, but no. 		The above structures of our society are socialistic... and you use them daily
