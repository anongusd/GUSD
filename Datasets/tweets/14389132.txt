@kiphillreporter Cutting funding to Medicare affects benefits, and was an attack or “change” to the program, whether you want to acknowledge it or not.
But here’s the big point, @kiphillreporter Democrats want single payer, which would “change” Medicare as we know it forever. At a cost of $32 trillion by several estimates. Republicans want to protect Medicare as its own program.
@kiphillreporter So - Cutting funding to Medicare affects benefits, and was an attack or “change” to the program, whether you want to acknowledge it or not.
@kiphillreporter And @kiphillreporter - contd from the article “The whole idea of Medicare Advantage was to drive down the cost of health insurance for the elderly as private insurance companies competing for seniors' business."
@kiphillreporter And what’s more @kiphillreporter "The blue section represents reductions in how much Medicare reimburses private, Medicare Advantage plans. That program allows seniors to join a private health insurance, with the federal government footing the bill.“
@kiphillreporter From the story: "The majority of the cuts, as you can see in this chart below, come from reductions in how much Medicare reimburses hospitals and private health insurance companies." https://t.co/1kPAV8VBpz

AND @premera - your 2 million customers in Alaska, WA and Oregon would have liked some relief. And insurance companies would also like to stay in business. Instead you are giving the money we pay away to other nonprofits! Sounds like you needed a tax break with our $.
My crabbiness aside @HerreraBeutler ... I blame Obamacare for this mess. But I wish we had help on our Pacific Co issue sooner than March 2018... but the answer is not universal healthcare either.
I asked @HerreraBeutler back in June 2017 for help. Everyone knew we had a lack of options. Nothing was done. Some people moved. I considered it. But instead took out biz insurance as the only workaround. Many could not. $1800+ /mo. is crazy for insurance! @premera
And while I am being crabby about this @Premera stuff. Why did you @HerreraBeutler wait so long to lobby for rural Pacific Co care?! It happened way past enrollment time. And still... zero procedures available for us at OHSU main campus where they do the hard stuff. CMH is small.
@HerreraBeutler It's nice they gave MILLIONS$$ to some nonprofits.. but what about us?! We can only use Premera.. no choices.. and are held hostage to their outrageous monthly fees! Customers should see some relief with all this extra $$. But no.. that isnt a tax deduction for them.
@HerreraBeutler Well this pisses me off! Premera should give insured some relief! I pay over $1800/mo for husband and me insured on biz plan. If I purchase individual thru exchange.. cost for just me is over $1450/mo. AND I still can't see Portland docs! Just a few Astoria and a small hospital.
