We can be hurt by people, hurting people, but can be more importantly loved by people. It's our job to do the loving.

I love you because I know that you've experienced the same bodily cuts and scars. You breathe, as do I...that's what truly matters.

Any fear, lack of confidence, or doubt must be let go. The tighter we clench, the less time we have to be free. Find the courage, be great.
Hold your own, taking criticism with an open mind. Make desired changes, leaving anything negative far behind.
We reach beyond these physical bodies. When thoughts become words. When words become actions. When interactions become loving. Contribute.
Fear inflicted by the injustices of others. If we knew nothing of it...what kind of world could we live in?

Problems have answers. Ideas have possibilities.
Be the director of your own show...the one you live each day...you call action, write the plot...as long as it's truly your own production.
See, it's all in how we react...the hardest part is doing it optimistically; and with a greater sense of social awareness and implication.
The brain = our worlds. The world = our brains.
We're forgetting the simple moments that give us happiness..our human spirits-more powerful than the institutions, the money, and the titles
Find something in life that gives YOU meaning. Share it with the world. Never let it go.
