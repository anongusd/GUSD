I don‚Äôt know what this says about me, but I have the apartment to myself on this sunny Saturday morning and I‚Äôve spent it cleaning and I honestly couldn‚Äôt be happier.
I took that same belief and confidence with me when I applied to college, and my first internship, and my first job. I take it with me in my current position, and as I apply to grad school.
The first thing that I ever wanted to be was a member of the UConn women, and then a professional basketball player. I didn't do either of those things, but that's not really the point. I believed that I could because I watched her do it every day, and that's powerful.
I went to my first ever basketball tryout wearing a @S10Bird jersey. I was an 10 yr old from Hartford, who wanted to be just like her. It's the best decision I've ever made. Representation matters.

1. The affordable housing you lived in, while achieving your ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù, is a by product of the 70% marginal tax rate that you claim is ‚Äúun-American‚Äù. 		2. No one is self-made.
