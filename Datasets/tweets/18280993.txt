What's it like knowing left's Election12 strategy dependent on #Anonymous trolls, #Occupiers, Hacktivists creating mischief, @EricBoehlert?
All these anonymous Leftists on Twitter, Comment Sections & #Occupy. No wonder they embrace cowardly #Anonymous Guy Fawkes as mascot!

You're not even trying. You're just typing in terms randomly you know loosely relate to the subject matter. @toddlap @RangerSG
Where are you coming up with these faux-philosophical no-truths? @toddlap

Death penalty. Not 'war'. You know better than I do that's what we are debating. You change subject cause you're losing. @toddlap
Sinful heart? Sinful heart? It's not thoughts, or aspirations, or weaknesses being condemned. It's willful human actions. @toddlap
If you can't distinguish between innocent lives & cold-blooded murderers, that's your problem, not mine. @toddlap
Told you I could care less if you think my pro-death penalty negates YOUR interpretation of 'pro-life'. Call me anti-abortion. @toddlap
Disagree with @RonPaul - you get excommunicated. The perils of independent thinking! @patriotsnetwork @PatDollard
At least Peter Singer makes sense when he defends evil. @toddlap
You're all over map, dude. Citing Jesus to make your point? Ripping people who believe the bible. I stand by my assessment: Freak! @toddlap

To call that an oversimplification would be an oversimplification. She was a Eugenicist. Death penalty has nothing to do w that. @toddlap

Well, if believing in killing calculated cold-hearted murderers isn't pro-life then just call me anti-abortion Andy! @toddlap
Do the crime, do the... sizzle, zap, snurldle, gasp, thud. @toddlap
Let's work on that project! Let's find a deserving rich white cold-blooded murderer & push for state to off him. Fun! @toddlap

Mr Obama, what would you say to your daughters about your vote where born, alive babies from botched abortions can STILL be killed?

ABC NEWS Presents: CSI Conservatives: This isn't a debate. It's 'objective,' 'neutral' MSM journalists rudely probing a foreign species.
No, you lie. @toddlap
There you go again. I would never assert there are no racists in Alabama. @toddlap
'Racist' is the bottom of the barrel of ad hominems, pal. Throw in your grotesque stereotyping and you're a worthless beast. @toddlap
Robert Byrd's existence in Dem Party was testament to progressive, populist roots of KKK. Not to any 'redemption'. @toddlap
Whatever ignorance you ascribe to bible-believers you exhibit in spades relating to your hideous progressive non-racist rehistory. @toddlap
Hey #Alabama! Are ya'll all racist? @toddlap says so!
You bring up the bible now. Nice. @toddlap
I don't think most/all are 'racist f#$%heads'. I think most Dems are sickly programmed in Marxist multicultural PC illogic. @toddlap

Wow! No, I am not. I am defending against your all-encompassing hyper-stupid thesis of GOP, southerners being racist. @toddlap
I like conservative southerners. What type of freak show MSNBC watching shut-in makes you think they are racist? @toddlap
You didn't hit a sacred cow. You are singing the left's most oversung scared cow cliche. It's intellectually pathetic. @toddlap
Of course he would. He wanted govt money. He wanted to stick it to the poor. Could you be less informed? @toddlap @wayneaschneider
Coughlin, too. At core of progressivism is class warfare. Oppressor/oppressed cultural leftism is race-based. @toddlap @wayneaschneider
Do you not see how fallible, foolish your simpleminded theory is? You keep crafting excuses for flaws in your conspiracy. @toddlap
So what Senator in the Republican South is/was racist while Dem Robert Byrd was? @toddlap @jaredmares68 @ericboehlert
'Reverse racism' is basic RE-assertion - countering stupid leftist dogma - that non-whites can't be racist. Basic logic. @purebullshit
Conservatives have been put on defensive by the Dem/Left Race Industry. It's High Time we finally fight back.
'I don't think Father Coughlin was a progressive' is startling ignorant statement. It's exactly what he was - to his core! @WayneASchneider
Do I [& right, GOP, conservatives] ever not get attacked by well-funded left on race charge is better question? I fight back! @purebullshit
Sanger & Coughlin are PROGRESSIVES 1st & foremost. Own it. Robert Byrd, too. David Duke is hardcore statist. @toddlap @ceolas @ericboehlert
