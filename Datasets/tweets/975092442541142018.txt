@GrassrootsSpeak Did you tell your friend it's in the Constitution for a very good reason?		It's only partisan when a party defends somebody who doesn't deserve to be defended?		And remind your friend that trump is ignorant, incompetent, corrupt, and a danger to democracy?
3/3 3 or 4 Parties?		A real 3rd party  would need to be large enough to be something other than a spoiler. 		Could the moderates from both Dems and Repubs form 1 or 2 new parties?		Election via "ranked choice" voting?		But are multi-party countries any better off?		Thoughts?
2/3 3 or 4 Parties?		I'm an Independent/moderate who got pushed into the Democratic Party when the GOP went berserk. Now the Dems might be moving leftward.		I'd give a strong "moderate" party a careful look (unless the candidate was a flake or a maverick).
1/3 3 or 4 Parties?		Could moderate/centrist party or parties get traction in the USA?		https://t.co/CRMNTYYoxg		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @CREWcrew @MoveOn @TomSteyer	@citizensimpeach @plsimpeach @Need2Impeach	@impeachtrump @impeachdtnow

@RashidaTlaib @plsimpeach trump not only failed to divest, he continues to promote his various business interests.		Who knows what role trump's business needs affect his presidential actions?
@senrobportman @WSJ Too bad I don't subscribe.		Last I saw, wage increases were largely eaten by inflation.
@JohnCornyn Do you know how much sucking it takes to remove 300 BILLION TONS of CO2 from the air in a year?		How much CO2 has been removed by the pilot plant, and at what cost?

@krassenstein My concerns are that she is young, idealistic, and brash. She also has a hero complex and a big appetite for power. These are potentially dangerous traits, man or woman.		On the plus side, she is very bright, articulate, thinks well, listens, and is willing to explore new ideas.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS One of the risks of the investigation is that it will be clogged with a myriad of trump's small violations.		The committees must focus on a finite package in order to move forward quickly.
@EdKrassen Anyone who is broadly qualified is welcome. I hope the Dems will narrow the field to 3 or so before Primary season debates. Some criteria based on measures of support should be applied.

@EdKrassen So far, there's a missing link: the checks exist, but they haven't been proven to be related to the Stormy payoff, except through Cohen's testimony. The cover story that the checks were for legal services or retainers must be overcome with evidence.
@lisastark351 @kat00tje If I'm commenting on a trump tweet, I screen capture it-- they often disappear when they are controversial!

@MeetThePress @AOC @hmcghee If the #GND cost $100T in 10 years, that would require 1/2 the GNP every year (want to argue cost?). This is a global issue and must be shared by other countries.

@tonyschwartz It's terrible. But, his ignorance and handling of nuclear weapons and possible nuclear war is at least equally dangerous.		We need a capable president, and somebody (not I) elected a corrupt moron.
@JohnCornyn I think you overestimate your own intelligence. Quoting Mussolini (if that's what you are referring to here) on twitter is stupid.
@JoeBarri BTW, I don't support trump's and the gop's position of "never consider abortion".		Also, I think women are being naive to think they can own the issue, without half the human race weighing in. It wouldn't hurt to try to get support from men, instead of disqualifying us.
@JoeBarri Birth control is no problem, in my view.		The problem arises when there is another potential human life involved. When the fetus becomes a human being, health care involves more than just a woman's control of her own body. The argument is, when does a fetus become a human being?
@lkmcgann @kristarchy Some truth to that. On the other hand, I can think of men who have been criticized for those qualities.		However, ANY Dem contender who looks like a possible nominee is going to face criticism from every conceivable angle. The closer we get to the election, the worse it will be.
@TheAtlantic @tribelaw @JoshuaMatz8 The reason for the over-eager discussion is that much of the public thinks existing evidence clearly puts trump way above a reasonable threshold for impeachment.		I don't see how trump can convert this discussion to a win, except with his fanatical followers.

@Brasilmagic Reason AND emotion are always involved in politics. It's undesirable when emotion dominates. But reason alone does not guaranty harmony and agreement.

Not clear what Mueller found. It's worrisome that there have been no visible interviews, questions, or indictments of trump's immediate family. No interview of trump. Have the big fish escaped? Holding my breath.
@ChloePolitiCat @RBReich @CBSNews Haven't seen much evidence of that. Did you? We did not. We didn't save the $4k the gop promised initially, but something like $2k. That's minor.		Major: $1T deficit. ~$2T debt added over 10 years. Most benefits (~75%)  to corporations and the wealthy. Irresponsible policy.
@ChasMacMedia @RBReich @CBSNews You are right. But, I'd say that's part of what makes the article misleading. The headline implies, $8K is a disaster for this couple. Then without giving their income, which must be sky high, given their professions, they segue to "many people" live week to week. Misleading.
@RBReich Sorry, @CBSNews the article explains it correctly, although it is a little obscure, and the headline is misleading.		Why are intelligent people in this income bracket living from one paycheck to the next?
@RBReich @CBSNews has it wrong.		The number that matters is not the size of the refund or payment, but the actual taxes paid! The size of the refund depends on the amount withheld.

@RoyBlunt Good grief. The voters elected Hillary. 3M vote margin. 		trump was "elected" by 78K voters, Russia, and winner-take-all in the EC.
@LindseyGrahamSC @60Minutes The 25th Amendment is not a "bureaucratic coup". It's a legitimate (though flawed) procedure for removing a president who is not doing his job.		What has happened to you? You used to see trump for the danger that he is.

@maryjaneimme1 @TomSteyer trump's track record (business insider/New York Times):	succeeded- 21	problems- 16	failed- 24		https://t.co/OTSCxbuvV4
@ProudResister Good points.		Also:		- No more pie-in-the-sky, financially and logistically impossible "programs"		Green New Deal is a farce and gives the GOP ammunition against Dems.		Are #MedicareForAll and #CollegeFreeForAll affordable?		Minimum wage $15 feasible? If so, over what timescale?
Here's a good collection of the trump/Russia claims.		https://t.co/zVy7hZSBTa
5/5 Other factors:	- Exact polling question matters	- Extracting trends is difficult, and good judgement is needed	- Plot scales can emphasize particular features of the data		READERS BEWARE!
4/5 Big factors:	- The exact polling question can change results substantially and surprisingly	- Exaggerated claims can be made from small changes or fluctuations, if "spin" is applied
3/5 Now, notice how different a picture emerges from a poll of 1/22/19 with a question about the health of the economy.		A completely opposite picture! Pessimistic. What's happening here?		https://t.co/sPN5qZeC5f https://t.co/BtK7OnHQra
2/5 First, the data trump quotes. Note that his claim is technically correct, but the "16 year high" is only 3% higher than a peak in 2012, and the overall variation is only ~15% from 1995 to the present. So trump's optimistic claim is exaggerated.		https://t.co/jjEA7rCQU4 https://t.co/SINvC4JJh6
1/5 In researching trump's claim, I found a surprising illustration of how small changes in polling can be used to motivate opposite political claims. Read on...		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @CREWcrew @MoveOn @TomSteyer	@citizensimpeach @plsimpeach https://t.co/xRvHR7qSXA
@realDonaldTrump Sorry. I found the article:		https://t.co/jjEA7rCQU4		This is a very odd polling result, contrasting sharply with a seemingly related poll only a month ago.
@realDonaldTrump I can't locate any Gallup poll that substantiates this. Do you have a reference or link?		Here's the picture from 1/22/19		https://t.co/sPN5qZeC5f https://t.co/xsegOyHUSq
@JohnCornyn Sounds like your objections have some merit.		But, what is the gop plan to address #GlobalWarming? Dismantle the EPA? Ignore the problem?
@TomSteyer Over-hyped. trump has not "bankrupted every business he's ever run". Only 6 have generated bankruptcies. NYT considers only ~40% to be failures.		https://t.co/OTSCxbuvV4
.@realDonaldTrump : Why must you view opposition as enmity? Why the derisive, divisive name-calling? https://t.co/8ktZLHkZLD
Here is trump, continuing his divisive, hate-inducing name calling.		Why does he need to exaggerate and lie? Because he thinks it increases his power to manipulate his followers.		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @CREWcrew @MoveOn @TomSteyer https://t.co/aBdTdrw0sC

@APGsMom If your withholding is too low, you will not get a refund. But what matters is how much you paid to the government in taxes.

@Maggie_Klaus She was mugged and robbed. As far as 2020 is concerned, it's her decision. I think she has given the country enough (and taken enough gaffe from the country). She doesn't owe it to us to run again.
All parties need to be more responsible about fiscal planning. It's not just progressives who have trouble doing arithmetic. trump &amp; the gop just had a year of spending more than income.		There also needs to be cost to benefit analysis. Sometimes, deficit spending is justified. https://t.co/txfMy4DcLh
When we do our family taxes in the next week or so, we'll be watching for our measly $2-4K in tax savings. (We've already seen large chunks of money added to the debt and given to corporations.)		https://t.co/l1BuNAenLA		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets

@RepWilson Sorry, I don't understand the context.
@CoryBooker : You must explain how school choice could work! School choice is a reality at college level, and it tends to favor the wealthy. In secondary schools, there would be a tendency to want to flock to the best schools. How do you manage resources, selection, &amp; transport? https://t.co/pq6M8XF1Pa
@drboycewatkins1 What's the problem? Are you hung up on interracial marriages? Seems like we should be over that.
@mshalk LoL. 		Nope. It's entirely due to your present-day choices.
@JasonOverstreet @Twitter Did you report his tweet? I've seen twitter reject individual trump tweets for racist slurs.
@DisavowTrump20 I wouldn't worry about it much. There'll be enough name-calling to include all the men, too. Name calling will be most fierce for candidates who have the best chances.
@sandyms928 So sorry to hear that. Thoughts and prayers coming your way.

@mmpadellan No doubt, trump is often confused. But, he is always confused when it is convenient to claim it.

@realDonaldTrump Where are your tax returns?
@RepRonEstes @realDonaldTrump trump initially promised to release his tax returns, as every recent president since Nixon has done. Then he closed up and protected them using a fake excuse. Equally secretive about all finances.		Very suspicious behavior. Must be investigated!		Thank you @WaysMeansCmte .
@realDonaldTrump OVERSIGHT! It should have been happening over the past two years.
I'm very glad to see the start of a serious investigation of trump's finances. Thank you @HouseIntel .		https://t.co/NFY4IXd7B8		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @CREWcrew @MoveOn @TomSteyer	@citizensimpeach @plsimpeach @Need2Impeach	@impeachtrump
@realDonaldTrump 1) President Obama was not a crook.	2) Plenty of indications that you are a crook. Now we will find out.
Hey gop: After 10 years of unrestrained partisanship, you cannot just cry "partisanship" against the Dems and expect the charge to matter.		Let's see some bipartisanship from the gop-- er, party of trump (#POT).		Remember the Garland nomination? And Kavanaugh? https://t.co/KElNjQ5LwO
@RoyBlunt How does this political "principle" work out on the Garland nomination?		It will take years of good behavior by the gop before you earn any right to blame the Dems for partisanship. And I haven't seen  any good gop behavior yet!		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats
@kylegriffin1 @smartdissent Surely, you didn't think trump meant it? The bipartisan line is just a political ploy.

@tedlieu @VP @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump I think you are giving trump way too much credit. trump has no conception of morality and he can never see his own mistakes.

@stevemorris__ @smartdissent @AOC @ewarren The concept of "fair" is insidious and flexible. It depends strongly upon an individual's viewpoint. There is likely to be a strong disagreement between definitions by (many of) the 1% and (many of) the rest of us.
@DorisMatsui Although the public acceptance of the reality of #GlobalWarming is increasing, I am still dismayed by the lack of urgency in promoting mitigation that is displayed by most Americans.		Thank you for your efforts.

@RepJayapal Bad choice of photos. Makes him look like a rich, cocky business tycoon.
@EdKrassen This was an obvious effort to get voters to back him, and to pressure Mueller.
@SenateGOP @POTUS Blechh.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Border security is an emergency built on #trumpLies. BTW, "Border security" is not identical with a "wall".
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump True.		However, I don't want to know them all. I just want [the world] to know enough of them to get him out of office and perhaps into jail.
@CBSEveningNews @RepRichHudson WHAT??? Perhaps only trumpees watched?
@Daniel_Lewis3 @itachi2891 Seems fair to put a marker on my BINGO card for "Pelosi eye roll", don't you think?
@RepBarragan @EnergyCommerce Go team. Best wishes for overcoming the negative actions of the trump administration.
@AOC True. I couldn't stand to watch it.		Note that trump did offer a couple of fantasies: a wall, NK w/o nukes, and a 10 year "program" to defeat HIV. I don't expect to see any of these in my lifetime, and I'll bet the wall is the only thing we hear of again after the SOTU.
@RepTedDeutch @HouseJudiciary @MomsDemand Best wishes for progress on this important issue. Thanks!

@ProudResister Kool-Aid? Not nearly strong enough. Must be a severe case of #TDS.
@GovMikeHuckabee She probably thought (as I did) that the child was strictly a political ploy, having nothing to do with trump's actions.
@FamilyMindedcom Useless without a color code.
I'm all for #EndCitizensUnited. But I'm also confused. This is the first year I have financially supported Dems, both candidates and issues. However, even after the election is over, they ask me for money at every turn. Help pass this bill. Help push this or oppose that. Why?
If I watched, I'd be going for a full card. Good chance of that. If somebody does watch and count markers, let me know how it turns out. https://t.co/igfiZea0Y0

@SenKevinCramer @POTUS trump's wall proposal is inane-- based on lies and fear mongering. I'd like to see some real planning and evidence.
@notcapnamerica Good point.
Perhaps another billionaire should run who would steal votes from trump. Then the outcome could be determined by which thief is more successful. Or by Russia. https://t.co/rh7wUtB7Zg

@TheGoodGodAbove Dear God,		I'm sure you can tell that there are wide variations among humans. Please do not over-generalize! Also, please forgive those who try to be good and fail.		- A human who tries.
@AOC I think you are choosing good issues, such as this one, and I agree with the substance of your arguments.		I'm concerned about your tendency towards demagoguery. The country is already suffering under a gop demagogue! The way to avoid that pit is to respect facts and truth.
@JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen History will judge, true. But why isn't congress doing more to judge, now? I've heard individual members speaking out, but am not aware of a concerted effort.

True. Wow. Another thing to worry about. The good news: we've never had to dig that deep. https://t.co/uLuwQE2JvC
Fact checkers: 		If trump prefaces a statement with "I think", it is difficult to prove he is lying. E.g., take #4. Of course, he could be wrong or dissembling. Establishing this, however, is complex. In this case, I suspect he is being sincere!		https://t.co/nbybwulWyv		@CNN
@thehill @SenRickScott Do you understand that "border security" is not the same thing as "the wall"? And that the argument supporting the wall is built on exaggerations and lies?
Attention New England Patriots: Winning the Superbowl does not REQUIRE that you attend a bash at the WH. Instead, you could just enjoy your victory. Or, send the losing team to keep trump company?
@defensivethird Whether to compromise (or not) depends on the issue. If there is no compromise, ever, nothing can happen.

8/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions: Assessment		trump has increased the threat of nuclear warfare.		Keepers of the "Doomsday Clock" have recently moved the hands to "2 minutes until doomsday", a level of threat that hasn't existed since the 1950's.		https://t.co/zJyRBoKKgY
7/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions: NOTES		[5] Intermediate range nuclear weapons are a special threat to Europe and Middle East countries. Once deployed, a nuclear attack can be initiated with only a very short time to respond.
6/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions: NOTES		[4] "Small" nuclear weapons erode deterrence by reducing the threshold that keeps nuclear weapons from being used. Once a small weapon is used, the nuclear boundary is crossed, and escalation could easily follow, leading to WWIII.
5/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions: NOTES		[3] trump fabricated, without evidence, violations of the agreement by Iran. His unilateral withdrawal increases the likelihood that Iran will resume nuclear weapons development.
4/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions: NOTES		[2] Threats to use nuclear weapons are intrinsically dangerous. In the hands of an impulsive character such as trump's they are extremely risky.
3/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions: NOTES		[1] NATO was created in the aftermath of WWII to prevent the advance of the Soviet Union into Europe. It has been spectacularly successful. trump has made ill-founded complaints about costs of the alliance to the USA.
2/8 trump's nuclear weapons actions:		- attack NATO [1]	- threaten NK w/ "fire and fury" [2]	- withdraw from Iran Nuclear Treaty [3]	- start development &amp; production of "small" nuclear weapons [4]	- suspend the INF [5]		trump is damaging and endangering America and the world.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I agree that trump's behavior and disbelief in the results of intelligence reports is intolerable.		However, it is congressional oversight that should take responsibility for dealing with trump. The only outcome from Wray and Haspel talking with trump would be to infuriate him.
@SenWarren @RepAdamSmith @HASCDemocrats Excellent. Hope the bill passes.		It would be good to have a layer or co-decision-makers between the POTUS and a nuclear attack. No one person should be able to initiate nuclear weapon use.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I don't care a hoot what trump says now or a year ago.		But, I absolutely agree there is no crisis, based on real data and reporting.
@realDonaldTrump You are clueless.
@DavidGr78574965 I think they know how the taxes work. They just don't want to pay them. Imagine how you would feel if you had made your first million and 70% of your next million went to taxes. Or imagine how you would feel if a similar tough progressive cut in at $30,000 ( or so).

What? 		1. I'm not going to believe in "new and expanded [steel] plants" until I see real evidence. Last time trump claimed this, it was a complete lie. Any confirmation?		2. Money into the treasury via tariffs appears as costs to US producers and consumers. Tariffs are a tax. https://t.co/llP9uw0sKj
@realDonaldTrump Are you back to the new steel plants lie? Care to give real evidence?		Money to the treasury from tariffs comes at the expense of American consumers.
@RBReich It would also widen the gap between super-rich and ordinary citizens.

@bulldoghill Please include a link to the article.
@TeaPainUSA @EdSkipper That's the #DangerToAmerica part. trump is in a position to do a huge amount of damage.
@realDonaldTrump Your argument for needing a wall is based on lies and specious arguments. There's a good reason President Obama ignored your advice.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Already did. Unfortunately, KY voters do not have to listen to money. I hope they listen to common sense. My thoughts and prayers for wisdom are with the KY voters.
@_SJPeace_ Why don't we replace most of the gop Senators with elephants? It would increase the level of common sense and integrity.
@damianpaletta trump is #DamagingAmerica.
@maydaymindy9 Good point. However, I have been exhausted from hearing trump lies for years, now. I NEVER want to hear another SOTU or any other speech from trump. Unless he #resigns.		@realDonaldTrump
No matter what investigators can or cannot prove, I will never be convinced that trump, manager of all these criminals, did not personally conspire in their crimes.		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @CREWcrew @MoveOn @TomSteyer	@citizensimpeach https://t.co/evlfBlJII1
@RepMattGaetz trump goes first. He's the #BiggestLiar.
@Anderson_IPS @AyannaPressley Well said! Thank you. 		We must ensure #EqualOpportunity.
"“In the face of 37 indictments, the  President’s continued actions to undermine the Special Counsel  investigation raise the questions: what does Putin have on the  President, politically, personally or financially?" - Pelosi		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats https://t.co/BuOdCGKYvR
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @dccc I think the gop has already locked in losses for 2020. They've failed to govern responsibly for several years. The gop brought us trump and then backed him 100%.
trump is #incompetent. 1) Lied to motivate wall (crime, drugs). 2) Shutdown government to extort. 3) Failed. 4) STILL threatening.		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @CREWcrew @MoveOn @TomSteyer	@citizensimpeach @plsimpeach @Need2Impeach	@impeachtrump https://t.co/cyS2OR1Tzk

All these gop-ers who hope the Dems will compromise with trump are neglecting the months of "negotiations" last year when trump rejected one compromise after another. Let's see if trump is ready to compromise.		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @MoveOn
This isn't over yet. trump is still insisting on $5.7B for his ego wall and threatening either another shutdown or declaration of a border emergency. We need to find another way forward.		#NoWall.		@SenateGOP  @SenateDems	@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats	@votevets @MoveOn @TomSteyer

Fellow #resisters: Please make your opinions and recommendations known to Congress, both parties. Until trump is out of office, things will not improve. He damages America further every day.
@SenRonJohnson @SenSchumer The point is to #EndTheShutdownNow, not put a bandaid on the shutdown.

@veterans_i I'm appalled at how difficult it is to root out prejudice.		I'm doing everything I can to get trump out of office. I realize that won't solve all the problems, but it will reduce the enabling that he has brought with him.
@RoKhanna Good idea. It would be even better if somebody could do an overall cost/benefit analysis for mitigation costs vs. non-mitigation costs.		Real estate near the coasts and low-lying developments are in foreseeable trouble.
@benFranklin2018 Don't, unless it is absolutely essential!
@SpeakerPelosi It's a terrible thing when governments fail so badly that people must take to the streets.		How often does it turn out well? Didn't work so well in the "Arab Spring".

The #GOP really cares for the "average American". (sarc) https://t.co/cciB4MOeMc
@ShannonBream Either capitalism or socialism can run wild. Democracy can have some of each, and the USA already does. Sound government is essential to keep either "force" under control.
@ChuckGrassley Would you talk compromise while somebody was holding you hostage?
@RashidaTlaib Mine, too. Social progress is agonizingly slow. Humans can make so much trouble for themselves.

@SenateGOP @SenSchumer It's the trump and the GOP that will not reopen the government.
@SenateGOP trump does not negotiate in good faith. Why is the government shut down? Because it's the only way trump can get his useless, expensive wall. Or, perhaps, because trump craves power. Or because he needs a distraction.

@RevDrBarber @LaCongresista I think fear and accusations arise when it comes to funding these programs. They see higher taxes. Also, healthcare for all is a move (leftward) towards increased socialism, and that has a bad reputation. The GOP fought Social Security, Medicare, the ACA, ... They won't change.
@davidfrum I'm not OK that the 1-on-1 meetings took place and said so at the time. Now, we'll very likely never know what was said. Even if the translator makes an important claim, trump &amp; Putin will deny it, and the GOP will believe what they want. Lost cause.

@EdKrassen I've tried to convince a trumpee that trump lies. MSM accounts failed, because the person believes trump's charges of "fake news". When I bring up other moral issues or actions, I hit a stone wall. Excuses vary.		As far as I know, I have never convinced a trumpee of anything.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes, it's a bombshell. But it's not news. It was very clear to me at the time that trump should not be permitted to meet 1 on 1 with Putin, without a written record.		trump should have no private meetings or phone calls with any foreign leader. He lies too much-- not trustworthy.
If you think trump is of sound mind, please thoughtfully read his 50 most recent tweets and answer:		1) Does he have his facts straight?	2) Can you follow his reasoning?	3) Does he think he is being persecuted by a conspiracy? How large is that conspiracy?		What do you think now?
@Helenhs The US government is being attacked by trump and others. The good news is that the government still exists and is beginning to cope (I think). It was a big step forward to have Dems win the House. The drama unfolds at a snail's pace. Take a break if you need to.
2/2 secret Putin mtgs		I said this at the time.		The translator should have been questioned under oath right after the meeting.		With trump's lying, we will never know what was said.		trump should have NO private contacts with foreign leaders.

@JohnCornyn 1) The wall is promoted by a specious argument based on misinterpreted facts.	2) It is unnecessary.	3) It would be ineffective.	4) It is expensive. $5.7B for 234 miles.	5) More than 50% oppose it.		Pls give it up.		BTW- trump can discredit himself without aid from the Dems.

@paulkrugman @ThePlumLineGS I have a clear, simple impeachment case:		1. wall based on specious data and arguments	2. shutdown by trump based on wall		==&gt; abuse of power ==&gt; #HighCrimes ==&gt; #StartImpeachmentNow		Things won't improve until trump is gone!		#DangerToAmerica		@votevets @CREWcrew @TomSteyer
@paulkrugman And Russian intervention. And the Electoral College's winner-take-all. And the effects of the years-long campaign against Hillary. ...
@stopthenutjob I agree with the sentiment. But the language annoys me. One more f-bomb and I give up on you... You and I can carry on separately, if necessary. We're fighting the same fight.

@RepMarkMeadows GOP's position in this shutdown is neither reasonable nor sustainable. Holding government funding hostage because you WANT money for parts of  a border wall at $5 billion (that's less than 1/10th of 1% of the  budget) is not reasonable. 	Americans want #NoWall.

@JoshHor10094565 @Mannyotiko One other point: the Dems offered trump his wall months ago in a bipartisan deal, and trump rejected it. trump is not rational.
@JoshHor10094565 @Mannyotiko You are missing the point. The wall is nothing. The important issue is that trump is mentally incompetent to make good decisions. He lies. He is delusional.

@Turnip2020 @realDonaldTrump This is not a technical problem. It is a candidate problem. Everybody knows you are well grounded, and clever, and have some charisma, but what would you do if you were on a platform or in an office? Mold? Rot? Dry up? Make a stink?

Some things to remember about the wall:	- $2.5B is only a fraction of the total cost (10%)	- trump does not negotiate in good faith (already turned down	    a bipartisan proposal that fit his then-request)	- Easy to go over, under, or around a wall		@SenateDems	@HouseDemocrats

@ROnline97 @Mannyotiko @realDonaldTrump You didn't look it up. You are resistant to facts. I will block you now, because it is apparent that I cannot provide you with even one simple fact. Best wishes for a brighter future.

@RepJayapal @SecNielsen Caution: the refugees have been through a horrendous ordeal getting here. Some are quite ill. Out of thousands, it is likely that some will die.		I agree they should have medical care as good as America can provide.
@blackmillennia2 @Mannyotiko @TheDemocrats @googlenews Anybody who looks can see that the parties of today have nothing in common with those of the mid-1800's. Only the names have remained the same.

@Turnip2020 I guess a turnip has great difficulty with Christmas. We humans love the tastes and joys that good meals can add to the celebration. Perhaps it adds to your holiday depression that, not only are you losing relatives by the millions, you are largely left out in the cold. So sorry.
@marcorubio The really sad thing about humans is that we/they can take a message of pure hope and turn it into support for a scum-president like trump. There are many other examples of this perversion of God's intentions throughout history.

@JadedCreative Correction: trump WANTS the wall as his monument. Chances of getting it are very slim.		My trump monument proposal: have a contest for the best caricature of trump and have it sculpted. Place it in front of the trump tower in DC. Or, possibly in front of GOP headquarters.
@JasonOverstreet @jospencer77 trump should NEVER have the nuclear football.

@K_JeanPierre I'm amazed at how tightly trump's base sticks with him. I attribute that to Fox News and their associated pundits.		How can we reach these people who believe the MSM is fake news?

@RepAdamSchiff trump's "red line" around his business appears to be a defense of things he knows are wrong. Of course, his business and financial matters need to be investigated. I believe there is a cesspool behind his red line.
@krassenstein Not to mention pardoning his buddies and supporting criminals for public office.		A better term for trump would be #ToughCriminal.
@RepSwalwell Collusion is probably treason.
@RepSwalwell Just because they say it's not a crime, doesn't mean they are right. Collusion (with legal terminology adjustments) is a crime.
