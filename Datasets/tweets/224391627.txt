Democrats have voted against the amendment that would remove the 6:1 govt. match program to small-donor campaign contributions in HR1. The amendment was not adopted.
This means for every $200 donation to a politicians campaign, the federal government will match that donation with $1200 of taxpayer dollars. HR1 is subsidizing private money with taxpayer funds through campaign subsidies.
@RepLoudermilk introduced an amendment to remove the “political ATM” the Democrats are creating with their proposed 6 to 1 small-dollar match program that requires the federal government to match any small-dollar (up to $200) campaign contributions by 600%.
CHA Democrats have voted down the amendment introduced by @RepMarkWalker that would have prohibited the practice of ballot harvesting.
Ranking Member Davis said, “Bad people are going to take advantage of bad processes. This is wrong in North Carolina and it ought to be wrong in every state in this nation. If we’re serious about elections and elections being fair, then this amendment should pass.”
This amendment prohibits the practice of ballot harvesting while allowing for common sense exceptions for any voters with disabilities who are unable to deliver their ballot.
You may recognize “ballot harvesting” from the recent allegations in North Carolina’s 9th District that made the NCSBE call for a new election, but its a practice that is perfectly legal in California.
CHA Republicans introduced an amendment to HR1 that would prohibit ballot harvesting, the practice when organized workers or volunteers collect absentee ballots from certain voters and drop them off at a polling place or election office.
“Madam Chair, I don’t blame you for that. I blame the fact that many here in your leadership team want to rush this bill to the floor, and they want to ensure that this is a political message rather than good policy.”
“It’s very frustrating to me that this markup is being held after I and my colleague @RepLoudermilk only had 15 minutes of time to ask questions of the panel who was put in front of us.”
“I personally participate in early voting. 3 of the last 4 election cycles, I’ve cast my vote early. I think it’s a great process, but we have to make sure there safeguards in place.”
@RodneyDavis said HR 1 is being rushed to the floor of the House for political reasons rather than actual good policy reasons to ensure everyone gets access to early voting.
34 mg of caffeine per can x 6 cans  = plenty to work through 40 amendments attempting to make HR1 a bipartisan bill. https://t.co/wehurvncu4
”We don’t need to continue to wonder how much taxpayers dollars are going to be spent by putting a federal fingerprint on this.”
“We want to ensure that everyone has access to voting, and again, I cannot be more clear: we want everyone who is registered or can be registered to vote to have the ability to do so.” @RodneyDavis

“In the case of Reynolds vs. Sims, the Supreme Court stated, ‘the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.’”
“We should absolutely, absolutely be in favor of increasing access to polls, but without adding the necessary checks and balances to ensure these practices are protected, we are opening the door to fraud in our election system.”
He went on to say, “HR1 is a prime example of the Democratic Party telling states that the federal government knows better than they do, and the Washington, D.C. swamp is taking over the country’s election system.”
“The greatest threat to our nation’s election system is partisanship,” said Ranking Member @RodneyDavis during his opening remarks of the CHA Markup of HR1.
Leader McConnell is right - H.R. 1 is a power grab by Democrats. That’s why we are introducing common sense amendments to HR 1 during today’s Committee Markup to address the problems with the Dems partisan attempts to rig elections, restrict free speech &amp; waste taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/nvuNC1Djgb
“Members on both sides are concerned about what this all-encompassing legislation could mean for their individual districts and states... there have been numerous provisions identified that could easily have long-term cost implications.” #HR1

“We all share a common goal of ensuring our elections be open, free, fair, and functioning with the highest level of integrity. #HR1 will not accomplish this goal.” - Ranking Member @RodneyDavis in his opening statement of today’s CHA hearing on H.R. 1.
I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for making feminine products more readily available in the House. Thanks @RepDWStweets, @RepGraceMeng, and @RepSeanMaloney for raising this important issue with CHA and thanks @RepZoeLofgren @HouseAdm_Dems for your quick action! https://t.co/a8VdCHyJIN
Apparently Dems are not only comfortable drafting #HR1 in secret - now they’re passing it on to the Senate in secret??? To avoid confusion, our committee will still have a hearing on H.R. 1 this Thursday. https://t.co/qajhge6NUe
#HR1 is not designed to serve the people, but to serve the Democratic Majority.
"Since when does the federal government become a candidate’s ATM?"
#HR1 "creates a 6 to1 government match to small-donor campaign contributions up to $200. This means for every $200 that a political candidate receives, the federal government, with your tax dollars, is giving $1200 to a politician’s campaign."
#HR1 "abuses taxpayer dollars, criminalizes free speech and encourages voting irregularities."
In anticipation of our upcoming hearing on H.R. 1,  Ranking Member @RodneyDavis delivered a statement from the House Floor highlighting concerns with provisions in #HR1 that would authorize a taxpayer-funded program to pay for political campaigns: https://t.co/CBky6bAvJ9

Every American deserves to have their vote counted AND protected. That’s not what #HR1 would do. #FortheDemocrats
“It would make it harder for states to fix inaccurate data in their voter rolls.” By federalizing the voter registration process, Democrats are taking power away from states and are taking over elections. #FortheDemocrats
Democrats are “pitching new taxpayer subsidies, including a 600% govt. match for certain political donations and a new voucher program that would funnel even more public dollars to campaigns.” #HR1
#HR1 is a “proposal to grow the federal government’s power over Americans’ political speech and elections.” #FortheDemocrats
In case you missed it: The @senatemajldr points out some flawed Democratic provisions of #HR1 in his op-ed published by the @washingtonpost: https://t.co/MyMK3aOKNg

Questions that should be asked (5): Who are the grassroots organizations that wrote this bill? https://t.co/elC8KdtcED
Questions that should be asked (4): Is this Speaker Pelosi’s idea of bipartisanship for the 116th Congress? https://t.co/QhhcQ8WOoT
Questions that should be asked (3): If Committee on House Administration has jurisdiction over the focus of the bill, why weren’t the Committee Republicans consulted? https://t.co/tkpCMLsj89
Questions that should be asked (2): Who wrote everything that is contained in H.R. 1? https://t.co/A3I4pmB2fB
Questions that should be asked: Has anyone at the podium read H.R. 1 or does anyone know what’s in it? https://t.co/L4tRgHHKjN
