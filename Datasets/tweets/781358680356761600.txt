@realDonaldTrump 1. Are we still talking about #Nuclear weaponry?	2. Gross
@AgentIceBlue Also there are ways to extrapolate earth's temperature beyond simple record keeping: fields of geology, mathematical modeling, paleobotany, etc. #Science is a many-splendored thing.
@AgentIceBlue no... prescribing opioids, my patients are on opioids. You could actually learn about what you are talking... or you can just keep your head up your ass, I'm sure it's very warm there.
@AgentIceBlue Just because it is difficult to learn something is not a justification for remaining ignorant.
@AgentIceBlue A larger percentage than 1 day
@ItsmeeeeV @realDonaldTrump yeah science is a huge conspiracy! Studying things and learning things to better understand the world, can't get more evil and nefarious than that. What has science ever done for us? Aside from better crops, refrigeration, modern medicine, travel technology, flight, etc. #science
@AgentIceBlue Also, the 1st half of Earth's existence there was no life and no oxygen in the atmosphere; so perhaps not super relevant to current Earth?
@AgentIceBlue no... because if you started yesterday you would have 1 day of data; if you started 200 years ago, you have 73,049 days of data. You have to start somewhere, the dinosaurs weren't very good at record keeping (small hands?).
@DineshDSouza Since you are a moron, I will try and use small words. There is variation in all data; the general trend has been temperature rise. One week of cold temperatures doesn't disprove a century of data. 1 week = 7days, 1 century= 36,524 days. Idiot. How #math works. #climatechange

NC Senator Burr stated that a magazine cover of @HillaryClinton would look better with a bullseye on it.  He "applegized"#SNL #election2016
Glenn Grothman of WI 6th doesn't believe Martin Luther King Day should be a holiday. #GOP #Elections2016
Warren Davidson of OH 8th stated that the problem with Veterans Administration is all the "moochers."  He is a veteran himself.  #election
Robert Pittenger of NC 9th, states that the Charlotte demonstrators "hated white people." Ignoring that many were white people #election2016
Whether the GOP rallies around him or disowns @realDonaldTrump is moot.  There are plenty of horrible things said by other candidates. #GOP
That's a lot of scary letters. https://t.co/qg4U4jB8J7
I made a joke about Russia and the FBI working together for Trump.  A couple of days later, that joke is getting a lot less funny. #election
@ananavarro once again dropping logic and common sense on people.  How is that fair? #Elections2016 https://t.co/Ywyo61BmSb
@dawguar @realDonaldTrump I'm actually heterosexual, but unlike your candidate I am able to keep my hands to myself. #sexualpredator
Also Utah, if you didn't re-elect Chaffetz.  He could use the extra time to repair his relationship with his daughter that he sold out #Utah
Dear citizens of Utah's 3rd.  It would be nice if you did not re-elect Chaffetz.  He is really just going to waste everyone's time. #Utah
After Cubs and Cavs, will the Vikings be able to finally make it to the promise land? https://t.co/2yVGxBpHl3
Theo Epstein = LEGEND
108 years, 7 games and now extra innings?!?!
Ethics and Personal integrity are such pesky things when there is a presidential election on the line.  McConnell for Trump #Elections2016 https://t.co/34K8jjeo9S
Republican Leaders are coming out of the woodwork to tie themselves to the albatross known as @realDonaldTrump #Elections2016 https://t.co/34K8jjeo9S
OK 538 is freaking me out.  Every time I check, the chance of Trump winning go up by 1%.  It is terrifying.  #Elections2016
Nothing says 2nd Semester Senior like wearing the shades.  #joecool #Elections2016 https://t.co/MLRwPjOobO
108 years is long enough.  Down with the Billy Goat.  #WS #Cubbies
The author of this 'article' is a toad.  GOP have to start acting like adults, not spoiled children who refuse to cooperate when opposed. https://t.co/WmD8jLd4fy
It is truly amazing the these GOP members are asking for a job by stating upfront that they will be incompetent and useless #Elections2016 https://t.co/v6CyUsq9hD
@RepStevenSmith This is pathetic.  You are a congressman of the United States.  Act like it.
To quote my grandmother: Fools and their money are soon parted. https://t.co/1rl00mRfgv
@LawlessPirate @KatyTurNBC Umm... I think you used the wrong tag-line.  Did you want #ImnotwithTur ?  Because otherwise you have missed boat
This is gross.  What does it matter is Huma Abedin is of pakistani descent.  @realDonaldTrump is truly a reprehensible human being #election https://t.co/dj1tnk60pb
Kasich has shown integrity.  Not flip-flopping back and forth like Heck in NV and Chaffetz in UT https://t.co/rieSD9ULvN
A church in MS burned out and spray painted: "Vote Trump." This election is terrifying; now there are hate crimes. #evil #Elections2016
In addition to other attacks at the pillars of democracy, @realDonaldTrump lobs assaults at the Fourth Estate #ImWithTur
@drf30 @HillaryClinton Do you have a citation for that?  'Cause I do:  look at TargetSmart William &amp; Mary poll of early/likely voters.
@TheFelixNYC you are free to look at the poll yourself: look at TargetSmart William &amp; Mary poll of early/likely voters.
@BobKluver @HillaryClinton That is very true.  But there are exit polls.  look at TargetSmart William &amp; Mary poll of early/likely voters.
@Fetzie_ @HillaryClinton TargetSmart William &amp; Mary poll of early/likely voters.
If all the House/Senate GOP can offer is more gridlock.  That is not a compelling message.  Vote them out. #Election2016 #GOP https://t.co/5sfeFzwOeA
This is what an honorable man does.  Speaks the truth even if it doesn't benefit his goals personally. KUDOS to Bill Weld #Election2016 https://t.co/StZIM0majp
@BlackmonKevin you are demonstrating the same self-control as your candidate.  Lashing out at news that you do not like. It's going to be ok
@BlackmonKevin @HillaryClinton yes, I know it is so crazy to believe the news.  Just keep wearing your tinfoil hat.
@LenaMessick it doesn't need to stay just in my mind.  We get to see for certain in 7 days.
28% of registered GOP early voters in Florida are voting for @HillaryClinton.  Maybe our country is not insane.  #Elections2016
Watched a truly fascinating interview of Bill Weld.  This is an honorable, thoughtful man who values what is right above party.
@HillaryClinton is smart, experienced, calm and qualified.  There is no excuse for not supporting her against a gross buffoon #Elections2016 https://t.co/DD97dFIB14
That is all the Republican majorities in the House and Senate provide.  Just empty words.  No leadership, no progress. #Election2016 #GOP
Whenever there is a horrible mass shooting, the Republicans send out their "thoughts and prayers," but do nothing.  Just empty words.
Like @SpeakerRyan, the Republicans all admonish their horrible candidate.  But they still support him.  Just empty words. #Election2016
In voting for @realDonaldTrump, Chaffetz apparently decided he didn't really worry if his daughter was ashamed of him.  #Election2016
So much for Republicans in Senate/House running from Trump.  They would support a cockroach if it was the 'Nominee.' #Election2016 #GOP
Trump lacks the discipline and fortitude to become POTUS. He can't even stay on message on a teleprompter #Election2016
The American attention span is truly short; have people forgotten how truly inept @realDonaldTrump was in the debates?  #Election2016
@realDonaldTrump Indeed, because that would have counted as preparation.
Actually @SpeakerRyan stated he voted for the Republican nominee. Because he is too ashamed to admit he voted for a sociopath #Election2016 https://t.co/Lmhc6Pa7Pv
How frightened should I be that Russia and the FBI director are attempting to influence the US election in the same direction? #Election2016
11 days before the election???  FBI Director Comey is a partisan hack.  He should be ashamed of himself. #partisanFBI
Senator Pat Toomey should be able to make difficult decisions.  Unlike 100 million+ Americans, he can't pick who to vote for. #Election2016
Yes... because 100% of journalists have realized you are an incompetent, lying buffoon. #incompetentTrump https://t.co/GGZRM2LhdL
@realDonaldTrump you need psychiatric help.  You are demonstrating severe paranoia and delusions.
Patience!  @realDonaldTrump will produce proof that his accusers are lying just as soon as staffers type it: 'cause there is time #earlyvote
Cruz picked a truly spectacular time to get on the Trump bandwagon.  At least he won't be crowded by fellow senators that despise them both. https://t.co/KIQ2codl04
Again  @realDonaldTrump bragged about 200 generals/admirals endorsements.  But Romney had 500.  Do the other 300 think he is a #moron
Americans want change and action from Washington.  If Republicans congressmen promise only more gridlock, why re-elect them? #change
It is vital that the @TheDemocrats in congress give @HillaryClinton a fighting chance to move forward her agenda. #Congress #downballot
8 years of watching the Republicans obstruct the agenda of the first African American president just out of pure spite, has only caused RAGE
Do Americans really want more Gridlock in Washington?  Isn't that what Americans find most frustrating about the Political scene?
It is a fact that @HillaryClinton is going to be 45th POTUS.  Republicans are desperate to maintain majorities in Congress.  More gridlock?
"No one respects women more than me" @realDonaldTrump.  Definitive proof of H. @HillaryClinton's claim that he lives in an alternate reality
Strong debate.  Calm in the face of an unhinged maniac. https://t.co/sP3yJhEaWk
H. Clinton has written 6 books (herself, not ghost-writers).  It turns out, that you get royalties from writing books.  CRAZY.
@elizabethforma @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Keeping that Supreme court seat vacate is a wasted effort; H. Clinton will be filling it.
LOSERS like @realDonaldTrump always complain about the playing field and the refs.  Winners just play better.
Why does @realDonaldTrump keep arguing for more nuclear weapons; more for us and other powers?  This is not making me feel safe.
I seem to remember Hillary Clinton doing something about health care. For a DECADE #nineties
@GOP @HillaryClinton to quote Mr. Cohen, D. Trump surrogate, "says who?"
How do I know this supposed massive "Trump tax audit" is not going to be finished by Nov. 8?  I would bet my bottom dollar on it.
Actually, H. Clinton helped eliminate the loophole he used when he took the 917 million dollar loss.
"I know nothing about Russia."  Great thing for a president to claim.
@realDonaldTrump "Give me your tired, your poor,	Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"  Doesn't Trump live in New York?
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Disaster is pretty clear; that is why the D. Trump campaign is now called a disaster.  Just ask Republicans
@realDonaldTrump being " a gentleman" is under debate.
@realDonaldTrump is unhinged.  Once again speaking over Clinton.
Trump: "If I win, I'm going to [persecute my political opponent.]"  Is @realDonaldTrump running for 3rd World Dictator or US President.
He is already rambling incoherently.  He is jumping from attack to attack without sequiturs.
Of course there are words in a debate @realDonaldTrump.  That is how debates work.  Man, you should have prepared a little more.
To quote the best episode of the West Wing.  Game On! #debate
Trump is truly a repugnant human being.  I look forward to him being trounced tonight and on Nov 8th. https://t.co/0qh66oHC9m
I made a joke to this effect during the Republican National Convention (when Queen told Trump he could't use their music).  #Foresight https://t.co/glnQ1J0CLw
There is only one competent candidate with a viable chance to win @HillaryClinton. Anyone truly repulsed by Trump should be WITH HER as well
If the Republicans abandoning Trump were truly courageous with the interest of the nation at heart, they would be advocating for Clinton now
Pence has not been vetted; he didn't even run.  Republicans chose a nominee via a democratic primary election.  There is no deus-ex-machina.
Engaging in magical thinking and attempting to pull a rabbit candidate out of a hat is not responsible.  It is childish and pathetic.
It is very difficult for Republicans to vote for @HillaryClinton after 2 decades of vilifying her.   But if they truly want to stop Trump...
Republicans abandoning @realDonaldTrump are cowards.  They are elected and are expected to make difficult decisions not duck and cover.
Skol @Vikings!!!! 5-0 going into the bye week.  They have beaten 3 playoff teams from last year (dismantling 2 of them).  #SKOL
@realDonaldTrump I'm glad you are not leaving the race.  I look forward to H. @HillaryClinton wiping the floor with you on Nov 8. #election
Can Trump even be trusted to act civilized on the world stage?  What if he attempts to grope a foreign leader? Trial at the Hague?
Like his friend Roger Ailes, @realDonaldTrump is a sexual predator, who uses his 'power' to take advantage of women.  Birds of a feather...
@lordtiberius I'm sorry, is this reply supposed to make sense?  You are delusional; you should go back on your medications.
Jack Kingston, fmr Rep Georgia, an apologist for Trump is disgraceful.  Party affiliation above all; would support a serial killer if #GOP
Forced to give an apology due to circumstances, he is unable to leave it there.  In 90 seconds he pivoted to attacking the Clintons.  #AWFUL
A sociopath is someone without any concept of other people's needs or feelings.  I think this is the best description of @realDonaldTrump
BBC News - Trump courts the terminally ill vote https://t.co/IxugrlwCAm	A metaphor for the Trump campaign: Living on a Prayer.
@ThomasLeventhal Is he using the line: "What do you have to lose?" on this demographic as well?
@realDonaldTrump is this a joke?  You interrupted Sec. Clinton like a toddler with ADD.  Attempt to limit your hypocrisy.
Trump claims that if you can't name an enemy you can't defeat it; Pence can't say the words "systemic racism" or "institutional bias."
@mike_pence when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, he said ""And some, I assume, are good people." NOT MANY.
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton is that all you got Donald?  There are only so many times you can beat that dead horse.
The empty words that Trump uses to support are extremely empty when he also says that our military is a disaster.
Pence claims Trump supports our troops... but only with empty words, not by paying taxes apparently.
But ISIS makes such a great bogeyman.  Never let the facts get in the way of really good demagoguery.
Pence should pay closer attention to current events. ISIS is close to losing Mosul and their 'caliphate.'
@realDonaldTrump @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel at least someone on your ticket is able to do homework.
Pence and Republican stance on police shootings and mass killings.  "Grieve" for for these tragedies and then not do a shit to prevent them.
@GOP already posting that Pence won the debate tonight.  Really takes away the drama; perhaps the view is not unbiased. #incompetent
@realDonaldTrump might answer the "call" at 3am.  But does anyone truly believe he would say anything useful?
@CortesSteve Do you think you wife, daughters and sisters appreciate being used as political props?  @realDonaldTrump is sexist.
@realDonaldTrump If this man pays no taxes.  He is not the genius.  His accountants are.   Are they running for president?
@realDonaldTrump you might answer the call; but apparently you won't have anything constructive to say.
Does @realDonaldTrump realize that USA is populated by 51% females.  So maybe fat-shaming and tweeting about sex tapes is counter-productive
It takes a special kind of incompetence to not even realize you have made a mistake.  @realDonaldTrump is delusional.  #MissUniverse
Trump has proven Benjamin Franklin wrong about Death and Taxes, apparently only one is certain
Most surprising thing I have learned about Climate Change: I didn't know Al Gore was Chinese.
@realDonaldTrump What do you call a man who doesn't adequately prepare for the most important interview in his life?  A LOSER.
