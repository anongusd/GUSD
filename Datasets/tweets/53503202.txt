@wheelguy123 Think about how you responded to me. Its confrationational and/or condescending. Regardless... I watched the entire video. And if you would read the entire thread, you'd find that I said that she should've been more patient with them. But, please continue...
@NSchneiderAZ13 I don‚Äôt begrudge those young folks for being passionate nor do I fault #DiFi for trying to explain the process. IMHO, I think it was blown out of proportional as a result of the way the initial short clip was presented.

I sincerely hope that more young people will get engaged in the democratic process and do the work to get their voices heard. I hope this episode doesn't inspire them to become cynical. In the words of @Common, "We need the wisdom of our elders &amp; young people's energy".
I firmly believe that Democrats are the party of supporting common sense gun reform, addressing #ClimateChange and a host of other progressive policies. I want to get more Democrats elected in both chambers of Congress so that we are able to usher in bold new policy agendas.
I hope that when the issue is gun violence prevention and the legislator is one of your favorites, that you will be willing to stand for the issue vs apologizing for them should they be on the wrong side of it.
As an advocate for common sense gun reform, I can appreciate those that have little patience &amp; are demanding action on climate change. Hell, I'm w you on the issue. I won't attempt to tell you how to advocate &amp; I respect your courageous efforts.
Trying to weaken #DianneFeinstein doesn't make it more likely that the GND would pass. I think it would make it even less likely, given that Republicans control the Senate &amp; there surely aren't enough Republican votes for it to get 51 or 60 votes.
I have absolutely zero doubt that #DianneFeinstein believes that #ClimateChange is real &amp; is a significant threat to our planet. I also know that she won't be an inhibitor towards getting solutions to address it.
...seek to craft a narrative that isn't real; those that WANT a controversy. Can you argue that #DiFi could've been more patient during the front end of the video? Sure. She should've been. But to make this into a situation where she needs to resign is absolutely ridiculous.
I'm not mad at #DianneFeinstein nor the young people that spoke w her. I am disappointed that this episode was turned into soemthing that it wasn't. I am glad that more young people are getting engaged in the process. But I am bothered that there are those who...

Think about the idea that the autopsy pictures would be "out there". Think about their surviving kids who may stumble across one &amp; what that might do to their already fragile psyche. Bottom line is that we need to be considerate of the survivor community &amp; put them 1st, always.
The Sandy Hook families have had to endure the torment of the tragedy, the absence of their loved ones, they've had to endure harassment &amp; threats from conspiracy theorists, they've had their pictures shown everywhere &amp; sometimes without their consent...
On one hand, I get what @KamalaHarris is saying. She wants legislators to see what gun violence really is. On the other hand, consider what that might mean to a family whose loved one's body was just torn apart by a flurry of bullets. Think about that.
That brave &amp; difficult decision, which sparked the civil rights movement, had its desired effect. But still, IT WAS MAMIE'S CHOICE! It was a choice that not many of us could do or would want to do. That is why some survivors are bothered by @KamalaHarris' comments.
Mamie Till called Ebony and Jet magazines, telling reporters she wanted the world to see the barbaric act committed against her son by white men in Mississippi. ‚ÄúI think everybody needed to know what had happened to Emmett Till" - Mamie Till.
I only have a handful of pictures of my mom. I realized that I was not prepared mentally or emotionally to see my mom, in that car, with that gun, with her head exploded. Regardless of the impact, it would have, that "shock &amp; awe" &amp; even the humanizing result, I CHOSE not to.
Thankfully, my lawyer took her lawyer hat off and put on one of a caring friend. She explained how traumatizing for me it would be to see those pictures. She understood my intent but explained that I hadn't considered the personal consequences of seeing them.
It showed what bullets can do to the human body &amp; in a VERY direct way, it showed the faces of gun violence, or at least the victims of it. I spoke with my lawyer &amp; agreed to give her power-of-attorney to act on my behalf in order for her to obtain my mom's autopsy pics
A few years ago, there were a few gun violence survivors who chose to share the autopsy pictures of the bodies of their loved ones that were shot &amp; killed. It was jarring, to say the least, to see that. I'm sure it was traumatizing for folks too.
I would never tell Nelba or any other survivor how to advocate for their loved one that was shot &amp; wounded or killed. That pain belongs to them and they are absolutely free to handle it however they choose.
I completely understand &amp; empathize w what @Nelba_MG is saying here. The gun violence survivor community is complex &amp; each of us chooses to deal w our tragedies in different ways; some help, some hurt &amp; some are impactful, while others not-so-much. https://t.co/CZxUhzFoaG
