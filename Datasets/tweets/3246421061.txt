@JayInslee How do I volunteer and contribute to your campaign?
@IvankaTrump @FoxNews @SteveHiltonx Looking forward to you lying.
@IvankaTrump But all lies at the White House.  Make an effort to be honest.
@cnnbrk I think she should run.
@HillaryClinton If you have the energy and the time, I don't see why you shouldn't run again. Win or lose, jump in the race.
@cnnbrk Justin Amash. I don't care about the 40% blind Republicans,  I think you should run for President.
@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler Jim Jordan only cares about Jim Jordan  He didn't care about the victims of sexual assault,  he doesn't care about the institutions and doesn't care about his constitutional duties.  Jim Jordan,  cares about Jim Jordan.
@MSNBC The shutdown wasn't the worst?
RT @RWPUSA: This is a grave threat to our national security.	Congress should subpoena all relevant documents and witnesses now.		Of Courseâ€¦
@ShibleyTelhami Good news.
@AshaRangappa_ @PreetBharara Does it matter? He brought proof.  Preet Bharara is like an owner of a burning house who is trying to stop the fire from spreading, but gets distracted by a mouse who ran out of the house and he completely forgets about the house and chases the mouse.
@PreetBharara He didn't lie Mr. Bharara, he said he was offered several position, but he declined them and he preferred Personal Attorney.  He never said he wanted a job, he was hoping they will make him an offer but that is just in recognition  of "loyalty "
@PreetBharara He didn't say he "wants" a job. Does that make a difference?
@matthewamiller The Trump family is toxic. Michael Cohen warned the GOP. They will destroy their party if they keep following Trump/Kushner. This Lawyer was lied, now his reputation is ruined.
@CNN "I didn't like him until he made me hear the tape." There, fixed it for you.
@WireAmerican How did you get on my page? https://t.co/xqeNI3ONzN
@TPM As usual, we didn't hear what we heard. The man is a true con, a professional liar.
@thehill @DevinNunes Really,  why so certain?
@SenateGOP Where were you when Mexico refused to pay?
@shomaristone That's silly, because of two idiots, you want to quit the entire party.
@MSNBC Then why lie about it.  Pure nepotism and favoritism disregarding the national security of the United States.  Do not reelect again.
@Amy_Siskind He probably already collected all the information he needed to sell to his clients.
@washingtonpost He hasn't started his campaign yet,  already he is messing up. Boy, if he just shut up, he can win.
@RWPUSA You are giving her too much power.  Not everything she says or does should be news.
@RepJeffries Lord knows.  I have been struggling with this question for weeks.
@TPM I am sorry, but this guy is an...
@TPM Yes!!!
@joshscampbell He needs to go talk to SDNY to say under oath what he knows.
@seanhannity You have an appointment with the AG of SDNY.  So you had this conversation with Michael Cohen?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Why do you call it a Primary if you have already decided for everyone? Is this a democratic process or a coronation? You are supposed to be neutral.

@business I see the bone saw industry is booming.
@CNN He should reimburse the taxpayers for this fiasco.
@ad9nine @CNN Miles away.
@CNN So he is coming back empty handed?  Not even a hotel deal?
@business Winning! Tired of all this winning.
@JonLemire @WillieGeist A waste of taxpayers money, a waste of America's prestige, a waste of time, total waste.
@NBCNews No, thank you.
@CNNPolitics Just like the abuse that went on when he was wrestling coach, he knew about it but looked the other way.
@CNN There goes Mr. Wambier's 500 million dollars  lawsuit. He should come back to the State of the Union and give Trump another standing ovation.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump It doesn't take much to impress you.
@nytpolitics Made Kim look good though.
@CNN Basically,  he caved in to all their demands.  Made Kim look good and the US weak, and now he is coming home empty handed.
@thehill So, is he now the new defacto Secretary of State?
@jimsciutto ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@CNN What happened to the bones he gave him for the first photo OP?
@CNN Trump Hotel and condominiums, plus trademarks for Ivanka and 2 or more sweatshops for her brand. Making America Great Again!
@thehill Come on, enough time for him to go.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Tell me about the check you wrote  him for 35k.  How did your organization record it in your books?
@ShibleyTelhami They are planning their next move, how to make more dissidents into Kabobs.
@tender_sweet @thehill Trump condominiums.
@BrianKarem All Kim had to do is smile at him, and there, got a huge concession.
@AliVelshi Yep! Now, how about that Trump condominium in the coast of North Korea?
@MeetThePress Hahahahah, he caved already,  didn't take long.
@cspan @justinamash I will donate to your Presidential campaign for 2020.
@justinamash You should run for President.
@Jim_Jordan And the issue is?
@NatashaBertrand Could it be he lied to the WSJ?
@business Mueller is on it.
@thehill Because they all know what Cohen is saying is true,  that's the really sad part.  It's like Trump is their constitution.
@thehill That's why he got indicted.
@NicolleDWallace He is a Trump employee,  gotta defend the Boss, Mr. Trump.
@RepMarkMeadows Michael Cohen is right about one thing, Trump knows how to make people lie for him, and you are one of his victims.
@funder @realDonaldTrump ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚
@IvankaTrump Where is the Korean " Pennisula"?Is it near Pennsylvania?
@thehill No surprise there.
@CNN But if not reimbursement,  what do you think the payment is for?	 knowing how cheap Trump is.
@thehill He is making me lose interest.  Acting like Lebron,  just make up your mind.
@NikkiHaley Remember Elliott Broidy, yeah, I member!  Remember Jason Miller,  yeah, I member!  Shall I list all the Republicans that forced their mistresses to have abortions?
@SenMcSallyAZ @Phil_Mattingly @vpotus So you are only worried about Arizona,  what about the Union, and the constitution? Not your cup of tea? John McCain is so proud right now.
@Reuters Yes.
@Jim_Jordan Describe law abiding citizens? The kid that shot all those other kids in Florida,  wasn't he a law abiding citizen?
@SenRonJohnson Because she is smart. Waste of resources. There is no emergency,  and the fact that you keep insisting is insulting your own people. Why don't you just call your constituency stupid?
@thehill it's a trap.  False information used by Trump to attempt to discredit the media.
@CNN Don't fall into this trap, it is probably one of Trump's fabrications so he can attempt to discredit the press further.
@thehill It could be a trap set up by Trump. Don't jump on it like you did with Jussie.  Wait for the facts.
@funder It could be a trap. Let's wait for the facts,  I learned my lesson with Jussie Smollett.
@CapehartJ Here we go again... please let's wait for the facts. I am not about to do the Jussie thing over again.
@realDonaldTrump There is no emergency whatsoever.
@realDonaldTrump Unbelievable.  Worry about North Korea.
@ShibleyTelhami That is who he is, always been and always will be. No surprise.
@thehill Or is he trying to discourage law suits.
@thehill Is he broke?
@thehill Last time Bannon was involved in a campaign it didn't end well for Moore.
@CNN Why isn't he arrested for discharging a fire arm in public?

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Will you be stripping the Coast Guard, who just got arrested for planning a terrorist attack inside the United States of his citizenship?
@realDonaldTrump Putin just threatened the United States you said nothing at all. Hoda will be back, because she is a US citizen.  You are about to find out, once again,  the limitations of the Presidency.
@Ronsoco67 @CNNnewsroom @CNN @jimsciutto Not enough to strip her of her citizenship. She'll be back in the US, watch.
@JohnWal35555323 @CNNnewsroom @jimsciutto So, will you strip the Coast Guard agent, who just got arrested for planning a terrorist attack inside the US, of his citizenship?
@MLSpencer1 @CNNnewsroom @jimsciutto She did neither.
@GovMikeHuckabee Abortion is ok, because it's a personal decision.
@axios He wasn't going to win anyway.
@TODAYshow @SecPompeo @craigmelvin In a normal administration this will not be news, but since this administration accomplishments are minimal,  they have to make news somehow to compensate from all the executive time.
@thehill @KatiePavlich @TheHillOpinion What views are those? Ending corruption?
@cnnbrk Good, now let's focus back on the President being indicted soon.
@Christi_Paul He should spend some time in prison to think about his stupidity.

@ShibleyTelhami So is the international community finally going to label Linkud a terrorist group?
@NewDay @Ryanyoungnews I knew. His story was full of obvious lies.
@BBCWorld Shame on him.
@MSNBC Good.
@erm32155 @GovMikeHuckabee No, not good point. Silly point from a silly old man.
@GovMikeHuckabee Because he is not deleting emails and hiding evidence.  The facts are clear in this case.

@NikkiHaley wow, did you miss the point.
@thehill Dumb parents.
@JoeGreaves504 @NikkiHaley How? prove it.
@NikkiHaley Ah! Ambassador, you should  be equally outraged about the lies Trump tells everyday.  The fake emergency to move troops at the border for no particular reason for example,  didn't he abuse the resources? Where was your outrage then?
@NOIweala Encouraging progress.  Let's keep it up.
@RWPUSA @11thHour Good luck.
@TheRickWilson Prison! Did I get it right?
@ShimonPro lock him up.
@StoneColdRoger @TylerPNixon How much did you get for betraying your country? Multiply it by zero, that's how much you will get.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog You mean lie?
@ShibleyTelhami I thought the Arab League was supposed to consolidate all the national priorities into one common objective, no?
@ShibleyTelhami Professor, can you explain to me why arabs are incapable of finding a unified stance against Israel.  From the end of the ottoman empire until today, it is easy to devide than to unite Arab nations,  why is that?
@yamasakimma Wow Enzo is a big boy now, Fernando must be extremely proud.  Congrats Kid, keep it up.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, your party has a significant majority in the Senate.  Your argument doesn't stand because you speed pass judges all the time.
@CNN Shame on him if he did that.

@thehill So based on this opinion,  I should wait until I am 60 years old to commit my crimes,  because of my age I might get special treatment.
@AmbJohnBolton So are you saying all those love letters  between Trump and the Chairman of the people's Democratic Republic of North Korea are inappropriate?
@MSNBC Is That's lie number 4000 now?
@brianstelter Do they consider Trump their boss, or an accident of the 2016 election that will be rectified soon? I don't think they care one way or the other.
@EPOlengha Dans un pays normal, cet acte serait considÃ©rÃ© comme criminel. Vous faites pas confiance au systÃ¨me judiciaire?  Prendre la loi entre vos mains est synonyme d'anarchie totale.
@thehill Where was your opinion when Bill Cosby got sentenced to 10 years?
@RWPUSA I am not surprised, you both will probably support the apartheid white regime of South Africa if it was still in place.
@TPM ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
@thehill Forcing? He is a grown man, and the Senate leader, no one forces a US Senate leader to do anything. Mr. McConnell is voluntarily eating the sandwich and loving it.
@AnnCoulter Wasn't the campaign promise Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall? That promise was broken a long time ago, are you just getting mad now?
@LindseyGrahamSC Senator, I hope when a Democratic President declares a national emergency to ban certain types of assault weapons you will also firmly stand behind that President.  I am counting on you.
@BillOReilly So Mr. O'Reilly, you will also support a President from the democratic party declaring a national emergency for climate reform if Congress refuses to give him the funds?
@thehill The tax cut that increased the debt and deficit is not helping?
@AnnCoulter You tell him Ann.
@newtgingrich What criteria are you using to compare the 2? Macron is unpopular because he is trying something many French leaders feared to do, reform certain areas of the French social economy,  Trump approval rating is at 44 percent because 85% of his job was already done by Obama.
@business @bopinion I think this headline should read: Trump is clearly elated about Senator's  Burr's unsubstantiated remarks.
@ShibleyTelhami So how can the US remain the mediator of the conflict between Israel and Palestine when their (US) objectivity in the process is for sale?
@TPM She told the truth.
@CNN Why should she resign? She told the truth.

@RepMarkMeadows As if you did when you had the majority.  You are a comedian ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@DonaldJTrumpJr And of course low taxes means less revenue for the government and since Mexico is not paying for that wall, you need to cut spending or you will bankrupt America.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Lol, so how are you going to build that wall when people are paying less on taxes, a loan from Russia?
