@GavinNewsom According to the right walls work, according to the left gun control works. 	Neither side thinks the other side is correct, but neither side is willing to compromise. 		It's not about what's in the best interest of the people, it's about winning or losing.		Welcome to America.
@tDavisforCAgov @GodnCountry_ @GavinNewsom Its absolutely a woman's right to choose. I agree 100%.  But it's my right to disagree. 		So why should I have to pay for it?
@GavinNewsom Why is everything about Trump?  		Why don't you just run California and quit acting like some anti-trump superhero?		Btw how about being straight with California about taxes, instead of just telling us what YOU think we want to hear???????????

@LadyThriller69 Women always deserve that level of respect.
@GavinNewsom The reason they tax 'gallons' of gas and 'ounces' of soda is because it potentially adds up to billions. 		I mean how much can you tax a cheese burger, right?		It's all about big dollars.
@GavinNewsom Help us understand the 2 cent per ounce sugar drink tax.  Are you trying to prevent people from buying it? Why not just ban it?  Or put a limit on the amount of sugar?  		Or could it be it's just a way to generate more revenue?

@NotGbo Some calculated chart isnt enough to take precedence over fair taxes, healthcare, affordable housing, immigration, abortion, government debt, crime, inflation, families, disease, war, trade, race relations, wildfires, laws enforcement, etc. etc.  		Take care of each other first.
@NotGbo Its something. I'm not sure exactly what. It says an increase of .0072-.0008c degrees a year. Is that enough to freak out over?
@NotGbo So, if I'm reading it correctly. Since 1850 the GISTEMP is showing an increase in surface temp of about 1 degree celcius.

@Richardw55 @ffmedic402 @GavinNewsom Agreed. Technology, immigration court efficiency, border patrol, daca, laws, and a barrier are all part of the equation.  But California taking a fight the GOP stance, and pulling security away in protest is asinine.
@GavinNewsom So 400k apprehensions last year should just be ignored and treated as no big deal?  I'd also like to add that is only the people caught, not the people who made it through.
@Richardw55 @ffmedic402 @GavinNewsom It's not the biggest issue, you are correct.  Nor will it stop all traffic. But the idea to approach your nation's security for all it's people is a fantastic place to start.

Everyone has different qualities of life, but if people want to have more meat at the end of the week, than they should ge more hours. 		Plenty of jobs to go around.
@RealJamesWoods @Woke2008 How can we when REPUBLICANS keep throwing her in our faces.
@SenSanders Yes, stop it Mr president.  You need to give the Democrats everything they want so that they can piss on what you and a lot of other people want.		Sounds fair.
@mitchellvii My 19 year old came to me and said trump is a racist because he wants to build a wall and keep Mexicans out. I asked him why he thinks that, his only response was that 'everyone knows it'.   		The media is not your friend.

@carcar_vino @GavinNewsom Not a damn thing but pass on new taxes. 		Democrats are so stupid.

@GavinNewsom Nothing will happen with rent prices as long as values go up.  That's the bottom line.  		Oh yeah, enjoy all those new taxes to add to it!		Democrats are so stupid.
@MooreGd @GavinNewsom Right?  Sounds like hes trying to be on 'our side' while we get taxed to death.
@SacKingsCentral @NBCSKings @James_HamNBCS Exactly, we would also be top 5 in the west. 		14 points, 9 rebounds, and 3 assists per game doesnt add enough to a team with the speed and accuracy of the Sacramento Kings.
@SacKingsCentral @NBCSKings @James_HamNBCS ..buddy, and the rest of the speed and shooting on the team.  They can score like nobodies business, but they lose it underneath every single time.
@SacKingsCentral @NBCSKings @James_HamNBCS A big man. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Cauley-Stein.  Hes grown a lot, but gives up too many offensive rebounds, misses way to many shots underneath, and in my opinion is not the piece to take kings over the top. They need more power in the middle to compliment fox.......
@SacKingsCentral @NBCSKings @James_HamNBCS That makes more sense.  Thank you. 		Now how about that power in the middle?
@NBCSKings @James_HamNBCS They need more power in the middle.  Why waste 12m bucks on a back up point guard?

@SenSanders @BizHealthPol We all know that Canada pays a 40% payroll tax along with a 10% wellness tax right?  		Am I the only one here with a mortgage?
@SenSanders Just like the 28b 'security' bill that YOU have supported in the past.
@ChuckCallesto They both are. Secure the borders, invest in the citizens, then work on the needs (healthcare, air, and alternative energy) for our great country.  		I don't know why everything is so this or that.
@gabeseanelias @Dist_5 @GavinNewsom Hey Gabriel, just curious. If they go to a 40% flat payroll tax, 15% sales tax, and 8% wellness tax like Canada, are they going to lower my mortgage payments?
@RepJoeKennedy @jilevin Then open the border.  Let everyone in!  Woohoo its a party!!!
@yelhsamorris @PatriotMike6 @Rock_n_Rollerr You should actually be upset that 28b got blown and didnt do anything to help the situation. 		If you believe something should be done, then what's wrong with trying it out for just 5b?		Instead of just doing the same old stuff that clearly doesn't work.
@yelhsamorris @PatriotMike6 @Rock_n_Rollerr Sooo Schumer and Pelosi voting for 28b on border security, when nobody had any clue how the money would be used is ok.  		Now Trump is being up front about just 5b and telling everyone exactly what he wants to do, suddenly is a problem?

@thinkermachine @RealTT2020 @ragon_gregg ....throw us a tax and registration hike that we were NOT allowed to vote on. Plus, prop 6, the 'fix the roads' campaign was worded so that in the future, they can continue to raise taxes and registration without a vote. You seriously see that as ok??
@thinkermachine @RealTT2020 @ragon_gregg I'm aware of the prop. I'm talking about the original gas tax that gave them the surplus. 		Besides 6% of the budget is already supposed to 'fix roads' but they po unit off, put it off, until they need are desperate.  Instead of redo budget they....
@thinkermachine @RealTT2020 @ragon_gregg 3b out of 5b surplus to expand healthcare for illegals??  While our schools fail???  Your defending a bunch of self absorbed, power hungry, overtaxing politicians that dont give a damn about you.

@damarisblaq_ @babafemi9 Too expensive.
@thinkermachine @RealTT2020 @ragon_gregg The surplus budget is because of the .30 a gallon gas tax that got implemented the same year of the surplus.  Which Californians were allowed to vote on. Browns final year also. 		Also just fyi:		California is 2 trillion in debt.

@dcchroniclenews Democrats dont want the wall because it may have a tremendous effect on illegal immigration and VOTES.		Think about it. If the wall actually stops 90% of the immigration issue, than Trump will be proven right. 		Making things very hard for Dems.		This is a political strategy.
@LindseyGrahamSC He also needs to stand tall and own the shut down. 		Not, blame the libtards for what he clearly said he would take responsibility for.
@americancowgir3 Wrong. 		Trump flat out said he will "take the mantle" and own the shut down. 		He needs to man up and stand by his words, and accept the consequences of what he says.

@redmondlonghorn @Pissyjo @prettyjosie26 @NancyPelosi Fiscal problems occur when the people vote for propositions that have sub props attached to them.  Like allowing ca Gov to pass gas tax and registration hikes without a vote by the people.
@redmondlonghorn @Pissyjo @prettyjosie26 @NancyPelosi Ive hired many illegals in my restaurant management career to know exactly how they work their taxes, and what they do with the money they make.
@redmondlonghorn @Pissyjo @prettyjosie26 @NancyPelosi They pay sales tax. Not withholding. Claiming zero exempt eliminates state and federal taxes, and at the end of the year they are untraceable. 		Sound public policy is investing in children's education and infrastructure correctly.  Not spending 3b on illegal immigrants.
@Pissyjo @redmondlonghorn @prettyjosie26 @NancyPelosi I dont think it's going to happen.  California is HUGELY democratic and has no signs of change at all.  They are going to tax us to death and feed who votes for them.  Pure and simple.  Plus, cali cant even fund their own schools.  Its beyond logic.
@redmondlonghorn @Pissyjo @prettyjosie26 @NancyPelosi Californias legislators are voting in January to extend health benefits for illegal immigrants to the tune of 3 billion dollars, and I guarantee you it's going to pass.

@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom The Democrats are using the media to just get you to fight their battles for them. They want power, and you are a puppet.  Why do you not see this????
@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom ....the difference is its trump. The Democratic party did the same exact crap that Trump is doing. Obama didn't want his name attached to it. He KNOWS it's a problem. So he backed off to let someone else deal with it. Theres YOUR hero.
@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom Your philosophy has so many issues with it. You want to let them all in and just wait and see who breaks the law? That's insane. Plus, you do realize that Obama used pepper spray in 2013 under the same kind of scenario right?  Same border, almost at the same time.....

@DarthpaulyMy @a7160957 @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump I didn't say a word about Trump. Nor did I say I agree with everything he does. I was talking about the caravan
@DarthpaulyMy @a7160957 @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump The immigrants who are already in the United States and the ones who are doing it legally, with honesty and integrity, have priority.  That's just simple and logical thinking. To think that we should bypass all of them for a caravan that just shows up at the door is absurd.

@a7160957 @DarthpaulyMy @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump Trying to have a conversation with the left is like trying to have a conversation with a 2 year old child, temper tantrums and undeveloped minds.
@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom Court dates for asylum hearings are 4 years out in California.  Again, so the new process is caravans first, give them court dates, and say well see you on four years. Your own party doesnt even believe that's the right thing to do.
@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom So the immigrants in the country (who I believe should be vetted and legalized) already dont matter. The people doing it legally dont matter. The new process is caravans first? I support legal immigration 100%, so your 'white' comment is useless here.
@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom Support gassing children?  That's a ridiculous conclusion.  If you were president, what would you do?
@DarthpaulyMy @JoyAnnReid @a7160957 Mr. Darth. I have question. What should be done with a group of 7500 migrants who show up at the border throwing rocks and tearing at a border fence who have already been told they will not be allowed to enter the country? Dont give me a liberal thought. What do YOU think?
@CassandraRules @dettas61 We will never see pictures of why tear has was used in the first place. Media manipulation at its finest.
@grantmargetts @realDonaldTrump Why dont people just say what they really want? Anyone who shows up at the border and claims asylum should be granted and set free with a court date. Because nobody will be happy until that happens.
@indeliblue @flyfishmark @RomanState36 @GavinNewsom Here's the problem. If we dont let them in, than we are bad people. If we let them in and detain them until court, were bad people. Nobody will be happy until they are in the US and free to go about business. For the next group, same thing.
@RomanState36 @flyfishmark @GavinNewsom The left is tugging at your heart strings to promote hate towards the right. Your right it's not illegal to claim asylum. No kidding. It's also not illegal to have control of your own borders.
@BasiaSosnowska @mesparza562 @debra_alden @Aidansheart @GavinNewsom @MartyCaswell You think we should just pass everyone who shows up at the border hungry and tired?  What about the people already waiting to enter?

@Docsociology4 @peterbakernyt That is so wrong. Obama's job creation was due to companies hiring millions of part timers. It was a point for jobs, but in the way you think.
@waltshaub @peterbakernyt WRONG!  Obama's job creation was all part time under Obamacare. It was a smart move by him given what he was given.  But this jobs chart is completely misleading.

@perfectsliders @jerryterm Trump took away the mandate of requiring to give insurance, and STILL IMPROVED THE JOBS market. If that's not genius, I dont know what is. Gives people full time work, more money, and better opportunity. It's a no brainer.
@perfectsliders @jerryterm Well, he did. Obama's jobs came from employers needing more people from part timers. Any emp that worked over 29.5 hours was given ins opportunity. But employers didnt want to pay benefits. So emps were kept under 29.5, needing more part timers. Created jobs, not careers........
@proudchicagoan @JSpragens @ninaalissa @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr Dont believe it when you hear that trump wants to get rid of Medicare and social security. That is a fear driven tactic by dem leaders to win the house. Is it being cut?  Yes. BUT, it goes right back into it. But they wont tell you that part of it.
@proudchicagoan @JSpragens @ninaalissa @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr The money is being redirected through the same systems,  over time to save money on the deficit. You dont just cut and save on the same day. Investing smart gives you a better return later on. It doesn't happen overnight. Took Clinton 6 years. 		https://t.co/3u2ZCYjmGf
@proudchicagoan @JSpragens @ninaalissa @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr Your assuming everything and predicting the future. Hes already ordered a 10% cut on the budget. The deficit will come down in due time.
@AgainNotme @JSpragens @ninaalissa @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr Well it's not because your federal tax has gone up, because they haven't, fact. I live in the beautiful liberal state of California.  Let me know if you would like to have a conversation and I'll be happy to show you what liberal taxes are capable of.
@proudchicagoan @JSpragens @ninaalissa @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr Its only been 2 years?!?!? It took Clinton 6 to get the deficit under control..I'm not knocking Clinton,  kudos for the deficit. But let Trump do his job and let's see what happens.

@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Well since I'm a citizen, I wont have to work for $7 a day.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews All honesty. I'm not scared of anything, and if trumps economy doesn't improve, he will not get my vote.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews And it still blows me away that you think most of the heroin comes from the east, when in reality 95% of it comes from the south. Maybe you should start paying a little more attention to the southern border? Wait, you cant do that, because then you'll be called a racist.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews ..last, we're not fear filled followers. You've liberal written all over that. We believe in laws. We believe your rights, we believe in this country and the citizens in it. We believe in the constitution and your rights. We're not in fear of anything.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews ....and the response that you would do nothing, and just let whoever handles it handle it, is a cop out. It was honest question......
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews So you lose me on that.  Also, yes, if I had to pick crops as a job to pay Bill's and support my family, you bet your ass I would. So would every other Republican out their, cause were not lazy....
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews That 'picking' thing bothersome because it stereotypes. For me, my career was being a GM for very high profile restaurants that you have eaten in. The Mexicans I know worked their way up to making 70-75k a year plus bonuses in management. They own businesses and have success.....

@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Maybe I didnt ask correctly. I didnt ask what about trumps plan do you not like, or what you wouldn't do.  I asked, what would YOU like to see happen when they arrive?
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Well theres 2 parts that interest me about that last statement, and I'll ask about the first one. When and if this caravan gets to the border, what is your opinion on what we should do?
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Your completely missing the point.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews We both know theres an illegal immigration problem. I'm looking for these specific caravans you speak of.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Yeah. Because the creepy porn lawyer said so right?
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Scroll down to where it says the heroin is coming from, and read the whole section. 		https://t.co/SQtgSEf7PF
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Show me the last 3 7k person caravans, since it's not uncommon.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Whatever you say champ. https://t.co/Ok9zuSXmdc
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Now your just another liberal idiot.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Your being used by the Democratic media to get you to believe hateful things about trump and his supporters, so that they can win back power.  You have to understand this. Your completely misjudging the reality of what I, we, stand for.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews That's not a fair argument. 90% of the heroin and opioids that are smuggled into the United  states come from Mexico. Not to mention human smuggling and cartel. If you have proof that just as much comes from Canada, I'd love to see it.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews I do think its overkill. I also believe there has to be a better way. But as long as the powers that be  both refuse to talk, it will never change. You have your point of view and I have mine. But if you and I were controlling it, we could compromise and figure it out.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Being used for political gain?  Tell that to Dr Ford.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews .....trump supporters are NOT racist. We are not anti immigration, we are not trying to close borders, and we dont like anyone to suffer.  We are trying to ENSURE the safety and well being of you, your friends, and family.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews ...then what what about the next one? It the one after that?  Where do we draw the line?  Isn't better to know what your doing and be smart about things instead of just opening the doors and hoping we dont pay for it later to the price of American lives?....
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews ...if we were opening the door for them, do you not think that smugglers, gang members, and cartel would not see this as an opportunity to enter the US?  Of course they would. Plus, if we allow this caravan to just come across willy nilly....
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews I think a majority want help. I think their living conditions are horrible, and most of them are probably looking for the opportunities that you and I are blessed with.  I get it. But, theres a problem.  WE CANNOT JUST ALLOW ANYONE AND EVERYONE TO BE GRANTED ASYLUM......
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Here's the bottom line, you cannot allow and caravan to come across the border and just grant asylum at their convenience. If that was true, than everyone would be doing it. There is a 2 year waiting list of people doing it right, and they should not be set aside for this at all.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews The picture was taken at the Guatemala Mexico border on Oct 19th in front of the American embassy by a photographer following the caravan. It's a real picture. There are fake ones out there, but not that one. It was miscaptioned saying it was actually in Mexico.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews https://t.co/hO5i6DrR9C
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Now your just making stuff up.
@DarthpaulyMy @AlanMByers @FoxNews Because that many extremists burning our flag has the potential of being a bit of a problem.  Do you not agree with that?  Show me a convoy of migrant workers that size that are doing the same things. I'm always willing to learn.

@sconsinvet @bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews And if you think not one person wants open borders, think again. Theres an entire movement that is backed by people running for office right now that want open borders.
@sconsinvet @bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews Then why dont dems talk about it?  We have 7000 people headed to the border right now and all that's coming from the left are crickets. Why?  Because all they want is DT to look bad while he deals with, what they know, are major issues. It's all about gaining power. That's truth!
@jgcarey80 @tjvigil8 @bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews How?  How (and why if your illegal) would someone pay taxes without a social security number?  Have you ever claimed exempt on your paycheck to make a little extra cash?  It's a huge difference. Now imagine that all year long.
@StarkToINFINITY @Try_Reason2 @garyamiles @FoxNews I was referring to Gary Miles comment on unstable trump supporters. Pay attention.
@sconsinvet @bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews I'm aware of that. But at least I'm talking about ways to deal with it. Dems just want to argue it without coming up with ideas to deal with illegal immigration. Unless of course you think we should have open borders?
@jgcarey80 @tjvigil8 @bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews That's why I said one time major cost. I'm not really that big of a fan of the wall in the first place, I think there are better ways to deal with it. I was referring to illegals paying taxes. That's just not a true statement.
@tjvigil8 @bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews Ok. I managed restaurants for 30 years. Illegals claim exempt and have no fed or state taxes taken out of their checks. Fake SSN, so no taxes at the end of the year, AND all the $$$ they make go back to Mexico. I've seen all this first hand over and over again. So YOU try again.
@StarkToINFINITY @Try_Reason2 @garyamiles @FoxNews I have a great job, own my beautiful home, married to my best friend, 401k, money in the bank, equity in my house, educated, and I have every weekend off to enjoy what I work hard for. Oh yeah, I also support Trump. Unstable is a word used by DEMS to control YOU. Not me.
@SNDLong69 @FoxNews Agreed
@bhoy_67 @mlegwin88 @FoxNews Its called long term investment. Trying comparing the one time major cost of the wall vs the next 10 years of paying for illegal immigration.  The numbers would be staggering.

@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders Last I heard the count was 7600. 		But I think the immigrants who are already in the country should be vetted and legalized first, before 4k-8k people should just be let into the country. 		If we allow that to come through,  I guarantee there will be much more groups following.
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders Let's get to the issues at hand. How do you feel about the growing caravan coming up through Mexico?
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders ...business all over the world.  Shit happens and you have to deal with it one way or another i.e. pay ot off and move forward.
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders And that could be true,  But I know that if I was a billionaire many times over and I was running for president, I would want to just pay it off and move forward, instead of dragging it out for years, and so would you. He opens and....
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders ...he did not 'acknowledge' that he ripped off anyone.  This is taken from a CNN story. I can send you the link if you'd like.
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders It was actually 25m, and it refunded the 6000 students that paid into the school 90% of their money.  It was based on the students saying the school wasn't licensed, but it was. It could have gone to court, but Trump settled to close the case and run for president.......
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders Not at all.  If it's TRUE yhan that's a shitty thing to do.  Show me him acknowledging it.
@TallManShort @SenGillibrand Hey @SenGillibrand there were 44.5 million abortions between 1970 and 2014 in the US alone. 44.5 MILLION! How many of those were about 'saving womens lives'?	Why dont you try talking about morale responsibility and supporting families instead of abortion.
@J03G4M3R @BernieSanders If you give me some kind of fact that bothers you about him, I'd be happy to listen with an open mind. But when you spew nonsense like Kim love letters, all you show is heart felt ignorance. Yes he plays golf, as do I and every other president. Give me something real.
@G_WWG1WGA @MAGAMaggieMay Between 1970 to 2014 there 44.5 million abortions. I get a woman's choice, I even support it, in spite of my own beliefs. But that number is pretty mind blowing. Stick to family and good to yourself. #makegooddecisions #MAGA

@MaryPrincipio @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump ....is the drugs and the money. Human life is irrelevant. What about their safety?  Their lives?  No one cares, it's all about get Trump.

@Chuck_Red87 @Weedyouneednews So then it doesn't matter the outcome of the investigation.  It's all just a waste of time. Even if there's no corroborating evidence,  there will still be riots.  Even though, this is all the Democrats are asking for.
@Chuck_Red87 @Weedyouneednews The question isn't, is she a victim.  The question is, is Kavanaugh guilty or not guilty.  He needs to clear his name in order to sit on the bench with no skeletons.

@jkrhodes0719 @flybymidwest @KatiePavlich I agree with you, but rumors aren't proof, and the Dems say that's what they're asking for, plus it will take away a lot of lingering clouds for Kavanaugh. I think it's  a good idea.

@flybymidwest @KatiePavlich Dems said a week. Give them that. 1 week for a lifetime seat?  There shouldn't be any problem with that.
@KatiePavlich Wrong, give it a week for true transparency.  Get both sides on the same page moving forward.  There's no reason it cant go a week.
@nanandjim @FoxNews @ChrisCoons If Kavanaugh comes back clean, it may even help Trump's credibility as well.  This should all be as transparent as possible for everyone to be able to come together. It can move the country in the right direction, or it can be a total disaster.
@nanandjim @FoxNews @ChrisCoons Let's have a brief investigation that does not interfere with the midterms and see if he can clear himself. Anyone who sees anything wrong with that isn't thinking very clearly. Kavanaugh should be behind that 100%.
@NewtonOsprey @nanandjim @FoxNews @ChrisCoons We'll soon find out.
@JamilaWehner @nanandjim @FoxNews @ChrisCoons I agree. It's in Kavanaughs best interest to have a brief investigation. If the vote is rushed, he'll have a cloud over his head that will follow him for the rest of his life, and his judgments will never be 100%. Do the investigation, clear things up, and let's move on.

But if you are labeling him as guilty just by an allegation or a feeling for RAPE, than there is as something wrong there. BUT if you already have proof, than please educate me.
@ddoischen @Barb4__Trump @RickJ210 @realDonaldTrump They are not our enemy,  but if you dont know that every single one of those countries are ONLY out for themselves, than you would be wrong. Laughing or not, they know that with the US, your either with us or against us. End of story.
@Swankssss @Monica70293694 @TyMitch9 @IngrahamAngle @WashTimes Exactly!
@CariniGambarini @WhiteHouse Hes being 100% straight up to the entire UN. That's called transparency and balls. What exactly is it that you want in a president?  I mean seriously, you want to give everything away so other countries will be happy?
@CariniGambarini @WhiteHouse Apologize for what?  For not being a bunch of pussies?  Pull your head out of your ass and wake up!
@DLoesch Puring their names together sustains the agenda against kavanaugh. Its disgusting.
@the_real_Lord @DLoesch Because hes put in a position of having to defend himself, and people are actually believing hes GUILTY of organizing gang rapes!?!?
@chrisgast @JarrettBellini @DLoesch Seriously right?  Gang rapes???  There's horribly wrong with this country when high powered idiots use the media to mass produce their idiotic words and the public actually believes it.
@1profitmakernow @DLoesch Especially in the 80s.
@1stgrace108 @leaplings @SenBlumenthal I realize she's a doctor and a respected woman. I have no issue with her and I want to believe her. But without witnesses, proof, or testimony. What would like everyone to do?
@1stgrace108 @leaplings @SenBlumenthal They've been trying to get her to testify so that can get information that goes beyond just a letter. How is anyone supposed to investigate and ask questions if she doesn't talk?  4 people at the party dont have ANY recollection of any issue?
@1stgrace108 @leaplings @SenBlumenthal Because there is only an allegation. Last I checked its innocent until proven guilty.  Not the other way around.  Mrs Ford has a responsibility to show her case, if its true than no scotus for kavanaugh.  But your a fool if you just accept allegation as truth.
@SenBlumenthal Sooo 4 witnesses so far from the party, and none of the are corroborating Fords story. Aren't we supposed to have proof of something before we start hanging someone?  Or do we just take people's words for everything now.
@repholtzc @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump You see a picture with some lines and numbers and you call it facts?  You must be incredibly smart!
@Airvooocht @repholtzc @realDonaldTrump Your graph doesn't include salaried employees in the United states.  Most salaried employees are middle class to lower.  Most salaried employees also get raises every year from 3%-5% depending on performance and inflation.
@_NotFakeNews_ That quote is not even in the article?
@wasabi @BernieSanders Bernie and reality are like oil and water.
@Chuck_Red87 @DebraMessing @wkstewart0615 @BetoORourke There's just as much ideological thinking that trump "allowed" Russia to get dirt as there is that Hillary did. It's an empty attempt to rally the democratic voters. That's all it is.
@Chuck_Red87 @DebraMessing @wkstewart0615 @BetoORourke It was in the cruz/beto debate clip. It was short clip so honestly im not sure.  But it's short clips and quotes like that make me say wtf?

https://t.co/5S8OvfP448
@cgrimsley1969 @Aijay_006 @FoxNews The fact is we've been hearing this stuff for a long time, how 'whoever' is talking so trump is going down.  Has anyone figured out that Trump is still our President?  Now Trump wants documents declassified. He sounds pretty safe to me.
@AltDfat @KLLorenson @FoxNews Explain to me exactly how Trump refuses to follow the law?
@killerdwarf7 Great sound!
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders I respect your philosophy, but disagree with the results.  Things always look great on paper,  but when it's really happening, it comes out a little different.
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders And why is Bernie pushing for higher wages?  Because the price tag of his ideas is really really really expensive.  Higher wages for you means higher tax payments to them. 		Think about it.
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders ....When you lose half your check, can you afford your Bill's?  What's the plan with that?  		I dont need to come up with a plan because I was able to use common sense and not settle in my life. 		You support Bernie,  you tell me the plan.
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders ....wants to do free education,  Canada does NOT have free education. Hence the 50+ trillion quote I gave you earlier, it's very accurate.  You will lose half your paycheck. Period. Dont think its just the rich, not in a socialistic society....
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders I'm not saying a word about the Republican tax cut. That's not nothing to do with it.		Oh but your tax rate WILL change my friend. I speak with people from Canada and the tax rates I gave you are universal. Also keep in mind that Bernie.....
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders ....when my check gets cut in half, will my creditors cut my Bill's in half?  		Or do you think I'm going to get paid twice as much?  		I dont see that happening.
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders 1) no, I dont want elderly to starve. 		2) raising minimum wage doesn't answer my question about expenses. In fact, when minimum wage increase hits, typically prices go up.		3) single pay has been said to save us 2-3 trillion. 		Still needing an answer to my question though.....
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders ....a 15% sales tax.  If we go by way of Bernie, are my finances (mortgage, insurance, car, utilities, etc.) going to go down to compensate?  I cant afford to give away 50% of my check. I dont think a lot of people can.
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders Don't you think that all the things that Bernie wants to do are going to be really really expensive?  It goes beyond 50 trill easily. Where in the world will that come from?  I just have questions. Canada pays a 40% payroll tax, among other taxes, and.....
@NastyWomanSammi @happyvoter2 @mkraju I also might add, she talked to investigators whenever they needed to ask her questions. She was open and honest.
@PoliticKeyboard @SenSanders Not even close, by a looooong shot, of being enough.
@NastyWomanSammi @happyvoter2 @mkraju Oh I do understand. My daughter was molested by her mother's boyfriend for 8 years, until she told me. I called the police, they did an investigation until he finally admitted to it. If kavanaugh is guilty, so be it. But the guilty label before being investigated is so wrong.
@SenSanders Bernie, you must have some amazing idea to somehow create a LOT OF FREAKING MONEY!
@DonnaFo1982 @IndyTrivia @mkraju Guilty!  Nice....
@NastyWomanSammi @happyvoter2 @mkraju I hope you never get  accused of raping someone at work and the accuser keeps putting off talking to supervisors but walks around whispering it in people's ears. I hope the gossip doesn't get to your family and potentially ruin your life.
@DRUDGE_REPORT To the people who care if Michael Moore moves to Canada: Please, go with him.

@pemberleyfan @ida_skibenes Im sorry for what you went through, but do you remember where it happened?  Of course you do.
@Basquerading @GOPChairwoman @GOP Which Republicans are "insisting the FBI cannot" do an investigation?
@Chuck_Red87 @SonshiCom That's why I like you Charles.  Your a level headed guy with common sense.  But good luck getting trump,  Obama,  and even Bernie to sit down together and actually do what's best for the country.
@Chuck_Red87 @SonshiCom Well that's politics.  They use media to wash our brains, and then watch their little minions throw bombs at each other.  Welcome to America.
@Chuck_Red87 @SonshiCom I agree, especially in her case. But is she really coming forward?  She could be a hero for women's rights everywhere and prove that anyone on any level can do such a horrible crime. She needs to testify under oath and stand up strong. That would be more credible to me.
@Chuck_Red87 @SonshiCom "Its been many years since Kavanaugh tried to rape that girl".  That black dot in NO WAY should allow him to be a SCJ. But that quote alone is the problem in my opinion.
@Chuck_Red87 @HuffPost No, I dont want a rapist as a SCJ. Not in a million years. This whole thing is just really really weird, and people wonder why Republicans are saying  wtf?
@SonshiCom @Chuck_Red87 I agree, but on the other side, Kavanaugh is already guilty of something that hasn't even been investigated.  Hes being labeled as a rapist without any facts or evidence. Just someone making a claim. That's pretty scary. Want to stop something?  Make a rape claim.
@HuffPost @Chuck_Red87 I'm not even saying it didn't happen.  But this is just way to convenient to just be placed in people's minds right now of all times possible. Just before elections?  Just before votes?  Oh! BTW.....this happened 36 years ago...Incredibly odd no???
@Chuck_Red87 @HuffPost Huffington Posts, I wouldn't say that to you.  Come on.  This arrived to the surface just before the vote, and now she wont testify til the FBI investigate an incident from 36 years ago, not sure the date? Or Where?
@KevinAntJones @limarie44 @BernieSanders What do you want to do with them?
@BernieSanders What should we do with them?
@Metalmike3 But....not as much as Randy did for Ozzy.
@kathygriffin Who gives a flying fuck.
@TheRebelTV What's the hold up on Canada?  Is there something specific they are looking for?  I know the US is greedy, but what does Canada really want out of it.  Seems like a good thing for all 3 countries to be on the same page.
@HuffPost @Chuck_Red87 I have no idea if it's true or not.  But you can take your assumption of guilt and stick it up your ass.
@Metalmike3 Ronnie James Dio took Black Sabbath to a whole new level.
@IamARoosterMAN @fosshomes @JCWoods13 @Loudnsmom11 @MarkWarner No, your afraid of the truth coming out. Admit it, if Trump is proven to not have colluded with Russia, you will still be looking for other ways to hate him.  Why?  Because its personal for you and the Democrats.  Anything to win.
@B52Malmet Ummm let's see, the investigation is ongoing, no collusion. Separating children went on long before Trump. Also, what corruption exactly?  Please spell it out out for me.
@redsteeze @benshapiro Timing, delays, and not returning phone calls. If government is capable of all the things both sides are being accused of, than our government is more corrupt than Puerto Rico.
@McCormackJohn @benshapiro @nytimes We the people cant believe anything anymore.  We've come to a place in time where we are blanketed in so much media, that nobody knows what direction were going in. Especially when anyone can put anything out there knowing that millions and millions of people will retweet it.
@mskhamel @subsalr Maybe I'm a little slow, but I seemed to have missed the Mueller investigations results.  When did they happen?  So Trump was found guilty of collusion.  I wonder why I haven't heard that?
@LillyIbrahim @BeachActor @RealRomaDowney If hes found innocent in the whole "russiagate", will you lighten up a little?
@Weldin759 @littleredwagen @PloCoon @Kakeman64 @edizzle422 @FoxNews The sales tax rate of California is 7.25% Sacramento county and Sacramento city each tack on .5% each, so we pay in total 8.25%.  So in Canada you guys pay 40% to federal and 15% sales?  Is that what you pay total for your healthcare system?
@Weldin759 @littleredwagen @PloCoon @Kakeman64 @edizzle422 @FoxNews California
@littleredwagen @Weldin759 @PloCoon @Kakeman64 @edizzle422 @FoxNews If my wife and I make 8k a month, we'd pay 3.5k a month in taxes, and assuming that doesn't include state.
@SecularSpicoli @Kakeman64 @PloCoon @edizzle422 @FoxNews And that sounds great, its cheaper and you live longer. But I want real numbers.
@Weldin759 @PloCoon @Kakeman64 @edizzle422 @FoxNews Is it worth the 40% in the long run?  Since we dont pay that hear now, private insurance is around 5 to 8% for me.  I cant imagine 40% of my check being taken out.
@Kakeman64 @PloCoon @edizzle422 @FoxNews Look at Hitowers comment.  Canadians pay 40% in taxes. So your saying it's cheaper, but the question is cheaper for who?  Not me and you. Maybe in your description it's cheaper for the government?  Not sure what you mean by cheaper. Imagine 40% of your paycheck.
RT @charliekirk11: The Left claims to support vigorous background checks on gun purchases for Americans. 		Why don‚Äôt they support the same‚Ä¶

Everyone 'feels' like he is guilty, so they band together and create a place of comfort for themselves. If he's found innocent, all those 'feelings' are going to be crushed and the hate for him will get worse.
@Chuck_Red87 @MrFilmkritik The money is held as evidence.  It doesn't go in anyone's pockets or towards costs. Unless you can show other accounting of where it goes. If it is actually used for something, than I'd be very curious on who's pockets it lands in.
@MrFilmkritik @Chuck_Red87 You guys are dumb.
@BernieSanders I just want to see Bernie become President so I can how he puts all his ideas together. That should be quite a show.
@thomaskaine5 Because they prefer shopping, vacations, nice furniture, make up, and manicures, instead of paying taxes. That was easy.
@DouglasUnwin @gourdnibler @pdockerty @realDonaldTrump Zero. He will be 100 times more of a topic than anything even having to do with the hurricane itself.

@BGabrielGO @DavidBegnaud @fema I agree to a point. But let me ask you. Does it really make sense the United States would just not help? It doesn't to me. My point is, Trump is being blamed for all of it, and that is just another example of how it's just popular to wrongfully hate him.
@BGabrielGO @DavidBegnaud @fema Sooo........Are we all learning that the United States actually DID do all it could to help PR, and that it's THEIR local government that fucked it up????? So Trump was right?????   No way.

@reina_de_espana @SenSanders Everyday seems to be a different fight for Bernie.  Soooooooo who's going to pay for all of these things?

@FoxNews @dbongino Just the fact alone that Obama is even at the forefront, shows the lack of direction the Democratic party has. Zero direction, zero ideas, and no leadership that explains their position on any policies. The only things they have are Obama and take down Trump. Sad.

@DaveLeeC3 @Chuck_Red87 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama Agreed. They wont be unbeatable, but definitely playoff material if the defense can hold up. I just hope RS brings close to the same intensity he did with Seattle. If he does, then this could be their year, since its defense that wins games. Along with a few points on the board.
@DaveLeeC3 @Chuck_Red87 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama I think Jimmy is going to do great. He gives them exactly what they needed, hence the 5-0 run at the end of last year. The injury will hurt a little,  I think short passes and 3rd and 2 running may actually get them to the playoffs this year. Their defense also is better.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama The fires are crazy. I literally wake up to ash on my house and my car.  I haven't heard anything about prisoners helping, but I wouldn't doubt it. But the firefighters here are some bad ass dudes.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama NBA.  Huge Sacramento Kings fan. I go to their games all the time. We suck, but hey, I go for the underdogs. What can I say?  NFL is still good though. I'm a Niners fan as well.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama You too
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama It's a 50/50.  California has a responsibility to these fires also. Our forests are protected and cant be touched. Not even dead timber (fuel) everywhere. If California doesn't want help with preventing future fires, then the state bares responsibility.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama ....I would have more respect for the left. But the 'get trump' doesn't win my vote on policies.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama .....Democrats*
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama Lol. Yes.  He's definitely an egomaniac. But!  He deserves a full term to find out what he's capable of. I believe that. If would would just give me some king of idea on where they stand with economy,  defense, illegal immigration, trade, schools, or anything.....
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama That's another thing. Lottery is supposed to help teachers and schools, yet we have teachers making 35k a year and buying their own school supplies???? Its like that everywhere.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama The the summer comes with the biggest wild fries in history, and Brown criticizes the trump administration for not helping enough. California, like many other unions are financially irresponsible and look to blame trump for everything.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama That gas tax that was supposed to 'fix roads' suddenly gave us a 500 billion dollar surplus during the last year to spotlight the 'good' of Browns office, which was total BS.  Keep in mind that tax was forced. Now suddenly we get to vote to keep it or not in November....
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama They still have to bare some responsibility.  Here's my opinion on the lefts economic policies, I live in California. Governor Brown forced a .30 a gallon gas tax law in California during his last year in office, and an election year obviously......
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama That promise will be easy for this administration. That's the easy part. The hard thing for trump is getting people to understand that he's not a the racist devil he's portraits as and is trying to help the US.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama New to Twitter, I use to look at Facebook and Google for news, but then I discovered Twitter and found that there actually is politically intelligent life out there. Been hooked for the last month.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama But it doesn't stop me from agreeing with trumps policies. I also think that Puerto Rico needs to take some responsibility and not put it all on this administration. The fact that aren't perfect is not all our government's fault. We wont have another 9/11 under trumps watch.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama But that's not going to crash the economy at all.  But it is a problem. It's called personal responsibility. Students go to college, accept the debt and need to pay it back. Period. The way to do that is to make sure there is opportunity for the graduates.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama Raising interest rates slows investment and limits opportunities. The budget needs to be redone, stopping funding outside countries wars, and get rid of ridiculous spending.  That's how we need to pay this shit down.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama I do realize this. But the structure and defense has to be strong to move forward, and that's not cheap. Once everything stabilizes and the huge spending becomes less, debt begins to come down. That goes for any business. It's only been a year and 8 months.
@Chuck_Red87 @DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama I dont think the follow through on Puerto Rico has been very good to be honest. 	I also dont think the bubble is going to burst either. We are currently positioned for growth, not a crash. Too many positive opportunities to move up.
@PeteStanius @LovelyLeyah2l @FoxNews @BarackObama ....and if anyone has a clue, please tell me the Democrats plan in illegal immigration,  border control, economy, trade, defense, and the GDP. If there is one. The 'take down Trump' policy will only go so far.
@DaveLeeC3 @Cali53291904 @GregShugar @FoxNews @BarackObama For 8 years???  What are you going to say when Trump's economy and GDP continue to improve and he begins to actually start paying down debt?  It will happen. That its because of Obama's policies spilling over?  Eventually your going to have to open your eyes.
@CharismaticRob @only_half_demon @SenSanders All schools are underfunded everywhere in my opinion.  But the blatant gas tax sham in California to me shows the complete idiocy of Democrats who vote left and swear how great Brown is.  Its disgusting, and one of the many reasons I flipped to the right with my votes.
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS44 The scary thing is that his whole ideology is to bash Trump.  Doesn't it worry anyone that people want to put a Democrat in office without really knowing what their plans are for policy and direction? Once he or she is there, then what?
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS44 @potus45 For now I guess I can see sharing it, even though it's been almost 2 years. But as the economy grows and the GDP gets higher and higher,  eventually it becomes Trumps.  Everyone said the same thing at the beginning of Obama's term also. Time will tell.
@rjgrund @GeraldoRivera @POTUS44 ....some kind of direction so that I can make good decisions when I vote. For now it all seems like I should either vote for someone that is actually walking and talking policy,  or vote for a party that the their only agenda is to take down Trump.
@rjgrund @GeraldoRivera @POTUS44 ....now he has no real responsibility to policy so he can go out and do what he does best, talk. People are buying into his good guy personality and buying is 'get trump' mentality with ZERO direction on policy. It's all talk. I would a dem leader come out and talk about .....
@rjgrund @GeraldoRivera @POTUS44 Everyone is forgetting the wars and overseas investing that we saw on a daily basis. People complained we put so much time and money into other countries that we weren't investing in the United States.  To me that was the big thing.  But he was a great talker, always has been....

@SenSanders Can anyone tell me the Democrats plan on making people feel safe, financially strong, independent,  trade, immigration,  or anything.  All I ever hear is the get trump and argue with everything he says and does.  What the plan dems?
@selfmade2469 @only_half_demon @CharismaticRob @SenSanders California=Liberal Sanctuary
@only_half_demon @CharismaticRob @SenSanders Which the people didn't even get a vote on that 30 cents a gallon gas tax. Then, miraculously, California ended up with a surplus during Jerry Brown's last year in office and an election year.  NOW, in November we suddenly get to vote to keep it or not. No trickery there right?
@FoxNews @BarackObama I wonder if the people working in the Democratic offices feel like crap because the grey matter they have doesn't function properly unless it laced with a little Barrack.
@benshapiro Sooooo The Democratic Party is really that blind in direction that they need Obama to save them.  I guess the 'get Trump' idea only gets you so far.
@JohnnyRizzo1 @benshapiro Agreed, but it does show the lack of leadership the Democrats have without him.
@Deplorable_Moi @FakiegrandeShit @MotherJones I would like to know the correct process for this as well please.
@r_ochs @Dwes2211 @SenSanders I also might add that the only person who is raising taxes is that POS governor running California.
@Dwes2211 @SenSanders So is mine actually.
@MatthewS100001 @timrhoades5 @NEWgamespage @SenSanders First I dont think he's intentionally not putting HVAC units in his warehouses because he doesn't want to spend the money. I think your reaching on that one. But you really think he should pay all his employees 100k a year with no return?
@timrhoades5 @MatthewS100001 @NEWgamespage @SenSanders Wouldn't it make better sense have Amazon create better incentives for their employees to grow through training and education to earn the money as opposed to just magically doubling their checks?
@MatthewS100001 @NEWgamespage @timrhoades5 @SenSanders I hate when people generalize and assume. But I guess that's just the liberal way.
@NEWgamespage @MatthewS100001 @timrhoades5 @SenSanders Emeryville California $15 an hour. So it depends on where you live.
@MatthewS100001 @timrhoades5 @NEWgamespage @SenSanders Doubling of minimum wage?  Did I read that right?  So your good with an order taker from McDonald's who 'forgot' to put no pickles on your burger making $30 an hour?????
@GoettaT @SenSanders Good luck with that.
@GoettaT @SenSanders Labor is a huge impact on bottom line.   If the labor goes up 5, 10, 15, 20%. That amount WILL be made up someplace else.  I agree, pay people more money.  But both ends have to be controlled or it just doesn't work.
@SenSanders But when the price of food and rent go up to match the wage increases,  were going to find ourselves right back to square 1. I hate to poop on your pop tarts, but that's exactly what's going to happen.
@FoxNews @PressSec @foxandfriends I support Trumps policies, but he continues to shoot himself in the foot over and over again with his constant Twitter attacks. He's going piss enough people to lose votes, I'm not convinced of 2018 and 2020. He need to shut up and just do his job.
@OttoWeinert @AnnCoulter Well, now Zina, and hopefully a few more people,  know how the media can twist things around so much, so that even a Puerto Rican can now be a white supremacist. #EnemyOfThePeople #MAGA
@SherryOdell16 @MichD9NP @cyclepath55 @FoxNews @BarackObama Who. Me?
@SherryOdell16 @MichD9NP @cyclepath55 @FoxNews @BarackObama You mean I have the queen of England AND Mr indivisibles proof of taking down Trump in a thread that I am in??? Holy shit my life just got better!!!!
@MichD9NP @SherryOdell16 @cyclepath55 @FoxNews @BarackObama ....and Omarosa has a recording of The President saying the 'n' word. If you trust your judgment to be controlled by CBS news, have at it.
@TrumpocalypseN @midlifecrs @FoxNews @PMorici1 @realDonaldTrump I'm not giving ALL the credit to Trump. YOUR giving all the credit to Obama.  When trump implemented policies everyone said they are going to destroy what Obama did. Yet the economy improved. It hasn't even been 2 years. Face it, he's doing a pretty good job.
@TrumpocalypseN @midlifecrs @FoxNews @PMorici1 @realDonaldTrump Great success? No, but success none the less. But it's going to go much higher, and Obama will continue to get the credit.
@TrumpocalypseN @midlifecrs @FoxNews @PMorici1 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, but you have to admit, its pretty impressive how much further 'Donny Dingleberry' has taken it in less than 2 years. Tell me, if Donny Dingleberry continues to grow and sustain the economy for 8 years, will he ever get credit?
@davvyk @BulletTackles @realDonaldTrump My family is very secure, thanks for the support though. Mine and my wife's 401k, home equity, and good jobs are taking very good care of us. Thanks.
@davvyk @BulletTackles @realDonaldTrump And again...attack Trump.  That's the only pot to piss in you Dems have.
@mrsdwilliams73 @JacobARossi @realDonaldTrump I disagree with the Lebron James comment. He seems to me like a pretty good guy. But I will say this.  Trump is a horrible speaker, no doubt. But he's not there to talk, he's there to do a job, and the job is getting done like it or not.
@phatchuckNYC @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/g7qpGQVg9H
@davvyk @BulletTackles @realDonaldTrump I also might add that everything he's doing is 100% consistent with his campaign promises.  I dont think I've ever see this kind of consistency from any president in my lifetime.
@davvyk @BulletTackles @realDonaldTrump The fact that I know where he's at, what he's doing, what he wants to do, how he's doing it, and where he wants to take the country.  Be real. The ONLY 'ideas' I hear from Dems is get rid of Trump. Why is that?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump At what point does Trump get credit?  2 years? 3 years? 4 years?  I just want to make sure I get back to you on that.
@CENSORWARS @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for that tweet. I support Trump, and I also believe in equal rights for ALL US Citizens.  Do I not count?
@BobKOrlando @FoxNews @BarackObama Talking is definitely what he does best.
@MichD9NP @SherryOdell16 @cyclepath55 @FoxNews @BarackObama By the way. The headline and the story of your own article say he WANTED Trump to win, not HELPED him win. Plus it's not even quoted.
@MichD9NP @SherryOdell16 @cyclepath55 @FoxNews @BarackObama Sooo from that you get collusion.  Um ok.  Even if Trump is cleared, the dems will still be crying. You know why?  Because that's all they have to go on. Get Trump. No focus, no direction, no original thoughts,  nada mi amigos. Attack Trump=votes.
@cfreshsobrookln @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Good one. I googled resistance and this came up. https://t.co/qXoVtX9v3Z

@FoxNews Does anyone really admire this guy?  The attention span of Americans is one of the many reasons we have so many issues.
@FoxNews @BarackObama Democrats lack of leadership and focus is staring at us right in the face. The only way the Dems get votes is by attacking and playing with hearts. No leadership,  no directions,  no original ideas, nothing.
@PastorMark_____ @FoxNews Because they want to be politically correct.  Its fashionable.  Bottom line.

@benshapiro Nice pic
@32jim2 @raj__i @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump That was dumb.
@jbf21 @benshapiro @AnnCoulter You have me beat by 2 my friend. It just didn't feel right looking at Metalica.
@VoiceofAlbion @benshapiro Oh well damn, I guess my 30 years of writing and producing don't match up to your gifts. Sorry to bug.
@jbf21 @benshapiro @AnnCoulter Metallica
@VoiceofAlbion @benshapiro Wrong
@WilliamCAdair @michaeljknowles @JoeBiden That's what happens when their only ideas and directions are to point out what they don't want. I'm still 2 years later trying to understand what they do want.
@NotLikeMost271 @bitofinfo @BernieSanders We have to think about the long run. I get it, free health care and tuition. But how much more do we pay?  Who handles the accounting?  What level of healthcare?  Giving up all that control, and handing the gvt 33tr worries me a little bit. Not counting tuition.
@SenSanders And if we have it your way, the people will be owned by government.
@therattz @DLoesch What if that's what the teachers want?
@BernieSanders THERE IS NO SHUCKS THING AS FREE!!  GET IT???  ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT (IN THEIR MINDS) STARTS PAYING YOUR BILLS. WAKE UP!!!
@SenSanders Because they like playing with your head.
@EricMcCammon1 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Trump is brilliant. If he can stay out of trouble, the possibilities are limitless.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Now if Canada comes on board than we will be working with our brothers to build a great future.  The potential of this is really impressive.
@CallMeSwitters1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee Dude, representatives of Mexico are even saying it's a great deal. Wheres the lie?? Plus, were getting along with Mexico!!  What the hell do you want?
@Hoopgreen @PressSec @realDonaldTrump It hasn't even been 2 years and he's already done more for this country than the last 2 presidents did combined. If he gets 6 more, he will wipe out the deficit without raising any taxes, maybe even major cuts. Yes, he's actually that good.
@Trump191658055 @ABC @IngrahamAngle @jonkarl 100% true
@liza943truelove @ABC @jonkarl Yeah, he's jealous.  Good call.
@mrdriven2112 @jgge123 @randolph_bourne @KevinMKruse @EsotericCD @djrothkopf Eventually your not going to be able to use that anymore.
@bseegmuller @johndvitale @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Its actually true.  Tell me something. When's the cut off time that you actually give your president some credit for the economy?  I'm seriously guessing never. #obsessed
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Obama took over a market that was dead in the water, there is no doubt about it.  But the housing market was going to turn no matter what and grow the economy. I'm not saying he didn't do anything, but not quite as much as you think.
@reissy1700 @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump In 2 1/2 years when the economy is better than it is today, will still be seeing and hearing this crap.
@jps4ua @GeraldoRivera I lived for 48.5 years as a Democrat. The last 1.5 years have completely changed me.
@GeraldoRivera This list would help with so many of the immigration issues.  Then close the trade deals, and end the Mueller investigation. Let's move forward as a unified country, and begin to take care of each other as humans being.
@BobLuke7 @Rumblepax @BernieSanders https://t.co/QCh24swdsO
@BobLuke7 @Rumblepax @BernieSanders I want to hear the answer to that one.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @IngrahamAngle WE wish EVERY CITIZEN in this beautiful country of ours great success. Regardless of race or culture.  Much love and respect to everyone.  #MAGA
@falcon1299 @teamsatyrboom @jeremymstamper @GarySWillie @danielpemb @Gunnnonni @SenSanders Hard work and ambition. If people don't feel they are making enough money, go make more.  Anyone who uses the word 'cant' is stifling their own opportunities.  I'm living proof of this and you cant convince me otherwise.
@JonTheEgg @Random_acct @BernieSanders Make your own money.  Educate yourself, work hard, take care of your family, build your credit, and buy a house. ANYONE can do that. Stealing from the rich is a cop out and an excuse.
@BernieSanders Make your own money.  Educate yourself, work hard, take care of your family, build your credit, and buy a house. ANYONE can do that. Stealing from the rich is a cop out and an excuse.
@JonTheEgg @BernieSanders First, what does that even mean to go after the wealthy and powerful? These major companies employee millions of people. I understand the idea. It's a great idea and gets a LOT of people to agree with it. There's just no real logic to it.
@JonTheEgg @BernieSanders ummmm ok
@BernieSanders Wait. Aren't you wealthy?
@Heartbreak1980 @djg1228 @BernieSanders Be very careful what your fighting for. Because what you get may go beyond what you ever expected.
@Heartbreak1980 @djg1228 @BernieSanders Your a blind fool
@Heartbreak1980 @djg1228 @BernieSanders Youd rather have open borders?  Remember, if we have just willy nilly borders from Mexico,  then we need to be open to the world.  Just ANYONE coming across. Stop and think about it for crying out loud. JUST. BE. LEGAL.
@BernieSanders No one cares about skin color, culture, or where your from.  All anyone is asking that you be legal!!!  What is wrong with that?? We need to protect the borders!! What do you want Bernie?? Open borders??? Protect American Citizens!!
@Densholm @mich_barnes @paultara9 @GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Was the money paid from campaign funds or personal-business funds?
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a damn good President when it comes to running the country.  But his moral compass is out to lunch, and as a Republican tax paying citizen,  I have to admit I have a problem with that.
@BurgerDogBoy @FoxNews @TeamCavuto @ICEgov For god's sake why????  To give you another thing to cry about?  I think you've created a big enough list to keep you happy for many years to come.
@Skoot62 @DrugboS @Nywolfman1962 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist Yeah, but.  It seems as though a lot of people are viewing the vetting process as discrimination.  Like its singling people out. Especially when there are children with them because they get caught up in it.
@Skoot62 @DrugboS @Nywolfman1962 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist I agree. But we should also check each person out thoroughly to ensure they are not here to do any harm, including background checks. Deport the bad apples, and legalize the good.  Then follow the same moving forward.
@Skoot62 @DrugboS @Nywolfman1962 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist It's a fair question for anyone.
@DrugboS @Skoot62 @Nywolfman1962 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist I can never get a straight answer on this, but maybe I'll get an answer from you since you seem very into this debate. Do you believe anything should be done about illegal immigration?  If so, than what?
@sergie37980798 @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump None of the above.  Now my question for you.  Should we be doing anything about immigration?  If so, than what?
@BernieSanders It's easy from the sidelines. But Bernie would get his ass kicked as president. Sorry, but its true.
@DrugboS @Skoot62 @Nywolfman1962 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist How do you know so firmly that is unconfirmed?  I mean if ICE is guilty of making up a story to arrest someone, I'm with you.  So help me understand your source.
@proudliberal5 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist Neither one of us were there and have no clue.  But my problem with ICE just stopping brown skin and saying 'papers please' makes no sense.  Ice is under public scrutiny and is micromanaged by everyone. Lying makes zero sense. But lying to cover someone's ass does make sense.
@proudliberal5 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist ....for Immigration Review (EOIR).		Mr. Arrona-Lara was brought to ICE‚Äôs attention due to an outstanding warrant issued for his arrest in Mexico on homicide charges."
@proudliberal5 @FoxNews @Jeff_Journalist "Mr. Arrona-Lara, a citizen of Mexico illegally residing in the United States, was taken into custody Wednesday by ICE Fugitive Operations Team officers in San Bernardino, Calif. Mr. Arrona-Lara is currently in ICE custody pending removal proceedings with the Executive Office..
@FriestLen @DrainOforDC @FoxNews @ellisonbarber @POTUS If he's caught lying and deserves to get impeached, than so be it.  But I am going to laugh my ass off if Mueller comes back with a no collusion verdict.
@maceman902 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/DiWLONgnL1
@HillaryClinton Maybe if your husband would have taken care of this issue, instead of getting his head polished off by Monica, we wouldn't have to be dealing with this incredibly complex issue right now and you'd be president.  Hypocrite.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I'm cool with trump, but this tweet is horrible.
@bullitt76 @DeanObeidallah @FucckkkTrump @EWdeVlieger @DJTMentionsBot @realDonaldTrump I don't have to listen to trump.  I just have to look at the economy.  Idiot.

@bullitt76 @DeanObeidallah @FucckkkTrump @EWdeVlieger @DJTMentionsBot @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because that makes a lot of sense.  The President Of The United States, the leader of the free world,  his GOAL was to put the US in a recession.  Genius.
@Died_Stoned @PMJohnHunt @benshapiro Exactly.  I'd be she has no tape with trump using the 'N' word.  Wouldn't that be like a priority?
@PMJohnHunt @benshapiro She is going to make millions off this book.  You think she's not going play this thing as long as she can?
@delco2dc @FoxNews Won't happen.  Neither will her political career.
@Mediaite @benshapiro Free health care! Free tuition! Open borders!  Let's just go all the way and give out free food!  Woohoo it's a party!
@MyInfoTiffany2 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy @realDonaldTrump Because 69% of Americans believe hype over reality.
@caravaggibro @group_angry @CotB1 @mitchmelmer @rondelaplaya @Mere_Earthling @RyanPowellSmith @HillaryClinton So you think illegal immigrants should be allowed to vote?
@jjspeacemaker @FredoCasillas @FoxNews Show me last years numbers genius.
@GabeD14 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends Time will tell.
