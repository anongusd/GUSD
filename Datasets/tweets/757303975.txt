@theknightofmeh @TXRGV1 @TheWayWithAnoa I wasn’t offended by her book recommendation, which I’ve read, and I am grateful she explained how she perceived what I said. While it’s not remotely what I intended, I apologized because I think it’s important we take responsibility for both what we say and how it’s received.
@mcbyrne @IlhanMN I agree. Thank you Melissa. Looking forward to talking with Congresswoman Omar.
@jackallisonLOL @elivalley @IlhanMN No, I don’t. As it’s been thankfully pointed out to me my reference to “as an American” could be taken as exclusionary, I hope anyone linking “Benjamins” &amp; from that song to criticizing a Jewish group can recognize it draws, even unconsciously, on centuries of anti-Semitic tropes
@joshuarolson @TheWayWithAnoa That is not what I meant &amp; apologize it could have been taken that way. I meant non-Jewish Americans need to call out anti-Semitic tropes &amp; the burden shouldn’t fall on Jewish Americans. Again, I am sorry for any implication Congresswoman Omar or anyone is more or less American.

@TheWayWithAnoa Good morning Anoa, when we see or hear racist or prejudicial tropes used, whether consciously or unconsciously, I believe we have to call it out.

@moorehn @anamariecox Her characterization of my election night was completely false. She had to amend the excerpt. I wish she would have asked me directly and wish now she would explain why she or her fact checker didn’t fact check.
@moorehn Hi Heidi-why do you back someone who didn’t fact check? This is what I don’t understand from a journalist or a reader perspective. Any light you can shed is welcome, thank you. And, I loathe bullies of all shades and am sorry if you’re ever bullied, for any reason. Never ok.
@moorehn Hi Heidi - I am not starting a war. I am asking that Amy fact check. I would ask that of any journalist of any gender. We need fact-based journalism always and acutely at this moment.
Hi Heidi - Amy failed to fact check with me. About small inconsequential things (hair) or bigger things (election night). She doesn’t dispute that. It’s also now clear she didn’t fact check at least some of her history. I care about facts and believe you do too. https://t.co/m6EWtEuZ35

Thank you Zack. Apology accepted. https://t.co/MUoDItmLDJ
Here is what @ZackBornstein tweeted implying I’d rather watch my children or any child or person die than...I can’t even finish this thought. In 2018 or any year, I hope we can agree it’s not ok to joke about children - or imply their parents would rather watch them die. https://t.co/rFkMz9We42
Hi Zack - if I were alive in 1944, I would be doing everything I could to save Jewish children and families, including my own. Grateful to not live in 1944 and no, I don’t think children should be the punchline to anyone’s jokes. Hope you have a lovely evening. https://t.co/U4ClZ2b69C
