@Morning_Joe @DelPercioS @DonnyDeutsch @DylanByers @VanityFair ‚ÄúSeattle, like other cities that have experienced a tech boom, has seen skyrocketing housing and rental prices, driven by the influx of highly paid tech workers. ‚Äú

@Morning_Joe @DelPercioS @DonnyDeutsch ‚ÄúHow many of Amazon‚Äôs highly paid employees will want to live close to the campus?

@Morning_Joe @DelPercioS @DonnyDeutsch So. Big ideas ‚Äúmaximalism‚Äù are what pulled Donald Trump &amp; Putin over the line in 2016. 	Big ideas that benefit the country &amp; benefit workers are what pulled AOC &amp; the other progressive freshmen into office 2018 [ Can you imagine if the Republicans had kept the house?! ]
@Morning_Joe @DelPercioS @DonnyDeutsch Hillary Clinton was unable to persuade enough Americans that her vision was the best approach. Too many voters saw her brand of Democrat as a holdover of the right-leaning conservative Democrats embodied by Bill Clinton ‚Äîwho was reacting to a Post-Reagan pro-business environment
@Morning_Joe @DelPercioS @DonnyDeutsch Ever since Reagan, 1980‚Äôs, the country has shifted right‚Äîto finally bring us to the donald trump moment. The Morning Joe Panel represents that right-of-center ‚Äòdemocrat‚Äô and full-bloom Republicanism that has become so disastrous to the nation.
@Morning_Joe No. @DelPercioS and @DonnyDeutsch are shifting the blame of the amazon move onto AOC? How is this possible. 		No. Look at the deal struck with Foxconn in Wisconsin. Amazon played‚Äîcollected data‚Äîon how many cities, regions. Tax giveaways to corporations has to stop.
Dangerous? 	@DonnyDeutsch 	No. AOC is moving the discussion from the far far right. 	your assertion is not true. The nation wants a progressive agenda. Finally we are hearing it in the halls of congress. 	It‚Äôs refreshing.
@Morning_Joe Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòMaximalist‚Äô approach as outlined by @mikeallen ‚Äîbig approach to things because Donald is too ill-informed, too incurious, to do nuance, subtlety, and complexity. This not leadership. This is dangerous‚Äîa tinderbox @AymanM @JoeNBC @morningmika
