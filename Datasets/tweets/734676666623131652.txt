Parliament debates no confidence motion - YouTube https://t.co/cHNIMenkeo
He says ‚Äúevery previous prime minister in this situation‚Äù would have resigned.		MPs have a duty to pass the no confidence motion, he says.		And that‚Äôs it
Corbyn says, if Labour wins this debate, then there will be a wide-ranging debate about the future.		But if the Commons does not pass this motion, then MPs should keep all options on the table. They should rule out no-deal, and the PM‚Äôs deal, which was roundly defeated yesterday.
But May should not even lift up the phone unless she is willing to rule out a no-deal Brexit and have constructive conversation about a people‚Äôs vote.		May says the way to avoid no deal is to back a deal. And she says some MPs are not willing to hold constructive talks with her.
Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, welcomes May‚Äôs offer of cross-party talks. He says, as a former coalition colleague, May knows the Lib Dems will work with others in the national interest.
Sarah Wollaston, the Tory pro-European, asks May to back a second referendum. May says MPs must accept the referendum result.
Labour‚Äôs Ian Lucas asks about the proposed Hitachi nuclear power station in north Wales when she met the Japanese PM last week.		May says she did raise this topic. But it is for the company to make a commercial decision about whether or not to go ahead, she says.
Nicky Morgan, the Conservative, asks May if she agrees that all MPs need to maintain maximum flexibility as they look for an alternative Brexit solution.		May says she will approach the talks in a constructive spirit. But it is important to honour the referendum result, she says.
Labour‚Äôs Ronnie Campbell says a recent survey said 4m workers were living in poverty. Will May call a general election?		May repeats the point about the number of people in absolute poverty being at a record low.

Tracey Crouch, a Conservative, ask about apprentices. May says she has met many young people who say that is the right approach for them.
Labour‚Äôs Yasmin Qureshi asks about the drug primodos, and research showing it caused deformities.		May says a minister is leading a review looking at what impact it had. That study will be considered very carefully
May says it is because there are so many views that she is holding discussions with MPs. She says article 50 cannot be extended by the UK on its own. The EU would only extend article 50 if there were a plan moving towards a deal, she says.
... Just as he has had to accept the need to leave the EU, will May accept the need to modify her red lines too?

Jeremy Corbyn starts by saying he needs to correct the record. Last night he said this was the largest government defeat since the 1920s. In fact, it is the largest defeat in our democratic history.

Michel Barnier, the EU‚Äôs chief negotiator, has said he ‚Äúprofoundly‚Äù regretted the vote by MPs on Tuesday.
After suffering the the biggest government defeat on a meaningful vote for at least a century, which saw 118 Tory MPs rebel against their own party, opponents of the PM‚Äôs Brexit stance insisted Downing Street must now show real movement.
With the UK scheduled to exit the EU in just over 10 weeks‚Äô time on March 29, May has until next Monday to return to the Commons and present a ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù option.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and leading figures from the Brexiteer and pro-Europe wings of the Tory party have said they would back the PM, making it highly unlikely she will lose the vote.
May faces a vote of no confidence this evening, which she is expected to win, in the wake of her Brexit defeat.
... parliamentarians voted for.‚Äù		Leadsom, a leading cabinet Brexiteer, said May would ‚Äúnot necessarily be looking for new ideas that no-one has thought of before‚Äù.		Labour said it was ‚Äúobviously inaccurate‚Äù to claim the party did not have a plan for Brexit.
‚ÄúHe has not put forward any specific constructive proposal and that is a problem, which is why the prime minister will be engaging right across the House with those who do have very sincerely held views but want to constructively deliver on what the vast majority of ...
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she has written him off at all but he needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do,‚Äù she told BBC Radio 4‚Ä≤s Today programme.
But Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, said on Wednesday morning that the Labour leader had to come forward with ideas before he had been invited to talks with the PM.
In the wake of the crushing defeat of her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night, the prime minister pledged to reach out to leading parliamentarians from across the Commons to find a way forward.
Theresa May‚Äôs proposal to hold Brexit deadlock talks with MPs from across the political spectrum has been branded ‚Äúludicrous‚Äù given that Jeremy Corbyn has not yet been invited.
The German Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz said yesterday, ‚ÄúWe are well prepared, but a hard Brexit would be the least attractive choice, for the EU and the UK.‚Äù
Adding, ‚ÄúWe will have to negotiate a transition period with them because the British cannot afford to no longer have planes taking off or landing at home.‚Äù
Juncker added, ‚ÄúThe risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evenings vote.‚Äù		France‚Äôs President Macron said, ‚ÄúThe pressure is mainly on them.‚Äù
Corbyn cast more doubt over Brexit by tabling a vote of no confidence. Perhaps the European Union has similar thoughts as the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker said, ‚ÄúI urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.‚Äù
MPs voted in Parliament by 432 votes to 202 to reject May‚Äôs deal, 118 of the ‚Äòagainst‚Äô votes came from Theresa Mays own Conservative party.
Tusk said in a tweet. ‚ÄúIf a deal is impossible, and no-one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?‚Äù
After the prime ministers defeat last night the European Council President, Donald Tusk  hinted in a tweet that the UK should stay in the EU.
In Berkshire, only Newbury MP Richard Benyon and Reading West MP Alok Sharma supported her.
Mrs May suffered the worst defeat in Parliamentary history as her Brexit deal was rejected by 230 votes.
They were three of 118 rebel Tories who voted against the government on Tuesday, January 15.
Adam Afriyie joined Sir John Redwood and Dr Phillip Lee in voting against the Withdrawal Agreement.
Wokingham and Bracknell's prominent Conservative rebels were joined by their Windsor neighbour in crushing Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal.
"It would be a waste of everyone's time. The better thing to do would be to just deliver it now."
"It would be absolutely crazy of course, because if there were a split and if the members of a new party were to be re-elected, they would probably have to form a coalition with the Conservative Party.
When Nick clarified if he felt that meant the end of the party, he added: "I'm afraid so.
"As I've warned repeatedly since I resigned, an attempt to secure this high-alignment, half-in half-out Brexit using Labour votes would probably lead to a catastrophic split in the Conservative Party."
"I'm a Conservative because I think that the Conservative Party offers the best hope of decent government in this country and prosperity.
Speaking to Nick Ferrari, he said: "This is a very, very serious point.
But Steve Baker said that a soft Brexit would cause permanent divisions within the Conservative Party and it would result in the end of the party.
The Prime Minister told the House of Commons that she would speak with the opposition to try to rescue her Brexit deal.

Mr #DonaldJohnTrump Terrorists can‚Äôt be your partners &amp; allies. Turkey expects the US  to honor our strategic partnership and doesn‚Äôt want it to be shadowed by  terrorist propaganda.
Mr Donald John Trump  It is a fatal mistake to equate Syrian Kurds with the PKK, which is on  the US terrorists list, and its Syria branch PYD/YPG. Turkey fights  against terrorists, not Kurds. We will protect Kurds and other Syrians  against all terrorist threats.
Syria has only just begun to emerge from a devastating conflict that began in 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on demonstrators with unexpected ferocity.
Under the deal, opposition groups in Idlib will remain in areas where they are already present, while Russia and Turkey will conduct joint patrols in the area with a view to preventing renewed fighting.
He added that the Idlib deal reached between Turkey and Russia last September, calling for the ‚Äústabilization‚Äù of Idlib's de-escalation zone, in which acts of aggression are expressly prohibited, has been "successfully" implemented despite difficult conditions.
About Idlib, Syria, Cavusoglu said that if it becomes a "terrorist nest," the Bashar al-Assad regime and the countries that support it are responsible.
"We‚Äôre not against this idea. What is our problem? There is a terror corridor beyond our border. There is a terrorist organization that wants to divide Syria. This terrorist organization poses a threat to us. We are targeting this terrorist organization," he added.
Cavusoglu said Ankara is not opposed to a 30-kilometer safe zone inside Syria near Turkey‚Äôs border.
In its 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK has taken some 40,000 lives. The YPG/PYD is its Syrian branch.
Turkish officials attacked the U.S. conflation of "Kurds" with the terror group, saying a forthcoming Turkish operation in Syria targets a terrorist group which threatens Arabs, Turkmens, and Kurds alike in Syria.
Following the surprise announcement in December that U.S. forces would leave Syria, U.S. officials said withdrawal was conditional on the U.S. not attacking the "Kurds," meaning the terrorist PKK/YPG.
Cavusoglu said Turkey is not the enemy of the Kurdish people, adding that Kurds should not be equated with terrorist organizations. 		He added there is serious pressure on Trump not to withdraw from Syria.
"[The US] Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds," Trump tweeted on Sunday, conflating ‚ÄúKurds‚Äù with the terrorist PKK/YPG, a confusion that Turkey has repeatedly criticized.
"Strategic partners" should not communicate through social media, Cavusoglu added, in clear reference to the perennially tweeting U.S. leader.
Cavusoglu's remarks came in response to Trump's threat to attack Turkey's economy if Ankara hits the terror group PKK/YPG during the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.
@AmbJohnBolton @SecPompeo 		"We have repeatedly said that we are never afraid of threats. Threatening Turkey economically will get you nowhere," Cavusoglu told a news conference with his Luxembourg counterpart Jean Asselborn in the Turkish capital Ankara.
