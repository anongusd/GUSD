"My life changed after I started independent living. Muchu Center made me empowered, and proud of myself, including my disability, made me able to raise my voice and especially, made it O.K to feel angry if I am not in the right situation." - Noah Ohashi
"The Muchu Center helped me in moving out from the institution, helped me to find accessible housing, asked me to work there.
"I didn‚Äôt have any money, clothes, nor cell phone, just his address that I remembered; it was my light. That was the Center for Independent Living in Osaka, ‚ÄúMuchu‚Äù Center.
"Just run away to the south side [of Japan] because I met one person from south side before and he told me that in south side have center called ‚ÄúCenter for Independent Living,‚Äù and that place will help me if I escape from the institution.
"In 2011, north Japan had huge earthquake. The time that earthquake happened, I was in first floor. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening, but I felt, ‚Äúthis is the moment if I want to escape from this situation, I should.‚Äù I just run away from there and hop on the train.
"I was in the long-term hospital for a year, after that I was in the institution for over 3 years. If you describe that time in one sentence: ‚ÄúIt is hell.‚Äù I had been physically, sexually, mentally abused in there every day. It made me small and powerless.
"That‚Äôs how Ed‚Äôs independent living philosophy had strong impact to Japanese disabled community. However, the first CIL was not good enough to make all disabled people in the institution to live in community. Especially in the countryside where I used to live, north Japan.
"Why is Ed Robert important to me? For me, it‚Äôs because he started Centers for Independent Living. It‚Äôs because of CILs that I am who I am now. That‚Äôs how important of a person he is for me. He even influenced a Japanese disabled man to start a CIL in Japan.
And to finish up our commemoration of #EdRobertsDay, we have a final story from another of our Volunteer Leaders. Check out the thread to hear from Noah, who found empowerment at a CIL in Japan. 	TW: Sexual assault, abuse
#EdRobertsDay: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt until Access Living that I learned about Ed and how he paved the way for disabled activists like myself. It motivated me to be more active as a disabled activist &amp; as a leader. We've made great strides, but the fight isn't over; we must press forward."
"Ed Roberts is the father of the independent living movement, but we are his legacy. We will continue his work and strive to do even better. If he was alive today I bet he'd be amazed. I am proud to be a part of the independent living movement." - Jesus Campuzano #EdRobertsDay

In observance of the National Day of Mourning today, Access Living would like to share an Anti-Filicide Toolkit from our friends at @autselfadvocacy https://t.co/i5RYSEHtzP
Gender disparities exist in education. While overall literacy rate for persons w disabilities is 3 percent, @UNESCO estimates it is just 1 percent for women &amp; girls w disabilities. @WomensHistMonth
Unemployment rates are highest among women w disabilities. @UN estimates 75% of women w disabilities are unemployed &amp; women w disabilities who are employed often earn less than their male counterparts and women wo disabilities. @WomensHistMonth
Women &amp; girls w disabilities are subjected to multiple layers of discrimination. This inequality is exacerbated for women &amp; girls w disabilities who are members of marginalized ethnic or racial groups or LGBTQIA community. @WomensHistMonth
2018 Honorees for @WomensHistMonth include a LOT of women who fought for disability justice. @Lindaschwartzz @ArleneMayerson &amp; @JillMossGreenberg. #NeverthelessShePersisted https://t.co/xvHc6is4ie

This bill blames people w disabilities for public failure to comply w ADA. Why should people w disabilities pay for no access, where we cannot live like everyone else? The blame belongs to business owners who delayed for 27+ years &amp; did nothing to comply w ADA. #HandsOffMyADA

Concerns about serial litigants are also behind this bill. However, courts already have the power to deal with frivolous litigants and their attorneys. #HandsOffMyADA
Accessibility standards, such as those the ADA includes, are extremely important. They are not minor details, but rather, are essential to ensure true accessibility. #HandsOffMyADA
Concerns about money damage awards are behind this bill. That has nothing to do with ADA, because ADA does not allow money damages.  Such damages are only available under a handful of state laws. This bill will do nothing to prevent damage awards under state laws. #HandsOffMyADA
HR 620 calls for education by the Department of Justice. But there are already extensive efforts, including by DOJ and the ADA Centers, to educate business owners about their ADA obligations. Businesses that violate the ADA should be held accountable. #HandsOffMyADA
HR 620 requires a person w disability to give businesses w barriers to access written notice &amp; 60 days to acknowledge a problem‚Äî&amp; then another 120 days to begin to fix it. No other civil rights group is forced to wait 180 days to enforce their civil rights. #HandsOffMyADA
The ADA is carefully crafted to take needs of business owners into account. Compliance is not exorbitantly expensive. This bill would remove any reason for businesses to comply. Instead, they can ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù &amp; do nothing until they happen to be sued. #HandsOfMyADA
When business owners have resisted the ADA for over 27 years, sometimes a lawsuit is the only way to make the ADA‚Äôs promise of equal participation real. Even so, if you examine the court records, there really are very few ADA cases. #HandsOffMyADA
#AccessChicago2018 https://t.co/sgugBL1f50 Come to the @AccessLiving booth for fun info and powerful advocacy!
For example, why should a wheelchair user be unable to join her family at a restaurant, just because the owner has resisted installing a ramp for the past 27 years? Such things happen to many people with disabilities every day. #HandsOffMyADA
The bill‚Äôs proponents have forgotten everyday experiences of millions of ordinary people with disabilities who cannot shop, enjoy recreation, or transact personal business like most Americans take for granted. #HandsOffMyADA

#NoOn620 No other civil right requires notice &amp; cure period before right to be free from discrimination must be respected. This problem only affects disabled people. HR 620 proposes a drastic departure from how our govt protects individual civil rights. https://t.co/1SexV8MQ2i
#NoOn620 @AccessLiving's view is the burden should be on the disreputable lawyers threatening suit without increasing accessibility. State bar associations can discipline lawyers for such behavior. Business owners should take their complaints there. https://t.co/1SexV8MQ2i
HR 620 takes business obligation for architectural access unless owner gets specific notice required in this bill. After notice, owner still gets 180 days to make improvements. This is despite fact business have had 27+ years to comply w/ ADA. https://t.co/1SexV8MQ2i
In 2016, only 47 lawsuits were filed in IL re architectural barriers, like all but 2 states. FL &amp; CA laws provide $$ damages when a business is inaccessible. Only in FL &amp; CA is there much litigation &amp; that litigation is driven by state law, not the ADA. https://t.co/1SexV8MQ2i
People who support HR 620 say attorneys &amp; plaintiffs engage in "drive-by" ADA litigation to get money. "Drive-by" ADA litigation is never connected to actual increase in accessibility. It only gets the business to pay $$$ in exchange for not being sued. https://t.co/1SexV8MQ2i

https://t.co/1SexV8MQ2i HR 620 would limit rights of people with disabilities as enacted in the ADA. HR 620 requires a particular written notice and a 180-days waiting period before anyone can file a complaint for a business's failure to make itself architecturally accessible.

People w/ disabilities are often people most in need of quality health insurance, especially long term services &amp; supports, which is only provided through Medicaid. What is your vision for healthcare in Illinois, with a view toward the need of people w/ all kinds of disabilities?
Despite protections of ADA, unemployment rate of people with disabilities continues to be much higher than general public.  What efforts would you take to address this, and would you support legislation and sign it to eliminate the subminimum wage in Illinois? Why or why not?
How would you ensure adequate revenue to fund these investments? Question at the IL Governors Forum at @AccessLiving
How would you invest in the disability supports workforce, long-term care supports and services, workforce development, and housing to expand opportunities and resources for self-directed community-based living?

Proposals to cut benefits or shift higher health care costs to older adults and people with disabilities could also be used to pay for tax cuts, such as turning Medicare into a voucher program, raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67, or increasing cost-sharing
TCJA increases deficit by $1.5 trillion, &amp; budget plan would cut $1 trillion from Medicaid &amp; $470 billion from Medicare. Medicaid per-capita caps or block grants could be instituted, requiring states to increase taxes or cut needed care, like nursing home services &amp; home care.
Tax reform could end ability to deduct state/local income &amp; sales taxes from fed taxable income. Removing deduction harder for states to raise $, squeezing budgets that pay for Medicaid, education, transportation, &amp; other services for seniors, people w/ disabilities, &amp; families.
TCJA eliminates municipal bonds and associated tax relief that makes it possible to build non-profit hospitals, low-income housing, and public education facilities that older adults, people with disabilities, and their families rely on.
TCJA eliminates New Markets Tax Credit Program, which provides incentives to businesses deciding to establish themselves in low-income &amp; distressed communities. This credit has supported 5,000+ businesses nationwide, including hospitals and other health care facilities.
If older Americans &amp; individuals w/ disabilities can't deduct their medical expenses, many will need to draw down resources from tax-deferred accounts. Distribution from this  account is considered income. More income reported = more Social Security benefit could be taxed.
Proposals indirectly reduce tax incentives for charitable giving could limit  critical services &amp; supports for older adults &amp; people w/ disabilities. Many receive services from community-based orgs, including transportation, adult day &amp; nutrition programs, &amp; information services
TCJA would eliminate small business tax credit making business 	accessible to employees w/ disabilities, seniors, &amp; customers w/ disabilities. Businesses w/ revenues &gt; $1 million a year or &gt; 30 employees, a tax credit up to $5,000 is available for renovations &amp; adaptations
TCJA ends orphan drug tax credit, decreasing likelihood pharmacy companies would invest in research of rare diseases &amp; conditions. Senate tax proposal cuts it 1/2. Older Americans &amp; people w/ disabilities likely to be among over 30 million Americans with rare disease or condition
TCJA would eliminate Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides businesses w/ federal tax credit for hiring people w/ disabilities, as well as others, including unemployed veterans. Current tax credit for hiring a person w/ a disability can be as high as $2,400 for a business.
Taking medical deductions from personal income taxes would hurt seniors w/ greater medical needs, people w/ disabilities &amp; chronic medical conditions &amp; families w/ children who have congenital/genetic disorders &amp; disabilities. @ 8.8 million homes claimed medical deduction in 2015
