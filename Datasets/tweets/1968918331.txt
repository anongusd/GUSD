@jljacobson Every member gets to vote on the rules, and there's always a discussion about the rules within the majority before the package is taken up.  This negotiation is part of that democratic process--not a hostage-taking.
@neeratanden By the way, the Probkem Solvers didn't come into being as a House caucus until Janurary 25, 2017--after Ryan had been reelected Speaker.  There was no opportunity for the caucus to bargain with him, or anyone else.
@neeratanden Ryan announced his resignation in April.  The Problem Solvers didn't agree on their reforms until July.  If the Republicans had kept their majority, the demands on their speaker-designate would have been exactly the same.  This is not a plot to derail Pelosi.
@JamesFallows Jim: The Problem Solvers are a relatively new House caucus, and it wasn't until the current leadership bottled up their proposals in 2017 that they understood the need for rules reform.  They spent months working on their package, which they made public in July.
@neeratanden They spent 2017 developing bipartisan proposals (including the blueprint for Alexander-Murray) that Ryan bottled up.  That’s when they first understood the need for rules reforms and started working on them.
@DeanBaker13 The Problem Solvers worked for months to craft rules reforms that would give more power to rank and file members to legislate, which the House used to do.  Rather than imputing malign motives to their authors, these reforms should be considered on their merits.
@JoyAnnReid They were just getting started when Boehner resigned.  They’re not part of the NeverNancy caucus.  They’ll support her, if she supports rules reforms.
@JoyAnnReid The Problem Solvers didn’t exist in 2006, the last time Democrat’s were poised to take control of the House, or in 2010, when the Republicans were.
@paulkrugman The Democrats in the Problem Solvers are not part of the NeverNancy coalition.  They will gladly support her, if she endorses some House rules reforms that have been discussed publicly for months.  She has been meeting with them about this.
@paulkrugman For the record: The Democrats in the Problem Solvers are not part of the NeverNancy coalition.  They will gladly support her--if she endorses some  reforms of the House rules that have been in the public domain for months.  She has been meeting with them about this.
In view of recent unjustified attacks on Democrats in the bipartisan Problem Solvers caucus in the House, let's set the record straight: these Democrats  are NOT opposed to Nancy Pelosi's election as Speaker--if she supports rules reforms to make the House work once again.

RT @WSJ: Opinion: The excesses of globalization are real, but trade wars aren’t the answer, writes @BillGalston https://t.co/UiQcbpeGYv
This does NOT mean indifference to human beings who happen not to be Americans. Their interests have moral weight, and they should matter to Americans and the U.S. government. America First is immoral if it means America only.
But there is a middle ground: responsible nationalism. National governments are not required to value the citizens of other countries as highly as their own. National leaders are not obligated to lift up the global poor at the expense of their working and middle classes.
In failing to respond to the weakened postwar social contract between American employers and their workers, we're now living at a time when unmodulated internationalism is breeding an increasingly unbridled nationalism.
We can't say we weren't warned. More than two decades ago, @rodrikdani argued that globalization would drive a wedge between workers who had the skills and mobility to prosper in the global economy and those who did not.
Although Trump’s most recent trade actions are misguided, Democrats and Republicans have long ignored the economic distortions caused by globalization. https://t.co/tPWhS2LnZ4
