@adriandt31 @TruckerBobS @POTUS That's my big question. Who's behind all of this? Bet we can guess. There's no wars going on in those countries. I'd question a bunch of these caravanners and find out why and how they got there. Follow the money!

Here's part of the swamp I didn't know about. How about some investigative reporting on this? Thanks for sharing. https://t.co/a3izP76oAa
Agreed!! Along with any journalist showing such disrespect. Tough questions, of course, but not in rude attacks. https://t.co/gblb9eXM0X
@BetancourtNy @foxandfriends Good journalism is supposed to be respectful and factual not negative propaganda as is displayed too often.
@omegabalf @foxandfriends I think we the people should have that award/trophy made with the number inscribed who agree with it.
@AHeathensDay @foxandfriends So wrong, the POTUS answered the question and Acosta continued to badger disrespectfully. I would have kicked him out, too! Does anyone like being badgered or is that the new norm of the press? Show some respect!
@foxandfriends Good! I would too! Who wouldn't? If you only attack, you show off with no respect for the office of the POTUS?
Good! You respect the office of the President of the United States even if you don't like the man! The problem with the press is they have no respect or legitimacy only hatefulness. Sad. https://t.co/3yiJoedVjZ
It would be real interesting if all those knuckleheads in Washington would try always telling the truth, but, 1- their heads might explode, 2- they'll figure there's nothing to gain from it. The truth must really be bad. https://t.co/mnZhpAFI9M
