I am honored to announce the endorsement of Lt. Colonel Jeffrey Addicott, USA, Ret. He is the world's foremost expert on terrorism law, a great patriot and a great American. I look forward to having him as a close advisor while I serve in Congress. #TX21 https://t.co/C0HmGJdEYd

I fully support @POTUS withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement, a travesty of a deal by the Obama administration. We must insist on a denuclearized Iran for our sake and for the sake of our ally Israel. #TX21 https://t.co/4efkRe7TZW
My opponent dismisses me when I say I want to be on the "Hell-raising" committee in Congress. Constituents in #TX21 should be worried that he's deriding me for saying that instead of trying to copy me #hellraiser #fiscalorder #debtmatters #MAGA
Anyone remember when we were on our way into a new ice age? Then it was #globalwarming. Now it's #climatechange so no one can ever be wrong! But it all has one thing in common--socialism and government control. #showmethedata #TX21
We must end the burdens placed by the federal government on the development of our natural resources #TexasFirst #TX21
Let's get Congress on track! If Republicans lose the majority in November, it will be because the Republicans failed to do what they said they were going to do. Repeal Obamacare. Defund Planned Parenthood. Cut spending. Pass normal budgets, not continuing resolutions. #TX21 #MAGA
Republicans need to act like the majority party. #RepealObamacare #defundPlannedParenthood. It's what they were elected on. #TX21
Congress needs businesspeople who know how to negotiate! The soundest philosophy in the world doesn't matter if you don't know how to get results. I want to take my skills as a businessman and get results for our values in #TX21 #MAGA
The results in North Korea are a direct results of @realDonaldTrump negotiation. We need to take that same skill set to Congress to get results for Life, defunding Planned Parenthood, cutting spending, expanding our #2A rights. We can do it. Congress just needs a #spine #TX21
I am tired of Republicans acting like they've lost when they're in the majority. #TX21 #timeforaspine #MAGA
I believe in term limits, and I have promised to limit myself to 3 terms in the House--6 years--if elected to #TX21. Those in office should personally honor the convictions they advocate
The art of #negotiation is the art of communication. You have to know your friends, opponents, people with similar interests and people with competing interests. It is a lost art in US Congress. That is what I want to bring to Congress to serve this district and our state #TX21
I will join the #FreedomCaucus when elected to Congress. #TX21
The art of business is forming agreements with people you can find mutual interests with, codify them in contracts, and produce results. That is what I will do in Congress for our #conservative values, for Texas, and for America #TX21

We must fix the VA. Our Veterans deserve the best care, but they are not getting it. This may mean structural reform of the VA, buying our veterans insurance, or funding. But those who have served deserve our best efforts from Congress, and they're not getting it #TX21
In Congress, my priority will be to fully fund our military, enact sound foreign policy for clear mission objectives, and end mission creep. Our men and women in the military deserve clear goals #TX21 #MAGA
North and South Korea are coming to an agreement-- a direct result of @realDonaldTrump negotiation--allowing the media to portray this as a South Korean victory, because that's the only way it will work. President Trump is a much bigger man than the #media gives him credit for
This is a direct result of President Trump's strong negotiation. 	We've seen the results a businessman outsider's perspective can bring to government. Now we need to bring that to Congress and get results for our values in #TX21. https://t.co/XgEDu1V5mF

India was the prize of the cold war. Where else will you find a billion people, 300 million of whom speak English and live under British common law, to balance China? Now that we've ended aid to Pakistan, we should fully embrace India as our partner in the region #TX21 #MAGA

Start with a blank sheet of paper and zero-out our #foreignaid. I stand with @realDonaldTrump  in cutting aid to Pakistan. We must #StandWithIsrael and our allies in Europe and the Eastern Bloc and end the foreign aid to bottomless pits #TX21
We can see the results @realDonaldTrump is getting with North Korea through #negotiation. It means acting with strength and strategy and being willing to say "No."  No to China. No to bad trade deals. No to political correctness. #TX21 #MAGA
Small banks lend to small business. 80% of jobs are created by small businesses. We must recapitalize our small businesses by eliminating burdensome regulation on our small banks #TX21
The only way out of our massive #debt is to radically grow the economy. If China and India can grow at 8% America can too. All that's required is a vision and a Congress with the backbone to implement it #growtheeconomy #TX21 #MAGA
I've heard my Democrat opponents across the isle for #TX21 speak over and over about all the projects they want to fund. We have $21 TRILLION in cash debt and $200 TRILLION in unfunded mandates. We cannot afford tinkerers or fiscal liberals in Congress. #getdowntobusiness
Congress needs more businessmen and businesswomen who understand the art of #negotiation. It's what @realDonaldTrump brings to the table and what I will bring to a Congress that just can't stop spending our children's money #TX21
I beg to differ with President Macron in his speech to the US Congress. Nationalism is not the same thing as isolationism and withdrawal. And no one is suggesting "closing the door to the world." Maybe France would like to match us in foreign aid?
