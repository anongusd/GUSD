@RealSaavedra There are lots of Trump supporters in Chicago, despite the mayor suggesting they are a "Trump Free Zone!!!". But just because there was a racially charged hate crime, doesn't mean that it was some MAGA man. Not surprising that the left acts like they know exactly who it is.

As much as the MSM attacks Trump, there might not be a congressman who gets more unfair criticism than @SteveKingIA. The guy keeps getting called a neo-nazi, white supremacist and other things by the left, w/o any evidence of him being connected to hate groups like the KKK.

@Treasur86279282 @dakota295752 @LMernando @RealCandaceO I never said he voted Repub, but you keep falsely claiming that he was a leftist. He may have had socialist beliefs, but this was the 1960's, so don't assume that he was a leftist.
@Treasur86279282 @dakota295752 @LMernando @RealCandaceO Lol, you're just convincing yourself that this is misinformation. You don't care about facts, you only believe what you want to believe. You keep telling me "facts" w/o any legit evidence. And you keep twisting stories into something they're not.
@Treasur86279282 @dakota295752 @LMernando @RealCandaceO Where's your evidence that this is propaganda? The left loves to make up facts so that they can cover up their ugly past and get votes. You probably don't have a logical answer to this: What the hell have democrats done to help African Americans?
@Treasur86279282 @dakota295752 @LMernando @RealCandaceO https://t.co/ftr9yqTv72
@Treasur86279282 @dakota295752 @LMernando @RealCandaceO LOL, you're totally twisting the story. He did not say that he was voting democratic or republican, he said that he wanted his people to be independent voters and to think for themselves. Here's a video of MLK proving that he leaned towards the right. https://t.co/M0q0pXdPcC
@Treasur86279282 @dakota295752 @LMernando @RealCandaceO MLK was NOT a democrat. He might never have had an official party affiliation, but his father was a Republican senator, and MLK's beliefs lean towards the right. KKK (an alt-right group), has more affiliation dems than republicans. Alt-right is not conservatism!
I support @PeterRoskam for reelection in Illinois 6th district. Casten is highly corrupt and uses the same language that hate groups like the KKK, Antifa etc. use. Vote Roskam, and lets continue the mission to Make Illinois Red Again!
@dailyherald @SeanCasten @PeterRoskam Casten has used language that neo-nazis and other hate groups use. Casten is such an extremist. Vote for @PeterRoskam!
Even as a conservative republican, it feels like Democrats are gonna take over Illinois in historic fashion. It feels like Illinois is poised to elect more democrats than ever before. Don't fall for democratic trap, vote Republican!

At this point, there is no justification for @FoxNews keeping @ShepNewsTeam. He continues to either make up stories or twist a story into somethings that it's not in order to find a way to jab at @realDonaldTrump. No wonder radical leftists LOVE him!

Dear Massachusettians, I think your senate vote should be easy! A vote for Geoff Diehl is pro-America! Don't vote Fauxcahontas 1/1024 (she's whiter than most Americans). Diehl gets my support 100%, so get out and flip Massachusetts to RED!

@MAYHEM_Bandit @SInow @AlbertBreer Bears got totally fleeced in the trade. Khalil Mack can have 25 sacks this year, and the Bears will still have the worst record in the NFC. That means the Bears gave the Raiders 2 top 5 picks in 2019 and 20. The Bears will not be competitive any time soon!

@TheJeffSchlegel He won't be the WR1 or WR2 to start the season. Kevin White has already been slated to start, and there is no chance Miller starts until White inevitably tears both acls and shatters his shoulder blade simultaneously. Even in that case, I think they'd choose Bellamy over Miller.

@TheBearsWire  https://t.co/XFhzD9enwS
@AaronLemingNFL I personally think that we had one of the most overrated offseasons this year. I believe Robinson will be on IR, Burton and Gabriel will be non-factors. I'm too concerned about Roquan and the defense. We'll have too many injuries again, and we'll be 3-13 but I hope I'm wrong.
@AaronLemingNFL I'm sorry Aaron, but I think you're working yourself up over nothing. A lot of the guys they'll play tomorrow won't make the team. Plus we are only going to win 3 or 4 games this year. I wouldn't realistically get this hyped until 2020, which is when the playoff window opens.
@AaronLemingNFL And I would assume Tyler Bray will start.

@KobeyLofton I personally think this is a waste of time. Thousand of Chicagoans take the Dan Ryan to get to work and home. There are better alternatives than blocking a major road.

NBA ALERT: After signing Lebron, the Lakers are reportedly finalizing a trade with the Spurs that would send Lonzo, Kuzma and future picks to SA in exchange for Kawhi Leonard. Will have more details later.
BREAKING NEWS: LeBron is officially heading to LA. Deal is reportedly for 4 years/$154 mil.
@NickFriedell The Bulls won't match any offers that are more than $60 MIL because the Bulls are cheap and LaVine is not even worth $10 MIL in my opinion!
@ZachLaVine @NickFriedell Come on bro, you should know deep down inside that you are not worth that big of an investment!
@Blackhawk_Up In fact, Toews and Kane will both be gone after the season! Trading Toews and Kane is the ONLY way in hell to be able to terminate the bad contracts of Seabrook and Keith. The long-term rebuild is pretty much underway!
@MitchellWinkelm Honestly, all three guys never had a prime, so it appears the Hawks will settle for status quo. Depending on how they start, they will eventually either go all-in on trying to win the cup or they will tank and begin a 5-10 year rebuild.
@Blackhawk_Up Hawks will be 28-44-10 this season! #facts
@Blackhawk_Up Leafs will win 7-0

BREAKING NEWS: Not long after opting out of his contract, Lebron has told multiple sources and people that he is close to that he intends to sign with the Lakers. Lakers are also looking to clear some cap to also get Kawhi and KD if possible. But Lebron will be a Laker.
@JBPritzker @DanielBiss I've always been republican. But if there was one liberal that I actually didn't hate, it was Biss. But now i've lost all respect for Biss. I wish Jeanne Ives would have beat Rauner!

@UCF_Football Damn I thought that that was OBJ for a minute
@king3JBM @UCF_Football it's how the national champion wanna-be's celebrate
@DJSeanHaley I can pretty much guarantee you that more than half of their picks will be from very small schools.
@AllProNation @jacobinfante24 @BearsPodcast As much as I don't want Edmunds at 8, multiple sources have said that the #Bears have told Edmunds that they will draft him at 8. It's a done deal. I think passing up on Smith will haunt them.
@AllProNation @jacobinfante24 @BearsPodcast He might have a high ceiling, but he also has perhaps the lowest floor of any prospect in this draft. Plus he's not quite the leader Roquan Smith is. Smith is a leader on and off the field, which should be a trait the Bears covet. Much safer pick than Edmunds.
@AllProNation @jacobinfante24 @BearsPodcast Why is everyone so high on Edmunds?
@ucf_problems @AlabamaFTBL The real national champs vs national champ wanna-be. Advantage goes to the real national champs! #WeWillCrushUCF #RollTide
@TheJeffSchlegel Are the Bears even going to draft a WR at all?
@TheJeffSchlegel @sammiebee20 Shouldn't they teach these guys to not be racist before they even get the job?
@ChicagoBears @SIRIUSXM I'm sorry, but the Bears will be no better than 4-12 this year. This team will have to have historically good drafts for each of the next 3-4 years if they even want to be close to being .500 at any point in the next 3-4 seasons. #facts #ItsTheTruth #justsayin
@ChicagoBears @SIRIUSXM It's time for me to shut down the delusional Bears fans! Bears fans need to pay close attention to what I'm gonna say. The Bears are almost certainly going to have one of the worst offenses in the league and the defense will regress badly. This team doesn't have a bright future!
@TurboNeoGeo @thekapman @ESPN1000 @ChicagoBears Agreed! Our offense is going to be one of the worst in the NFL, and our defense will regress mightily.
@KevinDGoodwin @scottbrownell34 @DavidHaugh @thekapman @ChicagoBears I don't think they're in as much trouble as you think

@TheMustardTig3r @TRUTHbisky @DezBryant @ChicagoBears Stay off the weed
@ErikLambert1 IMO, I think the Bears are kind of the Rams from 1-2 years ago today. After the Rams had their breakout season, they were able to bring in some big personalities (similar to Dez). The Bears can bring in big personalities when they start winning, which is why signing Dez is a nogo
@ErikLambert1 Don't worry about it Erik! Dez is going to join a team that has had success recently (probably signs with Rams)
@theotherdeefish Not really worth signing a guy who is well past his prime. It would make more sense if the Bears were already contending, but they are not contenders for at least another 3 years.
@charlespattersn @CHIBears247 Sutton's trash. I'd rather go with a guy like Ridley, Gallup, Moore or Kirk.
