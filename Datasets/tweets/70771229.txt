@stevevuoso That’s how upset I was...she thought I was about to confess to murder.
@mattackland_dc 👍🏽👍🏽😘
My Mom grabs my hands and says:	“Sweetheart, it’s ok. I am so sorry you’ve carried this burden alone for so long. It’s going to be ok.” I was floored. My Mom hugs me “So what, you’re still YOU!” 	I know I was lucky. Many LGBTQ kids get rejected by loved ones. Let’s erase stigma!
I was so upset. I couldn’t do it. My Mom says...	“Sweetheart, let me guess?” 	I nod and my Mom says:	“You’ve killed someone?”	“No” I reply.	“You’ve gotten someone pregnant?”	“No.”	“You’re Gay?”	I nod my head and say “Yes.” Tears are pouring down my face...
Today #NationalComingOutDay Our personal stories help lessen stigma &amp; shame...	I came-out to my family in October of 1999. It was my birthday gift to myself. I was 27. My plan was to tell my Mom first. We sat at the kitchen table and as I tried to say “I’m Gay.” I started crying.
