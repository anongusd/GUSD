10 (last one) / #Woodward notes after he said similar on @FoxNewsSunday Jan 15 2017 @realDonaldTrump tweeted re #dossier ‚Äî ‚ÄúThank you to Bob Woodward who said, ‚ÄòThat is a garbage document ... it never should have been presented‚Äù (same Woodward WH now trying to discredit)
9/ #Woodward writes ‚Äú..as if I had reported &amp; written one of the most serious, complex stories for WashPost that I had ever done ‚Äî and then provided an appendix of unverified allegations. Oh, by the way, here is a to-do list for further reporting and we‚Äôre publishing it‚Äù @comey
8/ #Woodward ‚Äî ‚Äú..dossier is the sort of stuff that a reporter or the FBI might more than reasonably follow up on.. But including it, even in scaled-down form, in one of the most important briefings the intel chiefs might ever present to a president-elect made little sense to me‚Äù
7/ #Woodward ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey wanted the formal assessment to be believed by the president-elect. Why pollute it w the dossier summary? They knew enough about Trump to know it would rile him up .. would have riled anyone up. Why would they accompany their most serious work‚Äù w dossier
6/ #Woodward credits intel chiefs for important report on meddling but goes in on @Comey again: ‚ÄúAnd then, almost as an afterthought, Comey had introduced the dossier as if to say, btw, here is this scurrilous, unverified, unsupported footnote w some of the ugliest allegations‚Äù
5/ Then interestingly #Woodward takes @Comey to task for adding sellacious #dossier material to Jan 6 brief: ‚ÄúI was surprised, not at the allegations, which might be true, but that the intelligence chiefs, particularly the FBI director, would present any of this to Trump.‚Äù
4/ #WoodwardBook adds new nugget: ‚ÄúThis has also not been previously reported: The CIA believed they had at least six human sources supporting this finding [on meddling]. One person w access to the full top secret report later told me he believed that only two were solid‚Äù
3/ #WoodwardBook adds of #clapper brief Trump Tower Jan62017: Trump ‚Äúa ‚Äòclear preference‚Äô [of Russia] &amp; the effort was aimed very much at ‚Äòdiscrediting‚Äô &amp; ‚Äòundermining‚Äô Clinton. There was no suggestion that Trump or his associates had colluded or coordinated w the Russian effort‚Äù
2/ #WoodwardBook adds despite dossier being potentially suspect @JohnBrennan ‚Äúsaid the information was in line with their own sources [at CIA], in which he had great confidence‚Äù
1/ re #WoodwardBook if WH reads they‚Äôll see #Woodward actually raises sharp Q‚Äôs about #dossier ‚Äî reports ‚Äúthe sources that Steele used for his dossier had not been polygraphed, which made their information uncorroborated, and potentially suspect‚Äù
