Exposure of 2.1 micrograms of EtO per cubic meter of air could trigger more than 6 cases of cancer for every 1,000 people exposed. Federal regulators generally target polluters when local cancer risks are greater than 100 in a million!! Yet NOTHING by @EPA!
Recent results from EPA monitoring of #Sterigenics were more than 20% higher than alarmingly high levels discovered in December. The highest concentration was found Jan. 15 at a nearby EPA warehouse where EtO levels were 14.3 micrograms per cubic meter.
Recent results show levels of ethylene oxide were the highest readings since the federal government began testing.	https://t.co/3yiBK8C9sd - @_TonyBriscoe

This cloud flows around objects, into cavities &amp; structures. May penetrate small openings in buildings, bunkers and engine bays of armoured vehicles, before being ignited. - Thennobaric munitions using ethylene oxide. @StopSterigenics  https://t.co/U2e6mR4pQU
Thennobaric munitions work by initially dispersing an aerosol cloud of gas, liquid or finely powdered explosive. Known fuels such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide 1, ammonium nitrate2, and powdered PETN4 have been reported.
"Thermobaric munitions are those munitions that, by design, produce more heat and  overpressure than conventional explosives by exploding a vapour in the blast zone." - using chemicals such as ethylene oxide.
"One should not forget the burning effects of the explosion either, as it consumes all oxygen in the area and the resultant vacuum pulls loose objects into this void." - explosion of ethylene oxide.
"If the explosive does not detonate, the affected area can be highly toxic...ethylene oxide...is extremely toxic if inhaled. This may lead to accusations of the use of chemical warfare if this situation were to occur." @StopSterigenics	https://t.co/lmScllJL2F https://t.co/6ObGFZNAb9

The highest levels of EtO ranged from 10.5 micrograms at Village Hall to 0.566 at the high school.  2.1 could trigger + 6 cases of cancer for every 1,000 people. Fed regulators target polluters when local cancer risks are greater than 100 in 1M!!

@CookRecord @NLVZ1314 @EPA @Sterigenics1 And there are FDA approved alternatives. How much do they pay you to post this stuff? Alot given that you only post industry view point.
@CookRecord Maybe you can actually write your news from actual evidence. Here is a suggestion. Have Sterigenics send you the data from their "statewide" testing. Because they won't. Because THAT is flawed.
@CookRecord @NLVZ1314 @EPA @Sterigenics1 Can't get more factual then hearing from their own mouths. Sorry but you are wrong. Get your facts right, then report on it.
