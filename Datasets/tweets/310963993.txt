This was an impressive showing by @AOC. Republicans better take her seriously. I suspect she is gonna be around for the long haul. https://t.co/0qF66UBGwg
This tweet aged well. Washington is a cesspool of Filth. Lies, backstabbing and grandstanding all in a bid to gain little advantage. Whatever happened to loyalty. https://t.co/TCfDaaYkmt
@CNNPolitics All these new entrants in Congress should be very careful. They are polarizing the country instead of uniting. They speak without circumspection and thoughtfulness. Law making is serious business and maybe those who elect these people can do better by giving us more solid people.

RT @PastorDScott: Here’s Cohen IN CHURCH stating that the President is not a racist! https://t.co/BLcwIoC4jr
RT @PastorDScott: https://t.co/wEagtvNwDH
@mkraju He is not proceeding any cautiously, he's got nothing. The entire hearing is a show of shame intended to disparage the president. Cohen lacks credibility so fair-minded people don't really care about what he has to say. At the end of the day it was dog and pony show.
@ChristianPost @ubmike For the fact they voted for it means the church had been on a downward spiral. Who legislates over a known incontrovertible truth of the word of God?

@BishopPMorton He says and does things that make me cringe but beyond that he has a genuine desire to change things for good. He has made some mistakes but has also accomplished a lot of good things for this country. Let's be fair to him and continue to pray for God's wisdom for him.
@BishopPMorton In the place of prayer, I found out that God had rejected Hillary Clinton. Everything was in her favor but God. So she lost. I kept asking why would God supervise her defeat? Until Trump won I never knew the rot was that bad.Trump is filled with a lot of flaws and imperfections
@BishopPMorton What's going on and the role the church has to play. Throwing banters on social media makes the church a laughing stock. Ministers of the Gospel must rise above partisan or racial prejudices and seek the truth of God's word and faithfully communicate those truths to our subjects.
@BishopPMorton America is now more divided than ever, to think is because of Trump is equally naive and outright wrong.There are enough blames to go around. Satan has unleased his greatest arsenal on a strategically important nation of the world.We must look beyond the physical to figure out
@BishopPMorton To that extent, Ministers of the Gospel who should provide leadership should act with some circumspection and tarry with the Holy Spirit to understand what's going on.Hating on Trump is absolutely uncalled for and immature.The battle is way bigger than him and his administration.
@BishopPMorton Is he disrupting a Satanic agenda? A lot of discernment is needed to figure out what the enemy is doing. It's not the time for race baiting and foolish talk. The battle for the soul of this nation is so real. To think it is about Trump is the height of Spiritual naivety.
@BishopPMorton Look at the corruption in the media. The enemy has practically hijacked the entire liberal media. Journalists who should be impartial are now political activists holding water for the corrupt Democratic party. Where is the outcry? They were mad Trump won and why is that?
@BishopPMorton Look at how many young people that are embracing socialism today. Under Obama, the church was going through a lot. Social issues that are manifestly destructive were promoted, every false way emboldened. I didn't see outcry even when God's heart were grieved over the happenings.
@RevJohnHMoore1 @mleblanc1016 @BishopPMorton One of the greatest tragedies of today's church is that even ministers of the gospel  do not know what God is doing. Trump is not the problem. He is a divine repudiation of the problem. He is a tool for judgement and restoration. The system was too rotten before he showed up.

@alltejuupptaget @MSNBC He has nothing to clear. The investigation was started on a false premise. It's a phony investigation and should be discontinued. America is not old Soviet Union where you manufacture Crime to silence an opponent. It's a witch-hunt. Period!!!
@alltejuupptaget @MSNBC There is no basis for an interview. The investigation was started based on a false premise. The FISA warrant was obtained through false pretenses and misrepresentation. An investigation shouldn't have started in the first place. Why legitimize a phony process? Trump was right.
@alltejuupptaget @MSNBC If he is not innocent then let Mueller write his report and make it known. The investigation has become too partisan that its legitimacy has become suspect.
@BarterLoch @MSNBC None has anything to do with collusion or obstruction of Justice which is the core mandate of the investigation. Finding crime is different from investigating crime.
@UnkaDub @MSNBC He has everything to worry about. His administration seemed to have been hijacked by partisan hacks who are bent on destroying him. The midterm also was skewed against Republicans due to some of these sentiments. Public opinion affects the ballot. Time to end this shenanigan.
@MSNBC This foolishness must stop. Mueller investigation has to end. It has become a tool for political activism and witch-hunt instead of a truth finding mission. This is a huge distraction from the real issues affecting America. Mueller should turn in his report real fast. Enough!!!!
@romy_nyc @MSNBC He is not going to take a chill pill forever. His administration is being derailed and undermined by a phony investigation. It's time for Mueller to put his cards on the table and let the chips fall where they may. This distraction impacted the just concluded midterm elections.

@RealJudgeLynn Ma'am I enjoy your program, I appreciate your perspective but I continue to hold the view that every relationship with a man and woman within a marriage context or courtship is a spiritual relationship. I trust you enjoy feedback cos that's important for any worthy cause. Shalom.
@DreamofCeline @RealJudgeLynn Giving advice that helps people is good but if it's not rooted in truth, then it's inherently incapable of setting people Free in the long run. I have witnessed a lot of relapse and people became worse because they never heard the truth. When truth takes root, the result is great
@DreamofCeline @RealJudgeLynn We will never come to a place where everyone will agree on the existence of God, however that shouldn't mean we should relegate God just to accommodate people who don't have respect for God. Truth must be presented cos that's what sets people Free not philosophy or anything else.
@DreamofCeline @RealJudgeLynn I agree. But Spirituality is important in analysing a spiritual relationship. You can't correctly help people in a spiritual relationship without recourse to spiritual truths. The existence of God is an incontrovertible fact that shouldn't be jettisoned just to appeal to a few.

@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton Look at who is talking about love? Look at your language, doesn't sound like the language of a person that understands love. Reveal your identity let's talk . Virtue signalling is the forte of leftists and sooner or later they reveal their true colors. Yours was too soon.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton I'm talking to a faceless person. Who are you? Reveal your identity let's talk. My point is now been taking out of context to justify your left leaning positions. We were having a civil conversation on how to engage as God's people. You have reduced it to insults and name-calling
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton You are obviously a troll. Our conversation has descended into ridiculousness. Now it's about blocking and innuendos and saying stuff that are outright silly. I will not engage you further.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton Even your language shows lack of maturity and meekness. You guys can never make your point without sounding condescending and mean.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton I called out Trump when babies were separated from their parents. I equally called out parents who put their babies in such avoidable situation. We must address issues holistically not chosing which sides we want to ventilate. Their parents were equally despicable.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton She is on the run for what? Please spare me your fake rage . She accused a man of something very grave as sexual assault and could not corroborated her story. We should just believe her for just making an accusation. If that same standard is applied to you how would you feel?
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton Stop villifying Christians and stop sounding judgemental. Look at your statement, can you listen to yourself. Making blanket statement about going to hell is very naive as it's disingenuous. Republicans are far more decent than all these godless power drunk folks in the left.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton Your outrage is misplaced. Channel it to people who support the murder of babies. Over 50 million babies murder so far. All the outrage about Kavanaugh was chiefly about abortion. Where was your outrage? God is a God of Justice and by Him actions are weighed.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton When kids were separated from the parents, I called out the president on the situation. But the law that permitted the officials to do such is the law of the land. Democrats and Republicans should come together and change the law and let's stop pontificating.
@Concern18017148 @BishopPMorton Collude with which enemy? I'm not a republican and there is no evidence republican party colluded with anybody to change the outcome of the elections. Zero evidence. So Democrats don't steal from the poor? Give me a break.
@BishopPMorton I have not asked you to bow to any man. I'm just encouraging you to be more circumspect with your positions. It reveals glaring hatred for Trump and bias against the GOP. Use your platform to do better in addressing all the issues in our community rather than the divisiveness.
@BishopPMorton I'm all for protecting women, but we must not destroy men and the society to do that. It's a slippery slope that can take us down to a dangerous place especially in our increasingly godless society. We must seek for truth,Justice and fairness for all involved. That's Christianity
@BishopPMorton How would you feel when paid actors start showing up and accusing you of what you didn't do? Do you want to live in a society where all women should be believed without evidence or corroboration to their stories. Is America now banana republic? Think about this brother.
@BishopPMorton I watched how you responded throughout Kavanaugh's confirmation and it didn't give me anything to cheer. How a man with a remarkable public life was almost destroyed by lies and politics of bitterness. None of the accusations could be corroborated. what if it was you?
@BishopPMorton Teenage pregnancy, lack of male figures in our homes, systematic breakdown of family, gang violence, godlessness, illiteracy etc. These are the real issues not Trump. We must focus on addressing them squarely and trust God to help folks in our community to rise up again.
@BishopPMorton Now Trump is the problem. Trump is not in any way our problem. We need to preach truth to folks in our community. We must speak out against abortion, same-sex marriage and all the Ills of the society through the preaching of the gospel of grace. That's our job not politiking.
@BishopPMorton What did you do when sin and lawlessness reigned supreme in this country? When pastors had their messages censored and victimized for standing up for righteousness. How many advocacy did you start to end abortion, same-sex marriage and all that is contrary to sound doctrine.?
You are a minister of the Gospel and should know that God has used even worse characters in the past to advance his purpose. Kavanaugh's story was never corroborated and as such shouldn't stop a man whose judical records speaks volumes from going to the supreme Court. Not fair!!! https://t.co/krnSVlsJKb
@BishopPMorton Of scrutiny. Recent events from the far left mob groups gives me a lot of concern. That's not how to engage in a civil society. Winning at all cost should equally apply to a party that was willing to destroy Kavanaugh even when no corroborating evidence was produced.
@BishopPMorton Now some pastors are indirectly rooting for the same party that made lawlessness the new normal. I'm not a republican but a dispassionate observer of what is going on. It's time for a new way of thinking. We should hold GOP accountable but must subject Democrats to the same level
@BishopPMorton Under Obama, all false ways were emboldened, how did the church respond? Under our watch same-sex marriage became a law, what did the church do? Under our watch abortion is still on demand. What has the Democratic party done to help this society? Yet blacks must vote for them.
@BishopPMorton The job figures and low unemployment has significantly helped the African American community and other minority groups. What exactly is the Democratic party campaigning on? No message. Just resistance and obstruction. Now they are espousing Democratic socialism. What a joke!!!
@BishopPMorton Today, many folks in the African American community can't get a job because they are not billingual. Is America now a Spanish country? These issues are multifaceted and must be analysed on its merit. Trump might be flawed in many ways but he is winning for all Americans.
@BishopPMorton Black Pastors must be very careful with the way they appraise the current situation. How many of them spoke against the evil of homosexuality, abortion, transgenderism and illegal immigration that hurts the black community. Do we want the Democratic party as currently constituted
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton Until you understand what gave us Trump, you will comment from a place of low information and risk misinforming others. Darkness was enveloping the nation through Many evil practices. Trump is a lifeline for the dying church that had lost his way. May God give you understanding.
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton Socialism- an economic model that has destroyed lives wherever it was practised. We have to be circumspect, redeeming the time, knowing what the will of God is. African Americans must stop viewing everything from the prism of race, it beclouds judgement and it's counterproductive
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton In judgement God always raises a crazier and unconventional character to judge his people or a system. Read Habakukk chapter 1. America was far lost and headed for destruction if God didn't stop these characters in the Democratic party. Today, they are embracing socialism.
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton While many think Trump is a very flawed character, but he has done more to advance God's purpose than any other president in living memory. I don't agree with a lot of what he says or does but he is a tool in the hands of God to rescue America. The rot in the system was too much
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton Obama became the president, but what exactly did he do for our community. He kept pandering to all people without a specific agenda that pleases God. He emboldened many false ways and sin and lawlessness became the new normal. The true church prayed and God intervened with Trump.
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton In political matters. Democrats gave us Trump. They became so godless that God raised a man like Trump to judge the system and to restore a bit of sanity in the hopes the church will arise and do the needful. Why many Ministers have not figured out this truth beats my mind.
@lemose_dailey @BishopPMorton Enough of this racial divisiveness!!!. Why are you villifying GOP? Why make it partisan? Is the problem of America all caused by GOP? How about all the evils been promoted by the Democratic party for decades? As Ministers of the gospel we have to be careful how we talk or engage
