How is this absurd...furloughed workers in WA are being offered FREE lift tickets to ski at one of the ski resorts...back pay for work not performed and a skiing too. No sympathy from me...BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
As the RIF zone approaches agencies begin to call furloughed workers back so they won‚Äôt be subject to the RIF.  Those that don‚Äôt get called back within the next couple of days should consider looking for employment elsewhere.

The left says they don‚Äôt like to hear him speak...The right doesn‚Äôt like looking at Pelosi. Take her up on submitting the SOU in writing as required and be done with it...call her bluff again!
No televised SOU...yes! Spared from having to watch Pelosi play with her teeth or whatever she always has in her mouth
Submit in writing all that is required by Art II, Sec 3 of the constitution anyway. https://t.co/DDQNyNhbrR

Pelosi wants to delay the SOU address until the gov‚Äôt reopens. She might want to go back and check and realize he is not required to provide an address to Congress. Only a written report (Art II. Sec 3) is actually necessary. Just write the speech and submit and requirement met.
