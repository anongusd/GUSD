Forgive my conspiratorial tone but, when I sit back and look at all that's taken place and is taking place, I have to ask. Is there anything remotely sane about where we are? #followthemoney #thebeat
Yes. #followthemoney is a big part of the secrecy but, the way so many are behaving, Putin must have something far worse that could destroy careers and send many to prison. #thebeat
The thing that gnaws at me is the idea that Media powers know what Putin knows and won't do anything because they're involved.  #thebeat
Stands to reason that since HRC had good intel back then, others did, too. But who? And why haven't they come forward? What does Putin have on them?  #thebeat
