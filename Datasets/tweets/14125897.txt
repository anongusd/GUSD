Women are going to be more than an "inconvenience" in Nov. We're going to elect @HillaryClinton‚Äîa true champion of women‚Äîas our next Pres.
It's clear @realDonaldTrump is temperamentally unfit to be president and his ideas and policies will hurt Granite State women and families
.@realDonaldTrump says pregnant women are an ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù to their	employer, what does that say about how he values women? It says a lot.
.@realDonaldTrump also said women should just "find another career or find another company" if sexually harassed in the workplace.
.@realDonaldTrump says if women want equal pay, we should just "do as	good a job‚Äù as men ‚Äì as if we aren‚Äôt already. Are you kidding me?
Not only would @realDonaldTrump defund Planned Parenthood‚Äîhe actually	said women should be punished for having abortions. Think about that.
.@realDonaldTrump wants to defund Planned Parenthood for providing	safe and legal abortions at health centers here in New Hampshire.
Today is #WomensEqualityDay. After @realDonaldTrump's visit to NH,	there are a few things I wanted to say about his "ideas" about women:
"@TimKaine is not only a good &amp; decent human being, but he has the most important qualification to be chosen as VP: he could be President"
"@TimKaine knows that words matter!" #nhpolitics
"@TimKaine has a record of bringing people together. Of fighting for the underdog." https://t.co/4ZlOKv4Glh
@RealDonaldTrump won‚Äôt release even one tax return. What is he so afraid of? Voters have a right to know! #nhpolitics
Why does @realDonaldTrump want to hide his tax returns from voters? @HillaryClinton &amp; @TimKaine have made years of their tax returns public
"We have to work everyday until Nov 8th to win NH for @Maggie_Hassan @TeamSheaPorter @HillaryClinton @TimKaine" #nhpolitics
I'm here at St. Anselm College w/ @TimKaine &amp; we are fired up &amp; ready to go! Watch live here: https://t.co/N0crt19vVm #nhpolitics

We need a President who listens, learns, has empathy, and who wants an America where we go forward together. We need @HillaryClinton!
.@HillaryClinton has a plan to treat the opioid epidemic like the health emergency it is and deploy the necessary resources to fight it
.@HillaryClinton has traveled to NH communities &amp; listened to stories of those struggling with addiction. She knows we're in this together
Opioid epidemic is ravaging communities. It affects old &amp; young, rich &amp; poor, Democrats &amp;Republicans. We all must work together to defeat it
TY Pam Livengood of Keene for bravely sharing your family's story of being affected by substance abuse #DNCinPHL
Great to run into @GabbyGiffords &amp; @ShuttleCDRKelly in Philadelphia. Look forward to watching your speech! #DNCinPHL https://t.co/gyYnX3P4WD
Great #VP pick by @HillaryClinton! @timkaine has the integrity, experience &amp; vision to be an exceptional Vice President. #StrongerTogether
The @GOP nominee stiffed his workers, cheered the housing crisis &amp; would eliminate the min wage. NH working families deserve #BetterThanThis
Look forward to seeing NH's Pam Livengood speak at the DNC next week on the impact of opioid epidemic on her family https://t.co/WF1AMYvVkh
It's clear that @RealDonaldTrump has found a like-minded VP who would be just as dangerous to the families and hard-workers of our state.
He cut wage protections for working families &amp; opposes an increase in the minimum wage which would give thousands of Granite Staters a raise
Time and again @Mike_Pence has demonstrated his intention to turn back the clock on equality for women and LGBT individuals.
Fitting that @RealDonaldTrump chose someone as committed as he is to implementing divisive &amp; discriminatory policies to be his running mate.
We need Hillary. We need Bernie. And we need each other. 		#NHTogether #StrongerTogether
With rising tension here at home, we need a leader who has spent so much of her life fighting for justice for the less fortunate.
Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief #NHTogether #StrongerTogether
While we are here today to unite our Democratic family, our goal needs to be to unite our American family. #NHTogether #StrongerTogether

The choice this November is very clear. That's why #ImWithHer.
.@HillaryClinton is the best candidate because she has made tough calls and done the hard work of protecting America's security &amp; prosperity
As a Foreign Relations Committee member, I'm confronted daily by the complexities involved in maintaining allies &amp; protecting our homeland.
.@HillaryClinton has the record and experience we need in our next President and Commander-in-Chief.
Hillary's speech was a thoughtful articulation of the way America will continue to lead and project strength.
.@HillaryClinton sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced. That's why #ImWithHer
Perhaps strangest of all:  He believes America is weak. He called our military a disaster.  He said we‚Äôre ‚Äì quote ‚Äì a ‚Äúthird-world country.‚Äù
Trump praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends, like the British prime minister and the Pope.
Donald Trump's ideas aren‚Äôt just different ‚Äì they‚Äôre deeply troubling and will cause America great harm.
Donald Trump lacks the knowledge, stability, and values to hold the office of the presidency.  He isn‚Äôt just incoherent; he‚Äôs dangerous.
RT @HillaryClinton: There's only one word for Trump's approach to foreign policy and national security: chaos.	https://t.co/Sx9s6NAGmr
Fighting w/ PM Cameron while praising Putin? It's clear @realDonaldTrump's foreign policy would be disastrous #nhpolitics
.@realDonaldTrump 70% of min-wage earners in NH are women. Removing fed. min wage would take the floor out from under them &amp; their families

.@elizabethforma: "NH doesn't deserve a senator who'll be there only some of the time - you deserve a senator who's there ALL of the time."
Great crowd in Concord with @elizabethforma on our Get Out The Vote Tour! Join our team: http://t.co/odCqMHQBHp http://t.co/Rsf8Bxrpw3
.@elizabethforma: "2 years ago Jeanne told me 'speak from the heart, say what you believe, tell them what you're going to do &amp; then do it.'"
Every day I‚Äôm fighting to level the playing field for the people of NH, to make sure families &amp; small business have opportunity to succeed.
Scott Brown voted to protect $20 bil in taxpayer subsidies for big oil &amp; $19 bil for big banks. NH residents subsidizing that is just wrong.
We need to invest in small businesses that are the heart of NH economy - not big oil, Wall Street and companies that ship our jobs overseas.
There‚Äôs been good economic news lately, but I understand that people in NH are still anxious - economic indicators don‚Äôt pay the bills.
Line out the door for our next stop in Concord with @elizabethforma on our Get Out The Vote New Hampshire Tour! http://t.co/kJwZ4dtxbq
Great first stop with @elizabethforma at @UofNH on our Get Out The Vote New Hampshire Tour! http://t.co/XSZgZNQSbj
.@elizabethforma: "Jeanne's put it all out there &amp; she'll keep up through election day &amp; every day after. She's out there fighting for you."
Big Oil, Wall Street &amp; companies that outsource don't need another Sen. to fight for them in DC. I fight for NH - always have, always will.
I don't care how many ads Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers run against me - I will never stop fighting for affordable health care.
Income inequality is the biggest threat to our economic future. We need to elect people who will work to close that gap, not make it worse.
Fundamental question at stake: what kind of future do we want? I want one where middle class families are strong &amp; everyone has a fair shot.
So excited to be in Durham with @elizabethforma! About to take the stage...
Ready to welcome @elizabethforma to the Granite State for our Get Out The Vote New Hampshire Tour! #nhpolitics http://t.co/yZ94AQEQeW

FACT CHECK: Scott Brown Opposes Raising The Minimum Wage, Turns His Back On Working-Class Granite Staters http://t.co/pN1n6LGqdF
two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women; we need to make sure they can support their families. #NH1Debate
I've spent a career fighting for the middle class: if we raise the minimum wage, it would lift 1 million people out of poverty #NH1Debate
The fact is: I attended 16 hearings on ISIS and was asking questions about ISIS before @SenScottBrown moved to New Hampshire #NH1Debate

I put New Hampshire first - like voting for equal pay for equal work.  @SenScottBrown voted against fair pay.  Twice. #NH1Debate
I work New Hampshire and I vote for New Hampshire.  that's what I've always done. #NH1Debate
Not responsible: politicians repeating ISIS talking points. We need serious people to talk about this in a serious way #NH1Debate
Can't play politics w/ ISIS. We must work together to defeat this threat. Need serious people to talk about this in a serious way #NH1Debate
We should not be talking about ISIS in a way that spreads fear and panic in our population.  #NH1Debate
FACT CHECK: Shaheen Supported Bipartisan Immigration Reform Bill That Would Boost Border Security http://t.co/bym5hk2pJY
.@SenScottBrown voted to cut resources for law enforcement...to provide tax breaks for millionaires - I would never do that #NH1Debate

Let's do what is going to work based on medical experts and emergency experts. #NH1Debate
Need to make sure at federal level we're providing support that local communities &amp; states need, b/c they're the 1st responders #NH1Debate
I met with emergency response and public health officials about plans in place here in New Hampshire. #NH1Debate

Because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the interest of New Hampshire businesses and families to be required to subsidize the oil industry.
I‚Äôve repeatedly voted to end the billions in dollars of tax breaks to big oil companies.
I‚Äôm not going to give up this fight. The jobs Shaheen-Portman will create &amp; energy savings to consumers/businesses are just too important.
My bipartisan energy efficiency bill would create 200k jobs, save $16 billion/yr, cut CO2 equivalent to 22 mil cars off the road.
As a State Senator and as Governor, I worked to restructure the electric industry and introduce competition.
Excited to speak at the 2014 NH Energy Summit. Proud of my efforts to encourage competition &amp; increase efficiency in the energy industry.

Working together, we‚Äôre going to win in November, and continue to put New Hampshire first. #TeamShaheen
New Hampshire deserves a Senator who puts New Hampshire first. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done and always will.
Big Oil &amp; Wall Street are spending millions to get @SenScottBrown back in the Senate. We won't let that happen. NH isn't a consolation prize
We‚Äôve been through a lot of fights together. And the people we fight for are New Hampshire‚Äôs working families. #TeamShaheen
My opponent's been paid over a quarter million dollars by a company that shipped U.S. jobs to Mexico &amp; China.  He even endorsed the strategy
My opponent blocked financial reform until he watered it down &amp; saved Wall Street $19 billion. They gave over $5 million to his campaign
My opponent voted to give the 5 biggest oil companies $20 billion in taxpayer subsidies &amp; got nearly half a million for his campaign.
No matter where @SenScottBrown lives, he‚Äôs going to put Scott Brown first.  Not you. Not your family. Not New Hampshire. #TeamShaheen
I didn‚Äôt just move here. I‚Äôve been here, working to make a difference for New Hampshire. #TeamShaheen

I‚Äôve fought to help NH companies export products &amp; create jobs. I want to sell NH products overseas. Scott Brown wants to send jobs overseas
We need leaders who understand that working families are the backbone of our country.#NHLaborDay
We need to knock doors, make calls, talk to friends. You know how to organize. When we organize, we win &amp; working families win #NHLaborDay
I want to invest in rebuilding our roads and bridges and create good jobs here in New Hampshire. #NHLaborDay
New Hampshire workers have been hit hard by the outsourcing...New Hampshire has lost the highest percentage of jobs to China.	#NHLaborDay
Tax code currently rewards companies that move jobs out of the country. That‚Äôs crazy and I have fought to close those loopholes #NHLaborDay
Last week with Market Basket, we saw the power workers can have when they stick together. #NHLaborDay
100+ years ago the men &amp; women of the org. labor movement set in motion a transformational series of changes...they built the middle class.
At the AFL-CIO Labor Day Bkfst this morning! Thanks Mark MacKenzie for putting together &amp; all you do for NH working families #NHLaborDay
