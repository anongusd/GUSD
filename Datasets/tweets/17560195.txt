When we engage people with their hands, it completely changes the energy of the event. #TacticalUrbanism is the best example of this. Coming together to make things together matters. Bill Lennertz The National #Charrette Institute  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
A charrette must be long enough to "allow you to get it wrong twice." -@andres_duany of @DPZCoDESIGN quoted by Bill Lennertz of The National #Charrette Institute  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
Charrettes offer immersion in one idea for a long time, as well as time compression: "Great things happen when you don't have quite enough time." -Leonard Bernstein quoted by Bill Lennertz of The National #Charrette Institute  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
"Here I am 25years later, still talking about charrettes." Bill Lennertz of The National #Charrette Institute  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
RT @Edward_Erfurt: The pressure of the park increased the demand for density that failed in other developments -Justin Duff  #CNU26
When #NewUrbanists came together, we were specialists trying to do a generalist's job. Charrettes were the vehicle for our collaboration. Bill Lennertz #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
Governance means you can be compelled--perhaps fined or court-ordered--to act or comply -Daniel Slone #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future" Dan Slone
Organizations can be nonprofits (501(c)3) and unincorporated. -Daniel Slone #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future" Dan Slone
There is a difference between an organization and governance. Typically, an org. is voluntary and consensual, agreed-on purpose. Governance imposes requirements. Most #neighborhood associations are organizations. #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
Daniel Slone speaks about how #neighborhood governance can work - #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
#Tailgating might be "the last urban neighborhood" jokes (without fully joking) - Emily Talen  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
The net result was an unraveling of #neighborhoods - Emily Talen  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future" She also calls for #NationalNeighborhoodDays to begin to restore neighborhood life
This started to unravel in the 19th century as we began to model cities for movement and individual freedom. Then a reaction in the late 19th/early 1900s, competitions for neighborhood plans, modernist ideals, etc - Emily Talen  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
Neighborhoods from ancient times: compact, formed around public space, or trade spaces, or religious institutions. Evidence exists that rich and poor lived together, not necessarily in harmony, but together.  - Emily Talen  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
"In the end I arrive at the concept of 'everyday neighborhoods' that are realistic for existing cities. - Emily Talen  #CNU26 "#UrbanDesign Patterns for the Future"
