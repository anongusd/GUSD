@sqeeqee You can always tweet the lyrics.
@sqeeqee Thanks Jenny! It was very helpful seeing how you did all that. I hope they’ll reinstate your Twitter soon since all you do is help people. :)
@sqeeqee Guess I’ll be parking on the sideline and wait out for the bleeding to stop. Lol I’m hoping that it’ll be soon.
@sqeeqee I do see your point. That actually happened to a good buddy of mine. He kept buying more and more but in “raindrops,” so he didn’t bring down his average much, yet he’s now running out of cash.
@sqeeqee Lol I’m not sure if I have the money to double down now though. I’m literally cash tight! I’m trying to get out.
@sqeeqee Of course. What would you like to know?
@sqeeqee It’s kind of embarrassing. Makes me look like a fool chasing it at the top, but my average is about $17k cause I bought more money at $18k+ than the $12k batch.
@sqeeqee Thanks, Jenny! My dilemma is if I should buy more $btc at this level? I got in quite high. Some at $12k and my last batch was in at near the top.
@sqeeqee Jenny, I hope you wouldn’t mind me picking your brain a bit cause I honestly do have a dilemma.
