Thanks, @LizKrueger, @riverkeeper would be pleased if New York took the next step fighting pollution by tackling polystyrene. We find it all over during our annual #RiverkeeperSweep cleanups every may from ADK to NYC!
Meant to say exemption but I guess exception works too!
@RJamesHayes And starting new funding in 2022 thru 2027/28 is not necessarily a doubling? It is an extension. Doubling would be say, a billion a year to CWIA or slightly less if you just spent the new money for 5 years starting this SFY.
@BasilSeggos says @NYGovCuomo #plasticbag ban includes an exemption for SNAP/WIC customers. At face value, this makes no sense to me. I am open to enlightenment but please explain the burden that an exception offsets? @LizKrueger @Bobby4Brooklyn @PatriciaFahy109 @toddkaminsky
The true number is closer to $80 billion! https://t.co/9u6FIv8tM4
@SeanMaharUnreal @BasilSeggos @riverkeeper Thanks! Also, I think he just said the new 2.5 will fund years 6-10 of the CWIA?
@RJamesHayes Did Basil just say that the new money extends the program to 10 years starting from 2017??
Thank you @JenMetzgerNY for asking @NYSDEC if approving new #fossilfuel infrastructure conflicts with the Governor's plans for a #GreenNewDeal.
@Bobby4Brooklyn asks a critical questions about which bags are covered under a ban. @BasilSeggos says they envision all plastic bags covered regardless of thickness. Thank you AM Carroll for supporting a fee on paper.
@BasilSeggos &amp; @SeanMaharUnreal: how much did Basil just say has been spent down on the CWIA thus far? Did I hear $350m on WIIA, $60m on IMGs, and $30m on source water protection land acquisition? @riverkeeper
Through expanding the program beyond the original 5-year cycle started in 2017. Not entirely a doubling but still pretty great for communities to have certainty that grants may be available beyond 3 years from now for projects that often have very long timeframes! https://t.co/kFIgkbbJkN

Bottom line is: the plastic pollution crisis is here and history will judge how the leaders of our time responded to the threat &amp; the ever-growing scientific consensus. How will history judge @NYGovCuomo on his response to the plastic threat? 10/
@LizKrueger/@SteveEngles introduced S7760/A9953 the NYS BYOBag Act last session &amp; I'm certain they would be thrilled if @NYGovCuomo lifted their bill. What matters is keeping the annual 23b plastic bags out of the environment in #NY. 9/ https://t.co/CPTxsDKhja
All the reasons above are why nearly 100 orgs wrote to @NYGovCuomo urging him to work with Speaker @CarlHeastie and Leader @AndreaSCousins  to step up to the plate in 2019 &amp; LEAD. Let's get the policy right the first time: a ban/fee hybrid is critical. 8/ https://t.co/zwrsExtb4m
In another success #CA's ban/fee legislation has led to a 70% decline in plastic bag litter as compared to 2010. We have to ask, is CA that different from #NY, that their policy has worked seamlessly but won't for us? NYers can adapt. 7/ https://t.co/4FXL0s9Qld
Plastic bags are just one area of policy to address the crisis. But, you gotta start somewhere. We need pol leaders to acknowledge that these policies work. Ex. Suffolk County, #NY's 5-cent fee on plastic/paper single-use bags has dropped use by 80%. 6/ https://t.co/7Bsl384EZ1
Also, let us not give the #climate &amp; #fracking connection. Plastic is made from primarily the #fossilfuels driving #climate. And the production of plastic &amp; its waste byproducts is a highly toxic area of the petrochem/fracking industry. 5/ @foodandwater https://t.co/kJWWeLRUuj
The health impacts of plastic are just coming into focus. Plastic is moving thru the food chain into seafood WE EAT. As particles break down they pick up toxic chems like PCBs (of the infamous Hudson River Superfund site- tx @generalelectric). 4/ https://t.co/DIYhHCr5NB
The EU reached a deal today to begin phasing out many single-use plastic items such as straws, cotton swabs and more. While India has pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022. Global efforts are moving swiftly, we must keep pace and LEAD. 3/  https://t.co/IXf5Q8IBuo
Another reason is that public policy is well suited to address it. Remember microbeads? The little plastic pellets in personal care products like body wash and face scrub. Well, Congress passed a law Dec 2015 to phase out microbeads by 2019. 2/ https://t.co/9trJqEGtkQ

@Stphn_Lacey @TheEnergyGang @JMPyper @JigarShahDC who support policy proposals that threaten business as usual. But to my original point, 100% renewable targets are quickly moving into the mainstream of democratic politics.
@Stphn_Lacey @TheEnergyGang @JMPyper @JigarShahDC Adding to that, I think words do matter and it isn't Trumpian to get upset about being called far left for supporting bold climate solutions, particularly since we are currently moving way to slow to avoid 1.5c. "Far left" is often used to marginalize people on the left...
@Stphn_Lacey @TheEnergyGang @JMPyper I agree with @JigarShahDC, there is a consensus about climate change and the need to mostly decarbonize by the end of the century. I don't agree with @Stphn_Lacey's assessment. The 100% renewable campaign has become mainstream, just look at Gov Phil Murphy in NJ.
