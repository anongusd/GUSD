This lawsuit is the fourth we've joined against Social Security in the past 5 months ‚Äì including lawsuits filed in Washington, Arizona and New Mexico. 		All underscore the ongoing harm that a number of same-sex couples continue to experience from marriage bans.
We‚Äôre fighting for Fred and Harvey‚Äîand taking a stand for the many other couples whose years together are deemed ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù at their time of most need. 		Application of this 9-month policy furthers the harm of discriminatory marriage bans years after marriage equality. #LGBTQ
Discriminatory, unconstitutional marriage bans prevented many committed couples from marrying until late in life. Fred and Harvey are one such couple. 		They married 2 weeks after the bans were lifted and they were legally able to wed, but it was too late.

Anthony Gonzales &amp; Mark Johnson were in a committed relationship from 1998 until Mark died in 2014. They lived in Albuquerque, NM. Anthony worked for a local nonprofit &amp; Mark was an elementary school teacher. 		They married the very first day they were legally able to in NM.
#BREAKING: Anthony Gonzales &amp; Mark Johnson were in a committed relationship for 15 years. They married as soon as they could. 		But Mark sadly died &lt;9 months later. Now Social Security has refused Anthony's application for survivor's benefits. We're suing.	https://t.co/4WEknMRjGW

Again, you can comment on the new proposed rule here (you have until midnight Eastern tonight): https://t.co/ed4mR8p7Fq
While our country‚Äôs immigration laws no longer *explicitly* exclude #PLWHA or treat #LGBTQ people and their families as less than, this sweeping proposed rule would once again put us at risk of both being kept out of the US and having our families torn apart. #PublicCharge https://t.co/lDXs9lCqbu
‚ÄúThe potential human costs attributable to the lives wrecked by this policy outweigh any purported economic savings to the government.‚Äù #PublicCharge https://t.co/NjdwssOKOa
Proposed educational &amp; English proficiency requirements are unfair and likely discriminatory. #PublicCharge https://t.co/2vm9fKD9Lf
Once again, a provision of the proposed #PublicCharge rule would both negatively weigh a factor while simultaneously penalizing access to the resources that could change that factor.
Creating a pay-to-play system of immigration that favors the wealthy is profoundly unjust, especially in considering populations that experience discrimination along multiple axes of identity. #PublicCharge https://t.co/mFjqjwtlUK
Reminder: Penalizing a medical condition while at the same time negatively weighing use of services that help to treat that medical condition makes no sense. The previous administration realized this was bad public health policy in 2009 &amp; lifted the #HIV entry ban. #PublicCharge https://t.co/Es8ZNOmOZG
Medicaid is the largest provider of #HIV care in the country. Restricting access for immigrants is both inhumane and dangerous. #PublicCharge https://t.co/GEuBbLGs3K
This proposed rule would force immigrants into the untenable choice of foregoing essential health, nutrition, and other critical programs for themselves and their families ... or risking their immigration status. #PublicCharge https://t.co/mLliIYI8uk
#LGBTQ immigrants are more likely to rely upon Medicaid and other government programs to assist themselves and their families with health insurance, nutrition, &amp; other supports. Loss of these programs will have devastating, cumulative impacts. #PublicCharge https://t.co/jbsvZPjyBC
This proposed expansion would create an overly broad #PublicCharge analysis for people immigrating. Under the new definition, 94% of all noncitizens who enter the US without Lawful Permanent Resident status would have at least 1 characteristic that @DHSgov could weigh negatively.
Longstanding #PublicCharge analysis considers if you receive public ‚Äúcash‚Äù assistance. Policy has been relied upon by immigrant families for 2 decades &amp; is consistent with Congressional intent &amp; case law. Change would add ‚Äúnon-cash‚Äù benefits such as health care &amp; housing.
In short, the proposed change to @DHSgov's #PublicCharge rule would be devastating for immigrant families who make use of existing benefits like #SNAP, #Medicaid, &amp; #RyanWhite #HIV care. Read the comments we submitted today here. https://t.co/R6qPUYdkIS

There exists a veritable constellation of legal protections for #LGBTQ people at work. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a particularly bright star, and it must be defended.
Bias-motivated violence against the #LGBTQ community is a pervasive national problem. It affects not only the safety and well-being of LGBTQ folks, but it impacts the streams of commerce and our national economy. The HCPA is a vital tool in the battle against this.
Hate crimes are on the rise. We are proud to join with @MattShepardFDN @FreeStateLGBTQ @ADL_National @TrevorProject @publicjustice &amp; @jaclseattle to take a stand against hate and defend the constitutionality of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
The HCPA is a constitutional exercise of Congress‚Äôs Commerce Clause authority because it seeks to address bias-motivated violence, which affects not just the victim‚Äôs economic power but also our communities &amp; economy as a whole. #LGBTQ

Special thanks to our clients Fatma &amp; Bryn for sharing their story, and joining us in court today. https://t.co/pAaiw3TJaS
The Court closes by asking us to work together to try and develop a resolution for the individual claims. He will consider taxpayer standing. Court requests we return in 6 weeks with a statute from both sides. No rulings from the bench. And we're out!
In closing: The defendants' (HHS &amp; USCCB's) stance is what threatens children in foster care. There‚Äôs an entire universe of possible loving homes being denied to children in the government‚Äôs care, because of this religious discrimination.
Congress‚Äôs tax and spending powers specifically authorized this grant, and continues funding this year after year, knowing that the funds are explicitly distributed to a religious organization that practices a #LicenseToDiscriminate based on a religious test.
Judge Mehta and LL Senior Attorney Jamie Gliksberg engaged in a long discussion on the implications of various legal decisions regarding taxpayer standing and congressional appropriations. Wish you were here, #AppellateTwitter! üòò
Again, we are not looking to take away funding from USCCB. We are happy to provide accommodations; but the process must be as seamless for same-sex couples as it would be for different-sex couples. 		As long as people can equally submit their applications.
It's not just about the opportunity to become foster parents. Stigma itself is a cognizable injury under the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses. 		Two separate injuries: loss of opportunity &amp; stigma related to unequal treatment. 		Change in government process is necessary.
HHS's actions became explicit governmental coercive endorsement of religion when they ratified who could or could not participate in government services. 		And that is a violation of the Establishment Clause. https://t.co/Dw9mcjtFVg
Defendants want to focus on it being just "a lost opportunity‚Äù to foster a child.		But how about government message being sent to Fatma Bryan and other same-sex couples, that they are somehow less worthy or less deserving? 		This subjected them to demeaning unequal treatment.
To be clear: Ignoring Fatma &amp; Bryn's complaint, that's not a failure to respond, it is a denial. It‚Äôs HHS's program, they are supposed to be responsible for it--	The Court: "It's a de-facto denial."	Gliksberg: "Correct."
2 specific government actions make the injuries traceable:.	1. HHS ratified the discrimination in providing the money knowingly to USCCB, who stated CLEARLY they would administer the program in line with their religious beliefs.	2. They did not respond when clients complained.
The USCCB &amp; DOJ tried to argue that there is no traceability between the injuries our clients experienced and the federal government. Wrong!
Enjoining the policy would resolve the injuries experienced here, but we‚Äôre not asking that the government remove all funding to USCCB. There are various mechanisms in which USCCB continues to provide services. 	These could be part of remedy determined later in litigation.
The Court: So what are our options for redress?	Jamie Gliksberg: ‚ÄúRedressability is easily established when the injury arises from an identifiable discriminatory policy.‚Äù We don‚Äôt need to at this stage determine what would make the most remedy.
Let's be clear: We are challenging the government‚Äôs own conduct, not USCCB‚Äôs. The federal government is fully responsible for this program. 		The fact that they gave away the responsibilities to a grantee does not mean they are not responsible for upholding the Constitution. https://t.co/10YctqXcW1
The government is knowingly enabling &amp; authorizing these programs to be run under a Catholic doctrine, and this means they would not provide these services to same-sex couples. They openly say they will be discriminating on this basis. They admit this in their own brief! https://t.co/tgaeMHZW2D
Jamie: The HHS is encouraging USCCB to discriminate using a religious-based test. There are anti-discrimination rules &amp; policies. They are not being applied or enforced. 		HHS is providing these grants, but PROCESSES in place are violating policies and violating the Constitution.
The Court: Would you be satisfied if I ordered HHS to do what USCCB is doing? Accepting applications and processing them and placing children?
Jamie shines in driving home the big points: The way it‚Äôs set up in Texas is that USCCB is the only grantee that is accepting Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program applications. 		This is the ONLY place for Fatma and Bryn to apply to foster a refugee or unaccompanied minor.
And our attorney, Jamie Gliksberg is up!		"We are asking that our clients be able to walk into the agency's office and not be discriminated against, stigmatized, or faced with other obstacles that another couple would not face." üôåüèΩ
USCCB lawyer argues that our clients did not seek reasonable redress. 		Fatma and Bryn literally called up to file a complaint. HHS's decision to maintain radio silence towards them is tacit authorization of discrimination.
The USCCB lawyer continues. Implies that sanctioning USCCB would affect thousands of refugee children; appealing to ‚Äúharming the children‚Äù logic. 		What harms children more, potentially placing them in loving homes or a large organization withholding all services altogether?
PRO TIP: If you are comparing yourself to THE KKK (!) to prove that you‚Äôre not practicing discrimination ‚Ä¶ your scale of what distinguishes as discrimination might need a LITTLE adjustment! https://t.co/RVS7dzpeSL
USCCB lawyer: The government hired the USCCB, one of the largest foster care providers in the country. There is a distinction. 	You don't hire the KKK unless you want them to discriminate ‚Äî that's not us. (??!!)
Court: I don‚Äôt think anyone would be up here saying it is their "sincere religious belief" that children cannot be placed with African American parents.		USCCB: There is a distinction there.		(Us: ... )
Court: I find it hard to believe that you need to define encouragement as anything other than ‚Äúlooking the other way‚Äù. 		I don't think anyone up here would be making these allegations if this was discrimination based on race, or based on age.
Court: The grant specifically said: "We will conduct this program in accordance with our religious beliefs.‚Äù 	There is a portion of their website that says children should be placed in a home with a married male and female. It says it. Let's not put our heads in the sand.
@ahnalee13 Hi Anna, you can direct any questions to our help desk: https://t.co/DC1mFK7S2b
USCCB: They haven‚Äôt given us any sort of specifics as to what redress would look like.		... Have y'all considered maybe ... not discriminating? https://t.co/sZ944TPFgJ
Court: Why couldn‚Äôt I order your agency to offer foster care opportunities to all? Couldn't I give you all some discovery time to find that this relief might be possible? 		USCCB: Even looking at other refugee programs, it‚Äôs speculative that they would step forward.
USCCB attorney: The whole premise of their filing is that the government funding somehow changes the behavior of the grantee.		...Actually, the premise of our filing is that same-sex couples should be treated the same as any other when they walk into an agency. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø https://t.co/cMINuEpAhb
Court: Is there a specific anti-discrimination provision that is a condition of the grant?		USCCB attorney: I‚Äôm not aware there is anything specific in the grant itself. Plaintiffs cite a couple of HHS regulations in their filing ... 		(We sure do!)
The USCCB is trying to pass the buck to the Catholic Charities of Fort Worth, saying they have no control over how the sub-grantee behaves. 		This is F A L S E. 		The USCCB has OPENLY admitted that they would cease funding sub-grantees if they were to license same-sex couples. https://t.co/FCMI9gre8W
USCCB attorney now speaks; asks us to "take a step back and remember how we all got here." 	Congress started a program to care for unaccompanied minor refugee children. The Conference just so happens to be one of the largest providers of care in the country.
Program in question was established via congressional mandate. 	DOJ position is that because there are no specific refs to charitable orgs in Act that established the program, &amp; there‚Äôs no specific mention of religious orgs in appropriations themselves, that = lack of standing.
DOJ representing HHS moves to brief discussion of the issue of taxpayer standing. Say that can only be applied in v specific instances, and this case doesn't qualify. Cites Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation.
DOJ asserts that it's at the government‚Äôs discretion to engage with any service provider. 		Court suggests that it would be possible for HHS to perhaps fill a void by finding another provider.
DOJ on behalf of HHS: You know, this example you're making, [with racial discrimination in foster are placement], it's a terrible-sounding situation ...		The Court: No more terrible than the one experienced by the plaintiffs, honestly. https://t.co/lYHiH6b9Tb
The Court: Wouldn‚Äôt it be an appropriate relief to provide an injunction against an agency receiving funding until they cease discriminating?		DOJ: You don‚Äôt have the authority to grant that kind of injunction. 		Court: Why don‚Äôt I have that authority?
DOJ: What can the court order the government to do? What kind of relief can the court fashion? That wouldn‚Äôt bring the plaintiffs any closer to the relief they‚Äôre seeking: to foster a child.		(Potentially! But this is a premature question at this stage of litigation.)
Court: As long as we allow the discrimination to happen at the grantee or sub-grantee level, the government can‚Äôt do anything? That can‚Äôt be right.		(Nope, it's not!)
Court: ...Okay, understood, you don‚Äôt control the (sub-grantees') decision-making or religious beliefs. On the other hand it should come as no surprise that if you‚Äôre going to award funds to an organization that explicitly practices religious beliefs, there will be consequences.
DOJ lawyer representing HHS: The individual claims of this case lack traceability, decisions were made by individual grantees. The federal government does not control them		Us: https://t.co/OahzG1KcWR
Court: Can this couple, by virtue of being in Fort Worth area, only be guaranteed foster placement by Fort Worth area org?	DOJ: Depends on scope of the grantees‚Äô ability to work with families. 		Admits to not being aware of any other options existing that work w/ this program.
The The Court analyzes several forms of relief potentially available for this case. The DOJ asserts the Court does not have legal standing to order the federal government to engage with any specific grantee, although the agency might be willing to work additionally with another.
DOJ: The individual plaintiffs have only asserted claims to a specific episode: that would not provide a basis for plaintiffs to challenge how grant monies are spent across the country.		Court: Maybe, but we do know USCCB is a substantial subgrantee of the agency.
Court narrows in on harms, in addressing DOJ lawyer: "Say one of your grantee's positions says children should only be placed with Latino families. No Asian families allowed. If the agency knows about it, you mean to tell me that that could go on without any redress?"
CLARIFIER: The same-sex couple we're representing was rejected by the Catholic Charities of Fort Worth, a sub-grantee of the US Conf of Catholic Bishops, one of 2 grantees responsible for administering the HHS Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program, a 100% TAXPAYER-funded program.
Here you have an issue of constitutional principle. In this stage, since you‚Äôre only challenging standing, I have to presume they will prevail on the merits. 		If the agency is authorizing that particular behavior that violates these, why are you making an argument on standing?
Court begins by interjecting into the DOJ‚Äôs opening arguments: ‚ÄúThe plaintiffs are not disqualified by being a same-sex couple, right? That‚Äôs the agency‚Äôs (HHS) position?‚Äù 		DOJ attorney fumbles, saying there is no specific policy on this.
Judge Amit Mehta is presiding. We‚Äôre here to hear arguments on the DOJ‚Äôs Motion to Dismiss. The federal government is trying to say they're not responsible, and they want to toss the case. https://t.co/qTyav0eVC3

1992-1997: Army &amp; National Guard veteran Margarethe Cammermeyer fought back when discharged due to her sexual orientation. Lambda Legal was proud to represent her along w/@legal_voice, winning a landmark 1994 decision in the fight against "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." #VeteransDay
LL has a long history of fighting for full inclusion of #LGBTQ service people, for one reason: Everyone deserves the right to work in their chosen job with dignity, without being forced to hide who they are. 		Countless veterans have spent full careers in service, in hiding.

This #Halloween, don‚Äôt forget: Decisions made by @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs judges will haunt us FOR A LIFETIME! üëª	CALL YOUR SENATORS, tell them to REJECT #TrumpsScaryNominees: https://t.co/DkNKY3Drfh https://t.co/bWvYrtPGf3
Judicial nominees like Chad Readler and Eric Murphy have received far less attention than others, but know this: They are committed to rolling back the hard-won progress of the last 60 years. They're two of #TrumpsScaryNominees, and we must keep fighting: https://t.co/LFoRDGX6uC https://t.co/p142VDeLUv
Michael Truncale is a conservative ideologue whose past statements show a hostility to immigrant rights, voting rights, reproductive freedom, workers‚Äô rights, #LGBTQ rights, campaign finance limits, environmental protection, and common-sense gun control. #TrumpsScaryNominees https://t.co/ULyHi7jLrw
Trump judicial nominee Wendy Vitter has pushed fake science and misinformation to further her dangerous agenda. Vitter is clearly unfit to judge and doesn‚Äôt belong on the federal bench. #TrumpsScaryNominees https://t.co/C7DXXeTZb5
District court nominee Howard Nielson infamously claimed in 2011 that a gay judge couldn‚Äôt be trusted to rule impartially on a case involving #LGBTQ rights. Senators must reject Nielson, who is clearly unfit to serve. #TrumpsScaryNominees https://t.co/peMhR6amki
The Trump administration is arguing that the #ACA's protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional. Who signed the brief? One of #TrumpsScaryNominees to the Sixth Circuit ‚Äì Chad Readler. Yikes! https://t.co/paXvPdBax2
Texas district court nominee Matthew Kacsmaryk is an anti-#LGBTQ activist and culture warrior who does not respect the equal dignity of all people. He's one of #TrumpsScaryNominees and should NOT be confirmed to a lifetime position on the federal bench. #courtsmatter https://t.co/etT0ibER4u
District court nominee J. Campbell Barker is a conservative ideologue who's devoted the last several years to restricting voting rights, LGBTQ equality, immigrant rights, reproductive freedom, environmental protection, and fairness for criminal defendants. #TrumpsScaryNominees https://t.co/P4lH8Nlb72
Andrew Brasher of Alabama is one of #TrumpsScaryNominees. He's a crusading ideologue who's devoted much of his career to attempting to restrict civil rights. Definitely does NOT belong on the federal bench. #courtsmatter https://t.co/yVuMeOJj1m
Don't forget about Thomas Farr, Trump's judicial nominee from North Carolina with connections to one of the most influential racist hate groups of the 20th century. All senators must unite against hate and reject Farr ‚Äì one of #TrumpsScaryNominees. https://t.co/fIa1gNs6Xd https://t.co/NKlfeWDnKC

Transgender service members ‚â† a burden. 	Transgender service members ‚â† a burden. 	Transgender service members ‚â† a burden. 		No matter how the administration tries to legally disguise discrimination: We see it. We won't stand for it. We're with you. #TransMilitaryBan
The DOJ mischaracterizes our argument that the President is prone to discovery as us saying his role is equivalent to anyone else. 		That's not the argument we made, but, when the discriminatory action originates from the President, we need to know the details. Plain as that.
Our counsel to the Court regarding the discovery we need, and the DOJ's petition to strike down the motion for discovery: 	Let the district court and the process work like they‚Äôre meant to. Don‚Äôt become a referee. This is not a case warranting mandamus. #TransMilitaryBan
Our counsel: This is an Equal Protection case where we have a policy that is discriminatory on its face, and heightened scrutiny applies. We need discovery to find out what really happened. #TransMilitaryBan
Here's the thing: We want documentation regarding the decisionmaking involved in the #TransMilitaryBan. Anything remotely related to decisionmaking, the DOJ has withheld, or otherwise wrapped in privilege. 		The January report they keep citing? We don‚Äôt even know who authored it. https://t.co/09mpjDE9RK
This part of the #TransMilitaryBan argument is deep in legal discourse. 		Have some facts:  	üëâüèΩ #Transgender service members are NOT A BURDEN. 	üëâüèΩ They are able and willing to serve as well as anyone else. 	üëâüèΩ The Ban is discriminatory, callous, and unconstitutional.
Rather than telling the District Court that 10 days to produce the documents asked-for in the discovery order was unreasonable, the Trump administration filed a petition for the Ninth Circuit to essentially chastise the lower court.	They ARE asking the Court to act as a referee.
The Court: "It seems like you‚Äôre asking us to be discovery referees."		Alternatively, the White House could release the documents. #TransMilitaryBan https://t.co/LCwnqiVgnQ
DOJ says that requesting #TransMilitaryBan document discovery from the White House should be "a last resort". 		There's just one problem. https://t.co/aMXI9VChE4
DOJ characterizes that the discovery that the we have sought is ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù, argues that drafts of Executive Orders and communications from the President with his advisors are absolutely protected under executive privilege. #TransMilitaryBan
Matter of vacating the injunction rests. We move onto the second part of today's hearings, in which DOJ is arguing for a writ of mandamus against the District Court's discovery order. 		Translation: They REALLY don't want to release documents re: creating the #TransMilitaryBan.
The DOJ has latched onto the Court's reference to Trump v. Hawai'i, stating that this case is very much the same in many ways. 		Discrimination is discrimination, no matter how many (withheld) papers you shuffle, and no matter how you dress it up. #TransMilitaryBan
The Court: Is citing ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù not really just a way to discriminate against transgender people? #TransMilitaryBan
La Rond Baker argues on behalf of the @AGOWA, citing that the state of Washington has a compelling interest in rejecting the #TransMilitaryBan.
It is common for military personnel of all gender experiences to be non-deployable for limited amounts of time due to medical conditions or treatment. 		Cis women may become pregnant, but that's no acceptable reason to limit them accession into the military. #TransMilitaryBan
Rule presently exists that says ANY serviceperson cannot be non-deployable for more than 12 months for medical treatment w/o facing separation. 		Concerns re: "long recovery times" for transition-related care are a false flag. #TransMilitaryBan
The Court: What is your irreparable damage at risk?		Counsel: Stigmatization and unequal treatment. The only way that #transgender people COULD serve would be as second-class citizens. This is classic unequal treatment. #TransMilitaryBan
The Court: How can I say based on the record before me that it‚Äôs either constitutional or unconstitutional?		Counsel: Because the level of scrutiny that must be applied is clear. #TransMilitaryBan
Regarding "military deference": Just because it‚Äôs the military doesn‚Äôt change the level of scrutiny that should be applied here. 		That has been settled law for 10-15 years. #TransMilitaryBan
Whether you apply strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny, the government loses here. The government knows that the ban does not pass intermediate scrutiny.		We haven‚Äôt even had discovery of what was going on behind the curtain when this was put together. #TransMilitaryBan
From our counsel: "We don‚Äôt have a neutral policy. We have a policy that is discriminatory on its face and targets a minority group." #TransMilitaryBan
The Court cites the travel ban case, saying that this is potentially analogous. 		"You can say all you want about what happened in 2017, but now that the policy is on the table, it‚Äôs offered with different support."
There are ample facts in the record that demonstrate that this is simply an enforcement of the ban as Trump issued it. #TransMilitaryBan
The Court states the ‚Äúnew‚Äù implementation plan is ‚Äúnot the same‚Äù as the original ban. Our counsel advises on how, precisely, they ARE the same.		This is not about gender dysphoria. This policy bans transgender people whether they‚Äôve had gender dysphoria or not. #TransMilitaryBan
The Court: "What would be your irreparable harm if this injunction was left in place?" 		DOJ cites threats to "readiness". 		This argument has been historically used to restrict women, people of color &amp; LGB folks from joining the military. It has been disproven. Repeatedly.
DOJ argues that non-deployable time incurred by transgender troops for transition-related treatment will be unacceptably burdensome.		FACT CHECK: Even under extreme assumptions, would constitute 0.0015% of available deployment years. #TransMilitaryBan
Court refers to complicated, conflicted characterizations of the policy from the DOJ: "Defining this ... This is almost a platypus." #TransMilitaryBan
The court cuts in: "What do you have to show us that would vacate the preliminary injunction?" #TransMilitaryBan
The DOJ's argument continues. Contrary to stated intention, it stigmatizes people experiencing gender dysphoria (read: #transgender people) by highlighting their mental health struggles. 		This is a tired argument that too many of us have heard before. #TransMilitaryBan
DOJ lawyer Brinton Lucas opens their argument. Asserts that "policy" only targets people diagnosed with the medical condition of gender dysphoria. Tries to say that others precluded from service by medical conditions aren't stigmatized.

Between constant efforts to dismantle the #ACA, the White House-backed lawsuit in TX fighting to allow pre-existing condition exclusions, and now this: It is as clear as ever that President @realDonaldTrump doesn‚Äôt care about people living with #HIV or the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
People living with #HIV and using consistent treatment are no longer able to transmit HIV. #Medicaid and #RyanWhite help make this possible! 		Denying immigrants care not only denies them the ability to maintain their own health, but seriously impacts public health. #PublicCharge
The #RyanWhite #HIV/#AIDS care benefit is incredibly important and provides care to many low-income immigrants. It is wildly unethical to mandate that immigrants choose between their lives and health care vs. their legal status. #PublicCharge
In other words: People who utilize EXISTING federal programs to help keep families fed &amp; medical needs covered will automatically have odds turned against them in applying for a green card. Forcing people to choose between food, health or legal status = INHUMANE. #PublicCharge
Revision would update qualification of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù (someone who might ‚Äúprimarily depend on the government for subsistence".) Formerly, this = only those who receive cash welfare. New definition would penalize people using benefits like #SNAP, #Medicaid &amp; #RyanWhite #HIV care.

We're also urging the release of gov't documents related to the #TransMilitaryBan &amp; fighting back against Trump‚Äôs aggressive claims of ‚Äúexecutive privilege.‚Äù https://t.co/vScAHHwELt
Since then, DOJ and the Trump administration have been trying every trick in the book to sell their reverse-engineered reasons for the ban. So far, the courts have denied their ruse, each and every time. 	https://t.co/LmReg2T2eU
Of course, losing in court didn‚Äôt stop the Trump administration from cobbling together an ‚Äúimplementation plan‚Äù to try &amp; reverse-engineer reasons for the #TransMilitaryBan. üôÑ 	We urged the Court to see through the charade. https://t.co/Kbtpg2vA3D
Read the RAND study on the impacts of open service by #transgender troops here: https://t.co/hMUc9bZIc8
REMINDER: A previous ban on open service by #transgender troops was thoroughly researched. In 2016 an announcement was made that it was unjustified &amp; would be lifted. A government-sponsored RAND study determined a ban couldn‚Äôt be justified by military readiness OR cost concerns.
At first DOJ appealed the injunction against the #TransMilitaryBan.  But then they backed down.  Only to change their minds again and launch another appeal. üôÑ https://t.co/uiBGEFxXHr
And by December, the Court ordered a preliminary injunction (a halt) on the ban: https://t.co/tBWxxwLOSe https://t.co/p72hv56I1v

The Trump/Pence administration, and particularly @TheJusticeDept, continue to weaponize religious-based organizations to discriminate.
The Trump/Pence admin has continually taken the side of the religious extremists, saying time and again that it is okay to discriminate against marginalized communities based on religious beliefs. This is in DIRECT opposition to established civil rights laws. Unacceptable. https://t.co/BU8ZjDyI2k

Now, those folks are trying to use #SCOTUS to do their bidding. To protect our care, we must #SaveSCOTUS and #StopKavanaugh! https://t.co/s0dibabOs0
SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a threat to abortion access. He worked to block an undocumented minor who was held in government custody from her right to abortion care. He is an extremist who will NOT defend #RoevWade. #SaveSCOTUS  #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake
When the President ALREADY believes he is above the law, a #SCOTUS pick who believes that ‚Äúcriminal investigations and prosecutions of the President‚Äù should be deferred while he is in office is INCREDIBLY dangerous. #SaveSCOTUS #StopKavanaugh #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/U2rmsmxOZA

"Kavanaugh has every reason to hide his record from public view. Just like Trump and his Federalist Society supporters, he's likely to want to help carry out a deeply unpopular anti-choice, anti-#Obamacare and anti-#LGBTQ agenda." ‚Äì@SharonMcGowanDC https://t.co/mzZLKgqsKG

These are just a few of the facts to keep in mind when @realDonaldTrump tells you that this is an independent &amp; fair-minded jurist. #Kavanaugh would not serve the rights of all‚Äîparticularly not vulnerable groups whose rights may be litigated before #SCOTUS in our lifetimes. üôÖüôÖ
You may also remember #BrettKavanaugh from his ruling as part of a 3 judge panel that found an undocumented minor in need of an abortion required a govt-appointed guardian, which delayed her access to necessary care. #WhatsAtStake #SCOTUSPick	https://t.co/LC9WkTfSIY
While serving on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, #Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy dissent in Sissel v. HHS that would have struck down the #ACA as unconstitutional. #WhatsAtStake #SaveTheACA #SCOTUSPick
HOW CONVENIENT: Judge #BrettKavanaugh has argued passionately in law review articles that sitting presidents shouldn't be subject to civil OR criminal charges while in office. #SCOTUSPick #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/FOwLfsrMo0
IN FACT: (Despite his claims otherwise) #Kavanaugh is SO partisan that conservative group @FRCdc, vigorously advocated on behalf of his 2003 nomination. 	*We know* nothing's changed. He poses a threat to the #ACA, #ReproRights, &amp; checking executive power.	#SaveSCOTUS #SCOTUSPick https://t.co/UOMDmqK8id
Unsurprising: #BrettKavanaugh is conservative, a strict textualist, and clerked for Justice Kennedy. He is an admirer of Justice Scalia &amp; counts Neil Gorsuch as a close friend.  #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/JDY7Cm6wiV
