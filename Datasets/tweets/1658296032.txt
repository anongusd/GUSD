Limitations of Prolonged Exposure and Cognitive Processing Therapy for #ptsd #pe #cpt https://t.co/WBwm6MaHuW
There haven't been any large scale studies of male veterans with combat trauma using PE. Studies on female veterans w/ #MST
Data on #CPT show most people retain their #ptsd diagnosis even if they see significant reduction in symptoms
All VAs must offer prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive processing therapies (CPT)
Until mid-2000s, service members would be immediately discharged if they got #ptsd diagnosis. Meaning DOD had no capability to treat
