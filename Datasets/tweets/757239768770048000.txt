@HCStracheFP DANKE!!!! Das wir auch dem Fl√ºchtlingspakt NICHT beitreten. SUPER!!! Wir werden von vielen L√§ndern beneidet, allen voran vom deutschen Volk, sollte es dieses so noch geben.
@Hartes_Geld Wie wir wissen, "Fl√ºchtlinge" kosten viel Geld. Dieses muss woanders abgezogen oder durch h√∂here Steuern eingebracht werden. Besser eine  Unterst√ºtzung vor Ort. Damit bleiben die "Kulturen" unter sich, es gibt keine Ausbeutung der Sozialsysteme/ Einfuhr des Islams etc.....

@AfDimBundestag Im Namen der ganzen Welt (vieler L√§nder, vieler Menschen), stoppen Sie bitte die Unterschrift auf den UN Pakt. Wie? Ich denke, dass ALLE Deutschen (sind ja nicht mehr so viele) auf die STRASSE gehen sollten. Sonst geben sie stillschweigend ihre Zustimmung.
@DIXIEDOODLE12 @SpaCare @CryptoKoba Maybe it is better :-)
@StiebritzMaria @webaxvita Ja, das kenne ich. Ich glaube es gilt, das Verst√§ndnis zu wecken, dass, wenn keiner etwas macht, dies eine stillschweigende Zustimmung ist!
