@EricBoehlert You can't expect Trump or as a matter of fact from political class to go for comprehensive Gun Reforms as they are hand in gloves with NRA and cherished more and more funds &amp; favour from it who is always forthcoming in donating a huge sum across the political spectrum.
@abpnewshindi Not effectively controlling cow vigilante, lukewarm in response towards love jihad, restricting food habit of Indian, spending too much from coffer to celebrate Diwali in Ayodhaya, appointing Gajendra Chouhan in Pune Film Institute &amp; Pahlaj Nihalani that is only use of religion.
@zdor17602 2nd Amendment never talk about or give rise to selling or having right to military grade/bump atocks/ assault rifle etc. that too for school/ college going kid, mentally unstable or criminals. The unscrupulous NRA illegally interpreted this to establish a bloody gun culture in US
@EdKrassen Movement launched by Students led by Parkland High School for Gun Reforms will find special place in world history in Golden letter.	Perhaps nowhere in world such a relevant &amp; logical mass movement initiated by teenager drawing support from every quarter has ever be initiated.

@arthur_affect @eclecticbrotha Arming the teacher to protect school is idiotic ideas as School is not place to brandishing of Gun and spreading Gun Culture.	There is huge cost involved in Arming teachers, training and logistical arrangement.	This ideas is for diverting attention from core issues of Gun control
@IndivisibleVV @CherylRutledg17 GOP and Trump is disturbed by student movements for Gun Regulations and reforms but both are not at all inclined towards comprehensive gun reforms as on roll of NRA. What they will offer little bit of concession on Gun Control and wait for people movement to fade. So turn US blue
@krassenstein The solution to mass shooting is simple.	1. School/ college going kid, mentally unstable person, criminals not to be allowed Gun.	2. Banning of Bump Stocks.	3. Strong background check for Gun aspirants.	4. No donation from NRA allowed.	5. No military grade gun for anybody.

@BungalowBILLcom @wenz66 @JoyAnnReid @PamBondi @FLGovScott @NRA It is clear now that source of all Mass shooting incidents is NRA. Unless and until NRA is disbanded nothing in regards of Gun Control will happens.	So mass movement to banish NRA need to be built and all legislators &amp; executive be punished for their collusion with NRA.
@yogaskidogs @Brasilmagic This is most idiotic explanation I have heard no way most of the countries in world allows School/ college going kid, mentally unstable person, criminals etc to have access to Gun. There are different forms of Gun Regulations available to prevent that.	US must bring Gun control.
@EdKrassen US should have broken diplomatic ties long back with Russia as they are manipulating electoral system, hacking all classified documents with full fledged cyber war.
@krassenstein Why the school/ college going kid, mentally unstable person, criminals etc be allowed access to gun at all.	It serve no purpose. For self defence to others categories type of Gun may be restricted.	The need of hour is strict rational &amp; progressive Gun regulations.
@Christie_D22 @whirrll At least Obama in hour of crisis remains present to express his sympathy &amp; support to victims.	What about GOP senators congressman who even do not want to have debate on Gun Regulations. 	They are fucking bunch of inhumane lot out there to support gun lobby &amp; NRA come what may.
@StopTheSpeaker Paul Ryan is sadly out of realities with no concerns for victims of mass shootout.	He all efforts is for self perpetuation &amp; selfish monster as on date.
@schoolwalkoutUS @KatherineS603 This may turn put to be a good initiative to build mass movement to hit at NRA unholy nexus of It with executive, legislature and unless and until it is broken through mass protest the strict Gun Regulations will not see the light of day.
@krassenstein Let the Emma Gonzalez become the rallying points for the strict, full proof and rational Gun Regulations. 	Without any mass movement the objectives to prevent school/ college going kid, mentally unstable person, criminals to have gun access can not be achieved.
@SusResister @BarackObama I doubt GOP is going for Gun Regulations though Democrats appear to be a good prospect but voters must take unequivocal commitment from them regarding Gun Regulations before voting them in Nov 19 elections.	NRA must be booked for their indirect complicity in mass shooting.
@KamalaHarris The greed &amp; generous donation of NRA to both executive &amp; legislator is preventing them to even go for rational &amp; full proof gun regulations and enabling the school/ college going kid , mentally unstable person, criminal to cause more &amp; more deadly shootout incidents.
@EdKrassen There is apathetic and total anti human approach of both executive &amp; legislator in matter of allowing school/ college going kid, mentally unstable person &amp; criminals to have full access &amp; exposure of Gun that to assault rifle, bump stocks etc.	It is time to plug gun regulations.

@ProudResister @sherrywgv FBI director is undergoing a severe pressure from Session to fire Maccabe the deputy director of FBI on the prompting of Trump so as to make FBI subservient to vile interest of Trump.	Trump is going to kill all great institutions of US for his narrow self interest.
@EdKrassen @ArgusC Trump fascination for fossil fuel will worsen the climate change as endanger future generations. 	His policy is clear in order to make coal power cheaper make solar backed clean energy expensive by levying higher rate of tax.	Trump retrograde policy will take US on path of doom.
@joncoopertweets @RitaThaQueen @ReverbPress Trump is top level misogynist so this kind of behaviour from him is expected.

@EdKrassen @Deemoney521 Let see whether Mitch Macconel promise of early votes on DACA take place or not as it may be plain and simple reneging from promise.	DACA is required to be legalised so as to make dreamers be given a fair &amp; reasonable deals.
@RepSwalwell @PhinneyJan @realDonaldTrump One year of Trump regime we saw.	1. Divisive policy on basis of religion, race &amp; native versus foreigner.	2. Healthcare expensive with repealing of existing insurance.	3. Reneging from Paris Accord.	4. Incompetent people getting top position.	So opt for democrat in Nov 18.
@RBReich Govt shutdown ensuring continuance of CHIP thus taking care of poor &amp; middle class sick children is welcome as children are future of society &amp; nation.	DACA though not resolved yet silver lining are there that it may be taken up for voting in near future.	Democrat emerged winner.
@Lawrence @NappingNanna Govt shutdown though blot on those involved in the averting it but if it ensured renewal of CHIP for 8 million children it turned out to be pleasant surprise.	Ironical such a crucial piece of welfare measures taking care of poor &amp; middle class sick children need such a scenario.

@NARAL Legislator of US has failed in its duty to keep government going smoothly by impending govt shutdown falling to the trap laid out by Trump himself.	A sad state of affairs with no solution in sight with Trump does not understand his prine duty to keep Govt functions smoothly.
@AKADonaldTrump @SherylR1968 Trump on completion of his first year of presidency has brought govt to shutdown. 	What a irony that president will be in Florida to celebrate it as that is what he stand for a divided society, legislature , executive and press &amp; media.	Trump will be remembered 4 his notoriety.
@chrislhayes @wiseoldwoman The fact of matter is even if president want it to be funded by Mexico how can you force it to pay as they are not agreed on Wall in first place at all.	This will be a wasteful expenditures and will not fullfill the very objectives for which it is being built.
@speculawyer @mama2fluffs @JudgeJeanine What is wrong and ill plaguing press &amp; media is amply reflected in Fox News reporting.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump has designed the whole game of govt shutdown so as to shift blame on Democrat for it and urging to let Senate have comfortable majority of GOP. 	He will be for rude shock in Nov 18 election as people will hit hardest to decimate entire rogue senator &amp; congressman.
@kaitlancollins Trump is going to his Florida home to play golf despite govt shutdown looming large.	Trump will be remembered as most callous inefficient and anti people president US has ever produced. 	His working hours is absymally low with his interest in matter of governance is low priority.
@chrislhayes @JustPlainDon First such instances as Trump is going to Florida home to play golf it is clear govt shutdown is inevitable designed by him and all the Senate sitting without recess is hogwash to dupe people of US &amp; GOP will be held responsible however hard they tried to shift blame to others.
@jimgeraghty @SassyKadiK Had it been so incriminating for Obama, Comey, Mueller and Fusion GPS Trump would have declassified it promptly also tweeting at Frenetic pace.	This is speculative piece of crap going to confuse the people of US &amp; cloud the clarity emerging out of Mueller probe.
@4everNeverTrump @zanygray1 NRA hand are soaked with the blood of innocent people in various cruel shootout. It is sufficient ground for banning it as except making profit it has no role.	Now creditable evidences surfaced about NRA role of money laundering to help Trump campaign so now right time to ban it.
@tedlieu @Taunia9 @realDonaldTrump Trump appointed official are not sure when axe will fall upon then.	John Kelly chief of white house staff is perhaps most saner &amp; reasonable are also likely to face axe by Trump. 	Trump tweeted Kelly promised to Hispanic congressman about wall being not feasible he will be sacked

@fawfulfan @JeffFlake People are not only sick of Trump but also GOP senators who is doing nothing to either reform or censure him.	Senator Flake is liar&amp; opportunist who want to encash resentment against Trump to grab president position.	But now to reverse all damage done blue wave will sweep.
@EdKrassen Two defining moments of US are abolition of slavery by Lincoln &amp; MLK movement to instil confidence dignity and patriotism in black to work with all US citizens in harmonious manner.	Trump is reversing all that with spreading poison of racism &amp; hate among US people.
@Hogan80Hogan @rudy_holton @thehill Boycott viewing of Union of state address of Trump so poor rating may make him understand simmering anger of people of US.	People of US are sick of his lies and falsehood and most of them are so angry that any moment it may burst out in to massive civil disobedience movement.
@funder @wiwa1953 The facts is very clear that on DACA a bipartisan proposal was arrived at &amp; put up to Trump who refused to accept it.	Yes he has devious design of not accepting any bipartisan proposal &amp; them blame Democrat for deportation of Immigrants.
@krassenstein Senate and Congress are both lopsided &amp; must be represented by black women immigrant and man/women who respect rule of law democracy and constitution. 	Trump current senators congressman are flouting with impunity the democracy &amp; constitution. They lack imagination innovation.
@CNN @djtruskiespy Even if Trump is not mentally unstable but he is worst of all with dangerous design of causing civil war by sowing seed of division on race religion and native versus foreigner criteria as each has explosive potential to blow any nation apart.	On sheer merit he should go.
@MikeRock09 @Art_Chicken @FoxNews Fox News are doing so crudely that I doubt it will be able to brainwash even uneducated one. My point is you can't underestimate the intelligence of common people.	They are watching with horror &amp; indignation how Trump is destroying US.
@kylegriffin1 @TrumpsareNazis Trump should auction WH &amp; convert Mar-a-Lago residence as official residence charging rent from US Govt.	This makes perfect business sense.	Putin may purchase WH take it on rent for winter resort. Trump has already sold soul of US to Putin &amp; deal will be concluded by selling WH.
@krassenstein Trump was fortunate that his grandfather was allowed to immigrate to US and settle down so that you are enjoying fruit of power in spite of not deserving it.	Now you are blocking all genuine immigration and failed to provide any solution to DACA despite bipartisan proposal to you
@brycetache GOP senators has turned corrupt &amp; know Trump is best bet for them to give personal benefits to them in their business or others area which they can't imagine from other presidents of US.	GOP senators will turn wealthy expand their assets domestically or off shore at nation costs.

@MrDane1982 @mama2fluffs Trump will be perhaps first president of US whose union address is under threat of boycott.	Trump is going to be unique president to have dubious distinction of many first in notoriety.
@johncusack There is only lot of hue &amp; cry in social &amp; print media and absolutely no action on ground for removal of Trump. 	At least by now the impeachment proceedings should have been started or pressure should have been built to force him to resign. Even no action on invoking 25 amendment
@SenSanders @suzyquetexas GOP know that they will be ousted in Nov 18 election with Democrat will have comfortable majority in both Senate Congress.	Before leaving they are doing all negative thing to destroy USA so that later on Democrat may find it difficult to reverse.	Trump will have tough time ahead.
@krassenstein @suzyquetexas If Mueller come with indictment of Trump Russian collusion with reflecting many of Russian oligarchs played their dubious roles it will be death knell in US Russia relationship.
@EdKrassen Trump is ironically putting America last on US allies agenda.	He has done impossible task of making US dependable ally UK as where Trump is most hated &amp; not welcome therein.	NATO is at crossroad courtesy Trump who singlehandedly made it directionless &amp; going to die.

Now Mueller has tough tasks ahead to build watertight cases against this huge lot of seditious &amp; treasonous monster. But he will succeed.
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics Trump obessesion with Hillary &amp; Obama is assuming the promotion of absurdity.	He know that in order to divert attention from his abject failure in global &amp; domestically fronts he needs few big names to elicit desired response.	However people of US is seeing through his blame game
@chelseahandler @Joni_Looking Providing health insurance to poor &amp; low income people ensures their rise to upper socioeconomic ladder.	In Trump &amp; GOP era gap between poor &amp; rich will widen to such a extent that few % of rich will have all money &amp; asset.	This may further lead to social dissension &amp; poverty.
@ProudResister @CarleyJCo @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Whatever little doubt were left has been reinforced by GPS fusion transcript and now Mueller has creditable circumstances &amp; ground to build his watertight case against seditious &amp; treasonous Trump &amp; his campaign committee along with complicit senator congressman of GOP.
@EdKrassen Entire landscape of Mueller probe is finding new grounds as eagerness of GOP are getting more &amp; more pronounced to obstruct Mueller probe.	If not curbed it is sure shot recipe for doom.	Evidence indicate Trump &amp; his campaign committee &amp; GOP are complicit in Russian collusion.

@lessonlisa @flirtysaying Trump is doing all those things but yet to be ousted from presidency.

@PalmerReport @CharlotteRawl12 Trump is genius as he did what all previous presidents of US never did that is winning election with foreign support ,money hacking email ,money laundering &amp; support from Russians bots. 	His further genius charecter is reflected on trying to shoot messenger Steele through others.
@kylegriffin1 Trump has given incriminating evidences against himself by ranting he is stable smart genius this tweet is going to haunt him 4 long time.	Already it has become punchline of his opposing group with health professionals view of almost bordering on mental illness is doing around.
@davidaxelrod @LillyPaloma1980 @CNNSotu @POTUS Miller defence at CNN will only precipitate social media war pursuing the possibility of invoking 25th Amendment will be more plausible. 	Further executive branch already reeling under vacuum of leadership will paralyses the Govt and atmosphere will be vitiated to great extent.
@realDonaldTrump @AmericanVoterUS Trump now understand book of Wolff is great threat as it will be quoted extensively with building adverse public opinion against him.	Mentally unstable, his behavioural traits , collusion with Putin, sexual assault cases and his blackmailing tactics will be pursued vigorously.
@CNNPolitics That is not enough as only concuring with view Trump is unfit to be president will not do good. The implications of unfit president ruling are grave &amp; serious for national interest. 	So legislators must either force Trump to resign or impeach him or invoke amendments 25.
@TomthunkitsMind Trump several sexual assault cases which every head of state position untenable is still clinging to his position. 	It is now being ignored and this is not good for gender equality &amp; justice.	Let there be financial legal assistance to all victims to take it to logical conclusion.
@krassenstein @dixiejm1 Yes that is highly probable.	1. Trump is sitting over sanction to Russian. 	2. Trump is obstructing Mueller probe in to Russian collusion in US election.	3. Trump campaign committee members who was sacked or resigned indicate that.	4. Vide money laundering Trump got Russian money
@thomaskaine5 @smirnoffpopov @LindseyGrahamSC This is what actually happened. Graham has been opposing tooth &amp; nail Trump so what happened to force him to reverse gear.

@EdKrassen @dixiejm1 GOP several members complicity in Russia collusion is very much evident. Though investigation is directed towards Trump &amp; campaign committee yet some legislators of GOP is leaving no stoned unturned to Derail the same and basically indulging in the obstruction of justice.
@BettyBowers @ScottZPinkRose I really don't know is it effort to divert attention from Mueller probe or Trump troll.	Anyhow if Clinton Foundation has indulged in corruption it should be investigated &amp; taken to logical conclusion.

@ananavarro @Me78120345 @realDonaldTrump Mental unstable person never accept that he is mad and boasts him to be rational.	Trump has turned US in to the cauldron of political strife, racial tension, political instability with fear insecurity and tension are vibrating in air.	Either impeache him or force him to resign.
@adamcbest @magichands34 Graham is being blackmailed by Trump and he should be courageous enough to call Trump bluff and even if some damning thing come out people will forgive him	Though Trump may not expose him but even if he then he will be loser.
@mattyglesias Trump shit on smart genius is now really reflecting his mental unstability at last stage with his sociopathic psychopathic personality is making it so complicated that before going he will either escalate nuke war or cause civil war in US or take mother of some reckless action.

@EdKrassen Steve Bannon change of stance on Mueller probe is perhaps best sum up as result of Mueller effort to pursue thread of investigation relentlessly and now linking up all angles to come to conclusion. 	Bannon know that indictment odd Trump &amp; his campaign team is inevitable.

@funder @JasonKander Jason Kander was right on the track as voter Fraud commission was ill conceived and Trump excepted it to come up with evidences which was not existing. This effort by Trump drew blank and once again exposing his lies &amp; falsehood so Trump had no option to disband commission.

@krassenstein Trump allies are up to their racial trick as they are hinting their supremacist neo nazies KKK supporters to come to their rescue.	Attacking Mueller grand jury is itself amount to obstructing the justice when probe is ongoing. 	It is clear that Mueller probe is creating flutter.
@krassenstein Steve Bannon know sedition &amp; treason charges against Trump &amp; his campaign team is legally tenable &amp; indictment will follow so he is trying to distance himself. Bannon is complicit as he know that emails of campaigning team currently under scrutiny of Mueller will seal their fate.

@funder @cmpeacefully @realDonaldTrump Trump desire is to plunge US in to nuclear war as he is sociopathic psychopathic personality and pressing nuke button will satisfy his narcissistic behaviour.

@TomthunkitsMind @senorrinhatch What the hell Senator Orrin Hatch is talking about.	While they are not renewing CHIP a welfare issue as GOP is letting it's lapse and expecting poor children to help themselves which is so cruel.	Poor and middle class children will languish if suffers from deadly diseases.

@tribelaw @JoshuaMatz8 Law is equal for everybody so if charges of treason &amp; sedition is proved through Mueller indictment then Senate will have to bow to the evidences and they can't redefine it. The applicable definition at time of impeachment will prevail not what Senate interpret.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Only way out in 2018 to thrown Trump out of presidency is eruption of protest in every nook and corner of US so that GOP will desist from helping Trump which they are doing in most unreasonable &amp; unethical manner.	They will be afraid to lose their seats and forthcoming election.
@funder @StormResist @SpeakerRyan There is attempts on part of GOP to attack Mueller without any valid ground that is because they are complicit in someway in Russian collusion in US election. 	Paul Ryan support for Devin Nunes indicate more hanky panky business going on and they all are compromising Democracy.
@kfhall0852 Trump is poor in Golf and personality like him with such a inherent flaws &amp; faulting bordering at mental instability can't be good in anything.
@krassenstein Trump lawyers are right by telling him to desist from firing Mueller as this will have implications ousting him from presidency. Trump want to pardon his cronies who are now seriously heading to indictment &amp; prosecution. But if he does it a clear case of conflict of interest.
