@realDonaldTrump #Realestate transactions are complicated and convoluted by nature and have no bearing on the Presidency. Facts not reported accurately by the #FakeNews are as follows; 4.2 growth, market at 25,000, unemployment 3.7 (lowest black unemployment), #prisonreform and #securedborders !
@Alyssa_Milano #AlyssaMilano , just as important to expand and fight for #WomensRights and #GayRights we must also be cognizant of #heterosexualrights and #MaleRights as well. I can’t see how one can exist without the other. Supporting male rights and heterosexual rights is just as important!

@Janefonda Jane, it’s Fabulous that we are expanding the scope of treatment for the #LGBTQ community. Are we now attempting to change the straight male stereotype and throw masculinity out the window. I think preserving #heterosexualrights and the masculinity of men is just as important!
@sharonstone @RepCummings The concern to preserve the integrity of the attorney client privilege is paramount to our legal system. Cohen obviously had no problem violating this.
