@kkrieger_btv @realDonaldTrump As a good Democrat, you must be amiss in not agreeing with Clinton and Obama when they stated that we should not allow illegals in.

@kkrieger_btv @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding???!!! My grandparents came to the US on ships like this, and they entered legally. I'm able to go to the Ellis Island archives and see the actual documents that they signed. Trump would have welcomed them!
