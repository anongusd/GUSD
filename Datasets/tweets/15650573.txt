.@ChrisWallace went heavy policy, no drama.  By far the winner of tonight by giving voters more to work with than they had before.
Trump's 1st 30 minutes on policy very strong- makes the argument that more policy, less drama, would have been very effective.
Trump, speaking over Clinton, "Such a nasty woman."  Not helping win over women voters.
@trapster1977 Areyarite??
Clinton response to Trump's answer on not accepting election results:  "That's horrifying."
*Will you accept the results of the election?*  Donald Trump:  "I will look at it at the time."
Trump interrupts his own best moment, "Why won't you give back the money" from Quatar to add, "The people of Haiti hate the Clintons."
Chris Wallace is just making this look easy.
Trump: "Nobody respects women more than I do."  The audience snickers.
Trump on the women accusing him:  "They get their 10 minutes of fame.  It was all fiction.  It was lies."
Trump denies groping allegations, again:  "Those people, I don't know those people."
Oh, and Clinton goes in on the gift from Trump's dad ("No") and Alicia Machado ("give me a break.")
Clinton:  "There's only one of us on this stage that has shipped jobs to Mexico and it's Dona;d, who has shipped jobs to 12 countries."
Trump, 6/16/16: "It could very well be that Japan will have to protect themselves...maybe they’ll use nuclear, maybe they won’t.”
Trump to Clinton, really:  "You're the puppet!  You're the puppet!"
And again:  "I don't know Putin, he says nice things about me."
Clinton says Trump "choked."  Can he keep it together??
#BadHombres
Trump on immigration:  "We have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out."
Truth--&gt; https://t.co/aosggieFUb
Chris Wallace out of the gate with SCOTUS, abortion &amp; immigration.  Substance lives!
Clinton on late-term abortion:  "I do not think the U.S. government should be involved in those most personal of decision."
Clinton:  I will defend Roe v. Wade, I will defend Planned Parenthood.  We have come too far.
Trump won't say if he wants Roe v. Wade overturned: "I am putting pro-life justices on the Court."
7:45 am, people, get your coffee &amp; be in the car by then! https://t.co/6cXVA2SaHM
Trump says SCOTUS "is what it's all about." That's true for many conservatives who can articulate no other reason to vote for him.
Trump spend 1st part of his SCOTUS answer scolding #RBG for speaking out against him.
On SCOTUS-- Clinton says her noms won't reverse marriage equality, won't reverse Roe v. Wade, will "stand up to the powerful."

@trapster1977 Not so offensive in retrospect.  Poor Mittens!

Trump, off promoter, "How many Hispanic Americans do we have here tonight?  One!  At least one!"
Trump says he'll help the inner cities:  "It's like a passion of mine."
Trump says he'd take 30% off the price of the speakers in Charlotte, which also seem broken.  "Who the hell runs this place?"
Apparent Trump ref to @SpeakerRyan: "A couple of our leaders, it's not working out for them so well."
Trump says it's a bum teleprompter, won't pay for it tomorrow.
Trump physically dismantles his teleprompter and throws it to the side.  Crowd goes wild.
Uh oh:  Trump in Charlotte says his teleprompter is broken:  "It's ok, I like it better without a teleprompter!"

Transcript of the First Debate https://t.co/TYJWSiaWbC
Why debate prep matters: Trump never said the words "deplorables" "Benghazi" or "email," Clinton's biggest weaknesses.
Things Clinton accused Trump of in debate, which Trump ended up bragging about: Not paying taxes, stiffing contractors, pushing birtherism,

Trump:  "In Palm Beach, Fla., tough community."
RT @costareports: "Just listen to what you heard."	"Crazy."		HRC isn't hiding her mockery/distate for GOP nominee.
Trump doesn't deny birther effort:	"I was the one who got him to produce the birth certificate and I think I did a good job."
Full eye roll from Trump when Clinton says she prepared for both the debate and the presidency.
Bucking some in #GOP, Trump says people on no-fly list shouldn't be able to buy guns.
It's like Hillary Clinton is debating a blow torch.
Trump in two sentences:  "We need law and order.  If we don't have it, we don't have a country."
Trump follows up to say contractors did get paid, but he filed bankruptcy because "I was taking advantage of the laws of the nation."
Clinton accuses Trump of stiffing a contractor.  Trump doesn't deny.  "Maybe he didn't do a good job."
Clinton says Trump hasn't paid federal taxes for many years, Trump says "It would be squandered, too."
"I have a tremendous income."
RT @AustinHunt: wow. https://t.co/2PQOgJKkvB
Clinton:  "By the end of the debate, I'm going to be blamed for everything."  Trump:  "Why not??"

HRC’s mention of a women being nominated gets by far the biggest applause of the night.  “Without glass ceilings, the sky’s the limit.”
Hillary Clinton, 23 years after 1st becoming FLOTUS: “I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America.”
Hillary Clinton hitting Trump on his “I alone can fix it” line from his own convention speech.

RT @rollcall: What If Joe Biden Had Run? https://t.co/uYI9qUFfZa @1PatriciaMurphy on the scene at #DNCinPHL https://t.co/nCNz6L2GSN
The baton is passed:  “Tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me.”
Barack Obama describes the values, strength &amp; exceptionalism of America.  “It’s been you, the American people,” who have given him strength.
Barack Obama:  “Democracy isn’t about ‘yes he will,’ it’s about ‘yes, we can.’”
RT @BresPolitico: Obama tying all the threads together inside Dem Party (except trade)
Obama: “The American dream is something no wall will ever contain.”
Obama on Trump:  “We don’t looked to be ruled.”
Voice from the crowd to Obama:  “Four more years!”
Obama calls Clinton “a mother and a grandmother who would do anything for our children’s future” &amp; the next POTUS.
Obama calls the R convention, “The fanning of blame and anger and resentment and hate.  And that is not the America I know.”
Barack Obama: “I am more optimistic about the future of America than ever before.  How could I not be after all we’ve achieved together?”
Obama’s still got the magic with his Democrats- chants of “Yes we can!” ring out and take them all back to simpler times.
@ToddBoulanger OMG- why are you trolling me on Twitter when you can just troll me on my very own email? Most people don’t get the chance!
Michael Bloomberg’s speech shows he probs would have been a terrible candidate for president.  Message fine, delivery not so hot.
More Biden hammering Trump:  “We are America, second to none, and we OWN the finish line.”
Joe Biden describes Trump as uniquely unqualified for the presidency.  “We simply cannot let that happen as Americans.”
More Biden on the attack,  “He has no clue about what makes America great.  Actually, he has no clue, period.”  Crowd chants, “Not a clue!”
Biden on Trump:  “He’s tryng to tell us he cares ahout the middle class?  Give me a break.  That’s a bunch of malarky!”
“The world breaks us all and, afterward, many are strong at the broken places.”
Biden’s voice cracks when he talks about his late son, Beau, and quotes Hemingway:
Biden’s speech is essentially his goodbye to Democratic politics.  There won’t be another run again.
Joe Biden played onto the DNC stage to the Rocky theme song.  The crowd goes wild.
