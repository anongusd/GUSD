@RKJ65 @mschlapp @jack @Twitter At the very least you he is detached from reality. The fact that any of the GOP could get up at CPAC and speak with a straight face ESPECIALLY after the week many of us witnessed--is truly disturbing. You have to know that some of the facts that have come out are just the start.
That decision was made in 1973.
Roe v. Wade was a landmark decision made in the US Supreme Court where abortion became legal. The onus is on the doctor that botched the abortion. Any lawyer and former prosecutor knows that.
@itsJeffTiedrich And I just ate....
@CherylBlueWave @TheMMeltdown It's beyond absurd, it's disgusting, and a travesty that they would present the pro-choice issue in this way.
https://t.co/zfp2eKaUz4
@joncoopertweets Absolutely.
@cathyob1 @realDonaldTrump Yeah. I hope they get him on the Emoluments Clause. So much and so little time....
@ObamaDiditBest @wvjoe911 @wsbtv And you would think he'd go into hiding after the past week bc of those facts and instead he goes on Hannity?
@thomaskaine5 OH, Yeah!
@thomaskaine5 Joe Biden hasn't made an announcement yet that he is even running. Kamala Harris is running for POTUS 2020. It will be interesting to see how it all shakes out.
@TomthunkitsMind I really believe that justice for us all will eventually come from SDNY.

@sianoresist And Oprah
@RWPUSA Exactly. I do believe though if Joe Biden alone was running against Trump, he'd win in a NY minute. Trump created such a polarization that it has become all too important for each voter to focus on the sensibilities that meet their needs.
@dr24060 @Sarah_SKG_1983 @maydaymindy9 But I guess they know no shame in raising kids where one or both of their parents could become convicted felons.
@dr24060 @Sarah_SKG_1983 @maydaymindy9 The mind boggling thing as they both had their own mega bucks. Why would one move into the WH and break laws.
@NBCPolitics Past videos
The importance of all news today is that maybe there will be more public scrutiny so the wrong politician doesn't get to office or remain in office.
@maggieNYT @Wolfell3 @ChrisCuomo Let's hope that never happens. #DemWave2020#KamalaHarris2020
It still amazes me that members of the GOP like to point out that Cohen had committed crimes, when that is WHY he was at the Oversight Committee to begin with. Cohen's and other evidence will prove the guilt on Trump and his family. They aren't mutually exclusive.
@YesWeCan4Us @B52Malmet @DoyleMcManus I do think Joe Biden's comment last night about V.P. Pence being nice not only cost him the LGBTQ community vote, but those of us that support them.
@RandyResist @BoboSonata And, those are only the ones Cohen directly implicated Trump in. Look at the possible ones we don't even know about yet.
@TPThompson2 Yes. It's been a nagging suspicion for me for more than two years.
@armandodkos Absolutely. Barack Obama and Trump won the same Swing States. Barack Obama, by a much larger margin of Electoral College votes-- Hence HRC got robbed.
@missmayn @Nikluk That's why there has to be Amendments made to the Constitution.
@TheGoodGodAbove @JesseSmithBooks Every vote matters--it's to not assume anything.
#BlueWave2020

@shuboogie @emrazz Don't they have porn sites for his kind of antics?
It was stunning to see Jr. during Cohen's testimony tweet in real-time juvenile statements b/c of the actual evidence that may bring him to a Committee hearing in the future.
GOP is already running ads in key battleground states and getting mega donations for them.
IF you have decided on your candidate yet-- donate as soon as you can. There is nothing too small or big for those who can afford it. The urgency is b/c if you feel passionate about a candidate making it to primary....

Rep. Jim Jordan, You are a young Congressman. If you want to be on the right side of history--remember millions of people will be watching you on TV and repeating what they heard you say in the "Twitterverse."
@CBLifeCoach1 GOP thinks if they call Cohen a liar enough b"cuz he lied to the FBI, people in general won't realize he'll be absolutely telling the truth now. What does he have to lose?

@orangeseahorse You are so correct. I've done some Ancestry and DNA search myself and find it so fascinating. The context was photos of many of the players indicted or plea deals in the Russian investigation. I believe it was 2014 photo--before the campaign even started in 2015.

Gillibrand is the only that has had the guts to speak out on this issue. ( If there has been others-forgive me.) I'm not saying she's my candidate right now- I'm just sayin'
His mantra is "free education." Other candidates need to address this issue. I'll support the one who tries to talk to everyone, because this is still the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
@davidhogg111 I'm dazed and confused
I think if members of the GOP actually thought about LEGACY, they wouldn't do and say some of the crazy things they do.
I saw a young woman crying @ the Women's March to Elizabeth Warren about the fact that she didn't vote at all. Like so many people who couldn't have imagined DJT could have won.
The danger is in not voting because your candidate didn't make it through primary. That's just one of the ways the GOP wins the office.

@NicolleDWallace  As a Middle- Class wage earner w/ promotions to mgmt., salary is proportional to the min. wage. If the 1% had got a 5%-7% less tax break &amp; had increased the min. wage.....
@NicolleDWallace First of all I have to say I love your show. But I disagree with conversation that was had on Morning Joe this morning. I liked where Joe was headed in the conversation, because you could talk a week on the subject!
@HuevosDeChivo WOW!
I don't believe Sean Hannity is a puppet for the Prez. I do believe Sean Hannity became very wealthy with a couple of his shows &amp; HUGE microphones, that can sway voters to say the least. His hypocrisy is unbelievable on so many levels.
@SherriBeegle Can we take out the word "hate?" The point is many Conservatives don't approve of the gay lifestyle, so I really don't understand the point.
@ChocoHarveyMilk @GOP @TaggartRehnn Together as all Americans were stronger in numbers &amp; the will to protect our freedoms. I've only been on twitter a month &amp; I hear your voices loud &amp; strong. So does Congress. If not they'll hear us at the voting polls.
@DrTomMartinPhD @KathyMorse0914 It is a travesty.
@TheAlanvargas When I read a few weeks ago about a Marine who did three tours of Aphghanistan &amp; got rid his of AR-15. He &amp; other military say they don't even work for the war--certainly not meant for civilians. That's good enough for me.

I used to grieve--becaused that is the way I'm wired. I mean 24/7 kind of grieving--tears streaming down my face, every news broadcast. Then I decided to get on Twitter &amp; be one of the many get-out-the-vote message.
@MTP I always feel like I'm missing something as Short, &amp; the WH pretty much on a daily basis--believes they can make a point by saying there is no collusion so the probe should end. Isn't that pretty mush a moot point. The probe is not complete!
That's inexpensive!

@SunflowerSoul71 Couldn't agree more--I love him as a human being. But we just can't risk "spoilers" including Johnson &amp; Stein anymore. I know people have the right and want to vote on principle--I've done it in the past--but that was when there were landslide victories.

So sorry--Hrs. later I realize I meant to say young &amp; has wisdom. Wisdom usually comes from age. I often say @ home when who is so articulate they are 20 going on 40.

It's rich when a U.N. ambassador from a communist county is making a point to a nation of DEMOCRACY. Where is Nikki Haley &amp; the Congressional Armed Services Committee?
Apparently President Trump didn't consult your commitee &amp; Nikki Haley.
I never speak in facts--never hyperbole--especially 10 words or less. If you miss a word or two--which most peopke do in that statement you'll miss my point. I'm a political "junky." So the history is only about context &amp; perspective.

@Emma4Change I so admire you and all of your friends--which is now half the world. I wish I had half of your self confidence, courage, strength, and courage when I was your age. I just wish you didn't have to show it under these circumstances. #MarchForOurLives
