2/ It's really an incredible story. 22 Feb '44, the "Mi Amigo" B-17 Flying Fortress, desperate to land after being shot by Nazis over Denmark, makes it to Sheffield. The pilot realizes their best chance of survival is to crash land in a park -- only problem is the children there.

Thread from last night about the judge‚Äôs ruling that DOJ broke the law in the Epstein plea deal ‚Äî https://t.co/WultkhDNLk
33/ Why did Epstein get such a cozy deal? And even if one disagrees with Judge Marra and sides with then-US Attorney Acosta's office that they didn't HAVE to let the victims know -- why DIDN'T they? Why bend over backwards for a pedophile over the rights of his victims?
32/You can read the whole document here, courtesy @Buzzfeed		https://t.co/7YDAHVPNIk
31/ The judge goes on to say the US Attorney's office CONCEALED the NPA and "mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility. When the Government gives information to victims, it cannot be misleading."
30/"..even after the Government entered into the NPA. At a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners that it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein."
29/ The judge: "it is undisputed that the Government entered into a NPA with Epstein without conferring with Petitioners during its negotiation and signing. Instead, the Government sent letters to the victims requesting their 'patience' with the investigation ...
28/ July 9, 2008, U.S. Attorney Acosta's Office "sent victim notification letters to Jane Doe 1" and other victims of Epstein. The notification "did not provide the full terms of the NPA." 		You get the point by now, I assume.
27/ June 30, 2008, Epstein enters a guilty plea to "violations of Florida statutes forbidding the solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution.‚Äù Jane Doe 1 thought the US Attorney was still investigating and pursuing her case.
26/ Jane Doe 1 still believed "the Government would contact her before reaching any final resolution" and "she wanted to be consulted by prosecutors before any resolution."
25/ Jan 08, Epstein "sought higher level review" within DOJ for his deal. 		The FBI tells Jane Doe 1 &amp; Jane Doe 2 the "case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.‚Äù ...
24/ 11/30/07, Acosta writes to Epstein atty Ken Starr: ‚ÄúI am directing our prosecutors not to issue victim notification letters until this Friday at 5 p.m., to provide you with time to review these options with your client.‚Äù 		Ultimately NO letters to victims were sent in Dec 07
23/ This was not acceptable to Epstein's attorneys. 11/29/07, they sent a letter to Acosta "objecting to the proposed victim notification letter, stating that it is inappropriate for any letter to be sent to the victims before Epstein entered his plea or had been sentenced."
22/ The proposed letter noted that because Epstein‚Äôs plea of guilty to state charges was ‚Äúpart of the resolution of the federal investigation,‚Äù the victims were ‚Äúentitled to be present and to make a statement under oath at the state sentencing.‚Äù
21/ At the end of November, the Assistant US Attorney prepares a letter to send the victims noting their "statutory obligation to notify the victims about Epstein‚Äôs plea to state charges that was part of the NPA"
20/ Jane Doe 1 says they didn't explain the NPA was signed. Her "understanding was that the federal investigation would continue."
19/ Epstein agreed to plead guilty to state charges, and FBI agents tell Jane Doe 1 in Oct 2007 "that Epstein would plead guilty to state charges, he would be required to register as a sex offender for life, and he had made certain concessions related to the payment of damages."
18/ Epstein attorney thanks Acosta for their October 12 meeting "in which you...assured me that your Office would not...contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter.‚Äù
17/ Epstein's attorney tells Acosta that the attorney rep for the victims be instructed that ‚Äú[t]he details regarding the United States‚Äôs investigation of this matter and its resolution with Mr. Epstein is confidential. You may not make public statements regarding this matter.‚Äù
16/ Epstein's attorney to Acosta, 10/10/07: ‚ÄúNeither federal agents nor anyone from your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case..."
15/ "...if they proceed outside the Terms of the plea agreement. (Sorry ‚Äì I just	have a bias against plaintiffs‚Äô attorneys.) One nice thing about Bert is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case.‚Äù
14/ 9/25/07, the line prosecutor writes to Epstein's attorney regarding three attorneys who might represent the victims: "I have concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that THEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage)...
13/ The line prosecutor writes to the Epstein attorneys about how to achieve something ‚ÄúOn an ‚Äòavoid the press‚Äô note"... filing something in "District Court in Miami, which will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.‚Äù 		???
12/ Not only that -- but "Epstein‚Äôs counsel was aware that the Office was deliberately keeping the NPA secret from the victims and, indeed, had sought assurances to that effect." 		Acosta's US Attorney's office, working with the accused, against the rights of the victims.
11/ Judge Mara: "From the time the FBI began investigating Epstein until September 24, 2007‚Äîwhen the NPA was concluded‚Äîthe Office never conferred with the victims about a NPA or told the victims that such an agreement was under consideration."
10/ US Attorney Acosta's office and Epstein's attorneys entered into a non-prosecution agreement - NPA - on Sept 24, 2007 "whereby the	United States would defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida." Did Acosta's office inform the victims? ...
9/ Jane Doe 2 received her CVRA victim notification letter on or about August 11. At the time she was being represented by an attorney Epstein was paying for.
8/ On or about June 7, 2007, the FBI delivered to Jane Doe 1 the standard CVRA victim notification letter promising DOJ would make its ‚Äúbest efforts‚Äù to protect those rights, Jane Doe 1 "believed that the Government would protect those rights," the judge wrote.
7. ...specifically rights as established in the Crime Victims‚Äô Rights Act, including "the right to be heard in public court proceedings relating to...acceptance of a plea bargain" and "the right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain"		https://t.co/DC2Yme5HoA
6/ From Jan-Sept 2007, discussions took place between the office of the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida -- Alex Acosta -- &amp; Epstein's attorneys. At that time, Acosta's office was also informing the victims of Epstein's crimes of their rights...
5/ In 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department "received a complaint	from the parents of a 14 year old girl about her sexual abuse by Jeffery Epstein." PBPD found "20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who were sexually abused by Epstein." FBI began investigating as well.
4/ "Epstein and his co-conspirators knowingly traveled in interstate and international commerce to sexually abuse Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2 and others...	Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually..."
3/ Judge Kenneth Mara presents these facts: "From between about 1999 and 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls, including Petitioners Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2..."
2/ First off, again, full credit to the amazing reporting by @jkbjournalist of the @MiamiHerald for "How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime"...worth a read:		https://t.co/h9hSTNCN2X

@AxelLycan @DavidKlion i deny the entire thing. unequivocally. all of it.
@DavidKlion We didn't deny it at the time because we feared bringing your lie more attention and we hoped you would come to your senses and stop spreading lies. *For your own reputation's sake, if for no other reason.*
@DavidKlion Am I supposed to be grateful? You've spent weeks trying to spread what you acknowledge is a "thinly-sourced rumor" you spread to commit "mischief." Is this what you consider to be journalism? I sincerely hope no one is ever so reckless about you.		https://t.co/8WgWKV6SDp
@DavidKlion It's a lie. I don't care if you perceive your cause to be righteous. You're spreading a lie.  Stop spreading lies. It's not that complicated a concept.
@DavidKlion It's not an unorthodox way to air information. It's a "zero standards" way to smear someone on twitter. If you have any decency you will delete all the tweets in which you make this false claim.
@DavidKlion You were told this by someone at CNN? That's an interesting claim since you once called it a "thinly-sourced rumor" you spread to commit "mischief." 		https://t.co/8WgWKV6SDp
@DavidKlion This is you, your own words, describing how unreliable this information is. 		https://t.co/8WgWKV6SDp
@DavidKlion Your tweet is a lie. Everything about it. I deny it unequivocally. You yourself have described it as a "thinly-sourced rumor" you spread to commit "mischief." That's not journalism, David. It's a disgrace.
@Jilly379 @DavidKlion I was implying no such thing. I've shared different folks' analyses, running the gamut.
@DavidKlion i havent un-RTed it. it's still there. 		And that other tweet is a blatant lie. You've already referred to it as a "thinly-sourced rumor" you tweeted to commit "mischief," which is the opposite of journalism. Stop spreading lies about me on twitter.
