@mountains_ @Some_Mexican_Ok @LCagepm @rfpcrawford @PuestoLoco @GOP @KellyannePolls I don't disagree but most conservatives and some liberals are strictly against having to pay for others' drug habits (or any type of socialized medicine.) it's hard sell, even if they deal with drug abuse within their own families. Legalizing ibogaine treatment is the ONLY cure.

@batesdavidp @Suzdee1 @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump I live in Sandy Springs and commute there.
@batesdavidp @Suzdee1 @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump Here's a few articles that describe what I'm talking about. Maybe I misread about it being in current filings but you get the idea (from non-partisan publications)	https://t.co/2mRZosnQw1	https://t.co/oMjKat0vdR
@batesdavidp @Suzdee1 @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump It's in court filings!
@batesdavidp @Suzdee1 @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump There's an established quid pro quo between Deripaska and Manafort: Manafort "works" off his debt by providing details regarding the campaign/administration. In addition the RNC platform was changed re: Ukraine in return for election help. It will be made clear in the report.
@batesdavidp @Suzdee1 @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump Rosenstein is still heading the investigation and the DOJ is still indicting people. Does that answer the question or can you be more specific in your inquiry? BTW I appreciate that you are respectful in your arguments and not resorting to ad hominem attacks. That's why I respond
@batesdavidp @sportsfan502 @BlueGuitarPick @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump Do you know me? Who said that I've ever been arrested? It's obvious that you've never taken a criminal justice course nor anything similar so I started with the low hanging fruit. I work in Gwinnett County btw so we are practically neighbors.
@sportsfan502 @BlueGuitarPick @batesdavidp @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump Have you ever been arrested? Investigations are launched to COLLECT EVIDENCE; all that is needed to start one is probable cause.
@batesdavidp @Spinoff55 @BlueGuitarPick @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump "Collusion" is not a criminal statute so that will never be charged but "conspiracy to aid and abet computer crimes" is and WILL be charged. There are (more than likely) sealed indictments on Roger Stone and Don, Jr. that will be unsealed this year.
@sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump That's a stretch but even if what they did was illegal, it will come to light as well. That doesn't excuse this administration's crimes. They didn't even use the information during the election so it surely had no impact on the results.
@batesdavidp @Suzdee1 @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump Democratic investigation, started by the Trump DOJ by a Trump appointee?
@batesdavidp @Spinoff55 @BlueGuitarPick @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump You are spinning in circles. There have been indictments, they just have not reached the top as of yet. Whitewater took 9 years to complete and this investigation is MUCH larger in scope.
@batesdavidp @DivDougNation @sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump Please post the links to all of the leaks that came out prior to Manafort, Flynn, etc indictments. Making assumptions based on your feelings is not a very accurate way to interpret an investigation. Btw, how much money did Benghazi and the email investigations cost? No outrage?
@sportsfan502 @amykhris @mmpadellan @TomQuijote @realDonaldTrump I will excuse your ignorance on the subject of Special Counsels/investigators as you are still in HS and have limited frame of reference. Google "length of special counsel investigations" and tell me what you uncover. For example, Whitewater took like 9 years to complete.

@drsanjaygupta The next study that you should undertake is with Ibogaine for opiate treatment. Talk to Dr. Sola at Clear Sky Ibogaine for more information. As someone who is a former patient I can 100% vouch for the effectiveness, which is miles beyond what cannabis can help with.
@scanners1111 @GroffMarya @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @dherman001 Again, contracts can be VERBAL, as long as there are terms (counsel, attorney client privilege, etc) and consideration (some form of payment.) Cohen's lawyer gave up his name, with his client UNDER OATH IN FEDERAL COURT! Use common sense, please.
@scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @dherman001 What am i reading? There are dozens of citations on that page. You do realize that a "contract" can be verbal, correct? The exchanging of the $10 is strictly procedural and represents a retainer/verbal contract. Who's the dumbass?

@boomer_bruner @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @dherman001 It *obviously* was paid strictly so that they could claim that the conversations between them were "privileged" and Cohen was more of a fixer than an attorney, hence his 3 clients.
@dherman001 @albedobell @justwongirl @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @DanRather Good retort there, "Ben." Happy trolling.
@albedobell @justwongirl @dherman001 @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @DanRather I agree and respect your news sources. I like Shep Smith and Fowler but DESPISE Hannity and Carlson. Those 2 + Ingraham are what is wrong with Fox News.
@BklynBirny @justwongirl @dherman001 @GroffMarya @Mikel_Jollett Dude you can't possibly have ANY idea which politics I "like" based on a couple of tweets comparing Rather to Hannity.  I "like" the truth and, if it's between those 2, I would trust Rather over Hannity every time. That doesn't mean that I agree with him absolutely, however.
@albedobell @justwongirl @dherman001 @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @DanRather OK, I'm not challenging your logic. Who do YOU turn to for CREDIBLE/FACTUAL news? You didn't try to defend Hannity so I'm thinking that Fox is no better, in your eyes.
@albedobell @justwongirl @dherman001 @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @DanRather I'm not debating that Dan Rather has some dubious baggage but to compare him to Hannity in ANY way is a disservice to free-thinkers everywhere. I didn't bring Rather up, either.
@justwongirl @dherman001 @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount Most journalists get stories completely wrong, from time to time, for a myriad of reasons. It's if/how they correct the record that's important. Fox rarely offers corrections, which plays into why they don't hold a news license.
@justwongirl @dherman001 @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount That's an EXTREMELY simplistic view on what happened. He ran with a story without authenticating documents and then willingly stepped down. Meanwhile Hannity ran the Seth Rich conspiracy theory for days and still has NEVER admitted that he (&amp; Fox) got it wrong. See a difference?
@dherman001 @GroffMarya @scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount Is this a serious question? Rather is an award winning JOURNALIST; Hannity is a SELF-TITLED "PROPAGANDIST." What has happened to the morality level in our country where propaganda is willingly sought out over facts? Tune in to NPR or BBC if you don't trust MSN here, sweet Jesus.
@scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett Read towards the bottom. 		https://t.co/42ZDBaTP2f
@scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett Yes, that was his FIRST response to the inquiry. He then added later that he "may have handed him $10 for attorney-client privilege." Can't have the privilege and NOT be a client. I suggest that you search for an updated article.
@scanners1111 @Mikel_Jollett @bentonblount @dherman001 He paid him a $10 "retainer" for attorney-client privilege. Yet Hannity then said he ‚Äúmight have handed‚Äù Cohen $10 and said, ‚ÄúI want attorney-client privilege on this‚Äù Facts matter.
@Jalbarron13 @RVAwonk That's exactly what he wants, for everyone but Fox News, Breitbart, et al. to go away so that only HIS "truth" is reported. They need to hold their ground.

@QtipTheAbstract  music, as an art form, is a work in progress. Like it or not us older, wiser beings must embrace the change and support it
@QtipTheAbstract and the rare few who can maintain in the game based solely on their lyrical content are appreciated mainly by 80s babies

Leasing/stealing beats and posting links to your music on social media &amp; mainstream artists' timelines/album comments is not going to work
Indy artists definitely should support one another but if you don't have $ then how do you expect to market your music or pay for production
If you inquire about a feature from another artist then you need to be prepared to answer questions about your budget. NO ONE WORKS FOR FREE

@C4BOMBS I was just naming non-dream teamers. The league def more athletic now but the old schoolers were smarter ballers.
@C4BOMBS they had dumars, nique, Kemp, Isaiah, LJ, Mark Price, Reggie, etc but who's to say which group is better lol
@C4BOMBS Pippen was a stout defender, always made all defensive team. Game is def different though, would be a great matchup either way
@C4BOMBS Chandler can D up too I forgot about him. I'm a knicks fan I seen it firsthand lol
@C4BOMBS Blake Griffin is trash on D. I will give you D Howard but MJ, Pippen, Stockton, Robinson and Barkley/Malone would be too much.
