.@HouseGOP's tax plan is a shameless giveaway for special interest that hurts middle class families. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/mBBoN7Unlz
El Crédito Fiscal por Hijos ayuda a 1 millón de latinos a no caer en la pobreza. ¡Debemos de detener este fraudulento plan fiscal! #GOPTaxScam
The Child Tax Credit helps keep nearly 1 million Latino children out of poverty. The #GOPTaxScam’s  would make changes to the CTC and strip away benefits for hard-working families.
Here's how the people of #NV04 feel about the #GOPTaxScam:		OPPOSE: 1,345	SUPPORT: 41 		I'm standing strong against this deficit-exploding, tax giveaway for the wealthy.

#NV families depend on after-school programs. Yet, #TrumpCuts $9 Million in funding, causing over 9K students to lose these services.
#TrumpCuts $2.6 billion from @EPA and $3.7 million from Nevada's environmental grants.
#TrumpCuts actually cut employment, need-based programs &amp; aid, and access to healthcare.
#TrumpCuts DOL job training &amp; employment service programs by 35% -- 5-7 million Americans will lose access to employment services.
#TrumpCuts $5.8 billion from the National Institutes of Health, reducing and undermining life-saving medical research.
#TrumpCuts completely eliminates college grant aid, SEOG — making it impossible for millions of Americans to access higher education.
