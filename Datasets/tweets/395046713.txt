@MikeHayes61 @nastypantsuit @debamelxof @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani Yes they did. He tried to get black kids executed for a crime they didn't commit. His real estate firm had been discriminating for decades. Now he wants to ban Muslims from the country and calls Mexicans rapists and murderers. You're blind dude
@mflynnJR Notice no denial of guilt, just more slandering. And they wont comment because they are under investigation.  Hope your dad enjoys prison shithead

It just sucks to see people now a days live in their little bubbles of misinformation. It angers us to see people so blinded to the truth by Fox News and right wing media
@nastypantsuit @debamelxof @MikeHayes61 @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani It's called confirmation bias . That's why they like Fox News so much
@nastypantsuit @debamelxof @MikeHayes61 @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani Gotta love it. The saddest part is seeing otherwise smart people being misguided
@debamelxof @MikeHayes61 @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani Im not gonna sit here and argue this anymore. A simple google search will show you plenty of studies that say Fox "news" viewers are more misinformed than people who watch no news at all. Continue wallowing in your lies and misinfo though

@debamelxof @MikeHayes61 @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani So anyone that doesnt spew garbage all day like the rest of fox is liberal and biased? Wow you really are in need of help

@debamelxof @MikeHayes61 @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani Like ive said on here three times already for those who dont listen. I dont watch CNN and barely watch any others. CSPAN and a few unbiased outlets can tell you all you need to know. As well as actually researching and doing fact checking which I know u Foxnews cultists dont
@debamelxof @MikeHayes61 @MissGFYCuffy @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani The only person on Fox who even tries to report facts anymore is Shep and they will run him off soon for not backing their false narratives

@debamelxof @MissGFYCuffy @MikeHayes61 @Darchmare @SenJohnMcCain @ShyamToprani Yea that sounds great while the right is literally calling to end an investigation because a tRump flunky released a bs memo saying the heavily corroborated dossier was the base for a FISA warrant when it was because Carter Page was a Russian asset

@realDonaldTrump This isn't a third world country dumbass . We have laws for a reason. The saddest part is without gerrymandering the GOP wouldn't have anything.
@realDonaldTrump I don't know about best friends but you are definitely his puppet.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends In other news you still haven't signed sanctions, released your taxes, or desolated from your businesses. Also your campaign manager and more are indicted and your #TrumpCrimeFamily is next.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It's pathetic how insecure you are . Obama was 1000x the man and leader you will ever be and tweets like this prove it. Turn off the fake news and go play golf so you can't screw anything else up , moron

@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest Fact: active military can buy beer at the px. Military family member here. And the FBI gets 400k tips a year. Maybe if the laws didn't allow him to buy an AR-15 and 1000 rounds of ammo this wouldn't have happened
@realDonaldTrump Well I guess we know what you've been reflecting on dipshit. You can feel the walls closing in like Mueller huh? Better resign before he locks up you and your #TrumpCrimeFamily
@realDonaldTrump Damn you sound scared Dotard. And unlike you he signed sanctions you traitor. And @SenMajLdr blocked his efforts because he's an asshole

@GOP Pimping the presidency one moron at a time. Shameful
@RepublicanAGs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He has literally broken every emoluments law there is, handed intel to the Russians and conspired against our country to steal an election get this BS off my feed @Twitter
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest Still a better solution than arming teachers and having guns in schools at all times
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest There are people being murdered every day. I am a gun owner , I hunt and carry everyday but I don't think anyone should own military style weapons and have thousands of rounds of ammo. I guess we're gonna have to agree to disagree. Nice talking with you
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest You know what my favorite part of the 2nd amendment is? (Well regulated) , the kid who shot up that school wasn't even old enough to buy beer but could get an AR-15 with no wait time after it was k own he had mental problems.

@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest Here's an idea. Take the money Trump wants to spend in the wall and install metal detectors. Or trained security guards. Arming teachers is not the answer man . I'm open to other suggestions too but this is a flawed plan
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest Teachers are buying their own pencils and ink and you think we can afford to give them glocks? Come on man. Our education system is falling behind the rest of the world already. There are already more guns in this country than people . We have a gun problem now we must fix it

@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest At least there if you see someone with an assault rifle you know their a bad guy. And look at the numbers of mass murders there compared to here. It's not hard to see that other countries who have less guns have less murders.
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest We could make it harder for bad guys to get guns capable of murdering mass numbers of people. That would be a start. Make it where they have to wait a few days . All these are better options than arming teachers
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest So you want to compound them by adding more guns to the equation? You can't see the fault in that?
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest Then you agree there are problems with your premise?
@pajiba That @realDonaldTrump is a narcissistic, racist, lying pos, failure of a *president
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest And how long before a student gets one of these weapons? If a teacher snaps one day.I can't see how more guns is the answer nor is more bullets flying around in a situation like this.And who is liable if a student is hit with said concealed weapon in a shootout? Endless problems
@MyConservatism @FoxNews @Theonlyhonest The NYPD had an 18% success rate of hitting their target in a situation like this. What do you think will happen when Mrs. Krabapple pulls out an AR-15 in a room full of frightened children? This is an honest question
@FoxNews @VP Did mother approve this message? Now who's out of touch?
@francismmaxwell Nailed it
@TomiLahren Listen Tammy, the gun isn't being blamed. The ease with which a person who just left a psychiatric ward can obtain a military grade weapon is . The fact a person can leave the pharmacy from picking up psych meds and buy an assault rifle is. Quit gaslighting and use your head.

@donnie_couch @InnovaRick @2Dwborah @ShawnHanitty @MooreSenate I personally don't feel that people will act any different on account of religion. I have never been religious, not for lack of trying early on. I've never raped or murdered anyone yet some Christians have. Deep down it's about right and wrong not religion
@donnie_couch @InnovaRick @2Dwborah @ShawnHanitty @MooreSenate And hence the origin for all religions. If people fear what happens after they tend to act better on the whole.
