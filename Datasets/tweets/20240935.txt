@brockwilliams @ChrisBils @columbusbiz1st I had a long conversation with my counterpart in San Antonio about this and my god are they pissed about how all this has shaken out. For good reason!
@brockwilliams @ChrisBils @columbusbiz1st Their argument is they're not helping to pay for a new stadium. The money will go into public infrastructure and other investments that are typical of any economic development deal. And the Mapfre site will become a public asset so not subsidizing a private interest.
@MGonidakis They're stressing that the city portion is what they would do to complete any economic development deal, and none is going to the stadium itself. That said, $50 million.

"We knew that we were going to have a big dinosaur called Mapfre Stadium on our hands," said Columbus Partnership CEO @AlexFischerCBUS. "We’ve gotta make sure we protect that asset as well and not abandon those neighborhoods that sit in a fragile section of Columbus."
"This investment makes sense," said Columbus City Auditor Megan Kilgore. "We are trying to be realistic and conservative in the projects we undertake – this is no different than any other capital project. It's just capital dollars." #SaveTheCrew
"I want to see multi-generational programs in these neighborhoods, to adapt and reuse the stadium to benefit the community," Ginther told us. "We want the local neighborhoods using this, not feeling excluded from it." #SaveTheCrew https://t.co/Wyh2bHCE7R

@boatboyfiggy I went to Ohio State.
@zo_the_iii Whether you disbelieve Courtney Smith or not doesn't change where we are now. I'm simply stating that Ohio State's decision will come down to what is good for Ohio State, not the football program.
@jake_repasky True, then we're talking about Gene Smith. Firing him is certainly a possibility. He signed off on everything that's gone down.
@RionMyers I saw that story, Rion. The problem is Urban Meyer and Gene Smith showed they believed her when they fired Zach Smith. If they only did it for PR, then you can't expect OSU won't do the same to Urban. It's the same image problem.
@jake_repasky Thx for the feedback, Jake. I think at this point it's Ohio State's cross to bear. Call it scapegoating if you will, but that's why I think they're going to let him go. What they decide will reflect on Ohio State, regardless of how we got here.

@OhioTiger3 Play a team that many times in a row and they'll figure you out. Not that the Jackets needed much help wasting power plays....
@EdPlunkett Don't know how much flexibility they have to upend the roster but clearly several high-profile players have outlived their usefulness.
@GoldenBearVlad Problems that were there all season really came into the spotlight with the pressure on.
@EdPlunkett That was hard to watch over the final few games.
And the bookend to that: "The Blue Jackets finished the series in an 0-for-17 black hole on the power play."

@nickseguin I could go on and on about that. It's something we've dealt with our entire 30 years in existence. It's a constant issue.
@nickseguin I'd also encourage you to consider the entirety of our coverage, as each piece fits into the mosaic. No one is doing more, imho
@nickseguin I can agree w/ that but there's not a huge universe of funders here, either. We're all ears if anyone else wants to pitch us.
@nickseguin We're sensitive to avoid being shills.
@nickseguin I don't think that means the stories are w/o substance.
@nickseguin A lot of startups won't reveal full financial information. We have to choose between ignoring them or reporting what we can.
@nickseguin Understand your general point but what stories are you referencing?
