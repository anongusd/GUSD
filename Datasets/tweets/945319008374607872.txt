@TheMegaPixel_ @BuningKaren @AcidicThought8 @LorenCSackett @momomiester @SenBillNelson In the same sentence, "A well 'regulated' militia." Meaning that it has to be controlled, therefore, regulated.
@TheMegaPixel_ @BuningKaren @AcidicThought8 @LorenCSackett @momomiester @SenBillNelson "But regulations are unconstitutional." Sure bud. Just because of that, I'll let myself out.

@TheMegaPixel_ @BuningKaren @AcidicThought8 @LorenCSackett @momomiester @SenBillNelson Yes, not now. But 10 years from now.....	Anyway, suppressing? Little extreme dont you think? It's called regulating. The 1st amendment can be regulated, just like the 2nd.
@TheMegaPixel_ @BuningKaren @AcidicThought8 @LorenCSackett @momomiester @SenBillNelson Fair point.

@ThatsMyChad @EvenFlow121 @JonTronShow Ear plugs?	Headphones?	Any case of permanent hearing damage is the user's fault.

@JayBraddock1 @pewdiepie What are you, Sherlock Holmes? Like I said, there may be other reasons for her divorce, you don't know, I don't know, so let's not report her to the Canadian immigration control if none of us know the full story.
@Jasonjoesph @thefactsnow And even though they changed it, it still shows how remarkably deadly cigarettes are. And isn't that what you wanted? For them to change it?
@Jasonjoesph @thefactsnow Opioids aren't illegal, they mean heroin, cocaine, etcetera.
@Jasonjoesph @thefactsnow Changed what?
@Jasonjoesph @thefactsnow They are not demonizing people who smoke, nor are they saying that they should stop smoking. They're simply stating the dangers of smoking. Also, how are their facts false?
@JayBraddock1 @pewdiepie How do you know? That clip was taken completely out of context, she could have divorced that guy because of other reasons. I don't know, you may be right, for all I know.
@Jasonjoesph @thefactsnow Are you seriously trying to defend smoking? And if you are, you're comparing apples and oranges with your comparison between deaths from car crashes and deaths from cigarettes.
@JayBraddock1 @pewdiepie Like domestic violence, abuse, etcetera?
@JayBraddock1 @pewdiepie So you're telling me that if you marry someone, and then emigrate to their country and then file a divorce, you should be reported to the immigration control there? Even if the person that emigrated filed the divorce because of other reasons?
@Jasonjoesph @thefactsnow That's not their choice to die in a crash, unlike cigarettes.

@epiczack117 @AdamBryce8 @BoyFromWestSid1 @PyrocynicalTV She isn't British, she's a Norwegian resistance fighter.
@AdamBryce8 @BoyFromWestSid1 @PyrocynicalTV I can understand the outrage behind that, but for her being female? That's historically accurate. Not the arm.

@Flavo_Optimius @JayBraddock1 @pewdiepie Also, who says she married that man to get into the country? There must be more to the story than what is presented. People nowadays just jump to conclusions.

@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein No sir, just wanted to correct you that's all.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Do I need to repeat everything I just said to you? Showing the same picture with the same claim won't make it true.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Various attachments, like the bump stock, high capacity magazines, etc. Also better weaponry in general. Guns aren't like they were back then. Before we had single shot muskets, so I dont know what you were trying to prove here.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Make a law requiring parents to lock their guns safely away. Don't you know? All those "law abiding citizens" doing their good work of being law abiding. You're helping the narrative to ban all guns (which I (and the majority of the democratic party) don't support).
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Still avoiding the conversation by the way.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Nope, you had a space in between.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Texas doesnt have a law requiring you to lock up your guns so...
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein 1. *inaccurate	2. My beliefs have nothing to do with gun violence. Stop avoiding the conversation.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein No, what I'm saying is is that if we apply more gun laws, like stricter background checks, banning unneeded attachments like the bump stock, etc. THEN the issue may be solved.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Uh... no. A dude that is gonna shoot up a place or murder someone can LEGALLY buy a gun. It's really not that hard.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Do I need to say this again? Trucks are meant for transportation. Guns are meant for killing animals and/or people. It's not like a dude is mowing people down in a truck every day. Unlike guns, which cause way more deaths daily.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein You really hate differing beliefs don't you?
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Dude, those gun laws didn't prevent him from going to that school and shooting the place up. Those laws were just saying "Don't murder people with a gun" and "Don't bring a firearm to this place" and etc. We need laws to prevent those laws from being broken.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein *gun
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Maybe we can make fun laws to prevent those gun laws from being broken? Ever cross your mind?
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Trucks are meant for transportation, not killing people.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein 1. Abortion is a separate issue, another time.	2. Literally search up a video on how easy it is to buy a gun, and it'll show you, point blank, how easy it is.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein How are they regulated in these violent countries? And it's far to easy to get a gun in this country.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Correction: if they regulated guns, the there would be LESS deranged persons trying to kill others.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein And anyway, his numbers are GUN violence, not overall violence.
@HawtreyErik @jeffreyrsears @SenFeinstein Maybe this violence has part to do with, oh I don't know, GUNS?

@realDonaldTrump Once again, another school shooting. If we jay pray and send our condolences, it's not going to suddenly stop gun violence. It's sad that I am not surprised, or startled, or even disturbed that this happened. It's a daily routine for America now. Pray, send condolences, ignore...
Thanks Trump... if it wasn't for you, my dad would have income right now. Thanks for rejecting a bipartisan deal. You're making this country ignorant again!
When someone is belittled because of their culture, skin, etcetra, it is the most pitiful thing I've ever seen. "Someone's different than me? I AM SUPERIOR TO THEM." You can't simply generalize a race. It's impossible. https://t.co/6rz9tTF74Q
@realDonaldTrump You are the problem with this country. YOU KEEP TEARING THE PARTIES APART, AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, NOTHING GETS DONE. If politics were solely based on facts we wouldn't have you.

@PressSec The best part about it is that WSJ is actually conservative bias.
@washingtonpost Ridiculous.
@realDonaldTrump Politics is one big drama show, and I find that ridiculous. A reality television show shouldn't be running the world.
@realDonaldTrump The odds of you helping the Democrats are almost as unbelievably false as your claims saying that you didn't collude with Russia.

When I say "Why", I mean we shouldn't question why we are allowing people from those countries come here, but we should ask why they wish to come here.
@BryanPhilips3 @CNNPolitics Actually say something effective please, or just leave.
"Shithole countries". Anybody who says this is "fake news" is clearly wrong because the people that were in the meeting with Trump came out and said he did say these remarks. In America, we should never ask why people from these countries are coming here. Never.
RT @mytracyann: @aka_pierrecouvy @gettinnoticedmo Fo shur! But it started long ago... https://t.co/Y9WTCv4p6K
@ubipages @CNNPolitics You can't have a debate if you generalize like that.
@ubipages @CNNPolitics Memes will not prove your point. Have a debate with statements, not jokes.
@CNNPolitics It's always Hillary with Trump. If Trump murders somebody and 10 people saw it, he will still claim it's Hillary. It's an exaggeration I know, but it's a believable exaggeration.
@trolinthebull @CNNPolitics @CillizzaCNN Before the accusations?

@realDonaldTrump Maybe there's a thing called ignoring. Isn't that what you're so good at? All the other presidents had to deal with fake news, you're not special.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, because the size of the button matters.
If people who support Trump can't see his numerous false claims, things do get better in High School.
@realDonaldTrump Guess What? That bonus will do jack in 2025 when taxes INCREASE. We will be paying more than we were before the tax cut.
@h3h3productions Was it an actual corpse?
@realDonaldTrump Sweet sweet generalizing. Also, your predictions are false.

@Banks @AlissaViolet How did you type this if she's holding your hand.
@washingtonpost Literally 3 minutes after it turns midnight.
@realDonaldTrump Stop acting tough, Trump. WE DO NOT WANT A WAR WITH IRAN.
@realDonaldTrump We're not going to do anything Trump. The USA is not going to do anything and we are not watching closely. You say we're doing something but it's quite the contrary.
@realDonaldTrump So should Iran not fight terrorism?
@Billygotnochill @wwweirdnews @realDonaldTrump Still waiting...
@realDonaldTrump Fox is bias conservative trash.
@BlakeShelton193 @lindasb117 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein You really are ignorant. Do your research before you argue. Or will that take to much time out of a hard working man's day?
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein Did you even listen to what I said? I'm not saying that Trump hates Jews. I'm saying that his motives are similar.
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein To bad I already did. Why you may ask? BECAUSE HE IS LIKE HITLER. Sorry for giving valid evidence.
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein How?
@BlakeShelton193 So why would you support something that hurts you?
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein What's the point in arguing with you 2 if you won't face the facts? Is it because you're to scared to face reality?
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein Also the tax bill is a temporary tax cut for the middle class while the corporations are permanent. The middle class will get raised taxes around 2025.
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein The people want a male leader, self inspiration, etcetera. Which conservatives look awfully fascist.
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein Also the fascist "rules" are also a sign.
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein Hitler with jews.
@BlakeShelton193 @cjbobbyorr @krassenstein Are you two done? I have read a history book and Trump is s9mewhat like Hitler. I'm not saying that he's going to commit mass genocide any time soon, but come on. The German people wanted a ruler to protect them from a group that they deemed unsage.(Trump with immigrants)
@BlakeShelton193 @krassenstein There are some points he claims that are extreme, I agree. But the majority of information he says is true. You just fail to believe it, because you've been brainwashed into thinking that this info is fake by right wing bias news sources.
@krassenstein @BlakeShelton193 I'm glad someone does their research.

@etatton @realDonaldTrump Finally someone who isn't blind.
@kev_Sanjaya @realDonaldTrump I hate Donald Trump as much as the next guy, but this isn't up for discussion. We'd rather not waste human life to waste human life. So we use drones to kill the opposition.
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost I can't even begin where to criticize you on that, so I just won't, because you are the most idiotic conservative I've ever heard.	Congratulations on being another civilian in America being manipulated and lied to.
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost Why would I lie about my race?
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost 1. I'm not Mexican. 2. You're obviously racist towards Mexicans so I don't see the point in arguing with someone as idiotic as you. Trump labeled illegal immigrants as criminals just so he could become president and feed his already massive ego. You're being manipulated.
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost They're not all bad. They're trying to escape a country and make a better life in America. Trump is saying they're all bad, and that, my fellow opposition,is fake news.
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost And that's bad why? They're doing what they should do to become president. Donald Trump labeled illegal immigrants as rapists and criminals, so he said I'll build a wall and protect you from these people, and it worked.
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost How's it fake then?
@Larry_in_Ohio @washingtonpost Read the article you ignorant ass.
@KingGeorgeTV Are you good?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah. Businesses and ONLY businesses. Jobs won't fix raised taxes for the people GETTING those jobs.
