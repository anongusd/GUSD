@CarmenFarinaDOE That's Amazing! Melissa Salguero you are a true HERO ! Let's continue to support Women across the board.  A suggestion for @NYCSchools  could be to ad Women inclusion goals on their procurement efforts. Women small businesses should be included! #TimesUp
@NYCSchools She is a real #HERO !! We should continue to support women across the board!  I wonder why @NYCSchools  doesn't have Women Inclusion goals on theirs procurement efforts?  @CarmenFarinaDOE @NYCMayorsOffice @NYC_SBS  #TimesUp

@CarmenFarinaDOE Chancellor, I would like to take few seconds to ask you as a Minority small business owner. Why the NYC Schools system doesn't have any Minority goals on their procurement opportunities. We are bidding on RFB - B3177 and no MWBE will win without some goals. Thank
