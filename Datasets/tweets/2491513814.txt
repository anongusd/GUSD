The @NCSenateDems unanimously supports common sense gun legislation. There is no reason for an 18 yr. old to have access to a weapon of war. I'm inspired by these young folks - they believe in their cause and I believe they can move our society forward.
One reason for this joint #TownHall is to let you all know who your representative truly is now that the state's #gerrymandering lawsuits have been settled. Ultimately @jay_chaudhuri and I have the same goal of providing the best representation for you in the #ncga
We are just minutes away from our joint #TownHall with @jay_chaudhuri 	If you can't be at the Garner Road Community Center tonight, reach out to us on social media and let us know what your concerns and priorities are for the #ncga
Tonight, @jay_chaudhuri and I will continue the conversation in the latest #TownHall - school safety, education funding, infrastructure needs and how the #ncga can truly be the people's house once again. https://t.co/ha8BBuB73Y

We need to bring transparency and integrity back to the General Assembly and back to government.
But they’ve spent most of the last year focused on power rather than the people.
The majority had the opportunity to do better than their predecessors, to move NC forward.
The people want an end to the toxic gridlocked that has gripped government and the institutions that we used to respect.
The people care about seeing elected officials actually serving their best interests instead of spending their time on partisan retaliation.
Here’s my message: the people don’t care what happened in 2016, in 1996 or in 1916 the way that Republicans in office seem to.
One of Republicans’ favorite talking points is that Democrats don’t have a message and that’s our problem.
We get that, and we’ve seen that. You haven’t hidden your disdain for the minority party – particularly since Gov. Cooper came into office
So it’s understandable that, after that much time in the minority, Rs all have a lot of pent up frustration to unload.
It’s all well &amp; good to go back through the Dem history on redistricting. There’s a lot of data b/c Dems spent so much time in the majority
