Today, the full US Senate voted 50-49 to overturn Trump Admin’s #darkmoney rule that exempts some organizations from disclosing large donors to the IRS. This is a positive step for fair elections. Now the House must also act on bipartisan basis.
US Senate voted 87-13 to pass bipartisan #FarmBill. Several key wins for RI #farmers &amp; families: will help small farms, feed families in need, boost local farmers markets, enhance conservation, legalize industrial #hemp, &amp; expand #cropinsurance access to #shellfish growers.

Saudi’s latest version of events isn’t credible. Trump Admin must not be complicit in allowing them to sweep this under the rug. We must demand independent investigation &amp; honest account of what transpired. Follow evidence wherever it leads &amp; bring justice to those responsible.

President Trump’s attempt to walk back his disastrous statements at the Trump-Putin press conference today is too little, too late and simply not credible a full day later.
If President Trump accepts U.S. intelligence then why did he side with Putin on multiple occasions while they were standing shoulder to shoulder?  And why does he continue trying to equivocate now?
President Trump’s incoherent and shifting stance suggests he is either insincere or he committed an act of diplomatic ineptitude.
President Trump is adamant there was ‘no collusion,’ yet equally adamant about avoiding the Special Counsel.  		President Trump sat down with Vladimir Putin yesterday, now he should sit down with Bob Mueller.

Latest indictment from Trump-Russia probe shows Putin expended considerable resources to interfere in U.S. election to benefit the Trump campaign. If there is a 1-on-1 Trump-Putin meeting, Pres Trump seems incapable of seriously confronting Putin for misdeeds that benefited him.

Americans shouldn’t have to pay an age tax, but the Trump Admin’s policies are forcing Americans age 50 to 64 to start paying higher health premiums &amp; weakening protections for all people w/ preexisting conditions. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/xvfAfaZdmx

Pres Trump signed an order repealing protections for our #oceans -- eroding progress we’ve made when it comes to smart ocean planning &amp; conservation. This is another example of Trump Admin prioritizing offshore oil &amp; gas drilling interests ahead of public health &amp; #marinelife.
After falsely claiming he couldn’t end family separations, Pres Trump reversed himself. But his latest policy is still costly &amp; ineffective. Trump Admin must immediately take steps to reunite these kids &amp; their parents &amp; stop using family internment as a political bargaining chip

Strong turnout on a school night from concerned citizens who want to #StopDeVos. #OneMoreVote https://t.co/roS3Hyt6gW
Teachers must be trained &amp; qualified. The Secretary of Education should be too. #DeVos is unqualified. Our kids deserve better. #NoOnDevos https://t.co/vc7JwKCJk8

This #BlackHistoryMonth, we remember the 1st Rhode Island Regiment aka the "Black Regiment" who fought for the liberty of all Americans. https://t.co/j4RDHLF4E6
All of Obama’s #SCOTUS nominees cleared a sixty vote threshold &amp; President Trump’s nominee must adhere to the same standard.
As I stated when Merrick Garland was nominated: There is plenty of room for tough questions and respectful debate in #SCOTUS process.
I am concerned that #Gorsuch has a tendency to favor the interests of big corporations &amp; special interests over every day Americans.
#SCOTUS nominee Gorsuch’s record suggests he could impose significant new constraints on Americans' rights &amp; civil liberties.
Senate GOP did a real disservice to the nation when they took extreme step of blocking Obama’s moderate #SCOTUS nominee for nearly a year.
I will vote no on Jeff Sessions nomination to be Attorney General.

Thanks to the overflow crowd who waited outside &amp; braved the cold to make their support for affordable health coverage known! #SaveACA https://t.co/ys4x596RTm
ACA helps families breathe easier – more secure in the knowledge that they can’t be denied coverage if a parent or child gets seriously ill.
Thanks to #Obamacare, the uninsured rate is at its lowest point in recent history. RI has gone from nearly 12% to under 4.5%. #SaveACA

Tell your Senator or Representative: Restore fairness to tax code &amp; close the CEO bonus loophole. https://t.co/80Q3C7Kesp
We must prioritize tax breaks that grow our economy &amp; strengthen middle class. Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to subsidize a CEO's big bonus.
Here’s a cartoon primer from @voxdotcom that illustrates how current law forces taxpayers to subsidize CEO bonuses: https://t.co/WhYXgQbr6i
The Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act would end unlimited tax write-offs for corporate executive compensation.

Here is the declassified intelligence report on Russian hacking that is now publicly available: https://t.co/lbLbWb6Ms4
Like Jerry trying to return a jacket, GOP is repealing Obamacare bc of spite. Seinfeld was funny. Denying Americans health coverage is not. https://t.co/O7IB44rWZM
GOP Obamacare repeal could put 463,000 RIers with pre-existing conditions like #asthma #diabetes &amp; #cancer at risk of paying higher premiums
GOP’s rush to gut Obamacare will mean less coverage &amp; higher health costs for all Americans. It will #MakeAmericaSickAgain

A bipartisan Special Committee as @SenJohnMcCain @SenSchumer @GrahamBlog &amp; I proposed is best way to get at truth &amp; stop future attacks 3/8
