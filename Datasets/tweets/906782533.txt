A desk in the House Chamber was a Member’s office in the 19th century. He stowed his hat beneath his chair, wrote and stored papers in the writing desk, and occasionally propped his feet up to listen to debate. #OpeningDay https://t.co/pyff1Do27j
The Speaker, then, in turn, administers the oath of office to all the Members-elect. #OpeningDay #116thCongress https://t.co/E1e5FPwCEa
“Though my junior by nearly twenty years,” Adams said, “I have looked up to him in this House, with the reverence of filial affection, as if he was the father of us all.” Origins of the "Dean of the House." #OpeningDay #HistoryBlog https://t.co/x4lQrFKNjV https://t.co/7YPJP9p6fi
On #OpeningDay, after being introduced by the minority party leader and making a speech, the Speaker takes the oath of office (administered by the Dean of the House—the longest serving Member). https://t.co/IbHiBluV4V https://t.co/MFST9y3HYt
He paused for a moment. With his thick dark hair swept to one side and a prominent mustache obscuring his upper lip, newly-elected Speaker Nathaniel Banks then stood to address his colleagues. #HistoryBlog #OpeningDay https://t.co/Y8deBvGPgB https://t.co/JMdkYkKz9m
The ceremonial chair, impressively scaled with a scroll-back, dates to 1941. Like the Clerk’s gavel, the chair sits on the rostrum only for Opening Day—used by a dozen Speakers beginning with Sam Rayburn. #OpeningDay #116thCongress https://t.co/xi3sIlV6cT https://t.co/JNnShlIrzV
Once the votes have been tabulated and certified, the newly elected Speaker is escorted to the Speaker’s chair at the top of the rostrum by a bipartisan delegation of Members appointed by the Clerk. #OpeningDay https://t.co/KZbHIlpqNe https://t.co/gNamaHHdXO
The House of Representatives first met in the current chamber in 1857; it underwent extensive renovations in the late 1940s, re-opening in 1951. https://t.co/VUkdCHRFSC https://t.co/LGR9dWiYJA
What are you looking at? Take a tour of the House Chamber with our curator. #OpeningDay https://t.co/ZGlvsayLLG
The Speaker is elected at the beginning of a new Congress by a majority of the Reps-elect from candidates separately chosen by the majority- and minority-party caucuses. #OpeningDay https://t.co/OyskrHp8NA
The House then moves to its next order of business: the election of the Speaker. #OpeningDay
After the quorum call, the Clerk announces the credentials of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico (when applicable) and the Delegates from each territory. #OpeningDay
The inkstand is even older, commissioned by the House soon after the Capitol was rebuilt following the War of 1812.  #HouseCollection #HistoryBlog #OpeningDay https://t.co/glU9E4jrKM https://t.co/NjSEXey2uj
The Mace, representing the authority of the House, and located on a stand to the Speaker's right, has been in the chamber since 1841. #HouseCollection #HistoryBlog #OpeningDay https://t.co/1d5YFrERm2 https://t.co/TKHOuqtlql

A tradition that dates to the earliest Congresses, the Clerk of the House from the preceding Congress calls the chamber to order and presides until a Speaker is elected. #OpeningDay https://t.co/Ot8Of27ESv
In recent Congresses, a designated Clerk’s gavel comes out of storage for the occasion to commemorate the “gaveling in” of the new Congress.  #HouseCollection #OpeningDay https://t.co/FLnQmQdxBI https://t.co/iGc1YsBwo1
Visitors and Members’ families arrive to watch the ceremonies, and gallery passes become treasured souvenirs. #HouseCollection #OpeningDay https://t.co/8io9tpTG90 https://t.co/KYmKdCTHyi
Members-elect register their presence by using their voting cards at the electronic voting machines throughout the chamber. #OpeningDay
Next, the Clerk announces the receipt of the credentials of the 435 voting Members-elect, and directs a reading clerk to call the roll to verify that there is a quorum, or majority, present. #OpeningDay
The Clerk then leads the Members-elect, staff, and spectators in the galleries in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. #OpeningDay
After the Clerk gavels the new Congress into session, the House Chaplain offers a prayer. #OpeningDay
Unlike the Senate, in which only one-third of its Members are up for election every two years, the House starts anew—reconstituting itself by electing a Speaker, swearing-in the 435 voting Members-elect, and adopting new rules. #OpeningDay https://t.co/u7enU8LKK5
Every two years, as mandated in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, the U.S. House of Representatives starts a new legislative session, known as a Congress. #OpeningDay https://t.co/u7enU8LKK5

"How shall we answer their challenge, gentlemen; how shall we explain to them the meaning of democracy if the same Congress that voted for war to make the world safe for democracy refuses to give this small measure of democracy to the women of our country?" #OTD 1918.
"Can we afford to allow these men and women to doubt for a single instant the sincerity of our protestations of democracy?" #OTD 1918.
"These are the people of the Nation. These are the fiber and sinew of war—the mother, the farmer, the miner, the industrial worker, the soldier. These are the people who are giving their all for the cause of democracy." #OTD 1918.
"To-day there are men and women in every field of endeavor who are bending all their energies toward a realization of this dream of universal justice. They believe that we are waging a war for democracy." #OTD 1918.
"Deep down in the hearts of the American people Is a living faith in democracy….It is our national religion, and it prompts in us the desire for that measure of justice which is based on equal opportunity, equal protection, equal freedom for all." #OTD 1918.
"These are heroic times, and they call for the strength and the courage and the dignity to think and act in national terms....Why can we not now think in national terms and extend opportunities?" #OTD 1918.
"Are we now going to refuse these women the opportunity to serve in the face of their plea—in the face of the Nation's great need?" #OTD 1918.
"To-day as never before the Nation needs its women—needs the work of their hands and their hearts and their minds. Their energy must be utilized in the most effective service they can give." #OTD 1918.
"The women have done all that they were allowed to do, all that the men planned for them to do. But through all their work they have pleaded for the political machinery which would enable them to do more." #OTD 1918.
"As they were the stabilizing influence in the home and kept the family unity, so they have become a great possible stabilizing influence in society, asking now to help keep the unity of the Nation to its highest standard of service." #OTD 1918.
"They learned to read and to know each other. They became interested in each others' problems, for they found them to be their own problems." #OTD 1918.
"All have felt that the energy, the thought, and the suffering that was spent in trying to obtain permission to serve directly should as quickly as possible be turned to the actual service. And in the meantime they did all they could indirectly." #OTD 1918.
"For 70 years the women leaders of this country have been asking the Government to recognize this possibility. Every great woman who stands out in our history...all have asked the Government to permit women to serve more effectively the national welfare."  #OTD 1918.
"...would not lend a certain virility, a certain influx of new strength and understanding and sympathy and ability to the exhausting effort we are now making to meet the problem before us." #OTD 1918.
"It would be strange if the influence of women through direct participation in the political struggles, through which all social and industrial development proceeds..."
"It would be strange indeed If the women of this country through all these years had not developed an intelligence, a feeling, a spiritual force peculiar to themselves, which they hold in readiness to give to the world." #OTD 1918.
"Might it not be that a great force that has always been thinking in terms of human needs...has not been mobilized? Is it not possible that the women of the country have something of value to give the Nation at this time?" #OTD 1918.
"Mr. Speaker, we are facing to-day a question of political evolution….The things we have for years been taking for granted are suddenly assuming a new significance for us." #OTD 1918.
