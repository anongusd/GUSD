I support the #VotingRightsAdvancementAct, because our right to vote is at the heart of our identity as Americans. We must never allow discrimination, corruption, or misapplications of the law to interfere with each Central Virginian’s right to a voice in their government.
86 years ago today, Frances Perkins became the first woman to serve in the U.S. cabinet. As Sec. of Labor, she helped establish #SocialSecurity, minimum wage, &amp; overtime laws. Perkins laid the foundation for the modern workforce. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/D8lmB61vQg
Washington can be hectic, but I keep my eyes on one goal: representing the people of #VA07 &amp; keeping my promises to them. I’m proud to support #HR1, a bill to	✔️ Tackle corruption 	✔️ Protect our right to vote	✔️ Fight the influence of special interests on our elections
In last week’s @HouseAgDems hearing, I asked @SecretarySonny Perdue if current funding for rural broadband programs is sufficient to serve #VA07 &amp; all rural areas of the country. He agreed that we can do more to expand broadband access from coast to coast. https://t.co/GrzC5B35pv

Constitutionally, it is Congress that has the authority to appropriate money, and the President’s efforts to sidestep that authority and the checks and balances process that authority represents is deeply concerning. (4/4)
Additionally, the president’s unilateral action of declaring a national emergency actually jeopardizes our national security by pulling critical funding from our military. (3/4)
Notably, it comes after Congress successfully conducted bipartisan, bicameral negotiations that resulted in the passage of a bipartisan appropriations bill last night—legislation that funds the government and provides for border security investments. (2/4)
This emergency declaration is a reckless, knee-jerk decision that sets a troubling precedent, and this declaration fundamentally undermines the constitutional authority of Congress. (1/4)
Nice to see there’s no beef between you two. https://t.co/fQyRDCRERE

#VA07, our first town hall has reached capacity. We created a free online registration because we didn’t want anyone to have to wait in line in the cold or arrive an hour early to get a seat. The Goochland venue fits 125, &amp; we will stick to that number for everyone’s safety.

17- We must demonstrate a willingness to collaborate and compromise as we serve the people we were elected to represent.
16- We are indeed stronger as a country when Congress and the President work together to move us forward, and our challenges are simply too large to sit idle in our corners.
15- This commitment to bipartisan engagement includes pushing to prevent another senseless government shutdown. I support discussions about strengthening our security, but we can do so without shuttering the government and subjecting the federal workforce to additional pain.
14- We need to focus on substantive, evidence-based policy—not just rhetoric. During my first month in Congress, I’ve participated in bipartisan discussions on issues as vital as the security of our borders and ports of entry, including at the White House.
13-However in Central Virginia, I have heard from many farmers about the negative effects of the ongoing trade war. As we approach planting season, farmers desperately need certainty, &amp; I hope the administration will help provide the necessary assistance to sustain farm families.
12- As a member of the @HouseAgDems, I wanted to hear more from the President about his priorities for our rural communities. In his speech, the President did discuss ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China.
11- And as a member of the @HouseForeign Affairs Committee, I will continue to stress the vital work of the diplomatic and intelligence communities, because I am concerned about the President’s continued criticism of these dedicated public servants.
10- By championing strong global partnerships, we can continue to keep our communities safe.
9- President Trump also addressed our national security priorities. As a former CIA case officer, I will continue to support a robust national security strategy, and we need to make sure this strategy includes working with our allies to promote global stability.
8- While I agree with this priority, we must also protect reliable healthcare coverage for millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.
7- The President also rightfully discussed the staggering costs of prescription drugs. We need to work together to reduce prices, because working families, the elderly, and the disabled should never have to choose between remaining healthy and putting food on the table.
6- Last week, I called on House leadership to prioritize infrastructure improvements, so we can repair roads and bridges, strengthen broadband internet access, and modernize transportation networks.
5- I agree that we must promote job growth and economic development by investing in infrastructure in Central Virginia and across the country.
4- Tonight, President Trump advocated for increased bipartisanship—and I hope he intends to follow through on this commitment with concrete actions. In his speech, the President spoke about the need to pursue a bold, bipartisan infrastructure package.
3- Instead, it has fostered distrust in our system of government—and the record-long government shutdown was a testament to Washington’s ineptitude. The people of #VA07 just want us to do our jobs.
2- For Central Virginians, this brand of politics has not contributed in any meaningful way to lowering healthcare costs, increasing economic opportunity, or supporting the next generation of workers.
1- My thoughts on tonight’s State of the Union:		Across the country, Americans have witnessed the detrimental effects of hyper-partisanship.
My thoughts ahead of the #SOTU tonight ⬇️ I hope to hear the President discuss improving our infrastructure (especially rural broadband access), lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and strengthening our national security. https://t.co/SMkSctTHGY

Federal employees in Central Virginia and across the country have experienced severe financial pain at the hands of hyper-partisanship, and these public servants deserve much better from their elected officials. (4/4)
Since the shutdown began, I have repeatedly voted for bipartisan funding bills that would restore the function of critical departments and agencies. I’ve pushed for bipartisan discussions, and today I am encouraged by signs that good-faith conversations are moving forward. (3/4)
With today’s announcement, we are one step closer to ending the shutdown. Now, Democrats and Republicans must work together to fully reopen our government and make sure the spiraling chaos of the past 35 days cannot happen again in a mere three weeks. (2/4)
There is no question that the shutdown has put our federal workforce, national security, and overall economy at serious risk. (1/4)

Last week, I sent a letter requesting that my federal salary be withheld until the government is fully reopened. It is our job to keep the government funded, and now end this shutdown, and we shouldn't get paid until we do. https://t.co/uDQ7xLZeFy
And H.R. 211, led by @RepSchrader, would reduce the rate of pay for Members of Congress if a shutdown occurs— because if the House, in concert with the Senate and POTUS, cannot keep our government open, officials shouldn’t expect a full taxpayer-funded paycheck until they do.
H.R. 67, led by @RepDonBeyer, is a bipartisan bill that would require that federal employees unpaid during the shutdown would receive their pay once the shutdown ends. The havoc caused by the shutdown is bad enough, but ensuring federal employees receive their salaries is vital.
These two bills would make sure: 		1. Federal workers receive backpay once the shutdown ends, and 		2. Member of Congress don't receive their regular salaries in a shutdown.
And because I feel strongly that federal employees and the very function of our government should not be bargaining chips, on my first day in Congress, I also co-sponsored two bills that would help address this increasingly serious situation.
On my first day in Congress, I voted for, and the House passed, legislation with bipartisan support that would have funded the government and ended the shutdown, but so far, the Senate will not take it up.
The shutdown continues to wreak havoc on our security, economy, federal employees, and government services— and it's unacceptable.
