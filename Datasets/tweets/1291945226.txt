@seanhannity also has to plug in photo clips that have already been all over twitter. Can't even give credit to the originating agency that reported it.
AGAIN @seanhannity is days behind in the news. OLD NEWS. Sean knows very little when it comes to REAL CONSERVATISM. Go to @RMConservative for minute, hourly and daily news concerning the border, along with THE REAL ISSUES. Something that MAGA @realDonaldTrump needs to do.... https://t.co/pqu82SaiSp
NEWS that you Won't Get from @seanhannity and the REST of the SO CALLED conservatives. If you want to get the REAL FACTS you need to follow Ryan, along with The REAL CONSERVATIVE Daniel Horowitz @RMConservative https://t.co/isZ3A5fwCN
From late November, 2018-Just 7 Days ago, DC, The Media, and The MAGA Heads were in EMERGENCY MODE. And while there is an emergency @ the border, MAGA Great @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse WILL NOT ADDRESS the REAL emergency as to what is being done to HANDLE THE CARTELS-FACT https://t.co/jzXX0l2cmt
@RMConservative @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Would have everyone believe that a few miles of wall and the national emergency is the REAL FIX for keeping the citizens of the US safe. And most have got sucked in to this belief. MAGA CRAZY All for VOTES.. The Cartels haven't been addressed.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Would have everyone believe that a few miles of wall and the national emergency is the REAL FIX for keeping the citizens of the US safe. And most have got sucked in to this belief. MAGA CRAZY All for VOTES.. The Cartels haven't been addressed. https://t.co/372oVe6OvH
@RMConservative interviews Hidalgo County New Mexico Commissioner on the Dangers to Ranchers &amp; Families when Cartel runners march onto US Soil to deliver the goods. And what is @realDonaldTrump @POTUS doing about it? Nothing! Maybe the President needs to start listening to facts! https://t.co/nOS0xrUyuG
Sprinkler Effect. Spreading a large caravan into smaller ones that can easily get migrants into the U.S. Much what is taking place at Hidalgo County New Mexico. Once @ the New Mexico Border with little support 4 Sheriffs, processing begins, while drug runners do their thing. https://t.co/U1opJIrA1P
@RMConservative Great Show Today Daniel.....
@RepChipRoy @RepMarkGreen @SecPompeo Any updates???
RT @TheNoahRing: There is a $500 reward for anyone who can identify this man... please Rt so he can be brought to justice https://t.co/w6Li…
Why would @VP Bring back this guy, when all he did was avoid immigration all the way to his 1st exit? https://t.co/ZUtr1zxKZJ
What will the Verdict be???? @brandondarby @RMConservative https://t.co/X9m7VEIwyA
@MonicaBergeron @ManFromMarina @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Exactly where is this? Eastern Border with Texas? Or Western Border with Arizona? Or Central New Mexico Border?
It's a SHAME @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse that this is continuing to happen,in Arizona, New Mexico. Cartels/Runners crossing on Private Owners Property. DECLARE these Cartels as International Terrorists. Are You Just Focused on WALLS?  https://t.co/aXnqYofsur
In Arizona @brandondarby @RMConservative @chiproytx @DanCrenshawTX https://t.co/aXnqYofsur
@ABC13Miya @abc13houston AMEN!!!
@brandondarby @chiproytx Brandon, can you tell us where the wall was built @ in New Mexico that the President has been tweeting about? Was it in the East Sector connecting to Texas? Or was it at the Western Sector @ the Arizona border? As You Know, Hidalgo County New Mexico is getting HIT HARD? Thanks
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, while you're at it, please INSTRUCT Mr. Pompeo to Declare the Mexican Drug Cartels as International Terrorist Organizations. Hidalgo County New Mexico is being terrorized regularly by Cartels on US SOIL - FACT. They need MILITARY SUPPORT ASAP
@realDonaldTrump We don't know where this is at. We do know this. It isn't at the border @ Hidalgo County New Mexico where Cartels ARE ON US SOIL running their Drugs just south of the I10 Corridor in and around Highway 9. Cartels with High Tech equipment and MULES delivering their loads. https://t.co/kqHpnTC8tM
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Cut Out The BS Mr. President!! You need to stay away from this. It has ZERO Relevance. You need to start worrying about what's going on in Hidalgo County New Mexico where Cartels are ON US SOIL running and delivering DRUGS on mules with HIGH TECH equipment just miles south of I10
Is this REAL or more fake news? https://t.co/sY5cSwWOM6
@RMConservative @jaredkushner has daddy on a wild goose chase. Keep Pressing...Keep Pressing!!!
@rosedixontx @PGutierrez630 Even Sadder is the fact that in Hidalgo County New Mexico with just (4) Sheriffs, the Cartels use their Runners and backpack mules with sophisticated technology, and march 75-100 miles north of the border to deliver their drugs just south of the I10 Corridor. 75-100 miles inland
@NateOnTheHill @RMConservative New Mexico NEEDS OUR HELP @chiproytx @RepMarkGreen @RepDanCrenshaw
ALL Conservatives NEED to READ this.... https://t.co/OUJ1FunsyV
@ShannonJoyRadio @RMConservative He'll LOSE My Vote in 2020 if he does this....
@Lillianlm2 @SebGorka 100% Correct
I believe what @BensmanTodd Calls "The Sprinkler Head Effect" Spread them Out into much smaller Caravans so they can enter the US in Smaller Numbers for aka "Catch &amp; Release" @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @RepChipRoy @RepDanCrenshaw @RepMarkGreen

What the MAJOR News Won't tell Everyone. Straight from the horses mouth. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP @chiproytx @RepMarkGreen @RepDanCrenshaw https://t.co/Xbdc18hcBy
New Mexico EXPOSED Can't Wait to hear what @SenatorTomUdall &amp; @GovMLG has to say. Cartel Runners entering the border at Hidalgo County marching with pack mules 75-100 north just south of the I10 Corridor to drop off and deliver their loads. Very Interesting!!!
@brandondarby Great Work Brandon!!! Just wait until the bomb drops on what is going on in Hidalgo County New Mexico. Cartel Drug Runners with Pack Mules marching into the county 75-100 miles just south of the I10 corridor to drop off their loads. https://t.co/Xbdc18hcBy
@RepChipRoy @RepMarkGreen @SecPompeo Just heard today that Cartel Runners in Hidalgo County New Mexico are entering at their border with pack mules and moving 75-100 miles north to just south of the I10 corridor to drop off their loads while agents and sherrifs (just 4) are attending to the influx of migrants-FACT
@BensmanTodd @RMConservative @CIS_org Great Work Todd!!! Greatly Appreciated!!!

RT @REV6_7_8: Well Kavanaugh doesn't seem to be so Conservative. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse What say you? Another BRIGHT move made…
RT @REV6_7_8: It is So Great to see our Texas Rep. @chiproytx working very hard to point out what needs to be done at the southern borders…
@Quarterback_USA @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You Forgot New Mexico....New Mexico is a Sanctuary State and is Suing to Block Walls in their State. Other than that....100% Correct
@GOP @SteveScalise AMEN Sir!!! Thank You Rep. @SteveScalise
It is So Great to see our Texas Rep. @chiproytx working very hard to point out what needs to be done at the southern borders with Mexico!!! He understands 100%. Declare the Mexican Drug Cartels @ Foreign Terrorists!!! Right??? @RMConservative https://t.co/bbgmF0vRf0
@RepChipRoy Thank You Sir!!! 100% Correct. Keep up the Excellent Work and Please keep us informed!!! Gods Blessings!!!
@realDonaldTrump In what section of New Mexico Mr. President? Just west of the Texas border or at the Western New Mexico border near Arizona? How many miles? Please elaborate..... @RMConservative Do you have any information?
@RMConservative Well Kavanaugh doesn't seem to be so Conservative. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse What say you? Another BRIGHT move made by a RINO RUN administration. Had better get your concession speech ready when your National Emergency FAILS at the SCOTUS aka Roberts &amp; Kavanaugh
Well Kavanaugh doesn't seem to be so Conservative. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse What say you? Another BRIGHT move made by a RINO RUN administration. Had better get your concession speech ready when your National Emergency FAILS at the SCOTUS aka Roberts &amp; Kavanaugh https://t.co/sz9cwKihxU
More SMOKE &amp; MIRRORS from @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Migrants are NOW STORMING the Texas &amp; other Nearby Borders since Mexico SHUT DOWN their Detention Center. CATCH &amp; RELEASE.

@mitchellvii So very sorry Bill....Prayers!!!
The Detention Center across from Eagle Pass Texas has been shut down and NOW Migrants are Storming the Texas Border. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP @GregAbbott_TX @chiproytx @RepDanCrenshaw  Guess the deal with Mexico broke down What's NEXT?@brandondarby @RMConservative
IF @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse thinks the SCOTUS will be a SLAM DUNK with both Kavanaugh &amp; Roberts, he's got another thing coming. It's not going to be that easy. Here lately the two have been favoring the liberal side more than the conservative side. Conservative Side??? https://t.co/XqYQV9gJeh
The President @realDonaldTrump @POTUS and @WhiteHouse has some pretty DUMB advisers, or just maybe...he got his advice directly from the Never Trumper G.W. Bush himself. The President will then COP OUT and say that he tried his best. From a Texas Trump Voter. @RMConservative
I'm not sure who @realDonaldTrump @POTUS was listening to on Kavanaugh. In any case, the President might meet his match in the National Emergency Case when it goes to the SCOTUS. Both under the Bush Family, along with recently appointed William Barr as AG....Makes one wonder!!! https://t.co/KEVJglgnKs
@tedcruz NOPE.....I signed the REAL @USTermLimits &amp; @COSProject Politicians and Politics need not apply.....
@KPRC2 Sell New Mexico back to Old Mexico. They have nothing to offer except illegals....
Right Across The Texas Border. Let's see how this works @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @WhiteHouse @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx @brandondarby @RMConservative Disperse &amp; Combine into smaller caravans that will go into more porous areas of the border aka New Mexico's Sanctuary State. https://t.co/0sc9RiemGR
@JohnCornyn How many of those $$$$$ lined your pockets RINO? It has long been known that the Cartels have been lining the pockets of politicians at the city/county/state and federal level.....Your time is up in 2020

Nothing Else Needs To Be SAID @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx @WhiteHouse New Mexico is in DIRE STRAITS. FACT https://t.co/3pyYX57buR
SMOKE &amp; MIRRORS. The @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse would have everyone believe that THE PLAN is working. Nothing more than the US &amp; Mexico now dispersing the caravans into smaller ones so that the migrants can enter the US in smaller groups. CATCH &amp; RELEASE is still RAMPANT https://t.co/2cCqgetKKX
Is this TRUE @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx We are now going to give TPS to Venezuelans?
@SonnyJackson2 @ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump @charliekirk11 @jasoninthehouse @BuckSexton @FoxNews Don't be to sure of that.....Remember, a couple of months ago the @POTUS pissed off Chief Justice Roberts over comments that Trump made about the liberal lower court judges. That may come back to bite him hard.
@mitchellvii Praise The Lord!!!
@KPRC2 ASK Mayor @SylvesterTurner He knows....He never met his 2015 Campaign Commitment!!! They're all over....Except in his neighborhood where he lives. FACT
@BorderNarcotics @BreitbartNews I'm not pointing fingers. I remember a couple of weeks ago that there was testimony in the El Chapo trial where there were payoffs to US Politicians, and that the courtroom was cleared. I haven't heard or saw anything in the news. Supposedly agents were sent to investigate.
@BorderNarcotics @BreitbartNews My point is that the verbiage from Border Narcotics makes a statement that: Because Paul Ryan Was Paid Off By Mexican Officials. I did not see any mention of it in the Breitbart Article. Is this just an opinion? I didn't and still don't like RINO Paul Ryan. However, FACTS are Key
@BorderNarcotics @BreitbartNews I did not see anywhere in the article where Paul Ryan was paid off by Mexican officials. Please elaborate.....
@BensmanTodd @RMConservative Guess they don't have it that bad after all.....Waiting on a Cartel Job!!!
It's Not Going To Br Too Long @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx @brandondarby @RMConservative Tempers are going to explode on both sides. https://t.co/3CmlmfMDUD

@BorderNarcotics Yes I am....However, he needs to take it to the next level....Take it to the Drug Cartels, with our military!!!

@MichaelDerderi4 @brandondarby @RealSaavedra @POTUS @realDonaldTrump AMEN Brother....AMEN!!! Need to do it ASAP....Not wait until a measly 55-Miles of Wall is Built. The Wall is a Deterrent Only.....And a Band-Aid.....@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse WAKE UP!!!
@realDonaldTrump @ChaskaDaisy @KimStrassel @WSJ Time to CLEAN HOUSE.....
@AmbJohnBolton Will they now be heading to the U.S. Ambassador?
@nickmon1112 @pbeard1975 @SpeakerPelosi Yeah....Why??? Happy Thanksgiving????
@RealSaavedra @SpeakerPelosi Yeah.....Why did you???
@DanCrenshawTX @MsBee777 What about the Cartels Representative? What the PLAN for handling THEM? Care to elaborate?
@BorderNarcotics What about the RINO'S?????
@GregAbbott_TX AMEN!!! 09/24/2002
@MichaelDerderi4 @brandondarby @RealSaavedra EXACTLY...The BILLIONS that the US has given to Mexico goes right into the pockets of the CARTELS. The Mexican President just recently stated the the war with the cartels was over. Surrendering and Admitting DEFEAT!!! The US @POTUS @realDonaldTrump need to put Boots On The Ground
In the SANCTUARY STATE of North Carolina. There's a lot more than just these (6) in the U.S. A LOT MORE....https://t.co/HDZaqlDi2z
@brandondarby And if the U.S. Government doesn't wake up soon, the Cartels which already have a presence in the U.S. will start doing the same thing here and the journalists that spend 24/7 propping up those same members of government will lose their control. By then it will be too late.
@brandondarby Perspective? Understood...However, the truth of it is playing out right in front of us. 3rd World Dictatorships thrive on the fact that they have total control over everything. Mexico is no different. The CARTELS run the government. Have been for a long time.
@BorderNarcotics @bluelivesmtr Lett her try. She has ZERO Statistics to back up the Claim. Thugs and Murderers don't buy/get their guns legally. Most get theirs on the black market via gun runners. That's not an emergency. That's not taking care of business.
@GregAbbott_TX Now the Mayor @SylvesterTurner is filing yet again another lawsuit claiming that its unconstitutional. This has been going on way too long. Poor management at its worst.
@GregAbbott_TX Amen Governor!!! I live in the Houston/Harris County area and drive downtown often. The wasteful spending is rampant. Potholes everywhere, new pet projects taking place, and back in November, the City of Houston voters approved paying our firefighters more in salary,
@RealMattCouch Our President doesn't really need any practice, but what the hell???
TRUTH..... https://t.co/olNXM93Lo8
@BorderNarcotics @NTDTV Great Work Everyone!!! Stay Safe &amp; Gods Blessings!!!
@RMConservative https://t.co/H91IB4p8nK
@BensmanTodd Our Government at their best. I'd start boxing it up and sending it directly to and to the attention of @realDonaldTrump
@RMConservative @brandondarby @RestiveRabble The bill signed is nothing more than a prop for his MAGA &amp; RINO base. 55-Miles of nothing more than fence will ever solve this problem. Do we know if he has even signed a National Emergency yet?
@WhiteHouse And what are the simple plans? I have one better.STOP THE CARTELS. In their TRACKS. If we can spend TRILLIONS in Afghanistan, we can spend a lot less by bringing our military home and take care of business in MEXICO, instead of giving them BILLIONS....Please reply with yours
@realDonaldTrump What about the Cartels? The WALL Saga is Over. Tell your Voters what your plan is for handling the Cartels? Do You have one Mr. President?
@JohnCornyn Better Yet.....Why don't we put the Various Drug Cartels of Mexico on One Side and The Total Number of US Deaths on the other side from each? You are a REAL piece of work!!!
@politico WE need a BULLDOG!!!
Mr. President @POTUS @realDonaldTrump DON"T EVER FORGET THIS!!! You Sir GOT PLAYED. It's time to surround yourself with The GOOD Ones...RINO'S need not APPLY.....If you believe that the RINO'S are supporting you, then I Pray for you as I do everyday @VP @DanCrenshawTX @chiproytx https://t.co/3owzb1rV8L
DRUNK &amp; ALZHEIMER'S https://t.co/p3r2uelII8

U won't see this on the FAKE News Channels, including @FoxNews This is from a local ABC affiliate. If @realDonaldTrump @POTUS doesn't TAKE CONTROL ASAP, 2020 will make little difference. @VP @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx @brandondarby @RMConservative I no longer deal with RINO'S https://t.co/w6y3To0MIi
Governor @GregAbbott_TX I appreciate EVERYTHING that you are doing, along with ALL of the enforcement personnel risking their lives to KEEP TEXAS SAFE. Gods Blessings!!! Mr. President @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You know what YOU NEED TO DO!!! We're BEHIND YOU!!! https://t.co/HBA99ukQaU
Governor @GregAbbott_TX While that is good news, it's only a Symptom of the Problem. The ROOT CAUSE are the Drug Cartels. The Billions that the US has given both South America/Mexico are just LINING their POCKETBOOKS. Until @realDonaldTrump @POTUS addresses the REAL Problem. FACT https://t.co/yiqdWBnC0Y
He's BACK!!! https://t.co/FpEQL1rwuU

When You REMOVE POLITICS from The EQUATION.....The U.S. WINS!!! Mr. President @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx My LAST QUOTE for a while.....I'm going outdoors and PULL SOME WEEDS....AT THE ROOT. Something that ya'll need to DO!!! @RMConservative https://t.co/0NJaFrlnHP
Yes @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP WHY NOT??? Remove all aspects of the RINO'S in Your administration and Do What's Right!!! The BATTLE is RIGHT ACROSS THE BORDER and have already INFILTRATED ON OUR SOIL. TAKE OUR GREAT MILITARY and PUT THEM in THE BATTLE and LET THEM CLEAN HOUSE!!! https://t.co/KfqKTUsCu3
Your aspirations of becoming the next RINO @senatemajldr are fading in the wind, along with the RINO Party!!! https://t.co/wi1Pz2cELM
Until then you had better start worrying about November. Your $$$$$ base in many of the counties are going BLUE. That tells me that people are getting tired of your rhetoric, grandstanding and propping decade after decade. https://t.co/wi1Pz2cELM
GET OFF YOUR ASS @JohnCornyn and do something about it. Instead of propping with all of these posts, that most people are already aware of, start posting about what YOU are going to DO!!! https://t.co/wi1Pz2cELM
@realDonaldTrump @VP @RepDanCrenshaw @chiproytx and ALL Conservatives in Congress, STEP UP TO THE PLATE and Do What's Right!!! We can go into other countries around the world and spend TRILLIONS. This country is being PLAYED with $$$$$ right in our own BACKYARD. Whose WINNING??? https://t.co/RxcqzDZpVF
It has been said that a Country will IMPLODE from WITHIN to its OWN Demise. Taking place right NOW in front of our OWN EYES!!! NOW the EXTERNAL FORCES are COMING IN and FINISHING THE JOB...FACT!!! https://t.co/RxcqzDZpVF
@chiproytx TRUTH.....Thank You Sir!!!
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump You need to quit listening and associating with the RINO's in Congress and Take the battle to Mexico. Go DIRECTLY TO THE ROOT and TAKE THEM OUT....PERIOD!!! https://t.co/RxcqzDZpVF
Congress can spend TRILLIONS in Afghanistan for what? And they don't have the BALLS to take the real BATTLE to our back yard in Mexico claiming We Have To Fight Them On Their SOIL, Not OURS. DECADES of PROBLEMS now folding out ON OUR SOIL. https://t.co/RxcqzDZpVF
The people living in and around the southern border aren't stupid Senator. They've been living with this for decades while all of the RINO's grandstand for a few minutes of propping at the border with the rest of your sidekick RINO's and conservative wannabe @seanhannity https://t.co/RxcqzDZpVF
MS-13 Gangs are just a symptom of the real problem!!!	Unless the President takes executive action invoking 10 USC Code 284 and Declares WAR against the Cartels it will NEVER go away. Neither will the $10B given to Mexico/South America. Nothing but a PAYOFF to the Cartels. FACT https://t.co/nX00Ffp31e
@outdoorsie500 @JohnCornyn Yeah RINO @JohnCornyn WHEN? Your TIME is UP in November....
HE's BACK!!! @SylvesterTurner https://t.co/RIoZqPLtE3
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump Is that $5B given to Mexico back in Dec. 2018 going towards Building A Wall @ the Southern Mexico Border to stop the influx of migrants from coming into Mexico? .@RMConservative @chiproytx @RepDanCrenshaw @brandondarby https://t.co/qwLj40Svb6
@AnnCoulter By Ann!!! BLOCKED!!!
@chiproytx AMEN.....Keep Fighting!!! @brandondarby
With the Exception of having a group of Strong Fiscal Conservatives, and also as a minority within the RINO Party, There really isn't a Republican Party anymore, continuing to move more left at every move. A sign that they are struggling with an identity crisis of their own. https://t.co/NLMF2UbgfM
What you won't see on regular media outlets, including FOX, along with urine sucking @ElrushboRush &amp; gas snorting @seanhannity These three are no different than the rest of the FAKE News Outlets. In the end, RINO'S and their Sidekicks in the Democrat Party remain a stronghold https://t.co/JHxt5FhTh8
@_LoveLike_JESUS AMEN......
@BorderNarcotics @BreitbartNews If there was no Poison Pills as what was originally spread, then I wished that Our President @realDonaldTrump would have said as such in this morning's address. Squash It!!! I still reserve the right to ?????
@ArtAcevedo Thank You Chief!!! Gods Blessings!!!
I HOPE &amp; PRAY Mr. President @realDonaldTrump @VP that you will USE ALL Powers under your authority. ALL POWERS!!! Bleeding if not attended to causes infection, infection causes gangrene. THE CARTELS MUST BE DEALT WITH.....STOPPED in their TRACKS!!! https://t.co/upBSyfk4eQ
This gentleman is the REAL DEAL..... https://t.co/zIA1Bg65i6
@peterboykin @PGutierrez630 In my opinion, the President should have stated as such in his address this morning...
@realDonaldTrump I urge you to read....From a Texas Voter.... https://t.co/qVWOq4mSqg
@PDeplorablegirl @Jali_Cat @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @POTUS The New Attorney General can take care of that....
@HoustonFire @KitCorcoran Great Job Everyone!!! Stay Safe &amp; God Bless!!!
@elpasotimes That's expected from a Democratic City. CARTEL PAYOFFS!!!
@NevadaJack2 @ray_mullenix The President should have framed it better to let his voters know that the wall and border security was only the 1st Step in the process. We all know that walls don't win the battle. Military action does and should be used. We've given both Mexico/Southern America plenty $$$$$
This right here is TRUTH @seanhannity President Trump should tell his voters that he is going to use the military and clean up the cartels. They're the ones that have escalated this at the border all for the $$$$$$ and it makes no difference where they come from @RMConservative https://t.co/2THmYIQnil
@ArtAcevedo Chief, I applaud your candid response into the investigation. It reminds me not to be quick to judge and just as important, one bad apple doesn't make the rest of the apples rotten. Thank You again chief for all that you do and that of all HPD. God Bless!!!
@SylvesterTurner @RODEOHOUSTON @houstonpolice @DowntownHouston You had better enjoy this one Mayor. It'll be your last one!!!
@SenTedCruz @MonicaH028 Then why is the President signing it, which is basically an acceptance, then turn around and filing a national emergency rejecting it? $$$$$ and a wall are mute with the poison pills in the bill. Take it to the Cartels
I've always wondered why @realDonaldTrump never has invited his other sidekick @ElrushboRush to visit the border. Maybe it's because he would immediately get arrested by border patrol agents for lighting up one of his CUBAN cigars.... @RMConservative
Everyone including president @seanhannity are stuck on this wall. The wall is mute when 30K on their way to the border, most if not all that will be smuggled in by the cartels. You don't win battles with walls. You take it to the source with military strength @RMConservative https://t.co/in4X3qizQJ
@seanhannity Nope....Unless he also addresses how he's going to handle the cartels. Walls are a mute point. He has to go to the root cause and the cartels are the root. A wall is a deterrent not a stopper 30K Strong and they are on their way. What's a wall going to do for that number? ZILCH
@rer1333 @RMConservative @realDonaldTrump He's no match for PHONY CONSERVATIVES @seanhannity &amp; @ElrushboRush Trump listens to them...does what they say...then rewards them from both sides...one with urine and the other with gas...then they switch
@ChristineMarieB @RMConservative And RINO Republicans Tooo
@RMConservative He could still veto it and get an override, but unless he addresses the drug cartels, a wall is a mute point. You don't win a war with walls. The cartel is one beefed up army supported by the same countries that are rushing people through our borders with the $$$$ from the US
YOU GOT THAT @realDonaldTrump You had better read that bill yourself and not worry about anyone on your staff reading it. They don't even know what a "POISON PILL" looks like. You've got a lot of people pissed right now, so stay off the campaign trail, especially here in Texas. https://t.co/NIDkm9xBTH
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump If you think keeping a promise in building a wall will get you re-elected in 2020 without addressing what your intent is with the drug cartels that are smuggling in everyone, then you will be stunned in 2020 when the conservatives leave your base
@NumbersUSA @POTUS Lead by McConnell.....
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If you sign this, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose the REAL Conservative base in 2020....FACT.....From a Texas Voter. There are a very large # of conservative voters at the southern border and Texas is one of them. You had look @ all the poison pills first. We're WATCHING
@RMConservative Daniel....Will he invoke 10 USC Code284 in the NE? Will he take control of the states national guard and out of the hands of the governors? The wall is important, but a mute point as each of the counties/cities mayors can veto the wall. The real war is with the cartels
@RMConservative It's a Very Sad Day!!! Daniel
@seanhannity Go back to smelling on @realDonaldTrump backside....From a REAL Texas Independent Conservative Voter.....
@HobbdF @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/qgBRuwZrrA
@HobbdF @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It was reported this afternoon that he will sign and declare a national state of emergency....
@RandPaul Senator you need to take a week and spend time with all of the agents all the way from Texas to California and see what they're facing on a daily basis. There's a War between the Mexican Drug Cartels and our Agents and Law Enforcement/Military personnel. YOU JUST DON'T GET IT!!!
@seanhannity Once again YOU'RE WRONG!!! It's a WAR with the MEXICAN CARTELS....YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.....Stay in NY!!! Your no more a conservative than @senatemajldr Neither is @ElrushboRush Might work in politics, but not in the real world. Ya'll need to start listening to @RMConservative
@RepChipRoy @DailyCaller I've had it with the Republicans in Congress, BUT 100% Support Yours and @RepDanCrenshaw efforts and ALL CONSERVATIVES in congress. NO LONGER will I VOTE for RINO'S in CONGRESS. Not Going To Happen. Hearing from @RMConservative that 30K are on their way. Will a WALL stop THEM? NO
@seanhannity GO TO HELL @seanhannity Declaring a National Emergency will not STOP the 30K that are on their way. I have had enough of YOU &amp; @ElrushboRush  Neither of you have to live on the border &amp; experience this everyday. It's no longer a WALL. It's a WAR with the CARTELS. I'm done with it
National Emergency @realDonaldTrump @VP @JohnCornyn @chiproytx @RepDanCrenshaw 30K heading their way to the Southern Border. I call it WAR. USE 10 USC Code 284 and Take the WAR to Mexico/Cartels. 30K will be able to tear down that wall very quickly. Cut the BS!!! https://t.co/nXlR4CDgXn
BS @realDonaldTrump @VP @ElrushboRush @seanhannity RINO's @JohnCornyn @GOPLeader Cheap Way Out.None of YOU live in the area where this is playing out.A national emergency will get held up in the courts.There is a WAR @ the Border.Take the WAR to the Cartels. FIX THE POLICIES https://t.co/HtdfuRF3QE
@GregAbbott_TX @brandondarby Mr. Governor, Please readdress this with AMAZON and persuade them to move to The Great State of Texas!!!
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC If you're the only senator, and I think you are that stands with our President, that's great. It shows. The president needs to veto this bill, full of CANNOTS, and then force the hands of congress to override, and go it alone, with Yours &amp; Others Support https://t.co/chMWDkyoA2
Mr. President @realDonaldTrump @VP VETO the current BILL and FORCE the RINO'S in Congress to show their hands!!! Then go it alone and do what must be done anyway. With the exception of The Conservatives in Congress, the rest of the RINO's were never going to support you. FACT
@DonaldJTrumpJr We need to take the U.S. Military to the Cartels. They're the ones in charge of Mexico, and are in fact in charge of the southern border.....FACT. Walls will deter, but not stop. Military Action will clean it up....
Well...Well...Well Mr. President @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You may need to ask @SenFeinstein for a refund too..... https://t.co/JK4S64Yhql
HEY @BetoORourke Why the FENCE around your party? Afraid of anyone? https://t.co/jCAQrYvx8f
@N1snipe_rv @pplenkie What we need is Military Action against the Drug Cartels.....NOW!!! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump I implore you to read the final bill very carefully. While it may all be FAKE NEWS, it was reported by a couple of sites, that there may be indeed POISON PILLS in it. Take the extra time for everyone to review closely, even if it means another CR....
IF This Is TRUE, we don't need a CR.....SHUT IT DOWN!!! @chiproytx @RepDanCrenshaw @RMConservative @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/yZ5M0mQ92B

@realDonaldTrump NO MORE MONEY TO SANCTUARY CALIFORNIA.....ZERO.....
@marklutchman ME.....
@realDonaldTrump FINISH THE JOB!!! Not just a deterrent wall, but ALL OF THE FAILING POLICIES and THE CARTELS..... https://t.co/NoBDgqIPyy
@realDonaldTrump Please take care of the rest of the job.....Take the Drug Cartels out. Also, take care of the policies.... https://t.co/r7numnAAiZ
@realDonaldTrump Take El Chapo's assets and finish the wall and TAKE OUT the Cartels. The cartels should be declared and treated as TERRORISTS!!! Take them out for good!!!
@realDonaldTrump Now take care of Mexico and get rid of the cartels. If the US doesn't go to the root and remove them, everything being done to deter is wasted. If the US can spend TRILLIONS in Afghanistan for 17-Years, it can easily take out the cartels for a lot less and closer to home.
@seanhannity Yes. Only if his end game is to completely take out the cartels. The cartels have ALL control. They must be taken out. He needs to meet with the president of mexico and get it done.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP THE CARTELS now have CONTROL of the SOUTHERN BORDER in MORE WAYS THAN ONE.....Sovereignty GONE in THE SOUTH. FACE THE FACTS: A Wall/Barrier/Fence CAN'T be built fast enough to cover this. The 2nd WAVE is now headed to Tijuana. Use YOUR Executive Powers https://t.co/trjuPql8bQ

Well...Well...Well. What do we have here? Immigration Fraud? https://t.co/Y1RZBjCJd8
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP Mr. President you have some explaining to do. In just less than 60-Days ago,YOU gave Central America/Mexico $10B.WHY?FOR WHAT? In almost that same amount of time, the southern border gets $1.375B. I VOTED for You. The US is NO LONGER a Sovereign Nation
The Southern Border gets $1.375B. Yet in December, 2018 the US gives Central America/Mexico $10B. FOR WHAT? The CARTELS that are running Mexico? Along with the fact that the Cartels are now operating in the US....On OUR SOIL... https://t.co/1qhMS1LpVI https://t.co/LBUsO3g1iA

@realDonaldTrump Use 10 U.S. Code § 284 - Support for counterdrug activities and activities to counter transnational organized crime https://t.co/pLBxkgz4zK
At a minimum @realDonaldTrump needs to:	*Declare the Mexican Drug Cartels as Terrorists	*Declare a National State of Emergency Based on the above	*Take control of the states national guard personnel	*Move ALL military personnel to the border	*Use executive actions necessary https://t.co/WjEcXLkRvo
Right Now, It's not looking Good at All.If what we are hearing is true, then @realDonaldTrump has a tough decision to make.Right now it's not about a wall/barriers. It's ALL about what is going to be done about Battling the DRUG CARTELS. That right there is NATIONAL EMERGENCY 1/2 https://t.co/pLBxkgz4zK
@JohnCornyn FINISH the Job.....

@MottdeWitt @GregAbbott_TX @SylvesterTurner @HarrisCountyTAC Republican and/or Democrat...Doesn't make any difference.

@jbillo42 @SenatorTomUdall @POTUS Wannabe cowBOY @SenatorTomUdall doesn't care what people think. Just look at what's happening in their Sanctuary State of NM. Just yesterday, the governor ordered the State National Guard away from their border. They let them all in, even the sick and diseased ones.
@TeamBettencourt @HoustonChron Keep it up @TeamBettencourt It's not the taxpayers fault that cities and counties can't manage their budget and finances. Let the PEOPLE have their say.... 2.5% CAP
@marklutchman @LuvmyCountry52 AMEN....
@jbillo42 @RedNationRising Yes. It also happened here in Texas in 18. Harris County went completely Blue for the 1st time. Voter Fraud? So now, we have Dallas/Ft. Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston, along with 12 counties @ the border that are blue. Most of Texas remains RED. I too have hope for 2020.
@GregAbbott_TX It isn't the taxpayers fault that city and counties can't manage their budgets. Just ask @SylvesterTurner &amp; @HarrisCountyTAC TOP HEAVY @ The TOP
@JacksonLeeTX18 @ArtAcevedo @HouseDemocrats @HouseJudiciary @NRA @JudiciaryGOP Just where did these gangs originate????
@jbillo42 @RedNationRising So Very...Very Sad Sir!!! I personally don't have anything against the citizens of NM. It's just a shame that those running the state won't protect its citizens. Elected official take an oath to serve &amp; protect. God Bless!!! The citizens in NM will be in my prayers!!!

@CNNPolitics I hope all of the Democrats in Congress watch. Mr. Schultz is going to tell it like it is. I hope he runs as an independent in 2020
@ManuelPadillaJr Thank You Sir for ALL that You and ALL that the border agents do in helping to keep our southern border(s) safe. God Bless!!!
@SenatorTomUdall @POTUS I hope you're speaking for your own people of NM, and not for the rest of the country especially your neighbor to the east in Texas. We don't need your advice.
Since @SpeakerPelosi feels that walls are immoral, I'd say let them fall. All the way West to the ocean. I support our CBP's all along the southern border and thank them for what they do 100%. Nancy needs to listen and do the right thing. @realDonaldTrump @VP https://t.co/WCPaTOCWJ1

@JohnCornyn Senator, why not be truthful and let your constituents know exactly what you are going to do to keep The Great State of Texas safe and protected from the emergency situation at the Texas Border? You took an oath.
@realDonaldTrump @VP Well here you go folks..... It's pretty much official. RINO's with @JohnCornyn move to the Left.....CRUSH THEM Mr. President..... https://t.co/w9EzDASfX5
@HobbdF @SebGorka @TheDemocrats I pray that you're right sir. They have to get the voter fraud fixed, then declare the mexican drug cartels as terrorist, and take it to mexico directly. Make no mistake, I'm in no way giving up and never will. Our elected officials took an oath to serve and protect its people.
2/2 RINO’s stay in hiding	SCOTUS will agree with 5th Circuit, override the 5th Circuit or send it back to the 5th Circuit	More to be revealed @realDonaldTrump @VP
1/2 PREDICTION:	POTUS Declares a National State of Emergency – RINO’s go Running	Democrats file a lawsuit	Since most of the $$$$ are destined for Texas it will go to the 5th District Court	5th District Court will agree with declaration	Democrats will appeal to SCOTUS

@SebGorka AMEN....GOD WINS!!!
@SebGorka @HobbdF @TheDemocrats Yes...And it's going to get worse. The Republicans have no spine to stand up and fight, and I'm afraid it will be their demise going forward and into 2020. The Democrats mean business and they're not backing down one iota.....
@realDonaldTrump @VP Where are ALL of the TRUMP supporting REPUBLICANS on the eve of the SOTU? They're ALL in HIDING @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPLeader @JohnCornyn &amp; The Rest of the RINOs NO BALLS!!!
@JohnCornyn NO BALLS Republican RINOs are Destroying the party. YOU Senator are one of them. I didn't vote for you in the last election and won't again.The State of Texas is slowly turning BLUE. Illegal Voting &amp; Fraud? You Bet.Your party has NO BALLS to fight, and it will all be lost in 2020
Top 25 RINOs https://t.co/IpqLgYLRTB @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @SenCoryGardner @JohnCornyn just to name a few.Republicans will lose it ALL in 2020 and so goes the party.The Democrat mean business and now they're winning bc of the NO BALLS Republicans
@ColumbiaBugle @steph93065 What @LindseyGrahamSC failed to include in his statement: he's not very optimistic about the odds of a wall funding deal with Democrats AND REPUBLICANS. The RINOS in both the house and senate went into hiding and it will be their demise in 2020 along with the Republican Party.
@RyanLeeForHou @Kim_A_Phillips @JohnKerr2017 @SylvesterTurner Unless the State takes a more serious approach in this matter, it will be too late for 2019/2020. Everyone knows that there was some hanky panky taking place in the 2018 mid-terms.Democrats are playing some nasty games and getting away with it at at the expense of the Republicans

@realDonaldTrump The only one that I see working hard for Texas is our newly elected freshman Rep. @DanCrenshawTX In the end, you are going to have to do this one alone. Border Patrol, County Sheriffs, DPS Agents along the entire southern border are BEGGING for HELP, all on deaf ears.
@realDonaldTrump With the exception of maybe @LindseyGrahamSC  that's it, and even he has been in hiding recently. The rest @senatemajldr  @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz  No Where to be found. On the House Side, where are they. Even at the State level, here in Texas @GregAbbott_TX is in hiding 2/3
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I wouldn't count on complete support from ALL Republicans. There are those out there that put their faces out there pandering and posturing just for the exposure of acting like they support ones ideas. I call them RINOS, and we are starting to see them 1/2

Yep.....PATHETIC....@brandondarby @RMConservative Get a load of this..... https://t.co/FuEf9duKCY
@GregAbbott_TX I believe that those 14 counties have a deal with the cartels to stay away from these counties. You might get in touch with the Sheriff in Cochise County of Arizona. From a Texas voter. 3/3
@GregAbbott_TX Move the security behind the blue county lines and setup road check stations @ major roads and a virtual camera border in between each check station. Let them handle the drugs, sex and human trafficking, along with the stash houses. 2/3
@GregAbbott_TX @GregAbbott_TX @realDonaldTrump @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @DanCrenshawTX @VP @brandondarby @RMConservative How is it that 14 democratic of the total 254 counties in Texas can dictate to the rest of the state what the real needs are as related to border security? 1/3
@houstonlifetv I think that the hosts of the show may have a drinking problem. On almost every show their's alcohol. Maybe HPD needs to sit out by the station and perform a breathalyzer test when they walk out. I enjoy most everything about the show, but alcohol almost every show

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, your voters are 100% behind you. Now that the government is back open, leave it open. Give them their 21-days.

@realDonaldTrump @TheReal_Hurl Mr. President, you have our support. Just please stay away from Nancy, Chuck and their party. All they are doing is dragging you down to their level. Negative tit for tats are not productive. Take it to the next level. No more haggling. No DACA. No DREAMERS 1/2
@RepFletcher I PRAY that You Will....I didn't vote for you, but have respect for you, and I hope that you meant what you said during your campaign that you do not work for the speaker.
@JacksonLeeTX18 Pretty soon you and the rest of the house dem puppets won't have to worry about it....There will be no more BS after the 21-day period is up....For both the dems and repubs....100% Guaranteed....And it won't be FAKE NEWS!!!
@DanCrenshawTX You'll soon learn that they don't mean it....He should have already declared that state of emergency....Pelosi is not going to budge...The only thing that we can hope for is that her puppets will get tired of what she has been doing to them and RECALL her position.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi You had better worry about your own self SJL and the lawsuit filed against you!!! And make sure that you do not use any of the taxpayers $$$$ as HUSH MONEY!!!
@seanhannity Pelosi - 1.....Trump via aka Jared Kushner - 0. Bad Move made by my president. DEMS now get DACA and DREAMERS wrapped up in a box and bow. Our president should have never done this. Also, if his case for declaring a state of emergency was so strong, why hasn't he already done it?

@ShepNewsTeam I feel for all those that have and are affected by the shutdown. However, who hired these people? The taxpayers didn't. The Voters didn't. @POTUS didn't. The federal government did!!! If ALL members of congress really cared, they would do their jobs. Negotiate.
@newsmax Fake Poll....Fake News...
@SenatorTomUdall @DHSgov @HHSGov @POTUS And that's the U.S. fault? They're not even legal U.S. citizens.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP So that They Can VOTE ILLEGALLY? This is what's happening at the state level. Already taking place in California. https://t.co/bDDfgpMoRi
@realDonaldTrump How is it Mr. President that the State of California have the longest border wall security and the rest of the states at the south have nothing but fences and/or none? It CANNOT be both ways....ALL or NONE....
@VP @POTUS Bring Our Troops HOME!!! And stop funding all of these countries that are just taking advantage of the U.S., including all those countries south of the U.S. Border.
@ManuelPadillaJr @CBPRGV @USCIS @JTFWest Great Job Everyone!!! Please BE SAFE and God Bless!!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Those that care have already seen these faces on the news senator....How much of the taxpayer $$$$ were spent on something that most american's have already seen. Quit grandstanding and get to work in resolving the issue at hand. Both sides...Negotiate and Compromise.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Who's negotiating?
@GOPLeader And if i'm correct, the border wall in San Diego covers more in miles than any other wall @ the southern border. Why cannot the state of Texas have the same?

@JacksonLeeTX18 Rep. Lee instead of stating "MIGHT CONSIDER" a CR, say that "THEY WILL". Both Chambers on Both sides need to LEAD and show ALL of the Voters that ya'll can work together. The voters faithfully elected Congress to LEAD not DICTATE.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP How can this happen? https://t.co/fpUfgLUPWu
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @senatemajldr Those not getting paid are not guilty and/or responsible for the shutdown. Get them back to work. Worrying about those up for re-election in 2020 is fruitless and non-warranted. It's not the base, but voters lives that are affected 2/2
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Please instruct @senatemajldr to vote in the Senate on the original budget bill that passed the house when the republicans had control in the house. Then veto that bill. I find it hard to imagine that 19 republican senators would join to override. 1/2
@tedcruz Sir....Do you support the convention of the states and the US term limits projects? If you do, announce it....If you don't, announce it. @COSProject @USTermLimits And it would be greatly appreciated if you would reply.
@GovAbbott What is the State of Texas plan for border security in the event the President's plan fails?
@KPRC2 The fact that this happened is unacceptable, but has ZERO to do with the shutdown, Read &amp; Report the whole story. TSA reports in the story it has nothing to do with the shutdown. Just knowing that it can from FAKE NEWS @CNN is fear mongering....
@SenWarren Put down your beer and get to work. Just goes to show how weak our U.S. Congress really is. ALL U.S. citizens voted for their representatives on both sides, to WORK for ALL of its Voters. Instead, we get complete gridlock. Get out of the playpen, put on your Depends and negotiate

@SpeakerPelosi @RepScottPeters @realDonaldTrump Oh...BTW were the 1.5M inactive voters that California had to remove from their voter rolls used by those crossing that bridge to vote? https://t.co/37NwyLVH6n
@SpeakerPelosi @RepScottPeters @realDonaldTrump The Sanctuary State of California appears to love catering to the Cheap Labor Slaves, as it appears to be one of the largest states that do. Does California really need that wall. You can keep the bridge. We need a government that works with one another, not against. Nice try 2/2
@SpeakerPelosi @RepScottPeters @realDonaldTrump It's quire different here in Texas. Texas has no need nor want's gangs, drugs, and for sure Cheap Labor SLAVES in their State. If the Sanctuary state of California has no need for its wall, then maybe you could make a deal. Every state is different and has it's own needs 1/2
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump BTW Senator, are you now making this an ethnic/race issue? Sure looks like it by looking and reading the link. Really? What about "Cheap Labor SLAVERY" in all of the Sanctuary cities, counties and States like NYC, California, and many others? Shame on You!!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Use the powers of the congress, negotiate and compromise. One president that has requested additional $$$ for border security, against 535 elected officials that are elected to do their jobs for their constituents. Government of The People, By The People, and For The People
@SenatorTomUdall @SenSchumer @politico You guys are a real trip. This isn't their first rodeo. They've been through this many times from both sides. You act like the president has all of this power. Yes, he does have the power to not approve a FYBudget if it doesn't have in it what he has requested. He did.
@CNNPolitics @SenSchumer They've been through this before. On Both Sides. Truth is, we can all blame congress for not getting along in the PLAYPEN. Career politicians that can care less about their constituents. One day soon it will all come back to bite them when @COSProject @USTermLimits take effect.
@KPRC2 @houstonpolice Rest In Peace Gunnar. Thank You For Your Service.
@AOC Congratulations on your Finance Committee appointment. Sorry it's at the bottom of the heap, but you have to start somewhere. The House &amp; Ways committee is reserved for career politicians. No need to apply.
@ArtAcevedo @HoustonChron People come to Sanctuary City Houston to work. Cheap Labor Slaves is what I call them. And when they can't find work, they turn to crime. And when they're caught and go before a judge their bond is set so low, and they're back out. It's called the justice system. Take it to them.
@SpeakerPelosi Everything is going fine at our airports here in Texas. FYI, the link attached in your post requires me to pay for a "Washington Post" subscription so that I can see what's in it. Sound familiar? aka We have to pass this so that we can see what's in it. Sound familiar? No thanks.

@KHOU It's not a crisis for them. That's because they all come in and move to other parts of the state, primarily to the big cities that have chosen not to work with federal law enforcement. Look at where they come in and where they go. All democratic areas. https://t.co/9PBZPWhqky
@MarcelinoKHOU @KHOU @GregAbbott_TX @SylvesterTurner @SheriffEd_HCSO @HPOUTX @JoeGamaldi Agreed 100%....You have to fix the broken system 1st....Doesn't matter how many law enforcement personnel we have if all that's done is to arrest them and let them out on a cheap bond to go out and do the same thing over and over again. Lock em up.

@IlonaABC13 @abc13houston It was also reported that the mother of Jazmine was facebook friends with the accused, which was taken down on facebook......The ENTIRE TRUTH must come out and be reported.
@SenSchumer Senator....When was the last time our federal government operated on Pure Bipartisanship? That's what our founding fathers expected, and Sir that's what the voters not only expect but demand. Stop the stumping and do what the voters elected the government to do on both sides.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump The government is already too top heavy.....How about the democrats and republicans get together and show the taxpayers how bipartisanship works? That's REAL pay for an HONEST days work....
@realDonaldTrump Well done Mr. President....Stay the Course....Behind you 100%. One suggestion. Break down the current 2019FY Budget showing all of the $$$$ and where they go along with their %'s and what % of the 5.9B would represent to the rest. A drop in the bucket....Use the power of the veto

@RollTide Nickie Boy Saban had it handed to him tonight....When the head coach loses the same Discipline that he teaches and demands, players follow suit. When a big play QB can't deliver then switch out for another great QB in Hurts. This is Sabans loss. I still Love the Tide though.

@realDonaldTrump @VP @GOPLeader @senatemajldr Since @SpeakerPelosi believes that the Border Wall is so immoral, then here's the New Concept....Since the State of California is already a Sanctuary State.....Then place border posts all along the Arizona and Nevada borders.... https://t.co/64fvzXWEW4
@realDonaldTrump Stay the Course Mr. President!!! @VP @GOPLeader @senatemajldr
@PoojaOnTV @abc13houston EXACTLY.....
This gentleman has got it correct.....100% @realDonaldTrump @VP @GOPLeader @senatemajldr https://t.co/W4eavEmx1t
@PoojaOnTV @abc13houston @HoustonTexans I would have never gone....Happens every year....Carrot Danglers at their greatest...
@collinabc13 @abc13houston Not very far.....
@KHOU NEW Coach to Start.....
@KPRC2AdamW @KPRC2 Happens every year.....A running back as a QB....And a coach that thinks he's a QB....
@JohnCornyn @WSJ Bring them home.....Too many U.S. $$$$ spent and lives lost in a battle that will never end....Read the Bible Sir.....We can use our troops to protect our own borders, especially at the U.S. Mexico border.
@GregAbbott_TX Governor Abbot....Just what are your thoughts about a "Wall" stretching the entire length of the Texas border? Are you for it? What are the legal ramification?
Will the 800,000 now not getting paid because of the government shutdown count against the next round of unemployment numbers? Shouldn't, as I see them as a Huge Tax Cut.....
@WayneDupreeShow I'm seeing them....
@marklevinshow Tough titty says the kitty.....
@SpeakerPelosi If the shoe fits......
@KHOU Close the doors and turn out the lights....
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP And your point? The democrats once voted for and approved border security. Consider those not getting paid fired and/or laid off....Happens all the time in business. If you continue to run the government like it's a business, the shoe fits.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Bi-Partisanship??? I don't call a small handful of rinos bi-partisan....Not to worry....It won't get signed anyway....Nice try chuckie....
@lorettaslaught1 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I'll gladly pay my share....Whatever it takes....
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It's already shutdown chuckie.....Keep it going thru 2020 as far as I'm concerned. Consider those affected "Laid Off". Government's too big anyway. Can you count past 20? #COSProject #TermLimits
@KHOU Also an Illegal Immigrant.....
@porter14159 @AnnCoulter Looks like that they're already doing just that....Sanctuary cities, counties, states..... https://t.co/Il96xoEwlw https://t.co/DpN587BNpy
@senatemajldr Exactly Sir.....Stand Strong &amp; Bold.....
@politico @TomReedCongress RINO.....
@politico @RandPaul You Got It Right Sir.... @MittRomney should go ahead and change his affiliation to the democrats....There's nothing wrong with disagreeing. However, you don't go out of the gate and pull something like this....RINO's not welcome....
@MittRomney Senator Romney.....If you're already spending your 1st few days in the senate criticizing our president, why don't you cut to the chase and switch on over as a real democrat. You're not doing the republican party any good if that's how you're starting out 2019. Man Up
@Lorie945 @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump I believe that's what bipartisanship means: Bipartisanship, sometimes referred to as nonpartisanship, is a political situation, usually in the context of a two-party system, in which opposing political parties find common ground through compromise. BOTH PARTIES HAVE FORGOTTEN.
@GOP @KellyannePolls Partisanship WORKS.....Anything else "Splits &amp; Divides".....Which has gone on WAY TOO LONG" The Voters are "TIRED" of this.....On "Both Sides"....Keep It Up = #COSProject  and #TermLimits Going to happen before 2020.... @NancyPelosi @GOPLeader @senatemajldr @SenSchumer
@realDonaldTrump So long as it doesn't affect the market....
@NancyPelosi @GOPLeader @senatemajldr @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @VP If there is not "REAL" Bipartisanship in our federal government going forward, then all I can say is shame...shame...shame on you. #ConventionofStates #TermLimits  It will happen by the people...GUARANTEED https://t.co/QMDmk65HwQ
@realDonaldTrump That's RIGHT.....It's called "BIPARTISANSHIP"......Top to Bottom....Both Parties...House &amp; Senate @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @DanCrenshawTX
@JohnCornyn Exactly.....It's called Bipartisanship!!!

@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Don't forget to stop off in California and pick up the illegal migrant thug cop killer....Introduce him to Chuckie BOY Schumer and take him to lunch....Whatever action ya'll have up your sleeve????.....Not going anywhere.

@politico Way Too Funny......
@CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Keep it shut down....
Send them to Pelosi's walled compound.... @NancyPelosi https://t.co/oMf6dsPODg
@JohnCornyn Keep letting them cross the border like they are and it won't be Texas anymore....24,000 in 3-months in El Paso....

Build the Wall.... https://t.co/nGqwwwT4x0
@GregAbbott_TX @JohnCornyn What are you doing to halt the unannounced dumping of migrants in El Paso that cause the release because of over crowding?
@GregAbbott_TX Please stop the illegal release of migrants that's taking place in El Paso.....Catch them and send them all with a 1-way bus ticket to California and New York.....
@SenTedCruz Stop the Catch &amp; Release going on in Texas.... aka El Paso.....Voters are watching you....Stay strong on the Border Wall....Don't Cave In....
@JohnCornyn Stop the Catch &amp; Release going on in Texas.... aka El Paso.....Voters are watching you....Stay strong on the Border Wall....Don't Cave In....
@senatemajldr Don't Cave In.....The voters are watching....
@NancyPelosi What are you going to do with the 8-ILLEGAL THUGS that were arrested for murdering the policeman in California? Maybe you can hire them to be your body guards.....We also have several thousand that were illegally dumped off in El Paso Texas that we'll send you too
Round up: 8 arrests made in death of Corporal Ronil Singh - https://t.co/K6gbJmWZ4K via @Shareaholic Hey Nancy.....Maybe they can be your new body guards @NancyPelosi
@SenSchumer @CuseFootball And oh by the way.....We can have all of the migrants being dumped here in Texas and bus them directly on a 1-way trip to NYC.....That will do you PROUD....
@SenSchumer @CuseFootball Someone has to do it.....Sure not coming from you.....
@MikeLevinCA Not in the Senate....Where it matters in the end.....Keep choking.....Just divert all of the migrants to California.....
@thehill Most voters elected him.....What a Joke....More FAKE NEWS!!!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mr. President.....I strongly urge you to stop the Catch &amp; Release activities in El Paso Texas.....Last release was not even planned and migrants were just dumped off.....Shut the border down....Close the Gates....This is way beyond getting out of hand.....Stay Strong and Bold.
@thehill SHUT the BORDER DOWN.....And CUT ALL AID.......
@NancyPelosi And it's going to stay shutdown....
@thehill Do it Mr. President. We are behind You!!! Let's see who all the Swampers are.
@JacksonLeeTX18 Get back to work.....
@thehill The judge gets his meds for free.....Maybe he needs to take some more....
@politico Before she took her meds......
@thehill @HillTVLive FAKE NEWS......
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @HouseDemocrats @HouseJudDems You're a real piece of work.....Term limits are going to catch up with you.....Guaranteed.....
@thehill Looks like she took her meds today......
@ChadPergram POLLS mean very little.....The truth of the matter is we have no congress.....Maybe the congress needs to share their MEDS with one another.....
@ChadPergram Not Going To Happen.....
@thehill FAKE NEWS........
@realDonaldTrump Do it Mr. President.....The U.S. receives ZERO Benefits. There are laws on the books that should protect the U.S.. They're being broken, and neither side of our congress are serious about enforcing the laws and/or dealing with a complete and broken system.
@WayneDupreeShow Why don't you worry about catching the ILLEGAL ALIEN California Cop Killer????
@realDonaldTrump Stand your ground Mr. President.....Just today migrants were dumped off in El Paso Texas. Stop the Catch &amp; Release. Please don't give in.
