@terrystrother4 @altUSEPA @CronePatrol Looking through our past tactics, large scale marches have been effective.		First step is they we usually float the idea (#MarchForOurChildren), measure traction, and adjust until we hit a strategy that catches the popular imagination and has had past success.
Here is how I will proceed with Fraude and his crew: I will block.		I will have no comment on any allegation against me. If they doxx me, they will be reported.		I‚Äôve spoken my peace: They exist to spread division, under foreign leadership, using illegal methods. End of story.
@Gavlar What locked account?
@Gavlar *pay period, not daily pay period üòÇ
@Gavlar How do I know this? Because there is an actual former AltGov we had to remove for grifting.		Fraude took no interest despite over $20k raised.		We investigated it ourselves and expelled the account.
@Gavlar Upon Fraude‚Äôs accusations and threats of doxxing, I immediately asked for that information to be re-verified.		They mocked that effort, hence the DM room name.		The harassment is the point.
@Gavlar And I am exactly who I have claimed to be, as verified by Snopes and their former managing editor, now with Truth or Fiction, who viewed and verified my documentation.		I am a former government contractor, and cybersecurity contractor, in the defense intelligence space.
@Gavlar This is half my daily pay period, if that, in total funds raised. And I do not control the GoFundMe.		We also negotiated a truce, which he used to plan a doxxing of me, as I moved on.
@Gavlar Their methods now, doxxing individuals with whose views they disagree, are also highly dangerous and against Twitter ToS and relevant law.		The harassment, for them, has become the point.
@Gavlar Oh, Fraude‚Äôs group done a lot of great work against people misinforming others: Claude Taylor, Louise Mensch, Eric Garland, and I support the *work.*		But when his team ran out of valid targets, they turned to innocents, &amp; we began to examine his account and methods more closely.

@general_badass @maggieNYT With the new House of Representatives, that will begin to change, culminating in two years with Trump‚Äôs defeat.		And Inunderstand there are some folks at SDNY *very* eager to speak with him.
‚ÄúIf he says that two and two are five ‚Äì well, two and two are five.		This prospect frightens me much more than bombs ‚Äî		And after our experiences of the last few years that is not a frivolous statement.‚Äù		‚ÄîGeorge Orwell, ‚ÄúLooking Back on the Spanish War‚Äù
‚ÄúThe implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past.		If the Leader says of such and such an event, ‚ÄòIt never happened‚Äô ‚Äì well, it never happened.‚Äù
‚ÄúNazi theory indeed specifically denies that such a thing as ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô exists. There is, for instance, no such thing as ‚Äòscience‚Äô. There is only ‚ÄòGerman science‚Äô, ‚ÄòJewish science‚Äô etc.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is just this common basis of agreement, with its implication that human beings are all one species of animal, that totalitarianism destroys.‚Äù
‚ÄúBritish and a German historian would disagree deeply on many things, even on fundamentals, but there would still be that body of, as it were, neutral fact on which neither would seriously challenge the other.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd in practice there was always a considerable body of fact which would have been agreed to by almost everyone. 		If you look up the history of the last war in the Encyclopedia Britannica, you will find that a respectable amount of the material is drawn from German sources.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously coloured what they wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes;		but in each case they believed that ‚Äòthe facts‚Äô existed and were more or less discoverable...‚Äù
‚ÄúI know it is the fashion to say that most of recorded history is lies anyway.

@marcorubio Regardless of past U.S. actions in SA there were no weapons in the shipments. It was food and medicine.		And any regime that sets fire to food and medicine for the starving and sick is not morally defensible.		The sooner the Venezuelans have peace and real elections, the better.

@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Finally, no referral from the Minority is required to be investigated, especially one that appears to have been drafted by a 1L at The University of Better Call Saul.

@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows 6. You compare Mr. Cohen‚Äôs statements of his state of mind with SDNY‚Äôs perception of his state of mind.		Claim that conflict over whether Mr. Cohen‚Äôs crimes were committed purely out of loyalty to Individual 1 or with additional element of greed do not meet elements of perjury.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows 5. Alleged conflicts between written and spoken testimony are specious, de minimus, explanatory based on your own questioning, or outright fabricated.		No perjury.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows 4. The form to which you refer asks about contracts with ‚Äúforeign government entities.‚Äù		That is also a precise legally defined phrase. An airline owned partly by South Korea and a bank owned partly by Kazakstan don‚Äôt meet the definition.		It encompasses entities like the GRU.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows 3. You asked whether Mr. Cohen created the Women for Cohen account.		He replied that it was created as a joke on his behalf by a woman at a consultancy, Red Finch.		That‚Äôs not contested. No perjury.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows 2. You say Mr. Cohen lied about not wanting a job at the White House.		Cohen has a letter from a law firm containing contempernous documentation that he should not seek a position at the White House to preserve attorney-client privilege with Mr. Trump (Individual 1.)
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Fine, let‚Äôs debunk this. üôÑ		1. You claim Cohen lies about defrauding a bank. Fraud has a specific legal meaning. What Cohen pleaded guilty to was making false statements to a financial institution.		That‚Äôs not the fraud statute, so no, not perjury, just a bad faith claim.

@anujahermione Bc Pakistan isn‚Äôt capable of using nuclear weapons against the U.S. quickly, but has enough short range missiles to annihilate most of India.		Their bad command &amp; control means they have put use of those weapons to local field control previously.		I *like* India &amp; want it here.
Well, we‚Äôre all still here, so India and Pakistan clearly kept it subnuclear last night.		Imagine if Trump had to run the render-safe operation to secure Pakistan‚Äôs arsenal.		Tensions still high between two nations, but no troops marching on Islamabad. It‚Äôs the little victories.
Private financial statements , you say? https://t.co/w90nOWICXm

In an economy which we have not see since the Gilded Age, an expanding class of oligarchs, where people in the richest country in the world die from lack of cheaply made simple medicines, the nation demands action, and action now.
We have had a mixed economy (Socialism and Capitalism) since the New Deal. The United States is a Social Democratic country, and has been for a hundred years.		Social Democracy is Sweden.	It is not the petro-cronyism of Venezuela which resembles Russia more than any other nation.
@sf5542 @DemSocialists Well, just babies I joined a party doesn‚Äôt mean I support their candidate.		A actually agree, for the most part.
@HumanVirus11 @DemSocialists Correct. Social Dmeocracy probably better defines my views.
@Devilishlydo @DemSocialists Yes we are, and that does not change.
Thai is just in the interest of transparency: Whoever wins the 2020 Democratic Primary will have my full support.
Nothing will change here in terms of ideas espoused. But the Democratic Party as a whole was not sufficiently progressive for my views.		I believe in a mixed economy which benefits us all.		So I will be in the right wing of the @DemSocialists rather than the left of vanilla Dems.
Nor does it mean I‚Äôll suddenly become a Bernie supporter. (Although I am an @AOC supporter in pretty much every way.)		First and foremost, I am an American. Second, I am a member of the Democratic Party.		I see this as an addition to my Democratic Party stances.
There will be no rose emoji in my name, nor do I agree either @DemSocialists on everything.		But in a world of compromising to vote for the party closest to your views, they‚Äôre the closest to my vision: #GreenNewDeal, #Medicare4All, and and strong worker protections.
Full disclosure, I am now a registered member of the @DemSocialists.We need big, bold policy solutions for big problems, and they‚Äôre the only ones proposing then.		I do have philosophical differences: Capitalism is a fantastic engine for creating wealth, but not distributing it.

@FictionalFacts2 Is it right? No.		But the fact is that, even with the privileges accorded only to the few, Stone still severely damaged his case with his testimony
@FictionalFacts2 I know.		But my analysis takes into account America‚Äôs two-tiered Justice system, and that we are in that reserved for the upper tier.		Most things white collar defendants do would land an avg. person in prison.		A joint defense agreement for example would be witness tampering.
What Roger Stone did today was turn a discussion over whether to impose a gag order into whether to remand him to custody.		Testimony was a disaster, destroyed any credibility he had with ABJ, will weigh on his sentencing, and he may yet be charged under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß‚ÄØ1503.
Stone nearly got himself incarcerated today, and for the first time in four decades, we will no longer hear from Roger J. Stone.		Prosecutors of course still have option to add charge for Obstruction against Stone for the post.		Stone‚Äôs testimony was a disaster.
Stone narrowly escapes jail for now, but given conditions and Stone‚Äôs nature, it seems likely he will violate new gag order. https://t.co/qOza5gfjrf

Prosecutor in Smollett case lays out nearly full case in statement.		While presumed innocent, there is a large amount of evidence alleged indicating Smollett attack was indeed a hoax he orchestrated to an extraordinarily detailed degree.
15 minute break decreed by Judge, presumably so she can consider appropriate action.		Of course it cannot be lost on ABJ they defendants‚Äô threatening judges are usually remanded to custody, and the discussion does not usually focus scope of a gag order. https://t.co/D8RFHG9CTJ

The Government may yet bring further charges, including Domestic Terrorism, which would result in a far lower likelihood of release.		A reminder that Hasson, a white nationalist, planned his attack for two years, assembled a target list, and gathered a large arsenal of weaponry.

Roger Stone is due in court at 2:30pm EST for his imagery showing crosshairs alongside the Judge in his case.		Consequences range from a warning, to revoking of his bail and being sent to a Federal jail immediately.		The determination is in the Judge‚Äôs hands.

@AltCyberCommand @ScoobyLawU @RogueNASA @WulfrikFellmane @Fraude_1 @EMinusZero @HoarseWisperer Hey, cyber. We reached a truce. Negotiated last evening. Let‚Äôs de-escalate here if you don‚Äôt mind.		Dm me if you want to talk about the specifics.
@Tarnsman1 Schultz, Bernie if he does not get nomination, Bloomberg, Steyer...
@MaxBoot There was a group of us that took every one of those classes, initially without coordinating, later became friends.		One became White House Fellow, another is at DoD, another is in Foreign Service...		You‚Äôre absolutely right. We need more of these classes.
@MaxBoot It was hard to find classes about war, historical diplomacy, and intelligence in undergrad.		Culture, language, anthropology, sociology of the cultures, and theoretical diplomacy much more prevalent.
Ooooh, boy, we‚Äôre going to have to do a thread on the specifics of how a President is elected: the EC Vote people know. 		But the EC Vote is certified by Congresspeople, there‚Äôs a process for a deadlocked EC, and the nitty gritty of the process hasn‚Äôt been used in 100s of years.
@ThomONeil1 They don‚Äôt need standing. They alone determine whether to vote to certify the Electoral College vote as reported by the States.		That‚Äôs a separate process that occurs first before the deadlocked EC process, and each House member gets one vote, not each delegation.
Could just be more FUD from Trump‚Äôs defense team, as sources are not named as within DOJ.
He has not been on the job long enough to even read the case materials.		Prepare to march. https://t.co/qVzMSIQEqE
@TrionaBolger It can be, but that would require a Constitutional Amendment, which requires 2/3 vote of both Houses of Congress, plus 3/4 of states to ratify, or an Article V Convention, at which the entire Constitution could be rewritten, at the request of 2/3 of state legislatures.
For all those sweet na√Øve souls saying ‚Äúmaybe this would be a good thing because....‚Äù: Let me spell this out.		It would mean war.
@TrionaBolger A state compact where states with similar size EC votes pair off to enact laws to award delegates proportionally to the popular vote winner.
Give here to the elected Democratic nominee, whoever she or he may be. https://t.co/lqWuqSg1Xv
Only one way to make that nightmare impossible: Vote in massive numbers. Save your donations for the General Election. Canvass to take as many State delegations as possible.		We are in a fight not only for this nation‚Äôs soul... but for its very existence. https://t.co/Wuo5Vxn3pw
My nightmare: A centrist enters as a third party candidate. No one receives 270 EC votes.		Election is thrown to the House, where each State delegation gets one vote for Pres.		Anticipating this, populous states object, &amp; House refuses to certify EC Vote.		The nation fractures.

The longer the cyberstalker, harasser, or doxxer is insulated from legal consequence...		The longer they can pretend their actions are a game...the greater the chance of their escalation to violent methods becomes.		Their game ends now.
Each act undertaken with impunity encourages and emboldens the offender.		The surest course of preventing serial cyber stalkers, harassers, and doxxers from escalating to deadly methods is lawful punishment.		That is why I will be taking immediate legal action beginning tomorrow.
Serial doxxers and doxxing rings must be stopped early because they almost inevitably escalate to violent and deadly methods:		SWATing (where police are called with a false complaint of a shooter), false allegations (domestic violence framing), and false reports of child abuse. https://t.co/7DG11rjNiB

@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS If such travel is necessary, Tulsi Gabbard.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS Her district is located in Hawaii. So by definition travel to her district would require travel to that state.		This is common sense. Unless only congresspeople on the mainland United States should be subject to oversight?
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS And I‚Äôve told you if we can do it from the mainland, we will.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS As I have repeatedly stated, it may be necessary to travel to a congresswoman‚Äôs district in investigating that Congresswoman.		Your bizarre attempt to turn that into a scandal is simply confusing.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS Your concerns are noted.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS What shouldn‚Äôt be so hard?
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS Your recommendation is noted.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS ...Okay. We‚Äôve now reached a place where your questioning is neither relevant nor sensical.		As such, this conversation is ended. Have a good evening.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS Travel costs may include to the congresswoman‚Äôs district, her district office in Washington, Lebanon, or any number of locations. Once again, the investigation is in the planning phase.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS No one is concealing that investigating a congresswoman may require travel to her district.		You seem overly pleased that this district is on a pacific island, as it contributes to your smear narrative, but those too are part of the United States, unless you‚Äôve forgotten.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS I am uncertain what you believe I confirmed. As stated the investigation remains in its planning stages, and all expenses will be publicly justified.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS Your intent is to run interference for an Assadist Presidential candidate.		That much is abundantly clear.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS As stated, access to local contacts may make such travel unnecessary. The investigation is in the planning stages and as such actions will remain in flux.		All expenses will be publicly reported and justified. This conversation is no longer productive.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS We‚Äôve experienced enough of that from Russia Today, frankly.		I believe your questions have been addressed, and there is no further purpose in entertaining your attempts to smear the name of an established researcher and good woman.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS That is incorrect, and at this point your statements have veered into falsities.		As such, there is no further purpose in continuing this discussion, as you are not engaged in a good faith effort to verify usage of funds, but rather a smear campaign. https://t.co/I41mh8Irfj
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS You do not appear concerned with use of funds so much as smearing the name of an established researcher.		If you do not wish to be involved in the project, you are free to not be involved.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS As I clearly stated, no, it may not be necessary given local contacts we‚Äôve obtained.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS It‚Äôs fairly clear your goal is to smear Caroline as a grifter, which is a ludicrous claim under the circumstances.		Should you have any questions or concerns of substance rather than negative PR motive, they will be addressed.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS I have no control over the GFM, as the AltGov is extremely careful about how we handle any donated funds.		You may ask Caroline to do so, but frankly we are making every effort to be forthright here and you do not appear to be engaging in this discussion in good faith.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS 6. You‚Äôre not a donor or contributor. You‚Äôre owed nothing in the way of explanation.		As for plans for the funds, all usage will be reported publicly, receipts will be kept, and all expenses will be justified either in advance or when at such time the investigation is complete.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS You‚Äôve been given a simple, direct answer: Yes, investigating a congresswoman might require travel to her district.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS 5. You‚Äôre making a rather outrageous allegation here: that someone would jeopardize a reputation worth far more than a few thousand dollars for a beach week.		That claim requires evidence, of which you‚Äôve provided none.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS Correct, traveling to the Congressional district might be necessary. That‚Äôs common shoe-leather reporting.		No ‚Äúvacation‚Äù activities would be taking place.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS 3. If the travel is unnecessary the funds would be used for other investigative purposes, including obtaining documents, research, etc.		4. Your questions aren‚Äôt being asked in good faith, but as part of an attempted smear.
@GetFuktHoosier @citizen_bot_usa @RVAwonk @propornot @MattAsherS 1. The original purpose of funding was for travel expenses, not for ‚Äúvacation‚Äù, but for on the ground reporting from the Congressional district.		2. We‚Äôve since been receiving info from local reporters, activists, and others on the ground that might make that travel unnecessary.

A storm gathers on the horizon. We can all smell the lightening in the air, feel the shift in the winds.		But I promise you this. If we dedicate ourselves to what has truly made our nation great: freedom, equality, opportunity, and unity, we shall not only weather that storm.
I intend for our nation to live. 		To accomplish this goal we must address the vast nest of vipers that have wound their way through our social, economic, information, and political systems...		Not by force. But by strength of argument, power of organization, and Rule of Law.

There is a type of conservatism that is of good heart, skeptical of rapid change, fiercely loyal to the ideals of America, and which holds values of sacred honor.		But for now, it is dead.		For it to live, the machines of hatred and division that are the modern GOP must burn.
I see now why our information and political ecosystems were so easily hijacked by a foreign power.		They only adjusted a monstrous machine we ourselves built.		They layered a twenty-first century technology atop that machine, and made us tear ourselves apart.
Challenging, dismantling, &amp; preventing it from ever arising again is a national duty.		It is an unfathomably monumental task only coming into focus to me now. The scale is staggering.		But Americans don‚Äôt shy from challenges. We rise to them.		We are the future.	And we will win.

This comes naturally to people who live in cities, especially Washington.		But if you decided to bus yourself to a protest in one of these places, be aware of the norms of behavior.		Walking away from provocative speech is YOUR responsibility.
What you do NOT do is take off your shirt, and start menacing them and those who attempt to de-escalate.		You chose to come to a place of debate, a public square. YOU have the obligation to control yourself.		YOU have the obligation to de-escalate and move the fuck along.
How do you act when the Black Hebrew Israelites insult, demean, and offend you?		The same way we handle the ‚Äúpreachers‚Äù shouting at us that we‚Äôre going to Hell for our beliefs at the Womens March.		You ignore it, and keep a safe distance. That is on YOU.		YOU entered the space.
One lesson about #CovingtonCatholic, for all those who get on a bus to a major protest: You are entering a public square of debate.		Neither your red hat nor your majority of like-minded individuals gives you the right to menace violence when offended.

In everything I do, every message I carry, I try to reflect the moment that he began to dance.
Hatred is not natural. It is learned. And it is the task of a leader to preach against it.		We were not meant to hate one another. As that rabbi taught me, we were meant to share, to break bread, to love, and to dance.
We knew nothing of the irreverence we were showing. And the rabbi knew this. And by his simple act of dance, and his outreach of kindness, he turned a moment that could have been one of ugliness and conflict into one of interfaith education and joy.		I will always remember that.
It was, to this day, one of the great exemplars to me of how G-d can transform even the greatest of misunderstandings into experiences of love and learning.
We followed in reverence, before being invited to join the them for a meal at the Jewish cultural center, where we were shown not an ounce of the ill will we deserved, but love, compassion, and joy.
He told us we were free, as were all, to continue to play our music, if we wished. But asked instead that we join them for the dedication, assigning a participant to lead us along with them in the ceremony.
The Rabbi, upon hearing our music, joyously broke into dance to our music, and led the precession to our window.		He asked that we silence the music for a moment as he explained the significance of the the trumpets, the joy of G-d's love, &amp; the meaning of the ceremony.
What we did not know was that the trumpets were being sounded as a procession as part of the dedication of the new campus Torah.		Easily, we could have been blamed for bigotry, and perhaps even become guilty of it had we persisted.		But something else happened.
I want to tell a story about "boys being boys" vs. religious harassment.	When I was a young college man, early one morning, trumpet blasts began sounding outside our window.		Naturally, in the manner of the time, my roommates and I began blasting a Lil' Wayne song in response.
@McCormickProf And I poking a bit of fun at you for the sarcastic indulgence. It will be certainly interesting to see where judicial scholarship leads from here.		Will a new right "living Constitution" in defense of "economic freedom" override the carefully constructed originalist doctrine?

In that moment, the Law made a black man in D.C. more powerful than the sitting President of the United States.		That is what we mean by the Rule of Law.
Just imagine... A man whose own father was sold as a piece of chattel property taking the President of the United States into custody for riding his horse too quickly... because it was against the Law.

@adamsbombs @RVAwonk Great question. Answered in QT.
Sure, we want to dig deeper into a few issues surrounding her family‚Äôs involvement in state politics, and in particular the Science of Identity‚Äôs involvement in her politics.		We‚Äôll be doing some threads on what we know and what we need to actually hit the ground to find out. https://t.co/YkXgWt6Dju
@Musicgal4077 Short answer: Yes
And if you cannot afford to donate, please share.		We must stop this Tulsi for President lunacy before it gathers strength.
Reminder that I have never asked for a single dollar for anything. This is unique.		Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs candidacy is dangerous. The United States cannot survive a second Putin plan in the Oval.		Help stop this from occurring by donating to this investigation.		https://t.co/87WO8kxubx

@RVAwonk Let‚Äôs see: How many would donate $5 for a trip for myself and @RVAwonk to go to Hawaii and dig up Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs pro-Assadist, ‚ÄúScience of Identity‚Äù Hare Krishna cult-gone-wrong member connections, and weird Putin connections?
@RVAwonk We... could probably crowdfund the cash pretty easily
Hey @RVAwonk, let‚Äôs go to Hawaii write a story about Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs crazytown connections.

We are here to say that your time of illegal occupation is nearly at its end.		Who are we?		We are the American Civil Service.		And you have the right to remain silent.		@realDonaldTrump
We patrol your coasts. We staff your parks, feed the needy, and care for the veteran.		We guard you while you sleep.
We are the heirs of those who have protected the Republic from enemies foreign... and domestic, the heirs of those have stood vigil as guardians of our Democracy for a quarter millennium.		#WeAreAltGov	#TrumpShutown
We risked our careers, jeopardized our livelihoods, braved subpoenas and intimidation, endured endless mocking as conspiracy theorists, received daily threats of violence and death.		Nevertheless, we persisted to bring you the truth.		#WeAreAltGov
If Trump uses emergency powers to override the People‚Äôs Representatives in Congress, where does it end?		No President, especially one under investigation as a foreign asset, may invoke emergency powers except when imminent danger creates insufficient time to consult Congress.

Loyal officers of the United States have a duty to invoke Impeachment.		This is not a political question, but a moral one.		Trump‚Äôs Campaign Manager gave sensitive internal data on American voters to a Russian who assisted this attack.		Trump‚Äôs election was illegitimate.
Election theft is an Act of War. If you‚Äôre still supporting Trump, you‚Äôre suborning Treason.		It‚Äôs that simple.
Donald Trump‚Äôs Campaign Manager gave American voter data to a Russian directly involved in hacking the election.		We can stop arguing over whether collusion is real. https://t.co/HmWTKUSs5C
