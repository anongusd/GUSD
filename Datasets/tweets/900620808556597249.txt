She had a week and a half notice before she died. With her limited strength she wrote checks to her favorite charities, like @PPFA and @girlscouts.  Dispite it being October, the local council got us Thin Mints to serve at the funeral, at her request.
Less than a month before she died, she told me she felt guilty that she wasn't helping anyone, despite not having the strength to sit up unassisted. She wanted me to bring up her knitting from downstairs (she hadn't used them in months) so she could knit for migrants.
My mother used baby powder everyday for much of her life.  3 years ago she died from the ovarian cancer Johnson &amp; Johnson KNEW it could cause. Their greed stole from the world a woman who with her last bit of  strength wanted to  help others. https://t.co/8KIIvlqitm

@DaveSodman @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 Cities concentrate everything, both good and bad.  And Chicago has suffered under some terrible economic plans, influenced by the libertarian bent of the University of Chicago. poverty is a driver of violence, guns make that violence far more deadly.
@bmcclymont3 @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 But the gun shops do have to follow the laws, because they need their licences in order to operate.  So laws restricting how many guns a person can buy in a month have to be enforced by those that DO follow the law, or they risk going out of business.
@Highvoltage4u @telephonenut @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 Because it's easy to not rape a person.  You just don't rape them.  It's harder to keep other people from raping you.
@LCLF_Brain @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 Gun laws are a response to gun violence.  But they don't work when it's so easy to buy guns in one place and move them to another.  New York and Philly have to suffer because of VAs lax gun laws.
@LCLF_Brain @Highvoltage4u @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 Key words there is your own ranch, where it won't have any interaction with other cars or people. Not terribly useful for getting around town.  And I've shown a licence each time I've bought a car, plus my insurance. Those are state laws.
3) It burns people out.  I have the advantage of no student loans, and parents that were willing to support me the first few months of my first campaign when I was an intern. Others aren't so lucky, and can't do it or drop out. So we lose institutional knowledge.
2) so much that there's nowhere near enough people to do it. So I take on as many clients as I can handle, get no sleep, eat takeout and frozen meals, and don't see may partner at all. And then in mid-November it all dries up.  I scrape by with tutoring, delivery work, ect.

@ConanSonof @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 It's the other way around.  Guns in Mexico largely come from the US.  "Most of the firearms seized in Mexico that were traced and found to be of U.S. origin from 2009 to 2014 came from U.S. Southwest border states," https://t.co/oa49ixCS2c
Both the 2000 Presidential Election and the 2018 Senate Race could be swung not by the intent of the voters, but by bad ballot design.  Florida needs to hire some graphic designers to approve ballots apparently.
@Highvoltage4u @Smithaaah88 @truelifesimon @davidhogg111 Before buying them you have to prove you have a licence and insurance. Plus you have to register them in the new state when you move. And you can't register them if they don't fulfill the safety requirements of that state.

@IAStartingLine Virginia, Georgia, and Florida close 3 hours earlier than Iowa.
This is the 2nd or 3rd time I've voted at that location. always used my passport, never had a problem. Spent 30 minutes digging it up last night (it was in a duffle bag wrapped in some clothing from an outing last month). And for a sec I really thought he wouldn't let me vote.
I wonder how I would have been treated if I hadn't been a white woman who looked up the ID requirements ahead of time. Voter suppression can be subtle, including making someone feel they don't belong, even when they follow the rules. For a moment I wasn't sure they would let me.
I was just given way more grief than I should have been when #Ivoted because I used a passport instead of a drivers licence.  Luckily I knew the law, and a passport is fine.  But I wonder if someone else might have felt intimidated. I live in a very diverse neighborhood.
@Ramontinoco10 @1trillion2 @stevesingiser @Sharpe222 @JuddLegum @JesseFFerguson And that would be the reason why the Republicans pretty much only have white people anymore.
@1trillion2 @stevesingiser @Sharpe222 @JuddLegum @JesseFFerguson Some Dems probably do, but because the Democrats have people in almost every demographic category, but Republicans have almost exclusively white people, it won't make the same waves in the data.
@CampaignSick Are you sure?
@ClintSmithIII I also worry that the pictures on long lines are the ones that show up on the news, but that they may deter people who can give 20 minutes to voting, but not 2 hours. Some lines are probably from right before a polling place opens, and not representative of the actual wait time.

@HughJorgen2 @stevesingiser @Sharpe222 @JuddLegum @JesseFFerguson Yeah. The one I suggested. A lot easier to lie to a computer by pushing a button than to change the construction of your house, tell a counselor 6 years ahead of time, pass a lie detector test, and testify under oath.

@StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics It's more similar than any of the other 10 largest countries.  Culturally the US is most similar to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  All three have universal healthcare, and are rated higher than the US. There isn't a perfect analog. But it works for all other rich countries.
@JMSMark5 @StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics So will the churches help everyone, or just people of their religion?  How about people who are members of tiny religions, or no religion, or just are the only one in their town (like a Mormon in rural Georgia or a Quaker on Montana).
@StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics Which also means a bigger tax base.  But in terms of culture and standard of living it's very similar to the US.  Same with Canada.  Of the top 10 populous countries, only the US and Japan are fully industrialized.  So they would be the most similar. Universal healthcare
@StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics Matthew 22:21 Jesus said "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's."		And this time it's money to help poor people get healthcare, not fund the army that had invaded their land.
@StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics Also, you claim to be a Christan on your Twitter bio. Jesus specifically instructed us to take care of the poor, the needy, and the stranger. Are you not willing to pay a few dollars more to take care of those Christ commanded you to?
@StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics So you are paying about 300 a month. When I was in Australia they had a 1.5% tax just for healthcare. If we had the same system they did, that would mean you would pay less for that unless you earned 20k a month, or 240k a year, you would pay less.
@Latinos4Bernie @repjohnlewis Though also, give blood.  After the election.  Tough to canvass when you are down a pint, but the @RedCross is always trying to get more African Americans to donate. (Certain blood types are more common)
@stevesingiser @Sharpe222 @JuddLegum @JesseFFerguson Another possibility.  Rasmussen uses automated polls, they call and people push buttons to say their answers. I can see some Trump supporters claiming to be African American to bolster his numbers.
@ThePlumLineGS What's pretty close to what happened in 2012.  Dem house candidates had several million more votes, but were dozens of seats down.
@StevieD401 @leecaly @pete_patriot @CNNPolitics From the money currently being sent to insurance companies as premiums.  But insurance companies spend 80% of the money on actual healthcare, while Medicare/medicaid spend 97% on healthcare, so it's less overall.

@aaronbrethorst @Taniel If Beggich wins, it shows Alaskans are souring on Trump.  He may run for Senate again in 2 years.  She's up again in 22.

@Freeyourmindkid Jan 20, 2021. (Or Jan 3 2019). A blue congress. A Yard sign. (take plastic from a yard sign, cut out holes at top and sides for head and arms. Tell people you don't vote and to go knock doors.)
Brian Kemp has shown that the people who run elections should NOT be politicians. Perhaps appointed by a bipartisan board. But having the person who counts the votes be running for office is deeply undemocratic. If SOS is on ballot, they should be automatically recused by law.
@45thPod The issues with the HHS gender policy is that people won't be able to get ID based on their gender identity, which limits their abilities to live their lives. It also forces them to out themselves to everyone who sees their ID, from cops to bartenders to passport control.

@NDKushcom @HeidiHeitkamp She was credible while recounting one of the most painful memories of her life.  He came off like an angry, belligerent drunk.  He lied multiple times about what  his yearbook meant.  He spouted conspiracy theories. No way he belongs on any bench that doesn't have a barbell.
@KillerMartinis I was a volunteer for @JoeSestak in the 2010 primary (when Specter switched parties) one of the most effective arguments I had for women over 35 was Specter's behavior in the Anita Hill hearings. I was 10 and didn't understand much aside from it being sexist, but women remember
@seleneonline I'm sorry.  😢
John Paul Stevens says Kavanaugh shouldn't be on the court.  Has Sandra Day O'Connor said anything?  As an ex-justice appointed by a Republican, she may have more weight with Republicans.  Are there any other Rep ex-Justices alive?
@VanessaAdiaTX12 @ShesRunningPod When I was in 1st grade I was nearly held back because I did poorly on 1 test.  I had been out of school for 2 weeks with the flu, and was still sick, plus rusty. Only advanced because Grandma was a teacher &amp; tutored me over summer.
@SamettEvan @MuellerSheWrote 60 is for filibuster. For impeachment you need 66.

@Spacekatgal At least classic cars aren't a necessity.  I think it's far more of a problem when the rich invest in homes or oil futures, driving up housing and gas prices.  Classic cars would have a very small effect on the used car market, but probably not enough to really effect prices.
@ColoradoParaMan I have to respectfully disagree.  When my mom had Cancer we really needed those spots because walking even a few feet was absolutely exhausting for her. For someone with fibro mialgia every step could be like walking on needles.

@DelegateJBell @JenniferWexton Is she canvassing as well?  Enthusiastic kids are great at the door, though they can't canvass as long.  "Please, vote for me, because I can't" is very effective.  Have them use the puppydog eyes.

Brett Kavanaugh brags about all the women clerks he has had, but people who help with hiring clerks have said he likes pretty women as clerks.  Hiring a bunch of women so you get eye candy with your depositions isn't much of a defense. #KavanaughHearings

@davidhogg111 Evan if you can’t vote you can still volunteer. I regularly give out a #campaigntip, and one of my favorites is that kids too young to vote make amazing volunteers. Give a teen responsibility, and they want to prove they deserve it. They can say “please vote for me” 12 times/day.

@KillerMartinis It’s an amazing version, but it’s originally a Nine Inch Nails song. Or are you now claiming the ghost of Johnny Cash went back in time to give the lyrics to Trent Reznor so he could sing a cover?
@donmoyn Sorry, autocorrect. Godwin's law.

#CampaignTip: Ask your supporters to vote early/absentee/by mail, whatever the rule is in your state. To convince people who always vote, tell them if you have electronic machines in your state, mail ballots are paper ballots. And it makes the line shorter for other voters.
@swingleft I'll be helping candidates with their data needs.  https://t.co/JyqwY5Vbdp
Data Tip: When cutting turf or using grid view to enter data into @NGPVAN invest the $5 or $10 in getting a mouse rather than using a track pad. You will have more control, are less likely to accidentally click when you meant to move the pointer, and use the wheel to zoom maps.
@McCreadyForNC I've been a campaign worker for 14 years.  She is absolutely right.
Volunteer tip: Volunteers love to feel included.  Ask them if they want to hang out at a bar/restaurant the staff is going to after call time, or their opinion on which picture to use on a piece of lit.  Make them feel valued for more than their calls and knocks.

@ExposetheT @RogueSNRadvisor If you are just going to make statistics up out of thin air you aren't worth the time to go research actual facts.
@ExposetheT @RogueSNRadvisor Far more civilians are killed by cops than vice versa. And somehow trained officers are forgiven for panicking when civilians are expected to stay perfectly calm.
@IndivisibleMNLo Maybe it will work out well. They could focus on Amnesty-only education, and put money into fighting the war on droughts.
@ExposetheT @RogueSNRadvisor In my case, as a white woman who is very non threatening , I don't expect I would. Were I a black man a wouldn't count on that at all.  Black people in this country are not given the presumption of innocence, and are assumed to be armed by the color of their skin.
@RogueSNRadvisor That's because one news day in 2018 is like a month in 2008.
@ExposetheT @RogueSNRadvisor That didn't help the many black people shot with their hands up, or without a warning. Remember the guy shot while he was lying on the ground with his arms in the air while caring for a mental patient? Yet they can apprehended armed white mass shooters without killing them.
@ExposetheT @RogueSNRadvisor No. Throwing a pie or a glitter bomb is 10 times worse than throwing water. Shooting an unarmed person is a hell of a lot more than 10 times as bad as throwing water. And a lot of black men are shot for simply holding something, not holding it like a gun.

@digdawg @rabiasquared Last time I voted absentee in PA the form said it had to be for work, and in theory someone can snitch on a neighbor for being home when they voted absentee.
@rabiasquared This means the ballots are sent to the county clerk by Friday, given to poll workers on Saturday, then go with the other stuff to the polling place. In some counties they are opened and counted at polling places, some places it's centralized.
@rabiasquared PA absentee law is convoluted. You can only vote absentee for health reasons, or being outside of your precinct for work all Election Day. If you vote absentee and then aren't absent, you are supposed to go to your polling place, void the absent ballot, and re-vote regularly.

@Jehmu @donnabrazile I had no idea how to react to that, nothing like it had ever happened to me before. I laughed it off.
@Jehmu @donnabrazile I'd only been drunk once before, and had no idea how much alcohol was in them. He tried flirting with me by pulling out his testicals.
@Jehmu @donnabrazile I was sexually assaulted by the son of a political connection who's house  I was staying at. He gave me drinks that were sweet but strong
@Jehmu @donnabrazile I'm so sorry this happened to you, I believe you, and you really hope this new environment where we can come forward is permanent.

@The_Tru_FooL @IMNERHO @somewhere_angel @catsmeow29 And women of color are leaders in our movement, and they see the similarities.
@The_Tru_FooL @IMNERHO @somewhere_angel @catsmeow29 I use that example because there are a lot of similarities between the way women and POC are treated. Laws might be =, society isn't.
