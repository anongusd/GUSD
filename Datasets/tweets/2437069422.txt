@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain Common nickname. She‚Äôs been called Nikki by family and friends since she was a child. This has been verified before.
@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain Of course they spoke Punjabi. But the idea that Nikki, a nickname, is totally foreign to them is very narrow minded.

@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain Yes she is, but Hindi is a commonly spoken language around india, same with English.
@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain She has always been called Nikki, and the fact that you people have to twist a name to try and fit your stupid ‚Äúeveryone is racist‚Äù narrative is really sad.
@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain Nope. That‚Äôs what her family says. Also, I know way more about Indian culture than you do. My family is Malyali, but everyone speaks Hindi.
@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain Nicknames are very common in Indian culture. None of my immediate relatives go by their given name. They all go by some variant. Haley has always been referred to as Nikki by her parents. Nikki means ‚Äúlittle one‚Äù in Hindi, I believe.
@JustinJT_Esq @JenniCook94 @ordered_liberty @pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain Not true actually, by Haley‚Äôs own description.
@pacelattin @emzanotti @MeghanMcCain It is her real name. She‚Äôs gone by Nikki since she was a little kid. Nicknames in place of ‚Äúgood names‚Äù are very common in Indian culture. Her last name changed when she married Michael Haley.

@rachaelist I can't do that, I don't have the authority (just like Obama). But I support keeping recipients of DACA in this country.
@rachaelist The workable ideas are the ones that have lifted millions out of poverty. AKA not communism
@rachaelist I'm fine, thanks
@rachaelist You can argue with me. I'm just confused as to why you connect YOU arguing with me to having an inflated ego.
@rachaelist Manner* lol. So you're criticizing me for a grammatical error that was made by my phone (dictation)
@rachaelist Politics and public policy have always been something I do in an extracurricular manor. It's fun for me. Im not changing the world lol
@rachaelist Why do you think I think I'm relevant lol. You're the one who thinks you're fighting fascism lol
@rachaelist I really don't have an inflated sense of self. I expressed an opinion on twitter, as millions do, and you proceeded to argue with me.
@rachaelist Since it is so important to you, you can have the last word. I've made my point.
@rachaelist I've made my point lol
@rachaelist And your systems solved this? No they didn't. They made the poor poorer.
@rachaelist I could send you some academic materials based on stats and economic data that show the world is better off.
@rachaelist Again, you don't have facts so you divert. I'm done with you. You're not capable of being reasonable.
@rachaelist I'm not a fascist, and I don't need to prove it to you lol.
@rachaelist There is still suffering. There always will be in any system. But rodent that there is *significantly* less is intellectually dishonest.
@rachaelist Countless millions lifted out of poverty. Millions of people's lives changed through innovation and education.
@rachaelist Yes it is a better world
@rachaelist Lol I've been called a fascist before. It doesn't hurt my feelings. It takes someone very special  to call a first gen POC a fascist.
@rachaelist I've read everything from those I listed to Karl Marx. I'm not single minded like you.
@rachaelist I've never gone to a Capitol Hill cocktail party btw
@rachaelist No, I started reading and learning a long time before I started working I politics.
@rachaelist Your views aren't unique or edgy. And if you're vastly older than me as you imply, and still think this way, it shows the lack of character
@rachaelist No, they sought to change the world for the better based on their views. You're a cynic and you think your views are unique and edgy.
@rachaelist Like the far left loves to deny the fact that their ideology was the biggest cause of death in the 20th century? Lol grow up.
@rachaelist By that logic you also do not possess intelligence or wit
@rachaelist Those are the people who's outlooks and writings in part helped inspire me to hold the views I hold now.
@rachaelist It's adorable that you think you're winning this argument.
@rachaelist Condi Rice, Colin Powell, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, George Marshall, JFK, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan are the"paids" u speak of
@rachaelist You are so uninformed and sadly close minded. I don't have to delete anything because any sensible person sees that you are unstable
@rachaelist If you have ever read a book, you exposed yourself to another's ideas. But based on your arguments, I don't think you've ever touched one
@rachaelist You're saying that no one helped inspire your ideas? If that's the case then you are the child.
@rachaelist I'm sorry I don't usually resort to this kind of insult but you are an idiot
@rachaelist You also don't know how personal development even works lol
@rachaelist What does that even mean?
@rachaelist "I'm fake"
@rachaelist Other people helped form my opinions because I allowed myself to be exposed to their ideas.

@rachaelist Many foreign policy thinkers share my view, I know because they're who shaped my opinions.
@rachaelist That's a cop out condescending statement simply highlighting your lack of depth and substance.
@rachaelist My facts are facts. You call facts propaganda. That doesn't make it propaganda.
@rachaelist No...again...facts. It's not hard to find these things for yourself lol, your just too willingly blind to see it.
@rachaelist Pulls the "you're young card"! Aren't you just full of cop outs lol
@rachaelist So according to you, older people don't share my worldview? That is, simply put, astoundingly narrow minded and untrue.
@rachaelist @netanyahu @POTUS See everyone! It is easy to argue when you don't have facts!		"Fascist", "bubble", "propaganda"

@clarajseverson @AaronEberhartMN @anitalynns @savvymom59 The President should directly decry white supremacism and neo nazism. Said it to practically everyone I've talked to today and yesterday
@RachelWinton @anitalynns @clarajseverson @savvymom59 @MinnesotaDFL @mngop Yeah but the protest tomorrow isn't happening to demand legislation, it's protesting at the MNGOP offices.
@RachelWinton @anitalynns @clarajseverson @savvymom59 @MinnesotaDFL @mngop Again. POC here. I've faced racism.
@anitalynns @RepErikPaulsen Read my first tweet. Protesting the MNGOP Chair has nothing to do with your Representative. You're trying to twist my statement.
@clarajseverson @AaronEberhartMN @anitalynns @savvymom59 Have you seen what I've retweeted? Rubio, Gardner, Collins, Hatch. People with a stronger voice than mine demanding a firm condemnation.
@clarajseverson @AaronEberhartMN @anitalynns @savvymom59 Coming from the individual who called us sadistic! Ha! Rich!
@anitalynns @RepErikPaulsen I support white supremacy? My parents were assaulted by white supremacists for having the "audacity" to enter into an interracial marriage.
@anitalynns @RepErikPaulsen Ma'am im a first generation POC. I do not support white supremacy and neonazism.
@anitalynns @clarajseverson @savvymom59 @MinnesotaDFL @mngop I'm proud of my party condemning hate and not trying to take advantage of terrorism for a couple of cheap political shots.
@anitalynns @clarajseverson @savvymom59 @MinnesotaDFL @mngop I remember these posts. I liked and shared them.
@anitalynns @clarajseverson @savvymom59 @MinnesotaDFL @mngop Yeah. The chairwoman of our party visited the White House. Pretty awesome IMO.
I have disagreed with many things that the President has said, but Dems reaction to this tragedy highlight why I remain a staunch GOPer.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade Maybe the same applies in reverse. Think about that before calling the leaders of my party sadistic. I don't associate with sadistic people.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade Clara, accept that if they did, you still wouldn't give them credit. That's just a fact.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade No. It wasn't. But that's because the DFL statement unequivocally ruled out any such position.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade There we go. I lead the GOP in SD34, also ex MNCRs co chair. I'm sadistic? I know Jennifer well. She's a good person. But she's sadistic?
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade Lol I mean if you can't see that this election proved that an unpopular candidate can win, that's your problem.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade Maybe instead of tweeting from your perceived moral high ground you should join the rest of us in the middle to converse about this tragedy.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade Here resides the true problem with the Democratic Party, Republicans think they are smarter than Democrats, but Dems think we are evil.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade Know what Americans in swingy parts of the country told you guys last November? They hate the "anyone who supports the GOP is evil" argument
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade You will demonize 62.9 million people as white nationalists because you're sad you lost an election. This isn't the French Revolution.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade DFL logic: a nonwhite immigrant woman is a white nationalist.
@clarajseverson @MinnesotaDFL @mngop @ErinMayeQuade That's patently false. Stop using tragedy to push your agenda.

@Voorhees_Jason state intervention failed yet again. Also, check out Russia's terrible universal system.
@Voorhees_Jason @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan they have universal insurance. Does no good for places that Beijing doesn't care about
@Voorhees_Jason @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan they have universal insurance.
@Voorhees_Jason @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan you WANT it to be better, doesn't actually mean that it IS better
@Voorhees_Jason @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan you say while providing no evidence.
@Voorhees_Jason @melkickass @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan except it really isn't lol. Do some research.
@Voorhees_Jason @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan but you just said China's was better...so do you have a real argument or...no?
@daglamier @Voorhees_Jason @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan given our track record, that's pretty funny.
@daglamier @Voorhees_Jason @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan so how is theirs better than ours?
@AlfonsoAceves1 @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan as I've said multiple times, that money would not be nearly enough to cover healthcare.
@Voorhees_Jason @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan How can you say that? It leaves countless millions of rural/minority people behind.
@joeypmathis @GOP funny considering he was confirmed by the senate unanimously for the job he has now.

@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan he isn't claiming to have an MBA.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan dude even Wharton acknowledges him as an alum.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan IDK how the President is lying by saying that he has a degree from Wharton.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan it's called Wharton. Wharton is, as you don't seem to understand, a school inside of UPenn.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan UPenn is IVY LEAGUE. Wharton IS UPenn.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan actually, just fact checked. You're wrong. Trump graduated from Wharton School of Finance and Commerce
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan that are basically the same. UPenn is an excellent school. Wharton is inside UPenn.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan I'm saying I've never heard him refer to his college education at all. And you're comparing two things
@Thebattin but defaulting on a national level is similar to bankruptcy.
@Thebattin but of course congress would likely put measures in place to prevent that, leading to more reckless spending...virtuous cycle
@Thebattin Yes you're right, sovereign entities cannot go bankrupt, but they can default on their debts, leading to an economic crisis.

@greg_schoorens @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan so yeah, my argument works.
@greg_schoorens @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan you are comparing nations that have between 5mil-70mil people. They are also generally wealthier
@greg_schoorens @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan but the line isn't draw right after China and india. Any nation with a large population won't work
@melkickass @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan you think you can just draw a comparison between us and Sweden and it would be accurate. Wrong.
@melkickass @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan because it isn't about the small wealthy countries where it can work. üòä

@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan would you deny that the CEO has skills valued at 40mil, hence he's being paid 40mil

@LinguaForte @MottdeWitt so something you're saying is off. And you'd notice it's the others who have stopped responding, not me.
@LinguaForte @MottdeWitt it's not true because you can see I was responding to your tweets continuously for the past like 40 min
@LinguaForte @MottdeWitt but it isn't private. Stop what lol
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan not up to you to determine what is obscene. The market is the judge.
@LinguaForte @MottdeWitt no it isn't..
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan doesn't work out for them at all.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan and it works in Europe because they have small populations and strong infrastructure. Other countries?
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan standards of living.
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan almost completely inaccessible for the 90% of India's population that lives in sub euro
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan same goes for India. Wealthy Indians can afford private healthcare, UHC is an option but
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan as a leftist, you should be insisting on action on that front.
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan countless minority populations and rural populations with no access to healthcare
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan for China, it's easy to see and there are many articles on how UHC in china leaves
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan in reference to what claim?
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan why would we want another big, inefficient government program hurting the ppl it was designed to help
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan this is all conjecture. Not to mention, the us can't enact entitlements for its life.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan I'd also point out that many European nations are starting to privatize their systems.
@dumptrump6912 @daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan to what are you referring to?
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan you have an inflated sense of how much money goes to businesses...
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan but yes, if we were a smaller, more economically balanced nation, we might be able to afford UHC
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan can't edit a tweet.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan the math doesn't play out like that lol.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan liberals cry racist so fast. I'm not white, and you completely misconstrued what I'm saying
@daglamier @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan China's healthcare system is terribly ineffective, and they tax people at a much higher rate.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan the cost of UHC has been calculated for the US. Money from DoD wouldn't be close to coving it.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan relative to the US, yes it is.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan I said that China/India healthcare systems don't work even though they are racially very homogenous
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan and didn't have a massive population.
@MottdeWitt @LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan nice try, I'm a first gen nonwhite American. It would work if we were fiscally more homogenous.
@LinguaForte @SpeakerRyan universal healthcare systems in nations larger than our own (china, india) are completely ineffective
