@AOC Hmm, that story was never intended for a Pullitzer.
@realDonaldTrump Without a border there would be no Empire. Nancy Pelosi is a Sith Lord btw.
@thehill Need I state the obvious...
@Peggynoonannyc Narcissist's didn't carry with it the same marketable properties as a broad appeal name like Ram's.
@ericgarcetti @ClimateMayors @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/LoIUQ8QfFt
@KamalaHarris For...the people?!!  More like, the "Me-ple". I know you too well Senator.
@latinostrategy @paulmitche11 That's not going to happen.
@KamalaHarris Indeed, without the efforts of my forefathers I would have never aspired to overcome my days as a Tatooine slave and become ruler of the Galaxy.
@bennyjohnson @pnjaban However. then there was summer camp. https://t.co/5IrSByy3ox
@GavinNewsom @MassGovernor Sith Lord! My Grandson is less of an intergalactic douche bag - and he killed his dad.
@washingtonpost You don't need to see his yearbook photo.		These aren't the racist Democrats in blackface and white sheets you're looking for.		Just go about your business.		Move along...		#Northam #Virginia @vademocrats @VA_GOP
@RepMaxineWaters It appears the Honorable Maxine Waters has at least one foot in her grave.		Time, like the Force can be a powerful ally.
@asmMelendez He appears to be sleeping. No doubt some vagrant.
I too, had an affair with @KamalaHarris. It turns out the force can be a powerful influence against the weak minded.		#KamalaHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisTownHall #KamalaHarrisIsACop
@KenCalvert Unless, I choose to alter the deal.
@NRA @GroverNorquist The ability brandish a firearm is insignificant next to the power of the Dark Side of the force.
@beinlibertarian Fear.
@KamalaHarris Ah but we will padawan Senator.  I will see to it personally.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS The ability to build a wall is insignificant next to the power of the force.		But are we using kaiber crystals for a space based laser array in effort to deter lawlessness at the border?
@FlashReport Order will be restored. If housing is unavailable we will take yours. There is no need too great or small that can't be met with fortitude and vengeance.		What's yours is mine, pray I don't alter this policy platform any further.
@KathyTavoularis Good, good - let that feeling flow through you allow your anger and resentment to build so that you may truly tap in to the power of the dark side of the force.
@SawyerTargosz @Dangerangel Be careful not to choke on your aspirations Targosz.
@ChadMayes @BMaienschein @CAGOP Yes, yes my young apprentice. Darth Swinger is wise beyond his years. As we infiltrate the Democrats culture of lawlessness. It is inevitable that their fate shall become sealed as they one by one become us. #MEGA
@millanpatterson @BMaienschein @CAGOP #RebelScum
@Politics_Polls @Harvard @HarrisPoll Your polls are insignificant to the power of the dark side of the force https://t.co/27k1zXTjVj
@AsmChewbacca @JayObernolte Ah the mighty Chewbacca. Quite the ambitious wookie, but you're no Sasquatch.		#RebelScum
@LaptopShopWH Deal, your mom's driveway. #EmpireFirst
#DonaldTrumpsTheTypeOfGuy to construct a seemingly incomplete yet FULLY operational Battle Station. https://t.co/RMnpVyTt7B
@Lavendermee3 #Pragmatism
@Dangerangel Grammar much?		You underestimate the power of the Dark Side of the Force but you'll soon learn.		#MEGA #EmpireFirst
@LaptopShopWH Mitch McConnell was never in your driveway #RebelScum
@DontThinkso555 You're a rebel spy and a traitor.		#MEGA #EmpireFirst
Initially rejected. I am currently in tight negotiations w/both @HouseDemocrats and @POTUS.		This cost effective Battle Station once fully operational would put an end to the meddlesome border and "asylum" problem once and for all as the ultimate power in the universe. https://t.co/J0GJeV9XgY
@MariaESalinas @latinostrategy Although plans were initially rejected. I am currently in tight negotiations with both @HouseDemocrats as well as @POTUS.		This cost effective Battle Station once fully operational would put an end to the meddlesome border and "assylum" problem once and for all. https://t.co/pnBXvHVoWp
@AdamMillerAD63 Her father was rebel scum and a traitor to the empire. His untimely demise was...a tragedy indeed.		She's not on any mercy mission. Sooner or later she'll make a mistake and become quite the prize for the Emperor.		#MEGA #EmpireFirst
We are in final stages of constructing a weapon that will render @SpeakerPelosi threats obsolete.		While it pales in signifigance to the Power of the Dark Side of the force. Its demonstration will have repercussions throughout the Galaxy. 		#MaketheEmpireGreatAgain #EmpireFirst https://t.co/2UHbKnLxLg
@politico We are in the final stages of constructing a weapon that will render @SpeakerPelosi threats obsolete.		While it pales in signifigance to the Power of the Dark Side of the force. Its demonstration will have repercussions throughout the Galaxy. 		#MEGA #AmericaFirst https://t.co/3o4fUgwwVL
@POTUS must disolve both @SenateDems and the @HouseDemocrats for their insolence.		They are remnants of a bygone era and a last reminder of the Old Republic.		Only then can law and order truly be restored.		#StateOfTheUnion #AmericaFirst 		#MEGA #MaketheEmpireGreatAgain
@KenCalvert Yes, yes but if she can be turned she would become a powerful ally.		I can see to it personally!
You were never given permission to go off script and discuss Venezuela's upcoming elections with the public Pence!		The Emperor will hear about this. https://t.co/8NyUfWCvkh
Don't speak to this Administration about any hostage negotiations Speaker Pelosi, you aren't on any mercy mission. 		If this is a budgetary related funding bill, where are its Co Authors?! https://t.co/97XSDlleUk
The ability to shut down the government is insignificant next to the power of the dark side of the force. https://t.co/lOLo0oHqHV
@LindseyGrahamSC @foxcarolinanews The ability to shut down the government is insignificant next to the power of the dark side of the force.

@elonmusk @physicsJ You obviously haven't had the benefit of making the trek in one of my newly refurbished, Imperial Tie Fighters.  I'll make the arrangements.		We can rendezvous at my upcoming, "fundraiser" Musk, I'll let the Emperor know we will be expecting you.
@VP You were never given permission to go off script and discuss Venezuela's upcoming elections with the public Pence!		The Emperor will hear about this.
@KamalaHarris Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Senator.
Excellent. From the seeds of discord grow the strong roots to the power of the dark side of the force.		The plan is coming together splendidly. https://t.co/w4Ed5QGyUF
@RandPaul Excellent. From the seeds of discord grow the strong roots to the power of the dark side of the force.
I sense a disturbance in the beltway.
