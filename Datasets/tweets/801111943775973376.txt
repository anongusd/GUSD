Trump is weak. Thank you Nancy for showing us how to handle a bully. There will be no wall money in three weeks just as there is none now. Why didn’t he get his wall when he had control of both houses?
Page Seven: John Griffin was elected Mayor of Groveland in the 1980's. He owned a large farm outside of town and lived a cowboy life style. He collected authentic Black Seminole dress, weapons and artifacts. Much history passed away with him. I miss him already. Thanks John. https://t.co/iGIU46es5R

One of the wonderful things about our country is that you can call the President of the United States an idiot and there won't be boots in the night at your door. (At least, I don't think so........)
Lets be clear about why our country is being torn apart. It's because Trump made a stupid promise that Mexico was going to pay for a wall and yokels believed him. Now he wants us to pay for it. Hell no!  Go get it from Mexico like you promised you idiot of a president.
@Nancywillask He is great at grabbing women by the genitals.  Your kind of president.
@brawlmaker Looks like you drank the cool aid.
Trump said he discussed the Trump tower deal "from the day I announced until the day I won."  Now they are trying to walk back that statement. Get the lie straight guys.
@brawlmaker Or like Trump who is protecting the killer crown prince?  Or the one who is Putin's puppy?  The one who has half his cabinet on the way to jail? The one who hides his taxes? Who can't get the lie straight about the Trump tower plan?
@brawlmaker So how do you feel about the deficit today under this nut who was going to reduce the national debt?

Trump went to the memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. yesterday. He stayed for two minutes., commented on the weather and left without mentioning Dr. King's name. During the campaign he asked African Americans what we had to lose by voting for him.The answer is our self respect.

Trump tweets today that Democrats "don't see crimes and drug." Not true, Mr. President. We see the crimes that you have committed. Push Back!
Trump tweeted this morning that Nancy Pelosi is a "radical Democrat." If I wanted someone to come to the table to negotiate with me I wouldn't call them names, but then, that's just me.
Why doesn't Trump blame the Republicans for not getting his wall? They had control of both houses of Congress and he still didn't get it. Man up, Mr. President. Your fellow Republicans failed you. Blame Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, not Nancy Pelosi.
Every time the Republicans repeat the lie that Democrats are for open borders Democrats should invite them to visit hell. Democrats are NOT for open borders. No intelligent person would be. We are against Trump's dumb, ineffective wall. PUSH BACK!
To get his wall Trump offers the Dreamers three more years to live in limbo not knowing if they will be deported. Somebody tell the President this is America, not one of his failed casinos. We don't use kids as bargaining chips.
Pleased that the president met the bodies of our fallen heroes. Thank you.

Trump provoked the ISIS attack in Syria by stupidly declaring ISIS was defeated. ISIS wanted to make a point and did so by targeting a popular place where our soldiers hung out. Presidential incompetence just cost four Americans their lives, or will he blame it on Obama?.
Dead Soldiers Coming Home from Syria	Will Trump meet the plane bringing home the bodies of the American fighters who were just killed by ISIS in Syria? Probably not, what with those bone spurs and all. Watch the coward hide from this solemn responsibility.
Sooo, there was collusion after all? Giuliani just said, "I never said there was no collusion between campaign or people in the campaign." How many times have we heard this lying president say, "No collusion?" Seems to me the bastards have been caught and now the squirming.

The President's (unsolicited ) Psychologist	I want to put to rest questions about Trump's mental health.	He has none.
The President's (unsolicited ) Psychologist	I had Trump on the couch the other day and after a while, got him into a deep, deep, sleep. He was muttering something. When I put my ear close to his mouth,I could understand what he was saying. It was "Ginsburg seat. Ginsburg seat"
Three; So, why can't blacks catch up with whites after being free for over a century? It goes back to who owned the land. They kept the land from us, not to mention the vote. It was intended that blacks would be poorer. And, so we are. https://t.co/RHtbWfmH7u
Two; Mills in the North needed cotton; more than could be produced by former slaves working  plots. Mass production was needed, which meant that although thousands of blacks had died for the Union, their progeny was headed for the cotton field. And the North was complicit in it. https://t.co/8Pl4M3L13b
One: When the Civil War ended, blacks pleaded for land so they could become self-sufficient and independent of whites. Many hoped for 40 acres and a mule. But neither the South or North wanted former slaves to be land-owners. With slavery ended, they were needed as cheap labor. https://t.co/xG46AhjbUW

Little Rock's Central High School became the national focus on civil rights as the school was ordered desegregated in 1957.

These are the black students who were ordered admitted to Little Rock's Central High School in September, 1957. They were sponsored by the NAACP who knew that a test case would likely lead to federal intervention since no southern school district would desegregate voluntarily. https://t.co/mKlh72YSe9

Page Five: I have always found it paradoxical that the people who fought and died for the Union were not rewarded with land after the Civil War. Rather than giving land to those who had defended the Union, land in the South was given back to the men who owned slaves. https://t.co/dhLOcDslfr
Page Four: Neither the South or North wanted ex-slaves to be land-owners. They needed blacks to be cheap labor.The Northern textile factories needed cotton that could only be produced by slaves or cheap labor.The land was returned to plantation owners as the North looked away. https://t.co/okxxtroco8
Page Three: General Sherman ordered the distribution of a few thousand acres of land (forty acres per family) to a handful of ex-slaves. He threw in a few mules. From this has come the myth among African Americans that each black family is entitled to forty acres and a mule. https://t.co/ReXgCVt5ET
Page Two After hearing from blacks, General Sherman issued Special Field Order 15 which allowed for land belonging to former slave-owners to be redistributed to former slaves. In 1866, Congress passed the Homestead Act making land ownership available to former slaves. https://t.co/ByFOPZsFCf

The Ku Klux Klan gathers in downtown Miami for a night ride, probably 1930's. The Klan rode through black areas firing into homes. Black men had to tell their wives and children to turn off the lights and hide under the bed. I wonder how they felt having to do that. https://t.co/6adrlSNRtV

The Ku klux Klan was very active in Miami in the early 1920's and 30's. The chapter in Miami was the state's second largest. They were very active in opposing blacks voting and often rode through black areas prior to election day. The group is still present in  south Florida. https://t.co/Z6Pys5dkDI

@williamlegate @howroute @ixmbass We must never forget that Trump is a showman.  Of course he intended to walk out.  Playing to his base. The problem with having a showman as president is that his real motives can never be known.  Is it for real or for show?  Very dangerous in a president
@Steve_Sailer @AnnCoulter I am a trained psychologist accustomed to estimating intelligence levels.  I estimate Trump as low average possibly around 90 to 100 I Q. This qualifies him to work as a custodian

@charliekirk11 I am black and I live in Miami.  We have a slew of Hispanic racists.
When an unstable, deceptive, despotic,,enraged person is trapped, expect aggression. For Trump, the target will be nation. He will declare a national emergency and seize total power. Even a hint that this could happen should scare the shit out of all of us. But we are there.
If  I am right, that Trump is crazy, now what? Article 25? Not enough guts in the cabinet. Impeachment? There is no law that says you can't be president AND  crazy. Some folks say you have to be crazy to want to be president.  We are in peril. We exist at the behest of a madman.
The President of the United States is decomposing in real time and it seems to me that everybody is looking the other way. A decomposing person loses the capacity to discern reality, is paranoid and a loner. He is trapped in a world he created. This President is mad. https://t.co/twDHtYD8FA
