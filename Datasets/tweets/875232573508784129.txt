@ISafeyet @realDonaldTrump If that is the case why wasn't he immediately arrested after releasing Classified from his viewing that material in the SCIF last year? He got away with it then and he figures he can now. Someone in LAW ENFORCEMENT needs to take him off of his high horse. He needs a rocking horse https://t.co/ESP0jhXFYU
@krassenstein @AOC AOC heard brains and thought they said rain and ran away from it. It shows how STUPID and NIEVE she really is. It's a shame the folks in NYC elected her to represent them because she's making them a laughing stock and her look like a JACK-ASS. https://t.co/1MsWxOBk2Z
@DonaldJTrumpJr As I recall when the members of Congress went to the SCIF, he'd go outside and make calls to the MSM giving them Classified info not to be released to the public. This was how the MSM knew what was in it and he hasn't been punished for that breach of Classified documents.
@Morgan3839 Them or an organization funded by Geo. Soros.  This is done for the riot as well as the brutality that goes with the riot. Now that might not surprise you, because Geo. Soros backs the DNC and most of the DemocRATs who are in Congress. It's like a cabal to destroy our government. https://t.co/EulbsjByO1
@m_recluse @SteveScalise While Chicago might have the toughest gun laws in the country. It doesn't help that their neighboring states have some of the weakest. I passed my CCW testing, and while I'm allowed to carry, I don't. I have 2 other lethal weapons with me at all times. I'm accurate with guns. https://t.co/xE4cuxKEsS
@frefreddiehaut3 I See It		Now one for you.  See the difference in the label. https://t.co/IxSXeoGviy
@IlhanMN Instead of using a Muslim rant against everyone without knowing them, perhaps you ought to get to know the folks who are around you. There are still some good folks out here, but with you lumping everyone together, you can't see the good.
@tazmandb @SteveScalise I've bought 4 weapons and in buying each there was a background check done, but the only thing those background checks were done in the mid-'70s. S&amp;W 686 and Model 66-2, Rugar 22 semi-auto, Winchester single shot 22 used in training Boy Scouts proper way to shoot a rifle.
@lingling23 Seems to me that you ought to have this one in your arsenal. Like the DemocRATs https://t.co/MSnj6djNpU
@SteveScalise Steve, while I believe that background checks need to be mandatory. I also foresee that everyone who has a weapon [gun/rifle] needs to have a background check. This would include background checks for Congress members need a background check as well. https://t.co/atbyvQOVFK
@fritz_liepertz Here's one for you to make a reply with. I know I have used it before, although I do make it clear as you have that my attitude comes from my 3/4 century of life, and yes, I do use sarcasm in some of my responses. https://t.co/KA11Gw6toj
@SarahPalinUSA If he takes it from her don't let Bill give her any info on what is really happening.  He does have a problem though and I have every right to put the information out. The DemocRATs  are the Party of" Jim Crow, the KKK, Affirmative Action and welfare programs that trap minorities https://t.co/j7NjZg8Ugy
@ChuckCallesto She's been sucking those tide pods for too long a period. Most likely needs to have a very good psychological fitness profile done on her to see how much of her brain matter was lost coming out with STUPIDITY. Most likely Cocaine mixed with booze. https://t.co/QE2ajpHYhJ
@vickibazter @DonaldJTrumpJr A group of ultra-mad DemocRATs who have been found out that they have cheated on everything that they have done. Several of them need to see the inside of a prison cell, but I doubt that it will ever happen in my lifetime.  Some of these think they are leaders, NOT BY ME. https://t.co/U1OUW4Uduk
@Boyd_2650 They are not as well healed as those who were in office and are getting a salary while running. No one wants to tell these Freshmen members that they are not allowed to take a salary from the donations to their campaigns. It also shows you what they weren't informed about. https://t.co/ODLXcSBZsY
As for the DemocRATs who have set 2 new gun control measures, I believe that before they can get any weapon of any kind, they need to undergo a background check that goes back to when they were in their teens. For some of you that will be over 40 years. https://t.co/QqXbmc5SyP
@Poruje @senatemajldr Well, since most of the statistics shown are from Calif. , then we CUT-OFF ALL FEDERAL MOONIES that are supporting their ILLEGAL PROBLEM. They are wanting the rest of us to pay for their STUPIDITY. That includes the members of Congress from CA. https://t.co/bXhexRt9nC
@raywatts @bbusa617 @Closer1775 Then bu the definition of Sedition, that also makes ALL of the DemocRATs guilty of this as well. See the attached picture. Now, look at what the DemocRATs are doing even to this present day, they ARE doing the same thing and have since 1952 against every Republican President. https://t.co/Segfc7wdtp
@ISafeyet @TheMarkPantano @hrtablaze @AOC But this supposed Socialist doesn't know that she's on the verge of Communism. The Founding Fathers didn't have in mind Socialism, they wanted a Democracy, nor did they want a monarchy either. AOC needs to read the Constitution and Declaration of Independence and take a test. https://t.co/lifg3dVBD8
@bj_bjshaven @realDonaldTrump Well, the DemocRATs finally figured out how to do an end around attorney-client privilege. But turn about is fair play so those dirty RATs had better figure out what WILL happen to them as well. https://t.co/7XibsoDkB2
@SebGorka Dr. Gorka, have you stopped to consider that with the DemocRAT Party swinging towards Socialism, they are stupid enough to understand that in actuality they are Communists. I know that is a mouthful, but their stands of having the Government take care of ALL won't work. https://t.co/pbt2ulrwVD
@darsavmo Thereby they are playing and end around to breech Attorney-Client Privilege. I have a sneaking hunch that if a branch of the Government were to go after their attorney-client relations, they would go nuts. Saying itsn't legal, well guys/gals what is good for one is for the other. https://t.co/telV0CSpdW
@KatiePavlich The DemocRATs are allowing the Russians and Chinese to take over our government, through their utter STUPIDITY. Someone in that party needs to wake up before its too late for them. https://t.co/VCJX1xiEsT
@w_terrence MSM both video, print, and that done on radio all insert left-leaning spin to the news. But they are adding it into the "News", not as an afterthought. They are also funded in the background by George Soros or his organizations. This is the person who said he HATED ALL Americans. https://t.co/kJlwhB09D6
@FatherVol Both your comment about Nancy and Liberty is #1.  While she is leaning towards Socialism, she doesn't realize that it's Communism in actuality. That entire party is falling away from what the founders had as a Democracy and want what could be called a monarchy. They will say no. https://t.co/DRK7LAAtTy
@RodStryker Let's take the Leftists a step further, their thoughts on Abortion.  There is a problem with their thinking, it's skewed unclear and well out in left field. There has to be a point that there is too young to have an abortion. Similar to that of buying a weapon, not a child. https://t.co/UgNJi6GYcR
@JudicialWatch Well back in '93 Soros opened the Open Society, but in '96 Bill Clinton was President when the US Govt. launched its first programs. Wouldn't you know a DemocRAT would be behind this. It's high time to pull the plug on this LEFTWING program that works against the US Democracy.
@FatherVol Liberty is #1
@FatherVol How long did it take for you to figure that out? Now, they want the rest of the country to bail their DUMB ASSES OUT. If we do, there ought to be someone else doing their accounting and paying $$$ out. If it were me, I'd say raise taxes on all and hope you don't get impeached.
@KAG4All @FriendlyJMC @ECHOtheCALL @LVNancy @5945USARTR @RodStryker @FinishtheWall70 @jojoh888 @_IamAnita_D @whatznextfolks Those who continue to support Planned Parenthood, would. Nancy Pelosi has 5 children, so she ought to be ashamed of her stance. Maybe, if before she was born her mother had had the chance to abort her we would not have her to deal with. https://t.co/go0eE7uQwW
@vickibazter Be glad it isn't a corncob or the pages from a Sears Roebuck catalog. All levity aside, I remember a Boy Scout who had not brought TP to a campout. He had to go badly and was told to use a dollar. When asked why he took so long, he said it was only in small change.
@MSNBC It will be if the DemocRATs follow a Socialist agenda. They have been drawing this nation apart by making pledges to their constituents. Every time they offer "FREE STUFF", there's no such thing as free. That to me is a NO GO POSITION. If you aren't willing to earn a wage =ZILCH. https://t.co/1oBYv2accI
@Don_Vito_08 @AOC AOC needs to be sure of her facts, or lack thereof. Multiple Fact checking agencies are saying she's 100% WRONG. This is what happens when the voters "HEAR FREE THINGS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK, IT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU" At that point, she's DEAD WRONG. Nothing is free. https://t.co/Ldt91vd23D
@SaraCarterDC Ah, he's worked for Trump from 2007. He also knew about the working of DC folks and should have been able to handle them. But he is a LIAR and it doesn't take much for me to think that he isn't below composing to make himself look better. He admits he has NO PROOF OF COLLUSION.
@ISafeyet @YouTube Well, you have that right. But the DemocRAT Party as a whole, are all leaning towards a socialist direction. It isn't all Sanders and AOC heading in this direction. https://t.co/eVtBjlu4hz
@jhorak101 No kidding. I'd rather my setting-up when I want their upgrade installed onto my system. Not all of those updates are supposed to be on everyone's computers. Microsoft has a record of putting untested stuff out. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of being a guinea pig.
@vickibazter @TheRealRaNon @BillOReilly @WSJ @hughhewitt @MorningAnswerLA @JenniferHorn @FiveRights If this statement is true, the "Deep State" then moved to remove President Kennedy. They did so in Dallas fatally killing him with a shot to the head. There was a "Deep State" back then. He'd been warned by them not to do certain things which he did anyway. Learn all of the facts
@OneAndOnlyZel For every baby born alive and is killed charge a DemocRAT who voted against the bill with 1st-degree murder. Let's see how many of them like that little bit of irony.

@WeSupport45 @XavierBecerra @GavinNewsom It doesn't have to sink in. CA  is registering Voters upon the renewal of the driver's license. There is nothing on it to say that these people aren't legal citizens. LET THAT SINK INTO YOUR BRAIN. It doesn't take much to see where this leads...illegal votes, CA doesn't care.
@vickibazter @hughhewitt And you trust James Comey, really? He's already lied to Congress and admitted it. You'd trust him, huh? YOU ARE A FOOL.  Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe owe their honor to Mueller who gave them a job. Not only Rosenstein but his wife for her Deputy AG title even though she's CIA.
@senatemajldr Just think if those babies had been aborted when these DemocRATs were proposing abortion they would not have been born. We'd be less one more obstacle to complete rejection of any abortion. Problem with that is vise-versa. Awe gee, hoist on their own petard.
@realDonaldTrump One thing to remember that your predecessors did as well. It backfired in their faces as well, was to give in to the demands of North Korea. Yeah, then they got a pledge but it never came to fruition. Do not trust without verification, otherwise, it's just words.
@vickibazter I totally dislike LIARS, those spreading innuendo and fake theories about Trump. If that is you, then the shoe fits. Otherwise, we are most likely on the same page at different levels. I speak from the experience of over 70-years of life. Using knowledge to advancing others.
@surfnutsc2 @KamalaHarris @marieclaire She's been guilty of crimes back to White Water. She's no longer in a position of power, so now she's vulnerable for her crimes and misdemeanors and it's high time that she gets prosecuted for all of them. There is no time for a murder committed for her or Bill. https://t.co/0wbnD54G9z
@FiveRights You need to be color blind in your thinking and actions. I don't give a flying flip what color you are as long as you can think without being a racist. Bringing up any color other than yours makes you a racist. Drugs do not care what color you are, as long as you can pay for them
@KAG4All Let's take that a step further, the DNC is being backed by SOROS. Don't believe it the MSM, NPR, AP, Huffington Post, are as well. So if you are watching any MSM news feed you are getting left-sided spin thrown at you all of the time. MSM News is mostly Commentary because of spin https://t.co/bPN1AHnKSX
@Islands1000 That only reminds me of the chainlink fence, a minefield between the chainlink fence inside Cuba, while I was stationed aboard the USNS Gitmo back in the '60s. It worked well enough, but there were some who got through without killing themselves. Understand the Cubans did one too
@RealJamesWoods Those unwilling to earn a wage, ARE NOT ENTITLED TO FREE ANYTHING, PERIOD. I worked for 60 years, and I'm sick and tired of seeing the monies I paid into Social Security going to those who don't want to work. They can go hungry for their STUPIDITY. Anyone not earning gets $0.00
@realDonaldTrump Now, don't forget Robert Mueller who delivered to the Russians the sample of the Uranium to be sold to them. He's as complicit as Hillary is with the Russian collusion. Don't give him get a get out of jail free card for his responsibility. The 7th floor of the FBI needs JAIL. https://t.co/mFlfKmfx2e
@RepAdamSchiff Provided you do it in a non-biased basis. Putting spin into your left-wing agenda into a report, then makes it only commentary. Which I was taught is at the bottom of the report not inside it. You could, however, put your commentary in brackets labeling it as such.
@Jim_Jordan Jim, you forgot he lied to Congress as well. Which has a penalty attached to it too, but I doubt those DemocRATs are willing to hold him for his misdoings. https://t.co/rJZ0b1ld09
@Thomas1774Paine Drug abuse, shrub abuse, it doesn't mean a thing when he breaks the law. He can go to jail and while sitting in his cell without the drugs he'll experience his withdrawal from those drugs. Now, while incarcerated he can lose his job. Since he pulled this crap overpay, no pay now.

@Islands1000 @locomoviewatch That comment almost makes you sound like Adam Sh-t. 28-years military service, 10-years local cop.

@vickibazter But he left his minions in their places and finding these people is going to take some doing. He [Obama] was saying one thing and doing another all of the time.

@Islands1000 @locomoviewatch Yeah, the FBI IMMUNIZED Hillary's whole group even before they interviewed her. Now that is McCabe and Co. He didn't tell the Congress that was done, because if he had he'd have been duck-walked out of the room in shackles. https://t.co/Qvmh8Mar9n
@Islands1000 @locomoviewatch Your problem is that SNOPES has backed DemocRATs and says things that Truth or Fiction says are pure FICTION. Awe, Hoist on your own petard there. Now, how short is your minivan since you aren't in out of the elements?
@RealJamesWoods Awe, I'll make your day, kid. Yeah, I said "kid" since you are the same age as my younger sister. While I was born 12-days after VJ Day, you are a Korean War baby. But we have something that those younger than we are, it's called experience. We live to pass on knowledge to others
@PCMag Careful there I still have a system that runs a version of Windows 1.1 that still operates. Then there are Color Computers, TI-99's, Adam Computers, Commodore systems. All which worked but were primitive compared to today's computers. Which will be blown away in a couple of years

@vickibazter @ScottAdamsSays @chuckwoolery @IngrahamAngle @charliekirk11 But that is on both sides of the aisle if you stop and look at it.

Those of us with non-cloudy eyes can see it. Muzzle AOC.
@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel Adam has been saying that from the start, he still has NO PROOF only conjecture and innuendo. Now, for his knucklehead Speaker of the House, she forgot that Obama made a National Emergency on Border Security in 2011, which yours only allows to continue. Imbascille is what she is.
@trish_regan Trish, the problem conservatives have with the overzealous biased MSM is that they don't tell the truth to the masses of people who watch them on a nightly basis. If they would be truthful and forthcoming, the people wouldn't be backing them as sheep being led to slaughter.
@SashaKapralov12 @LeoNYC @ReaganBattalion Yup, that is exactly what those DemocRATs are wanting for the General Population, but not for them. They pulled the same CRAP when enacting Obama Care. Then Obama looked at the camera and said you could keep your health insurance plan...he lied. https://t.co/TVPXXo8o1r
@RealJamesWoods Their bias was on their shoulders from the get-go. Lying to Gen. Flynn about not needing a lawyer, really. Mc Cabe, Rosenstein are both beholding to Mueller for their jobs with the DOJ. His 21 years of service in the FBI earns him 21 years in PRISON for his lies and deception.
@nytimes Why wouldn't I find that funny, she says one thing to the public and does the opposite with her staff. A case of "The Pot Calling the Kettle Black". She needs to treat everyone as she would want to be treated. You might have heard of the Golden Rule. It still fits in this case.
@ialciah @Briteeye777 Well if they keep going left, they will make a circle. Their wagons will have gone nowhere, all of their screaming will be for naught. They should stay away from things that they really don't understand, Doing the things that they are good at. Backing stupidity makes them stupid
@GovMikeHuckabee How about you look in the '11 Federal Register for the Federal Emergency on Border Security as done by Barack Obama. Trump only continued what Obama had already done. Now, look at how STUPID the DemocRATs are going to look because the Emergency was set by Obama.
Rep @DevinNunes Why don't you take a look in the Federal Registry 2011 for Obama's National Emergency on Border Security. What @POTUS really did was to extend that from Obama's Emergency. Ms. Pelosi ought to go nuts after she finds out that it wasn't Trumps in the first place.
@thehill He most likely could release his personal tax return, but the Corporate is being investigated, and shouldn't be released till that is over. Those in NJ should know that as well. They doing that are being petty, not thinking about the ramifications of releasing that set of taxes.
@Briteeye777 That was what Hillary said, But, that is not necessarily the truth. Although, Those in Hollywood would like you to think that. Don't forget that they tend to be left of center for the most part. That doesn't mean the rest of the country don't care. We stay on top of most subjects
@locomoviewatch @Islands1000 No, I didn't say that. Reread both statements that I'd made, and by-the-way, Bernie Sanders has a net worth of $2 million dollars. The Senator has long been known for his outspoken views on the middle class, the wealthy top 1%, and war. He's a self-professed DemocRATic Socialist, https://t.co/G0WGwF8JLE
@locomoviewatch @Islands1000 That doesn't say he could lead the country at that age, but he could be swayed like a shaft of wheat in the breeze. Carter is doing very little in that mode, but he's lending his name for a good cause. As I said I'm not a Socialist, nor do I believe it's a good idea for America. https://t.co/vpOBgGyQ0l
@johncardillo Now, he's one who should know her every action and thought processes. To me she's so far to the Left, she needs to rethink her position. Her logic is off balanced, fundamentally wrong borderline illegal.
@JudicialWatch If you are expecting the Democratically-led House to do anything, Good Luck on that one. My personal feeling is that she should have been held under 18 U.S. Code 2383 Rebellion or Insurrection, which is what she was proposing to her followers. While she is the leader, she's wrong https://t.co/DqFC4VSYXd
@Islands1000 According to Democrats, I heard on NPR this morning, Bernie Sanders has some ideas, but at 78-years old past his prime. Hillary spoiled his opportunity when she cheated on him during the 2016 election. But I'm not one to like his version of Socialism. He and AOC are a GR8 pair.
@vickibazter @USATODAY @YahooNews @radiotalkermike As for Pelosi, and her ilk needs to be held responsible for their acts. Open borders are part-n-parcel to our drug problem. Hold her and ALL who want Open Borders, for DRUG TRAFFICKING see how fast they change their minds. They can't afford this in or on their records.
@vickibazter @USATODAY @YahooNews @radiotalkermike Florida required a birth certificate in order to renew the Drivers License. Not the one you'd get from the hospital but a Federal Certificate. You give the information where you were born, the Feds make sure the information is correct and issue one that is recognized Nationwide.
@TexPatriotGirl Awe Nancy, you didn't remember that Obama put that National Emergency into place back in 2011. All The President did was to Continue it. Now if this was so egregious now, why wasn't it back when Obama did it? So you want to discontinue what he put in place, was a talking point.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, come on now, haven't you heard of composing. That's where one liar makes up a story to make another more guilty than he is. It's what Cohen has been doing in front of Mueller as well. Defendants do it all of the time, What's to stop McCabe from embellishing his story? https://t.co/5IEQSv79Rj
@vickibazter @USATODAY @YahooNews @radiotalkermike Consider this, how else do they get votes except to cheat. Also by allowing illegals to have drivers licenses, CA is expecting these folks to say that they can't vote. Which is pure hog-wash.

What is funny about Obama enacted this. It was done is that they don't know it was his to Emergency was his, to begin with. Awe,  Jack Asses to bad so sad.
@Francophile1962 @retireleo @SpeakerPelosi Ahh, you can't talk too much. Obama was doing it every weekend, even while he was doing his best to destroy what progress we'd gained in 233-years as a Democracy.  BTW, Trumps Emergency was set by Obama in 2011. GR8 news for those who think he'd done it anew. https://t.co/e6qCrYLH3u
@ArneAlvarado @charliekirk11 @CPmaxine280 Don't you love it when these fools didn't even realize that he was using Obama's original National Emergency? Now how are those AG's from those DemocRAT States going to come up with an offense for something that has been in place for 8-years, and put there by Obama? FUBAR really
@Comey Mr. Comey for a person who is supposedly as learned as you are, why did you allow the politicizing of your department? This is one item that you can't wiggle out of because Obama was President when this was done, so you can't blame it on Trump.  This   leaves the FBI, FUBAR https://t.co/I6gu0GEp4i
@retireleo @Francophile1962 @SpeakerPelosi I'm not sick, but the guy/gal who responded is a died in the wool DemocRAT.

@SebGorka He needs to step down in an Orange Jumpsuit and shackles for his mismanagement during his overseeing of everything. Considering his conflict of interests with Mueller, Comey, Clinton.

@RealSaavedra Now that's funny. She's the one going in front of any news media and making totally false and untrue statements. But MSM won't bother to let \her know she's wrong. So, it takes a few brave individuals to call her out on her blatantly stupid comments. If she deserves them so be it
@retireleo @Francophile1962 @SpeakerPelosi NO, HE/SHE'S A FANATIC DemocRAT. Is for anything they are doing against this country. If folks would stop and think, the DemocRATS aren't in the White House, they aren't the party in the seat of power. They have no rights doing or making any pledges to any leader of State.
@TuckFwitter6 @Thomas1774Paine I was stationed there for over 11.5-years. Also, the deer are no larger than a German Shepherd, and those Iguanas are huge, especially if they have been fed on a diet of canned dog food.

@retireleo @SpeakerPelosi She's not working for the President and has NO POWERS as a diplomat. Therefore she's working against our government. She'd be better off staying on this continent. Next thing she'll be doing is trying to hold a press story from her CELL ON GITMO.
@retireleo @SpeakerPelosi Exactly, but she doesn't care because no one will speak up about it in the MSM. who are backing the left is doing. Someone needs to take these idiots out behind the woodshed and learn them a trick or two. As for Pelosi, she needs to hauled off to JAIL
@perfectsliders He the best of the worst people listed in your poll. Although he has a bad habit of playing with children and young ladies. That doesn't surprise you, does it? I have a long memory for the 3/4 century I've been alive.
@bigjeff651  That bird reminds me of some of the male Cockatiels I used to hand raise. 5 Lutinos, 1 Albino White-faced, 6 Cinnamons, 7 Pearls [Gray/Yellow],, 4 Pieds, 8 Cinnamon Pearls, and 64 normal Cockatiels, yup 95 baby cockatiels. https://t.co/stom8cnewD
@Thomas1774Paine He's one sick puppy who needs to be given a wake-up call with a free trip to a lush tropical island. 80 degree climate year round, 7" of rain in March, fruit-bearing trees all over the place, a variety of different exotic birds and lizards. He'll love it, get a GR8 tan as well.
@jeremyjbaker1 Maybe that ALL members of Congress need to be put on MINIMUM WAGE for their term. Let's see how well they get by and live on starvation wages. They would not be able to rent anything, their dining habits would be curtailed, no quick trips anywhere because they couldn't afford it. https://t.co/gqhAiIgpTT
@AnnCoulter Ann, Why didn't you say something like you did about Trump or were your eyes blinded by his scamming the entire country he was helping it. You were aware that Michelle Obama had lost her lawyers license due to corruption, weren't you? He lost his, as well. https://t.co/MrsbGBv5cQ
@WayneDupreeShow Oh, you didn't know that rules were made to be broken? Adam Schiff doesn't care about them either nor did Cory Booker about Senate rules. So what is new?

@ArneAlvarado Nancy backs illegal immigrants over US Citizens, but that is how they get more people in the House. I hereby suggest that ALL Congress members work under MINIMUM Wage standard.

@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson That is quite true. But if you are expecting to trust Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, to be honest, you are a fool.  They have laid traps in that piece of legislation that will thwart your ability of your calling a National Emergency and 2 Mayors can stop the Wall. DO NOT SIGN IT
@vickibazter @SheriffClarke @USMC @USArmy @tedcruz @LouisGohmert IF@POTUS IS A SMART COOKIE, HE'LL HAVE HIS LAWYERS GO THROUGH IT WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB. But do realize the DemocRATS have it set so you can't call a National Emergency, they also have a provision that allows 2 Mayors to Block your Building a Wall. It is full of booby traps.
@IWasHrren I happen to have a nice long list of those who are in dire need of prosecution. Just look at the attachment see if you agree. https://t.co/avnrb7SboK
@LadyRedWave Never trust the DemoRATS to do anything honestly if they can find cheat. Putting in anything Pelosi or Schumer says means you have to take it with a grain of salt. This is one little surprise that should blow up in their faces, despite what McConnel has said about the deal.
@marklevinshow Personally, he shouldn't sign it. By signing it he empowers Pelosi and Company to pull more crap. To thwart his agenda. This is a losing position if he signs it, she'll get what she wants. https://t.co/f1XlrlsgYR

@DonaldJTrumpJr I wouldn't put it past him to have offshore accounts that aren't being taxed, let along not being put up before any judge. He's an ambulance chaser. Look at his face, would you trust him to be honest with you, really? https://t.co/eh20P6nXag
@marklevinshow There is NO EXCUSE for the vehement language she's been using. She needs to be Censured (reprimanded for those who don't know the meaning of censured) for that.

@ArneAlvarado @RealSaavedra @Shalimar52 Anyone could have had they used their GOD given brains. But, when they were being given out those IDIOTS thought they said rain and ran away.

@SebGorka If he accepts this they won't give him anything more and will have won the argument with him. He SHOULD NOT SIGN IT AT ALL, let those fools stew.

@r98121261 But to fix the Problem in the Education system we will need to DO AWAY WITH THE DEA, and then the NEA. These two groups aren't teaching about a Democracy or what that really is. What they are doing is to make our children dependent on the Government for everything they get. https://t.co/tS7PgKJ86a
@r98121261 Let's take that a step farther, the NEA is dumbing down our children. They aren't being taught to read books or using anything other than a computer. They don't know how to do the math in a checkbook let alone do any handwriting. Just making them mindless followers, PEONS.
@bbusa617 @RepAdamSchiff Awe, Adam is a lily-white JACKASS who thinks he's above the law. Personally, Adam Schiff is an overbearing IDIOT who is pressing his luck.

@WEARAllenStrum @weartv Yup, when I pulled a dump truck stuck to its axles in beach sand and the driver didn't know what to do to get the thing out of the sand. He had dead asphalt shingles in the truck so with a little bit of digging and putting wood and shingles under its tires I pulled with a '93 PU.
@amyklobuchar Good, then you, please explain why the Clinton Campaign paid for Russian dirt on the Trump Campaign? The only one tied directly to Russia was Clinton in the case of Uranium One selling 20% to Russia, and that felonious unverified Dossier. She cheated Sen Sanders too
@WEARAllenStrum @weartv A buddy of mine who's in Belton, Texas said it was freezing with some rain. It this something to look forward to or not? While I know how to drive on beach sand, snow, and icy roads, I don't enjoy the COLD that goes with icy roads and snow.
@POTUS If you allow Russia to dictate what we do, then YOU AREN'T ALL CRACKED TO BE A PRESIDENT. We DO NOT COW-TOW to anyone, PERIOD. Russia does not tell us what or how to do it. As I recall, Russia spent almost 20-years in Afghanistan, they GAVE UP. Don't do their bidding.

@darsavmo Among other things, the DemocRAT Party is known for. The KKK, Jim Crow, Affirmative Action to keep those on welfare (to entrap them).

@JudicialWatch This is what Rep. Pelosi and House DemocRATS and Sen. Schumer in the Senate want to cross our borders. They want OPEN BORDERS, how better to get votes for their party. Calif. is being looked at very hard for VOTER FRAUD because of their policies on Drivers Licenses. https://t.co/t5NEoBgziP
@18cingirl @RodStryker He was giving out info when going in and out of the SKIFF during the hearings on the Dossier.

@18cingirl @RodStryker You can say what you want, but when he visits with Glenn Simpson in July of last year and doesn't bother to let the DemocRATS that he'd done it. It smells of collusion. He needs to RECUSE himself but I'll bet he doesn't. To me, Adam Schiff is a SCHMUCK and He's lied last year too https://t.co/Ox4q0WIoRO
@18cingirl @RodStryker Not really, He had an agenda back when the Republicans were in charge. Not he's done something without bothering to tell members of his House Intel Committee about his meeting with Glen Simpson in July o 18. I have multiple sources telling me this. https://t.co/uSTyC6GJ7w
@DavesBigWife @TheGreyWolf1776 California’s voter registration system is “highly susceptible to being compromised,” because of immigration policies protecting the Golden State’s 2.4 million illegal immigrants, “The state is apparently relying on the illegal alien to tell the state they shouldn’t be registered.
@RyanAFournier She's been listening to Bernie Sanders way too much. At least Sen. Graham has the clout to back up what he says, the average citizen falls for the garbage dribble that she spouts.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Seems to me that is what the FBI Background check is supposed to do Kamala.

@Islands1000 I've known about it and have said so on numerous occasions, but understand I don't count I'm only a citizen. Florida came out and said there were 83K of fraudulent votes made this last election. I only wish they would jail them and/or deport them. I live in NW Florida.

@ColumbiaBugle With all of the misleading info put out by the MSM, I have learned to get my info from more that one source. Now I want you to think about those who are backing your paper.

@dbongino If Schiff had Scrupples, he would recuse himself because of his impropriety last July. Far more likely, Schiff is lying, and in reality, he was busy plotting with Simpson to smear Trump in the name of getting revenge for Hillary Clinton's refusal to campaign in Wisconsin.
@BlackLives_MAGA @CHSommers @dbongino Don't forget your comment is RACIST. "“I’m watching you, white boy.", with that said, then you know there will be slings and arrows thrown back at you.

@marklevinshow It just might come to the point when Supreme Court Justices are only allowed to serve for 10 years and then they are done. No elections of Supreme Court Justices because of the Illegal Aliens voting in our elections now. But term limiting them could stop this CRAP.

But she's not got her hands clean of perverted activities. She might want to rethink what she's planning to do. If any of the money her father got was washed through her.
@dbongino Something tells me that the SCOTUS needs to hold those in charge of all voter registrations to be sure that they are legal residents and citizens before they get voting rights. They have already said that Illegals do not have the rights of citizens. But CA is going to breach it.
@dbongino If they do they are either naive or stupid or both. Every state is looking through its voter rolls and finding illegal votes were taking place. Most of them for DemocRATS. I'm wasn't surprised, because CA told Illegals when their license is due to renew they'll make them voters.
@bj_bjshaven I haven't missed it, nor was I unaware that they were pushing for the "New World Order" in the background. Obama was allowing Jihadists into this country without anything being done.

@ISafeyet @LadyRedWave @BlackLives_MAGA How long did it take you to figure that out? She or her Clinton Foundation have been bringing in illegals in containers on the Foundation's ships.

@schitzsky I do the homework and get the information even from the source in the case of CA. They didn't try hiding what they were doing. Understand the more people in the state the more representatives they get. Illegals are inflating their actual citizenship, they will fight you for it.
All you have to do is to look at his face. It looks like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

@dbongino What she most likely either doesn't know or has conveniently forgotten was that Joseph Goebbels pulled the same crap during the Nazi time. But it was also done by Stalin.

@bbusa617 She's going to push her luck and is liable to fall flat on her face as well. They already give $155 Billion for support of Illegal Aliens and now she's proposing something utterly STUPID. Remember Ms. Pelosi "We the People" will have our last laugh at your expense. https://t.co/9J0Ql4LgZX
Rep. Pelosi, f you say you are quoting from the "Bible", make it a REAL VERSE from the REAL BIBLE. “Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker, but those who are kind to the needy honor him.” Found in Proverbs 14:31. Now, this is as close as I've found in the Bible. https://t.co/MIjIn2bnOE
@dbongino Maxine needs to rethink how she's accusing others for things she's guilty of. You can't throw a stone without it coming back towards yourself and most likely being more accurate.

@LindaRoby8 You are thinking nowadays, go backward 35 to 40 years and in my case 55 years for the BA and 21 for the Masters. There was no such thing as SAT when I graduated High School medical records were almost non-existent back then. Stop thinking today's requirements for yesteryears time
@LindaRoby8 That might be now, but when I first went to college it wasn't the case. Federal law says they can't ask for or see the SSN# which is similar o the way it is for businesses. Without everify, they would not know if the number was real or not. But then again I graduated in '63.
@SebGorka Her mother could have aborted her and then she'd hay no say about it. She's in league with the devil incarnate. Who knows she might be one of his very disturbed angels.

@Soy_Eleazar You might notice I did do my homework, by finding out who had said that before I mentioned it. Something that the MSM doesn't bother doing if it has anything to do against the @POTUS. But I also jumped NBC last year on a story that was far from factual. but was full of commentary
@RealJamesWoods Question to be heard is what each thinks really happened, was it consensual or not? He's a DemocRAT, so consider his thought process. He's trying to make the best out of an unforeseen encounter of his choosing and not get busted as a result. He's stepped into a toxic mess. https://t.co/sWBnV81vUL
@Soy_Eleazar Yes, it is, but I wasn't the 1st to come up with that number, One News Now and Zenith News has said it too. While I do not always trust everything I see on their pages, this one was also confirmed by the CBPO. The DemocRATS are willing to spend hundreds of Billions on Illegals.
@MrFin @DoNotForget911 I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment. But remember in his 1st Inaugural address he said he'd have the most open government anyone had seen. A bold-faced lie he'd told the American public. He's a liar, thief, murderer, done under the guise of obeying the Quran. I have memory https://t.co/jUylWbsWU4
Something to think about the government spends $155B that is spent on Illegals per year here in this country. The DemocRATS are being OBSTRUCTIONISTS toward everything that was offered that they had accepted previously. What a group of total JACK-ASSES they are acting like.
@LindaRoby8 True, but what I pointed out was that his Mother had divorced his Father. She then married Soetoro. Funny how Barack used the name Barry Soetoro to get non-citizen money for college. Sounds like a form of FRAUD while he attended College Barry Soetoro never existed went unchecked.
@vickibazter @hughhewitt The Pope is a follower of the New World Order so where does that leave you if you are Catholic?  Hanging in the breeze, until a greater reformation happens in this world. I happen to believe that GOD ALONE can make changes in the hearts of men and women.
@sxdoc It's quite possible since there is a FOIA order about ALL of Weismann's email, messages be they electronic or otherwise.  He's that dirty and underhanded so as to throw monkey wrenches into the fire, so to speak. ANything to get the attention away from his misdeeds.
@seanhannity Ah, then, we stop all paychecks from hitting ALL DemocRATS willing to back SCHUMER'S and PELOSI's STUPIDITY. LET THEM SCREAM, but until they come to their senses they will not get paid. While it might take 6 months, the younger ones will be broke.
@RealJamesWoods @ICEgov If this illegal immigrant does show up, he/she should be unceremoniously arrested and removed from the House. It goes to show exactly where the DemocRATS stand. They need illegals so they get disproportionate representatives in the House. Do it by cheating the American people.
To the Democrats who keep calling @POTUS a racist. I'm going to say something that might seem familiar to you, call the opposition something that you really are so that people look at them. So are you the reason for bringing up Joseph Goebbels with your rhetoric?  I think you are
@JudicialWatch Both the Republicans and Democrats are proving that neither can be trusted to follow the rules of the Senate and the Laws within the United States. I don't mind calling a spade a spade. They don't want to do the job REPLACE THEM.
@JudicialWatch Something tells me that the Senate Ethics Committee needs to be investigated in depth. If they are found to have broken the rules for the Senate or the Law's of the US, then, by all means, prosecute them. They are not above the Law and it isn't going to stand for scrutiny.
@LindaRoby8 Almost but not quite accurate. Lived in Seattle, WA. 9/'61 to 6/'62. In '64 filled for divorce from her estranged husband, Barack Hussein Obama Sr. Soetoro and Dunham married in Hawaii on 15 March 1965. In 1967, Dunham and her six-year-old son moved to Jakarta to rejoin Soetoro. https://t.co/4UCajlwlbl
@retireleo @bigleaguepol As a former Comey associate, he should have known better. But that goes to show you exactly where the other side lives and whose rights they really care about.

You'll find that Obama - Clinton was in cahoots on the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS  I did a copy and paste of the entire thing which included a 2 page PDF set [* denotes each point in that PDF file] | Center for Security Policy https://t.co/9iskBpmRan
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton It would be nice to see one of those junket trips end up exactly where she doesn't want to go and it be a ONE-WAY trip at that. GITMO sounds like a gr8 place for the ilks of her and those who are plotting against this country. Obama, Clinton Pelosi Schumer, Kerry (Muslim ties).
@LindaRoby8 @ArneAlvarado @stonewall_sue @bbusa617 But Obama did his nefarious deed here in the US and we aren't at war here. Also, Congress has to declare war, not the President. What we had was a police action with other nations, that has transmogrified into a non-declared war which is still ongoing.
@LindaRoby8 @ArneAlvarado @stonewall_sue @bbusa617 But it was not done by Gen. Flynn.. Obama's the GUILTY party. What Gen. Flynn did while at DIA was to expose this overreach by Obama and his buddy's the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS. As long as we can unwrap the wrong that was done by Obama, we'll see a light at the tunnel's end. https://t.co/JzHkISPosF
@juand0wnt0wn @soyjnoficial @AmbJohnBolton @NicolasMaduro @dcabellor @vladimirpadrino @rafaellacava10 @DrodriguezVen @jaarreaza @AmeliachPSUV @CarneiroPSUV You might thank President Obama With PSD-11 the administration engaged with radical Islamists who predictably, rather than pursuing democratic reforms, took advantage of the opportunity to fundamentally transform the region and its threat environment back to the Middle Ages.
@ISafeyet @Jali_Cat @Truthseeker126 @Chicago_Police @fox32news @JussieSmollett @West_Chicago_PD @AJGuglielmi But what do you expect from a supposed news organization that's funded by George Soros the self-proclaimed America Hater?  CNN aka the Clinton News Network, who says anything derogatory against @POTUS. Now, they wonder why they are FAKE NEWS. https://t.co/EHD72SsYxM
@ArneAlvarado @stonewall_sue @bbusa617 As far as I'm concerned, he ought to be arrested for inciting treasonous actions. He and Clinton chose to make it so that perfectly clear that they were trying to destroy our reputation and character of this country. To me, its a means to have them both JAILED for insurrection.
@retireleo @bigleaguepol He seems to be ducking his remembrance of that picture, He's not all Quacked up to be what everyone thought he was. https://t.co/rBK92eJgjD
@mitchellvii Coulter would like to see a weak opponent for the DemocRATS to go against. But so far those who have declared are too far LEFT to be believed and what they have spouted will drive us further into debt than Barack Obama did. Could almost be called QUACKS https://t.co/hsvuLmouQi
@ISafeyet @mitchellvii @BibleBeltDarlin She's trying to go out on a limb and is liable to find limb she's on is a twig. She's showing her disdain for law enforcement as well, even though she was Attorney General for CA. But look where she's from, the liberal area of San Fran. Look at her positions, NO MILITARY at all.
@SANITY_or_not @realDonaldTrump Anytime the DemocRATS are near voting systems, you can bet they have just a bit of FRAUD in mind as well. It seems that Nancy Pelosi doesn't know when to keep her MOUTH SHUT on the Voter fraud subject. Next thing she'll do it step in a cow patty. Where's her muzzle at? Found it. https://t.co/kUxfuQw0e4
@JudicialWatch This is a very good reason to have the "Traitor in Chief" arrested.  Of course, he'll say he's fulfilling the words of the Quran, but he's at that point doing everything against this country which he is supposed to President of. He's proved exactly how WORTHLESS he really was. https://t.co/9AoKjbCRr4
@retireleo @BreitbartNews @Acosta His problem is that it might be his water that sinks him. He's lucky CNN him, otherwise, he just might be a garageman. Which would suit him well. Or, he is the garbage. https://t.co/qPv0o7pzE9
@jakepalmieri @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Time to charge Pelosi and Schumer for aiding and abetting those who are smuggling this CRAP into our country with their LAX efforts on Border Security. I have a hunch that if they both are arrested for just that Border Security will get beefed up fairly fast
Ah, Speaker Pelosi doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut about voter fraud, now it turns out that: Former Stamford Dem Party boss charged with falsifying absentee ballots. Per Stamford Insider | Wednesday, January 30, 2019. So GA and TX weren't the only states for voter fraud. https://t.co/NEA4OKcFr6
@WayneDupreeShow Good if Ms. Pelosi thinks she can hide the FACT that she is deeply involved in the Benghazi with Hillary Clinton. Now I'd like to see her try and weasel her way out of it since Judicial Watch has the paperwork and it shows Pelosi's involvement. Did I say traitorous actions?
@KIMAGA4EVER In that case, I believe she might have a problem trying to figure this one out as well. Two women were sitting quietly together, minding their own business. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN GUILTY OF LOOKING AT OTHERS YOUR OWN AGE AND THINKING, SURELY I CAN'T LOOK THAT OLD.
@dbongino Not good news, they are giving into the Muslim members. Who, by the way, have not totally assimilated into this country's being. This is what happened during the Nazi and Stalinist administrations. Slowly taking away bits of our sovereign rites and rituals. I shouldn't know this.
@Microsoft Before your solid push to Windows 10, you've got to stop putting out junk faulty upgrades. It reminds me of Windows 6.1 which had beyond the alphabet in updates. I for one am tired of BETA TESTING pieces of junk you push down our throats. The original startup garbage. https://t.co/JiPiGQhU2m
@JoeGavi04443005 @Techno_Fog I know, but that doesn't mean it has to be removed from that of the House proceedings. It also doesn't stop the Republicans from making it go back the other way, should they get the power over the House. Pelosi might think she's on higher ground, but reckoning is coming.
@tnmynatt No pay raises for any member of Congress, THEY DID NOT EARN IT.  Their so-called obstructionist crap has gone on long enough. Ms. Pelosi needs to remove ALL of the walls from around her home's walls then she can tear hers down. Since they aren't worth having according to her. https://t.co/x5tn941FO7
@Truth4Freed0m History has a means of repeating itself. Pelosi and Co. are treating our Constitution without regard. Well, they will have to answer to a higher authority, in the long run, Nancy, there is a GOD and HE has the FINAL WORD. https://t.co/EcVTMADTta
@mitchellvii Actually, she needs a less than one term as Congresswoman. She's so far left that the left is shying away from her position. About the only one who believes what she's spouting is Sen/ Bernie Sanders. She needs to visit some of the places she's mentioning and see where they went. https://t.co/mYmihHXeZi
@Techno_Fog Now let's go a step farther, the Dems have proposed to remove "So Help" You GOD" from the oath taken before committees. They also tried it during the DemocRAT Party Convention but pulled it. They didn't dare bring it up when they didn't have a majority but are now. Knuckleheads! https://t.co/7xVLaPiVnp
So the DemocRATS are going to cave into Muslim wishes to strike 'so help me God' from oath taken in front of key House committee. They have not assimilated into our society, but want us to do so to theirs. That isn't how citizenship is done, you become a member of our society.
@Techno_Fog It's deeper than a double standard is why. They feel that the common law that is for folks like you and me are for you and me, but they are above that law. Now, I'm going to say, that there is one above them that will have FINAL SAYand they can't get away from this one. JUDGEMENT
@DiamondandSilk I also agree. Here's something to think on as well. He most likely didn't spout that bias during his campaign, because he knew if he did he'd have been run out of the race. If he did, then those IGNORANT individuals DO NOT HAVE the EDUCATION to know the difference. Dems were KKK. https://t.co/72sSGGd6UQ
@rnsr4u @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept Mueller should have refused the job in that he was involved in Uranium One, in that he delivered the Uranium to the Russians, but you don't hear about that from the DemocRATS since it was the Obama Admin responsible for that debacle. Where is their indignation on that? https://t.co/TTtzzbxO91
@JudicialWatch They play quid-quo-pro at all times. You scratch my back I'll do yours, isn't the way this government should be run. But with those DemocRATS trying to take over even when they aren't in charge. This CRAP HAS GOT TO STOP ONCE AND FOR ALL. Sen. Booker is a JACK ASS and acts it https://t.co/TIaQutSUFh
@RealJamesWoods Start pressing her on the Oath she took when becoming a Congress member. Thus far she has broken it at least 5 times and continues to do so by obstructing border security, backing sanctuary cities, Wanting to destroy the Constitution. She also steals from the taxpayers for trips. https://t.co/9jMrL1ncYN
@jhorak101 @AdamShawNY But I do vote, for good reason. I'm not going to let some LIBERAL DEMOCRAT ruin this country. Your not voting is giving the DemocRATS your vote and one in illegal voting. Do you stand on the side of Nancy or where? https://t.co/ZaTlcyDZ8c
@jhorak101 @KenPaxtonTX @TXsecofstate I saw that already and mentioned it. Now, remember Pelosi said there were NO ILLEGAL VOTES in the 2018 election.  That's BS
@realDonaldTrump Ms. Nancy Pelosi doesn't believe in the Constitution and has said so. So the question I directed to her, still has not been answered.that question. But if she's going against her oath of office is there not a way for lying? Include ALL who don't hold that Oath truthfully. https://t.co/9OlE13X9IH
@vickibazter @realDonaldTrump He's willing to spend funds that aren't his for his abortion factories that he's making hospitals into. Maybe, his Mother should have aborted him and we would not have another liberal idiot to talk about. I will guess he's forgetting that those aborted babies are future voters. https://t.co/2oU1lZh6dI
@EdgeLSeawolf @POTUS Well DO NOT EXPECT that from NANCY PELOSI or CHUCK SCHUMER, they want OPEN BORDERS and this is how they get voters, al-be-it illegal voters. The problem here is Pelosi Hates the Constitution, wants to destroy it. The question I asked her if she supported the Oath she took? https://t.co/jyGyOY8EEB
@SpeakerPelosi  I have a question for you. Do you support and defend the Constitution of the United States in the oath you took when becoming a member of Congress? If so, then Why are you for open borders, where We the People have to pay for their support out our municipal funds?
@DJsTrains I so informed Carman Walter Parks that somewhere down the line you might get a hold of him. Walter and I are about 2 years different in ages with him being the younger. But my retirement comes from being in the military for 28-years and then working for another 20 in my business.
@RealJamesWoods Good ides, because I don't for one second believe her testimony. Especially since she used hypnotism to find our what happened. to be able to say what happened.. What to stop the person administering it to her to input something that didn't happen. https://t.co/DAZdiCRWYa
@DJsTrains  Simple question, Are you familiar with Pwalpar's youtube channel? If not why not? He was a Carman with Norfolk Southern and is retired since he's slightly over 70 now.  I don't have rails around my area, not since Eglin AFB removed all tracks. Closest is Crestview, FL
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @US But Tom, she's been doing that when she was SoH during Obama's Administration. What she has done is to commit FRAUD against the taxpayers. There should be a FEDERAL LAW that she has broken and should be held responsible for what she's done. No excuses for what she's done. GITMO?? https://t.co/lkURl7xmJm
@ISafeyet @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @US They have been each and every time she takes a trip. What the FBI needs to do is to charge her with FRAUD. They also ought to back bill her for everyone who went with her on each trip at a commercial rate for each person. She needs to pay for all of the alcohol she's used.
@Midgespeaks @realDonaldTrump Well, Matt, you and I both know the answer to that question. It's those DemocRATS who want you to think a DRONE can do what a REAL LIVE HUMAN BEING CAN DO. This is the Pelosi philosophy of deterrence and border security. She's what I'm calling an obstructionist WITHHOLD HER PAY.
@RealJamesWoods Drunken I'll except, she's a child abuser as well in that she goes to the perverts island, partake in the debaucheries. She enabled her husband Bill in his perverted activities. Didn't say a thing about them until they came up during her campaign. Should I say she's trailer trash https://t.co/ueH3nl7OCe
@Thomas1774Paine She should have known better, but her attitude is such that she can't do anything wrong. I have news for you Sheila, you retaliated against a staffer who was trying to get the responsible party removed for his action. YOU ARE NOT ABOVE THE LAW, and only the truth can set you free
@r98121261 @Thomas1774Paine Those Hollywood Elitists don't deserve screen time, they don't make policy and their Leftist Views aren't worth a grain of salt. By getting the cameras off of them they might wake up to the truth.  But what they really need to go into work on their jobs stay out of politics.
@OSPREY675 @covfefecomic @mymynags @justyemma @AugustSandmeier @Emeraldireland1 @elam_christie @MaryRiley333 @ConTrumptible @TrumpsAsianChic @kvmidd85 @PaulieD55 @ctanner3 @Whiskey100Proof @galacticaactual @MollyV178 I'd prefer the answer that the other DemocRATS are saying to Ms. Pelosi on her Obstructionist views. Meet with him and make a real deal and pay the money. They are sick and tired of her opposing @POTUS on all counts. 	"Get in the DAMN Room" Give Him the Money" Read my picture. https://t.co/MHqNH9BFUe
@retireleo Technically, Ms. Pelosi can't close the House down that is because it if's "The Peoples House" and she doesn't OWN IT. She can refuse to show up, and "We The People" can demand she be impeached for malfeasance in office, Fraud, wasting taxpayer money on frivolous trips w/family. https://t.co/QgZY4hsTqM
@covfefecomic @mymynags @justyemma @AugustSandmeier @Emeraldireland1 @elam_christie @MaryRiley333 @ConTrumptible @TrumpsAsianChic @kvmidd85 @PaulieD55 @ctanner3 @OSPREY675 @Whiskey100Proof @galacticaactual @MollyV178 I'll vote for that wall, but let's include a few more people. Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, and Ocasio-Cortez for starters. Now cover it tightly, Put a candle near the bottom to prove they still have air. They ought to come around when the candle goes out. Torture used in 1400s.
@POTUS A real breakthrough, send the FBI to Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Arrest her for fraud against the taxpayers when she brings her family on those junkets. She needs to have a WAKE-UP call for her misuse of taxpayer funds. She complains about you, let's turn the shoe around.
@dbongino Ms. Pelosi is a fool if she thinks she can shut down Congress from the House.  Do you really think that you have the power to shut down Congress? I propose, you need to repay the costs of your junkets that you brought your family for those costly vacations at taxpayer expense.
@dbongino What Ms. Pelosi tends to forget is that the President does have Security and can have it without the DHS or Secret Service working. Now I want you to think of what protects him when he flys all over the country and world. Awe, it's the Military and they come better armed always.
@JudgeJeanine Well since the shutdown is taking place, she needs to reassess her position in light of her wasteful spending and family vacations at taxpayer expense. Seems to me she is committing FRAUD on the TAXPAYERS with NO REPERCUSSION. She's been caught and needs to be arrested for crime
@wtester @DUANEALLEN No, She's admitting to jumping the gun and wishful thinking. She's still living in the PAST, hoping that it will become the Future. Problem is that her future still has Trump as the @POTUS. Which is something she can't stomach.  She might as well bury her head in sand, to forget. https://t.co/Tc6zfUc60Q
@retireleo @angela_rye @CNN Got that right Sarge. What a shame he doesn't know the real background of the DemocRAT Party, he just might have to rethink what he's saying. But then he wouldn't have a platform to spew hatred. CNN is one group that is being backed by America Hating Geo. Soros. Think about it. https://t.co/9fbE6095we
@retireleo No, what you have is an owner who believes in God and doesn't fall for the short-sightedness of the left. What the Left wants to forget is that God created the Earth then, did more things to make life here work, but on the 76th day, He rested. That doesn't mean he keeps working.
@OneFineJay True, but this is how we pay for everything. Be it Govt. handouts to the impoverished, our military. It also pays for our Congressional members to squander on crap that they ought to be able to pay for on their own. Do understand that the DemocRATS stole the SS trust fund, too.
@SarahPalinUSA Disgrace admittedly, she, alas, needs to pay back all funds she has overspent by using military aircraft instead of commercial. She needs to pay full cost for taking family members on these trips, Also the total bar tab that she has had the Air Force purchase for her to squander.
I'm glad that someone else realizes what I've known for some time. Obama is a fraud, what he showed in that long form birth certificate only proved that it was a contrived mess using several different parts of fonts in the document. Amazing, I'd recognize that deception by him. https://t.co/d7vJe5nx8Y
@PatriotSmirk Let's wipe those smirks off of their faces with a long vacation to GITMO
@AndrewGillum Mr. Gillum, you then also ought to know that this person is being backed by America hating George Soros. With his backing, it also tells me that I shouldn't trust him any further than I could lift and throw him. This guy is an imposter born in 1980.
@dbongino The "if true" doesn't have anything on Hillary either since she helped him try covering it up. The main problem with the "if true" media is that they are afraid of doing a backcheck on the message to see if it is really real. It's easier to parrot another taking no responsibility
@sxdoc @flatbush711 He's going to have to go a few steps farther to hide the monies he is getting from any group being paid for by George Soros. Just, with that known, I can understand why he's pushing for things he really has no business sticking his nose in.
@dbongino I would like to see Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for releasing Secret and Classified information while he was being shown this information a room for this. He was not to use his phone which he did going out several times to release Classified to MSM. He broke the law.
@JacobAWohl She was born in Oakland, CA. is 54-yrs-old and educated in the Liberal bastion of Montreal;. Quebec, Canada.. Then, living in the very liberal area of Calif. she made her living. I will agree that early education in this country would be a plus. But she's far too liberal for me.
I'll make a suggestion that is a NON-STARTER with Pelosi because it'll hit her in the wallet. STOP ALL PAYMENTS TO ANYONE WHO IS OBSTRUCTIVE TO SECURING THE BORDER BY WHATEVER MEANS THAT WILL WORK AT ALL TIMES. This means YOU NANCY and your leadership, I'll include SCHUMER too.
@renelljohnson What a miscarriage of justice has been handed out. That 1-year-old didn't have any rights, or so one would have thought by what the trial judge handed out to this perpetrator. he doesn't learn anything from his misdeed. The only thing he does get to register as a SEX Offender.
@darsavmo The correct question is WHY ARE CONGRESS MEMBERS NOT CONSIDERED AS PART TIME and their expenses as over the top [which they really are]. LET'S CUT OFF THEIR PAYCHECKS and see them come back to do something for the people who had elected them.
@DonnaWR8 Assisted Suicide is a cop-out for the insurance companies and it allows them to make more money rather than paying it out. Abortion had originally been put into place for Rape and Incest, but the DemosRATS expanded it. Talk about stupidity that's it in spades. https://t.co/Ns5U758LGB
Sen. Durbin (D-Ill) make sure that he doesn't have any skeletons in that Obama Era closet, else he gets his whooped. While the Dems doesn't mind bashing Trump, they are not happy about looking into Obama's abuse of his office. What's good for the Goose, is good for the Gander.
@SheriffClarke Highly possible and plausible for that matter. Now do the simple thing, search everyone [including the executives] going into the plant. Do not allow anyone in the plant until it has been thoroughly checked first.
@freedom_moates Ignorance is bliss in his case, especially since the story was debunked. Personally, we ought to be able to BAN anything he says since he had not checked to find out if it was true. https://t.co/lmEXHgT1X4
@JaniceTXBlessed @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer So, she said, but in Texas, they are prosecuting and illegal for illegal voting.  So what does she call that??
Something that everyone wants to forget. Obama's sheer stupidity. JFK put men on the moon, and Obama put men in ladies restrooms. Some Legacy isn't it. https://t.co/d9cS3Mo6wI
@jhorak101 You don't care that FaceBook allows 3rd party vendors to sell your information including your email addy. Facebook’s strategy in times of crisis: delay, deny and deflect. Critically, Facebook’s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy reviews. I do.
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx Seems that Twitter has put a KABASH to the comment about the DNC.  But, what needs to be impeached is the DemocRAT leadership in the House. If they don't want to do their jobs correctly, then their removal is called for. https://t.co/yAnWxZ9oU3
@jhorak101 @FoxNews Jim, we can't help it when the Liberals in Hollywood are still stuck with their heads in the sand. Most of what they have done is FUBAR. When I was in service we had other words or acronyms which would fit everything these folks are doing and then put it in the right place. https://t.co/e9GeH1yKHy
@RickMurdock3 @vickibazter @kaci150 @realDonaldTrump We are talking in the same direction, what I did was to point out his shortcomings. His dealings were on the verge of being totally illegal from the get-go. A legacy for sure, but not the kind to be very proud of. He allowed 9000 Muslims into this country even the UN NO to.
@GregAbbott_TX About time this is done in every state since it's against Federal Law as well. But there seem to be some of our states who don't believe that holds true. They gave illegals drivers licenses, then said when they renew the license they will get registered to vote as well. CA is one
@sxdoc @SpeakerPelosi Let's fit her with an electronic tag that shocks her when she goes wrong. It'll give her a shocking reminder. Sometimes training older adults can take a jolt of a stimulus to get them started. Here a shock there a shock, everywhere a shock, shock, gets her going a correct heading
@vickibazter @RickMurdock3 @kaci150 @realDonaldTrump The Crusades in reverse. Think about it, if your study of history isn't lacking. Europeans invaded Muslim countries to "Convert" them from their backward ideas. But this turned out to be a grave mistake with dire consequences as the European countries are finding out. Wake Up! https://t.co/HviNaVOkoM
@RickMurdock3 @vickibazter @kaci150 @realDonaldTrump You keep thinking that, but go back to the Crusades in which European countries invaded Muslim countries to "convert them". It was an abstract failure with grave consequences which are now being felt all over Europe, and now the US. Don't divert Obama's responsibility for this. https://t.co/lCqHAZbC73
@vickibazter @RickMurdock3 @kaci150 @realDonaldTrump Ah then, might need to revise that map. Include MN, ND, and MT, then. Do not forget Obama allowed 9000 Muslims into this country when the UN said that they weren't vetted. But then again what would you expect from a person trying his best to knock us down? https://t.co/ecoGQKZMZi
@vickibazter @RickMurdock3 @kaci150 @realDonaldTrump Texas isn't totally RED, so let's make that distinction to your map. Beto O'Rourke while he did raise a stir, he didn't win.
@MichelleToland4 @SenSchumer AdThey the DemocRATS do not like the Constitution what-so-ever. But that has been as long as they were DemocRATS as well. Add Pelosi to your mix and it'll be a closer picture. https://t.co/RQXIuDdoIw
@vickibazter @hughhewitt Now how long did it take you to figure that one out? As soon as I saw that Soros is involved I knew they wouldn't be on the side of good. But let's not leave out the DemocRATS who are also being paid by Soros or his organizations, they are a guilty as he is. https://t.co/eYOE7VXCX8
@vickibazter If Nancy manages to survive the rest of the week, I would like to think her straight jacket would be in hot pink and her helmet would glitter and sparkle. If folks stop telling people she's freaking crazy, she loves to see the surprises on their faces when they figure it out.
@vickibazter Elitist's children think incorrectly that they have the same capability as their misguided Mother or Grandmother. Well, they found out differently, now if they can get that through to Nancy. Nancy, think: Age is just a number, and oh Yeah, and Jail is just a room.
@RedPBlueP What bugs me is that a person who is before the Special Prosecutor has pled guilty, is allowed to "compose" and BuzzFeed falls for it hook, line, and sinker, They are not doing their due diligence as reporters if they aren't going to backcheck the story. https://t.co/nKbpAfuVsr
@darsavmo Hold on there Nancy I found your plane, It's listed as Air Farce One. https://t.co/rhtYwLC1PS
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Simply put CUT OFF ALL CONGRESSIONAL FLIGHTS, period. Let them fly COACH, NOT FIRST CLASS unless they pay for the difference out of their pockets. NO FOOD or DRINKS on the public tab anymore while flying. If Nancy had had to pay for those trips they would not have been made.
@IndyK46220 @Sweet_PeaBelle @SpeakerPelosi I'll go with that. But while you are at it IMPEACH them, so their resumes can't be covered up. This will stay with them until they DIE. Pelosi, Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez, Schiff, Feinstein, Waters, Sanders, Blumenthal, and Booker to name a few. How's that nail, now? Hit it on head? https://t.co/MlQqJwbbt7
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @ImpeachNancy She read it when in school. Since she's been in Congress despises it. She's not fit for the Congress what-so-ever. But look at the State she hails from and you'll see the reason. Yes, I have bee to CA. but that I was bask in '62 when the country was far more civil with each other
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @ImpeachNancy But it allows you to take a junket at taxpayer expense all over Europe, right? FORGET IT!!! It won't happen on my Dollar or anyone else's for that matter. But don't only stop with her, take Chuckie as well with the Impeachment. https://t.co/rVxD1xZgER
@DiamondandSilk That is Bill S--t so she can take trips all over Europe. Trump also stopped that stating security reasons. She's FUBAR and trying to prove it. https://t.co/PTWCZynRRK
Why did the DemocRATS not say anything when Obama allowed over 9000 people banned by the UN into this country? I believe there is collusion by those same DemocRATS now that Trump is in office. Are they going to try to bury this piece of history? Accountability, is primary, here.
@RodStryker @Rambobiggs Awe, heck, he's made the DemocRAT Party FUBAR too Boot. His was a blatant display that no one who didn't have BRAINS and EYES to see exactly what he was doing. But those in leadership in his party didn't care that he was pulling the rug out from under the country. Traitorous act. https://t.co/47R4sWaGzR
@girl4_trump She's a "Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" trying to push her agenda on the @POTUS. At which point if I were he, I'd go along with the State of the Union speech as is scheduled, not letting that Elitist Nancy Pelosi get her way over his schedule. She's come out with some DUMB ideas. https://t.co/5LWRZjmyiN
@SteveScalise @POTUS Well, Steve, the Freshmen DemocRATS are going against Pelosi's left-leaning views. If she's not careful they will overthrow her as Speaker. Now wouldn't that be a gr8 thought? Pres. Reagan had the right thought with this about Fascism and liberalism. Let's remove Pelosi. https://t.co/v19UY4eOAN
@AnnaApp91838450 @BreitbartNews Bill, Do everyone a favor, roll out of the other side of your bed. You just might wake up to reality and figure out that Hillary lost the election. Even after she'd cheated Bernie to get the nod. While your rant might get you in good stead with MSNBC, it's not helping your image https://t.co/G9yvezKYNi
@AnnaApp91838450 @BreitbartNews Nancy's leftist views aren't held by all of her party. She'd better watch out that she isn't overthrown because of those views. Not everyone likes how nothing is being done on either side. President Ronald Reagan said it right. https://t.co/cp23w5kDao
@Jim_Jordan Now you are expecting those DemocRATS to do any real investigation? Don't hold your breath. What  you might want to do is to find out how many on Muellers team have dealings with the FDA also are  part of a group planning to take over the medical records of all Americans.
@Man1Jamaica @sxdoc @realDonaldTrump I was talking about GEORGIA, never mentioned NC, but do have the documentation and photo taken from https://t.co/bvyiTFEK8z.

@bourbonfly @dfrance1975 @sxdoc @realDonaldTrump No, actually I got my photo from https://t.co/bvyiTFEK8z and this was one Georgia precinct. If you are going to question or throw out WRONG DATA, you'd better do your homework and come up with real stats. https://t.co/okjYprUVal
@retireleo @RealJamesWoods That isn't hard considering, the games the Dems were pulling before. Now we'll watch them try tearing down good honest people. Their bias with their stupidity shows. I like seeing Mr. Barr show them he knows the law better than they do. Heck, he's even doing to both sides.
@r98121261 Sarge, you should be aware that the NY Times is being backed by George Soros and his left-wing organizations. If you didn't you do now. But you also know Soros HATES AMERICA and ALL it stands for. https://t.co/EUqUWYZiiK
@sxdoc @realDonaldTrump The DemocRATS want Illegals in the country, it's how they get voters. A prime exam[lewas in one Georgia precinct where there were 679 ballots for only 270 voters on the roll. She's not thinking like a REAL American but ay 78 she's over the hill, needs to retire. https://t.co/l8bWQ3dTIU
@WEARAllenStrum Something to make you feel good. A sunset in Utah while on a train going to California. But I thought of you when I snapped this. https://t.co/e3FzOMGbgR
@ScottPresler @Montel_Williams Consider who said it a Liberal DemocRAT. He's still mad that Hillary lost back in 2016 couldn't buy enough voted either. As a former Scout Master, I know what it takes to become an Eagle Scout since my troop had 3 of them. 1 is the Rev. Dr. E. R. Glaize, it takes lots of work.
@DiamondandSilk She's one to talk about funding since she was getting it from people who would have their dirty hands into our FDA and medical records. She's as dirty a politician as they come.. her campaigns were financed for over 20-years with 2016 Presidential race in mind. Good, she lost.
@A3Patriot @realDonaldTrump With knowledge, you can figure that the DemocRATS are manufacturing this crisis, not President Trump. The DemocRATS get illegals to vote in our elections, despite the fact SCOTUS said that they don't have rights of US Citizens. Think, 670 ballots in a precinct with 276 voters. https://t.co/qhPPvVuOLz
@jeepsuzih2 @ROCKONOHIO @pinkk9lover @SteelTyton @MazurikL @MagaGoldHat @KimberlyMrsRR1 @LaylaAlisha11 @KAG4All @skb_sara @kelly_ramona We can build the wall by taking welfare, medical, changing education for ALL illegals. The savings in those areas would eliminate wasteful spending on those who haven't paid taxes for it. We shouldn't have to give them anything for coming here illegally, that down-right STUPID. https://t.co/2GAz2sBu5b
@RodStryker Not only it will, but then they just might have to follow through on the pledges they'd made to get elected. Like helping those in the slums get meaningful jobs. Thus removing them from Welfare. They would have to use all of those talking points with help American citizens. https://t.co/Yg4wyrJGP2
@1GoldenBuckeye A quick comment, these are the same folks who poured 10's of millions of dollars into ALL of Hillarys runs for Congress and the Presidency. Had she won they would have been in charge of our FDA since they have also poured several $100,000's into that Department. Knowledge helps.
@1GoldenBuckeye Sorry Cory, but the Cat is out of the bag. Hillary's friends are trying their best to corner the Drugs market and you will be unable to help them as well. I'm talking Billions in Drugs, our health and financial records would end up in their hands. And you said what? I'm no fool.
@JudgeJeanine There was also an AP report that Nancy and Chuck were in Hawaii as well. I think the MSM is throwing up smoke screens to bewilder us.
@A3Patriot Well, let's give them something to think about. "We The People" ought to demand that these DemocRAT elitists see the demands of our madness. At 78, Nancy Pelosi needs to be automatically retired, NOW! Chuck is 68 also needs to retire. No Congress member over the age of 65 allowed
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Just the reason Pelosi and Co. want the border left open. Steve, please remember she's getting old senile and should have retired 13-years ago at 65. She Hates the Constitution, our immigration system, the President, and American Democracy. She's a confused liberal Socialist. https://t.co/5clfOnzkOT
@jamiethack Drop him in on the other side without a lifejacket. Hopefully, he knows how to swim.
@DiamondandSilk I wonder how she'd like to have a lawsuit laid in her hands over something that she didn't think was worth doing anything to the illegal who'd shot Mr. Singh [an American citizen]. But you have to understand, she Hates the Constitution, Democracy, and America. she's 78-yrs OLD. https://t.co/lofaAADSBE
@realDonaldTrump Well now is about the time to spring the trap and pull the rug out from under Chuck's and Nancy's feet. Let them settle down on their asses, but I'd prefer it was atop cow manure, then they would have a right to have a foul smell. They voted for both a Wall and Security. https://t.co/skwKQCs3eM

@pocono_mtn Not if people who know the differences between Communism, Socialism, Fascism, and a Democracy is. Now I want you to look at what the DemocRAT Leadership is spouting, it doesn't have anything to do with a Democracy, but it is of Socialism which leads to Communism. THINK PEOPLE.
@vickibazter @realDonaldTrump Actually, she vowed jihad against all White Americans. Since she has lied, she's basically eliminated her right to hold the office for which she was elected for. But I also want you to remember, the 44th President pulled the same on the American people. Don't be fooled backcheck! https://t.co/66K0yA25aC
@trish_regan @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump I'll put this simply Chuck and Nancy are Anti-Constitution / American liberal leftists. They want open borders, how else do they get voters who will be their "Subjects" getting govt. doles for their living. Think folks, our border security helps your cash flow how much you make. https://t.co/JdtMevr1TL
@Liz_Wheeler Border Wall, well you also might mention that those RATS voted $40B for Border Security in 2013 as well as for that Wall in 2006. So what was different Trump wasn't in office then. Don't let them bamboozle you with venomous crap. They are Anti-Constitution / American https://t.co/9a3PNpZGvV
@robbystarbuck Understand, we can be outraged while liberal judges will release these offenders to plague folks all over again. Until judges start using their common sense through thought and the rule of Law to do justice for all instead of the illegals. Let's take the liberal judges to task.
@TomFitton You'd better take a deeper look at Hillary Clinton and those who were donating to her campaigns back when she first ran for office, about 23-years ago. Because that was when she and her group were planning for in 2016. Had she won they would have made Billions.
@realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump Those voting "F" are ALL DemocRATS. But I do wish that they could remember back to 2006 when those same DemocRATS voted for a wall. And in 2013 these same RATS voted $40B for Border Security. So what is new, the DemocRATS wanted talking points not to do anything. Traitors.
@RodStryker @charliekirk11 @dbongino @RealSaavedra @RealCandaceO @MikeTokes @DineshDSouza @DonaldJTrumpJr @michellemalkin @JudgeJeanine @Thomas1774Paine It's simple, we deport both of them to GITMO and they can be happy together.

@WhiteHouse Any judge who doesn't do his due diligence, find out if those in front of him/her are here legally need to be removed from his/her position and NEVER allowed to hold any position requiring real thinking and study. I understand you get BAD EGGS but judges should be able to do it.
@DonnaWR8 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov Let's make a ruling letting Law Agencies know that if they arrest an illegal for a crime and don't report it, then their agency will be cut off of ALL funding for things that they want. Make them pay for being STUPID, Include those making rules which will endanger the public.
@debramzemke Oh, I''m not. But I am saying that "We The People" have more clout than these elitists might think we have. They aren't above the law, although they might like to think so. I do have a slight advantage in that in the military I did hold a law enforcement position. Let's Jail 'em. https://t.co/0gXUZhM1BF
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller Anyone who is implicated needs to remove him/her self from that committee. This is to take all impropriety from anything that the Senate Intel Committee meets on.

@NHL After watching multiple hits where a doctors presence in needed either on the ice or at the bench. Have you ever considered putting a switch at each bench where they can get medical attention rather than having to yell and scream for it? This could enhance help faster.
@cher Her venomous rant only lacks a real focus. It's all over the place and doesn't really hit the real subject. Had she thought back to 2006 when the DemocRATS voted for a Border Wall in 2013 these same RATS voted $40B for Border Security. Where's your anonymous for that? Meathead. https://t.co/dA4p19A13e
@DonnaWR8 Time to IMPEACH the Leadership of the House and Senate DemocRATS for their gross lying to the American people because they want OPEN BORDERS. If they want open borders that much send them to Germany, Poland, England and let them find out what that means. Blood on their hands. https://t.co/ZzAteiz1ac
@SaraCarterDC Trust Mueller to hand pick who is hearing the case. But in reality, she should have by all good sense recused herself for this case. Goes to show just how deep Mueller's animus is towards real truth. He's a dirty cop and he's proving every day. https://t.co/8SIhdXO8Us
@bj_bjshaven @realDonaldTrump 10% my fat Arse try 19.6% compounded from the time it was paid out to the present date. Any monies paid out to keep a scandal from the public isn't right.

She calls folks "Racists" shi as well. https://t.co/vMMQFlr4fd
@benshapiro But, how do you expect that they will get away with getting new Ilegal voter's? The DemocRATS want Open Borders, they Hate our American system.

@DonnaWR8 @pocono_mtn We sure that isn't he DemocRATS trying to figure out who they want to be mad at next? Just remember those same DemocRATS voted in 2006 for a Border Wall,, and in 2013 $40B for Border Security. What's different both times DemocRATS were in charge. They wanted talking points only. https://t.co/NlHGIU2TDk

@seanhannity Not if that new FBI Head has anything to do with it. He said he was not going to shut Mueller's witch hunt down. As far as he was concerned he was doing it legally.  This new chief had better look into his background then. https://t.co/EHm00FpnXl
@jasoninthehouse Well, don't fail to remember that those DemocRATS voted for a Border Wall in 2006, and voted $40B for Border Security in 2013. This was also done while those same RATS controlled the WH. so all of those votes were for Talking Points only. I haven't, what about you? Blood on hands https://t.co/oHwqBGDcCC
@seanhannity It would be good if she got the correct information out in the first place. ICE is not the Broder Patrol. False accusations will provide further discrediting her capability. So as long as she puts out wrong info, we'll continue to belittle her falsehoods. https://t.co/pqBzXKv2wH
@TurntNTexas @afbranco What GR8 IDIOTS vote for a Border Wall in 2006 and then $40B for Border Security in 2013. But there was a DemocRAT in office. So these DO NOTHING RATS did exactly that. Talking points DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. Real work on Border Security does. These 2 HATE AMERICA. https://t.co/MsufStzrU8
@realDonaldTrump Even if you have to remind the DemocRATS over n over, keep at it. 2006 along with Sen. Obama, voted for a Border Wall. In 2013 these same RATS voted $40B for Border Security. So what is new, a DemocRAT was in office, their doing nothing but having talking points. https://t.co/rgsLriICxk

@ISafeyet @PoliticalShort @RARRRRR @realDonaldTrump They don't want to do they're jobs then REFUSE TO PAY THOSE CONGRESS MEMBERS. Think of the savings you'll get.

@DickerTroy Well, as a vet, I fought for your right to not care about what the DemocRATS are doing for our Border Security.

@SiddonsDan @trish_regan In 2006 they voted for a Border Wall with the then, Sen. Obama, in 2013 they voted for $40B for Border Security.

@RealBasedMAGA @RashidaTlaib We can thank Obama for allowing them into the country with vetting them.

@seanhannity But Ocasio-Cortez is a "Racist" by her comments. She's even asked that folks excuse her miss-statements, well this is her radical rant coming out, and there is NO EXCUSE for it.

@PaulSllvn @Change It'll take more than one person, and my proposition goes after them all. We could look at malfeasance in office as one article for their impeachment.

@riram75148489 @POTUS But these coming in don't want to become Americans they want to keep their way of living and have us follow their BACKWARDS WAYS. SHARIA LAW is not compatible with the US CONSTITUTION as said by SCOTUS last year. Ms. Pelosi is out of her head and needs to be IMPEACHED.
@IWasHrren Mueller's attorneys have a history of doing just that going back to the Whitey Bulger case. So what's new? He's still up to his old tricks, using subterfuge, lying to defendants, and withholding information that comes with discovery from defendants lawyers. https://t.co/HbFktd7pbL
@w_terrence I've got something for you to take a gander at. Now figure out what I've said about those who would call for the impeachment of our President. Something tells me that these so-called left-leaning activists are off balance and want to see how far they can push the Dem leadership. https://t.co/gOl5aF9hHK
@dbongino I sent Ms. Pelosi a message about cutting off ALL welfare to illegal immigrants, either that or fund the wall. I	 said further that the illegals had no skin in the pot so they didn't deserve anything, including medical. https://t.co/R1rqg9YNQf
@bigleaguepol Seems that Chris Wallace is still mad that Hillary LOST the election about 2-years ago. Ever since part of FOX NEWS was taken over by ABC, their reporters have gotten more combative. At one time reporters weren't opposing everything said to fit it towards a left-leaning agenda.

@JoeGuzm27203871 @SenSchumer Obama was in office and they knew nothing would be done. But on the same foot, they voted for a border wall back in 2006 when Sen. Obama also voted for it. They vote for things only to make a talking point not to do anything. https://t.co/DsDK9QVgsP
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Let say we bring up the same charges on those who would want to impeach the President and let them squirm and stew over the thought of "We The People" revolting against their farcical crap. I have a feeling that they won't like it one iota.

@Boyd_2650 @POTUS If I were those two judges, I'd be fit to be tied once I found out about this information.

No one would look in these https://t.co/te0GbQUjYj
@GOP I just said something that you most likely have not said to Speaker Pelosi. No finding for Health - Welfare to immigrants who do not have any skin in the pot. Also, I made an open suggestion on Twitter to CUT OFF ALL FUNDS GOING TO GEORGE SOROS and his organizations. https://t.co/WmJLBAz34h
@JudicialWatch It's about time to cut OFF ALL FUNDS GOING TO GEORGE SOROS' AND HIS OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. Now there is a source for funding the wall if only to get the DemocRATS right where it hurts. They love giving away $$$ to everyone without SKIN in the deal. Now it is time to stop that.
@SpeakerPelosi How about this, you say no money for the border wall? ALL MONEY FOR IMMIGRANT WELFARE GETS CUT OFF AS WELL. No monies will be available for you to give to those who have NO SKIN in the pot. Makes good sense to me, how about you. We will not spend any money on that.
@starcrosswolf I wonder if the Airport Authority could do the same thing as was done in a public school.  In essence, they would have to follow our countries laws and integrate. Sharia Law does not trump the SCOTUS ruling about Sharia Law. It isn't over our laws what-so-ever. Integrate or leave https://t.co/OHfEiJztCW
@RepMattGaetz Matt, you are close to being right. They say what the people want to hear. That doesn't mean that they will do what they have just told the "people" they would do. They promise to be giving away stuff, but who pays, WE DO, not those getting it because they don't pay taxes. https://t.co/Jp8VCtrJRb
@vickibazter If she and Mr. Schumer are want to spend billions on giving them medical and food stamps they are about to be sadly mistaken. "We the People" will revolt to their wasteful spending. If the people getting anything from the taxpayers, they need to be putting in those funds for it.
I've got a serious question for Rep. Pelosi, would she be willing to tear down the wall around her houses if they don't really do anything? If your answer is NO, then you are a Hypocrite on BORDER SECURITY. That wall around your house is a border wall and we need it as well.

A shadowban only last for a short time as set by man and they will screwup, be found out and stopped.
@NavalInfantry They, (the DemocRATS), want open borders, no ID cards that accurately identify a person. Thus making it harder to say there was foul play when illegal aliens are voting.. Heck without the illegals they most likely would not get voted in. Free stuff paid for by taxpayers.

@realDonaldTrump Please remind the DemocRATS that they voted for a border wall back in 2006.

@jasoninthehouse Neither will happen, Jason, these two aren't above forgetting a vote they and the past President voted for a Border Wall back in 2006. This is something that they don't want anyone to remember. Schumer is a LIAR from the get-go and Pelosi is no saint either. https://t.co/2uopXyQbRr
@seanhannity Sean, you and I both know that is the truth, but they don't want to hear it. Considering the countries they have put into responsible positions. It is these who really need to be removed until they prove they are above being obstructionists against those who really need the help.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Lisa Barsoomian is an individual protected CIA operative. Additionally, Lisa Barsoomian has specialized in opposing the Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of the intelligence community. And although Barsoomian has been involved in hundreds of cases, she's a US Atty. https://t.co/KtvQOHOrH5
@azfury No how do you expect the DemocRATS to get new voters?  They are looking for illegals in sanctuary states. That is why there is a hew and cry about the reference to citizenship in the census for 2020. Just think if they can't get illegals they won't win. https://t.co/ARDNoZWoLS
@MazurekRob @realDonaldTrump So what's to fear, George Soros is backing them. Both have been in his pockets for years and neither one can be believed. What we need to remember is that lying sack-o- sh-t standing up on the platform. You take your pick on the description. Just Remember Who Did What. https://t.co/EP399dlsNe
@LokiSullivan You really want the truth, they're being backed by the America Hater George Soros. Everyone who could say anything about it on the DNC and DemocRAT side are also in his pockets. She has a cabal of individuals working against her trial. So good luck finding an honest lawyer-judge. https://t.co/yF9cM85ZSr
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Notice who is funding MSM behind a firewall so you don't even realize it's not totally the truth when you get to hear it. Most of the times it is mostly commentary with sporadic bits of news placed into their story. Notice they don't mark their commentary. https://t.co/4hVtSEGJTK
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Have you ever noticed that the MSM doesn't say anything about this news since it wasn't in their interests? So, to Judicial Watch, keep up showing how the MSM is working against National Interests of this country and other countries in this world. This news needs to be put out. https://t.co/6i2zzkNxog
@GrouchyOldBiker @PatVPeters @RodStryker @chuckschumer @POTUS @DNC @TheDemocrats @GOP Here we go again, but "We the People", have to be a constant reminder to the Democrats about their vote of 140 DemocRATS refused to vote 'YES' on a resolution condemning voting by illegal immigrants in our elections. But we need to remember this is how the DemocRATS get elected. https://t.co/cVUXlWzT8d
Sequel:  It makes me sick that many of "We the People" don't pay attention and do their research before they vote. Also, those don't pay taxes shouldn't be allowed to vote because they have no skin in the game. They will always choose those who will give them free stuff.
@Politick_Rick Angela, you can roll over and forget that comment. Seems that you are lockstep with George Soros and his ilk. You are reminding me of what Hitler tried and FAILED EXQUISITELY to do. Now, why would any god fearing country want to give up their rights so you ilk can squander them? https://t.co/9orSLXp5aU
@mitchellvii If I didn't know better, you almost have the look of Lee Marvin. He was a WWII US Marine veteran, who passed away in 1987. 	As that isn't the case with you, may you have a happy and prosperous 	new year.
I have a plan to END THE SHUTDOWN, REFUSE TO PAY ANY ONE OF THEM WHO IS AN OBSTRUCTIONIST. ALL d the DEMOCRATS and any REPUBLICAN WHO WANTS TO PLAY FOOTSIE WITH THEM. The ENTIRE CONGRESS MAKES ME SICK. They play their games at our EXPENSE. Do the PEOPLES WORK NOT YOUR AGENDAS.
@RodStryker @SenSchumer Border Security, DACA, Gun Control (he'll take your away while he keeps his). In 2006 the DemocRATS voted for a border wall along with the then Sen,. Obama, so what good did it do, none. He's almost as bad as FaceBook an OVERBLOWN HAZ-BEEN LOOKING FOR VOTES. https://t.co/0bN4cYjPF3
@GrouchyOldBiker @PatVPeters @RodStryker @chuckschumer @POTUS @DNC @TheDemocrats @GOP YUP! They are quite good at it and have been for over 72 years that I know of.
@GrouchyOldBiker @PatVPeters @RodStryker @chuckschumer @POTUS @DNC @TheDemocrats @GOP What you call "lip service", I call "TALKING POINTS". They say what the voters want to hear, but never follow through with anything. The people need to hold these LIARS to the TASK AT HAND. If they don't do what they said, then we ought to have some say on their getting paid. https://t.co/8d3Z4RAY1a
@RodStryker @chuckschumer Now how long did it take you to figure that one out? Not being a wise ass on that subject, but I've pointed that out several times and let the @POTUS know about the Vote of 2006 where Sen. Obama also voted for it. Schumer is a hypocrite on BORDER SECURITY. https://t.co/3LOkT6jPVs
@retireleo Now here's the RUB, Mexico is DOING NOTHING TO STOP THEM FROM COMING NORTH. It's about time for them to CLAMP DOWN and stop this Crap from continuing. That is what is wrong with this entire mess, MEXICO DID NOTHING TO THWART THE CARAVAN.
@retireleo @BreitbartNews @NancyPelosi Pelosi and her ilk will say what the voters want to hear, it doesn't mean that they will do what they said. But it is the way they keep getting re-elected. What irks me is that they use these highly political items and then don't follow through with that which they have said. https://t.co/qd6s5ZVh6O
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump He's a dirty cop all of the way back as the Whitey Bulger case. Then closer, we have Uranium One in which he delivered Uranium to the Russians, now he's been botching ut everything he's been dealing with. JAIL HIM
@dbongino I would like to think that they remember that they along with the then-Senator Obama voted for a BORDER WALL in 2006. But that was back in 2006, this is now, and everything that has happened and/or will happen isn't only a talking point. That doens't fix anything doing it does. https://t.co/vIyfcRGAyU
@bj_bjshaven If I were Mr. Mueller, I'd stop and think is there anything in my background that could cause me any problems? If there were I'd also think about a countersuit that would be forthcoming. His record goes back to Whitey Bulger, Uranium One, politicizing the FBI for Obama, Russia. https://t.co/vbKHSeWX6i
@freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump Along with his funding most of the MSM, he's been undermining our way of life with the left side of the news as being prominent By slanting what they say is NEWS, it is really commentary posing as news,. These companies have taken good people and destroyed their reputations. https://t.co/eDBaWc4NRC
@vickibazter @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @larryelder Starting with the State of California, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Now is the time to make life hard on them economically. Hit their law enforcement officials for going against regulations on illegals and arrest those who do not follow it.
@GovMikeHuckabee Best choice I've seen thus far, those on the left can be green with envy. But, they just might as well stay green it would be easier to spot them. The MSM needs to take a look at themselves to see just how cowardly they are. But what did I expect they have been paid for by Soros. https://t.co/OhroINzpQE
@charliekirk11 And the MSM won't say anything about other than disparaging mentions or comments.
@r98121261 As far as I know, the LA Sheriff could get his butt in a crack, [not cocaine] either. SCOTUS said illegals didn't have the SAME RIGHT AS CITIZENS. So his making them equal to the citizens is going against that. Time for him to go to jail, directly to jail, Do not pass Go.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, you haven't been played. You've been playing buying narcotics that came from Mexico, so why not make those who are selling it forfeit their wealth to build that wall. They are Mexican and Columbian citizens. Make them pay for it. Best thing to do is stop buying dope.
@TomFitton If the American people had known the truth that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other top administration officials knew that the Benghazi attack was an al-Qaeda terrorist attack from the get-go and yet lied and covered this fact up Mitt Romney might very well be president.
@TomFitton Now, who didn't figure out that Obama/Clinton would be involved in everything that was happening? Had the American people known what was happening in the background, I do not believe Obama would have had a 2nd term. But he's already created the havoc we have now.
@AnnaApp91838450 @BreitbartNews The Dems are saying what everyone wants to hear, but, they  DO NOT WANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH. A talking point isn't what the base needs to hear. She says what you want to hear and does nothing. It's all for getting re-elected. A Crock-o-Crap, she's FUBAR. https://t.co/1omSQLe5oB
@ChuckCallesto Especially since those 3 Dems and the rest voted for a border wall back in 2006. This includes the FRAUD IN CHIEF Obama. Awe, we aren't supposed to know and remember this little piece of history, right? We don't need talking points we need that wall those Dems voted for.
@Montel_Williams @realDonaldTrump I'll beg to differ with you there Montel, he didn't crash the stock market, what he did do was to live up to a promise to the American people on Border Security. You seem to have conveniently forgotten in 2006 the Dems voted for a wall. Or was that only a talking point.
@GregAbbott_TX The next question is: How many of them are illegals that you are counting? Considering the number of people determines how many Congress members the state gets. They need to be LEGAL citizens to be counted for members in Congress.
@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Somehow, I'm not surprised. He [Obama] made political tools out of places that shouldn't have been made so. He was behind everything that had and has happened to the Trump Administration. I would not put it past Mueller to working hand-in-glove, with Obama as well.
@ChuckCallesto But funding the wall with the proceeds taken from drug dealers [El-Chapo is one of them] could build it from the money that they got for selling their drugs in this country. Illgotten funds going to good. Now, this could be a better way of funding it then going through Congress.
@DreidMusicalX @MAGA35107119 @realDonaldTrump Now, you think of the Crusades where Western folks [Europeans and English because America didn't exist] tried and failed miserably to bring those infidels up to the period of mentality they were in of their time. Now, look at what the Muslims are doing to our countries. A CRUSADE
@hawes721 @MAGA35107119 @realDonaldTrump You need to re-read that statement for this poll.  My statement was in regards to this poll. I was also stating my differences of opinion on President Trumps decision to pull our troops out of Saudi Arabia, which I believe is premature and allowing the Russians to have their way.
@ChuckCallesto He wasn't a refugee, he was the Son of God, Born of a virgin who went with her husband to his city of origin to be taxed. That isn't a refugee. That is following a legal order by the authorities of that day. You, on the other hand, need to know the subject before speaking.
@MAGA35107119 @realDonaldTrump We all have differences of opinion., That doesn't solve the problem. But saying ISIS has been destroyed is most likely dead wrong. And what it is doing is giving the Russian's their way. Saudi's will able to do their destruction of opposition. https://t.co/aDVarkKydM
@LadyRedWave @BreitbartTexas This is why a WALL is needed. But EVERYONE   NEDS TO REMIND THE DEMOCRATS THAT THEY VOTED FOR A WALL IN 2006, and among them was Barack Obama. So they have no excuse for not FUNDING THE WALL NOW. IT ISN'T A TALKING POINT FOLKS as those DemocRATS would have you believe.
@kwilli1046 Back in '51, I got a trout using the only hook I had available and it wasn't a real fish hook either. But it was a safety pin, it wasn't that big, but it was a keeper at 12" long.
@ChuckCallesto You both voted for the WALL back in 2006? That was with another of your cronies one Barack Obama. Awe, I know about that one but the om=nly thing you want a wall for is a talking point as was it with the impoverished as well. Do anything, say anything for votes so you stay in DC.
@AmyMek How do I say liar to a person who is afraid to show her face? We have had leaders on both Continents who have studied the Quran and find things that she isn't saying.

I'd like to see the members of Congress who DO NOT DO THE PEOPLES WORK. not be paid for the entire month of DECEMBER AND JANUARY.

@PhilSanchez2020 We DO NOT LET HER OFF, her ineptitude killed an Ambassador in Benghazi ... she didn't care. She deleted 30K emails to avoid subpoenas. The Clinton Foundation took donations and only gave 7% to Charities, that's not a 901-C 3 organization. It's a money-laundering group. https://t.co/T2VAG33IgG
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What would you expect a Non-US Citizen to claim especially after he's been the President of the USA? Now, what would you expect of the DemocRATS to do since they are wanting "Open Borders"? Because this would make Obama an illegitimate President. They knew this and did nothing. https://t.co/uI4fyn7qpx
@JudicialWatch More food for you on the MENTAL DISORDER of Hillary Clinton as taken from Healthline Red. Read all 7 points and think how well it fits her actions. She doesn't want to take responsibility for anything done, her comment is "What difference does it make" or "It doesn't matter". https://t.co/1Mzaiw5396
@ChuckCallesto Comparing what he's done to what he's saying and they are two different things. Think about what I found on Healthline Red. The Synopsys of what was said is below. It portrays both Jim Comey very well. He's really a SICK man and needs to be hospitalized in an institution. https://t.co/fq3aZF5ZxJ
@ChuckCallesto It's time for him to go to jail and "Do Not Pass Go". He's not above the law he needs to get knocking at his door IMMEDIATELY! He isn't all he;'s cracked up to be. He's like the rest of us FLAWED, but the problem is he doesn't want to admit he is. He's like Hillary, a Sociopath. https://t.co/OjriLhHcnd
@wbmobile Had you used your God-Given brains for something that will never come about Your position might be a good one. But giving something away because it sounds good, doesn't cut the mustard. You and Bernie Sanders aren't totally with it. We don't want you to pick our pockets. https://t.co/ImDkEYLBtu
@trish_regan He knew and didn't care that his department even paid for this information as well.  His "it didn't matter" sound like Hillary Clinton or Benghazi. because it didn't matter. But his lame excuse idoesn't hold water, in that he's a liar from the get-go. https://t.co/504ze8IFug
@RealMAGASteve Reading their statement says nothing. But I'm of the firm belief that China is helping the Iranians break that nuclear ban using shell companies to get around the imposition put on Iran by the US Govt. I don't for the life of me believe that they have stopped doing anything yet. https://t.co/5Zr1c7jjMB
@bj_bjshaven @POTUS They can, but here's the rub, Soros is backing the DNC and most of the DemocRAT leaders as well. We need to remove his citizenship in this country because of his activities during WWII. He's no hero or savior as those Dems would have you believe. Remove his citizenship, he's lied https://t.co/lSjHaHarh6
@My2CentsXOGRIT A ban on Sharia Law is legislation which prohibits the application or implementation of Islamic law. Because of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, although the Constitution expressly forbids a religious test for would-be religious laws. A gotcha.
@My2CentsXOGRIT Since when did the Chinese become our friends when it was them alongside the North Koreans who fought us in the Korean War? They are proving it by dumping aluminum and steel on our shores. By putting asbestos into sheetrock. With friends like that, we don't need enemies.
@phil4gop @SenSchumer If Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi could pull their heads out of each other's asses they just might get some legal immigration security done, but backing folks who want to but in line and bypass the background are a no go.
@jhorak101 Might be a Republican, but he's a DemocRAT at heart if he's not into helping 1st responders and their dependents.
@TheLONEWOLFE3 They paid me close to a Rear Admiral to take US personnel to task, who were selling Govt. equipment to known Soviet agents. A naval Commander got 47-years in Leavenworth for his part in this treasonous act. That was my job, undercover.
@freedom_moates Ah, the corn Flake is so much into Hillary's pocket he sounds like a DemocRAT posing as a RepublICAN. The nation knows what a real flake he is. If he can't have it his way, he'll take his ball and go home. Jeff should start acting like an adult stop being a cry baby. https://t.co/ZGGuEjEE6a
@trish_regan @POTUS Trish lets go a step farther down the line and let him know if he hadn't let the FBI become a political tool of the Obama Admin. it would not have lost as much prestige as it has lost. His Friend Mueller is no Angel either as Head of FBI delivered Uranium to Russia for Hillary.
@ChuckCallesto I wonder how he'd like it to be unemployed? Without those White Team Owners, he'd be on the streets selling DOPE to our children. My friends in Blue would incarcerate as he would deserve. On the other hand, he could take some of that rage and put it to good use helping the needy.

@BrianKolfage @jimmykimmel @ABC @FoxNews @foxandfriends @MarkDice @RyanAFournier Unemployment would be helping this low-life. He needs to go into a soup line and find out how real people survive. As a retired disabled vet, he would not like me either. Because I ran a corp for 20 years closing it upon my 71st BD and retirement finally. I hold both BA and MA.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I said gut-less wonders on purpose in 2006 those DemocRATS voted for a border wall. Also, there are 65 countries who have made border walls since 9/11/01. Oops, there goes your cover, leaving you only a talking point which is all you wanted in the first place. We Want a WALL.
@Alyssa_Milano Alyssa, you don't know who is behind that go fund the wall project now, do you? Brian Kolfarge, Is a severely wounded veteran whom the Gary Sinise Foundation gave a house too. He's a motivational speaker and fellow vet. Suppose you look at something that will help this country.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Let's go a few steps deeper into the OBAMA CRAP. Include Uranium One, where the then Head of the FBI [Special Council Mueller] delivered Uranium to the Russians. Clinton.s email and then Obama's politizing our Federal Law Enforcement agencies. Using them at his whim for no good.
@RepMattGaetz Matt, keep reminding those DemocRATS that they voted for a border wall back in 2006. Let's not let them forget, they have a bad habit of saying one thing that will get them votes and then never doing anything about it. That WALL is not to be a TALKING POINT.
@SiddonsDan @FLOTUS @StephGrisham45 The left wants you to think she doesn't know what she's doing. Anything Trump, they are against no matter how much good it does. IT's a shame that the MSM hasn't taken a good look to see what she is doing for children and opioid abuse. Computer use against predators and minors.
.@realdonaldtrump, Stand strong on the wall! Without money for border security, shut down the government! #FundTheWall #BuildTheWall #ShutItDown The Dems voted for it in 2006 along with the then-Senator Barack Obama voted for it as well. Now, it's off of their table. Remind them.
@JeffGessy @realDonaldTrump You would like to think that the DemocRATS would or could remember back to 2006 when they voted for a border wall. That was when the then Senator Barack Obama voted for it as well. It's surprising what history teaches. The Dems used a border wall as a talking point it wasn't real
@Soy_Eleazar @JudicialWatch Ah, you forget George Soros is behind the New World Order and anything that is against any form of Democracy Venezuela, while it isn't is not totally over the hill because of it's failed government and the people are fed up with the way it was being run. REMOVE Soros CITIZENSHIP
@ISafeyet @SiddonsDan @deneenborelli Tell you what we really need to do, put Chuck Schumer along the border to guard it while those "immigrants" are throwing rocks at the border guards. The DemocRATS voted for a border wall and if they think the American people will forget they are sadly mistaken. https://t.co/9x6XdbZFkQ
@jasoninthehouse I do wish the DemocRATS could wrap their heads around this little bit of information.  There are 65 countries either building walls or which are already have them crossing into their country making the world's newest and most hastily built, wall. This has been since 2015,
@marklevinshow Most likely both, but let's not forget you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours mentality out of some jurists. Note I didn't say ALL Mark just some.
@LouDobbs We don't need to be supporting a despot who doesn't care about human rights. Allow killings anywhere in the world. We also do not need to be selling weapons to him or them since they were where most of the 9-11 terrorists came from. Oops, I wasn't supposed to remember that, was I

@Eddie_and_Patti @bbusa617 @ArizonaKayte @CudaDebbie @grizzlemeister @KatTheHammer1 @BlessPres45 @DanOHerrin Something to think about a charity is supposed to give the monies donated for the specific item away. But the Clinton Foundation only gave away 7% keeping the rest. That isn't a charity it's a money laundering enterprise. They are Frauds and need to be prosecuted and jailed.
@retireleo @2TomGilbert @RepBonnie @NJSenTurner @rethinkenergynj @ConserveNJ @HALTPennEast Since I was born in that state, I stay as far away from it as I can. I still remember Secaucus NJ and how it smelled even when driving through. It was or still is a pig/hog slaughtering capital of NJ.
@Eddie_and_Patti @bbusa617 @ArizonaKayte @CudaDebbie @grizzlemeister @KatTheHammer1 @BlessPres45 @DanOHerrin Now, to bring you up to today, the AG in NY mentioned that he'd seen his suicide note when going through paperwork for the Clinton Foundation. Now, do you expect anything to become of this direct threat, but by whom, and who wrote this since he had not.?  From: Scripps 2018
@Eddie_and_Patti @bbusa617 @ArizonaKayte @CudaDebbie @grizzlemeister @KatTheHammer1 @BlessPres45 @DanOHerrin Start with White Water and slide towards today, the both of them are criminals. The only thing with them they have not been imprisoned for the crimes that they and their cronies have committed. It's hard to hang killings on them when they use 3rd praties todo their dirty work. https://t.co/Po5lmfNQg3
@MichaelDCarlin As a Vet with 28-years, you better bet it does. But after hearing that FUBAR Special Council state that they had set Flynn up telling him he didn't need to have WH council present. Just remember his antics go back to the '80s, so it isn't a new thing.
@JudicialWatch That ought to be interesting since these members of Congress act like the law is for the rest of the people and not them, they are above it. Well hopefully someone with gonads will stand up to this POS and take him down. I would love to see him walking out wearing manacles.
@trish_regan @DougBurnsTHELAW So how long did it take you to figure that one out? Comey admitted lying to Congress. He hasn't been prosecuted for that yet, and I doubt it will ever be done. He's throwing a smoke screen up trying to mask his many faults. Don't forget that those FOIA requests were under him.
@JudicialWatch You can thank Obama for giving billions of our funds to Soros's associated groups. Obama hates this country as well and proved it by allowing thousands in without vetting any of them. This is what we get for not knowing what his true feeling are towards this country. https://t.co/tdfSAQAxkV
@tomselliott Better put it has everything to do with Comey since he was the FBI Head. Awe, he forgot that one and then he allowed the agency to be politicized. That was done before Trump became President. Now, he has a memory problem that could imprison him for life.
@bj_bjshaven @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @JudicialWatch @TheJusticeDept @Jim_Jordan @RudyGiuliani @JudgeJeanine @POTUSPress @DiamondandSilk @FoxNews Might be nice to see that this is done, but don't count on it because of Mueller's lack of candor and wanting to tell the truth on anything. He also lied to Congress during hearings. He's knee deep in Uranium One while he was the FBI Head. I know no one is supposed to remember it https://t.co/useirtiox4
@JoshuaMacias @vabelle2010 @realDonaldTrump I'd got for that, here's something to think on, Obama had approved Flynn calling the Russian from his office so he was aware of the call. Why hasn't Mueller even said anything about that? It doesn't fit his agenda to get a leg up on Trump. Mueller is a POS as well as FUBAR.
@realDonaldTrump But lying to Flynn is one thing. Special Counsel Mueller filing confirms Flynn was set up. Corrupt Andy McCabe admits he persuaded Flynn not to involve WH Counsel by warning that DOJ would then have to get involved. But in doing that they are showing how far they will go. https://t.co/xZ368EwTtw
@parscale @realDonaldTrump Problem with putting in folks whom you know, that after 1 - 2 years they are ready to stop doing the job want to quit. Their quitting is hassle enough if it wasn't from the other side making the opposition seem more important than they. You have to keep away from friends totally.
@JusProphet @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He's to put it in military jargon FUBAR. He's been doing it long enough, it's time for him to get his just rewards/ GITMO would be too kind for him. But one of my little houses would be better suited for him. For food give him a spoon and tell him to eat his way out. https://t.co/ONlQ9qmrHh
@JusProphet @realDonaldTrump @POTUS This really isn't surprising, he's been doing the same kind of thing since 4 innocent men were sent to prison [where 1 died and other 3 were released because of prosecutorial incompetence withholding evidence that fiasco cost the taxpayers $101M. Mueller is a "Sack-of-Sh-t".
@SocialClaude Castration is a just reward for someone who doesn't care what or whom he sodomizes. Heck losing his testicles made him a eunuch which is very rare in Western Society.
@SarahPalinUSA I shall go a step farther, her Clinton Foundation ship CHELSEA was raided in Baltimore. She and they have the gall to try and weasel out of their wrongdoing. The entire story is below with the byline about where I got it from. They need to close them down and JAIL THEM. https://t.co/Y9rkLTjJvf
@SarahPalinUSA Then it ought to be convenient to send her and her cronies to prison as would happen to any of the rest of us had we done what she did. But that wasn't all she did, she lied about Benghazi and 4 brave Americans that she allowed to die without proper protection for the Embassy.
@r98121261 @RebekahWorsham Not really, he was doing that back in the early '80s when he prosecuted 4 innocent men for a murder they didn't do. It took a persistent judge to find the truth had been withheld from the defendants. He's a DIRTBAG and, doesn't do anything legally. If that gives you a hint.
@TrumpDailyNewss What gives Mueller the right to deliberately lie to a person and tell him not to have a lawyer nearby? McCabe changed the 302's on everything to enhance the need for a Special Council. All those involved need to see the inside of a prison cell for the rest of their natural lives.

If you think he's changed his stripes, you are dead wrong. He's still pushing left-leaning ideas. He's out of step with society, we want border security.
@My2CentsGritXO @TuckerCarlson @WayneDupreeShow What you aren't seeing is that these people don't want to be citizens and assimilate into our society. They want to send funds home to their own countries and their in-laws who are still there. Think man, use your God-given brains for something other than a hat rack.
@My2CentsGritXO @TuckerCarlson @WayneDupreeShow Do understand Tucker Carlson is and always has been on the left of this subject. He doesn't seem to care that these people are trying to break in ahead of everyone who has done it the right way. Your open border crap doesn't hold water, Tucker. Go talk to the EU who are inundated
@rsultzba He has dual citizenship ours and another. We need to remove him and his ilk. They prey of the downtrodden and impoverished, then hire others to do the hitting. He readily admitted it. He hates America and all it stands for. I'd say the feelings roughly the same maybe a stint here https://t.co/dMVGpLgu9w
@My2CentsGritXO @en_volve Mueller's a dirty cop. Why would he say: "the circumstances of the interview do not present mitigating considerations"? Since he already knew: "that the Deputy Asst AG told Flynn he didn't need counsel to be there." That my dear sir is entrapment, the call was in Obama's office.
@WebsitesByNancy @SaraCarterDC I have a problem: hile the circumstances of the interview do not present mitigating considerations. Here's why: So you are admitting that you knew that the Deputy Asst AG told Flynn he didn't need counsel to be there. That my dear sir is entrapment, the call was in Obamas office
@seanhannity Mueller looks like he's been caught with his hands in the cookie jar, dreaming up an excuse as to why the judge shouldn't see those documents. So you are admitting that you knew that the Deputy Asst AG told Flynn he didn't need counsel to be there. That my dear sir is entrapment.
@Etm114E @RealBasedMAGA Since that is the case, it also shows how badly educated they really were. That puts the blame on the New York State Educators Assn. and the NEA for not making sure our people are getting the best education they can get, instead of just barely getting any. Think people, right.
@My2CentsGritXO @realDonaldTrump The story of MSM's news or should I say commentary, since they don't give both sides of the story for the readers to make up their own minds. Seems that when Obama did it they didn't say anything,, but if @POTUS did it this was terrible. A dual standard of telling the news. https://t.co/VIe9eURUzb
@RealMAGASteve Comey is a Sack-of-Sh-t, a liar in that he lied to Congress and admitted it. He couldn't remember anything when testifying before them, but he could for the book. Start looking farther back in his history and you'll find other crap he pulled as well. His career is FUBAR.
@My2CentsGritXO @TGowdySC @realDonaldTrump @100PercFEDUP @TheUnitedFree @starcrosswolf @DanCovfefe1 @Rampage95_ @BrentPayne59 @RedPillBlackMan @bbusa617 @ChristusPatriot @DonnaWR8 @RealMAGASteve Might have helped if those DemocRATS were on the same page instead of being objectionists on everything that was being done. Understand the house is divided into 2 sides Republicans and DemocRATS who don't always agree with each other. Without some unanimity, nothing gets done.
@SarahPalinUSA Good, then start turning them around and back to their country of origin. Let Mr. Soros try and figure out another way to breach the border. As for him, the US ought to revoke his citizenship from America since he wants to destroy this country and the people within it. https://t.co/na1BUU4ZV0
@SarahPalinUSA About time someone took them to task. They pretend to be reporting news but by laying innuendo and misstatements they are rumor spreaders and not news what-so-ever.  They tend to think that their one-sided stories are the whole thing/ Well guess what, you've been called out on it
@SiddonsDan @MillerStream Dream on. This is a George Sorors movement that he's been paying for. His statement that "He hates America and everyone who lives in this country. He controls MSM by only giving one side of the sdtory, rather than the entire story. Sounds like ABC; CBS; NBC; CNN; MSNBC aka MSM https://t.co/HMi2H9Jfrh
This is for those of you who struggle with singing Christmas Carols https://t.co/BilqkuDVvq
@rnsr4u @JennyHatch @YouTube Hopefully, they do and my finding that the Foundation couldn't be a charitable organization only giving 6% to charities. They are more than likely a money laundering agency, rather than a charity. If so then my two outhouses are perfect for them. https://t.co/MAaveE7Ar8
@realDonaldTrump So you are planning on removing Vietnamese who helped us at gr8 peril to themselves and their families. This oos DEAD WRONG. Remove those who have committed crimes, not those who are helping our economy. Your tantrum like a three-year-old wasn't Presidential.
@ChuckCallesto Consider who she works for and then why they would allow that kind of conduct to be shown on the air.  Also, there are still some of us who can read lips, so they have lost that infringement as well. If they had any morals what-so-ever, they would terminate her. But not FAKE NEWS
@RepAlGreen  Be very careful about what you are wishing for, else someone does a DEEP INSPECTION OF YOUR LIFE. Seems like The Pot Calling the Kettle Black, there big boy. You just happen to be younger than I am kid. And I haven't had any extramarital affairs ever I'm not married.
@SarahPalinUSA A charity gives away more than the 6% that the Clinton Foundation did. They were more like a money laundering service than a charity. They both deserve to be imprisoned instead of running around loose to prey on others.
@graca5683 @trish_regan @RepMattGaetz Navy 7/3/63 through 12/18/75 Aboard USNS GITMO Army 1/14/76 through 2/3/86 After having been out of service I was recalled Navy 7/16/94 through 2/7/01 total was 28-years. 10-years local Police Department. I enjoyed my military service years. Dad was Army/AirCorps WWII.
@graca5683 @trish_regan @RepMattGaetz In all ways, I've grown to dislike pastors who say to use their tablets to understand what he's preaching on, rather than just doing it the right way using words to paint the picture. Now if that sounds like a theologian speaking you'd be halfway there. Military service called.
@trish_regan @RepMattGaetz It seems to me that before the "Computer Age" took over everyone's lives we were better off. The downside to that is that we got more junk mail in our mailboxes. We didn't have someone pushing their agenda down our throats as we do now. Let us use our God-given brains.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted, as much as I disagree with your comments most of the time, I was listening to him today and he sounded like a three-year-old throwing a temper tantrum. But as I recall in 2006 Democrats and Republicans voted for a wall wholeheartedly. It's a shame you don't do that again.
@3PeopleLikeThis @Jali_Cat @JerryNadler @HouseDemocrats @CNN @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump It shouldn't have to be mentioned once, but these left-leaning people who all happen to be democRATS. Right-minded [those who believe the law is for all] folks, should be screaming their heads off. about law enforcement not doing its job. Oh, that hanging isn't a good idea. https://t.co/LpwBA4llPT
@jhorak101 @weatherflow Yeah, I did, but I don't know why I'd need a wind meter.  Went to the website found a buy 1 get one $39.99. I did not spend the $$$, it would have been a waste of money.
@A3Patriot Leftists, Socialists, Radicals, Antifa, Reps. Waters and Schiff. And I'm not above saving Pelosi in that mix either. After all, she had a Chinese Spy working for her for years. She doesn't vet (security screen) her employees. What a FUBAR bunch of crap that was.
RT @ISafeyet: @RealSaavedra @TIME Terrible list, @TIME.  Separated families (Illegal aliens, I.e. criminals) instead of border patrol agent…
@BogartPete Way to go. It's about time someone had the guts to stand up to the stupidity coming out of the UN. Start looking at the things they are backing for all of the wrong reasons. To push for to allow another culture it is dead wrong. The Muslims one goal it to take over the world. https://t.co/258o0U6xQF
@babysgramma @theIpatriot Ah, that people would wake up to see what is happening right under their noses. During the Crusades, the people from Europe invaded the Muslim world and found out that they could not beat them. Now the other shoe has fallen, it's the Muslims coming to our shores to take us over. https://t.co/9QUSUQZspA
@TeapotTuring  Your comment about bio wasn't directed at me so this ought to blow your mind. I volunteered for the Navy in June '63 holding a BA in Theology. Eyes weren't 20-20 so that cut out OCS, it didn't WO though. 11.5 years GITMO, 10 years ARMY, recalled Navy 6.5 years = 28
@ISafeyet @TomFitton So why isn't Comey in PRISON where he really should be? He's made fools out of Congress, got away with it. But had anyone else done the same thing you'd have thrown us in JAIL and thrown away the key. This is not the way it ought to work folks. He's no better than anyone else.
@ChuckCallesto Now if they expected him to give away the barn, you got what you wanted you were kidding. Had he gotten the spotlight where everyone could hear him he'd have done the exact same thing. What you gave him was the opportunity of making fools out of the Congress. He lied to you.
@SarahPalinUSA Sounds like they don't mind those who kneel., But don't want them to show that they'll put their money where their mouths are. You have a problem seeing that which is right. Hey Commissioner, you shouldn't fine him you ought to support him for doing what you were afraid of doing.

Just cause Obama did it doesn't make it legal either. And those DemocRATS are praying that "We the People" won't recognize another TAX for this service. Just remember the DNC is FLAT BROKE CAUSE OF HRC Campaign. https://t.co/c68j2B4SYr
@chazermann26 He didn't do the direct hiring and those who did didn't both to find out if she was legal or not. WHiolle the media might like to rub Trump's face in false papers he or whoever is in charge of his golf clubs. But he's not the hiring agency they are the ones you go after.
@ISafeyet @AriFleischer @maggie805ca Could it be that the MSM has been found called out for exactly what it is, an arm of the DemocRAT machine? Strictly working for the left on everything against the sitting @POTUS.  But there are those of us who know that real reporters backcheck their sources. Not Lemmings. https://t.co/3NF7M2EOrc
@trish_regan @nedryun Ah, then what is the FBI  and DOJ looking into the Clinton Foundation as hard as they have been? Could it be that the FOIA request has sparked an honest investigation into their activities? They can't be a charity by only giving away 6% of the donations. A fraud is what we have.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera I'm glad someone else has seen through this farcical clown. He has no business prosecuting anyone, he himself needs to be prosecuted. Look deeply into his law enforcement and prosecutorial history. He's involved in Russian collusion himself and Uranium One. He weaponized the FBI. https://t.co/wCB8fp5cAC
@r98121261 @freedom_moates @indiesentinel Well look at her contorted smile and then that jack-ass, they match. Might have found her twin, and I know it wouldn't spend money unnecessarily. It works for oats and grains. A cost saver in the long run.
@UberDick @PatriotJenn @wvufanagent99a @ImabitcSumtimes @paulajarvis69 @TheBeaSmith @TheTestyTarheel @Real_PeachyKeen @Real_Gaz @BondHedden About time a DemocRAT came out with that statement. She also ought to find out exactly what she knows before allowing her onto any committee. Unless they have one on dumbasses.
@r98121261 @freedom_moates @indiesentinel I'll go along with you. She promised them something that she can't ever give them and they fell for it.  I did notice that BU hasn't put her grade point up or how high/low she was. For a Degree in Economics, how is it that she doesn't know anything about finance? Knumbskull!! https://t.co/J7w7nzQoIW
@r98121261 @KamVTV @MarvLBluechip They have been looking for help from the Federal Government. But if the Feds are thinking they take over the doling out of the funds making sure they are not going to those individuals who aren't here legally. Time to put a stop to that crap.
@bbusa617 After the piece in ZeroHedge, they might be looking for someplace to hide their illegal activities. Only giving 6% of donations to their foundation doesn't qualify them as a CHARITY either. I have 2 nice rooms for them, a little bit smelly but they'll fit in quite well. https://t.co/9SoFyKPR9J
@realDonaldTrump My question to you is how can you trust a person who has lied to Congress twice, as well as to you. He should have gone to jail for either of those wrongs, but no, he's free to spread more lies. Rosenstein and wife have been conflicted from the start, owes Mueller for their jobs. https://t.co/GwxfAzVCse
@jeepsuzih2 He's almost as bad as ALL GORE with his private jets. Makes me think he's really not doing what he preaches. So his agenda is to ruin our capabilities. Oh, and when Al Gore found out that we'd found out how big his footprint was he started going commercial. He slipped backwards.
Right. She's not the brightest tack in the box either. Her elevator doesn't stop on all floors. She's one brick short of a full load. Almost a sad sack, but I believe the sack is better off. https://t.co/YvK0S23g9A
@JudicialWatch Seems that Mr. Obama ought to be looking over his shoulders because of his callus and illegal use our law enforcement agencies. As for Mr. Mueller has done enough damage and needs to be arrested for his misdoings. He's not above the law either. They LIE and CHEAT, they're caught.
@DrSprankle Are you sure that this isn't the real Grinch? I see lots of coal coming out of his gab. https://t.co/qz8d0uLsPZ
@IWasHrren Aw heck, you expect her to be honest, really? Even the ICIG found an “anomaly on Hillary Clinton’s emails going through their private server when they had done the forensic analysis, they found that her emails, every single one except four, over 30,000, not on the distrib. list,”
@TheMarkPantano Couldn't happen to a more deserving person. It's about time someone helped him into the right direction, now if he'll pay his taxes, he'd be better off. As would the Treasury. He, on the other hand, would be a little bit poorer.
@ISafeyet @TomFitton While you are at it add Uranium One to it and take down Robert Mueller as well. Since he's deep;y involved and delivered the Uranium to Russian hands. Now talk about Russian Collusion. You have it in Spades. Obama, Clinton, Mueller, Comey, McCabe, and Rosenstein together. https://t.co/rrTMqGKbgy
@retireleo That's all well and good but she doesn't know the difference between a Honda Civic and Civics for high school students. Doesn't understand basic economics, nor anything to do with the economy. I've noticed BU doesn't post her grade point either.  So what are they hiding?
@JudicialWatch Are you sure that it doesn't take this is an well, Tom?  She was in-sighting others to do wrong which is part of 18 US Code 2383. The penalties for breaching this one are stiff and she deserves them all. https://t.co/4NvmMNUT6y
@dbongino It might have helped if she'd read it rather than listen to others to get a synopsis of the book. I'll not comment on it because I speed read it once and then reread it again to get the things I might have missed. I've been clocked at over 1-K WPM with 80% comprehension.
@SenFeinstein Dianne, you should have been just as outraged when Hiollary Clinton did notihing to help Ambassador Stevens and 4 others in Benghazi. Where was you outrage on that fiasco these were American citizens?
@Mrs_Malindo @TwitchyTeam @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Please do..  But with a DemocRAT House do it before January.
@Etm114E @RealBasedMAGA All the more reason for New Yorkers to recall this ill-informed lady, who doesn't even know Civics is a class for high school students. Calling Civics a Honda car the Civic shows everyone who voted for her just how dumb she is. But, she is like the rest TAX and SPEND to Oblivion. https://t.co/afQQQbkRs8
@CBSNews Your info on FaceBook about our data is disturbing, to say the least. But if you are an avid FaceBook user only use their so-called-browser of their pages and nowhere else. DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO TRACK YOUR MOVEMENTS. That cuts them off from where you go on the net.

@ChuckCallesto Well let's take their claim a step farther, the California students who are saying that "VeggieTalel" is "Racist" and "Dangerous" for children are themselves dangerous to all people who do not think like them.

@ISafeyet @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump With Mueller don't trust anything that you are thinking. He's also the biggest leaker on the SC panel if it suits his means.

@ISafeyet @dbongino McCabe was changing the 302's so that they could go after these people. The originals were shredded so you are stuck with the bad one.

@sxdoc If it is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, then she ought to be removed from the government and her deal so-to-speak trashed.

@jhorak101 You too huh? Fort Walton Beach's was tonight as well. A traffic nightmare that happens on the first Monday of December.
@dbongino Mueller's "pitbull" Weissmann officially reprimanded by a judge in the Eastern District of New York for withholding evidence,  ‘egregious’ actions withheld exculpatory evidence. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan filed “an order directing Mueller to provide Flynn with all evidence.
@My2CentsGritXO @BreitbartNews That judge had better rethink what the law says, and not try making law. Now, the judge has dug a hole and is going to find out how deep it is going to go. The problem is Judges don't make law, they uphold it even if they disagree with the way it was written. Wake up, do your job https://t.co/79fDc8wJva

@ChuckCallesto This is a by-product of the LEFT-LEANING MSM. They are still living in a delusional realm and think that when they wake up the dream will go away. But she deserves a wake-up call from the Secret Service for her threat.
@WEARAllenStrum To quote Lawrence Welk, "wunnerful wunnerful". Yup, I'm old enough to remember him. But let's go back slightly further Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob back in the '50s. The TV's were small Black and White sets, yeah, no color. Since I've been down here it has snowed 9 times in 64 yrs
@lorenzabraham12 I see cheese, bacon, tomato,, onion, and lettuce where's the steak?
@ericswalwell But remember that those who are colluding with Mueller can also be composing [Saying things that sound right, but in actuality aren't even close to the truth. This is composing.] Mr. Cohen is no JS Bach nor is he a good liar let alone one at telling the truth. https://t.co/72PwkrMgoM
@realDonaldTrump  If the Democrats launch probes into his administration, he will declassify documents exposing that the Obama Justice Department, FBI, and the Hillary Clinton campaign worked together to set him up. 	Don't threaten them JUST DO IT, time to watch them scramble.
@trish_regan Are you familiar with Mueller's cooperating witness is sitting there composing? Meaning he's making up stuff that sounds right but really isn't. Cohen is trying to do as much as he can to imply something wrong was done. Now prove it. The cop in me says he's a liar. He' no JS Bach https://t.co/xZ3LPUDHvO
@DonaldJTrumpJr Something to remember Mueller is giving his cooperating witness a chance to compose [makeup stuff that sounds right even if it isn't]. Keep that in mind, when you hear crap coming out of his mouth. Cohen trying to become another JS Bach, only he's not close. https://t.co/K52rmZjZ0s
@WEARAllenStrum @WEARKDaniel Just a little bit damp there Alan. Same with Okaloosa County. I got smart and didn't go out yet Although I was out before the rain hit the area and dropped my flag to 1/2 staff in memory of President Bush our 41st. President. It'll be up 24/7/365 and it is lit at night.
House Progressive leader Pramila Jayapal will join a "caravan". She's incensed that Trump had tear gas at them. Now she's talking with a forked tongue because Obama did it from 2013-16. Where is the medias rebuke? It's not there, but it is when Trump followed Obama's lead. Oops.
@WSJ Can't forget him or his son, who granted me a new Security Clearance which creates a whole new headache. It is also why I do not go out of Florida
@ISafeyet @TomFitton @GeorgePapa1 @jerome_corsi @realDonaldTrump Ah, someone either didn't know or hadn't checked Mrs. Rosenstein further, She's a CIA operative was gr8 at blocking FOIA requests. They are both tied to Mueller in that they owe him, as he's the one who hired them. Mueller mixed in with Uranium One. So he's also tied to Clinton https://t.co/NyFDRsGuSV
@ISafeyet @mitchellvii Just think we can add Pelosi for dropping Classified documents on the floor, then claiming she was sick. Schiff for falsely claiming evidence and never showing any. Comey, Brennan, and Clapper for lying to Congress. What a bunch of RATS, and Traitors. https://t.co/PhpCYPL8MS
@A3Patriot Take her out on the Aleutian Islands and leave her there with her short on. tell her is she looks South she could see Japan. She is only proving her education is lacking and she's going to be a disaster for her district. I still have yet to see what her grade point was at BU.
@Boyd_2650 A big problem I see with same-day voter registration is that the person could be registered in one area and claim to live in another. What is tool keep them from voting twice?

@My2CentsGritXO @realDonaldTrump @MikeCiandella @theblaze That might wake the head shed up, but I doubt it. Understand they have an agreement with the Federal Government to keep the plant open into 2019. Seems that they don't want to keep their word, so let them suffer the consequences of their corporate decision.
@benshapiro Something tells me that BU ought to look into Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's degree to see if she really was entitled, graduate. She has proved she hasn't learned anything, by coming out with the stuff she has said. When I asked a question about her standing, I got nothing.
@drscott_atlanta @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump So let me ask an easy question. Where was the indignation from the MSM while Obama was doing the exact same thing as Trump has done? I know it's a dual standard, they don't care when Obama did it but do when Trump does it. That should not be way things get done by either side.
@RedNationRising Seems Clapper and Brennan went one strike too far with this skulduggery. It's something that the CIA isn't supposed to do inside the US. Now the DNI has no business spying on SCOTUS since it rules only on laws inside this country, so they were in the wrong as well. Jail them now. https://t.co/ZpTrlwgnpQ
@ChuckCallesto Aw Gee, where was the indignation from the Dems when Obamas people did a monthly tear gas spraying at the borders. Customs and Border Protection agents used tear gas 1.3 times per month on average between 2012 and 2016, the final five years of Barack Obama's tenure as president. https://t.co/VIJjRNmBta
@bbusa617 Idiocy and Stupidity coming from the CA DemocRAT. She'll need to wait till her side is in charge of the Executive Department of the Govt., but until then she'll have to live with what President Trump has set up. Does she remember that Obama used Pepper balls on migrants?
@ISafeyet @dbongino It's borderline treason. CIA director John Brennan personally green-lit the 9/11 hijackers entry into the US. Clapper gained a reputation among liberals as a liar for covering up the existence of secret data-collection programs. Want more or is that enough to get you started?
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan Don't leave it up to the DemocRATS, that caravan is only a talking point to get their base all riled up. It worked in this election, so don't give them the opportunity of stopping that wall. Lou when was the last time a DemocRAT lived up to what they promised? Think long and hard
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC Now, why would a British newspaper that leans to the left be, really? And do you really think you can trust anything that they are saying, knowing that they are against everything President Trump has done? I think that they are trying their best to make trouble for Trump's allies
@RyznykStefan Look what CA did when the gave drivers licenses and said when they renew them they will get a voter registration card. They don't care if they are legal or not. This is how you steal votes folks.
@ziama_kristin @realDonaldTrump Now you explain why folks in that caravan said that they were going to storm the gate. They also mentioned that there was going to be some violence. They said that they didn't want anything to do with that crap. Seems that you want open borders, become a member of the EU then.
@ChuckCallesto CNN is BLIND because 3 other networks showed them throwing rocks. What ICE people didn't do was to shoot guns. No, they threw tear gas canisters. Please, understand CNN WANTS OPEN BORDERS, they don't care about U.S. CITIZENS. They don't want to tell the truth. Ever wonder why.
@Thomas1774Paine To quote Mr. Dershowitz The special prosecutor Robert Mueller is subjecting Trump to “the legal equivalent of a colonoscopy.” “If you look objectively at what he’s doing, he’s applying neutral civil liberties principles to Trump, as he would to anyone else.”
@realDonaldTrump The folks in Mississippi might get mad at me if I went from my home in Florida and voted in Mississippi. Also, it isn't legal for me to do that. I helped remove Bill Nelson from his seat.
@ScottFlansburg Now try adding a bank deposit ticket with over 50 entries, upside-down. while a friend was doing it on his calculator. I had the answer to his bank deposit a full 10-minutes before he did. When I said I had the answer, he wanted me to tell him which I did not do.
@WEARAllenStrum @weartv I don't mind temperatures in the '30s as long as they are in a meat freezer, but for going outside it's for the birds. My exotic birds won't be going outside, because they like a lot warmer. 12 Cockatiels and 2 Quaker Parrots, and 3 female cats a Calico, Black Bob-tali, 1 w/tail
@trish_regan Ocasio-Cortez flunked. On PBS last week, she asserted that "unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs." Moreover, the erudite B.A. holder in economics posited, "unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their kids." https://t.co/zK2MEjKt5c
@darsavmo They lost their way when JFK was killed, and have gone downhill ever since. They used to work across the aisle, but not now. Since they aren't in power, they only want to become obstructionists. I'm NOT FOR OPEN BORDERS, I AM FOR THE CONGRESS PUTTING THE $2.6 T. BACK INTO SS. https://t.co/bnkTpVTQVt
@freedom_moates Jim Acosta has shown his TRUE COLORS, he's part of the ANTI-TRUMP DEEP STATE CRAP THAT REFUSE TO TELL YOU THE REAL TRUTH. President Trump was right in removing Acostas press credentials. CNN has been leaning to the left ever since Obama left office after they are backed by Soros. https://t.co/itPTDEfcZ6
@BreakingNews @Reuters Someone on your staff doesn't know proper Grammar. Unarmed is fine, but unshoed isn't. it should have been unshod [barefoot, barefooted, shoeless, unshod]. Aw, gee better learn English grammar first or have another check its validity before publishing it.
@ChuckCallesto Aw, let's see she wants them in her house, right? Wrong, and she's dead wrong on open borders. No individual country with the exception of the EU allows open cross-border travel for its citizens. Note I did not say illegals. Which was what was happening on our southern border.
@ChuckCallesto I know around 100 single women who picked Trump because to put it as they said it, "They could not Trust Hillary Clinton to do anything she said she'd do" They also mentioned Benghazi her lack of truth, then her private email server. Said if they did that, they would be in jail.
@RedNationRising The  DemocRATS were all for a wall during Obamas Admin but did nothing about it. Now they are against it. Do understand "a wall" is a talking point and that is all it is.

@ISafeyet @mitchellvii @AquariusRising2 I have a feeling that he's extending his investigation until the statute of limitation runs out on Uranium One.

@HarryMazza @marklevinshow Yup and nothing became of it because the media got sidetracked on 9/11/01 and then nothing else was heard about the death.
@NavalInfantry @dbongino @weneedtotalk So why hasn't he been arrested and jailed for his criminal behavior? His lead attorneys has an ethics problem.

@LizCrokin From NYP: "Assange hinted prior to the election that the Russians weren’t the source of all the Democratic Party e-mails he published.

@bbusa617 Remember the state was giving illegal aliens have a drivers license and upon renewal, they were filling in voter registration cards. Now think illegals getting a voter card in CA because of Gov. Brown. This is how the DemocRATS steal elections. Similar to the FRAUD caught in GA. https://t.co/wZOiMClpba
@Condor_Law Let's put them all in that judges chambers and let him deal with his new problem. Now if he lets them go from his office, have ICE detain them and deport them back to their home country. They will be out of this country and that judge will have no leg to stand on. He keeps them.
@dbongino By getting your social media insights, law enforcement can see if you are mentally unbalanced. They can also see which side you are leaning towards.

@RealJamesWoods @GarySinise Rather than kids looking up to sports characters who aren't the gr8est roll models to mimic, Mr. Sinise or MOH awardees should be looked up to.

@IWasHrren @jerome_corsi @YouTube Well, if you stop and think, you can see it in the DemocRAT Party. That is because of the Socialists running under the DemocRAT flag. Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, now thankfully O'Rourke and Gillum didn't get in. All DemocRATS. Awe, there you go.
@Thomas1774Paine Historical or was that hypocritical exhibit?
@kwilli1046 That would be a boon to someone who's arms aren't paralyzed. Makes good sense, provided it has a reasonable cost.

@krassenstein That "Opposition Research" piece gotten by Hillary Clinton's Campaign was gotten to put dirt on Trumps Campaign. But it is illegal to get foreign persons to do it. That Crap was supposedly paid for from Russians and NOT VERIFIED used by the FBI in 4 FOIA requests. Clinton Guilty https://t.co/1Uc0SIAN13
@krassenstein 5 9th Circuit has gone against Trump consistently 2 appointed by Bush and 1 by Clinton. All 3 liberal. 	Taking the majority of votes don't count when you need 270 Electoral College votes. Better learn what is needed to win the election for President.
@krassenstein 1. MSM backed by George Soros America Hater. 2 Only after them when they have broken the law [hillary's private email, server]. 3. Got 302 Electoral College votes needed 270 votes. 4. Not necessarily true, on journalists, Mexico, Central America journalists are killed.
@ChuckCallesto It's not an impeachable event no matter how much you are upset that @realDonaldTrumpwon the election. Why don't you do something useful for a change? Like putting your head into a toilet and flushing it. The only good with that is your head will be all wet. Cleaned up thoughts.
@SandraPicard13 @Thomas1774Paine Problem is that they are also getting illegals voter registration cards and allowing them an undeserved vote. They want open borders. It's the only way they tend to think that they can steal an election since the colored folks are seeing the light they are not talking points.
@Thomas1774Paine Throw the book at the perpetrators of this crap. I guess that they weren't expecting to be caught doing it. But they should have thought out the repercussions of cheating, by buying those who are in dire straights in the first place. But the only picture I have is from GA. https://t.co/XyTBTCq5Wy
@realDonaldTru_m I want you to think on something, you abolish the Supreme Court, and now you have to put up with those leftist judges that Obama put into place. Needless to say, there are 3 branches of Government, not 2. You weren't elected King  or Supreme Being, so leave them in place. https://t.co/U3OQ3bvWxO
@TreyGibbs28 @realDonaldTrump Hold on thar, That was exact;y what Obama did with the FBI/CIA/DOJ. He weaponized them as a branch of the Executive Branch of the government. Rather than an independent branch as it was originally set out to be. Those who allowed it ought to be jailed, starting at the TOP. https://t.co/T1bnPFZ2pk
@DerrickKershner I'd love to but try living on $755.00 per month and pay all of your expenses and have something left at the end of the month to do anything else with. I'm lucky if I have $50.00 left.
@DeplorableVote1 @JesusOfTheJMan @DonnaWR8 I'm glad you've seen the light. I'd been saying that for ages, understanding the DemocRATS would say one thing and then do the exact opposite of what they had promised. Understand, I'm almost 3/4 century old so I've seen what they were doing. But I also volunteered military '63.
@ChuckCallesto It's a shame they don't allow castration any more. It would serve him right, or do the Middle Eastern thing of making a Eunuch [ Castration included removal of the penis as well as the testicles.] out of him.
@RedNationRising A ban on sharia law is legislation which prohibits the application or implementation of Islamic law (sharia) in courts in any civil (non-religious) , or passed some kind of ballot measure that "prohibits the state's courts from considering foreign, international or religious law"

@GOPPollAnalyst @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @Acosta @Carpedonktum I have NEWS for you, it's the White House that grants press passes and they can rescind them at will. The 1st Amendment has nothing to do with that. The Press-pass is a privilege granted to the holder, but it isn't a right to become a bully. When that is done a penalty comes.
@marklevinshow Mark, while he was a member of Congress, there was a death in his NW FL office under questionable circumstances. I lived in the area when that occurred. The excuse was lame, to say the least. But local officials tried sweeping it under the rug. It doesn't wash.
@realDonaldTru_m Do that and our allies there can't or won't help us. We will become a Parhia, I don't believe that's what you are thinking of. But what you can do is to not overpay our dues to the organization. Force the rest of those countries to pay their fair share. Outcast. https://t.co/kMVmDU8Qmb

@My2CentsGritXO @realDonaldTrump @100PercFEDUP I believe we should look deeply into your military activities and then those that made you become a puppet for the other side. You DON'T DESERVE TO BE CALLED ADMIRAL either. You want FED UP, I'm tired of military leaders who are afraid of taking responsibility for their actions.
@My2CentsGritXO @realDonaldTrump @100PercFEDUP You, Mr. McRaven, have no right to speak for Americans in general. The facts have shown that Mr. Brennan is a bad actor. To defend him as you have makes us wonder if you are possibly posturing for something significant? Do the honorable thing and turn in your security clearance.

@homerobento Her time is up, is correct. But Also remember that she would have removed our legal guns voiding the 2nd Amendment. She is a One World Order freak, socialist and follower of Alinsky as is Obama. Oops, you didn't know about that one huh. Everything she'd done would have been gone.

@A3Patriot Well, Tom Fitton is asking for a federal investigation into Adam Schiff for FOIA paperwork holdups. He's not alone there is another involved as well.
@sxdoc @realDonaldTrump Problem is that "We the People" didn't know where he really stood as far as his politics. We found out, but at that point, it was too late.

@TheLastRefuge2 No, it is the complacency of those who don't seem to understand that state laws on voting include them and they need to be held responsible for their gross negligence. They knew at the last election their machines didn't work right but they didn't care. I'll say that to anyone.
@KMGGaryde @sxdoc She graduated BU with a BA in Arts and Sciences 2011.

@TomFitton No kidding, what she did was to ignore the law. At that point, she needed to be arrested, but not by the Broward County Sheriff because he allowed a murderer to register to vote. That isn't legal and he should have known that, but I feel he doesn't care. Arrest both of them.
@ChuckCallesto Think, he's only going after Trump because he saw through their upholding the DemocRAT agenda. Spreading false accusations and inaccurate BIASED NEWS, ALL leaning to the left. Understand most of the Major MSM are getting a stipend from George Soros. SCHIFF IS AN IDIOT. https://t.co/Hg3YxvKwj4
@marcorubio Since she's admitted in breaking the law, why hasn't she been arrested and jailed? Oh, yeah, she's in Broward County where the Sheriff there allowed a murderer to register to vote. He knows felons who have committed murder aren't allowed to vote by State Law. He's past time to go
@Thomas1774Paine Time to arrest Broward Sheriff, Dr. Snipes, and anyone who wants to thwart the law. The Sheriff ought to know a murder isn't allowed to vote EVER as part of the law. He's not really a Sheriff but a fool/clown, is more like it Take away the expensive car, a bicycle is his speed. https://t.co/MfRTRg4MBs

@My2CentsGritXO @SenatorCardin @POTUS Understand DACA could have been solved during Obama's term, but the DemocRATS wanted a talking point, not to solve the problem. I do not know of any group of people who just want to be talking points if they do they are STUPID. Rosenstein / Uranium One / Clinton he's tied to it.
@ISafeyet @almostjingo @LucyChoosey While we are all immigrants we did it LEGALLY. Not the way this caravan is wanting to do it. I fought so that you could speak your peace, that doesn't give you the right to let people in unlawfully.  My 28-yrs of military service showed me how people are treated.
@ScottforFlorida Now, what did you expect Dr. Snipes to do, she's a died in the wool DemocRAT [spelled correctly]. She's trying everything she can top make ballots so you'll lose this election. As an FL Notary 7th term, it stinks to high heaven with what they are pulling. SEAL HER OFFICE NO ENTRY https://t.co/AkwuTyPdGx
@marcorubio As a Notary for the State of Florida 7th term, there is no excuse for Broward and Palm Beach Counties actions except to thwart the election of Rick Scott as to new Senator. They are breaking the law, now let them pay the penalty. Now, SEAL EVERYTHING COUNTING IS DONE https://t.co/ZQOduAfubE
@marcorubio They want to thwart the rules let their entire counties ballots not be counted. Since they are breaking the State Law and they know it as well. If they are unwilling to follow the rules let them forfeit any new ballots that weren't counted on time by the LAW. There's no excuse. https://t.co/mBChvvVQbW
@A3Patriot @realDonaldTrump But what she is forgetting is that Trump is her President too. It's a shame when they can't see that fact, or is it that they are trying so hard to see through their ASS's. https://t.co/Bd9XnGP2Dk
@RedNationRising The screw-up here is that @POTUS didn't send in an ARMED Secret Service member into that fray. Then ACOSTA would have been forced to give up the microphone. He's a BULLY and tries to push it all of the time. He doesn't care about RULES EITHER.  The Acosta Rule is BELOW, it fits. https://t.co/ci9gTczwTZ
@BreitbartNews I beg to differ, Jim Acosta is a BULLY, he tries to press that to his advantage even after he was told by the @POTUS to stop and give up the microphone. I think the ENTIRE WH PRESS CORPS needs to sign a form about their actions. Frankly, ACOSTA needed to an armed escorted out. https://t.co/KFFgOFtzLE
@Golfinggary5222 Here's what I call the Acosta Rule and the WH Press Corps will have to pay the penalty as well. Thanks in part for a JACK ASS who doesn't want to stop when told so by the @POTUS. If the shoe fits him let him pay the price. https://t.co/g2MPz7cfhJ
@RealJamesWoods He got what he deserved, and should have had his WH Press Pass pulled long ago. For what he pulled on an aide he should have been arrested. I do know that his CNN Press Pass was revoked. Good Riddance.
@INTJutsu @Acosta @POTUS I called the Acosta Rule because he's always wanting to be the center of attention and to heck with anyone else. He's as selfish a person as I've seen in my 73-years. This needed to be in place the first time he went off on @PressSec. There's no excuse for acting like a PIG.
@INTJutsu @Acosta @POTUS I made a suggestion that would be for the entire WH Press Corps. They are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@Sheckyi Seems they need to impose "The Acosta Rule" for the press. Acosta's problem is that he wants to be in the SPOTLIGHT ALL OF THE TIME, he doesn't adhere to rules and doesn't care about them. They are for others not him. Well, look at this simple rule, for ALL of the Press Corps. https://t.co/fcLP44AX3b

@SenBobCorker  Good for you. If he said whom he'd voted for it might influence others, ask that question after the election. I was always told your vote is ours and yours alone to know. Not to let anyone else who you voted for till after the election.
@Thomas1774Paine Good for him. If he said whom he'd voted for it might influence others, ask that question after the election. I was always told your vote is ours and yours alone to know. Not to let anyone else who you voted for till after the election.

@themouthmatusow Since when has a DemocRAT thought of anyone but themselves? They will say anything to get elected but never follow through with any campaign pledge. My only question to any DemmocRAT is Are You A Talking Point, or do you expect those DemocRATS to do what they said they would? https://t.co/py4RGDAxR8
@Thomas1774Paine Jeff Flake is more DemocRAT than a Republican even to the way he has voted for the most part.
@Thomas1774Paine Had Mr. Obaama not weaponized the CIA/FBI/DOJ there wouldn't have been the crap that came out of their employees, especially since both Strzok and Page were saying POTUS#44 wanted to know ALL.

@realDonaldTrump He's a scumbag and most likely wouldn't like the cell I'd have him put it. An Outhouse, with him in the pit and it's filled to his neck in cow patties. Oh, he wants to eat give him a spoon. Then tell him to eat his way out. https://t.co/pyyd4baAvx

@Thomas1774Paine Personally, I do not know how Bernie Sander got elected espousing a Socialistic platform. Either those electing him didn't have the education to understand that robbing from Peter to pay Paul will ever work. Saying free tuition for college is doing just that. WAKE UP FOLKS, THINK https://t.co/8NVZ9DQKDd
@YellowRose1776 @realDonaldTrump Do understand that MSM is getting funded in addition to advertising by George Soros and his organizations. Soros has said that he wants to DESTROY AMERICA. MSM is helping him do just that. Read the entire picture on the screen below this Tweet, then think of the damage they do. https://t.co/AcE8KU26hv
@Pea01nut @EricHolder I'll do so on the 6th, and am looking forward to it. I will NOT vote for a Socialist running for Florida's Governor. I can tell that there are lots of folks who don't realize the difference between a Socialist and a Communist. Neither are anywhere I want to be. https://t.co/MSUrl1Xu2T
@Agnescitizen While you might have a point on Trump, he certainly didn't steal the Social Security back during the Johnson Administration '69. Congress stole $2.6 Trillion Social Security Trust Fund and put it into the General Fund. Social Security was solvent until they did that
@WEARAllenStrum @weartv That stuff that went through this morning had my flag flying stiffly North and then the rains came in.  I do pay attention to what is going on.
@Thomas1774Paine His problem is he's been eating that cow patty he stepped in. Every time he speaks it dribbles out of his mouth. Have you ever noticed his shit eating grin? I have a picture of his foot in that cow pie. https://t.co/3Fgnw8olsE
@r98121261 As a guy living in NW FL., I wouldn't vote for anyone espousing Socialist values. He wants to raise the Florida corporate tax rate to 7.75 percent  He is endorsed by Bernie Sanders, has received financial support from Tom Steyer and George Soros. Not backed by law enforcement. https://t.co/ZxP2K4uxQ5
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe Anyone who would trust this Socialist is a fool. He doesn't want to trust law enforcement, is backed by Socialist Bernie Sanders, has received financial support from Tom Steyer and George Soros. Now how far left does he have to go? Soros wants to destroy the USA and has said so.
@CBS Awe. I can see there is an anomaly in Wall Street backing Democrats, they also backed Hillary Clinton during her run for the WH, but you neglected to even mention that important piece of fact. So if you are going to put out facts out them all out, not selectively blocking it
@Thomas1774Paine Might or might not be Mika, but NBC News Hid Information that Would Have Cleared Kavanaugh of Avenatti Rape Allegations. Now, this is news that your Corporate partner NBC hid from the American people. What a shame I have it in both print and digital photographs. Read it and weep https://t.co/zLyEKNMlQh
@MSNBC @Lawrence If I were in your shoes and those of NBC, you might want to reconsider your stance on this subject. Since NBC quashed the truth about an Avanti crap. Don't even say it didn't happen. I have text and digital photographs. Read it and weep, seems you are more guilty of this CRAP. https://t.co/f2s3sheyDN
@wvufanagent99 Goodbye. https://t.co/8OXkIdIBDE
@RedNationRising That's the truth, in a nutshell, I happen to know NBC quashed the truth on Kavanaugh. No, they might want to say it isn't so, but I have it in text and digital photo, so they can't weasel out of it. Now you are going to have a digital version of their corruption.

@realDonaldTrump Then you will have to go through the Congress to get that Amendment changed. You could, on the other hand, change the amendment to say what was no more illegals will have children who are U. S. Citizens since the parents aren't citizens.
@Thomas1774Paine Piers why don 't you go back to England and yap at their lacks in their health policy. Yeah, I'm aware of it, and I live in NW FL. But I'm not saying anything about your health system problems and the accessive waits for medical staff.
@jasoninthehouse Way to go, Jason, that's what I've been saying for a long time. But with the caravan coming this way, they want to do an end around trying to bypass that "Small point" which is illegal. Also, most of them are coming for economic reasons, which isn't allowed either.
@BreitbartNews Goodbye,, so sad to see you leave. NOT!!!
@BreitbartNews She should have known better, especially since the folks who did the testing said it could be from South America So she's screwed.

@Pamkmar60 @mnapoleone @RonDeSantisFL Just remember who is funding him. Financial support from Tom Steyer and George Soros. He's endorsed by Bernie Sanders. He supports a $15 minimum wage. With that, there will be a bunch of layoffs, which takes revenue out of workers hands. His fiscal idea doesn't hold water. https://t.co/W08ocHW7aw

@TrumpNewsz He will be if he gets in and imposes that Tax Hike on Corporate businesses because we'll be paying for it through the nose. They'll pass it on to us. He's a Socialist and is afraid to say so. Backed monitorially by Tom Steyer and George Soros. https://t.co/jBpRS1AsV3

@RonDeSantisFL Gillum supports the removal of Confederate monuments. He wants to raise the Florida corporate tax rate to 7.75 percent, up from 5.5 percent, which would generate $1 billion.

@retireleo @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum Now try doing that with 3 female cats as I have here at my house. 18-claws per cat,[That's 5-claws per front paw and 4-claws per rear foot.

@gcmagee @realDonaldTrump Get to be my age, and you might understand why the font size I use Comic Sans MS or Tahoma [16 typefaces] and a 27" screen. I still don't have to use the magnifier, yet.

@PaddedRubberRm @realDonaldTrump Sorry, that wasn't from an email. It did come from Nick Nolte, and if you don't know who he is I suggest you take a gander at his background.  I haven't seen NBC try to deny it, have you? At least I know who he is and what he'd done with his life. Staying clear of politics.
@realDonaldTrump Now, I have a PRIME EXAMPLE OF FAKE NEWS WITHHOLDING Exoneration Information during the Kavanaugh Hearing. Just in case they try removing this I have it in print and photo. As will you if you look at the picture under this Tweet. Awe, this ought to EMBARRASS the heck out of them. https://t.co/hy3ZZSmIej
@realDonaldTrump Left-leaning spin being placed on most of MSM and print publications.

@BreitbartNews What a shame this Hollywood elitist isn't going to get her way. She needs to look around and see who is going to catch her when she falls. It won't be any of her so-called friends, who are only there as long as she is in the spotlight.
@grizzlemeister @BreitbartNews Awe Grizz, don't you know how far the MSM would go to put down anyone put up by @realDonaldTrump. They can't stand him or anyone he is putting to the SCOTUS.

@Thomas1774Paine Somewhere there needs to be a party to party comparison that truthfully shows what both sides have done.

@ScottyTDet How can we forget how he had our troops guarding the poppy fields thereby helping the Taliban. Helped make ISIS more emboldened, not going after them like we should have been doing.

@retireleo @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum He needs to try getting in between 2 cats fighting, without protection. They'll tear him a new one, in that they have 18-claws. Think of going into a catfight and they have 18 knives, you on other hand have nothing for protecting same as taking guns from law officers. He's STUPID https://t.co/3CwfFwQkcc
@RonDeSantisFL Andrew Gillum ought to go to England, find out why not having guns available would be a STUPID option on his part. By disarming our law enforcement officers we'd be sending them into a tiger's den without protection. He'd like to go into a REAL CAT fight they have 18-claws, he=0. https://t.co/NvNzmBbyaG
@usacsmret @FPPTim A platform, you mean a gallows platform. Where anyone who votes them in they will slowly lose their constitutional rights. They want higher taxes, which will finally involve your losing your ability to get ahead. Awe, but that is what some of you want because you want gvmt. help.
@Kimbraov1 @gatewaypundit Gillum better learn that the Gay and Straight people are all citizens of the state. Get over it Andrew you screwed up. Hopefully, it comes back to haunt you as well.
@vickibazter Then how did this suddenly become Republican, unless it's a smear tactic by the DemocRATS? Seems like those RATS didn't want to see another person who is on their side doing wrong. Sandy Hook, Columbine, Colorado Movie Theater, Parkland, were all Democrats., telling isn't it.

@fidgets42 @RedNationRising A Glock is a semiautomatic gun, as are Kimber Arms FNH, Colt, S&amp;W, among others. But you have to get a background check, have a clean record, without any blemish.

@A3Patriot You can thank the DemocRAT admin's, who believe in open borders. They want to destroy our free country as we know it. Make us SLAVES to their radical notions, that they know what we need and want. If you can think of one thing America if free for one and all of it's Citizens. https://t.co/55IAW6lyME
@RedNationRising The problem is that adults don't want to have to unlock their gun in order to use it. Even if it's a trigger guard which locks. This small device will make that gun inoperable to anyone who doesn't have the key to unlock it. But Adults who own a gun have to be responsible for it.
@RedNationRising Strange as it is, gun manufacturers also make safe-gun devices that are for automatics as well as 6-shooters. The thing is that they work if responsible adults will make their weapons child-proof. While I don't have children here my guns are still child-proofed just in case.

@darsavmo Well, this might show you. Just remember they want everybody dependant on the government for everything, thereby making SLAVES of the POOR and INDIGENT.

@Neurotica27 @kwilli1046 That fact has been known since his faked long form birth certificate. There were so many things seen with that document that even could see some of them.  But those Democrats didn't want to admit that they had cheated the American people with a fraud
@kkpinnola @RealFrankFromFL @rubytuesday The area you are in and the politics of that area might preclude the way you dress if you don't want trouble. The area [NW FL] that I live in is predominantly Republican.
@jhorak101 Well, looks like it couldn't happen to a better group of companies. I wonder if Time Warner and Cox are doing the same thing around here in NW FL.
@r98121261 He's not a Republican, therefore not worth the NEWS STORY. But if enough people who have the knowledge of the incident, we can make them look like the FOOLS THAT THEY ARE. Not you Sarge, MSM is though. Sen. Booker isn't sweating, because there is no pressure being put to him. https://t.co/FBHegByz15
@kwilli1046 Got no good news for you, but Obama has been trying to take responsibility for everything that Trump has done saying that his policies were responsible for what has happened.

@true_pundit If you don't like it here, Jane, LEAVE. I remember you as Hanoi Jane a traitor to the USA. So you just might go back to North Viet-Nam and live there, if they'll have you.
@tinkerbelldef @Thomas1774Paine He's also for the New World Order which isn't a conspiracy theory. But it has an Anarchist background, which isn't good either. If you stand back and look at what that will entail, you become a slave with no rights. Except those given to you. Think of the feudal system that's it.
@scarlet56al He could be but remember he has a dual citizenship Hungary, United States. Backs everything to the left, believes in a New World Order as does the Pope. That bit of info just might shake lots of people, but it shouldn't. It isn't a conspiracy theory as people want you to think. https://t.co/p68nBLggjB
@Thomas1774Paine I have a better suggestion, let's send them over to the Vatican. Let the pope fix their problems and pay them from their coffers. The Entry ports of this country need to be totally closed. That means nothing comes in or goes out (cars, trucks, and trains) would be out of luck.
@BirdsLuvFlyers @RealFrankFromFL @rubytuesday You might be right, but my dictionary would not accept that name. But the Grammarly unless you buy the pro version, which is a subscription for over $120 per year. Not worth it to me. Now think of how you'd pay your bills only getting $755.00 per month. I''m doing it frugally.
@AndrewGillum  I have to ask you how much ios it going to cost those of us on Social Security? Next how come your city is known as the death capital of the state? Education system is broken, it doesn't really teach the CORE to our children. Bits and pieces isn't the CORE.
@RealJack The one, the only person who said back in 1979 that he hates the United States and ALL of its citizens George Soros. He has the $$$ to be able to pay for the entire expense. Trucks, busses, etc. Now we don't want open borders no matter what those DemocRATS want. Yeah, I know RATS https://t.co/tRe6eGKeJj
@MSNBC @NBCNews That doesn't matter, have they made application and been vetted? Nope, so CLOSING ALL BORDER CROSSINGS [that's trucks, cars, and trains] they will have to come in where they can end up in detention and then deported. So coming for economic reasons isn't allowed.
@retireleo Senator Booker is going to give away his money from his savings because I worked for what little I get from Social Security. He'll break Social Security then TAX THE HECK OUT OF THOSE WORKING TO GIVE IT AWAY. He's acting like a Socialist, which he just might be. A Foolish Idiot. https://t.co/Dm14NVoW75
@WhoWolfe Yup, you are, But coming to this country using your Caravan, isn't good for you. You have not been vetted so you can enter this country. You want to believe the DemocRATs, who don't happen to be in charge of the government. I support our @POTUS and his act to CLOSE ALL CROSSINGS. https://t.co/yCarSQfaCa
@Dawn_DeMore1 So she proved she's not even close to what she's been saying. There an old saying that we used when I was growing up back in the late '40's and early '50's "Liar, Liar, Your Pants Are on Fire. https://t.co/mBSv4ve5aN

@keljimdixie @BreitbartNews Ask the Top DemocRATs in charge of the House. They are approving her actions. At which point they are complicit in her actions and should be held to that same Code as Maxine is. I'd love to see the US Marshalls do their duty and arrest the lot of them. Read it and weep. https://t.co/BQHNp1EOk7
@larryelder How long did it take to figure that one out? Do you remember back earlier in the year when Chuck Schumer stopped the Budget over Illegal Immigrants and DACA? That should have told you something right then. The same for Blacks and the impoverished they are talking points only. https://t.co/0jVUAe9Qur
@cullinan_jim @BreitbartNews I did point it out to Rep. Biggs that she's in violation of that Code and the violations as pertaining to WH staff and others as well. I sent him one that he could read even better than the on one the message above. But not only to Rep. Biggs, but to Rep.Waters as well.
@GayeElborn @BreitbartNews She was turned in by another Representative for her actions and accused of inciting rebellion. But this was what I pointed out to him He'd asked her to resign. Personally, I'd like to see her with a ball gag in her mouth wearing a muzzle and possibly having a straight jacket too. https://t.co/oFxbpvoGKC
@FranSism1g Think about it, would you break a law that was in the books. Obama did on a regular basis and he spoke openly of doing so,, no one did squat especially in the DemocRAT Party.  HE's still laughing at our feeble attempts to correct his misdoings. We can't afford another Blue Wave. https://t.co/6Cq75mN3Si
@RedNationRising Texas found voter fraud before the early voting could take place. New Hampshire admitted voter fraud when people who had voted hadn't really been residents. Georgia had 276% more votes in one town than were registered, voters. Use paper ballots and hand count, computers hacked. https://t.co/MtoGdiQjU9
@BreitbartNews Maxine had better remember 18 U.S.Code 2383 because she has broken this LAW by inciting rebellion or insurrection against members of the WH Staff. She can be fined or Jailed and it further states "and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States." She blew it. https://t.co/hYIM7hhZaN
Rep. Andy Biggs Maxine's efforts to Innsurrection and Rebellion are breaking 18 U. S. Code 2383  She broke this one	Biggs told The Hill that Waters’ comments do “not become somebody who’s in Congress” and that “everybody agrees that it was just highly objectionable what she did.” https://t.co/Slanxte5PK

Did you see my answer to her comment yesterday?
@Patrici15767099 They bussed them into New Hampshire as well and it wasn't until after the election was it really found out.

@Sheckyi The World leaders have told them this kind of action, isn't allowed and they are going backward (showing their lack of fore-thought brutality in a foreign country) through their own misdoings. This kind of action doesn't hold water. Are they going to act like a civilized nation?
@Sheckyi As an American the death of any one person who is trying to make a difference in his/her community be they here or overseas. Their life does count, in the journalists' case, he was a thorn in the Governments side pointing out the wrongdoings. They eliminated him, without thinking
@poeling_kevin Who listens to the CNN a George Soros funded news network as are ABC, MSNBC/NBC, CBS and a host of others. Ask Gillum about the Murder rate in Tallahassee and the corruption there as well. Now take a gander through the organizations funded by Soros. ALL are  FAKE NEWS Believe it. https://t.co/jTiHr9AbAi
@vabelle2010 @Thomas1774Paine MI = Military Intell, my home of record is Mary Esther, FL. Stationed USNS GITMO 11.5 years got out of Navy, joined Army, Forts Jackson, Ord, Devon, and back to Jackson. Retired with 21.5-years recalled Navy after having been out for 7-years, got another 6.5-years retired 28-yrs
@vabelle2010 @Thomas1774Paine HE had a gr8 following in both the Arabic world as well as the non-Arabic. I was looking at it from my view as a non-Arabic personage. I do have 10-years MI in my background though so I'm looking for things that do not sound plausible. The answer given smelled like cow dung.
@vabelle2010 @Thomas1774Paine It's why Military Intell is a good thing to have, this makes it possible to see through the rhetoric, look for a bottom line. They are finally coming out with a more probable reasoning of what happened. Thanks to world leaders not believing their reply. It puts .them on the spot.
@A3Patriot Can't fight the truth. https://t.co/TOtW1z9xwH
The NewYorkTimes is a George Soros funded propaganda source, so with them saying that Soros or his people aren't funding this is downright stupid on their part. Best you really do some REAL searching, rather than give your conjecture on this subject. Now, look at the 2 pictures. https://t.co/kaF8ZoKfWo
@jhorak101 Oh, would that be true, but I have a sneaking hunch the FIX is in for her. Thanks to Comey and his little Kabal there at the FBI. Jeff Sessions would rather have a DIRTBAG like Rosenstein run his position rather than making sure things were on the up and up. https://t.co/UzQiItGw43
@RealFrankFromFL @rubytuesday They haven't said anything to me at the Fort Walton Beach, FL. RubyTuesday. But that is a different State and different area. Most of the folks around here are Republican with a smattering of DemocRATS.
@vabelle2010 @Thomas1774Paine I wasn't talking to you, I was speaking about the Saudi's saying he was killed in a fight. I don't pay anything to put in my opinion (2 cents American Slang) either. I was in MI back in the '70's thru mid-'80's. Sometimes, folks, misunderstand what I was saying which is a shame.
@A3Patriot If true, Mr. Booker's done screwing anything or body. Now he'll have to answer for his actions. While he might be a Senator, that doesn't make him any better than anyone else. I still think of him as a snake, skunk and overall good for nothing. https://t.co/nduVCAnVYI

@starcrosswolf @RepMaxineWaters @EricHolder @Trump454545 @LVNancy @AppSame @GartrellLinda @DonnaWR8 @KNP2BP @sxdoc @pinkk9lover @FriendlyJMC @SandraTXAS Those members of Congress are breaking 18U.S. Code 2383 by inciting any rebellion or insurrection. The last point of that ruling says "Shall be fined or imprisoned for not more than 10-years, or both, and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States" https://t.co/PPARll9XIF
@SarahPalinUSA She hadn't said she was either. She did say she had Indian Blood and ancestors in her background, implying membership in an Indian Nation. The difference is that she used this misinterpretation to her advantage even to get a Professorship. She is a liar and shouldn't be trusted. https://t.co/SKm52YWd6I
@usacsmret These 6 are breaking 18 U.S. Code 2383 - Rebellion or Insurrection.	18 USC 2383: Rebellion or insurrection Text contains those laws in effect on ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. This doesn't include Sanctuary Cities. https://t.co/mocgGJkl1b
@WhySoitenly The more she speaks, the more of a hole she digs. Her rhetoric hog-wash needs to be cleaned up and about the only way to do that is to IMPEACH MAXINE WATERS from Congress.

@PhxKen Twitter restricted his activity because someone objected to what he'd said.  It's their way of making it hard for anyone who has friended him to see what he's saying. When I'm giving long quotes I have a picture of where it came from as a digital backup. I suggest you do the same
@vabelle2010 How much did you pay for that to be said? Sometimes the truth goes a long way, but spouting CRAP will come back to haunt you in the long run. Hey, he has his fingers crossed behind his back. He's lying and his eyes are so Brown the CRAP  is dribbling out his nose.
@A3Patriot @realDonaldTrump A real gem here. While I know most Fathers tell their son's they must shine, something slipped with this one. His halo is tarnished. But, one thing we do know he isn't honest with the electorate,  so hopefully they will realize what type of CAD and stinker a picture says it all. https://t.co/usiKsVapkE

@realDonaldTrump You are going to have a problem, that it putting troops along the border since by law they are not allowed to be used in the US. That doesn't preclude you from using National Guard troops though.

@jhorak101 @YouTube Spelling is important Jim, PC Times Herald newspaper. They are putting out dire information without any backup for what they are saying. Tyndall does have a Major problem in that a US Highway splits the base. That is a way for someone to get onto the base for nefarious means.
@jhorak101 @YouTube Don't believe everything you see in the local newspaper. The best way of finding out real information is to use the stuff coming out of the Pentagon. They would be closer to what is going to happen, Gov. Scott has put in an appeal about the base being primary employer. NPR had it
@Sheckyi Then,, is the time to "MOVE ON" let the country go and become stronger.

@Mountainman0491 @bbusa617 He did more to push jobs and companies overseas having them leave this country. Eliminated apprenticeship programs, which in the long run means as older workers leave there is no one to take their place in doing a job.

@vickibazter How long did it take you to figure out? The first words out of his mouth just after the new President was sworn in was hogwash. Former CIA director John Brennan personally green-lit the 9/11 hijackers entry into the US after being informed of “potential terror concerns.” https://t.co/BdRjZLXecL
@jhorak101 @YouTube Sort of reminds me of what Hurricane Andrew did to Homestead AFB down on the Keys. It looked like a war zone, the same way Tyndall does now. Yup, I remember B-52's landing down in the Keys, then they moved them up to Eglin AFB into its own area off of that 2-mile main runway.
@RedNationRising Well, are we allowed to condemn your opinions as well Mr. Avenatti, after all an ambulance chaser hasn't got a very good reputation? Ah, but I forgot, you are also a Tax Evader as well, that shot you down too. You have a gr8 resume. https://t.co/e84IajH9NI
@BreitbartNews Born in New York City '67, so she's a US citizen by birth. But that doesn't cure her solid left-leaning stance.

@Thomas1774Paine Ms. Warren if you can't take the heat then get off of the firing range. Problem is that the Cherokee Nation DOESN'T RECOGNIZE DNA TESTS, your family must be registered with the Cherokee Nation, otherwise, your Indian could be from South America.
@SpeakerRyan As soon as Congress puts the MONEY THAT THEY STOLE (with interest) from the Social Security Trust Fund, then Social Security won't be going under.

@retireleo @BreitbartNews “Even Andrew Gillum’s former chief of staff is admitting his boss’ failure to keep people safe,” said Rep. Party of FL. Meredith Beatrice. “How can Gillum expect to keep Florida safe when he has allowed Tallahassee to become one of the most crime-ridden cities in Florida?”
@jeffsessions needs to understand that anyone who lies to the FBI needs to be prosecuted, even if they work for the organization. FAILURE to do so is making the AG complicit to the crime. Come on Jeff, we all know you are in the DEEP STATE. You are NOT HIDING IT @POTUS is BLIND. https://t.co/kjQL0oH12X
@RedNationRising But, we also know that the MSM won't be saying a thing about his activities since it isn't about @realDonaldTrump.

@A3Patriot Why did have her criminal history expunged? What was there? Could it be she's not all that she is making out to be? Also, why did she really need a self-hypnosis?

@RealOmarNavarro Her biggest problem is her mouth speaking before thinking about the ramifications of what she is saying. Inciting others to do wrong makes her as guilty as the wrongdoers.

@dbongino Typical of MSM, they won't say a thing if it doesn't make the @POTUS look bad. Your list shows most of those who actually need a good visit to GITMO on a permanent basis.

@senatemajldr I make a STRONG suggestion you and those lying DemocRATS replace the funds that Congress STOLE from the Social Security Trust Fund. Then it would not be in trouble that it is in. We put those funds in it so your Stealing it doesn't make it right.
@stephphilip8 Why hasn't he been arrested for breaking the Logan Act or even being charged for Sedition? I guess I'm not supposed to know about either of those two Federal Laws. Well, I do and he's broken both of them and doesn't work for @realDonaldTrump/ With that said go get him, now.
@Megan4MAGA @grizzlemeister @TXHurricaneRed @GIJoeOPS @thomesinc @jeepsuzih2 @CB618444 @Goz_1911 @1776HotLips @MAGAGwen Gee in listening to the statement from Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr.: "A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship."

@Sheckyi @realDonaldTrump How else was she to set Avenatti up as a DemocRAT Presidential candidate? He's just what those DemocRATS need so they can lose in 2020.
@darsavmo Also, why did she have her CRIMINAL RECORD EXPUNGED? Was there something there that she didn't want to be seen? Not to worry Christine there is something called the Wayback Machine that can pull them up. Awe, I wasn't supposed to know that, was I?
@WhySoitenly @realDonaldTrump These 2 RATS don't want to understand that what they are doing is actually against the law. Making false accusations is against the law. Having illegals to register to vote, is also against the law. Since they are inciting this breaking the law they need to be jailed as well. https://t.co/DctNCiwgzf
@WhySoitenly @realDonaldTrump He also backed the wrong person and hasn't gotten over that fact.  Now for him to move forward he needs to wake up and see what is good in America.

@jasoninthehouse Jason, Jeff Sessions is part of the DEEP DARK STATE and has been. He had 30 years in Congress and while he was a lawyer, that doesn't mean he knows how to lead lots of people. 	Notice, I added DARK because he isn't really working for the @POTUS. He's helping cover up wrongdoing.
@SonsOfPulaski Now I want you to think of Obama and his hatred for the people of this country. By allowing Muslims in without proper vetting we got the dregs of their society. It was the same thing as what Castro did letting criminals come here back in the '60's. Guess I shouldn't think of that
@Thomas1774Paine Bernie, you understand that fomenting Stalking isn't legal.	Isn't there something like a STALKING LAW?

But, when you see 113 countries in the world require Voter ID's and the US is the only one that hasn't. Says lots about prior Administrations efforts to thwart voter IDs. They love cheating.
@DutyOfAPatriot Serves her right, since she's been an obstructionist. A lying sack of crap, spinning out lies to keep folks voting for her making them talking points but not following through. https://t.co/p0XaUNODuv

@AMike4761 Sharia  Law is in direct conflict with US LAW and ours has priority over ALL others in this country. If you want Sharia Law then, go back where you came from, there it is allowed, but not here. I don't care what DemocRAT told you it's fine, it's not.
@Sheckyi I have a sneaking hunch they won't like this then. Isn't there something like a STALKING LAW? If so then by GOD, let's have it ENFORCED UPON ALL THOSE WHO ARE DOING IT and AGAINST THOSE INCITING THEM TO DO SO. They are as guilty as those doing it. IF necessary NAME the TOP DEMS. https://t.co/I07AZKAszk
@WEARAllenStrum But he's not thinking that the western side of the storm doesn't get hit as badly as the Eastern side. Yes, we did have winds but from the opposite side of that rotation. Also, the Eastern side of Okaloosa County did get hit. NW FL State still has folks there, today.
@larrybigalke @SarahPalinUSA You don't know how to read obviously, Mark Zuckerberg head of FaceBook. What I did was to show he colluded with the Obama Admin as well. But if that has to be explained to you, then you are a lost cause. All of the Social Media folks are on the left removing ALL of our 1A rights.
@EricHolder There is a problem with your idea of "Kicking them when they are down". Here the answer, the DemocRATS have banked on the impoverished, promise them anything but DO NOT DELIVER. This is what they have seen through. They are dropping the Liberal Leftists ideas. THINK! https://t.co/Y4rsZ3CJXH
@SarahPalinUSA You might know something about snowflakes, but I remember walking to school in MA. when there was 4-feet on the ground back in the early '50's. Make you feel like a child Sarah?

@PatriciaPjames @SarahPalinUSA They might have come from the Carolinas, but I doubt it. Homeschooled is another way of their being out at all odd hours.

For the most part, they are lemmings playing follow the leader https://t.co/h7mN7gFVev
@SarahPalinUSA Isn't there a law against stalking? If so, she's in for a rude awakening and if her children are with her they too will be processed and a juvenile facility will take over their care since she is an unfit mother. She had better think before having the Authorities remove her kids.

@PDeplorablegirl @stephphilip8 It pays to look up what the REAL STORY was. Rather than condemn him for something he didn't do.  It's true a mob action is illegal, but Lemon didn't do that. He lambasted the group who had done that on NATIONAL TELEVISION, so if that hurt your feelings, then GROW UP. BTDT before.
@PDeplorablegirl @stephphilip8 Well, he didn't do that. CNN's Don Lemon condemned the protesters that chased Republican Senator Ted Cruz and his wife out of a restaurant on Cuomo Primetime Tuesday night. ... And as a strict constitutionalist, which Ted Cruz is.

@aurorabisig And this IDIOT wants to be in Congress as a DemocRAT.

Most likely coconut trees. https://t.co/Ip9nuQHR9n
@patmn67 @EricHolder That wasn't what I said. Had you looked at the person making that statement, you would understand why I said what I said. I was replying to Eric Holder, and he was complicit for everything done while he was working for Obama. That is what I was saying, and I stand by that.
@RickSantorum Were you familiar with Dr. Ford's learning Self-hypnosis? Did she use this in order to lie about what and happened? You know her lawyers have said she might have lied to the Senators during the hearing.	I'm not a dummy or stupid, I want proof, so I documented all.
@EricHolder You were complicit to whatever Obama wanted to do. You didn't stop his illegal activities. So, who are you trying to fool those who aren't up on what was being done?

@OCSOALERTS Some folks don't take the hint that a hurricane is a dangerous entity to be messing with. Now, on the other hand, they are putting your Officers into harm's way just to keep them safe. Even if it is from themselves. They do the same thing when there is ice on the bridges.
@WEARAllenStrum Due South of Choctawhatchee Bay. If it goes farther West, you might get it as well or Mobile just West of you. In any case, it's going to be a mess for the citizens who are in the direct line of this storm. Yeah, I do pay attention as does NOAA who keeps sending me notifications.
@WEARAllenStrum IT's already West of Apalachicola, looks almost South of Destin which brings in 12-miles from me and 52-miles from Eastern Pensacola. I know the Destin fleet back in Joes Bayou, might be in trouble. Yup, I know they hide there.
@WEARAllenStrum That doesn't look good to me Allen, any farther West and it could get close enough to make us feel on edge. I'm still staying, you'd seen the shot of my location about 6' above the road atop a hill. Winds from East flag almost stiff. If the winds come up I'll the pole into itself

@Thomas1774Paine Dan Rather is so stuck in his belief that Hillary should have won the election that his brain isn't working right, still.

@DeplorableLucy4 @RealJamesWoods Problem, everyone wanted to believe without finding out if the facts warranted their trust. Dr. Ford needs to have a thorough background check done on her. Find out who taught her the Self-hypnosis trick. Find out if it could be used to give false testimony if so I smell perjury. https://t.co/G2rJVmArdG
@KatTheHammer1 @1776HotLips @carrieksada @RealMAGASteve @michaelbeatty3 @trumpovic02 @mikandynothem @Truthseeker126 You certainly did that. But someone has to perform an in-depth background check on Dr. Christine Balsey Ford, not just a cursory check. Find out who taught her the Self-hypnosis trick. I have a sneaking hunch it was used to set Kavanaugh up. There's perjury afoot. Verify first! https://t.co/OBIaZEttwd
@darsavmo I was really hoping he'd try for Feinstein or Pelosi, neither of them have spines and they are quite smelly to boot. The picture says more than 10,000 words could ever say on them. https://t.co/NzStH6Pn1h
@A3Patriot Neat, thing about his going outside among those idiots, if they start something his security detail will finish it for them permanently. They get involved it becomes a Federal Offense to contend with not one that the police department will have.
@darsavmo Schumer should have known better than to trust Feinstein to do anything right from the get-go. But then again consider their ages and it might explain a whole lot. He's going to need a very large crying towel, and quite possibly a shoulder to lean on. https://t.co/nd1jSZyGCN
@SenBlumenthal Well had the DemocRATs abided with Dr. Ford's wishes the public would never have known, But that didn't fit the agenda.

@Golfinggary5222 They will stop at nothing to put in blows against 1 person blaming him for everyone's attacks, which totally isn't true. Then, there is a topic of Dr. Ford learning self-hypnosis. So what is to stop her from embellishing the encounter and putting Kavanaugh's name to it. Purgury? https://t.co/x9tkBYDhEq
@DeplorableLucy4 @RealJamesWoods I didn't, because of my contacts in the Federal Govt., and while I'm not active, that doesn't mean I don't get information. You have not explained her having self-hypnosis lessons and the possibility of using them to prevert her testimony. I smell perjury by Dr. Ford. Left afraid https://t.co/lLFebeDl1N
@darsavmo Now, what did you expect? Nothing that has been going on with this DemocRAT hack job has been really honest. Had it been the FBI would have had the information well before Dianne Feinstein or a member of rstaff broke it to the public. https://t.co/8sr2wS3Dja didn't want it public https://t.co/dr5auUTN3p
@RealJamesWoods Also, why did she learn self-hypnosis? If this were used, could it be used to pervert the truth of what might or might not have been done at the time? But, why hasn't the Republicans investigated this little issue? Who is scared of what?
@FoxNews @senatemajldr @IngrahamAngle A rumor isn't FACT. Also, Dr. Ford was taught self-hypnosis. Could this have been used in order to tell lies to Congress? You bet your ASS she did, to get to the DemocRAT Agenda, which is full of venom. The picture below says it all. McConnel is naive if he doesn't look into her. https://t.co/pbC2aQjaRE

@RobertMueIIer Now, that is funny. Because I got word from a Chinese agent said you are working for them. I'd believe that one because you had not found Russian Collusion.  Except, from the DemocRATs who conspired to get Russian dirt from Russians to blame Trump.
@morningmika Actually, you aren't doing them any help either. Blaming one man for everyone's problems doesn't catch the perpetrators who had raped those individuals. How [self-hypnotizing] would do to a testimony given to Congress under Oath? Dr. Ford was taught this method. Oops
@Sheckyi Ah, but, I also found it in the WSJ on 10/5/2018 12:52 a.m. ET She told FBI investigators that she felt pressured by Dr. Ford’s friends and allies to revisit her initial statement, which she later updated to say that she believed but couldn’t corroborate Dr. Ford’s account.
@DeepStateExpose Hopefully, she retires, but I doubt that. She is a spineless creature who preys on the poor, depressed and disillusioned people who haven't gotten a job or have any hope. But these are who she preys on saying one thing and then not following through. They are ONLY TALKING POINTS, https://t.co/tB9GXNbEPt
@Sheckyi Pressured by Dr. Ford's friends and allies, which she later updated to say that she believed but couldn’t corroborate Dr. Ford’s account, according to people familiar with the matter.	Information is taken from WSJ 10/5/18. Oops, you screwed up again.
Question to anyone who wants to try and answer this, How self-hypnotizing would do to a testimony given to Congress under Oath? Dr. Ford was taught this method. So what was to keep her from using it? Don't tell me only her word, that's not good enough. Don't blame 1 man alone.
@rhjomama @krassenstein Now did you really think that they would do anything that would show what hypocrites they really are? Keith Ellison is a prime example of the MSM not saying a thing. You might ask why he had a judgment against hin sealed? What a FOOLISH JACKASS, HE IS. He's a polecat stinking rat https://t.co/meUYLG79d5

@perfectsliders About time she got a gr8 awakening, although I don't believe it'll have any effect on the way she thinks. To fix this problem, it might take men dressed in White Coats to cart her off to the psych ward. Now they might be able to find out what is her problem. I found her Jackets. https://t.co/EvZliSECgO
@Stoltz59  I hope you liked my choice of a snake for that DemocRAT hack named Avenatti  I get those shots by asking for pictures of different subjects depending on what kind of person they are I make a screenshot and save it as _DemocRAT_Hack in his case.
@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Avenatti is coming out to little too late. Also, the FBI spoke to her from what I could gather and came up with sketchy claims. Sir, YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROOF, not allegations. https://t.co/xOFMVaro7d
@A3Patriot Are you ever naive, most colleges are a bulwark of liberal thinking and leaning educators.

@whitehorses2020 @realDonaldTrump As did I, in fact, I was stationed aboard the USNS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for a number of years.  But I'll have to disagree with you on the treason bit.

@SarahPalinUSA The speed with which Trump has been able to turn things around points to the diabolical depths the Obama administration went to in order to undermine our national strength and way of life.

@FoxNews Seems that Rep. Jackson needs to be investigated for complicity in allowing her intern to do that illegal activity..

@SarahPalinUSA Feinstein knows that her ploy has failed totally. But what she needs now is a reality check to look into her complicity in releasing Dr. Ford's letter to the public.

@PhxKen Let's ask it another way when their argument turns on them are they willing to admit that they were wrong. If they can't do that for the interests of the countries welfare (not TAXATION), then they will need to remember "We the People" do not like being talking points. https://t.co/bnmzkx0bC6
@A3Patriot About time they got a taste of their own medicine. But, I'm afraid the ones that need the lesson aren't going to be the ones needing to be replaced. Feinstein, Booker, Schumer, Warren, Pelosi, Waters, Braun, Boxer, Blumenthal ALL SHOULD GO NOW.
@PhxKen I have a thought for you to think about, today's parenting or lack thereof is a real reason that men don't have a good moral backbone. I was brought up by parents (Mother-Father) when they taught right from wrong. My parents came through the depression and WWII-Korea.
@lilBee67569241 “Egger’s book points out that voter fraud is increasingly common, encouraged by left-wing mega-donors like George Soros who support organizations that commit voter fraud.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Now that Kavanaugh has undergone at least 6 background checks, has anyone thought to do a thorough background check on Dr. Ford and her family, Gr. Father, Father, and Brother? If not why not, because you'll find she's not cracked up to what she seems to be? Accusations w/nothing
@darsavmo That is the DemocRATs Agenda, and if you didn't know it, you do now.  If you didn't know, why didn't you, or were you blind to what they were doing for the past 8-years? They want open borders, hatred for those of us who pay income tax that spends driving us into a hole. https://t.co/mczck7eizV
@GovMikeHuckabee But his domestic abuse of his wife and a sealed judgment against him make him intolerable. If there is nothing in it, why is it sealed? What is he afraid that people would see? He's not entitled to do whatever he wants to do without feeling pushback. You get what you sow, as do I
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry, but I can not agree with Sen. Graham about putting it to the people. For the simple reason that it would be politicizing the highest court in the land by using the citizenry to vote for or against him. That is why the entire Senate gets to vote and it tied the Veep votes.
@Capitalist_HBIC I  use the saw outside, but I do not store it outside. Those cats don't go outside at all. If you allow a cat outside its lifespan is 5 to 7 years. Inside, they aren't out in the elements, don't get hit by cars/trucks and have a lifespan between 10 and 15 years. They are chipped.
@StephenKing Did you watch her facial moves, some of which are dead giveaways of deception and lying. Now some would say she was nervous, but not when she admitted going over the diminutive voice when speaking. As a former military and local cop, she doesn't do well.
@darsavmo So nice of your to use Strzok next to he when her Brother worked with his Sister Jill. I guess no one is supposed to know, but then again if you watched her head movements when being asked questions. She'd rehearsed her speech to make herself sound diminutive. Watch her face.
@Capitalist_HBIC 18-volt battery powered Ryobi 6.5" saw. I'd built a sliding shelf into a 2-drawer utility cart. It's been modified for use as a computer desk. The shelf is 23" x 13.75" with room for the keyboard and mouse. I mounted an LED 5-lite strip under the 40" x 26" top above the shelf.
@darsavmo They need to go into her background including her Brother as well with his ties to Jill Strzok. Now, this gets Dr. Ford into a backdoor to the FBI. Do you expect the FBI to investigate some of its own. really?
@retireleo @gatewaypundit Now you know why I put RAT in DemocRAT because they are. But the US Citizens are partially guilty as well for not presuming innocents as well. Allowing those DemocRATs to have their way obstructing at any chance they could get, using whatever they could. Hatred runs deep in them. https://t.co/yUI5uJgBp9
@Sheckyi Can't fight the truth with Feinstein (Chinese spy), Blumenthal (Stolen Valor), and Sen. Mazie Hirono Tells Men Of Country To 'Shut Up'. There is “No presumption of innocence,” Sen.Schumer (D-NY) said on Tuesday that Kavanaugh is not entitled to the presumption of innocence.
@MichaelJWeber5 Time to have her take training and if necessary hypnotize to repress past events, so she is keeping current not in the past. Repressing prior things is best for focusing on the present, keeping it relevant to the present.

@RealJack “As I said, his credibility is already very questionable in my mind and in the minds of a lot of my fellow Judiciary Committee members, the Democrats.” Hirono later told MSNBC that “we’re not in a court of law, we’re actually in a court of credibility at this point.”
@RealJack Guilty before testimony One of Kavanaugh’s most outspoken opposers, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), told CNN that Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy discredited him. “I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases,” Hirono said.
@RealJack they say the burden of proof is on him to prove his character. “There are plenty of reasons to disbelieve Judge Kavanaugh after his evasive and seemingly misleading testimony,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, referring to Kavanaugh’s previous round of Senate hearings.
@RealJack Several of his colleagues, with the help of the media, have questioned Kavanaugh’s “credibility” in vague terms and likened his nomination to a job interview - one of those job interviews, apparently, where the interviewer is accusing the job applicant of gang rape - wherein,
@RealJack “There’s no presumption of innocence or guilt when you have a nominee before you,” he said. “Find the facts, and then let the Senate and let the American people make their judgment not whether the person’s guilty or innocent, but whether the person deserves to have the office.”
@RealJack “No presumption of innocence” according to Sen. Schumer. The controversy surrounding the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee has prompted questions where the presumption of innocence should lie in a case like this, a question that the left has answered pretty clearly. https://t.co/D1q9ej1GOl
@RealMAGASteve I have a sneaking hunch that Dr. Ford can't pass a Security Background check. But since her page at that Dr. Ford has on the staff of the college was changed. She doesn't have a CA Psychology license which shows why the page got changed. https://t.co/7ummBqlR6x
@Thomas1774Paine Next is the info that her Brother has ties to FusionGPS and Peter Strzok's Sister Jill Strzok. Oops, this little detail will have serious repercussions. It's believed that he's in working with the CIA. This doesn't bode well either. She removed her FaceBook pages Wayback found 2.
@Thomas1774Paine It's been found that her page on the CA college she works for has had a facelift. That being the wording Psychologist/ She has never passed the exam to be a licensed Psychologist. Therefore the page was updated. But the Wayback system found her original page with everything on it https://t.co/oloZqkqu7q

@darsavmo That too, and took money from a foreign investor in her attempt at the governor's race which she ran in and lost. That is beside the point, she took foreign money to run her campaign which is a Federal Offense. Dianne's DIRTY from the get-go, not to be trusted what-so-ever.
@LindseyGrahamSC Ok, where was the background check on Dr. Ford? How much depth was gone into? Did they probe her Brother and who he works with? Now, you are saying what does this have to do with her testimony. Her brother works with Jill Strzok, Peter's Sister Fusion GPS, OK?
@My2CentsGritXO @senorrinhatch That's so they can memorize their lines. Remember that it's only DemocRATs who are doing this. That ought to tell you something, but many will miss that fact.

@SpankyTheDog1 @mitchellvii @DutyOfAPatriot Because this thing is the LEFT trying to get its way. No one has done a real background check on Dr. Ford, including her family ties to the CIA and Fusion GPS. I did do some homework on her but I can't get into some places the FBI can get into. I've been out of Intel. for 30 yrs.
@My2CentsGritXO @LindseyGrahamSC @YouTube While you are investigating, find out how many of them accepted funds from any George Soros funded group or organization. The reason I'm saying that is that in this case, they would be helping with money laundering which is a Federal Crime. Dianne did accept foreign money already https://t.co/8FcQDIYkW8
@tedlieu George Soros is a foreign national and it's not legal to accept funds from any of the groups associated with him. Doing so breaks Federal Law. I believe that ALL of the DemocRATs ought to be investigated for accepting funds from foreign persons or their groups. Money laundering.
@darsavmo Since he was doing her work pro bono, it might have been a payment. But if so doing it on screen makes her look like she's paying him off.

@realDonaldTrump  Did you limit the scope of their investigation, or did you allow them to broaden it to any and all? If not, why not? Remember that Avenatti is involved and I wouldn't put it past him to throw in a ringer. Like the college level gal going to a high school party.

@RedNationRising Keith is a DemocRAT as is she and it wouldn't look good for her to do that. But since Kavanaugh is sponsored by @POTUS for SCOTUS, he is fair game. It also fits those RATs agendas.

@dmaliciouz @UnrealRonBrown @grizzlemeister Do you remember FTG (Fleet Training Group)? Well, I was there in the 1960's thru 1970's.  But that wasn't the only group I was attached to. NCID interesting position considering I looked younger than I was. I also worked with the Marines attached to GITMO. My only overseas base.
@Comey It's a shame that you allowed such a good institution to become a politized piece of CRAP especially the 7th floor. You set yourselves up to be taken down through your arrogant STUPIDITY. The rank and file are still doing the job, but not you. You chose politics over law. https://t.co/A4gGykOEX3
@dmaliciouz @UnrealRonBrown @grizzlemeister Well as a retired Viet-Nam Era veteran I have been to some you would not want to be in either. I can think of 1 that wasn't considered a Federal Prison for a long time. But you might like it there, 80-degree climate 7" of rain in March.  Lush tropical paradise, GITMO.
@Thomas1774Paine Then, you'd better read the mounting evidence going against Christine even from her friends denying Kavanaugh was even at the party. Several didn't even know him. Your Hit Job is going to blow up in your face. What color eggs do you like SLIME GREEN?
@AP_PATRIOT All of the people who got any of those funds need to repay "We the People" for being defrauded by our Representatives and Senators for their misdeeds. It isn't up to us to pay for their missteps. It really needed to come out of their wallets, not ours.
@AP_PATRIOT It's about time everyone who got money from that hush money fund is put on a list along with what it was being paid for. I have a sneaking hunch Mr. Schumer isn't going to like having his name and face plastered up next to the amount paid. Chuck, you have a past pay the piper NOW https://t.co/x16n6gnOb1
@GartrellLinda Almost sounds like that reporter from the NYP who was trying to drum up people against Roy Moore. I wasn't supposed to remember that piece of CRAP that was being looked for, really? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. AH, but since you live in the sewer like a pack of RATS. https://t.co/7XDu20E9sw
@Thomas1774Paine Avenatti is an Ambulance Chaser, trying to pull his left wing crap on Kavanaugh. Hopefully, he told them that if they are caught lying they can go to prison, and if he didn't, he can go with them.
@dmaliciouz @UnrealRonBrown @grizzlemeister No, I don't like the DemocRATs trying to give away money that I've made to someone who is either to lazy to go to work or just doesn't want to. It's these lazy bums who shouldn't be getting any funds without proof of looking for work. I had to be 21 to vote 51 years ago. CHILD.
@UnrealRonBrown @dmaliciouz @grizzlemeister I've voted in every election local, state and federal. Also, For your eyes, I'm registered Republican and have been for over 50 years.
@darsavmo Especially that from Twitter, since you are not sitting in the middle of the road on everyone's biased posts. Be they from the left or the right. We make up our minds, without additional help. We converse with one another and possibly learn the others point of view as they ours.
@darsavmo Seeing as though Twitter had bought the CRAP that the MAINSTREAM MEDIA put out, and now they are back peddling over the Rod Rosenstein firing. They have proved exactly how biased they are. Your problem is that "We the People" have brains and know how to think, we don't need help.
@IsraelUSAforevr Anyone with brains can see the Dems doing everything they can to thwart Judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court. That even includes the Obstructionist Federal Left-leaning judge who is trying to have his way by sticking his ruling to the Senate. Grassley Screwed UP.
@Midgespeaks This can be eliminated by inserting a microchip (similar to one in domestic animals) close to the person's heart. Thereby, being able to track them where-ever they went. Might even lead to grabbing the entire gang and doing the same thing to the rest of them. Deport them, HAHAHA!
@Thomas1774Paine But, then again, everyone knows Michael Avenatti is an Ambulance Chaser. Anywhere he sees a fast buck he's there in a heartbeat and he doesn't care if the people are composing. Just as long as it's against Trump or someone he's put up for SCOTUS. Crotch scratching time Grassley. https://t.co/sdaA0P9lR3
@RedNationRising That judge needs to find himself on the outside without a job. He's trying to tell the Senate how they should run that hearing. WRONG thinking liberal judge has been a thorn in the conservative side.
@grizzlemeister Well, we could hit them in their LIBERAL WALLETS, by not buying Ben &amp;  Jerry's Ice Cream. If they end up overstocked they just might rethink using their business as a "battering ram" against conservative thinking.
@IrishRose23525 @Thomas1774Paine She wasn't Dr. Ford when she was in that all ladies high school, she was Christine Blasey back then. The period in which she claims the incident happened. Got a picture that one of her classmates sent, it isn't one that she most likely one she would not want anyone to see. https://t.co/bSLBZRblZe
@darsavmo She ought to know better. But this also shows parents who do not know where or what their daughter is going or doing. A sad state of parenting if you asked me. It also shows her words are going to come back and bite her. She might have gotten rid of her high school inline annuals
@IrishRose23525 @Thomas1774Paine Nope, sorry but I was listening to a telecast and they mentioned her background with her students and a 2.3 rating, also that she if she got mad at you, held grudges. No, you were wrong on that answer, I di. Spotted d some backchecking and came upon this picture.

@CR @NateMaddenCRTV Sen. Richard Blumenthal needs to start thinking about mending his ways before condemning another person. He's a disgrace to any military member who has served our gr8 country. My personal feeling is that he needs to be placed in the stockade given a toothbrush told c;lean toilets https://t.co/1QZGibOzo2
@grizzlemeister Her problem is that she has not seen the inside of a PRISON CELL. While you are mentioning things, think Uranium One, where Foundation got $145M from the Russians (Looks like collusion, to me.) Also, think Benghazi, and she says who cares, really? https://t.co/oHy9qgEcaE
@darsavmo Yup, I have gotten some words that most likely describe them better. They are a pair of Clowns or: blockheads, dolts, donkeys, dopes, dunces, fools, idiots, imbeciles, jackass's, jerks, nitwits, numbskulls, simpletons, and twits. They could be called STINKERS to https://t.co/rRAv6lXDec

@lonestarmango Her story changes like the wind, she can't remember addresses, numbers, or how she got wherever she was. Bragged to friends she had gotten 43 guys in her sophomore year. Was an alcoholic and regretted saying that. I don't believe she could get past an in-depth Background check. https://t.co/bZ9enmLdwA
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, did she bother to let you know she'was an alcoholic. Couldn't remember numbers, names, and addresses? Also that she'd bragged about getting 43 guys during her sophomore year to another gal. You need to do some real homework on Dr. Ford https://t.co/lDEEwyItqz
@Jim_MEfish @grizzlemeister The first line of section #1 has the answer. It says, CITIZENS of the United States, I do not see where it says Non-US Citizens could vote. Also, SCOTUS said they don't have the rights of US Citizens. So what is it that you don't understand? https://t.co/cmuxDZGRLa
@r98121261 Once Rosenstein is gone then remove Sessions. Both he and Rosenstein are DEEP STATE. Ever wonder why FOIA requests are being slow-walked, really? Here's one to think on Rod's wife Blocks ALL FOIA requests for FBI/DOJ [She's a CIA Agent] and needs removal as well. https://t.co/7diTyEc0Z9
@r98121261 As bad as Sessions has been, he needs to REMOVE ROD ROSENSTEIN NOW. Charges Colluded interests Mueller, Comey, Obama, Bush, and Clintons. Owes career to Mueller and is being mentored by same. With the above knowledge, Mueller should never have been appointed Special Council.

@Mediaite She bragged about doing 43  guys in her sophomore year in high school, bragging to friends about it. Has a problem with locations, names, numbers and was an alcoholic. I don't think she could pass an in-depth security background check. Oops, doesn't bode well, does it? https://t.co/CxrifbLHmM
@Thomas1774Paine Let's see, that took place under Obama's watch and he did nothing, but he knew about it. But allowed it to go to the Trump Administration, so by all rights Comey was wrong from the get-go.  But understand Comey was anti-@POTUS from the get-go. He expected HRC to win then cover-up
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Awe, But understand Jeff Sessions is part of the DEEP STATE. How else do you find the FBI and DOJ slow-walking FOIA requests? Rod wrote the letter for Comey's firing that the @POTUS did. Seems to have a conflict of interest, but not only for that but the person he named Mueller.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump In more ways than one Mike.  He and his wife [she's CIA] owe their careers to Mueller Comey, Obama, Bush, and Clintons. Rod has no business involving himself in the Hillary Clinton-DNC funded Steel dossier, and the ongoing Russia investigation. Mueller is a mentor for Rod and Mrs
@smalltownandrew Something tells me she has not looked into the accuser's background very well. Had she done so she could have found out about the alcoholism, not knowing addresses numbers, names. Her bragging that she had 43 guys in her Sophomore year. Promiscuous you might say. https://t.co/lLNdBYSD3D
@PoliticalShort Hmm, He wrote the letter for Comey's firing that the @POTUS did. Seems to have a conflict of interest, but not only for that but the person he named as Special Prosecutor. He's beholding to him for getting his job in the first place along with his wife. Remove him,, then Sessions
@retireleo @Golfinggary5222 @jeffsessions Now you don't suppose I've destroyed the Rosenstein's careers because they are part and parcel beholding to Mueller. Now with that knowledge, he should have never appointed Mueller. Had Mueller any honesty, he'd have turned down the appointment, but he doesn't have that.
@retireleo @Golfinggary5222 @jeffsessions First, you remove Rosensteinandwife because of their MAJOR conflicts. Both owe their careers as US attorneys to Mueller, Comey, Obama, Bush, and Clintons. Rod shouldn't have involved himself in HRC-DNC, Dossier and anything Russian. His and wife’s mentor is Robert Mueller.
@retireleo @Golfinggary5222 @jeffsessions Awe, But understand Jeff Sessions is part of the DEEP STATE. How else do you find the FBI and DOJ slow-walking FOIA requests? His being the AG is a sham, He's allowed, Rod Rosenstein to run his job. Rosenstein has NO BUSINESS doing anything since he's totally conflicted.
@marklevinshow The Obstructors-in-Chief of the DemocRAT Party. They are mad at the RepublICANs for holding up Merrick Garland's vote to SCOTUS. You don't have to tell me that, so they are pulling the same crap, the only thing is that they are not in charge, and they think they will be in Nov. https://t.co/qjrXwh1wPj
@Thomas1774Paine If the @POTUS wants to stop him, he can set a warrant out and the border crossing points would be closed that includes all of their airports. It would be best if he came forward to whats against him, but he's a chicken shit. https://t.co/50IobXO4Jw
@SuzetteParfait @RealJamesWoods @SenFeinstein No kidding, but that doesn't put her above breaking the rules Senate Rules. But she also knows they won't do anything to her and that is wrong. Rules need to be enforced for everyone no matter how long you have been in the Senate.
@Thomas1774Paine It now sounds like the Pot calling the Kettle Black. Cory beware your delay called out over his 1992 column detailing teenage groping,  penning another article that mentioned the controversial column, which he said was about “date rape,”. Now that isn't bright at all. https://t.co/51ePtgiIgV
@Thomas1774Paine $1.00 per year for 99-years, at that rate Barack, ought to build it is his home country of Kenya rather than Chicago.

@lonestarmango She'll be torn asunder because her tale has a running narrative never the same way upon each telling. I certainly would like to see how she'd do with an in-depth Security Background Check. I don't think she'll pass it with flying colors. https://t.co/qnBHczpE07
@lonestarmango @gatewaypundit Instead of writing a book McCabe had better find a way of getting out of the headlines. His buddy Comey is also just as guilty as he is, so don't feel smug in your ignorance of those of us who can piece together your Coup de Gras over the duly elected President. Gonna Swing Soon. https://t.co/xkO00757dX
@DailyCaller Cannon fodder, she needs to undergo a thorough background check. I don't think she'll pass. The other males who were at that supposed party said it didn't happen, denied it totally under a penalty of a felony. But she might be going after his Mother because she ruled her parents. https://t.co/FrW8vMXWSM
@lonestarmango No, but she ought to have a Security Background check done on her behalf. I  have a sneaking hunch they won't get a stellar outcome. But don't act surprised, she has changed her story-line far too often. She could be trying to get to his Mother for a ruling against her parents. https://t.co/WPHrLQwUpq
@senjudiciary Do you really expect them to follow through, really? After all, that accuser needs to have a Security background done on her. It'll come back with less than stellar remarks. Might even find out she is taking advantage of this effort to get back at his Mother. https://t.co/yoG6FLHhNX
@RedNationRising Gotta love it, she doesn't seem to mind breaking rules while in Congress, so what is she going to say when she gets charged with Sedition?
@RealRodCairns @Thomas1774Paine That would work if we were at war, but we aren't. SEDITION will also result in GITMO.
@Thomas1774Paine Well, in that case, let's REQUIRE a background check be done on Christine Blasey Ford. They'll find out she's not all that she's supposedly cracked up to be. She was an alcoholic during her sophomore year in high school, bragged she'd gotten 43 guys. Could be a try at his Mother. https://t.co/6w9HZUJHyr
@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Booker, can you take another background check and have a spotless record? I doubt it, your mouth keeps getting in the way of your brain. What about the ethics complaint has been delivered to the chm. and co-chm. of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics against you sir. https://t.co/nvrBAi5G37
@RealJamesWoods @SenFeinstein She brought that onto herself, didn't do any background check on him. Acts like she's naive like a dummy. https://t.co/YQAK0um3wD
@RealBasedBlonde Spread dirt, and it'll come back to haunt you. But with the accuser saying multiple ways Kavanaugh did, So why is there not a FULL BACKGROUND CHECK done on the accuser? What are you afraid of? A less than spotless background? After all What's good for the Goose is good for Her. https://t.co/9D5yB4z4w1
@Sheckyi You might say that, but she then could be looked at in a different point of light. That of getting back at his Mother because of a ruling against her parents. I think a background check on her should be done. Make sure she's spotless, I believe it'll come back smeared in dirt.
@GovMikeHuckabee Given time for a background check done on the accuser, rather than Kavanaugh, you'll find her background isn't spotless. She changes her narrative on the attack, that is misleading. She could be trying to get even because of his Mother ruling against her parents. https://t.co/37xXiFhlaF
@RedNationRising She can be removed, simply by revoking her security clearance. Without that she won't have access to anything marked Classified, Secret, or Top Secret. The shame is I know that as a former NCID and MI Code Security Officer, I know. She can also be called on for sedition.
@RepAdamSchiff Adam it would behoove you to learn more about the accuser. In her sophomore year, she bragged about having 43 guys. She was an alcoholic, doesn't remember addresses, numbers, or names. Now, how reliable is that? Not very. I know she's a liberal activist, so what. https://t.co/NgzH0C7XEC
@Sheckyi Yeah, but Christine didn't cover up her past as well as she should have. The information on her exploits and her alcoholism is well known. She doesn't remember addresses where things happened, she doesn't remember names, nor numbers. This doesn't bode well for her. https://t.co/hxhknYcN4X
@ChuckGrassley With a little more research, I've got her nailed as an alcoholic, had numerous partners while in high school, can't remember names and or numbers. So, we are supposed to trust her honesty? I think not. https://t.co/D0pwqnm88Y
@Lisa_Lisa_NJ @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump Well, I've got some new information that might break Christine Blasey-Ford's accusation to smithereens. She's not being straight with anyone and if they really pick onto her background they'll find it out as well. But trust the MSM not to verify anything especially against Trump. https://t.co/Lotz5Z7Zbu
@freetelegraph @TuckerCarlson Yeah, I agree. But I have also noted the DemocRATs are two-faced liars. If it suits them they go with it, but if it'll help the other side they are all against it even if it was the same thing. https://t.co/055QFjrIbp
@LadyRedWave Especially since he was involved with the abuse of power. Consider who his boss was. Now, on the other hand, he's been interfering with US Policy breaking the Logan Act, that is what he really needs to worry about. GITMO awaits his showing up. https://t.co/MRZF1AE4gO
@ord3001 She bragged about doing 43 guys in her sophomore year, she could be considered as being promiscuous. This doesn't sound or smell right. I know she took a lie detector test, did they ask about her prior sexual encounters? I'll bet not and that has a gr8 deal to do with viability.
@ord3001 Listen to her, her story keeps changing, as a COP she's incriminating herself over and over. If she were truly sexually abused, there would have been a police report of the incident. None being found leaves people to think she's making up a charge. She bragged about doing 43 guys
@homerobento That would help, but it won't happen, it's not in the DemocRAT agenda. They hate @POTUS so much they are willing to destroy this country. She did open a can of worms which shows what RATS they really are. https://t.co/11nlaeqDlQ
@BridgetKF30 @KatTheHammer1 @gatewaypundit @FBI @Scotus @SenFeinstein Quite possibly you need to Google Security Clearances Kavanaugh had. It gets very interesting when you realize he had to have one for each person he was over. You have a Security Clearance for each Federal job you undertake, so there were more than two under Bush too.
@overtaxed23 @CatTiara2 @freedom_moates @SenFeinstein The problem is that everyone thinks that Florida is only the peninsula is but they forget that there is another is a panhandle on the state as well and that there are two time zones too. Why do people forget about the panhandle? There are at least 5 military bases up here.
@Sheckyi Figures. But she said she wanted to hold it back for the accuser, but then leaked some of the information. Sitting on it wasn't the best thing to do. She should have let the others on her side of the party know what she had but didn't. You tell me if this isn't obstructionism. https://t.co/P8H8a5AxOr
@ChuckGrassley Every time she talks about it she keeps changing the story, which leaves me thinking that it's a put up job. To be reliable the story needs to be consistent all of the time.
@BreitbartNews Ah, then Mr. Gore you need to get away from your private jet which pollutes more than a small African country while you are pushing climate change. He's still in league with Bill Clinton
@Thomas1774Paine Original coke was put out in pharmacies because of the drug that the drink was based on. I remember going in and getting it there. Now that might be news to some of you, but anyone born in the 40's would remember that.
@Thomas1774Paine Oh, boy, now they'll have to get a drug license. Then realize that it can't be sent across state lines unless the state next to the one they are doing it for has a Marijuana capability as well. Because shipping across state lines could get them into all sorts of problems.
@RealJamesWoods Sounds like something you would have pulled. But I have a question for you, it's not a joking matter, but it is what was happening to the United States under Barack Obama and most likely would have continued under Hillary Clintons Administration. https://t.co/FIxo4LCoDK
@Thomas1774Paine Because she couldn't cheat her way into office is better to put it. She wasn't to be trusted, didn't tell the truth or could not wrap her mind around what the truth really was. She put folks in harm's way and then didn't send in help when requested. Remember Benghazi! She didn't. https://t.co/8sXIop6D8c
@overtaxed23 @CatTiara2 @freedom_moates @SenFeinstein Florida isn't a Red State try, try again. South Florida might be but not where I'm located. Solidly Republican
@Thomas1774Paine Mueller was his own biggest leaker, then he loves blaming it on someone else. Sounds almost like the DemocRATs when they have pulled the same thing especially Jeff Flake and he got caught red-handed. What a can of worms this bunch is. https://t.co/gsRDoiYUDp
@freedom_moates She's also a LIBERAL ACTIVIST go figure. Now compare her to what happened with Anita Hill [a liberal activist] before and the comparison is right there. Awe, we aren't supposed to remember her though, try again.
@Thomas1774Paine LEO is responsible, she should have reported it immediately. The FBI doesn't handle 30+-year old requests, they pass it to the local police. Since she didn't report it when it had happened, this could have been any one of the 43 boys she'd had sex with. She bragged too much.
@freedom_moates @SenFeinstein As a retired military NCID and a local cop, it has to be reported immediately, not over 30+-years later after the fact the statute of limitations has run out. Also, the supposed victim needs to realize her bragging that she'd gotten 43 in her sophomore year, doesn't bode well.
@freedom_moates It's a matter of opinion. If the committee is for Intel they do but on a fishing expedition, they might not have. The Gang of Eight is supposedly a co-equal branch with the Executive. https://t.co/La5NhWyDMW

How about that can of worms https://t.co/CBvFBr6sPk
@RedNationRising Simple, don't allow any into the gallery, also let them know anyone disturbing the proceedings will be JAILED for "Disturbing the Peace" and "Inciting a Riot" or both. This way they could spend their time twiddling their thumbs while sitting in a cell.
@KatTheHammer1 @gatewaypundit If there was a Police Report filed 30+-years ago it would have come up on Kavanaugh's record. It never showed up. Your police report would flag your name permanently. Those saying that aren't telling the truth. Filing 30+-years after the fact doesn't do any good statute ran out.
@RedNationRising But you also knew that the DemocRATs would pull dirty tricks. The accuser needs to know her bragging to her high school friends about getting 43 guys during her Sophomore year leaves me thinking she was very promiscious while in high school. Now she comes out with this, really? https://t.co/88Waf0TJoR
@JeffFlake Awe, Jeff, you need to do some homework on the woman making her accusation, I did. She's what I'd call promiscuious. Bragged to others she'd gotten 43 during her sophomore year. She a Liberal Activist DemocRAT. You want to trust that kind of person, really? I don't. https://t.co/oYvUbqacid
@ChuckGrassley Seems that you are being shadow-banned by Twitter when I was trying to send you some information. Seems I asked question "How promiscuous was the accuser"? I got a reply that even shocked me.  But this ought to help you when you question her. She's liberal activist https://t.co/guV8iZFYbf
@RedNationRising Maxine Waters needs to have a charge of SEDITION placed against her. She won't like the pushback from the charge. Since her statements made MSM, so there is a video trail as well. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan
@MATEMARY1 @TheMarkPantano Hopefully, someone has sent this info towards Sen. Grassley. This might help him. Also, she's a Liberal activist.

@Thomas1774Paine That 357 Mag 6" barrel looks like a cannon when looking straight at the barrel. That's my carry piece of choice. I've had it for over 40 years, I'm used to it. While I own a Glock Mod 19 Gen 4, I like the feel of that pistol to the automatic. True the auto shoots more bullets.
@Midgespeaks Understand if it doesn't hurt @POTUS they won't say a thing. I'll bet over half of the current DemocRATs in Congress could be brought up on charges. Note I did say what kind of charge, it could be sedition or drugs. Breaking either Senate or House rules, Pot calling Kettle Black.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller's conflicted from the get-go. Start with osenstein and his wife, owe their careers as US attorneys to Mueller, Comey, Obama, Bush, and the Clintons. Mueller's covering his own rear and his own problems that he created in allowing U.S. uranium to be sold,”
@SailorBob2016 @BreitbartNews Just look who he was the Vice President for and then go figure. All we have to know is that the DemocRATs in any government are anti-American, they want open borders and slowly take away our rights as Citizens of a Democratic Republic. Note I did not say, DemocRAT. https://t.co/iaGrZkFy52
@MarkYoungTruth I  beg to differ, you are not a Christian. Chelsea, why are you wearing your cross in the sign of the Devil? Oops, we weren't supposed to notice that I guess, but when it is published for everyone to see, then it's your problem to show why you worship the Devil. https://t.co/BrVQb3Tni6
@trumpdumpcare Ah but, Mueller doesn't care about conflicts of interest. By the time you found out, he was doing his illegal thing. He has said that "the Constitution is Unconstitutional" and that "I am the Constitution". He's full of sarcasm and doesn't care what is being said to him. https://t.co/oiS4UdOhrW
@TheMarkPantano Let's see, the statute of limitations are long since past memories are fuzzy not everything remembered will be the total truth. Kavanaugh went to Georgetown Prep. an ALL Male school, so to have a female anywhere near them they would have to go off campus. How promiscuous was she?
@Thomas1774Paine Well, now, aren't we glad he's not? I don't think we could take another 4 or 8-years of him. He was the 39th President, more of an outsider, not a known politician. People accused him by saying he didn’t have a coherent or effective policy for the economy to address them.
@RepDevinNunes Problem I see with documents being declassified is that their release will also be to the public, thereby making it so that the guilty parties cannot be prosecuted. You might regret doing what you are bound and determined on doing.
@JudicialWatch Had Comey been a real stand up guy for the FBI, there should not have had any of this crap. But he allowed the politicization of a law enforcement agency along with the CIA. He's FUBAR and needs to see the inside of a Stinky jail cell. https://t.co/ooHPFAAaRS
@JudicialWatch Barely legal and on the verge of going against House Rules, which could disrupt her plans for 2020.  But I don't know anyone who would trust her to do what she spouts, because they are ALL TALKING POINTS.  I'm NOT A TALKING POINT and NOR IS ANYONE ELSE. MAXINE HAD BETTER RETHINK https://t.co/8Lp2dG0oS5
@Midgespeaks What a crying shame the DemocRATs can't keep their minds on doing a job correctly. But look at what Maxine Waters trying to push hatred on to her followers. Now you tell me what sounds good about that, I can see no good at all. https://t.co/v3uwL4jV2y
@Yusnaby Then the answer to the problem is to become bilingual. All those at registers need to be bilingual so as to keep from having problems. But Miami is becoming "Little Havana" and they need to post on their signage SPANISH SPOKEN ONLY HERE, and lose revenue [aka customers]
@RepMaxineWaters I'm going to blow apart your "Trumps Kremlin Man" and put it squarely in Hillary Clinton's lap. Since she and Putin were all chummy during Uranium One. Also, for the DNC and HRC setting up that Russian who went to Trump Towers meeting. Tell me she didn't, LIAR. https://t.co/nmgDwUsWGa
@LadyRedWave Cory's got a problem and it's called his MOUTH. In his Facebook post, Booker not only admitted to the violations but objected to the rules 	themselves, saying, “The classification of many documents as ‘Committee Confidential’ is a sham.” Well if you think that way remove yourself https://t.co/oiFpEdnaVH
@Thomas1774Paine Oh, by running business' offshore you brought up this countries economy? Like Mud. Try admitting that you were trying to ruin this country. You and your liberal DemocRAT friends who hate America and what it has given them. You are ALL HYPOCRITES, some of them need JAILING. https://t.co/q0CWUaQBWz
@CAMERAorg In the case of these reporters, it's the blind leading the blind. They don't bother to make sure the facts that they are spouting are even right. Now I'm sorry if I told you the truth, but that was what we were taught back in the early '60's. It still holds for today's reporters. https://t.co/ERVXmRE2wJ
@DeepStateExpose Now if #44 was willing to admit he was an illegitimate and Unconstitutional, Foreign President, born in Kenya!!! Oops!!! So, where does that leave the DemocRATs? I know, hiding their heads so they don't see what was done. They are ALL complicit in the debacle called Obama Admin. https://t.co/9TWCxUPnzs
@PhilBingham4 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump How do you figure since it was the DemocRATs who were aided by the Russians? Paid for a salacious dossier. Have a DemocRAT lined Special Council panel. Of course, if Mueller makes a mistake he can be arrested for his misdeeds in MA. Oops, you didn't remember that, did you?
@starcrosswolf @AppSame @Trump454545 @GartrellLinda @DonnaWR8 @KNP2BP @pinkk9lover @LVNancy @sxdoc @1Romans58 @LeahR77 He's following a gr8 line when you think of it, but he's also a miscreant no good devious JACKASS willing to sell out his friends and tarnish the name of the FBI. Watch the videos his posture gives him away when he's lying. https://t.co/Kus1KtpqQb
@Thomas1774Paine In addition to hiding the POW's from Viet-Nam with his good buddy John McCain (don't bother saying he was a war hero, more like a traitor to those he left behind), but that doesn't surprise you. You ought to know there are those of us who know the truth, and it will make you free https://t.co/i0KcWGmsjd
@_CharlesBarkley A very good idea Charles, while I voted Republican, there are still some DemocRATs that I would consider good folks. But, the ones that use people as talking points only and then do nothing to get the people raised out of their poverty are worthless to everyone. https://t.co/wFpWroYdEq
@RealDark_Kent Try telling that to a liberal DemocRAT and win. They are anti:	EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR. They need either a good swift kick in the ASS or voted out of office because they are set to destroy this country as we know it.. https://t.co/MS5f61wZlo
@realDonaldTrump Those were the ones that they could get to in the cities, don't forget the rest of the country where the power still has not been restored yet. People were dying in the country where medical help hadn't even gotten to them. But I guess they don't count, right WRONG. EVERYONE DOES
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump At least I have documentary proof to back up what I'm saying, where-as Ted doesn't. Innuendo, conjecture, and sometimes out and out lies are your mantra. Now I don't look as old as I am, but our @POTUS is several (9) months younger than I am. US History I'm very good at. https://t.co/F7KkKdoU4C
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Like you have Ted, Feinstein with a Chinese spy, Waters, the most corrupt rep, Pelosi dropping classified on the floor for the MSM to see. Then there's Schumer who wants to remove our guns while he keeps his. A really gr8 group you have there, Ted.
@QadiumInc Our extensive knowledge shouldn't be eliminated from any DOD security program. Do you know ALL fuel, ammo, VOR-TAC, TAC-CAN freq. listings? A DOD Contracting service left this info in the back of a cargo van, I saw all of them. These were supposed to be returned but weren't.
@QadiumInc Problem, that I see is those who retired from the military. We are still listed in the DOD computer system. Just because we are retired, our specialties are still in some cases classified. I know mine is because of the sonar and radar system I worked with. They're still working
@RealSugarLily @_L_o_r_i_ A person who should take precedence in our history books. But leave it to the book writers and manufacturers to leave this important item. They would rather use current things instead of putting an individual of color as a role model. He would be better to use then  sports people
@TexBrussow @EricMoo91919605 @GartrellLinda @SenFeinstein No kidding, but these folks only have one goal, to DESTROY the CONSTITUTION. They can't stand it really don't understand why it was written. https://t.co/m1U9qJiKil
@bjscodywody1 @AlbertJitka @GartrellLinda That has been true for a long time. But there are lots of folks who really don't know the beginnings of the DemocRAT Party. Yup, I did call them RATs because that is what they truly are. Now think do we really want to trust them to do what they say they'll do? I DON'T. https://t.co/B3Y6M34JqY
@cjdtwit Not this group of sick-o-fins. They have been on office long enough to amass fortunes at the taxpayer's expense. They vote themselves pay increases but can't do it for those on Social Security. This isn't right, they do very little get paid handsomely starting at $193K it goes up https://t.co/kyRk18SkBN
@NowVeteran Depends on what you are calling OLD, kid. When I went in back in '63, I volunteered. I also had a college degree in my back pocket. The Navy sent me to OCS, my eye got me out of becoming a pilot, they didn't WO though. Weapons, I was rated rifle Expert by the NRA back in '53.
@GartrellLinda Now if history serves me right, Diane Feinstein had a Chinese agent working for her for over 20 years. Shall we go in for character assassination on her? Heck, she just might lose her seat on an important committee. It would serve her right. She's a LIBERAL hypocrite. https://t.co/kVuFAOBjzG
Pinocchio Obama. Every time he said anything his nose grew longer, didn't really know how to tell the truth without stretching it. https://t.co/tD3LrHEWtR
@RealBasedBlonde I've followed Sessions since he went to Congress. He'll go with the rest when it helps his agenda. He knew that he was going to get out from the Russia investigation because of a conflict of interests, but he didn't tell Trump at the time of his appointment as AG. You read mine.
@RealBasedBlonde About time, but Sessions will flub it and they'll get off scot-free. His problem is his heart isn't in it, while he might be a registered Republican he's anything but. He knew from the get-go he was going to recuse himself but didn't tell Trump. What a farcical piece of crap. https://t.co/BT5YB7Prwd
@GovMikeHuckabee Mike, do realize when DOJ IG. Horowitz had leaked 375 salacious, anti-Trump texts between FBI chief of counterintel Strzok/Page, he let them off.  Horowitz is a George Soros cut out groomed at Harvard Law MA. Rep. Frank (D) and law prof Chandler, his handlers
@Thomas1774Paine They always have, they like LIBERAL decisions those DemocRATs were making. Not threatening them because of their 1st A violations of those saying things that they don't like. FaceBook is an Over-Blown Advertising Agency posing as a social media site. The Safety settings worthless https://t.co/4iUs5L6ZZe
@officersharon @tedcruz @BetoORourke 28-years ret CWO 3 dual service, mostly Navy. 10-years local cop broke back neck and left arm totally [wrist (powdered) elbow, and shoulder]. 8 knee operations 4 per knee, I can still go down to a full squat without cartilage in knees.

@officersharon @tedcruz @BetoORourke Texas won't let a Floridian vote there especially when I live in Florida. But I'll stand for you, but you won't catch me at an NFL game though. I'm not driving 350 miles in any direction to see either Atlanta, Jacksonville, or New Orleans, and won't go to Tennessee either 450 M.
@paphotog @realDonaldTrump Or put them on a ship with enough fuel only to get there, not a return trip. Mean I know, but very suitable for anyone needing a 1-way trip.
@FoxNews Yeah, especially when it's a Nov 2016 filming of that Google meeting,  stirring up an old cauldron full of worms. The thing to do is to let them see the error of their ways.  Otherwise, they can feast on the "Can of Worms" below. Boy, they look yummy to fish. https://t.co/XpiEBCMg5M
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @Google @BreitbartNews I do wish someone would have looked at the actual date of that filming, November 2016 while Trump was setting up his administration. Now Breitbart is pulling it out as NEW news. The folks at Breitbart owes everyone who has seen this an apology for stirring up an old cauldron. https://t.co/ikso6ym1l3
@darsavmo Ms. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't have all of her facts correctly placed.

@Thomas1774Paine Now, what would he expect from a die-hard Clinton supporter to say in a slanderous book, really? Firstly, Cohn had no business talking to Woodward, if only because of the left-leaning rhetoric. Secondly, anyone who can't tell the truth when giving news is totally untrustworthy. https://t.co/ctPnPzzxh8
@CarolMandziara @GartrellLinda My secondary answer the Pope's willingness to cover-up what his Clergy members have done is against GOD's Law. Since the Pope is in charge, he's not doing it right. All Popes have been doing the same thing for years. But they are supposed to be leading the flock not abusing them. https://t.co/DHLBrpzDJb
@retireleo @gatewaypundit I've got just the place for them, they'll hate their predicament. Some can urinate on them as well as crap on them and they will be helpless to stop it in the hole they'll be in. I think they will learn a smelly stinky lesson. https://t.co/rZDRdWA0U6

FIX your Church or authorities will. https://t.co/87Ksa2Hiyu
@Midgespeaks The picture above shows a BULL SHIT ARTIST, not a great one either. He's a liar, a thief, a murderer, a cheater, with all that said he's doing what the Quran has said about infidels. He is forwarding Islam following that word. I only wish folks would think about he's a Traitor. https://t.co/o3cNZ3IHrL
@prayingmedic Tell me how does Trump control "Mother Nature"? He doesn't Why don't you try blaming West Africa for the dry wind and sand that is being blown across the ocean. Anyone who is following the Washington Post has a real problem. They'd believe the sky is falling if the Post said it.
@rhjomama @krassenstein 3 LIARS, who have been doing what they are accusing Trump of doing. They get illegals to come into and then have them vote illegally and claim that they didn't know anything about it. Their eyes are turning so Brown the SHIT us dribbling out of their noses. The DNC is FUBAR. https://t.co/6DU0Wa07JC
@GartrellLinda I was molested in Waltham, MA,, back in 1953. As a Theology student with a BA, I came to grips with what was done and gave the problem to a much Higher Authority. I put it in HIS HANDS and HE'LL take care of it as HE does all of our problems as long as we leave them as HIS feet.
@GartrellLinda In most cases, the Church moved them around to get them out of the eye of any authorities. Some moved up into the hierarchy of the Church. The complaints fell on deaf ears. Because they too had done the same thing as well. But there is ONE who will Judge these people harshly. https://t.co/j1steAaiqq
@RepMarkMeadows But with Horowitz releasing the Strzok/Page texts, they can't be prosecuted for them. National security experts are skeptical. They say such revelations of fraternization among FBI officials are by themselves grounds for immediate revocation of security clearances and dismissal, https://t.co/vRVunyOyn2
@Thomas1774Paine But should you do it, it'll cost you dearly. I'd just as rather see him buried up to his neck in pigs dung, given a spoon and told eat your way out.

@retireleo Nope, I don't have one either, but I do a 30" round Big Green Egg which uses lump coal and can grill, smoke, and bake.

@AP_PATRIOT That's their mantra, take from the haves and give it to those who don't want to try and better themselves by working. This is why @realDonaldTrump requires they try and work in order to get help from the govt. If you trust those DemocRATs, then you are as STUPID as they are. https://t.co/z1YnmLiG21
@JudicialWatch Comey has more than Patriots to worry about. He's lied to everyone he's spoken to, let's say he even lied to the Inspector General. Clinton is the least of his worry. FBI/DOJ could HANG him easily and no one would know how it was done. Now, my friends in Mil Intell say he junk.
@Thomas1774Paine Bob Woodward ought to know there are folks who are really honest and can see through his BS spin.  Also if he still has a Security Clearance, it won't be for long. He's a prime example of why Security Clearances should be removed immediately at the end each Administration.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Tom, do understand that ALL of the judges you are getting any information through are part and parcel of the Deep State. When the Deep State wants to kill a lawsuit against the surveillance state, they play on both sides of the ball.
@ConeGalleryArts @YouTube Now, what did you expect from the left-leaning tech company? Seems that ALL os the social media companies all tried to help Clinton, #Google, #Twitter, #FaceBook, #MSMessenger, are you upset yet? They've been proving just how much advantage they'll take of your 1st A rights. https://t.co/tQvs8lSmBQ
@President45USA I have a sneaking hunch you were asked to fund the alternative media via Leader Technologies’ Miller Act Notice. Should you do this, you will be trapped for racketeering. BTW, Rod J.

@My2CentsGritXO Just think about who was President at that time. For the most part, DemocRATs despised the military.  While I was in military service from 1963 - 1992 and recalled then got out in 1998, but I was located overseas for over 11.5-years neither the Navy nor Army let me off CONUS.

@AP_PATRIOT Mr. Cheney, while he is mad about not being in power, needs to remember that he's part of the SWAMP in DC.

Think about it HE didn't do nothing in 8 years, like Mudd. https://t.co/tDvwCqxroG
@Sheckyi These three individuals deserve PRISON a job ending term especially for two of them. They are almost the worst group of high-level FBI employees.

@rob845 The Ex-President doesn't remember that he stopped help from getting to those asking for help. By doing that he furthered his belief in the Quran which allowed him to do just that.

@JohnOppido @RedNationRising As a 73-year-old, I've had experiences on both sides of the political ball.

@TheMarkPantano He's a lawyer, he needs to be disbarred because of his actions. He knows better but doesn't care about that which he's done. He says he'll go up against expulsion for what he'd done. My immediate thought is he broke rules and needs to be in JAIL. He can think about his way out. https://t.co/ClpIm86zuF
@TheMarkPantano Seems that Sen. Cory Booker isn't afraid of the Senate Rules,, and would prefer to go to jail for breaking the law. Let him break it and throw the fool in jail. That might seem harsh, but I haven't seen anything he's done for the underprivileged other than making them dependent. https://t.co/mAkEUnSOcM
@Spence_74 @JANETCANARY @Thomas1774Paine Yes, I being an American Veteran well trained in weapons of all types. That is after my Father had already trained me at the age of 7, at 8, I was rated Expert by the NRA. As a vet with 28 years, I'm well versed in weapons. That doesn't mean I carry them openly exception of hands
@MaresForAmerica Seems that Sen. Cory Booker isn't afraid of the Senate Rules,, and would prefer to go to jail for breaking the law. Let him break it and throw the fool in jail.

@Spence_74 @JANETCANARY @Thomas1774Paine An Australian gun lover debunks some myths. ... the conservative Australian government introduced a series of stringent new gun laws. .... One big difference is that in Australia, we think owning a gun is a privilege.
@BreitbartNews On the other hand, Mr. Gutierrez you might consider resigning yourself. You don't do anything to help the underprivileged except keep them dependent on the government for a handout. YOU and ALL of YOUR LIBERAL FRIENDS NEED TO RESIGN FOR LYING TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. https://t.co/Gsdf8UZWGg

@lonestarmango @popstherock33 @gatewaypundit Not surprising, Schumer, Feinstein, Booker, Pelosi are behind this crap. Saw where Chuck Schumer was asking for folks to protest.

@darsavmo I haven't worn Levi's jeans for over 7 years. Wrangler jeans fit better and are more comfortable, and they cost about 1/3 what Levi's is charging for the same thing.
I just tried to share that recipe with your force. Now you get to spread it around. BTW, do you know Ron Pratt Midwest Truck, in Scott City?
@Thomas1774Paine Ms, Feinstein need to understand that removing guns from law abiding citizens will; do nothing about stopping shootings, The ONLY thing that will is a thorough Universal background check a 3 to 7 day waiting period. But don't be fooled the Dems want the 2nd Amendment removed. https://t.co/9PRBFYXnMe
@RedNationRising Can't call it TREASON, we aren't at war with him, but it can be called a hate crime. Since most media outlets are pushing the left's agenda, it's surprising that this knucklehead rammed his truck into the TV Station.  But that also shows you how much he knows about them.

Something he won't do because anything given to him is his. That is how stingy he is with what he calls his, to heck with those who are in need.
@Jim_Jordan Want to put a stop to Mueller? Remove his and anyone else's SECURITY CLEARANCES. Now he'll have a real problem. The main one being, that the information requires a Security Clearance. With none of them having one, he's done.
@PatrioticVa @chuckschumer @gatewaypundit Now, could that be called SEDITION? Working against the US in all cases can also be called a treasonous act,, but it isn't done in the time of war. Yeah, I know, we aren't at war, but that doesn't eliminate SEDITION at all But go after all involved with him, they are guilty too.
@WEARAllenStrum 62-year old flat layout home. There is 11" of concrete on the floor, then the rat sill. Yup the floor had to be over poured because of a mistake on the builder thinking the floor would be like the rest, not reading the prints. Plaster walls, 16"centers tongue, and groove roofing.
@WEARAllenStrum In case you are wondering I have WUWF up and running 24/7/365. Its just high enough to hear it in the background but those alerts are enough to let you know somethings up. NWS needs to understand groundwater levels start at 4 to 7 feet in NW FL. No basements here
@WEARAllenStrum Tornado spotted North of Milton in Pea Ridge  NNE areas of Santa Rosa County till 1045 PM Central Time, by NOAA.
@WEARAllenStrum Should have a good radio station up and running that is if your TV hasn't lost its power. Last I heard tornado warnings for Pea Ridge, and Holt mostly North Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties. Flood warnings were given out for low lying areas and streams. Let's me out both ways.
@DemolitionRanch An engine is a nice thing but defending what you have just might hold a higher priority, but instead of a hatch why not a turret mounted gun. More protection for the person having to use it.
@OldKid56 @RedNationRising You can thank in most part the DemocRATs for that. They push liberal agendas, saying that they are going to help the underprivileged all the while keeping them impoverished and dependent on their doles from the Federal Govt. They don't want to help at all that how to keep voters. https://t.co/fYmy8kUXT1
@GovMikeHuckabee He needed to go when he wasn't honest when he took the job. That was inexcusable. He should have been honest, but that would not have helped the Deep State which he is really part of. He's entrenched in their rhetoric, doesn't see how wrong it is, knows Rosenstein is with him. https://t.co/GjRYcXgq9r
@RedNationRising He's a Constitutional lawyer, what does she expect. Her problem is she is so far out of touch with truth and right. She's so far to the left, she doesn't want their status broken down. When they have leftist judges who don't use the Constitution as a basis for their rulings.
@mcb1673 @Thomas1774Paine That's your right, don't expect me, as a vet with 28 years, to feel the same way as you do. I do some backgrounds on those I make replies to. As a lawyer, you ought to know that is isn't illegal to state one's feelings even if you happen to be the POTUS. Saying so is BS.
@mcb1673 @Thomas1774Paine @realDonaldTrump hasn't made crimes, what he has done was to show the world exactly how corrupt and deceitful the opposing side was. Now, if you happen to be part of that crowd who has been learning how to clam up, then you are barking up the wrong tree.
@poconomtn @sandboxsquid Truer words have now been respoken again. I knew about that while I was attached on the USNS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 1963-76 in one location. FTG; NCID and 9 months with the Marines giving them advanced weapons training. DADT CWO-3 Navy, 28-years.
@Thomas1774Paine They were also picking a fight with our President over his ire of NFL's disrespect of the American Flag. The Director of the film saw nothing wrong with it, but he's a mad DemocRAT. Trying to pull a Colen Kaepernick. Wrong place and time. Watch what happens when you get Vets mad.
@HyltonRobin Never in the Right Size, get a 1/2 size larger it'll work. well, it doesn't fit correctly when that is done. Doing that hurts the user's feet but they don't care a flying fig about correct fit unless it's an expensive NFL client like Kaepernick. That's why I won't support NIKE. https://t.co/TZWCEgSTae
@Champenoise46 @Thomas1774Paine Think Colen Kaepernick and his kneeling. Even the Director was for leaving the flag out of the information. Knowing where Damien Chazelle (the director) is from helps understanding he's a mad DemocRAT, a chop at @realDonaldTrump using the picture.
@retireleo @mflynnJR The old adage "Like Father, Like Son." doesn't hold with this ungrateful sibling, Sarge. One of these days when he needs someone to vouch for him he might find it hard to get. His Dad, you, myself are patriots for our service. What has he done? Most likely nothing.
@Thomas1774Paine Past time to go, but might have to wait until Trey Gowdy has left the Congress before we see what is going to be up with him.
@Thomas1774Paine She's the typical DemocRAT saying whatever sounds good. She doesn't have the foggiest idea of what it really is.

That's not on their agenda, and maybe someone had better set their heads on straight let them see the bigger picture. Being a RAT means they can be eradicated. https://t.co/63UImQ1DDf
@JudicialWatch Unless you have gotten Mrs. Rosenstein [Lisa H. Barsoomian] the CIA Agent from BLOCKING ALL FOIA requests, you are screwed. Don't be fooled into thinking she's going to allow any looking into any part of the DOJ for an instant. As long as she's in place, she'll block ALL requests
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump My information was verified thri=ough Patriots for Truth. This might explain why you are having problems. Rosenstein is conflicted in more ways than one, and @realDonaldTrump doesn't see it. Rosenstein should have recused himself but didn't. So he deserves REMOVAL as does she.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump So Rod Rosenstein's wife is BLOCKING ALL FOIA REQUESTS. So you are going to have to go after her first and depose her so all of your requests can go through. She's the answer to your problems with FOIA REQUESTS. Tom.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Why Lisa Barsoomian, is involved in hundreds of cases representing the DC Office of the US Attorney her email addy. Lisa Barsoomian at NIH gov. This is a tactic routinely used by the CIA to protect an operative by using another government organization to shield their activities
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Smells of a coverup if you asked me. How pray tell do you lose backups without destroying them? then again think  Lisa Barsoomian has specialized in opposing the Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of the intelligence community. Rod Rosenstein's wife is blocking all. https://t.co/hl2I1dgAZc
@Soy_Eleazar @AngeloRayGomez I just sent a picture of a Mexican Voter ID Card to the DNC and asked them if I saw something wrong here, or were they so STUPID and stuck in the mud to realize what a good idea this is. They require it to VOTE why not us? https://t.co/eCgNtuzvUm
@DNC Something for you to think on really hard, Mexico requires an ID to VOTE, so why are you against it? Here's a shot of an actual Mexican ID CARD. Did I see something wrong here or are you so STUPID and stuck in the mud that an ID CARD FOR ALL VOTERS MAKES GOOD SENSE. https://t.co/HcTleiVC8p
@Kodiakbear911 @grizzlemeister How true. 	Although my casket, cemetery plot, headstone were prepaid about 28 years ago. The only costs at that point will be the church service and engraving of the DOB and DOD. I get a full military sendoff as well. I volunteered in '63 CWO-3 28 yrs. active service.
@Thomas1774Paine May they find a hole to keep him in so that he can't do anything while he's in prison. Just because someone happens to be in their vicinity doesn't mean that they have to die.
@Steve4Trump A Devastating Sentence would have been the full term of 10 years in a Maximum Security Prison. She got off with a slap on the wrist, and 3 years of supervised release. Gee, once a month visit your parole officer and report in. The guy I caught got 47 years in Leavenworth in '70.
@grizzlemeister What a knucklehead, the government doesn't pay for funerals the relatives of the person who has died do. If she doesn't know that then WHAT PLANET DID SHE COME FROM, MARS? She needs to visit Venezuela and get Mr. Mudro to let her know socialism FAILED. https://t.co/lmPks9egCs
@AngeloRayGomez All except the DemocRATs in Congress, because it doesn't fit their agenda. They don't care about a person who is murdered by an illegal, this ought to be a WAKE-UP CALL. Remember Mollie when you vote those RATS back into office. Then her blood can be on your hands as well. https://t.co/oMipFahjzh
@darsavmo Pocohantis needs to think before she puts her foot in it. Rather than change the subject making folks in Iowa MAD at her attitude. That is almost the most inconsiderate thing I've seen, other than a pastor asking me what I was doing at Mom's church to let them know she'd passed. https://t.co/CHkyCzj9LD
@stephphilip8 Just stop and think for a minute, Mr. Brennan. You didn't need that assessment had your agencies stood up to Obama's weaponizing them. The CIA doesn't spy inside the USA, PERIOD. That's up to the FBI, not your agency. You were to STUPID to see what was happening around you. https://t.co/540suUU1tq
@TomFitton @DMRegister Had they been enrolled in the E-VERIFY program it would have been evident immediately. The farms who use anyone who comes looking for work, and don't bother to check is as GUILTY of the CRIME as the perpetrator is. All Farms not on E-VERIFY need an unannounced visit from ICE.
@MichaelDelauzon It was set for when it would do the MOST DAMAGE against the @POTUS. Sometimes you have to think like your opponent does. If it had been put out 4 months early it wouldn't have had the impact that it did yesterday. Think Dirty Tricks Mueller, it's how he gets convictions. https://t.co/USjlqvCSJM
@dcexaminer Sometimes it seems to me that it would serve the paper to be NEUTRAL referee rather than an opponent where you can put up all of your commentary and call it NEWS. Getting both sides of the subject gives the people a truer view on the subject. And you wonder why you are FAKE NEWS. https://t.co/hdj5G62vWV
@RealJamesWoods This is where ICE strikes next and to ALL farms that aren't on the E-Verify system.  Yes, the farmer can be gotten for hiring an illegal alien, but there is no REAL PENALTY for doing what they did. It's a shame they should be held for accessory to murder, which is they are. https://t.co/RJKApywAWi

@Thomas1774Paine Hopefully, their left-leaning head-shed can try to reverse their BLATANT STUPID WAYS, but I for one doubt it.

@1GigiSims @jack @delbius @POTUS @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz @SenTedCruz @HouseGOP @GaetaSusan @thebradfordfile @SKYRIDER4538 Awe come on, you should know for a fact that ALL of the Social Media Sites are left-leaning.

@m1goblu @RealCandaceO @gehrig38 It's a shame that Iowa doesn't have a gallows which the immigrant can see every morning and all day outside his window. That might give him something to look forward too, a death penalty which he deserves.
@bbusa617 Almost sounds like they have all converted to the Muslim faith, because the Quran allows them to LIE, CHEAT, STEAL, and MURDER. But I found them something that they can use and it won't cost them all that much. Now when you look at it chuckle. https://t.co/F24BJTJwny

@darsavmo Figures that is how those DemocRATs keep people voting for them. They don't help them better their conditions, because it isn't in their best interests. https://t.co/w0QQTmWU4g
@realDonaldTrump Former CIA director John Brennan personally green-lit the 9/11 hijackers entry into the US after being informed of “potential terror concerns.” “Mr. Brennan did convert to Islam when he served in an official capacity on  the behalf of the United States in Saudi Arabia.”
@conserv44110594 But Meuller has a reputation for holding information back from defenses, his attorneys will do anything (even illegal) to get a conviction.

@Sheckyi Well, if she and her DemocRAT friends had their way, none of the legal gun owners would have guns.

I'll keep my guns safe, no children here. https://t.co/YQvr85oUsW
@realDonaldTrump “The real question that we need to find out from Mr. Ohr: Was he just a rogue employee. Ohr, formerly the associate deputy attorney general, was demoted after it came to light he met with Steele and Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, afraid they will be exposed.”
@gaye_gallops Now look at whom she worked for and then ask why not spy on opposing political party's. She didn't care that it wasn't legal. Ex-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates is poised to become the next top Justice Department official of the Obama administration scrutinized.
@AnthemRespect @politico During Obamas Admin, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper questioned the booming rolls of security-clearance holders. At last count, more than 4.9 million people held clearances, of whom over 1.4 million were cleared for access at the “Top Secret” level. Mudd you MAD?
@DemolitionRanch The best policy is to be upfront with her, stop trying to be sneaky, cause it'll end up blowing up in your face.  Here's mud in your eyes should you not be honest with her.

I stir pots as well, the last one I got to was Trump hating Phillip Mudd, EX-CIA and FBI now CNN screw up. I asked if he knew Brennan had converted to the Muslim faith before Congress approved him. The Quran allows him to LIE STEAL CHEAT KILL

@RoguePhilMudd Your bias sits out on your sleeve like a sore thumb. But let me ask you a simple question. Are you aware that John Brennan had converted to the Muslim faith before he became CIA Director? If not, why not? The Quran says he can LIE STEAL MURDER without punishment.
@MAGAALLTHEWAY @gatewaypundit Well, then their analogy is mess up from the get-go.  It would be more meaningful if they said front door since they are letting their liberalism show right out front. #1 You can't be gender neutral are not trying to offend the man who hasn't done gender surgery.
@FlaCracker35 Not when you realize the Feds were involved in it. Had you seen the video about what was left behind, some of the stuff isn't available to ordinary citizens. Better start looking into the FBI/CIA folks who were in on that camps destruction. But they left the evidence, clumsy.
@aseegs3 A few weeks before the Senate voted to confirm Brennan as CIA director, former FBI agent John Guandolo revealed that Brennan had, indeed, converted to Wahhabist Islam while he was CIA station chief in Riyadh.	According to the Quran, he's allowed to lie, cheat, steal, kill. https://t.co/4oQCzXA3L3
@Thomas1774Paine This person is supposed to an educated pastor, and he botches the word "respect". Makes me wonder how he got through English classes. I was in my Senior year of high school getting ready to graduate from HS and 8 weeks later graduate from college as well with a Theology Degree.
@DevinSavageOfcl Those you listed are Conservatives and for the most part Republicans. We need to UNITE that is unless you want those DemocRATs repealing the Tax Cuts.

But I can say from my investigations and those of my Intel folks, the Clinton campaign was deeply involved with Russa. Also, it was the Chinese, Indian +Pakistanis who hacked her system.
@Thomas1774Paine Oh yes, he is, he's upset still that Hillary lost. After all, he's one who started spying on the Trump Campaign. Had she won, "We the People" wouldn't have known about any of the crap they were pulling by weaponizing our intel agencies. The shame is that now he's vilifying Trump. https://t.co/T9Z5YWUEnC

@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Brennan needs to start looking at his past transgressions and start truly figuring out how to make them right, especially that Muslim video after the attack in Benghazi killed a US ambassador.

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Brennan thinks dirty fighting is fine, lying to Congress is OK, removing a persons security clearance because he would not go along with the lie about a Muslim Vidoe, his instigating the @POTUS spying was ok. Now he's been caught and he's upset. But he needs to be mad at himself. https://t.co/Kz2s1VF3DW
@bbusa617 Mr. Brennan needs to think Muslim Video, the lying to Congress, making false misleading retorts all the while knowing that the unverified "Dossier" was used to spy on an opposition party. He can't tell the truth, so he doesn't deserve the security clearance. Use it for good only. https://t.co/j9UCZ7oJks
@PamelaUnplugged John have you ever heard what goes around comes around. Well, your "Muslim Video" story just caught up with you because some people are honest and you weren't.

@darsavmo 6 of the Biggest TAX CHEATS in the DemocRAT Party,, there are most likely a few more to go with them but who is counting.
@Mike_Press19 The Bible prohibits all kinds of sexual promiscuity – heterosexual as well as homosexual. There is nowhere in scripture that says homosexuality is ok in God's eye it is just the opposite. So faiths that are allowing this abomination are going against GOD.
@Mike_Press19 "From the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh..." (Mark 10:6-8, quoting Genesis 2:24). .

@C_3C_3 It seems that Brennan and Clapper's nooses are starting to grow slightly tighter. Clapper had better find a place to hide, but his security clearance is going to disappear for the reason he weaponized CIA to do illegal operations inside the country. https://t.co/zfJpWyBzW1

@OliverMcGee @FBI @petestrzok @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Let's make sure that he is unable to get his Federal retirement which he's most likely going to try to get.

@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson He doesn't have a RIGHT to a security clearance, that is up to each incoming administration. I just stepped on someone's toes, but it is the truth.

@kwilli1046 Well if every COP who is at the game and supposed to guard these overpaid spoiled brats would do what the Cops in Philly did they just might have second thoughts. COPS have a 1st A right as well. The NFL had a sleep in the locker room since their protection left them in protest.
@Thomas1774Paine It would seem that Bruce Ohr needs to be on the end of one of John Brennan's Extreme Rendition Questioning sessions, he might not sing or compose very well.

@SheriffClarke @NFL @realDonaldTrump @RedNationRising @JoeTalkShow @BreitbartNews @AmericaFirstPAC But this should have been done last year too.

@gregory_cerge Brennan used an unverified "Dossier" to start an investigation into an opposition candidate. That is WEAPONIZING our intelligence agencies for something that they aren't supposed to be doing. The CIA isn't allowed to spy internally in the U.S., and he knew that but did it anyway. https://t.co/aDUhaw0FFm
@JohnBrennan So you used the "Dossier", in that you relied upon this unverified document to start an investigation into the Trump campaign? If so, especially after you found out that this was an Opposition Research Document, did you continue to use it. You prove you didn't.
@DianeStuffer Oh and if you are wondering where I got my information: 	Sources Business Insider; Mother Jones; American Urban Radio Networks;  The Washington Post; The New York Times; and CNN. Happy now?
@DianeStuffer April Ryan happens to be a reporter, you are thinking about Paul Ryan and I agree with you on that. since his wife is a DemocRAT he doesn't want to shake her up too much.
@KamVTV Now that ought to tell you something about Maxine,, she doesn't give a flying flip about the citizens of this country. Now she needs to go to a pit and given a spoon and told to eat her way out. https://t.co/dkUOyWUdiW
@DianeStuffer She had heated exchanges people, including April Ryan, a veteran White House correspondent.  During a testy exchange with Omarosa near the Oval Office, Ryan said she felt "physically intimidated" by her. "She stood right in my face like she was going to hit me," Ryan said.
@DianeStuffer She might wish that there wasn't as much in print on her actions as there is. And if she did sign a non-disclosure notice while she was at the WH, she might like to rethink her position. https://t.co/GbslfdXIDr
@kevinh07 So don't go telling me the Trump is the only one to have removed security clearances. It's happened before and it will continue for the time being. As for Mr. Brennan, had he not used it to maj=ke money off of rather than give useful info to those taking over he'd have been fine.
@bowhunter_va @WSJ He's a pretty fair BULL-SHIT ARTIST as well. Seems that Lisa threw him under the bus though. She doesn't want to lose her law license, while Strzsok doesn't seem to care about it. I wonder if he has problems laying down at night for all of the lying he's been doing lately. https://t.co/PWtujMobE2

@Thomas1774Paine The judge who ordered this release is either STUPID OF HAS BEEN BOUGHT. Someone had better look into the judge's finances and his prior judgments on this kind of activity.
@Thomas1774Paine If his wife had half a brain she'd divorce him and take everything with her. Leave him with nothing but the shirt on his back. He's an overblown IDIOT who seems to think he's bigger than everyone around him. So he's the weasel among the RATS. https://t.co/hkgh2mbnj0
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog If  @POTUS doesn't want to be caught in a lie then he'd better stop lying either verbally or on Twitter, because it will come back to haunt him. You want to know how Mueller will get him @realDonaldTrump  has put it out for all to see. Your enemies aren't as stupid as you think.
@BreitbartNews How do you do anything in the Whitehouse since you NO LONGER WORK THERE?  As she was told earlier LAWYER UP YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IT.
@1776Covpepe @LizCrokin I'd be willing to put him on a plane with just enough fuel to get him to GITMO. Then his Muslim friends can figure out how to rescue him. They ought to be able to do that for him. He'd have been a good President had he not tried to ruin this country at every turn.
@BreitbartNews Now I want you to think what would have happened if Hillary and Bill had had an abortion on Chelsea's fetus. One less liberal JACKASS spreading crap
@BreitbartNews Now, do you really think he'd admit to being inebriated on an airline flight? This was a means for him to build up the courage to get on a flight at all. Actually, he's lucky he didn't get arrested for public drunkenness.
@darsavmo Yup free to buy from him till screws you. Just remember that he's been taking back countries that used to be under the old Soviet Union, so don't be naive and think he's going to help the FREE WORLD. As for Wiki and Google, they are for the LEFT, not the US.
@moniquesourdif @LizCrokin @realDonaldTrump No Kidding, but now he's gone a step further and committed TREASON against the US by forming a shadow government.
@conserv44110594 Nancy Knumbnuts Pelosi has been making STUPID COMMENTS AND DRIVING MORE TO WALK AWAY. W2G Nancy when they figure out that you are only using them as talking points, you might lose your JOB as well. https://t.co/SLrUUW3MS2

@Thomas1774Paine She did something wrong, she didn't care, she was caught and terminated. Now the little Socialist gal up in New York is taking advantage of her bad behavior and making her pay for it even more. What a shame that she couldn't use her GOD given brains for good, instead of spying.
@LizCrokin Don't forget that Obama also was working behind your back. I do believe with his making deals with other countries Governments is against the law and he's committing Treason. He deserves an Eastern-looking cell in GITMO.
@ClaraLKatzenmai He just might, but he'd better think about [Melissa Hodgman] his wife's blocking ALL investigations into the Clintons through her position as the deputy director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division. She could lose her job as well.
I just tried to share that recipe with your force. Now you get to spread it around. BTW, do you know Ron Pratt Midwest Truck, in Scott City?
Dialysis took its toll on me today.
@Golfinggary5222 Let's complete the circle and remove his wife Melissa Hodgman who was promoted to deputy director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division. She needs to be removed and arrested for obstruction of justice. Blocking ALL FBI Investigations into the Clintons. https://t.co/jEDzFyWhHf
@Thomas1774Paine That seems about right Since @jeffsessions was in the Senate and was briefed on the Uranium One Crap, but I doubt that he bothered to tell @realDonaldTrump @POTUS anything about that. Putting them into that position was like keeping the SWAMP in place to work against him.
@Thomas1774Paine Ah, it just might the members of the FBI and DOJ doing it and trying to frame him for doing it. Since everyone is watching him all of the time it would be hard for him to do anything without being seen. Awe heck, there goes your conspiracy theory. Try, try again. IDIOTS
@poconomtn Uranium One was over and basically done with back in 2010. Now, remember Mueller delivered the sample of Uranium to Russia, Now here's your Russian collusion, but you know Mueller isn't going to investigate his STUPIDITY. What a group of RATS in this group. https://t.co/2kf6YT3sM4
@CBPSanDiego I don't care that people came into the country illegally, but what irks me is that you are Kidnapping the children and not giving them back to their parents when you DEPORT THEM. Got news for you KIDNAPPING isn't legal, and that is what you've done.
@Thomas1774Paine As soon as you keep the children, you BROKE THE LAW, it's called Kidnapping. You are going to hard pressed to prove otherwise. Yeah, I know the parent came into the country illegally, But your removing the children is a form of KIDNAPPING so you're responsibility return them.
@realDonaldTrump While you are remembering Strzok, remember also his wife, Melissa Hodgman, who blocked ALL investigations into ANYTHING Clinton. She .was promoted to deputy director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division.	My sources: True Pundit and Devlin Barrett WSJ
@Thomas1774Paine Hold on thar Nancy, they are being bought and paid for by George Soros. So now you are going against him as well? After all, he's paying ALL of the DemocRATs so they can run against Republicans https://t.co/8yUijI777b
@Thomas1774Paine Now, what did you expect in one of the deadliest cities in this country? Now the other thing to keep in mind is that ALL of them are under DemocRAT control. Hmm, now the bell is starting to ring. They are TAX and SPEND themselves into oblivion and expect someone else to fix it.
@C_3C_3 I have just the place for her ilk it's dark, damp all of the time and dank. It's also very smelly, but she shouldn't mind that since she's had her head in the sewer most of the time.  Bruce, on the other hand, need to go to the Federal Prison at Leavenworth for at least 60 years. https://t.co/a4urdkNtlH
@Thomas1774Paine What a crock of CRAP THESE IDIOTS CAME OUT WITH.  It seems that no player can face reproach for offending the fans — the ones who pay their salaries, in case we’d all forgotten — lest we violate the Eleventy-Sixth Amendment. AS FANS WE CAN DEMAND OUR MONEY BACK FOR TICKETS.
@pinballkev @SaraCarterDC @POTUS Yup, I am. Melissa Hodgman was promoted to deputy director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division literally hours after Strzok and FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe were debriefed about the Clinton emails found on Weiner’s computer. Source True Pundit.
@SaraCarterDC They have missed, they didn't remove Melissa Hodgman [Strzok's wife] who became appointed to a high level in the SEC. Thereby blocking any investigation into anything Clinton. Remove one, remove the other as well NOW. She's still working against the @POTUS. So when is her time? https://t.co/KIcxzeFyI8

@EdmundHulton But the DemocRAT Party went even further than that, the KKK, Jim Crow, oh and have they helped the minorities out of poverty,  or have they kept them subservient to them.

@darsavmo https://t.co/XGIcbeyJ9R
@NancyPelosi While illegals might give you what you call "leverage", but you also have to understand they ARE NOT CITIZENS they HAVE NO RIGHTS, no matter how you try to work it.

@Trancy9 @BreitbartNews @POTUS Oh, yeah, taking the DOJ and FBI and making it an arm of the Executive Branch. Ran the Federal deficit to over 13 Trillion dollars. Destroyed small businesses ran work overseas making our labor force become even larger. Obama Care which ballooned. Helped the poor become poorer. https://t.co/MIVhgWQI3m
@Trancy9 @BreitbartNews Kasich is a Republican from Ohio, what I did was to point out that Obama did the same thing and the LEFT kept their mouths quiet. But when @POTUS did it they screamed bloody murder. It also shows their hypocrisy in the matter. I know we aren't supposed to remember that Obama did.
@TheRealMaddog58 @KayaJones @seanhannity @FoxNews @dbongino @foxandfriends @skb_sara @adjunctprofessr @SarahPalinUSA @larryelder @LouDobbs True he did know and they wouldn't pay close attention to exactly what he was saying.

Open your eyes who has really helped you. https://t.co/n2cgMSJy83
@BreitbartNews Ah, Mr. Kasich doesn't remember that Barack Obama did the same thing and the Left Never Said A Thing About that. Is there a DOUBLE STANDARD HERE?

@marklevinshow States of MA and NY would love to get to Mueller for his prosecutorial misconduct. But his thoughts were as long as I get a conviction it doesn't matter how it was done. Mueller has been a BAD COP for a long time. How good was Mueller, as a Marine prosecutor? https://t.co/Vd5uGx8xcy

That got the judges ire.
@RedNationRising No, they aren't, think how many times you have to prove who you are and then, why can't election officials know who you are.

@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton BTW, I'm 73 and the last knee operation was done in 1992. So those exercises have helped and no knee replacements either. Like I mentioned God has something he wants me to do so I might find out what it is. Or it could be from something I have said. Either way, the Lord is in it.
@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton I do exercises to strengthen the muscles around the neck and the knees. Try knee bends with 600 pounds on the machine and then only rock it using the ankles in repetitions of 10 per leg. Butterfly with 250 pounds standing on a rod below the balls of my feet, no shock in knees.
@BogartPete You want to blame someone, try KAEPERNICK started this mess. Over a year ago. But the lemmings in the league followed his lead and you lost sponsors and fans. https://t.co/xxOhgSUwgP
@seanhannity Think about it, they don't want to have those emails point fingers at them. While they think they can obstruct anyone using FOIA documents. They'll drag their feet as long as they can until they are drug before a fed-up Federal Judge. Remember the FBI has LIED. https://t.co/SxH4hqoBpq
@Thomas1774Paine His problem is he's been around Maxine Waters too much. Secondly, he hasn't had his pablum formula lately. He really doesn't feel safe unless he has all of those DemocRATS around to protect him. But his potty mouth puts him in the in a pit under the outhouse. Smelly down there. https://t.co/4J0GFSuRrg
@RedNationRising Are we sure that Mark Zuckerberg isn't Antifa, really? Only removing conservatives views isn't a good choice. But it does if you are in the back pockets of the DmeocRATS.

@Thomas1774Paine She'll have to take a DNA test. IT'll do two things, 1 will prove she's right or 2 prove she's a liar and shouldn't be trusted by anyone.

@Thomas1774Paine Got to love Judge Ellis he has Mueller's team right where he wants them, in the crosshairs. The trial had been expected to last three weeks. But Ellis surprised the courtroom late Wednesday when he said, "I’m hoping to finish this case much sooner than anyone predicted.”
@LadyRedWave Sen.

@1ChanceDiamond They don't need them and are openly belittling your administration. Well, that demands a reprisal and we know they don't like the idea of losing it, so let them learn a hard lesson.

@Thomas1774Paine But what you call objectionable might not be to others.  That can be a slippery slope because you get a DemocRAT not liking what a RepublICAN is saying and Vise Versa. So the responsible thing to do children is to suck it up and take it even though you don't it.
@Thomas1774Paine Mexifornia not California with the Ultra Liberal Pelosi and Feinstein having their way. And their saying Sanctuary City is a bunch of crap Those aren't sanctuaries it is harboring fugitives since these people are wanted for crimes and deportation. https://t.co/mxsrM8H1pK
@PolAlwaysRight You might think so but anyone who calls for the killing of ALL police, White men, women, isn't all there.

@EdmundHulton How true, but he's also trying that against Mueller and it's not working especially since Liberal Judges are upholding his appointment as a Special Council. Despite the idea that Rod Rosenstein expanded his capabilities getting away from a Russia Probe. The expansion isn't legal.
@rback21 You must be within the past few years as a vet. I'm from the Viet-Nam era, with 28 years. We paid an awful price so that you CHILDREN [and some younger vets] have that right. It's a shame that your spelling doesn't live up your right to protest. I got a BA in '63 and an MA in'96.
@KamalaHarris Kamala what do you do about the SCOTUS ruling about alien rights, since they said they HAVE NONE HERE.

@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Rosenstein should have known not to trust Mueller of those he has working for him. But, we've known the fix was in long ago. You should have thought heavily since you broadened Mueller's original probe. But you wanted @POTUS gone. Now it's haunting you. https://t.co/T4J5qwZaL4

@Thomas1774Paine And Rosenstein LIED to Congress to cover his own butt. Now he needs to worry about the HONEST FBI and other ALPHABET agencies telling that Mueller has fabricated evidence.

@RepMattGaetz Impeached, impossible! He hasn't done anything, he has been obstructionist, slow-walked paperwork, has been in BREECH of CONGRESS which isn't impeachable. The only persons who can fire him are Sessions and the @POTUS. You're powerless to impeach look it up.
@RepAdamSchiff Adam, you keep saying that you have proof that @POTUS was in collusion with Russia. Well, I'll tell you what if you don't start showing this proof, it'll show you as a BLOWHARD LIAR. But you are also a Major leaker especially when things were not to be released. https://t.co/3PTEHRdf8v
@darkwriter @Chillhill1 @SavingAmerica4U Ah, you aren't aware that Disney bought Fox and that they are now MSM. I do wish you'd keep up with what has been happening within the past week-and-a-half. Yet @POTUS wants Fox for Air Force 1 ONLY. As for reporters they still need to be polite, otherwise bye bye https://t.co/8Dnu2VQsEM
@RedNationRising @realDonaldTrump @RepKevinYoder Ah but Rep. Yoder doesn't care about the Trump immigration agenda. I'm really not too sure that Rep. Yoder isn't a DemocRAT posing as a Republican. Best check to see how he's voted on other items related to immigration. https://t.co/XhXsQEy1AS

@darkwriter @Chillhill1 @SavingAmerica4U Awe it's a shame you weren't aware that Carter Page was working for the FBI. Flynn made a call to the Russian Ambassador in Obama's office with his permission, why didn't you know that? Manafort and Gates were years before joining the Trump team. Jeff Sessions is DEEP STATE.

@Terri77964718 @RenoNVSparky @The2016People @bbusa617 @POTUS Then go after the person who initiated this sham in the first place. You know the "one" who said he wanted to know everything that was happening. Do you remember him? Obama. He's the reason the wiretaps were made against an opposition party. Where's my delusion?
@RedNationRising Arrest the entire group. Start fines at $10,000 for the leaders going down to $5000 for each person thereafter. They'll go broke trying to pay the fines and then there are the court costs to be added to each person. If they refuse to pay term plus a day is a good policy.
@PascoSheriff Something to think about, the cat you showed was cute, true. But two of mine can sneak ing the dark and not be seen easily.

@CLiberty4 @SavingAmerica4U If Acosta acts like a SPOILED BRAT, then let him be treated like one. In fact, he needs to be booted from the WH pool and then have CNN re-apply to have him reinstated.

@Breaking911 The White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. No signature they aren't allowed into the room until they sign the paperwork."If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." Trump not first see Obama
@Thomas1774Paine If they don't comply, Impeach the both of them. Rosenstein is beholding to his mentors Mueller and Comey, as is his wife who works for the CIA.

@SavingAmerica4U So Trump's removing a reporter during the past year wasn't the first President to do so. But the MSM couldn't remember that since it happened under Obamas watch. Oops, caught you in your lie. Find another way to say what happened didn't under Obama. https://t.co/ZN3piAGA2p

@KatTheHammer1 But how else are they going to get all of these newly minted "citizens" to vote for them? Do note, I put quotes around citizens.

@RepMattGaetz @Twitter @BreitbartNews They certainly do because I've inputted a name I'd done 3 days before they come back as not found. Later that same day I see the person I was looking for online. So that isn't shadowbanning then what is, Doing it to Republicans and conservatives just shows how far left they are.

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Not any of the answers below, nor any to come out yet.

It's a shame that some of our Liberal DemocRAT members don't understand that they to can be fined, jailed or both for enabling others to desecrate the U.S. Flag. Of course, I should have to remind them of this penalty they should know it. But acting like its spontaneous is CRAP. https://t.co/By29ucMjPY
@SenWarren Are you familiar with U.S. Code 18-700 Sen Warren? If you say no then you are trying to incite others to do FLAG DESECRATION. Which cites: Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces physically defiles, burns, etc. shall be fined under this title or jailed for 1 year or both. https://t.co/FcjJLA9tmK
@perfectsliders You need to fire Melissa Hodgman [strzok's wife]. Hodgman was promoted to deputy director of the SEC, she was instrumental in preventing Bill and Hillary Clinton from having to serve jail time for their numerous crimes.

He broke his oath when he went and joined MSM and got paid. Here's something you don't know. John Owen Brennan was born in Texas. Worked for both Bush and Obama Admins. Registered Independent. Revoke Security
@luvnColo Got news for you, while I dislike the idea that John Brennan has used his security Clearance to make money after having been in the Obama Admin. I also happen to know he's a Texan and an independent. He worked for the Bush Admin first before Obama. His clearance needs Revokation.
@SpeakerRyan Are you trying to be STUPID? Do you think that Obama Admin. officials who are using their Security Clearances to make money should keep them, really? The answer should be NO. Both Brennan and Clapper are on NBC and MSNBC, REVOKE their Security Clearances NOW!!!
@USPatriotB Obama tried it for 8-years and he was a grand failure.  Had people elected him for what he knew and not his color, he'd never have been elected in the first place.

@herbert_hays Sounds about right Promise them everything, but don't come through once they get voted in. https://t.co/8GMTKab61s
@JohnBrennan John you knnow exactly why your security clearance was withdrawn from you. You have told things that weren't supposed to be told, but you did. So there are two things that could have happened. 1. Arresting you or 2. revoking your clearance for breaking your oath.
@AngeleStar11 I'm glad he at least paid attention to something I'd mentioned about those members of the Obama Admin, I'd said ALL members of his Admin, needed to have their security clearances revoked as soon as they started broadcasting for MSM. They are working against @POTUS Admin not for.
@PatrioticCindy OH boy, Let's deport him as well as the illegals. Time for the wall to be built NOW!!
@Thomas1774Paine That's what happens when a parent company is part of the MSM. Now, they are part the other side and their reporters what they aren't allowed to do. And that's a shame because now you'll only get one view of the news. https://t.co/gHnZMFQP6F
@Gingrich_of_PA @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I recommended that ALL o the Obama Administration needed to have their Security Clearances revoked as a matter of security for the Trump Administration. They aren't working for you, but against. It should have been done the first time any of them joined any news organization.
@WebsitesByNancy According to FBI sources, Peter Strzok and his wife Melissa Hodgman were instrumental in preventing Bill and Hillary Clinton from having to serve jail time for their numerous crimes. Might have been a reason for his evil grin thinking he'd pulled the wool over our eyes.
@WebsitesByNancy Strzok’s wife [Melissa Hodgman] was promoted was promoted to deputy director of the SEC Enforcement Division literally hours after Strzok and FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe were debriefed about the Clinton emails found on Weiner’s computer. nd immediately blocked all criminal
@Scavino45 Instead of just putting him into Mexico, send him back home with a tracking chip inserted into him somewhere near his heart where he won't want to try and dig it out. that chip could lead you to the rest of the group. Don't tell me I don't think ahead.

This business of allowing opposition players to know what is going on has a way of destroying anything the current Administration is doing. Brennan is talking sour grapes,
@RenoNVSparky @The2016People @bbusa617 @POTUS Ahh, but it can with the removal of Rosenstein/wife for their COLLUSION between Mueller, and Comey whom he's beholding to. Then Jeff Sessions, who was given the wrong information from the get-go, does his job and removes Mueller. Rosenstein should have recused himself long ago.

@TheBadDadder @JohnKerry @EricHolder @realDonaldTrump His problem is that he still has his Security CLearance which should have been REVOKED upon the OBAMA Administration's leaving the White House. THere is NO EXCUSE for it not having been removed. Bu that entire Administration needed its Clearance revoked PERIOD.
@DrJszo6 Simple solution I made a Picture of the code. Read it and weep. https://t.co/jJVpPwue6E
@Thomas1774Paine Awe Mr. Kerry, Let's get you what you really need your security clearance revoked since you are not working for the current administration, as does Mr. Biden, Obama, Clapper, Brennan as well as anyone else tied to the Obama Administration.
@Thomas1774Paine Schiff the LEAKER in CHIEF for this committee and also leaked to the MSM the info that was supposed to be kept totally secret, and why he wasn't arrested each time he went out of the room is a good question.

@C_3C_3 This has been a Mueller tactic all along, and to heck with obeying the law as long as he gets his conviction.

@CheryL0000000 @bbusa617 @POTUS That's correct, with a few exceptions Like Clapper actually admitting that the entire thing was Obama's baby from the get-go. I still say all those who aren't currently employed in this administration DO NOT NEED THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCES IN PLACE WHAT-SO-EVER. That means removed
@angelatevis Well, the Petition to REMOVE Whoopie from ABC/DISNEY might not get far enough along unless it is addressed correctly. ABC is not the parent company, but Disney is.
@JacobAWohl No wonder he seemed so smug with his wife helping him. Now Congress will have to bring her in and grill her motives as well as his. She also ought to LOSE her job that is if she hasn't already. IT might wipe that grin off of his face. https://t.co/MlKNkAHng7
@Thomas1774Paine That was evident from the text messages between Strzok and Page. He wanted to be kept abreast of everything that was happening. But it's nice to get corroboration from another source close to the operation that was at hand. Clapper, on the other hand, could see the handwriting.

@FoxNews A naive idiot who doesn't know the differences between Fascism, Socialism, Communism, or Democracy. SOmeone needs to get her to first learn what each offers and realize Socialism leads to Communism, Obama proved Socialism doesn't work but the DemocRATS are BLIND FOOLS.
@FoxNews So this fool seems to think that her socialist crap wouldn't be for her as well as the rest of those who are willing to vote her in. She needs to go to North Korea or Viet-Nam to find out if this is what she wants. Asking her a question about what socialism does she doesn't know.
@55true4u The only conspiracy that happened was the HRC and DNC conspiring with Fusion GPS to use the Steele "Dossier" which has been found to be full of crap that the HRC and her State Dept were sending to Steele. What really needs to be investigated is those who are pressing this crap.
@bowhunter_va Now if he had one yesterday that might be another story, but years before running for office doesn't make it right, but that doesn't affect the way I would vote. Nice try Dems but you are going to have to be a lot stronger than asking that STUPID question.
@bbusa617 In that case, then Muellers "Witch Hunt" or was that "Haunt" needs to be directed at the NRC and DNC as well as Obama rather than at @POTUS.	Since Clapper has come to his senses, it just might end Mueller once and for all.
@Sheckyi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump When you FIRE HIM, FIRE his WIFE since she helped against @POTUS. His animous towards the @POTUS sits on his arms and in his facial expressions. IT's a shame that he has been left in this position of trust because he's untrustworthy. He has deep ties to Mueller and Comey, RECUSE.
@President45US But understand the DemocRATS want OPEN BORDERS which is DEAD  WRONG. THAT WALL IS A NECESSARY ITEM.  	MAXINE WATER IS ENABLING flag desecration which is illegal, she needs to pay the penalty of 1-year in Jail + a fine or both.
@PJSARD1 @Jo21348 @busybe_ @RedNationRising I know what it is, I'm also 100% disabled through my 28-years of military service. My GF gets SSI.

I'm a VET and with her doing that, I'm pissed and she needs to learn a VERY HARD LESSON. Hopefully very fast. She encouraged the aliens while they burned the flag outside her CA office. By her encouragement, she too broke the law on Desecration of the US Flag. It's time JAIL HER.
@tedlieu Ted if you have any pull over Maxine Waters, please warn her she broke the law on FLAG DESECRATION which is punishable by a fine and a year in jail or both. Since she believes she's above the law, she needs to learn a hard lesson.
Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. SAYING WHAT YOU SAID YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR THE LAW. https://t.co/Fo5XZSizGq
For Maxine Waters info YOUR BACKING THE DESECRATION OF THE US FLAG has its own penalties. You might want to rethink your statement before blurting out that these ALIEN idiots mad at the US.  Desecration of the flag of the United States; penalties.
@Kingsmandean @Jo21348 @busybe_ @RedNationRising I have been to my local SS office, I was not impressed by their attitude.

@darsavmo Awe, don't let Robert S. Mueller see this, because he's the reason this crap keeps on going.

@darsavmo That was the Dems under Obama in 2011. Remember that piece of information when you are voting for their re-election. They deserve to be jailed for stealing the Senior Citizens trust fund monies. This is why Social Security is going broke and those DemocRATS shouldn't hold office
@Thomas1774Paine Ah let's see, his company helped Obama in 2008, 2012, and 2016 during the elections. That Mr. Zuckerberg is called collusion and while it might not be a crime it does show pure BIAS against the Republican party over 8-years. https://t.co/H1YgbagMGj

people are needed for any meeting with the other side, That would also go for the meeting you had in Singapore. NEVER trust the other person to come to a meeting unprepared. This is why more people would help than NONE.
@realDonaldTrump Since the Russians seem the be telling what went on in that meeting, it would seem to me that he went in WIRED. So they got to hear everything that was being said. Putin is an old GRU member so he went into a meeting prepared whereas you didn't. This is why more
@Thomas1774Paine She's going to have a BIG PROBLEM then with the SCOTUS decision on illegal aliens. They have NO RIGHTS guaranteed by the Constitution since they are not US Citizens, therefore they CAN'T VOTE. https://t.co/N02AUb5yFz
@RedNationRising The illegal alien who doesn't put in doesn't get fund for anything. Now that sounds better to me, and I am a Vet.
@darsavmo One of these days, they'll figure out that going against the truth of the election that they were totally against Trump. Well, it's time ABC got the NEWS, they lose sponsors for programs because of leftist hosts. It's time for them to go, learn a hard lesson. https://t.co/oONZ81VamL
@EdmundHulton Because their agenda is totally against the Constitution. We can vote DemocRATS out of office and those judges can ALL be replaced. They might not like it, but they were not voted into office they were put there by the @POTUS, and he can remove them ALL.
@darsavmo Awe she doesn't want what she's calling for of her supporters to do. Well, @RepMaxineWaters turnabout is fair play.

@Mae_Linn @RedNationRising @HessAshton All military recruits get buzz cuts. IT's a way of removing their identities and letting them know they only have to rely on those to the right and left of them for their support. It's a harsh way of getting through to some, but it works.
@Cathykillion1 @Technologyoffe4 Florida had everyone provide a federal birth certificate which meant that the one given my parents was not a legal birth certificate. Yes, though I had military service, didn't mean I had a Federal Birth Certificate, which is CRAP. I got one, it came from PA I'd been born in NJ.
@Mae_Linn @RedNationRising @HessAshton No, when you go into the military the first thing that happens is they get a hair-cut and it isn't one that they would like. They cut the hair all off as a sign of losing your civilian identity. Bu losing the hair it gives the person a new lease on life. I  had 28-years service.

@Thomas1774Paine Somewhere in the back recesses of her mind, she might have thought about the FEC, but then shoved it back. She has proved over and over that she really doesn't care if what she is doing is legal, as long as she gets the outcome that she's looking for. The shoe is on other foot. https://t.co/yPBhCJoDxD

@homerobento Even during JFK, they had not learned. Now they have broadened their scope to the poor and now DACA as well as illegals who do not have a vote no matter what the DemocRATS tell them. https://t.co/Zv7Q8dhnnH
@homerobento Yup and I think they'd better rethink their statement thanks in part to Clapper and Brennan. They were lying to Congress isn't very bright. They will rue the day they had even said anything to anyone. They don't have much of a history, they aren't supposed to spy inside the USA. https://t.co/AHZbPkzxGr
@President45US Their "new" slogan for the DemocRAT Party is old enough to go back to Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse Dung, and most likely Kim Jun-un. A Socialist / Communist slogan from back in the 19630's. I don't know who thought that was such a bright idea, but it really isn't. https://t.co/fkoEFLMATo

@DrMartyFox I  hope you will also remember what else the DemocRAT Party does for everyone. It isn't what they tell you it's what they really do for you.

@MarkRubinstien @TheLastRefuge2 @TuckerCarlson Please understand that I was born 12 days after VJ Day. I've seen and studied presidents and wars. I was brought when they actually taught you the differences between Socialism,, Fascism, Communism, and democracy. Our liberal educators are making followers. Obama's NEA worthless.
@RealWayneRoot Oh, great right after Bernie Sanders Chief of Staff was listed in the Mueller probe.  Two who out in space and not using their God-given brains for anything but a hatrack. The blind leading the blind in this pair. https://t.co/VFnR3hcKCn
@RobertMueIIer You, Mr. Mueller, are a fraud and liar. You have committed a TREASONABLE thing by being deeply involved in the Uranium One Crap and then by trying unsuccessfully to cover it up. You were also involved with the Wiretap of Trump Tower and played the dummy. Totally FUBAR. https://t.co/ngJq8RvUSj
@RickRainmaker77 Wrong, let them make fools of themselves. At that point, anyone with a brain can see how STUPID and ABSURD their argument really is.

@MarkRubinstien @TheLastRefuge2 @TuckerCarlson Oh is that why Obama had Trump tower wiretapped? Had to know everything that was going on? Brennan and Clapper had the ware-with-all Via the CIA to do that wiretapping. Which I might say was against the law for the CIA to do in the USA. So they broke the law doing it. JACKASSES https://t.co/wOAk9NzZnZ

@MarkRubinstien @TheLastRefuge2 @TuckerCarlson You have to know who was in charge of the FBI when Uranium One was going on=Mueller. Comey didn't take over until 5/10/17. So before that, it was Mueller. Yeah, Comey fixed Hillary's email scandal and paid a price for that, Rosenstein worked under Mueller. So how did he get DAG?
@mrmonks01 Jim, How could you be so much for HRC, when she lied continuously about Benghazi? Also never trust the MSM polls, they were in Hillary's pocketbook throughout the election.

All of these investigation organizations FBI and CIA sre complicit in their lack of oversight and have fallen flat on their faces. Insisting Russia did something, yet allowing the non-vetted Awan brothers to send the Backup to Pakistan to sell to the highest bidder. What is up?
Everyone knew the Awan brothers made a backup of the DNC computer systems thanks in part to Wasserman-Schultz gave them the keys to the kingdom. What is to keep them from selling that information to anyone since they are from Pakistan? Why aren't the FBI or CIA looking into it?
@wagepeace @AssangeMrs Listen to him and learn what is really going on, then listen to her and she doesn't know what she's talking about. I'm surprised she's able to get dressed, that is unless her clothes are on numbered hooks and she puts them on by the number. https://t.co/NmiRuyeyZQ
@Thomas1774Paine Finally, a GOOD NEWS STORY that wasn't, for the most part, picked up by MSM, because it wasn't against @POTUS. Way to go, Fernando, you did it the right way.

@Thomas1774Paine Got a Question for Hillary which I know she will not answer. Why did you sell 20% of our Uranium to RUSSIA?

@Thomas1774Paine This is why @POTUS should not have trusted Mr. Putin, after all, 20% of our Uranium and then it's covered up by the OBSTRUCTIONIST FBI. Now they want us to trust their assessment that Russia hacked the Dems systems, forgetting the Awans who made backups sent them to Pakistan. https://t.co/RBZkREfiKs

@StephenMilIer What is to stop the Pakistanis from doing it and making it look like that it came from Russia? The Awan Brothers made backups of the DNC server. These guys weren't even vetted when Wasserman-Schultz hired them to do IT work on over 40 Reps and Sens computers. Awe they got took.
@EdmundHulton Seems that Jim Nance is about everything you have described and more. A hardline open border, anti ICE, ANTIFA, BLM, etc. ad nauseam.

@tedlieu USE ALL 1940, from Vidkun Quisling (1887-1945), Norwegian fascist politician who headed the puppet government during the German occupation of Norway in World War II; shot for treason after German defeat. First used in London Times of April 15, 1940, in a Swedish context.

@SatireandIrony @RodStryker @Phil_Mattingly Try Pakistan the Awan brothers came from there and the backups went there. Why does everyone forget them? They had access to the DNC Server, over 40 rep's and sen's systems with their passwords. They WERE NOT VETTED which means they should never have gotten to the systems.

@crum_mary @AnthemRespect Most likely, but that can be changed in a heartbeat. One problem is that Rosenstein is still holding the Asst. to the AG. The State of Maryland would like to DISBAR him for what he pulled while there.
@RedNationRising Mr. Brennan had better keep his nose out politics totally or have a high school aged young man school him on Abraham Lincoln's sayings. For a person who is supposed to be on top of his game, Mr. Brennan isn't. He is upset that HRC didn't become POTUS so he couldn't be jailed.
@Phil_Mattingly Question for you, what would the Awan brothers be doing with the backup of the DNC systems in Pakistan? Is it possible to make it look like another country is doing something to our election? Has this thought gone across your minds, if not why not?

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Different subject Ted, were you part of the Democrats whose computers were breached by the non-vetted Awan brothers? Why aren't you screaming about that? Wasserman-Schultz approved them without making sure they had the correct credentials for the job, she loosed them on DNC
@RedNationRising But have you noticed that the DemocRATS don't say anything about that because they are embarrassed because of their stupidity? But they continue to go after their opposite side with their collusion crap.
@Thomas1774Paine Wasserman-Schultz needs to see the inside of a prison cell, for allowing unvetted persons onto Government computer systems.

@Thomas1774Paine Al Frankenstein is back, he needs to stay gone.
@Sheckyi That figures, he has his sticky fingers in everything corrupting even the Church. Soros ambition is to be within the One World Order.
@RedNationRising Obama is being sponsored by George Soros or one of his outside groups, and By the way, he's been doing this since @POTUS was inaugurated. So this isn't a new thing,, it is the treasonist ambition of Obama and those who support his Socialist vision for our country. https://t.co/iHHOzROCQe
@NRA @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah, then why were those who committed those killings all registered as DemocRATS? That tells me your party doesn't know how to safely store their weapons,, trigger guards work when used. It isn't the gun that kills, it is the person behind that trigger that does the killing. https://t.co/WF4IIILRPt
@grizzlemeister Then check out the Gary @GarySinise7 Foundation and see what else he does for 1st responders; military; meals for those going and coming from duty at airports;  military hospitals Invincipal Festivals; build houses adapted for wheelchairs making the house function for the injured
@RodStryker Less than lethal keeps those who created the problem where they will be prosecuted and properly sent to the correct facility for their incarceration. Now should some of them be illegal aliens them they will get their proper deportation almost immediately.

@adriandt31 Go for it. After he's been impeached the State of Maryland wants a shot at him as well. He ought to be worried about the shady crap he pulled there. That is if he isn't sent to a maximum security prison Leavenworth or GITMO.
@bonniemurphy Lied about prisoners being left in North Viet-Nam, had his records hidden by his Admiral Father so no one could get to them. To myself and a lot of my friends from that period he isn't a hero nor does he deserve the accolades that will be given for his service.

@Megan4MAGA That is why sexual deviants are registered and are not allowed within 500 yards of a school or daycare. They aren't allowed in apartment complexes where children reside. If caught it's not a slap on the wrist, it's hard-time.
@Thomas1774Paine No kidding, and why would the folks in Maryland want to get their hands on him, could it be he's a DIRTY COP? Look in the Appointments clause of that statute and see if an Asst. AG can appoint a special prosecutor, then give him special powers to go into anything. Weasel he is. https://t.co/i9LO1DQ5BY
@Thomas1774Paine I try doing my part by looking at what they have done and then backing up what you have said. Verify before making a statement. That like Mueller getting all of those awards in less than 3-years, but I verified it and took a picture of it. https://t.co/Em6DUYnaLd
@Thomas1774Paine That sounds like a Mueller tactic or Andrew Weissmann which I would not put it past him to pull that and say he didn't know it. But he's been caught pulling crap and got reprimanded as well. Think Enron, that was Weissmann's doing. The plagiarized law suit. https://t.co/yNGqGJASdh

@AnthemRespect Not of the rank and file, but that ALL of the 7th-floor needs to have their SECURITY CLEARANCES REMOVED followed by an IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.

She said "Pressing the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade would be a huge mistake". Where does it say she's for the overturn? She didn't, only you have. https://t.co/DzEwu3vVTp
@Thomas1774Paine You didn't read what she said: “Pressing for a Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade would be a huge mistake,” Lahren said in a “Final Thoughts” Fox News. “Do we really want to fight for this, alienate Democrats, moderates, libertarians, all to lose in the end anyway?
@darsavmo And the US Congress, both houses are too afraid to do anything about it. The DemocRATS see these illegals as new voters. So what if they aren't citizens, they don't even want to follow the Constitution let alone the Bill of Rights. In truth they are ANti-American then need to out https://t.co/7c4KvaixHi
@KJ54290723 Go back slightly further, and you'll find the former FBI head now Special Council Meuller in that mix along with Loretta Lynch, Sally Yates, Eric Holder, as well as Rod Rosenstein. Now you have the cabal who were involved. According to Meuller, Trump was not supposed to have won. https://t.co/QPQgVkzLCA
@GovMikeHuckabee I know the feeling Governor, I get them to. Then I can point out had they read what I'd attached they would have their answers. That is almost as good as the politician saying he's going to make a volcano pay for the damages it's caused. Yeah, right. I like getting your messages https://t.co/cmuMga5q0v
@Thomas1774Paine But those Liberal DemocRATS could care less about the security of the CITIZENS of this country. They are more interested in illegal aliens than they are about anything else. But once they get past mid-terms they won't give a flying flip about them. They are on;y TALKING POINTS. https://t.co/2KNX4yxE5r
@RodStryker He doesn't know how to spell LEGAL. but look where he is the hotbed for ultra-liberal thinking in the Northeast. It wasn't quite that bad back in '54 when I left the state. I down in NW Florida, not the peninsula where the libtards reside.

@OathKeeper101st @chfortrump @TheJusticeDept Rod admitted he;'s running the FBI, not Sessions. It's up to him to cover up all sorts of screwups.

@OathKeeper101st @chfortrump @TheJusticeDept Why are you forgetting people like Rosenstein [include his US Attorney wife Lisa H Barsoomian (her email address is Lisa Barsoomian at NIH gov)]?

@GregGutfeldShow What you need is cannon fodder when you take on Mad Maxine Waters. The Most Corrupt Rep in the house.

@RealJamesWoods Seems to me I said that before Mr. Trump went to Singapore about Kim's Father and Grandfather going back on what they said that the would do.

@darsavmo Finally, I think she might have seen the light, it also might be a ruse. You'd have to think back to the Crusades and beyond that to Hannibal's invasion from the East. They didn't win then, but we will let "oppressed". Are they really oppressed, Or is this a planned migration? https://t.co/jPSDbSVK5P
@replouiegohmert Do you know who Lisa H. Barsoomian is? Have you ever heard of her? Do you know who her husband is? I'll bet you do, but you didn't know she works in a deep dark world. Which might give you a hint about CIA operative. Why She is Asst. AG Rod Rosenstein's WIFE https://t.co/7JQCejTd5D
@darsavmo Awe gee, you don't know Rod's wife, do you? You have probably never even have heard of her, but she's as well as he are US Attorneys.

@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Mueller might have to find a new hiding hole to go hide in because both Intel committees will have this information in front of them.

@Thomas1774Paine The only places they have due process rights is in the country that they left, not ours.  So the ACLU Lawyers had better re-think their position in light of what the SCOTUS just said. They can go back to their home country and get that, just not here, they ARE NOT CITIZENS.

@TGowdySC As Chm. House Intel, you should know that spies are used by the CIA and DIA, the FBI uses informants. You mislead, we the people, with your obscuring the subject. The FBI isn't investigating @POTUS, but the CIA is doing an investigation of Trump's campaign.
@McGovernJeffrey Now, Mr. Gowdy, Chm House Intel ought to know the difference in a criminal investigation and an espionage investigation. He's been feeding E1 a line of crap. As a former Army MI member, we used spies to go undercover. Mr. Gowdy owes us an apology for misleading us.
@McGovernJeffrey Clapper and Brennan are both deeply involved in this crap of spying on the @POTUS campaign. Don't be fooled by listening to the  FBI saying that Trump isn't under investigation by them. That's because he's the object of an espionage investigation which falls under the CIA and DIA https://t.co/DvGaNbFqZU

@JKidder4 @gray2pratt @Robertgsr44 @bbusa617 He also used another name Barry Soetoro which was listed as a foreign national at Columbia Univ. in 1981. Now my question to you is why did his brother in Kenya show a birth certificate with his name on it from that country? Most. likely to prove Obama was not a legal President.

@darsavmo She ought to stay in Massachusetts and figure out why she lied about "Indian" heritage when she won't take a DNA test to prove her words. In her case, I'd say "Liar, liar pants are on FIRE". https://t.co/GY1GlaN4na
@Thomas1774Paine I saw the dates on the t-shirts, all were from 2017. And while the message was fairly good it would have been better to have MS-13 style dummies being blown up. Last explosives I handled personally was at Fort Jackson, Columbia, SC.
@darsavmo IMPEACH MAXINE WATERS NOW!!! Let her feel the heat. She also needs to know that the truth will catch-up with her and then she'll know it's over. https://t.co/vTh8JzBjoe
IT seems to me that since the @POTUS put his foot down on the unfair trading practices of companies in the rest of the world towards the U.S. They came unglued. They didn't think we'd find out, well we did. Now you need to negotiate real agreements not onesided it's balanced NOW! https://t.co/Zi1oSO15i8
@Thomas1774Paine Figures that a DemocRAT would be involved. Yes I know RAT is capped, that was done on purpose. A Harvard grad who thinks he's better than anyone else needs an awakening and NOT A SLAP ON THE WRIST. By the Way, I found his picture in the lineup, can you https://t.co/boRH4oh4hp
@RealBasedBlonde @Walmart @WalmartNews @WalmartToday @WalmartCareers @WalmartGiving @WalmartAction @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @POTUS IMPEACH  MAXINE WATERS NOW!!!  Not only is she Wrong, but she's one of the MOST CORRUPT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS now. It's a wonder that she hasn't been arrested yet. https://t.co/38HSGATIVB
@USPatriotB These three pictures combined into one shot should give you a little bit more cannon fodder. Planned Parenthood needs to be closed down for harvesting baby parts, as Dr. Carson mentioned recently. Yes, I stay aware of lots of things, have been around for almost 3/4 century. https://t.co/QjQyuv44SB
@Thomas1774Paine Couldn't happen to a more deserving liberal idiot. If that upsets you to bad so sad. She needs to have her mouth washed out with Lye Soap with a swig of Cod Liver Oil. I'm tired of their I'm better than you, you are no better than anyone. you get up and put 2 feet on the floor.,
@RedditGuns Was the vehicle locked while you were transporting these weapons into the range and back out to the car? 	I don't leave mine without locking it, even when it's at home it's locked and the alarm has been set. I happen to have 5 weapons, multiple knives, and hands are registered.
@SusanStormXO Wasserman Schultz and Irwan both need to go to Prison for what they both pulled during the election, only she did it to those Democrats. She's not as smart as she might think she is. But by letting a NON-VETTED staffer into the Congress members systems was unconscionable. https://t.co/nTig46LRIG
@Thomas1774Paine Good luck on that one. Obama broke every law when he paid a ransom and then said it was from their moonies in the banks. We're not supposed to know that that was done. But,  Rouihani's got to understand that when administrations change the whole payment thing changes.
@EdgeLSeawolf Exactly, why should anyone else pay for its removal? They want it so badly let them pay for it. They are HATE MONGERS if it isn't BLACK THEN IT HAS TO GO. Let's see what kind of dirt these folks have in their backgrounds. I'll bet they aren't squeaky clean.
@EdgeLSeawolf Well let those with that bright idea do it themselves
@Dianestraley @nytimes @FAIRImmigration Go figure the MSM in Print is trying to figure out how to make the news. But I believe that this will catch up with them and they will lose all credibility with their readership on both print and electronic media. They need to figure out that Clinton DID NOT WIN, Get over it. https://t.co/7gIjNTDP8s
@RedNationRising Let's get rid of the NEA's idea of removing the CORE value of teaching.  Rather let's teach the differences between Fascism, Communism, Socialism, and Democracy. They need to know this before they fall into the trap that Bernie Sanders did when he uses Socialism to get elected.
@MSNBC @PeterAlexander Bioy are you behind the times, you don't have to know who they are till he says who they are. By not giving their names out early, you don't have a chance to dig up FAKE DIRT on them. That list is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. That is unless your Security Clearance is Presidential.
@MarkMah26387695 If you are talking about Obama, you'd better go after your Chicago mayor and then the Democrat Governor who went along with this farce. True Obama does belong in Federal Prison and then in front of a Firing Squad for his Treason. He did not do what he said he'd do. https://t.co/xwIySpKuZ0
@darsavmo What Mad Maxine doesn't seem to understand "What's Good For The Goose Is Good For The Gander". She'd better watch what she's asking for otherwise, she'll get the SAME TREATMENT. Which I do not think she'll like. STUPIDITY must run with the leadership in the Democrat Party. https://t.co/yNloJbaOMm
Now that Associate Deputy AG Schools (who was overseeing the Meuller probe) is leaving the Justice Department. It looks like Rosenstein is going to have to do his obstruction all over again. Rosenstein and Meuller are the Insurance Policy Strzok's text messages alluded to.
@Thomas1774Paine Rosenstein and Meuller are the Insurance Policy Strzok was mentioning in those text messages. In that Rosenstein has broadened the scope of Meuller's investigation. Now, Rosenstein isn't even overseeing Meuller, he has another doing that. Now, Rosenstein will have to do it. https://t.co/d6xS8JbCwb
@EdmundHulton As am I, but I have one other thing in my background. I'm a Notary in my 7th term, I can see something that is wrong and say something about it without giving the law to cover it.  	Now, on the other hand, Obama chose what part of a law he'd follow and what not to.
@EdmundHulton I have a means of getting them and it could get under their skin. Can't say anyone can really talk to them and get through to them but if they have to look at a picture, they get sick. Just mention abortion kills and Planned Parenthood harvests organs. Ask, see anything wrong? https://t.co/5NOvmv26BP

As for Open borders, forget it. We don't need illegal drugs pouring into the country like a water spigot. https://t.co/eiblcjKnXn
@tedlieu @EPAScottPruitt That isn't legal by any stretch of the imagination and Mr. Pruitt needs to have his head examined thoroughly, He also needs to be investigated for his collision, and impropriety. What a shame, a Notary knows when something is wrong and not legal. You wouldn't get my seal on it.
@Sheckyi Looks like sneaky Adam Schiff and his staff. https://t.co/9qT1Jsub8O
@EdmundHulton I'm going to attach a picture which has a 12-week old fetus, and the other attached is a very liberal knucklehead. If you have a way to make screenshots then take the 12-week old off and you'll have 2 shots. I sent Dr. Carson a tweet on abortion https://t.co/XIdh0ntfFw
@EdmundHulton Can't do anything about uninformed people. I've worked law enforcement for over 15-years mostly in the military. I got enough of that while in service, then got it while doing first aid for a victim who'd been hit with a brick on the cheek. I blasted the officer for not helping.
@HCSOSheriff You have K-9's right? Well, I tried sending you the dog treat recipe that we [Fort Walton Beach PD CPAAA] used at "Dog Days".

A talking point isn't legislation. https://t.co/OsVCy9XyS3
@Thomas1774Paine About time a judge bucked Mr. JACK-ASS Meuller. He said: "It's up for me and my staff to fix the mistakes made by 62,984,825 unresponsible and stupid people." said on 4/22/18.  On 4/10/18 he said, "it's just that he wasn't supposed to win the 2016 election".He's desperate. https://t.co/eS5P4ucR7x
@reg1776 He needs to be treated as a terrorist, given the full treatment find out whom else he's plotting this devious deed with. Put him into a steel drum lidded leave a whole for him to talk, now 1 drop of water a second should do the trick. That drip, drip, drip on the lid will do it.
@pennjillette One of the best magic shows.

@OCSOALERTS With all of the warnings, everyone hears about locking a vehicle. Why don't they? Is it laziness or is it the feeling I don't care?

@10NewsWTSP Watch for delays, some people can't live without their phones even when it is illegal to text and drive at the same time.

@EdmundHulton Somewhere in my Civics classes when I was in 9th grade (a very long time ago '59) I learned that. What gets me is that the CORE SUBJECTS have strayed away from teaching what everyone ought to know about Socialism. Fascism, Communism, and Democracy. Liberal teachers are not good. https://t.co/UJy9Xwsdd2
@ggeett37aaa Dr. Carson has the question put very correctly. I've put this picture out a few times, the Pro-choice folks don't like this shot, because it shows a baby at 12-weeks old, while the insides aren't fully formed the fetus is. ABORTION IS MURDER no matter how much you candy coat it. https://t.co/3uQLLYJ2Zb
@herbert_hays You are kidding, right? It's the DemocRATS who are not doing anything for the "Dreamers" after all if you understand illegals are only talking points. They've had since the time Obama's 2nd term to fix it, what did they do? Nothing, it's only a talking point, not a fixable idea. https://t.co/IhbFXjrcoX
@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton Nope don't use any of that. I was using a cartilage builder but haven't had to after I'd continued to do the exercises. As for a back surgery, my injury starts at C1, I was told if I did it I could be a Quad or Dead, neither of which I liked. I exercise muscles around the back.
@RedNationRising The problem is these people entering our country who do not want to assimilate into our society. They want us to learn their own language. Well, I have NEWS for you, you come to this country you learn our language follow our laws, if not then go back where you came from bye-bye.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump He was not born on American soil or territory [Kenya isn't either of them], so his Presidency was not legal. The DemocRATS didn't care about the small stuff. He Hates America and Americans. He lied on multiple occasions and was caught doing so. https://t.co/tAhMMVOmJP
@SenatorDurbin When was the last time you googled ICE and really found out what they do? If you said NEVER, then you have been misinformed.

@mccrady_e @realDonaldTrump Rosenstein has been colluded from the get-go, {firing of Comey, Uranium One, Russia Investigation, Meuller [who was head of the FBI when he came to DC], Clinton email, oversight of the Special Prosecutor investigation}.

@jbirdinga How true, but it isn't only civilized countries, All countries but the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala ban all weapons from their citizens.

@EdmundHulton IT's not only the Mexicans it's Soros, Obama, the DemocRATS. Time For ARMED TROOPS ON THE BRODER and anyone who steps into the country can and will be shot, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. PUT SIGNS UP STATING THAT, HUGH ENOUGH SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE REMOVED.
@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine He withheld evidence that would clear the defendants and was caught.
@RedNationRising He stares like that the more he'll look like Charles Manson. I wonder if he's any distant relation to that killer?

@AnthemRespect Criminals come in all sizes and colors. They say they are wanting to emigrate, but they don't assimilate into our society.

@darsavmo They have places for people who need to have their head cleaned out of garbage. But what she really needs is to be REMOVED from office by her constituents. Either that or an asylum for the mentally deranged. Normally when the first word comes out I know they are JACK-ASSES https://t.co/WPvt7RqDeO
@darsavmo Kamala is a disgrace, but then again it also shows you how much our DEMOCRAT CONGRESS MEMBERS LIKE OUR MILITARY. They hate us, yes I said US, I'm a vet too. I just don't live in California and I'm glad of it as well.
@Thomas1774Paine Let's make her really foam at the mouth, wash it out with s brand new bar of LYE SOAP, and to wash it out 10 oz of cod liver oil mixed with prune juice.
@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton Knee surgeries started 1983 r, 84 2-on l knee, 85 r, 86 r, 88 l, 89 r, and 92 l. Also DO NOT GET a 2nd opinion the doctor says the same thing the first one did, doesn't test to get what is wrong [that is an independent evaluation] which looks for problems.
@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton Nope, just muscle strengthening around the areas that were hurt. Rather than quit doing the therapy on the legs I've continued doing then, especially after asking the Orthopedic surgeon what would happen 10 years down the road, and he answered a total knee replacement both legs
@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton 8 knee operations [4 per leg], fell off of a ladder landed on the back of neck and shoulder blades, broke the left arm and powdered the wrist. Other than that I'm fine. I don't let it bother me much. When it does I'll say I'm good. GOD has a reason for me to be here,
@EdgeLSeawolf @brenda_lummus That's because NYC is sot on illegals, they don't give them what they ought to get, partially because of the cost of keeping them behind bars. What a shame that these liberals don't see the benefit in making them leave on their first instance rather than on his 11th time.
@RyznykStefan When you don't answer a question directly, it is a way of teaching without the person knowing about it. It's part of a Masters degree program in Business Management. It was part of a WoodBadge Course I took back in '79, that I still use to this day.
@RyznykStefan Because I'm 100% disabled vet, doesn't mean I let it disable me. After the injury, I rehabbed strengthened the muscles around the knees, back and neck. Worked in a furniture warehouse over 10 years without reinjuring those areas. I finally retired on 10/14/16.
@RyznykStefan @EdmundHulton I haven't heard of a person who wants to hear of things wrong with someone else yet, So by saying OK or good, which BTW, you are, you're not lying. No one wants to know I'm 100% disabled, but GOD put me here for a reason, so spread the good news which brightens everyone else up.
@tedlieu @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Ahh, but, the Speaker wanted his watered-down version, which got SOUNDLY DEFEATED by his fellow Republicans.

@EdmundHulton Never answer a question directly, if you give a wrong answer you'll never be trusted again. But if you re-ask the question so that they come up with the answer, even if they are wrong they will ask again. Restate the question so they get the answer at that point you are a genius
@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Rosenstein had better see to his leakers before going after the GOP. The problem is that “Rosenstein and his people have no respect for Congress, especially GOP,” the Justice source confirmed. He doesn't like the idea that he's been caught in his lie the OIG confirmed it. https://t.co/gziGMUPAro
@USPatriotB It was OBAMA who ordered Cyber Chief to Stand Down against Russian.

@EdmundHulton Here's a recipe of how to do just that. Teach someone something new, help when asked, don't complain about the little things in life,, that might be bothering you. When I'm asked I say Ok or good. They don't want to hear of your problems, they have their own.
@Thomas1774Paine Joy no worse than when the DemocRATS controlled both houses of Congress during the Obama reign.

@RealJack NO WAY, you have been in Congress too long. The only victims are those who voted for you because you didn't live up to your promises.

@bbusa617 No what do you expect from a "President" who hates America and Americans and has said so? Obama was overseeing everything that was being done, especially since he loves Muslims, not US citizens. https://t.co/MkdBkwKi54

@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz If you tell him he'll be impeached, at that point, he'll lose his job and his pension. IF he wants to pull that crap he needs to know that. 2nd Mueller is deeply colluded and is in over his head. His lead prosecutor has a less than stellar reputation. They need to END IT NOW.
@3Conservative @chelseahandler If you look read and learn, Obama our traitor in chief made "Propaganda" authorized 12/29/12 inside the USA after it had been banned back in 1948. Now that might tell you something, just how far LEFT the OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS. https://t.co/LevcYd5DZb
@DunwoodyPolice @ATLairport Ahh, something good for your K9's. It's simple to make, both the dogs and people can eat them. This has peanut butter, honey, applesauce in it. Our CPAAA with the Fort Walton Beach PD gave them out at "Dog Days", the dogs loved them. https://t.co/B9AWpg22N7

@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine Weissmann and his team took the aggressive step of indicating the entire accounting firm. According to a source familiar with the case, the firm’s defense attorneys met with them not to do so before the indictment. “Their response indicated they didn’t care,” He's a JACK-ASS, see https://t.co/I1fATgVoFa
@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine Then there was the Arthur Andersen case, which with Weissmann, shows a pattern of malfeasance. According to the Daily Beast: During his years at the Justice Department, Weissmann built a reputation as a prosecutor willing to push the envelope–sometimes with disastrous results.
@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine Actually, Weissmann doesn't really sound fair. According to the leftwing Daily Beast, in a piece published last August: [Legal experts] believe [Weissmann's] presence on Mueller’s team means the probe may push legal boundaries as it investigates alleged collusion Russia &amp; Trump
@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine Think Enron and Weissman, he botched that case. In 1997 Weissmann was officially reprimanded by a judge in the Eastern District of New York for withholding evidence. Weissmann was reported to the OIG and Senate Judiciary Committee for alleged “corrupt legal practices.”
@RepGoodlatte If you impeach him [FIRE HIM], DO NOT LET HIM HAVE HIS PENSION. Give him the notification he could lose more than he thinks. Reputation is one thing, but his retirement pension will get him in his wallet. He is still Knee Deep in Uranium One as is Mr. Mueller. https://t.co/cyFtabSN6K
@vannsmole @afbranco That's those DemocRATS doing what they know best, lying to their supporters not keeping promises, and giving away the country.

@RepGoodlatte Then I can tell you didn't do a very good background check on Rod Rosenstein since he's knee deep in the Uranium One crap. He's not good for the FBI, except as a cover it up man. He's part and parcel to the problem. Anything that might embarrass the FBI won't see. https://t.co/hdTDAVntF0
@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine The FBI railroaded four men, and then made sure they remained in prison for upwards of 30 years. They — or the estates of two who died in prison — were awarded $102 million in 2007 for false imprisonment. U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston said the bureau frame them.
@President45US They should have seen that coming. The people are sick and tired of being lied to by the DemocRATS. So for them to capture the majority of people back they will have to follow through with their "talking points" rather than forgetting what they had promised. Jim Crow KKK is them. https://t.co/6wdKB4TwAX
@Thomas1774Paine 1stly Mr. Mathews your side has to hold the Majority which you don't.	2ndly You are a fool to think that the DemocRATS will do anything.	3rdly You need to take a break or come up with a procedural "tool".	4thly You need to think before opening your mouth, https://t.co/rttrW9Y60s
@RealBasedBlonde @HuffPostPol Nathan Larson, an independent who has been expelled from Virginia's Libertarian Party, wants to make incest and pedophilia legal. I'm surprised he's not a DemocRAT, it would fit the Clinton lifestyle that the rest of the DemocRATS overlooked.
@Thomas1774Paine A high-ranking Justice Department official with a pristine record of divulging Intel gems now says Rosenstein privately fumes at the likes of Jordan, Nunes, Meadows and other GOP Congressman who have been relentlessly pressuring Rosenstein to produce facets of FBI CORRUPTION.
@Thomas1774Paine Rosenstein has his own leakers, so he's avoiding them by going after the GOP. “Rosenstein and his people have no respect for Congress, especially GOP,” the Justice source confirmed. “It is accurate,” Jordan shot back. “We’ve caught you hiding information. ”Rosenstein caught lying
@Thomas1774Paine There's nothing to rat on and why make up things that will prove not to worth the paper it's written down on. The Special council tried pulling his dirty tricks and it's coming back to haunt him. Should Flynn talk in the court and let them know what kind of JACK-ASS Mueller is. https://t.co/jtBpBscUlp
@Thomas1774Paine Mr. Rosenstein had best get his HIGH RANKING LEAKERS IN THE FBI, rather than go after the GOP. For all, we know he's allowing the leaks so he can say it's the GOP doing the leaking. 	It is time for the GOP to IMPEACH ROSENSTEIN but also cause his job to be in peril.
@RepMattGaetz Liar, liar your pants are on fire. OIG Did so now you come clean or expect to be CANNED. My personal feelings are that you ought to be shackled and cuffed and marched out of the FBI in front of your colleagues.
@seanhannity Got NEWS for you Rosenstein could care less. After all, he expanded Mueller's probe from Russia to anything @POTUS. Now think on that because he's found No Russia collusion except in the Clinton camp. https://t.co/42BQwdwQ2Y
Let's see, if Rod Rosenstein gets impeached, he WILL NOT HAVE HIS FBI JOB anymore.  He will have thrown away his career for because of his IGNORANCE and UTTER STUPDIDTY. Trying to slow roll the Congress, wasn't a gr8 idea. https://t.co/w9faGXw6eD

As for DHS ICE INS HHS HLS when they Spell a 6-year olds name wrong, do not have someone who speaks her language (which IS NOT SPANISH). She speaks an indigundis language, they wrong birth month, then had no idea of whom she with really. THAT IS GROSS NEGLIUEGNCE ON YOUR PARTS.
Are we sure that Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, aren't Republicans in name only? Because they are acting like DemocRATS in actually. I believe that they will OBSTRUCT their own party if given the opportunity.

@99PercentCzech @RedNationRising @POTUS I think they both do very well.
@99PercentCzech @RedNationRising @POTUS He was most likely an Obama appointee and that might explain his animus towards Trump. But I have a better answer for animosity towards the President. Just look at the pair of pictures and figure out which one fits him. https://t.co/vZTOVGxYw9
@seanhannity Especially that Judge in Hawaii wanting to make it so the President doesn't appoint a new Justice. I reminded him he wasn't elected by a President and he can lose his appointment just as fast. But I also suggested the 9th District be removed as well. I said he needed to be Smart https://t.co/Qrl9PU22mc
@chuckwoolery Awe, why don't we abolish his office, no big loss. Problem is this DemocRAT doesn't know anything about his party especially their beginnings. He needs some education https://t.co/qS5ZxZdqym
@BreitbartNews Just because Strzokk comes forward, that doesn't let Rosenstein off of the hook for not providing the Congress the paperwork for their oversight of the DOJ / FBI He's got to start understanding his days are numbered. He's not as "Smart" as he might think he is https://t.co/tL8bOqjCMH
@OldielocksNmo4 @Thomas1774Paine That's what not a Goody Two-shoes meant. Think back to Whitey Bulger and his insistence in keeping 4 innocent men in prison. Turns out the FBI did the killing and blamed it on these men.
@usacomment It's not funny anymore to him because he now has to do exactly what the court said to do. I could get under his skin but a picture is better than 10K words So here goes, read the first one and then the next. https://t.co/bThB52aHPT
@Thomas1774Paine That will have to include Mr. Mueller because he started this crap while he was the FBI head. Knee deep in Uranium One, not a goody two shoes by any stretch of the imagination. The Entire 7th Floor needs dismissal, NOW. https://t.co/7lcMJYTE7y
@RedNationRising Who made this FOOL the ruler over the @POTUS? He was not elected but appointed to his position. Meaning he's in a tenuous position trying to push his agenda. Most likely needs a very hard lesson, in Reality, his TERMINATION FROM THE BENCH. He might think he's smart but ... https://t.co/nciWfom523
@RedNationRising He's throwing what he think's he has, but he forgets that it's the @POTUS who appoints Supreme Court justices. He can, on the other hand, remove him from the bench as well as the entire 9th District. Now where will he be, I'll tell you on the outside looking in, without a job.
@USPatriotB She's skirting the question, knowing she's been caught in her hypocrisy. Trying to have it both ways doesn't always work when people have access to computer systems and can go back to the Obama crap and she didn't say a thing.

I'm what is called: "John Q. Public". The Democrats didn't have someone I felt I could trust. The Libertarians were too far out in the field to vote for. The Republicans were backing a reality TV Star who already has money, named Trump. But this man has done what he said he'd do.
It's a shame that it took a Court to tell INS, ICE, HHS, JEFF SESSIONS, and the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION the same thing I said yesterday. It's wrong to take little children away from their parent(s). Mr. Sessions, it's no laughing matter now, is it? So now you've mandate DO IT.

@darsavmo Maxine wouldn't like it if she were to be arrested for enabling mayhem, but that is what she's doing. Let's enable her right into an Orange Jumpsuit.

@darsavmo On the other hand, you ought to go after Maxine Waters, for enabling these idiots. She's been calling for people to do just this to all @POTUS personnel. She's a menace and needs to be stopped now.
@GovMikeHuckabee Not by a long shot. This is a Left Wing Chicken trying to say NO CONSERVATIVES ALLOWED IN HER ESTABLISHMENT. She doesn't care if she stays in business either. I'm not a fan of a coward who isn't open-minded enough to think Sarah doesn't do anything but report.
@AGPamBondi So she spat at you, have you considered she also might have given you the AIDS VITUS? Now you have Assualt with the intent to do harm. You can send in the Police to grab her while she doesn't have a group of the liberal press with her. Are you over 50? Elder Abuse.
@conserv44110594 They could have as soon as Pam was spat upon because they would not know if that activist has the AIDS VIRUS, that isn't a simple case of Assault because of the implication of purposefully giving Pam Aids. Now she can be arrested when she doesn't have the press around her. https://t.co/9Hd6MVB4DE
@Thomas1774Paine The activist doesn't seem to understand that Pam Bondi has NO POWER to go against the Federal Government. Now spitting on her can be called assault and she can be arrested for doing just that. Do we know that she doesn't have the Aids Virus? Unknown. https://t.co/oYjpjxtvCf

@Lady_Vi_2U @POTUS I'll buy that. He weaponized our law enforcement organizations into spying into another candidate's campaign.

@drawandstrike I found his picture, can you see it?  The one with the long ears looking straight towards you. https://t.co/tI2NWyOL4Y
@Thomas1774Paine Think about it, one IDIOT going out of his way [if only to get publlicity] to honor what I'd call a traitor [and her younger brother isn't much better either] during the Viet-Nam war. People tend to forget things that happened 50-60 years ago except for those of us who were there https://t.co/ZoOJYN1HEP
@AnnaApp91838450 Poor deluded Nancy, most of those in this country have already seen through your ruse. You'd better just get in there and FIX the problem that dates back to the Clinton Administration. As it is you are about due for bottle #4 [the IV Bottle]. https://t.co/beWjMtpoA8
@plantlady293 Both, Juan Williams and Shepard Smith forgot what Obama did to the country. 	1. Took our jobs and got them moved overseas.	2. Admitted DACA wasn't legal but started it.	3. Got boys into girls restrooms and vice versa.	4. Had Inhumane Conditions for Migrant Children https://t.co/VMHEce1sIO
@Thomas1774Paine And his apology isn't worth your time to read it. He did that because he doesn't want to lose any prospective job he might be getting. Lots of people in the biz do expressly that to draw attention away from their STUPIDITY by making you stupid for accepting that crap. https://t.co/ISkqz6kh1I
Here's what Obama did one thing that NO ONE is mentioning. It's the Invasion of Muslims into Christian countries. They could not beat us through war back in the 1400's, but as Christians we will allow supposed "persecuted people" into our countries giving it to them. https://t.co/cmRjY02npC
To those octagenarians in Congress, you started on a baby bottle, and graduated to a Coke bottle, now that you've past the beer bottle your only choice is the IV bottle. You have arrived. https://t.co/lIp0UxNlwp

He doesn't seem to know that without farmers, his grocery shelves would be empty. Someone in his Government had better get to him and explain just what farmers do. He doesn't want eggs, meat, poultry, or grains, from the farmers because of grocery stores. https://t.co/huN366KyNu
@TrumpsSonLives @Thomas1774Paine @McDonalds I was thinking of sending them down to the intersection of Haviture Way and Cowshit Lane to clean up the cow patties all over the place. And I really don't care if they went right or left, either way gets them deeper in dung.	McDonalds is paying more now than when I worked there https://t.co/PbWrap1eHl
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Where were you during the Obama Administrations detainment of Migrant Children under Inhumane Conditions? Turning your blind eye, because you were mighty silent while he did this. You SPEAK WITH A FORKED TONGUE, don't know how to tell the truth for the truth will set you free. https://t.co/mH945aRqKt
Do I think the Democrats need to be reminded about Obama's Inhumane Conditions for Migrant Children held at His Detainment Facility? You bet your Boot I do pardner. https://t.co/i5gPoc1ZMg
@Thomas1774Paine She's operating on a DOUBLE STANDARD. Doesn't realize some of us have things from his era for child detainment facility. Or was she asleep while this was going on? Either way, she's dead wrong about Obama. https://t.co/QaPHJi5uzX
@Thomas1774Paine Is he off his rocker or what? They don't make enough while they are in Congress that they have to sponge off of the rest of us? If he's that hard up, I guess he ought to go out and get a REAL JOB rather than take a dole from the rest of us. https://t.co/0646XVVVAk
@EdmundHulton That depends. The Regional Military Hospital is here at Eglin AFB, FL 32542	The bad thing with that hospital is that those wanting to retire come here finish their career and set-up shop near San Destin and Sea Side make even bigger bucks.
@WillWtroyer Ever wonder why MSM isn't trusted? Prime example for a reporter jumping to a conclusion and then it's discovered his report wasn't true. This comes from believing only one source rather than by backchecking the story for truth. Journalism schools aren't teaching reporting right. https://t.co/Jb53M2ivjT
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Boy, I hope that you aren't relying on pictures taken back in 2014 under the Obama Administration that supposedly got attached to Trump. Even he saw the date on the picture and knew that it came from Obama. Problem is there are No new photos, only old ones. Do You Have a Plan https://t.co/TOS0Es7mGG
@ihvurbk2 @LouDobbs @POTUS Well, Paul Ryan had better not Pee in the pool otherwise he might get a real surprise. https://t.co/qVvr6XzWrn
@EdmundHulton Florida, NW is my Home of Record for the military. Eglin AFB is within 10 miles of me. Hurlburt AFB on Fld #9 of Eglin is 2 miles West. 50 miles further West is Pensacola NAS, and Tyndall AFB is 75 Miles East. Go figure I'm surrounded. Registered Republican.
@EdmundHulton I went in the Navy in 1963, got out in 75 only to be in the Army during that same year. They saw that WO and thought I flew helicopters but found out I flew boats. 10 years later '85 I got out, went back to college got my Masters in '92 was recalled back tot he Navy 6.5 yrs = 28
@MSNBC @SRuhle Well, the First Family is staying in the spotlight, keeping you on your toes. But they have done another thing as well, they have managed to live in your brains. You attack, they retort, but they are winning by staying in your headlight. Every attack makes you look more FOOLISH. https://t.co/2eXvU1BJlH
@Thomas1774Paine Well, they are dropping off the table towards their own demise. Understanding the community you open a shop in, is key to its success. Going in not prepared is the preparation for closing the store. Some people need to be kicked in the seat of their pants to learn that lesson.
@EdmundHulton At 25 I was stationed aboard the USNS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It's a nice place to visit and the climate is very good. A couple of drawbacks,  no visiting Cuba for a visit and the normally 7" of rain in March, other than that it isn't a bad place. We had the USS JFK CV-67 in harbor
@Thomas1774Paine Hmm, seems I might have found something that they can use, if only ONCE. These two are going out on a limb, with an anchor to help hold them down. Michael Cohen is taking that raid a little bit hard, but if he's done nothing wrong, then he has nothing to worry about. https://t.co/EjIKlaMT8G
@seanhannity No kidding, the crap that Paul Ryan put forth was doomed to failure the moment it hit the floor. He wasn't trying to please anyone other than his wife to keep peace in the family since she's a DemocRAT. His wasn't really anything to pass in the first place. He took $$$ for HRC.
@NRA I was taught how to shoot a rifle when I was 7 by my Father. Once proficient, I went to an NRA meet in 1951. I still shoot a double-barrel shotgun, an S&amp;W-686 357 Mag. and a Glock model 19. That doesn't count a 1911.45 military issue and the M-16, 20 cal and 50 cal weapons.
@BigCatRescue Carole, hopefully, you didn't mind the Summer Salad recipe that I forwarded to you. I saw that and thought I remembered you had said something in that area of food group. Of course, if you want to send it on around. @hugh_gautier
@EdmundHulton I totally agree. I don't need to hear commentary that the MSM is calling news. To me, a commentary is something you use after you have given the news WITHOUT YOUR SPIN. That's why MSM isn't as trusted as they used to be. Sorry if I broke your bubble, but the truth is the truth.
@LouDobbs @POTUS Now if the rest of the REPUBLICANS are fed up with Ryans antics and remove him before he gives the speakership back to the DemocRATS, you might get this thing back on track Heck Ryans wife is a Democrat now where do you think his priorities are, really. Peace in his home is where
@nikkihaley Now that the Trump Administration was withdrawing the US from the UN Human Rights Council, make sure that NO US FUNDING GOES TO THEM EITHER.
@NYGovCuomo Awe, Gee you didn't say anything to the Obama Admin when they pulled the same thing. You are an Open Border Phreak who would get this country overrun and made to become a 3rd world country in no time. I suggest you read and then watch the ABC video on Obama dtd 2014. https://t.co/43Y3WqjHz2
@1GigiSims The study, checking sources for the truth of statements. Lots of deep background reading and study. When available I call on some of my friends who are still in MI and can bring in stuff that isn't classified. The last time someone checked my security clearance they were blocked
@Thomas1774Paine Seems that the MSM doesn't keep track of things that the Obama Administration Told Migrant Children and Families trying to cross the border back in 2014. I strongly suggest that you read and then watch the video from ABC News. But I doubt you will because it proves your wrong. https://t.co/id3St5XHfS
@1GigiSims Just think of eating cow manure, dry it falls apart, but wet it's worse than STP and White Lithium Grease combined. A putrid smell to boot.
@Golfinggary5221 @lilbulli1031 @smartiekat123 @jcpenni7maga @MareLovesUSA_00 @AngelLight2U @DineshDSouza @bbusa617 @ArizonaKayte @vachilly64 @Airbornex82nd It's past time to impeach him, now he needs to be arrested, and led out of the building in shackles and cuffs. 	He's involved in the Uranium One crap, Hillary, collusion, obstruction. Need I say more. Maryland would like to get to him as well for his antics there.
@1GigiSims Who seriously needs psychoanalytical help. They need to be buried up to their chins in cow poop and be handed a spoon so they can dig their way out of the mess. It also needs to be soupy slimy wet, the better for them to dig it out with. Should they get hungry, its food for them.
@bigleaguepol This dear friends is how the Deep State works behind your backs. Now Obama has left himself open for a TREASON charge along with his two more co-hearts. This is the person who still thinks he is the President, but he's not. Shouldn't there be men in White coats taking him away?
@JudicialWatch Nothing John McCain does anymore, especially since he lied about prisoners of war being left in North Viet-Nam. Too many of my buddies knew about that for him to sit back and open-faced lie about it.
@philadper2014 Now think, Mueller has Trump hating Democrat lawyers on his panel, who would you expect them to go after? The Democrats are giddy he's still doing it. While the Republicans act like they are being ruled by the other side instead of vice versa. Guys get your heads out of our asses
To Chuch Schumer and his Obstructionist friends, just picked this little ditty from Obama to Migrant Children Trying to Cross the Border In 2014. You might want to re-think your stance Hypocrites. https://t.co/qDZ8J9VTj8
@BigCatRescue Carole had an interesting piece viewed on Twitter. As for me getting close to any large animal, the only way will be through https://t.co/12GqFHzaqd and the shot I've attached. Don't mind the uniform or jet in the background https://t.co/rmrULX5kvF
@Thomas1774Paine He wants his cake and to be able to eat it. He's playing the illegal aliens against everyone but doesn't give a flipping fig about them. They are just talking points, he's not going to do anything for THEM EITHER. There are times I say to forgive, this isn't one of them. Weasel. https://t.co/0djW5gcjVI
@Thomas1774Paine Strange because back in 2009 Schumer came out with "People who enter the United States without permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered legally" Then in 2017 he said " The president's decision to end DACA was heartless" https://t.co/JCwjt4OjJW
If the upper level of the DOJ/FBI doesn't want to cooperate with lawful requests from Congress then DEFUND THEM. Do not allow DHS to fund them either until they cooperate completely. Congress HAS TOTAL OVERSIGHT OVER THE DOJ/FBI,, it's not the other way around. FIX IT NOW!
@RedNationRising Totally ignorant, quite possibly she'll want the governor's race abolished as well. Who are we fooling, it's the ignorant left not knowing or caring about this country of ours. They would give the entire thing away as long as it didn't hurt them. Maybe we should abolish the LEFT.
@SusanStormXO @realDonaldTrump @afbranco @CAS5050 @JenNongel @ClintonMSix141 @RealMAGASteve @DonnaWR8 @US_Threepers @evrgreensparky @phil4gop @RampsMAGARants @stacy_redvirgo You missed one MSNBC. https://t.co/0V8YKKU4CJ
@RedNationRising Just because it said former, doesn't mean that as a private citizen he can not file against her. According to the State of Florida, I'm not allowed to give out legal advice because I'm not a lawyer. I'm a retired military cop, But if I see something wrong I'll not give advice.
@AppSame @SenSchumer These are the type of people that DO NOT NEED TO HOLD OFFICE, Schumer is a two-faced liar, and Pelosi says one thing and BEVER FULFILLS HER PLEDGE, and This is how she gets re-elected. https://t.co/9LDoSpNVIq
@RedNationRising Seems it's about time to do some house cleaning at the DOJ. Her activism is hindering her ability to do her job correctly with NO BIAS. This is the same crap we are getting from the FBI, now it's gone to the DOJ. OPM might have to get involved to clear her totally, or charge her.
@RedNationRising Bernie needs to go to a country with a Socialist system and speak to the people being ruled under that kind of government before he decides that is what the United States needs. You, Sir, ARE AN IDIOT. A very dangerous one at that, Senator you are without the Brains GOD gave you.
@Thomas1774Paine Supporting a Child Rapist, plus he supports Roman Polanski's sex with a child. He's not right in the head and someone had better see to getting him help before he commits a crime that he can't buy his way out of. First, it was Hanoi Jane, now it's him supporting rapists.
@Thomas1774Paine Tell you what you DUMMIE go to Congo; Indonesia; N. Korea; China; Egypt; Hungary; Gambia; Kenya; Pakistan; Russia; Saudi Arabia; Syria; Venezuela; Yemen; Turkey; Myanmar and the bottom of the list is the US. ALL the rest are above us. But I found your picture in this line-up. https://t.co/tUz409qQSA
@EdmundHulton Now that's more plausible since they keep border jumping with impunity. This is what our DEMOCRAT party wants of our borders because the more illegals they get in the more illegal votes they'll get. That's their goal, and that is why they are fighting tooth and nail against it.
@katfellow @iamfonda He is truly a sick individual who needs to be institutionalized, till they can find out what has made him go off the deep end. It's a shame he wants to THROW AWAY HIS CAREER this way.
Is there any law against putting a tracking chip into DEPORTEES? This way should they come back, we could track their movements, possibly removing the entire gang. The chip would be like those used in cars or animals. It's non-lethal if placed close to the heart, no removal.
@BigCatRescue Well, I found a sign that you need on your fences that might make someone think before going across any fences. https://t.co/w5pYCIRrOT
@grizzlemeister Very Unstable is selling this NUT SHORT, He needs a visit from the FED's and a real wake-up call about 0300. If he had his way we'd be a 3rd world country which is what OBAMA was trying to do as well.
@REALBASEDBLONDE @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @POTUS Mr. Obama is going to put them up in his home since he won't be needing it because of the long expected trip he'll be taking to GITMO. He's going to give them supplemental incomes so the=at they don't have to lean on the Federal Govt. We just opened his doors to help you.
@RedNationRising Mr. Fonda needs to be put on a boat filled with venomous snakes, he'd feel right at home. Oh, and I didn't say how much fuel was aboard, just enough to get him out of radio range for help.
@BigCatRescue No, I haven't they aren't native to this country they can never be set free. A Leopard, Tiger, White Tiger, Lion, Servile, Sand Cat they were being used for props for people to pay for photos with a wild animal each for less than 3 months. Some were privately owned just too big.
@REALBASEDBLONDE @POTUS @jeffsessions @Jim_Jordan @gatewaypundit CUFF AND SHACKLE him, then DUCK WALK HIM OUT WHERE THE MEDIA CAN SEE IT.  So he's really not a goodie 2 shoes, he's highly colluded in the URANIUM ONE investigation. A DEEP STATE SWAMP CREATURE, who dispises TRUMP. He DOESNT DESERVE THE JOB HE'S HOLDING. Needs to clean GITMO. https://t.co/NFbvTQqnUA
@USA1stWins @WiredSources He is terminated for breaking rules 1801 and 1802 and then would not tell the truth when given the opportunity. So if he wants to blame anyone, he'd better point his finger at himself. He had so much animus towards the candidate then President Trump it could be seen by all,
@drawandstrike Of those in this picture, I see 3 who were paid by the Clinton campaign to work against @realDonaldTrump. One being the Speaker of the House.
@david_d1421 @FBI Today with Horowitz speaking to the House Intell Committee, he said there are 3 more individuals in the FBI who showed anti-Trump bias. Seems to me the entire 7th floor of the FBI was in serious trouble from the get-go. Under Comey's lack of correct leadership, they floundered.
@Thomas1774Paine Sounds like Comey's crap. Doing everything he can to get his way of using the FBI to his advantage. Setting up the AG so she would have to remove herself. Placing her [lying ass] trust in a LIAR named Comey.
@Trumpfan1995 @alozras411 @USAHotLips @Real_PeachyKeen @MAGARoseTaylor @RuthieRedSox @MEL2AUSA @ConservaMomUSA @CB618444 @ArizonaKayte @polishprincessh STRZOK's lawyer would have you believe that he didn't have any animus towards the candidate and then President Trump.  Really, how stupid do you think we are? I've been a law enforcement officer both in the military and locally. So feed me another line of BS so I can swat it down
@foxandfriends Got new for that twerp who put that out. I hold a BA in Theology and an MA in Industrial Computers Robotics and Electronics Engineering. I also served in the military for 28 years. Education test rating is 93% of a Ph.D. in History. I've taught Seniors Algebra, and you said what?
@Thomas1774Paine What STUPIDITY. Removing those portraits of long-deceased men, because of COLOR. Their COLOR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DID FOR THE HUMAN RACE. They didn't only treat Whites they treated everyone. The person who can up with this idea needs to be FIRED, not applauded.
@kwilli1046 They were there when Kennedy was President. It's most likely with enough truthful digging it'll come out that the DEEP STATE back then was responsible for his death as well. So it doesn't surprise me when you even mentioned that. What bothers me is the animus of investigators.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Well Ted, if your side would do things that were constructive rather than being total JACKASSES and obstructionist about things that will help the American people (optimum word is American) not illegals since they aren't here legally by any stretch of the imagination. WALL Build.
Mr. @POTUS your AG is supposed to uphold the law NOT MAKE NEW LAW and then act like it's a real law. There is NO LAW that takes children away from parents, his quoting the Bible doesn't hold water for LAW. Have him bring out the law that says exactly what he did is correct.
@WiredSources No kidding McCabe was behind that little by of crap. And he wonders why he got the AXE before he could retire.
@Thomas1774Paine Well with NO UNDER OATH, means he could be spinning lies that sound plausible but it really is NOT THE TRUTH. Having to be under "Oath" means if he spins out a lie, he'll go directly to JAIL, [(do not pass go) as in Monopoly]. It will put him in jeopardy should he lie.
@MSNBC @QuinnipiacPoll Well, there is no law under the Clinton Admin which separated children from adults. Your AG instituting something making up a law which isn't because he can't blame it on Clinton or Obama. He might be able to go to the Bush Admin but doesn't really have any legs to stand on.
Well now, there is no law under the Clinton Admin which separated children from adults. Your AG instituting something making up a law which isn't because he can't blame it on Clinton or Obama. He might be able to go to the Bush Admin but doesn't really have any legs to stand on.

@RedNationRising A sicko who needs to locked up and then have the keys thrown into the smelter. Or throw the book at him and give him term and a day, meaning no parole till he's served the entire sentence +1 day.
@EdmundHulton Something smells fishy with Huber and Horowicz working together, Huber, if he stays in Utah, won't be able to properly do the work he's supposed to do. Horowicz says he's not finished doing the Clinton email investigation, how is going to be two different things at the same time.
@IngrahamAngle Leave it to the Dems to EXPLOIT THIS LOOPHOLE, to them it's voters no matter they aren't legal
@Surinam99 Well now, there is no law under the Clinton Admin which separated children from adults. It is Your AG instituting making up law which come back and bite you, Somewhere, he'd [AG Sessions] better be able to show where this idea came from, It's not Clinton or Obama.
@EdmundHulton They are IDIOTS trying to blame a law that was passed by a DEMOCRAT led Congress during and signed in 1997 under the Clinton's Admin. 	The AG: Janet Reno	The President: Bill Clinton	NOT TRUMP	So TRUMP'S DHS	Is NOT Pointing Assault Weapons at children, but CLINTON's DID.

@EdmundHulton Now you understand why when I type DemocRATS those last 4 letters are in CAPS. It wasn't an error but on purpose. They want more taxes, more regulations, more dependencies on the Government so they can make us followers. I like my independence and won't follow.
@jasoninthehouse My Monday started at 0300 by 0500 I was at a dialysis treatment. Now I'm firing up folks on Twitter. Who either do know or remember the Law about child removal was under Bill Clintons watch signed 1997. 	The AG: Janet Reno	The President: Bill Clinton	NOT TRUMP	Understand?
@Thomas1774Paine Devin has to know and understand these people are still working against @POTUS and they are all Republicans both in the House and Senate. Some ran against him and lost. Names: Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Sen McCain, and Sen Graham.

@NBCNews Look at the Law where-by children are separated from their parents, it was under BILL CLINTON'S watch. It was passed in 1997, so you have a DEMOCRAT CONGRESS WHO PASSED THAT LAW.	The AG: Janet Reno	The President: Bill Clinton	NOT TRUMP

@RedNationRising I sent this to the DNC it ought to MAKE their day, don't you think.
@Thomas1774Paine Here's the problem, we've forgotten history like back to the Crusades,	During the Crusades what did the Western society do to the Islamist world? We tried and failed miserably to impose our culture on them. Well, folks. The Islamists are invading our world and we are letting them
@Sheckyi Here's a better thought electrified fence with razor wire strung its full length. Next, anyone who is to be deported is micro tracking chipped. Then if/when they come we get them and their friends deported.

@EdmundHulton But for you of Faith, GOD WILL OVERCOME. There is a penalty to be paid for Blaspheming the name of the LORD. As I recall it goes sort of like this: VENGENCE IS MINE SAYTH THE LORD. Just look at their picture. https://t.co/7qInyxrWlV
@EdmundHulton Boy isn't that the truth. But she needs to be JAILED for Lying to Congress, Killing 4 Diplomats in Benghazi, deleting 33000 emails under subpoena, being a pervert [folks forget she went to that island as well].

@BuzzPatterson @BreitbartNews Chelsea, ye of little knowledge of history, especially your Father's should know that we do know who's law that was. Now if you are advocating for anything I would think you'd have to run for Congress and get those DemocRATS to do their JOBS or leave Congress. Las passes 1997. https://t.co/FccRmRhL6U
I have a question for all of the political scholars out here. During the Crusades what did the Western society do to the Islamist world?  	Now reverse what is happening. The Islamists are invading our world because we won't allow prosecuted people to be harmed. Sound familiar?
@realDonaldTrump Just don't do what President Herbert Hoover in 1930, Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act President Herbert Hoover signs the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which boosts U.S. tariffs to historically high levels, prompting foreign retaliation.  That would not be helpful if it brings on a trade war
@christianllamar @DevinNunes @RepGoodlatte @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz @HouseJudiciary @HouseIntelComm @RepLeeZeldin @LouieGohmertTX1 Rosenstein is to deeply involved in the FISA Warrant crap, enlarging Mueller's probe from Russia to anything else that could impeach @POTUS.

@raymysterio305 It's been corrupt from the get-go. Rosenstein needs to be put down as well, he's deeply involved in that he signed a FISA Warrant against the sitting @POTUS. That alone is enough to disqualify him, but he's also involved in the Uranium One crap as well. We to look into him deeply
@kwilli1046 Let them serve their sentences and DE{PORT IMMEDIATELY. That means on release day have ICE at the prison and rearrest them for being illegally in this country. https://t.co/o5jOeAIcvb

He's not only a liar but a hypocrite. He believed Hillary but you ought to see what she says about Democrats. https://t.co/5mbW4Q0dJr
@Thomas1774Paine Like Mudd John. She not only broke the law when she lied to Congress. But she and her aides deleted subpoenaed emails by Congress, and yes she knew they  were the objects that Congress wanted, https://t.co/j9fBXSR3wY
@ThisWeekABC Hold on there ABC you are mixing a CLINTON Admin Law and saying that @POTUS should disobey the Law. But lets fix the problem the Democrats made in the first place. Don't push obeying the law onto Trump because they are following it to the letter of the law. https://t.co/A3sz90FSuj

@LadyChesapeake @Thomas1774Paine Well, I do know the military overpowered a CIA base here on US ground, that was just after Trump had moved into the WH. No news came from it so they might have thwarted whatever was going on at the time. I've also said I DO NOT TRUST ROSENSTEIN after his expanding Meullers probe.
@cheri4trump Ah but I'm a Republican, who happens to be older than the current President. Oops, there you go jumping to conclusions without the facts. I was born 12 days after VJ Day and I'll leave that for you to figure out. I have 28-years military service 100% disabled. https://t.co/nCtJEJze5n
@TheGameOfLife @mortenbc58 @MSNBC I don't work for them. I'm a 100% disabled Vet who happens to be 10 months older than the President is. But I've watched and listened to Acosta's badgering and other crap. Like I said he needs to be escorted out of the room. Why don't you get MSM to tell REAL NEWS not fake news
@Thomas1774Paine No collusion with those agents, huh? What kind of agent is this, he investigatedHillary's emails, he did the Flynn investigation, and went on to the Meuller probe. This agent has no responsibility to be investigating anything, but he does need to be JAILED for the damage done.
@lmchristi1 @NRA There are far too few Conservative teachers in this country to undo what the liberal have done to our children. When I was 60ish there was a college professor told me that I needed to be teaching Windows because he'd learned something from me. I'd taught Algebra to Seniors.
@TheGameOfLife @mortenbc58 @MSNBC I don't make threats to the FREE PRESS, but they need to have some form of MANNERS and JIM ACOSTA doesn't have any. If he doesn't get an answer he wants he hounds and won't stop. That is when he needs to be escorted out of the room in front of the press corps.
@MSNBC She's right, but it was the Bill Clinton Admin who had started this mess in the first place. Where was their consternation when he did it? Trump is following a STUPID LAW that the DemocRATS made. Now you figure out how to correct what those RATS did. https://t.co/fw31ZTy7wb
@RedNationRising Here's a picture of a liar, not only did he lie to the @POTUS, but he lied to Congress. That is a jailable offense and he's not above the law. He can be jailed for that offense, and any others he has committed. https://t.co/8BZ2Q47DwB
@JayGrimes18 Cockatiels do that, but I use Lixit's for the bird's water distribution. They can't crap into the water. You might want to try the solution I use. Oh, and BTW, I've hand raised 95 baby Cockatiels. 5 Lutinos, 1 Albino White-faced, 6 Beige Pearl, the rest normals. 2 Quaker Parrots
@MSNBC I have 2 questions for you to explain to the American people if you can correctly. You do remember Bill Clintons Admin,. Why did he have armed personel go in with guns and remove children from illegals? How are you putting it onto @POTUS when he didn't make the law? https://t.co/kyBPXevllo
@Acosta I have an easy question for you. Do you remember back to the Bill Clinton Administration? Where he sent people with Guns to take children away from their parents. Now you are trying to blame @POTUS for something that started during the Clinton Admin. What happened? https://t.co/lEHrRs91qK

@hmmidontthinkso @REALtrumpbureau @Jim_Jordan Rod Rosenstein is part of the Uranium One crap and don't try telling me he wasn't. He, at the time, was prosecuting in Maryland and they would love to get to him for the antics he pulled while there. He's not goodie 2 shoes. He signed a FISA Warrant against @POTUS, so lets stop.
@hmmidontthinkso @REALtrumpbureau @Jim_Jordan I've lost confidence in the UPPER LEVELS of both organizations. The rank and file are hard-working people, but that upper level was anything but. They allowed themselves to work against someone else's political party campaign, wiretapped,, spied on from the start. Not legal.
@President45US I want you to look at what Chuck Schumer has said about illegals, and I want him to know YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. Illegal is still illegal Chuck, so you are going to have to go to that table and really do something about it or LOSE YOUR JOB. It's simple to fix, now do it. https://t.co/swgZF3x8Uj
@President45US but it's the left during the Clinton Administration who created this debacle. So the @POTUS was correct when he stated that it was the Democrats who had created this is the first place. Now, they want to blame Trump for this crap. Try again knuckleheads cause you are dead wrong. https://t.co/JLrE32tF9t
@Thomas1774Paine Paul Ryan was BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY THE CLINTON FOUNDATION to thwart @POTUS any way he could. It's about time that someone who has more authority than I have say something about his CRAP. His wife is a Democrat, so where do you think he's going to come from? REMOVE PAUL RYAN. https://t.co/WV7Apx49pT
@poconomtn @SenBobCorker I'd rather have a President who keeps what he said he'd do than to have talking points crammed down my throat. Nothing ever gets done. That is what the DemocRATS have done every time they got elected. Awe, sorry to burst your bubble, but look around what have they done for you? https://t.co/KTQc6dg4tp
@grizz_meister @THEHermanCain @realDonaldTrump I have a habit of making the four letters of democrats in caps because that is what they are.

Those are only talking points, well Trump's talking points are being fulfilled. https://t.co/0nEzirJ6hl
@RobertMueIIer Why, are you tied up in that as well? If so, then it needs to be brought out into the open for everyone to see. I understand that you'll do anything to get a conviction, be it legal or illegal. I'm thinking Whitey Bulger where you framed 4 men who were innocent, they went to jail
@MSNBC Now, that is funny. Because MSNBC doesn't know how to do any true reporting. At least they don't have the Pouty Jim Acosta. He's going to learn a hard lesson as will other WH Press Members. I can just see him being escorted out of the room in front of that press corps.
@Thomas1774Paine At that point, Obama started getting the DEPT of JUSTICE to work outside its purview. This is getting the FBI and then the CIA involved. Corrupt officials were willing to do anything to stop the Trump charge. Obama  is the same person who said he had not wiretapped Trump.
@426_ghost So what's new. Meuller is still trying to impeach the sitting @POTUS so go figure. They are COLLUDED and have interfered in more things than they want anyone to know about. Meuller and his ilk are willing to do anything to get a conviction (by any means) they don't use law right
@NumbersMuncher I don't buy this report as it's been put out after the FBI reworded it. Mr. Rosenstein this is part of your doing since you didn't want anyone to really know the truth. WE [CITIZENS OF THE US] NEED THE ORIGINAL VERSION BEFORE YOU EVER SO CAREFULLY REWORDED IT. This is a fraud.

@Thomas1774Paine Mrs. Pelosi needs a refresher course from her predecessor whom she backed. It's about time these TWO-FACED DEMS TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY DID. It wasn't the Trump Admin who passed the law, it was Bill Clinton. https://t.co/1FwJUoyUO2
@Thomas1774Paine Go for it, it's about time someone had some guts. But we need to go after a few more party Traitors as well. Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsay Graham. All received money from the Clinton Foundation.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Dear old Ted doesn't want to remember the Clinton Admin when they did this to all illegal immigrants coming into the country, but they are more than willing to lay THEIR SCREWUP on Trump. I'm old enough to remember that TED, where were you, in diapers? https://t.co/F4IAaojiIb
@Thomas1774Paine Only if he really did what Meuller has represented. But Meuller has a reputation for holding information back from defenses, his attorneys will do anything (even illegal) to get a conviction. So the judge had better be very aware of the dirty tricks Meuller has played in the past
@Dust_Off70 @AndrewCMcCarthy I don't buy this report as it's been put out after the FBI reworded it. Mr. Rosenstein this is part of your doing since you didn't want anyone to really know the truth.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear Ted, those were areas that you knew you would win. Governorships don't vote in the House or Senate. Why don't you go back to CA, and get a real job for a change rather than stonewall good legislation as you have been doing? Yeah, I know 2 wrongs don't make a right either. https://t.co/NiBXB4CO7z
@RealitySmash Which I did last night. It ought to make her day. Also, give her a thought that all of these Islamic immigrants might not really be immigrants in the long run. Think of this as what the Christians did during the Crusades in early times. They are doing that to us destroying us.
@Thomas1774Paine Verify before letting up on anything. This business of giving something when nothing was given is the same CRAP.	As for North Korea, we are giving him something for a breakable promise. That is the same thing that was done for his Father and Gr-Father and it went for naught.
@Queen_Europe Something really neat to remember about your refugee problem, that you have brought onto yourselves. The Islamists are on a preplanned invasion because we can't let persecuted people go back where they came from. So Europe has that problem and we have MS-13 etc. https://t.co/Tk0byy4oEy
@REALBASEDBLONDE @RepMattGaetz Rod, I have the sneaking hunch you opened up Mr. Mueller's warrant which was not the original setup, so you are trying to get the sitting President impeached by hook or crook. If you have done anything wrong, you can be removed as can your bloodhound who also has Uranium One
@Thomas1774Paine But if law enforcement can get in so can someone else, so this is a two-way street and they are taking it off of the market to stop others who would do harm. While I do not own an iPhone by choice, The "Smart" phone is only as smart as the person inputting to it. THINK PEOPLE!!
@Sheckyi But he ought to be glad no one is yelling at him, or making fun of him. Now he should take himself out of the spotlight and become a student again. One thing he is is a little bit wiser from all of the mostly unwanted attention he garnered by his ranting. He isn't a 2nd A scholar
@RepMattGaetz I'm sorry but since they have reworded the memo on Clinton's Email, but I don't buy this report as it's been put out after the FBI reworded it. Mr. Wray and Mr. Rosenstein this is part of your doing since you didn't want anyone to really know the truth. We need to see an original
@RepMattGaetz To the DOJ/FBI, WE WANT TO SEE THE ORIGINAL REPORT, NOT THE ONE THAT WAS CAREFULLY REWORDED TO TAKE WRONGDOINGS OFF OF THE TABLE. I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS, BECAUSE I DO KNOW THAT OTHER STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY REWORDED SO AS TO AVOID JAILABLE OFFENSES. I AM PISSED.
@RealitySmash Better still is to take a screenshot of this and periodically put it up where it'll be seen, over and over. Might even send it to Angela Merkel..
@President45US I have not missed it I've been watching it unfold. If you want me to believe that the FBI didn't rewrite that OIG Report so that it didn't look so damning on them, then you are going to be sadly mistaken. They need to bring out the original without the changes that they have made https://t.co/YS3SOYLSCX
@BreitbartNews Jim Acosta is OVERPAID spoiled brat who has no decency. If he doesn't like an answer he hounds till he's been shut up. In actuality, he needs to be led out of the WH Press Room and told not to come back. That belittling would stick in his craw he'd do it again, this time-barred.

@RobertMueIIer Jails will get them fired and they can lose pension as well. But that OIG Report once gotten into the FBI hands was rewritten so as to take responsibility for jailable offenses.

@TGowdySC In the case of the FBI working through be careful that they didn't redact the OIG Report before you've seen it.  Your friend Rod Rosenstein had his grubby hands on that document. You might want to see the original before the FBI touched it.
@MikePenceVP Good grief, does anyone remember Uranium One, which both she and Bill are tied up in. You know the crap that sold 20% of our uranium to Russia. I'm like an elephant, I remember and take copious notes and photos. Yeah she lied, she killed an ambassador, lied to Congress. JAIL HER. https://t.co/6kqSMnPhLF
@phil4gop Remove Rosenstein he's so conflicted and colluded. He's involved in the Uranium One crap and the State of Maryland would like to get to him because of his antics while he was there as well.
@AndrewCMcCarthy You mean she got what she deserved for not using a SECURE SERVER.  Her home computer system is NOT as secure as that the State Department was using, but then she would not be able to put her pay to play on that. She still seems to think she's above the law and that needs to END
While Comey might take to Twitter to make his case, he still lied to Congress. That by itself is a jailable offense and that isn't covered by the OIG. So even when he says he didn't commit a referable offense, he did when he lied to Congress. Mr. Comey, I found your FIB picture. https://t.co/DKtD1qOUAw
@Thomas1774Paine He hears only what he wants to hear, then puts in something to make it seem like that's what was said. He doesn't care what he does or says or who he hurts in the process. He needs to learn three things: 1. HE'S NOT IN CHARGE. 2. MANNERS. 3. STOP LOSING HIS TEMPER. GROW UP.
@maryannstewart1 @MacBetty @KNP2BP @Harlan @realDonaldTrump In that case, he needs to switch parties and get out of the Speaker of the House position. If he's going to do things that are not helpful to the Republican Party, then switch and see how fast he gets re-elected. He isn't helping the Republicans at all.
@Thomas1774Paine Considering that she kept supplies on the docks and didn't distribute it shows she's an IDIOT, but not only that she's a DemocRAT and she proved it to the people of her city.

@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows But the rest of your colleagues are afraid of the DOJ/FBI. It's like they are hiding their heads in the sand.

@Jim_Jordan He needs to own up to his shortcomings. Good for  House Oversight Committee members Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and responded to Sessions’ lame defense of Rosenstein. He said Sessions doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  “I’m here to tell you,” he added, “we’re fed up with it.”

"If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in." The Acosta Rule WH liked it
@IWillRedPillU MSM doesn't want to know about real news. They would rather bash Trump than to tell about real news stories. And they wonder why we don't trust them. So with that said, this picture fits them perfectly. https://t.co/HWbkldrbBh
@Thomas1774Paine Last time I checked my insurance bill would be almost double what I get for Social Security. That's WRONG and should never have been signed as a bill. As I recall, Nancy Pelosi said we had to pass it to see what's inside the bill. What a FARCE, the Affordable Care Act was.
@SaltyPatriot12 Perfect for that knucklehead, actually he has "foot in mouth" disease. He opens his mouth and crap dribbles out. He has a potty mouth.  So this picture says volumes. https://t.co/GAFFcF8cPH
It should be all-inclusive meaning everyone will have the same thing. Several years ago Florida went to the federal-based ID Card. So I'm speaking from knowledge of that new ID Card. https://t.co/aY71PK5XOo
@Thomas1774Paine Does he have "foot in mouth" disease?  So with the picture below, he might need to think before he says something that's derogatory about another group. I know that I'll most likely get hate messages from those I don't even know or even follow. https://t.co/RIVkLQfTLo
@AnthemRespect @realDonaldTrump @PressSec He needs to remember the old saying, Open Mouth, Insert Foot and close your mouth. This is called Foot-in-Mouth disease. He would look like an idiot since he runs his mouth before he doesn't think before starting to talk. https://t.co/0vx23oymOq
@RedNationRising Very good and I like it. I have one that will make folks stop and think. https://t.co/XlwfhARXQ4
@ScotsFyre As for Polio Pioneer, getting the real polio shots, that was done in1950-51 time frame. I was in the first grade at the time. That'll give you an idea of the correct time frame when this medication was made and Polio was broken. Does that help you when it was done?
@ScotsFyre As a Polio Pioneer, (Yeah, I got the real medication over a period of 6 weeks, my Sister got sugar water shots.), I find that bit of information disheartening. Socialized medicine is WORTHLESS if this is what they are willing to do to the people.
@Thomas1774Paine Well, then it is ABOUT TIME FOR A SUBPOENA FOR ALL RECORDS FROM THE FBI STARTING IN DECEMBER 2014 THROUGH THE PRESENT. NO REDACTIONS WHAT-SO-EVER. THEY PROVED THEY LIE TO TRY TO SAVE FACE, NOW WE GO AFTER THE KABAL. YOU ARE DONE. IT'S OVER SOMEONE WILL BE JAILED.
@AP_PATRIOT The ones that Mr. Mueller's goons have been pressuring you mean. Don't forget James Comey–and it appears Robert Mueller as well–are willing to engage in illegal acts to win convictions,” They will make sure “whatever needs to be done to get that conviction,” He's a ‘Dirty Cop.’
@PressSecSanders Isn't it nice to know some folks pay attention to small details. You might not have spotted it, so I took a screenshot picture of the retraction from CNN. aka [Clinton News Network] that fits their stupidity best. https://t.co/mg2YoYSUGX
@PhxKen Obama never had any intention of doing anything to save people, that would be against the Quran that allows him to MURDER, STEAL, CHEAT, LIE as long as it furthered his religion. When you know what his parameters are, then you can see exactly what kind of President he was. COWARD
@Mike_Press19 Anything Michael Douglas or has his greasy hands in needs to be boycotted. If he loses lots of money, he might have to rethink his stupid postures. Butter still he needs a rude awakening 2 years in Military service should do the trick. Lots of LATRINE DETAIL with a toothbrush.
@PradRachael @BreitbartNews Pelosi, retire, heck she can't afford to live in CA with all of the TAXES THE DEMOCRAT STATE HOUSE PASSED AND GOV BROWN SIGNED. There are more people on the streets now cause they can't afford to live in a house. They have let illegals take over and are trying to buy them out.
To the Democrats in Congress, you need to realize Obama is not in charge now. There's a new Sheriff in town and you'd better figure out what true patriotism is. It wasn't done by any of your Administrations. So, you are flunking on anyone  who is following your party.
@brithume Meet the Deep State in the US Congress. They are responsible for supposedly getting things done for ALL of the CITIZENS in the country. These 4 people are supposed to be "smart", they certainly aren't that. They  have both parties covered and will do the right thing, NOT, FOOLS.
@kathygriffin @TheRoot Then, you'd better stay away from the "View", they can drag you down.
Awe just look at it this way Ohio. Make the State ID Card mandentory it will show the address of the person; picture (Very Important); signature; and can be used when asked for an ID. This can significantly reduce illegal voting.
@MSNBC This is GR8, because it will remove those who are dead from the rolls, thereby eliminating those who aren't eligible to vote from voting.  A Voter ID Card is easier than you'd think to use. Go get a State ID card it'll prove where you live and have your picture as well on it.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear Ted, Obama isn't the Sheriff now, there's a new one demanding everyone plays fair, that isn't in your playbook I guess. It's time you learned that if you brag about cheating and get caught there's a penalty to be paid. That happened to the Childish Trudeau, he killed NAFTA.
@Thomas1774Paine Ah, but she did try and tried doing it against the Capitol Police, which wasn't very bright move in the first place. It drew attention to her, which was not her idea. The people in her dist need to recall her. Her elevator doesn't stop on all floors. 1 brick shy of a full load.
@realDonaldTrump As for Justin Trudeau, he's a childish brat trying to keep the status quo. You know the agreement Obama made. Well as I told him there a new Sheriff in town. And if you want to play chicken don't blink, cause you'll lose. he's at least 36 years younger than we are. Not grown-up.
@MAGA_1958 Now why would I call him childish, could it be he's at least 36 years my junior? Doesn't know his friends from his enemies. Really screwed up when he thought the status quo was all right after all Obama approved it. But Obama is not in charge, there's a new Sheriff in charge.
@MAGA_1958 Trudeau is 46 and is a CHILDISH IDIOT willing to try and play chicken with a person who doesn't blink. He's willing to KILL NAFTA because of greed. Heck, they had been charging almost 325% tariffs on US Farm Produce. What a lame-brain they have elected as a PM for the country.
@stephen_taylor @davidd_dds I'm not making fun of FALSE EYEBROWS, I'm making fun of his CHILDISH THINKING that during NAFTA they could charge 325% tariff in US Farm Produce and get away with it. As far as I'm concerned @POTUS was right to sever NAFTA. Trudeau is a CHILDISH IDIOT.
@AnnBobby2 @Thomas1774Paine U.S. taxpayers footed a $101 million court award to the four men framed for murders committed by (Mueller FBI operated) Bulger gang.” “whatever needs to be done to get that conviction,” James Comey and it appears Robert Mueller as well are willing to engage in illegal acts to win
@AnnBobby2 @Thomas1774Paine bureau helped convict the four men of a crime they did not commit, and the three of them had been sentenced to die in the electric chair. In 1972 their death sentences were lifted they were still serving life. US taxpayers footed a $101 million court award to the four men framed.
@President45US Because he's a gr8 patsy, going after the news media would put them behind the eight ball. What we should go after is those individuals who leaked the info to the news media.
@DemolitionRanch  Matt, you'll most likely get a call from Apau Hawaii Tours, the guy who owns it is looking for someone to make shirts for him. I gave him your name and mentioned the Bunker which is where your screen print shop is, who knows this might help you make some cash.
@Thomas1774Paine He should know better, anyone with common sense can look up all of his antics to just before Boston back in the '70's to his part in the Enron debacle. It took 40 years to prove that the FBI had killed the guy the 4 innocent men got life sentences for, 1 had died in prison
@FIGHTINGVETERAN Lock 'em all up. But the term of the sentence needs +1 day added to the term. Meaning that there is NO Parole, no early out for good behavior, the entire sentence plus that all important day is to be served. This used to be in place several decades ago and it stopped them cold.
@Thomas1774Paine Either sell off buildings we don't own or buy them. Better yet sell the buildings and release the people who were in those buildings. Now be careful that you are not doing it to the courts, then selling buildings doesn't make good sense.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump He wants to lie about the tariffs they have on US Farm Produce trying with a straight face to say that 325% tariff which was in place when NAFTA went into effect was good for both countries, He's broken the NAFTA agreement. He's a child not caring about anything, not the people.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Angela and the "One World Order" can go find some peyote and smoke it, they'd feel like they had better luck. We don't have to follow the Eu's ruled because we are not part of the EU. That group can "Go Fly A Kite" as far as I'm concerned.
@SusanStormXO What with knuckleheads like George Soros trying to back every liberal person running for DA, those people got beaten a rather soundly. If we can keep Soros and his minions out of our elections that would be gr8.
@RodStryker Why not, she's not above the law as much as she'd like to think she is. But she'll have company so she doesn't have to fret about being alone. Who knows she might Obama for a block mate. But she'll have to have a job that fits her personality. I can think of a good one toilets.
@longcolt45 @bbusa617 Tell you what let's DEPORT PELOSI and all who want to support her STUPIDITY. She can't even figure out spending $25B for a wall will save $110 B what a shame she's that demented.
@anitanarvaez18 @MSNBC He rescinding Obamas orders which ARE NOT BILLS PASSED INTO LAW. But this one is a law, there is quite a difference at that point.	Here's the rub a bill that is passed and signed is a LAW, it isn't an order. Big difference, got it.
@anitanarvaez18 @MSNBC The DOJ/ICE is not going to break a law because it's a bad law they are going to make the Dems eat their bill, get a new one passed that puts those families back together. The Dems made that piss-poor law and didn't care during the Obama Admin, now Trump has it and he's obeying.
@anitanarvaez18 @MSNBC It's a law passed by the Dems during the Obama Admin and trump is obeying it to the letter. He's also pointed out that Pelosi was the one in charge at the time. She's screaming about the breaking up of families and not mentioning they are guilty of passing that in the 1st place
@GSDAlpha Roosevelt was President when I was born 12 days after VJ day. Trump is the 14th president since I was born. I just have a few on you. The thing with us is that we are more mature than some of these supposedly learned politicians and I'll tell them they are stupid too.
@DemolitionRanch I don't use my Droid "Smart" phone for anything internet or dealing with MONEY. Especially since Verizon said the "Smart" phone is only as smart as the person inputting into it. The screen is too small to see much in the first place, but this 27" monitor works gr8 on my desktop.
@GovMikeHuckabee Justin Trudeau is just finding out he KILLED the NAFTA AGREEMENT with their 325% US Farm Produce tariffs. But Trudeau is a CHILD and I called him that. Even the @POTUS is 10+months younger than I am which makes Mr. Trudeau at least 36+ years younger. I might be old but not stupid
@Thomas1774Paine In that case, it might not have really been a suicide either. Better start looking into who was seeing him. If she's involved, it might be hard to prove since most of the people who died were all ruled as suicides.
@PhxKen I like that but you could call it this: Clinton News Network as well and you'd have the answer in front of you for their FAKE NEWS.
@realDonaldTrump Based on his lying and the 325% USFarm Produce tariff, I told him he just KILLED NAFTA. By acting childish, he is btw at least 36 years younger than both the @POTUS and me, I have Mr. Trump by at least 10+ months.
@RedNationRising @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump You should see what I said to Trudeau about the 325% tariff of US farm produce. I told him he killed NAFTA because of his childishness. I called him a Child since he's 36 years younger than I am.
@JustinTrudeau You are a child compared to me. I was born 12 days after VJ Day. You are 46 now so figure it out, Roosevelt was President when I was born. But lying about that 325% tariff of US Farm produce has just killed your opportunity at reconsilazition for NAFTA. Bright move
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JustinTrudeau 325% tariff on farm produce, is asinine and it's the best thing not to endorse anything coming out of that conference if they don't want to tell the truth.  It's high time we stood up for ourselves and stopped letting e1 over-run us. This kind of crap has gone on long enough.
@C_3C_3 Mr. Schiff better start looking over his shoulders else he be picked up as an accessory to the felony of colluding with the Clinton campaign against @realDonaldTrump. He's known all along that "Dossier" was a fake and a fraud, as is he. See if you can find a rock to hide under https://t.co/NsTNKiDmLS
@Thomas1774Paine Doesn't matter if he's there or not, it isn't legal too randomly shoot just because you don't happen to dislike a person. Hopefully, they'll throw the book at him and give him all he deserves to get. He'd better be glad I'm not the judge because I'd add 1 day to the sentence.
@drawandstrike Now lets fire all the rest of Obama's minions trying to wreak havoc for the Trump admin. The more gotten rid of those left by Obama the better. Now check the rest of the committees for more leakers, and arrest them.
@SebGorka I sent this to Pelosi I would like to think that you can see the economy is booming, unemployment is at an all-time low, that includes for women. But the problem is YOU and the DEMOCRATS AREN'T TAXING E1 TO DEATH OVER IT. It's time you figured out this isn't your Admin in charge.
@ggeett37aaa They'll find it in GITMO and it's waiting for some of these RATS:	Jake Sullivan; Tim Cain (D-VA); Perkins Coie Atty. Matthew J. Gehringer; Marc Elias; Brian Fallon; John Podesta; Huma Abedin; Robby Mook; Joel Benenson; Maya Harris; Ann O'Leary; Jake Sullivan; and Brian Fallon;
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Thoughts for You TED:	Hillary Clinton	Perkins Coie Atty.

@NancyPelosi I would like to think that you can see the economy is booming, unemployment is at an all-time low and that includes for women. But the problem is YOU and the DEMOCRATS AREN'T TAXING E1 TO DEATH OVER IT. It's time you figured out this isn't your Admin in charge.
@Thomas1774Paine I can't believe a TRAITOR who left Americans in North Viet-Nam and told the US authorities there weren't anymore there. He's a liar, who had his Father bury his paperwork deep where it won't be found. But my friends know better they were there, while I served on the USNS GITMO.
@MSNBC Well, you can thank the DemocRATS for that, it was their bill that is being followed to the letter. Now if they want to correct their mistake, they'll need to go to the table and hold REAL IMMIGRATION TALKS.
I scored 96% on the "Can You Name These American Animals?" quiz.  How will you do? https://t.co/tGZ0ffjPdx
@Tall_6ft8_guy @JustinBrannan @NRA Not quite you foolish knucklehead, there are still some of us who know what a BULLY look like. The NRA did nothing for you to be upset with, but that is exactly how STUPID and CHILDISH you sound. The "AR" isn't an assault rifle, but it's the initials of ArmaLite Rifle inventors.
@drawandstrike Now, do you go after the sleep-in since she's the one who got most of what was given out? It might put a stain on the "Daily Caller" since she worked/is working for them still.
@President45US Most likely since he's a Muslim and he is allowed to lie cheat steal and murder through the "Holy Quran" as long as it helps promote his religion. He held an apology tour to all of the Muslim nations or didn't you remember that. I wouldn't have put it past Bush to have known.
@SpeakerRyan @Boeing @McDonalds @Walmart @Disney @kroger Oh yeah, and that's why Disney has Pedophiles working around children, right? Something is wrong with this scenario and you aren't doing anything to protect the youngsters from these kinds of people with our children. Where is your sense of responsibility, here?
@Thomas1774Paine No kidding, it took you this long to figure it out? This is why everything up there runs so slowly. If the Congress would do their jobs respectively there would not be the rancor between the parties. But the Special Prosecutor is still trying he can. You can SHUT HIM DOWN...NOW!
@Thomas1774Paine If he's "so" innocent, why does he need an immunity? The reason is, he's not innocent. He was caught in more than one lie even to the DOJ/OIG. Plead the 5th give us a different idea of what really happened with the FBI and investigation of Hillary Clinton on the presidential run.
@jasoninthehouse I sent this to @SpeakerRyan: Are you trying your best to get DemocRATS elected in the mid-terms? If not then you'd better get your membership in line stop watering it down. I know you HATE @POTUS, but he is the President. Do the job or get out.
@SpeakerRyan Are you trying your best to get DemocRATS elected in the mid-terms? If not then you'd better get your membership in line stop watering it down. I know you HATE @POTUS, but he is the President. You should have gotten over that, but you haven't. Do th ejob or get out.
@jeffsessions You take the mothers of unlawful migrants, lock them up and ship their children to other states. What would you do if that had been your Mother being manacled and then find out your you were shipped to a different state? That my dear Sir is WRONG and NOT LEGAL.
@OliveTrouble @MSNBC @RepJeffDenham Anyone I'm older than I call child, since you aren't 73 years old, you qualify.
What is most maddening to me is that Paul Ryan is doing everything he can to get Democrats elected in the mid-term. He really needs to be removed as Speaker of the House. He's been working against the @POTUS from the get-go. It's time to remove him before you lose all you did.
@OliveTrouble @MSNBC @RepJeffDenham I'd buy leaker in Chief, not reporter. Oh and if you thought Obama has become the first black President of the United States. 3,917 people were murdered in Chicago, police records show. A really gr8 record he's got, right.
@OliveTrouble @MSNBC @RepJeffDenham Child, I was born 12 days after VJ Day. Roosevelt was President. My Dad was in the Army-Air Corps, retired with 21 years as a Major in 1950. I volunteered for the Navy in '63 in '75 I was in the Army, got out after 10-years was out for 7.5-years was recalled Navy 6.5-years 28-yrs
@OliveTrouble @MSNBC @RepJeffDenham No, they aren't. Obama was allowing anyone and everyone in he HATES AMERICA. He studied Saul Alinsky [First published in 1971, Rules for Radicals is Saul Alinsky's impassioned counsel to young radicals on how to effect constructive social change]. So you want socialism right?
@President45US Then what about that security officer for the Senate Intell Committee getting arrested for leaking. He was one of 24 leakers, who got arrested. Next, Paul Ryan needs to go he's WORKING  AGAINST YOU. He is part of the Deep State a RINO.
@OliveTrouble @MSNBC @RepJeffDenham They are American citizens, they came in the right way, did you? I was born in this country have lived overseas worked with those over there and some who came on Green Cards and left when it was done. The problem chain migration doesn't get any background checks. Do it right.
@RepMattGaetz The faster you get rid of Ryan the better. He's always been against the @POTUS on everything he's done. Watering down bills so he knows they will fail. But the only ones you can is your own caucus because they are afraid to do something about his crap.
Want to feel young, I volunteered for the Navy in 1963. Do remember that as an officer be it a grade officer of Warrant officer the federal govt. had a 10-year hold on your life. Now it's 5-years. So I got out in 2002.
@RepJeffDenham I have news for you DACA WILL BE DEAD ON DELIVERY IF YOU INCLUDE CHAIN MIGRATION WITH THE DemocRATS. They came out with that during Clintons time in office. It needs to be CLOSED DOWN not expanded. Those RATS are going to sink your boat and then blame it on you.
@MSNBC @RepJeffDenham Not when they want CHAIN MIGRATION left alone. That is a done deal it's OFF OF THE TABLE ...  OUT. No more bringing in ALL FAMILY MEMBERS. DACA SHOULD BE NO LONGER ON THE TABLE EITHER, GONE!!!
@FIGHTINGVETERAN Back to military stint, because I was off CONUS for 11.5-years I was not allowed to go overseas. That included the Army, I was ASA and then MI putting code to music for use in Viet-Nam. My PW has Cyrillic character in it, Good luck breaking it, the AF didn't.
@FIGHTINGVETERAN @BarackObama Navy 11.5-years, Army 10-years, recalled Navy 6.5-years = 28-years. My first duty station was the USNS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
@PhxKen Some legacy, now you would think that they would see this and figure out he certainly didn't help them. But then again the others would say he did by removing the riff-raff off of the streets. Obama HATES AMERICANS no matter what color they are.
@Thomas1774Paine He'll have to subpoena them individually, from each witness. Is he going to return these items when they are finished their conversations, I doubt it. And most people don't own multiple phones, with the exception of FBI and other Federal agencies. He's trying for over-reach.
@ela_hau @Thomas1774Paine @POTUS They said release 6/14/18. Did you remember the dateline? And could be doesn't make it so. The FBI has been removing everything that will embarrass them. Before we see it, but what we really need to see is the unredacted report. So what if it embarrasses them if they deserve it.
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Letting that IDIOT have anything to do with foreign policy is one of the worst things we did. He gave away, to our enemies, for the most part, everything that they wanted and we got nothing in return. That is NOT A FOREIGN POLICY, that's a give-away.
@Thomas1774Paine Oh great while the @POTUS is out of the country, and this is after the FBI has been removing everything that should prove embarrassing to them. They need to be embarrassed and those who did wrong need to lose their jobs before they can get their retirement.
@GartrellLinda @pinkk9lover @grizz_meister @starcrosswolf @ArizonaKayte @alozras411 @bbusa617 @PhilMcCrackin44 @KatTheHammer1 @DutyOfAPatriot @DjLots3 A perfect definition for Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama.
@minnman47 They are getting some help from PAUL RYAN and MARCO RUBIO, though. Both need to be removed from ever having leadership positions since they are both working against the @POTUS.
@marcorubio If you have not seen anything on SPYGATE, then how the heck can you truthfully say there's nothing to it? A White-washing of that doesn't cut it with me and I live in Florida. Now get with the program and truthfully tell folks what you have seen. DON'T LIE for the FBI
@RedNationRising Awe, where have you been? He's flip-flopped on anything that the @POTUS was in favor of. Understand he's part of the Deep State and a RINO. He needs to be removed from his position. His history is with GW Bush which puts him as part of the Deep State, not the current state.
@RepMattGaetz @TheJusticeDept Well, you have the power to force them to let you have everything you are asking for. But the chairman of each committee doesn't want to do a job correctly, they are part of the DOJ/FBI problem. You want to get it done they are too weak-kneed to do the job. Force them to do it.
@RedNationRising She's a hypocrite with that statement. It doesn't matter when [year] she made it, she admitted NO INDIVIDUAL IS ABOVE THE LAW.
@RepMattGaetz @FBI @TheJusticeDept What's shameful is that you haven't made a revolt to remove Paul Ryan (the Deep State Rino) from his seat. He's the Major problem with everything that you are doing because he's working against the @POTUS. He's a two-faced liar when it comes to supporting him.
@1a One Houston player put his money where his mouth was during the hurricane that went through Houston. Where were those other JACK-ASSES, not there helping. They don't want to use their talents to help others, they need to get a REAL JOB then and work not play.
@1a So you say. But those players pushing for this change aren't helping by doing things in their old neighborhoods, that's where they want someone else to use their money, and not those players. Think of the good relations they would get, and then others will join in.
@1a Actually the players in the game are the problem. They make loads of money but want others to pay for what they aren't willing to do themselves.
@jasoninthehouse Yeah, But according to Verizon, the "SmartPhone" is only as smart as the person inputting into it. While I do have a Droid phone, I don't put anything dealing with money. Now, how smart are you?
@PressSec Sarah, April Ryan won't like the RULE. White House Press corps are told to read this notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@kwilli1046 But you should have known that already Matt, he's been doing that all of the time. It's really time he gets voted out of his position, otherwise, you'll never get anything advanced.
@tbailey5477 Now, what did you expect from Obama? He lies, steals cheats [the American people] and commits murder to stay in accordance with the Holy Quran. It's a shame that he fooled the DemocRATS as well.
@DaveSchreiber3 @AprilDRyan I wasn't afraid to send it to her and let her know the WH liked it. I tend to think that those who are STUPID enough to make a fool of themselves to be escorted out in front of their peers. The rest might learn something they need to learn.
@FoxNews What is she smoking meth mixed with peyote? She'll be lucky if that lawyer doesn't counter sue her for defamation of character. Her problem is she spends everything she's got and needs more. I'd like to tell her to GET A REAL JOB. https://t.co/JXLyUL9Fkc
@DaleJr Dale enjoy yourself but remember this guy watches it as well. Also, child [I think I can call you that. Since your Dad was born in '51, making him younger than my Brother and he's 5-years younger than I am]. Class of '63 HS. I do have 28-years military service Retired 10/14/16. https://t.co/4Wndtg6IK7
@DaveSchreiber3 @AprilDRyan April Ryan needs to heed this Rule:  White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@Thomas1774Paine What's he smoking peyote? He's dreaming, it's the reason he gave up the helm of Starbucks. It might happen only if those who are in leadership positions don't hide their heads. But then again he most likely needs to have his mouth washed out, Lye Soap and Cod Liver Oil are good. https://t.co/oqFBkfOXXn
@buddy_lisk @Thomas1774Paine But as a Florida Representative, she needs to be first recalled, second arrested, thirdly she needs to be sent to prison with the sentence of term +1 day, then fourth to GITMO.
@AppSame @SenSchumer @BarackObama Need I remind you that according to the Quran, Obama is allowed to LIE, CHEAT, STEAL, MURDER to keep being a good Muslim keeping his faith. We know he lied was deceptive in his dealings, so what it new. He needs a cell facing towards Mecca in GITMO as well. With ALL who helped.
Do you realize that just over 1 million of our law enforcement officers have kept all people safe from harm? True there are a few bad apples. Those are the ones e1 pays attention to while our gr8 officers just do the job day in and day out.
@TheLastRefuge2 Bird of a feather stick together, as do liars. As for these two, they need a good length prison term +1 day. Then there is NO POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE until the sentence is fully been served. NO GOOD BEHAVIOR DISCHARGES.
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNewsInsider Problem with that is that we'll never get the full story and will blame it on the DOJ/OIG for knuckling under to those liars and traitors.
@Thomas1774Paine Prison is what she really needs, but my recommendation for her sentence would be for the term of her sentence + 1 day. This doesn't allow any parole until the sentence has been completed. That would be a perfect thing for her because of her own actions.
@TomFitton @ABC Simply put he puts out information and then lies about doing it, some leader. Now, he's upset when he gets told he said it could be done, this is when he denies it was so. He needs to see the inside of a prison cell and not be able to get out until his term +1 day is done.
@Jali_Cat @Acosta No, but the WH likes this:  White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@chuckwoolery But who is going to be able to trust this liar? He lied to Congress, DOJ/OIG, FBI OPM and now he wants immunity. He'll still lie to you and because of immunity, he can't be arrested for lying. DON'T DO IT HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED EVER AGAIN.

@AprilDRyan  White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in." 	This Rule is Loved by the WH.
@Acosta  White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."  This Rule is because of you, Jim.
@rhjomama @krassenstein @Eagles As do I, but at my age I just let them know they are CHILDREN to me, and then they tend to clam up. I was born 12 days after VJ Day. Do you know what year that was? I'll give you a hint Roosevelt was President when I was born. If you aren't in your70's then you are still a child.
@AMErikaNGIRLBOT Hopefully, the people in Virginia are aware that this independent person is running and should NEVER BE ANYWHERE AROUND CHILDREN. Keep your wits about you folks and remember a Pedophile can't be trusted around your children.
@Thomas1774Paine IF his Father is alive, I have a feeling that he isn't very proud of what his son has done and become. https://t.co/AGJjI0Pu7x
@rhjomama @krassenstein @Eagles True, but with the right words and or pictures it just might be that the left likes looking at pictures and might learn from them. I know it's a stretch, but I have to believe some of them can read and tell their friends. https://t.co/A1TdDRiSKv
@Thomas1774Paine SHE ought to be PACKING HER BAGS for a trip GITMO's gates are open for her. Also, she forgot one thing Hillary said and now it's coming back to haunt her. https://t.co/Dzuv9oclMq
@1Romans58 Andrew had his chance, to tell the truth to the American people, but he wanted the opposition party to win so that the wrongdoings would get swept under the rug. PACK YOUR BAGS YOU IDIOT GITMO AWAITS YOUR ENTRY.
@rhjomama @krassenstein @Eagles Truthfully she lost because she didn't ever tell the truth if it was easier to lie. The Democrats need to remember one thing Hillary said that she'll be able to live down. Just remember this came from her mouth, not Republicans. She is STUPID enough  to admit it you need to think https://t.co/RWrcjsH2s5
@Sheckyi He can't be trusted to tell the truth since the DOJ/OIG found he lied to his people as well. He's lied to Congress and to members of the FBI, and he wants what??? DREAM ON ANDREW You need to find yourself in GITMO.
@SurfPHX He should forget immunity because he's committed Treason in order to work for an opposition party ALL the while working for the FBI. Then his wife gets $700K on he losing an election. He didn't do or say anything about that. He lied once too many times.
@EdmundHulton Isn't it amazing that the DemocRATS forget things so conveniently when it is in their agendas? But finding out that one of their leaders was against this must be a sucker punch in their guts. https://t.co/SFh1WKvtlf
@BigCatRescue He will be sadly missed by all who knew him and watched him. While he was with you he gave you some comfort with the knowledge that he'd always look forward to your coming around. May the butterfly which will symbolize he's still there watching over BCR.

@AprilDRyan And you don't care that Sarah had called on someone else, NOT YOU, but you kept interjecting your will over e1 else in the room. YOU need to learn respect for ALL in that room, They aren't below you but EQUALS.
@RedNationRising @SadiqKhan MOst knives and lock blade, machetes, swords aren't legal. As for the Police, some of them have tasers which would put a stop to that knucklehead.
@davidhogg111 Got news for you if you mentioned anything on social media, you told those who want to get you into a world of problems. Social Media while you think it's safe it ISN'T. All sorts of people watch to see what you are doing so that they can bring is the SWAT team.
@Thomas1774Paine Has anyone heard of GRAFT? The President when he was President could have taken the land using his authority as CIC, but he's that STUPID to think the state where he claims he from will pay for it. Pick his Picture from my line up. The rest represent Illinois voters who agreed. https://t.co/W7Oe7pJMk0
@RepTedLieu @POTUS Dear Ted, You are responsible for trying to MAKE NEWS. You'd rather have a WAR, but than you'd be able to say we told you so. Had you used the 8-years under Obama that would have been one thing, but your party didn't want to do that.
@MSNBC Awe Gee, it's the "Pot Calling the Kettle Black". Mueller conveniently leaks and I know and he also knows that isn't legal.
@tedlieu Ted, it would have been better to remind folks of those who bled and died for the country, But you'd rather than think of the NEGATIVE. What a shame on YOU. As a CWO-3 Ret. I've had friends whom I knew die for the flag we hold dear. You as an AF Reserve Col. should know better.
@Thomas1774Paine Go for it Devin, they have an anti-Republican bent from the get-go. The entire company is anti-good for the country, they back DemocRATS all of the time, as does FaceBook and most tech companies in CA.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I've heard the same thing with you, Ted. So I'll make it easy for you, Pick out your photo from the group I've assembled. https://t.co/RprYmTkLCc
@MilitaryNewsE What you know or were afraid to find out just how far to the left these jerks are. If the Draft was in place like it was when I was growing up, they would be afraid to open their mouths else the got drafted. While it might have done some of them good, the rest would be in prison.
@tbailey5477 Sally Yates, should be headed South it'll be a whole lot safer for her. Now I know of a lush tropical place that has mango's growing wild so just about anyone could pick them. The climate is 80 degrees year round 7" of rain in March. Sounds good, Right? GITMO.
@RedNationRising Does that also mean that Don Lemon is going to reciprocate, I doubt that because he's still holding grudges. Hold them deep enough Don and you'll become one. Here's something I want you to think about,  deeply. https://t.co/SPjKns41p0
@RedNationRising Jim's the type that would SCREW HAITI LIKE the CLINTON FOUNDATION did, and then try blaming it on Trump. What a sad sack. He might need a load of COW PATTIES POURED AROUND HIS HOUSE, NOW WET IT and watch his consternation.

They want your feelings to quit when they are upset, but they are always upset. Might have to get them a pacifier, but they might not know how to use it correctly. I have a sneaking hunch they'd be as confused as a chameleon in Skittles.
@mrmonks01 "Trust" Sessions, nope. He's part of the Deep State. Had he been honest with Trump is the first place, he would never have been named the AG. Rosenstein was also appointed by someone's recommendation, he's still too mixed in this mess and should recuse himself but he won't.
@ablessedpatriot About time they get into a CATFIGHT BETWEEN EACH OTHER. We can see exactly how stupid they are trying to out-stupid each other. Next, they'll be hiding their heads in the sand. https://t.co/CGWPtUTmul
@mrmonks01 The cat was out of the bag a long time. Mueller is pulling at straws and was not ready for that Lawyer asking for discovery. Want to argue that as well. Cover all bases, go in prepared to do the job, if not. then you don't have anything. FYI I was NCID for 8+yrs USN.
@mrmonks01 Nope, the original scope was specific. Mueller going into to stuff 11-years before has nothing to do with Russia. Also, the raid on Manifort's house didn't have anything to cover the raid till a week after it had been done. You're pulling at straws. Try again.
@watspn1013 It's good to dream, but they aren't in power which is perfectly right. They also want a war, because with that then they could say I told you so. They had 8 years under Obama they didn't do anything except make the USA a laughingstock. Here's where their heads were pick em out https://t.co/jbasTZnSoH
@RedNationRising But if the country is having gr8 thing done and the people's fortunes are doing better, then everything they want has gone wrong. Remember they want Welfare and Affirmative Action for them to succeed. They want higher taxes, not what Trump has done. They are the party of Hatred. https://t.co/4YSkYLauXg
@BellaBe41880801 I have a BA in Theology a Masters in Industrial Computer Robotics and Electronics Engineering. Foreign languages were Hebrew and Greek with a smattering of Aramaic since the Bible is/was written in those languages. So if McCain becomes a crispy critter so be it.
@jojoh888 I want you to pick her out of my line-up of Jack-Asses. https://t.co/JiBWxb66tO
@itsmikebivins @wweek If that is so, then those Police Officers need to be removed from that Police Department IMMEDIATELY. ANTIFA has been named in FBI reports as being a criminal organization backed by George Soros.
@true_pundit Has anyone figured out he's a Muslim and according to the Quran they are allowed to lie cheat steal and commit murder if it advances their culture and way of life? If he's so set on that culture to send him to Iran where he'll feel right at home.
@SusanStormXO @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Tomi, I wish to God they were, but no these fools have nothing else to throw bricks at. They didn't dare do it to Obama, because they were already that far to the left. What we as Christian members of society, is to pray for their souls, that they might not ROAST IN HELL.
@FIGHTINGVETERAN @BarackObama Now, what did you expect from a Muslin who WAS NOT BORN IN THE US, HATES AMERICA AND IT'S CITIZENS? He is a non-citizen and was really never allowed to run for President. He needs to take a trip to a lush tropical island, get a window facing Mecca on GITMO.
@jojoh888 @grizz_meister @hrenee80 @RoseHasMoreFun @RuthieRedSox @KatTheHammer1 @skb_sara @PoliticallyRYT @JohnnyB371 @USAHotLips @GaetaSusan 16/17-year-olds don't VOTE you fools. That's why you are known as the Clinton News Network. Back a loser and then continue to push leftish agendas and then wonder why you get called FAKE NEWS, well you have earned it.
@TT45Pac Biggest fool, in the state.  He needs to serve his writ to the Kilauea volcano and see how far it gets. Getting close to the crater might be hazardous to your health considering the gasses around the summit.
@RedNationRising He/She has no right to call anyone a racist until he/she knows all of us. So by saying that then THEY ARE RACISTS by their own definition. They Voted for a loser named Clinton who didn't even know how to tell the truth. What a shame they are trying to incite race riots as is CNN.
@GemMar333 @SenSchumer Rosenstein VOIDED the @POTUS and Congress approval with the ADDED out of the original scope of the order. Therefore making everything Mueller is doing ILLEGAL. Now isn't that a fine pickle he's in and YOU ALL ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING. If Congress has the right to approve is gone
@Thomas1774Paine But dear ole Bernie would have put us under Socialism. Bernie is pissed because Clinton screwed him, now he's pissed because he's not in power. His version of Socialism would have led us to Communism, NO THANK YOU BERNIE. Want socialized medicine go to BR Brittan they HATE IT.
@Auburngirlx @drawandstrike @POTUS Hired Rosenstein, but it had to have been on another persons recommendation. This is preposterous but Rosenstein is colluded because of his note that he sent to President @realDonaldTrump. Problem with that is this whole mess was screwy from the get-go. Rosenstein, Sessions gone.
@OneBadM6 @drawandstrike @POTUS True, my pointed question towards Sealth Jeff told him I know what is being done is totally illegal. I'm a Notary for the State of Florida in my 7th term, when I see something that I know is wrong, by state law I'm not allowed to give legal advice. I'll let them know not legal.
@drawandstrike Then WHY IS HE ALLOWING ROSENSTEIN TO BROADEN IT'S SCOPE? Is he wearing Blinders or what? Rosenstein had only one area to be over nothing more. He's usurping the @POTUS and Congress with this broadening power for Mueller. That is Against the law if I'm not mistaken.
@Thomas1774Paine He needs to LOSE his job. It's IDIOTS LIKE THAT who are bringing down the country. Awe, if I hurt your feelings, then maybe you ought to look around at those of us WHO FOUGHT AND DIED so you could say that CRAP. Alabama Media Group better WAKE UP and think of VETS.
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee But you have to understand that to the DemocRATS this is awful news. They are the party of affirmative action, welfare programs that keep minorities in poverty. Good news to them is a piss-poor jobs ratings. https://t.co/QPcajraP1H
@RealMAGASteve Comey and McCabe ought to be shaking in their boots. They also need to be wearing Brown pants, so when they crap in them you don't see the mess that they made. Pack your bags boys, that tropical island is awaiting your appearance. GITMO has its doors and gates open wide for you.
@Thomas1774Paine The CHICKENS are coming in to roost, or ROAST. They knew they had done wrong when they did it and should be able as "honest men" to take whatever is meted out. But I have a feeling these PANSIES don't want to look at their shadows for fear they will come in with handcuffs.
@RealMAGASteve I have a picture of him in a line-up. Please pick him out. The others are Lynch, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Clinton, and Obama. See if you see them as well. https://t.co/zFKfrefwZq
@tedlieu @PressSec Ah, Ted, You don't know the difference between @realDonaldTrump and Donald Trump, Jr. do you? Seems that you'd better know who the players are before you start accusing @PressSec of not telling the truth. I do know you speak with a FORKED TONGUE though.
@RealTrumpLady To my friends from Viet-Nam and myself, he's a traitor for not telling the truth about the men being left in North Viet-Nam. But I do know ONE who will set him right, and he won't like it one bit. May he feel the fires, making him a crispy critter.
@FishHuntTexas @ChristineMAGAMD @grizz_meister @wvufanagent99a @ArizonaKayte @GartrellLinda @bbusa617 @JenNongel @DineshDSouza @KatTheHammer1 Or ICE with DEPORT you BOTH.
@RedNationRising John doesn't pay close attention either. Pack your bags for a trip to a lush tropical Island paradise. They won't care how many times you lie, but they will give you exactly what you deserve for working in one of this countries worst administrations. But GITMO will await you.
@Thomas1774Paine Brennan is one to talk, he was part of the WORST ADMINISTRATION of this century. He'd better be packing his bags for a long trip about 585 miles SSE of Miami. If he can't figure it out then think GITMO. Good Bye.
@Thomas1774Paine I wonder if he's considered the real possibility of his being arrested for his misdoings during the Obama Administration's interferences with a political campaign. I know of a lush tropical location calling his name ... GITMO.
@SenSchumer Well, Chuck if that is so, then WHY THE HECK IS HE NOT LOOKING INTO CLINTONS INVOLVEMENT? Because it has been proven that her campaign colluded with the Russians to try to take down the Trump campaign. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a Notary and I know that's wrong and not at all legal.
@piersmorgan @josbuttler Piers, I want you to watch a short video as put on by Penn &amp; Teller explaining exactly what the 2nd Amendment says and does.

@WayneDupreeShow Oh deary me, they don't want to play, then too they don't need to be paid for sitting out the season. Goes to show you how STUPID these supposedly EDUCATED PLAYERS are. They don't want the money, by their sit out they are breaking their contracts. Meaning they lost a job too.
@ArizonaKayte @bbusa617 @1Romans58 @bonniemurphy @gr8tjude @Golfinggary5221 @buzzman888 @grizz_meister @KatTheHammer1 Well some of us know and understand that.

@buzzman888 @realDonaldTrump he'd better bite his tongue, else someone take him out behind the woodshed and teach him some manners. He's been caught with his pants down and he's liable to be taking a long trip shortly to a tropical lush paradise.   GITMO
@Thomas1774Paine Rep. Alan Grayson's (D-FL) embarrassingly absurd claim that an AR-15 can	shoot 700 rounds in a minute has gone viral because it is impossible for an	AR-15 to shoot that many rounds in a minute. Since an AR-15 is a	semi-automatic, as fast as you can pull the trigger it shoots.
@Thomas1774Paine The "AR" in AR-15 does not stand for assault rifle, it actually stands	for ArmaLite Rifle, the name of the company that first invented the rifle.
@Thomas1774Paine In order for a firearm to be considered an assault rifle, it needs to have	the capability of selective fire: switching between semi-automatic and	automatic settings. Civilian AR-15s only have the semi-automatic setting so it cannot be considered an assault rifle.
@Thomas1774Paine That figures, they would want the  Americans disarmed the easier to take them over. Penn &amp; Teller Helps Gun Control Supporters Understand The 2nd Amendment. If you don't know what it is, then watch the video and learn. 	https://t.co/RuI9DVRIDi
@LucienLachance6 I don't know where you got that version of what you are calling the "American's Creed", but I found the original hanging in Butler Univ's Jordan Hall. It doesn't say what you have written on your placque. Please read this and compare it, they are not alike. https://t.co/r1i5mn5Rwa
@LucienLachance6 You asked what this was in reply to Nick  May 31	More	Replying to @hugh_gautier @muchmoresalt @RodStryker	Race relations before Obama? =Who cares about race? The individual is what counts	Does this answer your question?
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog That's your opinion Rachel. He doesn't have to live up to your LOWEST standards and be so far to the LIBERAL LEFT as you are. You haven't figured out people aren't as FAR LEFT as you are, I was never a Clinton follower since she can't take responsibility for anything she has done
@LucienLachance6 I have a light FM radio running in the background 24/7/365. My flag pole is made up of something that most folks wouldn't think of using. 3-10' joints of rigid conduit piping that drop intio each other during a hurricane. They stick out of the ground 4'. https://t.co/LfK8kllL5K
@LucienLachance6 What you are saying isn't true of all White people, making generalizations and saying ALL means that YOU, TO have a problem. That would be like calling me a racist, just remember you can be a racist as well. I work with everyone around me no matter the color.
@FoxNews Hmm, a fitting punishment would probably be the same kind of crap they pulled on this dog. Notice I did say they cause it would most likely take more than one person to pull such crap. But bury them in necks in COW DUNG give them a spoon and tell them to eat their way out.
@MSNBC Have you heard of the Acosta Rule? White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I have news for you Lou, you are younger than I am kid, as is the @POTUS.	Now you can thank your lucky stars you found someone older than you are.
@PhxKen @PacificPundit CNN doesn't like the Acosta Rule: White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@CNN The Acosta Rule:  White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."  WH liked it.
@RAMRANTS @Rosie Charge her on each variation of her name establishing the money came from her account alone. She's toast if it's 5 years now it's 25 years but add 1 day to that sentence she'll never get paroled.
@PoliceMag Where was the person who is supposedly in charge of the vehicle? They need a ticket for creating the problem. No matter if the car is in automatic mode it still has to have a driver in charge. They didn't have charge of the vehicle in this case and NEED A LARGE TICKET.
@realDonaldTrump That was Obama's prime idea. Make the USA a 3rd world country instead of #1. I'm glad you are putting a stop to his STUPIDITY. Next, he has to be arrested for making deals, acting like he's still in charge. Which is TREASON, if you asked me.
@JewPublican @RedNationRising She's waiting for the Feds to be knocking at her door she'ss be on a plane to GITMO, then she'll have no abilities to push her crap out for you to get upset with. She's feeding your anger, hoping you'd be mad at the @POTUS. But those Dems never keep their promises during election
@OfficeOfMike How about this suggestion be done for your White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@MEL2AUSA @DineshDSouza Someone did some serious searching to find out the Democrats promote affirmative action and welfare. That doesn't get folks out of poverty, it keeps them dependent on handouts. Mr. D'souza is right in his summarization of the Democrat Party. Find out how many promises were kept. https://t.co/hEvtHylHG0
@EdgeLSeawolf @FoxNews You didn't hear that the military uses it for Special Ops did you? It's a suggestion. Do you have a better one that doesn't put the children at risk? Remember folks who want guns don't get them at to gun shops, they go underground "Friday Night Specials" and get the guns.
@KatTimpf She had to try something to make up for a potty mouth. When I was a lot younger my mouth would have been washed out with lye soap followed by a large dose of Cod Liver Oil. She most likely needs the same treatment, NOW.
@Thomas1774Paine As if we didn't know that would happen. She has a potty mouth and always has, but e1 thought it was funny. Now she has Twitter and she doesn't know how to keep her potty mouth away from her phat phingers. I spelled that wrong on purpose because of a Price Fister ad in the '90's.
@EdmundHulton I don't think GITMO has enough accommodations for all of them. So those fit enough can climb the mango trees. Watch out for the spines don't break them. It's poison sumac. the hospital down there called it Mango Bango cause it covers you. I was stationed there 63-75, USN.
@RodStryker Hopefully, they can read and understand the Democrats ARE NOT HELPING YOU, THEY ARE MAKING YOU DEPENDENT ON THEIR LIES. https://t.co/totks9md4l
@SusanStormXO But Obama isn't sending them money anymore, so why should they like us, they never did before. What Iran needs to learn is a very hard explosive lesson. Something like what was tried on Hitler but botched. It would be harder to botch if a Nuke missile were to come into the window
@donald_potus How about this suggestion be done for your White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately." "Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in."
@RedNationRising They all need to visit a lush tropical paradise with an 8o degree climate year round 7" of rain in March. Coral rock and cactus, mango trees that can be climbed but be careful because you can get poison sumac GITMO.
@AlanGrayson  If you are going to say shuch crap about the "AR" in AR-15 does not stand for assault rifle, it actually stands for ArmaLite Rifle, the name of the company that first invented the rifle. As a Civilian weapon it can't be an assault rifle.
@AlanGrayson You really don't know what an AR-15 is, now do you. It CAN'T fire 700 rounds per minute because it is impossible for an AR-15 to shoot that many rounds in a minute. Since an AR-15 is a semi-automatic, it can only fire the amount of the times somebody pulls a trigger.
@kwilli1046 The other problem is that there is a double-standard even in the "fake news network".  But they ALL have one Major problem they sell ads, and if they get enough complaints from these sponsors a show gets the ax. So you get lots of folks to let their sponsors know, they get them.
@PhxKen His record all of the way back into the '70's for the Whitey Bulger case. If you expected him to change his stripes, then you are going to be sadly mistaken. The shame is that he was the FBI Head for 12 years. Obama didn't forget his background and used it to his advantage.
@PhxKen Most likely a true statement, so JAIL her as an Accessory to their crimes. Now she won't like it at all, but that is exactly what she did. Her jail term ought to be for EACH PERSON SEPARATELY and not lumped together as one crime. Also, add 1 day to the sentence meaning no parole.
@1a @DrJeffreyPJones @wyntermitchell @Deggans @robbysoave If the stars are as mad ass they say they are, then don't allow your program to be on ABC. Hit them in their wallet and they'll come around. The money that they make from your programs is what keeps them in business, otherwise, they'll have to charge more for ads and it gets less
@Timothy78858211 @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Something to remember about the Democrats wants affirmative action and welfare programs that trap minorities. They promise you anything that they think you'll vote them in for and promptly forget doing what they said they would do. Sounds just about like every politician now. https://t.co/RkjUit6ysU
@RexTillersom Takes a "smart" person to let a stranger borrow your cell phone. I don't buy it for one second. That would be the same as asking for your car keys and then robbing a bank leaving you holding the bag. She might be naive but she certainly isn't really that STUPID.
@RandyThom4509 I had a scam caller today trying to get money for disabled vets, only they were going to give .01% to the DAV organization, the rest went to them. My trace showed the call originated in Belize, which I didn't let them know I knew. Always ask for the offering to be sent via mail.
@RedNationRising Truth, what's that. Even FaceBook's Zuckerberg doesn't know how, to tell the truth. What are you smoking peyote? You can forget the MSM forever telling the truth since they all have forked tongues.
@RedNationRising CNN = Clinton News Network anything very liberal will take top precedence for our reporters. If it is good for Trump, it won't be seen.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Now, what did you expect from Mayor Rahm Emanuel, really? But then again you voted him into office. Didn't you know what side he stood on? Seems to me that if he had given his true position, NO ONE would have voted for him, yes or no?`
@Woke2008 @Thomas1774Paine I stand corrected. My spell checker didn't have that as a choice.
@Thomas1774Paine This supposed SLUM LORD needs to see the inside of a prison cell. She was preying on the very folks that Obama was looking towards voting him into the Presidency. If thisis the style of workmanship she was pushing, then she'll get exactly what she needs to have meeted out to her.
@CharlieDaniels I totally agree with your comments to those pasty faces members of Congress.
@TracyMFinch But say anything that upsets them and you've said a racist remark. Anyone who wants to say I'm racist is one themselves. I've worked both in the military and as a civilian for the past 25-years no problems, we know each other and we poke at each other as well. We learn together.
@drawandstrike Ah, but it's true Obama wasn't born in Hawaii, he was born in Kenya so therefore he was not legal to run for president. I'm sorry for your not believing what was brought forwards, Obama's true Kenyan birth certificate. So you still want to say he's legal, really? Not on your life
@drawandstrike Seems to me that when YOU recused yourself from the Russia probe, you enabled Rosenstein to ILLEGALLY APPOINT MUELLER as a Special Prosecutor. But Rosenstein expanded the probe, removing the President's and Senates responsibilities to Approve his expansion of the probe. WRONG.
@tedlieu You ought to know better than to use the LORD'S NAME in VAIN. It'll come back to haunt you when you least expect it. Just remember you want welfare to keep the poor poor, without that you don't have a party. https://t.co/HR2bioZcQp
@Thomas1774Paine McCabe had better have his health and house insurance paid up. Being a JACKASS like McCabe is/was doesn't help his position. He knew he used trumped-up charges against Flynn, so he has a reason to be worried. It's too late Andrew, you should not have done the deed you did.
@jasoninthehouse Bergdahl needed to be either Shot or put away for life plus 1 day. This means no parole until 1 day after he's dead.  Does that let you know how I feel about this traitor?
@WLouT2 @AppSame @RuthieRedSox @ArizonaKayte @PhilMcCrackin44 @Q_101_X @ROCKONOHIO @Jamierodr10 @RealMAGASteve @BestBrownsFan Clapper thinks e1 is a fool if they don't believe him. What he forgets is that we know he lied to Congress, so he's blowing smoke and trying to befuddle us. I have news for him, after a little digging, I've found that the Dems like keeping people in welfare, doing a snow job. https://t.co/2b5JVzzB9S
@GovMikeHuckabee Something the Democrats are trying not to live down. They are the party of oppression, racism [obsessed with it], affirmative action, welfare programs to keep the people oppressed. 	We have just got to keep reminding them what they are, the people will do rest. https://t.co/l20NK0HSRT
@RepAdamSchiff Had you not cheated leaving the meeting to let the MSM know what was going on the thing would still have been a secret. In that case,  it would seem that YOU ARE THE BIGGEST LEAKER IN CONGRESS and have committed a FELONY. As a lawyer, you ought to know better. LIAR
@JesusSonOfGod__ @csimpsonsfgc3 @Jared_T_Swift @NYMPHOwars420 Does anyone know what a 3" blowup plug is? It's something that you would put in a 3" pipe. Well in looking at her mouth, I think it would do the job quite well. She'd be plugged up so she couldn't spout out crap, and speaking of crap it would be better left inside her.
@RealSaavedra Then if that is what they want in America, then let's ship them over to London and they can have all that they want. Otherwise, to the DemocRATS, wake up and smell the roses. You are acting like they have it better than we have. Then  YOU GO THERE and leave us right here. BYE!
@RepAlGreen I'll take offense to what you have called me. You don't know me nor have you ever spoken directly to me. As a retired, 28-years, Viet-Nam VET, you'd better learn some manners before you start using those GOD GIVEN BRAINS for something good or keep your mouth shut.
@Thomas1774Paine IT's a shame that he's like the "Pot calling the kettle Black". Mr. Green forgets that he is calling ALL Caucasian folks racists, well Mr. Green if the shoe fits, Wear It. You stop calling us racists when we haven't done or said anything about or to you. What a  poor Rep you are.
@USAHotLips @KatTheHammer1 @ClintonMSix141 @ArizonaKayte @carrieksada_ @ReBannedVernon @RuthieRedSox @Zola1611 @PriscillasView @michaelbeatty3 @TrumpGirlStrong Anyone who says the other is a racist is by definition a racist. It doesn't matter what color the skin is. It's your thoughts and actions that really say what you are. You could even be a bigotted racist claiming e1 can't say they were profiled. That doesn't make it so.
@WEARAllenStrum @weartv Well, hopefully, you live on high ground Allen. I'll stay here and follow through with my CERT responsibilities. I've been certified since 2003 and did a followup this past summer.
@AmericanRiflesA What's he smoking peyote because he's delusionary? He lied, cheated. and it's legal in the Quran he could even murder and it would be legal as long as it furthered the Muslim religion. As a Muslim, Christians should know he would not bow down to anything except Allah.
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton What happened to the plug that needs to go into the area of her mouth. She's the cause for the crisis in our Democracy. Lying, cheating, stealing a candidacy for president v Bernie Sanders, and the Dems don't seem to care. They are as colluded as she is.
@gopoundsand1234 You mean that you finally figured that out. I'd been saying that for quite a while but no one wants to use their GOD GIVEN BRIANS to think about what is happening. Obama and his minions tried to destroy our Democracy since he's a Socialist bordering on Communist as are most RATS.
@AnnaApp91838450 @BlueSea1964 Glock 19 with 33 round clip, a 16 Ga double barrel slugs ready, S&amp;W 686 357 Magnum. Awe gee, I didn't say anything about the fact my hands are registered as deadly weapons, and I can't check them in at the door.
@Bud_Doggin Think George Soros backing. Do understand Soros hates America with a passion and will do anything to make the US fail. Obama studied Saul Alinsky Socialism/Communism. Obama has lied, cheated, did everything he could to destroy our way of life, Using his Muslim faith to do so.
@Bud_Doggin He's a Commander and Thief
@WillWtroyer 5 for GITMO plus Clapper who has been trying to get out from under the scrutiny.
@Thomas1774Paine Comey his leadership staff have destroyed good agents, to keep their legacy intact. It's a shame that these good officers were punished for showing wrongdoing from higher-ups.  Comey is gone as is McCabe, but not those they left in charge. Those traitors need to be removed. NOW
@KyManInTheWoods @LiberalMormon @Greeneyz0080 @OldManStoneZone @NalydV1776 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump If so they need to ship lots of them to David Hogg.
@bonniemurphy @Golfinggary5221 @RuthieRedSox @ArizonaKayte @bbusa617 @Jamierodr10 @alozras411 @buzzman888 @1Romans58 @TrumpsDC @dasadarshan Well, you got what he is portrayed correctly, but Col Sanders might not appreciate your analogy to his Chicken. Are you sure he isn't full of BS, which we could turn into cow-patties? Wet them and they stink to high heaven.
@arkiegal411 Here's the problem you'll have with those LIBERAL educators, anything to do with TRUMP can and will get you booted from school.  What educators have to remember not E1 believes as they do. In this case, you are trying to take the 1st Amendment right away from the student. WRONG!!
@President45US Those Californians who don't want to be around MS-13 better leave the state in a hurry. Now, on the other hand, ICE personnel can show up for their annual roundup of illegals. But before you go for them Take the Gov. with you so he can't warn them.
@chuckwoolery They certainly did when they helped HRC with that dirty "Dossier". And now you are drawing the ire of the American public. Your STUPIDITY in trying everything you could to put onto Trump has been your downfall. Had you done it right chose not to cheat it would have been fine
@ggeett37aaa What a sorry idiot for a state Rep. She's not thinking of the people, otherwise she'd know that they are better off out of poverty. Yet the people in CA keep putting this lying lady back into office. What a shame they don't think or remember she has not kept her promises to them.
@Corp125Vet @TracyMFinch Mine is with the VA in Mississippi and a doctor just about caused both to malfunction because of his experiment that he didn't tell the patients about. I lost a kidney due to his treatment. But I also killed his ability to practice medicine throughout the Southeast and the VA.
@SandraHartle @TuckerCarlson Deep state goes into the Gand of 8 as well and they need to be deposed as well. Now on the DO/FBI, Starting from the TOP: Sessions; Wray; Rosenstein; Ohr need to go most of them to prison. 	Sessions is blocking as well as Rosenstein is so he's in collusion with them.
@JonellBowman1 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Oh, then who was watching the Lib's side since ALL of the Russian collusion was coming from their side.
@Thomas1774Paine Time for a Mandatory retirement at 65 for ALL congress members. THose ultra-liberals would be GONE, but they might not be forgotten. On the other hand, if they contributed to the spying done on the opposing party, they could end up in GITMO losing their pension as well.
@Thomas1774Paine The only way she'll go away is in shackles and handcuffs and she'll spend a long time hopefully in the most secure prison GITMO.
@andersonDrLJA Everything he did was to lie, obfuscate tell untruths especially about paying ransom for the 4-Americans who were in Iran [$400M] and to tell us we don't pay ransom for hostages. Crock-of-Crap it what that was. Everyone in his Admin lied that's how pervasive it was.
@AMike4761 About time someone came forward to debunk the CRAP that has been coming out of the LEFT has been putting out.
@WEARAllenStrum Please understand the Street I live on goes uphill from US Hwy-98 and dead ends at Hollywood Blvd.  The picture shows you have to go to the top of that hill to get to my location. Yes, the flag flies 24/7/365 and the spotlights are on a timer 3PM - 7AM every day. https://t.co/cdNiTxTObw
@qkode If he doesn't want to be responsible for his job IMPEACH him, but while you are at it go after all who are colluding with him even if that takes you to Jeff Sessions. This kind of CRAP has gone on long enough.
@thebradfordfile @KimStrassel The way to stop the Constitutional crisis is to IMPEACH those who will attempt to obstruct. 	Congress is TOO WEAK KNEED TO DO ANYTHING THAT WILL LEAD TO REAL CHANGE IN THE DOJ/FBI. 	Now I've stepped on their CLOWN SHOES AGAIN. YOU WORK FOR US NOT YOURSELVES. Get with the program.
@WEARAllenStrum Allen, the intersection of Mary Esther Blvd. and Hwy 98 is 29' above sea level. I'm sitting atop of a hill another 6' over that, 2-blocks East of that intersection. My home was built in 1956, real plaster walls and ceilings, tongue/groove wood on roof 16" on center well built.
@marklevinshow Sen. McConnell is long since retirement age, and that needs to be rigorously enforced on both sides of the aisle. His thinking is not on the side of the citizens that he represents. Awe, I've stepped on his toes, if he'd remove those CLOWN SHOES, he might not look as pathetic.
@WEARAllenStrum SLightly more towards the Big Bend area would be better for this area, but not for them. Texas doesn't need another hit either since they aren't over the last one yet. NO, doesn't need more water that is unless those dikes around the lower area are totally operational. Cuba is gd
@POLITICSandFUN Take that $60M and put it towards hardening our schools. Metal Detectors, cameras, bulletproof glass, only one door to enter once school has started.
@LaurieTweet2 @Militarydotcom When I've gone to Epcot here in FL, Space Mountain operators didn't like the idea I had knee braces on both knees. 8 Knee operations [4 per leg] does that to you, they should have. worried that my back was broken as well as both [total] arms. I'm 100%, disabled vet. I still work.
@Reblyn1963 @thebradfordfile Do both, in Florida we limited 2 terms, this way a guy/gal can't live in Washington forever. Our HE Coon [Bob Sikes] taught us that lesson rather well. He was up in Washington for over 26 years which was way too long he didn't even know what was happening in our neck of NW FL.
@thebradfordfile Most, of the Almonds, come from that state, I wonder if they have rubbed off on them? They can't be trusted to keep anything secret especially Adam Schiff
@ScotsFyre @Publix And the shooter doesn't have to have his name mentioned or brought up for that matter. When it is he gets some credit for the evil he's brought the community. I live 10-miles from Eglin AFB and 2-miles Hurlburt AFB, here in NW FL. I'm a vet retiree 73-years young.
@thebradfordfile @KamVTV @GrrrGraphics @DineshDSouza @steph93065 @ReneeCarrollAZ @OfficeOfMike @ChristieC733 @ClintonMSix141 GITMO AWAITS HIS ARRIVAL
@ScotsFyre @Publix Something I do before typing anything is to backcheck who told the original info and then look for more sources to back up what I'd found. I also have a listing in folders for subjects I've talked about and pictures as well. See attached picture https://t.co/j1WQXpl6aI
@jayMAGA45 It's even harder to believe that if people would look at the last 4 letters in the party name and what it spells: democRATS. I CAPPED IT JUST FOR YOU TO READ.
@JudicialWatch Oh, RUSSIAN  COLLUSION sitting in plain sight, yet Mueller's team doesn't want to go after that. It would be like tearing their side down to nothing tracing it all of the way back to the Obama WH.
@kwilli1046 They have very short memories of the wrong-doings that they have done. They want you to believe everything that they say NOT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. But if people will stop and think what have they done to help their situation, or was it the Republicans who got it done.
@ScotsFyre @Publix Well, I do know he went after Lauras Ingraham, a victim of Media Matters tactics, the Soros-funded group exploited a single talking point in order to turn corporate sponsors against a powerful conservative voice. My Source Bill O'Reilly and a google search as well.
@Militarydotcom Something tells me that 6 Flags is going to pay a penalty for pulling that kind of crap. If they don't have signs telling people that they need both legs, then they have no leg to stand on, and making up rules isn't a good thing either.
@ScotsFyre @Publix Mr. Oink, oink Hogg is sitting in the bleachers on the left wing supported by George Soros. Why doesn't he get Soros to put $2.5M into that fund since the guy who did the shooting is also from the left?
@perfectsliders Be kind of hard to back net-flix without a TV. Mine died back in '97 and I have not wanted one to replace it. I gave the cable box to COX when that TV died. COX Cable goes up every few months and nothing has improved. So I'll keep my DSL I'm happy this way.
@TuckerCarlson But Tucker, you know he has to say that since he's knee deep in the rest of the crap that he and his cronies caused. He makes a broad statement and the Dems keep on trusting him that it'll be found. Oh, yeah, it'll be found in Hillary's lap and DNC Computer.
@SavingAmerica4U Obama didn't let underlings Strzok/Page know, because they gave that game-plan away through their text messages. Had he [Obama] been "smart" he would not have started it in the first place. Guess that tell you haw "Smart" he was. Can't even call him the sharpest tack in the box.
@Thomas1774Paine We have a nice WARM place for you John, tropical and lush vegetation that is if you like coral rock and cactus. There are some mango trees you can climb up for the fruit. Just don't blame me if you get poison sumac. GITMO awaits you.
@NRA @SenWarren Pocahontas isn't willing to prove she has Indian blood in her veins. Won't take a DNA test, because she knows she'll be proved a fraud and a liar. That little lie got her a position as a Professor at a college/university. Why should MA re-elect a liar?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It might help if your side were working for the people that you represent. But no you have to be obstructionist at every turn and then blame it on the President. Your side of the aisle wants to think that you are still in power, GET OVER IT, YOU AREN'T.
@chuckwoolery But the Watergate folks were caught as you are now. And you are beginning to squirm to get away from the hooks that are getting you all caught up in your nefarious deeds. Had Obama been as "smart" as he tends to think he is, he'd have stayed clear of ever attempting that crap.
@Waverlywray1 @LHollenkamp @MSNBC There was more than one involved, so this is still a plot to take down a sitting @POTUS. One I'd believe,, but not knowing there are more involved. While the FBI had 1 and maybe 2, I don't put it past the CIA to have done the same thing, Clapper [CIA] is involved.
@poconomtn A Peace prize. The Congressional Medal of Honor given to a member of the military living or dead for going above and beyond the call of duty putting one's life in jeopardy. The highest award the military can get and they tell what others did not themselves.
@MSNBC No evidence, huh, did they scrub the documents to save their hides. We know someone was placed in the campaign so start looking towards the CIA for that placement. As for Adam Schiff, if anything is said it'll come from his mouth. He'll need shackles/cuffs and jail.
@bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump The problem stems from the TOP of the Obama Administration. He was dead set against anything TRUMP because he said what he'd do. Now that he's in office, he's doing exactly what he said he'd do. Obama's underlings are still obstructing incl. the Dems and House Leadership.
@SpeakerRyan IT seems to be a shame that you are unwilling to bring bills up for a vote, frustrating your fellow Reps, but not only them the PUBLIC. You'd better start thinking of WE THE PEOPLE rather than you. We Want Action NOW! Not a wait and see attitude. Or you are a DEM.
@RepAdamSchiff NEW / Justice Dept. announces briefing attendees tomorrow - there will be two meetings. One for Nunes/Gowdy at 12PM, then another adding Gang of Eight at  2 PM. John Kelly will attend, too. Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth for once?
@MSNBC @RepAdamSchiff @maddow It would be nice for Adam Schiff to get the story right and say the gang of 8 will meet at 2 PM but Gowdy/Nunes would meet at 12 NOON. And Rachel Maddow had that information as well, She's not much of a reporter.
@Thomas1774Paine Way to go END TITLE 10 PERMANENTLY. Planned Parenthood needs to rethink its name as well. The Murder of Unborn Children, Assn. then the people going there would really know what you are really about. Time to think people about taking appropriate things for SAFE SEX, not say oops. https://t.co/y6ognvkzXw
@starcrosswolf @SenSchumer Tell you what Mr. Schumer as soon as you figure out you DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OF BOTH HOUSES as you did for 8 years and you passed the most unaffordable health bill ever. Then and only then will thing get right. Removal of Obama Care would be the best thing for this country.
@TheLastRefuge2 He fell for the trick, so now he gets egg in his face. I guess that's better than having rotten tomatoes thrown at you. He ought to be glad his stage is inside and not where folks could pelt him for his inability of BACKCHECKING ALL INFO.
@TheLastRefuge2 It wasn't a misunderstanding either, it was stupidity and not doing the job of backchecking where the information came from. He's smart enough to read, then he should be smart enough to backcheck where the information came from. It was someone trying to make FOX look like the MSM
@dylanmsmitty Obama is a Socialist leaning towards communism, neither of which are good for a FREE PEOPLE. Any time a person goes around the world to Muslim nations and apologizes for the actions of the US people, he's up to no good. You'd better find out about Alinsky, not good.
@Thomas1774Paine They have both been thrown under the bus, but for Comey, he has an immunity given him by Mueller. Lynch has a problem and it'll depend on how much she wants to take all of the heat for pulling this stupid stunt.
@GartrellLinda If I were he, I'd put myself in the open around senior citizens. We [I'm one] don't have gr8 eyesight, our hearing unless we wear hearing aids isn't that good. So, he'd fit right in. On the other hand, he might have concrete overshoes. You'd never find him.
@TomHall And the ability of the cat, in this case, to tell how far something is away from them. My Black bobtail cat jumps from the back of my computer chair 42" to the top of a 72"birdcage over a 48"gap.without  any problems. When the cages (3) attached together are covered she climbs it
@Thomas1774Paine Don isn't all he's cracked up to be. Anyone who will call another a racist is by definition a racist themselves. Like I said he didn't remember he has a caged animal within him, it's behind bars. What is it? I'll let E1 take guesses. Good Luck.
@Thomas1774Paine It wasn't such a bright idea this close to an actual mass shooting. Those children, their parents need an EXPENSIVE lesson. Since they most likely had not thought to notify the appropriate law enforcement agency of this supposed prank. This is not even funny it's deadly.
@Thomas1774Paine But it was OK for Brennan to spy on the opposition party during the election, right? WRONG!!! You are a fool, a clown, a halfwit, a dullard, a buffoon, a shmuck, a ding-dong, an imbecile, a nincompoop, and to top it off a simpleton. Best I could give his actions as a JACKASS. https://t.co/HOpYc9g4hu
@DFBHarvard Yup they did more than that, they brought up the "Dossier" while Carter Page was at a conference in London, not the other way around. They have a forked tongue, so how do you expect them to tell the truth? Awe, there goes another lead that brought on a FISA Warrant. 2x jeopardy.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear @TedLieu: Thank you for reminding E1 to follow the money spent on that "Dossier" and to those who would push it like it's a real thing. You have to understand that what you would wish for will come back and haunt you in the long run. But they weren't looking at the Dems.
@EdmundHulton Yup you got that right, Democrat Obstructionist Party only one letter missing the "E". But then again that might be the way they are making the money the DNC need now that they don't have any operating cash. They Broke themselves on Hillary and that "Dossier". Paying piper now. https://t.co/5FPDzRe0B5
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner @VanJones68 @BernieSanders 2 People Broke the Democrat Party, they allowed it to be done. Hillary Clinton basically took over the DNC and used it as a cash cow, Obama spent money like it was there as well. But where is the outcry for their heads, I don't hear it. Oh, they buried their heads in the sand. https://t.co/QufNM1mEAX
@SallyQYates You are one to talk refusing to follow a Presidential order because you didn't like it. Got news for you-you do it anyway. What a shame that you didn't do what was asked, Mr. Trump would not have caught on as fast as he did to the collision in the FBI. So, thank you.
@MSNBC @Lawrence No, he should not resign, but he should point out that what is being asked to be done wasn't legal. But on the other hand, he also knew @POTUS would declassify all documents, and that the FBI would have been shown to be FOOLS. The attached picture is another name word for fool. https://t.co/bTcACnbsuJ
@American1299 @EricHolder Eric Holder should have spoken out when it was proposed to be done. But what did he do, actually ZIP NADA? So, he has NO LEGS TO STAND ON. He is involved though, so he's as guilty as those who actually did it. Yes, he is desperate over what is going to come out of it. Jackass https://t.co/2kwZsIwLSz
@oohlala143 @Icqpeople21 @TGaud999 @RBTrepessa @HerbertEricSte2 @nytimes @charlie_savage Yes, it would be good to see that ALL of the CRAP that went on was due to one person, OBAMA. But all of those who helped are as GUILTY as he is, ONLY HIS OF TREASON. Don't bother asking me if I'm mad, heck yes. But I'm mad at that DO NOTHING CONGRESS and the DEMOCRATS leadership
@jasoninthehouse The basic problem started when Obama opened the borders to anyone. Background checks were never done nor were they going to be done. Now you are wondering how we got all of these "undesirables" in the country. Well, go find Obama and let him know what and how you are feeling. GL
@Thomas1774Paine The Leftist MSM is searching for something that they can hold against @POTUS, but they are falling short. If they would look for something good it just might surprise E1, but I doubt that they know how to find good things to talk about. I hate it when the ASS-U-ME. They are urs. https://t.co/ok2d7uxRmu
@Thomas1774Paine He;'s playing dead, I a sneaking hunch says if some of our good guys would look into cubby-holes where they would go and hide, they'll find him. He knew what he was doing was wrong from the get-go but didn't care. If I were he, I'd go where Senior Adults are living and blend in,
@MAGAALLTHEWAY GITMO would be the best place for them. But Obama is starting to feel those cuffs going onto wrists and legs in the form of shackles, but he isn't the only one in that line. He does say he wants to take $100 Million of our tax dollars with him to Africa. He gets there he's gone.
@Zola1611 @rektredpill @jojoh888 @ExtinctMedia @Trumperland @RealSlimSupreme @writemombritt @Redheaded_Jenn @USAHotLips @Fuctupmind @michaelbeatty3 @FascistTwatter @SamS_RTR @AMErikaNGIRLBOT With Rep's like him, the Dems don't have anything to worry about. After all, they are DEAD BROKE [or should that be BROKEN]. But I found his best image for anyone who wants to use it. https://t.co/d5E9E0Pe6P
@mflynnJR But ALL 11 of them are as guilty as sin of using the FBI to work against a  political campaign. Then of using opposition research to get FISA warrants, not telling the judge where the information came from. We have to tell the truth, they certainly didn't.
@Millennial_Dems Awe, when did you really read the 2nd Amendment? You haven't yet, then you have NO LEG TO STAND ON. Understand it doesn't say anything about an AR. It does, on the other hand, say the states can have a well-founded militia and that the citizens have the right to bear arms. https://t.co/Hatel0aRF3
@Jim_Jordan I was listening to a video of you talking to a group of people about what the govt did or didn't do correctly. With that, I do not find fault, I was in Cuba a few years ahead of you back in '63-75. USNS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba Gr8 climate, they still drove '57 autos.
@qkode Couldn't happen to a better person. He should have known better, but he's such a hack, he felt impregnable didn't think he'd be caught and now that he is, he's going to learn the hard way. But for the rest of you, you'll have to remember this ... https://t.co/doYRToXjXn
@DemolitionRanch I think I know how to get you to stop doing that. Just think about what you see. https://t.co/8NwQj55NUu
@RexTillersom Well if Obama is allowed to leave the country taking $100M to Africa you can bet your bottom dollar he's up to no good. To put a stoop to him before he leaves in July, he needs to be incarcerated. Don't let that traitor leave the country he'll never come back. https://t.co/Sa6ZqoA87C
@drawandstrike I found both of their staffs all monkeying around. Don't let them lose or leave the country with that supposed $100M Obama wants to take with him to Africa. He's up to NO GOOD. https://t.co/TT1ZnUQ2Im
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Ritalin. Side Effects: May cause new or worsening psychosis, especially if you have a history of depression, mental illness. This stuff can alter how a child's brain develops https://t.co/e1UP0UNB3Q
@RepAndyBiggsAZ They might sound good, but getting them to pass 2/3rds of the States is another matter. Don't count your chickens before they hatch. Also as long as you are going at the 2nd Amendment find out how many of those shooters were on Ritalin as a child or young adult. Side Effects
@YoussefDisla Would you look at those monkeys? They need a cage to go into NOW. https://t.co/dv6s2drn75
@covfefeartist The Monkeys were playing their tricks, but we saw through their crap. Now their staff is starting to monkey around again and we'd better get them caged up. https://t.co/mRXV9oWEcY
@RealJamesWoods His staff has been monkeying around long enough. https://t.co/FD4uflAnP5
@Mike_Press19 Have you seen her staff, it looks like they are playing. https://t.co/zQL2gNa3hw
@RedNationRising In his dreams. He's going to try and pay someone or a group off for their misdoings. Better grab him and put him in those Pink and Purple Polka Dot prison gear. Instead of going to Africa, he needs to go to GITMO. His staff is working overtime, see the attached picture. https://t.co/sNRgl0GR9J
@TeamYouTube I saw where your group put up a 504 Error done on a show chat while showing the lava going downhill and a CBC broadcast. https://t.co/ZylfmFjScG
@robreiner Rob Reiner is so demented that he thinks that when something good is done it's bad for him or the left liberals he associates with. What a shame, he doesn't start looking around him and see people getting more money in their checks. Oh, yeah, he's in that Ultra Liberal Sanctuary
@RedNationRising But his prison gear needs to be Pink and Purple Polka Dots with ruffles around his arms and ankles. The food he's given needs to be PORK since they aren't cloven-hoofed lovers of that meat.
@EdKane15 @mandymendez90 @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump Might be in their little toe in both cases. They act like they don't have a thought, but are willing to follow, so someone has a brain. I understand that some don't have backbones either, because they run when authorities show up, like the Cowards they are.
@drawandstrike @Ali_H_Soufan It was a matter of TRUST  and the other DISTRUST.
@ChristieD733 Leaving a thinly veiled threat to the @POTUS is one thing that I would like to think you would know better of doing. But I don't think he cares what anyone thinks. Thoughts were taken from the Gateway Pundit https://t.co/ahp6RH7xAF
@4usa1st @LouDobbs But as Christians, we will allow supposed "persecuted people" into our countries. And that will be us giving it to them, without our knowledge. Remember a Muslim can Lie, Steal, and Murder without breaking their Quran. I serve the One True GOD, JEHOVA, He will shield me always.
@4usa1st @LouDobbs Now we can rest assured we know what he was doing on those tours making apologizing for our not being like he is. Well, Obama did one thing that NO ONE is mentioning. It's the Invasion of Muslims into Christian countries. They could not beat us through war back in the 1400's.
@KatTheHammer1 @RealJamesWoods @USAHotLips @Zola1611 @ClintonMSix141 @IvanTrumpovic1 @VFL2013 @ArizonaKayte @alozras411 @DineshDSouza Those lame brain DemocRATS thought the maker said rain and ran away the other direction instead of getting their brains. They have been proving it every day. Only one thing they learned was how to be stubborn, like the Jack Asses they are. That is until they see that Camel. https://t.co/lQAeseK7jC
@drawandstrike They wasted a lot of time and money on Papadopoulos then because he never did anything of value within the campaign. BA at DePaul Univ.but he's slightly naive in thinking he'd get anything Russian.
@mandymendez90 @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump They still need tracking chips inserted where they can't dig them out. One suggestion was close to their hearts, another was the base of the brain. So if they sever the spinal cord, oh well.
@realDonaldTrump Good luck getting the FBI/DOJ to do what you are telling them that you want to be done, they'll slow roll you as well,.
@chrissussdorf That is going to tell anyone willing to ROB YOU, YOU ARE NOT PROTECTED. Now that isn't as bright as you might like to think it is really. Let what I just said sink in and think about your social media, letting e1 know You are disarmed.
@mrselfexpressio @drawandstrike Deputy attorney general Robert Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller because “our friends all have stuff on him,” according to private messages exchanged by five federal government employees on the day Mueller was appointed in May 2017. See attached. https://t.co/m88DrZVBLA
@MrEdTrain They'd look better in Pink Prison outfits and being behind bars with their friends. I'd like to see the both of them being led out of the Houses of Congress in shackles and leg irons.
@drawandstrike Well, Rosenstein is still part of Uranium One no matter how you cut it. And I know about 5 CIA individuals who Blackmailed Rosenstein into picking Mueller, but that doesn't take him out of the Uranium One crap yet. But you got Yates; Bill Clinton; and Halper.
@buddycoleman568 @starcrosswolf @jobeeswing The child the person should be expecting. They need to change their name to planned killers of babies. https://t.co/PO2fu13aNp
@RedNationRising Your rescue would not like my 3 female cats or 13 exotic birds. Although I do like the idea it doesn't want what you are eating. The birds, on the other hand, can eat whatever I'm eating not candied yams, coffee, chocolate, and avocado. One of the Quakers has had duck, not Quaker
@MSNBC It's a shame that he doesn't interject good thoughts, but would rather tear everything that is being done up. Republican strategist, more like DemocRAT in Republican clothing. He might as well resign, his job, also he's giving sensitive information, which isn't for the public.
@RepGregoryMeeks So you think Mr. Mueller is doing everything right, only going after @POTUS in spite of the overwhelming evidence that the Democrats were the ones colluding with the Russians. Right, or should Mueller follow the leads into the Democrat party as well.
@American1299 @realDonaldTrump When you start investigating Mr. Mueller for his transgressions against the American people. His involvement in the Uranium One cover-up. He wants to keep your eyes off of his shady misdealings. His "Dog and Pony Show" is about to come to an abrupt halt. We The People Are Tired.
@amjoyshow @MichaelAvenatti What better way to throw everyone off of his shady activities than to lay blame at someone else.
@Thomas1774Paine Dream on Hillary, you caused the upheaval with the citizens of this country.  Had you not cheated during your campaign, you just might have won. But YOU can't tell the truth about anything, Benghazi, Uranium One, Bernie Sanders campaign. You robbed the DNC's money. You are a liar
@RexTillersom Yup and I'm Very Proud he is
@PhxKen And California wanted to be a sanctuary state. Ok, let them do it. CUT OFF ALL FUNDS GOING TO THE STATE SO THAT THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS STUPIDITY.
@cs0058sc Don't let any DemocRAT hold those purse strings, they'll rob you blind the same way they did the DNC.
@RealJamesWoods MSybe if MS Warren would admit she's not an American Indian blood relative she might be believed, but I doubt it. She's so colluded in her thinking that it's laughable.
@jasoninthehouse Congratulations Jason. I don't have children only GR8 Nephews / Nieces, rent a kid is so much fun. Spoil them rotten and give them back to their parents.[joking]  Although, I did have a Boy Scout Troop from which came 3 Eagle Scouts. 1 is now the Rev. Dr. Edward R, Glaize
@skylark723 @BCtruthseeker @RodStryker @hickorymtnman I did say "if" and that refers to active duty members. I live near 2 Air Force Bases [Eglin and Hurlburt on Fld #9 Eglin AFB], NAS Pensacola, Camp Rudder Army Ranger Training, Naval EOD Range 51 on the Eglin AFB Reservation. I'm Ret CWO3 USN 28 years.
@BCtruthseeker @FoolSeya @RodStryker @hickorymtnman You have me on the children, I have 11 Gr8 Nephews / Nieces, 3 female cats 13 exotic birds [11 Cockatiels and 2 Quaker Parrots]. I inherited my parents home upon their deaths from Cancer. My Mom was told if she tried Chemo she'd have 2 months and 5 months without. She got 5 mo.
@SusanStormXO @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @RoxxxyGurL @RampsMAGARants @ExDemLatina @GartrellLinda @Grizzle_Meister @ice_princeza @phil4gop @GIJoeOPS @GemMar333 @DonnaWR8 Now that sounds good to me. I know the RATS won't go for the deal. Then the other thing you could do it to stop the obstructionist crap those RATS are putting out. Yeah, I know, I'm calling Democrats RATS cause that is what they really are.
@RepAdamSchiff Adam, "What's good for the Goose, is Good for the Gander.", so you are willing to let everyone see where you are getting your funding as well.
@RedNationRising Pepe-Le-Pew, and that's why no one wanted to go near him to get it.
@covfefeartist They need to be shut down permanently for illegal activities. Spying on the opposition isn't exactly legal especially since they don't care about what they are doing to this country.
@BCtruthseeker @RodStryker @hickorymtnman The child wasn't 18, so he was not legal to have that pistol in the first place.  The shotgun should be used under supervision for hunting, not for shooting children and adults. If he did that and his Father was active military, it would be on his Father's record, no promotions.
@hickorymtnman The child in Texas got his guns from his father, there was NO BACKGROUND CHECK done on him since he didn't make the purchase. But the Father of an underage individual needs to be held responsible for what his son did. Parents of underage children are as guilty as the child is.
@Thomas1774Paine But that's ALL the Clinton News Network knows how to do. Push the Mueller probe till it comes back and haunts them for fomenting their lies. When it doesn't they won't be able to show their faces anywhere they go.
@KrisMcGurk Harry's been to the war twice, have you gone once? As a Viet-Nam era vet, it's not nice to be shot at by someone that you can't see. From my perspective, "You don't have a leg to stand on when you complain since you aren't willing to put your life on the line.".
@piersmorgan On the Church steps as they were leaving it. You seemed to think this wasn't such a good idea. But you have to understand  Harry's 6th in line to the throne and he's going to break all sorts of traditions. Good for Harry and Meghan they are right for each other.
@RubyRockstar333 @MarkWarner @SonofLiberty357 @REALtrumpbureau @RodStryker @Patriotic_Va @SiddonsDan @GmanFan45 @deanbc1 @hickorymtnman @RampsMAGARants @DanOHerrin They seem to know how to obstruct rather well, now they'll watch the destruction of their party from the inside. What a shame, they played dirty tricks throughout and now it's rubbing off on them. They will learn in the long run it isn't good to be deceitful all of the time.
@RubyRockstar333 @MarkWarner @SonofLiberty357 @REALtrumpbureau @RodStryker @Patriotic_Va @SiddonsDan @GmanFan45 @deanbc1 @hickorymtnman @RampsMAGARants @DanOHerrin Seems to me that Rep. Mark Warner better start looking over his shoulder, especially since he's part of the DEEP STATE. He's; letting the snakes out of his bag of tricks, only to find them squashed and laid at his feet. He's in for the dirty surprise, one that Nancy is sitting in
@TracyMFinch Seems to me to be the "Pot calling the kettle Black" because the VA Problem was during the Obama Administration, but Nancy put it ALL on Trump. She doesn't want to admit that it started on her watch. What a shame that she so far into the QUAGMIRE that she doesn't speak the truth.
@RepAdamSchiff Adam do you have any spare room? Since you are living in the DC area, you ought to open it up to these upstanding gang members who deal in drugs that kill our children. These are the people that you seem to want to appease. Calling them anything but what they really are.
@Thomas1774Paine Hold on there, they always jump the gun and get the horse before the cart. They never backcheck the information to be sure that they got it right in the first place. But the reason they are FAKE news is their name got changed to Clinton News Network and that explains it perfectly
@MaCQ9N @realDonaldTrump But add Page and Strzok and McCabe.
RT @MaCQ9N: Most Wanted for Treason and SEDITION in an attempted Coup to remove our beloved @realDonaldTrump from Office:- 	1. Lynch	2. Com…
@CaroleAlways45 @bigleaguepol That tells everyone where the DEEP STATE RESIDES. The CIA wants @POTUS, not in the President's office that he won. But Rosenstein didn't have to give a special dispensation to Mueller to broaden his reach.
@qkode That knucklehead can speak for himself because he doesn't represent anyone else but himself. As a retired CWO3 with 28 years service, I resent his statement. The Veterans that I know all voted for Trump and are all honorably discharged. So, he must be talking about his service.
@President45US Good idea, now how do you tell who's a liberal? But in this case, you also need to after the Father of the boy who got the shotgun and pistol from him. The background check was done on the Dad, not the child. Parents who allow children guns have immediate responsibility, period.
@mflynnJR No kidding, young man. FYI I was 13 when your Dad was born, and he was 4 when I graduated from Highschool and college. He has 5 yrs more in the military than I have, but that's fine. CWO3 dual service Navy and Army. In footsteps of my, Dad was Army/AirCorps LtCol during the war.
@gr8tjude @BreitbartNews Sounds good to me, he's got a level head on his shoulders and isn't afraid of making a few waves.
@JohnCooper0610 His face started looking like that when he found out the Democrat party was being renamed. See the picture below. https://t.co/2C8yMXzbLI
@drawandstrike You'd better do a thorough background check on Rod Rosenstein's activities in Maryland. They were not good at all, it showed prosecutorial weaponization of his office while there. Seems to be the same thing he's doing with the Mueller probe as well. He DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BACK.
@FoxNews @RandPaul Sounds like he/she is confused in thought train  NO AR-15 was used, but a shotgun and a 38 pistol were. Red Flag was the shirt he had on Facebook about wanting to kill. He got the guns from his Dad, so there was no Background done on him. Weapons in the right hand are better.
@sxdoc Awe, he got caught composing.
@sxdoc Sounds like Whitey Bulger and the cover-up for the FBI gang who really did the murders that 4 innocent men were accused of. That faux-pas only costs the tax-payers $101Million. But that is all on Mueller's watch in Boston. Oops, it got remembered, Mr. Mueller.
@CHIZMAGA He got the guns from his Dad. A shotgun and a 38 pistol, no AR-15 was used, although there were explosives found in the school and around the grounds. They were also checking the house he lived in for more explosives. But he didn't buy the weapons so Red Flags don't help.
@RodStryker @mflynnJR Schiff for brains is one reason the party's name is changing. Se attached picture. https://t.co/ZsiG6dgzpI
@BlueSea1964 Has the ICE Dept thought of having a tracking chip injected into everyone that they deport? I could just see it blips going off and telling them right where they are. They would be giving their own locations away and those of their other members. Tracking chips like cars have.
@TuckerCarlson Just sent this to Jeff Denham: You're one who has helped change your party's name too? Saying that Obama did something that wasn't legal from the get-go doesn't make your solution right. Try, try again, this time get your head screwed on in the right direction.
@RepJeffDenham Are you one who has helped change your party's name from Democrat too? Saying that Obama did something that wasn't legal from the get-go doesn't make your solution right either. Try, try again, this time get your head screwed on in the right direction. https://t.co/xyiMQdg6tw
@RedNationRising So did I, but he's also responsible for changing the Democrat party's name as well. https://t.co/0acuhLDxAg
@Thomas1774Paine She should also know it was a POST OFFICE before it became a hotel. So she had stuff shipped into it. But just look at her, she looks like a shady character, one who needs to watched, at all times to be sure she's on the up and up. She and her peers changed the party's name. https://t.co/syH5xmoXfa
For all those who say we need to remove guns from law-abiding citizens. You are forgetting that people who want to shoot up others aren't law abiding citizens. Also, the newest shooter had a shotgun, not an assault rifle. What we need is MANDATORY BACKGROUND CHECKS. A 3-day wait.
@Thomas1774Paine Hmm, a scumbag, a swindler, a real jackass of a man. Most likely he's never had his mouth washed out with soap either, followed by a big dose of Cod Liver Oil. For those as old as I am Cokes used to be gotten from Drug Store counters, not bottles.
@realDonaldTrump They don't want to do that, it'll make them look bad. As if they don't already by the way they handled the entire Clinton thing. Heck, they White-washed it, gave her a pass instead of JAIL.	On to the shooting, he used a shotgun no assault rifle. Had bombs, and a friend with him.
@Thomas1774Paine And they ask us why we don't trust them. They have proved it over and over, they have NO REGARD for the truth, don't want to put out real news that has been properly backchecked. They certainly don't want a Senior Citizen telling them that they are colluded.
@NJ_Optimist @conserv_tribune Opportunity knocks but once. Then there is repercussion that they will regret. But what they haven't changed is the new name for their party, since they have lost Democrat. They are now ... https://t.co/c6OKOAWNVu
@MADE__USA @TruthFeedNews They need to have a REBOOT SWITCH and remove those who are forgetting what country they are living in. If they hate it as much as they are acting,, there is no excuse for punishing good Americans because they hate the US. Heck, the parties name is almost changed as it is. https://t.co/rzRtvKt3qP
@EdmundHulton But you've got to understand the Democrat party's name is being changed to something more realistic. Think about it. Would you like their name change? Does it fit their description? Do they obstruct? Do they Love the US? = NO. The picture says it all. https://t.co/OD4kf3Yau0
@FIGHTINGVETERAN @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump @DNC But you've got to understand the Democrat party's name is being changed to something more realistic. Think about it.

@PatrioticCindy Some of them came when Obama invited people to come and the problem was that they didn't have any real income except gang relationships, then came the drugs. They made their presence known for the wrong reasons, now they have law enforcement watching and now ICE.
@Thomas1774Paine I wonder hos that back brace will look with shackles and metal bracelets? It would serve her right. But instead of having her hands face each other turn them back to back, it's harder to pick a lock that way.
@RodStryker @TuckerCarlson MS-13 the Drug Cartel made up of Hispanic and Latino young adults and teenagers. Most of them snuck into this country so they try staying under the RADAR. Had they done the right thing and made a positive thing out of their lives they would not feel the HEAT of the Law and ICE.
@NancyPelosi BALLS 	The sport of choice for corporate executives and officers is GOLF. 		THE AMAZING CONCLUSION: 		The higher you go in the corporate structure, the smaller your balls become. 		There must be a boat load ofCongress members in Washington playing MARBLES.
@Thomas1774Paine That could make him a DEADBEAT in legal circles. There are also a few other names that could be used but that one fits the bill.
@GinaHospel Please understand as long as Mueller can keep the spotlight off of himself and the rest of his Kabal he's safe. But look at who is involved, remember someone in that group vouched for Rosenstein to be Asst. AG. He's not good for anything but to COVER-UP WRONG-DOING.
@poconomtn As long as Mueller can keep the spotlight off of himself and the rest of his Kabal he's going to feel somewhat safe. But look at who is involved, remember someone in that group vouched for Rosenstein to be Asst. AG. He's not good for anything but to COVER-UP WRONG-DOING.
@SusanStormXO @realDonaldTrump So what did you expect from a person who would call a cop "Skinhead" as a RACIST demeaning comment? She needs a course in diversity management, the same courses WHITE Civil Servants get. But she would not call herself a RACIST though, but what she said did.
@jasoninthehouse Rosenstein is NOT on YOUR SIDE nor is SESSIONS when you stop and think about it. He's giving you pieces [crumbs] of what you are asking for, then noty making sure it was  done. His pulling himself out of the Comey was a sure indication he DOESN'T HAVE YOUR BACK.
@Jim_Jordan Rod, your background in Maryland is going to catch up with you, as well as your expanding Mr. Mueller's probe to more than what the CONGRESS had authorized it for. I also know what Peter Strzok was saying when he mentioned "Insurance Policy" to my friends in Congress.
@Thomas1774Paine But should they NOT want to compromise, they can terminate hr show and she'd be out on the street. Sometimes you have to do what the management says to do even if you don't happen to agree with the decision.
@LindseyGrahamSC I just sent this to Rosenstein: Your shoddy background in Maryland is going to catch up with you, you've expanded Mr. Mueller's probe more than what the CONGRESS authorized it for. I know what Peter Strzok said "Insurance Policy" as do my friends in Higher places
@MAGANinaJo @ScottPresler I have something that just might help you with this slight problem. Just look at these supposed leaders of the opposite party. They are going to help sink them deeper into the quagmire. https://t.co/BMpiGb09Se
@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis Good Luck with that and the reason I say it that way is because of the Chief of Staff. He's been interjecting his thoughts into the mix.I'll bet he will have read it before the President even gets it. You can get a message to him is for his signature on;y on the receipt.
@TuckerCarlson Charles Krauthammer has take on Donald Trump:. Trump Is Not A Liberal or Conservative, He's a "Pragmatist." (Definition: A pragmatist is someone who is practical and focused on reaching a goal. A pragmatist usually has a straightforward, matter-of-fact approach.)
@gjathanas He needs to know EXACTLY what the 2nd Amendment says:	The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Now argue that.
@1a Donald Trump put his total financial empire at risk in running for president and certainly did not need or possibly even want the job; that says it all.  He wants success for the U.S. and her citizens because he loves his country.	God Bless America	~ Dr. Charles Krauthammer
@1a Dr. Charles Krauthammer ~ I submit a pragmatist is just what America needs right now. People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance, but that is common among those who have never accomplished anything in their lives
@1a  Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to "out crazy" one another. Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding
@1a  does what he says he will do and; 	(5) He is someone who understands it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.
@1a (4) He says what he is thinking, is unapologetic for his outspoken thoughts, speaks very straightforward using everyday language that can be understood by all (and is offensive to some who dislike him anyway) making him a great communicator, for the most part,
@1a (2) They are unaccustomed to hearing a president speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who he owes vis-a-vis donations; 	(3) He is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology;
@1a You may not like Donald Trump, but I suspect the reason some people do not like him is because: 	(1) He is antithetical to the "good old boy" method of brokering back room deals that fatten the coffers of politicians;
@1a Trump Is Not A Liberal or Conservative, He's a "Pragmatist." (Definition: A pragmatist is someone who is practical and focused on reaching a goal. A pragmatist usually has a straightforward, matter-of-fact approach and doesn't let emotion distract him or her.)
@WCASFL I have 2 Black cats, one is bob-tail and the other has a full tail. That is in addition to a long-haired Calico. All three are female and have been spayed, they have chips in them and they stay inside. Those 2 Black cats are now 4 yrs and the Calico is 10 years. All 3 are lovers. https://t.co/NliafKkljy
@President45US No kidding, anyways if you think about it she was a plant to get your side into trouble.
@EdmundHulton Not a bad but it'll kick up a firestorm over1st Amendment rites being over-ridden by the FCC. First, you input the rule, then after a short period, you enforce it. Now they know the rules and as you are aware they'll push the boundaries of the rule. The rule needs to be strong.
@Thomas1774Paine If she didn't speak until spoken to she'd be better off. But it is the left who wants to interject needlessly their own opinions. She screwed up when she allowed the Hillary Clinton campaign to take over the DNC before winning the nomination. She needs to QUIT going after the NRA
@RedNationRising That is an invasion of your 1st Amendment rights to free speech. They might object, but putting a shadowban on free speech is UNAMERICAN.
@EdmundHulton W2G Jeff, now you are going to learn the hard way why "Tax and Spend" isn't a good idea. When it hits you in the "wallet"m you'll understand why businesses are leaving California because of their usury taxes. The same thing might hit Seattle for just that reason.
@Thomas1774Paine She's one to talk, unmasking individuals on the opposing party for political means is ILLEGAL, so don't say anything till all of your hidden thoughts and deeds are spotless.
@SpeakerRyan It's positively amazing you are acting like a little girl afraid of doing or saying something that might make the DemocRATS mad. Well, I have news for you if you don't start acting like a real Speaker of the House, you will lose it to those DemocRATS. Are you one?
Is the "Witch Hunt" is on last legs after Sen. Mark Warner said. The top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence acknowledged in a recent interview that contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russians could be “a set of coincidences” rather than collusion.
@realDonaldTrump Please remember he's also being backed by George Soros, so that also lets you know where this is going. They are pulling the same crap they pulled during the Whitey Bulger case up in Boston, with many of the same players involved for the Govt. Mueller doesn't learn from mistakes.
@EdmundHulton Good idea. Someone must not have liked or wanted children, but to learn the proper ways of doing sex was too hard for SIMPLE MINDS to take in. They'd rather have throw-away children and not think of the future.  Now look at our Muslim members of society they will outnumber you.
@EdmundHulton I'm Christian, raised that way, studied Theology in college, there's nowhere in the newer history that GOD was removed except by Atheists. Since the DemocRATS want that then they and their followers will be assigned to the firey pit called HELL. If they want this they are doomed.
@EdmundHulton Then they'll hate this as well, I know for a fact Planned Parenthood hates this. The Dems are backing Planned Parenthood, which doesn't do anything but abortions, instead of teaching the correct way. One would think the Dems would not be on board since they are losing new voters. https://t.co/QA2Z4DBT4x
@EdmundHulton Huh, you mean like Michelle Obama telling women if they voted they have no minds and couldn't use their GOD given brains?  That kind of thing was aimed at the poor and illiterate, which in all of the past years while the Democrat party did nothing for education. Them, right?
@bgood12345 Awe gee I've got another one for your collection of people who need to go with him. This names his henchmen and lady. But whoever recommended Rosenstein be Asst AG did Trump no favor. https://t.co/PvzKV8Qw7w
@TGowdySC  While Trump picked Rod Rosenstein, that doesn't mean he's for @realDonaldTrump. He's still knee deep in the Uranium One crap, so let's get off that idea @POTUS picked him. I want to know WHO RECOMMENDED him because he didn't do the AG or @POTUS any favors. McCabe maybe
@FranSism1g Those former Obama officials don't represent the US Government anymore so they can be gotten for TREASON.
@MrEdTrain Do understand he's also being backed by George Soros. But what I'd rather see is him being led out in chains for the inaction he didn't take during the Uranium One crap. He was the FBI Director back when that was taking place. It's time for him. Jailing him in GITMO would be kind
@TheNYevening Now throw the BOOK AT HIM giving him the Maximum plus 1 day, will make it so he doesn't get parole till the sentence is totally carried out.
@Homeless4POTUS @rebeccaOden1 @Thomas1774Paine @SenSchumer He's not thinking about the repercussions of what he's doing. I've been shooting weapons since I was 7 and I'm pushing 73 now. But I also had training and proper supervision at that young age. I'm rated, Expert and the military loved it. Ret CWO3 US Navy, 28 years.
@Thomas1774Paine And those who still think he's a "hero" are fooling themselves. He lied about prisoners being left in N. Viet-Nam, had his Dad Adm, McCain hide his records so they wouldn't see the light of day. What's he so afraid of, that he had his records hidden? Except for the fact he lied.
@realDonaldTrump Do understand Chuch Schumer is a TWO-FACED LIAR, HE went against the deal when Obama was in office, but accepted money from the deal once it was done, now he's against your ending it because he'll lose his kickback.
@Thomas1774Paine Just like the DemocRATS to come out with that. But don't bother to tell the public about your Concealed Carry Permit. If he can do it so can you DO NOT LET THEM OR ANYONE TAKE AWAY YOUR 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHT. https://t.co/l0qijoZ5Qc
@drawandstrike @FoxNews You know they tell you not to have food where the nose of a bear can smell it, so this baker got his/her just desserts.
@philadper2014 Have you ever told him he has a FLAT TIRE on the opposite side of the car from him [best if it pouring down rain] then he goes out and looks, He comes back in and says it aren't flat.  You retort they are all flat on the bottom. Now that is a true statement, and at best, he's wet
@4everconstant @PatrioticCindy @knight51353 Now hold on thar folks, she's proving that she's one brick short of a full load, her elevator doesn't stop on all floors, one feather short of a full bird. She just escaped from her pen at the National Zoo.
Well here goes nothing and yet it is something you can view from the USGS website. For those on the big island, this might help you understand what is going on with those 16 fissures that are there now.	https://t.co/sPqOArzS8k
@Thomas1774Paine If you can't take the heat get out of the frying pan, but right now you have a more serious question.  Are you Anti-American as well? Or do you need to regroup those DemocRATS in the DONKEY pens at the National Zoo? And don't let the door hit you as you enter.
@usacsmret But China could not keep its CO2 emissions down either, but I do not see them listed. Better make a new listing with all involved instead of cherrypicking them so your chart looks good.
@RealMAGASteve To put it even closer he's to close to finding out James Comey is a DEEP STATE liar he did so to Congress, thinking he could get away with it. Now he's been putting tinder onto the coals and he's afraid of what's about to happen. He and Mueller worked on his testimony, he a FRAUD
@DevinNunes Anytime Susan Hennessey is involved, you can bet the DemocRATS are behind it and they HATE DEVIN NUNES because he's getting too close o their crap with the election. They need to be called on the carpet for doing so too.
@SP4Freedom And English happens to be the 5th language she is fluent in. instead of bullying her you ought to be emulating her. Stop and think could I do that.  If the answer is no then leave in shame.  I took Hebrew and Greek 50 years ago while studying Theology Bachelors, Bullies are fools
@WayneDupreeShow They do it to Conservatives, it's their way of showing their disapproval of your 1st Amendment rights.
@RedNationRising Hold him in Contempt of Congress IN JAIL. Also while you are holding him give him HARSH treatment sleep, flickering lights, loud music, take away his watch so he doesn't know what time of day or night it is. I said nothing about waterboarding him since he is a cowardly leader.
@RedNationRising I think he's escaped from the National  Zoo's Donkey exhibit. This idiot uses profanity on an advertisement, might need a visit from the FCC to give him some guidance on what is acceptable language.
@Mmarty1230 @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @DNC @DNCE @dncpress @dccc @RealJamesWoods @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Could be because the druggist has stopped delivering medications to those geriatric Congress members.
@Thomas1774Paine He has the Russians to back him like they did in Afghanistan.
@realDonaldTrump It's simple DON'T PAY THEM FOR NOT WORKING.
@jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump I'll believe that when I've seen it for my self, otherwise, I'm skeptical. I'm remembering his Father and Grandfather doing the same thing to get what they wanted and then they went back on their word.
@RedNationRising Well if he Dindu Nuffin, why is he trying to disguise his unforgettable face? Most likely to have a laugh at the rest of us, but I found the real person using that moniker as a comedian. Awe he screwed up again. https://t.co/VRmdy2uLLT
@MonicaCrowley You don't know me, but what you said has reinforced my thoughts and those I've given to others within the @realDonaldTrump administration. I did enclose the message you gave on "Why the Swamp Hates Donald Trump" when I sent it to @president45US and @realDonaldTrump
@Thomas1774Paine Oh? Is that why you still owe the IRS $5M?
@MrEdTrain @ALT_DOJ @doj @DOJATJ Might be, but what is his other hand doing? Crossing his fingers in the hopes you think he's lying.  He has an agenda, he wants @POTUS to be impeached. Remember the "Insurance Policy" that Peter Strzok was mentioning in Andy's office [that the fired Andrew McCabe.
@RepDevinNunes Keep pressing Devon, they are still stalling all that they can.
@JohnFromCranber Of her lawyer who is making lots of $$$ because of this case. But think about it she's most likely gone through that $$$ and wants more, so she is running around touting her wares to anyone who will pay her.
@babysgramma But as long as LIBERAL EDUCATORS are with our children we are in peril. They have them longer than we do if you are a working couple. The answer is ti remove liberal educators and have conservative one in their places.
@themasteroffu @JulieDriscoll13 @KatTheHammer1 Might be, but if not he's hung himself out to dry.
@drawandstrike Don't trust your Daughter near Chuck Grassley, his loose lips could sink ships. If it had not been released and he got an early copy, he's trying to better his reputation by naming the person. He also could be held for leaking.
@Vengeance_X2 I'm a Viet-Nam era vet who never got to Viet-Nam, and my Viet-Nam Vet friends said that there were people still in North Viet-Nam when he said they were all out. HE is a liar, he had his records buried by his Dad an Admiral so they could not be seen ever. I've never trusted him.
@festus66 1 Year in jail followed by immediate deportation. No ands, ifs, or buts.
@KatTheHammer1 He's never had anything from the get-go. He's what was called the "Insurance Policy" by Peter Strzok if you can remember that far back. But he has hung himself with the Tweets he's put out. Because when I saw them I took screenshots of them and got a time/date on each [3]. https://t.co/YxxnxTiFAA
@marklevinshow Right on point there Mark. Now here's cannon fodder for you straight from Mueller's Twitter account. Should he say he didn't put these out, When I took the screenshot of these 3 tweets they each had a time/date on them. Note what he said: "It's up for me and ...." https://t.co/fUfjhW7yH7
@JudgeJeanine I have something for you to ponder especially since he's admitted it. I'm smart enough to take screenshots it case that he delete his Tweet saying that he had not done it. Well each shot has a date / time he posted it in them, so he's screwed. Good luck my and GBU., https://t.co/h7Qv3gyLE7
@Thomas1774Paine Too bad, so sad, Maxine. Why do you do something good for this Country, RESIGN!!! It would be one of the best things you could do., short of being caught in your fraud you've been doing for years.
@SenatorCardin You call him a hero, As a Viet-Nam era Vet and listening to my friends who were there when he was, I call him a liar for those he left in N.Viet-Nam. Saying everyone had been released, which was not true. Oh, and what about him having his Adm. Dad bury his records.
@BarbaraAnnFlee2 As was Obama for what he did to this country. Tried to make our military smaller, His medical masterpiece is falling apart costs are rising for the people. He has given money to Iran supposedly for prisoners, which we have never ever done. He's made us laughingstocks in the world
@RedNationRising What "right" do they think they can stand on since it was an Obama Administration and he's no longer in place. There's a new sheriff in town and they will have to deal with him. Like it or not.

The hater of the United States and everything we stand for.
@Thomas1774Paine I want you to look at the attached Read the 4th one from the top and then, let it sink in very carefully. This is what Obama was doing to this country, you can yell and scream till you are blue in the face he destroyed healthcare. https://t.co/vDLw0YWCAM
@Thomas1774Paine But they never quit, with Russia giving them the Uranium that they got in the Uranium One deal this could bite them just where they don't want it to happen. You can fool some people some of the time, most of the people most of the time. but not all of the people all of the time.
@Thomas1774Paine Devin is a smart guy, and he's sharp as a tack. On the other hand, if Gowdy tries that little stunt, he just might get his head handed to him on a platter. Gowdy still trusts Mueller blindly and that will come back and bite him in the pitui.
@RedNationRising Considering where she's from (CA) and who she was backing, it might show you a lack of good moral fortitude. She backed Bernie Sanders, does that tell you anything? https://t.co/2yVzAFCNNi
@RedNationRising Have you gotten a peek at his in-laws because of whom his daughter married? It just might give you a reason to know why he didn't leave the table.	That being said he doesn't have any right to speak to other leaders for this country. He's not working for us. JAIL HIM.

@CBCNews  If Johanna is going to put out the USGS info it would have been good had she said https://t.co/gIkqKp5uuN to get to the direct website.
@LadyRedStorm Mr. Sammon ought to be ashamed of himself letting his politics get involved with the news. His actions are UNFORGIVABLE, his bias against any candidate has NO PLACE in the @FoxNews. Your reporters ought to have been able to put out correct info without his shafting them.
@EdmundHulton If you wondered what I taught, it was DOS Basic. He asked me to teach  Basic. Read the first chapter, highlight something that you don't know. Well his wife called me 2 days later said he was mad at me, he aced the final test. Said he now understood why I had him study that way.
@EdmundHulton You've heard of book smart, she wasn't street smart. I'm both. I've taught professors things that they didn't know, but I also treated them like they would their students. Underline what you don't know, re-read using a different color pencil again, now again, and again. You learn
@GrizzleMeister Socialism is one step from Communism, and that is where Bernie Sanders was leading his followers. They should have had a class in CIVICS and it is one of the best things to allow those who still have a brain and use it to see whats wrong with his surmise. The rest need to think.
@MSNBC Micromanaging from afar rather than in the country. Doing the managing away from the country means you don't have anything to do with the people on the ground [no flesh with the guys there]. This micromanaging might be good for companies but not the TROOPS.
@EdmundHulton She might suck the fickle finger of fate. She didn't take good sound ideas, especially from Bill. So she lost because she's headstrong and memory weak. Didn't even think about the areas that were hurting, and she lost those areas. Totally STUPID in why she lost. She's not honest.
@thebradfordfile @KamVTV @ChristieC733 @RealEagleWings @kwilli1046 @RealMattCouch @LeahR77 @ClintonMSix141 Knucklehead, a war won't end well for anyone. What you have to do is to learn from what was done wrong. They want only one thing and it looks like Viet-Nam. Had the war gone into the North back in the '50s, it might have been different Congress then were pansies, as they are now.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Then you had better start in the HEAD-SHED of the FBI as well. ROSENSTEIN doesn't like @POTUS at all and Mueller is the "Insurance Policy" Peter Strzok was talking about. Rosenstein appointed Mueller and he had to among those in Andy's office. Think about it, it makes sense now.
@MikePenceVP Mueller has no intention of shutting it down until our sitting @POTUS is no longer in office. He's what Strzok mentioned as the "Insurance Policy". Stop and think about it, his scope was broadened by Rosenstein for just this purpose. Rosenstein is not a friend.
@themouthmatusow Your boys and my 3 girls due note that one of them is a Black bob-tail, her sister a Black w/tail is also the same age 4-years, and then there's the Calico who is 10-years old. https://t.co/nb8AjMoPA3
@RedNationRising he knew it wasn't a real document, but he hated Trump so much that he didn't care what it did to this country. The same crap he pulled as a POW in N. Viet-Nam, then has his Father [Adm. McCain] hide it so deep it won't come out. He forgets there are those of us who remember.
@FoxNews Here's the reason Liberal MSM doesn't like @POTUS, and it is all in one picture. But my thought wasn't in it. Because I went at the LIBERAL EDUCATORS who are indoctrinating our children in the direction of Communism. These people whom we put our trust in and they aren't for us. https://t.co/dgWcvXzSQk
@MADE__USA @TruthFeedNews Why hasn't anyone tried to do George Soros in for SEDITION? He keeps advocating the overthrow of our government, so as far as I'm concerned he's eligible for that charge or more depending on how much you are willing to go after him.
@EdmundHulton But, I'll go a step further with this Saul Alinsky crap. It's the first step towards Communism, and the problem is that YOU the general public doesn't know it, It's a shame, we have allowed our moral compass to sink that low. Educators aren't educating, they indoctrinating them.
@RedNationRising As a trained firearms person, I will dismiss misguided stupidity coming from a LEFT-LEANING person who doesn't know what the 2nd Amendment really says. He just might learn something.

@Thomas1774Paine I'm not a Mormon, and I don't blame them. As a former Scout Master Troop #507, who had 3 boys get the rank of Eagle in less than 1-year apart from each other. It saddens me that they would let their sight drop and destroy the organization. Doing what they are doing has blown it.
@RealJamesWoods Those on the LEFT feel they can do anything and it's fine, well it really isn't. Seems to me that this professor has FOOT IN MOUTH disease. What you haven't heard about it, well open mouth insert foot and close mouth. There you have it in a nutshell or that left-leaning professor
@Chicago1Ray @BarackObama He's got that right, but the entire DemocRAT Party should have known something was amiss when he could not produce a REAL birth certificate. Getting a fake from Hawaii didn't help his cause. But the real problem with the fraud he committed was against the American people.
@Globird3 @SenFeinstein @realDonaldTrump Yup, very. And dear ole Obama is lamenting his Iran deal falling apart as well. If Obama had cared half as much for this country, we wouldn't have lost our place as a world leader. But he was giving that away just like the Billions of Taxpayer $$$ he gave Iran.
@BarackObama Well had you not been interested in destroying the US, you might have done some good. But no you didn't give a flying fig about this country, except to destroy everything we stood for in the world. Now  you are almost sounding like you care, but I don't believe you for one second
@Lincoln_Police Oh, and you couldn't do this earlier. After all, you must have known about it for a long time.
@andersonDrLJA I thought that from the beginning, anytime Obama shuttles off billions of US Tax $$$ to them it's a ROTTEN DEAL.
@Thomas1774Paine "You can fool some of the people some of the time, some of the people all of the time, but not all of the people all of the time.."  P.T. Barnum. She's a fool trying to fool the voters.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Nor is @POTUS or his lawyers. This crap has gone far afield from what Rosenstein had laid out to "We the People" so he's got to be reigned in. If Mr.Mueller isn't careful they will figure out he's knee deep in the Uranium One scandal as well., Oh, Rachel you forgot that, right.
@Thomas1774Paine Neil, when was the last time you did your job and backchecked your information. Had you done so, you'd have seen the glaring error. But as it is, you don't backcheck anything. When you ASSUME [thats making an ASS out of U and ME], you are right even when you are grossly wrong.
@Writer614 @tedlieu @EPAScottPruitt There's your problem, you are a liberal wanting the DemocRATS to do everything for you. And the problem with the DemocRATS is they want socialized everything. Making you dependent on the government to do everything for you. Socialism is one step from Communism.
@Frank0Tweet @whitalexisc @char_watt @wfaa Well then try this it just might fit the bill better. https://t.co/Wlxbhb9MUP
@Frank0Tweet @char_watt @whitalexisc @wfaa A foodie group I happen to be a member of Epicurious.

But you might like this better. https://t.co/bqb35UOR5P
@Frank0Tweet @char_watt @whitalexisc @wfaa I have an easy question for you. Have you ever heard of gallbladder dumping syndrome? It's when anything with grease or fat doesn't digest. It goes straight through you, and you lose all of the food inside your stomach. My gallbladder was removed in June of '75 so I'm aware of it
@FoxNews @SenJohnMcCain Mr. Warner doesn't know John McCain the way my Viet-Nam Vet friends know him. He lied about people being left in North Viet-Nam, and for that, he'll never be forgiven.
@char_watt @whitalexisc @Frank0Tweet @wfaa Yup, a non-meat product.
@RoseHasMoreFun @CaroleAlways45 @RealSugarLily @RuthieRedSox @GrizzleMeister @RoaroftheLion8 @VFL2013 @KatTheHammer1 @RealMarLovesUSA @MazurikL @Maggieb1B Looks an awful lot like Obama with a fake mustache on his face. With all luck, he'll be picked up by ICE as a foreign national posing as the 44th President of the US.
@RedNationRising The NY Gov. said he was going to ask for his resignation.
@RedNationRising Sounds like California and Gov. Brown's crap. He also needs to see the inside of a prison cell. Along with all of the legislators who voted to allow this travesty.
@Thomas1774Paine He one to go after @realDonaldTrump aides, when he's guilty of physical abuse of women. His case should fall apart against the people Mueller wanted to get. Goes to show you that Mueller is a DIRTY COP. He also needs to go to jail, NOW.
@jhorak101 Couldn't happen to a better person, wonder how he's going to like prison.
@realDonaldTrump Deal with them BUT REMOVE  Strzok's "Insurance Policy" Rod Rosenstein who lied about the scope of the Special Council's probe. Especially after he gave Mueller an open-ended warrant.
@MasonBilly87 He can move to England if he feels he's safer there. Just remember the Lord Mayor of London had 4 shootings in a gun free city. So much for a GUN FREE CITY. Seems they flunked the premise.
@OCSOALERTS @DestinLog @nwfdailynews If you don't they can bring a plane down possibly killing the occupants.
@Writer614 @tedlieu @EPAScottPruitt Awe, I'm certainly you haven't been listening and watching the news, She's broken 5 Federal Laws trying to hide her donations. But she wasn't thinking when she admitted doing it. My thought is that no one is above the law and shouldn't be rewarded for breaking it.
@andersonDrLJA Finally, Comey was in charge of the WhiteWater crap, then got involved with her email scandal as well. Don't tell me it's a coincidence that's BS. He has purposely misled as many as he could covering his tracks as much as he could. But fat yap is now getting himself in trouble.
@wonderbitchin @wfaa I don't see her in prison yet, so my energy isn't wasted. Problem is that too many people want to forget her past indiscretions like Uranium One, which sold 20% of our uranium to Russia. She says she didn't have anything to do with it, that's BS. She had to sign the document.
@RobertMueIIer My thoughts on John McCain are a whole lot different from yours Mr. Mueller, we didn't leave personnel behind. He did when he lied about others being in North Viet-Nam upon his release from the "Hanoi Hilton". I don't trust him any further than I could lift and throw him.
@Thomas1774Paine What's to keep him from back billing the Mueller probe for expenses to keep his family safe thanks in part to Mueller's inept attempt to destroy @realDonaldTrump?
@realDonaldTrump Want it to QUIT, remove Peter Strzok's "Insurance Policy" Rod Rosenstein who was in the meeting in "Andy's Office". Now remember Rosenstein said why Comey should be fired, but then put Comey's buddy Mueller in place.	I read between the lines and can see a FRAUD being done.
@realDonaldTrump Peter Strzok's "Insurance Policy" Rod Rosenstein is going after your Administration. After having given the scope of the probe, he widened it several months later. And you seem to think he's working for you, NOT!
@tedlieu Rod Rosenstein is Peter Strzok's "Insurance Policy" against @POTUS. He gave the scope of th eprobe, but widened it several months later off of Russia. Just think of th emeeting in "Andy's Office" and there it is. I'm not as dumb as you are to think this is legitimate. https://t.co/W4z7n5Fvw7
@RepDevinNunes Rod Rosenstein is the INSURANCE POLICY against @POTUS. He said what the scope of the probe was and then enlarged it several months later, in an effort to bring the sitting @President45US down. Think, he's not working for you, but against you. Time for him to go.
@realDonaldTrump Rod Rosenstein is the INSURANCE POLICY against @POTUS. He said what the scope of the probe was and then enlarged it several months later, in an effort to bring the sitting @President45US down. Think about it, he's not working for you, but against you. Time for him to go.
@Truthseeker126 @YahooNews The only way the DemocRATS can win the mid-terms is if the RepublICANS forget to vote and become couch potatoes. Republicans sitting on their laurels is how you elect Democrats, also make sure the voters are really legal voters, not illegals. Those are whom the Democrats want.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump While you might out-rank me, I did serve for 28 years, retired CWO3, to your 4-years active service, and I have you by 25-years. Just because you are a lawyer, doesn't make you any better than anyone else on the street.
@whitalexisc @wfaa Too Far, Nope! https://t.co/rftuYwoft4
@realDonaldTrump Have a thought. Rod Rosenstein is the "Insurance Policy" against Trump. He said one thing, only to allow the scope of the Special Councils probe to broaden exponentially. You are being gotten from all angles, not inclusive with the "Russia Probe". They are ratcheting up the ante.
@Thomas1774Paine Nunes is perfectly within his right to charge Kerry since he's not the Secretary of State under the Trump Administration. Some would call it treason or sedition as well. I'm firmly thinking that he has more irons in the fire then the US, his Daughter, and Son-in-Law.
@SMBlue63 @wfaa How about a suggestion be done for your White House Press corps are told to read the following notice and sign that you have read it. "If you get out of line once, you'll be escorted out of the room, immediately. Your company will have to re-apply to be allowed back in." GOTCHA.
@John_KissMyBot Well think about it, the names wrong ... C(linton)N(ews)N(etwork) and that explains it quite well.
@wonderbitchin @wfaa @POTUS Shall I make you feel like you are really young? Roosevelt was President when I was born 12-days VJ Day, and yes I did not say VE Day.
@tedlieu @EPAScottPruitt Does that include you allowing Rosie O'Donnell to give more than an individual is allowed to give? Do you think the FEC should enforce the Law on campaign contributions?  As a DemocRAT your party has been caught by her own confession.
@wonderbitchin @wfaa I haven't seen her go to JAIL for the Federal Crimes she's committed, and until then, I will continue. She and the DNC are in that "Dossier" and yet it was used to try to take down a sitting @POTUS.
@wonderbitchin @wfaa No, I took it from dumb and dumber. I'm not a Clinton fan after she pulled that crap in Benghazi. She knew it was not safe for any member to be in the city. But she was so IGNORANT and STUPID which allowed our Ambassador to be killed. Then she lies about what had happened.
@WiredSources Well, John Tester has proved one thing that the DemocRATS know how to do very well. Obstruction blocking and lying about Ronny Jackson to get him to drop out of the VA Administration.
@GovMikeHuckabee Not only fired, but JAILED, along with all who are helping him. 	Weissmann, Comey, Holder, Clapper, Clinton (both), Obama, Rosenstein, Strzok, Page, et-al. To remove leaks cut the security clearances for anyone who isn't currently actively working now.
@r98121261 I sent this to @RobertMueller	Seems that the entire country is tired of your shenanigans. Your original Special Council warrant was to find Russian interference in the 2016 election by the Trump campaign. You have not found anything of the kind, so be honest and SHUT IT DOWN.
@TomFitton  You need to remove the security clearances of CLAPPER, COMEY, CLINTON (both), HOLDER, LYNCH, OBAMA, and ALL THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACTIVELY WORKING IN GOVERNMENT NOW. They are working against you, not for you. Rod Rosenstein is what is called the "Insurance Policy".
@JudgeJeanine You need to remove the security clearances of CLAPPER, COMEY, CLINTON (both), HOLDER, LYNCH, OBAMA, and ALL THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACTIVELY WORKING IN GOVERNMENT NOW. They are working against you, not for you. Rod Rosenstein this is called "Insurance Policy".
@JKSuicideWatch Next you need to remove the security clearances of CLAPPER, COMEY, CLINTON (both), HOLDER, LYNCH, OBAMA, and for that matter ALL THOSE WHO ARE NOT ACTIVELY WORKING IN GOVERNMENT NOW. They are working against you, not for you. Look above, your leaks are those named
@JenNongel If that is so, then it's high time to put this criminal behind bars and let him try and weasel his way out. Not only did he botch the email scandal but he was also in charge of the Whitewater crap as well. Oops, not everyone was supposed to connect the dots right James.
@RealJamesWoods She'd be pissed if the FEC did throw the book at her and her ilk, but it would serve her right. But instead of stopping on one person go after E1 who did the same thing. The Law was made for people to follow it, this isn't a two-tier playing field as she would like to think.
@LannyDavis As a former Clinton lawyer, I'd expect that from you. You can't stand the fact that @POTUS won the election. You also don't understand that most of us who voted for Trump didn't trust her from the get-go. She's a proverbial liar and sold our Uranium to Russia.
@EdmundHulton Couch potatoes elect more DemocRATS than you can count. When we are lethargic and don't keep our representatives in office, then we allow the LEFT to take over and there go the gains we have gotten.
@kwilli1046 No kidding, where were you when they were mentioning Saul Alinsky as being one of his most liked mentors? He's a Marxist/Leninist follower, but also not really a citizen of the US, born in Kenya. His brother showed out his real birth certificate,
@1GigiSims @JudgeJeanine But Rosenstein turned around and gave Meuller and open-ended Warrant. Meaning they could go after anything that they wanted to go after. This is an abuse of the ASST AG's authority and @jeffsessions, but he's gutless afraid to stop @Rod_Rosenstein in his tracks Needs to be fired.
@JudgeJeanine @POTUS needs to listen to this and relisten if he's not totally on the same page. The spineless AG Sessions brought this onto him and he's been sitting back twilling his thumbs watching @donald_potus squirm. Time for some real removals, @jeffsessions, and @Rod_Rosenstein 1st.
@Shawtypepelina Well she can go straight to JAIL FIRST
@realDonaldTrump Please understand this Mueller and his Democrat lawyers are out to depose a sitting @POTUS, They hate your guts and everything you stand for. Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, Mueller, Page, Weissmann, aren't your friends They need to be jailed as fast as possible.
@wfaa Are you sure it wasn't named Hillary? IT has her looks, creepy, crawly, slightly slimy, and certainly not clean nor nice to handle.
@ItayMilner @Uber Seems you needed to call the POLICE immediately and have this IDIOT ARRESTED. He wasn't a Muslim, was he? In any case, he is an IDIOT and UBER NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN. It's a case of discrimination as well.
@EdmundHulton @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept I got that long ago, no one listens. Stupidly trusting Mueller to be honest. Not with the Democrats, he put in place, they all hate @realDonaldTrump. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Sidney Powell believes Special Counsel Robert Mueller is guilty of prosecutorial improprieties.
@Thomas1774Paine For some odd reason, everyone tends to forget that FaceBook is an OVER-BLOWN ADVERTISING AGENCY posing as a social media site. They get their revenue from advertising and the 3rd party vendors get to sell your email address to whomever. THINK PEOPLE.
@becki_stevenson  Muellers twitter account name, that is unless he's deleted it because of this stupidity. That is why I took a screenshot of his post. https://t.co/dCyMyTyxfQ
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Awe gee, say C[linton]N[ews]N[etwork] with authority, after all, they have not gotten over the FACT that Hillary Lost the election, yet.
@becki_stevenson @RepStevenSmith Funny you should say such a thing because he did go to St. Pauls school graduating in '62.
