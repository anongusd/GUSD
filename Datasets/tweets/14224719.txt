Tariffs and trade deals - PM explains the economic benefits for the UK remaining in the EU: https://t.co/EaibJiHjjZ https://t.co/RIourGkqk2
PM: Looking at what experts say, the way evidence points &amp; what makes our people better off, I believe we should remain in a reformed Europe
PM: So that’s what our membership of a reformed Europe offers: certainty.
PM: If we voted to leave many non-tariff barriers would still be in place, returning to the bad old days of endless forms &amp; bureaucracy.
PM: Thirdly, the Single Market enables the EU to strike the most ambitious and comprehensive trade deals with the world.
PM: Secondly the Single Market doesn’t just eliminate tariffs, it eliminates other barriers to trade - what are known as non-tariff barriers
PM The first big advantage of the Single Market is that British businesses can sell to a continent of customers – 500m people – tariff-free.
PM: I know people want to understand more about Europe &amp; the Single Market. Let me take you through 3 big advantages of the Single Market.
PM: There is going to be lots of debate about Europe over the coming months.  But the biggest issue on 23rd June is our economic future.
