@united I explained the problem. A 10+ hour flight overnight standing, with no possibility for sitting/sleep since you allowed a grossly oversized pax to purchase one seat. as a multi-year elite member, formally Platinum, what will @united do to compensate me 4 this miserable experience?
Overnight flight no less. I'm sitting in "Economy Plus", but I don't see any extra legroom and on this aircraft, a 777-300, it should be called economy minus. Staying awake and standing all night is going to ruin the first day of my 4-day trip. Thanks @united
So, @united, I am on UA90, unit #2131, ewr-tlv right now in 22F. I have been on at least 2500 flights of all kinds in my lifetime. This is the worst ever. You allowed 375+ lb guy who is two seats wide to purchase one seat. As a result I've had to stand for the entire 10 hour

@MarcACaputo Interesting how so many replies here are by #Democrats. In any case, @MarcACaputo, nearly all candidate bios has something on his/her personal life and/or family. As a thorough political reporter, can you find out why there's none of that on #FL15 Dem @AndrewLearned's bio?
Sorry to see our friend @RepDennisRoss leave Congress. We're grateful for his friendship and support across the board. On a related note, looking at #FL15 Dem candidate @AndrewLearned bio (https://t.co/w30aKAAEGS), didn't see anything about Andrew's family. What's up with that? https://t.co/wscrtfQWz6
Did y'all hear what #NancyPelosi just said?	"[The Democrats] are the fiscal hawks"!	Also says Republicans want regular working folks pay for tax cuts to the 1%. (Old talking point).	Now having an 85-year old Colombian woman speaking in Spanish, even though she's been here 30 yrs!
No surprise here given that we continue to allow (or in many cases not allow) a disproportionately high number of unskilled and uneducated immigrants from #ThirdWorld and #craphole countries.	REPORT: More than half of immigrants on welfare https://t.co/3poqpUzgV8 via @usatoday

@MarcACaputo How tragic. My heart goes out to Anthony in this time of incredible loss. Although I did not have the pleasure of knowing Jeri, it is heart-warming to see this outpouring of love and support from across the political Spectrum and so many friends near and far. R.I.P. Jeri!

@LovedayM This would be amusing if it were not, which it is not. I suppose @wapo bias leads an anti-Israel activist like you masquerading as a journalist like you to do anything to elevate the #terrorists perspective, regardless of how inappropriate.
