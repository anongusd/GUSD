originally than it is to what a lot of people assumed (and reported) at the time of the SCO statement.
...they would have made that clear when they wrote the story. I'm not even saying the distinction is not a significant one. What I AM saying is that the distinction is subtle, and that the reality--at least as Cohen describes it--is far closer to what Buzzfeed reported...
My point is not that the @BuzzFeedNews story was flawless. I am certain that if @JasonLeopold and @a_cormier_ understood at the time that the "direction" of Cohen to lie had been inferred based on a combination of months of interaction and an elliptical converation with POTUS...
Cohen also goes significantly further than his prepared statement in his oral testimony. In this interaction with @GerryConnolly, he makes clear that he had a specific conversation with the president about his statement to Congress: https://t.co/HIYQwlbw8Y

Word https://t.co/MTSzaNIGPo
Put another way, here is my challenge to readers: Read both the original Buzzfeed story and the Post‚Äôs after-action report. Which one feels truer today?
At a minimum, Cohen is alleging that Buzzfeed got a very big thing right: that Trump behaved in a fashion that Cohen regarded as a direction to lie. That makes, at least on this point, the Buzzfeed story more consistent with the record than the Post‚Äôs after-action gloating.
The Washington Post reported that Mueller‚Äôs statement should be read as a total repudiation of the Buzzfeed story. That appears to be wrong.	https://t.co/i9F157tTHm https://t.co/HW45fUpC1R
This thread seems wrong and obtuse to me. The controversy over the Buzzfeed story was not over whether Trump ‚Äúdirected‚Äù Cohen to lie directly or whether he did so less directly. It was over (a) whether he did so at all and (b) what precisely Cohen told the OSC about it. https://t.co/I26bnPZRxA

RT @IlvesToomas: .@benjaminwittes has given us the aphorism for our times https://t.co/Gd8TBc0nMh
That's all I got.
We may or may not have a fight on our hands to find out what Mueller has concluded. I'm happy for that to be the fight. It means that Mueller has apparently gotten to finish his probe to his satisfaction. That's a huge win. And we should pause a moment to value it.
And if Mueller is ready to tell us he is done, I have not a shred of interest in the investigation's being prolonged a day longer than it needs to.
That said, I trust Bob Mueller. I trust his staff. I trust the FBI personnel who conducted the investigation. And if they are comfortable referring ongoing matters back to DOJ, then I am comfortable with it too.
I confess I am perplexed by how it can be over with so many apparently open threads--a subject I addressed today with @SykesCharlie on @BulwarkOnline podcast: https://t.co/UN9LB460ak
An investigation is not a permanent state of affairs. It is an effort to answer questions.
It is a moment we should all welcome, whether we believe the president friend or fiend, whether we believe that there was "NO COLLUSION!" or whether we believe the president conspired with a foreign power.
It is a moment of accountability.
So it is in no sense a bad thing it Mueller is now finished. It is a moment we have been waiting for for the better part of two years--a moment we had good reason to worry would never come.
Yes, there is a question about whether Barr will allow the transmission, but a precondition for that to happen is that Mueller finishes the investigation and reports his findings.
It means that he is in a position to give his findings to Barr--and through Barr, to the Congress and the public.
It means that to the extent Mueller believes answers are obtainable, he has gotten them.
This is certainly correct. If Mueller were being shut down against his will, he would say something. This clearly reflects his professional judgment, not a nefarious conspiracy by Barr, Whitaker, or anyone else. As such, it is good news. https://t.co/2oM0Goq6t9

That‚Äôs all I got.
And just to be clear: @IChotiner didn‚Äôt do anything wrong here. A lot of people, on first hearing the word, think it‚Äôs a bad attempt at wit. It‚Äôs actually something way more interesting and complicated and upsetting than that.

For those who want more information on #sextortion, here is some of the work we have done on the subject at Brookings and on Lawfare.
trying to talk about, don‚Äôt take away the terms we‚Äôve got. We need them. Really.
The terms we use in this field are all placeholders. Folks like @ma_franks have usefully sought to replace the term #revengeporn with ‚Äúnonconsensual pornography‚Äù‚Äîwhich is a useful umbrella term that can also cover #sextortion. But unless you‚Äôve got a term to cover what we are...
It was almost certainly coined by a grizzled FBI agent or a computer or sex crimes prosecutor reduced to anxious desperation on behalf of some kid or young woman‚Äîor maybe 100 of them.
So no, @IChotiner, not going to apologize for the word #sextortion. It‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got. It usefully describes what is happening out there. And it was not coined by someone one Twitter trying to be cute.
And not having words makes it hard to talk about. It makes it hard to criminalize appropriately (how do you pass laws banning conduct you can‚Äôt easily describe?). And it makes it hard, very hard, to get people to take seriously.
One of the serious problems those of us who have worked on this issue have is that there is no name for this crime. Literally tens of thousands of kids and adults are being forced into making porn. It‚Äôs a kind of slavery. And we have no vocabulary for it.
The word is not meant to be cute or witty. It is meant to describe something. The group of people who work on this issue never use it as anything other than candidly factual.
I love @IChotiner‚Äôs work but this is very very wrong. The word #sextortion arose as a prosecutor/FBI slang for a specific and important reason: because investigators were seeing horrific sexual exploitation cases that had important features in common for which they had no word. https://t.co/ln3fcaipPv
Here‚Äôs a lot of @lawfareblog content on #sextortion, thanks to @qjurecic. https://t.co/s8UG5pTVXj
@Genuflectional See the report linked to above
He‚Äôs right. Most victims of sextortion are not billionaires who own newspapers. They are teenagers. They are not in a position to go public and take the consequences of fighting their oppressors. It‚Äôs really a good thing when someone does this.
And BTW, kudos to @JeffBezos for coming forward on this. The most important part of his article is this passage. https://t.co/BGGg9o5Vnu
https://t.co/zfO4oL6Xox
Maybe now that @JeffBezos has been subject to this unbelievable extortion people will take #sextortion more seriously. Here‚Äôs some material on the subject.

Both Jesus and Satan have responded to this tweet. I find Trump‚Äôs use of the phrase ‚Äúpresidential harassment‚Äù amusing.

@AshaRangappa_ It would be a very powerful statement for someone to say, "I won't debate this president. I have standards."
@AshaRangappa_ There are dignitary costs to debating Trump--even if you win.
@AshaRangappa_ ...that if nominated, I will not debate Trump. And making clear why: I have no respect for the style of rhetoric he engages in, and I won't engage with it. I'll get my message out my own way. And if Republicans want to debate me, they can nominate someone marginally civilized.
@AshaRangappa_ The way to define something as unacceptable is not to accept it. "Debate" presumes a measure of actual discussion between actual people and political movements. To be clear, I'm not suggesting not showing up for a scheduled debate. I'm suggesting making clear now...
@AshaRangappa_ He does that anyway--and he gets that anyway. The problem with debating him is that it acknowledges the legitimacy of his style of presidential rhetoric, argumentation, lies, and bullshit. If we want as a society to make this style unacceptable, we have to treat it as such.
@DafnaLinzer Yup. Wearing it on their sleeves!

@TheKarlWLewis This is a very 18th Century and early 19th Century view of the presidency, one with which I have some sympathy. Our political culture has long since moved on. And in a world in which the federal government is composed of giant bureaucracies, that's probably right.
@TheRaDR @tfreemanLT Yes, that's what I understood you to be saying. The Jerusalem Church persisted, if memory serves, into the 3d Century as quite Jewish. But by then it was a tiny minority segment of what was a growing Gentile religious movement VERY different from Judaism.

In Washington's first two years, he signed the Judiciary Act. In Jefferson's first two years (plus a month or so), he purchased the Louisiana Territory.

That's stronger than the defense we made yesterday in our Lawfare post. I'm curious if others agree with it.

My point is that some lawyers are not worth it, even when free. The president would do A LOT better to use some small part of the wealth of which he so freely and so frequently boasts to pay competent counsel than to have at no cost the sort of counsel as Giuliani provides.

Does anyone offer such a policy? If not, consider it a free suggestion to the industry for a new product a lot of people turn out to need.
Does any insurance provider offer a shutdown insurance policy? It seems to me this could be offered cheaply and, since federal workers are ultimately made whole, with an actual liability limited to the interest on the money used to keep policy holders solvent in shutdown times.

@Susan_Hennessey @S_R_Anders While I do not favor such an assertion of authority and would want Schumer and Pelosi to confront it vigorously, I think that confrontation is more attractive than the current situation.
@Susan_Hennessey My point, with @S_R_Anders, is that I would rather have an emergency assertion (not acceded to by Congress) that can then be confronted both in future legislation and in litigation than to have a protracted standoff that leaves large parts of the government closed.

Yes, such lawyers assert their clients' rights and entitlements aggressively, tenaciously even. But competent counsel is also an address to discuss matters and reach accommodations. Don't underestimate the importance of that when things get really ugly--as they surely will.
If you've listened to @maddow's podcast, "Bagman," consider how much more difficult the negotiation over Agnew's resignation would have been without lawyers like Marty London representing Agnew.
I am actually glad the President is hiring competent counsel. It does not serve the process for Trump, or the presidency, to be as badly represented as it has been. Some of the people mentioned in this story are excellent lawyers. The whole process works better that way. https://t.co/RAD008JO5T

That's all I got.
It's not going to fly.
His argument would have to be: this evidence, about which you know, would be insufficient if you could see it, which you can't because I won't let you. But if I did--which I won't--it would not support Mueller's claim (which you can see) that I did X. So trust me. I'm innocent.
The president would not be able to argue that there was no evidence to support the conclusions. Because he would be sitting on that evidence, whose existence would be very clear to the public.
The result, in other words, would be the release of Mueller's conclusions in a fashion that would be essentially impossible to rebut or address.
Consider that the president's lawyers would be largely unable to discuss the president's conduct or any communications that might be contained in those redactions for fear of waiving the privilege.
So imagine now a Mueller report coming with the conclusions intact, some evidence visible, and presidential communications all redacted. Is that a good deal for the president?
The result of it would not be the squelching of the report. It would be the squelching of *certain information in the report*, but not its conclusions--and not all of the evidence.
It covers only information involving communications between the president and his staff. So let's leave aside the legal defects in the president's theory of executive privilege and assume arguendo that it has legs. And let's think about what it would look like if operationalized.
Even assuming that the executive privilege claims are valid and will be upheld and are sustainable in the face of the political pressure the administration will receive on the subject, and that is a heck of an assumption, executive privilege does not cover conclusions.
Here is the simple reason why it won't work:
This piece by @woodruffbets spins out what the White House lawyers and their allies imagine to be the mechanism by which they will stifle the Mueller findings, assuming they take the form of some kind of report that contains material plausibly covered by executive privilege. https://t.co/BrXzUXFvc2

Assuming the story is accurate, Barr not only expressed his views in 20 pages of unsolicited memo to the @TheJusticeDept, he also shared those views with lawyers for a subject of the investigation in question. I am not a legal ethics expert, but...
And yes, it should raise a very serious recusal question if Barr is actually confirmed.

"Boarder security" is what @Airbnb users need. But I'm not sure a wall is the best way to provide it.
@lucykaplansky Because both Mueller and SDNY are bound by OLC opinions on the subject.
(13) The airplane is landing. Day is breaking. And that's all I got. Good morning! https://t.co/Lf1jyGHRrD
Congress has its own independent duty here, a higher duty, and it should not hide behind an executive branch official in the exercise of it. Put another way, the instinct to make the impeachment question ancillary to the factual output of the criminal investigation is a mistake.
(12) As such, the instinct to defer to Mueller's and the SDNY's findings on the part of congressional investigators is not an admirable one, though it may well be a functionally useful one (since Mueller is more competent and has more tools than any congressional investigation).
This is true for two reasons: (a) because it involves prospective protection of democracy, not retrospective accountability, and (b) because getting Trump out of office is a precondition for his prosecution in any event (See Point (1)).
(11) Order of operations, as in math, is critical here. Former federal prosecutors love to go on TV and talk about Trump in a criminal law context. It is important to remember, however, that the impeachment question is a higher order matter constitutionally than prosecution.
This is not to say I oppose impeachment. It is a tool that Trump's conduct has put on the table, and it must be always available. But like any powerful weapon, one must wield it carefully and expertly.
(10) In other words, it's okay, desireable even, to think strategically, even a little politically. A purely doctrinal approach may lead to bad places. Impeachment is a tool to protect republican government. We should not use it in a fashion that empowers democracy's foes.
Rule of law messaging that helps the man get reelected and continue his war against our rule of law institutions is really not a good trade.
There is moral value in the rule of law message the House might send with an impeachment doomed from the outset. But it has to be balanced against the countervailing factors: martyring the president before his supporters, for example.
(9) Likelihood of successful removal in the Senate is a critical prudential factor in the exercise of that discretion.
Put another way, the House has a great deal of prosecutorial discretion in the exercise of its impeachment powers.
Nadler has said more than once that they would be impeachable if true but that it's less clear whether the offense would be important enough to warrant impeachment--thus drawing an important distinction between the availability of the tool and the prudential wisdom of using it.
(8) This distinction between points (6) and (7) strikes me as very important and the core of Rep. Nadler's answers to questions about whether the Cohen allegations amount to impeachable offenses.
(7) The answer to the second question is not easy at all.
(6) The answer to the first question is easy. Of course he has. Trump's conduct toward the law enforcement apparatus of the country alone would justify his impeachment as a matter of law, in my view.
And second, would it be wise and prudent and desirable for Congress to seek his removal in response to that behavior?
(5) The relevant question is twofold: first, has he behaved in a fashion that a reasonable legislator should regard as unacceptable in a president?
(4) As such, the core of the question before us is not whether the President has committed crimes (though that may become the operative question later on). And it is also not whether he has met some mythical legal standard that triggers impeachment.
It is surely inflected by law. But at the end of the day, the Constitution will support a wide range of understandings of "High Crimes and Misdemeanors."
(3) The question of what an impeachable offense is and is not, by the very structure of the impeachment clauses, is textually committed by the Constitution to the House of Representatives to decide. This does not mean the question is purely political.
(2) The debate over what is and is not an impeachable offense, when framed in purely legal terms, largely misses the point.
The Justice Department has a stated constitutional view on this subject that all prosecutors working cases involving President Trump will consider binding with respect to their investigations.
(1) It doesn't matter if the President can or cannot theoretically be indicted while he remains in office, because the President will not be indicted while he remains in office.

Ok, James @Comey has moved to quash the House Judiciary Committee‚Äôs subpoena for his deposition. They are now in court. Who will win?
@lisalbarjas1 @LauraWalkerKC can tell you what I‚Äôm quoting.
So there.
Bottom line is this: their stories on Trump Tower Moscow, money flows, and Felix Sater have all been way ahead of the game. People should take their work seriously when it comes out.	And other reporters should be crediting them in retrospect.
In one case that comes to mind, people actively dismissed a money transfer story that was damn interesting. If memory serves, I actually spent some time defending that piece‚Äôs importance at the time.
By the way, they also kicked ass on some other very important stories‚Äîparticularly involving money flows‚Äîand a lot of people kind of ignored them.		(#BabyCannon, I should note, did not.)
It‚Äôs never a good look when journalists fight in public about who should be crediting whom. But @JasonLeopold has a righteous case in this instance. He and @a_cormier_ kicked ass on this story and a bunch of papers are being churlish and stupid. https://t.co/T01eZg2ebO

One wonders not just about the shoes left to drop about Corsi. One wonders it also about Stone. And one wonders it  about the "senior members of the Trump Campaign, including ... then-candidate Donald J. Trump" whom Corsi "understood to be regular contact" with Stone. see para 3
This document describes some very collusiony-looking stuff, and it also describes significant efforts to impede investigation of that underlying activity. One wonders what the activity NOT described here is--the charges Mueller was willing to let go for a plea, for starters.
I will reserve comment on this until we see a document that isn't a draft, but I will say this: If these are the facts to which Mueller was willing to let Corsi plead, there may be some big shoes left to drop when the actual indictment becomes public. https://t.co/JnmHrIm9Rv

That‚Äôs all I got.
Enjoy the video.
And on another serious note, I look forward to the day when he and I go back to discussing matters about which we disagree, like whether lethal autonomous weapons should be preemptively banned in international law.
He‚Äôs also a very serious mind on all sorts of issues, particularly related to foreign policy and democracy. The people of the 7th District of New Jersey chose uncommonly well.
On a serious note, and the video is a true reflection of this, the Hon. Tom @Malinowski is a true pleasure to disagree with. The House of Representatives needs a bit of that.
I very much hope he brings this style of argumentation to the United States Congress.
As part of one of his posts, the Hon. Tom @Malinowski made this video‚Äîas I recall, he was on a very long flight‚Äîin which he resubtitled a Hindi-dubbed edition of Terminator 2.
Matt and Ken and I took the view that we should wait while technology develops and not try to rule out entire classes of weapons.
On the latter issue, he engaged in a spirited debate on @lawfareblog with @mattwaxman1 and @kennethanderson and me on the subject, with the Hon. Tom @Malinowski taking the view that lethal autonomous weapons should be preemptively banned in treaty.
At the time he made this video, the Hon. Tom @Malinowski was the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, where he was one of my favorite sparring partners on a number of issues: Guantanamo, drone strikes, and what the human rights community called ‚Äúkiller robots.‚Äù
A word of explanation is probably in order, so read the following before you watch it.
Who says members of Congress don't have awesome senses of humor? 		This video was made some years back by the Hon. Tom @Malinowski, newly elected representative of New Jersey's 7th district.		It's about lethal autonomous weapons and ... me. https://t.co/9Ll3LlWbC7

(10) One other thing, a point we don't treat in the article: Having the litigation present these issues may well make it harder for Whitaker to do anything dramatic while in office.
(9) That is, it would if Trump were behaving rationally.
(8) As such, it should amp up the pressure on Trump to moot the matter out by nominating a candidate who can win quick Senate confirmation.
(7) The importance of this suit is that it puts all of these issues--and the stakes for the department--squarely on the table.
(6) That means that leaving Whitaker in place is playing with matches in room saturated with lighter fluid.
(5) What's more, as @DavidKris recently argued, there's a small chance that the remedy a court will impose if the appointment is legally defective will be a drastic one. That is, leaving Whitaker in place could have catastrophic consequences. https://t.co/Jo19hSGQpt
(4) When it does, the administration is very vulnerable on the merits. How vulnerable? Nobody knows. There are decent arguments on both sides of the legality question. But there is a significant chance that the courts will ultimately rule against the legality of the appointment.
(3) That said, this is a short-term problem that will not persist. Someone has standing to bring this case, and the longer Whitaker is in office, the more people will have standing. So consider this case a kind of placeholder. The issue WILL get litigated.
(2) Standing for individual members of Congress challenging executive action is a dicey business. The case law on the subject is pretty restrictive, as we outline in the post, so the senators may have a problem getting into court.
(1) This suit is a big deal--not necessarily because as currently postured, the plaintiffs will win, but because a frontal challenge to the legitimacy of the attorney general should put serious pressure on the White House to nominate a respectable one.
Here's a brief thread on the @protctdemocracy suit on behalf of three senators challenging the Whitaker appointment--the subject of the article below, which treats the subject in greater depth. https://t.co/7Co60uTVGW
In case what's missing from your life is a quick and dirty analysis of the new Whitaker Appointments Clause suit, why standing is likely to be a problem, and why the case is really important even if the plaintiffs don't ultimately prevail. https://t.co/6Z4ZJScbLU

That's all I got.
(7) So here's my bottom line: there are limited tea leaves to read, and I don't trust anyone other than Bob Mueller to tell us what's up with the Mueller investigation.	I also trust Mueller to tell us when he's got a problem.
(6) Here's one thing I do think we can infer: It is a very good sign that Mueller is still silent. It likely means he is not having problems with Whitaker--at least not problems that he doesn't think he resolve quietly within the framework of the special counsel regulations.
(5) Nobody outside of DOJ has 360 visibility on the investigation, and very people inside of DOJ have it. Those outsiders who have the most visibility are not reliable sources--and have less insight than they seem to imagine. So just accept that we don't, and shouldn't, know.
...rumors about Don Jr., and apparently dormant (at least in public) investigative arenas that keep reemerging (Peter Smith, George Nader, etc.). 		Here is a good general piece of advice: Take anyone who confidently tells you what's up with Mueller as a blowhard. Nobody knows.
(4) There are a lot of different threads of public reporting out there, some more reliable than others, about where Mueller is right now: active grand jury activity on Roger Stone et all, reports that he is winding down, that he is writing a report...
(3) The President, by all accounts, has been in an unusually bad mood this week. It's an interesting question to what extent answering these questions has contributed to--as @EliStokols put it--his retreat into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment: https://t.co/YX1dozI6K0
Ack. Sorry. It's gone. Will reconstruct. Apologies for the delay.
The rest of this read has been weirdly deleted in a Twitter glitch. Trying to restore.
Notably, the New York Times account on this point is a bit softer: https://t.co/BGZNmFONLr		So look for Mueller's next move in this space. That will be an interesting indicator. https://t.co/fUZ42cV2dj
(2) It is significant that, at least according to this story, they appear to be answering questions only on the Russia side, not the obstruction side. If that's correct, it leaves Mueller with an interesting choice on obstruction: whether to pursue answers further or not. https://t.co/G1bATpNSAu
(1) A show of strength on the part of the White House would be to release the answers publicly. If that happens, and I don't expect it to happen, that would be a real sign that the president's lawyers see no exposure on the Russia side of this investigation.
A few thoughts on this, assuming all the facts in this story are accurate (as they are based on comments from the president's lawyers, that is not a given): https://t.co/WbodAH1da8

It was one of our largest online contributions of the year.
We did not notice at the time from whom the contribution had come, because @gtconway3d was not yet tweeting and none of us recognized his name. @matthew_j_kahn discovered the contribution incidentally only the following year in going over some financial data.
He made a contribution to @lawfareblog. He didn't get in touch. He didn't ask for any kind of recognition. He did it, in fact, by clicking on our online contribution system (which you should also click on :) ) and not telling us anything beyond that. https://t.co/uxgAADBZZd

He is a patriot and a believer in the rule of law. It's actually not that complicated--though I am sure incomprehensible to our president.
If he were going for attention, he could have gotten a lot more of it--and much earlier.
He has passed up countless media opportunities.
Those of us who know @gtconway3d and have worked with him as he has found his public voice all know that seeking attention is exactly what he has NOT done. He has been remarkably restrained given how strongly he feels and has written publicly only about legal matters. https://t.co/om16FzKePM

@judyhampden Don't give @mollyereynolds any ideas... :)
RT @mollyereynolds: Settle in, friends, for my favorite voting integrity tale, courtesy of @benjaminwittes. https://t.co/Ta0mcNLvXD
That's all I got.
So go honor the memory of Benjamin Sittes and vote--once.
Here's a confession: I miss Benjamin Sittes. Every election cycle, @mollyereynolds and I reminisce about the guy. He wasn't the most effective fantom voter. But he was OUR fantom voter. And he really wasn't doing any harm.
(4) It is far, far better for lots of Benjamin Sitteses to remain harmlessly on the rolls a long time than for excessive zeal to purge them to prevent one @benjaminwittes from voting.
(3) The system eventually fixed itself without my pulling any kind of publicity stunt. Culling the rolls of fake voters is legitimate, as long as it is done in good faith and with due care to target actual errors, not real voters.
(2) Nearly of them are harmless. After all, Benjamin Sittes never voted.
(1) Voter registration errors happen. There are a lot of stray registrants out there.
Is there a moral to this story? I think there are a few.
He submitted to his fate and vanished.
Eventually, the DC Board of Elections and Ethics did catch up with him. He received a letter politely explaining that he was suspected of not being a real voter and would be removed from the rolls unless he showed cause why he shouldn't.
@mollyereynolds later went to grad school, became a political scientist, and is now a senior fellow at @BrookingsInst and also writes frequently for @lawfareblog. 		Benjamin Sittes, by contrast, did not progress in life. #failuretolaunch
When I came to Brookings, Benjamin Sittes made a friend: a young research assistant to my colleague Tom Mann named @mollyereynolds became very fond of my voting alter-ego. She used to check on him regularly to make sure he was still on the rolls.
I checked with a lawyer friend before doing it. "It's a felony, Ben," I was told, "one of a type they really will prosecute." Benjamin Sittes remained unexposed.
"I voted twice today."
One year--I believe it was 2004--I decided the time has come to out his voter fraud scheme. I hatched a plan to vote, get in line at my polling station again, present Mr. Sittes's card, receive a second ballot, spoil it, and then write an oped with the following lede:
Every election cycle, he would receive a voter registration card at my house. I reported him serially to the DC government. He remained on the rolls.
Benjamin Sittes shared my address, my date of birth, and--save for one letter--the spelling of my name.
And it didn't work. 	Benjamin Wittes remained a Democrat.	And a new voter was born: registered independent Benjamin Sittes.
It is not rational in DC to be registered as anything other than a Democrat, because most elections are decided in the Democratic primary. But it was a symbolic act of civic faith with the role I was playing.
It took me a while to change my registration--maybe a few years. As I recall, I eventually did it under the DC motor voter law one day when I went to renew my driver's license.
In the fall of 1997, I went to work for the @washingtonpost editorial page, which then had the slogan, "An Independent Newspaper." Some time after beginning my work as an editorial writer there, I decided to be a registered independent in keeping with the spirit of the masthead.

@shallit43 @SykesCharlie @SykesCharlie is not Verdi. And the Daily Standard is not Aida, Otello, or Falstaff. But it is possible for people to gain knowledge and wisdom with age and experience.	I hope I have.
@shallit43 @SykesCharlie Also there is a deep methodological flaw in your analysis, which proceeds logically as follows:	I read A and thought it wanting.	B is by the same author as A.	I thus expect to find B wanting.	I listened to lot of early Verdi and found it wanting.	Late Verdi is transcendent.
@shallit43 @SykesCharlie I don't know the piece of work you're describing and thus have no idea how I would regard it. I have written many things that haven't aged well. So I very much doubt it would change my view that @SykesCharlie's current podcast is exemplary in a number of important respects.

(10) Because in the end, one way or another in a democracy, the people get what they want. If we vote for a party that wants what is currently happening in our politics, we will get it--because we will deserve it.
(9) It is much more important than the Mueller investigation.
(8) Punishing the Republican Party for several election cycles up and down the ballot in a fashion that will reverberate for decades is the single most important thing to do to protect democracy.
(7) In a two-party system, the only remedy when one party is functioning as a threat to the rule of law is to vote for the other party.
(6) A party organized to support him and which has no internal mechanisms available to control his demagoguery is thus also a threat to the rule of law.		Hence, the Republican Party as currently constituted is a threat to the rule of law.
(5) Trump is a threat to the rule of law.
(4) All of the internal party mechanisms to manage his demagoguery have failed.
(3) That party has not ousted him or controlled him. It is, in fact, organized chiefly to support him.
(2) Trump is the leader of one of our two parties.
(1) We live in a two-party system.

@jpodhoretz Show your work here. By the standard you just laid out on @Morning_Joe, his accusers would bear the burden of proof and they would not have met it to a known standard of evidence. Why should this person not be confirmed?
@marty_lederman @jpodhoretz @Morning_Joe So I thought it would be useful to imagine a situation radically different from the one we face that would elucidate the rather obvious point that the nominee actually does carry the burden here. So I changed all the facts.
@marty_lederman Well, @jpodhoretz took the position on @Morning_Joe just now that it was outrageous of me to assign the burden of persuasion to Brett. And he (wrongly) denied that I was making a descriptive, as well as normative, claim that Brett does‚Äîin fact‚Äîbear the burden.

FYI @EWErickson
It is a reality the Senate has made that clear 1000 times in 1000 ways. The Senate‚Äôs conduct in this area is wholly untouched by principle. That is why I addressed my piece not to what the Senate ‚Äúshould‚Äù do but to what advice I would give to Kavanaugh.
Here‚Äôs the simple truth: All nominees bear the burden of persuasion. They bear the burden of persuading the committee to consider them at all. They bear the burden of addressing unfair situations to the Senate‚Äôs satisfaction. That‚Äôs a reality.
...insist for another that the standards within a hearing that you reserve the right not to hold at all comport with the norms of a judicial proceeding.
If the Senate wants to establish norms and expectations about what it will and won‚Äôt do in nominations, I‚Äôm all for that. I wrote a whole book arguing for it, in fact. But you can‚Äôt refuse to hold a hearing for one highly qualified nominee and then...
Good thread. 		Due process is clearly the wrong concept here. If it were, presumably Merrick Garland was entitled to due process too‚Äîhaving a hearing in the first place. There is no evidence that the Senate believes a nominee is entitled to anything as a matter of right. https://t.co/cIPcdafuyv
Word https://t.co/BysaDQuwrU
But the Times reporters here are not villains. They are dealing with real material and they are doing their best to report it accurately.	So chill, folks. Just chill.
I don‚Äôt know which interpretation is right. And neither do you. Both accounts undoubtedly serve the interests of what are effectively rival camps here. As more facts emerge, we may develop a better sense of which group is closer to the truth.
DOJ then pushed back, offering a source who does not deny the facts but has a different interpretation, one that doesn‚Äôt look so bad for Rod.
Along the way, the facts revealed might make Rod look bad.
So here‚Äôs what I think happened: someone decided that he or she could help McCabe create a record of heroic post-Comey-firing opposition to Trump that would make any effort to prosecute him look like political retaliation.
McCabe is facing an investigation and possible prosecution for false statements on unrelated matters. Rosenstein is also partly responsible for his firing. Many people at DOJ and the FBI don‚Äôt like Rosenstein‚Äîfor a lot of reasons.
The key thing to understand here is that this is a fight between McCabe and Rosenstein.
It‚Äôs also possible that the source in the room remembers the comment now in a fashion convenient to Rod Rosenstein‚Äôs current needs. I‚Äôm sympathetic. Really am. But there‚Äôs no need to attack reporters for doing their jobs.
Still another thing: this was a crazy time. Really crazy. I can‚Äôt fathom why McCabe would have memorialized a sarcastic joke‚Äîunless he misunderstood it as serious. That‚Äôs certainly possible.
Another thing: I don‚Äôt know how the Times got access to this material but I don‚Äôt believe it was White House leaks. I am unaware of the White House having access to the McCabe material.
I don‚Äôt know the truth of #sarcasmgate and I really don‚Äôt want to see Rod Rosenstein get fired. But both @nytmike and @adamgoldmanNYT are excellent reporters. They are under a lot of fire today. Reminder that their job is not to tell you what you want to hear. That‚Äôs all I got.

@nycsouthpaw ...on my own behalf. But I warn you  the search is very likely unavailing both because the records almost certainly no longer exist and because our substantive communications took place largely by phone.
@nycsouthpaw I can‚Äôt imagine the records still exist. In any event, the Post would‚ÄîI am sure‚Äînever release confidential exchanges between one of its editorial writers and a source without the source‚Äôs explicit consent. I have no objection to any such communications becoming public...
@LemonSlayerUS Touch√©. It‚Äôs been a trying morning. :)
@nycsouthpaw I have a guess as to what happened but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs right. And it‚Äôs mostly a reconstruction based on my memory of how things worked‚Äîas well as the text of the one extant email. I would assign it an 80 to 85 percent chance of accuracy.
@nycsouthpaw No, I don‚Äôt believe I took my Post emails with me when I left, and I certainly don‚Äôt still have them now. More importantly, any significant interaction would almost certainly have happened by phone.
@nycsouthpaw But there a few possibilities, all consistent with how we would have interacted. And I think they would genuinely suggest different realities.
@nycsouthpaw Third, to me the interesting question is what came before this email‚Äîand what, if anything, came after it. I don‚Äôt honestly remember. This was 15 years ago and a completely routine interaction between me and the counsel‚Äôs office.
@nycsouthpaw ... to the extent that what he was trying to convey was simply that he wasn‚Äôt the point person on Pryor.
@nycsouthpaw Second, I do think there would be zero reason for him to remember that interaction when he was asked about his involvement in the Pryor matter months or years later. And there might be no reason reason either to recall other incidental involvements...
@nycsouthpaw First, to be clear, I am not saying he was not involved. I have no knowledge of the degree of his involvement.

@kgiff1809 @DavidLat He is what he is. My point is a very limited one: he‚Äôs not a bad person and he‚Äôs not a liar.

@kgiff1809 @DavidLat On your point (3), at the time of his nomination to the DC Circuit, I actually considered his political operative history a pretty significant issue. At this point, however, he has been on the bench 12 years. That‚Äôs the relevant record to me.
@kgiff1809 On your point (2), see @DavidLat‚Äôs thread on the subject. It speaks for me pretty completely.
@kgiff1809 (2) I agree with his reticence to comment on political issues, including ones on which I very much expect others to speak out. He is among other things a sitting federal judge.
@kgiff1809 I do not speak for the guy. I haven‚Äôt defended a lot of things, including a lot of his views. But since you ask:	(1) I have no desire to defend his comments about Trump and vetting, which I thought were a low moment for him that warranted the criticism he received.

@twistopherrobin @LauraWalkerKC @nycsouthpaw @lrozen See my responses. If I stand convicted in this Twitter trial, I happily await my sentence. ;)
@nycsouthpaw So it says very little about how involved he was in Pryor (a matter on which I know nothing, btw) to observe that he interacted with me on the subject.
@nycsouthpaw We were also doing A LOT of legal issues in the post-9/11 space. It was easier to have one point of contact between the editorial page and the counsel‚Äôs office. Brett, I assume informally, played that role.
@nycsouthpaw There were two reasons for this. The first was that Brett and I had a preexisting relationship, so it was easier. The second was that the volume of issues was IMMENSE. We were writing about MANY judicial nominees.
@nycsouthpaw Even if I had known who was working a matter within the counsel‚Äôs office, I would have gone through Brett and he would have either made the connection or acted as an intermediary. That‚Äôs the way that office and I interacted at the time.
@nycsouthpaw https://t.co/VwTVhBeetI
@nycsouthpaw Your point is incorrect.
@BJS_quire Just FYI, I‚Äôm not a conservative and never have been.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes @tomscocca And if responding to an inquiry from me‚Äîand a few other minor involvements‚Äîmakes his testimony false, well, each senator will judge that, I suppose. My own judgment is closer to that of @DavidLat.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes @tomscocca So yes, as I have disclosed from the beginning, we have a long professional relationship. Very long.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes @tomscocca Importantly, the fact that the White House used Brett to reach out to me on this is not evidence that Brett was managing the Pryor nomination. Brett was my contact at the counsel‚Äôs office. All of my inquiries on all subjects went through him.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes @tomscocca When I read those, I wrote to Brett and said that I would, in fact, be writing something imminently‚Äîand that if he had anything ‚Äúexculpatory‚Äù (ie that would mitigate what I was going to write), he should send it to me.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes So yes, as @tomscocca pointed out, sometimes ‚Äúamazing‚Äù can mean of a character that amazes. As I recall the events in this case 15 years later, I was disinclined to write something early about Pryor‚Äîuntil I saw his speeches.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes The full text of the editorial isn‚Äôt online. Here‚Äôs the lede though:  https://t.co/q8cm1CFM7B
@mattyglesias @tcwittes Or even the next few sentences of the email in question.
@mattyglesias @tcwittes No need. Just read the editorial that followed the email exchange you are misreading.
(I meant with the entire Justice Department watching)
That‚Äôs all I got.
I know this isn‚Äôt going to make me popular, but WTF, I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs the truth as *I* see it.
Another good reason to oppose him is not that he‚Äôs a liar. He‚Äôs not. Full stop. There‚Äôs no need to demonize one‚Äôs opponents. And there‚Äôs no need to gin up a ‚Äúperjury‚Äù issue here.
There are a lot of good reasons for liberals to oppose Kavanaugh. He‚Äôs a genuine conservative who will do a lot of the things liberals are afraid of. One of the reasons to oppose him is not that he‚Äôs some kind of terrible person. He‚Äôs a thoroughly decent and honorable person.
...he was working those issues in the White House. As reporters keep pointing out to me, some of the emails among those released by the committee are to and from me (none very interesting, by the way).
I have known Kavanaugh for a very long time, since the mid/late-1990s. We interacted over a bunch of the issues at issue in these lines of questioning. I wrote a book about Starr, for example, and I covered both post-9/11 antiterrorism issues and judicial confirmations while...
There‚Äôs a far simpler explanation for Kavanaugh‚Äôs behavior: He believed his testimony in 2004 and 2006 to be truthful, and he told the truth as he understood it this time too‚Äîand that any errors are minor and inadvertent and not the result of trying to cover something up.
With the entire Justice Department?		Really?
What could possibly possess a good lawyer to double down on prior lies (if lies they were) and reiterate them now, when the entire world is watching on national television? Do you really think he would do that?
There was nothing to prevent him from saying something like, ‚ÄúSenator, I appear to have misspoke in my prior appearance on this point. With the benefit of these documents it looks like I played a more substantial role in the Pickering nomination than I remembered back then.‚Äù
Any statute of limitations for that prior testimony is long passed. In other words, he could face no possible exposure for his prior statements‚Äîexcept if he doubled down on them in new testimony.
Even if you hate the guy, take a deep breath and consider: Kavanaugh is a very good lawyer. Very good. He was being asked about matters he knew were going to come up. He was being asked about prior testimony that took place more than a decade ago. He had time to prepare.
These three threads from @DavidLat are very strong and worth your time. I would like to add a couple of points that apply to all three lines of questioning: Do you really think Brett Kavanaugh is so dumb‚Äîso mind-numbingly, idiotically stupid‚Äîas to lie under oath in this setting? https://t.co/CyNLbhttpN

Moss is a very smart and fair judge and a thoroughly decent man. I would not be surprised, however, if Papadopoulos pays a price today for the antics of the last few months. Look for how much time he gets relative to Alex Van Der Zwaan.

@marty_lederman @EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @lawfareblog You did not. You understood it correctly as reflecting that I judge. But I also believe in publishing a broad diversity of views. And my editorial judgment of what exchanges and ideas Lawfare readers might benefit from are not coextensive with my moral instincts.
@marty_lederman @EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump Actually, no! If @LindseyGrahamSC wants to write an explanation of his current views and posture for @lawfareblog or to come on the podcast and discuss his current views with me, he is MOST welcome. Indeed, I think it would be a fruitful engagement.
Actually, it's note quite all I got. Here's a clarification thread: https://t.co/XOmBPDqXBu
@marty_lederman @EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump As my clarification thread suggests, apparently a bunch of people thought I was talking about average Trump voters and/or suggesting some kind of blacklist. I can see how someone might think that, though it certainly wasn't what I intended to convey.
@marty_lederman @EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump FYI, @marty_lederman, @EVKontorovich is not the only one who seems to have mistaken my meaning. I have clarified here: https://t.co/XOmBPDqXBu
That's all I got.
Perhaps that's arrogant and overconfident about my own reading of the situation. And maybe it's too judgmental. But it is what I think and how I feel. And if I come to owe Graham or Glenn Greenwald or Tucker Carlson an apology for it, it will be with great relief that I offer it.
Like that minister, I think the current situation is very dangerous, and when I see someone like Graham--who I know knows better because a year ago I was cheering him on as he said all the right things--behaving as he is, I feel a certain urgency about it.
He began by saying, "the thing you [Jews] have to understand about us is that we have a very dire understanding of the human condition‚Äîand that creates urgency for us." I had a lot of sympathy for his presentation then. And I identify with it now in a secular democratic context.
I watched a wonderful debate once between a Baptist minister and an Orthodox rabbi about the propriety of Baptists evangelizing Jews. The minister made a comment I think about often.
I don't apologize for this judgment but it is a decidedly limited judgment than at least some readers I respect seemed to take from what I wrote.
I also wasn't suggesting any kind of blacklist or lustration or anything of the kind‚Äîsimply being candid that my personal understanding of people like Graham has been changed and that I think it will be hard for me to go back to seeing them as I once did.
I took Kasparov to be saying that he would have trouble forgetting Graham's current posture. I was fleshing out my agreement and lumping in the class of politicians and operatives and public intellectuals who have behaved in a fashion that seems to me democratically toxic.
Graham is someone I have long admired (and even worked with) who is now very actively covering for Trump on a number of matters close to my heart. The thread was not meant to be about the average Trump supporter, but about political and to a lesser extent intellectual leadership.
First, the tweet thread was not ever meant to be about millions of my fellow citizens or about the general Trump-supporting voter. I wrote it specifically in response to @Kasparov63's tweet of an article about Lindsey Graham. It was about leadership cadres figures.
I don't back off what I said yesterday but my regard for both Jack and Eugene is such that I assume that if they could misread me so completely, others no doubt did as well. So please indulge me a few words of clarification.
I was surprised this morning to receive on Twitter from @EVKontorovich and on email from @jacklgoldsmith responses to my Twitter thread of yesterday that reflect a real misinterpreting of what I was trying to say. Here's the original thread: https://t.co/mtGYFOfOob

@EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump @Kasparov63 I certainly wasn‚Äôt proposing to keep a list of all of those who weigh things differently from the way I do, though I suppose that the more prominent someone is, the more I tend to treat the person like a political figure. So, for example, I was definitely thinking ...
@EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump @Kasparov63 Ok, now we‚Äôre getting somewhere. What sparked the thread was politicians. I generally think conservative intellectuals have behaved very well, and I honestly was not thinking of them when I wrote the thread‚Äîso intellectuals show up mostly in a positive light.
@EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump @Kasparov63 So here‚Äôs my question: how do you propose I react to those whose conduct in this era makes me doubt their core democratic commitments? All I have said is that I judge and I will remember.
@EVKontorovich @realDonaldTrump So I‚Äôm curious: The precipitating event from my tweets was @Kasparov63‚Äôs reaction to Lindsey Graham‚Äôs recent posture and an article written about it. Sen. Graham is someone I have admired, I have worked with, and whose recent conduct has deeply shocked me.
@EVKontorovich I‚Äôm a little perplexed by this comment. Do you propose not to judge? Not to remember? Do you propose to treat this moment as the stuff of normal political differences? I‚Äôm not proposing a ‚Äúblack book.‚Äù I‚Äôm just saying how I personally regard the matter.

Third, while I have no problem with folks on the left fighting Trump by doing traditional left activism, I do think there is value one leaves on the table in not seeking to build the broadest possible coalition.

@EliotACohen You're very kind--and you were very much on my mind while I wrote it.
That's all I got.
@Kasparov63's tweet boils down for me to the W.S. Gilbert's immortal Lord High Executioner's line, "I've got a little list"; I've got two of them, to be precise.
This is all, as the great @KoriSchake cheerfully puts it when she puts an idea on the table, "just one citizen's opinion." But there it is; that is mine.
I will remember who put something else before the vitality and health of our democracy.
I will never be able to engage these people in the future‚Äîno matter how much I might agree with them‚Äîwithout a deep awareness that they lack what to me are the most important democratic virtues and commitments. Frankly, I will always hold them in at least some contempt.
I will also never forget those on the left who hate the center and the democratic right so much that they prefer to make common cause with the Trumpists than with the impure. I will never forget those of all factions who, when it really mattered, stayed narrow and parochial.
I will never forget the people who stared this moment in the face and made peace with it. I will never forget those who decided to tolerate it because of tax cuts, or judges, or to own the libs.
This brings me to the second half of @Kasparov63's tweet: "those who still support him should never be forgotten or forgiven." I don't mean to sound arch or moralistic. But yes. Speaking personally, I do judge. And my memory will be very long.
I hope it makes me more open to arguments I would otherwise dismiss. I hope it makes me more respectful in disagreement. I hope it creates the possibility of dialogue between people‚Äîand between movements‚Äîthat have regarded one another as hopeless.
I very much hope I will never be able to disagree‚Äîhowever intensely‚Äîwith such people again without a keen understanding that on the most important values, we share a core. And I hope that will cause me to engage with them more respectfully than I might otherwise have done.
I would hope that we would all retain in future disagreements a deep awareness that the people we are disagreeing with are people with whom we shared a foxhole when democratic government itself faced a threat.
Second, there is one important thing that we should all try to retain from the current moment, however‚Äîand I think this is a critically important thing that I hope will survive the current struggle. That is a certain mutual respect and admiration born of common tectonic values.
The #CoalitionOfAllDemocraticForces should not merely accept but actively aspire to a time when we can all go back to disagreeing on the most important issues of the day. This is a recurrent joke between me and @steve_vladeck. But it's also not a joke.
It is not desirable to pretend that, say, @benwikler and @monacharenEPPC have more in common than they do. @DavidAFrench and I speak for very different political currents, and both are different from those that @Yascha_Mounk speaks for.
It is thus not merely probable, but actively desirable that the anti-Trump coalition will break up into its constituent pieces once the current crisis has passed. The country, after all, needs a vibrant democratic right, a vibrant democratic left, and vibrant democratic center.
First, "Those who stand against Trump will move on to many different things when he's gone": Yes. We will. Those who stand against Trump come from left, right, and center. What unites them is anti-authoritarianism and democratic pre-politics, not a specific political program.

@ATSNLG That's a little bit different. Mueller is the shop. His staff represent the special counsel's office, which he embodies. @qjurecic does not represent me. She is not an arm of me. Her byline is her own independent identity.

@alliegoldenpen @qjurecic Correct.
@bodhigrrrl @JZED74 @tcwittes @hannahneprash @hannahneprash and I filmed those videos in the back yard of one of the spookiest #deepstate folk I know. And yes, we left the "sweet" in there as a little Easter Egg.
@bodhigrrrl @JZED74 It actually was not @tcwittes. I believe that is the voice of the great health-care economist, @hannahneprash.
@alliegoldenpen @qjurecic I am saying that it's wrong.
@alliegoldenpen @qjurecic So as I mentioned, I have never been sure how much of this particular effect is gender and how much other things--because the variables are a bit overdetermined. The women I write with tend to be younger and less established than I am. So I'm not accusing anyone of sexism.
@Nickysoul7 @qjurecic @ChuckRossDC What question do you imagine I am dodging? @ChuckRossDC was complimenting me.
@Random_Guy_101_ @qjurecic Quinta's name is first on the byline because her last name comes alphabetically before mine. We generally try to make the bylines alphabetical (there are some exceptions to that) so as to make no comment on relative contribution.
My point is simply this: If you're ignoring @qjurecic's presence on the byline, you're missing half the picture.
I cannot tell how much of it is gender-related and how much of it is the fact that my female coauthors are often less established, younger, and less prominent than I am. Nor am I going to spend my time trying to figure that out. Life is short.
Just to be clear, I don't mean to pick on @ChuckRossDC in particular on this. It's a recurrent thing that happens all the time when writers and commentators‚Äîmale and female alike, liberal and conservative alike‚Äîrefer to my coauthored work these days. It's *remarkably* common. https://t.co/2hHNwMLJOL
When I write on my own, my byline reflects that. When there's a name next to mine, it's there for a reason.
Seriously, people: Stop erasing my female coauthors. Just stop.
How do you know that line is my "sober assessment" and not @qjurecic's sober assessment, @ChuckRossDC? https://t.co/TdtKGZffXP

@DamonLinker That‚Äôs true, although normally, the task of protecting the presidency is thought to include the assertion of executive privilege over presidential communications.

Like a natural disaster or a health crisis‚Äîor death. It‚Äôs a real shock that this common metaphor might occur to more than one person.
Q: So it was a total coincidence that you used a common phrase in an article in roughly the same context as Strzok used it in a text to Page?	A: Yup. Imagine that. 2 people independently suggesting that Donald Trump was the kind of thing you might buy insurance to hedge against

@real_farmacist @gofundme yes, this is real.
For all these reasons, I believe Strzok deserves a defense.
And I don't believe that the costs of running afoul of the President should be career ruin and personal bankruptcy.
I believe the recommendation of OPR for that appears to have been overturned thus warranted more deference than it received.
I believe that Strzok has served this country in a number of different capacities over a long period of time and that this fact deserved more consideration than it appears to have received in the final adjudication of his case.
I don't believe that Strzok's incredibly foolish decision to share those private views with another FBI employee on Bureau hardware amounts to a firing offense.  I still don't fully understand what rule he is supposed to have violated.
I do believe that federal employees have the right to their private views.
That said, I don't believe that individual line agents at federal law enforcement agencies should be the subject of Twitter campaigns by the President of the United States.
I do not approve of or defend what Strzok did, which was monumentally stupid for a very smart guy, and which caused huge problems for the FBI in two separate high profile investigations on which the integrity of the Bureau's work should have been beyond question.

So if anything, @DavidKris is understating the matter when he says this: https://t.co/w2m8GywUw4
More than twenty years later, this actually the first time‚Äîto my knowledge anyway‚Äîthat it has happened.
That is, even scrubbed of ANY evidence, ANY target information, and ANY source information, even scrubbed of any relation to any case, the mere structure and form of a FISA application was to sensitive to disclose.
At the time, the Justice Department was EXTREMELY cooperative with my reporting, as was the court itself. One thing we discussed their producing but which they decided they could not, however, was a mere TEMPLATE for a FISA application.
Back in the mid-1990s, as a young reporter for Legal Times, I wrote a long piece on the FISA Court and process, about which almost nothing substantial had previously been written.
One note on Kris‚Äôs first point, that the disclosure of a FISA application is alone monumental, even if redacted heavily, as this one is:

@rich1 @jon_rauch Legitimacy is a funny concept. It's not a legal concept. For me, the relevant point is that Trump won. He was sworn in. And this country has one president at a time. I don't like that fact, but that's where it begins and ends.
@rich1 @jon_rauch Trump was elected by a majority of the electoral college under the rules of our system. He lawfully exercises the powers of the presidency. Those include judicial nominations.
@rich1 @jon_rauch I know that people will say it does, but it really doesn't.
@rich1 @jon_rauch (3) My point in urging mindless opposition to Republican candidates is that it is imperative to create counter-weights to Trumpism and the GOP is not playing that role right now. This is not an argument that maps easily or well onto judicial confirmations.
@rich1 @jon_rauch Once confirmed, he is on the court for a very long time, but the President cannot instruct him and cannot remove him. So the calculation is VERY different from, say, an attorney general.
@rich1 @jon_rauch A few things: 	(1) I have never questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election. I have questioned the propriety of his conduct.	(2) A judicial nominee is very unlike an executive branch nominee in that a judicial nominee does not work for the President.
@rich1 @jon_rauch When that piece says "nominees," we (at least I) meant nominees for elected political office. I have a 20 years history of writing about judicial nominees. The day I decide to contradict it, I'll do so very explicitly. :)
@rich1 Interesting questions. Thanks for asking: @jon_rauch and I were talking about the political context of elections in that piece, not judicial nominees. I have never argued that we should treat judicial nominees with reflexive, mechanical opposition.
Very grateful to @justingflorence and the folks at @protctdemocracy for representing us in this matter and making this happen.
This morning, at 11:00 am, @S_R_Anders will be breaking a little news on @lawfareblog. It's not a boom, but a very interesting piece that developed out of our FOIA work. If you're interested in the institution of the FBI, you won't want to miss.

It's a wonderful thing that, at long last, an FBI official is speaking out publicly, passionately and clearly on behalf of the institution. 	It's a bit of a shame that official is Peter Strzok.	But what Strzok is now doing raises an important question: Where is everyone else?

@nytmike @PreetBharara @Mimirocah1 @JoyceWhiteVance Also interested for thoughts on this from @bmaz, @RosenzweigP (know knows a little something about special counsel behavior), @joshscampbell, and others in federal law enforcement Twitter. 		Waddaya all think? Should we assume that Mueller needs Trump interview?
Excellent contribution to the #TradeWarEffort https://t.co/wL9ju4WKJa
@nytmike @PreetBharara @Mimirocah1 @JoyceWhiteVance But my instinct is that it may be just as important for Mueller to offer Trump every chance to answer his questions as it is actually to get him on the record.
@nytmike I'm not sure about that. A refusal to sit for an interview would put a premium on the dispositive power of the other evidence, but prosecutors proceed without perfect cooperation all the time. I'd be curious to hear from @PreetBharara, @Mimirocah1, @JoyceWhiteVance on this.
@Paddler_ No clear time frame. My assumption is that if he decides to press the issue (ie, issue the subpoena) he will do so as soon as it's clear that further discussions would not be useful. Given the transparently stonewalling posture of the WH, that would probably be soon.
That's all I got. /13/
... are certain Mueller is prepared to spend the time and energy litigating the matter. /12/
If he does this, he effectively drags the matter out through the remainder of the midterm campaign and then loses all of his negotiating leverage. Time is not on the President's side. So despite the noises they are making now, the President's lawyers will deal once they ... /11/
Seventh, if Mueller really needs the interview, I remain of the belief that he's going to get it. The worst possible outcome for the President is to litigate this question and lose.  /10/
Sixth, if he's writing a report, he can still report other evidence and simply note the questions on which investigators lack information in response to the questions they want to ask Trump. Mueller is no worse off here than he would be if Trump took the Fifth. /9/
Fifth, the key question‚Äîto which we don't know the answer‚Äîis how much Mueller needs the Trump interview. If he doesn't need it, he will likely not spend months on this dance but will simply let Trump win the particularly skirmish. /8/
Fourth, because of the probability‚Äîbut not certainty‚Äîthat Mueller will prevail if he issued a subpoena, the game theory of this next step is kind of elaborate, as I argued in this piece: https://t.co/PZ1IJhlcaN /7/
Third, if Mueller proceeds with a subpoena, he will *probably* prevail, as @steve_vladeck and I argued in this piece. The law favors him, but Trump's legal team has arguments available to them, so it is not a slam dunk: https://t.co/r6tcSjp9Pu /6/
Second, this raises the question of whether Bob Mueller actually cares very much about getting a voluntary interview with President Trump. If he does, we'll see a subpoena relatively soon. If not, he'll proceed without the interview. /5/
Particularly in light of this news nugget about a Kelly interview, the best way to understand this is as simple stonewalling. /4/ https://t.co/6yyWJrER1H
First, they key news here is that there will not be a voluntary interview. Giuliani doesn't quite say that, but if he were negotiating for interview terms, there probably would have been progress by now and he probably wouldn't be signaling no dice. He's spoiling for a fight. /3/

I spent a lot of time on this piece about the Supreme Court's travel ban decision, what the case is really about and what it's really not about. I know a lot of people won't agree with me, but for what it's worth, here are my thoughts. https://t.co/7sE4PXa4u4
@OrinKerr @jonathanmayer @grimmelm @pwnallthethings @CrimeADay Very interesting. And you think a court would see it this way even though there is no service provider (the bank) and no account?
@KimZetter It's not an account. The question, I suppose, is whether it exists at all other than as a metaphorical expression of the private keys themselves. I don't know if there's any law on this, but I think there would be a real question whether it's either "money" or "property."
@jonathanmayer @grimmelm @OrinKerr @pwnallthethings @CrimeADay When you go to the bank, you are making a representation about your identity. When you pass a bad check, that representation is fraudulent. When you use a found bitcoin private key, I'm not sure there's any comparable representation being made.
@SteveBellovin @KimZetter Sorry. I missed the first time. This statute pervasive depends on "intent to defraud."	But again, what is fraudulent about using a private key found on the street? Fraud requires some measure of misrepresentation.
@jonathanmayer @grimmelm @OrinKerr @pwnallthethings @CrimeADay I'm not sure I see it. You haven't misrepresented anything to anyone. You haven't said "this key is mine." You've merely produced the key. I also specifically didn't say the key was stolen but found on the street.
@KimZetter The implication is interesting, if I'm right (and I very well may not be): It is that there is no property right in digital currency. There is just a cybersecurity interest in key protection. And there's a privacy right--protected by the CFAA--in access to your accounts.
@KimZetter Exactly. What's more, there's no "money or property" that gets appropriated as a result of the transaction. There is simply a ledger entry.
@conor64 I'm not sure I get this joke.
@KimZetter See 18 USC 1343, eg	https://t.co/Wzkr03m0Id
@KimZetter I don't think so. Because I'm not sure you have defrauded anyone. To commit a fraud, you have to misrepresent something to someone. What are you misrepresenting here, and to whom? All you are claiming is to know the private key associated with certain public keys on the ledger.
@TKeck44 That only works if there's an account. So I agree with you if you're using a service like Coinbase, which is basically a financial service company that provides you an account. But many people hold their own keys. Then there is no account.
@grimmelm @OrinKerr @pwnallthethings @CrimeADay Not sure it‚Äôs a fraud. You haven‚Äôt represented anything to any person. Whom have you defrauded?
Put another way, does the law in any meaningful sense protect an individual‚Äôs right in property acknowledged only by block chain ledger? My instinct is that the answer is no.
Have you committed any crime? @OrinKerr @pwnallthethings @CrimeADay
You haven‚Äôt accessed any kind of account at all‚Äîassuming the wallet does not involve a @coinbase account or some other such service. So...
You haven‚Äôt actually appropriated any money or tangible property.
Yet I don‚Äôt think you have exceeded authorized access to any computer.
Here‚Äôs a question for CFAA twitter. Imagine you come upon (find on the street) a slip of paper with the private keys to a bitcoin wallet. You then transfer the contents of that wallet to your own wallet. In any conventional sense, you have stolen money.

@tcwittes @pkmacdonald It‚Äôs also not clear to me whether Trump‚Äôs bellicosity played any real role here in persuading the DPRK to do what it did. All I am saying is that objectively, the obtained result was something Obama had not been able to get.
@tcwittes @pkmacdonald Now to be clear, as I said on the podcast, I am NOT saying that Trump deserves credit for obtaining this outcome. Because it‚Äôs very possible the result was obtained only because Kim Jong Un got far enough in missile development that he was ready to deal.

@chriseargle No, that was NOT my point. All senior Nazis are loathsome. Some senior Nazi children are also loathsome. Some are not loathsome but admirable.
@sfmnemonic I agree!
Not everything is about Trump. 		And I don't do Nazi comparisons.
...senior Nazis who are not loathsome but are, in fact, movingly admirable. They made me reflect on this wonderful film I had seen on the subject. So I tweeted the film, along with the observation that it wasn't Burwitz's parentage that made her evil but her choices.
I'm fascinated, and disturbed, by the number of people who seem to think this thread is about Trump and his family. It's not. I tweeted this because Himmler's daughter died. She was a thoroughly loathsome person. And the obituaries of her made me think of the family members of... https://t.co/V2VZVbbeEK
@edgeoforever something like that, yes.
@lepton939 My point is that it‚Äôs not enough to say that her father was Himmler. She made her own choices about who she wanted to be. She chose evil. Hans Frank‚Äôs son did not. There are some deeply admirable people in this movie.
@lepton939 You‚Äôre misunderstanding me, I think. The film is about people who have done remarkable things in response to the families they were born into‚Äîpeople who did precisely the opposite of what she did, people who deserve our respect and consideration.

@Baba_Lilith Never heard of it but will certainly check it out. Thank you.
@lisang Word
At the end of the day, what made Burwitz evil is not that she was born a Himmler. It‚Äôs that she chose to live her life as one.
The sins of the father are not the sins of the daughter. Her evil was her very own. Others, including others of her own family, made very different choices. 	One of them wrote this, for example:	https://t.co/REGbTTLMNK	The essence of liberalism is the belief in the individual.
@Kimsuesmom It‚Äôs a genuinely inspiring film.
@dgmuir Yup
The obituaries today of Gudrun Burwitz, Himmler‚Äôs daughter, reminds me that many people have probably never watched the documentary, Hitler's Children. It is superb. Not all of the children of senior Nazis are loathsome. 		Some are inspiring. 		Really. 	https://t.co/gnRLTYCAW9
@jadler1969 I honestly think if there‚Äôs hope here, it comes from the courts themselves. Judges, individually and collecticely, have been notably reticent about speaking on this subject. That should change.
@ishapiro @jadler1969 Yes meant 2121.
@jadler1969 Under those circumstances, I‚Äôm not sure I see any basis for hope.
@jadler1969 The point is that you and I could write reasonable, fair rules in an hour that both sides should jump at. And we could set them with an effective date of Jan 20, 2020 so nobody knows who they help or hurt. And ... neither side would support it.
@pwnallthethings @jadler1969 But that requires votes from both sides. And neither side wants to deescalate.
@jadler1969 @scallisoncole A decade ago, I suggested Senate rule changes with an effective date far enough in the future that we wouldn‚Äôt know which side would control the presidency or the Senate. It had salience for neither side.
@jadler1969 I‚Äôm not sure how you could create one, seeing as how it‚Äôs very hard for one Senate to bind another.
@jadler1969 The fundamental problem now is that there is no norm you could establish that either side would respect for a second when it had the power to gain by violating it. The result is a prisoner‚Äôs dilemma.
@jadler1969 I think the book was profoundly correct and it reads as wholly naive barely a decade later. Interestingly, when I considered the threat to judicial independence, I never seriously entertained Court packing!
@jadler1969 And it‚Äôs too late...
@jadler1969 Yes, I too. I wrote a whole book about it...
The key point is that this question could have been, should have been, and was asked about every escalation in the judicial confirmation wars.

.@Autumnsan1's judgment on the OIG report: "For a document of this length, there are surprisingly few grammatical errors."	Me: It's well copy-edited.	Autumn: I wouldn't go that far.
These are the big questions. Don‚Äôt get distracted from them.		That‚Äôs all I got‚Äîfor now. /9/
Does he find any misconduct by Peter Strzok and Lisa Page? Or have the names of these two career officials been dragged through the fever swamp mud for months for nothing more than bad judgment in expressing private views to one another? /8/
Assuming that the IG will criticize @Comey‚Äôs judgments in July and October 2016 regarding his two fateful public steps in the case, what does the report add to our understanding of his actions? 		And how does he evaluate the behavior of both Loretta Lynch and Sally Yates? /7/
Does the IG offer any reason to believe  that any senior official in the FBI engaged in any misconduct or abuse? /6/
Does the IG offer any reason to believe  the fundamental judgment not to prosecute Hillary Clinton (or anyone else) was in error? /5/
Does the IG offer any reason to believe that the investigation‚Äôs judgements were influenced in any direction by politics? /4/
Does the IG provide any reason to believe that the Clinton email investigation was not conducted in good faith? /3/
Here are the key questions to keep your eyes on: /2/
The OIG report is coming out today. It will yield a media frenzy, frantic digging out of small pieces of new information, certain presidential gaslighting and use of the matter to attack the unrelated Russia probe, and equally certain howls of vindication from Team Hillary. /1/

...from the White House and that he had spent months trying police the White House‚Äôs attempts to engage with the Bureau improperly on investigative matters. He was deeply troubled by those interactions. And he believed he was going to have to spend a lot more time doing it.
It is kind of odd for the President‚Äôs lawyers to be citing this comment‚Äîwith which I have some passing familiarity‚Äîas evidence that @Comey was content with the White House‚Äôs interactions with the FBI.

@bradheath Is he? That mildly changes my view--but only mildly.
For the record, I think rage-pardoning criminals who have served their sentences is a reasonably harmless means of leveraging the powers of the American presidency to troll those who believe in the rule of law.
The power to declare war resides with the legislature. The power to declare a trade war, including against our allies, lies in the hands of the President, alas.
@BobLoeb @qjurecic @matthewamiller I am actually NOT a quiet car person for exactly that reason. I would love the quiet car except that I choose to be neither norm enforcer nor free-rider on the tut-tutting of others. So I sit in the regular car and pine for silence.
@qjurecic @matthewamiller I see what you did there.
What is the stronger feeling: love of Amtrak‚Äôs Quiet Car or hatred of the self-appointed enforcers of its silence?

@wrdcsc @pwnallthethings @AndyGrewal I don‚Äôt think the firing of Comey is an impeachable offense. I think the pattern of conduct with respect to federal law enforcement, of which it is one small part, certainly is.
