New Delhi must brace itself for persistent Pakistani terrorism and its occasionally devastating success. Indian policymakers need to be honest about the ‚Äúinevitable consequences of living in a bad neighborhood,‚Äù says Tellis.	https://t.co/AeIG7BnaMx
Though India‚Äôs underequipped military has big implications, Ashley J. Tellis highlights a more consequential issue: the political failures in managing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.	https://t.co/jQvhkO5iuu
New Delhi must invest in increasing its national resilience. The Indian defense forces are underequipped and often lack even the most rudimentary technologies now available to combat terrorism.	https://t.co/jQvhkO5iuu
India must recognize that Pakistani terrorism can at best be mitigated‚Äînot eliminated‚Äîwithout fundamental change in Pakistan.		https://t.co/AeIG7BnaMx
The international community will sympathize with India, but it cannot neuter Pakistan‚Äôs exploitation of terrorism. 	So what would it take to get the international community to notice and take action?		https://t.co/jQvhkO5iuu
Jihadi terrorism is an effective strategy for Pakistan because	‚û°It provides the Pakistani ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù with plausible deniability	‚û°It avoids major confrontations that Pakistan is certain to lose	‚û°Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear deterrent becomes a license for Rawalpindi to needle New Delhi
A painful reality India cannot escape is that Pakistan is unlikely to give up jihadi terrorism because it is the best way of continuously coercing India. 		But why is it so effective?	https://t.co/jQvhkO5iuu
Across India, this has sparked a national discussion about what could have been done to prevent such an attack.		So far, India has:	‚û°Had dialogue with Pakistan	‚û°Militarily punished Pakistan 	‚û°Offered olive branches		https://t.co/AeIG7BnaMx

‚û°In 2013, 71% of Tunisians believed that democracy is preferable to any other kind of government.	‚û°In 2018, only 46% of Tunisians hold that belief.		Little faith in the government and declining voter turnout are other indicators of a changing attitude in Tunisia.	(8/9) https://t.co/VN8YA7l3N7

One thing is clear: More needs to be done to meet Tunisians‚Äô expectations for a better life. 	https://t.co/UOujRJlcFR	(5/9) https://t.co/hJje4wnDEY
So, why are Tunisians in such despair? Put simply, their goals‚Äî‚Äúwork, freedom, and national dignity‚Äù‚Äîremain unfulfilled.

Based on the decision made by the U.S. on the #IranDeal, will Iranians decide to blow up the entire deal?	‚ÄúIran is ultimately pragmatic because what it really wants is the survival of its regime‚Äù @jobahout predicted on @npratc https://t.co/I0djdQJb2e (9/10) https://t.co/6yKHcP8PW0
‚ÄúThere is a significant risk ... that we could be left in a situation of rapidly rising tensions with Iran, in which Iran is stockpiling more uranium enriched to a higher level that could ultimately end in a war,‚Äù wrote @james_acton32 https://t.co/mVvM4bZTR6 (8/10) https://t.co/KkeehVeaU2

.@jobahout: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs undeniable that if the U.S. does pull out, the JCPOA will be in serious jeopardy, especially if Iran not only considers the deal to be null and void, but also withdraws from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.‚Äù https://t.co/sArd9dZBWp (6/10) https://t.co/mc0x61M0Yc
.@ErikBrattberg and @PhLeCorre wrote, ‚ÄúNone of the E3 states (France, Britain, Germany) want to withdraw from the Iran deal, but Trump needs to decide by May 12 if he will re-impose new sanctions against Iran.‚Äù https://t.co/9LaAONvK3o (5/10) https://t.co/fCnR5oeAGG
