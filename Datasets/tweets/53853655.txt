I would have respected him more if he asked my friend to lower her voice. What I will say is that he tends to be an equal opportunity rude guy. "Way to go," @NJTRANSIT. #NJTransit #njcommute
He rudely reminds us its the quiet car so no talking as he keeps walking by. So I tell him #1 you should have put the signs up before leaving the station before passengers get settled; #2 "hushed conversations" are allowed per signage. #NJTransit #njcommute
Someone wins the rudest conductor ever award today. Car #7704 on train #3866 leaving Trenton at 5:04 pm. After leaving the station, he puts up quiet car signs. I purposely sat in the 2nd car and not the 1st since I was catching up with a friend. #NJTransit #njcommute
