Social media are annoying! They overwhelm us with information we don't want. So I have to say: I'm OK with the robots. I, for one, will welcome our new robot overlords. We're increasingly overloaded with information and we need AI to make sense of it	-Grace Koh		#SiliconFlatirons

LISTEN CAREFULLY TO MOZILLA!		"Tom Wheeler didn't create #NetNeutrality. It existed for years and years and years. We had principles..."		Yeah, exactly, WITHOUT #TitleII 		So we don't need Title II (or 706). Just a bill to provide clear authority.
Me after 3+ hours of yet another #NetNeutrality hearing (&amp; 11 years stuck in this Groundhog Day )		The way out here is REALLY simple: pass clear rules so the FCC doesn't need to claim vague, open-ended power to do whatever the fuck it wants (decide what's "just and reasonable") https://t.co/W2e1kv7JPS
Q: Would antitrust law prevent an ISP from blocking or throttling for political reasons?	A: No		Yeah, but marketing a service that connects to the entire Internet and then blocking would be deceptive, so FTC could act just as much as FCC could		#NetNeutrality https://t.co/gakiUY7iwo
FOR THE LOVE OF APOLLO, no one said repealing #TitleII would result in an explosion of investment. Title II caused less investment than otherwise would've occurred; repealing it caused more than otherwise would've occurred. 		Why are people so bad at marginalism?		#NetNeutrality
But my favorite part of today's agonizing 3-hour #NetNeutrality hearing?		Listening to non-lawyers confidently explain that #TitleII was no big deal because look at all the good stuff the FCC could do with it!		(Never mind the fact that it would let the FCC do BASICALLY ANYTHING)
There comes a point [after FOUR rounds of 3-year cycles of litigation] when it becomes clear that the problem the #FCC is struggling with is a lack of clear direction from the people's elected representatives	- @ChairmanPowell 		BINGO. That's why we need a #NetNeutrality law

The most outrageous thing about the arguments made today against the #RIFO: the insistence that the #FCC's NPRM failed to provide adequate notice of the ultimate grounds for the decision. Cry me a freaking river, folks.		The 2015 order was a FAR greater departure from their NPRM
I'm gonna have to head out soon, but... here's basically where the arguments against the FCC's ability to disclaim #TitleII authority stand		(This really is an easy case for the FCC to win) https://t.co/HPDIctZPOM
It was on that basis that the DC Circuit en banc dismissed first amendment arguments -- because the rules simply hold providers to the promises they make to consumers to deliver connectivity to substantially all endpoints		(which is what the FTC now does, too)
"If an ISP wanted to block certain offensive content, there's no evidence the market would fix that problem"		uh, yeah, and also the FCC has very clearly said that ISPs could opt-out of #NetNeutrality rules simply by clearly disclosing that they were curating the internet

Oy... back to the #TitleII pizza shop analogy in Justice Scalia's BrandX DISSENT		Does the pizza shop have a refrigerator?	Does it deliver by Uber eats?	What about those cute Estonian robots?	What toppings can I get?	Is it gluten-free?	Organic?	How much for the chimera special?
@digiphile I'd go further: if the FCC's 2015 logic for reclassifying broadband under Title II stands, I don't see how VoIP could NOT be a Title II service
@digiphile Perhaps you haven't bothered to read our briefs? The FCC's 2015 Order opened the door for many non-broadband services to be common carrier, most obviously VoIP, but arguably ANY service that uses an IP address
OH MY GOD. Would someone please get Judge Williams to sit closer to the mic?!?		I keep having to crank up the volume to max whenever he asks a question, then crank it down when Pantelis' booming, downright Olympian voice returns
@danieltdeacon Listening to Pantelis reminds me of that amazing scene the classic French film "Ridicule":  a rhetorician dazzles the court at Versailles by proving the existence of God. After a thunderous applause, he then goes a step too far: "Now, if you like, I could also prove the opposite"
@danieltdeacon Thank you!		This is great statutory interpretation theater but it's a waste of everyone's time
Williams nails it: DC Circuit in USTelecom said again and again that the FCC's 2015 Order was "reasonable," not that it was the right interpretation 		Pantelis is a great appellate lawyer, but he's trying to dazzle the court to distract them from the key fact: Chevron controls
@M_F_Rose I'm pretty sure everyone knows you and me just from our voices, too
This discussion of what ISPs do and don't offer today (vis-a-vis) whether they're "offering telecommunications" is fascinating, but under Chevron, it's a question for the agency to resolve, not judges		Now, if you want to dump Chevron and review the statute de novo, let's go!

THE #privacy question finally gets asked at #CPDP2019: how far do we have to go to protect people from themselves?
Reasonable people working in good faith can disagree about how to implement consent flow. Compliance with #GDPR requires an ongoing dialogue	- Google rep		Spanish academic looks ready to pounce		#CPDP19
Google rep says over 500 engineers were involved in implementing GDPR compliance--that's not "GDPR avoidance")		Also Google’s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified in Sept. that Google spent ”hundreds of years of human time” on engineering compliance with GDPR		#CPDP19
@FusterGloria Applying the GDPR would be a far better way of thinking critically about the intersection of legal theory and real-world challenges
@FusterGloria The very title of this panel "Defending the GDPR" pretty aptly summarizes the usual Groupthink at #CPDP19 and a huge status quo bias: 	1) This is the European approach to privacy	2) Therefore this is the best and only approach to privacy		Doesn't bode well for the 2020 Review...

Spanish #privacy academic @FusterGloria definitely the award for rudest remarks so far: "I want to talk about GDPR avoidance and denial. But I'll leave it to the Google rep to tell you about GDPR avoidance. They're the experts in pretending they comply..."		#CPDP19 #obnoxious

@M_Ohlhausen @TerrellMcSweeny @elizabethbanker @CRCalabrese @JasonAlb @AngeliqueCarson @privacypen Surprisingly reasonable take from @CRCalabrese: insisting on a private right of action would sink federal #privacy legislation, which we need to avert the mess of states trying to regulate privacy on their own		Amen.		#SOTN19
@M_Ohlhausen @TerrellMcSweeny @elizabethbanker @CRCalabrese @JasonAlb @AngeliqueCarson @privacypen Yes, AGs should play a role in #privacy--just as with COPPA: AGs should be able to enforce federal standards	- @M_Ohlhausen 		Exactly right. The last thing we need is 56 AGs re-shaping the nature of the law on their own.		#SOTN19
@M_Ohlhausen @TerrellMcSweeny @elizabethbanker @CRCalabrese @JasonAlb @AngeliqueCarson @privacypen The FTC should have rulemaking authority over specific, well-understood #privacy issues. And maybe some kind of civil penalty authority.	- @M_Ohlhausen 		Yes to #1, but scoping is very hard. And civil penalties are only appropriate for violations of rules, not standards.		#SOTN19
@M_Ohlhausen @TerrellMcSweeny @elizabethbanker @CRCalabrese @JasonAlb @AngeliqueCarson @privacypen Notice &amp; consent remains important when the purposes for which data is to be used are not consistent with the reasonable expectations of users in context	- @elizabethbanker 		And yes, of course, SOME uses are so likely to be harmful that consent shouldn't justify them		#SOTN19

Livetweeting #SOTN19 panel: "Cloudy with a Chance of Legislation: The Past, Present, and Future of U.S. #Privacy Policy" with @M_Ohlhausen @TerrellMcSweeny  @elizabethbanker @CRCalabrese @jasonalb &amp; @AngeliqueCarson @privacypen
.@makandelrahim lauds Microsoft's antitrust conviction for monopolizing the browser market--without ever mentioning that the middleware theory behind that case has turned out to be irrelevant		Think hard about how much of what you do requires browser extensions...		#SOTN19
Would Instagram be what it is today if Facebook hadn't bought it? Would YouTube be what it is today without Google? It's really hard to know	- @makandelrahim 		Yup		#SOTN19
You can't impose the same regulations on social media sites as broadcasters because Internet media get full First Amendment protections		And you certainly can't take a harder antitrust approach to 1A-protected conduct		#SOTN19
After @makandelrahim compares Google to broadcasters (both in 2-sided markets with free products), as antitrust analogy, @tedstew says, "Broadcasters would say they're heavily regulated)		Yeah, but remember: broadcasters don't get full 1A rights because of Red Lion		#SOTN19
These sites are, in fact, PRIVATE fora, with full First Amendment rights to run their sites as they see fit, free of government interference		Which means that most of social media regulations proposed by politicos (of BOTH parties) would be unconstitutional		#SOTN19

I'm excited about finally addressing the issue of #NetNeutrality this year	- @USRepMikeDoyle, who bears more responsibility than ANYONE for Congress not passing legislation. Because he and other Dems simply ignored Republican proposals failing to introduce their own bill		#SOTN19
@AdamThierer That doesn't even make sense. I can rant just as easily on Twitter by listening to the audio.
A Democratic Congress wisely understood that marrying FTC's uniquely broad jurisdiction and vague power with general rulemaking authority and civil penalty authority would allow the agency to be, in effect, the second national legislature		#SOTN19
And forcing the FTC to narrow its understanding of its unfairness powers		To understand why FTC can't make rules easily or impose penalties under Sec. 5 for 1st time violations, read Howard Beales' account of this key chapter in the FTC's history https://t.co/nsFPaqoeMC		#SOTN19
#FTC had 50% more employees at the beginning of the Reagan administration 	- @Slaughter		She fails to mention WHY: the DEMOCRATIC Congress slashed FTC's budget after its crazy rulemaking bender in the late 70s after briefly closing the agency, making rulemaking harder...		#SOTN19

Whether or not Trump actually agrees with you is irrelevant. He's incapable of executing ANYTHING competently, and his support for a cause can probably only harm it in the long run (and maybe even in the very short run).		@TheRickWilson is right: Everything Trump touches dies
Many libertarians live to congratulate themselves for being more woke than all friends on the Left because they're antiwar. Many of those have gushed over Trump's announcement, convincing themselves that the American Empire may finally be coming to an end.		I call bullshit.
It's like the much vaunted but entirely fake "nuclear deal" with North Korea, except undermining the cause that I considered perhaps most important in politics pre-Trump: anti-imperialism		Not to mention hurting our allies on the ground and our credibility in geopolitics

KUDOS to the #FTC on their #datasecurity workshop. Great discussion of the hard issues facing the agency.		I only wonder why the Commission didn't hold this workshop a decade ago...		#FTChearings
How effective are the FTC's current data security orders?		Does anyone have any idea? This is the problem!	- @GeoffManne		Companies under orders spend enormous resources on compliance	- Lydia Parnes		OK but #datasecurity spending matters less than outputs		#FTChearings
The issue isn't really whether there's a punishment sufficient to deter (there already is). Before we give FTC fining authority, we have to address the process problems at #FTC: insufficient notice to allow companies to determine what's reasonable	-@GeoffManne		#FTChearings
The FTC's "one bite at the apple" rule (no civil penalties for first time violations of Section 5) doesn't exist in other areas of the law	- @Richardson_Mich 		Yeah, because Section 5 is uniquely broad and vague, and this avoids constitutional fair notice problems		#FTChearings
FTC did a FANTASTIC job of articulating the challenge of dealing with unpredictable problems with rulemaking in the 1980 Unfairness Policy Statement. But the judicial review component is KEY!	-@GeoffManne (stealing all my best material -- from our past joint work)		#FTChearings https://t.co/2ZgZgoTktS
Civil penalties are the "shotgun I keep behind the door: I hope not to use it but I keep it well-oiled"	- @BillMcGev		Cute but misses 2 key points:	1) FTC already coerces settlements far too easily, so...	2) Penalties are unconstitutional without fair notice		#FTChearings
Regulation is either too specific or too vague. It's Goldilocks!	-@Richardson_Mich 		Yeah, that's why we should focus on clarifying procedural standards as @dbthaw and @GeoffManne have argued		As Lydia notes, that may not work under Section 5 today, see 11th cir dec		#FTChearings
Lack of fining authority prevents the #FTC from showing a spectrum of bad #datasecurity, reducing it to the binary of settlement yes/no	-@hartzog 		But there are many other concerns here, such as 11th Circuit's critique of FTC's cookiecutter settlements	-@GeoffManne		#FTChearings
To the extent the #FTC talks about the characteristics of the companies it's bringing #datasecurity cases against, it merely mentions size without EXPLAINING how that size relates to the reasonableness of practices	- @GeoffManne		#FTChearings
Even at trial, the FTC's expert witness could only point to the #datasecurity practices of Fortune 500 companies. It had nothing to say about small companies like LabMD		#FTChearings
Let's not worry too much about #datasecurity practices scale: small businesses will generally use security systems designed by big companies, so regulation can scale easily	- @Richardson_Mich		In general yes, but.... tell that to LabMD!		#FTChearings
The problem with gov't doing penetration testing and #FTC closing letters is that the FTC hasn't provided fair notice for the vast majority of firms of how it applies Section 5 to #datasecurity. FTC can't just assert what "best practices" should be	- @geoffmanne 		#FTChearings
Unless and until the #FTC has shown that certain #datasecurity practices are a baseline of reasonable data security, they shouldn't bring enforcement actions for failure to do those. And once they do establish that, it should be put into rules	- @geoffmanne 		#FTChearings
.@geoffmanne's right: it's hugely problematic to presume today that breach today necessarily means there's harm. It's even more problematic to claim there's harm without any breach at all		#FTChearings
#FTC should bring enforcement actions even in the absence of breach because good #datasecurity is about process, not results	- @hartzog 		Fine, but an unfairness claim requires proof of harm, or likelihood to cause harm. Read Section 5(n)!		#FTChearings
Data breaches don't necessarily demonstrate the most lax security. Remediating after breaches will only by chance remedy the greatest #datsecurity issues	- @GeoffManne		#FTChearings
#FTC should be a convener of information:	1) clearinghouse about breaches 	2) how to do data security better [a la Green Guides, IMHO]	3) coordinator of #datasecurity self-regulatory efforts	-@GeoffManne		#FTChearings
AMEN: #FTC could end the use of SSNs as passwords by bringing an enforcement action or two against this as unreasonable/unfair #datasecurity	- @DanielSolove 		#FTChearings
AMEN! Ex ante regulation need not be prescriptive. It can set up standards for assessing the reasonableness of #datasecurity processes. HHS just hasn't developed meaning of such standards under HIPAA through case law.	- @DBThaw		#FTChearings
Best #datasecurity rule I've seen is the HIPAA rule AS WRITTEN (focused on PROCESS), which has been bastardized in practice by turning it into checklist requirements	-@DBThaw		Agreed. Focus on process!		#FTChearings
I get the dangers #datasecurity checklists. We'll have to meet some organizations where they are, especially small non-profits	-@CRCalabrese 		In other words: just don't regulate US at the ACLU!		#Shameless		Exemptions are bad. Parity for all makes sensible rules		#FTChearings
Great example of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing #datasecurity: universities are divided into many fiefdoms to maximize academic freedom by maintaining control at department/school level--which is a terrible way to way to manage security	- @DanielSolove 		#FTChearings
#DataSecurity is so complex problem that any legislation needs to preempt state legislation	Checklists will only HELP adversaries by telling adversaries exactly what the organization is NOT doing	So balance spectrum of goals &amp; harms, avoid prescription	- @DBThaw		#FTChearings
RT @kpyke: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? https://t.co/9lhxuwlU7a
Consumers are heterogeneous, so it's really hard to estimate harm when the range is so wide	- @DBThaw		Indeed! But what does that mean for how to think about redress?		#FTChearings
We don't really know how to make consumers whole after a data breach. Credit monitoring works when lines of credit are opened, but not more generally. There may not BE a solution. We don't know what we're solving FOR in most #datasecurity cases	- @LisaSotto		#FTChearings
Breach notice fatigue: we're not really helping consumers when less sensitive information is disclosed in a breach	-@JanisKestenbaum 		Use a harm threshold to decide whether notification is required	-@LisaSotto		Also there's notice to consumer v notice to regulator		#FTChearings
KEY POINT: Big part of the #datasecurity problem is that businesses have converted gov't-issued identification numbers (SSNs, DLNs passport #s) into authentication credentials, thus making consumers vulnerable to breach when they shouldn't be	- @dbthaw 		#FTChearings
Remember, we're not just talking about personal information being at #datasecurity risk; we're talking about IP and sensitive trade secrets. So companies have a lot more incentive to secure the data	- @LisaSotto		#FTChearings
Which market forces are driving #datasecurity?		In order:	1) Loss of consumer trust	2) Loss of business partner trust	3) Concern among employees	....	legal mandates	...	lawsuits		- @LisaSotto		#FTChearings
Nobody wants to be the company with the breach. Avoiding that is a top priority of boards of directors. It's NOT civil penalties (or the lack thereof) that drive investment in #datasecurity	- @JanisKestenbaum 		#FTChearings
Do companies focus #datasecurity efforts where penalties are highest? 		Most companies focus on what's best for the biz, re the sensitivity of the data they hold, the threat they face... The law is largely irrelevant	- @LisaSotta		So civil penalties would add what?		#FTChearings
Why does self-regulation matter so much in #datasecurity?		Because if a merchant doesn't comply with the payment processors' data security standards, it loses the ability to process credit card transactions--a death sentence	-@lisasotto		#FTChearings

"Remember, we can't really say how much good #datasecurity is going to cost a small business"		Fair enough. But if so, how could you possibly impose civil penalties on a company for failing to predict how much investment in data security is "reasonable?!?"		#FTChearings
"Patching isn't a panacea. It also creates risk (by creating a vulnerability that can be exploited)"		Yup. Such tradeoffs are why #datasecurity is so hard, and why case-by-case assessment is inevitable, why rulemaking and civil penalties will often be inappropriate		#FTChearings

.@RepRaskin: Why isn't YouTube doing more to take down right-wing conspiracy theory videos, a la Pizzagate?		The whole point of this anti-conservative bias ranting is to discourage social networks from taking down this kind of right-wing lunacy		#GoogleHearing

.@RepAndyBiggsAZ: Yeah Google has a First Amendment right but you say you don't have bias! 		So... (veers off topic)		So what? "Bias" is inherently subjective. The 1A bars government from interrogating companies about, even their claims not to be biased. MOVE ON! 		#GoogleHearing

Republican ranting about social networks isn't just Trumpian complaining		It's aimed at:	1) strong-arming social networks to FAVOR crappy, unreliable pseudo-journalism (propaganda)	2) expanding "The media" as "enemies of the American people" to include new media		#GoogleHearing

RT @ProfWrightGMU: Very nice thread from @BerinSzoka on the FTC workshop on Economics of Consumer Protection. https://t.co/mGtFTmQcXq
SHOCKING:	1/8 Americans get defrauded each year, and they're often the same people		A great reminder of the critical work the #FTC does in consumer protection, and why the FTC needs to focus on real harms, not fun, conjectural problems (which too many privacy cases turn into)
@MarkHutton2 Um... if by "Conflict of Ideas" you mean "Conflict of empty, bullshit, emotionally-based talking points that pass for ideas on Fox News," then yes
What a giant baby Trump is		And yet he still won't fire Kelly. He'll just pout until Kelly finally quits		How fitting that Trump is the Great Defender of the Wounded White American Male Ego https://t.co/wDAMevoeaD
Have they considered hiring a kindergarten teacher?!? https://t.co/K0opM4SEW4
This is why the Nomi case is so troubling for hard #FTC consumer protection cases (esp. in privacy and user interface design)		Read "The Dark Side of Nomi" by me &amp; @GeoffManne: https://t.co/UoK0pACDym
KEY POINT FROM TODAY:	Just because consumers didn't understand the disclosure doesn't mean they were harmed. If they would have made the same choice anyway, they couldn't have been harmed	- Mike Baye		YES! Materiality is SUPPOSED to be the lodestar of deception
GREAT LINES FROM TODAY'S #FTC CONSUMER PROTECTION WORKSHOP:	Why do economists live in a slum dwelling in consumer protection land? It might be the nature of the beast	- Mike Baye		How much would people be willing to pay to live in a world where no one lied?	- Tim Brennan		🤔🤔🤔
RT @tedlieu: When John Kelly was hired as Chief of Staff, I said this was like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. If John Kelly resign…
I'm reminded of Alan Blinder's quote: an economist is someone who sees something work in practice and says, "Yes, but does it work in theory?"	- Tim Brennan		Also true of the French--a nation of congenital Cartesians
I like the idea of a consumer protection economics handbook, but I'm not sure how many handbooks there should be. Probably not exactly one.	- Joseph Farrell 		#ILoveListeningToEconomistsFrameSimpleThings
Consumer protection is a little like antitrust would be if the #FTC brought 6 naked price fixing cases a week	- Joseph Farrell 		Yup, exactly, traditional CP has been fraud (inherently bad) but privacy is hard because it's more like antitrust rule of reason cases: hard tradeoffs!
Economists' view of consumer protection is: Markets mostly work but we're looking out for exceptions		But that's not the view of front-line #FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection, who sees scam after scam all day	- Joseph Farrell
When an economist comes in and says "Ah, interesting, but not so fast"		the response is likely to be: "Yes, so fast! Faster if possible!"		- Joseph Farrell on the role economists SHOULD play in checking the knee-jerk impulses of consumer protection regulation
Why isn't there more economics in consumer protection work? Because economists will tend to supply what the courts demand	- Joseph Farrell		BINGO. That's why it's hugely problematic that the #FTC manages never to litigate privacy &amp; data security cases, the cutting edge of CP
Paul Pautler: Behavioral economics is heading towards questioning whether consumers are really capable of making decisions for themselves. If so, we'd have to give up on the idea of better informing consumer choice--an idea that most economists recoil at
Nobel laureate and former Tennessee farm boy James Buchanan once said "Being an economist is better than plowing" https://t.co/PrzWDmmbmr
Lawrence White: When the consumer protection bar begs the #FTC for classes on the microeconomics of consumer protection--as the antitrust bar did decades ago--then you'll know that economics has really established itself in consumer protection law
LIVE NOW: #FTC workshop on "Consumer Protection Economics" https://t.co/sKzHYSlbmB		Key theme: unlike antitrust, there's no FTC handbook on Consumer Protection Economics OR Guidelines on Consumer Injury		Sadly, the room is mostly empty. Why don't more people care?!? https://t.co/UhPSqPJiYY

@alexkotch @readsludge Also, the grants made to other organizations seem to reflect not cash donations but Koch's support for fellows who worked at those groups. Koch has helped many libertarian organizations, including my own, bring on talent for a summer or the first year. That's NOT direct funding

@alexkotch @readsludge I'm as appalled as anyone by how ugly and Trumpish The Daily Caller has become		But I do think you're missing an key part of the story: the DC changed a lot after the election. And the grants made to them in 2017 would reflect decisions Koch made BEFORE that transformation

Yet @chopraftc concludes by noting that data is more and more valuable in the economy and "similar to gold"		But then, at the same time, it's really not that hard to just throw away much/most of your data because we decided back in the 1970s that "data minimization" was good
Blumenthal adds: And I'm assuming you'll let this Committee know about any future contacts he might have with the White House 		Smart move to protect the FTC's independence from Trump meddling!		Simons: I'll check with the FTC General Counsel and get back to you about that
And good for @SenBlumenthal for getting the #FTC Commissioners all on record as to whether the White House has contacted the FTC about Matthew Whitaker and his participation in a scam company under investigation by the FTC
I mean, I'm all for recognizing subjective consumer preferences		So we should enforce Kosher and Halal labeling even though it's all silly pre-modern nonsense		But that hardly makes it a top priority for the FTC, especially when there are REAL harms to protect consumers against
.@SenCapito: what is the #FTC doing about the fraudulent use of the Made in America label?		Which just reminds us all that the Right, too, has phantom harms it wants the FTC to police		As @RKSlaughterFTC notes, it's REALLY hard to prove injury		BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER!
.@chopraftc: "I'm not sure the tradeoffs are incredibly hard"		Says a guy who isn't a technologist and has never run a company		We're talking about the law requiring companies to throw away huge amounts of useful data. The costs could be enormous.		This is THE critical tradeoff
Perhaps the best question of the #FTCoversight hearing, from @SenCortezMasto: how do we balance the concept of data minimization with the many benefits of big data analytics?		And how does that balance connect to "targeted #FTC rulemaking authority?"
Bless @SenatorTomUdall for using his 5 minutes to ask the #FTC Commissioners about the FTC's investigation into the World Patent Marketing scam, and the participation of Matthew Whitaker, Trump's Acting Attorney General		All 5 Commissioners: we don't play politics, PERIOD
.@SenMarkey just used his entire five minutes to rant about marketing to children and the need to update #COPPA		No mention at all of the effect that the FTC's 2013 COPPA update had on the quality, cost and diversity of children's media		Regulation has costs, folks!	#FTCoversight
Folks, this is THE key debate		Civil penalties make sense only where (1) harms are clear enough ex ante that we can prescribe them in rules and (b) rules give fair notice of what's required		NOT for enforcing vague standards, eg, what is unreasonable or unfair		#FTCoversight
.@JoeSimonsFTC: #FTC needs civil penalty authority for #datasecurity, and likely the same for #privacy as well		@FTCPhillips: My view is different: on privacy, it's much harder to know what is good and bad conduct, and civil penalties should be reserved for (clearly) bad conduct
.@chopraftc: "as cities grow, they have to hire more cops"		Yup. The best place to start in re-thinking how the FTC polices #privacy #datasecurity and #antitrust online is FTC staffing and budget--RATHER THAN radically transforming the legal framework that has served us well
.@SenBlumenthal just spent a solid minute hammering @JoeSimonsFTC on whether Facebook lived up to its consent decree (re Cambridge Analytica)		Simons kept saying he couldn't answer--WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE INVESTIGATION		Blumenthal knows better. What a shameless grandstander!
and required the agency to constrain its understanding of Unfairness		The FTC was lucky to survive this encounter with Congress (and remember, the House, where appropriations starts, remained in Democratic hands until 1994)		You can't just blame the FTC shrinking on Republicans
.@RKSlaughterFTC: #FTC has fewer employees today per capita than at the beginning of the REAGAN administration!		Yeah, but she leaves out the key reason: the FTC had run so wild in the late 1970s that the DEMOCRATIC Congress slashed its budget, restricted its rulemaking power...
@RKSlaughterFTC is right: #FTC needs to litigate more		But she doesn't mention the most important reason: because settling every single case doesn't make good law--or any law at all		#FTCoversight
@JustinBrookman @SenBlumenthal We're talking past each other. I'm saying:	(1) civil penalties are generally appropriate for rules, not standards	(2) Congress should grant rulemaking power over clear problems, or require the FTC to show that further regulation is really needed
.@FTCPhillips: people have wildly different views depending on exactly which #privacy problem we're talking about		RIGHT! Because "Privacy" isn't a single problem, but a vast and sprawling continent of concerns		It's a mistake to think we can have a single, comprehensive solution
No #FTCoversight hearing would be complete without my pointing out that @JoeSimonsFTC is exactly the regulator we want to protect the consumers of Amity Island from corporate sharks		An #FTC with... teeth?		😉 https://t.co/NWH0MM9hKi
@joejerome @JustinBrookman Sure. Come on the @TechFreedom @techpolicypdcst! We could record anytime this week! @Ashkhen will host
@JustinBrookman @SenBlumenthal In other words, data security legislation should focus on those aspects of the problem that are amenable to regulation: avoiding clearly bad data security		But those practices which may or may not be reasonable ex ante should continue to be dealt with by something like unfairness
@JustinBrookman @SenBlumenthal That's essentially what @JoeSimonsFTC just called for: #FTC civil penalty authority not across the board but rather to enforce data security legislation on top of Section 5		In principle, I'm OK with that, as long as we're not talking about fines for predicting "reasonableness"
@JustinBrookman @SenBlumenthal So how do we know ex ante when that's clear?		Historically, Congress, not the FTC, has drawn that line: by writing legislation for specific, reasonably clear problems. FTC issues rules, so companies know what the law requires--and thus monetary penalties make sese		#FTCoversight
PREDICTION: Republicans would rather agree to dumb ideas (like imposing monetary penalties on companies who fail to predict the unpredictable, like what the #FTC will decide is "unfair") than increasing the agency's budget		Because, you know, "smaller government" 💩
#FTCoversight hearing has just started but @SenBlumenthal is already hammering on the single worst idea you'll hear today: imposing civil penalties for first-time violations of § 5		Penalties make sense ONLY for clear-cut violations where companies have fair notice of the law
Blumenthal comes out swinging against "Big Tech"		But remember that all the privacy, data security and other #FTC consumer protection matters discussed today at the #FTCoversight hearing will affect ALL tech companies, and small ones will be far more hurt by steeper regulation
Oh, weird: the #FTCoversight testimony listed under @chopraftc's name was actually the written testimony for the full Commission		That explains why no testimony appeared for anyone else. Their oral remarks will appear on the FTC later today, no doubt		https://t.co/UVtZZikDEc
Finally, the #FTCoversight #FTC hearing has started! https://t.co/yr3t5PxX6I
I agree with @SenBillNelseon:	1) #FTC's probably too small (1000 FTEs, $100 million), could use more funding, though I have no idea how big would be big enough, and I doubt he does either	2) FTC should generally continue to be as bipartisan as possible 		https://t.co/xfyLm7Xtov
Still waiting for the #FTCoversight hearing, set for 2:30 to start...		Disappointed to see testimony only from @chopraftc and a minority statement from @SenBillNelson 		Where's the testimony for the other #FTC Commissioners (3 Rs, 1 D)?
If if it makes you feel any better, Boris Johnson may actually be dumber/more ignorant than Donald Trump		So it was just AWESOME that @AEI, one of America's most respected "think tanks," honored this knuckle-dragger with their Irving Kristol award and to keynote their annual gala https://t.co/ZblyabKsDj

@Lizsview @guyverhofstadt Twice?  You mean 1940 and... 1870, I presume?		Tl;dr: Having Germany on your border (and a feud over Alsace-Lorraine since Louis XIV conquered it in 1697) is kind of a tough break		Also, Louis XIV absolutely dominated Europe and Napoléon conquered basically all of it (-Russia)
@Obelisk_1985 @guyverhofstadt Um, Louis XIV's lavish spending on the American cause bankrupted France, led to the downfall of a dynasty that had ruled France since 1589, and thus the turmoil of the French Revolution, which engulfed Europe til at least 1815, arguably 1848, and maybe all the way through 1918.

@KDbyProxy @HalSinger @maggie_reardon oy		Anyway, whatever the experience of SJC Dems, they handled the hearing like a bunch of amateurs. The more I think about it, the madder I am about it. They had a chance to let him hang himself so clearly that no one (save maybe Lindsay Graham) could have denied it--and blew it
@KDbyProxy @HalSinger @maggie_reardon The Dems did a crap job of cross-examining him		I mean, like asking him what a "Devil's Triangle" was, and then, when he said "a drinking game," feebly just asking "how's it played?" and then letting him get away with the vague answer of "three cups"		They needed to drill down
@maggie_reardon Their tactical strategy clearly didn't work		Someone with actual experience in cross-examining witnesses could have made far more clear what we (but not enough Americans saw): that he was probably lying, at a minimum about his drinking and that this volcanic rage disqualifies him
@maggie_reardon My point isn't that Democrats needed to establish his guilt, but that they failed to prove or focus on what actually mattered: his credibility in general, his temperament, and yes, the greater likelihood that he had simply forgotten after two many beers than that she was mistaken
@cathysloanva @amyklobuchar @JohnCornyn Yeah, well, they didn't really do that great a job		And even if they had, they should have had skilled trial lawyer use most, if not all, their time		They fucked up		And I'm not defending Grassley or any Republican.

Delrahim: 30 years before Bork's 1979 book, it was Justice Jackson (an FDR appointee) who pushed #antitrust law away from the government setting prices and focusing on consumer welfare
.@JoeSimonsFTC people are raising concerns about the bipartisan consensus that's existed for 25 years: that #antitrust should focus on CONSUMER welfare		We're hearing those concerns, to try to put that consensus back together		🤔
@andrewbridges @SenBooker No, not price alone. Of course, there are other dimensions of consumer welfare		But it's CONSUMERS' welfare that matters, not producers. The antitrust laws aren't intended to reshape industrial organization to suit political preferences, but to serve consumers.
.@SenBooker: isn't #privacy an #antitrust issue by creating a level playing field?		@JoeSimonsFTC: We need to work with you and other Senators on this. [translation: no, not really.] We also need to be careful that regulation doesn't skew competition against small companies

.@SenBlumenthal: search algorithms might guide users away from better options. What can #antitrust do about search fairness &amp; AI?		Delrahim: could be (1) competitors using algorithms to fix prices (as in a pending criminal case) or (2) potential monopolization hurting entry
.@SenBlumenthal: when was the last time DOJ cited labor market issues in rejecting a merger?		@MakanDelrahim: IDK but we've addressed poaching issues in labor markets		Blumenthal has a point: monopsony COULD be an #antitrust problem but NOT job cuts from a merger (an efficiency)

So it's a good that Republican FCC returned broadband to Title I status (arguably meaning it is no longer a "carrier")		And ironic that #NetNeutrality advocates want to give Trump MORE power over broadband, including the power to REQUIRE prioritization 		3/3 #PresidentialAlert
47 U.S.C. § 606 (War powers of President) give the President broad power to control what "carriers" (which likely means "common carriers" subject to #TitleII) do with their networks, including the power to prioritize "necessary" communications during time of war		2/3
Alarmed by the idea that Donald Trump could turn FEMA's Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system into a propaganda tool for his Twitter rants?		Reclassifying broadband under #TitleII would have made that a lot easier		Read: https://t.co/Xp2KZsFckG		#PresidentialAlert 		THREAD... 1/3

WHAT?!? #BrettKavanaugh didn't bother to watch Dr Blasey Ford's testimony?		"but he plans to later?"		Are you kidding me? I thought this entire afternoon was supposed to be his opportunity to RESPOND
Yup: the Trumps either egged #BrettKavanaugh on or outright coached him to go on the attack today		Shouting at lady Senators probably wasn't the smartest move		But then... what kind of rhetoric do you expect from the Trump Crime Family's chapter of Toastmasters? https://t.co/kQ9SoCU40T
@unrocket https://t.co/w1AMA1UJUw
@Johartz @maziehirono Yeah, no kidding -- despite Republicans' efforts to paint this as a trial, so they can claim that the claims haven't been proven beyond a reasonable doubt... ergo... confirmation!		This is a job interview. He's not handling himself in a way that suggests judicial temperament
#BrettKavanaugh: all the witnesses there say it didn't happen		What the witnesses actually said: they couldn't remember being at such a party or that Blasey Ford said anything to her about it at the time (which she notes she didn't)		Also, her friend says she believes Ford
@Johartz @maziehirono I don't know who you clerked for, but my judge (a Republican throughout his life and 35 years on the Federal bench) would never have tolerated this kind of behavior in his courtroom from an attorney, let alone behaved this way in any public setting		It's not judicial temperament
@Johartz @maziehirono There's mad (and he has every right to be mad at Feinstein) and then there's shouting at every Democratic Senato on stage, but especially the women		He hasn't done himself any favors with that kind of behavior		Also, it's not slander if it's true -- which we don't yet know
Sen @MazieHirono missed the kill shot: She asked if #BrettKavanaugh thought temperament was important for being on the Court (YES) but then failed to ask about his temperament at today's hearing -- like shouting at, interrupting, and interrogating Dem Senators (especially women)
Whoops: kill SHOT
Sen @MazieHirono missed the kill shit: She asked if #BrettKavanaugh thought temperament was important for being on the Court (YES) but then failed to ask about his temperament at today's hearing -- like shouting at, interrupting, and interrogating Dem Senators (especially women)
@mblafkin @JeffFlake Well, yes, but let's see what he says first
Basically, all that matters today is what @JeffFlake says		He can block the #BrettKavanaugh nomination in committee if he wants to. And he's probably he only Republican who might (Sasse's sympathy for Dr Blasey Ford aside)		So... stay tuned! Everything else is just prelude.
"...also the moment when the Senate, once acclaimed as the 'world's greatest deliberative body,' began its transition into the #BrettKavanaugh Mixed-Martial-Arts-cum-Comedy-Grand-Slam Arena that still attracts tourists from across the Solar System"
22ND CENTURY NARRATOR: "... most historians of the 21st century mark the #BrettKavanaugh hearing as the moment when the Republican Party finally alienated all but the nuttiest women, ensuring the Party's electoral oblivion and transformation into a pure Trumpist personality cult"
Ugh, Blumenthal's Latin is even worse than #BrettKavanaugh's ("Renate alumnius")		It's "falsus in uno falsus in omnibus"		Not "falsIBUS"
.@SenMikeLee nails it: @SenFeinstein didn't have to go public with Dr Blasey Ford's allegations back in July. All she had to do was alert the FBI, so they could conduct the investigation Democrats now insist is so vital		#BrettKavanaugh
Frustrated by the way Senate Republicans are spinning the #BrettKavanaugh hearing?		Feinstein made it a LOT easier for them by sitting on the allegation for over a month. Whatever her motives, she really played into Republicans' hands.		Stupid.
All I can say is that Fr. Galvin (RIP) wouldn't have put up with this kind of angry disrespect from me when I was a Prep student. I'm quite sure he wouldn't have put up with it from #BrettKavanaugh		I don't see why Dem Senators should have to, either
@maggie_reardon Well, at least #BrettKavanagh didn't blame the whole thing on a conspiracy by the Clintons to get revenge		Oh, wait, he did

@maggie_reardon If I were Jeff Flake, I'd just say: You know what, let's end this farce. I'm not giving any more of my time to that nice prosecutor lady. No offense to her, but I can't vote out of Committee anyone who treats Senators so rudely		We're done. Let's move on to the next nominee ASAP
It's just hard to imagine that #BrettKavanaugh could be an angry or violent drunk. I mean, he's so calm and collected when sober.		🤔
#BrettKavanaugh keeps trying to turn Dem Senators' questions back on them: e.g.,"Have YOU ever had too many beers, Senator"?		Anyone keeping a list?		It's really remarkable. I've watched hundreds of hours of Congressional hearings and never seen anything like it
@RyanRadia @astepanovich Oh, wait. 15 years. Shit.		Just don't tell the boys who take me for 28
CORNYN: The burden is not on you to disprove the allegations		Actually, it kinda is. #BrettKavanaugh isn't being prosecuted. He's applying for a job and needs to demonstrate his good character.		@benjaminwittes already explained this:	https://t.co/w1AMA1UJUw
@astepanovich Sorry but I think you're asking the wrong guy:	1) I didn't play drinking games in high school (or get out much generally, TBH)	2) I attended 25 years later. Yes, it's possible such games could survive, but I wouldn't know if it had long outlasted BK
CORNYN: I can't think of a more egregious travesty of justice since the McCarthy hearings		Yeah, the Senate. America's great bulwark of decency. Which has stood up for decency and the Republic every day since Trump took office.		Yeah, right...		#BrettKavanaugh
Lindsey Graham to Dem Senators: "If you vote against #BrettKavanaugh, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I've seen in my entire career in politics"		Says DC's most shameless suckup to the most despicable person ever to serve as President, who jokes about sexual assault
#BrettKavanaugh shouting at Democratic Senators was pretty shocking		Somehow, it made @LindseyGrahamSC's shouting seem normal
#BrettKavanaugh started strong, but this is the moment when he started losing people: having said he was open to "anything" that would move his nomination forward, BK repeatedly refused to say whether he wanted, or would be open to, an FBI investigation into claims against him
@MollyZang @Judge_Kavanaugh I didn't mean it WAS his account. I meant, it looks "kinda official"
Whoever set up the @Judge_Kavanaugh account (which kinda appears official) is an idiot: the President doesn't "appoint" judges until the Senate provides "advice and consent"		#BrettKavanaugh has, thus far, only been "nominated"		Also, "#MAGA fan" on a SCOTUS nominee page? Ick. https://t.co/ANs34usz8e
This  #BrettKavanaugh hearing is heart-wrenching		In the end, I suppose it boils down to this: which of these possibilities is most likely? 🤔
Watching the testimony of #BretKavanaugh and #BlaseyFord, I'm vividly reminded of reading about the Chambers v Hiss testimony (about the pumpkin patch) in US History at Georgetown Prep ('97-98)		I assume Prep students will read about this hearing the same way for decades to come
What #BrettKavanaugh says about The Cupola (Georgetown Prep's yearbook) was certainly true in 1998 (when I graduated): the whole thing was intended to make everyone seem as cool and racy as possible. It was full of wild, juvenile exaggeration that, in hindsight, seems pathetic
RT @quinalty: Everything. Is. Terrible. https://t.co/dLkMKUxGy5
#BrettKavanaugh doesn't usually sound this wooden, monotone and angry, does he?		It's like Trump coached him on how to sound "strong"
I've always liked and respected Chuck Grassley as a fundamentally decent person		But... if Republicans wanted to run what is effectively a trial (rather than a job interview), having a non-lawyer play presiding judge probably wasn't the best idea		#BrettKavanaugh
I get it: standard hearing protocol alternates in 5 minute blocks between parties		But this hearing would be a lot more fair to Blasey Ford if Dems had just let Republicans consolidate their time for a sustained questioning of her by their prosecutor counsel		#BrettKavanaugh

Irving Kristol, for whom the award given to Johnson, would be horrified		Johnson's ugly demagoguery, bumbling incompetence, and Trump-level stupidity is only barely concealed by his accent, which seems to blind most Americans almost completely to the substance of any speaker

since the FTC's deception authority requires that statements be material to consumers, and the regulator-directed policy, by definition, could not possibly be material to consumer decision-making		Think of it as tariffs for privacy, minus second-guessing a la 201(b)		#FTChearings
Best #privacy idea at #FTChearings so far: require companies to have TWO "privacy" policies: one human-readable and necessarily unspecific for consumers, the other detailed, for regulators		But it WOULD require legislation, both to require that and to allow its enforcement....
Best #pun headline I've seen in ages https://t.co/NCdt0l3jHB
"Economists are really on top of how goodly or badly market concentration tells you that there is or is not competition within an industry"		#TrumpTalk at #FTChearings 		😱
@matthewstoller We could agree that attacking journalists, perverting law enforcement as a tool of political revenge, and all sorts of Nixonian, truly autocratic shit are bad, while respectfully disagreeing about industrial organization theory or antitrust doctrine		Or you could just call names
@matthewstoller Your "definition" makes it impossible to distinguish differences of opinion on econometric questions about market power and its abuse from the most profound moral questions of our day: like whether Trump has any respect for limitations on Executive power		THAT is the subject
@matthewstoller Ah, yes, the Boston Tea Party! Where the colonists rose up in protest to the prices charged by a purely private company on the free market!		Right, that didn't have anything to do with taxation or government-imposed monopolies on the importation of tea to the colonies. No siree!
@matthewstoller Okay... so Google and the Gulag Archipelago are basically the same thing		Got it. Moral clarity restored!
@matthewstoller If you can't distinguish between the abuse of market power (primarily, the ability to raise prices above competitive levels) and the ability to lock up political opponents, murder critics, keep a population in mass terror... you really have no moral authority to talk about Trump
@matthewstoller Wow		Well no wonder people ignored warnings about Trump: people like you have been crying wolf for years!		If every big corporation is "autocratic," the word has no meaning		Autocracy is, per any dictionary, "a system of government by one person with absolute power"
@matthewstoller So... are you going to explain your slander? Or are you just in the habit of labeling everyone you don't agree with as an "autocrat?"		My German great-grandfather was sent to Dachau for speaking out against REAL autocracy in 1933. So I've always taken the word VERY seriously
The core mission of the agency is to protect against fraud	- David Vladeck		Uh, well, secondarily. “Unjustified consumer injury is	the primary focus of the FTC Act,” as the Unfairness Policy Statement reminds us.		Deception is just the easiest subspecies of that		#FTChearings
Ironically, the companies who brought #antitrust complaints against Google were platforms that wouldn't exist if it weren't for Google	- David Vladeck (Obama-era BCP #FTC director)		A-yelp! 🤣		#FTChearings
Alysa Hutnik may be (ahem: is) completely, utterly wrong about Mariah Carey (at least Mariah Carey of the mid-90s) but she's right about the value in modernizing the Unfairness &amp; Deception Policy Statements		Provided we're talking about clarifying, not chucking, them	#FTChearings
We don't need to rewrite the Unfairness Policy Statement. It DOESN'T require mathematical precision or that injury be financial. It can cover lots of other harms to consumers' utility function, as in the Eli Lilly case	- Tim Muris		#FTChearings
The Bureau of Consumer Protection is much bigger than the Bureau of Competition in dollars and staffing, and when you go out and take questions as #FTC Chairman, you get a LOT more consumer protection questions than #antitrust	- Tim Muris		#FTChearings
@matthewstoller OK, I'll bite: why am I an autocrat?		(Since you don't know me, I'll assume you don't realize that I have been unrelenting in my daily criticism of Trump as an actual autocrat for the last three years)
@matthewstoller Are you talking about Jan McDavid or me?		And in case you hadn't noticed, she and I are both arguing that the last thing we should want is to dilute #antitrust standards so that Trump can use antitrust as a political weapon. Because, yes, he is actually an autocrat and will do so
@Econ_Marshall Did you fail to notice that I was quoting Jan McDavid (as @matthewstoller seems to have done, deleting his tweet to hide his mistake)? 		Or are you presuming to second-guess Jan's political self-description? She was a key Obama advisor on the FTC. Are you familiar with her bio? https://t.co/lskoI1QOJD
Rooting out impermissible motive is a very hard problem for the #FTC	- David Vladeck on discrimination by platforms		Yeah, even harder for courts to know whether #antitrust suits are motivated by Trump's petulance—which is why Hipster Antitrust =&gt; Gangster Antitrust		#FTChearings
#FTC needs a bureau of technology	- David Vladeck		Yeah, I said that in 2012: https://t.co/cp6ZeRgeoV		#FTChearings
If you only watch one speaker, watch Jan McDavid. Not only is her jacket AMAZING, but she said everything that needed to be said as a progressive against the stupidity of hipster antitrust: muddying the waters simply allows Trump to get away with gangster antitrust		#FTCHearings
Populism turns #antitrust law on its head, eg punishing lower prices as predatory pricing without proof of market power or penalizing large companies simply for being successful, and allowing politicized enforcement--a real threat in the current political environment	#FTCHearings
I'm a progressive Democrat, so you might think I'd cheer new populist antitrust, but I don't. It makes my job in advising companies harder because it replaces clear legal standards with we would be applying amorphous concepts of bigness and fairness...	- Jan McDavid		#FTCHearings
Most #antitrust enforcement takes place in board rooms, where lawyers like me counsel executives about where the lines of legal liability are. That works best if companies know the antitrust agencies are serious cops on the beat	- Jan McDavid		#FTChearings
THAT JACKET		😍😍😍		#FTChearings https://t.co/rMSGkrBChd
When the #FTC last held these hearings in 1990s... some of us might have had Mariah Carey on compact disc. 		Oh, I hope no one raised their hand for that.	- Alysa Hutnik 		Yeah, ok, she just lost all credibility 😡		#FTCHearings https://t.co/1zTPGoFzEE
@emetaz Uh, yeah, good luck running Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon or Microsoft on that model		I mean, getting users to help update encyclopedia entries is completely different from what those companies do
One hopes the #FTC will not get stuck in Groundhog Day, permanently stuck in 1975, when lawyers cautioned companies against innovation, cost-cutting and expansion, which created antitrust liability (thus hurting consumers)	-Tim Muris		#FTCHearings
Populism: Both left &amp; right are calling to use #antitrust to regulate leading tech/digital companies or make them public utilities. We've been down this road before Read my paper with Nuechterlein on the long war against A&amp;P:	https://t.co/y9LIMkvgmN	- Tim Muris		#FTCHearings
The #CFPB's abusiveness standard is a revival of the #FTC's paternalism and totally unchecked discretion of the 1970s.	Behavioral economic justifications aside, no economists assume that consumers have perfect information. It's a parody of economics.	- Tim Muris		#FTCHearings
Paternalism of the 1970s is back! #FTC sought to become the 2nd most powerful legislature in America. In a 15 month stretch, there was 1 major rulemaking/month aiming to remake US industries, including whether people with poor credit should buy color TVs	 -Tim Muris		#FTCHearings
@pab_PK @FTC @publicknowledge Great idea: instead of focusing on consumer welfare (like, say, lower prices), let's have the FTC to to maximize employment!

@brianlfrye Anyone who thinks Red Lion will (because.... it should) extend to the Internet is simply living in an alternative timeline of American constitutional law		Why would such views deserve ANY serious consideration?

@brianlfrye Since you're not an American lawyer, perhaps you aren't aware that broadcasting are the ONLY media in America not given the full protection of the First Amendment, under Red Lion (1969). I explain it all here: https://t.co/I7pit3nZUG		No way a Net FD would survive 1A review
@GaltsGirl And you know what? It's NONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS, PERIOD, END OF STORY		The First Amendment gives Facebook, Twitter, Google and all other private companies the right to do whatever the fuck they want		So this hearing shouldn't even be happening

@GaltsGirl @jack Twitter has been less than clear about this but it appears that the 600,000 accounts were shadow-banned because there were constellations of accounts following them and liking/resharing their content that were inauthentic (i.e., bots) or manually being used to promote them
@Jack also doesn't have the balls to explain that three Republican members of Congress (but no Dems) were among the 600,000 accounts shadow-banned because of suspicious patterns of behavior being used to promote their content because RUSSIAN BOTS WERE ONLY HELPING THE GOP https://t.co/Ifw7rVobg0
Twitter called her tweet "incendiary" because, presumably, they didn't want to state the truth: that she, like Carla Fiorini (who started this birtheresque conspiracy theory) was simply a liar

It's completely insane that Congress DOESN'T have a stable of in-house, non-partisan technical experts to draw upon, as it does for policy and legal questions via GAO and CRS, and even economic questions via the JEC

FPD isn't just any fire department: it's the only fire department in America suing the #FCC to reinstate #TitleII (filed back in February). The County Counsel filed FCC comments last December referencing the precise device at issue here.
Even if you take for granted everything the FPD alleges (in an appendix to Mozilla's lawsuit to reinstate #TitleII), this story just doesn't have anything to do with #netneutrality		But when you start digging deeper, you have to wonder what the FPD's lawyers were really up to...
The real issue here isn't public safety or even avoiding consumer confusion about service plans. It's price controls		That's always been the core of #TitleII 		Here, the implicit claim is that FPD should pay the same rate for using 75x more data (300GB) than the average user https://t.co/ixcOjEC2Ex
.@gigibsohn and others have claimed that the FCC could nonetheless have prohibited Verizon's service offering under the General Conduct Standard (even though the FCC said that standard was aimed at anti-competitive behavior)		She's not wrong, but, as I explain... https://t.co/uS4s7I8Wxu
This confusion may have been a customer service fail on Verizon's part (albeit one involving a generous, voluntary policy), but it's not a net neutrality issue		The FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order explicitly recognized that such plans are pro-consumer, and kept them legal https://t.co/XuIM04VPje
That misunderstanding led to a blowup in June/July when VZ's new customer service rep wasn't aware of the generous policy of suspending speed restrictions whenever gov't users claimed they were experiencing an emergency. He urged FPD to switch plans, as it should have done in Dec
FPD could have bought exactly the plan they needed: pay-as-you-go for 4G speeds, but apparently misunderstood, back in December, that Verizon was only TEMPORARILY suspending the speed restriction on their plan, not dropping it permanently...
SC's FPD simply chose a data plan for their mobile command and control unit (up to 25 GB/month with unlimited but slower speeds beyond that) that was manifestly inappropriate for their needs. The FPD needed a lot of high-speed 4G mobile data  (up to 300 GB/month of 4G data)
No, Verizon didn't "throttle" the Santa Clara fire department. I explain what really happened, why it wasn't a #netneutrality issue, how the #FTC could have dealt with what was really an issue of customer confusion, and the political agenda at play here: https://t.co/NCmmezOh4M

Of course we have to deal with China as a political reality, but we must never pretend that they are a normal country or that they have the moral standing to sit alongside US and EU regulators and talk about ensuring "user trust"		Silence from the audience is complicity
It should be obvious: China's new data protection rules are designed to maximize the discretion of the government to (a) favor domestic (politically pliable) tech companies and (b) gain leverage over foreign companies--in both cases, to control what Chinese can do and say online
How did we get to the point where a room full of Americans, in the safety and luxury of Aspen Colorado, no one else will call bullshit on such rank hypocrisy?		If we won't call them out, who will? Who will speak up for the human rights Chinese citizens?
Several people thanked me and said it "brave" to say something		It wasn't brave. It was merely awkward.		Brave is, say, Lam Wing-kee selling dissident books from Hong Kong into China and after disappearing for 8 months, giving a press conference to debunk the govt's account
No one else had the balls to point out the obvious: Chinese users can't "trust" that they won't be "disappeared" (murdered, tortured or sent to a labor camp) merely for speaking out or trying to spread "dangerous" information (say, the murders of protestors at Tiananmen Square)

Perhaps the saddest thing about this is that the WSJ actually printed this garbage		But you won't see me, or any other serious person, insisting on a "right of reply" (which the Supreme Court blocked in Miami Herald
Having incited his followers to MURDER those commemorating the murder of an innocent women by actual Nazis, and had his Twitter shut down briefly for it, Reynolds is now convinced that social media are out to get conservatives. Go figure.		Essentially, he's screaming Lügenpresse!
Reynolds doesn't mention his own experience with "censorship"		In 2016, Twitter (briefly) shut down his account after he urged his followers to RUN DOWN those peacefully protesting the death of a Charlottesville woman run over by a white supremacist		https://t.co/VlH4LmqD7N https://t.co/67Rt7QLzR1
One expects this kind of mindless partisanship, this populist ranting from our so-called President		But from a law professor who's supposed to be an intellectual titan of the right? This is simply shameful.
This is EXACTLY what the radical left does all the time. Conservatives used to attack them for it, reminding them that the First Amendment is a shield against government, not a sword by which government can advance anyone's notion of fairness or neutrality		But now...
Glenn's pulling a cheap rhetorical trick, eliding over the difference between actual constitutional, legal "free speech" issues and the way he'd like to see the world work (Alex Jones spewing bullshit about aliens and gay frogs, etc forever, apparently)
Having kinda-almost-but-not-really acknowledged that no court will ever find that anyone has a First Amendment right to an audience on Facebook/Twitter/YouTube, @Instapundit then goes on to claim that it's a "more general issue of free speech"		Uh, no. Not in any legal sense. https://t.co/5A1QNi7sVs
I debunked the idea that any court (let alone SCOTUS) will find that social media platforms are the new "corporate towns" in my testimony at April's House Judiciary Committee Maury-Povich-esque hearing with Diamond &amp; Silk	https://t.co/x6OG34xjOq
@Instapundit knows full well that the courts aren't going to designate social media platforms as public fora. It's a preposterous argument, once made only on the loony fringes of the media access Left. Yet he makes it sound like a real possibility. https://t.co/cCzo0aokwb

@bmuth 40 Llano del Norte, up on top of the mesa surrounded by BLM land!
@HankHultquist Dude. I was kidding.
Here's my testimony on why the government should butt out:	https://t.co/Djc5LDSMhX		(In case anyone actually gives a shit about the law or substance anymore)
That point was left to @TedLieu to make: it was a stupid hearing because there's nothing the government can do 		(Sadly, most other Committee Dems descended to trying to entrap Diamond and Silk in perjury charges over a $1000 airline ticket reimbursement by the Trump campaign)
Not a single Republican on the Committee would say what every Republican would have said in a hearing about, say, conservative dominance on talk radio: that the First Amendment bars ANY meddling with speech online, period. Or that "censorship" is something only governments do
(Never mind that Facebook had tried repeatedly to contact them to restore their page and that the real issue was their frustration in monetizing traffic after Facebook reduced traffic to ALL such pages)
Hence, April's farce of a Congressional hearing, with the House JUDICIARY Committee (the supposed experts in constitutional law) Republicans using Diamond &amp; Silk to wave the bloody shirt of "SILICON VALLEY CENSORING CONSERVATIVES"
You only have to rewind the tape about two years to see just how radical this this flip-flop was, with "limited government constitutionalists" 😂 embracing the radical 1960s Left's "Media Access Theory"		It's like the GOP's complete 180 on Russia, only about the Constitution
Republicans regularly reminded us that the First Amendment shields media, ALL media, against government meddling.		Yet now, Republicans are effectively demanding a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet, twisting the First Amendment into a guarantee for access to media
The hypocrisy is staggering: From 1949 through 2016, the GOP (rightly) decried the FCC's Fairness Doctrine, which, in theory, required political neutrality but actually merely served to discourage coverage of controversial issues and non-mainstream viewpoints, mainly the Right's
The sites conservatives hold up as examples of supposed bias are, in fact, blatant purveyors in conspiracy theories and other forms of bullshit, using click-bait headlines and other tactics increasingly disfavored by Facebook's algorithms
After carping about this for years and working themselves up into a frenzy over the last 6 months, Republicans have no hard evidence of anti-conservative bias—just anecdotes. In fact, ALL media pages have seen their traffic drop due to changes, especially of Facebook's algorithm
Trump has declared war against social media companies for censoring conservatives		Which is funny, because Twitter hasn't stopped him from using their platform to attack other users, incite violence, spew bullshit (to his 54 million followers) &amp; generally violate their TOS daily https://t.co/B7TnwwCuSu

@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud Your metric for success seems to be increasing the number of Congressmen with posters of Ayn Rand or Milton Friedman in their offices		Mine is the health of the Republic, defending the rule of law, checking the natural authoritarian tendencies of the Executive, etc		Bye, Felisha https://t.co/p36r7XVfB7
@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud What matters is that the House fulfills its constitutional duty to check the most lawless, unprincipled &amp; incompetent executive in modern American history (and arguably ever)		Only a Democratic house can do that		I'd love to keep GOP libertarians, but not if it means a GOP House

@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud I shouldn't be surprised by such ideological myopia and staggering moral blindness, coming from someone who works for an organization founded by Steve Moore		Yeah, what a hero for libertarian ideas! He's really done wonders for libertarianism inside the Trump administration!
@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud Dude. You think getting a few more people in Congress to talk about auditing the Fed or privatizing roads matters AT ALL right now?		Your ideological zealotry has blinded you to the illiberal nightmare that is Trumpism
@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud  https://t.co/43RzzlUlgy
@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud What point could be more fundamental than the rule of law -- which Trump diminishes more with each passing day?		Or that the "libertarian" Republicans in Congress have done precisely nothing about it?
@AndrewCFollett @SpeakerBoehner @MichaelJCloud Let me guess: your idea of "libertarian leaning" is opposing free trade, bloating the deficit, attacking the rule of law at every turn, putting children in cages and generally applauding while Trump replaces the rule of law with personal attacks on truth, his enemies &amp; the press?
