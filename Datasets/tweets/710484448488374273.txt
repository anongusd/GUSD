@markyftw I won’t have to, because it’ll never exist. I would hope we’d achieve ACTUAL socialism before we’d ever get to a point like that, otherwise we’d be living in a serious mindfuck of a world.
@markyftw Yeah, good luck being “absolutely against taxes” as well 🙄
@markyftw NOTHING to do with whether or not I’m a socialist, despite your gatekeeping malarkey.
@markyftw If it were up to me, yes, I would fund a national health care system  with the revenue that already exists, bump up tax rates on the rich so it’ll never go insolvent, and at the same time reduce the military/defense budget to essentially $0.		And all of that would have exactly
@markyftw I actually went even further to say that there’s a virtual guarantee that it WILL be spent on that. My point is, the fact that the money will likely be spent in that way is not in itself a reason not to want the money to be spent in the way I want it to be spent.
@markyftw Yeah, that’s a very charitable and sincere argument
@markyftw No, that’s not a counterargument either. There is a guarantee that some or most of that money won’t be spent on what I want, but that’s no reason to *oppose* raising taxes for that purpose. 🙄
@markyftw lol not really, but even granting that, it’s hardly a counterargument in itself.
@markyftw 🤷‍♀️ I can’t speak for anyone else, but my argument would be that we should tax rich people so that poor people don’t have to die from lack of shelter or health care. It’s effectively removed from communist aims, and it’s just common sense.
@markyftw I don’t think anybody makes that argument lol

@SManSpeaks Sure, there’s always SOME wiggle room. That doesn’t validate the “negotiating table” dynamic existing in the first place lol		We will debate this in depth at a later time 👍
@SManSpeaks Until the table goes away, you really don’t have much of a choice. But why should we just accept that negotiation dynamic in the first place?		That’s probably a good place to center our future discussion around tbh.
@markyftw No
@LynelsAreCops @SManSpeaks Cuba is just meh. Not the biggest fan, personally
@SManSpeaks Ahh, but you take the negotiation table itself for granted. My contention is that it shouldn’t even exist. 😜

@SManSpeaks As a wage laborer I am forced to compete in a job market against my fellow workers to commodify my labor power and sell it at the lowest price, or else I can’t be secure in my income, let alone my life. 		If that’s not the strongest form of compulsion short of slavery, I’m not
@SManSpeaks I mean look, you may think it’s fine to be forced to do these things, but you can’t deny that they are in fact compulsory. 		Should we add this topic to our upcoming debate? 😜
@markyftw I always do

@SManSpeaks I implore to try avoiding working for money when you grow up, and then tell me how long you last before you’re forced to go get a job. You will DIE trying not to work for money.		At any rate, wage labor =/= simply working for money, it’s more complicated than that. A CEO “works”

My next show is in 5 days and I am totally unprepared lol as usual
@SManSpeaks It is, and obviously there’s a spectrum of unfairness. Slavery, for example, is extremely unfair. Wage labor is less unfair, but still unfair nonetheless. Also, it’s not just an isolated instance of unfair treatment, it’s literally built into the fabric of our society lol
@SManSpeaks Treating people unfairly in order to reap the gains of their labor is “not so bad.” Thank you for clearly articulating the underlying assumptions of capitalism lol

@TheLawyerbot @SManSpeaks No, I won’t let it happen
@SManSpeaks the police?
@SManSpeaks I don’t really know what more I can say then, lol. If they’re not irredeemable, you may as well just say they “need reform” instead of calling them domestic terrorists. Or if you’re going to insist that they are terrorists in need of reform, at least grant the same courtesy to
@SManSpeaks And this isn’t even to mention the fact that they are some of the most prominent functionaries of the war on drugs, which is an obvious violation of the most basic principles of morality. That alone is enough to have a debate about whether or not it qualifies as terrorism.
@SManSpeaks than BLM could ever dream of.
@SManSpeaks Why is BLM an irredeemable terrorist organization, but the police department simply “needs reform?” Are you aware of the NYPD’s history of extortion and police brutality? They are responsible for more violence and intimidation (for ostensibly political motives, in many cases)
@SManSpeaks Also, if that's the totality of your credible evidence, I must rest my case and allow people to come to their own conclusions lol
@SManSpeaks I'm just trying to apply YOUR standard of terrorism to the NYPD lol are you asking for examples of the NYPD living up to that standard?
@SManSpeaks act as a terrorist. Whether you can say that about those religions is debatable, but with BLM, it's just obviously not the case.
@SManSpeaks I mean, I'm only being half-serious with the atheism example lol but my point is that whether or not they did it "in the name of" their organization, that's basically irrelevant to me. What matters to me is whether or not the organization on the whole provides a solid impetus to
@SManSpeaks police officers?
@SManSpeaks So, just to get this right, you are willing to condemn an entire organization as "terrorist" with no credible evidence that they're committed to any real violence or intimidation, beyond the chanting of obscenities in a viral video and some isolated incidences of violence against
@SManSpeaks So most religions in general are terrorist organizations, then? Certainly Christianity and Islam at the very least?		And why not atheism? There are plenty of atheist mass murderers, especially when you account for state-sanctioned violence!
@SManSpeaks (2/2) describing the entire organization as one that is devoted to terrorism. Again, by that logic, the NYPD is a terrorist organization (and hey, I don't entirely disagree 😏).
@SManSpeaks (1/2) lol neither you nor I are in a position to be the arbiter of these people's intentions, as long as all they're doing is chanting obscenities. To the extent that BLM members are killing cops, it's obviously quite infrequent, and at any rate, it's hardly a pretext for
@SManSpeaks Also, even if this DID qualify as terrorism, that wouldn't be enough to define the whole enterprise as a "terrorist organization." By that logic, the Islamic religion in its entirety must also be a terrorist organization, right?
@SManSpeaks In what way was BLM unlawfully using violence or intimidation by saying those things? 		Also, if that's your standard for terrorism, every major police department in this country is quite clearly a bigger and more serious terrorist organization than BLM could ever dream of being.
@SManSpeaks That's not terrorism. Sorry, try again.
@BluePillWhite Wonderwall is just ok
@SManSpeaks What is the evidence of that?
@SManSpeaks This is pretty outrageous hyperbole, SMan lol I have plenty of problems with them also, but they’re not a “terrorist organization.”

@NickBalis3 I’m saying that if you believe “decision-making” is the primary factor determining economic success in our society, then your belief is *despite* the evidence at hand, and does not follow from it.
@NickBalis3 I literally can’t believe your takeaway from this conversation is that it’s my belief that people don’t have agency. Like, I understand WHY you think that’s what I believe, but you’re just... so far afield from what I’m actually saying lol

@NickBalis3 Or at least, it is solid empirical evidence against your assertion. Again, I’m still waiting for the empirical evidence that supports your claim. 		The problem is you can’t produce any, because there isn’t any, because it’s a lazy, piss-poor explanation of inequality.
@NickBalis3 It literally does, but okay lol
@NickBalis3 lean on the “life decisions” argument, but as I’ve pointed out several times now, that only begs the question of why people of certain races are more likely to make “better” decisions than other races. It’s not an explanation of ANYTHING.
@NickBalis3 There are a multitude of factors (many of which I simply don’t know by heart), but you’re not being particularly clever by asking. Asians do not have the same experience as blacks and Hispanics, and are thus not marginalized in the same ways. I can just *feel* your affinity to
@NickBalis3 lol sorry, but I’m not gonna let you get away with claiming things you have no evidence for. I’ve shown you data that clearly addresses the “poor choices” argument, and digging your heels in to double down on that claim won’t get you anywhere with me.
@NickBalis3 *sitting, still waiting for empirical evidence that supports this claim*
@NickBalis3 Again, all of this is addressed in the article I sent you in DMs. There is literally no point in continuing this conversation if you’re not even going to seriously consider the evidence that goes against your arguments.
@NickBalis3 I’ll just sit here and keep waiting for the empirical evidence that supports that claim.
@NickBalis3 does it have to do with the socioeconomic conditions in which people have to make the decisions they make? The former seems to be a rather racist presumption, and the latter actually had a mountain of evidence supporting it, which you have refused to seriously address.
@NickBalis3 racial inequality that exists in our society. Even if you want to ascribe that inequality to “poor decision making”, it begs the question, why do POC tend to make “poorer” decisions? Is there just something inherent about black people that makes them worse “decision makers”? Or
@NickBalis3 Re: the data I’ve provided, what is your evidence that racial inequality is better ascribed to poor decisions than systemic discrimination? Further, I don’t think you realize the corner you’ve backed yourself into with that answers. “Poor choices” is not an explanation of the
@NickBalis3 their lack of success*, that is
@NickBalis3 Also, the odds are that this hypothetical person’s skin color, religion, physical capability, etc. are not the primary factors contributing to their success, but that only serves to emphasize the utility of class analysis in having these discussions.
@NickBalis3 Nobody denies that this is true lol it’s just that every bit of evidence suggests that this USUALLY is not the case, and that there is actually a trend in the opposite direction.
@NickBalis3 still stands.
@NickBalis3 1. Your submission, I’m sorry to say,  flies in the face of the great bulk of the evidence, and I’ve privately provided you with the data that demonstrates this. 		2. Again, I’m not really so interested in nitpicking about semantics. Use whatever word you want, but my point
@NickBalis3 , doesn’t mean the trend doesn’t exist.
@NickBalis3 person during Jim Crow? No, it just means your life is harder due to things you didn’t choose and are fortunate to be able to control in anyway. But then, some disabled people have less of an ability to control their impairments, and just because your disability is not as severe
@NickBalis3 be “marginalization.” I’m not gonna sit here and nitpick about the definition of the word, but the fact is that your life and ability to succeed is/was probably made at least somewhat more difficult by your disability. Does that mean your life is perfectly analogous to a black
@NickBalis3 1. Exceptions to the rule changes neither the rule, nor the conditions which enforce the rule. Obviously POC can be successful, but they generally face more obstacles as a result of their race than a white person would. 		2. At that point, it just depends on what you consider to
This is all true, but I’m mostly just retweeting because “Dick Spencer” gave me a good giggle 🤭 https://t.co/hVcQfD2bZH
function as you would if you didn’t have that disability.
1. POC aren’t “inherently” marginalized (whatever that means), they’re marginalized as a function of the system in which they’re living. 		2. If you’re disabled, but you have access to treatment, you’re still marginalized insofar as that treatment doesn’t suffice to allow you to https://t.co/Md2xmpo0Ju

@SManSpeaks (1/2) I’m unaware of any view Beto holds that would substantially distinguish him from a standard liberal, or even most moderate Democrats. As for the thing about labels, there is obviously some middle ground between dogmatically attaching yourself to an ideology/label and ...
@SManSpeaks I simply disagree that Beto is "probably a progressive" lol if it was self-evident that he was, why would he shy away from the label? He wouldn't be able to avoid the label, if that were the case.
@SManSpeaks Look, I don’t care what word he uses to describe himself. But insofar as he explicitly rejects that specific label, it’s a safe bet that he doesn’t stand for what I stand for. I don’t view it as problematic in the slightest that progressives’ standards are higher than him.

,  but myths with no other depth than that of human suffering and, like it, inexhaustible. Not the divine fable that amuses and blinds, but the terrestrial face, gesture, and drama in which are summed up a difficult wisdom and an ephemeral passion."		~ Albert Camus
"Outside of that single fatality of death, everything . . . is liberty. A world remains of which man is the sole master. What bound him was the illusion of another world. The outcome of his thought, ceasing to be renunciatory, flowers in images. It frolics -- in myths, to be sure

There is a lot more to Joyce’s life story than just those few years leading up to her death. By all accounts she was a beautiful, intelligent, and kind-hearted woman with a knack for socialization. But the last years of her life teach us that she was also intensely fearful of https://t.co/hIIG9Pr8aG

Another contemporary of his that I forgot, but who was also a comparably skilled virtuoso was Ritchie Blackmore, who is often held in higher regard tbh
https://t.co/EOKle6XU28		Listen to that fucking solo. Who in popular music had written anything that sounded anything even remotely like that before?
But I find Randy’s licks/melodic phrases and even his riffs to be way more interesting and tasteful than any of those other guys, and I would go as far as to say he basically invented the modern metal guitar solo.
I feel like Randy Rhoads is an extremely underrated guitarist. Pretty much everything good about Ozzy’s early solo music can be attributed to him, and he was essentially the leading virtuoso in rock/metal at that time, besides Eddie Van Halen and maybe the guys from Iron Maiden.

@HUMANe_Mind @SManSpeaks @NickBalis3 Okay, but you’re not actually achieving anything with this reductio ad absurdum.

@HUMANe_Mind @NickBalis3 @SManSpeaks Again, all of this could be clarified and would be better suited for a direct conversation between us (especially so I wouldn’t have to type all this out at work lol) When you’re willing to have it, let me know. Until then, let’s just drop it, yeah?

@HUMANe_Mind @SManSpeaks @NickBalis3 first place.
@HUMANe_Mind @SManSpeaks @NickBalis3 No, you’re misunderstanding me. I’m saying your interpretation of my view is equally as absurd to me as it is to you, that’s all.

@HUMANe_Mind @NickBalis3 @SManSpeaks I view it as an unintended consequence of what they actually do want. 		This should not have needed to be stated explicitly.
@HUMANe_Mind @NickBalis3 @SManSpeaks See, now you’re just putting words in my mouth. I never said they wanted to kill everyone on the planet. My point was that the policies they want to pursue may well end up destroying us all, or at least or democracy. Obviously they don’t consciously *want* to destroy everything,
@HUMANe_Mind @SManSpeaks @NickBalis3 Again, I am willing to debate that with you any time you want, just let me know. I view what you’re saying to me right now as equally absurd as your interpretation of what I’m saying. This would all be a lot easier if we just talked it through instead misrepresenting each other.
@HUMANe_Mind @NickBalis3 @SManSpeaks It may just be that you’re making a horribly uncharitable interpretation of what I actually believe. As I said, I don’t have time to clarify with any sort of depth right now, but I’d love to discuss it with you whenever you should find the time.

Update: just found them 👍
around this dynamic behind the game I’m playing with myself, but I suppose the struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart, yeah? 🤷‍♀️ 		Anyway, yeah. That’s my Monday morning. And I still haven’t found my glasses. 😕
self-destructive part of me tends to commingle nicely with the anger which drives the self-destructive thoughts and impulses in the first place, to the point where I’m left drowning in a whitewater river of undirected rage and anxiety and hopelessness. As yet, I’ve found no way
converts itself to, “Why are you even wasting your time? You should have just killed yourself a long time ago”, “You’re a petulant child and everyone would be better off without your stupid whiny bullshit”, etc. 		And the anger with which I’m used to confronting that more
about how I’m channeling that anger, I’m making a concerted effort not to throw or punch or kick things around me. The problem is, I have no idea how to do that without viciously redirecting that anger toward myself. The more I try not to destroy things, the more that rage
trying to alleviate, and I can honestly say I’ve made a lot of progress. I really don’t try to break things when I’m livid anymore, I can usually contain myself.		But sometimes I’ll have a massive blowup — as was the case just moments ago — and because I’m trying to be careful
that don’t belong to me, which is a major problem. One time I put two craters in my bedroom door (at my stepfather’s house), one with my fist, and one with my knee. Almost knocked the damn thing straight off the hinges. 		This is a problem that I’ve invested a lot of energy into
When I get excessively angry, I am often “outwardly” or “physically” angry. In other words, I take my rage out on the things around me. I’m very much a smasher/puncher/etc in that respect. 		Given that I’ve never had my own place, that leaves me impelled to destroy things
I’ve never heard anyone say that it is, but okay.		On the other hand, mental illnesses can exacerbate the conditions which might lead to hatred, or to hateful actions. https://t.co/uAq5RcnYyP
I’m actually really fucking upset over this. There are very few things that get under my skin more than not being able to find something that I’m looking for. When you throw in the fact that I can’t see anything, it just makes me fucking livid. &gt;___&gt;
