It has been the highest honor of my life serving the state I love as your Congressman the past 8 years. Hoosiers are the best of Americans, and we have Indiana’s very best in our district. Thank you!

My full statement on funding the border wall: 	https://t.co/zpYmib7rLZ
.@realDonaldTrump made a promise to build the border wall. I made a similar promise: an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and protect our country, and that’s why I will vote on any spending bills that properly continue fixing our border security, including an effective wall.
To my squishy Republican and Democrat friends, if you don’t think that the border wall is the highest priority now, if you don’t think our citizens' safety and the rule of law are of the utmost importance, nothing else should matter.

It's time for the Senate to put petty politics aside and confirm my friend and former colleague Director Mike Pompeo to Secretary of State. He possesses the diplomatic skills and understands the complex threats from abroad. Hoosiers agree, his swift confirmation is needed now.

It is an honor to have @taxreformer officially endorse the CRUMBS Act. We are both dedicated to helping middle-class Americans who have benefited from @POTUS’s historic tax cuts. Read full endorsement here: https://t.co/9tE7acNm8H
It is a $1.3 trillion spending bill littered with concessions to liberal Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. This is not what Hoosiers elected us to do and is what the American people despise about Congress.
It doesn't defund sanctuary cities, it doesn't defund abortion provider Planned Parenthood, and it fails to fund an effective wall.
This Omnibus is the Washington swamp at its worst. Once again, leadership in Congress has failed President @realDonaldTrump and the American people by forcing us to vote on a $1.3 trillion bill that no one could have read.

Over 20,000 new jobs to Indiana and an after-tax income boost of $2,468 for Middle-Class Hoosiers. #TaxReform is a big win
Tax reform is about every Hoosier. It’s about reforming a system that has taken advantage of the American people and making it so you get to keep more of your hard earned money.  #TaxReform

By repealing the individual mandate, we are giving the people choice and saving $338 billion in taxpayer dollars.  The government never should have required the American people to purchase healthcare. That is not their job.
Obamacare is one of the most insidious pieces of legislation and it continues to damage Hoosiers every day.
Elimination of the Medical Device Excise Tax means helping Hoosiers keep their jobs, and it also means the door for medical innovation remains open.
Medical device companies in Indiana generate more than $10 billion in economic output annually and they employ more than 20,000 Hoosiers. These same companies spend millions of dollars researching new ways to improve healthcare for our country and the entire world.

The administration must now focus on the execution of the order. It must be implemented fairly and effectively.
In 2011, President Obama issued a similar order with no controversy. President Trump is placing America’s national security first.
The safety of the American people is at stake, we must get this right. The President's call for extreme vetting is a step in that direction.
The President’s order regarding immigration is not a ban on Muslims. It is a pause to make sure our vetting system is working.

Under ObamaCare deductibles are up 15 percent for the least expensive plans. People are paying more before insurance starts.
Today, developing new drugs costs over $2.5 billion and takes 14 years – costs passed on to patients.
ObamaCare has imposed $500 billion in new taxes that stifle innovation and investment.
60% of physicians have said that the ACA has had a negative impact on the care patients receive.
25% of people have reported that ObamaCare has personally hurt them.
Deductibles are up under ObamaCare. Deductibles for individual plans in the employer-sponsored market are up 60% since 2010.
Obamacare promised insurance premiums would decline $2500 per family – they’re up $4300 instead.
