I thought BO's election was supposed to usher in a new era of peace and love among our European betters? Apparently not: http://is.gd/oY8r.
no power at home. sitting in drive waiting 4 joe cuz i dont have a key.
Have kind of ignored Twitter for the last two weeks. Sorry.
Classy:http://is.gd/lXpN. + there was the return of the Churchill bust and the less-than warm reception. Way to diss our best allies, Barry.
RT @Radioblogger: Parker Bros prints $15,140/set of Monopoly, 250m games over 77 yrs, or $3.785T. BHO will have spent $2T more by this June.
@JimDeMint Congrats on winning the amendment - I hope it can stick!
My head is just about ready to explode.
@Politzania - I was thinking about that, too.  I probably won't, though - not enough time.
I love Stu Varney.
I wonder if I'll be able to avoid Barry's gloom and doom (what happened to "hope"?) speech tonight but still catch Jindal's response.
RT @Radioblogger: would have loved to see eric cantor stand up and recommend an easy way to cut $1.2T from deficit spending/nat'l debt.
Joe Biden's on the case!  Boy, is THAT a relief.
So, NOW we're going to "pay as we go"? AFTER the $1T Generational Theft Act? Good luck with that one, Barry.
Wow. These shoes are super comfortable. I wonder if I can find more - these were clearance at DSW and I got 'em for $21 (down from $70!)
Does anyone know how to contact NRCC to look into House pickups? I think my district (D) is now vulnerable w/changing demos. #hhrs #tcot
@Radioblogger I'm in Phoenix.
I'm just milling about, waiting for the Dementor 2 leave. I'm OOO till next Fri, so I don't want 2 start anything. So I've got nothing 2 do.
@hughhewitt 135 is better than I've ever bowled. #hhrs
Awesome: RT @michellemalkin: Whoa. Gregg withdraws Commerce nom over stimulus and Census Bureau power grab.
RT @stix1972: RT @foxnews: POLITICS: GOP Threatens Legal Action Against Obama for Plan to Oversee 2010 Census http://tinyurl.com/b6 ...
Pelosi's "factsheet" on the porkulus conf report is out. “There are no earmarks or pet projects.” Delusional, much?
Ten to one the Dementor avoids talking to me for the rest of the day.
RT @michellemalkin: Holy $%^@!!! True cost of porkulus via CBO & @heritage: $3.27 trillion. http://tinyurl.com/bqly5k #tcot #stimulus
RT @michellemalkin: 'membr when Mrs. Obama sneered at $600 rebate chex? Wondr when she'll sneer at hubby's measly $13/wk tx cuts?
If I don't know that something that is identical to everything else is actually different, why would I think to ask a question about it?
RT @jamesbregenzer: Good news: Octuplets' mom launches new Web site soliciting public donations http://is.gd/jbt8
Know what I find funny on the Newsweek cover? The 2 top titles that run together: "The Blackberry President - Quitting the Thug Life" #tcot
RT @michellemalkin: A reader sent me a great idea: Send Schmucky a bag of pork rinds. http://bit.ly/BT3l http://bit.ly/i9My #tcot #stimulus
Obama: There is no pork in this bill!  Schumer: Yeah, and people don't care about it, anyway! #tcot
A-ha!  I can make my ENTIRE scope of work an "AutoText" - while not totally automated, it'll cut down on a lot of effort finding it.
I wonder if there's something like Excel's "VLOOKUP" command in Word?
Huh. Specter didn't know about the healthcare thing before he voted for the porkulus. Big surprise there.
Going to look for a playpen or similar at lunch, since I can't sit her down & know that she'll still be where I left her any more.
RT @Radioblogger: if george w. bush gives this press conference word for word, he loses 15 points in the polls within 49 hrs.
@Conservative67 to reply, type an "@" in front of the user's name. Or mouseover post and click the arrow to the right.
After reading comments, thank God I've decided not to listen to BHO in full, but only filtered through the calming lens of real articulation
Absolutely disgusted with Collins, Snowe, and Specter.  Specter's up for election in 2010, isn't he? Maybe Rick Santorum would run...  #tcot
This part of the porkulus is SCARY. http://is.gd/iVPN You think it's tough getting ins co's to pay, just wait till it's the govt's job #tcot
Hooray!  Rush is back!  I thought he wasn't supposed to be back till tomorrow!
This isn't so much coffee as hot brown water.
@michellemalkin - what's the over/under on how long till Barry does that with his BlackBerry? #tcot
Why didn't anyone tell my that the front of my shirt is covered with random flug?
Boy, we could really use the Gipper now... #rrbday
Robert Gibbs is the MOST AWESOME PRESS SECRETARY EVER.
I heard last night that the last Prez to enter office with popularity #s like Barry's was...Jimmy Carter. This gives me "hope.".
@michellemalkin - look on Geithner's face says "Holy crap! I got confirmed! Now what the heck am I supposed to do?!"
Now, THIS is a funny pic: http://is.gd/igij. Btwn look on Geithner's face, Janet cupping her boobs, & presence of Daschle, it's priceless.
Daschle withdraws!  COOL!
Okay - this site's logo is either really unfortunate, or deliberate: http://is.gd/ieVx. Either way, I don't think I'd use them.
I heard that Judd Gregg (R-NH), Barry's nom for Commerce Secy, actually voted to abolish the Commerce Dept. Can't ask for better than that!
There ARE 2 Americas: those of us who pay our taxes, and Obama appointees. No wonder they're for raising taxes on the rich - THEY don't pay!
Gary Sinise is really an inspirational guy.
I think I gained four pounds yesterday.  Oof.
God, I hate her.
Why does any one mall require not one but two stores dedicated to the sale of hair straightening irons?
@Politzania Zack thinks that Catherine's toys are rightly his. He's managed to destroy two, so far. I fear for the bear my brother got her.
Blago - out! Now it's going to get fun...
I have to look up Frederick's of Hollywood corporate address for an actual business reason. What are the chances the website will be NSFW?
Non-diet lunch today-trying to decide what it'll be. Also have 2 take digital cable box in-it decided that turning on was no longer its job.
@Politzania My old machine has a floppy drive.  Maybe I'll fire it up.  Seems like a lot of trouble for old public domain games, though.
@Politzania-I need to do that, too. Specially since new machine doesn't have room 4 a floppy drive. I've always meant 2 burn 'em to CD, tho.
@vz9p57 That reminds me - I need to re-watch Wanted and send it back.
Going to Bookman's at lunchtime to try to unload some superfluous media.  I don't know what I'll do if they don't take it.
@Radioblogger-only 94 Senators in the Geithner vote. Even if the ten GOP vote against, it's 50-44 - Biden doesn't even have to get involved.
I really want some Chinese food.
@vz9p57 I went with California Pizza Kitchen.
What do I want for lunch?
@Lileks - re: "Kiss my grits" - that's the second "Alice" reference I've seen online in the last two hours.
@MattLewis01 Apparently, there wasn't a similar "pants on in the Oval Office" rule, or Clinton wouldn't have had that Monica problem.
I wonder how many "Dissent is the highest form of patriotism" bumper stickers have been removed from cars today?
On the plus side-new AZ gov! On the not-so-plus side, now Arizona's problems are the nation's, & Janet doesn't even have anyone to write to.
Gotta love the market's confidence in the new regime.
@Radioblogger Much, much less.  I'm ready to curl up in the fetal position and whimper till it's all over. #hhrs
@PhillipErickson I'm doing my best to avoid all coverage, too.  It's tough - I'm normally a wall-to-wall talk radio girl.
2 of 3 days this week I went to feed Catherine & she wasn't interested. I think that means I can stop going. Time to start the jobhunt!
@Politzania Diff't sport, but I think she could hold her own against the best. (Oddly 1 of her teethers is a bee. Not quite bat, but close.)
Major league teething last night.  Up five times.
@michellemalkin - You can find that bumper sticker on rightwingstuff.com.
What do I want for lunch?
Right on, Hugh - go Cardinals! #hhrs
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
Does anyone else find it rude that, in an office served by 1 microwave, the Dementor brought in a lunch that took 15 minutes to heat up?
Damn.  Forgot how to make Adobe CS3 work, and *.nfo file doesn't work.  Gotta fire up the old machine, I guess.
@Radioblogger I like the part where he tells us to think of what's best for our kids, not ourselves. Seems it's oceans of crushing govt debt
@vz9p57 Awesome! An Airplane! reference!
How is saddling future generations with oceans of debt the best thing for our children?
Overcoming "the same narrow partisanship"? That's why Pelosi's changing Congress' fairness rule-it's less partisan when the GOP is excluded.
Yeah, it'll be free of earmarks.  Because the whole thing is just one GIANT earmark.
"Some people might be skeptical"?  Yeah, you could say that.
Why is KFYI broadcasting Obamessiah's complete lack of understanding of the role of government?  Why can't I listen to my regular program?
@hughhewitt - "Vicious Aloysius" was a fave of yours?! Wow. She scared the crap out of most of us (I had her for sophomore honors bio).
I'm so glad our landlord is working so hard to get the giant drafty gap next to my desk fixed.  ::freezing::
Hmm. LJ not responding. This is double-plus ungood.
The Witch has a new nickname - she's a Dementor (Harry Potter)-sucks the joy out away. We just need to figure out how to cast a Patronus...
Some guy on the Medved show just opined that Jews killed J.Lennon because they thought he was the 2nd coming & covered it up w/Chapman hoax.
In the spirit of preparing for the worse and hoping for the best, I've joined FaceBook in case LJ tanks. I'm Julie Dailey of Phoenix, there.
Way to pull defeat from the jaws of victory there, OSU.  Sigh.
What is the matter with people that they would actually vote for Al Franken for anything?
@Politzania - dunno. Joe's working on it. But if we have to go through the ROC recovery filing process, it could take another YEAR.
::cries:: Our pool was dug a year ago. It's got about three days worth of work to be finished. Today, we learned the pool co. is going OOB.
A note to my local Borders store: A little balance in your presentation of Obama books would be welcome. Not everyone is a fan.
Hmm.  Sir Charles arrested in Scottsdale for DUI.  This may put a crimp in his planned Alabama Senate run...
Hey!  Unexpected four-day weekend!  Woo-hoo!
Heh. Senate Dems say they won't seat Blago's choice. Let's see if they keep to that.
So Blago actually makes the nom, huh?  Interesting.
Why do companies insist on naming themselves things like "Melt" or "Sold It on eBay" that you can't really search on?
Wow. Did a search for "Sneak Jeans," the parent company of a store at one of our malls. I wasn't expecting the results to be QUITE so NSFW.
I could probably come up with 100 things I'd rather be doing than working right now.
Sarah Brightman concert land night.  Glorious.  God, I love her.
You know, if Blago fights and wins and appoints the Senator after all, that's a pretty good change at a pickup for the GOP in 2010.
The Witch left early.  And a strange calm filled the land.
What could be better than Christmas cookies for breakfast?
I get to go have my gums probed again today!  Whee!
Catherine thinks my jingle bell necklace is the Best Toy Ever.  At least for today.
@radioblogger $0.20 cheaper here in Phoenix.  Filled my tank for less than $25. Trying to think of other ways to use gasoline, now.
I'm sure glad Memorex keeps their customer service "48 hour response" commitment.
Back at work.  Still have the sore throat, but not agonizing. My hair is just enormous.
Cepacol numbing lozenges seem like a good idea until you realize that it's your tongue that's getting numb.
Voice totally useless.  Feel cruddy.  Still at work, but for how long?
When your entire office is sick, your sore throat and cough don't get much sympathy.
I have 1/2 a mind to cut the top off my McCain/Palin bumpersticker after his weasely comments. Kinda like on the old VW bug I saw recently.
My new computer is on the truck on its way to my house!
I'd really like to be able to watch "Prince Caspian" tonight. Alas, Memorex Blu-Ray player more of a brick than a home theatre component.
@hughhewitt RE: Tribe. Boy, I sure hope so. After the debacle that was last season, I sure need some positive news!
@radioblogger Not just not believable - absolutely incredible! He doesn't have a single friend in the mainstream.
I'm SO out of here at 4:00.
@PhilipErickson Note: I was never a member, thank goodness, but I did have to deal with them every day.
@PhilipErickson - I worked with the UAW. These are not the smartest folks in the world.
Why are my sinuses trying to kill me?
Boy, this beef stroganoff sure is good.
I was just praised because I knew that it would be more efficient to enter this data in the Access table instead of the form.
I need a new job.  I didn't get my MBA to do data entry.
@Radioblogger Oh, wait!  I know who he'll appoint!  Al Franken!  He came so close, OBVIOUSLY, he deserves it!
My brother wants range ammo for Christmas.  I say nothing says "Holiday Spirit" like the gift of lead!
@Radioblogger I say himself - Senators can't be impeached, but Governors can!
If my husband gets me a Pajama Gram, I'll be seriously annoyed.
Am I the only one who's amused that CNN is advertising on Fox News?
GASP!  The Governor of Illinois is CORRUPT!  Who knew?
Does anyone know what the going rate is for babysitting?
@hughhewitt "Uncle Ron" Karrenbauer thought highly of you & mentioned you a few times - I made the connection when I heard about your show.
Catherine has teeth!  Two of 'em!
@hughhewitt Hugh - graduated in 1987.  First heard YOUR name in 1985.  :-)
@hughhewitt Hey, Hugh - Warren JFK Grad, here in Phoenix, devoted fan of your show (& the Indians). Glad to find you!
Does anyone actually ever buy anything from spammers offering cheap meds?
What wouldn't I give to have a job that isn't completely mind-numbing?
I was just forced to come face to face with Ted.  Ugh.
Went to Sears to have Christmas pictures taken last night.  Catherine was just as cute as could be.
The Nutrisystem egg frittata is actually pretty darn good.
I swear I had yogurt when I got in this morning.
LiveJournal down. Twitter down for a while.  I was cast adrift...
Mongolian Barbecue for lunch today!
Geez.  The Witch is on the rampage today.
Somehow, all of my pants are suddenly too short.
http://twitpic.com/ljee - Hey, Poli - check out who just moved into the office next door!
My hands are FREEZING.  Stupid door.
I need a nap.
@Politzania Voted Early - Glad I did, too.  I drove by my polling place and the line was winding around the neighborhood.
What kind of stupid mosquito bites on the back of the finger?  There's no blood supply there!
My hand is getting calloused from schlepping the baby carrier around.
Absolutely furious.  I thought Ted was a micro-manager - he's hands-off compared to this witch.
Joe's out of town till late tonight.  Maybe I'll have artichokes for dinner.  Yum!
Uninstalling the trial version of Acrobat Pro.  It sends its tentacles everywhere, and I can't do anything till it's finished.
I just got an e-mail from someone who spelled "definitely" "deffenitly".  Yikes.
I just dripped a big dollop of yogurt into my cleavage.
Training.  Whee!  This is super-exciting stuff, folks.  I guess it's better than work, though.  Sigh.
@Politzania Good to hear!  Glad it wasn't more serious.
I get Friday off - whee!  Of course, I'll probably be home all day waiting for the pool inspector, but still, I won't be here, and that' ...
@Politzania - Bummer.  That sucks about Scott.  Hope it's nothing terrible and that he recovers quickly.
Damn.  I don't have as much time off left as I thought.  Still about eight days over the next two months, though.
I am assiduously avoiding work at the moment.  I'm running out of places to surf, though.
You know, if my husband weren't a complete dunderhead sometimes, life would be a whole lot easier.
Please, God, let this day be over soon.
Why was KOOL radio playing Christmas music this morning?
Oh, my God.  Is this the world's most boring project, or what?
There was something I was supposed to do.  I don't remember what it was, darn it.
Arrested Development was a really fun show.  We're two-thirds of the way through Season 2 on DVD, and having a really good time with it.
What is so hard to understand about "no ketchup, no mustard"?  This is the second time this same Jack in the Box has screwed this up.
Home computer not happy with the internet this weekend.  Good thing I didn't plan on doing much, anyway.
A miracle has happened - Grace is letting everyone go home early!
Pamela Anderson - delusions of relevance?
@troubleagain - I am green with envy!  Dammit, I wish I could go home.
Test tweet
So...bored...
Ah-ha!  You reply by clicking that little arrow thingy!
@Quillmenow, troubleagain is here, too.
Too much Twitter.  Spending too much time finding utilities.  Widgets!
Poli - you were the reason I started posting, anyway.  Before, I was just following Lileks.
I overslept this morning and didn't have time to bathe.  I feel really icky.
Poli - oh, I'm following Lileks.  He's how I found Twitter to begin with!
Okay - I'm here.  Now what?
