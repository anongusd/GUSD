Mini golf, then bowling, then a movie, so hopefully today will be less sunburn-y than yesterday.
@ladyshada OMG hammock just makes that even more epic. I need a teleporter to hang out with you guys more. Planes are expensive. :P~
Karaoke last night with Sas, @saraonstine & @warneronstine. Of course I managed to find the only Broadway song in their book. Any guesses?
Sas comes today! I'm so excited!!
Something eerie going on in my apt... I can walk from one end to the other without stepping over anything. Maybe because I cleaned it?
@jillm Dude, that's awesome. I saw her in Minsky's and she's hilarious.
Apparently I bring much joy to the world. Yay me.
@kaylle_ Also, home now, sans cable box. Long story.
@kaylle_ I blame you.
I am ridiculously excited for Broadway Secrets this week.
@taylorishere OMG that's a nasty gash. She looks happy-go-lucky about it though. :)
7 minutes till I'm out of here... but who's counting? I'm spending my weekend doing touristy things, how about you?
Neil Patrick Harris needs a twitter? Yes, please! If you agree, tweet and tag. #NPHgetatwitter
Why does Broadway live all the way in NYC? I need a fix, and there's nothing playing within driving distance. Ugh, I'm addicted.
@topherjames27 Ah, I see. Hard to tell in the tiny pic, but I think it looks good. :)
@topherjames27 Dude, did you shave your head??
@ladyshada I know it's online somewhere... Fox or Hulu, probably? Defintely worth tracking down.
I thought Glee might be epic fail, but it was actually kind of awesome.
@kaylle_ Normally I'd sing in the car w/ a 10min commute & 1hr CR, so I'd hear it every 2 days, but now I have a 5min commute and a 2hr CR.
@kaylle_ I'm listening at work, so no belting for me. Learning the words is harder when you can't sing. :/
N2N: The I'm Alive reprise is creeping me out.
@kaylle_ Ouch!
For just another day, I will keep the plates on spinning, with a smile so white and winning all the way.
@rainnwilson I get on planes from LAX to NYC and never see celebrities. You've got three? I must be on the wrong flights.
Apparently there was also a marriage equality rally in NYC that I missed while I was in NYC. 3 blocks away and I knew nothing about it. :/
Apparently there was an earthquake in Cali that I missed while I was in NYC.
Hostel was way less insane last night. Yay sleep.
Just saw @taylorishere as Frankie. Amazing! :)
This weekend needs to be way less epic fail-y from here on out, k? Thanks.
@saraonstine I think I'm missing a PBJ reference somewhere. It's been a weird day, so I blame my brain. Enlighten me?
Peanut butter is just really good. Really really good.
Car woudn't start this morning. Final damage: $783. Nice way to start a week. At least I'm seeing JB this weekend. 4th row center. Yay!
Only JJ Abrams could make me watch Star Trek and like it.
Welcome @ziggy47252 ! You need to follow @ladyshada too. Do you think we can break K and get her on here too?
Going home!
@marthabeans Yes, and SJB, but my biggest WTFs were the Constantine nod, and 9 to 5 & Shrek missing from scenic design.
Tony noms were a lot of epic fail. :/
I'm getting mixed signals at my job. My boss is either trying to promote me or fire me. Obviously one is preferable over the other.
@kaitkerrigan Who's winning?
@feliciaday The Macarena is required.
Work is insane, but help is coming tomorrow. Yay! I can't keep doing two people's jobs in one 40 hour week.
@kaitkerrigan I can't wait either, assuming you guys can find a seat for me. :)
Best Sam Brown ever was last night. I'm way excited for the talk back tonight and the new ending going in tomorrow. :D
Also, I have An Ordinary Senior Year stuck in my head. But not annoyingly so.
I bought a Sam Brown ticket for tonight. I haven't seen it in 3 days, so obviously it was calling to me.
@marthabeans OMG I need me some weird ALAYM. *prays for a boot*
Yup, it's a three show weekend. Tickets are purchased.
@marthabeans The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown. SEE IT. Awesome show. Lisa Brescia. Samueli Theater at OCPAC till May 3.
I think it's a three show weekend.
I'm in love w/ a show that has no OBCR & no boots. I found some studio tracks, but they're sung by random people, not the show's actors. :/
TUAO Sam Brown. I've seen 2 out of their 3 shows, and yet I want to go again tonight. I'll go tomorrow. I'll go broke if I go everyday.
http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Maps/118-34.html
I wasn't sure if it was an earthquake or if I was just crazy, but sure enough, my chair really was moving by itself.
@feliciaday *looks down at outfit* I'm a "Felicia Day type" and proud of it! :)
@taylorishere http://ask.metafilter.com/31756/After-the-jump Answer is about halfway down the page.
@saraonstine I have it written down at home. $190ish for both, but I'll get back to you with an exact number.
@saraonstine Also! I forgot to tell you I got the Wicked tickets. 9th row. On the side, but still a good view. Yay!
@saraonstine Orange County aka Santa Ana is closest. Airport code is SNA. Long Beach (LGB) is good too. Avoid LAX like the plague.
Saw TUBO Samantha Brown last night. Great show. It needs some polishing, but there's a few moments of pure gold. See it if you can.
Outta here in 9 minutes. Not that I'm counting.
see?
Why do I feel the need to always come close to 140 characters? It's like I talk so much that if given the chance, I can't not say something.
I live alone because roommates are too much drama, and I don't need any more drama in my life. I get enough of it on the internet.
In the living room with my dad. Shooting the breeze in my cool living room cause it's so hot outside. Also: showing him what twitter is.
@EWAusielloFiles Kara is definitely one of the best things about this season. Second to Adam. Okay, maybe third to Kris. But yeah, agreed.
Picking my dad up from the airport and buying Tempe tickets. Yay on both accounts. :)
@ladyshada Princess Leia buns?? No, it's just my hair. You've seen it since I cut it short, right?
@saraonstine That's probably for the best, on several levels. :)
@saraonstine The worst part is that the bad timing is my own fault. I bought the plane ticket! :P~
@saraonstine My current solution: call ticketmaster from my car. But if you want to call in a bomb threat to delay the plane, be my guest ;)
Epic ticket buying problem: Pick up Dad at the airport at the same time that Tempe tickets go on sale. What's a Wicked fangirl to do?
New pic! :)
I registered for San Diego Comic-Con, Saturday and Sunday. Anyone want to join me?
BSG The Last Frakking Special: Jamie Bamber's British accent freaks me out, like whoa. Also, Hotdog is Adama's son? This is new information.
Don't put your wet hands on the paper towel roll. Just don't do it. It makes the baby Jesus cry.
Good morning. What's for breakfast?
My office is really cold today. Brrrr.
This week is flying by. It's Thursday already??
@ladyshada Four layers of chips! I think you're right. They're so sneaky!
Shouldn't Seven Layer Nachos involve seven things? This one has three toppings, plus chips. Epic fail, Taco Bell.
Airplanes make me watch movies that I would probably otherwise not watch, and yet I enjoy immensely. Case in point: The Express
@marthabeans You. Are. Awesome. :)
Saw Wicked twice. Nicole/Alli/Aaron = one of the best casts I've seen.
Guys and Dolls was good, but not my new favorite show. Titus Burgess was fantastic. Stage door was insane, but Lauren was adorable, so yay.
Landed in NYC a couple hours ago. Slept a little on the plane. At the hostel waiting for my turn in the shower, then off to Guys & Dolls. :)
@marthabeans Would you be able to find out when Angel might be going on? I heard she's getting two days in April during Teal's vacation.
Apparently Annaleigh is no longer attached to CMIYC. Sad. Where shall I see my favorite Glinda next?
@saraonstine Of course hubbys are allowed! Wicked love is for everyone. :)
@saraonstine Actually, I guess not every weekend works for me. The 4th is best, but the 11th or 18th work great too. Comic-Con is the 25th.
@saraonstine Definitely not too late for Wicked yet! Tickets go on sale April 18. Any weekend that works for you is fine with me. :D
Um, no, I can't look it up in my email. Outlook won't search through every handwritten post-it note you gave me in the last month.
If anyone can figure out how to see about 50 broadway shows in five days, let me know. I can only figure out how to do seven, maybe eight.
I think I hate people today too. Just all of them.
Today I hate all fonts. Every single one of them.
@marthabeans OBC Boq was the lead. The whole cast was great, and the show had me cracking up. :) Did your friend like it?
Saw Minsky's at the Ahmenson last night. Very funny. See it if you get the chance.
I need to own a stealth jet. That would make my life so much easier.
@krystalatwork I love the new header. :)
Stephanie J. Block pwns all. I can't wait to see her in June. I'll just have to play Get Out and Stay Out over and over till then.
@ladyshada You didn't watch, and yet you still managed to spot Miley's bubble dress. All she needed was a wand. lol
Sheesh, two speeches in, and I'm already tearing up.
Lazy Saturday, but hopefully I can get a few things done around home. :)
Oh, weekend, how I love you.
I'm a skilled graphic designer, not your secretary. Make your own damn copies.
Last minute weekend flight to NYC is $424. I need to be richer.
Ooo! Tomorrow is bagel day! I heart bagel day. :)
Work sucks today. And I miss Kaylle. And Shada and Mark. Sigh.
Is "Obsessive Impulsive Plane Ticket Buying Disorder" a thing? I think I have it.
Home now. Already planning my return.
ComicCon 2010, here we come. It'll take that long to make the dresses.
I flew to Cincinnati to eat dinner in my friend's bathroom while she paints herself green. Also, I now have ruby slippers.
@ladyshada I'm in ur seetbelt, steelin' ur safety.
Sewing weekend is off to the races! So far I've sewn exactly nothing. *g*
Luckily my boss was cool with me leaving early, but sheesh, we just can't plan nice things. Crossing my fingers everything else goes well.
Then just now I got a call that my flight was delayed, and I had to get on an earlier flight or I'd miss my connection.
First, Kaylle's power was out last night. Since it took 3 days to restore last time, we wondered if we'd be sitting in the dark all weekend.
Off to Cincy this weekend and the antics of the universe conspiring against us have already started.
No, the fact that you *really* want it to doesn't make it fit.
Dear boss: The block of text that I told you yesterday wouldn't fit there? Yeah, it still doesn't fit there today.
My head feels free! and my shower took 75% less time this morning. Hallelujah.
Goodbye hair. It's been fun.
@trenttsd I'm boring, I'd put it all on my debt snowball.
Why do people think frugal = broke? Just because I use a coupon at the grocery store, that doesn't mean I have problems paying my rent.
Shopping is exhausting.
No surprise: Credit card company employees are morons.
Friday!!
Why do they stock the cookie dough next to the yogurt? That's just mean.
Dear American Idol: Please show Adam Lambert *SINGING* tonight. Thanks, Anna
JJ Abrams was put on this earth to fuck with my brain.
What am I doing? I'm twittering.
Saved by web-based email. Yay.
"You can get a better return on your investment if you go out to eat than if you leave it with the IRS." Dave Ramsey ftw
Sewing weekend is only 10 days away! :D
Only about seven boxes left to unpack. Yay.
Mmmm smoothie. :)
I seriously need a defibrillator after this week's BSG. Holy frak.
I think I'm cutting my hair off this weekend. It's driving me crazy and it's got to go.
Weekend mission: Put my life back together. After being gone 6 out of the past 7 weeks, I'm looking forward to unpacking & settling in.
Also, stop poking me. Thanks.
Am I the only one who gets annoyed by Facebook applications? No, I do not want a drink/plant/pet/whatever, real or imagined. Thanks.
Wicked tour lotto was cancelled this weekend. Poor Kaylle!
Ugh. Quarterly meeting time. These have absolutely *nothing* to do with me or what I do, so why do they make me go? I will never understand.
Crazy random happenstance: There was a Four Seasons tribute group at the trade show. Totally made my day!
AFK most of the day - working field trip to San Diego. :)
Walter Bishop FTW.
Apparently I missed seeing Dee and Annaleigh at stage door by 15 minutes. Sad. But missing my plane would have been sadder.
Dude. Twitter locked me out of searching for people. What's up with that?
It's only Tuesday? Sigh.
I can haz twitter!
