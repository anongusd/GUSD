Trump and MOST Americans know. I can't wait for 22 Dems debating @realDonaldTrump, and neither can he. Most of them will be in prison before 2020 anyway, I guarantee! The debates were a blast in 2016, 2020 will be a bloodbath by Trump. It'll be TOO FUNNY! 👍 https://t.co/YKCq93xuWd
YEP! Like @MZHemingway said, we must go back to paper ballots. I believe that most Americans agree with paper ballots and Photo ID's of course. Trump still has 2 years to fix it.

UNFORTUNATELY alot of people's comments claim that you're "judging" homosexuality, which in turn that means that they R "judging" U. So, now they'll judge me, since I agree with U.

Oh, how wonderful! Did you get the tweet with the Book ordering directions? https://t.co/L1AuSRd8FW
https://t.co/EzxDBWbc2u Pls click on Bookstore. Type THE ROYAL PATH and you'll C this book. It's from a monastery that used 2B ours, but Putin's Evil Moscow took over it in 2002. WHY we're alive &amp; WHY we suffer on earth. Published in 1709. It changed my life. @StephenRLandfi2 ♥️ https://t.co/N2ZvMJhcxW
You're so dear to me Stephen. I don't mean to lecture you. I'm going to send you a tweet with what book I'd love for you to order. I'll be back. I wish everyone in the world would read it. ♥️ https://t.co/F3DUpiRIZv
When a man C's so much evil, that's WHAT is suppose 2 make them believe that both God &amp; Satan do exist. We have free will 2 chose. We were all created in God's image. Those who chose evil listen 2 Satan instead of God who is our conscience. GOV sucks. The Laws of God do not! ☦️ https://t.co/Ulq2iAAYOg
I know, Stephen, you already told me that. Who is these days? I'm trying to walk the walk and stop just talking the talk. This world is just our temporary home. We're to live in the world, but not BE OF the world. ☦️ https://t.co/DsCXoXO8p0

@realDonaldTrump @parscale PLS have our President come out with golden cuffs and arrest Obama 4 the whole world 2C &amp; allow TRUMP to drop the mic! Could U imagine the cheering from all over the world!? Did UC the video from Italy today? A huge statue of TRUMP as a WARRIOR! 😂👍😎 https://t.co/MmHvZnt1OM
No shit. Wanting &amp; doing R 2 different things. Americans will NEVER give up their guns. Concentrate on Islam 4 now instead. China will eventually nuke 1/3 of the pop. Read your Bible. The Anti-Christ will rule for 7 yrs eventually B4 Judgement Day. U may not b around 4 that? https://t.co/RdfqUVk2hJ
I get it. Both sets of my parents escaped Communism. I homeschooled my 2 sons, so obviously I know. Y do U refuse 2 believe the attempted take-over of Islam in the USA? BHO ordered drugs 2B flown into our country from the Saudis. We're living in the end of times, tho most don't C https://t.co/htgxJNhXAc
American's are now waking up from the dumbing down. Islam is in every state. Obama did this on purpose. His "hope" was to "change" America into a Muslim Nation. Communism will not take hold, not as of yet. Islam must be destroyed. Have you seen @ACTBrigitte Gabriel's Utubes? https://t.co/sWIYePJAB7
Stephen, it's no time 2B joking. Catherine is serious. While I was in Illinois last month, I passed a huge mosque &amp; they had police men stopping traffic for 2 different exists for these wealthy folks to get onto the roads B4 regular people like us could. Traffic jam galore. SICK! https://t.co/reW8Fh6oug
