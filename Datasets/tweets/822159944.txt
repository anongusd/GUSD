@MerrittPaulson also, I think you still owe us a couple more extensions..  #payingattention
@MerrittPaulson Love your teases boss, but... can we get the story within a couple of days.  That last tease was brutal! #nuthinbutloveforya
@BackOfficeGavin any new signings on the horizon??  Mix Diskerud perhaps?
@MLS There are a few boys at @TimbersFC that might have something to say about that.  #RCTID #justsayin
@TheMikeDonovan Yes it is confusing.  Thank you for the info.
@TheMikeDonovan Why a lottery and not allocation order?
@TheMikeDonovan How did DC get him?
