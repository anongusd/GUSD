My book, "The Russia Hoax", is out today in paperback.  It contains new &amp; updated information since the hardback was published last July.  You can find it in bookstores nationwide or order it online.  It explains in detail how corrupt government officials schemed to frame Trump.
@Clark_Grizwold1 Because Comey, Lynch, Obama &amp;  senior leadership at the FBI &amp; DOJ protected her. They ignored her blatant crimes &amp; obstructed justice. Then, they used HER collusion with Russia to frame Trump. Anyone other than Hillary would have been indicted. Naturally, the media was complicit
Sen. Richard Burr, Chair of Senate Intel Committee: "We don't have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign &amp; Russia."  This, after interviewing more than 200 witnesses &amp; examining over 300,000 pages. I'll be talking about it on Hannity tonight at 9.
@SusieDallas I don’t color my hair.  Never have.  I’m sorry you don’t like it.  —Gregg

@wgrzMichael @tribelaw @CNN Yes, I read both his articles.  The allegations against Trump predate his nomination. Trump Tower meeting, Papadopoulos meeting with Mifsud, Page’s speech in Moscow...all occurred before his nomination.  Again, bribery statute does not apply.
@tribelaw @CNN Uh...did you actually read the statute or your own tweet?  Trump was not a “public official” when he ran for president.  Bribery statute 201(b)(2)(B) does not apply.
https://t.co/OnnKsQoYSo
Typical that Mediaite didn’t include my tweets that preceded the ones they cherry-picked to compose their biased post.  Want to include those, Aidan McLaughlin?   This is what Dan Abrams does on his website.  He hires biased people to compose stories that pretend to be fair.
Renato Mariotti...the failed Democrat who constantly rails against Trump is the guy Mediaite always turns to for as a reliable quote.
Frankly, it should be against the law to allow a bunch of snot-nosed kids, fresh out of law school, to file a federal court document that contorts the law in a deliberate effort to implicate the President in wrongdoing.   Did they even read the law?  Comprehend it?  Morons.
Look at the four attorneys who signed the Cohen sentencing memo under Robert Khuzami’s name.  Griswold, Maimin, McKay and Roos. They’re all kids.  No real experience. They don’t know anything about the law.  They don’t understand the Federal Campaign Election Act.
I’m hoping William Barr, an outstanding lawyer, will clean up the corruption at the Department of Injustice and FBI. Prosecute Comey, McCabe Strzok, Steele, Ohr, Simpson, and  others.  And fire Robert Khuzam, who is “acting” as a US Attorney.
Trump did not use campaign funds. A candidate may make unlimited contributions to his own campaign. Yet, Robert Khuzami convinced Cohen, a liar and tax cheat, to plead guilty to a non-crime. Khuzami wants to be the guy who brings down the President.
Robert Khuzami, the “Acting” US Attorney, filed a sentencing memo claiming President Trump organized illegal payments.  Khuzami doesn’t know the law.  Non-disclosure contracts are legal in every state.  It’s not an illegal campaign contribution.  Not a crime. Khuzami is wrong.
Katie Rogers' story entitled "Books Trump Can Praise Without Reading A Word" is untrue --at least insofar as my book is concerned, which she cited as proof.  Sadly, @nytimes is famous for this kind of sloppy and biased reporting. Don't bother calling me after the fact, Katie.
NY Time's reporter Katie Rogers is either lazy or incompetent.  She never bothered to contact me to ask if I knew whether President Trump had read my book before tweeting about it.  He had.  He recounted to me parts of chapters that he would only know from reading the book.

Whitaker’s appointment is NOT unconstitutional or invalid. Under the Vacancies Reform Act, the President is authorized to designate as Acting A-G an officer or employee who has been at the DOJ for at least 90 days.  Whitaker meets this legal standard.

I'll be on Hannity tonight at 9 pm, eastern, to discuss the latest Strzok-Page texts and their "media leak strategy" to plant stories based on false information to frame Trump.  Time for a grand jury to examine the incriminating evidence that law enforcers became law breakers.
I'll be on "The Evening Edit" on Fox Business Network during the 5pm, eastern, hour... to talking about the FBI's "media leak strategy" designed to frame Trump.  Exactly what I wrote in my book, "The Russia Hoax".  New text messages corroborate it.  Hope you'll tune in.
There’s a reason why I put Bob Mueller’s mug on the cover of my book, “The Russia Hoax”, together with James Comey and Hillary Clinton.  Their Illicit schemes detailed therein set a new low for government malfeasance.  I should have included Rod Rosenstein on the cover. My bad.
Bob Mueller must be proud. A 14 day sentence for a young, junior campaign volunteer. Yet Mueller won’t investigate his longtime friend who defrauded FISC judges in order to spy, stole govt documents &amp; leaked them to trigger the special counsel. The corrupted world of Bob Mueller
Bob Woodward has managed to prove the legal axiom, “Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus”.   A book that is false in one matter (or, in Woodward’s case, several matters) is not credible as to any matter.  This is the peril of a reporter content to exploit anonymous sources.  A shame.

I find it amusing when James Comey sermonizes about lies &amp; truth.  (Comey: "truth matters").  This is a man who used a lie to launch The Russia Hoax and deceived a court to wiretap.  He stole government documents, then leaked them to trigger the special counsel --his friend.
https://t.co/LrAJDCYlbl
As I explain in Chapter 6 of my book, Brennan did more than anyone to promulgate the phony dossier.  He politicized &amp; weaponized false intelligence against Trump. Brennan was the "instigator" of "The Russia Hoax." He orchestrated the investigation to damage Trump and help Clinton
John Brennan is a national security risk.  He has shown he cannot be trusted with classified or top secret information.  With a history of leaking, he has demonstrated a willingness to use classified material for partisan purposes.  This jeopardizes national security.

@AFifth_Grader @realJeffreyLord That’s not true. Read Glenn Simpson’s congressional testimony.  Only AFTER Clinton and Democrats hired Fusion GPS was Steele approached by the company to compose the anti-trump dossier.   Get your facts straight.  —Gregg
Comey has NOT been telling the truth.  He pretended the “dossier” was only a minor part of the warrant application that he signed to wiretap, claiming it was NOT a “critical part of it” and there was a “significant amount of additional material.”  Demonstrably untrue.
I spend an entire chapter laying out this same evidence in my book, “The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump”.   The book comes out this Tuesday.  These new documents corroborate what is in the book.  I hope you’ll read it.
Newly released documents prove that Comey’s FBI and the DOJ relied almost entirely on the phony and unverified anti-Trump “dossier” to gain warrants to wiretap Trump campaign associate.  The “dossier”, paid for by Clinton &amp; Democrats, was about 95% of the application to spy!
@axios @CGasparino Really????
@GrouchoG @washingtonpost The Rosenbergs were prosecuted and convicted of espionage. They were never charged with treason because the U.S. was not at war with the Soviets.  Proves my point.
I tackle some of the silly accusations of treason in my book, "The Russia Hoax," which will arrive on bookstore shelves in one week.  It can be pre-ordered on Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble websites.
Whenever John Brennan opens his mouth or tweets he removes all doubt about his ignorance.  He clearly knows nothing about treason.  The U.S. is not at war with Russia.  He should read professor Carlton Larson's excellent analysis of treason in @washingtonpost on 2-17-17,
These are just a few of the questions that should be asked and answered.
10)  What did you mean by “unfinished business” in your May 22, 2017 text?  What did you mean by “Now I need to fix it and finish it”?
9.)  What was Page referring to when she texted on November 3rd, “The (NYT) probability numbers are dropping every day.  I’m scared for our organization”?   What organization?
8.)  What did you understand Lisa Page meant in her September 2nd text that “(Obama) wants to know everything we’re doing”?
7.)  What intelligence evidence existed to justify opening a counterintelligence probe?
6.)  How many confidential informants were used to spy on Trump campaign?  Were they employed before July 31st?  Were they paid by the FBI?  How much taxpayer money was used in payments?
5.) Were you aware that the Clinton campaign and the DNC were paying for the anti-Trump “dossier”?  Was it ever verified?  Why was it used for a FISA warrant to wiretap Carter Page?   Was the “dossier” also used for a new wiretap against Paul Manafort?
4.)  Why did you fly to London the day after papers were signed launching the Trump-Russia investigation on July 31st?  With whom did you meet?  Christopher Steele?  What specifically did you discuss?  Were you given the “dossier”?  Or did you already have a copy of it?
3.) What did you mean by “stop” Trump in your August 8, 2016 text?   What was the “insurance policy” described in the August 15 text?
2.) Was Clinton asked any questions during her FBI interview about her “intent”?  If not, why not?
Questions for Peter Strzok for his Wednesday deposition:	1) Why, on June 6, 2016, did you change Comey’s finding that Clinton was “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless”?  Other than Lisa Page, who helped you? Who are the other two people who helped change that statement?

On Feb. 3, I tweeted that Rod Rosenstein threatened to subpoena calls &amp; texts of Intel Committee.  Ryan Reilly of Huff Post called my reporting "dubious".  He was wrong.  See https://t.co/L7HkH3ESPU
Clapper was just on CNN defending Comey.   This from a proven liar.  Clapper should be in prison for perjury.    Obama protected him.
I’ve finished reading Comey’ book.   It’s an easy and superficial read.   I saw nothing that was true.  I can only conclude that Comey’s version of events is fantasy.  It is fiction.   Things will end badly for Comey.   He stole government documents.
I obtained a copy of Comey’s book.  I’m half way through, but so far there is nothing  resembling the truth.  I’ll keep searching for something other than self-adoration and puffery.  So far, there is no demonstrable truth.  Which puts a lie to the title of the book.
Very excited about the cover for my forthcoming book.  HarperCollins did a great job!  It's called, "The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump."   You can check it out on Amazon.  	https://t.co/hDfv8qjoXu
I’ve written a book, soon to be published:  “The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.”   You can check out the details on Amazon.   -Gregg
Unethical Mueller, in his court filing, admits that Rosenstein’s order appointing him was intentionally vague. This violates the special counsel law that requires a specific statement of facts to be investigated.  Rosenstein and Muller colluded to break the law  and should resign
Comey’s lawyer said his client has been defamed by Trump. So why hasn’t he sued?  The reason is obvious. Truth is a defense to defamation.  If Comey didn’t commit crimes and lie then he would file a lawsuit. His failure to do so indicates he knows what he did broke several laws.
If Comey cleared Cinton for political reasons (as evidence suggests) that’s obstruction of justice.  If he gave false testimony to Congress, well...you know.   I could go all day long on Comey.  Looking forward to his work of fiction with the pretentious, self-righteous title.
As for Comey, he appears to have stolen government documents, a crime under 18 USC 641. If any were classified (as Grassley seems to believe), it’s a crime under 18 USC 1924 (and probably 793).  Deceiving the FISA court and concealing evidence?  That’s 6 different felonies.
If it is true that McCabe gave false and misleading statements to the IG, he should be charged criminally under 18 USC 1001.  If he was under oath, as the AG statement alleges, he should be charged with perjury under 18 USC 1621.  Losing his job is the least of McCabe’s concerns.
What uninformed and idiotic statements by Asha Rangappa.  The OIG and OPR found McCabe did not give honest answers.  He was fired for that, as the regulations require. Period.  But she knows better?  It’s reflects poorly on the FBI that she was once an agent.
Hope you’ll tune in to Hannity tonight at 9 pm, eastern for a discussion on the special counsel probe...and more.  Gregg

A 2nd source has now confirmed to me that, in a meeting on January 10, Deputy A-G Rosenstein used the power of his office to threaten to subpoena the calls &amp; texts of the Intel Committee to get it to stop it’s investigation of DOJ and FBI.  Likely an Abuse of Power &amp; Obstruction.
Again, if true, Rosenstein’s action was an illegal abuse of power and he should no longer serve as Deputy Attorney General.  He allegedly used threats to try to stop the Intelligence Committee from exposing wrongful behavior in an attempt to cover it up.
Nunes was exercising his constitutional oversight authority by investigating alleged wrongdoing in the FBI and DOJ.  Rosenstein, according to the source, threatened to use his power to retaliate against Nunes and others in an effort to intimidate them and stop their legal efforts
It is a crime for a government official to use his office to threaten anyone, including a member of Congress, for exercising a constitutionally protected right.  See 18 USC 242 and other similar abuse of power statutes.
In a meeting with Chairman Devin Nunes, FBI Director Christopher Wray and others, the source says that Rosenstein threatened to subpoena the texts and emails of Congress because he was”tired of dealing with the Intelligence Committee.”  If true, Rosenstein must resign or be fired
Abuse of power continues still at the Department of Justice. As I reported last night on Hannity, a highly reliable congressional source tells me that 3 weeks ago, on January 10, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein used the power of his office to threaten Members of Congress.
Also, Steve...there’s no legal requirement or necessity to call the FBI.  It’s not a crime to talk to a Russian.  I think you may have missed another day of class when the First Amendment was explained.  (Those high school absences can really have an impact later in life.)
Assuming the statement attributed to Bannon is accurate, treason is actionable only in time of war.  We’re not at war with Russia.  I’m sure Steve  was simply absent the day it was taught in high school civics class.
It is not a crime to talk to a guy in London who talked to a guy in Russia who conveyed a rumor which is later passed on to an Australian diplomat who gives it to the FBI.    Yet, the FBI started a case against Trump based on quadruple hearsay involving no criminal acts?
The NYT reporters were used .  A splashy front page story that purports to justify the FBI probe of Trump, yet the published account offers no legal justification.  Why didn’t they write a story of how the FBI launched an improper, if not illegal, criminal investigation of Trump?
NYT: the FBI launched an investigation of Trump because one of his volunteer staffers heard a rumor that Russia had obtained hacked emails that would damage Clinton.   	Where is the suspected crime involving Trump or his campaign that would merit the FBI investigating them?

Allegedly covering up for Weinstein is yet another.
It proves that even mediocre minds can rise to the top of corporate America.  Lack has a long and distinguished record of failures.

So, NBC killed the Weinstein story.  My guess is that it was Andy Lackey.  First time I met him after he hired me...

He’ll look the other way, if it benefits the NFL and his own paycheck.  What a shame.
He is the symbol of self-interest. Show me the money!  He doesn’t care about women who are victims of abuse by NFL players.

I expect people like Ana Navarro to make stupid comments. Not Sen. McCain.
Obama pardoned General James Cartwright and commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning. The President had the right to do so.
right, just as every President before him has done. But under McCain's standard, all pardons would undermine the rule of law.
nor respect for it. The Founders conferred an absolute right in a President to pardon any person for any offense. Trump exercised this
Sen. McCain's ignorance of the Constitution is surprising. Presidential pardons cannot, by definition, undermine the rule of law,

You could use a little experience and maturity.
"Old Man"?  You're right about that.  I was trying cases in front of juries when you were in diapers, Don.
Yet, you have the audacity to claim that you know better than these jurors.  What a pompous, pretentious jerk.
Did you watch all of the testimony?  Did you examine all of the evidence?  Were you in the jury room for deliberations?  No you were not.
And there would be plenty of space left over.
The sum total of what Lemon knows about the law and this case... could be written on the head of a pin.
Lemon was "pissed".  Forget about some measure of objectivity as an anchor.  That's not his thing.
Pathetic: Don Lemon --everything that happens in the world happens to him personally.  The Dunne verdict.  It happened to him personally.

@gsalmons I don't know about that.  Keep your eye on the whistleblower who was fired... and serious Brady violations.
In the post verdict interviews, these prosecutors are revealing their true character.  And It is not to be admired.
The character of a person is best measured by his or her humility in victory and graciousness in defeat.
I suspect this will end badly for Corey.  All in all, a pathetic team of lawyers.  As a lawyer, I'm embarassed for the profession.
Now, she's revictimizing Zimmerman by calling him a "murderer".  She is profoundly unethical.  The Florida Bar should investigate.
As for Angela Corey...a good lawyer doesn't over-charge the case.  Of course, she didn't have the "courage" to try the case herself.
Really?  You'd think he'd be better lawyer than the bumbling, stumbling, and fumbling attorney we watched in court.
cross-examination, if you don't have to?   De La Rionda bragged after he lost the case that he's tried more than 300 cases.
videotaped statements to police.  Thanks to prosecutors, Zimmerman testified without taking the witness stand.  Why subject yourself to...
Zimmerman prosecutors say he lacked "courage" to take the stand?  He didn't have to.  They're the ones who foolishly introduced all his...
And, obviously, not much of a lawyer.
Also, Snowden failed to follow the statutory reporting procedures.  But all of this seems lost on Greenwald.  Again, he's no journalist.
The NSA data collection was approved by a federal judge (thus, it was not illegal or "misconduct" under the language of the statute).
that Snowden is a "whistleblower".  Greenwald, as a lawyer, should take the time to read the federal statute.  Snowden does not qualify.
How can he possibly know that?  (The NSA director, Feinstein &amp; Rogers all say otherwise.)  But more troubling is Greenwald's insistence...
He is an advocate and a partisan.  He has made partisan pronouncements that his disclosures did not harm national security.
I was surprised to see Glen Greenwald refer to himself as a "journalist".  Let's be clear:  Greenwald is no journalist.

@Independent02 When you follow Julie... that's all you really, right???
@Don87497 Thanks.  Nice to be back... but, in truth, I'd rather be back on the beach in San Diego.
As for her claim that she's a lame duck governor... that's nonsense.  Many governors have accomplished a lot in their last year in office.
Is that right or fair?
But here's the thing.  She made an implicit promise to the citizens of Alaska... now, she's breaching the promise without much explanation.
So... now that it's been 2 days since Palin's announcement... do we have any idea why she's quitting?  I'm still puzzled.  I don't know why
@hospicenurse54 Not at all.  I just think her quitting raises more question than it provides answers.
@hospicenurse54 EXACTLY!
@Thobert1 What's wrong with my legs?
@glasater55 Great point:  no one complained about Obama abandoning his senate seat after a mere 46 months.

Julie always teases me.  I try to return the favor.

@JoeZannino_CT    Julie got a written warning last time she was in Bolder.  Thats how she knew.
@JOHNCOSSEL We have fun.  Love to tease each other.
@lanquihue From what I read, the supervolcano would be so powerful... it would create it's own expansive winds in all directions.
But I'm impressed at the courage of those demonstrators.  They've gotta know they're risking their lives with a brutal regime.
I just wonder how the Mullahs will respond... and the Revolutionary Guard.  Those folks are soooo tolerant.
So... wow, Tehran is on fire in more ways than one.  Haven't seen that since the 79 Revolution.

@kenbuck No can tell!  But it was a clear liquid.  And it cleared up my throat quite nicely.
@revzgavec Watson admitted being criminally reckless... causing her death (manslaughter). .  But he still insists it wasn't intentional.
which is not constrained with such a presuption.
@blueskyup Nonsense.  The presumption of innocence happens in a court of law.  I'm operating in the court of public opinion...
Now, we don't always do so... if another country decides to prosecute.  But we could have taken jurisdiction, if Australia permitted.
@blueskyup Not true.  Anytime an American is harmed or killed anywhere in the world, the U.S. can assume jurisdiction.
her regulator or tank!!!   Plus, he gav a dozen differing and inconsistent statements.  All that adds up to strong circumstantial evidence.
@donnak1613 Right!  Most modern vests can be easily inflated... or just drop her belt.   Moreover, there was nothing wrong with...
Those cases involved civil rights violations... but there might be a way around it in the Scuba case.
Same thing in the Crown Heights Murder case, if I recall.
@HockeyGuy There are ways around double jeopardy, depending on the circumstances.  Remember the Rodney King case?  Cops tried twice.
@BruceWilsonFoto Thanks!  That was the first time i've ever been on Red Eye.  It was lots of fun.  Gregg, Andy and Bill are quick and funny.
@Todd_H_225 I would say that's a fair assessment!!!
Thanks everyone.  See you tomorrow.  Appreciate all the great comments.
@tazachusetts08   Yup... her decision in Ricci may prove the truth of her earlier lecture at Bolt Hall.  And if she gets overturned...
@palmercomm ...cause they're "set for life"???
@palmercomm Yes... but at what cost?  Often, rich kids are spoiled or neglected or mentally abused.  Is it permissible to say it's okay...
What do you folks think of that?  Racial bias?  Racism?  Or none of the above?
But what about that comment by Sotomayor?   The one where she seems to be saying that a Latina woman has superior wisdom than a white male?
Good afternoon everyone.  Computer from H___ !   Finally got it to work.  i know we"re getting your views on JON & KATE...
@freon500 One question: if the mother beat her son... should he be removed from her care?  Now substitute life-threatening neglect.
@ndchiguy  Courts have in the past ordered medical treatment for minors... after determining it's in the "best interests of the child".
is not capable of making his own mature and informed decision... then a guardian needs to be appointed to protect his interests.
@RevJimII I agree personal choice is important... but when your choice is so poor that it harms a child who...
@FarmwenchCT Thanks!   Brian Gaffney was the Executive Producer of that documentary on Madoff.  It airs again tonight.. 9 eastern.
Which means I'd charge the mother with abuse... or, at the very least, have her declared an unfit parent... thus, removing her child.
Is there a difference between physical abuse of a child... and the neglect of a child which causes physical harm?  I say no difference.
@ChristianGilfoy The other point is this:  is failing to get proper and effective care for your child... the equivalent of child abuse?
@rendale Yes... I interviewed him.  Billy Best.  But he's a rare case, statistically.  Most people who use natural remedies...die of cancer
The mother has been treating Daniel with natural remedies... but the latest x-ray shows it isn't working.  The tumor is growing larger.
@Battleborne my point is... the liklihood of survival is high with chemo treatment.  The liklihood of survival without is low.
Look... chemo has a roughly 90 % cure rate for this kind of Lymphoma.  The cure rate for natural remedies (there are no good studies)...low
@TheresaTexas I think Danny's mother is keeping him from getting the most effective life-saving treatment available.  .
@ExRea I, too have respect for those who embrace the sanctity of life.  But I also have respect for those who disagree with me.  Try it.
the number of abortions.  Impressive.  And he didn't shy away from those who disagree with him.  The crowd seemed to respect that.
Very impressive speech by the President.  He laid out the conflict, said it might never be resolved, but laid out ideas for reducing
a discussion, which I'm sure the president welcomes.  Dialog often leads to change.
@TheresaTexas But it is a place for engagement.  The president will be meeting with Father Jenkins and faculty.  There will likely be
As St. Peter wrote: "we hould honor the leader who upholds the secular order".  Father Jenkins has a point, I think.
the Univ. President said that Notre Dame is called on to respect, participate in, and contribute to the wider society.
@bigsquirrel Oh, I don't think we're "blowing" it out of proportion.  It's a fascinating controversy among Catholics...
I think it's important to "engage" people with whom you disagree.  It doesn' mean you endorse their views.  That's what Keyes doesn't get.
can invite the President to speak.
And I'll make the point again: if the Pope can send Obama congratulatory telegrams (an "honor" in and of itself)...I think Notre Dame
@Knottienature I would agree.  When you start calling the President "evil"...and the Univ. Prez  "sinner"... it's a little too extreme.
@billpr53 Smackdown???  Really?  I'm not feeling the "ouch" you claim.  I thought it was a fair and spirited discussion.
But he loses folks sometimes with the "extreme" and inflamatory language he employs.
Keyes is an extremist on many issues... and I suspect this is one of them.  But listen...you've got to admire his convictions.
I agree that the honorary award is more troublesome.  But it is a tradition at Notre Dame whenever a presidential commencement is given..
Soo.. what do you think of all the protests at Notre Dame?
Good afternoon everyone.  Julie's off this weekend... and Shannon Bream is with me for the next couple of hours... then again later today.
Thanks everyone!
@AndrewSansone Thanks pal!!!
@HockeyGuy I'm with you.  That guy's a loser.  And a real mean-spirited person.
@kidranger Milton Friedman once quipped... if you put the government in charge of the Sahara Desert... the sand will vanish.
@Hawkeye0071 Yes... you don't need a body to prosecute for murder.  Many successful prosecutions have happened without a body.
@slimshady64 Plus... this is important... I exercise every morning (without fail)... for 30 minutes on an eliptical machine or I jog.
@slimshady64 raw vegies dipped in fat free ranch dressing.  I eat a lot of salads with fat free dressings.
@slimshady64  Gregg's diet: fruits, vegetables, fish and chicken.  Cut out beer and carbs like bread.  When I get hungry, I snack on...
@Hawkeye0071 Don't need a body.  But it helps.  I suspect he'll get indicted for that one someday.  they've got the goods on him for wife 3
@JamieWalker725 I think it's a really probability.  A systemically corrupt organization is precisely what RICO envisioned.  Great point.
@JamieWalker725 You know, that's very interesting.  I was thinking about that yesterday when I did an ACORN segment with John Fund.
Many thanks to all for your wonderful notes and kind prayers.  It helps!!!
Good afternoon everyone.  Happy Mothers Day to all Moms out there.  We'll be on air in 2 minutes
@kenbuck precisely.  He's behaviing like a murderous sociopath.  So, he probably is.
...even though it was probably motivated by the Drew Peterson case.  But good point!!!
@Crimefile That's an excellent question.  I doubt it constitutes a Bill of Attainder because it applies to all homicide defendants.
Thank you everyone for your very kind and supportive messages.  I'm doing fine, thanks.  Time will help... and staying busy at work.
@LauraLeeShaw Me too.  So much depressing economic news... we've gotta keep focusing on good things.  And those are hard to find!
our question: are you feeling more optimistic about the economy?  send us your answer and we'll put it on air.
Good afternoon everyone.
@PaleoPat ...why not actually specify what I said that you found objectionable.
@PaleoPat When you use stupid language like that... no one takes you seriously.  Instead of employing offensive invectives...
@AndrewSansone thanks, pal
There's some question whether the trial will take place before or after the executions.
The the latest group of pirates we captured in February... we handed over to the Kenyans, who agreed to prosecute.
@Hawkeye0071 Sure.  If a U.S. citizen is kidnapped... or a U.S. ship attacked... our nation has the right to prosecute.
@FVHayek Very good point.  I think Tamny's argument against regulation is an interesting theory, but history and practive prove it's flawed.
@Dan_Carpenter  We had a grapphic... but it froze up on the computer.
@NearlyPurple YES IT WOULD.  THOSE ARE ALL RELEVANT.  WHEN SOMEONE IS ACCUSED OF KILLING... VIEWERS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE SUSPECT.
then whom?
@NearlyPurple Because it's unusual and shocking.  When my wife hear it... she was stunned.  If you can't trust a sunday school teacher,
@SSBN659vet oh, c'mon... you're kidding?  A female sunday school teacher who murders a little girl?  That's pretty rare and shocking.
@Hawkeye0071 'cause the captain.. would end up dead.
@Hawkeye0071 Follow the "pirate code": hanging...or buried with head sticking outta the sand.  These guys are evil.
Thanks for the Easter greetings everyone.  Been in Denver last several days working on a Bernie Madoff documentary.
@kenbuck I enjoy the interaction.  We get good ideas from tweets!  And good feedback.
@kenbuck Well... I've been a lawyer for almost 30 years.  I used to be a defense attorney in San Francisco.  Years ago.
@lavelle22 You know what?  Those folks are a bunch of stiffs on the court.  I don't think I'd get along.  And they'd hate me!!!!.
@lavelle22 Justice Jarrett.  Hmmm....that's got a nice ring to it.  Unfortunately, I'd never get confirmed.  Too many skeletons closeted.
@rendale I agree.  He wanted coordinated global stimulus spending... plus combat troops for afghanistan.  He got neither.  Total loss.
@HockeyGuy Exactly... not very accurate... but, for some countries, better than nothing.
@JULIANBRAY I realize that.  The U.S. is probably the only country that would try to stop Pyonyang... but Obama won't.
U.S. and British have sold Patriots (manuf. by Raytheon) to Israel and Japan for their defenses ---can be used to shoot down missiles.
And we sold Japan Patriot anti-missile missiles.  They've deployed them around Tokyo and on their ships.
@chuckiewuckie yeah, we've successfully tested the aegis system.  But we haven't done it "for real"... with some other country's missile.
@CateyeMinty Oh... I disagree.  She's a solid guest with credibility.  She expressed her views a moment ago quite well, as did Doug.
who were killed.  Heartbreaking story.
Good afternoon everyone... though not a good day for our brave officers in Pittsburgh.  Thoughts and prayers for the families of those
tHANKS EVERYONE.  SEE YOU SOON!!!  --GREGG
It's just silly to say something like that.  I'd expect that from a high school student... or William Ayers..
@IRSOS It was uttered by Jim Harper... Cato Institute and Advisory Committee to Homeland Security Dept.
is to enact new legislation.  Otherwise, everyone could break any law... and claim it's unjust.
That is such a lame, overused line: "we shouldn't honor unjust laws".  Thoreau... Ghandi...MLK.   The way to change an unjust law...
Well... that was the quote of the day:  "I don't pay attention to Nancy Pelosi"
@mistahmillz 1.8 million have tried it, according to our Dept. of Health.  That seems like a lot.  I don't think we're hyping it.
Plus... the CIA is hiring.  Wanna job???
The new hot drug among young people called "salvia".  It's easy to get, cheap, and extremely dangerous.
we'll be talking about the G-20 Summit... a new immigration policy to focus on busting employers who hire illegals...
Good mornining everyone.  Anchoring the next couple of hours with the ever-wonderful Jane Skinner.
@Ihaveaglitch Even more... the government has been inept or incompetent in running social security and medicare... which are disasters.
@Ihaveaglitch It's funny... I said the exact same thing to Jane just moments ago.
Good answers.  Thanks
I'm dubious.  Anyone else???
Here's a question: should the government be firing corporate CEO's?  Do we think the government is competent to make strategic decisions?
Good morning everyone.  About to anchor the next couple of hours.  Big announcement by Obama on auto bailout.
Thanks everyone.  I'll be on tomorrow and Tuesday from 11 am. to 1 pm., eastern time.  Tune in, if you can.  --Gregg
@JoeZannino_CT  Abby!!!  It's Gregg Jarrett.  Honest!  I was just talking about Goo with Julie.  Gotta go.  Take care  --Gregg
@JOHNCOSSEL YEAH, PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.  TOO MUCH BAGGAGE.
@JOHNCOSSEL which invites the question... why did they take it in the first place?
The "Queen of Bling" punched my lights out during commercial.  I just woke up!  Okay folks... just kidding.  We like teasing each other.
@JanksMorton Yup.  That's what the professor said.  Pretty good argument.
@rwbeagle I think you're on to something here.
matters worse.  What do you folks think?
Good afternoon.  Got a segment coming up on whether the Government is to blame for creating the financial crisis... and is now making
Thanks everyone.
@chuckiewuckie Those numbers were from non-partisan CBO.  I don't know how you can call a 21 Trillion dollar debt... "fiscal discipline".
@krseberg The Sexting segment hasn't happened yet.  About 5;20 pm
Also... is Obama exploiting a crisis to expand his powers... in the same way he condemned Bush for doing it after 9-11?
Yes... we'll be talking about how to survive a foreclosure.  "Sexting"... and whether teens should be prosecuted for child porn.
Gunna start with Fargo floods.  3,000 evacuated.  Could get ugly.
Good afternoon everyone.  Showtime in 7 minutes.  Of course, Julie's not on the set yet.  She loves to make an "entrance"!
@solodadmd Now you're talkin!!!  In a few minutes, I'll be talking with former rep. Tom Tancredo.  I've got the Pelosi sound bite teed up!
@Alec_Wasserman oH SURE.  "A KICK" IS SHORT FOR "A KICK IN THE PANTS".  AND SOME OTHER THINGS!
@Greg814 Welcome to Sam.  Dominica is a kick.  And c'mon... Julie's the greatest.
Well... I think most Americans blame all of them: AIG execs, their lawyers, Geitner, Dodd, Obama and all of Congress.
@Bayou9000 Class warfare???  Huh?  I don't think we're stoking it.  Sorry... I just don't see that.
@fcthetruth I wouldn't dare tell Hannity to do anything.  By the way, he's one of the nicest persons you could ever meet.
@JoeZannino_CT I don't think so.  He's a smart lawyer and hard working.  I've always had high respect for him.
@JoeZannino_CT I agree.  Too many scandals.  His AIG scandal, Countrywide scandal, and Irish cottage scandal.
Good afternoon.  I'm up and twittering.
@understandblue  Thanks!  They were all good guests.  We had fun.  Nice variety: psychologist, detective and lawyer.
@RakuArtist  I like your commets.  Thanks, Nancy!
and use your comments.
Heading downstairs to "Strategy Room"... our webcast on foxnews.com     Tune in everyone --if you have the time.  I'll log on
@Carolyn44 I'll take a look.  Thanks!
@EdLivonia I'm not.  I've gotta look into that.
Not to mention my 2 daughters' clothing.  And their other merchandise is great!!!  Go Target.  I'm a big fan.
@Greg814  I LOVE Target.  I cannot tell you how much money that store has saved me.  Most of my wife's clothes are from Target
iT'S OUR WEBCAST ON FOXNEWS.COM   JOIN US!!!
@MadDog2009 OKAY... YOU JUST MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD.  THANKS!	bYE EVERYONE.  GOTTA GO.  I'M ACHORING "STRATEGY ROOM" TOMORROW AT 2 PM. EASTRN
emerge healthier.  Not guaranteed.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  But often it does
@Hawkeye0071 absolutely.  all corporations can reorganize.  Rid themselves of toxic debs (derivatives)... shed obligations... and
@Hawkeye0071 I plan to sip green beer.  Happy St. Patty's
answer.  AIG is a financial black hole.  It will suck all our money into oblivion.  Anything with connected with Maurice Greenberg is toxic
Nice to see 2 congressmen from different parties on the same page with AIG.  Let 'em fail.  Wont' be easy.  But reorg is the only sensible
Okay... Julie's no longer wearing a toilet seat around her head.  Today is a tip 'o hat to the Irish.  Looking forward to St. Patty Day!
Julie's collar on her jacket looks like a toilet seat!!!  Bye everyone.
a bit of an edge now and again.  But heck... that's human.  It's real.  Why hide it?
@JOHNCOSSEL My producer said in my ear... that I was "stern and pedantic" with Cong. Andrews a couple weeks ago.  Hmmm... I guess I do have
it again a few minutes ago.  Why don't you ask your viewers.  He rubs me wrong.
@lg245 Rob Andrews.  He just strikes me as smug and arrogant.  There he was "lounging" on camera.  And he loves flippant answers.  He did
my producer is asking me to be nice to congressman andrews in a few seconds
I've spent time (just visiting) in the MCC.  Awful place.  The Toombs.  Smells bad... looks bad.  Just the place for Bernie.
@fhall9600 His new best friend is a guy named "Bubba".
Dahmer wouldn't look at them.  Neither would Madoff.
I put him on a par with Jeffrey Dahmer.  Dahmer did the same thing when his victims (family members of victims) spoke in court
Wonder how he likes his change of circumstances
Good afternoon everyone.  Day 3 for Bernie Madoff
Gotta run.  Thanks everyone.  --Gregg
@RonCop I just started.  She's been doing it for a long time
@messageboardusa If you're under the limit and can qualify under the distress plan... sure.
@mikewheelock That's exactly what should be done.  If it was, I doubt money for pork odor would be approved.
@grampa1936  naw... but it feels like it sometimes
@craigblanton if i can squeeze it in, I will.   But I think my producer would frown on it.
@kidranger Hey good for you!  Stuff happens to all of us.  We can't cry in our soup.  We have to keep plugging away!!!  Hang in there.
Lord of the Rings.  That's what I was trying to recall
@craigblanton same thing at my house.  computers rule.
@TAllen73q  I think the White House may be guilty of fear-mongering to scare people into accepting programs like healthcare.
@Todd_H_225   She is MANY things!   All good.
@wind4me   It's X-rated... but she keeps us laughing.
@craigblanton   probably not.  the sylists "spritz" my hair so much it would survive a hurricane
@boinkity   I'll take it!!!
@lawatha Thanks!!!   I've got a long way to go.
Bawdy
Afternoon.  About to begin.  If only you all could actually hear Julie's conversation minutes before air.
@calhounctygop nope.  impeachment is only recourse.  But it's early.  let's give him a chance.
Thanks for the twitter support on the Cong. Andrews exchange.  I'm still doing a slow burn.  Guy was a jerk.  Typical of many on the hill
ok... that congressman really P____ me off.  And he's typical of the arrogant members of congress who could use a reality check.
I gotta go.  Anchoring Fox Report tonight at 7, eastern.  Later.  Thanks everyone for your nice notes.  (Tweets)
There are a lot of people in this Administration... who are not ready for prime time.
@krseberg AWFUL.  And part of the problem is... she cannot possible justify or explain her contradictions.  Indefensible.
@krseberg Yeah, the White House has to do better than Romer.  She' just not up to the job.  Her writings are smart. But on camera she's...
@krseberg She utter lacks convictions.  And she also is on record saying that tax hikes reduce GDP.  So, why is she now endorsing hikes?
@krseberg But now that she has a big job at the White House... she's advocating something she's long argued against.
@krseberg It was too easy.  She was completely lame.  She has long argued that fiscal stimulus doesn't work.
"crisis as deep and dire as any since the Depression."  Balony.  It's fear-mongering to scare Americans into adopting his social programs.
This from a guy who predicted 40,000 Dow for 2008.  There's alot of fearmongering out there.  Much of it coming from Obama... who said:
Jobless rate is not that bad.  Interest rates are great.  Inflation is zero.  Disposable income is up.  He was crying wolf.
@lynj65 Thanks.  You must be referring to my interview with Harry Dent this afternoon.  I just didn't buy anything he was saying.
@bluedevilmsn well... it strikes me as funny for him to use the term "fiscal responsibility"
But that's what makes it fun... and more interesting, I hope.
Couldn't give Charlie Hurt a free ride.  His column is terrific, as usual... but I've always got to try to balance it out.
@Todd_H_225 thanks.  I'll check with Rove.
@Todd_H_225  Good stat.  Where's it from???
@bluedevilmsn Hah!!!   You're right.  whatever happened to those obnoxious commercials?  I guess they ran their course.
...cause we do.  Why not?  It's soooo goofy.. it's kinda fun!!!
@ChristinaPerk Was that your idea?  Blue?  I think it's hilarious that people always ask whether we intentionally wear the same thing.
@rendale Thanks.  Trace will be back tomorrow.  I'm staying in bed!!!
He's winding down.  Good speech.  Gotta log off.  Goodnight!!!  Thanks everyone
@bobpick because many of them come from the MSM... and "neutral" isn't in their DNA.
I listen to NPR a lot.  It's quite informative... but liberal.  As long as a listener knows that... it's easy to filter out the junk.
@James_McHugh I have heard him.  He's good.
Morning Edition and All Things Considered.  While not "branded" as liberal programs... I think they are.
@weldonj  Well... for the most part you're right.  But Talkers Magazine rankings have Rush at number one... but 2 NPR shows at 2 and 3
Conservatives in the media do better when democrats are in charge.  And vice versa.
@wikiworf Rush's profile will only continue to rise.  And he should send a big "thank you" note to President Obama.
Rush speaks in language people understand.  His public speaking skills are outstanding.  Audience friendly. Sometimes his glibness hurts him
Buckley was a walking dictionary.  So smart... he talked over people's heads.  Very few could understand him.
@bluedevilmsn I think he is misguided.  Buckley was terrific.  But he didn't have wide popular appeal... because he was sooooo intellectual
@bluedevilmsn Well...I think he meant that NPR is "intellectual" discourse... and conserviates need an equaivalent "highbrow" voice.
@duchess_rebecca They tied.
@Romey1 I totally agree.  "Lowbrow" is an insult.  And Derbyshire lost credibility when he tried to deny it.
@craigblanton CNN decided to air Limbaugh... only after we announced earlier this week that we would carry it.  The 'ol "Follow the Leader"
@bobpick good point.  British (some, not all) kind of look down their noses at 	some of the radio talk folks.
that Derbyshire may be wrong in his analysis.
I'm glad we're now seeing Rush... following our guest, John Derbyshire.  Rush is a smart and charismatic guy.  He's the best evidence...
Well... that guy was a bit slippery.  "Lowbrow" and "carny barker" aren't exactly complimentary terms.
About to interview a guy who is a conservative... but thinks Rush is "lowbrow" and hurting the conservative movement.
Geez... I'm finally here!!!  Major computer malfunctions.
I'll try to twitter tomorrow when I'm on FNC from 1 to 3 pm, eastern.
@aka_kristin I don't know if Shep Twitters.  Probably.   But I can tell you this much: he's freeeeezing on the roof.
Strong move.  The lower the expectations... the easier to exceed.  Given Bernanke's prediction today... recession will be over this year.
Reading thru an advance copy of President's address.  2 strategies: justifying his economic recovery plans... and setting expectations low.
Sitting on the set... backing up Shep who's "live" on the roof of our Washington bureau anchoring for Fox broadcast stations.
Thanks everyone.  I'll "twitter" again soon.
@Aggie1138 I'm having a good time.  It's been fun
@realitybitesbck Well put.  That's exactly it.  His behavior was reprehensible.  He was lucky to stay outta jail for obstruction.
It is not disrespectful to refer to the President as "Mr. Obama" after first referring to him as President Obama.  Most newspapers do same
@mightyquinninky Yes I did.  I referred to him as Mr. Bush.  Our official protocol from Brit Hume... is that Mr. is acceptable.
@brettcisme Ah yes... April of 1991.  Ted Lewis was my cameraman.  Good memory.
@IRSOS Great point.  Guys like Gates and Warren Buffett love to argue for higher taxes.  To them... it's Monopoly money.  To me... it's not
firefighter & nurse... filing jointly would make more than $ 250,000   With kids and a mortgage... they can't afford more taxes.
@jamesn1982   Plus... I don't think $ 250,000 is "wealthy".  Depends on where you live.  In New York... that's a firefighter & nurse pay.
@PattyMarkle Good memory!!!  Court TV.  I had a great time there.  Thanks for remembering.
Naw... it's a critic's copy of Slumdog.  They hand 'em out like lollypops
One of the members of congress I'm about to interview... is running late.  Having to juggle stuff.  But the Geraldo interview is good. .
a Dutch fan??   Wow... that's great!
My guess on Obama, Kazport: tortured math.  I don't think it can be done.
Show begins in 2 minutes
Okay.  I'm here.  First time.  Stick with me folks.  I don't really know what I'm doing.  Julie's giving me a crash corse.  We're on set.
