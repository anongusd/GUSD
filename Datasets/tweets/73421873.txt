It;s beyond obvious that liberalism and TDS are dangerous mental illnesses to our society.  Many of us hated every single thing Obama did from a political standpoint, and he stoked the racial fires, but we did not wish ill on him personally.

Ralphie's kind of a weirdo. We forgot we left a wide open bag of his food lying sideways on the floor and he didn't even touch it. One of my other Jacks I let roam was found in my kitchen sink, eating two cherry pies. Ralphie's a pill, but he leaves everything alone but his toys.

@nooil4pacifists That said, I do take triptans for true migraines, after 10 yrs, was finally talked into Botox, which as a biologist I detest, but works, take old school meds for tension headaches...I have not had a day without a headache in 30 years. Have to determine what kind I am coping with.
@nooil4pacifists @RantyAmyCurtis Agreed, as my father is a landlord.  But he is pro #2A.
@nooil4pacifists The only think that works is benzodiazapines, and with Ohio law, only certain doctors are not permitted to prescribe them.  I genetically was tested, and triptans and the new muscle relaxants don't metabolize properly. So my pain manag. dr strongarmed a psychiatrist to prescribe.
@DWCDroneGuy That was my initial thinking, but @nooil4pacifists makes a good point on the landlord's contract and whether it's legal to have a firearm.  Still pi$$es me off.

@zanshi1 @mcneilfarms I actually meant the opposite. I knew I needed to get off of here once I took painkillers.  I am currently facing South, and whenever I do that, for some reason my brain says I am facing North, so I think I'm on the East side, when I am closer to Easton. See why I liked Red Eye?

It' child's play.  I have to walk it up this stupid slight hill.  So I drive my bike to Easton, pick up the path there and ride into Westerville, where it's all flat.

The bad part is the only muscle relaxant that works is valium, and in Ohio, pain docs cannot prescribe for pain. He'd love to, as it's less addictive than opioids, but he can give me plenty of those. But a GP can. WTF.

Sleeping wrong sets it off.  So I have been doing real pilates to keep a strong core from a ballet trainer before it was a "thing." It's the only reason I can do stuff.

I landed on the small of my back tripped by an opponent in basketball, but it was just sore. In batting practice a few weeks later, it was like electricity going thru my body.

And what was the reason for this to happen? I have never found a credible answer why so many Somalis needed to come to this country. They were not seeking sanctuary.  Why?

Further, why dump in Middle America rather than New York or big coastal cities where most immigrants enter? Hmmmm...where is it easier to get guns?  They've now migrated from OH up to MI which is a mess. N OH and Michigan rampant with Sharia Law.  Sick stuff &amp; Bush knew about it.
Began noticing it when teaching in the mid-2000's. First, NCLB was implemented. Then in Columbus, OH, tons of Somalis were dumped. Half their HUGE families dumped in St Paul, MN. No preparations made. Look what's happening in MN. Keith Ellison. Sharia Law. We're not far behind.

@ShannonPoe I believe 'i said something happened to her or she believes it had, in a later tweet.  My issue is what the hell does 'credibility' mean these days? I think you and I are mostly on the same page, as usual. Semantics are an issue here, and it is central to the case &amp; reporting.

Why the heck am I on twitter at 11:30 on a Sunday night?  Got some sleeping to do.  Night all. https://t.co/xb4RlpKwO9
@ShannonPoe I think she believes something happened to her &amp; perhaps something did. Or maybe she has mental illness. Or both. Something is off here, and she was nothing more than a pawn to her handlers. Her regressive therapy reveals are inadmissable for a reason. I can't call her credible.
@ShannonPoe As a survivor myself of sexual assault, I forget nothing about it. I also smile at inappropriate times out of nervousness. So my question becomes the definition of credibility. All of her sources of back up have refuted her claims. That's really all I care about at this point.
@ShannonPoe I am troubled when I hear it's "her truth."  She acted very bizarrely---giggling &amp; smiling--almost immediately after describing what was supposed to be the most traumatic event in her life. I get people have different reactions to trauma, but she's a professor of psychology. Odd.

We're fine hear. Twitter miscommunication. We all agree just had separate ways of conveying it. No biggie,  it's over.
@del_vol @SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Especially when we agree.  That's what was frustrating to me, Del.  We're all on the same side here.
@SassyInfidel @del_vol @Ranger3079 @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi And I was being sarcastic, silly.
@del_vol @SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi I asked to be left out once it was clear my initial rsponse was misconstrued. I was trying to get out and end my part in it to dial it back. Sorry my sarcasm was misunderstood. I would hope you knew I have respect for your knowledge. Sorry for letting you think otherwise.
@SassyInfidel Well aware of this.
@SassyInfidel In other words, I am being punished for being a conservative who was backed by other conservatives.  End story.
@SassyInfidel Neither am I.  I suspect they're fucking with me because I had at least 5 of us yesterday report a person for contacting me publicly when it is illegal to do so, and we were all told our feelings were hurt but no rules were broken.
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Like now.
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi I'll remind you of that sometime.
@SassyInfidel Nope.  All I really want is to protect my damn tweets.  I do it, it works, and all of a sudden it stops.  I quit.  I'm out for the night and I will be tweeting much less.  Maybe more RTing and leave it there. Serves multitudes of purposes.
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi I never would anyway.  It's the easiest way to convey a thought quickly here.
@SassyInfidel *sigh*
@SassyInfidel Have you ever run into trouble locking down your account?  I protect my tweets properly, and log back in and they are unrprotected.  Did the same with total lockdown, same result.  I am attemptng to protect myself to zero avail.
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Which was my original comment by inserting what was supposed to be ONE tweet using sarcasm--something you use regularly, as do I--- to agree with both of you.  And it turned into....whatever it became.
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi OMG, leave me out of this thread.  I misspoke by turning it around.  Bottom line, CAIR and MB  are financially connected to damage Christiands, Americans and other enemeies.  Over and out.
@del_vol @SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi And I never remotely said you didn't know.
@Ranger3079 @SassyInfidel @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi I would respectfully suggest next time, read the tweet, take a breath, and consider what was said.  I used saracsm to agree with what those of us like you and I and Yvonne know as common knowledge.  Because we pay attention, like most in this group do.
@del_vol @SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi There is not enough in 240 characters to describe how complicated it is. Again, I agree with you.
@Ranger3079 @SassyInfidel @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Ranger, I was agreeing with you &amp; Yvonne.  Relax.  I understand the situation as well and have studied it for years.  I just thought it was fairly common knowledge to those like you, Yvonne and myself that CAIR funds them.  Sorry for offending both of you. Sarcasm is my thing.
@del_vol @SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi There is nothing clear cut about it.

@RitchieJodi I get that totally.  Our bod gives us warning signs when we need to be or our stressed.  Seriously, if you freak too much, give me a call.  Even if you don't have anything specific to say.  K?
@SassyInfidel Um, you don't know the circumstances and I'm not going to air it all publiclly.  I gave specific points, my plan to deal with it and potential requests.  End story.
@SassyInfidel I apologize.  You don't need to say anything.  I am fine.  I am just happy we already established a one-on-one rapport because you are someone worth knowing.  ;-)
@SassyInfidel I don't care if I get followed. But I was targeted last week and then unfollowed this week.  I normally don't care, but when I keep getting told what a great family the Crew is, it's a little much to take. It's teenage behavior. That I do not need. Sadly, I wasn't going to leave.
@RitchieJodi You hanging in there?  How's the tooth feeling and more importantly, how is your husband?  You know how to get me if you need to talk.  üíï
@SassyInfidel It's like high school all over again, and frankly?  It's stupid.  I have much more serious matters to be spending tme on.  That said, I need to get off this place to take care of my head and eyes.  Talk soon, sweetie.
@SassyInfidel It's fine. I am glad I speak to you individually, as well as another,  but I have lost a chance to develop that rapport with some of the others and am now uncomfortable with a few I trusted implicitly.
@SassyInfidel Sad part is after speaking to one in question, I would not have wanted to leave.  But the decision was made for me.  I clearly have caused a headache when I have not purposely had a bad word for anyone in the group. Just questions.  Oh well.  Less time on twitter.  Which is good
@SassyInfidel a few days to decide what to do. It prevents me from seeing real tweets directed AT ME. But he took it as 'get me out.' I specifically asked to let me deal with it first so he could stop being playground monitor. I am clearly not a good fit for the family &amp; it saddens me.
@SassyInfidel A couple unfollowed me. No explanations. Others wouldn't respond to simple hellos. I thought it was retaliation for certain people beiing removed last week. I told Del &amp; Ranger it's tiring getting 600+ notifications of "likes" from people who want nothing to do with me &amp; I needed
@SassyInfidel Let's just say I am thinking again.  And seeing I have a vast background that can be used for good, and will also help me get my toes back in the water toward a real job again.  Trying to find a niche for my talents &amp; training.
@SassyInfidel Has not included me.  I told him yesterday I was considering leaving the group if you read your DMs from yesteray you'll see what I am talking about.  I asked him to give me a few days to determine on my own whether I was being shunned by some or if twitter was screwing with me.
@SassyInfidel Everywhere.  In everything.
@SassyInfidel The idea would be to first work with the principal who gets it, do the legal research, check the fire codes, and get a presentation together on her behalf. Then volunteer my time at staff meetings or school board meetings to make the presentations and get the word out.
@SassyInfidel Have you noticed Del removed me? I specifically told him to let me have a couple days to figure it out 1st so he wouldn't have to be a babysitter. I spoke to one in question and felt better about it; hope he misunderstood. Sad. I want to keep in touch or get to know the others.
@SassyInfidel The Interim Chief made all his workers happy after the previous chief retired.  Politics played a role, according to my neighbor cop friend, in him being places back at the Asst Chief position.  #shame
@SassyInfidel It's a start.  It makes me angry that MY school still has dumbass teachers prop open doors so they can go in and out as they please in such a widespread one-story 2,000 student building.  So if I can volunteer and instruct admin &amp; teachers, I will.  It will get my brain moving.
@SassyInfidel The school shooting/active shooter/working in govt buildings struck nerves that got me thinking.  And the coordinator is all for me working with the one principal who has security down pat and no time to get her techniques in writing, plus the legal/fire code fact checking. I do.
@CHIZMAGA Threaten to leave if any employees make divisive political statements of any kind.  Period.  And put it in writing you come to the gym for a release from stress, to leave the world behind you for an hour or two, not to have it shoved in your face.  To the CEO &amp; Manager.

@SassyInfidel Sadly not at this point.  I am hoping that will change.  We just had a change in chiefs, so if politics do not get in the way, maybe they will. I might, if I am still here when they do it, attend and critique it from a legal standpoint.
@SassyInfidel Yes, it really does.  It's the highlight of my week, and the chief and the coordinating officer, who was SWAT for 19 yrs, commander for 6, have adopted me in a sense.  We are now working on how I can help with a school safety plan for active shooter situations with my background.
@SassyInfidel My city works with another suburb because they are smaller and are not as well equipped to teach. No one even knows about it &amp; they couldn't tell me when the next would be. W'ville has 2/yr for 3 mos each &amp; they have waitlists. Excellent community outreach &amp; education for crises.
@SassyInfidel ;-) No, because I lived there for 20+ yrs, taught there, live 5 mins away, and because my chief knew with my background, I'd have a lot to offer, both personally and professionally.  Last week's SWAT program was outstanding. The way they collaborate with jurisdictions is awesome.

@ShannonPoe Last time I bought Nike was when "Just Do It" was a thing because Michael Jordan was influenced by being cut by his high school team.  They were boys' high tops for basketball.  He was intelligent enough to not alienate half his customer base. But he also had mad talent. #smart
Keeping in mind I had previously taught high school, the behavior of teachers had become reprehensible, but it always had been, just not so publicized. But those I spoke of who turned their lives around and could not get licenses would have been great role models. Really sad.
Used to work for OH's AG's Edu office &amp; one of my duties was to pull the licenses of teachers who "displayed conduct unbecoming." Sad part was the sheer number. Sadder still was those who made mistakes in their youth who turned their life around were denied licenses. Depressing. https://t.co/xRYG69KYEz

@Ranger3079 @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Me first! Proud to admit it.  Although my feet are small.
@Ranger3079 @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi WIsh I had seen this earlier.  I ended up calling you Del.  I definitely needed that nap.  Soon I pray.  There are certain nights I dislike closing my eyes, even if I'm tired.  Wacked out dreams of late.  Rare REM sleep.
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Another reason to not watch @QVC, tho I can proudly say I never purchased any of his items. Funny thing about the whole #NFLHawking going on there today. What team sold out first?  The Cleveland Brownies--1 win in 2 yrs! I had great fun making fun of my dad &amp; bro for being fans!
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @cher No bad. Yes good.  ;-)
@SassyInfidel @Ranger3079 @del_vol @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @cher Caught it before you mentioned it.  I was lookig at the beginning of the thread.  Ranger knows he means the world to me and, I am pleading the fifth on whether I took muscle relaxers for my back spasms.  Which is usually when I stay off of here.
@Ranger3079 @del_vol @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @cher Sorry, meant to say Ranger, my good friend---a word I do not throw around.
@Ranger3079 @del_vol @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @cher Awww, thanks Del, you're going to make me cry. It's been a roller coaster the last few days.  Please when can I get off this ride? And no lectures about jumping off, Yvonne!  ;-) Nah, things will be fine. Glad tomorrow is my Police Citizens Academy tomorrow. Higlight of the week.

@Furrystoat @KimsInAmerica @tsickles321 @angusmacferret @Walter_lars @mcneilfarms @Cross1818 @MBCompanyMan Perhaps @POTUS ought to consider @Furrystoat rather than Erik Prince....
@SassyInfidel @del_vol @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Ranger3079 @RamBoPirate @TrakkerJane @Tabasc0NGinger @RitchieJodi @RickInTennessee I will NEVER forget that image of her handlers tossing her into the vehicle like a (very heavy) sack of potatoes.  https://t.co/Zqb2kJR6IO
@del_vol @nycjim @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Ranger3079 @RamBoPirate @TrakkerJane @Tabasc0NGinger @RitchieJodi @RickInTennessee @SassyInfidel Agree Del.  Personally, I believe they already know exactly who it was and revenge will be served as a cold dish whe it's soooper inconvenient for said person.
@del_vol @KStiffers @SteamGigi @Ranger3079 @RamBoPirate @TrakkerJane @Tabasc0NGinger @RitchieJodi @RickInTennessee @SassyInfidel If final jeopardy, I'd put it all on the line for the General.

@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC I didn't see it that way.  My mom did though.  I like his comic relief.  And the occasional times he showed how human he was.  Ziva was awesome.  She wasn't afraid of Tony, she was in love with him. She was afraid of love after her family life. That was my take anyway.
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC @AtkinsDiet_ @chelseahandler Ruh-roh!  See you around!

@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC I stopped watching when Tony left and they killed off Ziva.  I have tried to watch it since, but it just doesn't work for me.  I love movies (pre-Hollyweird snactimony), but my various TBI's keep my attention span from working well enough to stick with one unless I know it.
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC @AtkinsDiet_ At least she can point to her age and potential senility.  #Maybe  Alyssa and @ChelseaHandler have zero excuses except perhaps al-kee-hal.
@QVC Expect a slew of returns in the near future. I don't boycott as a general rule, but come on, both @NFL &amp; @Alyssa_Milano combined? It's too much.  Have you learned nothing from the flag protest backlash? At least @AtkinsDiet_  had the sense to drop Milano when she went nuts.
So a few of you know about my insomnia &amp; subsequent QVC addiction for 20+ yrs.  I often keep it on for background noise but buy a lot I could buy in stores now. Today they are hawking @NFL gear AND one of the designers is the one &amp; only @Alyssa_Milano. Buh-bye @QVC!
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC I have every episode memorized to the point where I cannot watch reruns any longer.
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC @AtkinsDiet_ I know nothing about @QVC's ownership.  Time to do some research and letter writing/phone calls in protest.  I doubt they will alienate as many people since most of the viewership is women.
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC @AtkinsDiet_ Like no one would see that coming.  Might be stupider than @Alyssa_Milano!
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi @NFL @Alyssa_Milano @QVC They have a couple lines of clothing, makeup, skincare and shoes I adore, and can get them more affordably through them.  Their customer service is top notch.  But seeing this just about made me puke and I have nothing in my belly.  I'll just go back to reruns of Forensic Files.

@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Back at ya.
@SassyInfidel @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Ah, I only use my PC for social media to keep from getting addicted.
@SassyInfidel @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Not nervous. Filomena got treated badly &amp; was very upset. I ended up getting blocked by the Mean Girls who got her suspended because I continued talking to her after they realized I wasn't "one of them" i.e. Tolerant Black Libs &amp; were offended I was willing to translate. #Ironyü§£
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Yes, I do.  And I'm not doing what you think I am.  But thanks for why you are saying it.  üòÄüíï
@SassyInfidel @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Chrome translator.  And occasionally I'll hit the translate under the tweet, but that NEVER has translated a thing for me.  Go figure.
@Furrystoat @tsickles321 @angusmacferret @KimsInAmerica @Walter_lars @mcneilfarms @Cross1818 As a youngin' this song is what hooked me on Aerosmith...became a pseudo-groupie once I could drive. BUT, if you want to equate effeminite with Steven Tyler, feel free, lol. Joe Perry is my honey, has the same effect on me as @MBCompanyMan.
@SassyInfidel @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Yeah, apparently not all the time.  It's not like I'm deterred.  She knows I'm trying and appreciates my efforts as most English speakers aren't willing to take the time and she will reciprocate and it doesn't make sense sometimes.  No biggie.
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Golly gee whiz, Mom!
@SassyInfidel @KStiffers @TrakkerJane @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi I do, and that's the translator I use.
@KStiffers @SassyInfidel @TrakkerJane @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Yep, close but completely opposite of what I tried to say.  LOL!
Ah geez, I don't want to know. https://t.co/3zvwgHM0aC
@SassyInfidel @TrakkerJane @KStiffers @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Exactly.  Belle owns not only the American English language, but the saracasm she uses is masterful. Never occured to me.
@KStiffers @TrakkerJane @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Ruh-roh!		I'm speaking cartoon Great Dane now.  I so hope I never offended my poor friend.  We generally speak in trading photos of pretty things.  I probably confused the hell out of her though.  LOL!!!!
@SassyInfidel @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi In person, in groups, I am shy as f*ck.  So I became a teacher to surly teenagers and became a lawyer later.  Took my fears head on but still make myself physically sick before I have to  do any sort of speaking.  I'm not shy amongst friends.
@TrakkerJane @KStiffers @del_vol @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Eso me hace sentir mejor. No es que tuviera raz√≥n para saber ...  üòÄ		Tell me @KStiffers, please, did the translator work for me there? I am always worried when things might get mixed up in translation.
@KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi I'm also a little envious.  I got A's in French and all, but I am too shy to speak it out loud, so I can (or could, since it was so long ago), read it.  Writing I had to work at more than any other learning experience.  Wish we started earlier back in the day.
@KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @SassyInfidel @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi Thank God, Bell!  If I started to have to readyour tweets in THAT VOICE, my dear, I would definitely have to mute you!  üò±üò±üò±üò±
@SassyInfidel @indiucky @KStiffers @del_vol @TrakkerJane @Ranger3079 @SteamGigi @Tabasc0NGinger @RamBoPirate @MTJRenegade @Bobbietita @RitchieJodi You don't know the voice I was using as I said that...I enjoy self-deprecating humor so much so that it's only in good fun.  Just like I make blonde jokes when I put my foot in my mouth or state the obvious,,,,ü§£
