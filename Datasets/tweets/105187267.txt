@MikeMadden Mike, my next response is going to be to CC Devonte Graham, Malik Newman and the ghost of Wilt Chamberlin on all subsequent articles. You have already raised my alert level to near panic.
@MikeMadden My body hurts.
@MikeMadden Here are some other reasons:	- Coach Donahue coached Cornell to a sweet 16.	- Coach Donahue came about as close as humanly possible to leading Cornell to a victory over a kind of similar KU team in Allen Fieldhouse in 2010.	- Current Penn team has a roster with 21 players (!?)
@MikeMadden Mike, it could happen. I hope it does not, but it definitely could.
@MikeMadden I ... definitely fear this. They should be closer to a 13/14 I think. Top analytics guys give it a non-insignificant chance. I am fearful. I am a Jayhawk, therefore I am fearful.

@CoachCraigYL Also, the foul disparity was approx 10, total. Which included 2 techs on Huggins and 3 late game extending fouls. And WVU plays a certain way. But you know.

Thoughts on Kansas v. Oklahoma: 1) Trae Young is amazing (but also oversaturated) 2) KU lost, but Malik Newman's emergence is basically more important to their long game. 3) Poke-a-Doke percolating now, not March, means we might develop a counter.

@ishaantharoor Also, among our centurions, how many can say two of them came after mazy dribbling, followed by falling flat on their faces, followed by elite finishes? Only one Theo Walcott!
@ishaantharoor When fit, he was as dynamic and fun and electric a player as any under Wenger. Maybe an English Freddie Ljundberg or Overmars. Which is not bad company. And his loyalty made him stand out.
@ishaantharoor Theo dividing opinions to the last! Yes, for sure on Arsenal. On Theo, I have always felt that when he was on the verge of a big breakthrough, and a level up, an injury clipped him. Makes me sad, but he also brought me great joy.
@ishaantharoor He is viewed as flawed or a failure to reach his potential but it is largely because no one accepted him for what he was, instead wanting an English Henry.
@ishaantharoor Respectfully disagree with this take. Arsenal have ... issues.Theo wasn‚Äôt one of them. He is one of like 20 people to score 100 goals for Arsenal. Many of them massive. Big injuries twice robbed him of his peak. Still a resilient player.

@TheM_L_G (sitch being: Mendy down, Danilo clearly not yet rated, past history of moving CMs to problem spots)
@TheM_L_G I meant given the situation. And Pep‚Äôs background. But I haven‚Äôt gotten my 280 characters yet.
@TheM_L_G I‚Äôm going to stop, I think we almost agree but maybe are just disagreeing on the likelihood or Delph as a protagonist. https://t.co/49S1HMo2dn
@TheM_L_G Did I say it was planned? Cmon. No. My (narrow) pt is that Pep finds most utility in CMs. So I‚Äôm not as surprised as you, is all
@TheM_L_G Er, points. My pet is a cat named Thierry.
@TheM_L_G I think my pet would be: when pressed Pep falls back on a CM skill set for problem positions and also it‚Äôs not more surprising to be than LC
@TheM_L_G There‚Äôs also some precedence for that (freezing and then reulitizing) and clearly Delph would not be playing if Mendy hadn‚Äôt gone down.
@TheM_L_G Or played them out of position and turned them into really impactful players.
@TheM_L_G I forgot you are the only one who is allowed to know things about soccer. Look at Pep‚Äôs career, he‚Äôs turned a lot of CM‚Äôs into wingbacks
@NutmegRadio It‚Äôs our midfield, is the issue. Until we buy a third CM or resuscitate Cazorla (or Wilshere) won‚Äôt have the man power for a match like this
@NutmegRadio Not to say City didn‚Äôt deserve it, or some such but we weren‚Äôt shamed. We competed. I wish we had started Lacazette.
@NutmegRadio Like, we got beat. But we created chances. Ramsey could have equalized. We had a bit of front pedal before really bad offside call.
@NutmegRadio I am not as depressed by this as I should be? We played okay. Fought. Coquelin was the wrong call but Mert or Holding surely much wronger?
@TheM_L_G Delph has always been on the cusp of decent, Pep always pretty desirous of 9 midfielders. It doesn‚Äôt really surprise me.
#Arsenal let‚Äôs not pretend like this fixture is hallowed ground. I‚Äôm old enough to remember Gervinho scoring a consequential goal at Eithad.
@NutmegRadio Both had the effect of killing an interesting game. It‚Äôs infuriating.
@NutmegRadio I thought it is given maybe like 3/10 times.
