House Democrats have just introduced the most detailed plan yet to move the country to #MedicareForAll. @ddiamond and I discuss what happens now! https://t.co/lHkITaDsYP
@PhyllisBennis @RashidaTlaib (Sidebar: you know you're at a @busboysandpoets event when a Congress member giving an impassioned speech is interrupted by a girl loudly asking "IS THIS VEGAN?")
@PhyllisBennis @RashidaTlaib Jayapal says she'll soon be reintroducing her bill to ban the government's use of private/for-profit immigration detention centers.
@PhyllisBennis Immigrant family separations another big issue at this town hall. @RashidaTlaib touts Oversight Committee's new subpoenas for Trump admin documents on it, which the majority got 2 Republicans to support.
Activist @PhyllisBennis asks lawmakers to back cutting the military budget to pay for Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Pocan agrees, saying Pentagon budget is a "good source" for an "awful lot of money." But says other ways to raise $, including financial transaction tax.
@dmondoak The food/coffee are very good as well! Worth a visit even without an event.
Jayapal asks crowd to pressure more members of Congress to cosponsor #Medicare4All. They're at 107 cosponsors and want to get up to at least 150-160. https://t.co/5DZA3TDASF
@USProgressives @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Jayapal says first hearing on #Medicare4All will be at the end of March (in the Rules committee). Then in Budget committee after that. Still no guarantee of hearings in the committees needed to bring the bill to a vote.
@USProgressives @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Jayapal emphasizes that services available under #Medicare4All go way beyond those under today's Medicare, including mental health, vision, dental, and abortion (by repealing the Hyde amendment).
@USProgressives @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Jayapal highlights the inclusion of long-term care in #Medicare4All. Says the basic principle of the policy is "everybody in, nobody out. No co-pays, premiums or deductibles. We want you to go see the doctor when you're sick!"

#Medicare4all has officially been introduced. Now the real fight begins.  https://t.co/5DZA3TDASF
It's called #Medicare4All but it's really different from Medicare as it exists today. The program would charge NO premiums/copays/deductibles and it would cover way more services (dental/vision/abortion/long-term care) https://t.co/5DZA3TDASF
The House #Medicare4All bill will be introduced TOMORROW with more than 100 cosponsors. But whether it will get a vote (or even the hearings needed to tee up a vote) is not yet clear https://t.co/5DZA3TDASF

He said he learned from the ACA's shaky rollout that these kinds of national overhauls should be phased in over time. "I believe in the power of incremental change and learning as you go."

@KamalaHarris But groups like @NationalNurses say endorsing anything less than #Medicare4All is a capitulation before the debate has even begun https://t.co/hQrl0VO2YV https://t.co/xpaZJ83KC8
.@KamalaHarris took fire this week from the right and left over her (very common) position of calling for #Medicare4All while also endorsing Medicare-for-More. But I imagine every Dem 2020 candidate will have this same struggle at one point or another. https://t.co/hQrl0VO2YV
New polling shows that MOST people believe (incorrectly) that they could keep their current private insurance under #MedicareForAll. When they learn they can't, support for the policy drops **significantly**  https://t.co/hQrl0VO2YV
Part of the problem is that people imagine wildly different things when they hear #MedicareForAll. That explains the pearl-clutching reaction to Harris pointing out that the Sanders-Jayapal model would abolish private insurance. https://t.co/hQrl0VO2YV
Kamala Harris came under fire this week for endorsing both #MedicareForAll and less-sweeping "Medicare-for-More" plans. But guess what? Sanders, Warren, Gillibrand, Booker and Merkley have all done the same https://t.co/hQrl0VO2YV https://t.co/WHhxUkk4gn

@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady @RepGwenMoore @repblumenauer @BillPascrell .@RepLindaSanchez notes that Dems want to restore the slashed $ to open enrollment outreach and navigators. @KaiserFamFound's Pollitz (testifying at the hearing) says polling shows many people still don't understand how/when/where to enroll and are unsure of the ACA's status.
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady @RepGwenMoore @repblumenauer .@BillPascrell now hitting GOP for repealing the individual mandate penalty in their tax bill. "Remember that?" he semi-yells. "You didn't even want to run on it!" (in 2018 midterms)
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady .@RepRonKind asks Robertson if his members would support a Medicare buy-in plan (which many Dems are pushing in Congress). Robertson declines to answer, says he's only here to talk about association health plans.
@MelMcIntire You did jinx the temperature. It's freezing now!
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady @RepGwenMoore Aaaand now we're back to fighting about the passage of Obamacare. @repblumenauer says @RepKevinBrady should be "embarrassed" to claim ACA was written behind closed doors (points to year-plus of public hearings etc).
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady @RepGwenMoore “I am glad to be here,” @RepGwenMoore told the committee, noting that she meant both here at the hearing on preexisting conditions and here on this earth.
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady .@RepGwenMoore used today's hearing to announce that she has been battling cancer for nearly a year &amp; it's now in remission. Moore said she is alive today bc of comprehensive insurance that covers most of the $10k+ in medication costs per month that she now needs.
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady ACS also hits the Trump admin for cutting funding for navigators who help people enroll in the ACA marketplace. House Dems will likely vote this year to restore that funding but it's unlikely the Senate &amp; White House will go along.
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady The American Cancer Society is now testifying, telling lawmakers that the cheap, short-term plans the Trump admin now allows are leaving many people vulnerable (they can exclude coverage of preexisting conditions) https://t.co/8MjbSQurFD
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady Rob Robertson with the Nebraska Farm Bureau is now testifying, calling on Congress to make it easier to set up Association Health Plans that don't comply with Obamacare's regulations. The rollout of these plans has...not been smooth. https://t.co/nHq6qLiiW4
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady The ACA pushed millions of people to enroll in the marketplace using carrots (subsidies, coverage no matter your health status!) &amp; sticks (individual mandate penalty for going w/o insurance). Congress repealed the stick, but the carrots are still working  https://t.co/T7sjFosWBw
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady But as experts will tell the committee today, protecting preex is about much more than "guaranteed issue." It's about getting enough people into the marketplace to make coverage affordable https://t.co/CYaXx4tXpa https://t.co/rk3nMBoNIM
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady Brady told reporters last night that if the ACA were to be struck down in court, Congress would come together "within a couple hours" to pass a bill protecting people with preexisting conditions. (This alone is debatable based on how we've seen them respond to other crises!)
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady That letter here: https://t.co/hPkkQyWTdd
@RepRichardNeal @RepKevinBrady Ironically, Brady's letter to Dems ahead of this hearing says: "Congress needs to focus on the future, not the past" and "It's time to stop debating the past."
@RepRichardNeal .@RepKevinBrady's opening statement describes Obamacare as "failing" millions of people and laments that it was written "behind closed doors" and passed with no Republican votes.
@RepRichardNeal The House has already voted (twice!) to intervene in this lawsuit in defense of the ACA. That case could take a year or more to work its way up to the Supreme Court, putting the issue squarely in the 2020 debate. https://t.co/69FXiPbZei
.@RepRichardNeal's opening statement hits GOP for "ongoing sabotage" of the ACA via a lawsuit by 20 Republican AGs (backed in part by the Trump admin) that could eliminate Obamacare entirely
Republicans, meanwhile, are dismissing today's hearing as political posturing that could prevent the possibility of bipartisan issues on other health care priorities, like drug prices &amp; surprise billing
The question for Dems now is whether to stick to focusing on protecting &amp; strengthening Obamacare (issues where the party is in near total agreement) or to begin a contentious fight over #Medicare4All https://t.co/fxALIhIPHW

Now I’m a sort of church rave for Abrams in Conyers, Georgia and it is *lit* https://t.co/Qe51hGzteW
Abrams mentions her opponent Kemp’s voter purges. Crowd boos loudly. Abrams channels Obama: “Don’t boo, vote him out!”
Abrams gives a shoutout to Dem Attorney General candidate Charlie Bailey, saying he will take Georgia off the anti-ACA lawsuit on his first day in office.
Abrams says Medicaid expansion is personal for her. Talks about her brother’s struggles with addiction and undiagnosed bipolar disorder, who only got proper care in prison and couldn’t get insured when released. Crowd is riveted.

@TereKirkland Do you think the "you should decide what happens to your body, not the government" message will resonate with them? Or anti-abortion beliefs override that?
Do you live in West Virginia, Alabama or Oregon? Let me know what you're seeing on the ground from the campaigns for and against the abortion restrictions!
A majority of West Virginians have said in polls that they oppose abortion, so the campaign against this year's ballot initiative is framing the question as one of gov overreach into your personal medical decisions https://t.co/g74zNRPh9B
Of the 3, public polling only exists for Oregon, where the proposed abortion restriction is set to fail by a wide margin https://t.co/g74zNRPh9B
Even if the anti-abortion measures do not pass, their presence on the ballot could boost turnout for conservative candidates in tight midterm races https://t.co/g74zNRPh9B
Voters in Oregon, West Virginia &amp; Alabama are set to vote on whether to ban or significantly limit access to abortion, &amp; the laws now have a much greater chance of being upheld with Kavanaugh on the court. Here is where things stand:  https://t.co/g74zNRPh9B

This morning, the Trump admin argued in federal court that it is **not** denying all immigrant minors in its custody the right to an abortion, b/c they always have the option of voluntary deportation. The @ACLU did...not agree. Full write-up coming.

Rule also says immigrant children can be transported across the country together with adult strangers "if separate transportation is impractical or unavailable."
New rule also seeks to get around the current requirement that immigrant children be held in **licensed** childcare facilities by "creating an alternative federal licensing scheme for such detention."
(REMEMBER: All of this will be open for public comment before it takes effect)
Admin is also arguing that the definition of an "influx" of immigrant youth into the country means they should be allowed a more flexible timeline for putting them in an age-appropriate environment rather than the current 3-5 day timeline.
The admin is also seeking to broaden the definition of an "emergency" that would allow them to delay placing an immigrant child in an age-appropriate environment, feeding them meals/snacks, or allow other "noncompliance on a temporary basis."
DHS also says they will treat any undocumented person they encounter who is younger than 18 years old and who does not have a parent in the country as "unaccompanied" and will transfer them to HHS for indefinite detention.
Among the changes, DHS will no longer release immigrant children to live with a sibling, grandparent or other relative, and will only allow release to a parent or legal guardian.

.@NHeLP_org legal dir. Jane Perkins, representing the Kentuckians, called the lawsuit a failed intimidation effort: "Should the Trump admin re-approve KY's harmful Medicaid waiver, our clients can consider their legal options w/o fearing the retribution from their governor."
TLDR: The judge says if Bevin un-expands Medicaid, that's on him. It can't be legally pinned on the lawsuit that took down the waiver. (This came up a lot in the DC case https://t.co/tF136UI74c)
Bevin tries to argue that he will be "forced to un-expand Medicaid" if he doesn't get his waiver, bc it would be so expensive to provide without it. The court isn't convinced that would be the fault of the 16 low-income Kentuckians challenging the waiver. https://t.co/fuApSZnNzl
The judge ruled that Bevin's lawsuit against 16 low-income Kentuckians "does not explain how the Commonwealth would be injured" by their challenge to his proposed Medicaid restrictions.
KY's GOP gov Bevin keeps losing in court on Medicaid. As a federal court in DC struck down his work requirement, he countersued the plaintiffs in a KY court. That lawsuit was just thrown out.

@janaprikryl @ACLU I don't believe so. Immigrant children have their own right to due process. I am curious, however, to know what happens if their expressed wish conflicts with their parent's expressed wish.
@janaprikryl @ACLU Good Q. Parents and children have different and potentially competing asylum/reunification rights here. I haven't yet seen an example of a parent demanding one thing and a child demanding another but that could happen. Any lawyers out there care to weigh in?
@janaprikryl @ACLU By law it's the parent's choice, but yes, it's an incredibly harrowing one. Some children have other relatives in the U.S. who can sponsor them, but not all do.
@ACLU Basically, the @ACLU is trying to argue that the migrant families are entitled to all the due process steps that would have happened if they were never illegally separated in the first place. Whether the court will order some parents to be returned to the U.S. is unclear.
@ACLU Also, the @ACLU argues that children who have a legitimate asylum claim have the right to have a parent with them as they go through the process.
@ACLU The @ACLU and the Trump admin will be back in court tomorrow afternoon. The vast majority of the hundreds of still-separated families can be swiftly reunified in their country of origin. At issue is a small number of parents who want to return and pursue an asylum claim.

@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @SenatorDurbin @KHNews .@SenatorDurbin is now challenging ICE official on their claim that more than 100 parents knowingly waived reunification with their children, citing reports that many parents were misled/coerced/pressured to do so. https://t.co/w17gdyUyMC
@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @SenatorDurbin @KHNews Senior ICE official tells senators that child detention centers are "like summer camp."

@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @SenatorDurbin .@SenatorDurbin also slamming Rs for using the term "catch and release," which he calls: "Comparing catching children to catching fish."
@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @tedcruz @JohnCornyn .@SenatorDurbin calls on DHS Secretary Nielsen to resign. 		"Someone has to accept responsibility." "We can be safe without treating children like terrorists."		Then bashes GOP colleagues for pushing for the repeal of the Flores standards for children in detention.
@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @tedcruz @JohnCornyn Both Grassley and Cornyn have called the system of paroling immigrants "catch and release." Many feel this term, which comes from hunting and fishing, is inaccurate and dehumanizing.   https://t.co/DqbY79osH7
@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @tedcruz .@JohnCornyn slams his colleagues for citing/trusting media reports about family separations, says the facilities he toured were "well-managed." (Not only has abuse been extensively documented, doctors say no matter how good a facility is, separation causes trauma in children)
@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein Feinstein says she is working on a narrow bill with @tedcruz to prevent family separations in the future. Says they are close to an agreement and she hopes the bill would have bipartisan support.
@ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein .@SenFeinstein now citing the dozens of children who remain separated because the parent is alleged to have some kind of criminal record, though some of these records are extremely low-level and some are just arrest warrants, not convictions. https://t.co/pfUbGsnDAq

@ChuckGrassley Grassley says the "easy" solution to family separations is to repeal the Flores settlement, which says children can't be held in immigration detention for more than 20 days &amp; sets minimum safety standards. The Trump admin is already violating Flores.  https://t.co/1kAH5yruRT

@mbrendzel That's a good question. There have been a lot of reports about the failings of foster care oversight lately...
@ACLU DOJ attorney Scott Stewart hits back at the @ACLU: "The government takes issue with the assertion that there is a mess on the ground. We have many reasons to be proud of this effort."
@ACLU Now Trump admin argues that the separate lawsuit by 17 state attorneys general against the family separations will make it harder for them to have the resources to give the @ACLU the info they need in this case.		"I do not have any comment or observation," Judge Sabraw replies.

@ACLU .@ACLU is now pleading for the judge give reunited families 7 days to talk to lawyers before being deported: "Talking to people on the ground, things are really a mess. We desperately need 7 days to counsel these people."
@ACLU Another thing the Trump admin says they don't know: how many kids have still not been "matched" with the parent they were taken from. The last count of this category was 37 but DOJ attorney just said she's not sure if that's still the number.
Still, the Trump admin says they are on track to reunite all "eligible" families by the court's Thursday deadline. Then they and the @ACLU will argue over those they've deemed "ineligible."
Trump admin not knowing things is an emerging theme in this hearing! So far they don't know: 	-how many parents were deported	-whether they signed up for "voluntary departure"	-whether they were deported with or without their children
Trump admin says there are 260 children who are undergoing "further evaluation." "It may be that parent was released and we cannot locate him or her," DOJ attorney says.
Trump admin claims that 127 parents waived reunification with their children. That number was higher a few days ago. "My understanding is that some have changed their mind," DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian tells the court.
Trump admin says as of today, 1,012 children have been reunited with their parents. Can't answer how many are now in family detention and how many have been released on parole.

MORE NUMBERS from the Trump admin just announced in court. They have not yet said why some parents were not cleared, how many have already been deported, etc. https://t.co/bwkXFJndUe
NEW: Trump admin admits in court that it can't find the parents of 71 children older than 5 years old that were separated and being held by the government.
Sabraw concludes his several-minutes long excoriation of the Trump admin with: "Reunification can happen quickly and safely. Those two things are not mutually exclusive. HHS is responsible for this and can do it well."
Reminder that this judge is a Republican appointee who has been very friendly to the Trump admin so far (didn't hold them in contempt after they blew the first deadline for kids under 5), but he seems to have lost patience now.
Sabraw accuses Trump admin of "inviting a process of delay at the expense of children and parents." He then scolds them, saying: "HHS is a defendant in this case. HHS’ mission is the interest of the child. It is failing in this context."
@ACLU Now Sabraw is TEARING INTO the Trump admin for arguing that the court is putting the immigrant kids in danger by ordering swift reunification with their parents. He calls this argument "completely unhelpful" bc gov is the one that "improperly separated parent and child."
NEW: The @ACLU wants a restraining order on the Trump admin to stop them from deporting families right after they reunify them, without due process. Judge Sabraw grants them a temporary stay preventing the deportations while the gov files a brief opposing that request.

HHS says they're using cheek-swab DNA testing to match immigrants parents and children separated by the Trump admin, claiming they don't have time to find/verify birth certificates to prove parentage. https://t.co/um2hDes4wv https://t.co/EAoI06lYoy
Azar told reporters today that the immigrant parents are criminals for bringing their children in the first place, and repeatedly suggested that many are only claiming to be parents and are in fact unrelated to the children taken from them.	https://t.co/VRRaftDyoy
NEW: HHS says it will meet court deadlines to return immigrant children to their parents, but they have yet to reunite a single family except to deport them together https://t.co/um2hDes4wv https://t.co/8qOp0qvieh
Asked about reports of documented abuse/neglect of immigrant children in HHS custody, Azar dismissed the stories as part of the "theater of politics" and "not correct." Here are some of the allegations: https://t.co/ELEsEM6uak
As for numbers, Azar testified to Congress last week that he had just over 2,000 separated kids in his custody. Today he told reporters there are "under 3,000" and that 100 of them are younger than 5-years-old. The court says those youngest must be reunited next week.
HHS Sec. Azar repeatedly circled back to blaming the parents themselves for the separations, saying the "surefire" way to prevent them was not to attempt to cross the border in the first place.
(There are obviously a lot of privacy concerns about the government/private contractors collecting the DNA of thousands of immigrants) Officials on the call said it won't be used for any other purposes but didn't describe what measures are in place to prevent that.
They also confirmed that they ARE DNA testing parents and children (with a cheek swab that is sent out to a private contractor). They say the court deadline makes this necessary since they don't have time to verify parentage through documents like they usually do.
Sec. Azar spent a lot of time on the call slamming courts for "micromanaging" and putting an "artificial" deadline on the reunifications, saying it will prevent them from conducting thorough background checks of the parents/other family sponsors.
BREAKING: HHS Secretary claims to reporters that they **will** meet federal courts' 1-month deadline for reuniting children taken from their parents at the border, but they have made almost no progress so far (other than a handful who have been deported with their parents)

The Senate Republicans @cam_joseph and I talked to today are all 👏 over 👏 the 👏 place on what to do about the family separation crisis on the border. Tonight;s visit from Trump to Capitol Hill could make things worse. https://t.co/lLL8gFu9Tc https://t.co/BG1QWrJjlZ
@swin24 @ENBrown Are you near Sperryville? Go to @WasmundsWhisky!
The only thing Republicans agree on right now is that they will not support Democrats' bill to end family separations. Here is our story: https://t.co/lLL8gFu9Tc https://t.co/NDSIBYqmmh
Main takeaway from talking to Senators today: Republicans can't even agree on whether Trump should temporarily halt family separations while they try to pass a bill, let alone what should be done long-term. Stay tuned for mine and @cam_joseph's story.

@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen @ACLU @SenFeinstein .@SenJeffMerkley says Democrats won't let the president use the immigrant children as leverage to pass a "horrific" immigration bill (The House may vote on 2 very conservative bills this week)
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen @ACLU .@ChrisVanHollen supports @SenFeinstein's bill to stop family separations but says Congress have to go through a long legislative fight. Says Trump can/should step in now.
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen @ACLU .@SenJeffMerkley and @ChrisVanHollen are blasting the GOP bills to address the family separations, noting that they would overturn laws that protect children from being incarcerated for long periods of time. (Cruz and Cornyn's bills would do this)
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen @ACLU .@ChrisVanHollen says DHS secretary Nielsen's representation of the border situation is "total fiction" based on his visit to the border crossing ports and shelters.
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen @ACLU .@SenJeffMerkley says the child detention centers are "wildly understaffed," especially lacking mental health professionals to work with the thousands of traumatized kids being held.
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen @ACLU .@SenJeffMerkley says the gov's system for keeping parents and kids in contact does not work in practice. Logistical and language barriers abound. (Many of the asylum-seekers are indigenous)
@SenJeffMerkley @ChrisVanHollen .@ChrisVanHollen notes that the admin is lying when they say that those who seek asylum at ports of entry aren't separated from their children. (The @ACLU has a whole lawsuit about cases of that happening)
@SenJeffMerkley .@ChrisVanHollen says his visit to the border confirmed his worse fears. Saw children and parents put in separate pens. Says he was barred from talking to the kids, but talked a moms who did not know where her daughter had been taken.
@SenJeffMerkley .@SenJeffMerkley: "Jeff Sessions has changed the definition of what qualifies as asylum." Fleeing gang violence no longer qualifies (impacting thousands of Central Americans &amp; others).
.@SenJeffMerkley briefing reporters on his visit to family detention facilities on the border. He says families are being blocked by US authorities from presenting themselves at ports of entry to legally seek asylum. They're sleeping on the streets for days trying to get in.
I asked @BillCassidy if he wants Trump to suspend the child separation policy until Congress can work something out. He says yes. Asked if he’s told the WH or his colleagues that. He says no bc “it’s understood.”
.@SenatorCollins blasts Trump’s family separation policy as “inhumane.” Most other Republican Senators aren’t willing to criticize. @SenatorWicker said Trump should “look into” changing the policy.

@sangerkatz @ddiamond They previously said states could not give Native Americans an exemption bc it would be an illegal racial preference. Now they're saying states can give an exemption if they choose.
My question is, what happens if a state tries to force its Native American residents to comply with a Medicaid work requirement? They have sovereign rights and (for example) never had to comply with several Obamacare rules.
But on Medicaid work requirements, which will kick tens of thousands of people off of their health care in several states, the Trump admin is all in. 	https://t.co/9fha3rv0qQ

@SeemaCMS She also was very adamant about supporting states that want to impose Medicaid work requirements. She said several times that there are a lot of jobs available and people are not filling them.
@SeemaCMS Verma did comment on many other things. She indicated it was unlikely that HHS will restore funding for open enrollment outreach (Trump admin slashed by 90%) and said due to rising premiums she believes enrollment will dip no matter how much the gov spends.
@SeemaCMS She said she couldn't comment on pending litigation (the case goes before a federal court in June). I was hoping she would respond to the lawsuit's argument that work requirements violate the purpose of Medicaid (to provide affordable health care to low-income people).

@wendythurm Would love to hear more of your thoughts! My e-mail is in my bio if you want to connect.
DOI added some career staff to that board late last year, but only after the Inspector General started investigating.
1 VERY interesting piece of report: the board that selects officials for reassignment is supposed to be a mix of non-partisan career staff &amp; political appointees. When they decided to push out a few dozen officials last year, it was all Trump admin appointees calling the shots.

@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn Republicans try 1 more time to get Trump to endorse putting concealed carry reciprocity in the bill. He reiterates that it should be considered separately.
@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) calls for lifting the ban on federal research of gun violence. Trump responds "thank you very much," doesn't endorse idea.
@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn Trump reportedly adopts the view of the last person he speaks to, so everyone in this meeting is fighting to be the last one to speak.
@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn "You're going to be more popular, if that's what you're into, if you pass background checks," Trump tells lawmakers.
@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn "Take the firearms first and then go to court," Trump suggests for the dangerous and mentally ill. "I like taking the guns early...Take the guns first and have due process second."

@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn Trump continues to dunk on the lawmakers meeting with him today: "Some of you people are petrified by the NRA."
@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn Rep. Mast strokes Trump's ego, calls on him to push Congress to act: "You can lead on this in a way nobody else can."  		Trump brags that NRA has "great power over you people, less power over me."
@JohnCornyn @MarshaBlackburn Begs the question...what is Baron up to?
@JohnCornyn .@MarshaBlackburn takes convo in a different direction, focuses on violent video games and movies. Trump cuts her off, agreeing: "I get to see things you would be amazed at. I have a very young son. These things are really violent." Calls for a special "terror" rating for media.
@JohnCornyn !!!! Trump cuts of Scalise, says maybe concealed carry reciprocity should be separate because it would tank the overall bill. "You'll never get it passed. We want to get something done."
@JohnCornyn Just as Trump is pushing Republicans to "add in" gun control policies recommended by Feinstein and Klobuchar, Cornyn swoops in, cuts him off, calls on Steve Scalise, who suggests concealed carry reciprocity (more guns).

@JohnCornyn Toomey says he "doesn't touch" the age issue in his bill. Trump snaps: "You know why? You're afraid of the NRA."
@JohnCornyn Trump asks Senator Toomey if his bill raises the minimum age to purchase an assault weapon from 18 to 21. He replies that it doesn't but tells the president he'll do "whatever you want" on the question.
Even Republicans acknowledge that the promises Trump is making to support gun control bills may soon evaporate. https://t.co/LnAp1tHvfv https://t.co/srJNSKYfuI
@JohnCornyn Trump responds that Cornyn's bill should be "much more comprehensive."		"Add everything onto it and maybe change the title," he suggests.
In meeting with Trump, @JohnCornyn urges action on his bill to better collect data for the gun background check system: "Leaving this town and going home empty-handed is not acceptable."
@SenFeinstein Reminder that what Trump promises in this meeting could quickly change. Last time he held such a meeting he promises Feinstein he'd support a "clean DACA bill." https://t.co/m3SezRbmtp

@CPAC @ChrisMurphyCT LaPierre also uses @Emma4Change's "I call BS" refrain. This time, it's for criticizing the FBI.
@CPAC @ChrisMurphyCT LaPierre laments "the shameful politicization of tragedy" moments after warning that Democrats are preparing an assault on "individual freedom" and urging people to call the NRA for advice on school security.
@CPAC He calls out @ChrisMurphyCT, but does not mention that the survivors of the shooting are themselves calling for gun control and criticizing the NRA.
NRA Exec Wayne LaPierre at @CPAC on the #ParklandSchoolShooting: "As usual the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain. The break-back speed of calls for more gun control laws in the midst of genuine grief."
