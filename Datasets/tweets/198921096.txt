News announcement, for the Republican Party character does matter who runs for highest office in America. ...
I like hole Donald Trump digging for himself and also for the Republican party. Do you think you need a white majority to elect you. OMG.
King James do not get so cocky that you have won the championship for "Land" as yet. Things can happen my brother.
Officiating last night for game six was awful for the Warriors but King James can continue to lead with his forearm. What is up with that?
Warriors will win game despite King James heroics on the court.

Serena is now taking over the match by leading 3-0 in the third set . She is playing her usual style with a player who is determine to win.
It must be difficult for Black republicans to continue support their party with Donald trump as their Presidential candidate.
Serena has no movement with her feet for chasing the tennis balls in  this match. She is making too many unforced errors.
Serena is playing comeback tennis in the French Open with her opponent. She is not got her timing game on.
Will the Republican leaders continue to play the game "Follow The Leader"?
