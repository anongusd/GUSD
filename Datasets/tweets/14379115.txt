Q8 - To ignite culture, move aware from values (aspirational) and go to potential factors - what is it that makes people successful at your company, regardless of position, division or geography? Drive recognition around those factors and you'll ID value and culture #mercerchats
@mellyjellie @Mercer_US @Google and the mob goes negative on them for work life balance!  Damned if you do, damned if you don't....
Q7 - the biggest lie the devil ever told the world was the companies can drive culture without focusing on culture in hiring. You've got to define what your culture is and make sure hires - especially managers of people - are aligned. #mercerchats
Q6 - this one is simple.  Answer the question "what is in it for me to work here?" rather than trotting out values and mission statements.  Profile your people as you answer that question, and don't be afraid to talk about negatives.  #transparent #authentic #mercerchats
Q5 - remember in the recruiting world that someone else's like of pay equity is your opportunity to steal great talent.  #justsayin #mercerchats
@TamaraMcCleary My bias - is that Gen X is the greatest generation... :)
A5 - As a Gen X guy, I tell my friends who run their own shops that it's time to get out of the cave. Comp based on equity from the start is now a requirement and candidates view this as a key component to Employer of Choice, especially as you go higher on food chain #mercerchats
A4 - If you're looking to invest in the future of work - understand that reaction to change is key. Behavioral profile for key people (you define that, go as far down as you want - Low Rules Orientation (can deal and thrive in Chaos), High Details (can execute) #mercerchats
@sarbjeetjohal @TamaraMcCleary spoken like someone who watched the Golden Knights last night!
A3 - I can make the argument that at least 5% of your total investment needs to be in the coaching/business/change skills of your managers, because unless they are optimized, your #futureofwork will not succeed to the level you desire... #mercerchats
A3 - for me, whatever your strategy in the #futureofwork, all have a need to get better at preparing their managers of people to drive change and performance - with today and tomorrow's workforce.  Investment in this area is still too low. #mercerchats
A2 - The higher the intellectual property component of a given workforce, the more companies need to invest in talent/people.  For high IP businesses, it's the same thing as a capital investment.  Some companies miss this in the #futureofwork #mercerchats
A1 - for the recruiters out there (even if you're a manager who needs talent), looking current on the #futureofwork is great for your manager brand and employer brand as well.  #mercerchats
A1 - need a strategy that accounts for today and tomorrow.  Future of Work strategies important today since industries and segments of the workforce will transition to future states at different speeds.  #MercerChats

Listening to @JenniferMcClure at  #WorkHuman talking #metoo issues at the drive in stage.  It’s easy to see she does a lot of executive coaching as part of her practice.  She’s unwilling to let HR people simply tag people as ineffective or toxic... gotta bring data...

Update from #workhuman. Diet Coke was spotted off to the side of the lunch floor.  Rome was the mob, and #worhuman attendees demanded Diet Coke.  Are you not entertained? @VadimsViews @JenniferMcClure
Ed from GPTW... key factor in great place to work- innovation by all... ideas can come from anywhere.  My take is that leaders eager to recognize those ideas as coming from others always get the best ideas from their teams vs their peers....#workhuman drive in stage
Listening to ed Frainhiem of GPTW at the Drive in stage at  #workhuman my take- too much noise in the gptw space, Ed’s org is the gold standard.  Sorry I can’t spell your last name Ed, I never could....

Cy Wakeman is a smart, smart person.  The hard part for HR leaders in eliminating ego and drama in the workplace is transferring her techniques to the average manager of people.  Possible?  Yes.  Hard? Yeah.... #WorkHuman
@IncentIntel I’m 90% probable to send you 3% of those total stats.  #workhuman
RT @mfaulkner43: BMW driving - bitching, morning and whining. When your ego is in control. @CyWakeman #WorkHuman
Cy wakeman research shows that average worker spends 2.5 hours on drama, complaining Anas b****ing (my word, not hers).  Buy that number? #WorkHuman
Cy on vent sessions with angry employee- average length 45 minutes.... that’s why you have to get them back to taking personal action.... #WorkHuman
Listening to Cy Wakeman talk about difusing drama and venting at #WorkHuman she recommends asking “what does great look like” to those venting to diffuse and get them back to action.

@lruettimann I like the kid. Well spoken, gun control and an FBI father?  Sign my moderate ass up!  But partial info given on school application and taken shots at institutions?  meh.   I’m not mocking, I think he’s misinformed on the school front or taking opportunistic shots, not whining.

Great question from the crowd on yahoo and IBM pulling back from remote workers. Good answer related to people wanting a blend... #NEHRA2017
@DawnHBurke Or you don't like remote workers, so you comment ASAP if you hear a dog or other human on their audio.  That will show them!! #nehra17
@DawnHBurke Or your f2f synergy (laughter in conf room) drowns out their ability to talk.  #nehra17
@DawnHBurke Or they dial in but you don't.  Whoopsie!  #NEHRA2017
