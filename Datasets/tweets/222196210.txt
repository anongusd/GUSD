Please take #PTSD seriously. We owe every brother and sister in law enforcement to recognize/address physical AND mental injuries. #FOP17
Sharing our story well starts by never saying “no comment.” Speak. Tell our story. Lodges can take the lead. #crisiscommunications #FOP17
Colorado has taken the lead on #PTSD coverage and we’ll share the Colorado model moving forward. #FOP17
Many states don’t offer coverage to police for #PTSD without an accompanying physical injury. We must fix this! #FOP17
Its a crisis because it emboldens violent action against police who seek to protect our communities. #crisiscommunications #FOP17
In #CrisisCommunications we’re hearing about the additional challenges police face, including negative portrayal in the media. #FOP17
#PTSD is the silent police killer. It’s dangerous and police need to take mental health challenges seriously. #FOP17
