Consistent with all that is critics, reporters and voters forcing those with radical ideas to reckon with policy / pragmatism / process challenges. But the dynamic of how movements shape politics and public policy is key to understanding what‚Äôs happening to Dems right now. ~fin~
Of course, we don‚Äôt know how the climate story ends. But we know major social change (you may think it‚Äôs good or bad) is often incubated by rabble-rousers who demand something from their own side that‚Äôs called radical/unrealistic in real time. Nothing about this is unusual.
Seven years later, DACA has consensus Dem support, is popular with most Americans, and Trump is struggling to kill it. Easy to forget that it didn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum. Activists berated the Obama WH until it gave in. Today, climate activists are using the same playbook on Dems.
An analogue to Feinstein and the kids: DREAM activists gave first-term Obama hell &amp; demanded relief (for eg https://t.co/BsignuvbMr). It irked establishment Dems who saw it as counterproductive and told them to target Rs (much like DiFi defenders today).		And then it led to DACA.

White House @PressSec: ‚ÄúPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action ‚Äî including a national emergency ‚Äî to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.‚Äù
What‚Äôs the limiting principle in Trump‚Äôs national emergency to fund a border wall?		Does it preclude‚Ä¶		A national health emergency to fund a single payer system?		A national climate emergency to finance a Green New Deal?
National emergencies have been declared in the past, but over nonpartisan matters like 9/11 and Ebola. Using it to achieve a partisan policy goal is a daring new precedent that worries plenty of Republicans.

Matt Whitaker gives no indication that DOJ will drop its support for litigating to undo Obamacare in light of Trump's recent promise to protect preexisting conditions.		He suggests that's the president's call.
Matt Whitaker says he doesn't know how many kids have been separated from their parents, and refers to HHS and DHS for specifics.
"I participated in discussions about the zero tolerance policy internally," says Matt Whitaker, without elaborating on his role. "It was General Sessions's decision to implement."
"I don't recall today saying that the border region is crime-ridden," says Matt Whitaker. "It would be lower if we didn't have illegal immigration."
Whitaker's response was that he won't comment on litigation, but there was nothing to stop him from speaking about the issue (which is well within the DOJ's jurisdiction) in broad strokes.

Basically, Democrats will support money for various border security items (but not a concrete or steel barrier); Trump can call it a "wall" and declare victory while Dems say it's not a wall.		Question is whether he can accept that or whether he needs them to call it a WALL.
Pelosi lays out an endgame here, saying Dems will give Trump money for border personnel, tech, ports of entry to add to the cliffs, river, fencing already there.		"If the president wants to call that a wall, he can call it a wall," she says.

Kamala Harris's exit music for her 2020 launch in Oakland is My Shot, written by @Lin_Manuel, from The Hamilton Mixtape.
"We know what the doubters will say," says Harris. "They'll say it's not your time. They'll say wait your turn. They'll say the odds are long. They'll say it can't be done."		(Which doubters? Harris is widely viewed as a frontrunner for the D nomination.)
This Kamala Harris line best sums her campaign message: "We treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women's rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself."
A Democrat runs on tax cuts: Kamala Harris says she'll "deliver the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation" and pay for it by reversing the Trump tax breaks for corporations and top 1%.
An interesting line from Kamala Harris in Oakland: "The word 'unity' has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo. When women fought for suffrage, those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace."
Kamala Harris in her 2020 launch speech: "Racism sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia are real in this country, and they are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it."
.@KamalaHarris speaks in Oakland: "Under this administration America's position in the world has never been weaker‚Äîwhen democratic values are under attack around the globe, when authoritarian is on the march...when we have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware."

Thing is, there are immigration issues that divide Democrats and could be an effective wedge for Trump to use ‚Äî ICE, sanctuary cities, guest-worker visas. A border wall isn‚Äôt one of them.
It‚Äôs not much of a mystery. A border wall polls poorly nationwide and in blue/purple areas that House Dems (and the GOP rebels) represent. Add to that an unpopular shutdown that voters blamed on the president and Ds had even less incentive to cave.		https://t.co/zH08RQlIfL https://t.co/tUZKh9zch2

TRUMP issues an ultimatum, saying that if there's not a "fair deal from Congress" by Feb. 15 there'll either be another shutdown or he'll use his powers to address the wall (which sounds like a national emergency declaration).
What happens on February 15?
So 35 days into the shutdown, there'll be a short-term deal with no wall money, which could've been done to avoid all this in the first place.
Trump says hes asked Mitch McConnell to put the 3-week CR on the floor immediately and that federal workers will soon get back-pay.
Trump says the short-term government funding deal is through February 15.
TRUMP: "We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government."
There's no wall money in this agreement, per the 3 sources, but there is a vehicle to go to conference on a DHS bill and debate border funding.
Deal afoot, per three Hill sources: short-term bill to reopen the government for about three weeks.		1st calls it a "tentative agreement," 2nd says they're "zeroing in on an agreement," 3rd says "there will be an agreement." They stress that nothing is final until Trump signs it.

A filibuster nuke might've made sense early IF Republicans were intent on using full control to privatize Medicare and make the 2011 @SpeakerRyan budget a reality. But for a $5 billion wall? Days before Dems take the House and render it useless?
Another reason McConnell likes the filibuster: plenty of Rs (including him) represent states reliant on federal dollars that are tricky for conservatives to defend ideologically. Better to bring home the bacon under cover of bipartisan deals "necessary" due to the 60-vote rule.

Senator Joe Manchin (D) just offered a measure to intervene against the lawsuit that'd nullify Obamacare, which just won a victory in district court.		Senator John Barrasso (R) blocked it on behalf of GOP leaders. He said ACA has failed and bemoaned calls for single payer.

1/2 Reasons to expect shutdown: Trump's dug in on last best chance for the wall; Hill Republicans are afraid to buck him; Dems have no incentive to cave; Pelosi needs progressive votes to become Speaker; it lacks 60 Senate votes; 7 days to deadline, there are no negotiations.

Trump says he won't disclose his tax returns while they're under audit.		IRS procedure is to audit a sitting president's tax returns, so that's his way of saying he'll never release them until he leaves. There's nothing stopping him from doing so.		https://t.co/efZs1rAYgJ
Trump says he doesn't want to release his tax returns, when asked what he'll do if Democrats pursue them: "They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them," he says. "People don't understand tax returns."
Trump won't say if he'll fire Sessions or Rosenstein: "I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. We're looking at a lot of different things, including cabinet... We're looking at different people for different positions." Also hedges on Zinke.
Trump is threatening Democrats not to investigate him by suggesting he'll go after them if they do. "They can play that game, but we can play it better."

Latest #TX23 count shows Will Hurd (R) leading by 689 votes.
Republican senators up in 2020 include Collins (ME), Gardner (CO), Tillis (NC), Cornyn (TX), Ernst (IA). Other than Doug Jones, Democrats have it easier.		You can imagine a scenario where Dems win the WH &amp; House in 2020 but the Senate stays GOP and thwarts the president's agenda.
For Senate Republicans, the value of padding their majority isn't passing bills (it takes 60 and Dems can still filibuster), or judges (it takes 50 and GOP dissent is next to non-existent); it's protection from a rough map in 2020.

In other words, House leaders appeared to recognize the political danger in weakening pre-ex rules even as they pushed to repeal much of the ACA. But they did what was necessary to pass the bill, which was to undo some of those regs.
The original Ryan-backed House bill in 2017 largely preserved ACA market rules. The Freedom Caucus opposed it so couldn't get the votes. Then came MacArthur-Meadows amndmt that weakened pre-ex protections (to lower costs for healthy people). And then the bill passed the House.

Recent history tells us that if your goal is lower deficits, your best scenario is a Dem White House + GOP Congress, and the worst scenario is an all-R government.
A remarkable trend that continues. Since 1981, the U.S. budget deficit has grown under every Republican president (Reagan, Bush I, Bush II, Trump so far) and fallen under every Democratic president (Clinton, Obama). https://t.co/HKYNTanCfU

But it includes state waivers that open the door for them to charge higher prices and cover fewer benefits. https://t.co/woRgsgAqlJ

Justice Kavanaugh hit the ground running on his first day on the Supreme Court bench, asking numerous questions and engaging in several back-and-forths with lawyers in two sets of oral arguments.
Kavanaugh, sitting on the far right of the bench, was chatting and laughing with new seat-mate Elena Kagan before the session began.		At the end, she shook his hand and he smiled and mouthed ‚Äúthank you‚Äù before the justices left.
Anthony Kennedy is seated in the Supreme Court audience, robe-less, wearing a suit and tie for Kavanaugh‚Äôs first day on the bench.
Just left the Supreme Court chamber. Kavanaugh spoke ~25 minutes into his first session as a justice to ask a skeptical question of a lawyer for a criminal defendant.		His wife, kids and parents were in audience.		No protests or disruptions during the first half of the argument.
Now chants of ‚ÄúWe do not consent!‚Äù and ‚ÄúNovember 6 is coming!‚Äù https://t.co/OwZnYAoDSI
