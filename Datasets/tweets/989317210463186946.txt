Check the receipts and you‚Äôll see that Paul Ryan‚Äôs record proves he‚Äôs concerned with one thing: #welfarereform. He doesn‚Äôt care about farmers or ranchers, and he‚Äôs more than happy to use the #farmbill as a stepstool to achieve what he couldn‚Äôt elsewhere. https://t.co/3hTeCuOPlK

But why let a farm income crisis stand in the way of a conservative economic pipe dream? In a time when farm income is down 52%, crop prices are down 40%, and land values are down 20%, Paul Ryan wants to saddle farmers and ranchers with the bill for #welfarereform.
Ryan isn‚Äôt even sure work requirements will work, saying in 2012, ‚ÄúWhen it comes to job training and continuing education, the current policy landscape is dotted with failed, unaccountable and duplicative programs.‚Äù He cited 49 programs at a cost of $18 billion.

But Paul Ryan loves this #farmbill. Why? Because it‚Äôs a Paul Ryan original. The cuts to Broad Based Categorical Eligibility and LIHEAP, and the imposition of workforce bureaucracy are all components of Ryan‚Äôs past failed #welfarereform proposals.
Throughout his career, Paul Ryan has sponsored bills that would have gutted the federal #cropinsurance program, severely damaged the domestic sugar industry, and reshaped the #farmbill along ideological and unworkable lines.
Everyone knows you write a #farmbill for the bad times, not the good ones, yet throughout record farm income in the early 2010s, Ryan demonstrated a startling lack of understanding and advocated for cuts that would have devastated farmers now that farm income is low.

Paul Ryan helped to seal the 2013 #farmbill‚Äôs surprise defeat on the House floor by voting no, according to him, because of the bill‚Äôs strengthening of risk management and #cropinsurance. About the bill, Ryan said, ‚Äúthe legislation doesn‚Äôt pursue real reform.‚Äù
As Budget Committee Chairman between 2012 and 2015, Paul Ryan proposed more than $686 billion in cuts to vital farm bill programs.
In his 2015 budget, then-Chairman Ryan proposed more than $148 billion in cuts to farm and food programs, including a $23 billion cut to commodity programs, and $125 billion to #SNAP.

In his 2014 budget, then-Chairman Ryan proposed more than $182 billion in cuts to farm and food programs, including a $32 billion cut to commodity programs, $16 billion to #conservation and $134 billion to #SNAP.
In his 2013 budget, then-Chairman Ryan proposed more than $179 billion in cuts to farm and food programs, including a $29.3 billion cut to commodity programs, $16 billion to #conservation and a cruel $134 billion to #SNAP.
Paul Ryan voted no on the House #farmbill in 2013, and instead voted yes on harmful amendments on #trade promotion, crop insurance, commodity programs, #SNAP, crop insurance, sugar and livestock.
As Budget Chairman in 2012, Paul Ryan proposed more than $177 billion in cuts to farm and food programs, including $29.3 billion to commodity, credit and crop insurance programs; $22 billion from #conservation; and a staggering $126 billion from #SNAP.

As the House and Senate came together in 2008 to override two vetoes from a Republican White House, Paul Ryan took the opportunity to vote against the #farmbill four separate times.
Paul Ryan voted against the #farmbill conference report in 2008, saying that ‚Äúour agricultural policies are in desperate need of commonsense reform and this bill fails to deliver,‚Äù and that the bill ‚Äúsquandered yet another opportunity for meaningful reform.‚Äù
In 2007, Ryan voted against the #farmbill, calling it ‚Äúdeeply flawed legislation which delivers no real reform,‚Äù and a ‚Äúsetback for our reform coalition.‚Äù He did vote for amendments damaging #cropinsurance, #conservation, cotton and sugar, though.
In 2001, Paul Ryan voted against the #farmbill on the House floor, after voting to support amendments that would have made drastic cuts to sugar and Title 1 programs.

Farmers have spent decades building demand in places like China and Mexico and elsewhere in Asia and Latin America. That equity is in danger because of the administration‚Äôs reckless trade policy.

When Ranking Member Peterson first got here, we didn‚Äôt have Twitter. However we did have a functioning, bipartisan process when it came to passing a farm bill. We can get back there, but not with partisan and ideological legislation.
