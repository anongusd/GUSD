Cotton, the most vocal opponent, warned that early release measures would endanger public safety. He predicted some Rs would lose their seats over the bill.
Perdue, a conservative Trump ally who has not yet publicly offered his support of the bill, acknowledged he had not been on board with earlier criminal justice bills, but said this one was a good mix.

@JointCenter Some D and R offices argue that the study‚Äôs definition of ‚Äútop staff‚Äù was arbitrary, excluding other nonwhite senior-level aides from the statistics despite their influential roles in shaping and communicating policy in DC and in district offices
@JointCenter And 313 House members ‚Äî almost 75 percent of the body ‚Äî have no racial minorities among their top staff. 		114 of those lawmakers represent districts that are more than 1/3 people of color, including nearly 50 that are majority nonwhite, the researchers found.
@JointCenter Not a single Latino, Asian-American or Pacific Islander, or Native American holds a top committee job or serves as a top aide in one of the four top Democratic or Republican leadership offices.
@JointCenter Just 13.7 percent of top staff members in the House ‚Äî defined as COSs, LDs, CDs and committee staff directors ‚Äî are people of color. That compares with 38 percent of the country as a whole, and 23 percent of House lawmakers.
@JointCenter The top-line: They write federal policy and multi-trillion dollar budgets, oversee a branch of government and shape the public's view of Congress, but even as the House becomes more diverse, the staff members that run it remains remarkably white.

Horowitz will not explicitly say whether or not he is investigating a potential leak of information to Rudy Giuliani in 2016. Says only "Our work remains ongoing."
@Jaime_Elizabeth The Year of the Memo
Horowitz confirms he is investigating Comey's handling of his own memos. Says IG office will issue a report when complete.
Horowitz cont.: "No rule, policy, or practice is perfect, of course. But at the same time, neither is any individual‚Äôs ability to make judgments under pressure or in what may seem like unique circumstances."
He continues: "We found no evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations; rather, we determined that they were based on the prosecutors‚Äô assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice."
Horowitz: "We found	the implication that senior FBI employees would be willing to take official action to	impact a presidential candidate‚Äôs electoral prospects to be deeply troubling and	antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Department of Justice."

"The integrity of the House is at stake," she writes. "We look forward to your immediate action on this subject."
New from PELOSI letter to Ryan:  "Congressman Nunes‚Äô deliberately dishonest actions make him unfit to serve as Chairman, and he must be removed immediately from this position."
No. 3 Senate Republican urges House Rs to slow their push to release a secret staff-written memo. Says Burr/Senate Intel should see it first, Dem memo should come out simultaneously &amp; FBI's warning should be duly considered 		Another one w/@adamgoldmanNYT	https://t.co/k9Md62WLl6
‚ÄúThe vote to release the memo was absolutely procedurally sound, and in accordance with House and Committee rules. To suggest otherwise is a bizarre distraction from the abuses detailed in the memo, which the public will hopefully soon be able to read for themselves."
Nunes spox: ‚ÄúIn its increasingly strange attempt to thwart publication of the memo, the Committee Minority is now complaining about minor edits to the memo, including grammatical fixes and two edits requested by the FBI and by the Minority themselves.‚Äù

"It is now imperative that the Committee Majority immediately withdraw the document that it sent to the White House. If the Majority remains intent on releasing its document ... it must hold a new vote to release to the public its modified document."
Schiff: "After reviewing both versions, it is clear that the Majority made material changes to the version it sent to the White House, which Committee Members were never apprised of, never had the opportunity to review, and never approved."
NEW letter from Adam Schiff just now saying that Nunes made material changes to his memo AFTER the committee vote and BEFORE he sent it to the WH. More TK, but Schiff is arguing that the committee now needs to vote again on the edited memo.

@adamgoldmanNYT Lots of other tidbits here: Trump has not yet read the memo himself. 		In addition to Rosenstein, the memo also mentions Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director of the F.B.I., who has been a frequent target of the president and Republicans in Congress

Warner: "Congress must make clear to the president that firing the special counsel or interfering with his investigation by pardoning key witnesses is unacceptable and would have immediate and significant consequences."
Mark Warner, from the Senate floor, is pushing back hard at Republican's claims that Bob Mueller and co. are politically biased against Trump.		"Those statements are reckless. They are inappropriate. And they are extremely worrying."
Indeed, the Rules Committee has now postponed its scheduled 4pm meeting to consider the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017

Rod Rosenstein addressing a key R hit on Mueller's team: "We recognize employees have political opinions. It‚Äôs our job to make sure their opinions do not influence their actions. I have confidence Director Mueller understands that."
Interesting: Rosenstein replying to Smith charge that there at least appears to be impropriety in Mueller staff choices: "Appearance is to some extent the eye of the beholder. We apply the department's rules and regulations."
Rosenstein in response to Lamar Smith's questioning on Mueller scope: "I know what he is doing. I can assure you that the special counsel is conducting himself consistent with my understanding of the scope of the investigation."
In response to Nadler questioning: Rosenstein says that Mueller took appropriate action to fire Strzok after he learned of texts. He also reiterates that he has not seen "good cause" to fire Mueller.
