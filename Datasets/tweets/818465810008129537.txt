@connie9030 @ktimmons541 @mitchellvii Sensible border security.  There are places where this "wall" makes no sense and there are places where it does. Are you aware there are still cases of eminent domain still being litigated from the Bush administration?
@connie9030 @mitchellvii I don't believe you
@connie9030 @mitchellvii Rubes.....if you believed it was possible to build a giant monolithic wall from one end of the southern border to the other and that Mexico would pay for it then yes you are a rube
@connie9030 @ktimmons541 @mitchellvii He earned the right to be president. He did not earn the right to shut down the government in pursuit of a ridiculous con that he can't get legislative support for
@connie9030 @mitchellvii My hope is that the Dems are against this monolithic wall because it's a ridiculous idea that is never going to happen even if he gets the money. Both parties need to work together on realistic border security solutions not some con job foisted on a bunch of rubes for votes

@connie9030 @mitchellvii And Trump will be lying if he says he wants the monolithic wall built for anything other than to placate his base.
