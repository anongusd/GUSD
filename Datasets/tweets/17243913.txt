@LaurenGoode @chrismessina @gadgetlab I'll give it a listen. Hey, maybe I dodged a bullet by never getting my @instagram handle. Apparently I need some sort of trademark.
My first sitcom pilot was a bust. I poured so much into it, but the writing was a bit amateurish. It never got picked up, but the actors had amazing chemistry. They ended up getting married and are still together to this day. So, it wasn't for nothing.

@synikol6 @DrWinarick @williamlegate @HowardSchultz @KamalaHarris @ewarren @AOC I agree. Last time I looked at data, the majority of citizens supported ACA. Not sure where we’re at with #GreenNewDeal.
@synikol6 @DrWinarick @williamlegate @HowardSchultz @KamalaHarris @ewarren @AOC I like that plan! To be honest, I don’t even know what “Conservative” means anymore; considering our battle is now a fight to retain Democratic sovereignty (and an inhabitable planet) or fall into the hands of authoritarian kleptocrats.
