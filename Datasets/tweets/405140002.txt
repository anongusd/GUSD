Gang violence portion of meeting concluded.
Calo: "this is a pretty emotional night. These tragedies are tearing at the fabric of our community...these conversations need to be had."
Calo shows image of Baltimore community members standing with police.
Kelly introduces people of all colors who have stepped up. "Not just a bunch of white folks, black folks, brown folks. But bunch of folks."
Kelly: "Why do some people have to die before we're motivated to get involved?"
Kelly: When you cross racial barriers, you take it to a whole new level."
Leon Kelly invited to speak, powerful stuff, angry. "We have opportunity to make a statement, to show folks we're working together."
Fleecs: even social media can trigger violence. Cops seeing this around the country.
Fleecs: will bring full weight of law enforcement to bear, but also provide services to help escape gang activity.
Gang bureau Cmdr. Mark Fleecs says agg assaults are double last year. Thousands of gang members, only a few drive the violence.
ATF: science points to a few individuals who commit most gun crimes. "Not every gang member or criminal carries a gun."
ATF: "we know caring is not enough." 2 yrs ago, created crime gun intel center. Works with local police.
ATF rep tells audience, "we care. There is an action plan in place."
Also, now hiring more 911 operators.
Stressing anonymity for callers who give info via 911.
Notification system, hotlines can keep community informed if shots fired.
Leon Kelly has said gentrification has exacerbated gang conflicts as neighborhood demos have changed. Mostly white audience here tonight.
Community communications, 911 system, being addressed. Part of regularly scheduled business.
Councilman Christopher Herndon says violence "hit home personally." Lost a cousin to violence.
Brooks notes mayor's office has committed $300k to gang prevention and outreach. Works with police suppression of hot spots.
Councilman Albus Brooks says killings last night were "punch in the gut" for community.
Standing room only now.
Calo wants folks to leave with "questions answered and fears assuaged."
Cmdr. Mike Calo tells group at monthly meeting that gang activity is "anomaly I haven't seen in a very long time."
About 50 people and counting for the meeting set to begin momentarily. Longtime activist Leon Kelly here, among others.
I'll be tracking Denver district 2 meeting tonight between cops and community. Gang situation on the agenda.

RT @MySecondEmpire: I just checked, and every good Manning-Tebow joke tweet has been made. Took 39 minutes. Good work, people.
Should be a lot easier now to score one of those #TimTebow #Broncos jerseys. Cheaper, too.
They botched the dreaded 3-goal lead, but DU #Pioneers redeem themselves in double-OT against Minn.-Duluth. On to the WCHA finals.
I really didn't think my #mizzou Tigers would choke until the second round this year.

#SportsColumn dismayed, but rockin' to "Livin' On a Prayer."
Well, that didn't take long, #broncos. Sudden quiet at the #SportsColumn.
#SportsColumn mgr Doug Illingworth with his finger on the tv button..."We Will Rock You" blaring...fans going crazy for kickoff.
Correction: Who-dats have it hands down after last Saints TD.

And yes, sports experts, Eric Haave is related to Colorado hoops great Tanya Haave...they're cousins.
Pandemonium at the Sports Column in LoDo...and it's still Saints-49ers. Biggest crowd since, well, since DJ Eric Haave can remember.
