Today is #BlackWomenEqualPay Day. That means that black women have to work until August 7, 2018 to earn what a white man made by December 31, 2017. 		Go ahead and let that nonsense sink in.
With primaries in Missouri, Michigan, and Kansas + the last special election before Nov. 6 in #OH12, today is a BIG day for the Midwest. 		If you're in any of these places, get out and VOTE! Your voice matters; don't let anyone tell you differently.

@MrLowProfile17 If the answer is “yes” to “did they know Larry Nassar molested nearly 200 children” then the answer to your question is also “yes”
