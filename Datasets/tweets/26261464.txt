As with all Rebuild RI deals, these credits are only paid out when construction is complete and the project and receives a certificate of occupancy. Additionally, if the projects realize profits above negotiated returns, the state will participate in those returns.
According to third-party economic impact analysis, the $59 million project is expected to help generate more than 250 direct construction jobs and add more than $2 million dollars to the state’s annual GDP in ongoing operations.
The project is the second phase of a successfully completed project on an adjacent parcel, which opened for occupancy earlier this fall. To help fill a financing gap in the cost of construction, the board approved Rebuild Rhode Island tax credits up to $6 million.
Additionally, the board also approved tax credits for The Edge College Hill II. The project will consist of a newly constructed 11-story mixed-use building of approximately 135,000 SF. The project will create 163 residential units and approximately 9,000 SF of retail space.
ONE Metro Center in Warwick is envisioned as a 75,000 square foot Class A office property, to be split between three 25,000 SF levels. The board has approved up to a maximum of $3,000,000 in Rebuild Rhode Island Tax Credits.

In an effort to share more about the programs, funding sources, and opportunities available to local manufacturers, Commerce and @mfgri will embark on visits to cities and towns in the coming weeks, beginning with the R.I. Leagues of Cities and Towns on May 8.
Manufacturing has been a point of emphasis for @GovRaimondo and the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, working closely with the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association (@mfgri ). The industry is seen as a vital part of the state’s identity and its future.
Innovation Vouchers can be used for support toward commercializing a new product, process or service; access to scientific, engineering and design expertise that fits an innovation need; technological development and exploration to make an innovation come to life.
Tonight's recipients were Bouckaert Industrial Textiles in Woonsocket, and East Providence-based Aspen Aerogels and NuLabel Technologies. The Innovation Voucher program was recently expanded so that manufacturers could do all R&amp;D in-house.
At the CommerceRI board meeting, the board unanimously approved 3 Innovation Vouchers to RI manufacturers. This marks the 50th Innovation Voucher awarded to date, totaling an investment of $2.34 million.
With @Hasbro on board, the inaugural @OceanInno_TF is shaping up to be a great event! https://t.co/Tj2UnyZMNV

Additionally, the board also approved a $13.5M Rebuild RI credit for the Wexford Innovation Complex.
