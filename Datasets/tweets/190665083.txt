@SenJeffMerkley One day we will realize that the Russian witch hunt was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people.
@SenJeffMerkley I have a simple question for Robert Mueller.  How many more lives will be destroyed just because you couldn’t find any evidence of collusion.  You are digging up old crimes and threatening them so they should talk out of fear.  There is NO collusion. Stop this Witch Hunt now.
@SenJeffMerkley FACT: Nothing will take down President Trump.  FACT: Nobody will take down President Trump.  Keep up the hysteria. It’s amusing.
@SenJeffMerkley REMINDER: STILL NO EVIDENCE OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION.
@SenJeffMerkley A vote for the Democratic party in the midterms is a vote for open borders. It’s a vote for the abolition of ICE.
@SenJeffMerkley if you love America And  you want this country to succeed you have to #WalkAwayFromDemocrats , and vote Republican ,Democrats hate Americans

@BillKristol Trump haters said President @realDonaldTrump was Putin’s “lap dog.” Today, after Trump withdrew from the INF treaty that Russia was violating, the same Trump haters accuse him of “destabilizing” our relationship with Russ ia. Please pick one!  #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
@BillKristol Never trust a never-Trumper, especially if they have previous GOP campaign experience!
@BillKristol FACT: Nothing will take down President Trump.  FACT: Nobody will take down President Trump.  Keep up the hysteria. It’s amusing.
@BillKristol One day we will realize that the Russian witch hunt was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people.
@BillKristol REMINDER: STILL NO EVIDENCE OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION.
@BillKristol Another fact, “Never Trumpers” are responsible for the lack of a republican caucus and have given the democrats a fighting chance during this presidency. Knowing this, how is being a never trumper any different than being a democrat?
@BillKristol You guy. s are scared of President Trump and so is the entire leftist party in DC. These lif elong politicians can  NOT allow the people of this country see a non-politician Running this country better than THEY do. This goes for the Never-Trumper  as well.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump did not create the division we see in America today.  Trump’s rise and election is the result of DECADES of Washington D.C. corruption, DECADES of late term abortions, &amp; DECADES of illegal border violations and violence.  We can #MAGA if we choose to do so!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Democrats have destroyed states like New York. Americans in blue states are tired of high taxes &amp; high unemployment.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Don’t be a dummy democrat are so deranged &amp; devious that their plan is to destroy &amp; derail President @realDonaldTrump.   Half of them want him impeached, the other half wants him assassinated.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Dems plan: -Raise taxes -End ICE -Grow gov’t -Impeach the President  GOP plan: -Make tax cuts permanent -Build the wall, secure the border -Cut spending -Reform welfare -Hold FBI accountable  You decide.
