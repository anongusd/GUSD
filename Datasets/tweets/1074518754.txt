We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating lower prescription drug prices in Medicare. President Trump said he supported this in 2016 but has done nothing about it. Washington must act to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
President Trump and Congressional Republicans gave huge tax breaks to the top 1% and big corporations. #BigPharma got billions in tax breaks, announced corporate stock buybacks and hiked the price of medications that Wisconsinites need. We need to take on big drug companies.

We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating lower prescription drug prices for older Wisconsinites. This legislation is a critical reform that will help safeguard the Medicare program and keep our promises to seniors and taxpayers.

I will only support this new deal if we can make it a better deal for Wisconsin farmers, manufacturers, businesses and workers. https://t.co/w5JCJXZzIt
There is still more work to be done in Congress to ensure any final agreement stops the outsourcing of jobs to other countries, strengthens Buy America, puts in place real enforcement of labor provisions, and allows the United States to take action on currency manipulation.
As Congress works on legislation for this new deal I will be working to ensure that this new deal increases market access for our Wisconsin dairy farmers and cheese makers.
Unfair trade practices have harmed our agriculture economy‚ÄîWisconsin has lost 584 dairy farms this year‚Äîand trade wars and tariffs are making things worse. We need to make sure that the USMCA confronts Canada‚Äôs unfair trade barriers &amp; Mexico‚Äôs limits on Wisconsin cheese exports.
NAFTA‚Äîwhich I opposed‚Äîcost Wisconsin thousands of manufacturing jobs and needs to be fixed. Wisconsin needs better trade deals, not trade wars so now Congress needs to do its job and make sure this new deal works for farmers, manufacturers, businesses and workers.
Here‚Äôs my full statement on the ongoing pension crisis for Wisconsin workers and retirees. https://t.co/bWxN1THXJ9

We have more work to do, but I will keep working to support family caregivers because I believe we have a shared responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable health care, and the ability to live and age with support and dignity.

Right now, 40 million family caregivers shoulder the burden of long-term care in America. The cost of uncompensated care performed by family caregivers was more than total federal Medicaid spending in 2013. And as our population ages, those numbers will keep rising.
Today, I‚Äôm thrilled to be speaking at the Elevate Women‚Äôs Summit about family caregiving in this country, and how we can keep working together to find solutions to better support #FamilyCaregivers.

SEC must revisit its rules around stock buybacks to ensure that corporate executives are not boosting the sales of their own stock while ignoring the needs of their companies‚Äô workers. We need an economy that works for workers &amp; not just those at the top. https://t.co/FXUHU7Eokw
It‚Äôs just wrong for big corporations to pocket massive, permanent tax breaks and reward the wealth of top executives with more stock buybacks, while giving workers pink slips and outsourcing jobs.		We should #RewardWork, not just wealth.

It‚Äôs past time to work together in a bipartisan way to lower costs and make sure more people can have access to the care they need. I will keep working every day to #ProtectOurCare.
But our work is not done. President Trump &amp; Republicans are still trying to take health care away, eliminate guaranteed protections and drive up premiums for those who rely on quality, affordable health care.
One year ago today, House Republicans voted for a health care repeal bill that would have cut coverage, increased costs and eliminated protections for millions of Americans. Thankfully, we worked together to stop repeal and protect health care for Wisconsin families.
It‚Äôs National #SmallBusinessWeek! Small businesses are the engine of our #MadeInWI economy, helping to drive growth and create jobs in our communities. Make sure you get out and #ShopSmall this week!

I'm working to put Wisconsin first and do right by hard working, middle class families. This partisan #GOPTaxPlan fails to do that.
Our tax code ought to reward hard work more than it rewards wealth. 	It doesn‚Äôt do that today and it won‚Äôt do that with the #GOPTaxPlan.
This is the #GOPTaxPlan to make our tax system simpler and fairer for you. 		Scrambling and scribbling. 		It will be voted on tonight. https://t.co/3KkdgLAelD
We need tax relief for manufacturers and small businesses to drive growth, and help our #MadeInWI workers.  	The #GOPTaxPlan favors powerful, Fortune 500 corporations and the top 1%.
Update: the Cornyn Amendment is in the final bill. #GOPTaxPlan keeps getting better for billionaires. I will introduce an amendment to eliminate this giveaway to Wall Street. https://t.co/1utZYS9qem
The #GOPTaxPlan will stick 1.2 million taxpayers age 65+ with a tax hike. https://t.co/D1v6KH964C
The #GOPTaxPlan allows Wall Street hedge funds to keep their carried interest loophole. Did they now stuff the Cornyn Amendment in their gift basket to the wealthy on Wall Street? https://t.co/7CGAAanBk0
Lying to the FBI is a very serious crime and Michael Flynn, the former WH National Security Advisor, has pleaded guilty to that. Independent Prosecutor Mueller must continue doing his job in this investigation, unobstructed, so the truth can be revealed to the American people.
Let‚Äôs be clear about what happened on the #SenateFloor. I'm trying to reward workers, but Senate Republicans voted against closing a tax loophole for hedge funds on Wall Street because they want to reward the wealth of their donors.
Senate Republicans just voted to let billionaires on Wall St. keep a loophole that allows them to pay a lower tax rate than American workers. Is it because Wall Street lobbyists, big banks, and hedge funds have such a grip on Washington? #GOPTaxPlan
Let‚Äôs make sure our tax code rewards work as much as it currently rewards wealth. If that isn‚Äôt simple and fair, I don‚Äôt know what is. #TaxReform
I am asking my Republican colleagues to help President Trump keep his promises to the American people, and close this unfair tax loophole for the wealthy on Wall St.
As a candidate, President Trump included closing the carried interest tax loophole in his tax reform plan. I agree, it is unfair and should be eliminated. But this loophole for Wall Street is still in this bill.
Today I‚Äôm offering an amendment to do what this tax plan fails to do: make good on President Trump‚Äôs promise to close the carried interest tax loophole for millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street.
So the #GOPTaxPlan not only gives tax breaks to the top 1% and raises taxes on millions of middle class families. It also increases the deficit $1 trillion. 		Guess who is going to pay for that? https://t.co/qIQYDTgZBV
The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the congressional scorekeeper, confirms that the #GOPTaxPlan does not pay for itself. In fact, it adds $1 trillion, plus interest, to the national debt.
Wisconsin has a proud history of entrepreneurship and innovation.	Recent reports show that we need to do more to support our #MadeInWI start-ups. 	But under the #GOPTaxPlan the top 1% will end up with 62% of the benefits.
#GOPTaxPlan lets Wall Street keep a tax loophole while most Americans earning less than $75,000 a year would see tax increases. That‚Äôs not fair. https://t.co/FYaoPWE9N7

We believe it's not fair to make Wisconsin middle class pay for huge tax cuts for wealthy by increasing deficit, cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid https://t.co/rGfWTD7zEi
If you have a $10 million estate, you get a tax cut from GOP plan.		If you have student loans you lose your interest payment deduction.
I don't think it's right to favor the wealthiest few, big banks, and powerful corporations with massive tax breaks.
The House Republican plan doesn‚Äôt do enough to reward hard work and instead rewards wealth by giving tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%.

.@SenateMajLdr said he wanted to hear ideas on improving health care. @SenJohnMcCain &amp; I have legislation to take on rising Rx drug costs.
Now is the time to work together to stabilize the health insurance market, make health care more affordable &amp; take on rising Rx drug costs.
The message from Wisconsinites is clear: Work across party lines to make things better, not worse.
I joined R's and D'S to vote no because the people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people‚Äôs health care away.
Thank you Wisconsin for speaking out and sharing your stories. YOU are the reason that the #SkinnyRepeal was defeated last night.
I joined Republicans and Democrats to vote against the health care repeal bill last night. This is why: https://t.co/wgefWO2nXB
#SkinnyRepeal is Washington talk for more uninsured, rising premiums, and higher out of pocket costs. I'm voting no for Wisconsin.
When #AmericaSpeaksOut, we can defeat this repeal effort. Join Anna and make your voice heard today!
Anna has Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic condition that weakens her muscles - but that isn't holding her back from speaking out today!
Today I met Anna, a Wisconsinite who is worried about what will happen to the care she has today if the Senate passes a repeal plan. https://t.co/OkzrvNXjZk
Great to meet young Wisconsin leaders from @ALAforVeterans' #ALAGirlsNation17 and @AmericanLegion's #2017BoysNation. https://t.co/txnXexse2f
This is wrong. We should be working to make health care better and more affordable, not worse and more expensive.
No matter what version you look at, Congressional Republicans are proposing higher costs and more uninsured Americans.
There are only hours left of debate on the Senate floor. We can't let up! Don't leave anything on the table. Make your voice heard!
For months, I've heard Wisconsinites speak out and share their health care stories. Today, we need to keep up the fight!
It's not just tweets. This Administration is taking a formal, official stance against the rights of LGBT Americans. https://t.co/Qy3Ifalx0F
Happening now on the Senate floor:	I just voted NO on #RepealAndRun. 	I just voted YES to protect Medicaid.
I've been proud to stand with @AARPwi and older Wisconsinites across the state as we fight against this repeal plan's #AgeTax! https://t.co/yIGLszAf4t
Let‚Äôs work to stabilize the market, make health care more affordable and take on drug corporations' rising prescription costs.
We should be working together to make things better, not worse.
The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people's health care away.
To those transgender Americans currently in the U.S. military, thank you. Your service strengthens our military and our nation.
I stand with military leaders who support moving in the right direction. We shouldn't discriminate against anyone who wants to serve.
A ban against any patriotic American who wants to serve our country is wrong.
On top of that, it'll destabilize the health insurance market and could cause premiums to skyrocket.
It'll stick people with junk insurance and bare bones coverage that does not include the guaranteed protections people have today.
The Cruz plan will raise costs even more for people with pre-existing conditions.
Do you remember the Cruz plan? It will make bad legislation even worse.
The first health care repeal amendment up tonight is the Cruz plan. I'm voting no.
Your stories, your voices drive this fight. Together, we can defeat this effort to take health care away from millions of Americans.
It‚Äôs also personal for every Wisconsinite. I‚Äôve heard from families across the state about why they are fighting against this repeal. https://t.co/NdSmcyfgK5
For me, this is personal. When I was little, I had a childhood illness and was branded as a child with a pre-existing condition. https://t.co/F6AjSHb4lS
I want you to know I‚Äôm fighting. And I hope you'll continue fighting too. #AmericaSpeaksOut
LIVE on the steps of the Capitol right now to speak out and share the stories of Wisconsinites. https://t.co/AzMgkhg03X
Right now, the Senate is voting to move forward on partisan health care repeal that will make things worse, not better. I'm voting no.
It‚Äôs time that we work together to do the job that the American people sent us here to do.
It‚Äôs time to stop the partisan nonsense. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people‚Äôs health care away.
This fight is about Wisconsin families like Zoe‚Äôs and Kyle‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs #KeepKidsCovered!
Zoe's mom said "to me, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre taking the American Dream from her."	That's not right and I won't stand for it.
And then there is Zoe in Seymour. She was born with congenital heart defect. Her parents are scared this repeal plan will make things worse. https://t.co/98Z2vwU4L4
Thanks to Medicaid, Kyle was able to live at home, have an education, get a driver‚Äôs license and now he‚Äôs attending college!
Mary from Kenosha told me about her son Kyle, who has autism and was never expected to learn to speak.
Jean from Baraboo told me she‚Äôs scared because her Chron‚Äôs disease would cost her a fortune if her pre-existing conditions weren't covered.
Wisconsinites are speaking out because health care is deeply personal.
Americans want us to work together to lower costs. No one wants a partisan plan that takes people‚Äôs health care away.
They don‚Äôt want loved ones who depend on #Medicaid for nursing home care to have their care put at risk with caps &amp; cuts. #DontCapMyCare
And they don‚Äôt want bare bones insurance that doesn‚Äôt cover essential services they need.
People with pre-existing conditions don‚Äôt want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have today.
They don‚Äôt want the #AgeTax or the higher premiums that this plan is offering.
People don't want higher costs for less care.
Tonight, I rise to share the message Wisconsinites are sending to Washington. Their message is clear:

I've said it before and I'll say it again: Who would cut health care coverage for children?!?	https://t.co/upxQgGVg6s
GOP #HealthcareBill cuts Medicaid &amp; premium assistance. This hurts rural hospitals &amp; undermines private health insurance market in rural WI.
Rural hospitals are economic engines in smaller communities. When they are at risk, the jobs &amp; economic growth they create are at risk too.
Rural hospitals play a critical role in ensuring that Wisconsin families have access to needed health care services. https://t.co/y6JhWFlAwY

I am going to fight to protect the health care people have today. I'll continue my work to make it more affordable, not more costly.
The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people‚Äôs health care away.
Or a disabled child who relies on Medicaid funding at school. Who would take health care away from a child?
A loved one who depends on Medicaid for nursing home care. They deserve better.
This will put everyone who depends on Medicaid at risk:
The Senate GOP repeal plan also cuts and caps Medicaid.
Now, politicians in Madison will decide whether you keep the care you have - or whether it is taken away.
More bad news from the Senate GOP repeal plan: The guaranteed protections and care that you have today are weakened.
If you have a pre-existing condition or struggle with a sickness, you could be thrown into a high-cost pool that prices you out of coverage.
If you are older, you could pay an #AgeTax.
It will increase the number of Americans who are uninsured.
It will make families pay more for less care.
For Wisconsin families struggling to get ahead, the GOP Senate repeal plan has no heart &amp; people are scared it will make things worse.

If you are a #veteran who relies on Medicaid for health coverage, #TrumpCare will put your care at risk.
If you live in rural Wisconsin, #TrumpCare will only make it harder to access affordable, quality health care.
If you have a pre-existing condition, the guaranteed protections &amp; care you have today may not be there tomorrow. #TrumpCare
If you are older, you may pay a #TrumpCare #AgeTax.
Here‚Äôs is what Senate Republicans don‚Äôt want you to know. https://t.co/UjyJQswQEI
#AmericaSpeaksOut because #TrumpCare is "mean." Washington should stop leaving people behind and start helping people get ahead.
The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people's health care away. They sent me to protect the care they have today.
This is personal to Chelsey in Shelby. She worries about what #TrumpCare will mean for her daughter with a pre-existing condition.
This is personal for Barbara from Madison. Her disabled son relies on Medicaid to work and live independently.
This is personal for Greg from Stoddard who has no idea how older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for care.
This is personal for Jim from Appleton whose daughter has MS. He told me she needs the ACA so she can receive affordable treatment.
This isn't just personal for me, it's personal for the Wisconsin families that I work for. I've listened to them &amp; I'm giving them a voice.
Raising costs for a family with a pre-existing condition isn‚Äôt right, it‚Äôs not fair and it‚Äôs not who we are.
No parent or grandparent should have to lay awake wondering if the health care they have today for their family will be there tomorrow.
My grandparents raised me, couldn't find insurance at any price, and had to pay out of pocket for my care.

@POTUS 12/ Together, it‚Äôs time to act on real reforms that will help grow our #MadeInWI manufacturing economy. I stand ready to get the job done.
@POTUS 11/ In Wisconsin, we have a long and proud tradition of making things. That‚Äôs what we do and that‚Äôs who we are. #MadeInWI
@POTUS 10/ I'll introduce a manufacturing R&amp;D reform that will help small &amp; medium-sized manufacturers purchase next gen ‚Äúconnected‚Äù equipment.
@POTUS 9/ My #SmallBizInnovation Act will provide #MadeInWI startups &amp; entrepreneurs the capital they need to grow their companies &amp; create jobs.
@POTUS 8/ I'll also have two new bills introduced soon that will boost #MadeInWI manufacturers. Let‚Äôs act on those.
7/ Now that @POTUS is unveiling an infrastructure plan, he should include my #BuyAmerica reform - which he supports. https://t.co/CECHs5OHQx

4/ This news should be a wakeup call to Washington and Madison. It's time to act on supporting our #MadeInWI manufacturing economy.
3/ That's incredibly troubling, especially since #MadeInWI manufacturing jobs mean stronger economic growth for our whole state.
2/ "Wages and employment fell sharply in 2016 in Wisconsin‚Äôs manufacturing sector, the biggest piston in the state‚Äôs economy"

If you rely on Medicaid for nursing home care, #TrumpCare cuts Medicaid &amp; puts your care at risk.
If you‚Äôre an older American, #TrumpCare makes you pay an age tax.
If you have a pre-exisiting condition, #TrumpCare weakens the guaranteed protections you have today and gives you higher costs tomorrow.
If you're struggling with health care costs, #TrumpCare means higher costs, less care, more uninsured. #CBOSCORE

Even without a CBO score, we know how bad #TrumpCare is for Wisconsin. https://t.co/kSA52EB4cs

#TrumpBudget is wrong to eliminate the CDBG and I will fight in the Senate to restore funding for this critical program.
