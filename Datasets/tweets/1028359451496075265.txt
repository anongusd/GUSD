@Real_Jim_Nee @CNNPolitics Reimbursements to those that are currently working. The furloughed workers will not be reimbursed because they have not been working. Perhaps you think that is OK. Fund the government except homeland security. Trump would have more leverage about wall - then blame Democrats.
President is doing the right thing? I think NOT. Fund the government and then fight it out with the wall. Trump is using the federal workers paychecks hostage. The furloughed federal workers will not be reimbursed for the time they did not work. I don't see how this working.
@Real_Jim_Nee @CNNPolitics I'll give you that. The blame is still on Trump. He agreed to sign the current bill that would pass the House and Senate and then flipped on Ryan/McConnell. Why does Trump not agree to fund all but the homeland security? He is using federal workers paychecks hostage.
@thedailybeast Why do they televise his rants? He speaks garbage-they film it. He lies - they film him. This is Trump's reality show and he loves it.
