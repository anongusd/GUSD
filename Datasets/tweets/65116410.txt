@dankildee you democrats in office are all liars! For decades you‚Äôve promised to secure the border and fix immigration, every time you give asylum and NEVER secure the border! Your mouth isn‚Äôt broken because gov is shut! Build the damn wall!
@Barnes_Law can we do a class action lawsuit against the main stream media for defamation of character and slander on behalf of every Trump supporter? We have been painted wrongly as racist with no bases in fact. Sue for 25 billion then use the money to build the wall.
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs the best negotiator, Pelosi is a witch with a shitty needle and feces infested city she‚Äôs responsible for. She hates America and only loves control. She doesn‚Äôt care about you at all! So why do you stand behind her? She got the first 1.6 billion for the wall in San Diego!

@dcpoll @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Trump did visit Afghanistan at Christmas. Apparently your fake news media failed to tell you the truth. Get over yourself. If the reason she is denying the state of the union address TO ALL Americans, is the shut down, what gives her the right to go on a damn trip?
@BeaglesResist @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi So if you agree with Pelosi denying a state of the union, then you should agree with Trump denying this trip for Pelosi, consider8ng it‚Äôs for the same reason!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi I absolutely love this! Pelosi cannot be concerned about employees without pay and then use the employees without pay. If she wants to open the damn government she would work with the president on border security including a barrier! Pelosi is a hypocrite!

@RandomRHM @PressSec Yes she did! Pelosi said walls are immoral, while thousands of women and children are being smuggled raped and murdered on their way to America. Pelosi says she gives a damn but she actually cares more about hating Trump then helping Americans and quite frankly these illegals.
@smoore508 @PressSec Sarah sanders isn‚Äôt lying, Nancy Pelosi is and her lie is being repeated Times a million until ignorant people believe their lies!
@PressSec Take her with you to the border! She cannot possibly show up at the border and see what‚Äôs going on and then come back saying the same thing!
@realDonaldTrump take schumer and pelosi with you to the border!
@TuckerCarlson also, don‚Äôt know if you knew this but Medicaid, given to illegals in California and able bodied people pay nothing for prescriptions, while retired and disabled people have to pay a co pay for theirs, while trying to live on next to nothing.
@TuckerCarlson I happen to know for a fact that an illegal immigrant who was sick stayed in the hospital for two years until he died. My moms disabled husband couldn‚Äôt stay in the hospital long enough until he was better, and they wouldn‚Äôt accept him at long term care.
@AOC You are a racist and dumber than a box of rocks! I don‚Äôt know how there were so many freaking ignorant people to vote for someone as stupid as you! You should be impeached!
Nancy Pelosi is ridiculous! I‚Äôm ashamed she c9mes from California.
@seanhannity they should kidnap pelosi and Schumer and drag their butts to the border and force them to sit through a border patrol meeting like you did.

@marthamaccallum everything is a job for Trump. His job with the media is to make them fair, they have been unfair to conservatives for decades, and they cannot be allowed to side with Dems as if they are a dem .org it‚Äôs not right or fair. They need to report truth only! Facts!
@marthamaccallum President Trump is doing nothing but holding up a mirror to the behavior of the media and the democrats!
@BretBaier why the hell do people NOT understand the difference between the FAKE NEWS and the media? Fake news is lies, half truths, ignoring good news of the people of this country, THAT is fake news, half the country thinks trump is a freaking monster! That I‚Äôd fake news!

@TheFive @greggutfeld @DanaPerino Trump never said the media was the enemy of the people, FAKE NEWS is the enemy of the people! Stop changing what he says that on itself is fake news!
@Scaramucci You‚Äôre wrong! No one before president trump fought the bias main stream media right arm of the democrat party! They lie, they paint trump and all who support him as racist etc! If Trump doesn‚Äôt fight back their lies will continue!!! He is trying to fight for fair journalism!
@IngrahamAngle Exactly! I‚Äôm sure the cast majority in his state will reject his opinion!
https://t.co/1LATJRbCWR
@RochelleRitchie Trump is NOT resp. for that freak. Trump should not lower his tone until the MSM stops the personal attacks on him and his supporters. None of us are racist! Period! Trump is not racist, or mysogenist, or mentally unfit! And Russians didn‚Äôt elect him!
@foxandfriends we should build a wall in front of the door to the offices of every democrat in congress and the senate and deny them entry until they agree that walls work!
@foxandfriends Trump is holding up a huge mirror to show how blatantly bias the MSM is. The MSM personally attacks president Trump and ALL supporters. They‚Äôve attacked repubs for decades! They dont report facts, or discuss legislation! They are bullies! They‚Äôre why there is anger
Also as for Grassly it is IMPORTANT to start holding the lying democrats accountable! This behavior will NEVER stop if the liars aren‚Äôt held accountable. Of swetnik goes to jail or avanati it will send a message that you cannot just lie about someone and get away with it!
@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt stop fighting, don‚Äôt tone down your truths, keep holding up that mirror to who the democrats truly are! We will never survive if they keep forcing us to shut up while they scream loudly their lies!
@marthamaccallum When the main stream media STOPS the personal attacks, but instead discusses the policies this will NEVER end! The FAKE news that LIES to the American people brainwash 50% of this country to believe thief lies! That‚Äôs why we are so divided!
@marthamaccallum Trump cannot stand down! For DECADES the democrats have called conservatives racist and every other name in the book. Trump is trying to make the democrats CHANGE their assault on us when he fights back! He cannot stand down!
@CNN @JimAcosta @realDonaldTrump @cnn @jimacosta try talking about POLICIES, how they help how they hurt! Stop being a flat out juvenile BULLY
@cnn @jimacosta @realDonaldTrump NEVER called the media the enemy of the people. He called the FAKE news the enemy of the people. That is a FACT! You lie, you call trump and supporters Nazis, racist, etc &amp; you liars call Trump mentally unfit! STOP lying! Stop the personal attacks

@OutnumberedFNC I believe the motive is lack of accountability for the crimes committed against the American people in  the 2016 election. Repubs are arrested for lying to the FBI yet Hillary, Brennon, etc committed fraud in an election and remain free!

@RedPillKen @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Plus forcing people to buy health insurance or pay a fine, and using tax payer money and doubling of the debt to subsidize the insurance companies and government workers and to pay for those who couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not real GDP that‚Äôs tax payer funded crap!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs laughable ed! Obama stole money to spark the economy through higher taxes and a doubling of the debt. Then forced Americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine! That‚Äôs not real GDP that‚Äôs a tax payer funded stimulus that cost millions of people real jobs!

@StopTheLibCoup @3samiflores @kelliwardaz @rharrisonfries @HARRISFAULKNER @OutnumberedOT I personally don‚Äôt care if they get a path to citizenship or get deported either way we cannot continue to allow them to reside here illegally.

@kelliwardaz @HARRISFAULKNER @OutnumberedOT We need to get a more accurate number of those here illegally. Everyone says around 11 million, no one truly knows. We also need to appropriate electorates for the citizens not the non-citizens who should not be voting in elections! We also need to clean the voter rolls!
@OutnumberedFNC there‚Äôs massive illegal immigrant voter fraud and funding being used to benefit illegal immigrants! The question needs to be asked. The only estimate we have is there are 11 million illegals here, but no one knows for sure! We need to know to properly account!

@realDonaldTrump So true the democrats don‚Äôt want to solve DACA because it means they have nothing to beg for votes with and they refuse to end the massive flow of illegal immigration at the border because it means no more future votes and now they‚Äôre attacking children on gun issues! Assholes!

@surfspies @ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump And the materials can be purchased at different times in different places without raising awareness.

@OldSoul_1111 @ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump when a drunk driver gets caught the car isn‚Äôt taken away from everyone, the person who drove drunk gets locked up.

@surfspies @ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump That is a bullshit statistic. You need to do it based on the percentage of the population. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how many crimes are committed by someone who was BORN here, the ones that crossed the border illegally should NOT be here at all and THOSE crimes are 100% preventable!
@dlbrown0124 @ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump Many of The drugs are coming across the border. We need to close that border and assign more norder patrol at the ports. I have no doubt there are crooked Americans involved. Thank you for your service,
@ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump What kind of change are you expecting? Gun control? That‚Äôs not the answer. Obama didn‚Äôt do shit. What exactly do you expect this president to do? The community failed, the parents failed, the family that took him in with his guns failed, the school failed.
@dlbrown0124 @ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not afraid of people different than me idiot, I‚Äôm afraid of criminals, I‚Äôm fearful that many more children will die from drug overdoses on drugs that are brought here across the border!
@ANavarro_14 @realDonaldTrump A bomb gets used and you blame the bomber, a drunk driving accident you blame the driver, a shooting and you blame the gun instead of the shooter, the gun cannot shoot all by itself any more than a car can drive itself, or a bomb can create itself!

#prayforsohphia this friday!
@IM4NY @SpeakerRyan #SchumerSurrendered this was NOT a Trump shit down, the exact same items for DACA are on the table, the wall, end chain migration, end visa lottery, and grant a PATH to citizenship to DACA
https://t.co/rQXpSNd1xt https://t.co/YaAXFoG5bR
@chuckschumer explain this! https://t.co/QQ4sdAibB9
Love this! We finally have a president willing to fight fire with fire! https://t.co/FjLjQvRiT5
@TheJuanWilliams Juan, the main stream media lies everyday about Trump! They are bullies, they attack his personal character, that is NOT what the first amendment was intended for! It‚Äôs for the press to provide FACTS and let the PEOPLE decide!
@chuckschumer https://t.co/iS94uBKK61
@TheJuanWilliams you‚Äôre wrong! Obama had no legal authority to grant temporary status to illegal immigrants, the courts were about to overturn that, then Trump stepped in to SAVE the DACA people and give congress an opportunity to make it law! Get your facts straight!
@dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Trump for doing the RIGHT thing in spite of the politics!
@cydviciousraff @CraigAr64 @alan_no1 @anjalikristian9 @CyndiRocks1 @Coughily @asomer @dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump And there is is, pulling the bullshit race card! Expecting EVERYONE to follow the mother fucking law is NOT racist! American citizens go to prison when they break laws, illegal immigrants are given sanctuary cities! It‚Äôs total bullshit!
@cydviciousraff @CraigAr64 @alan_no1 @anjalikristian9 @CyndiRocks1 @Coughily @asomer @dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump Youre 100% incorrect, the people trying to come here legally are the ones that are seeking a better life, the ones coming illegally, for the most part, are criminals and those trying to game the system and get free shit!
@cydviciousraff @CraigAr64 @alan_no1 @anjalikristian9 @CyndiRocks1 @Coughily @asomer @dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump It doesn‚Äôt matter what these illegal immigrants are doing, the simple fact that THIS president is willing to give them legal status should be appreciated NOT expected! They are entitled to NOTHING! We will not do anything if we cannot stop future illegal immigration!
@anjalikristian9 @CyndiRocks1 @cydviciousraff @alan_no1 @Coughily @asomer @CraigAr64 @dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump Republicans are trying to fix the MESS obama created, obama had NO legal authority to give temporarily status to illegal immigrants. Trump is giving congress an opportunity to make it law, and stopped the courts from overturning Obama‚Äôs illegal action! It must include wall!
@cydviciousraff @alan_no1 @Coughily @asomer @CraigAr64 @dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre ignorant! We are trying to give CHIP for 6 years but YOUR democrat leader is blocking the bill because he wants illegal immigrants to vote for him because only ignorant American will ever vote democrat again!
@dearpigtrump @realDonaldTrump What do you miss? The BS lies he told over &amp; over? The fact that he spoke with sugar but did absolutely NOTHING? Even obama said we need to secure the border, and no one called him racist, he deported more people in his term than any prior president, but he wasn‚Äôt called racist!

He cannot fix this alone, this is s9methibg that MUST be done by congress! But we will NOT save DACA without border security! Period!
@Kovie1961 @realDonaldTrump Wrong! Only ignorant sheepmlistening to the bullies on MSM hate Trump! Pull your heads out of the asses of the MSM long enough to recognize the benefits that President Trump has brought to this country!

@986 @SenateGOP @SenSchumer @SenateDems WRONG! #schumershutdown just because you repeated yourself doesn‚Äôt make it true!

@thestout79 @CBSNews @nancycordes You‚Äôre an idiot!
@CBSNews @nancycordes That‚Äôs because Trump needs 18 billion not 1.2 and absolutely NO chain migration and absolutely NO visa lottery! Flake and Graham‚Äôs deal was a bunch of BS increasing illegal immigration! Just in 2016 60,000 unaccompanied minors crossed our border to try to get in DACA!
@nytimes #schumershutdown damn democrats suck! They care more about illegal immigrants then they do the American citizens, 9 million children and out military! Do you understand yet why we voted for Trump???

@JessicaTarlov I think it‚Äôs time you leave the democrat party. They‚Äôre corrupt as hell! I wouldn‚Äôt let a democrat politician near my business, would you?
@KeyWestgrl75 @r_little_finger @PressSec @POTUS Obama admin did in fact use the fake dossier paid for by the DNC to obtain a fisa warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and the transition team. That is illegal because they were American citizens and the warrant was based on lies. People are going to prison, but it is Dems!
@KeyWestgrl75 @r_little_finger @PressSec @POTUS Read the information that was posted about the fake dossier. Also someone was just indicted with 11 counts of bribery and money laundering regarding the uranium one deal. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email investigation is also being looked at again because FBI agents gave her a pass
@NancyPelosi @chuckschumer https://t.co/PPxGQoq670
@EwingDoris @realDonaldTrump Mexico will pay for it through trade and through deporting millions of illegal immigrants we currently pay to support while incarcerated!
@realDonaldTrump And the $70 billion in tax dollars about to be received from the money Apple is bringing back to America is plenty of money, so $18 billion should be a no brainer for the wall!
@SpeakerRyan Paul President Trumps tax plan initiated 350 billion dollars coming back from Apple, so this country is getting $70 billion in taxes! There is absolutely NO reason we cannot have the $18 billion for the wall!
@OutnumberedFNC you can tell the dem on the couch if she‚Äôs truly concerned about a foreign entity pot. effecting our elections because it‚Äôs an ATTACK on our democracy, that maybe she should vote FOR voter ID laws so illegal immigrants cannot vote, they‚Äôre the foreign entity!
@OutnumberedFNC this is not a broken promise! We Americans are not stupid, we know Mexico isn‚Äôt handing over cash, there are many ways to recover the cost. Deporting illegals saves billions! And we know the wall isn‚Äôt 2000 miles, we know there‚Äôs mountains and rivers!
@chuckschumer you‚Äôre a liar! You have NO right to fight for illegal immigrants over American citizens, and DACA does NOT belong in the budget! The American people are not stupid! We see the games you play and it‚Äôs bullshit!
@KeyWestgrl75 @r_little_finger @PressSec @POTUS It‚Äôs the Clintons and the obama administration that are under investigation.

@JRubinBlogger @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews No he is not a racist!

This racist BS is a narrative is Dems lies

@LindseyGrahamSC must have wall, no chain migration and no visa lottery in return for DACA! Period!
@LindseyGrahamSC if you really give a damn about the DACA people you need to give a damn about Americans safety and security! We cannot go down this road again and again and again! Border security, the wall, no chain migration and no lottery is a requirement! Period!
@chuckschumer president Trump does NOT have to do anything to prove to you that he is not racist! YOU have to prove to the American people that OUR safety is more important than an open border, drug dealers and gang members, AKA illegal immigrants!
@adrienneelrod One more thing, dicky Durban referred to chain migration then says Trump is ‚Äúhurtful‚Äù when he says it, Lyndsey Graham says countries south of the border are hell holes, he‚Äôs not racist, but trump is! You people are hypocrites! Your lies aren‚Äôt working anymore!
@adrienneelrod This country is already better because of Trump! You democrats need to get on the Trump train or get run over! We‚Äôre fixing the mess created by obama and Clinton!
@adrienneelrod President Trump is NOT racists, you democrats assholes call everything and everyone who disagrees with you racist! We do NOT want DACA without the wall! You have no right to put our teens at risk of drug addiction because you refuse the wall! We don‚Äôt own senate, we need 60 votes

@jamieleecurtis President Trump,is the FIRST president who is taking this regime seriously and DOJ g something about It! You need to back off the president! You Hollywood liberals are pathetic and out of touch with reality!
@jamieleecurtis that missile scare is on Bill Clinton for giving this regime massive funds, it‚Äôs on Hillary Clinton for selling 20% of our uranium, it‚Äôs on Bush for ignoring it, and obama for doing absolutely nothing but prop up Iran with billions on pallets in the dead of night!
@JudgeJeanine we need the wall not just to stop illegal immigration and drugs etc, we need it because the very second a democrat gets control of the country again we will be screwed and massive illegal immigration and drugs will come pouring in again!
@CheriBuss @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump 100% wrong, why in the hell do you want drugs and guns being smuggled into this country across the southern border?

@JohnSmi32828174 @Lambella44 @AssRemmington @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs BULLSHIT! You‚Äôre an ass, and Mexico will pay either through trade, or by charging fees tomcross the border, or hey how about the 100 billion we spend annually on illegals all we have to do is send them back!

@HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls @ChrisCuomo When her crimes keep coming to light on the real news stations, it needs to be discussed, I thought democrats wanted equal justice under the law, you know, kneeling for the social injustice of minorities and all that????
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Drain the swamp! I pray every single night for the truth to come out and for those guilty of crimes are held accountable, you know, equal justice under the law, and I pray for you to be surrounded by angels, I know you‚Äôre the innocent one!
@IngrahamAngle People talk about people who are killed or raped no one talks about other crimes. I was in a car accident with an illegal immigrant driving w/o license, no insurance, no recourse per the attorney, car totaled off work 8 weeks, I had liability, so no way to replace car! Not fair!
@IngrahamAngle so DACA people are complaining that THEY are being used as pawns?? NO The safety and security of American citizens are what is being used as a pawn, and this is OUR country! There should be no deal without the wall, chain and lottery GONE, ZERO benefits to them!
@SenFeinstein why would you expect DACA with no wall? California has miles of wall that has proven effective. Why would you deny other states that level of security???
Worse today! I pray I get better soon!
@CBSNews You people will look for any reason to bully this president! Shame on you all!
@KamalaHarris a wall is a requirement so idiot democrats don‚Äôt allow massive border crossings the next time they control the house the senate or the WH! All you Dems want are illegal immigrant voters!

@NancyPelosi Why should tax payers pay for that? You want internet access get a damn job and fucking pay for it!

@NancyPelosi Whose yours??? Younpeople in congress have made millions from special interest to do THEIR bidding you don‚Äôt deserve to keep your pension!
@NancyPelosi They need to get their own house in order first. They‚Äôve squandered funds given to them and allowed their infrastructure to fail! But they can be included in the infrastructure bill if you get off your ass and vote for what TRUMP wants!

@freemindom @williamlegate @PrestidgJerry @FoxNews @BenKissel That‚Äôs correct. This was NOT a country it was a territory not owned by anyone. There were NO laws on the books because there was no unified country until we became the United States of America. Now we have laws and if you fail to follow the law you should pay for that crime.

If the kids are still minors they should go home with their parents, if they are now adults, it‚Äôs fine with me that they get an opportunity to become a citizen, but they cannot get free shit, and will be deported if they commit a crime!
@williamlegate @PrestidgJerry @FoxNews @BenKissel If you cross the border illegally this is not your home. You have committed a crime, similar to burglary or trespassing. American citizens go to jail for burglary and trespass, what they hell makes you so damn special that you get a free pass???

@WendyOsefo President Trump belongs at 1600 Pennsylvania ave because we VOTED for him! There is a difference between a bully and someone punching back a bully! The bullies are all the democrats trying to unseat a fairly elected president! Back off!
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Yes but I have no desire to listen to the repeat of a lie!
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Well I wonder why??? She‚Äôd already told her lie, was just caught in a lie, so she didn‚Äôt want to answer to her lies!
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred No he said on tape he could and they‚Äôd let him, hence consent!
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred All these women are lying, they were paid by the HRC camp and Gloria Allred to make these claims days after the audio tape was released to try to legitimize his locker room talk. It‚Äôs dirty politics! The only thing the Dems know how to play.

She also stated 45 minutes into flight they were brought meals, that didn‚Äôt happen either.
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Here‚Äôs one https://t.co/QSvpl9aq3t
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Yes it has and any woman who lies about this subject is a bitch. They are ruining the credibility of true victims!
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Yes actually they have, family members of a couple of the accusers flag out stated that what their sisters were saying was false, never happened, the bitch on the plane was refuted and her story was weird for word from a movie. Maybe you should read something.
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Lol typical when faced with facts your name call.
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred And yes to me any woman who makes a false statement against any man is a bitch, it also doesn‚Äôt help those who were actually and factually assaulted or raped. It creates an environment of distrust.
@kayteterry @WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken @GloriaAllred Not all false accusations are publicized. Hundreds of not thousands occur regularly, especially for revenge on broken up relationships. And there was NO sexual assault or rape even alleged against the President, and many of these women‚Äôs stories have already been proven false.
@coromd @TinoBeano @ChrisStigall @trumps_feed And in case you haven‚Äôt noticed increasing the number of people on government subsidies increases the number of people with idle minds and idle hands which leads to increased crimes. Just look at New York, LA San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit and any other democrat run city!
@coromd @TinoBeano @ChrisStigall @trumps_feed Increased government equals more government freebies to minorities, more freebies to minorities equals fewer self sufficient self sustaining individuals increasing the number of those that rely on government for survival. It also strips away self respect and self dignity!
@WishIWasBacall @sammichalowski @kayteterry @TheNakedDalek @SenGillibrand @SenFranken Many women lie for money, fame, and many use their looks to land a sugar daddy. In this situation HRC and the crooked DNC and @GloriaAllred paid these bitches to lie about Trump! Your party will stoop to any level to unseat a fairly elected president and to win an election!
@SenGillibrand Kristen you have no position to speak, you used Bill and crooked Hillary to win the senate, bill a known rapist and Crooked HRC who threatened actual victims, and to top it off you‚Äôre FOR the killing of innocent babies with PP! Back off MY President!
@StacyLStiles @Loriisright Especially since many have already been proven liars.

@JamesThevening @NancyPelosi We the people of America that cares about America first voted for this president, he will not resign he will not be impeached or there will be a civil war! And you snowflakes do not believe in the 2nd amendment, guess who‚Äôs gonna win!
@NancyPelosi 1. Trump is doing this vote FOR it. 2. Trump is doing this, vote for it 3. Only if it is for American citizens only! 4. Trump is doing this, vote for it. 5. You don‚Äôt deserve a damn pension!

@MooreSenate any undecided, Christians forgive people who make mistakes, if that was the case 4 decades ago. Moore has been faithful to his wife for 32 years. Don‚Äôt let the smear campaign of the Dems screw the people of Alabama. We‚Äôre counting on you to get Moore in the senate!

@TinoBeano @ChrisStigall @trumps_feed I‚Äôm proud to stand with Trump and against the corruption, the oppressive policies of the democrats, the far leftist identity politics the politically correct crap that‚Äôs a direct attack on our right to free speech!
@sam_malatesta @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump For the record, if we don‚Äôt build the wall the next time an idiotic democrat becomes the president with their open borders policies massive illegal immigration will commence once again. Clinton, bush, obama all promised immigration reform and strong borders, Trump will deliver!
@sam_malatesta @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs not a Muslim ban, we have no control over the religious beliefs of those living in countries that have a broken system and the inability to provide information about their citizens. And a wall will be extremely effective, just ask the pope and China and B.B. in Israel.
@sam_malatesta @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump No one is fighting for anti immigration. We‚Äôre fighting for anti-ILLEGAL immigration. It‚Äôs so annoying that you people conflate the two! And legal immigration should be merit based, should be limited to 500,000 annually, should require asymilation, and should not allow chain mig.
@BigDeezey @canyonslm @Protectcare @DarrellIssa And I‚Äôm sure you realize that buying coal that‚Äôs mined in other countries is perfectly fine as long as WE don‚Äôt do it here??? So ridiculous, why should we pay more for something just so we can say we‚Äôre fighting climate change when no one else is??? Stupid!
@BigDeezey @canyonslm @Protectcare @DarrellIssa By ruining this state, that‚Äôs how! Highest unemployment rate, highest number of people on gov. Assist, highest number of homeless people, highest number of illegal immigrants. You call this success?
@sam_malatesta @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump Ignorant, America wasn‚Äôt America until the British came and fought for the land then created a union of the first 13 States, then obtaining the rest through purchase, then we became America then we instituted immigration law you dumb moron!
@TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump @RepCummings You‚Äôre an ASSHOLE! POTUS is NOT discriminatory or sexual harasser! But your party is racist and most are sexual assault eras, Conyers, Franken, Weiner, clinton, Weinstein, Laur, and so on!
@TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump Ban Muslims who may kill us is not racist, common sense. Deporting illegal aliens not racist it‚Äôs following the law! Not restrict voting rights of AA just by asking for ID, but you must view them as unable to get an ID and that‚Äôs racist! Building wall keeps drugs/guns/crime out!
@TrumpMemes45 @realDonaldTrump So ridiculous. First we are all presumed innocent until proven guilty. Second God forgives all his children for mistakes they make, so even if he did something innappropriate based on today‚Äôs standards over 40 years ago, he‚Äôs forgiven by the grace of God!
@Niftv_ @realDonaldTrump For what exactly? Because he‚Äôs keeping promises no other president has? Because he‚Äôs setting employment and stock market and homeownership records? Because he‚Äôs protecting America and obliterating Isis? Why should be impeached? Oh yeah you don‚Äôt like his words.....
@alltheirlies @DuszaLukasz @realDonaldTrump Lol
@realDonaldTrump Best President ever. Highest home ownership rate for African Americans ever in this country! It‚Äôs only going to get better for all! I hope our African American citizens bail on the oppressive policies of the democrats. They‚Äôve sorely hurt them for decades.

@BigDeezey @canyonslm @Protectcare @DarrellIssa Omg seriously??? Gas taxes in California are the highest in the nation, car registration taxes are highest in the nation.

@IngrahamAngle no ones above the law??? Bill Clinton should have been charged with rape and be a registered sex offender! Hillary should have been charged for obstruction of justice and destruction of government property when she deleted 33,000 emails and destroyed her phones!
@IngrahamAngle this has nothing to do with politics, Hillary Clinton didmcommit multiple crimes. But she got away with it. It‚Äôs not right and it‚Äôs not about going after the loser of a presidents race, it‚Äôs about HER crimes before Trump ever ran for President!
@IngrahamAngle can you stop calling it a ban from mostly Muslim countries? It‚Äôs a ban on middle eastern countries and North Korea. Has nothing to do with religion.

@MittRomney Also, as Christians we are called by our Lord and Savior to forgive those who fall short and to embrace them in prayer and encourage a life where they follow the lord. It appears Moore has done that, given his 32 year marriage.
@MittRomney it‚Äôs wrong for democrats and their media to make accusations a month before an election that can not be properly defended. And even if Moore did wrong, there is no life sentence for this type of crime. There are no accusations closer than 4 decades ago!

@nytimes your paper lies to America and then directs them to follow your perception of the tax bill? Must be nice to be a rich asshole that knows it won‚Äôt benefit you but will in fact benefit the middle class!
I have a general question, maybe you think it‚Äôs stupid, but I am genuinely curious. When people decide to... https://t.co/LfPAqYAxs2
@OutnumberedFNC president Trump is merely turning the tables on the Dems showing their level of hypocrisy. I mean really, verbal abuse??? That is all the Dems have been doing since the election!
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump The stock market is at all time high, unemployment 17 year low, 1.6 million new jobs, ms 13 gangs being arrested and deported, illegal immigration 70% less than prior years, its amazing his accomplishments so far.
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Look at https://t.co/jVIxQ7EIto and do your own review if the benefits to date. Already the VA is better, people have been fired that we‚Äôre doing heiress things in front of patients. The wait times are improving, and vets now have choice for doctors.
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump And where is your proof of this slanderous accusation? If your kids have a melt down because they didn‚Äôt get what they want, like you Dems crying over losing the presidential election, id hope you‚Äôd correct them.
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump And what I see in Trump is a very caring character, he gave up a rich relaxing retirement at the age of 72 to dedicate his life to improve this country for the American people! Stop judging him on what media says and go to https://t.co/jVIxQ7EIto and see what he‚Äôs DONE!
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump The problem is there is NO facts to support how you see the president. In fact Jesse Jackson gave Trump the Ellis Award for his contribution to the African American community. You think he‚Äôs racist because the media tells you so, with no facts!
@FoxNews @RandPaul Although I agree there should never be a reason to beat someone, I also believe it‚Äôs important to shine a light on the democrats committing violence against innocent conservatives!
@JoyeFelt @gregoryjdykes @realDonaldTrump Lol
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Yep, it was because his exec orders were against the constitution. President Trumps exec orders reversed Obama‚Äôs attack on the constitution and proper process that should be followed. Just like DACA president Trump extended it before courts killed it so congress can make it legal
@lizbuck22 @DuvalCarn @KateEads @rcookeii @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Trump said they wouldn‚Äôt make a deal because all THEY want is illegal immigration, open borders and higher taxes. Trump is willing to,work with them, THEY are not willing to work with him and they just proved his statement in spades!
@KateEads @rcookeii @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Lol that‚Äôs rich, the babies are crying Chuck Schumer crying over illegal immigrants and crazy Nancy Pelosi defending a sex offender and calling him an icon. President Trump is merely turning the tables on the childish behavior of Dems and calling out their lies!
@gusnlea @Otek007 @MeanOlLiberal @BurtonSharlene @JMD_813 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Yes the American people did elect President Trump. The snowflakes lost and are still crying over their loss. Move on to acceptance!
@MRSSMH2 @tjtjor @nevesytrof @CjlightningCory @LGMS56 @RogueElektron @ccjones @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Lol that‚Äôs rich considering it‚Äôs the dems committing crimes and stealing American citizens tax dollars to pay their victims to keep their mouths shut.
@nevesytrof @LGMS56 @RogueElektron @ccjones @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You think vets are blind??? You Baja is the one who spit on the military, lied about them and left 4 to die! Not this president, he holds our military at the highest level of respect!
@RogueElektron @ccjones @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump President Trump was merely telling the truth, which is certainly a breath of fresh air. All the Dems do is lie and pull on heart strings to make you FEEL upset or make your FEEL good about their consistent lies! They blow smoke up your ass, zero substance, zero facts!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Lol your entire party is nothing but a stunt! How does it feel to have a president not willing to put up with your bullshit! You don‚Äôt give a damn about Americans, all you care about are illegal immigrants and sex offenders!
@marthamaccallum freedom of speech being attacked again with that ad. Also freedom of religion, no where does it say in the constitution that an ad cannot promote a specific religion. You don‚Äôt have to read it if you don‚Äôt subscribe to that religion. Period.
Out of the mouths of babes comes truth! https://t.co/AaqIwYbZFv

@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Are you that ignorant? They can‚Äôt list things they didn‚Äôt do, and they can‚Äôt lie on there. These are factual bills that have passed and legislation that has passed and executive orders that have been signed into law! If you‚Äôre that stupid you‚Äôre a lost cause!
@OutnumberedFNC we have to have the wall. It‚Äôs not a waste of money, it‚Äôs to protect ICE agents, and Americans from drugs, and crimes. It protects innocent people from being smuggled in. And it can‚Äôt be undone by a dem president in later years!
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Seriously? Trump is not trying to divide this country, news flash, the Dems and obama divided this country over the last 8 years. Why else would anyone vote for Clinton when she‚Äôs a criminal!
@feagin_lisa @jheels @realDonaldTrump Maybe just read the accomplishments of this president on https://t.co/Hsvz3CXz4j that should make you feel great!
RT @KayaJones: Ok I‚Äôm gagging! So beautiful üòç I wasn‚Äôt ready or feeling Christmas yet but after seeing his I totally am!!!!! She‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶
@OutnumberedFNC when we call for those who victimized women to fess up to their behaviors, we should also call to action those who lie about being victimized. Vindication must be afforded to both parties, the accused if untrue, and the victims.

@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Do you really think rich people working for FREE is the swamp rather than the corrupt people who got and are getting rich with briberies and pay for play? The last administration was the most corrupt. Menendez bribes, Clinton too many crimes to count, Lynch, Comey, etc.

@jheels @krdepew @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs obvious there is hate from the left, look at Ashley Judd, Madonna, Kathy griffin, late night so called comedy, every single awards show, the entire mainstream media, the entire establishment politicians. Seriously, they‚Äôve all hated and spread that disease to numb brains.
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôd rather have someone who blows smoke up your ass with words so you FEEL good rather than someone who shoots straight and actually accomplishes a hell of a lot for this country. He‚Äôs not benefitting from office, but the bitch Hillary got 145 mill for uranium one
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Lol who‚Äôs mind is made up??? You decided to Hate Trump and ignore facts!
@jheels @feagin_lisa @realDonaldTrump Wow lowest unemployment rate, highest ever stock market 3% GDP for two quarters back to back, MS13 gang members being captured and deported, lowest illegal immigration numbers and the swamp is exposing itself, and you say he‚Äôs done nothin, WOW
@jheels @realDonaldTrump President Trump is the best president this country has ever had, but you brainwashed parrots don‚Äôt see it because you‚Äôre wearing hate glasses. Get over your fricken loss and move on!
@donnahnah @realDonaldTrump It was President Trump but you people on the left hate him so much you REFUSE to give credit where credit is due! You‚Äôre all ungrateful jerks, pathetic!
RT @mike4354: @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/d6Ma5Ndtxy
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper There‚Äôs a difference between needed regulations and excessive regulations. We are actually 7th per capita we will be number 1 when we lower taxes and companies come back. How about you look up the number of companies that have left this country in the last 10 years.
Awww so cute. Baila loves her grandma! https://t.co/loDeX6CLK2
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Well that‚Äôs one of the issues the biggest corporations get away with paying less than smaller businesses because of loop holes. But we‚Äôre still worse than other countries because of the combination of over regulation and high tax rates.
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper There are almost a million unemployed in Cali half that in Texas, less taxes less regulations more jobs. That‚Äôs a fact!
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper If you go based on percentage of population that might be true considering there are almost 40 million people in California and only 27 million people in Texas. And we‚Äôre talking about the states overall debt. Cali 390 mil in debt 370 mil TX
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Where are the stats to support your talking point?
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper It‚Äôs a percentage of the income of corporations, not against their GDP overall. Our GDP would obviously be higher because we have a much larger country. The percentage we are talking about is income tax from corporations. And yes we are the highest!
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Obama never had 1 quarter at 3% his entire 8 years, which is partially what lead to the uprising of middle class Americans voting for Trump. And obama care added to the job killing regulations that contributed to the lack of growth in the economy under obama.
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Silicone valley is its own beast. And it is quite obvious deregulation is helping people given the massive deregulation President Trump has done which has lead to 1.6 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years AND two quarters back to back at a 3% GDP.
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper And yes it is better the lower the taxes are on corporations, given that Texas is booming and California is in DEBT
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper No wonder corporations are leaving California to go to Texas who only charges 1%
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper No wonder companies leave California for Texas who only charges 1%
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Are you really that ignorant to what we are talking about? The FEDERAL corporate tax rate which is 35% compared to other COUNTRIES. State corporate tax rates are above and added to the federal corporate tax rate. So California corps have to pay35% plus 8.94%
@dawn_evens @arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper You mean you guys can continue to live in your bubble filled with snowflakes puppy dogs and blankets.
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper In the industrialized world, not based on all countries. Of our corporate taxes weren‚Äôt so high and regulations too many then why would they pack up and leave and build their manufacturing plants in Mexico, and other countries? And politifact isn‚Äôt always accurate either!
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Our government is so corrupt, billions on pallets to Iran, billions to the UN for the Paris accord, millions to victims of sexual assault by congressmen of tax payers money. If we increase our taxes it will go to everyone but the American people!
@arlenparsa @dawn_evens @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Other countries charge their people more taxes, not companies or corporations because to compete on the global stage you have to compete on the tax rates. They also charge more for goods and services in other countries to pay for healthcare.
@dawn_evens @arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Why do you think they had no problem using tax payers money to pay victims of sexual assault in congress? Or Obama shipping billions on pallets to Iran??? It‚Äôs not their personal money so they do not give a damn! That‚Äôs why we voted Trump, he cares!
@dawn_evens @arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Every time the government gets involved there is massive corruption. Keep it in the private sector and the insurance companies will monitor the potential fraud and abuse and stop it. The government doesn‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs not their money it‚Äôs ours!
@dawn_evens @arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Just like the free cell phones when Verizon opened accounts and purchased phones for people that didn‚Äôt actually buy phones so they could get FREE tax payers money!
@dawn_evens @arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper It is because of obama care which FORCES people to buy insurance with things they DONT need! And it gave expanded Medicaid to able bodied people that doctors then exploited! If the government didn‚Äôt get involved in the first place the fraud wouldn‚Äôt have been possible!
@obianuju Lol so sad.
@dawn_evens @arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper You give the corporations a tax decrease because we ARE the highest corporate tax in the ind.  world. We cannot compete. Basic economics, why do,you think that Walmart prices mostly end with .88 instead of .99 so they can be lower than target. It‚Äôs called competition!
@HillaryClinton first trump supporters are deplorable and now we‚Äôre white supremicists! You‚Äôre a crooked lying bitch! Get over it, you lost!
Thanks giving cooking has already begun. Also have pies in the oven! Thanks to my mom for her help today!
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning The elite think they are immune to the rules. It‚Äôs why they vote democrat, they have no morals. When this happens to everyday American citizens they get charged with sexual assault and register as a sex offender, when will the Dems???
@ketoe @Midwood49 @A_Smart_Liberal @FoxNews Can‚Äôt name the black ones either, so what‚Äôs your point?
@AnnCoulter Lol you crack me up. We do have prototypes. Let‚Äôs get more repubs in the senate and replace the feckless spineless ones.
@FoxNews Roy Moore should be judged on his character and work ethics for the last 10-20 years, not 40. People CHANGE, so if he dated someone under age in the 70s that has absolutely no bearing on who he is today! We need Trump agenda! Period!
@HappeningNow why are you calling Roy Moore a pedophile when not one accuser has said they actually had sex? And the allegations are just that, allegations!

@JaredCanton @zbibs @CBSNews Before Trump ever even announced he was running for president I already saw that obama was crooked and racist. It‚Äôs so blatantly obvious.
@OHenryHernandez @FoxNews And what‚Äôs wrong with dating? He never raped anyone, like Bill Ckinton did! And God only knows how many more democrats have done crap like this. Democrat party is a party with no standards, no morals, and no self respect.
@A_Smart_Liberal @Midwood49 @FoxNews That was because he first sat on the bench, so kneeling was better but niether is acceptable. People on the left have zero respect for self, others, country, and lack morals.
@FoxNews What MSNBC does is slander and that is against the law, that is not free speech!
@MSNBC calling the president racist is against the LAW! Slander is a malicious, false, and defamatory statement or report against a persons character. You are breaking the law!
@JaredCanton @zbibs @CBSNews Lol NO he actually just used his words to make you believe he was a decent human being, he‚Äôs corrupt and he‚Äôs racist!

@zbibs @JaredCanton @CBSNews You people need to go back to school, apparent,y you do not understand the difference between saying something and actually doing something. I guess that‚Äôs why you loved obama cause he did NOTHING but his words made you FEEL good.

@OutnumberedFNC maybe the proof on uranium one is in the missing 33,000 emails
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Well of we didn‚Äôt have illegal immigrants raping our country financially through welfare, health, food, housing and jails it might be a lot easier to swallow.
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Your point is what? There are millions of factors to consider, the food we eat, the alcohol people drinks, smoking, gangs, etc. that doesn‚Äôt in any way negate the wait times for healthcare in a socialized healthcare system.
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper You can not compare a population of 36 million with one that has 320 million!
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper If you think socialism is so great why not move to Venezuela to exprrience it for yourself? They‚Äôre starving to death over there.
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper That depends on who you ask. My uncle had a tumor in his brain and they couldn‚Äôt get him an appointment for 3 months because of obama care, so he ended up going to emergency room, I fail to see how obama care has helped at all.
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Also elderly are the last to ever be treated and they hope they die waiting for an appointment, people with money come HERE to be treated.
@arlenparsa @SirOdus007 @jaketapper Also understand that when you get older you wait and likely die before you get an appointment, the kids are the first they treat adults second and elderly last. They hope they die so they don‚Äôt have to lose money treating them.

@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper There are PLENTY of low level criminals that would do ANYTHING to lower their sentence and get out of jail early, in California they have a fire fighter program, they can have an agricultural program as well. And if needed we can offer SHORT term work visas  then send them home
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper I said ILLEGAL immigration! Typical democrat blurring the lines between legal and illegal, I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised since you people think you‚Äôre allowed to get away with crimes, a standard set for you by Hillary Clinton!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper There you go, being a typical democrat, I said ILLEGAL! There is a difference! But your party blurs the lines so you can get more voters!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper By the way, news flash, Black people equal 20% of the entire US population so no more than 20% of the cabinet needs to be black to meet the expected status quo!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper By all means you erase Ben Carson and Niki Haley and others!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper I‚Äôm the one providing favors your just blowing smoke and calling names!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Or you work hard 40 hours a week, your buddy slacks and works 20 hours, would you give 10 hours of income to your buddy so you BOTH have the SAME??? That is socialism! Apparently you must be on the receiving end!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper So at school you study hard you get a 4 gpa your friend parties doesn‚Äôt study has a 2 gpa would you give one of your GPA points so that your buddy has the SAME as you?????
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper It‚Äôs the dems that bow out after calling conservatives names. And BTW, if you go to school and you work hard, study and have a 4 GPA and your buddy parties every night, doesn‚Äôt study and has a 2 gpa would you voluntarily give your buddy a gpa point so you can BOTH be the same????
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper In Norway they have socialized medicaine, it cost $13 for one quarter pounder at McDonalds, it cost $10,000 to get your drivers license and it cost $126,000 to buy a car. Tell me again how government provides healthcare????
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper It‚Äôs so sad how ridiculous your argument is. I‚Äôm 52 I do NOT need baby care or mommy care, but obama care REQUIRES me to pay for that so some 16 year old can soread her legs! It‚Äôs BS! And government does NOT provide healthcare its paid for by people who fricken WORK
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper And EBT should also only be for one year or less, and they should be required to look for a job. Free or subsidized housing should ONLY be for disabled, vets and elderly NOT for lazy able bodied people or illegal immigrants, period!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Also they should not pay for more than 2 kids because that‚Äôs why they pop out many kids to increase their income which increases our taxes!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Welfare should be limited, no more than one year, and I‚Äôd rather pay for an education to get these people to work then to provide welfare the rest of their damn lives.
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper For medical insurance we should be able to get what WE need not what other people need. Car insurance were only required to carry liability in case WE hit someone and it‚Äôs OUR fault!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper The government doesn‚Äôt supply electricity we PAY for it, we also pay for roads and schools LOCALLY, not for the entire country, and this is something that benefits all and we all pay. This is such a ridiculous argument.
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Omg I didn‚Äôt give a damn the color of someone‚Äôs skin. This proves democrats are the racist ones. But I can list Loretta Lynch, Susan rice, Eric holder, and so many more. But you see, you‚Äôre the racist one counting who is in cabinet by color of skin!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Omg no actually I don‚Äôt give a damn what the color of someone‚Äôs skin is. This just proves that democrats are the ones that are racist. And let‚Äôs see, Susan rice, Eric holder, Loretta Lynch and so on and so on, but I didn‚Äôt give a damn!
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Democrats want larger government, more people who need them to survive, this was the whole point of obama care to make people dependent on the government for health care, adding to the welfare, housing, food, phones, removing the desire to be self sufficient.
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Illegal immigrants have taken over almost all fast food jobs, teens have very few options when in high school, so many give up trying. Eventually this leads to dropping out of high school and their need to be part of something leads them to gangs. Many not all.
@SirOdus007 @arlenparsa @jaketapper Increased taxes to increase welfare recipients. Open borders allowing illegal immigrants to take low end jobs that could be had by 16 - 21 year olds which teach work ethics and keeps young people off the streets.
I love this! https://t.co/zD9G3TDild

@jaketapper Yeah Jake the sons father is an ungrateful asshole! His kid was facing 10 years in jail, punishment is more harsh in China, hence the low crime rates. The father should go to China to pay for his sons crimes! Asshole!

@RepMaxineWaters you really need to step down. You‚Äôve raped your constituents financially for far too long!
@kirksl89 @FoxNews Lol and your obsession with Russian collision when there isn‚Äôt any is healthy? At least there are actual facts on the Clinton side
@byneyes @FoxNews This is not bait and switch, that‚Äôs what the entire collision was when Hillary lost the election! Deflecting blame from herself onto Trump!
@mkh4657 @Dr_Ed_L @FoxNews Blame them for what? No blame, just enlightenment of their criminal behaviors!
@Dr_Ed_L @FoxNews The master of deflection are democrats! But now it‚Äôs boomeranging right back to them as it should!
@FoxNews So true, all th crimes committed by the clintons and all ignored, Trump did nothin but run for President and he‚Äôs been attacked ever since!
@OutnumberedFNC the media attacks the President on a personal level, they never discuss his actions as president. We are sick of the slander
@OutnumberedFNC 15.2 million paid to victims of sexual assault or harassment by current congressmen! Will they be asked to step down????
@OutnumberedFNC if Roy Moore is guilty the crime occurred 40 years ago. He clearly doesn‚Äôt do this now! Must he get a life sentence?
@kimguilfoyle so dems say integ of election from foreign entity is required! Why r they against voter ID to not allow illegals (foreign ent)

@marvelxf4 @thekevster101 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS I don‚Äôt lie! you people attack guns and gun owners for the actions of 1 then call me a bigot for calling this ideology out for what it is!
@marvelxf4 @thekevster101 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS Some do, not many.
@thekevster101 @LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS And anyone who follows Islam, but doesn‚Äôt want to be the one to kill, celebrates when those who do kill, kill!
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS No they are not, gay people are killed by demented individuals, it is NEVER on behalf of a religion! Ever!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS Exactly, BUT we do NOT follow the Bible word for word, but Muslims DO follow the Quran WORD for WORD! They must kill the infidel, period.
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS Evangelicals may not be tolerant of gay people but they do NOT kill them. Again, you care more about words than actions!
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS There is a difference between tolerance and actions. Islam being followed word for word is killing infidels, period.
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS No they can‚Äôt! Christians evolved over the last 200 years and do not follow the tenants of the old testament, Islam has not evolved. Idiots!
@chuckschumer you and your democrat policy of multiculturalism and diversity is killing American citizens! Step down!
@CBSNews No the vetting should be based on their ideology, period! PC is killing Americans!
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS Of the ideology of Islam is against freedom for women and gays and other religions, then THEY are the bigots! They want to kill, period!
@NewYorkFBI revet all refugees brought here under Obama!
@NewYorkFBI NY democrat leaders are divisive when they attack our president! It was Schumer who wrote the law for lottery, Trump didn‚Äôt lie!

@LeftShewPolitic I am not hateful of people just if an ideology that is hell bent on murdering anyone who refuses to convert to their twisted beliefs!
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS No I didn‚Äôt say all middle easterners are Muslim, but all Muslims in the Middle East should stay there. Bring only Christians.
@marvelxf4 @LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS My view isn‚Äôt racist, it‚Äôs against ideology, you moron, not a race! Islam is a religion of hate against all that do not convert!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS You people care more about how what people say makes you feel than actual actions that kill people!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS You people say a foreign entity should NOT be effecting our election, then say NO let‚Äôs not require ID at voting booth so illegals can vote!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS You people twist illegal immigration with legal immigration.
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS Oh REALLY???? Then why do you libs call EVERY republican racist???? You people are hypocrites!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS It‚Äôs ridiculous that you libs think you can hug these murderers and make them love you back. They have one mission, kill the infidel.
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS NO I want to send the ones already on the watch list to gitmo and then yes send the rest home to rebuild their own damn country!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS All you care about is PC culture you don‚Äôt give a damn about actual lives!
@bigreegs1985 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS It doesn‚Äôt matter, illegal guns purchased on the streets all the time!
@LeftShewPolitic @marvelxf4 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS The only refugees are coming from middle east, Middle East follows one ideology, kill the infidel! You want them go there!

@Eyesopen1200 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS Omg you want to go hug a raping killing Muslim asshole? Move to the Middle East!
@LeftShewPolitic @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS You people are nuts! This guy rented a truck, it‚Äôs not the weapon it‚Äôs the ideology! Deport all refugees immediately! And some of you libs!
@bigreegs1985 @FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS No guns can‚Äôt be, back ground checks of these sleepers show no crimes committed!
@FoxNews @RepPeteKing @POTUS We need to revet everyone who already came here through the lottery and the refugee program. Shut down refugee entry to any non Christian!

@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN @GOP There's a difference between rich personal income and corporate profits! Corporations need a tax cut they pay highest here
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN @GOP GOP is NOT trying to cut taxes on rich, that's your parties Bs talking point. Trump wants to cut taxes on Corporations to BRING jobs!
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN @GOP Did you know that even though the black community only makes up 17% of total US population that 39% are on welfare?
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN Your party brings your damn kids on the front line of violence! Don't preach to me or Melania!
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN So it's OK for your stupid party to send ANTIFA to fight conservatives for NO reason??? And to stop OUR right to free speech?
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN I didn't call it anything, but I saw the reports that showed more food being discarded because it was shit food!
@350heat @tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump I am NOT racist I want all people to fucking work, I do not give a damn what color you are!
@350heat @tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump Omg yes he did show it, he supported BLM against cops, he did NOTHING for the black community except encourage them to fight
@tamranyc @FLOTUS The taxes of Trump disclosed by Rachael maddow showed Trump paid more than Bernie, Obama and crooked Hillary!
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN Melania is trying to rid the world of cyber bully's against children, that's a hell of a lot better than starving kids at school
@tamranyc You're full of shit! This is bullshit! Who gives a damn what melania did as a model BEFORE she had Barron? Who gives a shit about taxes?
@tamranyc @FLOTUS @UN Melania is a GREAT role model! She loves her son and you have no business bringing in the child! Period! No one did that to Mich or girls
@tamranyc @UN @mike_pence @FLOTUS Because pence is a Christian you ASSume he's KKK?? What did he vote for you think is pro kkk
@tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump What the hell financial are you talking about? Muslim brotherhood is a terrorist group, congress has already started the process to name
@tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump No KKK in White House, Trump is trying to bring more jobs back for ALL Americans, and dealing with illegal immigrants which take jobs!
@tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump Obama was the most racist president ever and he started a race war where there wasn't one, and you small minded people followed!
@tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump Obama was the most racist asshole to ever be president and he dragged all you small minded people with him!
@tamranyc @funder @realDonaldTrump There are NOT kkk in White House but there WAS Muslim Brotherhood, BLM and other terrorists groups when obama was in charge! He started this
@KingJames @StephenCurry30 U are the bum, you make millions what you doing to help your community! 17% of the total population are black, but 39% of welfare go to them
@funder @realDonaldTrump Obama also spied on American citizens, starting with journalist and then the entire Trumo campaign! Crooked MOFO
@funder @realDonaldTrump Obama was responsible for the IRS that discriminated against conservatives!
@funder @realDonaldTrump Obama was part of the fast and furious scandal that led to the death of a border patrol agent!
@funder @realDonaldTrump Obama was a corrupt asshole who used the office to line his pockets and let 4 heros die in Benghazi!
@funder @realDonaldTrump It's a disgrace for you people who take a knee on the field, you should all get fired! Obama was a disgrace to his country!
