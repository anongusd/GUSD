Ot this: "Republicans who empowered him and refused to stand up to him have a giant mess on their hands — a dysfunctional government and a looming electoral disaster."

@Guardabascio @andrewkerr @GregForMontana @gianforte Don't defend the action- wish it was disqualifying too - but apology &amp; $50k donation seem to me genuine acts of contrition more than most

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 7/x but it's important to remember he's not acting alone - those with constitutional powers &amp; responsibility to provide oversight are...
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 6/x @realDonaldTrump puts his interests above those who voted for him and those of every American that is not also a billionaire
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 5/x from tax policy to tweeting ads hawking his wife &amp; daughters products from office or letting his son in laws family sell access in China
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 4/X so that Americans know that their interests come first and before those of the president or his family
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 3/X and established ethics laws, regulations and precedent of president's putting their personal business interests in blind trusts
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 2/X with callous disregard for constitutional provisions which forbid accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments
1/X Only totally consistent actions @realDonaldTrump  taken since becoming @POTUS R those that enrich himself or his family at our expense😡 https://t.co/e98BS7O9eq
