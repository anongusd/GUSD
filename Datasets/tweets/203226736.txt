@BenMcDermott9 I think you're on the wrong timeline or misreading. This man is a credentialed physician at Johns Hopkins and other hospitals, a world renowned pro-vaccine expert the govt used to defend vaccine autism cases.
@GunNutCentral He's not a journalist, he's an MD at Johns Hopkins. I agree it's surprising to have pro-vaccine world renowned govt expert say vaccines can cause autism after all, and that the govt. covered it up, that's why it gets so much attention I think.

Thanks y'all, you are great followers! Have a good week.
@Maelie124 @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk It's tough, I know. I have probably seen thousands of autistic kids ranging from super functional to deathly ill and pretty nonfunctional.
@Maelie124 @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk Again, then your argument is with the govt which has agreed/paid/compensated those vaccine autism cases. I realize you're not familiar with all the research; I wasn't either and it took a long time to get up to speed. I had help from govt and vaccine industry inside sources.
@JimfromCtown We agree. In fact one public official argued in internal docs yrs ago that the govt would be better off "coming clean" and addressing vaccine safety issues or the public would grow suspicious -- and that would impact vaccination rates-- and I think that's happening.
@Maelie124 @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk I have no idea what you mean or why you are sending pictures of your daughter (who looks precious by the way) and I'm glad you think you can read my mind about replies! Thanks for playing tonight!
@JoetheNerd7 @BobbyLSteele Read the timeline if you're interested.
@sevenyritch63 I'm short.
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk Mitochondrial disorder, Tuberous Sclerosis and immune issues, according to scientists and court cases. But scientists believe there are many other conditions.
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk Again, you may know more than people like Dr. Bernadine Healy, Dr. Zimmerman and many others who say we already know some of the conditions that make some children susceptible to brain injury/autism etc from vaccines. They include;
@jennipunk @Maelie124 @WyldeHeartedSon @Tschudi_Davai I thought we were having fun.
@propornot @Uranian39 @DeplorableMikeX @aintist @OpWolverines @ybbkaren There are too many, and you can do your own research if you care, but perhaps the most important recent one is the world renowned pro-vaccine expert Dr. Zimmerman. https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE
@Maelie124 @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk Not meaning to leave you out, I'm doing too many things at once. I can't respond to everybody and really should be finishing some work, but I'm not intentionally ignoring you. Thanks for the interactions! And for being fairly civil.
@CanadianZiggy I haven't spread my views, you apparently are upset with the govt/vaccine industry expert witness, the world renowned pro-vaccine Dr. Zimmerman, who says vaccines can cause autism after all, rarely. You can reach him at Johns Hopkins.
@CryinHayward @ArtVuilleumier You can start with some of Dr. Zimmerman's peer reviewed, published research. He published on this very topic on multiple occasions after he says he told the govt/vaccine industry people he worked for that vaccines can cause autism, after all (rarely). https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE
@el_blanc0 Nice try but did you really not know he's talking about the reports that smeared him after his affidavit became public? He verified what was in article and his affidavit. But I guess you may see what you wish to see! https://t.co/Fy3eW8ntBs
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk It's been fun but your game is getting a little bit #Tiresome. https://t.co/LxkMBuUHFf
@JimfromCtown That's an all or nothing argument that (respectfully) doesn't make sense. Scientists like Dr. Bernadine Healy said yrs ago it's possible to cull out the susceptible kids, save them, and vaccinate the rest safely--in fact she said we have an obligation to do so.
@pecunium @ClutchScience @Layner311L @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot That's another fallacy put out by vaccine industry propagandists. There isn't "one fraudulent study." There many peer reviewed studies and scientists. And if one simply disregards all of it and then claims it's not there; well, I can't assist.
@Nu1Oscar @ClutchScience @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Not routinely, no.
@cowsharky You're new here. I've addressed the fallacy of all-or-nothing argument. It's like saying all people must take all medicine-- or everybody gets none and we all die. Scientists say it's possible to save vulnerable kids most likely to be injured by vax, and vaccinate the rest safely
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk Scientists who want to "cull" susceptible children-- they mean don't vaccinate those-- and vaccinate the rest safely, make a compelling argument, I think. How am I not "currently" anti-vaccine? I guess because I'm not against vaccination.
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk The science exists even if you stand on one foot and pinch your nose and say it doesn't. I didn't say vaccine cause autism. (I did quote a pro-vaccine govt expert who says so, as well as CDC official who agrees it's a possibility)... https://t.co/ev4VbFjH9n
@jennipunk @Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 That pretty much did it. You're right. I'm convinced. #CompellingArgument
@jennipunk @Maelie124 @WyldeHeartedSon @Tschudi_Davai Your glass is even bigger than mine!!! A toast to you nonetheless!
@kgj3x I don't know if this is what you mean but Columbia's, of course, for 1905 salad, black bean soup and Cuban bread. St. Armand's. If you do get to Siesta Key, go to Anna's for sandwiches. Get their special (on rye). And the Amish restaurants are fun.
@pecunium @ClutchScience @Layner311L @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Not really, For example, there was scientific debate and discussion over centrifugal force in recent years; much changing thought about evolution over time, etc. Wonder why it's so important to some to close the door and not examine the newer science?
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk That is crossing the line, mister. Even for a troll. You cannot seriously be advocating to put susceptible infants into "leper" colonies. Hopefully you're making a bad joke.
@ClutchScience @Layner311L @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot You may know far more than the world's renowned expert, chosen by the govt and vaccine industry to defend their cases, who works at Johns Hopkins and other prestigious institutions. It's possible.
@Maelie124 @WyldeHeartedSon @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk You caught me! But please don't tell the others! They aren't nearly as smart as you are in interpreting words and their meaning! https://t.co/Rh7zusmlzP
@BraveNewtWorld @Maelie124 No, I mean the many scientists who have published on this, but the one pro-vaccine govt/industry medical expert who carries a lot of weight since the vaccine industry used him to defend vaccine-autism cases in federal vaccine court.
@Bhess @cjane87 @SethAMandel 1. Your first sentence is incorrect. 2. Your second sentence is false. #ThanksForPlaying #ReadUpALittle
@propornot @Uranian39 @DeplorableMikeX @aintist @OpWolverines @ybbkaren Again, your gripe is with the scientists who say otherwise, including the govt's own pro-vaccine medical expert who says vaccines can cause autism after all (rarely), and says he told the govt but they covered it up. Your argument isn't with me.
@Maelie124 @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk Hmmm. I'm ok with routine insults from trolls *but* calling me anti-vaxx doesn't make it so. Try all caps, sometimes that's convincing, though!
@WyldeHeartedSon @Maelie124 @Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk https://t.co/9JExEOBV6v
@ClutchScience @Layner311L @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Lots of peer reviewed, published research suggests various vaccine autism links. That's why Dr. Zimmerman says he changed his mind. Then he published his own research. Just because you're not familiar with it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
@Bhess @Belle_Vivant It's great you answered your own question, but the actual answer is there's a great deal of research, starting with what Dr. Zimmerman, the govt's own pro-vaccine expert medical witness, published. But saying "end of story" was a nice touch.
@WyldeHeartedSon ;) #YouMustBeNewHereBruh
@kgj3x Thank you for the civil response. Sarasota is awesome.
@Tschudi_Davai @jennipunk @Maelie124 "choose, pick, glean" So scientists like Dr. Bernadine Healy say the vulnerable children, a minority, should be culled (as in separated) from the rest and saved. The rest can then be vaccinated safely, they say.
@ClutchScience @Layner311L @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Your first sentence is subject to great dispute by people like the former head of the New England Journal of Medicine. Not to mention there is recent science, such as what Dr. Zimmerman referred to, that points to vaccine-autism link.
@ClutchScience @Layner311L @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot With respect, you lost me with settled since no scientist says science is "settled." That's a propaganda term. Not that you mean it intentionally. But by that theory we would still think cigarettes can't cause cancer and the world is flat. Also...
@jennipunk @dontpanicguide4 @Maelie124 I'm flattered but surely you can find your own creative gif rather than copying mine #DforEffort
@jennipunk @Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 I still don't understand. But we can agree to uncomprehending each other...
@kgj3x Respectfully, if you're sincerely interested, there are many scientific writings on this topic. You can find them. I was surprised, too when I was first assigned to report on the topic.
@AtomicSyzygy @yesnicksearcy @EricJGreenberg1 @peterbakernyt https://t.co/N4U1n0IhlG
@ClutchScience @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Oh I get it. Yes. I have doctors and PhDs in my immediate family ;)
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk I think you're a little confuse. I don't know who Trump's doctor is and have never cited him for anything. And when you said... "those people..."? https://t.co/nKhL1wTS0O
@kgj3x It's not just 1 person; he's important I think because he's the govt/vaccine industry's own pro-vaccine expert, is world renowned, and he agrees with many scientists and studies that have said the same. Still, ignore if you wish!
@donben2287 I have my own show on broadcast if you're interested. Replays online here at https://t.co/MvkUwjf9Cc
@ClutchScience @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Oh I see! Sorry, please understand, I typically don't read bios or research followers or those I interact with. I'm even happy to interact with trolls as long as they are fairly civil.
@dontpanicguide4 @jennipunk @Maelie124 If you think the govt.'s own pro-vaccine medical expert they used to defend vaccine-autism cases is a quack, that's your prerogative, but it would call into the question the govt's whole vaccine-autism defense.
@BobbyLSteele I caution that Dr. Zimmerman addressed what he said was one cause of vaccine-autism. Other scientists have written about other vaccine factors they believe cause brain damage in susceptible children that leads to autism.
@BobbyLSteele Yes, a bit in his affidavit and a great deal in published papers. https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE BUT...
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk Who said any such thing? 1. I'm not arguing 2. I've never made a recommendation about vaccination 3. Many scientists have pointed out it's not all or nothing (vaccinate or don't), it's culling out the vulnerable and vaccinating the rest more safety. Sounds rational to me.
@lirpalomina @Maelie124 @jennipunk 58
@ClutchScience @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot I'm sorry I don't understand the tweet, can you try again?
@Maelie124 @jennipunk Yes that's exactly how to interpret the findings of the pro-vaccine govt/vaccine industry medical expert who says vaccines can cause autism, after all, in rare cases. #YouSmart
@o_zingler @lastConservinIl wow I was ok with trolling but not with this sort of language and tweet.
@ClutchScience @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot You're a curmudgeon, too?
@jennipunk @Maelie124 When exactly did you start relying on vaccine industry propagandists for your info? https://t.co/tBXdZJdP2u
@pbrasga @BabyTeethB @CherylFVATN @mikevolpe @Msblowana You guys are arguing between yourselves over the govt's own pro vaccine medical expert witness and his opinion, as well as many other doctors. Not me. If you want to tell him he's ignorant, feel free. But he may know a teeny bit more than you do. #JustAGuess
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk we can identify the susceptible kids, save them, and vaccinated the rest safety. Win-win. Who wouldn't think that's the rational and safest approach for all?
@Tschudi_Davai @Maelie124 @jennipunk That's a typical fallacy. A logical mind understands, as scientists explained to me, that it's not "all or nothing" as in everybody takes all vaccines even if it kills a few, or nobody gets any vaccines... actually, scientists believe...(cont)
@ClutchScience @pecunium @ArtVuilleumier @OpWolverines @propornot Ah a PhD who calls herself "doctor." No offense but that explains a lot. :)
@bootsqueak @Calltoart @vidalexperience @OpWolverines @propornot Like I said, you caught me but please don't tell the others! They don't know yet! Have a heart!
@ThinkrEdible @Shaughn_A @krassenstein No. Start with that.
@JoetheNerd7 @BobbyLSteele uh, just no. But thanks for playing
@odcusa https://t.co/KwDvx7qa6z
@Maelie124 @jennipunk ;)
@o_zingler He's not a "doctor"; he's a renowned expert in his field of medicine, that's why govt and vaccine industry used him as their expert. Do you think he photoshopped his own docs? I'm not sure what your imagination is insinuating. Also, many doctors agree w/him incl. some at CDC.
@WyldeHeartedSon My, you're full of mistaken assumptions. 1. My child is fully vaccinated. 2. If your child is, too, then he theoretically isn't at risk from unvaccinated kids. So kinda strange you feel that way.
@Maelie124 @jennipunk For me? Good since I had measles as a child, as did everybody I know who's my age, and we have lifelong immunity. Not so good for those who have been vaccinated but the vaccine didn't work.
@jennipunk @Maelie124 Not mine, since I don't report on conspiracy theories. On the other hand, there are vaccine industry cultists who would have you believe there's a crazy anti-vaccine conspiracy.
@RatherEarnest Bingo. Scientists say that's what we should have been doing when it became possible a decade ago. Although I don't know whether postponement or a different formulation or other solution would be the answer...
@bootsqueak @Calltoart @vidalexperience @OpWolverines @propornot Shhh The others haven't figured me out yet!!! https://t.co/QniSa4UNep
@donben2287 I think you just use your computer rather than phone
@o_zingler You either 1. Believe the doctor or (if not) 2. Think the govt/vaccine industry's own chosen expert is a delusional liar-- which poses issues since they used him to defend vaccine injury cases in federal vaccine court. #NoGoodAnswerForYou
@procrastin @OpWolverines @RVAwonk @propornot Thank you. (Do you mean Full Measure or Sharyl Attkisson?) Thanks for taking a look.
@jennipunk @Maelie124 Surely you have at least a little bit of cognizance when it comes to ORAC and other well known vaccine propagandists? No? #YouMustBeNewHere
@o_zingler That's a completely rational response and a cogent explanation of what probably really happened. #YoureSmart https://t.co/491D7Xfqed
@bootsqueak Oh, you mean MOI? https://t.co/j2Mv3V9Hc8
@o_zingler He specifically addressed the quotes you quote... and told the govt. that he had since learned that vaccines can cause autism, after all. But he said the govt covered it up and misrepresented him.
@o_zingler It would be up to him, but as he explained in his affidavit, advances in science caused him to change his opinion. That's one reason his opinion is so compelling. Didn't you read what you're commenting about? https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE
It comes in waves when the directive goes out ;) https://t.co/fbf8UttJCR
@FeloniousBunk Convincing. https://t.co/k3JBXBMAOF
@Maelie124 Perhaps you know more than the govt's own pro-vaccine medical expert who is world-renowned and disagrees with you, but I think your gripe is with him and the other scientists who disagree with you. It's not with me.
@UMassMedical @maggiemfox @PeterHotez @thehill Yes, some in the media misrepresented him and attacked him after his affidavit was released. I'm glad he cleared it up. Anyone who weighs in on concerns about vaccine safety issues suffers orchestrated attacks and smears.
Who is Ms Atkinson and why are you tweeting me about her? https://t.co/UEvLKBCcrr
You make a compelling argument, there. üë©‚Äçüéì https://t.co/eDyCCDI2iU
@1crosbycat That was a point one govt official made in internal emails some yrs ago. She said they'd be better off to come clean and fix the problem (which would ultimately build more confidence in the vaccine program).
@pedernal71 @PMgeezer Actually, as long as they don't call it "autism" but more generically brain damage or "encephalitis," many have been compensated. https://t.co/gXA0UaBHsk
@maitre_anthony Nah, baby, nah.
@GeorgeGamard There have been studies that have looked at the possible susceptibility of boys that, when combined with certain vaccination, may trigger autism.
@vinnyc101 IN one major case the govt. acknowledged (but had sealed so other parents wouldn't know), the govt concluded the child's genetic susceptibility combined with getting so many vaccines in one day triggered autism.
@vinnyc101 Some scientists have noted that a lot of the alleged sudden regression cases after vaccination occur shortly after the first live virus vaccine kids get MMR around the time of DPT. and
@CharlieBrownsDi I understand that response, and before I understood a lot about the issue, I thought the same sorts of things! If you're interested in digging in, you can read more and understand why his conclusions are so significant. https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE
There are many more. He's probably the most important in some ways because the govt and vaccine industry picked him as *their* expert witness in defending vaccine autism claims in court. So when he says they can cause autism, after all, it's hard to completely ignore. https://t.co/ASwzmZFOsY
@vinnyc101 --since the vaccine schedule was tripled in the past few decades, what impact did that have on susceptible children? Also, there are discussions about vaccine ingredients and effectiveness over time, etc.
@vinnyc101 There are many studies and theories pointing to numerous factors and combination of factors. One that even CDC's head of immunization safety agrees on (with Dr. Zimmerman) is the mitochondrial issue. Question: Do more kids have mitochondrial dysfunction today? --and
Thanks! https://t.co/EelsNbqnxy
@mikevolpe @Msblowana Well, and the govt vaccine industry used him as their expert. And he's a world-renowned expert. So....  https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE
@surfthespectrum https://t.co/I9crmDDEuD
@PMgeezer The issue is, scientists say it's possible to determine which kids might have the deadly reactions to various vaccines, and to save them while safely vaccinating the rest. Like not forcing kids who are allergic to penicillin to take penicillin.
@PMgeezer Respectfully, that's an unnecessary generalization like saying "all people should take medicine." Some vaccines have been pulled from the market for safety reasons. Some are not recommended for susceptible kids. As of today even CDC doesn't say "everyone must get vaccinated."
@CryinHayward I"m sure you don't mean that to say that, therefore, vaccines should not be made as safe as possible, and that when scientists find there are risks, they should be covered up... ?

Our Sunday cover story looks at the other investigation. @SidneyPowell1 @FullMeasureNews #SurveillanceAbuse How to Watch Full Measure on TV, online or on demand (now also on STIRR app, Roku, Apple TV, Fire, etc.)! https://t.co/6Nb3q5xfny https://t.co/ecYpwCzSW9
@vipersnke I used to hate fruits and vegetables. Now it's what I mostly eat-- and they actually taste good. https://t.co/slnFqu26Ov
@DonaldsAngel I thought I didn‚Äôt like broccoli or mayo.
@DonaldsAngel Trust me
A few of you asked for my favorite recipes from BA.  These are two recent ones I liked. https://t.co/B7ka7UNkHG
@TheCaptCanuck I used to go to that school. Age changed me.
@PatriotsOfMars I"m from the south.
@shreksshrek @HVRanch I used bleu cheese dressing too a few times for zing. Though I must say I didn't notice a big difference.
Cut up broccoli bite sized, incl. peeled stalk. Mix in large bowl with: (to taste)  Mayonnaise or Miracle Whip, walnuts or roasted pumpkin seeds, shredded cheddar, thinly sliced purple onion, salt &amp; pepper. After mixing well, stir in small cherry tomatoes salted &amp; halved. üíô
I'm no great chef, but you want a really good broccoli salad recipe, if I do say so myself, read what Il post it under this tweet.
@ajbruno14 I'll be over tonight.
@Gluteomaximus In many respects I"m sure you're right. however, I think there's evidence we should be (more) concerned abt daily ingestion of multiple neurotoxins/cancer causing agents on virtually all of our veggies and fruits including organic. No dispute that they cause cancer, brain injury.
@NadaLib They thought it was fun. Cooking little packets of food. Not super tasty but also not horrible.
@HeadlineJuice @FullMeasureNews No this was analysis rather than talking to subjects.
@susangunn6 Maybe she of it but what I remember is they had some sort of heating mechanism and were in thick plastic pouches etc if I recall.
@mikevolpe That's factually accurate. They/vaccine industry think if we knew more we'd stop vaccinating. In fact, some scientists believe if govt. would address the safety issues, it would have opposite result and wd build confidence in a vax program many don't trust.
@ScotsFyre @ElizabethSolle2 That's good but I also read an article in Consumer Report (I think) about how even organic food averages 5-7 pesticides per item and each was neurotoxin/cancer causing if I remember correctly. Made me think we're poisoning ourselves.
@imwren I kept some and then too much. I give the Boxes to a neighbor who uses them.
@susangunn6 Tons of them over time. I will look at some of the recipe cards I saved.
@madpatriot57 @GemCityGuy Done that recently
@Jonatha10167449 Every time someone says "vaccines are safe" or "vaccines are dangerous" they miss the obvious nuance/fact. Like medicine. Tires. Life. Depends on the medicine, depends on the recipient as to whether a particular one is safe &amp; effective for them.
@TomWLight I will look at some of the cards I saved and tweet later... you?
@mikevolpe Sometimes. But some real people are definitely influenced by the propaganda. And I don't blame them; it's pervasive and I unknowingly used to believe it too before I was assigned to investigated the topic.
@gamecocksSecE I have had so many amazing meals that I would never have thought of and can't remember off the to of my head. I could look at the recipe cards I saved...
@ComSensRulz No disrespect intended! I will also point out, as a girl in a family of doctors, that sometimes important medical revolutions are discovered and exposed in part by non-MDs. I call it "not-seeing-the-forest-for-the-trees" syndrome, at times.
@emmy_louise_ Here's how clueless I was. To avoid hormones, I gave my daughter soy milk. I think soy milk should be labelled that it can mimic estrogen, I had no idea.
Ok I agree. I do Blue Apron occasionally and keep thinking there must be ways to economically return all the packaging, cooling pak, etc. for re-use. https://t.co/TmOnnGU8W0
@mikevolpe Real people or propagandists?
@CornWhisky I don't know. I have grown limited vegetables and on a small scale I lose some but most survive. Are there natural methods like worms?
Yes I have eaten a lot of MREs. After one deployment (as a journalist with the troops) they sent me home with a bunch (I forgot why) and I actually took those to my kid's school and shared them so the kids could see what the troops get. https://t.co/b2Swt8B7gM
@Jonatha10167449 @FullMeasureNews Apparently not! I was surprised, too. Watch my story: (or scan the print version) https://t.co/E8H12Qxh2W
If I had time and knowledge &amp; cd go back in time I would have grown as much food in a garden without pesticides as possible when my daughter was little.
@ChazzRG @DoorDash @FiveGuys https://t.co/aKHq1p6e52
@debb2612debb are they political? I use Blue Apron. What did they do?
@waterspryt @DoorDash That counts. I haven't tried yet.
@NCManoukian I actually think they have a delivery for that ;)
@yzest5121 Interesting. Not sure I agree-- people seem to be busier (lazier ;)) and willing to shell out more $$ for luxuries/conveniences than when I was young... I have used Blue Apron occasionally for yrs and I do like it. Hear they're in some financial trouble.
@Beklemmt130 Certain corporations and the persistent bureaucracy.
Do you use a meal delivery plan? If so, which one? What do you like? What haven't you liked? Is it expensive?
@Abrutse Yes. Also scientists say clean drinking water and routine access to antibiotics and hydration are big game changers as well.
@Togosan2 @FullMeasureNews @SidneyPowell1 Ways to watch @FullMeasureNews https://t.co/6Nb3q5xfny
@Beklemmt130 Obviously a poll like that is not scientific. Mostly for fun.
@GovMikeSheridan True. It's interesting. I also think that the pro-Trump people are more motivated to vote. I have a variety of visitors based on email and comments they send.
@Abrutse That cd be true! Though I know some differ on that point. Also, some vax worked; others were pulled off  market for safety reasons-- hard to lump together. In the end, pro-vaccine scientists I trust say it's poss to make them safer for all &amp; build confidence in robust vax program

@beneatnwheaties @CamoMomTX @ICWA_Susie Not all science. Plenty say otherwise, including (but not limited to) the govt. own world-renowned pro-vaccine expert, Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, who concluded science shows vaccines can (rarely) cause autism after all,  says he told govt. but they covered it up and misled the public.

@JamesVGrimaldi @JohnFairbanks1 It's all the way a certain court sees things-- and in the end, if there's a dispute, whether the executive branch decides to defer to the judicial branch.
@JamesVGrimaldi @JohnFairbanks1 ..not advocating either way, but a gun emergency wouldn't ban guns. It would argue to limit them in some way much as they are already limited in many ways.
@JamesVGrimaldi @JohnFairbanks1 I don't see a gun emergency the same way. Gun rights are in the constitution but we already have many gun controls such as: prisoners can't have guns. Children can't take guns to school. There's quite a long list. So...

@SeanKymalainen @IAMISjp (If you think pro-vaccine dr in question, who was govt./vaccine industry expert witness defending vaccines &amp; works at Johns Hopkins &amp; has published 100s of scholarly articles= isn't reliable..That wd mean you're calling the govt/vaccine industry judgment into question too.)

@MilanovNina @Bhess Yes I believe that's correct. The death "rate" remains the constant. If vaccination lowers the number of people getting a disease, then there would be fewer injuries/deaths from that disease per population. If the vaccine causes adverse events, more of those.
Perhaps the most ignorant of all the ignorant vaccine comments. Kids in US don't get smallpox vaccination. Govt. doesn't recommend it. CDC considers smallpox vaccine more dangerous than the current risk of smallpox (extremely low). #DoALittleResearch https://t.co/0TxFgiK5Ng

Answer today's poll (on left of page): Does national news media include too many DC talking points? https://t.co/FSZkyRrjZZ
@MilanovNina @Bhess According to CDC the death rate is not connected to vaccination. The death rate remains the same regardless of number in population vaccinated. The rarity of disease deaths, say scientists, has to do with simple advances in modern medical care.
@iot_pat Yes. Also... (If only it worked all the time; had no side effects; etc etc)

@Bhess @helengrote That misrepresents. It wasn't a big deal for me, my siblings or any of the thousands of people I knew who got measles. CDC considers it an extremely rare disease w/negligible risk of long term effects, though not impossible. Vaccine also very rarely causes long term effects.
@azathere Yes
@bhunted1957 You may be right but still there is nothing that prevents any of us from bringing in disease after we travel (we aren't quarantined) and since even those of us who are vaccinated can get the diseases anyway, we could bring it back.
@BryanDMcNally @Stckysheets There is some truth to that. Although many illegals are caught and go through this process. But many are not caught.
@WildOrca56 I do wonder.
@jnarcus In the US it's generally considered neither serious nor deadly, thankfully!
@azathere You could be right. However, since CDC says measles brought in each year from outside US (eradicated here) and occurring in numerous vaccinated people, I'm not sure you're right.
@DeputyMark @TomTaber @Lrihendry @DHallNole You're a little confused. My tweet wasn't "smart ass." On another note, as I mentioned, I don't have enough data to know if most diseases are brought in by illegal immigrants. Two different topics, my friend. (And neither thing that I wrote is "journalism.")
@ph_terry @iNCNF Thank goodness you're ok. Me too!
@muench3 You'd have to talk to an expert, but someone involved in vaccine development explained to me in layman's terms that some of them are "wearing off." I don't want to try to translate the technical explanation he gave because I probably wouldn't do it correctly.
@BryanDMcNally @Stckysheets There are no vaccination requirements for visitors to the United States.  Since ppl aren't quarantined upon entry, they could be carrying measles or other diseases. This is why ebola was a worry for a time.
@bflat879 You may be right, but the reason it's not considered serious in the US is also because of modern hygiene etc. It wasn't considered serious when I had it and everybody I knew had it as a kid. It was rite of passage. Though I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
@Michael68ish @Lrihendry @DHallNole Hard to say. But for example, if you rubbed shoulders with another American who carried measles, you could come back with measles, even if vaccinated.
@EckleyToni @MarathonerNYC (Vaccine label, approved by FDA, CDC. These vaccine side effects are said to be very rare.) https://t.co/vws01i4M9k
@ElizAbsher (viruses cause diseases my friend).
@EckleyToni @MarathonerNYC Then your gripe is with CDC and the vaccine maker who say so. If they are publishing false information, they should correct it.
@JazzJT We could ask them, but CDC says it's so exceedingly rare, it would be difficult. CDC also says the sterility from the vaccine itself is also very rare.
@dsweetman2 https://t.co/LKc4S6qS3E
@BryanDMcNally Yes for immigrant visas. Not for my British colleague who comes for a work assignment next weekend, for example.
@ElizAbsher It's a disease. "a disorder of structure or function...that... is not simply a direct result of physical injury."
@EckleyToni @Lrihendry @DHallNole I get your point.
@TomTaber @Lrihendry @DHallNole I don't have enough info to know whether most of the diseases are indeed being brought in by illegal population. That may be but I sincerely think it may not be the case (i.e. I think measles comes in ea. yr. and has been frequently traced to other travelers)
@BeAccountable4u @Lrihendry @DHallNole You may be right, I"m not sure-- it's more publicized now for sure. Also, scientists say some vaccines are "wearing off" (immunity wanes) which is unrelated.
@BryanDMcNally You and I would have to be quarantined if we travel out of US -- when we return, if we are to catch diseases. I have never spoken to officials who agree we can or should do that, though some may differ.
@BryanDMcNally I don't think it's true that all people who come here "legally" have any sort of check for measles, mumps etc (everybody entering US would have to be tested and quarantined at a location to know their true health status).
@FlowerNoman @Lrihendry @DHallNole I believe even after "eradication" in US we've had measles outbreaks every year. It's just that sometimes the govt/pharma complex publicizes them more and they seem to have reason to do so now.
@sdcoyote73 Agreed in one sense, but 1. it's implied some of them are legal (not illegal) 2. US citizens can also bring back diseases from their travel, even sometimes if they've been vaccinated.
@terib3294 Perhaps. When everyone I know had mumps it was not considered serious at all, though I do remember being uncomfortable/feeling bad and we all had to stay home from school for at least 3 days I think! Maybe just a different time!
@DenisPercell Almost never. Same with the vaccine adverse events: deafness, sterility, death, etc-- exceedingly rare.
@Denise_Aucoin Sad but thankfully exceedingly rare, according to CDC, as is deafness caused very rarely by the MMR vaccine.
@Lrihendry @DHallNole It's true that they are bringing eradicated diseases into US but the same is and may be true of diseases brought in by Americans who travel out of US and come back with disease, sometimes even if they've been vaccinated.
@NEOrganics Respectfully, I'm not correlating anything, it correlates itself. The disease, according to facts, is being brought into the US by migrants. There is much to tell about why etc if one wishes to know or learn.
@edmundpburke I'm not an expert on that but I would think it's not desirable. If true, I guess that implies we need to be much more careful about eradicated diseases (such as measles) being brought into US each year. But how?
@fidelis_62 Rarely. And the vaccine for it rarely causes the same issues, if you believe the vaccine label. But very rarely. https://t.co/nEf9ebsA43
@DWFreer (I think it's already happening. A news report showed illegal immigrants getting vaccinated at a holding camp.)
@jdgorms2 True. Fortunately, women who had measles as children don't have much concern. Unfortunately since the vaccine seems to be "wearing off" or ineffective in some, women who were vaccinated may have some concern when measles brought in from other countries each year.
@Bhess Also I'm not sure where you have the impression that ppl with measles flood hospitals. I'm sure it's happened, but nobody I knew went to the hospital with measles. You usually stay home from school and play monopoly.
@lord_haw Indeed, you're not. https://t.co/HH53m5inXZ
@Bhess Again, almost nobody gets seriously ill from measles in the US. There is no "body count" to speak of from measles in US or, according to CDC, from the vaccine which rarely causes serious adverse events.
@nnnanceee yes.
@cauldeb I think so. He actually testified as much in the years since then but nobody covered his testimony. Then he was asked by one of his patients to attest to it in a formal affidavit and surprisingly he agreed.
@lord_haw Some might say you're recklessly stoking panic. Again, I know I'm repeating myself but, respectfully, a little reading might be in order on your part. From the MMR vaccine label (these adverse events are considered very rare). https://t.co/ozoxTZvE44
@edmundpburke The more worrisome outbreaks are ones few seem to discuss but actually have injured and killed far more US kids in recent years.
@edmundpburke Govt. scientists and industry insiders I trust have educated me a lot and they believe none of these outbreaks (so far) are very serious, indeed. A lot of industry in the panic over them, though.
@nnnanceee (Almost never.)
@Bhess Measles isn't a serious disease in the US fortunately. Everybody I know my age had measles and not only survived, it was just one of the common diseases of childhood. No need to panic, fortunately. Same with vaccine, only very rarely does it hurt immune-suppressed etc.
@truFFLeblog Fortunately, almost never ever. And the vaccine also rarely has serious adverse events. Good news all the way around.
@lord_haw Sure I will change jobs tomorrow, based on your well reasoned suggestion. https://t.co/nstPP6dx87
@lord_haw My goodness, my friend, I don't have enough hours. You didn't know that deafness and death are associated with the vaccine? (Very rarely, as with the disease itself).
@lord_haw I think you neat to read up a little if you really want to start arguments and sound somewhat rational. #OrNot #YourChoice
@JerryKazek Hard to say. The vaccinated crowd is getting some of the diseases-- and, as you may know, vaccinated people "shed" live virus. Complicated.
@lord_haw Those are very rare side effects from the vaccine; it doesn't happen often so most scientists would say it's inappropriate for you to characterize those side effects as meaningful in the big picture.
@Bhess 1. Almost never. You're panicking people needlessly. 2. It's not just 1. (Also, it's factually incorrect to say "all" vaccines are save and needed. Many have been pulled from market for safety reasons, for example. 3. Facts are not irresponsible. Trying to suppress facts can be.
@lord_haw It doesn't matter to me what you conclude, I just like to get info out there that powerful interests try to suppress. Then you can decide, as you have!
@HoosierGrandma7 Very rarely. CDC says even when it happens, it only happens on one side (of male) and even when it happens on both sides: "Such orchitis, even bilaterally, very rarely causes sterility." Phew! Vaccine also causes serious illness only rarely.
@lord_haw Yes fortunately--almost never...  Even rarely when it happens, CDC says: "Such orchitis, even bilaterally, very rarely causes sterility." Phew!
@CageyBee33 I'll bet you would agree it depends on the vaccine, its effectiveness, and whether the patient may become sick or ill from it. For ex. you're pro vaccine but I doubt you think ppl should be forced to get vaccines that have been pulled from the market for safety reasons.
@bridgers_kirk Thank goodness you survived!
@Bhess If the facts bother you, it's hard for me to solve your problems. Fortunately, almost nobody is seriously injured by measles or mumps, and the vaccines rarely cause serious injury or death, so we are lucky.
@mjh4259 Almost never. Same with the vaccine, the serious adverse events and death etc from the vaccine are very rare.
@lord_haw Don't be so hard on him.. a lot of people have bought into the propaganda and before I reported on the topic I must admit, I did too!
@CageyBee33 Not sure what that means. I guess I wouldn't argue with it though!
@bridgers_kirk Very rarely --but interesting that so many people know that off the top of their head when it almost never happens. The serious adverse events from the vaccine are also very rare.
@MarathonerNYC Very rarely. Same with the vaccine for them: very rarely do they cause death or serious adverse events. We are lucky!
@HeidiWindham Very rarely but fortunately almost never. Same is true of the vaccines for them. Death and serious adverse events from the vaccines are relatively rare.
@CageyBee33 Exactly. As with everything. Same with adverse events from the vaccines. Rare, but if you are the one.. :(
@IMama954 Don't be so hard on them, they are just coming to this country for a better life and you might, too, if you lived in countries like theirs.
@lord_haw It's actually not. (Are you really that ignorant?) #EverybodyIKnowMyAgeHadAndSurvivedMumps #EvenCDCAgrees
@HoosierGrandma7 Fortunately, almost never! But how fast you knew that shows how much somebody wants you to worry about it. ;)
@leesa_fl Fortunately, almost never!
@CageyBee33 Fortunately, almost never! Though I wouldn't want to be the exception!

@DjRodgers1231 Yes indeed. I recently did a story about that. And in some cases it was the interpretation of or reporting of the polls that was off. https://t.co/O5AutkJHkY
@DjRodgers1231 You may be right; I'm not sure that's how that's how one would read a "generic" ballot against actual candidate but you could be right. I would still suggest it doesn't quite mean "The Rasmussen daily tracking poll is wildly out of whack with all other polls.  It‚Äôs rubbish."
@DjRodgers1231 538 analysis after 2016 presidential poll: "Rasmussen Reports deserves a lot of credit for its final, national poll of the 2016 presidential election, which had Hillary Clinton ahead by 2 percentage points, almost her exact margin of victory in the popular vote."
@DjRodgers1231 @SpotsyHoya @USWeatherExpert Not sure comparing to other polls makes it wildly out of whack, I think it was pretty spot on in 2016 (?) but you could be right.

@hdome251 Of course not! What you need to know if you're a critical thinker is that when people scream baby killer and anti-vaccine, it's sometimes part of a larger campaign to shout them down.
@13WrapsisRight It sounds interesting on its face but not top on my list with so much to do. I don't know enough about what it means or could mean. If I had a source that could provide me some good info I would be interested. So far--I don't.
@ReadYouForFree @OliSpacePixels On the other hand it would be good to know if you or your kid had one of those conditions that is known to lead to brain damage etc after vaccination. Then others can have their vaccines safely but save those kids.
@ReadYouForFree @OliSpacePixels https://t.co/yXClNWZyBe
@ReadYouForFree @OliSpacePixels In some cases, govt and scientists have agreed with certainty. In one major case, govt. admitted and then sadly ordered case sealed so nobody else would know. That's where the duplicity comes in and why we must be sure to dig for facts not just accept.
@ReadYouForFree @OliSpacePixels Scientists believe there are a # of such vulnerabilities we could identify in advance if we tried, and save those kids while safely vaccinating the rest and maintaining #HerdImmunity (which I know is another debate but...)
@ReadYouForFree @OliSpacePixels The govt. has conceded that children with mitochondrial disorder appear to be predisposed to brain injury after vaccination that can result in autism. Another genetic pre-existing condition they've found is TS (tuberous sclerosis).
@ReadYouForFree @OliSpacePixels Yes you are correct in essence. That is the belief of quite a few reputable peer reviewed published scientists and even head of CDC immunization safety said it's possible (though the CDC website strangely says it's impossible).

@OliSpacePixels You sound overwrought. I think your complaint isn't with me (I didn't make the claim) but the pro-vaccine govt expert scientist who, like others, says vaccines can cause autism after all (rarely). I think you can reach him at Johns Hopkins. However...

@Dannyboy7293 @badzoot7 Thank you!

@JoeWazowski44 I don't think the govt pro-vaccine expert who claimed a cover up of his opinion that vaccines can cause autism would go that far. I also don't think the CDC senior scientist who says he &amp; his colleagues changed important study data to diminish a link would go that far.

@vintageport014 @JamesLifestr Wow you agree cigarettes cause cancer in some, but not all smokers? Hmmm. I wonder...
@OregonJOBS2 Just because you say something, fortunately, doesn't make it so. Even if you say it over and over. I've never said anything "anti-vaccine" and your attempt to coin "pro-disease" idea probably isn't going to catch on. #ButICouldBeWrong https://t.co/T4ADjDfp1E
@OregonJOBS2 I don't "sic." Maybe that's how you roll. PS It's "sic" not "sick" (ironically "sic"). Also, that's a silly position that if Trump thinks something, it's proof that anyone who thinks the same is wrong. #TryHarder. And...
@vintageport014 @JamesLifestr I see, you think science stops at a certain point in time, and we shouldn't listen to or consider other science that disagrees. So you think cigarettes don't cause cancer, and the earth is flat. #WhatColorIsTheSkyInYourWorld
@pauls_nyc What audio?
@vintageport014 What if somebody raised a question that's actually being asked... and somebody else tried to discredit it by pretending that was some sort of weird off base question?

@JamesLifestr I do think vaccines are a big success story. That isn't at odds with the notion that 1. it's possible to make them as safe as possible 2. like Andy medicine, not all vaccines are equally safe and effective for all. for ex. some vax have been pulled from market for safety reasons.
@JamesLifestr Respectfully, you're barking up the wrong tree.Take it up with the scientists incl. govt's pro vaccine world renowned expert who says they (rarely) do. CDC head of immuniz safety also says it's possible. I just = think that we shouldn't only present scientists on one side.

Possible conversation: 	VA gov. to old friends, "Can you confirm that's me in the photo?" 	Friends: "No, not that time, but I remember you winning that dance contest dressed as Michael Jackson." https://t.co/6QfhyFBIZS
@49robinRd That's kind of his point, I think. But it seems undercut by his admission that he did do such a deed previously and perhaps so many times he had a nickname based on it and knew that shoe polish was hard to get off skin.
@JeffWoke I didn't hear if anybody asked whether he has the photo of the MJ dance contest. Sounds like he might have seen it lately.
@cobra429jet It did seem like that. And he brought up the MJ dance contest because perhaps he realized that photo might show up soon.
Another piece of information. Still, it's wise to withhold judgements until we have more information. Hard to know anything for certain at this point. https://t.co/Pbalgjotsp

@Madison_con I'm simply talking about newser and you make a good point, I don't think he's getting any questions about the other controversy.
VA governor: 'I thought the photo was me but since others don't remember it was me, I don't remember it was me, either. But I count on their memory more than my own to tell me what I did back then.'
VA Governor: 'This wasn't me in that picture, but I'm pretty sure there are pictures of me earlier in black face when I won a dance contest as Michael Jackson. Shoe polish is hard to get off so I didn't use too much.' (How many times did he use shoe polish on his face?)

@Siouxperman86 true but homicide, for example includes accidental and negligent, not just intentional.
@DeaconSchroeder But -icide when it's homicide covers accident or negligent as well, not just intentional killing.
What confuses me, in part, is (and many don't know this) but "homicide" can be accident or negligence (not just intentional murder). So I wondered what infanticide referred to. https://t.co/AZTKDRwURo
@higginsgggg Maybe. But it's said more often than written. Sounds like suffix of decide. Inside. I was taught in J school that the spoken word goes by fast on TV and best to be very plain and clear.
@angiesc33 Now you're really confused me.
@theatomicmom I think killing a baby is plain English. I am not the brightest bulb but I looked up infanticide when people kept saying it to see if it implied some sort of extenuating circumstance whereby some claim it's legal or justified.
@HarryTuttl3 Homicide is another word that I think kind of confuses. Call me wrong but
Wherever you stand, I think the word "infanticide" is confusing to some. It's killing of a baby (no debate). "Infanticide" almost sounds like a medical procedure. Agree or disagree?

@Nu1Oscar @TylerEd365483 @_cleansocks @photoartist9 @vlhill1 It's the biggest, most effective propaganda campaign I know of. I was surprised, too (long ago)! I'm fully vaccinated. My child is fully vaccinated. But there's a well organized powerful campaign to silence anyone who investigates vaccine safety issues. That alone is noteworthy.
@ings4palin The last cases of polio in the US were from the oral polio vaccine, which fortunately was finally pulled off the market in US because the non-oral (shot) is safer and cannot transmit polio. (Too bad they were offering oral polio vax when the vax shot was safer.) The more you know
@dhartaggie88 Do better than what? I only said I don't see any evidence the outbreaks are from illegal immigrants. Do you think illegal immigrants are responsible? If so, let me know why you think it. Tx
@TylerEd365483 @_cleansocks @photoartist9 @vlhill1 There is a different calculus, I believe according to scientists on all sides, when it comes to diseases in the US where they can be minor due to modern health treatments, and places where they aren't so fortunate.

@tbrownwright @Razer4455 @InJeffable @TuckerPeterson_ @jaketapper That's the government/vaccine industry line, but the issue is many scientists, such as former NIH Director Dr. Healy and the world renowned pro-vaccine expert Dr. Andrew Zimmerman beg to differ. That's all.
@winmor1 @Mamma_Janet @eileeniorio @Turkey_CON @SGottliebFDA @SquawkCNBC @CNBC @BeckyQuick @jb_handley ..I also think it wouldn't be right to blame you for the serious injuries and occasional vaccine death because you seem to advocate the nonscientific position of pushing all vaccines for all children.
@winmor1 @Mamma_Janet @eileeniorio @Turkey_CON @SGottliebFDA @SquawkCNBC @CNBC @BeckyQuick @jb_handley That's a common vaccine propaganda tactic and fallacy. I don't advise about vaccination; it's a very individual calculus according to scientists, depending on person and vaccine. But..

@oneplainGuy @whyser1 The most common refrain from scientists/whistleblowers etc (and all the ones I've spoken to are generally pro-vaccine, or pro-vaccine safety) is that research to better identify the traits that make some kids susceptible to adverse events is possible but blocked.
@oneplainGuy @whyser1 I haven't made any such claim and I haven't come upon such research or allegations.

@oneplainGuy @whyser1 I too was surprised after several years of research and connected to govt and industry insiders and whistleblowers who guided me to peer reviewed research and other sources. Just not quite always black and white, that's all.

I don't believe he went that far. He's a senior scientist at CDC who says he and his top colleagues trashed data in a vaccine-autism study of African American boys until they got the relationship to look smaller than he says it actually is. https://t.co/f77vGLxV65
@MannSandiemann @angistweeting @hookedontxmusic @RandPaul No. But I see where who're coming from indeed!
@areaman714 @JohnThomT well, it's the CDC lead immunization safety head who thinks that, so you can take it up with the scientist. Other scientists like the pro-vaccine expert witness Dr. Andrew Zimmerman are more definitive: they say vaccines do cause autism in rare cases.
@sciguy8989 @waynerohde Very scientific term. Clown. Convincing, too. https://t.co/Ri3WsNe2dB
@AndrewLeeLanier @Tryxt3rocks I see. I neither agree nor disagree: I have seen scientific reports on herd immunity (which I like the sound of, because even if a # of ppl don't vaccinate, the population is still protected), and I've seen scientific challenges to the notion. I haven't formed a conclusion.
@MannSandiemann @angistweeting @hookedontxmusic @RandPaul I am entirely scarred by a comedy show's criticism of my corporation. Not. I survived happily for decades at CNN, CBS and PBS while they were routinely lampooned. Sometimes we are lampooned deservedly! Definitely not infallible.
@areaman714 @JohnThomT I wouldn't like to think science is often thought of as "settled" or we won't discover new stuff.
@KikiMamaMonster I think so, in fact I was led to believe "measles deaths" as rare as they are in US are usually deaths of kids who were otherwise seriously ill. I think your point is: there are medical reasons for some not to vaccinate and they shouldn't be forced to if it makes them sick.
@PolDisc Hey I get it if it's not your bag!

@12MBerry @waterspryt "Illegal immigrant" still isn't a race, no matter how hard you crunch it.
@BruceLeroyi812 :0
@HappyManor I agree all avenues should be explored since CDC has long said all of our measles come from outside US. Question is: what would we do? Have all of us who travel outside of the US get checked/quarantined upon return? Etc.
Another view. https://t.co/i8af5Dj1wc
@AndrewLeeLanier Your tweet on the other hand is really smart. Not my math-- but your tweet is really smart. Bravo to the smartness of your tweet. You're welcome.
But there's no public study on this, so (I think) it's impossible to say.

@oneplainGuy Not sure, a key whistleblower has claimed immunity of vaccine is less and less and CDC says our outbreaks ea. yr. come from outside the US because we have eradicated here. So hard to put all blame on anti-vaxxers.
There it is, then. I believe the US govt decided if we have an outbreak they would use a ring strategy, vaccinating in a ring around the infected person. https://t.co/goUGvv6TAo
@rukristine Maybe... not my math but I think you're right.
If anything, I'm over-vaccinated if there is such a thing because at CBS I kept up w/various travel-related vaccines in case of on the spot deployment on military assignment--only to learn the military shoots you up again even if you have your vaccine card. So double doses.
@lockjoshua Completely skeptical. After all, I'd heard the same thing everybody else had. It just sounded crazy. But I am a trained fact-finder and once I learned about military vaccine injuries I connected w/govt and vaccine industry insiders and whistleblowers and--down the rabbit hole!
@UnclehammySteve We like debates! As long as they don't veer into terribly uncivil. Even trolls are somewhat welcome if they behave.
@oneplainGuy Not my math, but I take your point. And yes, many have claimed 100% effectiveness over the years to me. So your sentence is incorrect.
@SeanKymalainen No, there was no such suggestion in that tweet. #BeClearerWIthYourInsultsTroll
@JoeZikarro I wonder why the 4 who were vaccinated got measles?
If I remember correctly, smallpox is one unusual vaccine you can get very quickly *after* exposure and it still works! Who has a background and can comment on whether that's the case? I believe the US decided to rely on post-exposure vaccination in event of an attack. https://t.co/9QLzOqbVR3
It's actually a good question. Doctors told me yrs ago when I was doing story on military vaccine injuries for CBS that smallpox vaccine is no longer given due to risk of vaccine being seen as higher than risk of getting smallpox at this time in US. Also-- https://t.co/9QLzOqbVR3
@rhfjr3 I don't know.
@seeken (not my math but I take your point)
@SeanKymalainen You're right. I never heard of it.
@JJDoyle100 There are scientists who write about the shedding of live virus in vaccinated, and whistleblowers who have discussed the declining effectiveness of various vaccines. Plus, CDC says we have eradicated measles but it is brought in ea. yr. from outside US.

@HalfEvilD I think we see where you're coming from if you think that it's "propaganda" to say that we in the media should be careful not to jump to factual conclusions. https://t.co/GT8M4xeLnK
@Razer4455 @TuckerPeterson_ @jaketapper "Research over" is the most unscientific thought when it comes to science. I guess we would be stuck with flat earth and cigarettes don't cause cancer if people just decide research is over at some random point.
@Diabloojosazule @TheJusticeDept We have time(s), software, govt. IP addresses etc. The rest we want to get via discovery-- they are so far blocking.
That is possibly the strangest and most irrelevant response to an article that suggests the media should be careful about jumping to conclusions. https://t.co/VofW6HKXCD
Hey join the club. Mine are never answered. https://t.co/qbv85eGBxL
@on_bender With respect, I don't care what you conclude --or if you choose to do real research. I wish I had time and desire to do it for you, but you are capable of making up your own mind, looking at the facts (or not). There are plenty of other people you can troll who may engage you.
@on_bender (You're arguing with the wrong person: You can take it up with the pro-vaccine head of CDC immunization safety who says you're incorrect. Also the former head of NIH Dr. Bernadine Healy. And pro-vaccine govt. expert Dr. Andrew Zimmerman... To name but a few "morons.") ;)
@HMan0860 So you're saying you oppose scientifically identifying the susceptible kids, saving them, and vaccinating the rest safely? That's a little weird of you.
@Oddytee77 You're on line with the propaganda lines indeed. But you give yourself away with astroturf language like "pro-disease cultists." You don't even pretend to sound rational.
You're saying we should always strive to improve vaccine/medicine safety?	Far too logical.  #IThinkYouBrokeTwitter https://t.co/IzAx5GGF3v
@sandman5962 I think the four of us had it at once, which was preferable for parents at the time. They wanted to get it over with at once. Itchy, too.

@Kilroy61 I'm sorry I don't know him!
What propaganda trolls don't realize is that they are so instantly recognizable for a number of distinctive features in their patterns, arguments, etc. It cuts into their effectiveness and tends to make the other side's point. ;)
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett Sorry, I'm not playing your tedious game. As I said-- lesser people than you have tried with better people than me.
@chiefgator You make a fascinating point.
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett Listen, people lesser than you have sent all the usual propaganda to people better than I -- and the facts are still the facts. Nobody here is buying what you're selling.  #Predictable #Ineffective
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett Are you saying you recognize that vaccines thought of as safe and effective sometimes are found not to be -- even after govt and doctors and people like you insisted everybody should have them?
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett I couldn't possibly say which vaccines might be best for which people, each has its own effectiveness and risk profile in addition to the person's individual biology, according to scientists. Heck, we all thought the ones pulled from the market were safe until the govt pulled em
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett We agree on part one, but problem is the govt hasn't and won't identify all the reasons there should be exemptions. That needs to be done. I would advocate for that.
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett You're cracking me up right now. ü§£ #ManyHaveTried #FewHaveSucceeded
@chiefgator I'm of your generation. #WeRAllOk #ButNowBigBusiness
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett That's the tough part: the vaccine industry keeps the injury data and the govt. won't do a study that looks at cumulative vaccine injuries/combo effect. But you are definitely spouting all the typical propaganda! #YouGoBoy
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett I wouldn't recommend the rotavirus vaccine that was pulled from the market for safety reasons. Would you?
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett I wouldn't recommend oral polio vaccine (given to my child but now pulled from the market for safety reasons.)
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett I wouldn't think someone who's allergic to penicillin should get penicillin. But I would want it for those who can benefit from it.
@larryfitz45 @ReggieHargett ??? So everyone who isn't anti-vax is anti-vax. I guess that means you? LOL. One thing I have learned, it's silly and unscientific to recommend "vaccines" to "all" children. That's like recommending "all" "medicine" for "all." Which vaccine, which child?
@CasualMeyhem @honestbroham @PMgeezer Therein lies the problem. Instead of blaming "anti-vaxxers" best to try to address that issue and find the safest, most effective vaccines possible.
@CasualMeyhem @PMgeezer For example, we already know  that if you child is born with TS, then according to scientists and vaccine court, vaccines can trigger brain injury incl autism. Same with mitochondrial disorder. We could test for these things in advance.
@CasualMeyhem @PMgeezer Yes we have them now but the govt. won't fund the studies and controversializes the scientist who try to study it. Former NIH Dir. Dr. Bernadine Healy tried to address this years ago. What I mean by false choice is: it's not either/or.
@honestbroham @CasualMeyhem @PMgeezer That's why the "anti-vax blame" propaganda makes no sense if you think about it. The fact is, accdg to industry whistleblowers, the vaccine effectiveness is waning so vaccinated people are getting measles brought in from outside US.
@Serendipiterry I'm sorry. That's awful! There have been the tiniest handful reported in the last few decades in US, some dispute the real cause. (CDC has said those are in people who were critically ill/immune suppressed etc.) Measles vaccine deaths are also very rare but sad when they occur.
@woolyjesus (My, what a convincing argument, Einstein.)üòâ
@honestbroham That's how I started this research rabbit hole: I was assigned by CBS to cover military vaccine injuries. Eventually an across whistleblowers in govt and vaccine industry who directed me to published studies the govt and drs said didn't exist...etc.
@PJforAmerica @achildsrights2 We're talking about 2 different things. Beyond allergy, there are serious brain damage and death incidents, though as you said, also rare.
@PJforAmerica Could be. Doctors say-- "In children, illness from rubella infection is usually mild."
@DWDrummer13 @TheJusticeDept After 4 yrs they quibbled over 16 days during which time we did narrow our subpoenas and tried to schedule limited depositions we were being allowed.
@CasualMeyhem @PMgeezer False choice (with due respect). Their odds are better unless they are in a susceptible minority that is brain damaged or killed via vaccination. The trick is: scientists say we can learn that in advance and save those kids while vaccinating the rest safety.
@masbury1603 @TheJusticeDept 3 appellate judges. I don't know which way they will go. Many issues.
@PMgeezer I used to think that, too. And while I and my child are fully vaccinated, I learned through covering the story, and insider govt. and Pharma whistleblowers there is much more to the calculus. You'd be shocked.
@tlamb775 @TheJusticeDept I like your optimism; however it's not that easy. Three judges; different opinions, many issues. Not all of them favorable to our side.
@DWDrummer13 @TheJusticeDept That's one thing I correctly figured...in advance.
@ReggieHargett I didn't realize I'd ever said any such thing. (Hint: I haven't).
@CaliCard1 That's as good as it can get-- just feeling as though you made your points the best way you could. Now we wait.
@masbury1603 @TheJusticeDept DOJ says we shouldn't get to move ahead with case because we haven't been able to figure out the names of the agents involved. We say we haven't figured out names of agents because we haven't been allowed to move ahead with the case.
@PTT4579 I'm sorry but your personal anecdotes has no impact on the facts, which are quite clear. An alternate view, which you are free to discard if you wish not to have the information. It addresses some of your inflammatory misconceptions. https://t.co/IGoaBQmOem
Alternate view on measles. Your choice on what to believe. 	https://t.co/IGoaBQmOem
@tlamb775 @TheJusticeDept Yes but if so they used government resources so..
I wouldn't wish measles on anyone (I had em) but strange how some now seem convinced it's a killer disease. Other facts: CDC says measles is eradicated here but outbreaks come from outside US.	More and more kids who get measles had been vaccinated. 	https://t.co/dWf1BtcqK2
@tlamb775 @TheJusticeDept none produced
@CaliCard1 I don't want to give the impression it's a slam dunk; not all the judges necessarily see it that way and there are 3.

@JohnThomT LOL you're changing your arguments.
@JoAnneBMoore Recall though that, according to CDC, scientists and vaccine labels, vaccines can cause death (very rarely).
@JohnThomT If someone says Firestone tires are splitting apart at high speeds and causing rollovers, would you say Sure, but tires are safe statistically so let's keep those Firestones on the car?
@JohnThomT If I'm highly allergic to penicillin, I don't want to take it because it can kill me. However, if I'm not allergic to penicillin, I want to take it when needed. Statistically, if I'm allergic, I'm 100% vulnerable. Scientists say we can figure this out for vaccines, too.
@JohnThomT Remember, the propaganda line is that it's been debunked. "May rarely" is not debunked. In fact, CDC says so in the interview.
@JohnThomT Pro vaccine Dr. Zimmerman and other scientist says vaccines DO cause autism,  but the fact that even CDC admits "may rarely" shows there is some university of thought on the point.
@JohnThomT Perhaps you haven't read/seen all the evidence. In addition, re: your final sentence, that's a generalist statement that isn't true in each case. Scientists say measles is rarely if ever deadly. (All us older people had it.) Same with chicken pox. Very individual calculus.
@PhilPrange 1. They didn't debunk the science. 2. That was a long time ago and there has been much science since. 3. I was surprised too! Because I'd heard all the propaganda. 4. Even head of CDC immunization safety says it's a possibility. So... except for that...
@1rebel2020 #Propaganda #NotLogic
@TX_1 I would say that matches up with what Dr. Zimmerman, the govt pro vaccine expert, found as well as the head of CDC immunization safety and others.
@UnclehammySteve You assume they want the facts. A lot of this is pushed propaganda. Many of them never saw the story. I'm used to that--first  went down rabbit hole when assigned the story around 2002. ;)
@JohnThomT If you say so. But many scientists beg to differ and the head of CDC immunization safety is among those who have acknowledged vaccines may rarely trigger autism in susceptible children. It's not really in dispute except among the propagandists. (I was surprised, too.)
Vaccine autism link has only been "debunked" by propagandists in govt/vaccine industry who wish you to think it. Unfortunately, much science leans toward a link. Scientists believe it's possible to both make vaccines safer &amp; maintain strong(er) Vax program https://t.co/RSldi5gMfo https://t.co/KR7Vm2q04P

@JohnPlunket I'm told 2-6 months is not unusual
@ruralneighbor I sense one way or another either I or they will take it to the next level. AT least try.
@CurtisFDickinso It's bigger than that. But certainly some woudl think twice.
@pburchins Hmm. It was fairly evenly split but maybe more of them.
@mtnwheel I don't know if that's true (going against the feds). Uphill battle and they hold all the cards. Sure would settle, what I want is accountability for the guilty.
@Andreaowoodruff Ask the forensics guys, they fingerprint it and know. It's Greek to me.
@johncri26122582 It wasn't like that, very short. Asked pointed fair questions of both of us
@indyjasa @dhiggins63 Yes which my attorney thinks is not a bad thing for a civil rights violation
@DARRoadking Fair hearing. Hard to know though
@CraigBlack1968 I think it's an uphill battle.
@PoserIndex I have sources and acquaintances who work there and are terrific. But overall nothing has changed at FBI from Obama to Trump
@raywatts @JDjwhite54 I don't think so. We have all along thought they will at some point invoke national security issues to keep some matters nonpublic.
@spalkeen I know who was behind it. Proving the names are another matter.
@Barnes_Law I try not to play those games, though tempting, because it can be so wrong. I would guess that DOJ got more questions. But there were many issues at issue and some we didn't even address...
@gatoreric1 We'd have to ask them but it started before Benghazi and continued thru that time. It was active in 2011
@animaltopper1 typical I'm told is 2-6 months
@dhiggins63 Named Holder and head of Post Office at time. Others are John Does until we get discovery and can name them
@KDrama_FeverNUT We will get a ruling in the not too distant future about whether we can go ahead
@pollybarrett As well as one could expect for a fair hearing
@brunmad Good question: but the forensics prove without a doubt the govt hacking. And I had the first forensics and sourcing on that at the outset --with multiple independent continuing exams building on the info. What we dont know is names.
@melsyts Not that far yet. They're saying we can't sue because govt officials are immune.
@kerrloud Names and prosecutions.
@G_Gozerian1 This stage of the case? 65% we continue on. 35% we are told no.
@freebird_Pepper No, Nobody should.
@oldyfan2012 2-6 months before ruling is typical
@chriswray3 could be anything but generally 2-6 months
@TheDeletedConf1 Verizon
@Rodr_76 no date at this time
@ksondere Immunity for govt officials, also saying we didn't do discovery correctly... stuff like that.
@FrankEdell Mueller.
@kmalkows No.
@DopeAssFreshPr1 We're not that far along; we're simply litigating process.. are they immune from the suit? Do we get discovery?
@ThomasMFountain @CaliCard1 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump They challenged both sides. The lower court's opinion (against us) carries some weight to be sure. They also seemed to see our view of some matters&gt;
@u4devildog According to insiders, it's more common than the law intends and sometimes not properly warranted or the warrant info is inaccurate.
@kurt_hurt Unfortunately even if we win at this stage it's a very long road and uphill battle ahead. The DOJ holds all the evidence, all the cards and has unlimited time and taxpayer money to fight.

@JodyTaylor10 Super kind. https://t.co/0Rj1Xs1rhj if you can, but your moral support is also wonderful.
@HeroineRipley @USlammy Very unsettling for the whole family.
@SatireandIrony @Steve_Stuck Govt. officials enjoy broad immunity from lawsuits for some good reasons, but we are claiming an exception in a case like ours.
@bobnfn1 I was told by DOJ IG and DOJ that there was no FISA warrant. Also source of mine says no FISA warrant. Also timing of my surveillance didn't match timing of typical warrant (it was much longer term) and abruptly stopped when we discovered it (also not consistent with FISA).
@bobnfn1 Various browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. Firefox repeatedly crashed once the government spyware was installed (incompatible?) but I didn't realize at the time that's what it was.
@animaltopper1 I can't say positive or negative, questions on both sides, but we had a fair chance to describe our issues.
@ocmomforanthem We wait for appellate panel to rule. Three judges. 2 months? 6 months? we don't know.
@Katiedidornot As well as I think one could expect in terms of getting a fair hearing of our issues.
@BHH_STIG If we move forward, unfortunately, I expect more years because the govt. delays and obstructs at every turn, it seems. They have all the time and taxpayer $$ in the world.
@Steve_Stuck No, this is more reviewing the grounds for dismissal involving the govt. officials claiming immunity (we claim this is an exception) and discovery issues.
@HdavisHunter Yes.
@HermanfromHartf It's just so hard to say. I will say we got a fair chance to make our points and made them!
Hard to say. We don't need admission since the forensics proves it, but what we don't have is the names. The govt has obstructed our attempts at discovery to get them. https://t.co/08b7MiHYK6
@Chop0Matic Trial court dismissed based on several factors such as government officials' immunity from lawsuits and my team supposedly not moving quickly enough on discovery during a 16-day period etc. We appealed. This decides appeal.
@Seib49 Cautiously optimistic.
@VLNorton68 Dozens upon dozens but we aren't that far and I guess not ready to list publicly, not sure if we have presented in court and I think I generally am supposed to wait to present that sort of thing until it's in court...?
@BACFA Send it to me I missed it. ON the other hand, I do know IG can't prosecute and DOJ hasn't taken up its recommendations in the past, they just die out.
@DaleyRene Probably but I have not been able to find online. I will see if I can post one that I have .pdf of
@RealChrisCotts Three panel appeals court and hopefully back to trial court if we are lucky.
@StopFraud4 Not sure what you mean.  A jury would decide any damages if we make it that far...
@lockjoshua I don't know about it. But little surprises me after I learned what I've learned in this case.
@debadew6 I'm good thank you! I try to turn this sort of thing into motivational energy.
@kimberlyr51 Cautiously optimistic because I know the facts are on our side. However, laws to favor government officials with immunity (one of the issues) so who knows.
@belle819819 @realDonaldTrump I have ongoing requests. I am not usually able to reach his people or him.
@ksondere Things went well, but it doesn't mean we win. Three judges. They were engaged and interested. I think we have very good points, but the lower court ruled against us and that definitely means something to them, I'm sure.

@BlueSeaStars I don't know you, maybe your credentials are better than the govt.s lead pro-vaccine scientist who said this. Accdg to him and other scientists, vaccines trigger genetic predispositions in some kids, so you may not be in total disagreement.

@SandyCukes I thought it was hambone
@WildOrca56 Too.
@AlarsonAnne Often true. And so many immune disorders today! But as you probably know, the vaccine label cautions you cannot get the vaccine if immune compromised because it's dangerous.

@and_kell I know. There's that side of things as well. So sorry!
@GilElliott I wouldn't doubt it. But it's odd that today people seem to think measles is going to kill all their babies. Wouldn't wish it on anyone, why the hyper focus? Far more paralyzed/killed in US lately by AFM EVD68. Why not same attention? #AskQuestions https://t.co/l37HTEVWvL
@btrgoforit @WildOrca56 Also the vaccine can lead to encephalitis and death according to the label and CDC, although this too is believed to be very rare in terms of numbers.
@WildOrca56 True. Also the vaccine can lead to encephalitis and death according to the label and CDC, although this too is believed to be very rare in terms of numbers.
That should say I don't WISH measles on anybody!

@Danishova @VictorB123 According to CDC and the vaccine label, encephalopathy and other serious disorders are also rare adverse events from the vaccine.
@craigster0726 Hopefully everyone will be fine. CDC says these outbreaks come in a few times a year from outside the US and then subside.
PINK PANTHER https://t.co/LtPFHgk53p
@TW_1222 Weird that there's way more of serious injury from this than measles, but everybody talks about measles as if kids are going to die -- while kids *are* dying and suffering permanent paralysis from the disease they don't want to talk about/ ??
@EinsteinNothing OH MY vaguely ringing a bell now
@RickMcCargar Too much to answer on Twitter. One thing is simpler: Yes, I reject the polio vaccine that was pulled from the market for safety reasons. I don't reject the one that remains.
@TioChango_ Who minimized it? According to CDC people very rarely are seriously injured from measles, and very rarely are seriously injured by the vaccine for it.
Forgot about Casper. And Sabrina the teenaged witch. https://t.co/VPtEIa0JIr
@RickMcCargar Maybe! But I didn't have the vaccine in my time and none of us died from measles, either. I don't even know anybody who was seriously injured (though I don't doubt there were some).
@MsClitoris Not me! But there are certainly government and vaccine industry whistleblowers who have made this claim. But I personally believe everything the government and pharmaceutical industry say.
@Sleeverless Absolutely. Same with vaccine injury or death.

@stevegeigertv Don't get me started Geiger! ü§£
@1219ddenney None. (I believe in recent years the CDC attributed a death to measles of a sick, elderly person who also was found later to have had measles in system.)	#IHadMeasles #IDontWantYouToGetThem (#ButWeSurvived #ChickenPox and #MumpsToo)
Nobody wants the measles. But weirdly, many people seem to think Americans commonly die of it when they get it--or become permanently damaged. Very rarely,  according to CDC, serious injuries or death in US happens w/measles *and* also after vaccine for it. But very rarely. https://t.co/NtondLp2St

@dragonlady9947 Who knows, it's the Telegraph who said they were wrong. I probably couldn't name 5 successful models, though I know some earn millions.
@Tommy_Voltaire @Linked333 All cops?
@CheriJacobus @VickieB35168664 The SWAT team commander says it could have still been done with far less show and manpower. Additionally, they are wiretapping/surveilling him so should have some info on whether he's strapped with dynamite or not.
@CheriJacobus @VickieB35168664 I read him that. He still has same opinion. Of course we don't have all the behind the scenes info.
@ColinMcBee @VickieB35168664 "Known whackos" don't necessarily need 1-2 dozen armed officers barging in. If it has to be done, it can be done with far less. It takes a lot of restraint and skill, but is safer for all to tamp down than to ramp up.
@ColinMcBee @VickieB35168664 Maybe routine for some. The SWAT team commander I know best, whose team was awarded first in national competitions, says (without having full info) it seemed wildly excessive and created its own potential dangers.
@Tommy_Voltaire @Linked333 That's hateful and police-o-phobic. I welcome spirited discourse but not hate on this timeline, so please refrain.
@DavidRCrowe @gen35210 I'd be interested to know how many would really be relieved by more gun control; I know a lot who wouldn't because they believe the criminals will always have guns regardless of the law that law-abiding citizens follow.
@DavidRCrowe @gen35210 ...better training definitely seems warranted in many instances on many fronts. I don't think many cops are "paranoid" if they are careful because so many of them are shot and attacked without warning.
@DavidRCrowe @gen35210 There are individual cases but remember, just because a numerical risk is higher for a race or age group or gender doesn't mean it's unjustified. There's much more to be parsed to make such a conclusion. On the other hand...
@Tommy_Voltaire @Linked333 I don't have any reason to doubt that. But as you now it doesn't imply 84% of officers are bad or use excessive force. By way of example, 1 bad cop on a force of 1000 could means 100% of them have seen excessive force used, but .01% guilty.
@Munro90J @megynkelly I have also seen cases where reporters attempting to show minorities in a positive light have actually (in my opinion) been stereotypical and insulting.
@Munro90J @megynkelly I don't think a sweeping generalization works at an answer. There are instances of fair and professional behavior; and instances of -- not. I have worked where reporters bent over backwards to hold minorities in a positive light.
@JimPok @chasbottom I will have to ask him if he did that. Good one.
@chasbottom no
@Linked333 I once got stopped 5 times in about 18 months! Once the cop harassed me, frightened me, screamed at me-- and didn't give a ticket or ID himself before zooming off. I reported him. There are bad cops to be sure. Most are good.

@BMartin1776 That was a newer one...Many computers and devices were compromised and the older ones, first compromised, are the primary ones evidence in our lawsuit (the ones that forensics show were initially infiltrated with specifically identified govt software).
@Meisterling I wouldn't think so. But there's no way to know. I just want a fair shot at identifying who did it.
@BMartin1776 Yes but just so you know amidst the wild misreporting and propaganda, that was a different computer; not the ones forensically examined in our lawsuit. And the IG didn't examine the one captured in the video.

@bpcmd1 It remains different for each vaccine and each person. It's just that Dr. Zimmerman cast new light for many since he's a respected pro-vaccine expert whom the govt. trusted, so if he says vaccines can cause autism, it is meaningful (even if ppl wish to disregard.)
@bpcmd1 I don't know of any unbiased organizations off hand that do that. Thanks for your comment: I don't think Dr. Zimmerman's statements changed anything about vaccination risk benefit ratio...
@Buknob @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure you're not trying to say that it's okay for the news media to make mistakes about the person they're supposed to cover fairly and accurately, as long as he makes mistakes, too. Whoever we cover we are supposed to maintain professional ethics and standards.

Court likely to delay oral arguments in Attkisson v. DOJ FBI for govt. computer intrusions at request of @TheJusticeDept [RT if you want the govt to stop using your tax $ to protect the govt. computer intruders.] @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ZsiQDoGn8F
@ReadYouForFree It was 02 when they took effect.. Carter wiretap was 2016. How would they suspect or know the FBI isn't following the rules? As for me, I'll just say I have solid intel sourcing (prior to 2016) that there are common wiretap abuses &amp; I believe those sources but you don't have to.
@ReadYouForFree Well they didn't know they were falling for anything at the time. They thought they were reviewing verified information as required by the Woods Procedures. And nobody would ever have been the wiser because these wiretap apps not usually ever made public or used in court.
@ReadYouForFree Maybe because of the Woods Procedures, the FISA judges just trust that FBI is following them and had no reason to suspect otherwise.
@ReadYouForFree You'd think. Very odd (to me) that the FISA judges haven't raised hell about this now that they know. Then again, they know more than we do so there could always be something we're missing.
@ReadYouForFree Mueller wrote this: https://t.co/rXDHyZOPpq
@ReadYouForFree Here is Mueller explaining to Congress why the Woods Procedures were installed. https://t.co/Fz2NXs8hKC
@ReadYouForFree https://t.co/0t2UfpgsT1
@ReadYouForFree It is well documented as far back as 2000. That's why the FBI established Woods Procedures. There were many FBI abuses (and my friends at FBI told me of them) in wiretap applications. The Woods Procedures were installed to protect us all...
@ReadYouForFree @ViceUmbrage Verifiying some facts later doesn't change the allegedly improper or possibly illegal behavior by FBI. You and I don't want FBI to not like us and then secretly violate careful procedures to spy on us.
@ReadYouForFree @ViceUmbrage Again you misunderstand; not one unverified fact can be presented to court; we are protected from the constitution and there are policies that actually Mueller put in place when he was FBI director that appear to be violated.
@ReadYouForFree Indeed.
@ReadYouForFree True. One thing we know for sure is the wiretap cited info it wasn't allowed to cite according to Woods Procedures and my intel sources. I would hate for you or me to be surveilled based on an application that had any of this sort of info in it.
@danny6831 https://t.co/YBLFlH2pPs
@ReadYouForFree According to my intel sources who flagged these sort of alleged abuses to me some years ago.. it doesn't matter which fact was supposedly in the mind of the judge; the application is not allowed to contain an unverified fact let alone circular confirmation (Yahoo article etc).
@ReadYouForFree You misunderstand; they weren't allowed to include any unverified facts period; but they did (according to Comey). And it was in the packet submitted, which is forbidden by FBI policy.
@ReadYouForFree I see what you're saying... but the parts they didn't redact cite the Yahoo news article, for example, so we don't have to guess about that much.
@ReadYouForFree FBI cited media reports of info that it turns out they or their operatives/associates/sources leaked in part to justify Page wiretap.
@ReadYouForFree Just parts... https://t.co/MCpoYXSBUy
@ReadYouForFree On a separate note, then the Carter wiretap application (which is forbidden by Woods Procedures from including a single unverified fact) included unverified portions of the dossier and mentions of media reporting on it as justification for wiretap.
@ReadYouForFree KB I don't know if you recall but after Buzzfeed published dossier, there were widespread calls by Dems &amp; some Repubs to investigate.

@techalum87 @ProfMJCleveland Sadly, I don't trust any third party as unconflicted. Right now we have govt and corporations (social media, google, facebook) trying that and all they're doing sometimes is culling out what some don't want others to see; claiming matters of opinion are false facts, etc.
@ReadYouForFree @Dang83616 @Esz1257 Agreed. Further, just because one party says something isn't true-- doesn't necessarily mean it isn't. However, it's so unusual for a Mueller statement, it definitely should garner due attention.

@JayCoffeyVO You knew I was a snake when you let me in.
@JamesVGrimaldi Yes you do. Use them less often. I primarily use people who can't be named on camera to lead me to other people or docs that I *can* eventually quote, and to back up what I learn from others, just for my background in reporting.
@SuzAtTheLibrary @Tiigggerrr Often, yes.
@JamesVGrimaldi Or, if as in the case at CBS, you tell the reporter one thing anonymously to report and then when the rest of the press asks you to officially confirm or deny, you then deny it without telling them you were the original source.
@Esz1257 @ReadYouForFree Hi KB. I think you could speculate a lot of things. For me? I can't read Mueller and have no sources telling me anything. His rebuttal could have to do with new Attorney General coming, or it could be as you raise, that all the other reports are true.

My understanding at CBS was strict policy: use anonymous sources in a story rarely, only when you can't get people on the record after trying very hard; disclose with as much specificity as possible in the story what position they're in &amp; why they want to be anonymous (cont) https://t.co/QcyxNXiroz
CBS took the hit-- and I asked, Why not out the source who lied? The answer was, "We don't want to burn a source." My response: "Why would you ever want to use that source again?" https://t.co/YmcURYqNF3
I don't believe so. This question arose with a White House story CBS reported about Clinton when I worked there. The same source that gave the "news" anonymously (to float it out there and see how it would be received) then denied it to the rest of the press afterwards... (cont) https://t.co/YmcURYqNF3

@AlbaneseJoe @Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Joe, where did you find that gif of yourself?????
@Mywifeissmarter @AdamBaldwin @willsommer Yes but there's a 3d choice according to scientists like Dr. bernadine Healy. Constantly improve vaccination science to make it always as safe as possible for the most. Identify susceptibilities if possible and save those kids, too.
@Schmoop0521 @Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Consensus of what I would consider "mainstream" medicine is that the question of vaccines and autism is settled (no link). And you're certainly free to stick with that line and not read anything that differs!
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez well then you, sir, have been wasting your time on social media today!

@Kolyin @DianeMomofZeus @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez I'll take it.

@AnnaEloyan1 @AdamBaldwin @willsommer I"m so sorry.
@NHThinker1 @Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez 1. We agree 2. Perhaps but so is all of medicine and many scientists say it's worth a try 3. I'm not sure if you're counting vaccines that have been pulled from market and how you're counting damage but you could be correct.
@Kolyin @DianeMomofZeus @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Love? God? I thought you implied you were an atheist.

@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Also I don't believe I've ever claimed anything is "settled science." That's a nonscientific term often used by astroturfers and propagandists. Science is rarely settled, it's always changing and, at its best, advancing.
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Dear sir, nobody can do the research for someone like you, it has to come from a genuine desire to learn. If you think Dr. Zimmerman is a liar, you can take it up with him, but the govt and vaccine industry trusted them as their expert witness to defend vaccines.
@AdamBaldwin @willsommer Some of the most illogical and non-scientific minded on this issue @willsommer actually pretend they are scientific and see not the contradiction.
@Pr1vate_Hud50n @willsommer heh
@Kolyin @csarge001 If you say so, sir. If you say so. ;)
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez The bloggers you cite is one of the best known astroturf propagandists on this issue. (LOL) I see why you are so ill-informed.
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Sir, the opinion is not an outlier by any stretch except to those who are unfamiliar with the body of studies and scientists. I don't care whether you accept it or not, I'm just having a dialog because you seemed interested and are being fairly civil.
@QuazgarTheGreat @willsommer This is the story of an alleged govt. coverup. And there isn't just "one doctor" vs. "other studies." As Dr. Zimmerman described, he based his opinion on advances in science-- there are many studies and scientists who agree with him. Wonder why you haven't heard of them?
I quoted a pro-vaccine scientist the govt used as its expert who says vaccines can cause autism after all. If that's your idea of "spin," so be it. As for your use of "conspiracy theory"-- that's also covered in my book The Smear. #ProvingThePoint https://t.co/wkoikalUWn https://t.co/CsGAGvWAI8
@FBastiat1 @willsommer Indeed.
@darrellpwest @willsommer Oh yes I'm surely a Russian agent in @willsommer book! üòé
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez I quoted him. So take it up with him if you don't like his opinion. Attributing it to me is a little weird. Also, he's not an outlier by any stretch. And if it is, then you're questioning the govt/vaccine industry's judgement (not mine) since they chose him as the expert.
It's always fun to see the attempt in action. From my 2014 book "Stonewalled." (Thanks to @willsommer for providing the example.) ;) https://t.co/PXfaxkxiiA

@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Are you talking to me? I don't think I've ever addressed creationism. Again, if you think the govt expert used to defend vaccines who now says they can cause autism is an "outlier" then 1. you're incorrect and haven't done your reading 2. take it up with him, not me.
@billlawr Yes, I do find the more astroturf/flak, typically the closer to an important truth.
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez Sir, that's false. And I've never done a "hit piece." Your gripe apparently is with the pro-vaccine scientist who worked for govt defending vaccines but says vaccines can cause autism after all. Feel free to take it up with him.
But as I wrote in The Smear, the predictable propagandist tends to attack the reporter or person rather than debate the facts. #ProvingThePoint (Here is Dr. Zimmerman's affidavit for anyone who'd like to catch up and decide based on the facts.) https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE https://t.co/weTLgT8jFO
Fortunately, ppl can make up their own mind as to whether a story on a pro-vaccine scientist who says vaccines can cause autism in exceptional cases is an example of "being a right-wing kook" or "anti-vaxxer." Seems your argument is with the facts; not me. https://t.co/wkoikalUWn https://t.co/weTLgT8jFO
@willsommer I think he's saying *you* got it wrong. (He is confirming my report). Perhaps you lack the knowledge to understand what he's saying. In any event, your silly tactics are all covered in my book The Smear. Thanks for #ProvingThePoint
@Kolyin @Rebekah60291919 @PeterHotez If you're speaking to me, I have never expressed any "anti-vax ideology" and if you're talking about the story at issue, the source is an ardent pro-vaccine scientist who says vaccines can cause autism in exceptional cases. #KnowYourFacts
UPDATED: Media Mistakes in the era of Trump https://t.co/oKw0qkMJ3P
@paul_kangas No idea. I know that a number of scientists think identifying conditions that make kids more vulnerable to vaccine injury (I suppose this could be one) is very important!
@PersonalJihad Our medical establishment has really let us down. Thankfully many scientists are working tirelessly to advance our knowledge-- also identify  causes and cut through the chaos that's sometimes dumped into the public domain via propaganda efforts intended to confuse.
@PersonalJihad "Perhaps." Yes many scientists think our medical establishment has not done a great job at defining what they believe is a group of vaccine-related brain damage and other injuries loosely termed "autism." (Still, not sure I've met anybody who thinks "autism" is "fashionable".)
@QuazgarTheGreat He described some to the DOJ attorneys. There is a great deal of peer reviewed published science about it, and he also said he had learned through several of his own patients.
@ryagiu Sorry, propaganda isn't welcome on this thread! Nice try though!

@GingerMarple @pbrasga Nobody here is buying the narratives you're selling. #OldAndTired ;)
@angryemu1 @KyleBrady1965 @Cernovich I haven't done any-anti vaccine reporting. I did report Dr. Zimmerman is pro-vaccine and flip flopped. That was the point of the story Einstein. And I reiterated at least 100 times in recent day. Best to watch the story you're propagandizing against. #YourNarrativeIsShowing https://t.co/rJrVJWNeyZ
@neal_costello old photo ;)
@lookuupp @eileeniorio It all makes sense when you understand the industry that manipulates info and news on behalf of paid interests. Please refer to my book on the topic The Smear. It all becomes very predictable and clear...
Depends on who you are. CDC says generally most do ok with this vaccine &amp; recommends. Obviously if govt would work to identify in advance the minority of kids who might have problems, which scientists say is possible, we could save them and continue to safely vaccinate the rest. https://t.co/OWbPTUgAb2

@mlbplayer4u 1. The vaccine schedule more than tripled in a short period of time. 2. There are manufacturing issues from time to time as well, but this debate references the medical response to some vaccine in some children.
@MarciaW02564145 @Cernovich What I'm saying is there is more than one doctor. Not "a" doctor. The narrative pushed by propagandists is that there was a single doctor who did this years ago and it was debunked, case closed. That ignores of course all the subsequent science and scientists suggesting links.
@UteManG Not sure they miss the argument, there are small groups of people with different social media accounts repeating the same propaganda, false choice scenarios etc. This has been true for many years. Many aren't naive or ignorant; they're propagandists.
@Electroflxmusic @DavidBernknopf @FullMeasureNews I routinely block unhelpful propagandists or propaganda and you qualified by misrepresenting the factual record and citing known propagandists who spread unhelpful narratives. Constructive dialogue is always welcome. Narratives and propaganda/propagandists are frowned upon here.
@KyleBrady1965 @Cernovich I routinely block unhelpful propagandists or propaganda and you qualified by misrepresenting the factual record. Constructive dialogue is always welcome. Narratives and propaganda/propagandists are frowned upon here.
@NikkiBirnks @AdamBurkhardt1 @LOLGOP @FullMeasureNews I routinely block unhelpful propagandists or propaganda and you qualified by misrepresenting the story, which you obviously did not watch. Constructive dialogue is always welcome. Narratives and propaganda are frowned upon here.
@GinaNic02483743 So sorry for the hardships. I'm not aware of any research that claims all autism is attributed to vaccines, just a research saying that vaccines appear to trigger autism and other brain injury in some susceptible children.
@Electroflxmusic @DavidBernknopf @FullMeasureNews Respectful Insolence the propaganda blog? I see where you're coming from. Nobody's buying what you're selling here.
Sinclair's Full Measure receives widespread praise for autism-vaccine report. https://t.co/EDlZDCtusZ https://t.co/pPvw2da2tS
@Electroflxmusic @DavidBernknopf @FullMeasureNews Yes, that's exactly what we said. Bravo. #LacksReadingComprehension
@FrosterTimer Well then that means you must definitely know more than the govt/vaccine industry's pro-vaccine scientific expert who says science proves vaccines can cause autism after all. Still, there are differences of opinion on all of it.
@yeylinWutani @LOLGOP @FullMeasureNews Indeed. Pro injuring children when it can be avoided is also not a great look.
@2fish1whale @FullMeasureNews Your argument is apparently with the pro-vaccine govt/industry expert who says vaccines can cause autism, after all.
@Agromahdi123 @LOLGOP @FullMeasureNews Compelling comeback, indeed. Or-- you can look at the compelling science and scientists today.
@dufus @FullMeasureNews Very convincing, as well.
@QueerAspie1 @FullMeasureNews You make a convincing argument.
There isn't "a" doctor who liked autism to vaccines. That's a tired, worn narrative. There are many published studies and respected pro-vaccine scientists, like Dr. Zimmerman, who do link vaccines and autism in some children. https://t.co/RSCAgSBFs1
@Plasticdoe @topheradkins I didn't say you'd read nothing; you've read one-sided narratives. Your above 2d statement is wildly, factually incorrect. On the other hand, as I said, you and Keith gave it a good shot; it's just not working here. But thanks for the fairly civil diaglogue and attempt.
@keithlaw @42believer @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews You've given it your best shot.

Listening to one side and narratives is easy. You have obviously done the latter. I can't do the former for you. It's up to you if you wish, or not.
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews I understand. I was surprised by all of it too when I was first assigned to cover this topic. It's a lot of work to cull through the conflicting opinions and studies. That's why it means to much to have govt and industry scientist insiders with a proven track record helping.
@Plasticdoe @topheradkins I've never said or written anything "anti-vax" (more propaganda language but nobody's buying it). Your stubbornness to read or acknowledge science that you disagree with will keep you from being knowledgeable on the topic you wish to debate so eagerly. But ok! #FreeCountry
@keithlaw @42believer @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Respectfully, that indicates you aren't looking for science; you're looking for narratives that agree with your agenda, and you ignore those that don't. It should be the other way around if you are interested in facts and info.
@keithlaw @42believer @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews I think you would like and support his opinions and expertise as long as he said vaccines didn't cause autism. But when he said advances in science show that they do, in exceptional cases, well, now he's a crank (to you).
@keithlaw @42believer @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Untrue. He's published on autism &amp; vaccines. Even so, you're splitting hairs. He's considered by govt, vaccine industry &amp; others to be a lead expert on the topic. Trying to argue he's not is that's silly (&amp; you're questioning the judgement of the govt &amp; vaccine industry on that.)
@Plasticdoe @topheradkins But bravo for the attempt at narrative pushing you've given it a yeoman's effort even if nobody's buying what you're selling. https://t.co/CVSI0Q0edq
@Plasticdoe @topheradkins Respectfully, you do yourself a disservice by arguing from a weak point without knowledge. You obviously didn't even watch the report you're commenting on. Or else you would hear what all my "listeners" heard. I said off the top "vaccines save lives." #GetAClue #FactsAreHard
@Plasticdoe @topheradkins I haven't spread any "debunked" info, you are stuck on old research and narratives. You must still think the earth is flat and cigarettes can't cause cancer if you refuse to listen to scientific advancements. Secondly...
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Dr. Zimmerman is well published in peer reviewed journals on this topic if you'd like to explore. I published his CV at https://t.co/3duSZQk8eO and it lists some of his studies. He has published on the vaccine-autism Poling case as well.
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews I would say the opposite. When people like you refuse to accept "certain" science or evidence and say "published study" that's often been a talking point narrative to distract from facts they'd like to censor (I've learned).
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Well you asked. Yes I believe it because of the person who told me. I wouldn't disclose the name of the insiders who have enlightened me so much (at their own possible peril) over the last decade.
@keithlaw @42believer @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Most people wouldn't advocate staying stuck in time scientifically, as if we can't learn things every day that make it safe. That's why Dr. Zimmerman told the DOJ lawyers he worked for that science has since proven vaccines can cause autism, after all.
@boogman7 @TheJusticeDept Yes but I guess I noticed it from Clinton to Bush to Obama -- in many regards, nothing changed despite the best intentions or promises of those at the top. They even keep some of the same obstructive personnel from admin to admin. So I called it the persistent bureaucracy.
@VickieB35168664 @TheJusticeDept @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You're very kind! Please reach out to The Trump White House and @realDonaldTrump to make your voice heard on this. As well as DOJ.

I have asked a lot of questions, and this is one of thousands of statements and tidbits I've picked up from insiders. I didn't look into it further but he was in a position to know. If I report on this I will track it down. Just thought it was interesting.
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews You may be right. I think we agree; let's save who we can and maintain a robust, safe-as-possible vaccine program that builds public confidence in the system. I have been convinced by various scientists that the two are entirely possible.
@surveillabuse @citizentommy PS the different govts use some of the same software.
@surveillabuse @citizentommy The govt. surveillance trends and abuses are similar globally. I learned this at a global reporter's conference where this was discussed.
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews You'd have to ask the scientist. My kid got the regular DPT and nobody asked whether there was autism in my family; however this was prior to the current wave of concern so maybe it hadn't been cautioned yet.
Sadly, nothing changed. I used to call it "the persistent bureaucracy." Obviously someone doesn't want the info as to who is responsible to come to light. @TheJusticeDept is using our tax dollars to protect the perpetrators. https://t.co/rnFqCMxEO0

@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews We know of some the govt. already recognizes after experience; which is why CDC recommends not vaccinating kids who are ill, who have certain other known disorders and, in some cases, certain family histories.
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews That's the question, isn't it? Is there anybody who thinks we shouldn't try to figure out all of the allergies or susceptibilities? Dr. Healy and many others advocated for that. CDC's Dr. DeStefano didn't dismiss the idea. Makes sense to me.
@ChrisPe49455037 Confusion is a strategy I discuss in The Smear. Propagandists use the strategy of putting so much confusing info into the mix, we disregard all of it (including the truth). Don't give up.
@42believer @keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Nice of him to "want" "everyone else" to be vaccinated without knowing if they have their own susceptibilities.
@keithlaw @hornswaggled2 @42believer @t3tragrammat0n @chelss54 @schadenfreudi @truthvaxwarrior @MrRidleyKemp @doritmi @Corgi_dad @PierrotLL @MikeRice74 @endodoc31 @komonews @FullMeasureNews Exactly. And what if there are other conditions, like allergy, we could identify. Save those kids and vaccinate everyone else safely... I think we agree? That's a position several scientists convinced me made sense.
Govt officials are entitled to great latitude (immunity) when it comes to their activities. We are arguing that the immunity doesn't apply in Attkisson v. DOJ/FBI for the govt. computer intrusions. If they have immunity for this, help us all! https://t.co/Omh2eOPn5n

@and_kell @topheradkins But there‚Äôs SO much disinformation out there and it was confusing so I researched for over a year before my first childhood vaccine story. I do think it was prior to 2007.
@and_kell @topheradkins I was assigned to investigate vaccine adverse events in the troops for CBS re: smallpox vaccine in 2002. I knew nothing of childhood vaccines at the time. One thing led to another and I connected with govt and vaccine industry inside sources.
@topheradkins And I guess you‚Äôre in the tiny camp that would say Dr Zimmerman was entirely credible as an expert witness for vaccines until the day he told the govt they *can* cause autism. Then he became a crackpot.
@topheradkins Incomplete. Out of context. Incorrect. Please do read up. Thank you!
@Sweeeetwater I wrote the book on it. Kinda. ;)
@and_kell @topheradkins I see what you mean. And there are also cases of dramatic and sudden incidences where the brain damage is so severe, no chance of any normalcy.

@MarkAugustine60 I know, right?
@and_kell @topheradkins I don‚Äôt think most scientists believe it‚Äôs invisible, they‚Äôve explained to me autism is the name we‚Äôve given for a group of brain damage that may be numerous injuries/disorders.
@chase_derlla Only if you think only one or he oher is true. Think of it this way: does penicillin save lives, yet occasionally injure or kill people who are allergic to it? Pretty simple and indisputable concept.
@topheradkins No idea what you‚Äôre talking about. To discuss knowledgeably is encourage to read the affidavit and info (https://t.co/ZxNV1i8ynC). It may help explain where you‚Äôre confused. Again you can argue with the govt‚Äôs chosen pro-vaccine expert witness if you like.
@topheradkins You were simply incorrect. If you‚Äôre trying to say you were wrong because you were trying to be nice‚Äîok, if you say so!

@_James_Powers @mrsmolescroft By the way money for damages doesn‚Äôt come from vaccine industry it comes from a tax on us for every vaccine we get.
@radeUNO @AngelaW63765246 No dice rolling necessary. Scientists say identify the susceptible, save those kids, vaccinate the others as safely as possible.
@Dr_ScottK Read the case. Scientists say some genetic conditions can manifest when triggered by vaccination. That‚Äôs one of the supposed susceptibilities.
Pretty hard to portray Dr. Zimmerman as ignorant. His CV is here. https://t.co/OceaUKQlGE https://t.co/BnVTmImFR8
@jcenters I don't think anybody suggests all autism is caused by vaccination. Scientists believe that autism is triggered in some children by vaccination. Others may be born with it or have other environmental triggers. I believe a lot of that is under study.
@joelapp @pawnotes CDC says all measles (eradicated in US) comes from outside the US each year. Many outbreaks are in vaccinated people as some vaccines are showing waning effectiveness. It's not always what it seems or what is reported.
@nenabill exactly.
@fcifaldi There are many possible factors, of course!
@shellbellray @maggiecswart @JackPosobiec @0993210712Dave It's part of their game. I wrote of it in The Smear.
@radeUNO @AngelaW63765246 Yes. It's a difference without a distinction, though, for kids who-- but for vaccination-- wouldn't have autism. Just like cigarettes and cancer. But nobody says "cigarettes don't cause cancer" even though most smokers will never get cancer. The ones who do have susceptibility.

Not autism susceptible children; conditions that make children susceptible to vaccine injury. Scientists say we know of several (such as TS and mitochondrial disorder) but have never studied to find the total universe. https://t.co/TnaZTLYVCP
@loupgarous Scientists say you can begin by studying the medical records of the current population of children who have been paid for damages for brain injury in vaccine court. Simple.
@AlbaneseJoe No that's not my interpretation; that's what two government scientists have alleged. You can believe them or not... if they're not telling the truth, though, and the govt relied on them, that's also a problem. So either way (?)
@Imtheprotagoni1 Nobody denies that's what they say. The news is that some of their own experts say otherwise. And that when asked even they acknowledge it's possible. https://t.co/4zPfqZXWaG
Not when asked by a knowledgeable questioner. And not what some of their own experts have told them. See here: https://t.co/4zPfqZXWaG https://t.co/J3u30qUU46
#TheseAreAFewOfMyFavoriteThings https://t.co/ityp5wMGs7
@Fuquar1 If your kids are vaccinated, why worry? They can't be hurt by the unvaccinated.
(cont) if we ever get to that point, then that kind of research might be fruitful.‚Äù--CDC head of immunization safety. He also acknowledged vaccine may rarely trigger autism. Interview here: https://t.co/4zPfqZXWaG https://t.co/U7mc81uTJN
(cont) He said CDC‚Äôs priorities are gaining better understanding of the pathogenesis/genetics/biology of autism. ‚ÄúAnd then, I think‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd be more feasible to try to establish if vaccines in an individual case, say a person with a certain set of genes‚Ä¶(cont) https://t.co/U7mc81uTJN
I asked CDC Dir. of Immunization Safety whether it was worth trying to figure out what underlying conditions put kids at risk so they can be tested in advance and, if vulnerable, spared...‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very difficult to do,‚Äùhe told me. (Cont) https://t.co/U7mc81uTJN
Since the govt hasn't embarked on studies to identify susceptible children we neither test for it or know all the possibly problematic conditions. Here's another case of vaccine damage- autism with no answer. https://t.co/i29KugjuDM https://t.co/U7mc81uTJN
@AlbaneseJoe One pre-existing condition that proved problematic in a group of children: TS. So if you could test your kid for TS in theory you might not vaccinate him the same way or research would provide ways to vaccinate this population safely. https://t.co/aSLxIuJpLv
@AlbaneseJoe There are no such tests.  Scientists (some) have been pushing to have some developed but govt. won't fund them or launch them. Wonder why.
Several of you have asked about susceptibilities for children and vaccine injury. TS is one medically recognized condition that, according to medical experts, was triggered by vaccination leading to injuries including autism. You can read about it here: https://t.co/N0aJx4Ak8C https://t.co/TfR5hQm5JU
@AlbaneseJoe ...if you're not just messing with me for fun. This time.
@AlbaneseJoe ...scientists have said it would make sense to study the population of brain injured children paid in vaccine court to see what factors they have in common but they won't do it. Lastly, head of CDC immunization told me such a study would be worthwhile. I'll send that link too
@AlbaneseJoe The govt. refuses to do such a thing. There would ultimately be a battery of tests, according to Dr. Bernadine Healy, former head of NIH, who discussed this with me some yrs ago. If you're truly interested I will find her interview link. Also...
@nenabill Not hard. Scientists say mitochondrial disorder, TS and comprised immunity are known susceptibilities. They say we could study the pool of vaccine injured children who have been paid in vaccine court to see what they have in common. But govt won't do that.
@joelapp @pawnotes Not sure the vast majority of parents are ignorant and you'd be surprised how many pediatricians lack basic info on this (scientists say, because of how they are trained and schooled). This I know. Nobody suggests love protects from disease, you're just being silly.
@Imtheprotagoni1 @Cernovich I'm not out to convince, just reporting facts that others are trying to squelch. I don't know if there are many absolutes in emerging medical science. Nothing proves vaccines don't cause autism, that's a fact. Some scientists, including at CDC, believe they can.
@cvanamburg5 @JackPosobiec I wrote about you in "The Smear." #Textbook 	Thanks for proving the point! ;)
@MaxfieldGast @JackPosobiec Also the silly tactic of blaming people who report facts for people who get disease -- really isn't effective.
@MaxfieldGast @JackPosobiec Uh that makes no sense. Nobody I heard said vaccinations aren't important. Just that susceptible children should be saved, which is possible, and maintain robust and safe vaccination program overall.
@csim2827 @truthvaxwarrior I'm so sorry ! The court is in some ways stacked against the families due to the unusual statute of limitations etc.
The thing is: scientists say it's a false narrative to promote it as one or the other. It's perfectly possible to identify susceptible children, save them, and maintain a robust vaccination program. Some say it would actually help maintain and build confidence in vax program. https://t.co/nei6nZ72jx
@fjf1329 @keithlaw No scientist says "settled science." We'd still be talking about flat earth, x-rays at shoe stores, leaded pipes for water...
@sburke85 #TooMuchFun
@MediaSmut @RussellPundit @jammin1001 If you wish to have your facts censored and think that reporting scientific opinion from a govt pro-vaccine expert is dangerous-- well, you're free to stick your head in the sand.
@MaxfieldGast @JackPosobiec You should be ashamed of rejecting science. But it's your prerogative if that's how you roll!
The beauty is: scientists say it does't have to be one or the other. They can determine susceptible children, save them from brain injury or death, while maintaining a robust vaccination program for others. The concept is remarkably simple and uncontroversial. https://t.co/fu2T3RRlct
@Imtheprotagoni1 @Cernovich That's false. Maybe research you have read if you are selective in your reading. If you are widely-read you know that even CDC acknowledges this is possible.
@TannersDad @FullMeasureNews You're kind. I understand what's going on and don't mind; I wrote of this in The Smear.
@RussellPundit @jammin1001 ? Red herring. You're free to discard the word of the govt. vaccine industry's pro-vaccine medical expert they relied on, but that logically requires you to question the other stuff the govt. vaccine industry tells you.
@0993210712Dave @JackPosobiec All genetics are parental. And yet, scientists say genetics are a factor. Just like most people who smoke will never get cancer, but something in cigarettes triggers a pre-existing factor in some. Scientists say vaccination can trigger pre-existing factors in some children.
@Bulldozzer61 that is me
@burtonic I'm sorry I wish I had time to travel that road on Twitter but I don't. They are not hard to find online and some people have gathered groups of them. It's time consuming but it's there.
@WillTell999 Well I'm not the one saying it; just reporting the sworn statement of the Govt's own pro-vaccine expert witness. you can decide for yourself. thanks
@brian_bizarro @keithlaw @KAW710CO @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews ;) ;) https://t.co/3xBpWPmjkb
@_Bancroff --people overreact and stop vaccinating altogether because they know or believe they're not getting the whole truth or proper guidance from govt./doctors
@_Bancroff True. You know one public health official argued in internal email yrs ago that if govt would "come clean" on autism link to vaccines it would create momentary dip but actually build overall confidence in vaccine program. It can be argued that right now--
@AmericanAsPie Well they have a right to know the facts; we can't control how everyone uses facts and I believe we are all entitled to them... I don't want govt, corp or social media censoring mine "for my own good."
@breezenev Scientists like Dr. Bernadine Healy say it would not be difficult to test and cull out the susceptible children and save them, while maintaining robust vaccine program.
@HowardJax50 @keithlaw Indeed. Several "sports fanatics" who are very very interested in vitriol against vaccine safety facts.
@_Bancroff I don't believe that's the case. And maybe you know if you've researched but a lot of reported outbreaks are in vaccinated people due to (according to CDC) disease brought into US (as with measles each year) and diminishing effectiveness of certain vaccine strains.
@AmericanAsPie It's not either or. Scientists say: Stop illnesses, maintain robust program, cull out those who we know in advance might get brain damage or die from vaccination. Just like you don't give penicillin to people who are allergic, but you don't ban penicillin.
@radeUNO Well that is a reasoned, evidence-based tweet that adds a lot to the expert testimony of the govt. pro-vaccine medical witness who says science shows vaccines can cause autism, after all, but that the govt. covered it up and misrepresented his opinion in court.
@brian_bizarro @keithlaw @KAW710CO @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews ;)
@MikeBitchMike @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews Please don't be alarmed by facts and experts who don't agree with your preconceived notions. Discard as you please.
Latest data shows we've paid $4 billion in patient funds for vaccine injuries. Vaccine serious injuries/deaths are relatively rare &amp; most people don't know about vaccine court where they can file, but so many are vaccinated, the numbers still add up. https://t.co/PwyQ2Crl49 https://t.co/WjgfP7ZSnL

@msnightwriter @keithlaw @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews Nothing to apologize for! I appreciate the dialogue, understand the nature of astroturf, social media, the uninformed and narratives, and find it all quite interesting. Thank you!
@areaman714 @MasterDuke1 @mishmashmisty As you may know the first rotavirus vaccine was pulled from market for safety reasons. Questions have been raised about the subsequent one but FDA stands by it as safe and effective, (just like the first one until pulled from market).
@MikeBitchMike @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews "The guy"? There are 100s of scientists/peer reviewed published studies &amp; opinions such as head of CDC immunization, a lead CDC senior scientists and now the govt/vaccine industry's own medical expert witness who says vaccines can cause autism after all. https://t.co/RSldi5gMfo
"Vaccines can cause autism, after all in 'exceptional' cases"-- Pro-vaccine govt./vaccine industry medical expert	What's worse: Sworn Affidavit says he told govt. but they covered it up &amp; misrepresented him in vaccine court to defeat vaccine-autism claims.	https://t.co/RSldi5gMfo https://t.co/M8ZzpCeH8k
@HarryMayUltd @brittertwits @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews Very reasoned and mature of you.
@keithlaw @msnightwriter @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews "Others seem fine"-- True. Some studies blame vaccination as a trigger, CDC has acknowledged possibility (Dr. Frank DeStefano) but others disagree. Adults and flu have odd results: Not sure what odd means.
@keithlaw @msnightwriter @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews My take, according to science:	Vaccines are not safe for everyone: True. Vaccine industry and CDC acknowledge and state limits on labeling. Many infants die immediately: Debatable. Some do; relatively rare in terms of total numbers.
@HarryMayUltd @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews I didn't share any of my "views" in the report; I reported on the views of chief govt/vaccine industry pro-vaccine scientist who says vaccines can cause autism after all. You're free to discard his opinion and published science; I just put it out there so people can decide.
@HarryMayUltd @brittertwits @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews You left off the comma after "follow." ;)
@keithlaw @KAW710CO @endodoc31 @Corgi_dad @komonews Hm. Well I don't sit on Twitter as often as you do, I haven't seen that. Sending select peer reviewed research while claiming other science doesn't exist isn't helpful. I don't approve with any severely uncivil discourse by either side. I don't mean to be silent on that.

@DebbieAAldrich @PatrioticWarri2 Autism cases aren't "few." But taking your point: remember that it's not one or the other. Thanks to today's medicine, scientists say we can save the vulnerable while maintaining a robust vaccine program for the rest, protecting all.
@McquadeGlenn @natewearly Yes wouldn't be too difficult to identify a number of them. There's even a pre-identified study group, accding to scientists: those children whose injuries were paid in vaccine court. What conditions do they have in common prior to their autism/brain damage? But govt won't study.
Thanks for the compliment. We try to inform and bring out facts powerful forces are trying to suppress, as well as multiple sides to stories. I do realize the info can be maddening ;) https://t.co/34QwalYtOt
The problem is, govt experts have acknowledged this would be good to study but will not do so and will not fund such studies. So scientists say there are a few known conditions but certainly not the universe of all. https://t.co/E5hKYkZr3I
@NiklasJonsson91 @Corgi_dad @komonews Au contraire, I reported on factual info from the govt/vaccine industry's pro-vaccine medical expert who says they covered up his true opinions. If you aren't interested in allegations of govt fraud impacting public health so be it. (But most people aren't buying your narrative.)
@Allybaba1963 @TheJusticeDept @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump easy steady place to hold camera.
@PatDownsPhotos You conspiracy nut, you! ;) Said with affection.
@0993210712Dave @gymbeaux143 Wrong. You're a little confused. Oral polio vaccine has been pulled from market in USA because it occasionally transmits disease too patient. The injectable doesn't. This is according to CDC. Since 2000, only IPV [injectable] is recommended to prevent polio in the United States.
@Ralphn8r I don't know but when some scientists suggested it was safer/safest to get individual (M and M and R rather than MMR), the "single antigen" was made unavailable in the US. Go figure. CDC says it's safe and no worries.
@hays_dev No I haven't... but there have been scientific papers that discuss various vaccines and juvenile diabetes. I'm on expert in that topic..
@coblos06 Steve Forbes?
@dah0514 @gymbeaux143 Safe for most people but when injectable available that's supposedly safer. The head of vaccine court told me that the last cases of polio in US were all caused by vaccine and he said it was very sad since safer vaccine was on the market but the oral was still offered :(
@Ralphn8r It's my understanding the govt will not study that or other such issues that seem like they could obviously shed some light one way or another. Which maybe tells us something.
@RealCamas No I haven't looked into that aspect.
@dmduncan2010 Yes solo link at https://t.co/MvkUwjf9Cc right now. You should see it there.

@Linflas @gymbeaux143 I'm guessing there was no live virus in that since a cube but I don't know for sure.
@JustPhilD Kids with mitochondrial disorder, Tubular sclerosis and a cold or illness...
@JustPhilD That's the question isn't it? CDC head of immunization acknowledged in answer to a question that it should be studied-- but govt will not do so or fund the studies. So among the ones scientists know so far are:
@PatDownsPhotos I don't blame the anti-vaxxers as much as I blame the govt for not being forthright and addressing so that confidence can remain and a robust vaccine program can be maintained. Internally that case has been argued for yrs but so far the coverup wins the argument.
@JtSebelius @Corgi_dad @komonews Once again the language of astroturf as described in my book The Smear. Thanks for playing! ;)
@dumaine_st I guess you missed the story. Or too much bong. I didn't make any claims about vaccines and autism. Maybe your argument is with the world renowned govt. vaccine industry pro-vaccine expert scientist who says science proves vaccines can cause autism in exceptional cases. Carry on.
@MichaelGindi1 So sorry.
@tg0326 So sorry.
@iamisgo11 @dumaine_st Yes, say the astroturfers. Yes indeed.
The US govt pulled oral polio vax off the US market in the late 90s. Parents should have been told what the difference was in the two vaccines so they could choose the safer of the two if they wished. https://t.co/0NodNj4afI
@gymbeaux143 Until the late 90s, our docs were offering our kids injected polo vax *or* "sugar water" (oral polio vax). What they left out was that oral polio vax "sugar water" has live virus &amp; carries slight risk of transmitting polio, while injectable carries no risk of transmitting polio.
It's complicated. Some science (Dr. Zimmerman included) talk about a vaccine overload to the immune system, so notwithstanding the type. Other science discusses specific types. Polio vaccine-- an interesting case. I learned in covering vaccines something I never knew... https://t.co/0NodNj4afI

@ASK_Esq29 @TheJusticeDept @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What evidence has led you to conclude, as a thinking man, that the claims are baseless? As far as I know, you haven't reviewed the forensics, since they haven't been presented, and you haven't reviewed the discovery material since it hasn't been provided. Strange, once again.
@ASK_Esq29 @TheJusticeDept @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Not being an attorney, I'm not making the argument.. fortunately.

@FrankinCalifor2 Get out of my head, you little mind-reader you!
@NotABot_bitches @FullMeasureNews I used to think like you did. But I sought the facts and was surprised. Maybe you will be too. If not, no worries, I just want to get various facts out there esp the ones that powerful forces are trying to hide.
@BobKitten @FullMeasureNews Why yes, that's absolutely a reasonable logical conclusion to draw from a report about a scientist paid by govt as a medical expert to defend vaccines in autism claims, &amp; says he told govt vaccines *can* cause autism but they covered it up. Your deductive skills r extraordinary!
@NotABot_bitches @FullMeasureNews Experts I trust say we can identify those conditions (if only we try) and cull out the susceptible and find safer ways to vaccinate them so they aren't sacrificed, while preserving the general vaccine program.
@NotABot_bitches @FullMeasureNews That's why the experts say. some children lack the ability to handle the vaccine-induced immune/fever overload because of existing susceptibilities such as mitochondrial disorder or TS.
@FrankinCalifor2 You can't be that genuinely ill informed.
@FrankinCalifor2 I have never spread misinformation in my reporting. Your mischaracterization is a bit puzzling. Your claim is like saying "data supports medicine." What on earth does that generalization mean? Penicillin saves many lives but can kill if given to someone who's allergic.
@NotABot_bitches @FullMeasureNews I didn't believe it either before being assigned to cover the industry. Govt and vaccine industry whistleblowers pointed me to a lot of little known science and facts and it really changed my mind about the issues.
@FrankinCalifor2 I see, you're like the guy who thinks scientists and journalists are credible not based on their track record, but whether you agree with them on a certain point. When you disagree, they suddenly go from credible -- to incredible (when actually they haven't changed at all.
@DavidRCrowe You can have that opinion, but it's not accurate to state it as if it's a fact that he's become a lobbyist.
@Stan_BostonT @FullMeasureNews Wrong. Congress has committees that do exactly this. (Or should.) They have often investigated medical issues esp when they cross over, as this does, into conflicts of interest and alleged government fraud, as alleged by a pro-vaccine expert who worked for the govt.
@NotABot_bitches @FullMeasureNews If studies that would tell us aren't funded, if researchers who discover links are marginalized, if journalists who report on the issue are controversialized, if vaccine industry blocks Congressional hearings...how would you ever really know?
Why Congress won't look into vaccine-autism links, according to some. Sunday on @FullMeasureNews https://t.co/mKYzUWW6j9
@FrankinCalifor2 I've never said nor written anything "anti-vaccine." It is "anti-science" for you to suppress scientific info. So who is "bad"? Perhaps the one promulgating false narratives and propaganda that mislead on safety information. Fortunately, people can decide themselves.
Text of my original CBS video on vaccine industry and conflicts of interests can be found here: https://t.co/fjc4RXGSSz https://t.co/BfvWKVftTr

@jfetz @PropertyofCLE There are many thousands of cases. If you're really interested, you might want to read up on the science. (Not only what the propaganda media and vaccine industry tell you to think.) Then decide either way. And the story tomorrow helps explain how stories like this are squelched.
@jfetz Further, if you'd like to challenge, then you're not challenging me-- you're challenging the govt./vaccine industry pro-vaccine expert whom they used in vaccine court to defend vaccines, a world-renowned pediatric neurologist. Which is your prerogative if that's how you roll.
@jfetz Not sure what "give it up" means? I'm just reporting factual developments that are important to many people. You on the other hands are stuck on a narrative and admitting that the facts-be-damned. You haven't even seen the story.
@The1stBellicose @ncrebelbelle @jfetz @PropertyofCLE You kind of proved their point (vaccines/autism). It's like other medical reactions... such as cigarettes &amp; cancer... most people will never get cancer from smoking but rarely people do. Yet scientists believe cigarettes cause cancer. Depends on person's biology, vulnerabilities.

@KittyA52 This is covered in my NYT bestseller The Smear if you're interested in the history of Fake News and more!
@now_what__ Very logically supported counterpoint to the pro-vaccine govt. expert who says vaccines do cause autism, after all, but that the govt. covered up his opinion. Bravo.
@DeanBouras @FullMeasureNews Easier said than done; misinfo and disinfo is perpetuated even by our federal officials and medical establishment. Warning forms are rarely shown parents who have no idea they should ask questions. Govt refuses to research vulnerabilities that make certain kids susceptible.
@jsscheff @chuckwoolery Autism involves brain damage and is actually, scientists say, the name we've given to a group of disorders.
@jsscheff @chuckwoolery These can be caused by a variety of factors, some of which are subject to debate. Brain damage sometimes (rarely) results from vaccine encephalopathy-- which the govt and vaccine makers acknowledge.
@jsscheff @chuckwoolery Hm. Not sure there's disagreement: According to vaccine maker Merck, "Developmental disorders are better called neurodevelopmental disorders...neurologically based conditions that can interfere with the acquisition, retention, or application of specific skills or sets of info."
RT @HeyShiftHappens: @SharylAttkisson @FullMeasureNews Thank you for your courage!
Reasoned. Convincing. Logical. #YoureDefinitelyChangingMinds https://t.co/7fMm2oQFiU
@RobertAGVaughn You make a strong and reasoned argument! Much more convincing than the world's leading pro-vaccine pediatric neurologist who specializes in autism and whom the govt. relied on to defend vaccines in vaccine court but now says vaccines can cause autism. You are wayyy more credible.
@Bucktweet_Say @FullMeasureNews If it's nuts, then you're saying the main pro-vaccine medical expert the government and vaccine industry relied on is, well, nuts. That would be another story! But you're entitled to making any silly conclusions you wish in advance of a story  airing or you having the facts.
@jsscheff @chuckwoolery Oh you misunderstood. I didn't say it; one of the world's leading pro-vaccine pediatric neurologists who specializes in autism and defended vaccines for the govt. in federal vaccine court says so (along with numerous other scientists...)
@bobmbx @natewearly PS I'm not suggesting that, but many scientists, govt insider and whistleblowers insist say it's obviously the case that vaccines are not the safest possible for the most possible; govt won't even fund studies to help identify.
@bobmbx @natewearly That's amazing how you have already seen my story before it airs and deemed it "Chicken Little" and decided what it should be about instead. https://t.co/Me5GoENqaa

@chiefjewell But scientists say it's possible to prevent polio *and* figure out which kids might get autism/brain damage etc from vaccines and protect them, too. Simplistic to think it's either-or. It's like saying all kids must take penicillin, even those who are allergic, or we'll all die.
@DrLeachman @ssullivan315 @FullMeasureNews He was credible until (to his own detriment) the day he told the govt who paid him as an expert witness to defend vaccines, that vaccines can cause autism after all.

Agree or disagree? (Language warning) https://t.co/KP1YR66VHi
@chicagocemo And what if they do that, but they also (as the labels acknowledge) occasionally injure or kill? And what if we could figure out who those susceptible kids are and save them, but the govt. decided to cover it up instead, risking the credibility of the entire vaccine program?
@GahannaWestMS @FullMeasureNews ? I supposed you mean shame on the people who allegedly covered it up?
@ChristopherTodd @TheRealHublife @FullMeasureNews Are you saying personal bias from the pro-vaccine medical expert the govt. used to defend vaccines in court? That's an interesting take, indeed.

@604Raincouver Don't blame him, maybe he was considering his future job opportunities.
@gcems645 @Andreaowoodruff Indeed. I can tell you that the pro-vaccine head of vaccine court told me yrs ago that this vaccine has higher adverse event profile than other vaccines and is unnecessary at birth so they recommended it not be given.

@CRobertBuchanan @1stFreeMatt @georgfelis Thanks for sending the link. People can decide for themselves if it indicates somehow that Lancet and NEJM are exempt (or more exempt) from the very criticism made...by their own editors. And whose "interpretation is less-than-stellar." ;)
@CRobertBuchanan What's a "good journal"? Put another way, do you believe that we should pretty much rely on the good ol' NYT and Wash Post and not any of those pesky publications that may report other facts or news and are obviously, well, not "good"?
@CRobertBuchanan @georgfelis @1stFreeMatt I spoke to Dr. Angell for a couple of hours and summarized some of it in this report. You certainly don't have to believe what I'm saying or what she said, but it is what it is nonetheless despite you perhaps wishing for it to be otherwise for your own reasons.
@CRobertBuchanan @georgfelis @1stFreeMatt Angell was talking about in her time there. She says it got worse and worse and they eventually stopped rejecting, and changed their policies to reject less, and she ultimately left. I haven't mischaracterized her in the least, you are making a false assumption.
@CRobertBuchanan Perhaps. I'm only saying their own editors say most of what they publish is not to be believed. Funny? This is questioning authority. Doesn't mean they're always wrong of course.
@CRobertBuchanan @georgfelis @1stFreeMatt Dr. Angell says the New England Journal of Medicine (where she was chief editor) in particular is a problem. Lancet is also respected but problematic according to its own editor in chief. wonder where you're getting your info?
@CRobertBuchanan @1stFreeMatt Maybe, but you disagree with the head of Lancet (who knows a bit on the subject) and the former head of New England Journal of Medicine (who knows a bit on the subject). But who knows, you may know more.
@CRobertBuchanan @1stFreeMatt The opposite of what you said. In the article, (my own report), Dr. Angell (NEJM) and Dr. Horton (Lancet) say most published science is not to be believed and that false or bad studies do *not* get called out very quickly. That's one reason why Angell left.

@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Well for some reason I saw your comment and nothing else. Re : GFM, I appreciate the reference. XO
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 More later.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Your setting is on SUPER TROLL.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 You don't sound open minded; you sound one-sided. Why not take my side if you are being one-sided?
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Again, that's completely wrong. There's no debating about the govt. nature of the intrusions anymore, just the names. Much forensics has been provided in court. The only thing being fought right now is whether govt. officials can be sued for it.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 You must have me on SUPER troll.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 I still want to know why your messages alone show up on my Twitter feed now. NOBODY ELSE'S. JUST JOE! WEIRD. Not that I don't want to see your stuff I just can't figure out why I can't see anybody else for Gawd's sake.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Twitter is not the place to try to educate you about things you know nothing about--and I don't mean that as an insult; I didn't know any of this either. It was all new to me. I'm thankful to the intel sources who helped. --Maybe another time!!
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 About every 17th day my mind sparks and I can type and think faster. This is day 17. On the other hand I need to get to work... stop messing with me~ https://t.co/H657epmCeI
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Yes and some "experts" suggest it's not; yet you forward one non-factual notion and scoff at the fact-based notion. Why not forward both, in the absence of you seeing evidence either way?
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 I don't think you're skeptical by nature. I think you're skeptical of facts you don't wish to believe, but have proven to gullibly swallow any ridiculous blather presented to you that you wish to believe. #SorryNotSorry
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 If you had read "The Smear" you would be enlightened on the root of the propaganda use of "conspiracy theory" as a phrase. Nobody fits the definition better than you. :)
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 And as far as the govt thinking I was "important," their actions with the White House making near daily calls to CBS to try to stop my reporting shows they were extremely concerned, and I was high on they radar, rightly or not.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Also, what makes you think I was the only one? We found out afterwards the govt. was doing all kinds of inappropriate surveillance involving media and politicians. I was one of a group. We don't know how large the group was.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 That's another ridiculous fallacy on your part. The govt. spying on me is no comment as to how "important" I think I am. They're the ones who launched it. I never suspected the govt. was spying on me. Intel sources alerted me. I didn't believe it until the forensics proved it.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Lastly, I haven't alleged "the gov't decided to spy in me because of Fast and Furious." We'd have to ask them why they did it. We only know forensically that they were looking at those files in my computer, among others.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 I haven't named any expert witnesses, so I'm not sure who you're questioning. Also, in terms of proof, you haven't seen any proof that the backspace key was stuck but you have no problem forwarding that false information.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 Touchy? You're the one who sounds touchy. I just correct the record sometimes when-- even long after you've known better--you continue to say the same false thing. Almost seems like you're on a... mission... or something. https://t.co/IQT2hrdPhy
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 As I have learned, there are parts of computer forensics that are exact sciences meaning their findings are fingerprints and cannot be falsified and are not subject to interpretation. (Part of them are subject to interpretation, but the plain stats are what they are.)
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 "Showing what they want to show" is the definition of the "backspace key" allegation-- nobody making that false claim examined that computer but you "believe" that allegation; rather than the professional forensics of 5 teams that did.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 2.  I did not pay for 3 of 5 forensics exam, so another faulty premise on your part (but not surprising). Just don't pretend you're being accurate. 	3.  You know little about forensics if you believe the experts "show what you want them to show."
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 1. If you're interested in being accurate, the court is currently deciding whether govt. can be sued, so nothing is wrong with you wanting to see their decisions but no unfavorable decision has had anything to do with the forensics, just whether these officials have immunity.

@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 (And as I think you know, the "stuck backspace key" propaganda line was not only demonstrably false but didn't even refer to the computer at issue. So as much as you'd like to believe that brought-to-you-by-media-matters-narrative, it's irrelevant to the lawsuit.)
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 3. I am also confused why you want a court to decide something final before you are outraged whereby with so many other issues where there is only innuendo and allegations but you are already on the outrage train.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 ...the court decides matters such as whether federal officials have immunity from being held liable. It doesn't mean the intrusions didn't happen; that's already proven. So you should already be outraged.
@AlbaneseJoe @amcap76 1. I haven't lost every court battle. If that were true, we wouldn't be in year 4 since DOJ first tried to dismiss 4 years ago. 2. I'm unclear on why you are waiting for a court to tell you the "truth"-- the forensics tell the tale...

@cscatliff I get that. And yet...
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I wasn't looking for that story, either, I rarely did any political reporting and tried to stay away. But when she claimed we were shot at and CBS knew I was on the trip (and not shot at) well, it fell into my lap.

@Marty2634 I didn't watch it... Did you? What did you think about it?
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I do love the thought of you doing this, though... https://t.co/lix92DUPsA
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Oh I see, when you read a headline somebody wrote about me, you then attribute the information to me? And again, you believe everything you read the press write? Hmmm if that's how you're going to do your research you're never gonna pass debate 101, sir!
@Marty2634 ..they wanted another reporter who was friendly and didn't know the details of the story to cover it. This is very dangerous in my opinion. I haven't heard anybody speak out against that.
@Marty2634 Written rules weren't needed before. As far as suppression, you may recall that under Obama, I was barred from the Justice Dept, a public building, with officials improperly using their security authority to deny me entry because they didn't want me covering a press event ..
@Marty2634 Acosta should get his pass back but Trump and WH correspondents assn should have worked together on general rules to leave the courts out of it and prevent further restrictions we don't want and never had. Unfortunately, the chaotic atmosphere has brought us to this.
@Marty2634 You can imagine what would happen if that were allowed at briefings: any one reporter could just filibuster for an hour. It would be a free for all with nobody getting any info. Nobody's ever tried that before until Trump. That's why I said
@Marty2634 There's no "right" to be called upon at the briefing; in fact most reporters aren't. And as far as watching it, you don't have to be in the room to see it. Lastly, Trump had actually called on Acosta and answered several questions; Acosta defied protocol and wouldn't sit/stop..
@Marty2634 But to elaborate a bit: it didn't restrict anything Constitutional. There's no inherent right to have a White House "hard pass" (most reporters can't get one, more are denied than granted and you can still get in with a day pass).
@Marty2634 I have a few thoughts...First: I wrote this--	https://t.co/enxyvk1W49
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Ok so after he was criticized, then if he ever visited the troops thereafter it would be (in your view) disingenuous and a result of criticism rather than the fact that presidents do consider visiting troops on Christmas? Maybe you're right, I simply say I don't know for sure.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews So I guess I'm not your favorite media go to person on all that, telling you what you wish to hear. And yet-- you troll me so nicely @AlbaneseJoe
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Even when Ford and Firestone repeatedly claimed they didn't know about the rollover problem with the busted Firestone tires... and I had documents that show they'd known for many years... I didn't call them "lies."
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews there would have to be some documentary evidence that proved they acknowledged they had misled on purpose. That's a lie. Hillary was either delusional, lying, or mistaken/tired and I don't claim to this day to know which it is and haven't weighed in on that.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I also never called Hillary's mistake a "lie." I didn't call Obama's mistaken statements about Obamacare "lies" even when Politifact did. It's rare that a journalist can get inside the head of a politician and "prove" what he or she knew or thought. For me,
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews In Trump's case, you wish for me step in and to comment and draw conclusions on things I wasn't part of and have no first hand evidence about---just 'cause. I don't tend to do that.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews You're getting warmer but not hot. I was on the trip with Hillary and knew first hand we weren't shot at, and had the video showing what happened. Some made a big deal out of it (Obama's peeps at the time did); some didn't (Obama's peeps later made her secretary of state).
I just said this. That's been my experience from learning about trips made by presidents in the past. They aren't spur of the moment. They aren't planned at the last minute but they can be cancelled last minute if it's determined to unsafe. Like if snipers were shooting at us. https://t.co/PtmFEbVXla
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews (BTW in my experience, the plans for the President to travel to danger zone have never been and are unlikely to be planned spur of the moment. He knew he was making this trip minimum of days ago, if it's done the way it's been done in the past.)

@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Do you think that I wrote about the character of Obama, Clinton, Bush? 	I didn't. 	I won't. 	Plenty of people do that.	I generally report on media &amp; underreported issues, whistleblowers, fraud waste and abuse, medical scams, counter narrative, media manipulation, stuff like that.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Oh I see. You believe everything you read in the news. I don't. 	That's the diff.	And quit making fun of challenged children!

@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews You're supposed to talk with your hands. Not loudly.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Not you, talking about Eve. TALKING ABOUT EVE!!
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I've never claimed to be a know it all. I leave that to you. https://t.co/rd4bq9TIuL
Honestly I see almost nobody's tweets unless I go into a former post and scroll &amp; read comments. But every darn post from @AlbaneseJoe shows up at the top of my timeline. Only his. What gives? https://t.co/XFExCUWg9V
@EveHammond13 @AlbaneseJoe @NBCNews Please point to where I've reported on president's character, and then point to the contradiction. It's slipped my mind. And the all caps is super convincing but not necessary since I hear you as loudly with upper-lowercase https://t.co/YnXKB2M4ti
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews https://t.co/QbshXJbXs2
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews All I did was try to respond to your questions and criticisms. https://t.co/Ozs2vhS8DK
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews It's nice that you love your wife and are perfect and have not made any mistakes... I'm perfect too ü§£ but I tend not to judge others as harshly esp when I don't know a lot of the facts.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews You're barking at the wrong dog here.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Not my job. Even if it drives you crazy. And thanks for calling me... https://t.co/x97YjXm3Wd
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews But with Trump, as you know, or Kavanaugh, virtually anybody can say anything and many do report it. Different standard than we used for Clinton. I was part of the discussions.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I didn't take a position. Under Clinton, I was called a liberal. And I agreed with CBS' position that we didn't report on many of the allegations from women that we couldn't verify. It's not that we didn't believe them, but we couldn't verify them and they were very damaging.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I think we can say a couple of things: he apparently loves immigrants -- he married two and has children who are kids of immigrants. He loves Jews since his daughter &amp; son in law are Jewish (and he's given Jared prominent role). But that's counter narrative.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I've not covered those aspects of presidents in the past and I don't know that (for me) it has a large impact unless they were going to be my minister perhaps.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I don't know enough about all the other stuff. I would have to "investigate" myself to really feel qualified to speak to a conclusion on that. Too much proven false info circulated today. Cheating? Kids with different women? Well--
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Interesting shift I think. Had we done this to Obama, that too would have been noteworthy. But the "mainstream" media did the opposite with Obama, in my experience.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews --even without being able to know firsthand. So the difference is that with Trump, formerly well respected news organizations that used to attribute their information to others simply commonly now jump in with opinion and sometimes untrue facts always to Trump's detriment.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews Yes Obama got a lot of criticism. (Hillary's allies started the whitey tape (Blumenthal) and Kenya rumors but the right picked them up and ran.) But I was at CBS and we never reported those things seriously, in fact if anything we took the position that they weren't true --
@PGOperations Preparing for oral arguments in a few weeks. The govt. has unlimited time and $ to protect itself and any bad actors and is doing just that. But a lot of people are helping me &amp; encouraging me to keep up the fight. #DavidGoliath Thanks for asking
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I see two sides. You know I tend to look at things counter narrative (maybe I'm just oppositional).  I am interested in the fact that he is opposed by media, Republicans and Democrats. It's formidable (perhaps unprecedented) opposition, yet there he is.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews And I know something about the industry that seeks to build images for our political figures, good and bad, and many misrepresentations occur-- so I try not to jump to too many firm conclusions based on what we hear or what's highlighted.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I've never known a president well enough to truly assess their "goodness" or character. I tend to focus in the last few years on media accuracy. If the media were making mounds of mistakes in Trump's favor, Trump I would be all over that. So far, no such trend.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I hear and see the criticisms of many and understand he differs with their policies, goals and values. I also hear and see the accomplishments cited by his many supporters and understand what they like about him.
@AlbaneseJoe @EveHammond13 @NBCNews I'm a fan of accurate reporting. It is often misrepresented and misconstrued as being a fan of Trump. Not naming any names (@AlbaneseJoe). What do I think of Trump? Hmmm well...

@EveHammond13 @NBCNews That's it! Trump bends to the criticism of the press and does what they want. Yes, that's his personality exactly! ü§£
@johnstodder 1. Not trying to convince you of anything. I don't care what conclusions you draw. 2. "Accurate when posted--" Now that's rich. ;) 	3. Striving for accuracy is "standing up for my boyfriend"? 	It's okay.. I do support your right to have any thought processes you wish.
@clarkr3000 Exactly.
@7bestoftimes You may be right but I'm not sure how you claim to know what is in his mind with certainty...
The year grows short. The list grows long. https://t.co/1vZUo9mZva
PS: Even if this had turned out to be true, put another way, it could accurately be reported that only 2 presidents "since 2002" visited the troops at Christmastime. Meaning Clinton didn't. Bush and Obama did. There's not a long list either way. It's all how you wish to spin it. https://t.co/ylwuJrNGWU
