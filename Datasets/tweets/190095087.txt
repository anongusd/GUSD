@PhillyCloud1234 @Envision69 @lsnszk @SpeakerPelosi Why would we want more points of entry? You don't make any sense! We want to stop these people from coming in.  NOT ALLOW MORE.
@DBloom451 @SpeakerPelosi Your an idiot. We don't want these people here. Why should we have more points of entry. We need to build the wall.  You don't have a clue of the needs of the people.  You are rambling here like an idiot.
@SpeakerPelosi you voted for border security when #Obama was in office.  Your a hypocrite and playing politics at our expense.
@Inner_Music @flywithkamala @SenSanders 7000 followers is nothing to brag about. You do realize that there are 308 million people who live in the USA.

@senrobportman @SenateFloor @POTUS Build the wall.. protect our boarders.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP BUILD THE WALL! YOU WONT VOTE ON IT LET THE PEOPLE VOTE ON IT
@realDonaldTrump don't give up. Build the wall.
@SpeakerPelosi goes to show how childish you are.  How about start working fir the people. Build the wall. Let the people vote on it
@IamCjCarter @scallawag3 @glaad @TransMilitary No but their mental health condition does So if they have th highest mental health issues they have the highest suicide rates thn add ths 2 the issues that will be caused due to people being ignorant &amp; place these people in a war zone. It does not make sense. Its a safety issue
@twister2254 @glaad @Alyssa_Milano @TransMilitary So its ok to put people who have the hight mental health issues and the highest suicide rates in the military next to someone in battle. Yes they have rights but really let think about safety.
@SubinVJ95 @glaad @TransMilitary Amen
@durden_durd3n @CoryBooker @senatemajldr Then call your congress person and then to vote fr the wall. Do you not realize what illegals hve done to the economy. Check your history wht is lft of the real history of ths country not what the media/ social networks wnt you2 believe. Illegals hve destroyed our county already
@STRENGTHCMD @murphx5 @CoryBooker @Alyssa_Milano @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi Funny the bigger picture is to protect our boarders. To stop people who have not been immunized with third world diseases to cross our boarders. Do you realize how much it cost in the long run to aide these people who are here illegally vs. the cost of the wall?
@Alyssa_Milano ARe you stupid. He is reversing much of What Obama did to the black community. Please educate yourself. My granddaughter has a better chance because of Trump and what he has done for the black community.
@Alyssa_Milano In our shoes for a year. Shame on you! You will never be a single mother in need of an aide or working two to three jobs cause you cant feed your kid. Walk a day in our lives you will see the truth!
@Alyssa_Milano I would rather starve than have they hypocrite democrats in office. Don't you get it. NO you don't.  You live behind a fence in a nice home and don't want for nothing! The real people of America are starving, sick, and dying. Get out from behind your money and walk
https://t.co/Ro06F9SlKg
@flywithkamala @SenSanders She is a racist, a liar, and disconnected from the people who work hard for hard for thier money. No one wants open boards.  She's a hypocrite with a sense around her yard and has security with guns to protect her.  What a double standard
@ArabsForBernie @SenSanders All i hear is words. Not once have you given a plan on how your going to change the problems in our government. So sp taking about what you would like to happen and speak about reality
@MarraSteve @SenSanders In grateful he's my president.  He's trying to protect our country. Walls/ fences work.  There needs to be a reform and till it can happen people need to stop coming in. Our vets, our children, and our elderly need to come first.
@emzanotti @RunsenTom She is about one of the most hateful racist people I've seen so far on tv and in the senate.  It's a shame that people like this have a voice
@realginnyrobins @Missing_Winnie She admits to being a murderer. Does she even know what an abortion consists of.  What a shame
@KamalaHarris That's bull crap your already lying.  You are self righteous and self centered.
@BlueLine614 @LVNancy God forbid we had a a sign that white lives matter or only gave grants for college to white people. But it's ok for blacks. There is a double standard here.  The true question is who are the real racists?
@SenSanders AMEN! WHEN%they took God out of schools this country truly went to crap. There are no more Morales or values. Kids are confused and there is an incredible increased rate of gender identity issues now.
@TheMarkPantano @DimmerDarker They want to go door to door in Connecticut removing people's guns
@TheMarkPantano @DimmerDarker I am hearing that also.  If they don't stop giving the illegals and immigrants more rights and hlp than our own people and keep trying to take our guns there will be a war
@Alyssa_Milano So lying to people. Stop trying to scare people. We yes we.. i recieve snap we will still be getting our benefits a mouth early due to the shut down. There is no where that says we will not get our March payment.
@KamalaHarris Get a clue. You were horrible in your integration of kavanaugh. How do you feel that she admitted she and others lied. How can you help women when your catered to.  You're disconnected. You have a wall/fence around your home but we can't protect ours. HYPOCRITE
@KamalaHarris You are so disconnected from the working family.  Don't bother thinking your wastin my time and our money
@SenSchumer it doesn't work like that. Come to the table now, please @realDonaldTrump  don't. Open the government without thr wall
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/xHDYuJ8EEy	Was effective for #polosi

@SenSchumer @SenateGOP @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Do you see them? Compromise! Hypocrite
@SenSchumer @PeaceCorps What about Americans getting murdered in thier own country?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If they didn't feel they got a free ride by coming to our country illegally it wouldn't be an issue.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Don't you people get it. Yes there will be tunnels. Yet the wall will slow them down greatly.  In the long run it's more cost effective to build the wall than to pay everything we do
@SenSchumer @NTEUnews @realDonaldTrump He's not you are! Come to the table
@__PhoenixIsHere @SenSchumer What about the needs right here? What about the starving children here? What about the needs of our vets
@YMTLife1 @SenSchumer Who cares who pays for it. You have a wall/fence around your home. I bet it keeps people out. In the long run it will cost Americans more money without it
@SenSchumer What about us. Puerto rico didn't want to be bothered with the USA till they need us.
@TheNinjaOfYore @SenSchumer Amen
@SenSchumer Build the wall.  Stop obstructing
@SenSchumer And people like you want to allow people who live by Syria law in our country
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Then meet him at the table.  It's called a give and take.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How can you have a civil discussion when YOU start the conversation with a protesting statement.  #Trump2020 does not speak odiot. You were for this agenda before. Only you changed. Hypocrite
@charliekirk11 Funny how come this is not all over the news? Its a shame the truth doesn't prevail.  The truth is less important than a politician's agenda
@BetteMidler What do expext to happen when you cant communicate the peoples needs #Pelosi and #Schumer are so disconnected from the average person. All your money protects you from the violence of these people.

@GEO_CON_NOT_MEE @tedlieu I can pull information from any site to fit my agenda also.  How many illegals voted? How many dead? How many voted twice in different states? Do you still trust paper ballots?

@chowdallas Amen
@realDonaldTrump I think people are being hearded by the masses.  History is being erased and dems are attempting to remove or right to carry. Our right to protect ourselves.
@lyda @LorelayMainea @SpeakerPelosi Yes cause it's a fence. We want a wall.  Something they can't jump over.
@SpeakerPelosi WHAT ABOUT OUR PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT OUR VETERANS

@SenWhitehouse @FBI So when the FBI finds no proof of her claim and met your demands agree you going to vote yes?  If not it's proof you were just stalling
@SenWhitehouse @FBI You said u were a prosecutor? Then you were corrupt and still is.  Guilty till proven innocent is your motto! You only care about obstructing Trump! U don't care who u hurt or destroy!
@realDonaldTrump Women should be arrested for making false accusations! Where are the laws on this

@SenFeinstein So now that you got what you wanted, an FBI investigation will you vote yes when the FBI clears him again.  If you don't vote yes after the investigation we all will know it truly was a sham to stall and disrupt
@realDonaldTrump It's funny people say they don't want thier taxes to pay for wall.  So then your saying you'd rather pay to house the criminals who have not been vetted, committed multiple crimes,  deportation,  and crossed the border illegally.

@fortismind @CNN So the 58 citations this kid had against him and the fact that he did not receive the motional support needed by his parents and school system is not at fault. Your blaming a gun! Maybe you should blame the system that broke down for this child because his life is also ruined now
@CNN 58 active situations against the child who shot up the school. Dont you think they system failed him?
Stop blaming guns and think about why the shooting happened! 	think about the breakdown in the emotional support system for this child. think about how we failed to support this child and recognized the signs  it was coming to this

@cnnbrk What about the reasons the child felt he needed to act out in such a way! Who was there for him prior to this shooting? There are signs before this happens. This is horrible but we all know there is a need for metal detectors y r they not installed! It's not the guns!
@castusmom @cnnbrk really the NRA put that gun in that child's hands. what about the break down that occurred to make that child feel that he need to act out in such a way. how about how the system failed him. Where were was his support system when he was acting out for help!
@MiaFarrow My son punched a kid for bullying him. It took 2 years for my son to stand up 4 himself. The school didnt protect him! They knw who the kids r, Yet they still put my son in danger! THIS IS THE REASONS Y THIS HAPPENS! My son is only 7.
@kiawikiwiki @MiaFarrow I agree 100%. lazy parents, schools that just dont care!. People need to open their eyes and get active in our children lives. Now another excuse to blame NRA.
@MiaFarrow Guns don't kill people, people do! What the heck if you are and emotional eater do you take away food. No you fix the problem that causes distress. If you take away guns how do we defend ourselves from government control. If you think that wouldn't happen Open a history book!
@MiaFarrow There is a break down in the support system for these kids. There are signs that your child or any child is going through emotional issues. Open your dame eyes people and get active in your child's life!
