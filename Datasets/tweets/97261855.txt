@amborz I apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as our crews work around the clock to address outages.
@amborz Please report your outage again to ensure crews are aware that any previous repairs did not fix a specific area‚Äôs outage.
@amborz Sorry, further repairs may be needed to fix problems specific to your home or neighborhood, such as a line or tree branch.
@amborz If your neighbor has power and you do not, it may be due to a problem specific to your home. Please continue to report your outage.
@katieeeb Crews are hard at work to safely address outages across the region, your patience is appreciated and sorry for the inconvenience
@mrjobez Thank you for the update and for your patience.
@ehrlich_brandon Sorry, I do not have any specific information at this time but crews are working across the region - keep us updated.
@ehrlich_brandon Good question - Crews are unable to conduct damage assessments or repairs until winds are less than 35mph.
@ehrlich_brandon I know it's frustrating but crews continue their work around the clock to restore power and your patience is appreciated.
@ehrlich_brandon I do not have specific information for your location, but as the weather allows them to safely operate we do have crews out

@FrewBrew Thanks for the support Matt! Our crews have been terrific and will continue to do so after the storm has passed.
Safety Tip: Turn off power to flood-prone basements &amp; appliances but ensure you keep power to any sump pumps or drainage equip.
RT @NBCNews: Photo: The latest satellite image of Hurricane #Sandy, as captured by @NASA http://t.co/TIr3btHV

@boredwife101 Also, severe flooding can be an issue for underground lines.
@boredwife101 Overhead transmission/feeder lines may supply power to underground lines. If they lose power, so does the underground system.

Please report outages and downed wires by calling 1-800-898-8042 (New Castle/ Cecil/Harford) or 1-800-898-8045 (Kent/Sussex/Eastern Shore).
Due to the size of the storm, est. restor. times will not be issued until the storm has passed and prelim. damage assess. is conducted.
Stay clear of wires hanging loose from poles or lying on the ground. Do not attempt to move them. Call to report them.
Initiation of damage assessment and restoration work will depend on when the storm passes and winds subside.
OSHA regulations do not allow overhead work to be performed in sustained winds of 35 mph or more.
Safety will be our number one priority. Hurricane Sandy is expected to be a slow-moving storm with high sustained winds.
Customers are urged to complete their storm preparations to protect their families and homes.
In addition our non-field employees have already assumed their special storm response roles such as damage assessors and field crew guides.
PHI is working to secure additional commitments.
At this time, PHI has received commitments for a total of 1,473 crew members, some of whom are beginning to arrive today.
Delmarva Power's  parent company has requested a total of 3,700 outside crew members through the utility mutual assistance process.
Delmarva Power  has 360 internal/contract line personnel and 200 tree removal personnel on the system  ready for quick mobilization.
We have activated field personnel and crews from Alabama and Louisiana to assist with damage from Hurricane Sandy.
Sandy is a storm of enormous proportions and we expect the damage to be extensive and the restoration period to be prolonged.
