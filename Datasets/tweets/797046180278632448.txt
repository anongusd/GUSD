How can villages and families be wiped out in 21st century for a practice that has entered history books as things of the PAST? 	How can Buhari be consistently talking about castle roots in 21st century.

2. Ahmed Bola Tinubu: I remember how he specially narrated the wicked stealing patterns of the then Governor of Lagos State whom he said his own stealing had an international dimension to it. He berated Tinubu then for being a big thief.
1. Orji Uzor Kalu: I remember how he said the Governor was number one not because it is number one alphabetically but, because he had one of the biggest established cases of stealing, money laundering and diversion of funds.

How they bragged that the world is now interested in Nigeria because of Buhari's integrity. 		Fast forward to his full blown dictatorship actions. The foreign governments are now shits and should have nothing to do with Nigeria.
The terrorist who has spent most of his time in London for medical tourism. 		Remember how much they have bragged even though we know is false, about how they have built CONFidence of foreign countries on Nigeria as a country.
A political party that celebrates senseless traveling of it's president as achievements. Don't forget in a hurry all the noise they made during his last visit to Trump, and how they were later mightily disappointed and hated on Trump for the lifeless president saga.
The first political party in Nigeria that physically took it's campaign to UK and the USA. The first political party in Nigeria that had an American seating president (Obama) openly support and campaigned for.
No matter how the issue boils in the country, the terrorist will always wait until he goes to a foriegn country to say anything about the issue. The first government that established branches of it's party in UK and the USA.
