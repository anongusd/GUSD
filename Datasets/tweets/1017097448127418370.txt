@BillOReilly Why would anyone go to you for truth? All you offer is sexual harassment and ignorance.
@MarkMcK02165564 @Exe_973 @SarahPalinUSA Biden suggested that if a seat opened in the summer of an election, the nominating process should wait until after the election to minimize politicization. He didn't suggest waiting for a new president and making the court a central campaign issue.  https://t.co/kYkmIIZJAJ
@SarahPalinUSA A) the last nominee by the previous democrat in office was not given a hearing		B) Trump won the election by secretly and illegally paying off pornstars to avoid negative press, and through the illegal help of Russia

@GOP Based on your record, your mom failed.
@SenateGOP @senorrinhatch did he participate in the confirmation of Merrick Garland?
@realDonaldTrump it's a shame you don't understand that those quotes are backed up by audio recordings.
@realDonaldTrump You clearly don't care if these congressmen are guilty of anything, you just want the investigations to go away.
@GOP @ChuckGrassley We'll give Kavanaugh plenty of opportunities to not answer questions.
@GOP most cherrypicked and partisan in history
@RepMattGaetz your fact pattern ignores the fact that the growth of the economy is due to two things:	1) a continuation of growth that has existed since soon after Obama took office	2) tax cuts have made the revenue for the wealthy is skyrocket while middle class wages are stagnant
@GOP The only part of that I agree with is: ‚¨áÔ∏è
@JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends Dignity? There is no dignity in this administration. If Trump wants him gone then he needs to fire him. If the reason is because he wants someone who'll stop the Meuller Investigation (which has already caught many of Trump's criminal associates), that's obstruction of justice.

@ccw281 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Yes, but what is the wrongdoing? What was the injustice that needs to be addressed? He handed over evidence to the FBI. That is what you are supposed to do. That is what Donald Trump, jr. was supposed to do when the Russians came to him claiming they had dirt on Clinton.
@Nossop13 @ChanceAustin @RepMarkMeadows The dossier wasn't the reason for the FISA warrant. Trump adviser who pleaded guilty, George Papadopoulos, bragged about Russians having dirt on Hillary to an Australian diplomat. That sparked the investigation. The dossier was included in the warrant and corroborated the claim.
@ccw281 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS He turned over evidence to the FBI. What exactly is wrong with that?
@CubHayden @RepMarkMeadows @SaraCarterDC He turned over evidence to the FBI. That is not a crime. That is what good citizens do.
@RepMarkMeadows The dossier was one of many reasons why Trump's criminal campaign members were under surveillance. Bringing evidence of corruption to the FBI is not a bad thing. Nothing in the dossier has been disproved and most of it has been corroborated. Where's the scandal?
@realDonaldTrump Sorry to burst your bubble but your current approval rate is 41.9%. Your current disapproval rate is 53.4%. You must have been looking at your support among Russians.
@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes That "weak recovery" is the cause of the continued success. You're taking credit for the longest Bull Market yet you've only presided over 13% of it. Obama inherited a financial disaster and set us on course for success. You inherited that success, and are claiming credit.
@wdunlap @realDonaldTrump @TrumpsBelle The fines for Obama were largely regarding reporting large donations within 48hrs during the last 20 days of the campaign. Trump paid off pornstars to keep them quiet. Do you see a difference?
@realDonaldTrump While they are investigating these made up scandals, should they also keep looking for Obama's birth certificate? Should they also keep looking for evidence against the exonerated Central Park Five? Which baseless conspiracy theories should have priority?
