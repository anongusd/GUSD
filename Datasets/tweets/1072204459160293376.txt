Losing a loved one never gets easier, I believe you simply adapt to the pain; and although I’m not expecting for this pain to ever go away, I am certainly looking forward to experiencing God’s faithfulness day by day in 2019
But I must admit that although I miss my pastor, my hero, my father figure, my best friend...my grandfather...I’ve experienced God’s faithfulness at a whole new level, Deuteronomy 31:6 is real! - And for that I’m grateful.
To be completely honest, (even though I know this isn’t true) moving into a new year makes me feel like I’m leaving a piece of me behind b/c I don’t have my grandpa here with me. Christmas was...different but beginning a new year just seems odd without him.
Today forces us to reflect on the past year, to think about both the good and the bad but literally all day, the only thing that kept replaying in my mind about this past year was losing my best friend...Every single day I think about my grandfather.
