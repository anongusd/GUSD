Immorality part 3, Trump shut down government to bully both branches of congress out the money to build his wall. This would grant him autocratic power, and be destructive to American democracy. Deep thanks to @SpeakerPelosi standing up to Trump as she should. But #WheresMitch ?
Trump wants to appear to keep his "Build The Wall" campaign promise that he used to excite the most racist of his supporters. He wants to force American taxpayers to pay for a campaign move, to help him get re-elected. That's another aspect of the immorality of the wall.
Based on all of Trump's words and actions so far, he would take the taxpayer funds to build his wall monstrosity from the most innocent, helpless and needy in America, while enriching the most corrupt contractors he could find. #TrumpShutdown
For this reason, I agree with @SpeakerPelosi that Trump's wall is an immorality. His wall would stand as a monument to racism and fear, a hate filled judgement against all of our neighbors to the south, and be built without a mandate from the people. #TrumpShutdown

We the people must:	1) Let every Rep, R or D, know that we need them to block Trump in the invocation of emergency powers for the border wall.	2) Put pressure on our Senators to insist that McConnell brings legislation to the floor to reopen government, and to override any veto.
If he invokes emergency powers that include using the military and its budget to deal with a crisis that does not exist,  I don't think he will ever be able to give those powers up voluntarily.  And how would he even know when the imaginary crisis is over?
Trump is enjoying the power to shut down the government. He is so lacking in leadership and empathy that he isn't able to care about what it's doing to people. And everytime he talks about invoking emergency powers, he uses the phrase "I have the absolute right".

@Amy_Siskind Trump is the epitome of GOP corruption and perversion of democracy, but you're right, we can't think getting rid of him will change it all. However, his ham-handed, treasonous,and transparently hateful actions can really help us focus on our long, national denial of many problems
@Amy_Siskind Very discouraging framing,Amy! As someone affected by &amp; tracking loss of norms since 1981, Reagan began the process. Very encouraged by the power and determination of current activists and I believe this is our chance to really take back democracy. Our country will keep changing.

#RepublicanPowerGrab shows us the GOP no longer sees the United States as an independent land of people with democracy and free will. We are smaller states with wealth and resources to be conquered using our voting mechanisms, and then kept and exploited by any means necessary.

McConnell is seriously motivated to continue to deny and cover for Trump, because the Conservative Court is Mitch's desired legacy (and bank account). People of Justice, I want McConnell charged for the crime of hiding the Russian influence on the 2016 election. #CriminalPOTUS
This is an illegitimate, criminal Presidency. Indict and convict him ASAP. Trump should not be allowed to run for President in 2020. All of his SCOTUS appointments removed. All laws he signed rescinded. All policies returned to pre-Trump status. Imprisoned children freed.
We (the American people, represented by Mueller as SP) will end up proving that Trump's ILLEGAL campaign actions affected the election enough to swing the election to him. Since these were CRIMINAL acts, I want Trump's presidency invalidated and removed from history as a POTUS.
