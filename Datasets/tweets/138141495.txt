There was some reporting that Ed Rendell endorsed Klobuchar, but this sounds like he is backing Biden if Biden runs. (Note: this is what I would have expected. Him not endorsing Biden would be more notable.) https://t.co/henfSR60kF https://t.co/nz7GpkAPoI

Mom went to medical school... Graduated in the top 5 in her class... Started her own practice. And has been practicing in the Bronx for 35 years... Every time I get tired at work, I just think "please, your Mom put up with a lot worse." #hero
Mom faced sexist questioning during the interview process. One such question "would it be right for you to take the spot of a man, when ur likely not to practice after having children?" My Mom: "you're not allowed to ask me that &amp; I believe this interview is over."
In her 30s, she decided to go back to medical school. This was in the 1970s when women, let alone an "older woman", didn't go to med school in very large numbers.
After first husband essentially left her, she decided that she could either go back home to Monticello and cry her days away in her words... Or she could get mad... She decided to get mad and prove folks wrong...
My Mom was someone different. She was became a teacher in NYC &amp; moved to Buffalo with her first husband. There she among other things protested against a sexist bar that allowed women only enter through a back door...
On this #womensday, I'll mention my Mom and her Mom (my Nana)... Let's start with Nana. Nana Esther worked her butt off and aimed to provide a middle class upbringing for her children by running The Esther Manor (see attached). Cook? Clean? Bellhop? Whatever it took, Nana did it. https://t.co/gmLEybCbCa
@POLITICO_Steve I find the poor ratings did correlate pretty much straight to strongly disapprove, but some fairs are somewhat approve instead of somewhat disapprove. Fortunately, this poll also has favorable ratings...
Remember just 7 years ago, Romney was regularly trusted more on the economy than Obama. Obama though beat him handily on who voters thought cared about them. Voters want someone in their corner. Not just someone who helps overall economy.
Why are Trump's approval ratings running so far ahead of his econ ratings running? Approval ratings correlate much better to whether voters feel a prez cares/understands average American. (Voters dont think Trump's econ policies are aimed at middle class) https://t.co/YF5bNDkNbQ https://t.co/n3AyNG15gM

@aedwardslevy Cuse me, if the candidate the candidate i prefer is up in the polls, then it's real movement.
@richardmskinner @SteveKornacki I pointed out to Steve that I thought the cares about average American stuff was key.
I think we'll know more about Beto after he launches. (Obviously that's the case with most candidates.) He went from like 13% in the average poll in December to 5% now. Does he quickly recapture his lost support? or did he miss his time? No clue. https://t.co/ajpejkzu6f
@SeanTrende Sounds like a somewhat similar but even tougher problem to solve as legislators moving left.

Trump may feel genuinely sorry... for himself. Only reason he won last time was cause he faced an unpopular opponent. Polls indicate he is still unpopular &amp;, at this point, unlikely to replicate "lesser of two evils" success in 2020 https://t.co/uXFEytqnPd https://t.co/qh8QE1XFjl

Might be worth an article (or perhaps it is too obvious), but overall approval is far more predictive than economic approval in explaining election outcomes. Trump being above water on econ means zippo if it doesn't bring his overall #s up.

@RalstonReports @TheNVIndy Hope all is well. :)
@FiveThirtyEight Got nowhere to go but up!
I look at polling for 2020 &amp; there's just nothing like that. There's no signature issue... let alone one where one candidate was well ahead of the field. Yes, Obama was seen as a good speechmaker &amp; was inspirational, but he also showed foresight in eyes of voters on a KEY issue.
Apparently Democrats wanna be the next Obama. I do think people forget that a big reason Obama won the 2008 nomination was because he was the only major Democrat to be against the Iraq War from day 1...
@nymetrowx Terrible.
Andrew Yang raised 571k in February. I'm going to bet that's more than some candidates many take more seriously.
@KSoltisAnderson @LoganDobson Dogs &gt; humans.
I really do feel how view O'Rourke 2018 is what you use as the baseline. Is it elections going back to 2012? Or is it just the past few years. Former suggests he's far more impressive. I wrote about that here. https://t.co/NBdZfx2AHH
Good thread from @PatrickRuffini... The more I look at it the less I'm convinced of O'Rourke's electability argument, if we're basing it on 2018 performance... https://t.co/PHxAdtKvIm
For those wondering, Boston received at least 9.8 inches at Logan in latest storm. (I think ultimately it will be higher based on other reports around the area). Central Park received 5.0 inches. Forecasts were fine. What politicians do with those forecasts... Another matter.
New I-95 snowfall standings: 1. Boston with at least 25.7 inches. 2. NYC with 20.5 inches. 3. Philadelphia with at least 17.1 inches. 4. DC with 16.9 inches.
@AsteadWesley AGREED
@NathanWurtzel I for one look forward to all those strikeouts!
Warren's had a troubling start to her campaign... She's struggling among voters who know her best in both MA and NH... Her base of support seems to be going partially to Sanders and partially to Harris. https://t.co/kNmYxZeXVz
Models I like suggest a 5 to 10 inch snowfall from NYC to Boston tonite to tmrw... More likely in the lower part of that range in NYC... Mix line is close but any drizzle to start should quickly change to snow. 1+ inch an hour.
@allahpundit Question wording is KEY here. I think the larger takeaway is electability is more impt this year than in past years. Whether it is a majority position? Can't say.
If Bernie wins in Iowa... Then he'll go to NH win there most likely... That could be a train that becomes difficult to stop... It sets up a very pivotal SC primary... https://t.co/LMAS6zcuDq
I'm not sure there is a greater disparity between Twitter approval and real world approval for a politician than Andrew Cuomo.
@dcg1114 a then b or b then a is always a ?
@dcg1114 Yea but the polling this year has been indicating (and even the NBC poll compared to years past) that electability matters a lot more than in the average year.
@CahnEmily @POLITICO_Steve Strong. Every model has it now for NYC. Could they be wrong? Sure. But not likely.
@NateSilver538 Issue polling is... complicated.
@mattyglesias Schultz sorta throws this more into choice land... I think. The early polls showing opposition split. Could be right. But past campaigns suggest otherwise.
Closer on issues or beating Trump? NBC shows Dems choose issues. Other polls show beating Trump as more important to Dem voter choice, but much depends on question wording. Important to note that many more say beating other side than said it four years ago per NBC. https://t.co/IKN1ArxLTY
@robin_shuster Yea he ain't winning if he is losing nationally by 7. If it's 2 or 3 or maybe even 4, then perhaps...
Trump will need this election to be a choice... He likely won't be able to win if it is a referendum on him...
In least shocking developments of all time... NBC finds that Trump's net approval rating is -6... and that his deficit to a generic Democrat is -7... Pretty simple: if Trump stays unpopular &amp; Dem candidate isn't radioactive, Trump will lose.
@ChrisStirewalt Yes. In fact, Q-Pac asked in 2013 whether it would affect people's votes.
@richardmskinner TY
@richardmskinner Warren link?
@FiveThirtyEight thought this was gonna be about Biden... and then I was gonna disagree.
I-95 snow standings: D.C. 16.9 inches, PHL 16.1 inches, Boston 15.9 inches, NYC 15.5 inches. Unless the models are off, DC will be in 4th by this time Monday. Unclear on 1-3, though probably Philly in third with NYC/BOS battling it out for first.
@SeanTrende @EsotericCD @ebruenig Kevin Kruse and Jeff had some good points on this. I'm a muter, but they made some good points about blocking.
Obviously this is is one poll. It's a fine result for Biden. A good one for Sanders (he's nearly matching his 2016 total with a ton more candidates in the race)... and a meh one for Harris given the emphasis she has/will put on the state.
@JackFromBoston Yea dropped off.

Bernie Sanders looks like he is generating more Google hits right now than for the CNN townhall. For some context, that townhall was watched by over a million folks. Either this is watched by more or by a higher % of people who feel like searching Sanders' name. https://t.co/rLXRTU56MV
@nymetrowx HREF is a fine model.
Getting more snow tonight than from December 1 to Feb 28... Pretty clear that unless something goes wrong, NYC's seasonal total will easily pass DC's seasonal total by Monday morning...

I've become more convinced (which was tough) over the past week or so of the heightened importance of Iowa. Cause if Sanders wins Iowa. He's gonna win NH... and it may be a runaway train.
Per Morning Consult, Sanders is up 6 from last week's poll (see attached). You gotta go back to July for any poll where hit at least 27% nationally (where Morning Consult has him now). https://t.co/THlH4773l6
@Jackalt6 He's a. leading in polling among those who have entered. Never was the case in 2016. b. gotten more endorsements already than like 8 months into last bid. c. he raised more money than he did last time.
@270needed Interesting, the bookies haven't moved too much. Don't know what to make of that...
@NathanWurtzel May have to try.
42 or 43 (?) years ago, my Father was the judge for a case involving Reggie Jackson as a defendant. 1pm hit &amp; my Father declared lunch. Jackson objected, wanting the case decided quick. My Father told him "the court workers are entitled to their lunch hour". I love that anecdote.
Pretty clear to me that Sanders has a better shot of winning the nomination at this point than he had at any point in 2016 outside of maybe the quick period between NH and NV (though I think Clinton would have won SC easily anyway).
@RachelBitecofer @LIsperus Look forward to it :). Your poll that is.

Perhaps it is the case that people just need to search Sanders less given he is so well known? That said, his name was highly searched around launch on Google.
Will take a few days to get full day numbers to compare to Harris, but w/ 100 being highest (hour Sanders announced) Sanders got a 23 (far right) on Google Trends for tonight's town hall. Klobuchar (far left) got a 24 during hers. Sanders in red &amp; Klobuchar in blue in chart below https://t.co/8lyMiE9D8J
@JohnBerman Yea, we're going to need you to tell that story.
It's pretty cool to watch candidates' Google Trends go up in real time during these CNN town halls. I think it's an indication that people are searching for/about the candidates and trying to learn more about them.

@GrandDuer2020 @djjohnso @EmersonPolling @BernieSanders @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538 @538politics @perrybaconjr @rachaeldottle I literally posted this poll on Twitter before anyone else in the media posted it.
Since this account is an equal opportunity offender, let's get some photos of your cute cats/kittens in here.
As I said last week, early state polling (and endorsements) tend to be far more important than $$ raised. BUT, the candidates who raise the most also tend to win. Money raised is certainly a good thing for a candidacy.
Very impressive. Even if you're of the belief that money doesn't win nominations, Sanders will be able to stay in the race quite long with amounts like this. In a crowded field, that is important. https://t.co/DYI6NVzWLa

Google Trends since 12/31 (when Warren went exploratory committee). What you see is Harris w/ largest spike upon announcement. Sanders a close 2nd. You also see a secondary spike for Harris around OAK announcement/CNN townhall. Looking to see if Sanders get similar townhall bump. https://t.co/qLBgngjKGP

@KevinMKruse @NateSilver538 LOL. MAYBE.
@NateSilver538 Can I die now?
I think a lot of this revolves around folks generally believing I want to keep Sanders down or something... If I genuinely believed that why would I compare him to a film that had the 2nd best shot of winning? It makes no sense...
@ShaferSkelton @DjangoHoorides Brown was ranked 10th this month...
@DjangoHoorides Actually Sherrod Brown was far lower than him this month. He'll probably move ahead of *Cory* Booker this month :).
@DjangoHoorides He moved up to 6th this month. And will likely move up more. We're 12 month out. This stuff will change. Nothing wrong with that as we learn more about where the field is and what people want.
First off these rankings change every month. Second off, I wish people would read this. There's really no favorite in this field imho. Not in the way I would define it. https://t.co/6CoAz6Hccm https://t.co/LcND3MQl3i
@Jakie46 @NewDay You don't understand probabilities do you? It aged perfectly. It made the exact point I was trying to make. Sanders has a real shot of winning the nomination. That was the point! Oh my goodness.
(BTW, and once again, I didn't issue odds on the Oscar and haven't done so on the prez race. This is all betting markets based.)
I got a bunch of folks commenting on this analogy this morning as if it were a bad thing (?). I'm not sure why. It made EXACTLY the point I wanted it to make. ~20% chance of things happening occur all of the time. In fact, I love that I said it. https://t.co/jPRwprcr6M

So far the Google trend data from the CNN townhalls have shown a LOT of interest in Harris and far less so in Schultz and Klobuchar. Interesting to see where Bernie shakes out. (My guess is he will be closer to Harris than Schultz/Klobuchar.)
Tuesday Night is hot stuff: Chicago mayoral election (runoff will be needed) and NYC public advocate special election (in which 9000 people are running for a mostly meaningless office).
If the Prez had announced a national Diet A&amp;W Cream Soda Day, then that would be noteworthy. Heck, it might have even carried him to reelection.

I think case is fairly strong that Trump continues to be stronger in Midwest than he is nationally. Wont matter if his net approval is -15 pts. But get it up a bit &amp; a bad Dem candidate, chance of pop vote/electoral college split in Trump's favor go way up https://t.co/A1seqZ2ckR
If you were to put Trump's Gallup net approval rating by state onto an electoral map, you get a Dem blowout. (Not a surprise, it's adults &amp; Trump has been unpopular). But what happens if you put a uniform swing &amp; have him down 2 pts nationally (a la 2016)? Map looks very familiar https://t.co/dySSH8WIQO
@wxdoctor @islivingston YAAAAASSSS
@blykmyk44 @DmpFromPI Derek is more than welcome to believe a state that was 5 points to the right of the nation in 2016 &amp; where Gallup interviewed 2500 folks in 2018 &amp; found Trump's net approval at 10 pts above his nationwide avg is fertile Dem ground in a neutral year.
My take FWIW is that these numbers are fine, not great, for Sanders. Clearly he is very competitive but still well below 2016 &amp; behind on average. (Obviously more candidates running now.) They are not very good #s for Warren Still, of course, so early.
@DmpFromPI Summing up the House vote works well here... and it lines up pretty darn well with Trump's approval rating in the state.
Emerson (see attached) has Sanders 27%, Biden 25%, Harris 12%, Warren 9% in NH. Average of polls since beginning of year: Biden 25%, Sanders 22%, Harris 11%, Warren 10%. https://t.co/a0hYa82BAM

@ShaferSkelton @mizpennylane20 @samhwils @CNN I think media matters.
@jmnalepa Hey Jim, the point of the article was to point out that Trump actually is stronger than most national polls indicate. (I believe in polls.) Hope you have yourself a great weekend :).
@Tahoe19106736 No. Most people like Democrats or like Republicans. Few would vote for a very conservative GOPer and a very liberal Dem.

@ShaferSkelton @mizpennylane20 @samhwils @CNN There's a good paper I saw yesterday about how fundraising moves markets.
@ShaferSkelton @mizpennylane20 @samhwils @CNN Really about how man candidates run and beat the threshold. But yea it is about delegates.
@ShaferSkelton @mizpennylane20 @samhwils @CNN True. I should have been clearer. He needs better margins over his nearest competitor. So 35 to 30% can work better potentially than losing 45% to 55%. If that makes sense.
@ShaferSkelton @mizpennylane20 @samhwils @CNN Haha :). They ask will Bernie sign the pledge to run as a Dem. I said he already said he would. I then said he needs to win more self-id'd dems to win this time around.
@mizpennylane20 @samhwils @CNN What did I lie about?

@LoganDobson What if I told you to give me your Mom's maiden name?
@spiffie Absolutely. FWIW, I was looking at individual donations, but it's still noteworthy, nonetheless.
@POLITICO_Steve I really hope he does. Stuff is like crack.
The funny darn thing is I noted it in the piece and then kinda just dismissed it. Bad... We move forward though and lesson, hopefully, learned.
Fact was when Trump jumped in the polls, it should have been clear as heck that he should have been taken seriously. No, it didn't mean he was a frontrunner or a favorite. But his bid was serious.
The previous data (1980-2012) was pretty darn clear: early NH polling (first half of year before primary) has traditionally been a better indicator than even endorsements on nomination processes. While it's noisy, it was certainly noteworthy.
This piece (https://t.co/KSBGRkknCp) which I cite today (https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG) is a perfect example of why modeling is important &amp; how massively I f-ed up in the 2016 primary.
@databyler threads a needle here I think. You can think that Sanders has a better shot than four years ago, but at the same time recognize that he's probably not the front-runner. https://t.co/jVgnDueYRz
@270needed Don't worry man :). We coo.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt YES. I am very fascinated by this. I think the best predictions will come from media mentions + polling + endorsement data + fundraising.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt When I put in national primary polling instead of NH polling, it's about half and half polling/fundraising. Endorsement data does also seem to tell us something on top of polling.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt So I'm referring to NH polling in particular. (I also have Iowa, though NH "fits" better for whatever that's worth.) The regression specifically is first half of year before primary. DV is national primary vote. 1/2
@kwcollins @dylanmatt I guess from my angle is when I put early money &amp; early state polling into a simple regression (rough I know) I don't see money really doing much. Doesn't mean it doesn't matter, obv. I think ur points are well made.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt By winners, I should have said people who were winning or close to winning. But yea, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. It seems people are strategic... Money tends to folk to competitive folks in prez primaries.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt Yea, I think this is probably right or close to it :).
@kwcollins @dylanmatt Perhaps. I guess my question (and u may be addressing this) is whether I'm learning anything I didn't already know? I don't think I am... Money tends to flow to winners. I think.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt BTW, the betting market reaction to Sanders and Harris certainly corresponds well to what this paper found.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt This one. https://t.co/WX3ZcsHXha I think for congressional primaries &amp; general positive effect of $$$ (even controlling for polling) is well established.
@kwcollins @dylanmatt Question I have is this just *perceived* viability or does it transfer over to actual viability? I can't find a significant effect in predicting winners once controlling for early state polling, but it's quite plausible I'm missing something.
Get the feeling this might get dark fast. https://t.co/xbYt0He0p7

@chrisFnicholson @Graniteprof I should note I mentioned this in the piece :).
@chrisFnicholson @Graniteprof Maybe?... will be interesting to see!
I don't want to give what I think of as trolls the time of day. But I gotta say this is literally based off an article that I did at 538, which I link to in the piece. https://t.co/0uTlMG10lF
@LoganDobson gonna need the last 4 digits of ur SS# as well.
@LoganDobson When's ur birthday?
@databyler Sounds right. Had Edwards stayed in the race in 08 you might have gotten it. (Granted, that candidacy had other major issues.)
@databyler In that way, it's a system designed to stop a contested convention.
This is absolutely nuts. https://t.co/xUe5gCACut
Hoping to bring The [full] Forecast podcast back full time soon enough, but for now we'll be doing Friday briefings. This one on the predictive value of early fundraising in prez contests. If you got questions you'd like answered, shoot em this way. https://t.co/fHC6L67nSu
@Graniteprof If, however, Sanders makes a leap in the polls, that would be quite interesting &amp; a sign that Sanders perhaps should be taken more seriously than conventional wisdom holds. https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
@Graniteprof Bottom line for me: I wanna see where Sanders is in a month. If the polls don't get better for Sanders, there's every reason in the world to view his early fundraising haul as passionate supporters not a wider base of support. https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
@Graniteprof And keep in mind, NH should be a place where Sanders is really strong. He lives next door in Vermont and easily won the NH primary in 2016. Something seems quite askew to me that Sanders is trailing there right now. https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
@Graniteprof In fact, in a regression, it's not clear that fundraising really adds all that much once we take into account early NH polling... That's an obvious problem for Sanders at this point... He's in 2nd to Biden in NH (like he is nationally.) https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
Historically, early primary polling from NH (first in nation primary) tends to catch onto trends even before it becomes apparent in fundraising. (shoutout to @graniteprof for how early NH polling has traditionally been quite predictive.) https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
Sometimes early fundraising can catch onto candidates before polling does. The big example of that was Obama in 08 who made a real statement with the 2007 1st Q report... (There's a big but coming in here...) https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
So I have a bunch of thoughts on Sanders' early fundraising numbers. 1. It's impressive &amp; early fundraising traditionally have been fairly well correlated with primary success (8/13 eventual nominees in open primaries led in early fundraising since 1980). https://t.co/MTcILcfvRG
@amyewalter I read the piece! :) I was riffing off of that reference :). Agreed... Something strikes me askew.
@amyewalter The numbers a month in might be telling for whether Bernie's numbers will move. They were for Trump.
@jbview It was freaky how well it worked on the GOP side in 16. Not so good on Dem side. It's notable to me Sanders wasn't as well searched this time given he almost always led Clinton in this department in lead up to 16 primaries. https://t.co/K8bnhccczK
@jbview Yea, IDK how to interpret. But I think it's interesting and a sign of something, probably.
@ArgoJournal @MorningConsult @politico @AOC Her numbers have worsened (I think) over time.
@hot_karl_marx Harris announced a day earlier than the 30 day search allows for.
@adamperetti It's within the timeframe and allows you to compare search terms relative to each other. So no IDK the absolute numbers, but we know 100 is the top number for any candidate (who is Harris) and then go down from there.
@StaceyCKs1 (I will say I hear this a lot from the women in my life.)

If you want a sign that this isn't 2016 for Sanders' campaign, note he didn't pick up his first congressional endorsement until many months into his 2016 campaign. He didn't get Welch (who he got on day 1 this time around) until Feb 2016.
Sanders' first out of state endorsement from a member of Congress I believe. (Also from Harris's home state.) https://t.co/BbuqGJnYlv
RT @srl: Breaking news: Mark harris says he believes a new election should be called in #NC09
FWIW, I'd mainly be looking at 4 metrics right now: polling, endorsements, money raised and media mentions.
I don't tend to bury any hypothesis because it messes up once. I think more caution is needed however. https://t.co/CyJAw5DAZR
If you're a believer in the endorsement primary, this is one heck of a newsworthy clip from Rep. Gregory Meeks. To say he is skeptical of the Sanders candidacy is an understatement. https://t.co/0JTKb7YYrA
@ShaferSkelton Ha. That's very true. I don't take it personally.
@ShaferSkelton One thing I note in my written piece is I wanna see where Sanders is in a month in terms of polling + fundraising. I think that will be interesting. Also, what does the polling look like if Biden doesn't run? Again, that's why I wouldn't over-read.
@ShaferSkelton So I *don't* see too much of a relationship with number of candidates, but it definitely can screw with stuff if it's historically large. (Small datasets etc.) I'd use this stuff as guiding more than determinative.
@ShaferSkelton Rephrase that a little? I may be able to help out! :)
This is some good stuff https://t.co/AuD6NNjCuq. It also jibes very much with something I pointed out in 2014. Clinton's most ardent opponents were not liberal Dems. They were conservative Dems.

One interesting test for Sanders will be where his numbers are in a month. If for instance, he's tied/leading Biden nationally (i.e. gets a Harris like bounce)... I think of folks who think he can't expand his base may need to reassess.

@CahnLawNY Most campaigns don't report day-by-day during the campaign (as we saw this year). Of course, the two here really line up. These were Dean's 2nd q polls: 19, 21, 19, 22, 18, 21. (His last poll in q 1 was a 21 fwiw.)
BTW, all I'm saying here is that at least in prez primaries early fundraising compared to early NH polling seems to be a lagging indicator usually. (Not always.)
I got a few Dean's... Dean is an interesting case for a few reasons. He was often in the 20s and always in second to Kerry in NH before 2nd Q 2003 fundraising came out. https://t.co/IQ9KwC1aef
@YoMamaisHere92 Sanders leaped into the 30s in NH by mid-June. Long before a. FEC reports came out. b. his second quarter numbers were 15.2 million, which while not bad were less than half of Obama's.
@CahnLawNY Dean hit 22% in a June 2003 poll before second Q numbers were reported...
For a prez primary, I'm trying to think of someone besides Obama who fundraising caught onto as surging before polls in NH did. (Granted, that's one hell of an important case.)
Sanders hopped into second place in an average of Betfair and PredictIt betting markets today. Not a bad few days for him in the markets...

@DemFromCT Should be snowing by early afternoon in the city. Could be a VERY steep drop-off from say Port Chester or Rye to the NE.
Not saying much, but this is the best a snowstorm has looked for NYC this close in since November... and I'm a little? surprised the NWS is going with 1-3 instead of something like 2-5... We'll see. Weather is weird.
@islivingston I think the NWS forecasts for NYC and DC should be flipped...

Small sample size, but it's about a 50:50 shot when people who came in second run again in modern primary era. That's good for Sanders.

@mattyglesias Make up a significant piece of the pie (15%-20%). I think that they didn't overwhelmingly vote for one candidate in 2016 (though clearly supported Clinton) and that NV is seen as least impt of early primaries plays a role.
Bernie lost black voters by nearly 60 in 2016, women by over 20, self-id'd Democrats by nearly 30, and those 45 and older by over 30. These folks are the backbone of the Dem Party. If Sanders doesnt do better with these groups, he will lose. https://t.co/yXmXPZ6Riy

@KSoltisAnderson It's how i get all my clothes.
This is... actually a not that bad a poll for Trump. (Hear me out.) National emergency has previously polled way worse. But more than that, the wall traditionally has polled way worse. This is nearly 50/50. https://t.co/MNybEVcsLG
And yes I know about proportional allocation of delegates... but 15% threshold means you don't need to win a majority of the vote to win a majority of the delegates...
Case for Sanders to win nom: He'll be furthest left in party/electorate moving left. Came in 2nd in 2016/will enter race 1st among those in (if he gets in before Biden). Large field could aid by allowing him to win w/ pluralities/makin it tough for establishment to get rid of him
Some folks think about primaries strangely. In a general, if there's a 50/50 shot of a result happening, that's not really meaningful. In a primary with 10+ candidates, a 50/50 shot of a result can be quite telling.
@bfred34 Oh sure.
@sallybmccarty What I'm trying to say is that a person who had previously come in 2nd has about a 50/50 shot to win the nom knowing nothing else. (Of course we often do more than that.)
@sallybmccarty There's a big difference there. difference between 6 of 13 and 7 of 14 is not statistically significant. Difference between 42% and 52% in a poll is.
So I updated this by adding McCain (who I left off by accident) and adding whether someone was polling in first at this point (e.g. Romney led in 2012 GOP primary polls at this point). Turns out there may be some predictive/explanatory value there. https://t.co/FQL45yxspI
@SteveKornacki Yes, yes he did.
@SteveKornacki I was only throwing together the post-reform stuff mostly... but here's a question (and I actually struggled with this in 08 for a similar reason): who was second in 1968? Was it Rocky with more delegates? Or Reagan with clearly more popular votes?
@Zambrijc I got her at the bottom. I did miss McCain however.
Ah shoot, I forgot McCain! he's in the sheet... just forgot to copy his name into the row! Make it 6 for 13.
@Fyodor32768 Close call for sure, but Romney got more popular votes in primaries and caucuses... But interesting thought of idk.
@quesoylibertad Median for each group is 9 candidates in prior election for those who'd win nomination second time and 10 for those who didn't...
Threw this together... Runner-ups to nominations win the next primary they run in a little less than 50% of the time. This actually struck me as high given that most people who run lose, but it's far from a sure thing. (*Apologies if I missed anyone.) https://t.co/VSO79eBI7q

@FiveThirtyEight K
@extremlyoffline Don't have enough polling of that going back... Could be right...
But yea, if I were looking at indicators this early on, I'd be more inclined to look at national/NH polling than Iowa... as weird as that might sound. Of course, I'd certainly look at all 3... and know it's still really really really really really really early.
IDK why, but again it seemed to work in 2016... Clinton did worse than many surveys indicated in IA/NH where she was doing worse than nationally. Meanwhile, Trump also seemed to underperform in IA...
Another thing that also tends to be true... Candidates who underperforming in IA/NH vs. their national polls then tend to do worse than their polling indicates in both states.
Interestingly, this held pretty good in 2016... Clinton was up through July in NH while Trump was taking hold in NH. Meanwhile in IA, Clinton held a monster leader, while Trump always struggled there...
While at the same time, they pick up on some stronger candidates... Meanwhile, IA may be too close to the action too soon and some candidates (Edwards, Gephardt, Cruz) are good fits for Iowa early on but not nationally.
Specifically, if you were going to look at July polling the year before the primary... NH tends to do the best job... Why? IDK. Could be the case that they pay enough attention to weed out folks who won't have a shot...
Some weird things that may be noise but seem to be true based on history... First, history suggests it's better to look at NH than Iowa or national polling through the first set of debates this year to have the best shot of knowing who is gonna win a nomination...

In fact, no one has a great chance.
@seriousprogress @sam2jav1 @IDreamOnDemand @CNN @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight Those rankings are based on where the Dem party is going (nominating more and more women), poll position (she's 3rd &amp; climbing), possible primary coalitions (AAs &amp; liberals combined can be a good coalition) etc.
@seriousprogress @sam2jav1 @IDreamOnDemand @CNN @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight HAH. I wouldn't see it that way. The article specifically links to our "power rankings" that have her 1. Admittedly, those are based on art/science. There will be an actual forecast soon enough.  1/2

I was looking back at how I used front-runner in past. I'm fairly consistent on this I believe. I called Bush a front-runner but not a favorite in early '15 w/ about same odds as Harris has right now. (Honestly, remembered being much more bullish on him) https://t.co/B2L9zoBFNr
The point here, without getting too in weeds, that the person leading isn't so far out ahead in my mind to be considered a favorite in the way most (perhaps not you and me) people think about someone who is most likely to hold that lead.
@jbview @rachelBitecofer See I don't even see Biden as a front-runner, right now. Maybe he's a front-runner to a lane? But 9 folks (I think it's 9) are already running. He's not dictating the action &amp; isn't most likely to win.
@jbview @NateSilver538 I'm using it to mean really in front. I wouldn't say 50%+1. But I don't see enough of a difference between 20-25% chance of winning &amp; 15% chance to be considered a favorite.
@jbview I'm using it the way @natesilver538 has https://t.co/Nysscso6h8
Kamala Harris is clearly the front-runner right now (i.e. she has best shot of any to win the nomination), but she isn't the favorite. There's a big difference. If u believe the betting markets, there's a 75% chance the Dem nominee is NOT her. https://t.co/6CoAz6Hccm
@JamesPindell Oh Paul...
This is a legit question, so I wanna answer it. I actually do think Pelosi is trying to win more than the base. She helped to recruit candidates she believed would vote against for speaker... https://t.co/szBbhPgGWt
@nymetrowx If I don't get 6 inches Wednesday, we are done.
@EsotericCD Yea, it is... and happened multiple times. Might have been the same person doing it. IDK. I blocked at first, but then muted. Cause it was tougher for them to know.
@EsotericCD I will I have had people create fake accounts of a certain someone who passed a few years ago to troll me.
Yea I think Jeff may be onto something here. I'm just living in a different world. I'll get the occasional anti-semitic remark. But NORMALLY it's just someone saying I'm a corporate shill or something like that. Not worth blocking that. https://t.co/sZN2QnBgrM
@KevinMKruse It could also be we elicit different communities. IDK.
I'll also note I do want to see folks from all sorts of different ideological frameworks. There are annoying folks from many parts of the spectrum. (Some certainly more than others.) I like to let other block or mute if they should please.
@islivingston We lost you long ago.
That's interesting. I guess for me I don't want the satisfaction of folks I'm blocking to know I blocked em. https://t.co/YRNrtKcQyT
I'll never understand those that block instead of mute. But that's just me.
I really need to clean my apartment. I guess I should get started.

@kyletblaine Yaaaaas
@brianstelter TPIR is better than 99% of what's on TV.
The polls continue to show folks are against the national emergency for the wall. Tough to see this changing that basic fact.
BTW, Trump's weakness (or whatever there is of one) in the GOP is DEFINITELY in the center of the party. In the 2018 exit poll, Trump's approval rating among conservative GOPers: 95%. Moderate/Lib GOPers: 78%.
Ron Paul, who came from a very different background, ran for the prez as a Libertarian and later as a Republican.
Bill Weld has... run for governor of Mass as a GOPer, run for senator from Mass as a GOPer, run for governor of NY as a GOPer (he dropped out), run for VP of the US as a Libertarian, and is now running for prez as a GOPer.
@kyletblaine Checking locations. (And don't think that I am joking)
@kyletblaine White Castle?!
@EsotericCD better chance I renounce my Judaism.
It was NOT the case on the GOP side in 2016, but candidate endorsements are usually highly correlated with support in primaries. The more endorsements you have the better shot you have of winning.
Barbara Lee voted with Trump the second least amount of any House member in the last Congress. Per DW-Nominate, she had the most liberal record of any House member. She endorsed Kamala Harris for prez today.
@aedwardslevy Does this mean a CBS/YouGov poll is in? What about if the Washington Post teams up with SurveyMonkey or the NYT does?
@happycycling03 Cause he needs to find something other than the base... Unless, he faces Clinton Part II.
What I can't answer is whether declaring a national emergency pulls down Trump's approval ratings. It can't help though. Trump hasn't had a positive net approval rating in 2 years &amp; needs to boost it for 2020. The political analyst in me is screaming "what are you doing?!"
Border security/illegal immigration in the abstract is a good issue for Trump. Concrete stuff like this is a whole other thing. It polls quite poorly.
It's been said by others, but declaring a national emergency is, at least for now, one of the least popular things you could do. The President has seen his approvals go up. This just complicates matters tremendously. https://t.co/H4xQ5Rgwj7
Most of the polling indicated NYC'ers wanted Amazon in NYC. When tax breaks were mentioned, support did fall. But even with it mentioned, support was very strong in Queens.
Happy Valentine's Day everyone! While each of you and I will have our disagreements, I love that you are you and appreciate you being there. Please let those you love know they are loved and please love yourself :).

Side note: Not surprisingly, people are far more interested in dogs. So let's talk more about them. Did you have a childhood dog? If so, what was/is his or her name? Mine was Cody. He's the avatar you see in front of you.
@ElectProject Of course.
But know this: I don't have an agenda save to inform. I'm not looking to exaggerate. I tend to stick to basics. I'm far from perfect, but just because I don't put in footnotes (because you know https://t.co/s2o8fJh8R3 doesn't have them) doesn't mean I haven't done my homework.
And even when you know and/or note this, it's still difficult to get it across in a way to satisfy every audience. Some of you are like wtf(?) is he talking about. Other of you wonder why the new VoteView has gotten rid of in an easy to read format of most alternative nominates.
There are certain things Nominate doesn't do particularly well imho. It doesn't capture heterodox folks like Rand Paul. That's why it's best to use other measures to check what's going on. (Presidential support scores are one way.)
This is especially helpful for capturing someone like a Gillibrand who has moved left since moving to the Senate. It also corrects for something ridiculous like common space suggesting Harris is further left than Sanders. (Not true).
That said, there are ways to solve at least some of these problems. Something like the lesser known DW-Nominate Nokken-Poole scores are aimed at members of Congress who do change over their career.
I actually have some problems with one ideological score for a person's entire career. Politicians move. People change. Issues change. I'm not sure you really can compare someone 50 years to someone today.
DW-Nominate has certainly been used to argue the parties are going left or right. Most frequently to argue that Republicans are responsible for movement to the right in this country. All of this analysis has been doing using 1st dimension. Not 2nd.  https://t.co/0KiklUjHxf
There are obvious problems with DW-Nominate, as there are any system. No system is perfect. Seriously if there was, then what would we be doing here? That said, using DW-Nominate scores to judge ideology is generally accepted https://t.co/3gWbGTRS3u https://t.co/6rBYv3TP7R
1st dimension is generally thought of as capturing left to right (liberal to conservative) &amp; has been increasingly predictive of all votes. 2nd dimension has historically captured stuff like civil rights voting patterns, but doesnt capture much today (save maybe insider/outsider)
Nerd time for about 5 of y'all. Let's talk a little about nominate scores. They're a way to judge folks voting record. Most often used is DW-Nominate. It has 2 dimensions.
@joshscampbell @brianstelter @mdornic Dogs are the best.
The literature is pretty clear on this btw: reducing legislator salary and benefits is a terrible idea if you want folks from all walks of life running for office.
@NateSilver538 Make sense. Perhaps, it's less about him being underrated than being forgotten. People cannot sleep on him, and I think some are. IDK if that makes sense.
@NateSilver538 Odds you have him at?
@Doctor_Parrot Biden closer to Obama/Kerry/Klobuchar... Sanders closer to Warren... Baldwin probably between Gillibrand... O'Rourke closer to Biden... All of this seems generally correct to me.
Folks, it's time for a serious discussion. I'm going to need your favorite dog breed (photo optional but preferred).
@micahcohen @NateSilver538 Veep and probably not close.
This Wendy's 4-for-4 is so freaking good.
You also have candidates like Gillibrand and Booker who have definitely shed their earlier more moderate images and have really voted more liberally in recent years compared to early in their career.
So there are a lot of ways to judge ideology of candidates, but roll call records are one. And if you believe em, this year's Dem field is definitely running to the left &amp; could provide by far the most liberal nominee in a generation. https://t.co/5qSkm2JcpM https://t.co/JYcVELcCZs
Since the end of the shutdown, Trump's approval rating has risen 1.5 pts in the @fivethirtyeight aggregate. Some pollsters (like Gallup) have shown a larger rise.

@NathanWurtzel Everyone has told you but that's Kate.
I honestly have no idea... And that's what makes Biden interesting to me. I could see him falling absolutely flat... but I could see him doing much better than Twitter thinks.
I guess the question I have after reading this is... Are the strategists right or are the politicians right on Biden? Is the Democratic electorate gonna act the way we think it "should" based on trends? Or based upon what voters say is impt? https://t.co/2RvJvyeCHd
This was a smart idea from @mmurraypolitics @NBCFirstRead... The negative stuff on Warren seems like it was more likely to be near the top of articles on her announcement than it was for Klobuchar. https://t.co/sJr2OMjlnL
@FiveThirtyEight Decent story.
@NateSilver538 Yea, this has been known... It was gonna come out when she declared, no matter when. It's the same thing we see with other stuff. When someone goes for higher office, the bad stuff comes out... It's not a matter of luck or bad timing.
@MainAndMe To be clear, I'm making my own forecast. (I went to weather camp.) I think it'll snow a few inches this week, which added to like the 6 or 7 so far gives us a good chance of getting to 10 on the season.
@raking_forest Essentially, https://t.co/bT7AFuted7
Got a good shot of going over 10 inches (we're in the mid single digits now) for the season for snow in NYC this week. Then rain on Friday... which I'm hoping will set up a blocking pattern for a very good back third of winter.
@DKarol Statewide races are odd... How people vote vs. how they do for federal offices... But in 2014, she did worse than Brown, about same as Newsom, better than Padilla, worse than Chiang, better than Yee, same as Jones...
For the record, Harris has run for the Senate once... She faced another Democrat in the general. No real baseline to judge her electability vs. the average Democrat. https://t.co/HnLv14uUtT

How was your day? (In case you were wondering, I woke up at 619 am, did tv at 7am, hopped on a 8 am train to dc, did some volunteer work at the YMCA, hopped back on an 4pm train to NYC, and did tv at 830 pm... And now, I'm talking to you.)
@LoganDobson The Raiders will play there. ;)
True... but he also talks a lot about Clinton (who he beat)... and that was over 2 years ago. https://t.co/og43ulblvM
@On_Politike detracts*
@On_Politike I average the January polling and get 19% here... which I really don't think distracts from the point.
One other thing. Minnesota behaves a lot more electorally like PA/WI/MI than the vast majority of states. That is, Klobuchar has a history of winning voters Clinton didn't win last time and cost her the electoral college. (Note again: this is general election. Not primary.)
This is also true. Kerry 04 was a bit like McCain 08. He came in strong, dipped in the middle, and rose again. The last nominee to truly come from nowhere in early polling was Clinton in 92. https://t.co/UpgUXCapcH
Obama was in a clear second place for pretty much the entire campaign and regularly polling at or above 20%. As I said earlier this week, people don't realize/remember how strong Obama was in early 08 polling. https://t.co/PMalfKduPn
@richardmskinner @Civiqs I wonder why there is a difference... If there was a hidden effect, you'd expect the numbers to be reversed (i.e. the online poll to be more accepting).
@Chris_S_Kelly @LPeterP Yea this is it... That's why I said "taking into account the national environment". It was more blue in 2018.
@richardmskinner I think they might be intersecting here... So it throws stuff off.
First high quality poll of Virginians post-Northam scandal... Even split on approval and whether he should resign. Racial breakdown also interesting and could give Northam something to fight back &amp; say he should stay. https://t.co/K2cS74HAtg https://t.co/c03wfWQ3Cj
In the betting markets (which are if nothing else a pretty good gauge of conventional wisdom), O'Rourke has fallen off. Not surprisingly, that coincided with Harris getting in, her poll bump, and O'Rourke's decline in polling.... Still, so very early.
Here's the thing: Vermont has an at-large, therefore statewide, House seat. In both 2012 and 2018, Democrat Peter Welch outperformed Sanders. Would suggest, in fact, Sanders doesn't do better than the average left-wing candidate in Vermont.
Side note: I find Bernie Sanders' electability argument based on past results to be a fascinating discussion. He outperformed both Obama in 2012 and Clinton in 2018 (even taking into account the national environment). So better than the average left-wing candidate?
I don't think Klobuchar will win the nomination, but the case for her general election electability is very easy to make. She has won by 20+ points in each of her 3 Senate runs. Outrunning the average federal Democrat that year by 10+ pts each time. https://t.co/gjZX3GcMA3 https://t.co/Rw4rvD43Xa
Anyone dismissing any senator running for president at this point is nutter butter. Most markets have Warren around a 10% chance or so to win the nomination.
@islivingston It is over. Some years just aren't your year.
@FiveThirtyEight What's Micah approval rating?
@gdmATX I mean I don't wake up and ask myself "what does Rasmussen say?" I think a VERY VERY skeptical take on any of their data is appropriate.
@RickJSportPlays Trump has the support of like 50 million+ Americans. it's not surprising he gets crowds. The only problem for him is there are about 10 million more who don't support him. That could change, of course.
Trump's been climbing out of the hole he dug himself because of the shutdown. He's up about a point (maybe more like 1.5 points) since his low. He's still in the lower 40s. https://t.co/UhXkXGWwLB

@KSoltisAnderson I love these photos. Please never stop posting em :).
@ChrisGTwoAgain @RodhamShimmy Polling I have has Obama up ~20 before the unsealing.
@StefanTurk I actually have it right here. Three polls: 1 public, 1 by the GOP, and 1 by the Dems. All had Obama up around 20 points. Kerry won the state by 10. So still pretty popular relatively speaking.
Granted Alan Keyes was a total disaster of a candidate in a disastrous campaign for the GOP in 04, but Obama's 2004 win by % points and by raw vote is still the greatest for an IL Senate seat since senators were popularly elected.
@jeffposter1211 I've thought about this in retrospect and yea I mean I do think that. I mean tough to imagine him being less tbh. I'm unsure he is as electable this time around, but I think he's more electable than people give him credit for.
@PoliticsWolf Yes. Agreed.
Obama was actually *quite* electable per the polling. He was that talented of a politician.
Someone commented in my feed earlier about how Democrats shouldn't worry about electability because Obama won in 08 w/ the middle name he has. Do people forget how popular Obama was prior to his election? His positive rating consistently outran his negative rating by 10-20+ pts. https://t.co/MGFosLCuBa
I might be the only one, but I'd def pay to see a Schultz vs. Ocasio-Cortez vs. Trump debate
I don't know. What I can say is more Americans can form an opinion of Ocasio-Cortez than many in the Democratic field for president. https://t.co/MVitgUBHI5
CNN tested this... Ocasio-Cortez has a higher net fav than Schultz. Schulz's net fav is already -9. Ocasio-Cortez is -5.
I also think there's a tendency to dismiss Biden because his strongest groups are not young, college educated, or liberal. Rather, Biden does best among older, non-college educated, and moderate/conservatives. They make up a hefty chunk of Democrats.
Is Biden's early lead about name rec/not being in race? I think. BUT! top factors in Dem vote choice look like his dream board (e.g. electability, experience) And stuff that are his weaknesses (e.g. being old, not progressive enough) are at bottom of list. https://t.co/uvOzPsGcSb https://t.co/7t8bnj0969
@micahcohen @perrybaconjr Hmmmm
@perrybaconjr My general thought on this is that it shows that there can be "lanes",  but why lanes are so difficult. Even just using race/education/ideology, you see how lanes can get intersected.
Who is the Democratic Party? Using Pew and exit poll data here. Thanks to @perrybaconjr for the Pew data... What surprised me here is how non-college white Dems are about equally liberal and moderate... (See Perry's piece https://t.co/zbpqcQledo) https://t.co/bzQF6GtNBx

Amy Klobuchar has run for Senate 3 times... She's won every election by 20 points or more... and each time vastly outran the political lean of the state. If past elections are viewed as a guide for electability, there are few who are stronger.
Watching those special election returns from Minnesota. #offyearelectiontimebaby
@micahcohen Michael was another fine 90s film from him.

2. Harris didn't suffer like Sanders did for not actually being a Democrat. 3. Harris's speech is occurring hours before any rebuttal... It's just bad politics if Sanders wants any shot of winning the nomination. It's great for him if he wants to keep his base, however.
Just to be clear, I'm not watching any SOTU or pre or actual rebuttals. Differences between Harris/Sanders spiels are pretty simple from an analysis perspective. 1. Harris didn't have a problem with black voters like Sanders did in 2016.
I think you can say Harris had a pretty good launch... Clear climb in the polls and now third to Sanders. O'Rourke has fallen off significantly since December... Biden still in front with about 30%. (*Note, these are just loess regressions of all polls since October.) https://t.co/ctl1zDEv6X
Agreed. https://t.co/5KaYXaZ1yt
In 1 way, this was legit shocking to me. I'd think voters usually prize electability over issue agreement. But it's just not true. This year is really unusual. OTOH, Trump has infiltrated politics in ways those before him havent, so his impt in Dem primary choice isnt surprising
The % of Dem voters who are saying electability matter for their nominee in 2020 is WAY above historic avg. Historically, ~30% said electability was more important than issue agreement. Our 2020 poll in IA found 54% of Dems feel electability is more impt. https://t.co/ABGU4avipm

Did the Patriots listen to Coach Orion before last night's game? https://t.co/m6vKDHG4fG
Or how about by age... Sanders leads Biden 27%-21% among 18-49 year-olds... Among 50+, Biden leads Sanders 38% to 5%.
Looking at these crosstabs from Monmouth... We'll see if it holds with other pollsters, but these splits are something else... Sanders leads Biden with liberals 23%-18%. Biden leads among moderate/conservatives 39% to 9%.
@jbarro To be fair, half the of the candidate supporters who email me support Andrew Yang.
@PollsterPatrick I wonder if very fav vs. somewhat fav is also useful. (I might be overlearning Trump here.)
And yea, I know Sanders gave a SOTU response in 2018 too... People can do what they want obviously, but it probably isn't a great idea when a major charge against you is that you aren't a Dem... and you're giving a response separate to the Dem response.
Black women from the south were a MAJOR reason Sanders lost the nomination in 2016. So he decides to give a separate SOTU response, when the Dem response is being given by a black woman from the south.
@PollsterPatrick Way I think of it is that you'd rather have some basis in THIS reality even if you know that THIS reality may not be the reality in a few months... Better than having no basis in any reality.
resigned* obviously. Phones are phones. Oh well.
Easy way to put this, Northam's approval now with Dems is about where Nixon was with the GOP just before he signed in 1974. https://t.co/fUmR7SqgnO
Ocasio-Cortez is known by more people than more than half the Dem presidential field...
Good numbers for Harris, good for Warren, O'Rourke too... Meh for Gillibrand. Biden is steady... BTW, Sanders has same name id as Biden, 22 pts lower net favorability. 13 pts less on ballot test. And double least liked to be nominee score. https://t.co/XEBOireW3X
Lots of good stuff here... https://t.co/XEBOireW3X
I am pretty sure there is room for a more moderate candidate than is currently officially declared in the Dem field. But tbh, that may not be Biden or Bloomberg or Beto... It may be Sherrod Brown who is no moderate, but is more towards center of party than many running now.
@LamKram Dude they literally never ranked lower than 5th. Gimme a break.

This is very kind of you to say. I'm hopeful others enjoy my segments as well :). https://t.co/ESodlPpXhB
One year from now I'm gonna be like a boy in a candy store. While I prefer primaries to caucuses, nothing quite like the Iowa Caucuses to get the blood flowing :).
Not a lot of polling out with Schultz involved (and the stuff that is out is of meh quality), but it has him at 11% or less. He does seem to take more from the Dems than Trump (at his point).
Is this real life? https://t.co/UOSZTzdkZi
@kyletblaine Uh...
I went to a steakhouse last night. Got asked "how do you want it done?" Answer: "medium rare because I'm an American."
This is one of the stranger press conferences I've ever seen.
@RalstonReports Sup Jon?
@NateSilver538 I didn't get that piece either tbh.
@NateSilver538 My brain is literally exploding.
Democratic voters have certainly gone leftward in last few cycles. but in 2018 a majority of voters who cast a ballot for Dems actually consider themselves moderate/conservative. The fact that there isn't a major candidate from the middle of the party running now? Whoa.
@NateSilver538 Yes.
FWIW, I think there is room for a more moderate candidate. Right now, biggest contenders in race (Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, Warren) have among most liberal records 2017-2018. But, look at who was elected by Dems in 2018: equal # of moderates/progressives https://t.co/rxAbWYQLzZ
If he placed the photo on his page and last I checked all the other photos are of him, then it doesn't mattered. If it was someone else who mistakingly put it there, okay. But he APOLOGIZED for the photo yesterday. https://t.co/Db6o9wCbh6
Can I ask a question? Was it not known that socialism had a more positive view than capitalism w/ Dems? Gallup literally tested it last year. I don't think this is a shock. If it was, where have you been? https://t.co/wqAmTZ2Pjd https://t.co/XBlSxDr85R
This is all I can think of if @jmartNYT's reporting is right re: Northam claiming it wasn't him... (Again IDK how that makes a difference. It was still on his page.) https://t.co/g572B8eMzS
@KSoltisAnderson YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Zachary_Cohen Probably could have said stateside as this is what I meant :).
@NathanWurtzel It is so very obvious.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Justin Fairfax would not only be the only black governor nationwide but also the youngest governor... If of course, Northam resigned and Fairfax took the job.
When the question many are asking after your apology is "are you the guy in blackface or the kkk outfit?", you're in deep, deep trouble.
I have a quote from George Gallup in my yearbook.
@tankcat My HS yearbook has a quote from George Gallup in it.
Well, I thought I was having a bad week. Then I looked at Ralph Northam's week.
@aedwardslevy @amyewalter is this broken down by electoral votes? Until that point, I ain't interested.

@JohnBerman @EricaRHill @NewDay The fact that the one member of the New Day family who actually is a dog (see the avatar) was not invited is a shanda. WOOF.
@kyletblaine I'm the anti-snow magnet this year. Went to NH, snowed in NYC. Went to DC, snowed in NYC. Went to NYC, snowed in DC.
Very strong number. It's one of Trump's best hope is that this continues. (Of course the fact that the economy has been so strong and he is around 40% approval is bad.) https://t.co/wg4C5HP2Dy

Now what about Schultz's chance of throwing the race towards one candidate? Do we any proof he'd actually do that? Not yet. And keep in mind, third party candidates historically haven't thrown races.
So I've been thinking Schultz over, I think it's important to acknowledge that of course anything is possible. Under a perfect storm, he could pull it off. But what is the best odds you can give him right now? 50:1? Markets seem closer to 100:1.
So I looked over the 2016 polling involving a Bloomberg independent run vs. Sanders vs. Trump... Bloomberg was between 10% and 20%. Not nothing, but it suggests to me that the generic independent polling of Schultz is probably too generous to him.
@_Disambiguate @jpVari Actually was quite critical of Harris on tv this morning... I don't tweet everything.
@communistcatdad @sjcAustenite I just like responding to folks. You should see the ones I don't respond to!
@justkarl Full of people playing the horrible music Blehar loves.
@WilliamJ_Smith Not particularly. No.
BTW if you average the polls this month and last, O'Rourke lost 4 points in the primary. It's so ridiculously early so probably doesn't mean much, but it's there.
@_Disambiguate There ain't nothing wrong pointing out it's really really really really really hard for indies to win and that those who even smell it have more of a personality. Doesn't mean he won't win or can't. It just means it's just really really really really hard.
@happycycling03 I'm still going to Starbucks. I just don't think he's a good candidate from what I can see...

I'll further note that this was at a McDonald's in Union Station. For those looking for a demographic profile, it was a white man somewhere in his 50s(?) I guess.
@JTraversDevine He was really enthusiastic about him. It was something.
@JohnBerman Reenactment tomorrow on-set?
Had a guy walk up to me in the train station wanting to talk about Howard Schultz... I'm kidding. Few in the real world wanna talk Schultz. The guy wanted to talk about Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Sherrod Brown and, yes, Eric Holder.
@islivingston Literally racing the squall as I pull into Union Station in the next 15.
You don't need to exciting to be president. It helps draw media coverage though. If you're running third party, you need coverage. If you don't, you become nonviable.
Can I just point out that one problem with Schultz is that he's boring. Even the people who hated Trump couldn't help but watch when he announced. I think an objective observer hears Schultz and thinks "tell me that before I go to sleep, so I don't need to take a sleeping pill."
@Hoosier114 Or is it weather?
Just wrote an article ripping the ridiculous claim made by Brady that the Patriots have been disrespected underdogs. Like Rich Uncle Pennybags claiming he is financially disadvantaged.

@KSoltisAnderson PLEASE TELL HIM I AM THINKING ABOUT HIM!!!!! :)
@mwk89 I don't disagree...
@MikeJGrogan I'm not talking like of ideology here. (Not my game.) I'm talking about electability... He has an ability to win over a lot of folks in a place that shouldn't be too hospitable to him.
@DrKlep I'll offer you this... I don't believe he really can win a Dem primary, but I think he's an absolute genius and knows how to read numbers.
@NathanWurtzel The hot chocolate is okay.
One obvious difference between Bloomberg/Schultz is that Bloomberg actually was a 3 term mayor of a city with over 8 million people. He won as a non-Dem in an overwhelmingly Dem city... and the third time he overturned voter approved term limits and still won.
@smocca It was.
I don't know what open-ended questions for nominations mean because there isn't a long string of them going back. I can say the Dem field looks plenty more like GOP 16 than Dems 16.... which I think we mostly knew.

Honestly, nearly called him Harold Schultz.
I'll bet Howard Schultz will be included in a poll and a fairly soon... If pollsters tested Trump v. Biden v. Schultz... Schultz would right now get...
@richardmskinner I mean voters here thought he did fairly well, even if he probably should have stopped at 2 terms.
@dvhollowell I wouldn't ask it if I weren't interested! :) Glad things sound somewhat decent.
@FiveThirtyEight Read @politico_steve's with it! :)
@POLITICO_Steve TBH, I went straight for the pdf!
@NateSilver538 I'll mark u down as a maybe.
That looks pretty much like the @fivethirtyeight average with voters https://t.co/InRMzIwXZX ... So the numbers look fine... The problem is the districts are too GOP skewed to present an accurate picture of the country.
RE: RNC memo on Trump being bolstered by shutdown. On avg, Trump won these districts by 12 when he was lost nationally by 2 (i.e. they're 14 more pts more GOP than nation). So Trump approval +1 in them among voters suggests he's at -13 nationally. (1/2) https://t.co/CRICFhSFzI
Was going to answer a troll... and realized "what's the point?" How you doing?
@jedshug @joshchafetz I didn't find a lot of proof that third party candidates took more from Clinton than Trump. So agreed.
@NateSilver538 @SeanTrende 2. Was Perot pulling more from Bush or Clinton when he entered (I'm not talking exits at end of campaign)? Answer: He was. Again, none of this answers Sean's larger q, but I'm suspect of belief Perot changed the winner.
@NateSilver538 @SeanTrende No one can answer Sean's biggest question. What if Perot doesn't run? What we can answer (I think) is 1. Where was Bush's approval before and after Perot entered? Answer: Mostly stable in high 30s, perhaps small decline.
@DavidWright_CNN K. lol
A complicating factor in all of this is that Clinton was in a ridiculous primary when Perot was getting in, so that helped to bring down Clinton's numbers. Once the primary was over and the DNC happened, you see Clinton/Bush margin matching what Bush's approval would suggest
I also looked at Bush's approval rating when Perot went on King on 2/20 and then through early July before Perot got out... It was consistently in the high 30s... which is about where it was on E-Day 1992 as well.
Lots of focus on how Perot took evenly from Bush/Clinton in the fall of 1992, but I was curious if he was doing so during Spring/early Summer (before he dropped out). Answer is clearly yes. The turning point of campaign is DNC, which was occurring right at last datapoint on right https://t.co/RXEkAWg2qY
Another poll showing voters don't want a national emergency for the wall... https://t.co/BGenZwkqVd
@joshchafetz Not at all confident, but if you're a Democrat why would you want the risk if you think you'll beat Trump in a one-on-one.
When Birmingham, AL is going to end up with more snow than NYC during the meteorological winter... https://t.co/v17tg7jjkA
@ScottyP16 Different question, different response :). Nader voters were like 42-27 for Gore, iirc.
@dcg1114 @SteveKornacki Sounds right to me.
As a polling guy, I don't believe Perot played a huge role in determining the winner. There are some who argue that he changed the direction/tone of the campaign. That could be right, but I can't find proof of that in the data. https://t.co/aklQNJb1Cz
If you believe the polls, the one campaign where a third party candidate really played a key role: 1968. Wallace voters were, per pre-election polls, heavily Nixon leaning in a two-way.
@SteveKornacki I looked at the early polls in that year too, as your graphic shows... Carter's edge (and then deficit) didn't really seem affected much at all by introducing Anderson into the ballot.
I think both of these are true. 1. I don't think there is a lot of proof to suggest Schultz would take from Dems. (Could be, but IDK.) 2. If Trump's approval is on E-Day where it is now, then he'd likely lose in a 2-way. 3-way could change math. Hence, I get why Dems aren't happy
@richardmskinner This is 100% correct.
@heatherp85 PRO EXPANSION.

@JohnBerman @Patriots Don't make me change my end of segment to show the Pats are the least liked team in the country.
This is essentially the reverse of what happened with the tax cut. Trump got it, despite it polling poorly... and his numbers actually went up. Here he got nothing and just perturbed folks. https://t.co/PI2IJXpkgR

Richard Ojeda is out of the race for president. https://t.co/2UCqYfZkcM
@micahcohen I got two copies ready for my Saturday column. One if he makes the deal. One if he doesn't.
If there is in fact going to be a deal, the numbers are clear. Trump lost and was losing multiple points off his approval rating. Pelosi was actually slightly gaining points on her's. Voters overwhelmingly blamed Trump/GOP for the shutdown. Trump lost the shutdown. Pelosi won.
@ComfortablySmug @allahpundit Is that also the place where I get my massive payoffs for putting Harris 1? :)
@allahpundit I can tell you first hand that I had a segment ready to go at 6:50. They teased it earlier in the show. I was in the building for my hit. It was just a good educational guess.
Oh and now airports are get screwed up. When it rains, it pours.
@SopanDeb @roywoodjr Roy's a very nice man.
Trump's approval rating is falling, the economy may see no expansion this quarter (per the Trump administration), and Russian troubles are ramping up (not disappearing). Total disaster.
@roderickburrell @smotus I think that black voters on the whole would see a major difference between Harris and Gabbard... Not to mention that most black voters are older. So you could be right in your application, but it doesn't apply to the entire electorate.
@EdAsante77 Not my place to comment on the first. On the second, you could be right. There's a reason I'd bet the field over Harris... and it's not particularly close :).
@dcg1114 Sure, southern black voters are big league when it comes to nomination fights.
@dcg1114 I don't think we're in disagreement here(?).
@MysteryPollster @jbview @SteveKornacki @xenocryptsite I can see it all 3 ways... I do think the Gore example cited by Jonathan and Steve is a really good one. It's actually probably the best one, even better than Giuliani.
@MysteryPollster @jbview @SteveKornacki @xenocryptsite I do love you kept a diary on this :). You should put it all up online. Well the appropriate parts anyway, haha.
Black voters will NOT vote for a black candidate solely because of skin color. The literature tells us however that "most blacks believe that blacks better represent blacks". It's silly to ignore the importance of race in our politics &amp; on vote choice. https://t.co/O4VNthShSv

@HotlineJosh :)
@SteveKornacki @xenocryptsite That's a good one. I should have used that one! I used Glenn opening 43 state offices...
@HotlineJosh Bush wasn't polling that much better at this point in 88 tbh. Gore was... and I've pretty much run out of examples, haha.
All of that makes me think he has a better shot than I think (?) most of you think, but far below where polls indicate he is at this point... But you know it's a wide open field... and I say if he wants to run, he should. (As I believe for every pol.) Let the people decide.
What's the case against Biden? His record (and it's lonnnnng). The fact that he is a dude when women are getting nominated in record numbers. And while Dems may nominate an older person, he's going to be near 80 come 2020.
What's the case for Biden? His polls. The fact that the vast majority of Dem voters are over 40, still are moderate or conservative (if you believe the 2018 exits), and a majority of Dems want the party to go the center (per Gallup). (1/2?)
@joshscampbell You're included. Popeyes soon?

Of course, Trump's numbers could (&amp; I'd bet will) recover post-shutdown. But, as I wrote a month ago, his actions are a clear indication that he learned nothing from the midterms. He's just interested in his base, &amp; it isn't large enough to win reelection. https://t.co/KdA36REfdP

@postposadist @smotus Prob not cause I'd bet on the field to win the nom...
@JosephBornstein I'm more than familiar... Of course, Koch was a Dem... and Rudy ran up the score among Republicans and whites to a much greater degree than Bloomberg who had a wider (if not deeper) coalition.
Those who have been reading my stuff know how skeptical I am of Bloomberg 2020, but looking back on 2005... It's really stunning to see what a GOPer (even if name only) mayor did in NYC. He won 40%+ of Democrats, African-Americans, under $20k and union households.
@NateSilver538 Truth. I'll leave now.
@smotus Lastly, Harris is African-American. They make up 20% of Dem base &amp; have tended to vote in blocs. Put it together, Harris has a better shot of winning the nom than any other individual. That said, it's an open field &amp; betting markets have her ahead but only at a 20% chance to win
@smotus Beyond @smotus interviews and polling, we can look at who the Democrats are nominating in high numbers... Specifically women in both 2016 and 2018. The Democratic base is also more liberal than it used to be. Harris has a v. liberal record per her Trump score &amp; DW-Nominate.
Among activists interviewed by @smotus, she ranks first overall in the early states for those saying they are considering supporting her. Activist support has historically had a high correlation with who wins nomination.
Why is Harris 1? Yes, she trails in horserace polls right now. They aren't useless, but are far from predictive at this point. Harris ranks 2 in Iowa for favorability w/ those who hold an opinion of her. She ranks 3 nationally for favorability w/ those who hold an opinion of her
There are some in my mentions who think Kamala Harris being ranked 1 in our power rankings is some sort of grand JFK grassy knoll conspiracy...  (Sadly, these are mostly Sanders' supporters.)

I think I may have been the first person to say Andrew Yang's name on a major news network.
BTW, I'm not saying Gabbard is "left". I'm saying Harris doesn't fit that definition of left where that Sanders/Gabbard fandom intersects... TBH, IDK if there is an agreed upon standard of what Gabbard is... except almost certainly not Dem nominee in 2020.
Kamala Harris not part of the "left" (where Sanders/Gabbard fans overlap), but she is "progressive". If by that, we mean someone with a liberal voting record (https://t.co/At83O1zGLN) &amp; who votes against Trump (https://t.co/B29z0gSNz0). Even if that is up for debate by some, tho.

Starting that dog pic thread was the smartest thing I've done since I figured out how to get a spicy chicken sandwich as part of the 4x4 at Wendy's.
Feels like there's a better chance that I claim KFC is better than Popeyes than this shutdown ever ending.
@islivingston I'll be lucky if I don't hit 45.
@SalenaZito I just do my comedies... Comedies and sports.
Well the good news is that it is now pinned. The bad news is I definitely used the wrong form of "whose". Should have been "who's". But you know what, who cares? What's important is cute dogs!
I'm not sure. If he has a high floor, then why is his approval rating been consistently at, tied, or near the lowest for any prez at this point through his first term? https://t.co/begSnJD93Z
@Fyodor32768 Trump's strongly disapprove right now is Bush II levels at end of his second term &amp; Nixon just before he resigned. (The Nixon is percentage who said he was doing a "poor" job. I had Marist conduct a poll asking it that way.)
It's one thing not to like a president now... It's another to say he's so bad that I think in the future he'll be seen as unsuccessful... Right now, a near majority (47%) say that. It suggests Trump will have a very hard time getting out of the cellar...
I don't get wow'd by poll numbers, but a Pew poll came out w/ what I think is stunning: More Americans think Trump's presidency will be unsuccessful than any presidency at any point in last 25 years (including Bush in 07 after Iraq/Katrina/06 midterms) https://t.co/gmmbdhBHcz https://t.co/yzQHya5A1K

Let's start a cute dog thread... Whose got a pup photo they wanna share?
@PaulKingsley7 I'm sorta confused at what you're doing. I've acknowledged the past stuff. Tried to learn from it... and I wasn't the only one who thought this. Sometimes fluky stuff happens, so there you go :).
@PaulKingsley7 I'll still answer... Trump's.
@SteveKornacki Yea, I don't get what the big deal is with this question tbh. I mean it's not good for him, but it really doesn't say much beyond approval.
@JRubinBlogger I'm hoping that we can get all the campaign dogs together for a photo!

TBH, I don't really care too much about the Trump re-elect numbers... It's just an offshoot of the approval/disapproval at this point. They're all not particularly strong for the prez.... but I think we knew that already.

@fallsstark He's a human being and do whatever the heck he wants. But I'm also allowed to ask questions if he's running for prez :).
By writing about it in Medium posts that he knows every journalist in the world will pick up? https://t.co/uDQFOF8JmF
I'm honestly wondering what is he doing? (Beyond just running for prez.) He's a public figure. He's posting Jack Kerouac like Medium posts... This is just something different than most people do. Unless, most people start doing road trips in the middle of January? https://t.co/DbuPhhUMfc
So what exactly is Beto doing?
As well he should be. https://t.co/2fRPPKP1bh
The thing about the shutdown was that it was pretty obvious a month ago. Poll after poll showed the wall wasn't popular and folks would blame Trump/GOP for the shutdown. Who the heck is advising the President? It's just terrible politics. https://t.co/KdA36REfdP https://t.co/IfCOzHzhJr
Interesting little nugget, Bernie Sanders actually won men in a majority of states with an an entrance or exit poll in 2016. He lost the vast majority of them overall, however, because of a greater than 20 point gender gap on average.
Facts 1. A record number of women are running for the Democratic nomination. 2. Women are winning elected office at record numbers. Combined, it looks like Democratic voters may want a woman to take on the man in the White House. https://t.co/fYlLkRDqNm
Starting to get interesting on weekend storm in the NYNEX (NY-New England).
@_PixelFreak_ @NateSilver538 It's a nice gauge that takes into account both approval &amp; disapproval. A pol at 41/27 is far more likely to be reelected than one at 41/55.
@KSoltisAnderson This is why I never really watched the West Wing.
@KSoltisAnderson I threw my papers in the air "no one wants me to give this speech". Got a round of applause. Easily won.
To this observer, Pelosi has made Trump's life more of a living heck over the last two weeks than any of his opponents made it during the 2016 campaign. https://t.co/sW0gFpo2KX
So Morning Consult has been doing 2020 Dem national primary polls... They had been including Clinton. Not this week. Result (with last poll in parentheses)... Biden 32 (27), Sanders 15 (16), Warren 9 (4), O'Rourke 8 (7), Harris 6 (3).
@NateSilver538 Correct answer.
@NateSilver538 We talking N64 or SNES Mario Kart? (Either way, good reference.)
@jhomenuk @islivingston Got that right. Now does someone have the 6z Euro, 9.5 day ice accumulation map? I especially want it if it is icier than the 0z. Otherwise, we can toss it as 6z is not as good as 0z.
BTW, I believe this is the first time ever that two women senators are running for a major party prez nomination at the same time. Seems notable.
@Zerosumgrl63 Correct! Was just discussing this tonight.
Can you name the Democratic prez contender who is a big enough football fan to narrate a top 100 NFL player clip from NFL Films? https://t.co/HiR16uMhVq
I have no internal knowledge, but looking at the data you can understand the political dynamics. Dems have public opinion on their side, but GOP base doesn't want Trump/Cong. GOP to fold. https://t.co/Fwl7bblShs
@NathanWurtzel John Lindsay did, indeed, win on the Liberal Party line after losing the GOP nomination in 1969. He was... the only liberal candidate in a liberal city. Mario P., who I believe coined the phrase "limo liberal", won the Dem nom.
Political careers are often made or broken by a few hundred people... Eliot Engel (chair of Foreign Affairs) won his first race for the state assembly by 103 votes... as a third party candidate. https://t.co/I5U9wTFeC1

@POLITICO_Steve Just such a great film.
And while support for the wall did seem to climb over the course of 2018 (to pretty much match Trump's own approval rating), the shutdown has coincided with support for the wall stabilizing. So just no wins here...
Trump's approval rating has clearly dropped. The amount of blame he is getting for the shutdown has clearly gone up. Declaring a national emergency is even more unpopular. GOPers don't want him to compromise. Dems have no reason to give an inch. It's a disaster.
"Trump has boxed himself in on the shutdown with nowhere to go" Looking at the polls, each potential move the president makes is even worst strategically than the last. Trump simply put has no good options for himself as his position worsens. https://t.co/tmA0j3TQaF

@nymetrowx This sucks.
There is a rather large all adults vs. registered voter gap for building the wall in the ABC News/Washington Post poll. https://t.co/Ne4SGuu4Vw
There is a higher correlation between supporting wall &amp; approving of Trump in the latest CNN poll than there was between voting for GOP House candidate &amp; approving of Trump in the 2018 exit poll.
The latest weekly numbers from the Ipsos/YouGov/Morning Consult internet polls showed pretty much the exact same thing as the new ABC/WaPo and CNN telephone numbers this morning. Trump+GOP blamed most by greater than 20 pts more for shutdown over the Democrats... https://t.co/WbYbFKM2d6

@islivingston I can say 1. I don't like it. 2. It definitely is catching on for some.
There are probably 5 to 10 universes (out of 100) in which Warren wins the nomination at this point. Probably like 1 or 2 for Castro... What the heck is the one where Gabbard wins? She seems to perturb DKos universe and mainstream Dems. Sanders at least won plenty of DKosers.
@KSoltisAnderson YES.
@kyletblaine Yes. Then you send me a photo of said snow angel.

@CanovaAnalytics Hart.
Here are the polls at this point in open Dem primaries vs. the results since 1972... My interpretation is if you're polling really well you've got a better shot of winning than if you're polling 0%. But a HECK of a lot to be determined this year. https://t.co/dAFzdjZQzC

I'm so confused... https://t.co/asXVt0v27T
Indeed, I couldn't figure out why Andrew Yang had a 5% fav &amp; 12% unfav in the poll. Then I realized he was introduced as "businessman". People were likely just going off that. Oh and just 17% said Howard Schultz would "add" to the campaign. Lowest of all tested on that question.
The potential 2020 who were businessmen (Steyer, Yang, and Bloomberg) had an average net fav of +1 in the last CNN/Selzer poll of Iowa. All other 2020 contenders had an average net fav of +26. I don't think Dems want a businessman as their nominee.
I have don't know how this is going to end. I don't see how they compromise on this. I think one side is gonna give in... or Trump will declare a national emergency. Of course, who knows? https://t.co/DIicnACvBo
Me: You gonna give me A&amp;W diet cream soda? Store worker: Sir, this is a Foot Locker. Me: Bye-Bye.
Trump's approval rating is in the low 40s, by a 20 pt margin Americans say the GOP is more to blame than the Dems for the shutdown, &amp; the GOP just lost a campaign in which Trump made immigration a key issue... Why would Pelosi budge on the wall?
So essentially, Trump asked Pelosi whether she would agree to a wall... but it would be 30 days later? How the heck was that supposed to get her to join his side?
I tend to think that people who this will crack first. https://t.co/70vrGYAaNx

@NathanWurtzel I KNOW THIS ONE.
@NateSilver538 I'd watch a Gilmore speech.
About the only new thing we learned tonight was that shared podiums are weird... Strikes me as unlikely that anything will change. Remember, opinions on the wall have been consistently negative for about the last 2+ years.
A reminder that Trump made the EXACT arguments in his speech tonight back before the 2018 elections... The result was Dems with their largest House win since Watergate. And yes, research shows it probably hurt the GOP. https://t.co/KdA36REfdP
There have been four special elections with at least one Dem &amp; GOPer since Election Day 2018 (MS-Senate, a special state leg race in TX, and two specials in Virginia state leg). There is no sign the blue wave is abating. Dem avg. over-performance vs. baseline? +13. https://t.co/y8r9h8MHWE

@SeanTrende IT'S A GREAT GAME
@aedwardslevy Can't both be asked? :)
IDK what it means but I'll grab onto anything right now... Warren gets to 22% and wins DKos first straw poll, O'Rourke, Harris, Biden, and Sanders follow. For reference, Sanders won every straw poll during the 16 cycle on DKos. https://t.co/IQ4HkCP89b https://t.co/MVUGGF2JWt
"Majority of Democrats Identify as Liberal for First Time" per Gallup... Talk about a trendline... https://t.co/REF4NO5YQR https://t.co/tSa0WTMICk

I'll say most "lane" thinking is wrong https://t.co/XLO1ps4sJn And I have to fight myself from falling into "lane" thinking.
What I don't get is how is Trump going to change minds on the wall? He's been making his case for 3.5 years now... and consistently voters have been against it.
@micahcohen Two plots for ya here... This is the Iowa CNN/Selzer/DMR poll... One is net fav and one is name rec by vote share... Net fav is obviously related to name rec (higher name rec better chance for higher net fav). https://t.co/yqWOZ37P7J
I don't think it's case Biden's lead in the polls right now is cause of name rec. If that were case, Sanders would be tied or leading. I think a better case is to be made no one has laid a hand on Biden in 3 years, &amp; once they do, he'll become less popular &amp; see poll lead go bye.

So what's the advantage of getting out on the campaign trail this early? 1. Puts pressure on others potentially in Warren's lane (if you believe that's a thing) to get in or out. 2. Good crowds will generate good press. Helps quell "likability" (w/e that means) ?'s for now.
That was a scary few months without a visible campaign.

@RalstonReports The Sabres are doing quite well... And HNY (I'm abbreviating now) to you :).
@RalstonReports Hey.
How does Trump win re-election? One of the following alone or in combination is likely necessary... 1. Job growth keeps up. 2. Trump focuses more on the economy. 3. Dems nominate an un-liked candidate*. *I'm not sure how you determine that outside of favorable ratings.
Traditionally speaking, job growth like the prelim report we saw today spread out over the next 2 years would certainly point to re-election... Problem is 1. Tough to keep up. 2. Strong economy so far hasn't kept Trump from falling into the low 40s on approval.
Some men are really stupid. https://t.co/MJktH3JMlU
Let me add 1 other thought, which I was gonna make before getting pulled in by Pawn Stars YouTube clips. As I've noted, ideology isn't be all, end all. Stuff like demographics/plain old likability matter. That said, certain stuff like abortion position is non-negotiable I'd think
@allahpundit @aedwardslevy Basically, the YouTube on that one in the minds of them.
@allahpundit @aedwardslevy https://t.co/ldzREMoSwS
The 3rd mind is Gallup polling (along with YouGov stuff from @aedwardslevy) shows Dem voters don't believe the party should move left. That's very different from the GOP which wants a more conservative direction.
The 2nd mind is Democrats have seemed to moved to the left (whether it be Gallup yearly polling or the fact that liberals made up a larger chunk of this year's midterm electorate than ever before), so it'd naturally follow a more left nominee could emerge.
So this'll be worth an article, but I think I'm of 2 or 3 minds on whether Dems will nominate someone further to the left than they have in the past... The 1st mind is Overton window has shifted because of folks like B. Sanders. Things that would seemed far left before aren't now
This was from YouGov from Dec 23 - 25... Immediate Syria withdrawal was 39% yes, 37% no. Not a lot of strong feelings... but a majority of GOPers were pro, while a majority of Dems were against. Gotta think some or most of this partisan divide was driven by Trump. https://t.co/5NQxZyG0f7
I knew one guy who bought the NYDN everyday... He passed a little over 3 years ago... I imagine stories like this one are part of the problem.
@FiveThirtyEight Go Bills!
All that said, there is a YEAR + to go in the primary season. Candidates can get better or worse. There will be many, many debates. Moreover, Trump if is at a 40%-45% approval rating is likely to be in a TON of danger no matter who the Dem nominee is.
We're trying to get at something similar that we did during the special elections of 17-18. We saw Dems consistently doing better than the baseline in many districts even though they were losing in them. But guess what? When there was a neutral baseline, Dems crushed it in 2018.
Measures like these are useful for a starting point because they use real data from voters who have heard from candidates the most. I also laugh at those who say "she still won by 24!" because we're trying to get at how much more electable is a candidate than average.
This https://t.co/oC6SMpE9K9 (along with other stuff on Warren such as that weak UMass Mass primary poll) has received a lot of umph recently. Wanna discuss that a little more here...
@MortChristenson HA! Nice.
@BradWascher Interesting stuff. I'd look at her numbers among Dems. In fact do it for all. The key here is to try and set a neutral baseline. We'd expect Warren to better liked than Doug Jones in their home states. ? Is how much better liked than avg. Dem.
Can't wait for someone to drop a video of me dancing at my Bar Mitzvah.

@aedwardslevy Gallup asked this slightly differently but found something similar (and somewhat to my surprise): they didn't want the party to become more liberal.
I remember when Hakeem Jeffries was rumored to potentially primary de Blasio in 2017. He seems to have made the correct decision on passing.
@aedwardslevy This is all too confusing. We need a committee to examine this.
I could see Dem primary voters rallying around Warren re: Trump attacks. I could also see them think it's not worth the hassle... Either way, Warren is gonna get a lot of press.
Mitt can bash (even if he doesn't vote against) Trump w/o much fear. 2018 saw record correlation btwn prez approval/vote for Cong. In UT tho, Trump's approval w/ Mitt voters = only 65%. Only 30% of his voters used their vote to express support for Trump. https://t.co/kmLOz63Uc5

@NathanWurtzel I think there was a good reason for him to have a stage name..
@NoahCRothman Sure, though I guess what I'm saying is that Trump's numbers will probably have to decline to get a legit challenger.
Remember Buchanan didn't join until like December 1991. By that point, Bush's rating among Republicans was down to 73%-75%. https://t.co/bIPt5h9bbn
@SalenaZito Answer to this is yes I believe. More came around after nomination, &amp; now he is the incumbent. So I expect the number to be quite high. I do wonder about a few like Romney, however. (As to the effect of Romney withholding, I would think minimal. Most endorsements don't matter)
None of these from https://t.co/S56LREjzXF seem all that nuts to me... I do wonder where Sherrod Brown is, however... https://t.co/HN80bflodp
Will Romney endorse Trump's 2020 campaign? (This assumes Trump makes it to the general election.)
@NathanWurtzel They pay me off with Wendy's... which is where I am right now.
And fwiw, I just rank Harris as having a better shot of winning the nomination than Warren. Warren was ranked #1 in October prior to a bad few months. I make no judgements as to how good they'd be as president.

@dotalxchn @OldTakesExposed Don't really see how this is controversial... Not saying his approval will be there... or Dems won't nominate electoral poison... But if we meet certain conditions, Trump is probably screwed.
This is the number 1 lesson from the midterms. Trump's approval rating among voters equaled the GOP's vote share. He/They didn't defy political gravity. Unless Dems nominate electoral poison, Trump'll lose in 2020 with a 40-45% approval rating among voters. https://t.co/KdSXLZlBXh

New piece: Trump's wall shutdown clearly aimed at the base, but base isn't enough for Trump in 2020. Trump's immigration rhetoric clearly hurt the GOP in the midterms. Dems won House vote in states + DC totaling 329 electoral votes. https://t.co/KdA36REfdP https://t.co/20laBw7Kbg

RT @amyewalter: Trump 2020 re-elect strategy: 1) hope economy stays good; 2) keep base engaged/enraged w/ immigration/norm breaking/owning…
@KSoltisAnderson Yay!!!!!!
Final thought here: Trump's economic approval rating is among the highest of any approvals he has. It's a net positive. He singed the bump-stock ban &amp; criminal justice reform. Why is he taking attention away from this stuff? Instead, we're going for a shutdown voters don't want.
@Michael2014abc @EdAsante77 Heading out to a movie, but we're not disagreeing here, Michael. But Trump is far less liked than the avg prez candidate. If Dems don't nominate someone who is poison, they'll win (assuming same Trump approval). Of course, that is no guarantee. Have a good one, fellas :).
@EdAsante77 I think he def won the primary cause of wall/immigration... but I really think if u remove the Clinton piece, he falls apart in the general. That may end up being an incorrect hypothesis... but it hasn't failed yet.
Sure the immigration rhetoric may have helped the GOP win a Senate seat... but population matters in House/presidential elections. It doesn't in Senate elections.
We literally just had a general election without Clinton on the ballot &amp; with Trump/GOP running on tough immigration rhetoric. End result: GOP lost 40 seats in the House.
This right here is the problem. A misunderstanding of what won him the primary and what won him the general. He won the primary on immigration. I wrote about it here (https://t.co/v7QkAaIwhV). He won the general because Hillary Clinton was hated (https://t.co/ZMI8oNiLjj). https://t.co/47maaX6so0

@PollsAndVotes Yea... well in that case we're in agreement.
@PollsAndVotes It depends tbh. If the chart (and I haven't read the story tbh) is meant to show Trump counties got rewarded that's one thing... But the way I would normally think about it, I would go the other way.
@jpodhoretz @KFILE Eh, The Mole beat them both.
You could argue stuff like bumpstocks is a move towards the center... but Trump isn't out there triumphing it. He's talking about a wall. Often in politics, rhetoric is as important as policy.
I'll have more on this on tomorrow... Shutdowns come and go... but my guess is that unless the Dems put up Clinton Part II, Trump will need to move the center. He hasn't. Perhaps there was a thought the midterm would push him to. A shutdown over the wall shows he won't move.
Can someone explain this to me... The GOP needs 60 votes. There's no way they get anywhere near that. They don't have the votes for getting rid of the filibuster. What is the end game here?
Just to be clear, I'm not holding open the vote... Popeyes and Diet A&amp;W Cream have both won.
@K_D_Campbell I really don't take any. I have a Bloomberg piece in my back-pocket.
Decided to take a "gamble" and wrote my poll of the week about the shutdown. I say gamble because the piece won't run until tomorrow and if there is no shutdown the piece is worthless.

And what Democrats are going to vote for ending the filibuster? On what planet does this come close to working? This makes no sense. I'm just stunned at how little sense it makes from a strategy standpoint.
Also, where the heck are the Senate votes on this? Collins? Murkowski? Flake? Corker? And then by the time the latter two go, there's a new House... How does this work?
Troop withdrawal from Syria may end up being popular, but there have been more polls on the wall than Popeyes in my veins. It's so clearly a political loser w/ general electorate. To go nuclear on it seems quite stupid politically &amp; GOP data agrees on this https://t.co/IDbHgIM2JG
Should say *available* live interview polling for the audience to read up on.
4. Much of what Gallup had done historically has been replaced by Pew Research... 5. The trend away from live interview polling continues...
3. I find the reasoning of abandoning subgroup dives to be rather silly. We only know of deep polarization because folks Gallup have polled it. If something happened (good or bad) that all of sudden Trump's approval rating went way up or down, they'd miss it.
So I got a few thoughts on this https://t.co/VbzgieF6p6 1. Gallup can do whatever it wants to do, obviously. 2. Sorry to see it. I still actually read Gallup's front page semi-regularly.

@rtyson82 Friend, Romney (in a field similar of size to 08) was matching or exceeding his 08 poll numbers at this point in 2012. Sanders at 60% in that poll would be interesting. 36% isn't. I'm just interested in getting right. I'll be wrong sometimes, but the right is the goal.
@jbouie It's the topline of the polls. FWIW, it became a banner headline when I suggested Dems would probably not be nominating a while male. So, yea.
@cceichhorn1 I mean the point is the point and I'll defend the point.
Bernie Sanders leads a DFA straw poll with 36%... He won it with 88% in December 2015.  I'm supposed to interpret this as good news for Sanders? He lost 50 points off his vote share... (Terrible datapoint for Warren too.) https://t.co/cZSyXC7dR7 https://t.co/PRSYQGqJmA

Some people were convinced that Sanders was going to win the nomination even when it was passed the NY primary and there was no path.... This year? Who really knows... but while having a prior is good, it should be based in math &amp; cannot be relied to heavily upon.

Dear Comrade, 26% of Democrats had never heard of Barack Obama at this point in the 2008 cycle (see attached). 36% (3/8's) couldn't form an opinion of him. The cases of Obama 2008 and Sanders 2020 are not directly comparable. My best, Harry https://t.co/MvDv148VV5 https://t.co/9rYeNQhjme

@SandraTXAS @parscale While I wish I had seen the Trump train better in the primaries (where the polls were very good), I was one of the few who actually thought the polls could be wrong in 2016. https://t.co/DLDOW6pBmj
If however the national vote is +2 D as it was in 2016, then sure you could win the electoral college...
What I am saying though is that states move relative to the national vote. If the national vote is +9 D (as it was in the midterms), then you're going to lose the electoral college. States will move with national margin as it did in the midterms.
That's not the theory at all, Brad. You're conflating two things. On the first we agree: no one should use a national vote outcome in a midterm to project a prez election. We agree. https://t.co/1dwjnsVeX8

Final note here: Trump's favorite pollster was the least accurate in 2018. The average poll nationally was quite accurate. The polls aren't rigged. Those who argue that should look themselves in the mirror &amp; realize they're deluding themselves. https://t.co/pRZIrkZFBK
The irony of this all is that I just said that Trump would be a favorite for re-election if past relationship with economy holds &amp; current economic growth continues.
Clinton won the popular vote margin by 2... Trump won the tipping point state by less than a point.... if the Dem candidate wins the popular vote by 4 this time, there's a very, very, very good chance they'll win the electoral college.
Brad, with all do respect, you're not winning the electoral college if Trump loses the popular vote by a high margin. In the House vote this past time around (which was HIGHLY correlated with Trump support), you lost states containing a majority of electoral votes. https://t.co/tuctOqsdUX
One other note... among those who approved of Obama... Sanders voters' 90% for Clinton, 3% for Trump, 2% Johnson, 3% Stein. Among those who disapproved of Obama.. 55% Trump, 23% Clinton, 3% Johnson, 12% Stein...
@NathanWurtzel See link posted on that :).
Here's a link to some of these studies...  https://t.co/WiQOKIZ9di
@NathanWurtzel Like?
There's this vitriol that appears on Twitter (and certainly in my mentions) between Clinton/Sanders folks... But fact is that Sanders has a very high positive rating today (even if bad in horserace polls) among Dems. And most Sanders folks got behind Clinton.
Something that I think sometimes gets lost... 78% of Sanders primary voters backed Clinton in the general in 2016 per the CCES. 78% of non-Trump GOP primary voters backed Trump in the general per the CCES.
@TwiTati Most Americans believe that it is, which is all I care about for this sake of this exercise :).
@codyjamesbaker Yep.
Now of course, this doesn't mean Trump will win another term. (I actually think it's more likely than not that he won't.) But I think it's quite possible for the economy to save him in 2 years even if it hasn't yet.
You can cut apple in different ways. I just used a common metric. What I was interested in: a. the economy in final years of a term are linked to economy far more than early years to midterms/approval. b. It's more than plausible Trump can win another term https://t.co/odRCwr2HyK
@richardmskinner Yep. I think we're in agreement here. It'll be interesting to see how it develops. I honestly don't know.
Another way you could read this, tho, is that job growth hasn't been *that* strong historically speaking. Even if Trump didn't have Tweets, scandals, etc., he'd only be a slight favorite if job growth kept up. So one could see how current job growth wouldn't be enough to win
Trump's approval/re-elect #s are low, but history suggests it's economic growth over final two years that will determine his fate. Obviously a margin of error w/ this stuff, but sustained current job growth would suggest he's slightly favored. A big if tho https://t.co/X5nklXt0I1 https://t.co/VluFROa4SI

CNN's poll today continues to point out the Sanders issue... He's well liked by those who lean Dem (76% favorable rating), but even with near universal name ID he polls at just 14% and a distant second to Biden. https://t.co/kzPTYO9dS9
@moshik_temkin If you think I don't write about policy, you're right! I don't tend to. What I do write about is elections however from a horserace point of view. If policy interacts with that, great.
All I know is that @databyler is heck a good writer, and the small election writing community is gonna work like heck to make sure he is picked up somewhere. He's a voice that should be heard in 2020.
BTW, the ridiculous thing of all of this... Most Democrats not backing Sanders like Sanders. Most Sanders backers like other Democrats.

If Bernie starts to move up in the polls, gains some African-American support and gets endorsements, of course I'll think his chances go up. Until then, he's a guy who won 40%+ in 2016 &amp; is at less than 15% now.
What is old is new again. I say Bernie Sanders probably won't win the nomination. (He could, but it really isn't likely.) I then get called some version of an establishment shill. Do people realize how crazy they sound?

@RRHElections @NateSilver538 Hey Booker is getting 3-5%! (It's still not high, haha.)
Let's be real. People (not all) tend to follow people who give them the news they want. So in 16, I was down on Bernie. Hence today's situation with a lot of anti-Bernie followers. If I gave Bernie more positive news, I'm sure the split would be more even. https://t.co/owlYnWtlMM

I want Beto who is 2 to win? Have you followed at me at all... Like ever? The reason for Booker fairly high is simple: it's a bet on New Hampshire and the hard work he's done there. https://t.co/x03jKxCtGa
BTW, Sanders at 6 isn't dismissing him winning. We just don't think it's particularly likely... Perhaps a shade less likely than the general conventional wisdom if you believe the betting markets.
@jacktomalis @TuckerCarlson All I said, which is true, is that the Dem base is probably looking to nominate a woman or a minority... which I think is true... but Biden being 3 suggests they may not...

Final note: Obviously this can all change... I for one would have never thought Beto's stock would rise so quickly. But it is... What it is...
And yes there are more candidates this time, but the fact that Sanders is falling well short of 2016 numbers (and almost always not in first place) in most scientific polls is also telling. Again, he could win, but can we acknowledge a lot of his support was merely anti-Clinton?
Sanders literally finished in third place with 13% in a https://t.co/G1q8a215qq straw poll... He won 78% of the https://t.co/G1q8a215qq vote in 2016.  Sanders could win, but the idea he is anything near a front-runner is a bigger fantasy than Mexico paying for the wall. https://t.co/KQ1XK207iy

I honestly don't know how NC-09 isn't resolved without a new election.
Everybody is always looking for that CSI "aha" DNA piece of evidence. But strong cases, in my mind, are built upon a house of evidence (think My Cousin Vinny). Here the house of evidence is solid. It's 3 dimensional. It's made with brick/concrete.
So I've written on NC-09. To me the case for fraud appears quite strong. I think the key point for fraud is that there isn't one. The case relies upon a slew of evidence, so that even if one point falls apart the case is still strong. https://t.co/RCxNsjFEhC

Two, it seems that many of the people taken advantage of were older African-Americans. It wasn't very long ago that African-Americans had difficulty voting in the South. The idea of essentially screwing with their votes is morally repugnant.
I have a few other thoughts... One, it's important to emphasize that this is ELECTION, not voter, fraud. From everything we can tell, the voters did nothing wrong. Voter fraud remains incredibly rare.
I mentioned the media not covering NC-9 enough... Well, I spoke about it a little earlier. What's key here is that we a lot of evidence from vote counts that look suspicious, to affidavits, to a guy (Dowless) with a history of this type of stuff, etc. https://t.co/3d6vXMexcU

One thing that I know my friends @fivethirtyeight were doing and I did on Election Night was to have lean, likely etc... the pre-election language exported to election night.
@NathanWurtzel There's something about that checkmark.
This would have the additional benefit of not having to "undeclare" (not a word apparently) or "unproject" "winners"...
One question I've been asking myself recently is whether or not the media should project or call winners in races. That is, "xxx has won." I'd much rather have "xx has most likely won" or "it's extremely likely xx has won."
And keep in mind, I'm someone who has been high on Warren. Obviously, it's still very early... but home state appeal is something i take seriously because these are the voters who know the candidates best.
I'm seeing some early warning signs for Elizabeth Warren 2020. She came in 3rd place in a Dem primary among MASSACHUSETTS voters this week. Also, relative to what you'd expect she put in the 6th worst performance of any Dem Sen candidate in 2018.  https://t.co/yxOhTWS4EH

@DanielScott1011 Exit poll stuff is different on approval for some odd reason that I haven't quite figured out... Like Carter's was waaaay lower in 78 than the final Gallup poll. IDK.
There's nothing fancy there. The margins of error are wide. But it gives you an indication that this hit right in middle of the bellcurve. So despite the ideas that Trump upends everything we know, he actually upended nothing at least with concern to prediction of the midterms
Give you an idea, I wrote this article back in Feb 2017. I said if Trump's approval was 40% in final Gallup poll it would point to a 40 seat loss for the GOP and a 10 pt margin for Dems in popular vote. 40 seats it will be. Popular vote margin will be 9. https://t.co/v7AVYHY50R
The thing about the midterms is just how normal everything was from a poli sci predictive point of view. This is especially the case for the House elections.

One other note: Valadao beat Cox by 25 points (62.8 to 37.2) in the top-two primary in June. Historically, the top two primary is predictive. Not in this case.
With TJ Cox expanding his lead in CA in the county where Valadao needed to make up votes, some stats: 1. There were 25 Clinton/GOP rep seats last Congress. This Congress there will be 3. 2. There were 7 of these in CA. Next Congress? 0.

I remember with Alabama there was wall-to-wall coverage on cable... Right now, that's not the case... And based on the early returns, no reason to blame em... We'll see when more votes are counted.
Of course that was indicated by every poll...
One thing that seems pretty clear (unless things dramatically alter which is plausible)... Espy will do better than the cumulative Dem vote in round 1 (42%)...
I mean you've heard it from others... If the precincts that have reported are representative of the county they're in, these are good results for Espy. The problem is that there's a good shot they aren't. Hence, we're all in the dark.
Without precinct information, partial counties are mostly useless in MS.

@arnonmishkin Truth.
@arnonmishkin I'd have to break it down demographically, but there could be a slew of reasons (such as pollsters being most reflective in those states after 2016). Or it could be luck. Of course, 2 out of 2 isn't exactly a big trend either.

@baseballcrank It was... really bad.
Interestingly, in Minnesota, Dems were very much underestimated in all three major statewide races...
The errors were clearly much worse in IN, MO, and OH... but I take it as a somewhat positive sign that in the states most likely to be pivotal... The errors didn't repeat themselves.
In averaging the Gov/Senate results, the average poll overestimated the Dems by a point in MI and PA... and didn't overestimate the Dems at all in WI... That's to put it mildly very different from 2016...
I think there are a number of ways to think about polling errors in the Midwest (for this discussion I'm including PA in that, I know, I know) in 2018... Here's 1 way: the states that'll most likely be pivotal are MI, PA, and WI.

@Tzipshmil I mean voters see it as his, which is all that matters for the sake of this discussion.
@ericbradner Can we cover his first event together? I'll bring the A&amp;W.
Put this another way... Going back to this point in a president's term since 78 in CBS News polling, Trump has the 2nd highest economic approval rating. He also has the 2nd lowest overall approval rating. Trump's doing something very wrong in the minds of voters.
One thing that has become crystal clear to me is that Trump's unconventional ways are hurting, not helping, him. His approval rating would be in the 50s if he were more "presidential". Instead, he's jeopardizing his reelect campaign in a serious way. https://t.co/zNiGNGEHSv

Yea, he was also facing Hillary Clinton. If the Dems put up another candidate as disliked, then yea maybe this holds. Until that is the case, it doesn't. We just had a test of this earlier this month. https://t.co/wlKiG087BI

I've written on Pelosi. Simple summary: the challenge to her makes little sense to me. She's unpopular, so what? Few voters cast a ballot based upon who the speaker will be. Also, she's very liberal and a woman in a party that is becoming more liberal &amp; wants more women elected.
I should be clear that polls are for than just elections. Solid questions can tell us a lot about the electorate and adults at large, which elections won't really.
Seriously, a simple Real Clear Politics average will really get you far. Where a next level analysis will help you most is understanding the correlation between polling errors &amp; therefore the chance one side will win a congressional body/prez election.
@swollsk The average poll was off by 2.8 points. The AVERAGE was off by considerably less. See the "bias" for the average poll for that. Under a point.
Put another way, the best way to understand what way elections are going &amp; how popular politicians are is to use polling. Using it allows us to speak to many Americans at a time. It's not perfect, but as a tool, it will lead you to the right answer far more than the wrong one.
Now were the polls perfect? Nope. There may still be an issue going on in the Midwest (IN, MI, OH), though the problem wasn't as bad as two years ago (see PA/WI). But overall, the biases cancelled each other out in a way not seen in 2016. https://t.co/Use7KOoSyi
Polls were better than average in governor, House, and Senate races... There was little bias on average in the polling. And the Siena/Upshot polls were VERY strong. https://t.co/Use7KOoSyi
Before the 2018 election, I said pollsters could use a good year after 2016. On average, 2018 was one of the best year's for pollster since 1998 and far better than average. https://t.co/Use7KOoSyi
FWIW, Scott Rasmussen's polls with HarrisX were not really biased in one direction or the other. Rasmussen Reports, otoh, were just awful. https://t.co/acyK1Y3Ves
Sure, Jan. https://t.co/gtvdcua01T
It's not my area of expertise, so a question to those out there... Is there a reason to think Pelosi is in any sort of real danger? I mean there's always a chance, but seems to me this is a lot of kabuki... What am I missing?
The final CNN poll had Gillum up 1. There was an earlier poll that had him up double digits, but that was an outlier and why we average. (https://t.co/5vwQeoanqM) https://t.co/0KgigTZ6In
I'm a big believer in what I call the true margin of error. Take all the errors that polls have had historically at a given point (or even at the end) and tacking that onto the poll. That's how I report it. How pollsters show it is up to them obviously :). https://t.co/4tYlACOQGt
@jacobfhsmith @UpshotNYT @FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 @Nate_Cohn I mean there's always work to be done, but on average the polls were a lot better than they were in 2016. And the biases (and there were obviously some in some states) mostly cancelled each other out overall. That was definitely not the case in 2016.
@jacobfhsmith @UpshotNYT @FiveThirtyEight So there are a lot of ways to get at this... 1. There were about as many close polls this year than 2016 (but more than average which is what I was getting at). 2. In those close races though, the average poll was 0.3 points better. (3.3 pts error)
@GuyDebored @jacobfhsmith @same0lg3 @UpshotNYT Average miss in OH and WV was 5.3 and 2.2 points respectively...
@jacobfhsmith @same0lg3 @UpshotNYT The average poll was off by 3.4 points in Nevada, 7.6 in Indiana, 4.9 in Missouri, 3 points in Florida... The average Senate poll in the final 3 weeks historically has been off 5.1 points...
@jacobfhsmith @UpshotNYT In the Senate, the average poll was a point better than average. What you're probably getting at is that more polls picked the wrong winner than average... but that was in part because of a lot of close races.
More on this later in the week, but this year the polling was about a point better than average and had really low bias (i.e. on average neither side did better than the polling suggested).

BTW, I'd call FL a swing state that leans red. But you're going to have a hard time convincing me that a state Clinton lost by 1 and Obama won twice isn't a "swing state". At least for now.
@svdate Yea, but that a midterm in other direction... And Graham's popularity was to put it mildly far greater than Scott's. I mean Scott gained some approval post-hurricane... but often was below 50%. Graham had won his last reelection by like 30 I believe.
@NathanWurtzel I don't remember it, but the parallel race I think of is Jim Hunt vs. Jesse Helms in 84. Not a midterm, but Hunt was wildly popular... Yet, Helms was able to hold on... Almost certainly aided by Reagan's popularity in the state.
I mean the only other one on the books is Edwards beating Faircloth in 1998... and that was aided by a president whose approval rating was sky high... That's not the case here...
From a statistical/electoral/historical perspective, Scott's defeat of Nelson is pretty much unmatched in recent political history. Beating a swing state opposition party senator without a hint of scandal in a midterm... It's quite impressive.

Me: "Hi Mom." Mom: "I know why you're calling... Let me stick the ruler in the snow." She knows me too well.
@mattmfm I believe this is called NAMed!
@evansiegfried @UrbaNMasquE My favorite story from college was waking up and thinking the left side of my bed (against the window) felt cold... I then checked the outside temp... it was -32. That's without windchill.

I'd recognize that the electorates would look totally different... In fact, there have been lawsuits because of it. (Those lawsuits have mostly failed just Poliquin's failed.) https://t.co/KvBbXTXDAf
Golden btw did not receive a majority of votes. He received a majority of votes among those who indicated whether they preferred Golden or Bruce Poliquin. Some third party voters decided not to choose.
Mother Nature and Old Man Winter nailed it perfectly... Just as the election season is winding down, the snow is coming. Now if only the Bills didn't stink.

Just to the south in Philly, it's 30 degrees and heavy snow. Keep in mind, it's November 15th.

@SeanTrende It depends on the suburbs... which I guess is the pt of this?
Mostly right https://t.co/v7AVYHY50R
@islivingston apparently no.
By the time of the first primary/caucus, Clinton's net favorable rating was in the negative double digits. https://t.co/7tWGfk7rOC
There's nothing really insightful here but Dems will probably win if they nominate someone who has a positive net favorable rating on election day. It's really that simple. IDK who that person is, though.
The complete Trump media coverage was clearly advantageous to him in the primary. He crowded everyone out... but in the general election, it's pretty clear Clinton did her best when the media attention was on Trump. That's continued into his presidency.
This is an interesting thread and worthy of consideration from a Dem strategist... But it really may be as easy as nominating someone who doesn't have a net favorable rating that is south of -10 points. https://t.co/JoyawbAUNY
@ScottyP16 The piece talks about individual seats :).
Lots of talk about how Dems in the Senate hit a red wall of sorts given a 2 net seat loss... but keep in mind they won 69% of seats. 5th best of 27 for them in any midterm since 1914. They won a slightly higher % of seats this year than GOP in 2010 or 2014 https://t.co/KINPMjkpJI https://t.co/4fZ57OpByg
@PatrickRuffini @nickgourevitch I recall 1994 being one where the GOP did much better than expected. (There was a real question whether they would get the majority.) Granted, I wasn't of age then.

I am a lhasa apso, and I'm NOT running for president.
The thing that is so bizarre about the president's tweet is, as I have pointed out, the GOP is gonna win these recounts (unless something truly weird happens). Like it's not that close. This talk about fraud etc. just makes the GOP look silly and like they have something to hide.
Felt like I was dealing with deja vu as I was asked "what happens if Palm Beach doesn't finish the recount on time." Just call Cousin Myron and bring him down to help out or something.
For those that don't know, this is a HEAVY Clinton Latino district. Most thought Valadao was in pretty good shape. He's led in the vote count throughout. He crushed in the top-two primary back in June... But lo and behold, maybe not so safe?

TBH it was pretty darn clear by Tuesday at like 830ish or so that the Dems weren't just taking back the House, but they were probably netting 30+... The problem, as I said yesterday, is that people don't necessarily believe what they can't see.
Would Gwen Graham have won the Florida governor's race had she won the Democratic nomination?

It's the Trump number that should worry Democrats. He's much less unpopular than you might have thought given 2016. https://t.co/kzBnZyQcee
Collusion of course isn't interference. The evidence on interference is pretty clear. Russia did try to do it. However, how much of an impact that actually had on vote choice? Whole other question.
@davidshor @xenocryptsite My childhood home is this.
LOL. Bills two plays and a touchdown. What in the world.
This Barkley fellow just threw a better pass than Peterman has ever thrown.
My thoughts on elections are pretty simple: let people vote. Count the votes. Whoever gets the most votes wins. That person wins office. We do that every two years for the House. Every six for a Senate seat. Every four for the presidency.
BTW, I also think the idea of Russian collusion costing Clinton the presidency is not supported by the evidence. Granted, there still are investigations on-going bout Russia (see Mueller, Bob). Pretty much every voter fraud investigation has found it to be very, very, very rare.
It's the Bills vs. the Jets with absolutely nothing on the line. Please stay tuned.

I ate a lot of it back in 2016 after the GOP primary. I should have. I was wildly overconfident and a jerk about it. But if ur actually a professional, you admit your mistakes and learn from em. You don't bury your head in the sand.
My problem w/ Rasmussen is pretty simple. Trump uses their polling to paint an alternate (not real) universe where he is not unpopular. When their polling is wrong, no mea culpas. (I have written plenty of em.) Instead, this whatever piece of nothing. https://t.co/D2HwE8G3X3
@Neoavatara I think we'll take a look at something going into 2020 for sure...
I'm pretty much always going to bet on the polling leader. Sometimes that bet won't come up. Most times it will. https://t.co/UuuMIdmElj
Interesting side note: Scott Rasmussen who isn't with the company anymore seemed to do fine with his Harrisx polls. I haven't looked at too in-depth at this point though.
Or put another way, the polls moved to match Trump's approval rating... That's not exactly a shocking thing. And more than that, you'd expect a few states to have large errors. Average error seemed in line with past midterms.
I feel like we'll be discussing this for a little. The state polls in Florida were absolutely fine. They were off by 2 points in the Senate race. 3 in the gov. It does seem in red states the polls underestimated the GOP. https://t.co/fmyYvFi7Va
This is pathetic. https://t.co/D2HwE8ot5v
Polls were right. https://t.co/5LTKDhW6hD
@KlasicalLiberal I actually have wondered that, and I personally think the president was well deployed.
@KlasicalLiberal One way: you expect some states to have large errors... Two: Trump's approval rating in a state is what he'll get on election day. So those states moved towards Trump's approval. Will need to monitor that very closely.
@KlasicalLiberal MO/IN should be separated from the rest. The others were if you look at the polling averages very small errors. MI, WI, PA, etc. didn't have errors like that at all. And how do I explain it? Well, could be a few ways...
The president's approval rating could of course improve. But with by most nonpartisan measures is a successful if not booming economy, his approval rating hasn't got to 50% or above all presidency. And for all but the very beginning it has been below is disapproval rating.
Tuesday answered 2 impt questions: 1. Do traditional measures of unpopularity mean anything when it comes to Trump? Answer: A resounding yes. 2. Is there a hidden Trump vote nationally? Answer: A resounding no. This very bad news for Trump going into 2020 https://t.co/IbKFwJUlAt https://t.co/lrp5YhrnrC
Was talking with @natesilver538 yesterday... One thing that is completely true... You're still so wired after the election that a. you cannot fall asleep early and b. you awake early still...
@StephenBeban I don't think most people have a darn clue what a probability means. And if you merely say the midpoint is most likely but there is a range of results, u got the most digestible form.
@PollsAndVotes I think it's impt to acknowledge a job well done. We too often pt out the times when result didn't perfectly match the preelection poll. We need to pt out more often when polling hits it on the head. (With full knowledge it won't always happen, and a poll can still be "good")
Final Marquette poll in Wisconsin? Tie in governor's race. It ended up being Dem +1. Senate race? Poll said +11 Dem. It ended up being +11 Dem. Mr. Charles Franklin did very well.
@RGoimarac OOOO. Yes, I see that.
Had a convo tonight with someone who voted for Nelson/Gillum and AGAINST Amendment 4.
IDK why but "thank you" strikes me as far more polite as "thanks". I mean just be a little nutter butter.
I mean go after her for her political positions and associations. That seems like fair game on both sides... but to take some pleasure from someone's potential financial hardship? What are we even doing anymore?
Serious question: why is it okay to make fun of Ocasio Cortez and her financial situation?
Currently in California: a GOP bloodbath.
I actually have become more convinced by than ever that spelling out the 95 percent confidence interval for the margin in each forecast is the way to go. I don't think people realize how off a normal poll can be.
I think it's important to talk about this. My final forecast was +2 Donnelly. That came with an MOE of +/- 11. Reason? That's how good polls have been. Most states didn't have this error, but we should have expected a few to have it. https://t.co/K9tcv5B6aL

@Brian_Boughton @dothefandango @FiveThirtyEight Hi folks :)
Tomorrow will tell us a lot more of where Arizona stands given the ballots to be counted, but I saw nothing today to knock me off the idea that Sinema is favored.
I tend to believe that election officials are doing their best work. Then again, I also don't believe in conspiracy theories.
@KSoltisAnderson @SIRIUSXM Congrats, but I'm more of a 70s on 7 type of guy.
I'm only half kidding here. A logical conclusion from Tuesday is to let Trump beat himself, if ur a Dem.
@POLITICO_Steve basically matching the house vote. Makes a lot of sense.
Tony Evers 2020. (What? Don't look at me like that.)
I mean wasn't that the big question heading into Tuesday? People thought Trump's polling didn't reflect his true support in the electorate. We just had a HUGE test of that. That test proved to me that, for now, it did.
This would worry me if I was a GOPer. The president's approval rating among RV/LV. It has never gotten to 50%. It's been below the disapproval rating @ every pt except for 5 second honeymoon. The prez's party got his approval rating on Tuesday. Oh and this is with a good economy. https://t.co/8Of68HURrN

Here's the outcome under different scenarios. Basically, each side can claim something. https://t.co/RgybdXF8pB https://t.co/eYHdnu0btr
Put another way, Latinos in the exit poll were far more likely to say they were born in Texas than whites... Hence, O'Rourke's support among those born in TX was higher.
Re that Texas question on being born or not born in Texas... I *think* that's just an artifact of race. Among whites there really isn't any difference in support for O'Rourke/Cruz based on being or not born in Texas. Latino sample size isn't large enough to look there.

What y'all don't see is the testing on the election night stuff I did months ago... and then taking flights at ungodly hours to do election prep in DC... Just for 30 seconds of airtime at a time to not make a fool of myself... Paid off.
The darn problem is people cannot believe what they can't see. The computer modeling indicated based on the seats that had come in that Dems were quite likely to very, very well. So I just went with it. Either you believe it or not.
I'm far from perfect. But I was very pleased with this appearance at 1010pm on election night. Estimate was solid (called for 35-43 net gain), but also called it a "big blue wave". https://t.co/HgPKpYAATI https://t.co/97NI01TLDv
@kanyeisforkids @NateSander1 @baseballot When the heck did I do that?
Basically, I think Elias (Nelson's attorney) would have to be right that there is a malfunction causing that undervote in Broward. (Could be, tho I lean towards faulty ballot design.) And then some other things as well?... I'm obviously not down in FL, but the math is the math.
My understanding is that there probably are not really anywhere close to enough provisionals to tip the balance in FL. Would need to be part of a number of things going right for Nelson. Any experts have reason to disagree with that?
@ashsoles I think we are saying the same thing?
Correct me if I'm wrong, Snipes destroyed ballots a few years back after making digitized copies of said ballots. This was after they had been counted. It wasn't legal ( i.e was illegal) from what I read, but she didn't make it so that those votes didn't count.
@numanmyname 640 am
Btw, seems to me Scott arguing Snipes is bad at her job and needs supervision is one thing. Rallying around "fraud" is something entirely different.
@hannahzee I think the MoE gets it across to most... :)
And as we know Snipes has done a bad job before... SO it's not like this should be a shocker...
Pretty good point just brought up in the mentions... If Scott didn't think highly of Snipes, why didn't he just do remove her as Bush did to her predecessor? Did state law change since then? (A FL expert may know more on this...)

What Nate's saying btw is based upon historical data among factors Broward should have had more votes coming. It's far more likely that this is just regular votes being counted late than that these votes are coming from magic land.

@ItiRoto Trump's a she?
I read this as very bad for Trump, personally. But I'm interested in other people's thoughts... https://t.co/ZbLf2ObDa7
I remember 1. I dreaded when Cohn put GA-6 on his districts to be polled because we had about 3 months of it. 2. Lucy McBath popped into the mentions in a very funny way... and now she's going to Congress... Twitter can be an amazing place.
2. Democrats decide to nominate someone who is electoral poison. IDK who that person is... but if the 2020 election is about Trump and his approval rating is what it is today, he will lose.
So how can Trump survive in 2020?... Two ways: 1. He has got to get his approval rating into the high 40s instead of the low to mid 40s. That is of course very possible with the economy. The problem for Trump is that he hasn't done it at a single point in his presidency.
Here's the link for that https://t.co/nW6xM7OOsi... Now obviously this stuff is dependent on who the Democrats nominate... but there's plenty of reason to think the electoral college/pop vote split of 2016 won't hold in 2020.
Well my good friend Mr. Nathaniel Read Silver took at a look at the 2018 results through the lens of the electoral college... And found that Trump's supposed electoral college advantage may not actually be there for him in 2020.
Then after 2014, I wrote there was a major sign that the Democrats had big Midwest problems. It turns out that held for 2016, as Trump scaled and climbed over that blue wall. https://t.co/A5hmwWHvEi
3. Prior to 2016, there was a big discussion about the Democrats big blue wall in the Midwest giving them an electoral college advantage. I wrote that was a trash argument (https://t.co/pmR5Gkv5yM). EC advantages can change from election to election.
That was higher than it was among all adults, but it's still not very good. And if it holds for 2020, the president will be in major, major trouble. *I should note: Democrats who want to take advantage of this should not nominate someone is disliked by the public.
You want to look at the registered/likely voter approval ratings for Trump... Trump's net approval rating before the election among them per 538? -9 (https://t.co/InRMzIwXZX) IN the exit polls, it was?... You guessed it -9.
2. The slightly good news for Trump is that many outlets will first report the adult, not registered or likely voter approval ratings for the president. That's fine, but as I have noted previously, it's probably not the one that matters for elections. https://t.co/uTBcTGoycK
Well what happened on Tuesday? The 2018 was more a referendum on an incumbent president than any midterm since exit polls started asking about presidential approval. Trump's approval rating mattered a TON. https://t.co/tGO3gkU9JQ
I had argue that this argument missed one very important fact: Hillary Clinton was very unpopular in 2016. When she wasn't part of the equation, Trump's unpopularity would shine through. https://t.co/ZMI8oNiLjj
1. There had been a ton of talk about how Trump won in 2016 despite being so unpopular. Therefore, it didn't matter that he was unpopular now. People said approval/favorable wasn't a good metric for capturing Trump. (2/???)
I'll put this in article form, but Tuesday's results seem to prove three important things... Two are very bad for Trump for 2020. One is better, but doesn't come close to eliminating the other two... Let's go through them...
If this administration is just a tv show, this would be the equivalent of Patrick Duffy appearing in the shower. https://t.co/WLJxpLsWPE
Who are the Dems nominating in 2020? https://t.co/JAla2L6NtH
To butcher a quote from Newt Gingrich after 1994, if this isn't a wave, I'd like to know what a wave is. This is this biggest net gain in the House for the Dems in the House since Watergate.
@shuconn Given McCaskill ran in a much better Dem year and as an incumbent, which in theory should give a nominee strength... Yea, I'd think so.
Democrats Andy Kim in NJ-3 and Xochitl Torres Small in NM-2 were behind after vote counting on Tuesday. After vote counting on Wednesday, Kim has declared victory. Small seems to have an insurmountable lead.
There was some quibbling before the election about whether John James or Beto O'Rourke was the "rising star". In the end both lost, but both also did well given the state's political baselines.
RT @NateSilver538: @ForecasterEnten Beto-Kander 2020?
McCaskill easy defeat last night suggests that Kander was a really good candidate.
@PrezWatchingTV Using 2010 because it was at least competitive.
Comparing Manchin's 2010 winning map to 2018 is something else. Consider Mingo County in the southern part of the state. Manchin won it by  37 in 2010. He lost it by 13 last night. That's a 50 point swing.
Give you an indication of how weird our politics is... The GOP prez nominee from 2012 ran and won for a seat to the Senate from Utah... and it was like a page 97 story. Oh and he is the former governor of a state on the opposite side of the country (Massachusetts).
If by Clueless, you mean am I Cher Horowitz? No, I did love the film though. https://t.co/xdX27rG1ru
Two additional thoughts: just because something is "legal" doesn't make it smart. 2. Yes I'm aware of NC, and I'm also aware of how that backfired politically.

Just got off the phone with a producer who made me promise that I wouldn't eat Popeyes in the next 2 hours.
*Joe Cunningham first elected white DEMOCRAT in the Deep South since 2012.
One random fact/one question: 1. I believe Joe Cunningham becomes the first white member of the House elected in the Deep South since John Barrow was in 2012. 2. When was the last time a black woman (see Lucy McBath) was elected to a majority white district in the Deep South?
The president wanted this midterm to be about him. And in the House, that meant presidential approval was more highly correlated with the result than in any midterm. This in turn led to a rebuke of the GOP, Trump, and his presidency. https://t.co/tGO3gkU9JQ https://t.co/zBOyxAtrCh
I felt like that wasn't a problem last night... which is good. Because when a "miss" like 2016 comes, the public/audience should be prepared. I have a better feeling that they will be than they were in 2016.
Most times modelers/race raters average/median forecast won't be anywhere near as good as last night. That's OK and expected. What's absolutely key is the probabilities/margin of error are properly calibrated. I fear some didn't do that in 2016...
In the Senate the GOP did a little better than the median/average... but there were a lot of close races... and it was well noted that the GOP had plenty of upside. That's what a good forecast is. It's to tell you of the realistic possibilities.
They were on the whole pretty darn good. Every race rater (I think) and pretty much every modeler (not all but most) had Dem gains in the House between 30 and 40 and the GOP more likely to gain seats in the Senate.
From that end, the pictures were pretty darn clear: strong Dem chance in the House. Strong GOP chance in the Senate. That clearly was right... Now if you wanna pick apart how close the average or median of each forecasts was to the right result. It's pretty clear...
Almost all the poll averages were well within any 95% confidence intervals even where they missed. As for the forecasts, I don't know how to grade them per se (yea there are briers for probabilities). Their real job is to point towards the likelihood of something occurring.
Again, just a few quick words on polling/forecasting etc. The polling I thought was generally quite predictive (whether that be Mr. Cohn in the House) or the many statewide Senate polls. They obviously weren't perfect. Polls in red states generally overestimate Senate Dems. (1/?)
By the time we know the winners in some of these races, someone will have declared and then dropped out of the 2020 campaign. https://t.co/NvYvlbM7gC
I mean NY-11 btw. I'm thinking of the old map on little sleep.
That's why all the money the Dems raised mattered so much. Without it, Rose may have been an after thought... With it, he was able to tell his story... and in the end it wasn't close, He easily beat Donovan. Which if you know SI, wasn't easy to do.
You might remember how "high" I was on Max Rose and NY-13... (Note: this was somewhat independent, though informed by, "The Forecast".) Part of it is my weirdo love affair with SI. Part of it was that every other single darn ad on WNBC was Max Rose.
@merica LOL
Whose ready for some 2020? I know I am! :)
@PatrickRuffini Lol
I gotta find a Wendy's.
As I said about 95 hours ago (or it feels like that), our models continue to forecast Tester.
So how's everyone doing?
We got McBath by over 1k votes right now in Georgia 6th... Poor Jon Ossoff.
Great work. https://t.co/hIZTTmMFrN
All jokes aside (and I've made many about Texas)... Ted Cruz won by just 3. If the next Dem presidential candidate doesn't make a major play for the state, they should be removed for political ineptness.
Election nights are a little more tense now that I do it for a living, but they are still fun as heck.
Florida just felt like such a repeat of 2010, 2014, and 2016... Initial results look good for the Dems... Then the Panhandle comes in... and then the GOP leads the rest of the way.
@NathanWurtzel Cuse me... That's Alaska Survey Research or whatever that was and then clicked on the link, realized it was Ivan Moore, and was like "LOL."
There's not a single GOP representative left in President Donald Trump's home city;
One thing I like about House elections... You see the 1 in 200 times when media organizations will miscall a race. It's a perfect example of a confidence interval in real time.
The fact that GA-06 is still ongoing is a sick joke by the electoral gods.
There are obviously individual races that were forecasted wrong. We expect that to happen... But overall from my perspective, this was a good night for polling and forecasting overall.
So our final House forecast was Democrats at 227. Right now Democrats leading in... 227 seats. That's really just luck. In the Senate, we had GOP at 52 seats. That'll be a touch too low, but well within the margin of error. 1/2
Scott Walker saw the Dem tide coming ashore... and it looks like it didn't matter.
I'm gonna need another 45 sodas. BRB.
Internal modeling really likes Tester even if the vote count is getting closer.
@Nate_Cohn LIES. (The part of it being the best.)
Remember in polling world a +1 Dem forecast that ends up as +3 Dem is same error as +1 Dem forecast that ends up as +1 GOP. In real world that isn't the case, of course. But polling errors don't care about the real world.
So let's see the final Senate forecast taking into account all the polling was +2 Nelson and like +3 Gillum. The margin of error on those were way higher than that. And that was perhaps one of the worst states for polling.
People were like "why is the margin of error so wide on your forecasts?" Answer: I look at past polling accuracy. It's really that simple.
It was a very good night for polling.
Gosh, how close is that Wisconsin governor's race.
Republicans are doing very well in Senate races including MO where we think Hawley will win. https://t.co/mVODmyW0ZH
CNN has projected the House for the Democrats. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Democrats, by my forecast, are easily going to take back the House. The question is how high it goes. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
See to me this is a wave election. In the House, where the entire country got to vote, Dems are winning with ease. Further, there have been some surprises, which is indicative of a wave in my mind.
I'm came to CNN for that tv forecast on election night. Worth it.
CNN has projected the Senate for the Republicans. We've also projected Texas for Ted Cruz. (No comment.)
Based on internal modeling and returns, I believe is now "likely" (highest category I'll go) that Democrats will take back the House. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Things are looking better for Democrats in the House by the minute per our internal modeling. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Modeling is actually decently close in MI-Senate... but Stabenow should hold on...
The deal in the House was pretty simple. There was just too much exposure for the GOP. So even if they outperform in some areas, there are others where they aren't. Hence, Dems favored in the House. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Modeling suggests right now that Kemp in GA will end up with more votes and avoid a runoff, but it is within the margin of error.
Feel so confident about Braun that I've moved onto Texas Senate forecast. Cruz looks likely to win based upon internal modeling and counties still out. There is a question mark with Harris County though. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Feel pretty good about our House projection at this point. We were consistently between 30 and 32 for a Dem net gain. Still plenty of time to go, however.
Meanwhile Joe Manchin just keeps on chugging along...
This is going to be one heck of an interesting after election day. But for now, we're counting vote and making forecasts. Still think it's leaning Dem in the House... for now.  https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Where is this vote in FL for Gillum/Nelson? The lead is still a point for the GOP candidates and more and more of Broward/Miami come in.
Pre-election forecast for Senate was GOP with 52 +/- 4... Not really sure how we get to the minus side of that for them. Things look really, really good for the GOP in the Senate.
Emerging Democratic Majority based upon a diversifying nation?... Florida is a great example of how flawed that thesis is.
House is still leaning in the Democrats direction, but if it was on the border of Lean/Likely earlier... The GOP is doing better at this point. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89
Brian Kemp has gotta like the results so far in Georgia.
Right now the best call in Florida is that it's a toss-up. What else is new?... BTW the internal models in Texas are surprisingly a little tight.
There better be a lot of votes in Broward left for the Dems, and I'm not sure there are...
Those early Panhandle county reports are closing the FL results very quickly.
For all the talk about split tickets in FL, it's not happening. Very similar margins so far in Gov/Sen races.
We'll know plenty more about Florida in about 20 minutes...
Internal modeling looks good for Manchin in WV so far.
I still can't believe they spent all that money on Comstock.
Dems are, so far, leading in the races they need to in the House. Want some more urban vote before thinking Donnelly is going down, but rural very strong for Braun. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89

@NateSilver538 I'm going to keep a red bull by me tonight to remind of Micah and you.
That is, the distribution is asymmetrical... There's a better chance of a BIG miss in which the Dems benefits than a BIG miss in which the GOP benefits. (Most of the GOP misses are ones in which they do a little better than thought.)
The polling indicates that people were clearly burned by 2016. Gallup shows people actually expect the Republicans to maintain House control. That's certainly plausible, but the models suggest a. unlikely. b. there's a skew in the Democrats favor. (1/?)
@kwcollins @aedwardslevy Adam Berinsky has some great stuff on this.
@ericbradner It's this..... close.
Finally, the forecast was a team effort with @spetulla, @parkermquinn, @bdlacree, @vijithassar, @mathisonian, @bradoyler, and Will Mullery. Please visit the web pages to see their great work! https://t.co/HFSvRkQgNC and https://t.co/CpzmB8L3jl
@SteveKornacki LOL.
If we get each individual Senate race, it'll actually be a 50-50 Senate. But because there are so many close Dem wins projected, model expects Dems to lose a few of those... So I'm not entirely sure how to judge forecast accuracy in that case?
As spoken about in the piece, two notes: 1. there is an asymmetric skew in the House. The ceiling for Dems is much higher than the floor is low. 2. There are a lot of close Senate Dem victories forecasted...
Final forecast House median: Democrats 227, GOP 208. Final forecast House average: Democrats 229, GOP 206. Final forecast Senate: GOP 52, Dem 48. Margin of error wide enough for a GOP House or Dem Senate. https://t.co/uC06Sit4PM

@DCclone Path was clear.
So Rosen has pulled into the lead in late NV polling. (Up less than a point.) But model says too many close leads plus lack of a 51st pickup opportunity means GOP quite likely to maintain control.
@jenn_cervella Yea I realize that now. Oh well.

Call it noise (which i'm tempted to do), but interesting how the two quality national polls this morning have Dems down a tad on the generic (though well in line with the average) compared with the Siena/NYT polls showing a bit of a late break for the Dems.
Many things about this presidency are different than the norm, but a prez's party losing 30+ house seats in a midterm when his approval is below 50% is about as normal as you get.

On the sole question of being a good "politician", the fact that Trump's approval rating is this low with this economy is certainly a point in the camp of Trump not being a good pol.
If you knew nothing but the state of the economy and plugged that into a model, you'd think Trump is a favorite for reelection. Thing is 1. His approval still is very "meh". 2. Who knows the state of the economy in two years.

@NateSilver538 U read ur replies?
@EdAsante77 I mean idk what exactly u mean by that. There are similar dynamics but the races are different.
@EdAsante77 I mean I think I'm an honest guy. If I were betting against myself, it would be in MO and IN.
@EdAsante77 GOP won the pop vote by 6 in 2014. They'll lose it by 8 or 9 this time. Yea, I think it is.
I gotta think it would be one of the ugliest campaigns I've seen. If it happened. https://t.co/6zNLnUMSRj
A few things. One Cotton and McConnell were favored by the end, but won by larger margins than thought. Two, the national environments are quite different. https://t.co/niPT39yu2p
Most polls have show Kemp up a point or 2. This one has Abrams up a point with a runoff looming. https://t.co/ZXIKkrponZ
These are the potential surprises. https://t.co/UWPTD7p5MA

They can get rid of the like button on Twitter if they wish, but if they ever get rid of the mute button... I wouldn't like that very much.
Polling errors do happen. But it would take more than a normal polling error for the Dems to take back the Senate or win these races. And if you followed me at all, you'd know I was pushing TN as a state they could win. TX has been the one where I was like "wut?" https://t.co/wlevpiyiMP

@Nate_Cohn How did I miss this tweet?
If I had two "fears" (and they're not really fears because they're well covered by the distributions) is that 1. Dems win all the tight races in the House and get well over 40 seats. 2. Hasn't been enough late polling in IN/MO Senate, and GOP is actually up there.
@NateSilver538 MAYBE THERE WILL BE A MIRACLE!!!!! (There won't be. This all sounds correct.)
@ColtonBrowder The mean is better for the Dems... Cause the distribution skews to their side...
@BruneElections A seat or two for the House.
@SirKennyRob I mean sure. But for a mainstream audience I'm not trying to confuse with two numbers.
One question I've wondered is whether to report the average simulation or the median simulation.
@mrpaweska @kkondik @SeanTrende Yep, it was not.
@charea The coefficients are based off of data since 1992. The data for 2018 is modern, if that makes any sense.
This is based off of data since 1992.

@LoganDobson I'm aware of this job, Logan.
@LoganDobson U on the record many times wondering why we even have them, and then u can't help but look at them.
I really gotta pin this. It's because there are so many close Dem wins that probabilistically the model thinks they'll lose one of them. https://t.co/WmDYL4eTfw
@LoganDobson U have a weird relationship with public polling.
@DrKlep The issue this year is that 51st seat seems really out there... It was easy enough to see in 2006, even if they had to win all the close ones. This year they have to win all the close ones and then one that isn't so close.

@JewdyGold I'm beginning to sense that you don't like the president.
So here's where we stand with a little more than a week to go, GOP looks likely to pick up a seat or two in the Senate... Dems look like they'll have a wave but not a tsunami in the House. We'll have split control &amp; 2020 blossomed on Nov 7th.
@mattyglesias Pretty much.
Two things: 1. winning independents is usually associated with winning overall. 2. Y'all think I'm upset with the headline. I'm not really. I think it's actually pretty clever from an SEO standpoint as I stated.
@nathanlgonzales I had this a 2 point race before this poll came out...  Hmph.
I mean I knew that wasn't the case because I have no life and can probably recite every Texas poll over the last month by heart... but to the little to none informed, it's clearly meant to bring you in. It's a pretty clever in that way.

@EdAsante77 I mean he wasn't favored. That's for sure. But the polling indicated an outside shot.

Answer: I'd estimate at this point that if Dems were getting the support among men that they are getting among women and they were getting the support among women that they are getting among men... That their margin on the generic ballot would be like 1.5 to 2 points less. https://t.co/E6ho4xur5h
We could still a record gender gap, but Republicans could also hold the House... /fin.
We're heading towards a record gender gap in 2018... It happens that this looks like good news for Dems because women are voting in record numbers for Democrats... but if the polls are off on both women and men... (3/?)
If men are all of a sudden voting much more Republican, then the gender gap will benefit Republicans.... That's why it's important not only to look at the difference, but also at the overall margins from women and men. (2/?)
Can we talk about the gender gap for a minute?... I think there is a bias (perhaps I'm wrong here) that a gender gap is good news for Democrats. That's not necessarily the case. All it means is women and men are voting differently (1/?)

@NateSilver538 I could imagine in MS having an error that no where else has that allows McDaniel to get into spot 2... Granted, the chance of that is... well, it's not that high. And even then, him losing in the runoff is no sure thing.
How Dems get the Senate is pretty clear... Win everything that is close then pick off TX (i'm doubtful), TN (???), get a Heitkamp surge (???), or hope for something funky in MS-Special.

Ideologically speaking, a Gillum/Scott voter makes little sense... But on the insider/outsider perspective (or Washington vs. Tallahassee), it makes at least a little sense... I'd be interested in hearing from those with more expertise on the state on this one...
BTW, getting asked this a lot... Who are the Scott-Gillum voters? In the CNN poll, one thing stands out... They tend to be under 45... Not exactly a large sample size, though.
@lex_nyc I see that but I think it's a miscode... cause they make up 3% of the sample clearly.
Here's another poll from Florida. This one has Gillum +6 and Scott +2... https://t.co/Hfl3IMPYX5
LOL. https://t.co/oPYVpEHKVG
BTW, none of you know which way the error (and there will be likely be at least a little bit of one) will go. Of course if the Dems up with 50 net gain, there will be a lot less come-up-ins than if they end up with a net gain of 20.
@RalstonReports To be fair, I think you have a weeeeeee bit more knowledge than most.
TBH, the whole MS-special is kinda a fly-by-night operation for figuring out a probability. Does Espy have a 20% chance? 5%? 10%? IDK.
I agree with this 100%. This was a great writeup btw https://t.co/4P0U1jXTUC by @jennagiesta of the poll today. https://t.co/2gEgrHIXmq

@EdAsante77 We shall. Certainly not a large enough advantage to be outside the MoE.

Honestly(?), the midterm feels anti-climatic. (We'll see if I feel that way in a few weeks.) For now, Kavanaugh coverage ate up a chunk of what would have been midterm coverage. Additionally, the race for the House/Senate are not over, but they aren't particularly close either.
@TylerDinucci Ha. I think they released the better result for them in at least one of those districts...
All the House polls I get come from this page (https://t.co/rpViTqMpwz) which is invaluable... Also, I can only wonder why same polling firm released an RV result in IA and an LV result in NY... https://t.co/gSyISZGR4U

Aaron Rodgers is good at football.
Now I got a conservative friend emailing me results that his kids are 1/32nd Native American... He has attached the 23andMe test...
What I keep telling myself is that margins of error are there for a reason. There's still a lot TBD with 3 weeks to go.
If ur on this Acela train and see some crazy dude conducting and mouthing "The Giants Win the Pennant", it's just I listening to the SportsCentury theme song as I write about Latinos in the 2018 election.

I'm not taking into account internal polls for the Senate, but my old friends @fivethirtyeight are... WPA Intelligence has such a pro GOP House effect that the addition of that Cruz +9 poll to the average actually strengthened's O'Rourke's chances.
@NateSilver538 Just wanna keep you on the ball.
@stevesingiser @SeanTrende Didn't Monmouth do the same in WV a few months back?
@HotlineJosh I thought that was... odd... and telling.

@acheck10 We do note on a number of cases and in the methodology that it's 95% and 1/20 could be outside of it... but interesting point!
Texas-23 is also interesting... We have an asymmetric distribution.  Given some of the polling, it seems plausible that Hurd could blow it open. Granted, Ortiz Jones is still in it. https://t.co/7Cd7sphJk9
Interested on Ojeda NYT poll. Model I've worked on w/ @bdlacree @parkermquinn forecasts him to lose by just 5. Keep in mind weighted average partisanship (takes into account state elections) is considerably bluer (though still really red) than prez vote. https://t.co/Xc5o6nDCnE

@Nate_Cohn Solid selections.
I view national polling as one of many variables. Obama was competitive. Clinton was too. You wanna look at state polling too :). In fact, those who poll worse in early state polling relative to national polling tend to do worse overall. https://t.co/0twXhSlnOg
Sanders at 13% is bad. https://t.co/VevIXgt6sp
Note: there are a lot of factors to be looked at. I'm not saying Biden has the best shot of being the nominee. (I actually don't think he does.) But it's silly to ignore data that has proven at least some usefulness. Just put into context.
If you only have 2 candidates running, that's right. But if you have 7-10 as is often the case, knowing something is a 50% probability sure as heck beats believing it's a 10% probability. https://t.co/UONXes46Wc
Romney didn't have a majority in primary polling. Trump didn't have a majority. Again just because it's not the CLEAR OMG AMAZING Clinton numbers it doesn't make it useless. Thing a sliding scale here. https://t.co/kzYrk7H6IX
This is why any forecast will have a wide margin of error. https://t.co/crJBC4n9xD
Slightly more than 50% of candidates who were polling ahead this early won. It's far from perfect, but it's a useful barometer. https://t.co/DVDdteWq3Q
I'm with this guy. I actually think 33% for Biden is not bad. It's not Clinton levels... but it's entirely respectable for a field that currently has about 200 candidates listed. https://t.co/KbvQQ5EzNF

It'll be interesting to see if the 2018 trends in the midwest hold for 2020... If so, Trump's electoral college/popular vote split strategy may not work out...

Epilogue: The dog's name was Cody Hugo.
So, we decided to make Cody part of our family... And let me tell you, my Father and he were the two best friends I ever had. That dog was there through thick and thin. Just awesome stuff. When I, at least, look at his pic, I cannot help but smile. That's why he's my avatar.
They pulled on his tail... they did all the things a young child might do to see if the dog would bite... The dog didn't flinch. He just shivered... The shelter therefore felt safe enough to say the dog could live with a kid under 6... That is, the person typing these words.
here*... Anyway, so back we went inside... There was a lhasa apso named Cody... but Cody was only really for children 6 and over... My Mom insisted though... and so they took Cody out of his cage... And folks, this dog was petrified.
@Nate_Cohn Certainly not after a snowstorm. First off, they didn't do that then... Second, the names they have no are like Hercules or Juno or Qui-gon or whatever.
So my Mom decided it was time for us to leave... Upon leaving her children began to cry... We wanted a dog... My Nana told my Mom "you can't leave her without getting them a dog..."
Well, the shelter didn't have any poodles. In fact, they didn't have any small dogs (we lived in an apartment at the time) that was appropriate for children under the age of 6...
When I was 4, my Mom got convinced to head with her children to the North Shore Animal Shelter. My Nana came along. We wanted to get a poodle because when we were house hunting we met a poodle named Hugo.
Phew.
I gotta bring the dog back. This stinks.
@Nate_Cohn Oh we'll notice.
Since when does Wheel of Fortune have vertical and horizontal words? What is going on?!
Yep. https://t.co/FhW4XoAiSb
@PollsAndVotes I also got into this segment somehow... but I had a silent role.

https://t.co/Spn8ztaNIu
@lycosid_ They will shrink yes. If the average right now is a range of 40, I'd think it'd get down to a range closer to 30. Basically closer to what the Senate is now...
@SeanTrende I feel like I wrote about this... and concur.
@vanreuter @jonfavs @McCorvic Sure, but usually folks donate to candidates who are strong/have best shot of winning.
@jonfavs @McCorvic Right, all I said today is that when you're trying to predict... Having someone raise so much and be down in the polls leads to a weirdo spot.
@Robeno @Nate_Cohn Yep. That's why we have it so tight. The fundamentals there are still overwhelmingly Dem, so we're trying to meld conflicting pieces of information.
@Roarschach2 LOL. Yes, first day quirks.
@Robeno @Nate_Cohn We know :)... First day quirks. You can also type in the address or district in the bar above.
BTW, I don't think Texas Senate is done if you believe the public data. Yes, the Q-Pac and Siena polls... BUT... Ipsos had O'Rourke up just a few weeks ago. Cruz is a clear favorite, but O'Rourke still has a shot.
@DCclone @spetulla (It's there. The map just has an issue that will be fixed. You can also type it in at the top.)
I also found out a lot about building a website and the hard work that goes into it... It is a team effort... I didn't get it, and I still don't get it well... But @spetulla has at least moved me a little bit...
I just wanna say that doing this process gave me eve more respect for @natesilver538. I told him this at dinner a month ago. This entire thing took about 4 more months than I thought it would. What he does is so amazing, and the statistical critiques of him are flat out wrong.
@NYer4HRC Aware... When a race is within 0.5 points, the page does funky things. If you see anything else, let me know :).
@smotus @heisers Well in that case, we're all screwed :).
Beto is screwing with the idea that money raised matters in modeling outcomes because people seem to be donating to him without realizing he's probably gonna lose.
@_ Margins of error are what they are :). It's how good the polling has been since 1992...
@stebuu @FiveThirtyEight It says most likely. Not very likely.
@FiveThirtyEight This is also an interesting thing we've been playing with. That's why we've also included at the top a clear voice of what is the best case and worst case in pure seat numbers. https://t.co/14U1qXEHMK
I have tried not to fight this particular fight. I love what my old friends @fivethirtyeight did with x in y chance. I'm trying to use language people encounter everyday in polling. https://t.co/JK2FfmTOdt
I think most of the predictions aren't shockers... Dems gaining 34 seats in the House and losing 1 in the Senate is well in-line with the conventional wisdom. What I'm mostly hoping for is an understanding of margin of error.
People have asked me whether or not the forecasts on Twitter I keep mentioning will appear on its own website... Answer is yes. We're going to try this. See if we can make get it beyond a nerdy audience. https://t.co/mVODmyEq89

Noting a margin of error and not being sure ain't punditry. As I said, I think the race is closer than this poll is... but it's within the MoE that this poll is a correct gauge of the race. https://t.co/iB0fMlz7T7
I tend to look away from reading too much into crosstabs tbh in determining a poll's accuracy. Now do I believe that particular number? No. Doesn't mean the topline is wrong. Could be though... I have the race closer than that... https://t.co/diP81R9itw

@JamesKPolkrface @538politics Fascinating. Others have felt differently, but it's good to have different viewpoints! :)
You know it's funny. This is exactly right. I remember how cruel Yankee fans were to me in middle and high school. Then 2004 came, and the tables turned... I remember that day after. Wore a red sweater and Red Sox camp, carried a Sox bat, and got a 98 on a chem exam. https://t.co/JWeRzRKszV
@JamesKPolkrface Are you sure you have the correct order? (Honest question...)
@DanRosenheck I believe it's lower than that.
@tankcat Brutal.
In a sense, yes... but I think most folks thought Collins would win by 10ish... and this is far closer than that. https://t.co/3M6j9xnv3U
@PeterTuths Dem pollster. Need to see more.
It means I don't know what to make of it... Hence the hmmmm https://t.co/liR77lZ7OA

The high quality polls in Texas Cruz by ~10... The lower quality ones have it closer to like 2ish on average.

@LPDonovan GOP +2...
@IDUnavailable Results are correlated, but not perfectly.
It is plausible that Dems win control of the Senate. It's within the margin of error. It's just not the most likely outcome :). https://t.co/rUDlrVPngN
This is the 2016 problem again. Dems lead a lot of close races. The GOP leads are solid. On average, we don't expect the Dems to hold all of their leads. GOP probably will. https://t.co/2wKKvFfa4U
House forecast at this point... Democrats get 225 seats on median, 227 on average... That 95% confidence interval runs from 202 to 258 seats for the Dems...  cc @parkermquinn @bdlacree

AZ: Sinema +1, FL: Nelson +2, IN: Donnelly +3, MO: McCaskill +1, MT: Tester +6, ND: Cramer +4, NJ: Menendez +9, NV: Tie, TN: Blackburn +5, TX: Cruz +4, WV: Manchin +9... GOP pickup forecast: +1.

Bob Casey leads Lou Barletta by 14 in my model... This race isn't close.
@NateSilver538 PA-MI-OH-WI Senate races are simply not close... And Dems are either tied or leading in the governor's races in the midwest as well...
@LPDonovan The whole thing is very weird... and very difficult to poll and model...
If (and it's a pretty gosh darn long odds scenario), McDaniel somehow sneaks in against Espy for spot 2... It'd be an interesting affair.
We're operating w/ a pretty clear deck in most senate races that matter... except one. Mississippi Special (where there's a jungle primary). There has been 1 nonpartisan poll since August. It was a SurveyMonkey poll. It had a TON of undecideds and top 3 within 6 of each other.
See here's where this type of thinking just doesn't click. Campaign pollsters make $$$ by alerting candidates on best messaging/strategy to help win a race. A public website makes $$$ by attracting readers through any means necessary. https://t.co/iCKS9Pfms9

One thing to potentially watch is if the individual Senate races lag the generic ballot movement that we may be seeing... We'll see.
@DemFromCT It's 100% plausible... Equal to or better than Trump winning at end of 2016.
@JustTeege @Patriot_Pat1 Let's assume Dems make no gains (i.e. lose AZ/NV)... Then they lose... MO, ND, WV, FL, IN, and... MT... that's one way it happens... you could also switch in NJ for one of those... it's a tail scenario. not likely by any means :).

@BioTurboNick As opposed to two-party vote percentages that do the same throughout academia?

Now if ur comparing a vote percentage in one case with a margin in another... That's a whole different ballgame.

@topchef100 @CNN Happy to answer but can you explain a little more what you mean? I think I getcha, but wanna make sure.
@NateSilver538 Nate, we're going down to MS together for that runoff.
FWIW, my forecast will have Blackburn +5 if this result holds as is... so it is far more pro-GOP than what I would have even incorporating it. https://t.co/lbbKLyAJ7a
Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but back in my youth we use to solicit dates on Twitter. None of this Instagram/Bumble stuff. https://t.co/2MXjpJHPea
Fantastic baseball going on right now.
I don't wanna say that TN poll is looking really good for Blackburn, but it's looking really good. We'll see if it is just a head fake... but that's not a statistically insignificant sample.
It's pretty simple: if the polling holds in the first 3 states, then Dems need MS to have any shot at a majority. Of course, maybe the other states won't hold... https://t.co/sAiYft7GIB
@TheRichardSands Basically, if the GOP wins all three of those, there is no path to a Dem Senate majority... Unless they win in MS...

Margin of error applies to both candidates. There are also design effects. An approval rating of 36% vs. 41% is worth ~20 seats. A ~50 vs. ~30 seat gain for the Dems I'd say. The rest of this is so ridiculous I'll merely say go Red Sox! https://t.co/DeB9SPmG0X

@sdsuaztec4 Model expects an Espy/Hyde-Smith runoff... and a Hyde-Smith win in said runoff.

@SeanTrende Said last night to someone this exact thing...
TBH, we'll really need to see a Tennessee poll that had Bredesen up before showing him trailing now before declaring that race over. Like the Fox News poll this week had him down 5... but it previously had him down 3... No doubt he trails though.
Well, none of those YouGov results really moved the needle much from what I can see.

@AndreyM013 This includes a control for the fundamentals...
@Saltor6 The modal outcome here is no gain. That's different than the mean/median which are both GOP +1.

Okay, two-pronged question here for Democrats... 1. Do you think someone more liberal than Manchin could win WV? (And I mean like truly more liberal, not like a foot to the left...) 2. Regardless do you think Manchin should be primaried next go around?

Jeb Bradley says "Yo, what's up?" https://t.co/Wnlnf7PS4Z
5. This will seem counterintuitive based on the previous tweets, but I do think Heitkamp has a chance to close. She's down by more than the fundamentals indicate. And we don't know how Kavanaugh will play (though polling suggests it hurts, not helps her).
4. I looked it up. I don't really see a consistent bias against the Democrats in North Dakota polling. The polling in the 2010 House race (statewide in ND) showed Rick Berg ahead by 10... He won by 10. 2008 prez polling showed Obama up. He lost by nearly 10. (?/?)
This year there hasn't been any statewide internal polling put out by the Dems. (I'm aware of the polling put out of one section of the state.) (4/?)
3. Democrats (and Heitkamp's campaign team in particular) put out a number of internal polls showing her ahead to counter public polling in 2012. This actually gave her a lead in the https://t.co/O1W15BDpVy aggregate. (3/?)
I see a lot of people point to the 2012 polling being off to argue the polls are off again... I see some faulty logic there in a number of places... 1. The final public poll actually had Heitkamp down only 2 points... (2/?)
This is gonna shock folks, but I'm gonna say trust the polls. I think Heitkamp really is in trouble. (1/?) https://t.co/uM6t6rVQpo

We're about a month from the midterms, and I'm unaware of a single Senate poll released today. That's interesting.
Strikes me as unlikely, but if Collins ever voted no and Manchin voted yes, I'm not sure why Manchin is a Dem. With Thomas/Hill back in 1991, there was a good chunk of the Dem base in favor of Thomas. This is totally different.
I mean Manchin is going to vote with the majority in the final vote... So really this is about Collins... Right?

@evansiegfried @DemFromCT Yankees suck. (This may or may not have anything to do with the convo.)
The electoral positions between Heitkamp and Manchin couldn't be more different. Re-ran my model... Manchin +8... Heitkamp -4 (though more like -4.5)... Heitkamp has little lose... Manchin has a lot. Be interesting to see what he does...

@NateSilver538 Good stuff. :)
This is a lesson from 2016... If you are leading a lot of tight races, there's a decent chance it won't all go ur way... GOP has more safe seats than the Dems do. Hence, the mean is more favorable to the GOP than just looking at who is winning individually... https://t.co/2KAqG0AcQN
@mattmfm Concur on that! Followed it up :).
@mattmfm It shouldn't... More safe GOP seats... Dems could sweep the board and pick up a ton, but there is more upside for the GOP.
The range on this is huge btw... 95% confidence interval... Goes from Dems gaining 4 to GOP gaining 6... So still a lot undecided with a month to go...
Here's where I have things: AZ-Sinema +2, FL-Nelson +2, IN-Donnelly +3, MO-McCaskill +1, MT-Tester +3, ND-Cramer +4, NJ-Menendez +8, NV-Rosen +1, TN-Blackburn +2, TX-Cruz +3, WV-Manchin +8... Average: GOP gains 0.7 seats.
Well this was written ugly... What I meant to get across is that GOP candidates are gaining support, but not because of expected turnout differences. Rather, people who were already gonna vote are changing their minds.
What does seem to be occurring is that the GOP is picking up support among voters in the past views... but that's far more about persuasion than it is about turnout...
I think people have the Kavanaugh thing wrong. I see no real sign in lv vs. rv that Kavanaugh is making GOP more likely to vote than they were before... At least relative to Democrats... 1/?

This is a fascinating split in the Q-Pac poll. Menendez has a -19 point net fav rating... He has a +2 job approval rating. It makes sense, but is telling for why he is still ahead. (Obviously, Trump being who he is also plays a significant role.)
On the one hand, Menendez is up 11... On the other... this is his best poll, which tells you something about him given the national environment and the state. https://t.co/HEaKRW8dpQ

@Nate_Cohn We'll see what I can do.
Podcast fans... What would you think if we led off with a top-line overview of where the Senate/House stand overall. Then do a deep dive into 2 House and 2 Senate races and what they say about the overall environment... and do a quick game segment to end.
@nokin50 This is helpful. Thanks :).
@richiesol3865 U'll notice I amended. Judge found him not guilty. There was also a hung jury.
If it somehow McDaniel, then all bets are off. https://t.co/GMdpWdf8gw
@DeemerPete Good comment. I may disagree, but will take it under consideration :).
@jennybtucker Yes.
That Mississippi Special is weird. I say that because the first round polling has tended to show a lot of undecideds. The best bet by far is Hyde-Smith/Espy runoff with Hyde-Smith favored... but boy that's a weird one.
Because how many times has an incumbent been defending a seat in a state as red as North Dakota for instance? (That sample size is small.) https://t.co/e1qppLMXoh
@jeff_crandall Honesty... but not brutal... It's fair. We'll see if we improve... Maybe you'll like it someday...

@komanyoga Again, it's a first episode. (Actually it's episode zero.) We'll find the max utility :). This is why i wanted the feedback.
@breedenideas @komanyoga That's not particularly nice to a load of people. Remember, there are other people on the end of this who are trying very, very hard. You can be honest and say you want geekier/didn't enjoy it too much... but let's be nice! :)
I asked for constructive but kind feedback folks. There's honesty and then there's brutal honesty. Let's stay with the former, not the latter. Inaugural pods are works in progress.  It takes time! :) https://t.co/90h09i93LY
@justkarl It's true.
I think the quote about O'Rourke is that he "is electoral Jesus right now. Flying into the clouds as he spreads his wings and people are reminded of the Kennedys." https://t.co/mBPZfQWCHs
@Sharpe222 So basically keep on doing :).
What do people think? I think we're having fun, which is what pods are supposed to do. But we're obviously first launching, so retools may/probably will happen. Kind/thoughtful insights are welcomed :). https://t.co/x3YrhSMige

Senate races are not as correlated as presidential races, though there's certainly correlation. Most likely outcome I have is no shift. https://t.co/CNwaAHqkto
@jpodhoretz What the heck does that make me?
Congrats to a fellow winter lover! https://t.co/dBbZfFYnbc
Dems need a net gain of 2 in the Senate... They're up by 3 in Arizona. 1 in Nevada. Tied in Tennessee. Down by 3 in North Dakota. Up by just 2 in Missouri... You can see how this is a house made of straw. It could stand, but there's a reason the GOP is favored.
Thanks to a particular impt audience member, I'll be appearing a lot more (as in already have 3 times scheduled today) on ur television discussing the midterms...
Also fights over https://t.co/v7aoXYT2Gu vs. https://t.co/kcSeyiF0Ik with Tristin Tully... I preferred https://t.co/v7aoXYT2Gu. It also ended up being right...
BTW, I love folks sending me screenshots of RCP averages from 2012 races... I remember being at the Yale Bowl on the last Sat before the 2004 election with Adam Feld &amp; calling up home to get someone to read me the latest averages... I was in high school.
Bill Nelson has led in like the last 5 public polls. Leads ranging from 1 to 7 points... https://t.co/qtwoFsWTtC
https://t.co/t0dxi6irsU https://t.co/iadDPRbtWf
@DFMresearch If u have a full statewide picture/estimate, would love to see it :).
Just listened to episode 0 of the pod... It took me about 2 minutes to get in a plug for Wendy's.
Median result continues to be no shift.
Still should note that the Senate map is *wide* open. If there's a 3 point error in the national polling going against the Dems, HUGE GOP night. If an error went the other way, Dems will gain control and more.
I haven't seen a single poll with Heitkamp ahead since like February. There's merely been a lack of polling data... but all polls have her behind. https://t.co/igBaUZDthc
BTW, if the Dems have a good poll in ND and were ever thinking of releasing one, now is the time... The lack of a release may be a reason why it's the one state where a number of race raters have it tilt or lean R. (That is, the internals are bad.)
I had Heitkamp down 1 before the new poll... Down 3 now... in most trouble by far of any Dem incumbent. Heck, I'd put the chance of Beto winning as high as her right now, though some will disagree.
Depends on how hard they're pushing the undecideds... The undecideds in this poll don't look GOPer to me... https://t.co/0AGcEtiqEh
We've had more polls of Electoral Jesus (Beto) in the last 5 minutes than we've had in North Dakota all year. https://t.co/faMwNZmngp
Yea... I know. The real question is whether I can name the polling leader average in every race that year. They also underestimated Tester in Montana that year. https://t.co/49hZILDkFq
Heidi Heitkamp has got some major issues... Joe Manchin looking solid. https://t.co/szwNsO0cKS
Even with that new NJ poll... Still have Menendez projected to win by 10.5 or so... That's down from about 12 yesterday...

Kemp +2 over Abrams with a potential runoff looming. https://t.co/f00C2MAdxo
Menendez only up by 2 here. Still think he'll pull away at the end, but this race is right now closer than West Virginia... https://t.co/eynvmvJMRD
@TMROJ I have Manchin clearly favored.
67 years ago on Wednesday, Ernie Harwell thought he had caught a big break by getting the tv call for the Giants-Dodgers third playoff game. Little did he know his broadcast partner Russ Hodges, who was "stuck" on radio, was the one who'd make history.
The minuses are merely indicative of the fact that the person listed first trails. https://t.co/cZaOJWai3J
I think that's right. I still have Manchin favored, but my fundamental's projection for him is more bearish than Nate's. I'd bet this has something to do with it. https://t.co/PupD0OJb5b
Most of the projections in at least this run of the model are close to Nate's. I'm slightly more bullish on Bredesen/O'Rourke and slightly less so on Heitkamp/Manchin... and no, no competition. https://t.co/2dINfBYeVR
Yes... based on the polls from 1992-2018 (the same dataset that @databyler is using) and a fundamentals projection from that same period, I created a projection. You're looking at the 95% confidence interval of Hawley's lead. The middle is negative because he doesn't lead. https://t.co/2ufHhHMDbR
Here's a projection from Missouri... I got McCaskill by 3 (based on fundamentals + polls), though a Hawley win is well within the model's MoE... (Keep in mind this is just off of 1k iterations of the model... I'm running 10k when I write about this.) https://t.co/xVBVTWEkqF
@xenocryptsite That was bad.
This one is close, though Sinema has an advantage... https://t.co/wovgmcnUVG
Remember when John James was seen as a good candidate? Maybe so... but my goodness... That's what I call a Stabenow lead outside the margin of error. (It's a 17 point Staebnow forecasted win to translate.) https://t.co/MTmsgfsFcV

For the purposes of predicting elections, individual money raised is superior to outside/self raised. Think McMahon in 2010/2012 in CT. https://t.co/eXvpNaWwKU
O'Rourke has a very large money edge... I actually have him ahead in the fundamentals more than @natesilver538... who gives him a slight advantage by the fundamentals. https://t.co/jxvBq3TOdc
Seems to be some movement in the Florida Senate race... It could be moving towards the fundamentals. If other races do that, watch out... It really puts the Senate in play. https://t.co/WnMDEX0nwj
Maybe... https://t.co/dC2UDGaiZe
@UNFPORL And thank you for doing polling right :).
@UNFPORL I believe (and you can correct the record) that those other pollsters are merely asking if folks are independents... It is *not* dependent on party registration (i.e. an independent does not equal NPA) :).
At office at 1223 am on a Friday night... I would y'all are having a better time than I.
@POLITICO_Steve I went last year. Total disaster.
Three polls out this week with Nelson up at least 2 in FL. That race may be moving towards the fundamentals.
Big news I'll be announcing next week. Some of you will be very pleased.
Wut?
This became especially the case when Kyl replaced McCain...
This is why we model things btw... yes models are imperfect but they give us grounding. Given how frequently the GOP stayed together last year, nominations since Bork suggested only a very small chance of non-confirmation.
And folks, I'm not here to comfort u if ur upset involving a political matter. I like u all don't get me wrong. But in my arena to do the best job I can do (some will disagree), I gotta stay dispassionate no matter my own opinion.
Republicans want conservative judges... news at 11.
I put dems chance of taking the house maybe slightly more than gop holding the Senate... but so many close races in the Senate that it could go either way.
This is why I stick to cream soda.
RAWR
This is... something else. And credit to those state legislators in SD who told me over a year ago that this race would be very competitive. https://t.co/dzuk5PZjkW
We have elections. Voters can decide. If ur for people not serving forever, then go for a set term regardless of age. https://t.co/sn84T1oWE7
Case-by-case basis. There are plenty of people who should step aside, but we shouldn't have broad rules on that. Plenty of people's minds (very unfortunately) start to go very early. I wouldn't suggest setting a retirement age at 60 in that case, however. https://t.co/Y4jTGBvh0H
I'm not in love with them from a poli sci angle. But I think that's a better question. https://t.co/sPhBIBj4ut
@jperetz Seems like he is acting like the average Republican would. If you don't like that, it's because of his party... NOthing to do with age.
Side note that I know people will disagree with me on: Grassley/Feinstein are why I don't believe in age limits. I will never see why we should keep people from performing a mental task just because they reach a certain age.  Take it on a case-by-case basis.
Most people believed Thomas over Hill. That's not the case here. Moreover, the questioning of Hill was much more aggressive than this. https://t.co/VRFZsT8uwz
IDK if the outcome will be the same, but the public reaction to Ford/Kavanaugh and the way the hearing has gone is radically different from Hill/Thomas. (No, I wasn't watching that one live, but watching the tapes/reading the polls etc.)
It's true. https://t.co/w5yhIDklGd
This 5 minute rule thing is so weird that if I wrote a script including it in a college play I'd get a D and told it was totally unbelievable. (Then again, if I wrote a script about Trump being prez back in college, I'd probably get told the same thing.)

Michael Avenatti pops up in so many places that I sometimes think we're living in a real life Multiplicity with Avenatti playing the part originally played by Michael Keaton.
"Ancestral Democrats" is a phrase that's gotta get into the 2018 political dictionary. https://t.co/8X4qQZG55Q
What seems plausible if not the most likely outcome in Florida is a black man will be elected governor and the nation's most restrictive law when it comes to former felons voting (which kept many black men from doing so) will be overturned. Kinda a big deal.
@richardmskinner As i think we'd expect?
Suggests some sort of rally around the base(?) perhaps?
Just got asked this... Yes, it does seem Trump's approval rating is up 1.5 over the last two weeks. GOP's generic ballot position also slightly better. Interesting, disapproval has moved less. Dem generic ballot has also pretty much not budged.
