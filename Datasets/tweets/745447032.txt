His profound regret, thoughtfulness, and consideration were striking. As was his openness with a new reporter. I appreciated it, and his work, then and now. My condolences to his family.
Someone had sent @RepWalterJones their son's dogtags. He hung them above the door of his office. That way, he said, he had to look directly at them before he left for every vote - and remember the real-life consequences his votes would have.
They were replies to the condolence letters he sent to the families of service members killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. He tried to write to every family. He kept all the responses - but, he said, he had not read any of them. Not yet. Maybe someday.
.@RepWalterJones was the most earnest member of Congress I had the privilege of interviewing. No other member struggled more openly with their responsibilities, actions, and the consequences thereof. When we first talked in 2008, he showed me boxes of letters in his office.
