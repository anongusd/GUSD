Giant wall sitting at 3.089 XRP Ripple
MACD curling up on the 30 min/60min charts. XRP may hit new highs before midnight CST. #ripple recovered like a champ

@chadkennedy98 Hopefully 20 more. the 560 by end of 2018 is the most promising number I see
@chadkennedy98 Honestly Im not sure where that 62 is. Maybe those were contracts not signed yet and not in the math. that would be 42 unaccounted for?

@gavosworld for sure. The sonderjyske will cover it, but annoying to say the least
@gavosworld I took the risk with Eintracht too.. two terrible teams. I went with the Home town. I only saw 1 goal in this game so Im worried
Sonderjykse pen
Eintracht concede but Viborg get a red card, glass still half full
Sonderjyske also -142 dnb
Eintracht -142 dnb could play nicely
On to Denmark ....
22 shots, 0 goals	i thought we were cool guys
Just waiting on you Yarmouk... I hate when the better side, at home, cant put up one goal
Whoa Brasov goal while down a man
Brasov really trying to get a second RC before HT
One of these days eh? 	24' : bet on brasov	25' : red card Brasov
@gavosworld I think I would take the cash-out option if 5D had one like bet365
Gonna need the Steelers this weekend. https://t.co/BoGpPk1KsR
@ThePME dont you andercurse this parlay
I love when a hedge pays 3x more than my original bet or I would be super pissed at that 94 minute death goal.
@gavosworld Last week I missed an 18k payout because the eagles lost by 1 and the bears lost by 6 and not 5. Ill tickle in some College ovrs
Im going to study these nfl lines for a monster parlay card... just kidding... Distracted by Narcos.
@FutballTweets Love Drogba
RT @WeLoveBettingUK: ‚õîÔ∏è RED CARD ALERT ‚õîÔ∏è		In 5 of the last 9 top-flight meetings between Stoke and Sunderland, a red card has been brandis‚Ä¶
...that feeling when you mean to make a  2-figure bet but add on an extra zero and it becomes a scary 45 minutes til that 3-figure bet hits
Al Shabab can hold this draw with less than 10 minutes left?
Al Shabab Red Card	That hurts
2 minutes into the 2H ? thats all it took to get my hopes up eh
If Al Shabab hold this lead I wont ask anything else of the betting gods today
RT @Cubs: #FlyTheW everywhere. https://t.co/NYpOEMOrCb
Wake up @draftkings I know it feels like autumn but the golf seaason just started and your site is not scoring it live.
Please make this penalty Shabab
@gavosworld I know nothing of tennis outside of the basic scoring, it's like a foreign language.
@gavosworld hmmm. very convenient Id say
Unreal, just unreal. 89 minute miracle
Santos ugly but aguila very nice
damn can i get a goal and not get one conceded right away after
Valladolid YES
Santos DNB +106	Already beat Gremio 2-0 a few weeks ago, look strong to start this game as well
Valladolid just holding possession with no shots.. Let's get up 1-0 then be boring
so much action today
Guess I got too excited. All games currently level and pushing :(
@PropBettor And cough up the lead after just 4 minutes
Cordoba score!
things looking up
Sparta Prague women Red Card!
Albacete sore a man down!
3 away teams on the card... lets go visitors
58th minute: place bet on Albacete	59th minute: Albacete Red Card
Al Ittihad comes through. Excellent
"Calculating the odds that this stays under 6.5 runs" ..... fuck
Grandpa Rossy @D_Ross3 Cheering me up! Lets go Cubbies get back in this
@Cubs Come on Heyward,how about not striking out
@gavosworld this is why I love In-Play betting. I get to see how they are playing, makes for easier underdog picks.
@gavosworld experts are rarely experts really
@gavosworld outside of the guys I follow, i search all over based on a game by game basis. I like to get various points of view.
@PropBettor swing and a miss
1 minute into 2H, Argentina get a penalty shot
@gavosworld Im 95% live bettor but I was reading all the experts say it would be a draw so I sided with Para
@gavosworld I got Paraguay +1.5 pre match, Then Argentina -1.5 after they scored, so either way Im coming out plus money
"blue you suck" Never heard that chant at a game. Well deserved though
@RedTipster no kidding. I had 2-0 3-0 props. what a mess
@gavosworld Yeah, Ill take my 1/2 unit profit on the day and be on my way. Gonna watch some Narcos then hit the brewery. til tomorrow..
@PropBettor oh, disallowed.. that would have been the icing
lol Italy takes the lead
@PropBettor on top of that Spain took the foot off the gas.. in the last 30 minutes since goal : zero shot attempts
@PropBettor and by the way thats their only shot on target in 80 minutes
Italy penalty	Again with the penalties against me...
Costa off before he gets a Red Card, good idea
@fredonair Yes.
@gavosworld I havnt seen any coverage on that game but the stats say Iceland can pull it off
@gavosworld Iceland need a miracle
Spain 1-0 (Vitolo)
@gavosworld 9 corners so far.. waiting for Silva to wrap one of these close enough for a tap in
@gavosworld Im watching at work. Slow day
@PropBettor Predicting a Costa goal
Spain ML is +106	Ill take that price
oh Werder Bremen scored. Take my refund and get outta there
@gavosworld Id lay off it, they dont seem to be interested in this match
I must be a glutton for punishment getting on these Club Friendly plays
@gavosworld Whats the line at, I dont see it live at 5D or 365? Im tempted to even go Draw No bet on  Werder at +300
With 30% possession and 1 shot through 40 minutes, St. Pauli take the lead. what the fuck man
92 minute penalty goal... usual stuff
@TannerSlays is your mom Rachel Ray?
@fredonair AvocadoJungleFuzz
z
@PropBettor Termalica to make it 5
What is going on? 1 win 4 pushes... 4
If PDRM equalize in stoppage time Im going to throw my computer out my window
2 picks, 2 pushes. Lame start
Baderan looking dominant still, so expect a penalty against them
Chongqing a push but shoulda been a win. Penalty took our profit
@PropBettor If I could make bets on if there would be a penalty scored on a team I bet on during a live contest, Id be a millionaire
@PropBettor Chongqing up 1-0
Baderan &amp; Chongqing lines may pay off this morning
Need a Barca win... how did they let Madrid back in this
@ThePME vereen &amp; hill if I was forced to I guess
I waited too long on Persepolis.. they already scored. knew that was coming
what a bs turnover goal
son of a bitch
Pandev should have a goal by now
Keeping an eye on the Sepahan Persepolis game. Persepolis could see value, Ill wait to see how they come out after HT
@VegasRefund yes sir, making parlays very valuable
I purged everyone i follow that posted anything related to "brangelina"
@gavosworld Cup games are never where they should be
Akademija Pandev	Draw No Bet (-114)
Tampines push. boring start to the day
Gimnastic with a missed penalty, but Im still getting on that DNB line
I could go for another Ajaccio goal, but ill take the push
odds for Chelsea ML with 5 min left are +500 ... should I put a tiny bit on that
@PropBettor So lucky. Didnt deserve the win, but Ive lost enough close calls to get one back
@jaxx_io @AppStore Also, on September 19th you tweeted "ios10 problems resolved" How silly of me to think there was still an issue
@jaxx_io @AppStore Its not stated on your website, and if it is its not on the front page, OR when you click on ios download OR in support

@gavosworld been on cittadella for weeks making cash but they shitting the bed today
@gavosworld unreal
fking penalty
I regret every bet I placed on Cittadella and nothing is losing. I thought they would get their shit together for the second half but no
So many games, but lots of junk		Cittadella Draw No Bet -124 	and a little ML action too
Esbjerg getting some momentum. Not what I want to see. Need a silkeborg goal

Fortuna Dusseldorf -2 line is -127 Feels like a trap but I dont see Bochum scoring, so worst case should be a push
Late penalty to make me sweat this finish out
@gavosworld Ive got hit twice today on goals coming too quickly and not getting bets in, but cant complain

@truelogic01 @BrutalAtheist You said that was they were an Atheist society. Do some research first before you call an entire country Atheist
@truelogic01 @BrutalAtheist Are you saying that only Atheists are? "lol"
@truelogic01 @BrutalAtheist And those roots in cuba come from.. wait for it.. Christianity
@truelogic01 @BrutalAtheist Also, Russia is Orthodox Christian. Albania is Islamic,  China is Taoism, Cuba is Santeria/Yoruba.
@truelogic01 @BrutalAtheist "Atheist society" you say that like we need a label. Countries that accept us are plentiful. See Europe.
@truelogic01 @BrutalAtheist Hmm If we judge a group by it's worst offenders I'd say religion has far more to own up to. You must be so proud

@SPBetting1 How you feel about Napoli today?
Sociedad -1.5 at +130
Won a nice Ashton VSG from my Tottenham loving bro in law. Easiest bet I've made all week
@quitman04 looks like a solid bet. I might have to play the 1-0 outcome. China playing hard and Germany slacking. Hope they get a lecture
Use the whole pitch Germany, same side every time firing 30 yard shots over the goal wont help either
That should have been a penalty kick to Germany
@quitman04 I know, I went back and forth.. I'm sure it will toy with my emotions for the full 90
@quitman04 I put a prop bet down for 4-0. However, last time these two played it ended up 1-0, but that was 2 years ago.
Germany(w) -2.5 		China no goals last 5 meetings, Germany a powerhouse in the group. Defense very strong. Let's get some goals ladies!
USA women killing me. missed penalty then concede... Hope the over hits to smooth a little

Kazan killing my hopes of a salzburg/kazan parlay win... nice red card you little shit
Napoli better stop screwing around
quite boring unless you're a fan of Fiorentina

Let's go Genk, this game is boring
@PropBettor Cash It $$$
I wish I could have made a move on Honka +300 for 5th team goal... I wimped out and they drilled one

@PropBettor not looking good. 0-0 HT.
Hajduk / Udinese O2.5		Let's start the morning out right boys
Alajuelense back in action after a fight in the crowd postponed the game yesterday
Just a heads up incase you havn't heard: Game restarts in 2-1/2hrs. That makes it less than 24 hours. bets should still be live.
It's a no-loss day. Metz PK is the only push right now, playing against 10 men. Let's get a goal boys!
Lyon looked tempting, glad I stayed away. Wide open nets, should have been 4-0 not 1-1

NHL (MIN @ OTT) 	Total shots on goal	Jason Pominville  	O3(-115)

@M_MLaver true, but I was saying "it's the Jets" just two weeks ago. you are right about the success in a dome though.
@M_MLaver I think only NO is in danger of not covering. Been a monster at home. Away has been trouble for them
