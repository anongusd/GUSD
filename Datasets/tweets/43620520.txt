@dbongino Northam took the mask off and disrobed, like Ginsburg 2009. “At the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't want too many of”...”and Roe would set up Medicaid abortion funding.” Northam now a liability.

@jeremymulder3 @keithboykin A better example, leftists believe global warming is an imminent threat. Fact is there are not 1500 murders a year and 300 drug overdoses a week to show from global warming. And most of US is tired of absurde GW predictions. So that's a no go to.
@jeremymulder3 @keithboykin Lets be serious. Dems have done essentially this in the US. Obama did this with DACA. He just didn't call it a national emergency. Gun ownership is a constitutional right, so not happening. Healthcare has no immediate fix. Not happening either.

@WildChild69 @sarah_siskin @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Guess you guys are unfamiliar with prolife OB Gyns. There are many, though not nearly as many as support abortion. They have to be less vocal in order to be tolerated and not crushed by the increasingly tyrannical abortion crowd.
@WildChild69 @sarah_siskin @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Per CDC in 2015, 1.3% of abortions &gt; 21 weeks. That's over 8000. dismembered babies. And you are in the club that is more worried about bears riding bicycles?
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder A prolife OB GYN doesn't hide behind the language which lets you sleep at night.
@WildChild69 @sarah_siskin @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder It is killing an innocent human being. What do you call dismembering ripping an infant of any age from a mother's womb?
@WildChild69 @sarah_siskin @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Hmmm...well you run with a disingenuous crowd then.

@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Supporting a decision to take an innocent life with no threat to the mother's life is not my job.
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Only subjective for those who have no morals.
@sarah_siskin @WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Why not? Isn't it a right at 34...or 32...or 28 weeks?
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder So if the choice is kill a baby or have the baby, which is more ethical? You find comfort in not recognizing a living being as being a life, or human. Sorry for you.
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Nor you.
@sarah_siskin @WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder First, when discussing morality regarding life, why would that matter? Second, the pic is clear. Either I am a hideous looking woman or a fair looking dude. Though if I identified as female today would that make my opinion more meaningful?
@sarah_siskin @WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Not when they are infected with KCL and ripped from the womb. So is that OK if a mom desires it at 34 weeks?
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder When your primary goal is kill the baby it ain't healthcare. Sorry.

@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Problem is that much more commonly situations are identified as "life threatening" with the primary intention of the abortion being end the pregnancy. Abortions for "the health of the mother" are immoral.
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder What you describe is rare and invokes double effect. If it's a real choice between the life of the baby or the mother, the intention is to end sepsis not kill the baby, and two grave matters are recognized and weighed, delivering even a baby that will die is ethical.
@sarah_siskin @Cholland2000 @WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder I think so.
@WildChild69 @sarah_siskin @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Are you saying 34 week infants are not aborted? What is it when a 34 week pregnancy is terminated? Yes let's discuss reality.
@WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Hmmm...the usual rare straw man. That is not the ethical conundrum for me. It rarely happens. What happens commonly is docs saying a condition threatens a mother's life in order to permit an abortion.
Seems reasonable. https://t.co/EUnnnZyrIL
An end could be put to much of the D.C. madness if @realDonaldTrump ordered release of declassified, unredacted FISA warrant applications, and "Gang of 8" documents which he has promised to do on numerous occasions. Why has Trump not unleashed the hounds?

@WildChild69 @sarah_siskin @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Does a 34 week unborn infant have a right to life or does the mother decide that?
@sarah_siskin @WildChild69 @terib3294 @Lynn_Rose1 @Cholland2000 @jeek8str @dove_esq @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder I look at the "right" to kill a baby as not a right.

@clarissamehler So a non illegal method potentially exists. If so those are the bombs that need to be unleashed. Trump stated Bob 22, 2016 he wouldn't pursue Hillary though. Why? He ran on the wall and lock her up. We are waiting.
@clarissamehler Why has Trump notation unleashed the hounds on the Clinton crime family re breaking bational security acts and collusion with Russia? Where is the Clinton special prosecutor? This would be ugly and determined but legal. Why gas it not happened?
@ByronYork @MelissaTweets No, except in the sense of continued the McCain legacy of non-compete for the Presidency. Mainly Romney fills Flake's role of anti-Trump failed also ran who has an eye on a RINO challenge in 2020.
@clarissamehler The answer is to be viciously honest and attack these people as Trump described in his campaign. Why is he not? That is the big question.
@clarissamehler No need to be dirty. Theee would appear to be quick remedies here. Why does Trump not declassify all FISA related documents, everything? Trump was sending Hillary to jail. What happened there?
@clarissamehler @dbongino The opposition party to the Dems has a taller task. We have minimal media support and have lost most of academia to indoctrinating leftists.

@KekistaniDan @Liedrian_1337 @dove_esq @Cholland2000 @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder This is the misconstruing of Jefferson's metaphor. Separation and wall are not in the Establishment clause. The clause is one way and simply limits the civil government from impeding religious practice or establishing a state religion. This is not separation.
@KekistaniDan @Cholland2000 @Liedrian_1337 @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder @KamalaHarris Wrong on multiple counts. First there are Christians who are Masons. I know a 32nd degree Baptist Mason. Second, few of the Founders were pure Masons or desire for that matter. John Jay, Sam Adams and Patrick Henry were clear Christians. The rest were a deist/Christian mix.
@KekistaniDan @Cholland2000 @Liedrian_1337 @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder @KamalaHarris History sucks for you then. We can debate Christianity vs deism but the Founders believed in God, and many were Christian They clearly stated there would be no national religion but without Christian culture there would have been no USA. Debate.
@KekistaniDan @Liedrian_1337 @dove_esq @Cholland2000 @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder So where is the word separation? Appreciate you may wish to substitute that word but it isn't stated is it?
@KekistaniDan @Cholland2000 @Liedrian_1337 @dove_esq @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Not being able to suppress religion or establish a state religion does not equate to separation. And the assertion seemingly was "separation" means that no rights are God given. The Founders stated otherwise clearly in the Declaration.
@KekistaniDan @Liedrian_1337 @dove_esq @Cholland2000 @sarah_siskin @SheriffClarke @KurtSchlichter @tamaraholder Yeah...do you see separation there?

@crimsonpostgrad @awesome_kittie @approfre @feelmyserena @Ocasio2018 She does care. It was a key part of her campaign and now she calls herself Alex from the Bronx.
@feelmyserena @approfre @Ocasio2018 She spent 5 years as a small child in Parkchester. That is a nice area of the Bronx. Then moved to Westchester. She doesn't live now in the Bronx. She is desparately attempting to create an image which is fiction.

@ezzie67_linda @AlietaEck The Great Society is a great bust. Trillions spent and what we have is decimated black families, horrid inner city and rural public education, high crime, rampant drug culture.  The worst health stats are in these areas.
@ezzie67_linda @AlietaEck The answer re drugs is reasonable smart regulation but not more regulation. Regulation contributed massively to the opioid/substance abuse epidemic. Making pain a "5th" vital sign (regulators like JC, state boards and VA) in the 1990s opened the door for the epidemic.
@ezzie67_linda @AlietaEck There are two sides to this, but I don't totally disagree. The fact is though that bringing a drug through the FDA process costs lots of money. And FDA regulations make continued production difficult. So we run out of basic drugs and electrolytes regularly now.
@ezzie67_linda @AlietaEck Progressive social policies have destroyed families and education, especially for minorities, over 60 years. Single parent homes have enormous health impacts which will not be reversed until there is a reckoning with a devastated culture.
@ezzie67_linda @AlietaEck The governement will never be able to run a reasonable healthcare system. The NHS is broke, there is terrible access and the quality is disturbing. Look it up. I have seen it firsthand. As for "coverage", means nothing if you have no access.

@gregmaletic He got his intel from RU. Reportedly from Steele.
@gregmaletic Wow. First off why did she need a private server? Hmmm. More important, even if she was just an incompetent dumbass, that intel over years had potential or did compromise many. It is very possible this is source for PRC elimination of intel assets.  https://t.co/fRWgcUDcXq
@gregmaletic So you believe Cohen would not lie to get a plea deal? Are you kidding?
@gregmaletic And as for dealing with foreign enemies, Clinton bought the Steele Dossier from Russia via a middleman. Just sayin'.
@gregmaletic To build a building when he is still a businessman and not a POTUS candidate? We'll have to disagree. As ex-military I wasn't a Fed Official throwing TS on a private server indicted.
@gregmaletic My point is this dude is lying on his own behalf. And this is nowhere near what the SC mandate was. And it is a double standard compared to Clintons.
@gregmaletic You seem actually reasonable...not that you need that from me...but honestly Clinton never actually investigated. No records of her interviews, off the record, and we know many facts. She violated Nat Sec law.
@gregmaletic The President is not required to comment publicly on Cohen testimony. And why would he, Cohen has changed his stories several times and is admitted as a liar. And re the tower thing, lets say all these conversations happened, so what? Seriously, how does that tie to any fixing?
@gregmaletic Honestly...has she been investigated like Flynn?
@gregmaletic Read the law my friend...nothing about intentional. Sorry. They elected not to proceed with proper legal action.
@gregmaletic If you were truly concerned about breaking the law and endangering the country, you might read up on 1.) 18 U.S. Code § 793 – Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information 18 U.S. Code § 798 – Disclosure of classified information. But you are not are you?
@gregmaletic So lying Cohen telling lies...that's your foundation. And again even if...not going to happen. Next.
@gregmaletic So not illegal (see you use likely), NDA not illegal. Next? And about the server?
Please House Dems impeach Trump! His approval at 49%. Clinton was 61% pre-impeachment, 73% post. Imagine what Trump would be at after loathsome Pelosi, Schiff and Waters lead trial of a POTUS with record unemployment, wage growth and energy independence. https://t.co/7xZDBYXEhQ

@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex Opportunity lost. The question is why? You may be content to offer an easy alibi, we'll disagree. The Pope's visit in August is now reduced to paying respects to the now dead Catholic Church in Ireland. On life support pre-vote, all support now withdrawn.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex Wrong. I see the Pope as a celebrity, willing to work with those seeking radical (imo unacceptable) transformation in the Church. Barely Catholics would listen to this wildly celebrated celebrity Pope who gets the leftist agenda, but makes the case that he has to stand for life.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex Hmmm...The Church germinated in an environment where it was hated.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex Sorry Larry. With God and willing servants everything is possible. This Pipe is loved by progressives and gas a chance to change thus outcome. Yes. The cock has crowed.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex Excuse me Larry but the Church was gared wasn't it. Did Jesus ever say stay out of the game until you will be loved for speaking truth? Missed that in the gospels. I' lol read up tonight.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex We'll never know will we because he followed your plan and abandoned the field. Well he never took the field. And now 5000 Irish babies, at least, a year will be aborted. Assuming Ireland only aspires to a 10% abortion rate and not the 25%  rate we experience in the US.

@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex So your strategy worked well. Thanks. Again, we'll disagree.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex Spent several weeks there working this issue and we will respectfully disagree. This is a Pope loved by progressives, which is a problem, but he had an opportunity in Ireland. You supply the excuse he no doubt will use as cover when he offers indulgences to Ireland in August.
@LarryBrindisi @Pontifex It couldn't have been worse. Sorry. And this Pope is not perceived as Benedict. His celebrity status would have given him enormous opprtunity. He abandoned the field in Ireland.

Ireland is 75% Catholic, holds a referendum on abortion and Pope Francis never shows up?! @Pontifex never even offers a public prayer for the Irish to muster the courage to swim against the culture of death tide. He visits Ireland in August. Why? The Church there died May 25th.

@jenoconnell If you value women having more preterm births, mental health issues and breast cancer, abortion is the ticket. And if freedom means license to abort 5,000 or so of Ireland's most vulnerable tiny humans, repealing the 8th kills many with one stone. @john_mcguirk https://t.co/Vb1xeR1ZTc

@annapr @PhelanVicky @Toibin1 The risk for a future preterm birthincreases by 36% after one abortion. The US has a 10% preterm birth rate. We do 1M abortions a year. Ireland's preterm rate is half that. Do you want a preterm birth epidemic?
@annapr @PhelanVicky @Toibin1 1 in 9 women in the US will get breast cancer. Evidence shows a clear association with prior abortion. If such data existed for bananas our Surgeon General would have warning labels all over them for women. Save the Eighth if you care about the health of Iriish women.

@amonster5412 @MTalisker18 So you have never experienced NHS care?

@amonster5412 @MTalisker18 Like maybe South Korea, all of Europe, Taiwan, Grenada.
@amonster5412 @MTalisker18 Where do you live and what healthcare systems have you obtained care in. Have you experienced the NHS?
@amonster5412 @MTalisker18 Well if you want to include abortion and eugenics in with standard progressive tactics, we could probably push 1B.
