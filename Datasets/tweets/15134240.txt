.@NIHDirector on the Hill: In closing, I am proud to lead #NIH at this time of unprecedented scientific opportunity. The resources you have entrusted to us will be used to bring hope to untold numbers of patients &amp; their families here at the National Institutes of Hope.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: 100% of the kids who got the highest dose of gene therapy were alive at 20 months. Nearly all could talk &amp; feed themselves. And some, like little Evelyn Villarreal, shown here in a video taken two months ago, could talk, walk and even do push-ups! #NIH https://t.co/m9oglIkKml
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: One of the most exciting comes from Jerry Mendell’s team at @nationwidekids, which tested gene therapy in 15 infants w/severe SMA. They infused a viral vector, designed to deliver the normal gene to the spinal cord. Something dramatic happened. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: So, #NIH supported more research, working closely with patient advocates and industry to move promising leads into therapeutic development.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: 10+ yrs ago, #NIH launched a project on Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) a tragic, inherited disease. In severe form, it leaves babies “floppy.” Nearly all die by 15 months. 10 yrs ago, there was no Tx but we had just discovered DNA mutations causing it https://t.co/e3tIrB3k1Z
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: And, now, on to my favorite: Scientific Inspiration. I can assure you that researchers funded by #NIH come to work every day full of innovative ideas and the wherewithal to see those ideas through. Let me share just one example.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Take the case of immunotherapy &amp; gene therapy involving removing cells from a patient, re-engineering those cells &amp; then returning them to the patient. Many labs can’t handle these highly individualized processes, so it’s crucial we make upgrades. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: To realize the full potential of these and other resources, we must develop New Technologies and Facilities. Quite often, technology drives the need for equally innovative facilities.  #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: On May 6th, #NIH @AllofUsReseach began enrolling 1 million people living in the United States. So far, we have about 100,000 volunteers… nearly half from communities historically underrepresented in medical research.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: For example, #BRAINInitiative, supported through #CuresNow, has created new imaging tools that are churning out troves of amazing data. And there’s also data generated by structural biology and microbiome research, and #NIH @AllofUsResearch
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: The third key to success is Computational Power. Biomedical research has been transformed by the recent explosion in computing power—and all of the #NIH #BigData it’s generating.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: A Vibrant Workforce is the 2nd key to success. Success lies in boosting the number of #NIH grants AND increasing the number of creative minds receiving those grants. So, we are using new metrics to evaluate success, shown in this chart below. https://t.co/vSRZjZgCBj
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: The good news is, thanks to you, early-stage researchers are beginning to see a Stable Trajectory of Support, reversing a decade decline in #NIH’s purchasing power. #CuresNow ($4.8B over 10 years for 4 signature initiatives) is a critical part.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I believe the answers could lie in The Five Keys to Success in Science Today: “Stable Trajectory of Support,” “Vibrant Workforce,” “Computational Power,” “New Technologies and Facilities,” and perhaps most important of all, “Scientific Inspiration” #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I spend a lot of time w/early-stage researchers. Wherever I go, I set aside time to hear directly from them. It is critical that we foster the next generation of discovery &amp; remain the world leader in biomedical innovation. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: But, just like in sports, it takes more than a good defense to win at science -it also takes a strong and talented offense. So, I’d like to focus on 21st Century Cures Act (#CuresNow) and other proactive ways we’re bolstering #NIH’s tradition of success
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: The US biomedical enterprise is the envy of the world for the excellence of our discovery &amp; innovation. This is possible because a vast majority of #NIH grantees, US &amp; foreign-born, are honest &amp; working hard to advance knowledge that benefits us all.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: To help address this challenge, I am creating a working group of my Advisory Committee to the Director. Learn more from the #NIH Director’s statement: https://t.co/e4d3dZuz2t
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Thank you for asking me to speak on the issue of protecting the integrity of US biomedical research from undue foreign influence. #NIH research is built on the bedrock principles of scientific excellence, unassailable integrity, and fair competition.

Here's the updated link to @NIHDirector's written statement for the #CuresNow implementation hearing: https://t.co/cPQO3Rxr9y
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: This progress, along with many other advances in biomedical research, is being made possible because of you and your colleagues’ vision &amp; investment in #CuresNow. We couldn’t do it without you! #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: In 2019, we aim to open a secure portal to give researchers access to @AllofUsResearch data in a de-identified format.  With every person new enrolled, the data will hold more promise for advancing human health. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Of those enrolled in @AllofUsResearch, almost half are from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Right now, anyone 18+ are eligible to join.  We will begin enrolling children next year.  #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: #NIH @AllofUsResearch will enroll 1M+ Americans from all walks of life. We’re off to a strong start. Nat'l enrollment launched 5/6 &amp; reached 10K+ ppl at 7 community events &amp; ~4x that online. As of last week, 86K+ ppl volunteered https://t.co/XB8X8t8MPL
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Figuring out what health approaches work best for each individual and why is another goal of Cures Innovation Fund via #PrecisionMedicine Initiative. The centerpiece of this initiative, @AllofUsResearch. #NIH https://t.co/IuqeiDejM7
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: ~70% of such women will not benefit from chemo. Elimination of chemo’s potentially toxic side effects when it's not necessary is very desirable. Added bonus for our health care system-cutting the need for chemo yields significant savings, ~$1B a yr #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: #NIH is advancing cancer care. An #NIHfunded #clinicaltrial illustrated progress in this area: TAILORx, which uses a genomic test of tumor issue to determine if women with breast cancer will benefit from chemo post-surgery: https://t.co/QSDW3hF9YQ
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I must counsel patience–this immunotherapy success story for solid tumors involves very few cases right now, and it must be replicated in further studies. But, without doubt, this one woman’s life-saving experience represents hope for millions more #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: This new approach led to a complete regression, most likely a cure, of widely metastatic breast cancer in a woman with aggressive, difficult to treat, previously universally fatal form of the disease. #NIH https://t.co/I9751UVUXk
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: But other cancers, esp. “solid tumors,” seem to be less responsive.  I am thrilled to tell you some of those barriers seem ready to come down.  Last month, #NIH @theNCI’s Dr. Rosenberg &amp; team announced a novel modification of the immunotherapy approach.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: #CancerMoonshot is pursuing an ambitious goal: to accelerate advances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment &amp; care. Advances like immunotherapy, where after yrs of #NIHfunded research, we're seeing cures of some cancers #NIH https://t.co/6cJYPa07RK

.@NIHDirector on the Hill: As Peter Levi said, “Hope in every sphere of life is a privilege that attaches to action. No action, no hope.” #NIH’s actions support some of the best PIs to apply the best science to find answers for the millions waiting for their hopes to be realized
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I am proud to lead #NIH at this time of unprecedented scientific opportunity and strong support, which brings hope to untold numbers of patients and their families.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: As a direct result of an #NIH-inspired effort, we are seeing the emergence of a life-saving gene therapy for SMA.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: One exciting advancement comes from Jerry Mendell’s team at @nationwidekids, who tested gene therapy in 15 infants w/severe SMA. 100% of the infants who got the highest dose were alive at 20 months. Some, like Matteo here, were able to walk. #NIH https://t.co/7bBmTZl8Sb
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Researchers had just discovered the DNA mutations that cause SMA. So, #NIH supported more research, working closely with patient advocates and industry to move promising leads into therapeutic development.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: One example: Over 10 yrs ago, #NIH launched a project on Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a uniformly fatal, inherited disease without a treatment. Death by 15 months was the tragic result. https://t.co/LtpkIJ5M3d
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: My favorite: Scientific Inspiration. I can assure you that #NIH-funded researchers come to work every day full of innovative ideas and the wherewithal to see those ideas through.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: For example: immunotherapy and gene therapies. Many involve removing cells from a patient’s body, re-engineering those cells and returning them to the patient. Many labs can’t handle these processes. It’s crucial we make upgrades to keep pace. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: To realize the full potential of these and other resources, we must develop New Technologies and Facilities. Quite often, it’s the technology itself driving the need for equally innovative facilities. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: For example, #BRAINI has created new imaging tools producing troves of data. There’s data generated by structural biology &amp; microbiome research, &amp; @AllofUsResearch launched last week to enroll 1M+ people in a cohort study to shape the future of health
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: The third key to success is Computational Power. Biomedical research has been transformed by the recent explosion in computing power &amp; the “Big Data” it’s generating. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Success isn’t just the number of grants; we must increase the number of creative minds doing science. So, we’re using a new metric to evaluate success. This graph shows the number of investigators supported by #NIH, which is once again growing nicely. https://t.co/3eVRFKdEIp
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Thanks to Congress, early-stage researchers are now beginning to see a Stable Trajectory of #NIH Support. Strong, stable public support lies at the heart of science, and is absolutely vital to our second key to success: a Vibrant Workforce.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: The answer may lie in what I call The Five Keys to Success in Science Today: “Stable Trajectory of Support,” Vibrant Workforce,” “Computational Power,” “New Technologies and Facilities,” &amp; perhaps most important, “Scientific Inspiration”. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: We spend a lot of time with early-stage researchers, listening to their ideas and concerns. Now is a good time to ask: what are we doing to foster the next generation of discovery and how do we remain the world leader in biomedical innovation? #NIH

"Inequities &amp; biases in the arts &amp; sciences persist, including fair access for women…who too often still find themselves overlooked and underrepresented. A bias I ran head-on into when I made Yentl. It mobilized my commitment to women’s equality." @BarbraStreisand #StreisandInDC

From poet Peter Levi: “Hope in every sphere of life is a privilege that attaches to action. No action, no hope.” At #NIH, our idea of action is to support the best investigators to apply the best science to find answers for the millions waiting for their hopes to be realized.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I am proud to lead #NIH at this time of unprecedented scientific opportunity and strong Congressional support. The resources entrusted to us will be used to bring hope to untold numbers of patients and their families. I’d like to close with a quote.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: As a direct result of an #NIH-inspired effort, we hopefully now have a life-saving gene therapy on the way for #spinalmuscularatrophy . #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Yet, just like little Matteo Almeida, 100 percent of infants who got the highest dose of Mendell’s gene therapy were alive at 20 months. Nearly all could talk &amp; eat on their own. And some, like Matteo, were able to walk &amp; even play on monkey bars. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: One of the most exciting treatments is from Jerry Mendell’s team @nationwidekids. They recently tested gene therapy in 15 infants with severe #spinalmuscularatrophy. Usually, such kids die before the age of 15 months. #NIH
10 years ago, there was no treatment for #spinalmuscularatrophy, but researchers had just discovered the DNA mutations that cause it. So, #NIH supported more research, working closely with patient advocates and industry to move promising leads into therapeutic development.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: More than a decade ago, #NIH launched a special project on #spinalmuscularatrophy, a rare and tragically fatal, inherited disease. In its most severe form, it leaves babies unable to hold their heads up, feed well and, eventually, even to breathe.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: My personal favorite key area is scientific inspiration. #NIH-funded researchers come to work every day full of innovative ideas and the wherewithal to see those ideas through. I could talk about this all day – but, let me share just one example.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Treatments such as immunotherapy &amp; gene therapy involve removing cells from a patient’s body, re-engineering those cells, and returning them to the patient. Many labs can’t handle these highly individualized processes; it’s crucial that we upgrade. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: To realize the full potential of these and other resources, we must develop new technologies and facilities. Quite often, it’s the technology itself driving the need for equally innovative facilities. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: There’s #bigdata generated by structural biology, genome research, and @AllofUsResearch Program. #JoinAllofUs will soon start enrolling 1M Americans, producing troves of data on how differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology can influence health
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Like so much else, biomedical research has been transformed by the recent explosion in computing power—and by all the #bigdata it’s generating. #BRAINI has created new imaging tools that are churning out troves of amazing data. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: To evaluate success, we look at trends in the number of individual principal investigators supported by #NIH over the past 15 years. That number is growing, and there's a surge around 2016, which reflects when the current trajectory of NIH support began
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Strong, stable public support lies at the heart of #NIH science, and is absolutely vital to a vibrant workforce. Success cannot lie in just boosting the number of grants made; it must also include increasing the number of creative minds receiving grants
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: Early-stage researchers are now beginning to see a stable trajectory of support. Congress' work over the last 3 years is helping us begin to reverse a decade-long decline in #NIH’s purchasing power for research, which touches every state of the union.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I believe the answers could be in certain key areas that we call “The Five Keys to Success in Science Today”. A stable trajectory of support, a vibrant workforce, computational power, new technologies and facilities, and scientific inspiration. #NIH
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: As you begin to consider the FY19 request, it’s a good time to think about early-stage researchers, &amp; ask what are we doing to foster the next generation of discovery? What can we do to help our nation remain the world leader in biomedical innovation?
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: I spend a lot of time with early-stage researchers, to hear about their dreams, their ideas, and their concerns. I know you (the subcommittee), too, have met many of them in your home districts and on your visits to #NIH.
.@NIHDirector on the Hill: To the Subcommittee, thank you for once again going above and beyond in your support of #NIH research and the patients for whom it brings healing and hope.

A6: Light therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for SAD since the 1980s. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the diminished sunshine of the fall and winter months using daily exposure to bright, artificial light. #NIMHchats https://t.co/Csvh2ZNrtb
A5: Here are some of the current #clinicaltrials for SAD. See if one is right for you: https://t.co/Cx3IlrPY7e #NIMHchats
A5: There are four main treatments for SAD: medication, light therapy, psychotherapy, and vitamin D. These may be used alone or in combination. #NIMHchats https://t.co/O1ZBQqQrK1
A4: The causes of SAD are unknown, but research has found some biological clues. People with SAD may have trouble regulating one of the key neurotransmitters involved in mood, serotonin; may overproduce the hormone melatonin; or may produce less Vitamin D #NIMHchats https://t.co/b7ubAlu9bU
A3: Attributes that may increase your risk of SAD include: being younger or female, living far from the equator, family history, having depression or bipolar disorder #NIMHchats https://t.co/9qYtZClKQr
A2: Symptoms of the less frequently occurring summer seasonal affective disorder include: poor appetite with associated weight loss, insomnia, agitation, restlessness, anxiety, episodes of violent behavior #NIMHchats
A2: Symptoms of the Winter Pattern of SAD include: having low energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, craving for carbohydrates, and social withdrawal (feel like “hibernating”) #NIMHchats
A2: Symptoms of SAD: feeling depressed, hopeless/worthless; having low energy, difficulty concentrating, problems w/sleep, or frequent thoughts of death or suicide; losing interest in usual activities; changes in appetite or weight; feeling sluggish/agitated #NIMHchats https://t.co/vvO2tGhw0W
A1: To be diagnosed with SAD, people must meet full criteria for major depression coinciding with specific seasons (appearing in the winter or summer months) for at least 2 years. Seasonal depressions must be much more frequent than any non-seasonal depressions. #NIMHchats
A1: Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons, typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. Depressive episodes linked to the summer can occur, but are less common #NIMHchats https://t.co/CSL5poJdyS

@NIHDirector @NIDAnews @US_FDA .@NIHDirector on the Hill: There is a great deal to be done and many research opportunities for scientific solutions to help end the opioids crisis. To succeed, we need all hands on deck to help end this terrible epidemic. #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews @US_FDA .@NIHDirector on the Hill: The partnership aims to develop objective measures of pain to compare experimental therapies w/greater precision, &amp; build a new #clinicaltrial network to enable rapid testing of promising new therapies and facilitate the sharing of such data. #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews @US_FDA .@NIHDirector on the Hill: The partnership will build on basic science insights including (1) inhibit pain pathway without activating the reward system; (2) pain meds identified through studies of non-opioid receptor systems; &amp; (3) develop pain biomarkers to predict best Txs #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews @US_FDA .@NIHDirector on the Hill: We’ve recently learned that when molecules bind to an opioid receptor, the pain and reward pathways can be separated. New technology is now being applied to design drugs that inhibit the pain pathway without activating the reward system. #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews @US_FDA .@NIHDirector on the Hill: #NIH, @US_FDA, and PhRMA are working with more than 30 companies to develop a research partnership (1) to expand medication options to treat addiction; (2) to reverse overdose; and (3) develop potent, non-addictive medications for pain.
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews .@NIHDirector on the Hill: Con’t #NIH partnership w/industry is key. Working together, we’ve already developed a naloxone nasal spray as an overdose antidote&amp;last week @US_FDA approved the only once-monthly injectable formulation buprenorphine, a med 1st made in partnership w/NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews .@NIHDirector on the Hill: We need more research to understand which individuals succeed on which medicines with what doses over what time period, combined with which psychosocial support.  We need precision medicine for chronic pain management. #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews .@NIHDirector on the Hill: People have different stories &amp; need different interventions. Research can offer more treatment options &amp; Tammy’s story shows that treatments for addiction can sometimes address the very pain conditions that opioids were intended to treat. #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews .@NIHDirector on the Hill: MAT helped Tammy to stop using opioids while successfully managing her pain from lupus &amp; arthritis w/exercise &amp; anti-inflammatory medications. Tammy credits it with saving her life. #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews #NIH on the Hill: MAT combines medication (methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone) &amp; behavioral therapy https://t.co/FWChspjDiZ #NIH
@NIHDirector @NIDAnews .@NIHDirector on the Hill: Americans like Tammy, 47, from a small town in Oregon, is one of the 25M Americans living w/chronic pain. Her reliance on opioids grew until she sought help in an early #NIH-funded research study on the effectiveness of Med Assisted Treatment (MAT) #NIH
