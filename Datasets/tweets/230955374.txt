@coach_roberts11 @CR Yes, but the travel ban EO targets an already-secured section of our border.
@coach_roberts11 @CR I do not, but this EO is targeting legal immigration through protected *borders
@coach_roberts11 @CR This EO does nothing to protect our civilian and military personnel in Europe.
@coach_roberts11 @CR The issue Germany is having is not an American problem because of the effectiveness of our system. Another reason this EO is unnecessary
