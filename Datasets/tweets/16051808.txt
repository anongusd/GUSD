@aitepaeapaea @realDonaldTrump I'm not suggesting a rule-of-law argument for tough immigration isn't the correct one. I am making the point that the PR battle will be lost by those who focus of details while casually dismissing the tragic visuals of children being separated from parents.
I don't want to hear from the Bushes about immigration policy.
If @realDonaldTrump and conservatives aren't careful, they are going to get checkmated on the immigration issue... even if they're right about securing the border, preventing amnesty, ending the lottery, and implementing a law &amp; order immigration policy.		#MAGA
PRO TIP (for my fellow conservatives): Nuance and rule of law arguments don't work when the other side can credibly demonstrate you support separating children from their parents.		 #MAGA

5. Does the government (the NSA in particular) REALLY want to regulate social media platforms that encourage users to relinquish their privacy and personal data so willingly? No.
4. It is shamefully hypocritical for politicians to lecture anyone on the issue of privacy.
3. Conservatives (especially innovators and business leaders) have failed to LEAD in the arenas of social media and big data. As a result, they are forced to play in Lefty sandboxes (Facebook, Twitter, Google, et al) and hope their values are represented.
Key takeaways from the #ZuckerbergHearing...		1. Facebook (and Big Data in general) should not be trusted to self-regulate. Their business model and the issue of privacy are in direct conflict.		2. Should we trust ill-informed politicians to address our privacy concerns? No.
