P.P.P.P.S. Just got the reminder to check between your toes and on tops of feet. I get a full body skin check twice a year. For the two years after I had skin cancer, a.k.a. ages 17 - 19,  I would get most my of my body photographed by a doc with like 8 awkward med students.

P.P.P.S Also POC are less likely to be diagnosed when they DO have skin cancer and more likely to be diagnosed late, which is dangerous - melanoma can be deadly. Skin cancer is treatable when caught early. Check hands, noses, ears and lips too! Plus your hairline and your scalp.

Guys, I had a v chill form of skin cancer when I was 17 (and then got to be stared at a lot by med students at our local teaching hospital, v nice ppl but do not recommend this.) I go 2x a year to get checked. Get ur 15 min-ish üåû/day, then put on sunscreen/hat &amp; get more!

This is a fucked up story of one man lying about something that may prompt some of your friends who are survivors of this kind of violence to get upset. If they need to talk, let 'em talk and please don't ask them why they didn't call the cops. They may feel betrayed today.
If you have a friend or loved one who talks about their own experience of being harassed, threatened, or beat up - you're probably going to find that individual didn't call the cops. Or if they did, they decided not to pursue it because of fear. Don't push them, but listen.
@RAICESTEXAS Thank YOU! You all work so hard!
I'm always inclined to have suspicion regarding statements from law enforcement with regard to a.) race b.) issues of racially or sexually motivated violence c.) race d.) race e.) race although I also recognize the necessity of good law enforcement and protection BUT. Damn.
I can't believe I'm saying I agree with someone in leadership at Chicago PD, but when Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said "my concern is now hate crimes will be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen" I felt that.
And if you're an individual who does know the man and you believed Jussie, I understand even more. When we love somebody and they've been genuinely good to us, cared for us, even taken care OF us, of course we believe them and stand by them! I feel for his family and friends.
As an individual who doesn't know the man, if you believed Jussie Smollett, I don't think you ought to feel bad about that. It's so rare for somebody to make up something like this, and if you've known folks to whom this kind of abuse has happened, you know it can be real.
At first I believed him because I've had queer friends get jumped or even raped (yes, raped - sometimes with sharp objects) by folks calling them slurs. So this didn't seem at all impossible because it happens all the time. The "MAGA" thing seemed a little on the nose, but...damn https://t.co/GtmFX9aW07

I highly suggest starting your own breakaway church if you're feeing super Catholic but you don't like the fact that you're funding kiddie rape. They have to sell off a lot of their real estate to pay for their defense lawyers so buy an old church and have a good rape-free time.

Does anybody have any questions about my personal feelings about the first four episodes of "Umbrella Academy" and which characters I'd bone? I have a fever so this is really your best time.
22.) "Robot Mom is so hot."	23.) "The tale of 'Robot Mom' is definitely about an older generation of women being trained by powerful men to repress all genuine emotion and that generation is very old now and dealing with aging parents is hard even when they're robots."
20.) "I love this show because every episode is a major superhero big budget action picture that's too short for me to get bored or have to get up and pee and also you get a music video every time!"	21.) "This budget gave somebody a light heart attack."
16.) "The kid is evil."	17.) "I don't think the kid is evil."	18.) "Ohhh the kid is insane."	19.) "Does the kid fuck the mannequin? Will they show it? Prestige TV would show it, it's time to make choices for awards season baybeeee."
@ChristFinnegan @TheBrownBombr87 Ah yes Se√±or Peligroso!
13.) "This show won't win Emmys because there's not enough swears or tits or sexual assaults but it's a great show."	14.) "Everything Ellen Page does is THE PERFECT CHOICE FOR THE MOMENT."	15.) "Ellen Page is doing subtle and believable work OPPOSITE A BRITISH CHIMP BUTLER."
Toronto, ON (Ontario) https://t.co/681TfauYvJ
Once again I nominate myself to be a @netflix social media intern https://t.co/Ttkp3T4DC9
9.) "I'm going to be sad if Mary J. Blige dies. Like in real life but also in this show."	10.) "They're gonna fuck."	11.) "I'll be able to tell how prestige TV they're trying to go based on whether this guy completes a rape."	12.) "What stunning lighting! Not at all hygge."
5.) "Like many wonderful genre works, this is ultimately a deeply relatable tale about dysfunction and adaptivity as well as trauma and Mary J. Blige's wig."	6.) "Another Canadian!"	7.) "That person is actually British."	8.) "So is Vancouver or TO better for tax - WOW COOL!"
The following is a thread of things I've said while watching Umbrella Academy.	1.) "Rihanna should do the theme"	2.) "When does Rihanna show up"	3.) "I'm going to keep making this Rihanna joke."	4.) "Game of Vowels and Hotyonce are gonna incest fuck but it's legal cuz adoption."
I'm pretty sure I have a fever, which is why I can't stop talking about Umbrella Academy, the fever dream of programs.

Not enough of you are really unpacking and emotionally sitting with the fact that the lead singer of My Chemical Romance co-authored the comic books that became "Umbrella Academy." Here he is in a famous screamo video from 1998. https://t.co/ZPXIxuG9jS
If my adopted brother were as hot as Game of Vowels and I had Hotyonce's excellent extensions I'd have to bone him. Consanguinity is not a factor and also our billionaire dad was icy so why not? https://t.co/B6fM0QQEc1
IS IT BECAUSE SHE ALSO HAS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT NUMBING CHILDREN'S PAIN, NOT UNLIKE "UMBARELLA ACADEMEDITO" STREAMING NOW ON A @netflix NEAR US ALL? https://t.co/wm6vyWV014
We watched four episodes in one night and I really went in on Chimp Butler theory. https://t.co/A8LGrwewOe
@Dealfatigue Well addiction is about being stuck. I read a good analysis about it and how it corresponds in many ways to 12 step theory and addiction and recovery. I don't mind reading about something ahead of time, I like to watch analytically to see how the writers get to their goal.
@ChristFinnegan Okay that was a lot. I'll admit it. Chimp Butler was also a lot.
Also there's no Game of Gorilla Body and probably no mom who is an actual literal robot. But I will get to it, it looks great.
When Chimp Butler showed up I was like, "I'm going to have to unpack whatever fucked up coded messaging may or may not be here, I feel deeply uncomfortable" but it was harder to suspend my disbelief about how the addict's eyeliner is always on correctly so far https://t.co/xeWIK45Bi5
No, I put it off due to the abundant tweets from people going SHE LOOKS LIKE YOU like yeah i fuckin' wish dummies, also I'm in meetings all the time so I will deal with this multi episode allegory about addiction at another point because there's no time traveling angry Jewish kid https://t.co/BlaGVgoBH9
@Lesley_NOPE WAIT ARE WE BEING CANADIAN FOR APOLOGIZING TO EACH OTHER
For sure Game of Vowels and Hotyonce are going to finger at some point, it's like Flowers in the Attic but with adoption so it's a real I Know My First Name Is Incest kinda situation for me in UMBAROOSKI ACADEMENTOR https://t.co/vg69hmX21g
@ChristFinnegan HE IS HAUNTED BY GHOSTS HE CAN'T UNHEAR CHRISTIAN, IT IS POWERFUL also his eyeliner is never off which is wild because he's definitely on serious drugs, wouldn't he forget the eyeliner? He eats a half eaten bagel in a Dumpster in one episode and I got very angry.
@Lesley_NOPE OH YOU ARE SO RIGHT!!!! I Get it now, I am sorry!
Yeah I really like Umbrazini Acadoomby, it is very fun and has many a moment that you could watch for pure popcorn pleasure but also it has depth and nuance and also that teen actor is like my favorite old Jewish man right now and there is always a big competition for that title https://t.co/jFX6Cu6Oi1
@Lesley_NOPE No way, Ellen P has the best American accent of all the cast INCLUDING THE ACTUAL AMERICANS
It is like if X Men and Watchmen and then also Gossip Girl with a side of One Tree Batman got together and fucked and now here is a show. You can also watch it as a surprisingly poignant primer on dysfunction and addiction but also there is time travel
Also I am afraid you will think when I say UMBARELLA ACADUMBRINI I am saying it is dumb, it isn't, I just like to make up different names for it like UMATHURMANCADEMIXALOT
@lscott1967 @EllenPage It is the jam, I dig it so much
I like to play "who is filling their Canadian quota" when I watch many a prestige streaming series and UMBARELLA ACADUMBRINI is so fun for this, I love the show a lot and all the vowels that aren't quite right.
Umbarella Academy is also fun because you can play "which supposed American is hitting their vowels all weird" and "who needed three extra weeks with the dialect coach" and it is the most fun bingo
I love Umbrella Academy and if it hasn't been mashed up with Rihanna's "Umbrella" featuring a supercut of @EllenPage looking sad, frightened, repressed and goddamned enchanting then why does the Internet even exist

14. UK Persons, I know it is painful to be able to actually relate to Americans with less of a smug sense of pre-Bush II cocksucking superiority, but don't worry: you will right this ship and look down on us with actual good reason soon.	15. We love you. https://t.co/howO8jDn69
13. You're a sarcastic, bizarre, diverse pack of deeply loving, emotionally stunted weirdos. You are loved. You'll get through this. It's going to suck sometimes. Take care of your friends. Make new friends. Look after your neighbors. I refuse to add the u. I won't do it.

Let's talk about Bradley Cooper. https://t.co/nFmTFk1vBN
12. Your parents, grandparents and great-grandparents got through two world wars, the fucking Blitz, Thatcherism, the semiretirement of the Spice Girls, and certain execrable seasons of Doctor Who, which I know you call "series" but whatever, I WRITE IN AMERICA. You got this.
10. People love most of all to fuck, drink, sleep, and get paid. People will do what they need to do to make these things happen. 	11. Don't hit somebody who says "we're better than this." Say "no, we aren't, actually" and then walk away. Then protest your ass off.
9. You will have food. There may be food insecurity in some situations. Some people may even go hungry. You can help them. If you have the luxury of time to check Twitter, you have the luxury of time to offer help to people who are frightened and impacted. This is true of us too.
8. It will FEEL like fucking chaos for awhile but it won't be TOTAL chaos, most likely. There will be lots of protests probably and really interesting and wonderful people will organize in excellent ways. Plan for extra traffic. Keep abreast of when and where protests happen.
Oh my God this is a big question. https://t.co/NGhqPo6WGE
7. If you are a white person, you may have relatives who voted Leave. Ignore them for awhile. If you must deal with their dumb asses, keep it short and business-only. They know what they did. If they didn't, they're idiots. You don't need to hang out with sociopaths or stupids.
Abbie you wonderful creature, I promise not to bring our trash chocolate. https://t.co/rtcDtavg8C
4. Get a therapist now. Or have one on retainer. Your nail technician or hairdresser does not count, although they will suffice for awhile.	5. DO NOT FUCK WITHOUT A CONDOM, YOU WILL HAVE A BREXIT BABY NOT UNLIKE A 9/11 BABY, THIS IS REAL.	6. It's a good time to join @Headspace.

LOOK AT THIS JUMPSUIT FROM TARGET. I HAVE PURCHASED MANY THINGS I LOVE FROM TARGET AND THIS IS THE MOST BELOVED ITEM AND I WOULDN'T HAVE IT IF A TWEEN HADN'T SAID "UGH WAAAAY TOO BIG" AND TOSSED IT ASIDE. NOW IT IS MINE YOU MIDDLE SCHOOLER MINE ENJOY YOUR BORING YOUTH!!!! https://t.co/HjRP5ZKGTZ

Because if I don't hide and maybe muzzle myself, based on the things some other white people have unnecessarily shared in the past 48 hours, I will probably volunteer that I'd for sure make out with Adam Levine and all 85 of his "Memento"-ass tattoos.
This new moon in Aquarius appears to be affecting The Whites in a particularly odd way. A lot of volunteering of info is happening that appears to be unnecessary. I volunteer I'm gonna put on extra sunscreen and hide under a bed for awhile.

If you need an FB account for some work purpose I suggest creating a dummy account and adding zero friends, unless you have to add friends from work. But really it's a delight to not have an FB account.

I think he should step down, but I don't think he will. My guess is racial justice activists and advocates can be on his ass for the rest of his tenure and probably make more progress than otherwise would've been possible. Cuz uh...he has some atoning to do.
Anyway, Virginia is fucking dope. I'm not worried about Virginians, including Gov. Northam. He will be fine as a private citizen. Racism past or present has no party affiliation. Nor does personal evolution. However, I doubt he'll resign over this.
Now none of these preceding options includes saying "I am a terrible man forever and everybody should hate me" not "Black people, please shoulder the burden of teaching yet another ignorant white man why a thing that is mean is still mean and bad."
Eighth option: "I am the governor of the great state of Virginia. I love this state. I know I'm not a bad guy. But I've done some ignorant things and it some of those things come forward and continue to cause pain. It's not on anybody else, it's on me. If I gotta go, I gotta go."
As an actual recovering monster, I am good at offering these services for many occasions! https://t.co/YlUpS7jKNS
Seventh option: "MAN THAT WAS FUCKED UP. I AM SORRY. SHIT. IF YOU ALL WANNA VOTE ON WHETHER I SHOULD STEP DOWN, PROBABLY RUSSIA HAS INVENTED A WAY TO MAKE THAT EASY. OR I'LL JUST GO, I MEAN, I COULD PROBABLY DO GOOD THINGS AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN OK BYE SORRY AGAIN."
Sixth option: "You know what, that wasn't me, I got confused because I realized it could've been me, but isn't that sad too? This has broken wide open for me the fact that I still walk with so much privilege and have excused casual racism and other prejudice for too long."
@DavidaBWilliams I really am here to serve the people and I came up with a thread of potential apologies he could do, many options, but I haven't included one where he legit  Moonwalks dear God what is today
Crisis PR: A Thread! (You can tell I've had to apologize for being an asshole about 8000 times in my life, although never for, uh, THIS particular reason.) https://t.co/2okIhPuTVX
@DavidaBWilliams Wouldn't that be excellent? It sure would. I bet he won't though. Maybe in two weeks.
Here's a fifth option: "Honey, I am a messy bitch and I may live for drama but Virginia sure don't. We aren't so far from what happened in Charlottesville and we are healing and I am not helping even though I'm truly sorry and feel bad. I'm out! Thank you for your time!"
RT @SpeakerPelosi: The photo is racist and contrary to fundamental American values. I join my colleagues in Virginia calling on Governor No‚Ä¶
Here's a fourth option: "It's best for me to step down at this time. I know I don't believe any of that behavior was appropriate or that racism is right, but I don't expect you to believe it, and I've caused stress and upset and pain and none of you owe it to me to deal with it."
Because I am a writer and I enjoy writing fictional scenarios that feel like they could be real, here's a third option: "Man, that was fucked up. Can you believe I thought that was an acceptable way to behave? My whiteness does not excuse it. My Southernness does not excuse it."
I'll pitch an alt.: "I did some offensive stuff, we all thought it was funny but it sure wasn't, this is a teachable moment for me and maybe for others that as a grown white man I still have to atone for ways in which I've participated in the power structure of whiteness."
Soft pitch: "That was me, it was about 60 yrs after any of that shit was remotely considered acceptable and it wasn't cool back THEN either, I'm sorry, if you wanna let somebody else be governor go for it, I've evolved and will continue to do so as a private citizen."

@warrenleightTV @ThatSarahKlem WARREN YOU ARE MAKING DREAMS COME TRUE I WILL STOP SHOUTING NOW BUT THANK YOU.
WARREN THANK YOU. Is it against WGA rules if I just fund my own Law and Order spinoff and call it "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" and I play the only recurring character, Det. Carpathia De La Guerra (her catchphrase is "you ain't shit!" after killing every Hudson U. criminal)?üòç https://t.co/4UP5M2FjK5
Sarah since I am definitely going to have my own Law and Order show called "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" do you have some tips for how I can really bring my character Det. Carpathia De La Guerra to life? Where does she buy her pantsuits? https://t.co/FmcZ96KA1f

I invite you to read my entire thread, as I am a genius (as we know) but also a humble one.

Work your ass off but work smart, be diligent and ethical and thoughtful and patient, learn about tax rules for freelancers - what you can and can't write off, and how and why - and live frugally. If you love it, you'll keep at it; if you don't, you'll find something you do love!
Also clips clips clips clips and more clips. Full time staff positions are rare in any news organization or publishing organization, and they're hard to get in a world where nepotism, favors, and alumni relationships are king. So build up a powerful array of freelance clips.
Another option is to work a day job that has some flexibility to allow you to pursue more internships, at which you'll have to work twice as hard and be thrice as diligent as the kid with the B.A. and the family who supports his dreams - but you'll build a stellar resume.
a.) Do not under any circumstances spend your time tweeting out Law and Order fan fiction	b.) Either go for the B.A. as it's standard for all media hires (old and new) in the writing world or	c.) Become rich and fund your own excellent, unassailably perfect reporting https://t.co/OlvQIW9IL4

RT @ChristFinnegan: Me? Oh just lying in bed, wondering if the Everclear guy is still pissed about his dad.
Well, this kind of blows up my Hudson-is-NYU theory. May need to revise before my series "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" commences, although in that series my character Det. Carpathia De La Guerra burns Hudson University to the ground in the pilot and it is never spoken of again. https://t.co/xb8a723Mye
@jennasauers Oh yes this has been brought to my attention and addressed earlier with grim humor, oy.
"You ain't shit" is the catchphrase of my character Det. Carpathia De La Guerra on my show "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit." She says it immediately after she kills a criminal, which happens at least once per episode. https://t.co/eE4YtJwMJ2
This is a very important thread about the Law and Order Universe and ultimately about how I should write for it and in fact have my own show in it, which is detailed later in the thread. I can be contacted via Rothman Brecher Ehrich Livingston or Artists First, thank you. https://t.co/HGsrludtoy
Here is who else is allowed to write episodes of my upcoming series "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" starring me as Det. Carpathia De La Guerra:		1.) Richard Curtis	2.) Hargitay	3.) Ice T	4.) Wallace Shawn		I write at least 46 episodes per season. It's a 50-episode season.
We will shoot some episodes of "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" at Chelsea Piers but other times we'll just do it live from a soundstage that I will make my friends build at PS 122 now called "Performance Space New York."
Okay I am revising to say that I am going to be EP of "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" and thank you @GennHutchison for reminding me to ask for what I want in this business. I WILL share co-creator credit with Dick Wolff, it just feels right. Some episodes will just feature me.
Thank you Jon. I cannot stop adding to this thread. https://t.co/1yyQarYMou
Thank you so much. I just really want to pay homage to my creative mentor I've never met, Mr. Richard Anthony Wolff. https://t.co/qs81osDKLO
"Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" will have craft services exclusively provided by Gray's Papaya and Veselka. There will be an on-set massage therapist and it will be the ghost of Spalding Gray. These are my requirements as co-EP and I feel they are reasonable.
NOICE! https://t.co/FEWG04OoV2
"Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" will exclusively employ veteran New York theatre actors, and also me. Other members of the L&amp;O universe will be cast on my series in a case by case basis. Regardless, everyone needs to prepare one song and dance number (comedic) for the audish.
I can tell you right now that when Belzer guests on "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" he and my character, Det. Carpathia De La Guerra, who may actually be played by Rita Moreno but is for sure my emotional twin and greatest creation, there will be TENSION.
@ZykeZero @slack2thefuture I'll tell you what the fuck goes on: PERFECTION. Case closed.
There will be crossover episodes between my series "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit" and all the other L&amp;O shows except my character Det. Carpathia De La Guerra is a loose cannon and she has SEVERAL physical fights with other characters EXCEPT Ice T whom she endlessly respects.
On "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit", my character Det. Carpathia De La Guerra constantly kills people, but everybody knows they ain't shit so it is fine. She wears a lot of pantsuits that fit very well, and she fucks.
I would like to have my own franchise in the Law and Order Universe, and it would be called "Law and Order: You Ain't Shit." Every episode would be about how a character I play called Det. Carpathia De La Guerra kills somebody who ain't shit. Also I write every episode and co-EP.

No, Columbia isn't on the Hudson. It's between 113thish, if we are counting Teachers College which as an alum I do, 120thish, but mainly between Broadway and Amsterdamish. Then again, NYU also is not on the Hudson. NYU owns more land, a note SVU hits repeatedly bc REAL ESTATE. https://t.co/xfvIDuWQmh
I think my favorite thing that's ever happened at Hudson University is when the very stupid mom wanted her very stupid son to get into the school so she boned a man claiming to be a professor APPARENTLY WITHOUT LOOKING HIM UP ON THE WEBSITE then her son jumped out a window.
I'm not even clear on what part of town Hudson University is in. I think they pretend it's up near Columbia to try and disguise the fact that it is supposed to be NYU but with better sports and academics. Also everything bad that ever happens at a university happens at Hudson.
NOT ONLY do various male student athletes at Hudson University rape or allegedly rape (but then it's lies!) various female student non-athletes but THE MALE ATHLETES CONSTANTLY RAPE EACH OTHER and also the coaches are always overseeing this, HAS THE NCAA BEEN INFORMED? https://t.co/1NUdi4ppF4
Also how does Hudson University still exist. Like at some point do any parents say, "Maybe we won't pay for our kids to go get raped at Hudson?" Also NYPD is never not on campus investigating a rape or a murder or a rapemurder. How do you spin that at high school admissions fairs
THE BEST THEME EVER https://t.co/5sKIQt5cbd
Nah, it's "the biggest landlord in the city" and people are constantly being raped or jumping out of windows so it's for sure NYU. Also there's a never-ending supply of students because it's a diploma factory CUT TO a former historic landmark building that is now a dormbortion. https://t.co/mGNrHhCzUj
Last night I watched one episode where Benson tells Peter Gallagher that she thinks he's being nice to Hudson U because they're "the biggest landlord in the city" which is direct and well deserved NYU shade. In the next episode she told her baby "you are NEVER going to Hudson."
We don't talk enough about how much Law and Order: SVU fucking hates NYU and roasts the school at every turn as the demonically rapetastic Hudson University. This may be the only writers room in television staffed entirely by Fordham and Pace grads and tbh I'm here for it.

...the airport spa at the mother trucking Helsinki Airport was GODDAMN DELIGHTFUL. It had a cold plunge pool and a warm saltwater pool and was sparkling clean and I had it all to myself INCLUDING THE THEMED DRY SAUNAS WITH FRESH EVERGREEN BRANCHES as well as lingonberry SOAPS.
Maybe it was 2013? I cannot remember, because I am CONSTANTLY DOING MY ART (TM) IN FOREIGN LANDS FOR A SUPERIOR EXCHANGE RATE OF FEE, YOU SEE. Anyway, the Helsinki Airport had a spa and I was like, "I bet this is disgusting, I'm for sure renting a bathing suit and going." AND...
Now I was once like you, a person who probably never goes to an airport spa or even thinks they exist. But then in 2010 I was flown to Oslo for the first time to do My Art (TM) i.e. tell dirty jokes onstage and demand answers about lutefisk. En route, I stopped in Helsinki.

And also, somebody on your plane with a gun or knife might not count as a "mass terror threat" but I sure as shit know I'd be RATHER upset if my personal safety or that of some passengers was threatened, so anyway, point is, I appreciate what TSA agents do for not enough $$$.
Anyway, if you are traveling these days, please stop and say thank you to a TSA agent. Yes it may be bullshit security theatre with regard to a mass terror threat but they do confiscate knives and guns and potentially dangerous shit every day across the US of A for low pay.
I am not sure but I think he meant either the airport itself is funding meals or folks from the wider community made sure there's catering all day but damn. That made me sad. Also I've never seen folks being so polite to TSA workers en masse.
He was very kind and confident but I wanted to double vault over the barrier and cause an international incident by throwing Starbucks and Target gift cards at everybody (I brought mine from my Mom at Xmas just in case but no dice and they can get in trouble if they say yes.)
"Oh thank you, but that's true, we can't accept that. But we are going to be okay. We kind of take care of our own here. People make sure we all have food at work so nobody goes hungry. It will pass. But thank you."
Yesterday I stopped to talk to a TSA agent and said, "I hear we aren't allowed to tip you guys or give you Starbucks cards even, but thank you for what you do." He said...

In actuality I have no idea as I haven't seen the movies! But like Rami and Mahershala are always great so honestly I'd like to give them personally both a lot of awards including but not limited to candy hearts and Valentines.
@DeusExCinema Baby boy thank you! As you know, you have the greatest of all Twitter bios and your life sounds dope and you seem very cool
@BurnStephan Oh honey thank you so so so so so much!!!!
This is the year of "Oh he was SPECTACULAR but the movie was..." and I'd like to give that award in advance to Rami and Mahershala though I've seen neither film but this is what I gather from These Hot Takes.

RT @quinncy: HELLO.		@SaraJBenincasa GAVE ME COLD-BREWED COFFEE. 		I CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.
This is not to say older folks can't learn - we can and should, from teens on up. But as the mind hardens against outside influence and people become more entrenched in their systems of privilege or values etc. it becomes more difficult to hear outside truth.
@blkensf ahahahahahhahah
When a kid is old enough to, say, get in an elder's face at a rally and scream at him to humiliate him, THAT kid is operating as a hateful adult. Willful aggression versus a little child who is learning boundaries and operates without malice but needs education.
Killer Mike obviously understands the young kids don't fully intellectually comprehend the entire context of what's going on but he also clearly respects their intelligence and personhood and knows they have important things to say. He should teach school honestly.
Also the immediate grace and love he shows the Black boy who is reporting the cruel words of another kid - that's beautiful.
Exactly. Mason is never gonna be like that most likely because he had an adult check him early, with a firm and clear explanation that he understood on a soul level even if he didn't understand the terms yet. https://t.co/sxg0IphpaC
Killer Mike keeps the focus on the young Black boy who was told his skin looked like poop, yet still firmly checks a white kid while making it a teachable moment ending in affirmation. I used to be a teacher, this is a master class in listening to children and setting boundaries.
"IT IS TIME TO CALL IN YOUR OWN INNER MASON, MY WHITE FRIENDS. SPEAK TO HIM KINDLY BUT FIRMLY. THE REST IS JUST COMMENTARY." - KILLER MIKE HILLEL
"There are many Masons in this world who, if checked early, would learn. But as grown white people it's on us to FIND OUR OWN INNER KILLER MIKE AND CHECK OUR OWN MASON." - Plato
OMG @pixie_casey just also recommended this https://t.co/UKfoIvSSm4
Here's just one reason I dig this - he speaks to an interrupting child with respect, gives him a heads up (while playing to the cameras) and the kid totally gets it because he's a kid with an absorbent mind and probably a very kind soul and then we proceed. Get 'em young. https://t.co/3R5013hdb9

In conclusion, as an anti-choice indoctrinated Catholic kid with extensive internalized queerphobia, I always asked my mother to let me go to the March for "Life" in D.C. She always said no. I am belatedly thrilled. Thank God for moms who won't let kids get swept up in cults.

@BridgetPhetasy My SIL watched some of the show and has been cleaning the fuck out of their house while my bro entertains their baby who looks like an old man (and hopefully helping her) but IDK if they saw ep 1 cuz I think they wouldn't like those folks.
Does anybody know if there's a "how you can help the teachers on strike" page somewhere? I could throw coffee and donuts at them but maybe they need other stuff too. https://t.co/EGvIFLzLnZ
My theory is they went with epsode 1 because they were like, "We want a mainstream audience in white America so we will lead with mainstream-seeming white people and then roll into diversity" which IMHO was a mistake bc some folks got turned off bc the ep 1 people have $$. https://t.co/XiK9unFrto

@BridgetPhetasy @KorGhee @netflix Bridge we legit could talk about the boobies for DAYS. I have so many feelings about that episode, first I was like "fuck these people" then I was like "damn there's a lot going on there" then I was like "man I feel sorry for her" then "man I feel sorry for him" then "JESUS."

Well, I've reached the end of "Take A Look At This Kondo!" and my thoughts are many. Mainly I'm sad there are only 8 episodes in this infomercial for Marie Kondo's book.
The two queer couples on "Tidying Up" have their shit so much more together than everybody else and they're like, "Ugh, we are so messy" because life has taught them they have to be 1000x better than straights in order to matter AT ALL.
I can't wait until Marie brings the lesbians...some boxes.
Sincerely thrilled and want to propose gay marriage to the producer who decided to reserve the bra-folding lesson for the LESBIANS episode.
In this episode I'm having trouble figuring out if Marie is doing a lash strip or lash extensions or a lash lift.
"Hi, we're stunning lesbians of color and we have dogs and our house is like 98% organized, Marie can you help us?"
I HAD TO WADE THROUGH SEVEN EPISODES TO GET TO THE QUEER WOMEN. Friggin' finally. We have a Latinx veterinarian and a Black flight attendant and they're hot and their house is like barely messy because they're lesbians and perfect, obviously.
Episode 7 was so nice. Now on to Episode 8 a.k.a. "FINALLY, THE LESBIANS!" https://t.co/lDskHLQo6Q
I think Mario grew up poor and lost a parent young or was in foster care or bounced around from home to home and that's why he keeps so much stuff and has trouble because he's used to acquiring material things to create a sense of security thank you.
I'm the world's biggest Marie Kondo stan but if she makes Mario in episode 7 give away any Js with a sick colorway I will flip on her so fucking hard.
Mario is a sneakerhead and I'm already intensely concerned somebody is gonna make him give away his sick '90s Jordans.
A note on booking: I dig that the people on Tidying Up are mainly middle-class or working class people. Also Mario collects sneakers.
Mario is very cute and I feel strongly he was raised by or around strong women. This show is making me psychic in this way: I just make up people's backstories and decide they're correct. And that's the magic of Tidying Up.
I think this dude gets emotional and she runs him. I appreciate that.
I appreciate that this pregnant lady sexually objectifies her hot boyfriend.
He asked her to be his girlfriend by writing on the mirror in eyeliner. Once a guy asked me that by writing on a bar napkin. We were both drunks and it lasted many years! Anyway, Marie Kondo and I are having fun here.
Okay. So. We're in Hawthorne, we are Latinx, we are hot.
Episode 7. We've got another "babe" couple. Whew.
Oh yeah, there's some heavy erasure going on and I ain't talkin' about the band https://t.co/A1GE75mfEf
This is probably the best of my epic Kondo thread thus far. https://t.co/JDZDXGqxzE

You guys, I thought episode 6 with Sehnita and Aaron was supposed to be all fucked up or something, but it's like, fine. They have some friction and she's dealing with some anxiety issues but they're still into each other and they get a lot of work done.
I love Sehnita's speaking voice. I would make a great stepmother to her two present children and to the future one we have together thanks to a celebrity sperm donor.
This couple is tense but I think they have a better future than episode 1 people. Sehnita and Aaron need to go to couples counseling.
This is a really good idea - maybe eBay? https://t.co/nasZ6613zq
Sehnita is worried about not having a third baby and thus about the end of her identity as a mother of wee ones, is my theory. Relatable to many gals.

I have a few copies of my own books on hand but mostly I give them away and if I need any more, I buy them or ask the publisher for them. Them shits take up space! Don't be precious about books! Keep ones you adore and pass the others on so somebody with less $ can buy/borrow.
I'm an author. I like books, just like any human who deserves TO BE CONSIDERED SEXY IN THIS WORLD. But please do not hang onto books just because they look good or you MIGHT read them someday. Clear your space and support your public library! Donate, recycle, make them into hats!

Sehnita and Aaron have my favorite house, layout-wise, of all the people on this program. TAKE A NOTE, FUTURE HUSBANDS OF MINE.
Julia YES he is threatened by any of her power yup. https://t.co/aKs1iM37RF
NOTHING IN MY LIFE HAS EVER BEEN AS PURE AS THE SIGHT OF MARIE KONDO COACHING ME ON HOW TO FOLD BABY ONESIES.
The anxiety of giving stuff away is real for some folks. I see Sehnita's fear because of "just in case" and "oh what if" mentality. I also think she's funny and fun.
Sehnita is sad and feels she can't give anything away. Also she feels uncomfortable. Also she is not used to feeling her feelings, I think. Oh, me and Sehnita would get along and we'd like go to a day spa and talk about our feelings and bathe in a Xanax pool scented with vanilla.
Is the translator single because she needs to be by our traditional lesbian wedding
"Tidying Up with Marie Kondo" is basically "Not Hoarders, Really!"
Oh wait Sehnita isn't pregnant, I thought she said she was, my bad, my people. Thank you for correcting me.
Well that's just for her personally...and I suspect they're all Bibles. But for everybody else I think she's like, "Look, do you REALLY love or care about that book?" and people are like "Yes I do need this Penthouse letters anthology" and she's like "I mean here's a Bible." https://t.co/C74eJaGS4v
Okay we are MAYBE hoarder-adjacent here with Sehnita. Hoardjacent.
Sehnita feels disconnected to her desi roots and her clothing is a piece of connection. She also loves magazines. She is very beautiful. I think she has anxiety issues and is afraid of Aaron taking her things away. But also a good sense of humor. SO FAR.
Sehnita and Aaron seem fun. But I KNOW they're going to break my heart. Or enrage me. Unless Marie does some wack shit and reveals her murderous intent.
This couple is very good-looking and they went to the University of Michigan and they've been married for 17 years, which is bananas. How? Marriage is hard. I'm full of philosophy not unlike Marie Kondo.
Okay episode 6 is our first interracial couple. Sehnita and Aaron. Natalia is 2.5. There is a boy named Ashton? Sehnita is pregnant. I don't trust this white man but I'm going to give him a chance.
On to episode 6, which apparently I'm going to love or hate.
Okay episode 5 of Tidying Up is legit. The gay writers are prone to anxiety especially the one who writes comedy for TV because HELLO and it ends really nicely with one of their dads toasting the couple and saying "God bless you both." I feel God in this gay episode tonight.
Also Frank's dad loves him and they are so proud of him for organizing his things.
"Frankie has never failed us. He is a wonderful, wonderful guy." OMG his mom loves him and he is so hard on himself.
Work through internalized queerphobia through folding towels.
THESE GAYS AND I GIVE AWAY OUR STUFF AT THE SAME PLACE.
This thread gets so queer https://t.co/ltQRwwmo4H
Guys this thread is a lot of me just really marinating in my truth tbh https://t.co/JDZDXGqxzE
Episode 5 couple is somehow the exactly antidote to episode 1 couple but granted, they don't have two little kids to deal with.
I love these gays. Frank is very anxious although he's the outgoing one according to Matt who says he personally comes off as more aloof. I think they both come off as "went to lots of therapy and are my sons."
Honey thank you! I am working on my magnum opus, this bananas thread starting with episode 2 because I can't handle episode 1. https://t.co/b4l6lpEfvv
Marie is making one of the gays go through his stash of Power Rangers fan fiction in case you're wondering exactly how to make me have a vaginal orgasm.
Mega shout out to the music supervisor and editor for inserting the dorkiest possible music cue when Marie Kondo makes this adorable gay touch his fave copy of "To Kill a Mockingbird." 		If I were producing him...		"Now touch 'Go Set A Watchman.'"		"FUCK YOU!!! GET OUT!!!"
HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH HE LOVED THE SCHOLASTIC BOOK FAIR.
The screenwriter gays are tidying their books and she says you say "thank you" to each book before you decide what to do with it or whatever, and I'm so hoping one of them pulls out Story and says "FUCK OFF, MCKEE!" and breaks down weeping.
Such solid B-roll of squirrels in this episode.
This is not helping alleviate my queer fantasies about Marie Kondo. https://t.co/WdmhNjPC8m
I can put together a pitch doc about why she'd add a lot to the experience.
On this episode of "WE BOUGHT A KONDO!" we meet with Hollywood gays who are already very well-organized but are VERY HARD ON THEMSELVES ABOUT NOT BEING PERFECT but who work super well together as a couple and will probably have one to three adorable adopted kids.
@JasonReitman can you put Marie Kondo into Ghostbusters
I mean Marie hasn't even faux-meditated yet and they're hitting us with the piano cue.
EARLY PIANO CUE. Queerness makes everything earlier, louder and better.
Marie wants to be like, "Look, gays, your life is dope and this place is organized. Why are you being so hard on yourselves? Let's talk about maybe not tidying up."
"Oh wow, look how deep it goes!" Marie, I could show you the world.
Marie Kondo climbing into the actual closet of these WGA insurance-supported gays is really giving me life and also I'm ready for her to come out of the closet as I have been since ep 1 except she's not queer and I'm sad about it, anyway.
OKAY so one of these guys is a TV comedy writer who is probs a mutual follow for me on this very website (hi let's talk about the Toluca Lake MPTF health center bb!) and the other is some cute guy who is my son.
It's a rainy Tuesday night in Los Angeles and you know what that means: TIME TO TAKE A HEAPING HELPING OF TIDYING UP AND SHOVE IT DOWN MY MOUTH HOLE! LET'S GOOOOO! Episode 5 a.k.a. "FINALLY SOME QUEERS!"
Maybe this is a version where Ally is pissed that GOOP sells snake oil and bottled bullshit and asshole coffee enemas but she really loved Shallow Hal so she's really sad about Gwyneth and she writes songs only about that. Bradley Cooper is not in this movie.

So far here's how I rate Marie Kondo Programming On The Netflix, worst to best	4. Episode 1 (absolutely not)	3. Episode 2 (Ron and Wendy, you have so much Christmas)	2. Episode 4 (Margie, you probably voted for Trump but you are healing)	1. Episode 3 (The Mersiers win)
Feeling #KONMARGIE so hard. Also she's doing a great seafoam cowlneck long sleeved top in our final confessional which is what I will always call these moments. Good job Margie.
Everybody loves to hug Marie Kondo.
Yes, I feel like the producer needed to produce them harder in that dinner sequence because I couldn't suspend disbelief. I mean like any future EP of a reality show, I have notes. https://t.co/PHeJjzZ3aH
I really need Margie from episode 4's kids to pop out some grandbabies for her soon.
SEE! https://t.co/A5jfoKVQPM
JODY IT IS TRUE TELL THEM TO WATCH OUT FOR DANCING MUNCHKINS! https://t.co/aa2QrD0d6Q
The late great Kevyn Aucoin (RIP) would totally ride for Marie Kondo's lightened medium brown eyebrows in contrast with her stunning black hair.
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE HIRE ME TO WRITE #TIDYINGUP RECAPS OR TO HOST "WIPING UP AFTER TIDYING UP: THE MARIE KONDO AFTERSHOW"?! I CAN BE REACHED VIA MY REPRESENTATION https://t.co/9dWl6ncllY OR JUST DM ME IMMEDIATELY
This is how TV and film editors sext https://t.co/briJoYFfyC
Guys the Sony lot has a rainbow on it and it is haunted by dead Munchkin ghosts as is the Culver Hotel, you need to know this footnote to fully understand Margie from episode 4 who raised her kids in this haunted corner of Los Angeles.
I will drive my ass over to Culver City to take Margie to tea and also inquire about her skincare regimen because whether we are doing Clinique or La Mer we are really aging with grace and our highlights are KICKING honey.
@Millicentsomer WHAT! That is a beautiful name!!!!
Margie is CRYING in front of the CAMERAS and she does NOT want to get rid of her dead husband's many Big 'n' Tall button downs and the crew is like probs having a lot of emotions but you know they're all reality vets so also they get so wasted and violate NDAs apres work.
Here's how to watch Kondo:	1.) Hate watch ep 1	2.) Feel superior	3.) Watch ep 2 lovingly and fall in love with Ron and Wendy, who have too many Christmas things and will teach you about Japanese-American internment and racism	4.) Watch ep 3 and fall in love with the Mersiers https://t.co/sp8aGjnu00
LILI MY GREATEST DREAM IS TO WRITE MARIE KONDO RECAPS AND REACTIONS AND THINKPIECES AND ALSO MY MOM HAS YOUR NAME AND IF I HAVE A DAUGHTER HER NAME MAY BE LILI MARIE KONDO https://t.co/y01X7ZVtKo
Yo what is this weird Instagram tilt shift gauzy border filter shit the editor is laying down on certain moments in these Kondo episodes? I object. This is why I need to be in that AVID bay.
OMG y'all. Marie Kondo suggests the "bag in bag" method which is when you put a bag in another bag to store it and also is what I call Elder Sapphic Scissoring I'm sorry.
Lili! I got so upset at the first episode I couldn't. So this insane thread starts with episode 2, when I began to recover. https://t.co/s5oSZnYhkI
I don't want to push Margie the widow in episode 4 into anything but she is legit fine and that Baby Boomer booty is working okay sorry sorry back to Kondo.
I really like Margie, who has had her eyes filled with tears for basically the whole episode. Also I'm pretty sure she idolized her husband Rick (RIP). Also she is a very hot Baby Boomer widow and I sense Zumba.
Having bronchitis has been so good for my TV life. Like I go out for a few hours at most and then I just like to cough and get in touch with Netflix.
My friend is doing the research and it sounds like Marie Kondo had a dissociative episode in middle school and this led her to her tidying ways. Just FYI. Okay anyway! Back to episode 4!
I think she thanks them for their service. https://t.co/HhgkwTyQCz
PIANO CUE AS MARIE GREETS THE HOME Y'ALL. I rely on this more than my own emotions.
Marie Kondo's lash lift was clearly revived before episode 4. I'd really like to honor the truth of how she has paid top dollar for keratin conditioner on her eyelids and the hairs that grow out of them.
I do this thing Margie the hot widow does, which is I will buy a random gift without knowing who I'm gonna give it to and then I will put it in a closet until I figure it out. Marie has assessed this home as having "a good energy." They have a Warholian quadruple image of a dog.
Marie just climbed on a carousel horse displayed in a widow's living room without hesitation. Marie gets wild. This was a sexual moment for me even though it was supposed to read as whimsical and cute. Then a cat attacked her. I remain aroused.
Margie is gonna cry through this entire episode. I really appreciate people who demonstrated emotion especially when they look like petite WASPs. Also they faked a very basic meal for the cameras and I'd like to draw attention to the single half-peppers they're supposedly eating.
Margie is so pretty. I like her bright eyes. She needs to clean out probably her deceased husband's stuff and I am thinking also some stale vibes. Her adult kids look normal for Culver City-raised children. Also they're cute and seem nice.
Okay bitchfucks it's time for Episode Cuatro: A sad lady has lost her husband and needs to clean out. I like her hair and she lives in Culver City, where it's hard to get good Verizon service on your iPhone and there are Munchkin ghosts.

I have watched three episodes of your Kondo program and it is lovely. I shall continue soon.
Nicest thing Marie Kondo ever said about me!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/bV9irqkqjl
These families fucking LOVE Marie. When she shows up they all screech and/or squeal. She looks mildly surprised every time. Her lash lift lifts us all.
Oh HELL yes me and Russell, son of Ron and Wendy, will be married under a chuppa made of his dad's old baseball cards though neither of us is Jewish. Catering by the second wife of the sad dad from episode 1, his current administrative assistant probs. https://t.co/HSFF7I4Cuf
It would be so dope if in one of these episodes Marie Kondo homewrecks the shit out of a family while also teaching them how to fold underpants.
MARIE IS TALKING TO MRS. MERSIER ABOUT DIVISION OF LABOR, WHAT AN ETERNAL TOPIC FOR WOMEN AND THE SUBJECT OF MY PH.D THESIS CALLED "BEING A REALITY SHOW HOST WHO DELICATELY INFORMS YOU THAT YOUR HUSBAND AND KIDS NEED TO DO CHORES TOO."
@AbbieHeadon I am so excited Abbie!
I am obsessed with my favorite people thus far on "We Got A Kondo!," the episode 3 children, a.k.a. Down To Earth Willow and Deeply Centered Jaden.
Bury me to the tune of the piano cue whenever Marie pretends to meditate on her Kondo show and "introduce herself to the house."
Marie Kondo's lash lift empathetically understands when a mother cries.
The family on episode 3 of "KONDOMANIA!" are the only people besides like two of my friends I ever want to speak to in Los Angeles ever again.
The Mersier children are the most precocious people in Los Angeles.
Every one of the Mersiers has beautiful locs because Katrina, a.k.a. mom the hairdresser, is probably in charge. They live in a two bedroom apartment with their son and daughter. This is a good show about America. Again, episode 3 continues episode 2's tradition of OWNING ep 1.
Okay correction, episode 3's family is the Mersiers. I want nothing but good things for them. I want joy and love and happiness in their life. Marie will teach them to fold.
EPISODE 3! LET'S MEET THE MERCIERS! This episode is also called "Finally, The Cute Black Kids From The Trailer." She's a hairdresser, he's a musician, they moved to Los Angeles from Michigan, that's an expensive move. I love them and am fully committed to their joy.
Marie Kondo and her lash extensions have saved another family but also Ron and Wendy have such a great solid marriage and also they will make great in-laws when I marry their son, Russell. Great work episode 2 you sparked joy!
I AM PERSONALLY SO PROUD OF RON AND WENDY FOR TAKING ALL THAT SHIT OFF THEIR POOL TABLE. THEY WERE RUINING THE FELT, NOW THEY ARE FREE.
OH MY GOD RON FOUND HIS FATHER'S DIARY ABOUT PEARL HARBOR AND ABOUT BEING INTERNED AS A JAPANESE-AMERICAN MAN AND HE IS SHOWING IT TO MARIE WHO IS FROM JAPAN THIS IS A PERFECT SHOW ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY AND ALSO MODERN CONTEXT AND ALSO CLEAR PLASTIC CONTAINERS!!! https://t.co/BYVBlcceMZ
Ron has powerfully valuable baseball cards and should sell them for sweet monies.
@SabrinaSee God between us and certain of our associates we can find them in ten minutes. Will we get arrested for stalking? I mean maybe. But we'll find out everything.
The level of animosity I felt towards the episode 1 couple is being fully eaten alive by the growing love I have for Ron and Wendy in episode 2 of "Kondo Time!"
@SabrinaSee They're in Long Beach, I think. We could just go to their house and ask how it's going.
@SabrinaSee Oh yeah he's a sad dad and he's been sexting at the very least but he's for sure consummated the fuckening, I give them til 2020 legally speaking, I'm thinking Q4 he files.
Wendy wants a fuckload of Christmas things. Marie is going to teach her to store her things properly. OH MY GOD MARIE'S OLDEST SWEET PETITE DAUGHTER MAKES AN APPEARANCE LOOK AT SATSUKI WHEN SHE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD AND ALREADY AS TALL AS MOMMY. https://t.co/LSOyLizpIR
Oh this is so sweet. Wendy is really thoughtful and is really working through her anxiety in a brave way and Ron is really cool and Russell, their perfect son, is perfect. Kondo is really trying to give a chill face but even Kondo is concerned yet hopeful as is her nature.
Oh yeah episode 1 of "Kondo Towne!" is bad because the couple is privileged and unsympathetic and call each other "babe" a lot and their marriage will be legally over by 2020 per California laws and my infallible guesstimate, also the mom is still nursing an adult child basically https://t.co/hoC2WHiaqY
SKIP EPISODE ONE THE BORING PROBABLE TRUMP VOTING WHITES IN IT FEEL SAD FOR THEMSELVES AND WILL SOON DIVORCE GO TO EPISODE TWO WITH THE JAPANESE-AMERICAN HOARDERS AND THEIR PERFECT SWEET ADULT SON RUSSELL MY FUTURE HUSBAND https://t.co/jwr8ok2Lk0
On "Let's Get Kondo'd!" episode 2 I am fully in love with Russell the sweet son who just wants his parents to not die under a pile of their things, their many things.
Marie Kondo and Russell the son who has almost certainly completed his LCSW and MSW are really working hard on squelching their natural urges to scream, "HOLY FUCK Y'ALL NEED A SHRINK!" at the really nice but troubled mom and dad with the Christmas collecting issue.
@minglishmuffin I love you!
On "That's My Kondo!" S1:E2 we see that Wendy, who is lovely, has a fuckton of Christmas stuff in several rooms and her son, Russell, is clearly up on the fact that she and her husband are hoarders. I love you Russell and your probable certification in EMDR and CBT.
Episode 2 of The Kondo Show is basically "Hoarders" without rat feces...yet.
Wendy says her husband Ron is satisfied with "the status quo." She believes you cannot stay happy if you stick with the status quo. Wendy has been to therapy and Ron has not, is what I'm surmising.
Episode 2, The Kondo Show. Ron and Wendy are of Japanese descent. Ron believes in "happy wife, happy life." Their son is there to "help my mom" because dad maybe doesn't want to throw shit out. Ron has a lot of baseball cards. I'm not wearing pants or underpants.
I read the manga version of the book. I'd skip episode 1 with the extremely privileged white people who will divorce within 36 months. https://t.co/XBCjyhR6jj

Maybe you, megabillionaire who is suddenly single, are interested in dating a dude! Well step right up and hang out with my friend @ColtonActs! What a fine megabillionaire trophy husband he'll make for you! This thread about who you should marry, Unnamed Rich Guy, is genderfluid!
At this point in the thread you may have ascertained that I'm a.) just soft pitching you on potential wives so that I can get free stuff and b.) just soft pitching you on potential wives I would myself marry. YOU ARE CORRECT! This is why you're a megabillionaire, unnamed sir!
Now let's look at @ElayneBoosler. I have no idea if Elayne is single and we've never actually hung out but if you are a suddenly single megabillionaire who LOVES TO LAUGH and also get boners, consider this delectable morsel for your marriage BUT ONLY IF I AM INVITED ON VACAY!

I love having bronchitis because I stay inside all the time except to take the garbage and recycling out and also I watch so much Kondo. I think about Kondo a lot. I take antibiotics and then probiotics because I'm out here sparking motherfucking joy in my undercarriage.
Do you guys think Kondo would do my podcast @WhereYaFromPod @anchor
I don't know what the hell Marie Kondo's show is actually called, to me it is The Kondo Show and I long for the series finale where she and her translator steal a convertible, grip hands and jump it off a cliff because fuck these messy people
Also can somebody set a clip from The Kondo Show to the Game of Thrones theme, thank you

Once I was on a panel and had a panic attack after an intense blood sugar drop because I hadn't eaten. I was like, "Sorry to be weird, but I'm hypoglycemic - does anybody have a snack? I'll make more sense after almonds or perhaps a cracker." Food materialized immediately.

Also if you're nervous about what to write, look up some good quotes ahead of time for your speech. You can sprinkle them in throughout or have them in reserve in case you get stuck or scared. And you can have your timer on silent on your phone on a lectern or stool. Bring water.
I started CRYING recently in the middle of a speech in front of like 250 people but because it was appropriate to the subject matter (again, I lecture about reducing mental health stigma) we all rolled with it. It helps to be self-deprecating. Also some of them cried too.
Finally, a lot of folks in an audience will get nervous thinking about public speaking. They feel better knowing you're human and you WANT to do well. So if you get all flustered when you make a mistake, that's counterproductive. Instead, smile/laugh and keep going.
This always ruined my set, but do you. https://t.co/090VycB7n1
Tell the audience how grateful you are for their time and attention, and how excited you are to be there (if indeed you are excited.) If you're visiting a new town, learn some things about it and tell them how those things made you happy or surprised. People love compliments.
Don't force yourself to try to be funny, inspirational, cute, sexy, brave, etc. Be how you are naturally. And if you are giving a lecture of sorts and it feels appropriate, you can open with a joke or sincere statement about how nervous you are.
Remember to pause to breathe. It's fine to look at your notes, unless you're taping an HBO comedy special or doing a dramatic monologue onstage or something. Imagine you're telling a story at a dinner party among friends. And remember the audience WANTS you to do well.
When I was still drinking, I would be careful not to drink before going onstage because I found it made me forget my jokes when I did stand-up. However, there are times when things like peppermint tea - or Xanax - can work wonders. But experiment ahead of time with substances.
I lecture about mental health stigma at colleges and here's what I do: I pick three spots, in the back of the crowd, slightly above someone's head, and address those spots randomly throughout the speech. It looks like I'm looking at the crowd but I'm totally not. https://t.co/jbHnP8Pr3D

Can we reboot "Bones" but it's just about Chalamet's perfect face? (Ezra Miller's perfect face recurs.)
I need to remind everyone that Chalamet is wearing a bedazzled fuckswing and, prior to going to the awards show, posed with his lovely mother whilst wearing it on the Instagram. What a supportive gal.
But seriously "The Lovely Bones" was an extraordinary piece of writing and a deeply sad, heart wrenching novel but I wish they'd picked another title because IT IS ALSO MY GRAD SCHOOL THESIS TITLE ABOUT CHALAMET AND EZRA MILLER AT WHORE UNIVERSITY WHERE I NOW HAVE TENURE
Chalamet and E. Miller make me feel like I'd maybe do consensual sex to an of-age Bambi, please quote-tweet this with an emoji of your choice.
@bgporter Dawwww
I've never done mushrooms but the Sliding Doors other timeline me who does mushrooms and is constantly talking about Joshua Tree just wrote the previous tweet in this thread and she's VERY proud of her armpit hair, which she has instead of a personality.
Timbo Chalamet and Ezra Miller are in the Teensy Tiny Fine Bones Club which is a china shop underneath Club 33 at Disneyland and all the teacups are made of their bones, which regenerate and can be painlessly extracted by the ghost of Audrey Hepburn but ONLY TO MAKE THE TEACUPS.

@NadineThornhill We are so lucky to walk this earth alongside her.
"You need to fire your publicist." They will nod solemnly, and we will embrace, and I will whisper, "It's important to have a team that really gets you." Then I will offer my mini lint roller, hand them a purse snack of a 40 cal almond bag, and vanish, like a whispered prayer. https://t.co/LsVqoj3AkO
By this point, the nominee's sobs will have quieted a little, slowed to occasional gulping gasps, and they will look at me with their giant near-lidless lizard person eyes, so beautiful and alien, and they will say to me, "D-d'you promise?" And I will stroke their hair and say...
"There are mothers sitting at home right now, MIDDLE CLASS MOTHERS, and they're nursing even though they couldn't afford a private lactation empath, and their babies don't eat organic and they're going to be ugly, and they live through you and for you so you MUST stay strong."
And I will hold their tiny, finely-boned face in my hands while they weep real human tears down their airbrush makeup (it's a thing) visage and I will say, "The studio didn't invest in a campaign, everybody knows it, literally everyone in America is obsessively angry for you."
I won't tell any of you about it but I will know that I saw it, this very famous very wealthy person weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth screaming "THIS WAS MY YEAR! THEY SAID IT WAS MY YEAR! WHEN DO I GET A TURN?!", and I will hand them a Ginger People Chew and a Xanax.
Like my main reason for wanting to a.) write a critically acclaimed searing motion picture EVENT or b.) get staffed on some prestige streaming heartwrenching show is that I want to be in a bathroom when someone famous has an intense meltdown after not getting an award, that's it.
I keep not getting nominated and also not dating anybody or being the cis bi platonic friend of a nominee who just went through a divorce and just needs a supportive buddy to hold a purse/Xanax bottle but I'm going to fix this I swear. #GoldenGlobes2019

I'm so glad this thread got passed around. I truly meant it with sincerity from my flawed human heart. Mere hours after tweeting this thread I saw that liking a post with #HappyNewYear on it made the &lt;3 do a clown jizz. I also did a thread about that. It's a real high/low mix. https://t.co/tRnJeXEGtp
@GennHutchison @PerditaWeeks I also got sad when I finished dammit!
For you the clown jizz works, milady. For some the clown jizz will, I think, always work. I have heard reports from many "My clown still jizzes!" But for me, the clown has stopped jizzing. I hit the heart on a #HappyNewYear post, and no more jizzsplosion. Pennywise is spent. https://t.co/TMDeuIgYjn
I for SURE loved @PerditaWeeks straight up killing it as the Circe narrator (Ms. W you nailed that, I would give you a Pulitzer, an Oscar, AND an Obie) but this was actually a different Greek mythology audiobook. Circe was my gateway drug! It's all spanakopita for me now! https://t.co/OJdDSJMic7
I ended 2018 on a high note, man 12/31 was a banger. After tweeting this, I cackled myself to sleep for a disco nap and woke up with monster death cramps but it was worth it. https://t.co/1EN7YVPdkV
You guys I was not feeling well last night so I was not able to go to parties and so I took a LOT of ibuprofen because of Eve eating the apple etc. (that's why we have period cramps, duh) but anyway, also I listened to a Greek mythology audiobook and slept 14 hours at least!
Hello, @heatherfink and I were invited to the annual pajama brunch of some lovely friends and I believe every party and indeed function of any kind (funeral, bris, Maypole celebration, corn husking fiesta) should have this theme. Thank you. https://t.co/SohJ2SdJZn
The clowns still jizz for some. But for me, the clowns no longer jizz when I hit the heart on a thing that says #happynewyear but at least the clown jizz emoji automatically pops up after the hashtag. This is how life unfolds I suppose. https://t.co/d9gNGkhSng
It stopped doing a clown jizz. I will never forget you, #happynewyear clown jizz that happened when you hit the heart. I see that emoji still shows up after the statement but I miss the action, which was sexual and clownlike. https://t.co/1EN7YVPdkV

In conclusion, if you think of yourself as an enlightened individual but realize you‚Äôre hanging onto tired prejudices...or if you brand yourself as a hardass and discover more compassion inside yourself than you realized...it‚Äôs OK to say, ‚ÄúI was wrong. I am sorry.‚Äù It‚Äôs a start.
It‚Äôs OK to realize that some folks you avoided or mocked or marked as irrelevant actually have vastly more worth than you thought and maybe you despised them because you feared a part of yourself...IF this truly is the case. Boundaries can expand and contract.
You should definitely push back against people who are shitty, condescend to you, purposefully treat you with a lack of respect, actively try to harm you or those you love and that includes with their vote. I don‚Äôt think you should adore everybody or even engage with them. But...
I mean if you‚Äôre prejudiced against any one group of people you‚Äôre also going to miss out on the douche bags in that group but they will be fewer than the awesome people. So you‚Äôre really just fucking yourself over in addition to also hurting others with your rejection.
I can say from personal experience that if you have a certain prejudice in your life against a particular group‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not talking about cutting out malicious individuals who want to hurt others, I‚Äôm talking about ignorant prejudice...you‚Äôll waste time missing out on great people.
Obviously you have to be genuinely sorry or at least reflective because people can read the inauthenticity‚Ä¶ And people who don‚Äôt like you anyway are going to think that you‚Äôre being inauthentic regardless. But I‚Äôve always appreciated people who can fuck up and own it.
I don‚Äôt think it makes you weaker as a person, performer, writer, politician to say that you realized that something you used to say or do, something that influenced your behavior, turned out to be negative or hurtful and you‚Äôre sorry.
Sometimes I think about jokes I used to do or beliefs I used to have that were shitty/hateful and I think, ‚ÄúWow I‚Äôm sorry I said or wrote that, that was shitty/hateful and I hope I‚Äôve improved as a person, I‚Äôve been trying.‚Äù Folks can accept it or not, the world keeps turning.

I was very tired and I DID have the DJ Khaled album so really I have to own this one entirely.
One of the most elegant moments of my 2018 was being on a date with a dude who told me to put on Khalid and I misheard him and thought he wanted to hear DJ Khaled and I was like trying to wrap my mind around how that‚Äôs someone‚Äôs sex playlist but then he was like ‚ÄúWHAT?
