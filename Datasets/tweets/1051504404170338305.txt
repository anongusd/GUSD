@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/MerBQNOLsN pointless to build up a military beyond policing the nation's like Africa and the middle East that are still at war with eachother. Work together with all the superpowers to create a unified world.
@realDonaldTrump Everyone deserves peace in life and death. We never asked to be born we were just created. And we deserve to be taken care of fully because we have the capabilities to do so.
@realDonaldTrump I heard you don't like to read but this ones important. I would much rather drink the juice than continue to be a burden on society. And I'm not the only one. This would take off huge burdens on the system, and create revenue. And its what the people want. https://t.co/VN0tRIod4c
@AOC I know the rich want to be super rich but that needs to take a backseat to the health of the system
@AOC And the rich need to be taxed their full wealth. Especially because they are probably doing the most damage. They need to pick up after their companies.
@AOC But remind the poor of the necessity of keeping their population low because we can't stress our system.
@AOC Billionaires are interested in basic income, so lower the food cost and then give basic wage to survive off of and an earned wage when someone works a job, this will allow the rich to stay rich and the poor to be taken care of.

@SenatorLankford It's in case of ill mothers or ill children. Let's spare them an ill life. Our system can barely sustain the healthy ones
@AOC They need to be held responsible, look at the trash, they created this mess.
@AOC When it comes to hitting them where it hurts is going to come, and should..in the form of green business, because it's time they are held to a strict standard that is good for the planet. But I already messaged everyone about that info too...
@AOC It's also good in the face of climate change and getting food to people in their backyards. Organic so it would improve the neighborhoods health and lower the cost of healthcare. working with billionaires and finding great affordable ways to take care of everyone works for all.
@AOC Will allen greenhouses. Fish and greens so much to lessen the burden of snap, and create surplus to sell to lessen cost of running. It would be really cheap to allocate government land for them and hire people that need jobs. It's been proven to be therapeutic for inmates.
@AOC We all need to stop being enemies. They want to work with us, so figure something out and propose it. I already messaged all of Senate a plan that would feed everyone organic for the cheapest. But got told it was a dumb idea. Ugh I'll write up a plan for everyone...again

@realDonaldTrump Shut downs are stupid trump, they don't prove or do shit besides punish the people...dont do it again
@realDonaldTrump Just hire security to protect them while in shutdown mode

@realDonaldTrump With one side of the journey being closer to the sun and getting closer because of the gravity and at the same time being shot out far from the sun explaining the cold?
@realDonaldTrump Isn't the reason for the extreme temperatures because as earth rounds the sun it is coming closer and being shot out far. Explaining the extremes? Like isn't it on an oval rotation more than curcular?

@realDonaldTrump My rent is 640$ snap in oregon only covers 3 months out of 3 years. And people treat u like crap when on snap. I have to depend on boyfriends for a decent life. It's not right.
@realDonaldTrump Trump, idk what to do I only make 600$ a month on disability and ssi. Can u raise disability to living wage or legalize assisted suicide so you guys don't have to pay for us anymore and we don't have to live the poverty life anymore.
@Dreyers @NestleTollHouse Can you make a cheesecake banana pumpkin ice cream with cookie dough carmel and gram cracker It's delish.

@realDonaldTrump Trump, what's the deal with your state and that new abortion ruling? Are they going to use the dead babies organs for other babies? Can they still do so after that lethal injection to the full term babies? Why else would a mom carry a baby to full term to kill it?

@realDonaldTrump Since before I was born the government sold us people out. They give us the bare minimum to keep us from revolting. We are the slave labour to satan. To greed,manipulation,lust,provoking,the media..everything that surrounds me. Yet they want me to stay pure?
@realDonaldTrump U done nothing do better

@realDonaldTrump There's better ways to help those girls
@realDonaldTrump Did u know a bunch of sickos shipped in foreign young girls to marry here in the us. In one of these states that allow child marriage. How would you feel if your daughter was married at those ages?
@realDonaldTrump Bub? When ya gunna end child marriage?

@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP https://t.co/VPKRoXtaXj	Great negotiating trump👍
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Can we end the shutdown now? This deal takes care of the people and children now. We need to build the wall. America is like a castle you need to protect. A wall makes it hard for them, they have to really work at it to come over illegally.
@realDonaldTrump Great negotiating trump❤👍 awesome can we end this shutdown now?	https://t.co/VPKRoXtaXj	Great negotiating trump👍

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Be smart, be like canada
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And were left poor and without jobs.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Canada is smart. It came up with a way to keep their own money, like Britain. Legalizing Pot makes it so the jobs stay in Canada and the money is spent in Canada and it stays in canada. Genius. It's not reliant on foreign money like we are with china. Our roller flies there...
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Americans love warm weather
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Then we wouldn't need a wall. But do it environmentally savvy.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We coulda sent all the extra dairy meat and produce down there. Because that's what family does when one of us is in trouble. And were all family
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And think Trump. Ur so business savvy. Why don't you and your buddies go into Latin America and build it up like america. I'm sure that's what Canada would do if they were south of us. And it's a good idea. More money, more problems, but better on average
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP But really pelosi, think of it this way. As the boarder is now. A large number of people could get through and cause havoc here. Think lady.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP People get paid off to look the other way so we need something. Think u guys...come on! My brothers and sisters and their kids are going through hard times right now, think faster!
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP If u don't build the wall come up with another plan. Can you do sensors and cameras instead? Would that be chaper?
@realDonaldTrump Honestly I keep thinking about that story in the bible with the king the baby and the two women. Which one of you care about the people more to end this foolishness. But like typical politics people are expendable
@realDonaldTrump I keep thinking of like the workers as the kids and nancy and you like the parents. And you guys are fighting and neglecting the kids. Bad parenting, bad politics, same same.
@realDonaldTrump Pot seems to be the healthiest thing out of our options
I really want a sauce ball sandwhich 😍 wawa is what I crave
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP P.s. you guys are like the worst politicians. I personally want the wall but i want my fellow citizen to be paid way more. One of you have to budge. For the sake of the people.
@realDonaldTrump P.s. u guys are like the worst politicians ever one of you have to budge for the sake of the people. Figure it out. I personally want a wall, but I want my fellow citizen to have the shit they need WAY more
@realDonaldTrump Mushrooms, the coca plant, cactus juice. Did you know the south Americans chew on the leaf to get energy while they work? Kinda like caffeen pills now? Which is healthier?
@realDonaldTrump Hey trump, this war on drugs. We all do something to cope. Life sux no matter how good it is. If you geniuses find or develop a safe recreational drug then I'm sure we'd take it...
@realDonaldTrump Legalize weed already! It's been proven to even help opioid addicts. Take the business away from the cartels and give it to those hippy kids that go to college to grow weed organically.
@MyStraightTalk Straight talk. I love you. I do. Thank you for making cell phone use more affordable. Seriously from all of my heart❤customer for life.
@sixers @NBCSPhilly @NBAonTNT @975TheFanatic Why r u guys playing joel? Can't u tell he's hurting. this is a game not the world. Gesus guys.
@realDonaldTrump Can u put sensors along the wall so we can know which part of the wall there's movement and send our patrols to. Maybe cameras too.
@Gillette Your putting mass quantities of junk out in the world, responsible business would figure out what to do post use. Be responsible, foster business responsibility.
@Gillette Keep going in the right direction. What about making your products recyclable? What about collection bins so your customers can give you your product back and you can find a way to keep it from going in the landfill...
@Gillette But media pushes sex, alcohol, drugs, smoking, unhealthy food, and other nonsense on the population all to make a buck. Sold your soul to the devil.
@Gillette This world can change for the better if more commercials were like this. If media were controlled by people with morals. Our world wouldn't be such a mess. True story. We could change the world in a blink if we had moral media.
@Gillette Dear men who are upset over this commercial, get it together  because society is sick of your shit
@Gillette Gillette ur commercial is awesome. We need more media showing our people the right way to be because mtv has just been teaching us to be slutty drunks.
@Natebham @Gillette So true, Satan don't want no woke people in his kingdom.
@Gillette Dear gillete, your commercial is AWESOME!
@EpicReviewGuys Did it work? I'm a girl, I want to use this for my greys...
@Ocasio2018_ Lastly can you work with other leaders like canada, switzerland, the Netherlands to come up with an education and healthcare plan for america?
@Ocasio2018_ Also, will u do anything about this? I know bringing them to America will help them have a better life but can we achieve this without the sexwork...https://t.co/HeELPYYbHt
@Ocasio2018_ It's good to combat the hep c outbreaks the homeless are known for and the trash problem. Texas employes their homeless to pick up trash. We need a way to intergrate these people in our society. They are the ones separating the recycle from the trash, we need them just as much.
@Ocasio2018_ Also Portland is dealing with their homeless in a great way. First they allow them to form their tent communities, and they go in with social services, showers, portapotty, they also build small home communities for them and lastly they are building more affordable housing.
@AOC @AP And I'm totally down with ur lament terms and slang talk. Your actually representing a huge portion of our population who doesn't understand what the fuck the gov is saying when they use all those terms and codes. Seriously they do it on purpose.
@AOC @AP The mega corporations would have competition and take a hit, but those guys are doing the bare minimum to take care of their slaves and planet so fuck em. Let's create a system without them.
@AOC @AP What do you think about greenhouses like Will Allens at the center of poverty stricken communities? Where the people can go to get organic food, work, learn, and gather. 3 acres would produce over 1million lbs for our impoverished people to sell or consume.
@Ocasio2018_ And the Obama's..can u all form a team like trumps and get stuff done
@Ocasio2018_ Your young blood, sanders brain and Clinton's know how. Can u three work together to take down the giant
@Ocasio2018_ Get together with sanders..
@Ocasio2018_ KEEP FIGHTING! WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE U IN THE WHITEHOUSE TO MAKE SOME REAL CHANGE! I HOPE MORE PEOPLE LIKE U TAKE OFFICE❤
@realDonaldTrump Which president was that? The stupid one that let all the mental patients out of the hospital and out on our streets?https://t.co/flQ4KF5zL0
@realDonaldTrump And if I'm reborn I'll kill myself again until I can't come back anymore. Or until God comes and ends our suffering.
@realDonaldTrump CAN YOU LEGALIZE ASSISTED SUICIDE ALREADY! THIS WORLD SUCKS! WE WANT OUT!
@realDonaldTrump Dude seriously idk why I bother. You guys are too stupid to change easily. You have to constantly be banged in the head over and over to get stuff done. It's exhausting idk how Bernie does it. That guy deserves to be president.
@realDonaldTrump Wow trump. Looking at the ticket to work...u pay people for this shit? No wonder half the population of working is taking care of the other half that don't work, and I heard a new stat that states the following...this true? Or fake media? https://t.co/v6Fw7NLIpS
@realDonaldTrump These people who cant work need a way to survive. The industries can take a cut back in order to make living possible for the undesirables. Or they can keep being greedy and watch the poverty population get worse. I bet they chose the latter.
@realDonaldTrump Hey trump, the ticket to work program is bullshit. It doesn't help us. U guys need to come up with a new way to get half the nonworking population off the handouts of the working half.
@p1vey @DaveWeir2 @evtme @SenSanders The money is supposed to flow, that's how this works, unfortunately it's true the wealthy are hoarding it for their own growing families and space ventures. And its going to other nations.
@SenSanders Harris or clinton. I think it shouldn't be all dems or all repub. Vice and pres can be two different parties. I think it would work better this way.
@SenSanders Bernie I think you would have better luck running with a female as ur vp for next year, make it a team deal to work together to make the country right.
@realDonaldTrump Trump we need dems and repubs to run the house, women and men. I know this is out of the box but what if Harris was ur vp next year? A female dem and male repub running the house. Seems like what we need. We created the rules we can change them to fit us. is that a too evolved?
@realDonaldTrump Have the gov. set aside some land create a way for it to make easy money&amp;hire and house the homeless on it Like the prison programs but they have more freedom Growing flowers,vegetables,making jewelry, painting,knitting...they struggle with society so make society easier for them
@realDonaldTrump Trump..give the numbers for those unemployed...its in the millions. What are we going to do about that?
@Ocasio2018_ https://t.co/3vWLXtnUW8
@Ocasio2018_ 😄❤u. I hope u go far so bad. So many people are asleep and blinded.
@SenSanders @Ocasio2018_ Bernie? How do you do it? I'm new to the fight but its so exhausting. All these people we have to get on the same boat to keep our planet and species healthy. But bernie. Its an uphill battle. Atleast u fought it. Good try❤
@Ocasio2018_ The top richest deserve to pay more in taxes because they make the biggest footprint with their products and life style. And they aren't cleaning up after themselves so we need to tax them. Now if they go green and do their part to clean up the planet then give small tax breaks
@elonmusk Also double up on that tea😴
@elonmusk Dude I don't know how much time we have left on this planet but I want you all to make sure u are content when you die. Live your life do what makes you happy without hurting yourself or others.		https://t.co/LPbSjLde3e

@realDonaldTrump Dude this could easily be fixed. Come on. https://t.co/6t1zCwiu7N
@piersmorgan They are fucked up and need help. And we could do it. Extinguish the poverty class. But the powers that be aren't smart enough. Maybe in the future.
@piersmorgan They r just trying to survive. That's why they sell their children to slavery and prostitution or drugs. It's hard making it in the lower class poverty scale. And they are on drugs and alcohol to ease their pain.
@piersmorgan The few that do are exceptions to the rule because there are millions more that dont
@piersmorgan Anyways..those people "faking" it are exhausted, have fucked up, are worn out, and work for pennies, have no education and usually come from a broken family. U try coming out of those circumstances unscathed
@piersmorgan It's like trying to get yourself to take rat poison. But u need it so u don't talk to voices.
@piersmorgan Some people are mentally stronger than others. For example I flipplin crack all the time now ever since I was abused. And I've been dealing with it for 5 years now. My meds are really bad for my body so it's really hard taking them so I try to only take them when I go manic.
@piersmorgan Those people who others think are trying to exploit the system and live like welfare queens. No. They are really fucked up in the head obviously.
@piersmorgan And he thinks some people fake it, which hey people...there might be some people out there that try to fake it. But in doing so actually show they are mentally ill because no "normal" "healthy" person would fake being crazy. Not unless they were undercover, or an actor.
@piersmorgan Ya whoa wait u guys. U twitter crazies and attackers without thinking rationally. all he did was agree that the industry is exploiting people with mental disabilities.
@realDonaldTrump Mr! This is what all businesses need to do pronto! ..https://t.co/5FznVEXPgH
@realDonaldTrump To all creators: when you create ask yourself these questions: 1. Can I pay my workers decent? 2. Can I make it last? 3. Can I make it as eco friendly as possible? You need to also figure out a plan for ur product after use. If you cant do all these things..dont create it.
@IKEAUSA Ikea!  I LOVE YOU https://t.co/INo0wzHA5a
@realDonaldTrump Trump. Another pressing matter...what the fuh is this??..https://t.co/kERkTYKs8J
@realDonaldTrump ..did you know that Monsanto inserted the human ghonnorea gene into their produce and it causes digestive, reproductive, and one other disorder? U get to eat organic produce. Gmo produce taste terrible compared to.
I hate aristocrats they r greedy and selfish and snobby ugh sux that they ruin the world. I don't want that gene
I can't enjoy it. I can't enjoy life when poverty and all the problems of the world are constantly in my face and I don't see anyone doing anything about any of it. For generations these people in the whitehouse have been and not much has been done. I'm so dissapointed
@MarlboroEU That's why we smoke and drink because we are slaves to a life that turns us from innocent to mean and works us till we die
@MarlboroEU https://t.co/XL69FXmDWR
@MarlboroEU Hey marlboro...can u just switch to doing this...doesnt cause lung cancer and can ease anxiety for all those emotional smokers out there❤but can u make it affordable plz? All these businesses are killing us. Everything cost so much and we don't get paid that well to enjoy life
@realDonaldTrump Trump, Australia and Canada both have websites with jobs for mentally disabled people. But America doesnt. The website that social security disability has for jobs aren't easy jobs for the disabled.
@realDonaldTrump There's so many people that don't want to be alive. please legalize assisted suicide for us. I'm disabled and don't want to live but can't kill myself i don't want to be on gov. Assistance anymore Don't want to be taking from society. I want to be gone. And I'm not the only one
@realDonaldTrump And while ur worried about the drugs coming in at the southern boarder are u increasing inspectors at port? China's drugs are way worse than south and central americas drugs. What are you going to do about that?
@realDonaldTrump Can't we just pass this along and vote already? If America votes yes we build it if no we dont. But we don't spend days on one flipping topic. Move on u guys. Jesus I can't wait till my generation takes over.
@realDonaldTrump Want to build a wall between us and mexico?
@elonmusk Can't facebook team up with social security&amp;DNA sequencing to create an online platform where Americas can log in and vote on policy in our government. It would be fantastic because it could share videos&amp;info about what's going on so that we are an educated&amp;well democratized unit
@realDonaldTrump U guys waste all the time and resources in the world bickering. What do the people want?
@realDonaldTrump Trump, watching this crap on tv. Do what the Brits did have a vote and let the american people vote on wall or no wall. Done spoke for its self
@elonmusk When you go to mars will u create a poor class? Or will everyone have comfortable lives?
@realDonaldTrump Why didnt the government do this? Why do the people have to do everything? Why do the people have to clean up capitalistic mess? What good is the government?https://t.co/yQWoPkDSJu
@realDonaldTrump Are you ever going to address the pollution problem?
@realDonaldTrump Okay trump, the wall and job increase. Two things we like. What else. You have too much time in office to just be carrying on with those two "accomplishments" your whole terms. Move on. What are you going to do about child marriage in america? Or legalizing cannabis?
@elonmusk You ever watch "pump!"on oil? Maybe you should. You could take over the automobile industry like they did. Watch it, it's good. https://t.co/4ccJPFyRo0
@elonmusk Sux that 😠 left over gas guzzlers were sent there first. Flipping morals are out the door w some business people 😡 hope u turn it around.
@elonmusk so glad ur going to china. I hope ur cars take off there, they really need help w their pollution. Bring ur solar cells. Design a solar grid for the side of buildings. Ha, nice pic 😂
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/jhn0Pcccf2
@realDonaldTrump Can u mandate these be used in the us: https://t.co/lEO8fGqKkU
@beatsbydre @PostMalone @goSwaeLee Can u make stuff that last a while and then be responsible for the headphones after they are broken by collecting them back so they don't end up in the trash. Whoever creates product and pushes them to the masses should also be 100% responsible for them after they cease working.
@beatsbydre @PostMalone @goSwaeLee https://t.co/TLTZoFxatM
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Okay so u don't believe in global warming. But can we do something better about this trash situation? All these companies are responsible for flooding the market with garbage they need to be responsible for picking up after themselves too.
@RuggedManiac Hey watching you on shark tank. you guys should switch out ur alcohol for smoothies
@Fred_Meyer @SimpleTruth4U Hey dudes love u but my fred meyer only has one choice of onion ring and it's the smallest bag wth
@realDonaldTrump U guys take too long to do anything
@realDonaldTrump Trump, why can't the houses vote on Twitter so everyone can be tuned in. All in favor of ending child marriage say I..and then all of u can log in and vote and the count can be passed. And all of us can be tuned in. Or cannabis, legalize it..or recycling..improve it..etc...
@realDonaldTrump Like seriously email all the members right now and vote to end child marriage and enforce edible rings and bags. Booms one day shit done whole world changed okay next. But fuh u guys..nothing done for decades
@realDonaldTrump Like why do we still have child marriages in america? Why are we still using plastic rings and bags instead of the edible ones created? Ud think you can all just message eachother about this stuff and get it done in a day and change the course of our pollution and lives of minors
@elonmusk @Tesla Like the rockets. Space travel is a luxury not a necessity. Taking care of earth is a nesessity. Our priorities are screwed up. And were polluting earth with the wrong inventions.
@elonmusk @Tesla I don't get it. The goal was for companies to build the best most affordable electric car for the market. And they have done that. I don't understand what tesla keeps pushing for? They make a luxury vehicle in a time where luxury money is scarce.
@JoelEmbiid @MarkelleF Hey you! We waited outside in the cold hail for you guys to sign signatures for us. The least you coulda done was sign for us since u just sat there doing nothing. What about the fans man these nerds spend all their money and time on stupid autographs from you guys. Shame on u.
@Apple or a new year's scene with friends or family...its a great feature.
@Apple hey apple, why don't u do a commercial with a college student and it's her birthday and her grandparents, parents, and siblings are all on the group facechat singing happy birthday to her...or a child cancer patient in a hospital bed facechatting with her friends..
@elonmusk @Tesla Also can u talk to mark about multiple contacts on FaceTime so we can groupvidchat. I think ur the only movement that is actually connected to the rest of us
@elonmusk @Tesla ..thought I sent this..try it. Sleep pills cause dementia and Alzheimer's also..take folate. All good for the brain. Keep well musk. Happy 2019. https://t.co/CRLA4uiCW8
@elonmusk @Tesla Do you know anyone at google maps? Theyre app only allows you to save two locations, home &amp; work. I want to be able to save way more. That way when I'm driving I can say "Okay google doctor's office, or katies house.."etc. That'd be good for voice commands for autonomous cars too
@elonmusk @Tesla A lot of sleeping pills cause Alzheimer's or dementia. We don't want you getting those. These two are the healthiest sleep combo I've found. I also smoke half a joint before bed. But try these two together and see if u have luck. Happy New Year Elon. https://t.co/OGpSkMAyv1
@creditkarma Dudes what is up with your terrible commercial with that weird face monster on the airplane. Like dude not a good commercial.
@realDonaldTrump It's not up to the consumer anymore we have no buying power because we're all going through financial issues. And the market is overflown with products that are bad for us and our environment. And it's the businesses responsible for it all.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/jRGtUpUrct		Wow just  watched ur commercial. Powerful. Spot on to all our issues. But geesh wish the whole world would get on page. Wish ur message would get out more. To #mcdonalds and #gellete #starbucks and #walmart..everyone needs to do better.
@SAP @GlobalGoalsUN https://t.co/2XpMj17vcl		Wow just  watched ur commercial. Powerful. Spot on to all our issues. But geesh wish the whole world would get on page. Wish ur message would get out more. To #mcdonalds and #gellete #starbucks and #walmart..everyone needs to do better.
@realDonaldTrump As for Syria can we just have our secret vans drive around listening for Isis and our special forces guys go in and take them out quietly. Instead of dropping bombs.
@realDonaldTrump Can we have all companies be responsible for the collection and recycle of their own products. This waste problem must be solved.
@realDonaldTrump Because it shapes humanity negatively. Not journalism. They are for truth and justice
@realDonaldTrump Also the monster/beast isn't the media journalist. They're typical disposition is for truth not the opposite. Media entertainment however needs it's morals conduct and intentions looked at.

@realDonaldTrump We are killing ourselves. Idk why god created us stupid to our own demise. But I challenge us to move past it. Do all that is necessary to turn this around.
@realDonaldTrump Donald..the monster is us. Consumerism, capitalism is gluttony
@realDonaldTrump Trump, what the fuck. You have to do something about this monster..https://t.co/QC7f0x61u8
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump When are you getting these edible plastic bags across the nation so it ends our footprint on that matter too. Agh I know ur busy but come on!😣
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump ...u could make a deal with the companies that it's either healthy ring or no ring. That will reduce our footprint on that matter.
@realDonaldTrump also there are only two beer companies that are using these beer rings that sea animals can eat instead of choke on. Why don't we get it to allll the beer companies? You coulda took a chunk of the budget bought a edible ring factory, hired Americans...
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump All nations need to stop and take care of their own people and land. And once we build up then we can deal with the retard nations.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/bAdblOrgMm
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump ...Actually scrap the gifts and balloons they are bad for the enviornment. But we can do flowers and cards those are healthy and compostable
@realDonaldTrump It would be really positive for our people.
@realDonaldTrump It can be a where the people think about those they want to say sorry to. A day of healing for the people. We have a day of thanks why not a of forgiveness?
@realDonaldTrump Trump, I just came up with a really good idea. We have holidays for presents, thanks, the dead, jesus, rememberance, all sorts of holidays. I think it's about time for a holiday of Forgiveness. Halmark can print im sorry cards, balloons, gifts...

@elonmusk Mmm have u had mochiko chicken or pork or chicken cutlet with curry and rice..mmm.
@elonmusk We will kill ourselves off due to our pollution before we find another home. And if we did settle mars, once earth dies so does mars.
...Be sad about our earth and people having bad lives and just be thankful I have a good one and enjoy it. That's all that s in my power.
I had hope in elon, Oprah, the obamas, even trump. But nothing will be done about the issues we face because of money, and I just have to live with that and move on...
@BillGates @TEDTalks It's people like u elon trump Obama's Oprah that the populace had hope in. But nothing is really being done. It's a shame all the resources and no brain to change the world. It's just about money.
@TalentiGelato Is there anyway you guys could collect your containers back for reuse? So we could cut down on the pollution
@Drake @RED Hey just watched gods plan. I know ways that money could help a lot further. Invest in will Allen and help spread community greenhouses and organic food across america.
@trixiemattel @SKYYVodka @JohnCena Ya watched it fire
@elonmusk How can we shift oil subsidies to elon subsidies and get your solar roof and electric cars everywhere?
@realDonaldTrump instead of giving oil subsidies transfer them to elon musk subsidies to get his solar roof and electric vehicles off the ground.
@realDonaldTrump But America seriously needs to sit the leaders of south America down and be like what the fuck..ur fucking up. And get their livelihoods started back up again because what's going on down there is atrocious
@realDonaldTrump I want the wall after the migrants came up here and tried to force themselves in throwing rocks at our forces. Fuck yea I want a wall now.
@EDt0aMl07NjDAMP @realDonaldTrump We take care of a lot of people even around the world. while you dont and just hate on other nations. I hope someday Iran does become great.
@EDt0aMl07NjDAMP @realDonaldTrump Was Iran ever great? Sounds like to me a bunch of people in the sand with goats. Who are so religious and irrational they hurt people over it. Developed countries are great because we don't have to shit in a hole in the ground.
@realDonaldTrump We have resources to make world peace. But the main shakers of the world dont want it. They want to be rich even if that means making others poor and ruining the planet. Sometimes I wonder if the top rulers are even human at all.
@JeffBezos Bezos, okay u own whole foods now, can you make a fast food drive through like McDonald's  with healthfood like falafel, bean chillies, blackbean burgers, avocado toast, health smoothies etc. I hate cooking but i want to eat healthy. Please!
@NASA Also with the problems of antibiotic resistant space bacteria, could this pose a threat to our health?
@NASA As lovely as this is, what does the air quality look like here on earth after years of frequent and mass scaled rocket travel? Can we try to find the cleanest transportation possible.

@realDonaldTrump @mauriciomacri We have other great nations doing great things! Why can't we follow their lead!
@realDonaldTrump we need to plant more trees everywhere!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS To be born it's thousands of dollars. To die it's thousands of dollars. To live it's a lifetime of slavery. And everything we make makes us sick. There is something wrong here.
@thehill To be born it's thousands of dollars. To die it's thousands of dollars. To live it's a lifetime of slavery. And everything we make makes us sick. There is something wrong here.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Everything we create destroys a million times more. To create paper we must destroy trees. To create medicine we need to pollute animals earth and people. We create for comfort but we're not comfortable.
@elonmusk don't u remember the colonial and the natives and how sick they got when they interacted
@elonmusk Put ur efforts into earth. Please!
@elonmusk Elon..stop polluting earth, every time these spaceships go up. and stop trying to go into space. Please. There's no good possible outcome.	             -God
@realDonaldTrump @mauriciomacri Please read my twitter..ull understand it
@realDonaldTrump cbd is just like taking a benadryl.
@realDonaldTrump I wish u could look at my fb page..such good ideas from the future...locked myself out. Not sure if I'll bother with anotherone
@realDonaldTrump the real leaders must be in Britain because they are the only state that can see the outcome of what has been built
@realDonaldTrump The poor population that is
@realDonaldTrump The population has exceeded 1 million..into the 100millions irresponsible leadership
@realDonaldTrump Wanna be like venezuela or africa?
@realDonaldTrump Wanna be like kim l Jung and starve people?
@realDonaldTrump Do you really want to be a class of rich people in a sea of poor? That's stupid
@realDonaldTrump You don't need me to tell u
@realDonaldTrump You have had plenty of experts talking to u guys tons of economist
@realDonaldTrump That will create jobs and fuel our economy...but the economy really doesn't work. Are you going to rectify it or not?
@realDonaldTrump Buy a few green factories with gov money and be a lead industry in the green movement
@realDonaldTrump You can add more jobs by legalizing cbd. Or starting a major recycling industry?
@realDonaldTrump We gotta do something about the doctor's they have 15min to see a patient and run out the door. Focused on the next patient while listening to me. When did medicine become this
@realDonaldTrump and keep moving forward in a positive direction
@realDonaldTrump everyone needs to forgive themselves for the sins they have commited
@realDonaldTrump God is real he's in heaven. Waiting for us to take the chains off ourselves. He waiting and he loves us all very much.
@realDonaldTrump go beyond your religion go beyond your beliefs
@realDonaldTrump it's up to us to go to heaven or stay here. Do good
@realDonaldTrump Satan is using me to get to god. God won't come back because we keep killing it. We Must bring world peace ourselves
@realDonaldTrump doesn't it suck to have to marry for money
@realDonaldTrump hey trump..if your mom, wives, or daughters didn't have to marry for money..like a lot of other women of this world because we can't afford to take care of ourselves...its very hard on minimum wage
@realDonaldTrump And I would really appreciate it if u legalized cbd for the military because right now they are decompressing with alcohol and that's way worse
@realDonaldTrump My coworker was on pills and heroin and by switching to pot she stopped the drugs
@realDonaldTrump Cbd is actually helping me quit pot. And I heard it's helping people with opioid problems
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Trump, thc is bad it makes psychosis. But cbd is relaxing without the bad. They need something for the pain of living.
@realDonaldTrump Reality check: Satan hates me because I believe in God and I'm human so he tortures my mind all day. And God is keeping me safe while this is going on
@realDonaldTrump I know u don't have to play a game w God but the bad guy convinces you that your doing good by doing crazy actions..its sad
@realDonaldTrump Pray and educate urself
@realDonaldTrump It's like a weird game that schizophrenics play w God and satan. Now that I said it he'll do the opposite. He's always trying to thwart gods plan. Just stand strong in doing good
@realDonaldTrump But that's what the bad guy wanted. Anyways all's okay I wish u guys all well
@realDonaldTrump Hey I'm really sorry w all the tweets. The bible was written by the bad guy and god. The bad guy put in all the bad stuff so we'd fight and kill each other and harm God every time he comes back. I didn't want to scare the public
@revestor @YouTube But I would def pay 99$ a month and thank you for making readily available list of cheap market homes. Thank you very much u deserve to be well off
@revestor @YouTube Hey man..i just saw u on shark tank..i think it's a genius idea and that the only reason they don't like it is because ur taking money away from the real estate companies.
