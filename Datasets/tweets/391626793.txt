@DMR4USSenateCA the problem is their power, the money just comes with the territory. Rich people aren't inherently bad
@DMR4USSenateCA no. It's not a rich/poor issue. It's an incumbency vs grassroots issue.
@DMR4USSenateCA running for office is voluntary, no one is forced to do it. By implying only "poor" people will run you miss the point.
@DMR4USSenateCA the answer is subjective, do you think what's going on in D.C. is acceptable or not? This is our reality. I would argue no.
@DMR4USSenateCA I never said just because so I'm not sure where you're getting that from.
@DMR4USSenateCA term limits automate democracy, and allow normal, average citizens to serve, not just the one with the most money.
@DMR4USSenateCA people have been trying to "vote them out" for decades and doesn't work when over 90% are re-elected at the Fed level
@DMR4USSenateCA why do I want them? A career as a legislator is the exact opposite of what representation is supposed to do
@DMR4USSenateCA I'm well aware, no need to go all caps. It's just counterproductive to encourage memberd to serve a limit of 24yrs...
@DMR4USSenateCA just understand that avg congressional tenure is around 11 years, so anything high for a House member is quite unnecessary
RT @karldickey: ‚ÄúFlorida adds 10,000 medical marijuana patients since June‚Äù via Abe Aborava of WMFE ‚Äì Florida had 16,760 patients... https:‚Ä¶
@DMR4USSenateCA however, I'm a strong believer in the one term limit elsewhere because it abolishes seniority.		i.e. Pres of Mex &amp; Gov of VA
@DMR4USSenateCA for Congress, I've advocated for three terms in the House and two in the Senate. I also would not alter the 22 Amendment
@DMR4USSenateCA exactly, a lifetime. Though it may a limit, that is not a regular rotation in office.
@DMR4USSenateCA that is far more than enough. With House tenure averaging 10 years how can you call that a limit?
