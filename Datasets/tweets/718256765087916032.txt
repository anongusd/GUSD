@realDonaldTrump Part 3 and we dont even need to be our own country. @realDonaldTrump yes! Secure the border! Protect our people protect our interests, protect our freedom. Its only moral.
@realDonaldTrump Part 2 yes, the neighbor would take security measures such as law contact, build a fence. So whats so different about our border? Its the same. But a much bigger scale, if we keep allowing people to cross our borders illegally then we should just allow anyone to cross abd we dont
@realDonaldTrump What happens if i were to cross my neighbors property line without their permission? Let alone bring drugs, raoe the family, steal, etc. Its immoral and frankly against the law. If it keeps happening that neighbor would eventually take security matters. Fence, cameras etc?
@realDonaldTrump Yes sir, i myself understand completely and am 100% on board for the wall. Just like any country you want to visit? Go through the necessary process not just cross our border. Its the same as trespassing, you go on your neighbors property what happens? Right?
@BuckeyeCuti Oh ok!! Thanks for replying. Hope you two are ok! Best of health, best of life!
I need help everyone i am going to lose my apartment if i dont come up with 2500 in 3 days ðŸ˜¥

@BuckeyeCuti My goodness didnt know he's passed. So sorry. May he be in peace. He was a decent man. Never let his fame go to his head. I have now lit a candle. Take care!!
@RealJamesWoods. For my @potus 2024!!! Sorry but @realDonaldTrump has one more term.
@RealJamesWoods Happy Bday little buddy!!!!
@RealJamesWoods Why are our own People attacking their own President? It just looks so bad on our part. And then the world gets this false brovado about us. My thoughts and prayers are with my @potus the greatest and most open minded president in history. Period.

@cabowabo65 @realDonaldTrump Beautifully written,  your absolutely right and it wouldnt cost Billions of dollars.
@realDonaldTrump Instead of spending billions of dollars for building a border wall,  after the constant " whos gonna pay for it?  MEXICO!! " Campaign why cant we instead take those billions and help our own citizens that are in dire need,  and those you left homeless from you big deals of casino
@emilyisdeadd thank you for the retweet on my gofundme god bless your heart.
@realDonaldTrump Bad buisness,  something you can relate to.  Wgat about all those people who lost jobs and many became homeless when you filed bankruptcy on the Taj Mahal.  Alot peoples lives were ruined still to the day.  Forget Russia our issues at home are more important.
