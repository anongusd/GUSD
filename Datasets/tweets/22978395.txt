“It is far too early to be thinking about” pardons for those involved in the Russia probe. #dooropen
“I’m not above the law. I never want anyone to be above the law,”  Trump says, BUT-“Yes, I do have an absolute power to pardon myself, but I’ll never have to do it becuz I didn’t do anything wrong.”  Says Russia probe is “a made-up fancy” &amp; calls for an investigation of Dems
“There will be more pardons,” Trump says, adding that he’s “thinking about somebody that you all know very well &amp;he went thru a lot&amp; he wasn’t very popular” - reporters asks if it’s OJ- Trump: “No I’m not thinking about OJ.” “I’m thinking about Mohammed Ali”
“Whether you like it or not, and it may not be politically correct, but we have a world to run. And in the G7- which used to be the G8-they threw Russia out-they should let Russia come back in.” Trump talking to reporters on South Lawn before departing for G7
Trump says, “We should have Russia at the negotiating table” referring to G7. “I love our country. I’ve been Russia’s worst nightmare. If Hillary got in, Putin’s probably going, ‘Man, I wish Hillary won’, becuz u see what I do, but...Russia should be in this mtg.”
“That’s a very important leaker,” Trump says when asked about fmr SenIntel staffer Jim Wolfe, indicted for false statemts to feds for allegedly giving non-public info to press. DOJ seized reporter records in investigatn. “I believe strongly in freedom of the press,” Trump says
