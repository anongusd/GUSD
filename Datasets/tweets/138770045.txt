I am grateful to my colleagues who have called for due process before weighing judgment. I would urge them to continue to do so for any Member accused of wrongdoing. Basic fairness requires no less.
I‚Äôll never allow that legacy ‚Äì a legacy I owe to my father   John Conyers, Sr., who integrated labor unions, or my two amazing sons John III &amp; Carl and my loving wife Monica, and the extraordinary people of Detroit ‚Äì to be cast aside, or these causes to be in any way diminished.
I am proud and fortunate to be part of a legacy of more than 50 years of fighting for civil rights and making our country more equitable and just.
I cannot in good conscience allow these charges to undermine my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus, and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives.
But I have come to believe that my presence as Ranking Member on the Committee would not serve these efforts while the Ethics Committee investigation is pending.
These challenges could not be more pressing in the face of an Administration that cares little for the rule of law and a President whose actions and conduct cheapens our discourse every day.
To be clear, I would like very much to remain as Ranking Member. There is still much work to be done on core concerns like securing civil rights, enacting meaningful criminal justice reform, and protecting access to the ballot box.
I deny these allegations, many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger. I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics.
After careful consideration and in light of the attention drawn by recent allegations made against me, I have notified the Democratic Leader of my request to step aside as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee during the investigation of these matters.

The @HouseGOP keep spewing #AlternativeFacts about its #GOPTaxScam. They just want to give a tax break to the companies that are sending American jobs overseas.		How does this help folks at home? How does it help American families? How does it grow American jobs?
FACT: 36 MILLION middle class families would see their taxes go up under the #GOPTaxScam. 		@HouseGOP, you simply can‚Äôt call a tax bill that is nearly 50% giveaways to the top 1 percent ‚Äúpro-Middle Class.‚Äù That sounds like #fakenews to me.
#HR4140, No Unconstitutional Strike on #NorthKorea Act, w over 70 bipartisan cosponsors in the House &amp; Senate, would underscore the longstanding Constitutional principle of Congress‚Äô sole power to declare war &amp; authorize preemptive military action. I urge its passage w/o delay.
Finally, @realDonaldTrump must publicly acknowledge that he is constitutionally-barred from launching a preemptive war without Congressional approval.		Acknowledging this reality will reduce tensions and provide momentum for diplomatic efforts.		https://t.co/f81f9QnK7R
It is now @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs responsibility to control his impulsive behavior and give diplomacy a chance to work. 		Every reckless comment heightens tensions and makes a negotiated solution more difficult.
Despite his unhelpful comments, I am quite encouraged to see that the @WhiteHouse has dispatched negotiators to talk with #NorthKorea.  		Pro-diplomacy Members of Congress stand ready to support these efforts however we can.		https://t.co/lQmRaMAEL9
Pleased that @realDonaldTrump was able to avoid reckless threats during his Asia trip, as I urged him to do.		Unfortunately, he cont‚Äôd to claim that military options remain on the table in his speech today.		There can be no military solution to a dispute w a nuclear armed nation.

Rather than tweeting reckless statements, @realDonaldTrump should spend his Asia trip searching for a diplomatic resolution to this conflict
The Framers chose Congress to be the body that declares war and authorizes military action. This legislation reinforces that intent.
Bipartisan and bicameral, H.R 4140 prevents the expenditure of funds for any kind of first strike against North Korea.
As @realDonaldTrump embarks on his trip to Asia, we want to remind him that he cannot attack North Korea without approval from Congress
It is crucial that Congress reaffirm its constitutional authority over approving any first strike against North Korea.

Trump chose un-American white supremacists &amp; all who give hatred a voice. This Admin. must reverse its pattern of discriminatory positions.
Bannon should have never been in the WH. However, his removal will not undo the damage or reconcile the hate-filled agenda of Trump Admin.
Steve Bannon is the standard-bearer for the worst instincts in American society. He gave white supremacy, misogyny+anti-Semitism a platform.
Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and continues to embolden these extremist groups and ideals.
