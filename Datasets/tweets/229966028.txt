Avoid downed power or utility lines; they may be live with deadly voltage. Stay away and report them to your power or utility company. https://t.co/YPz9DLj4Nk
Avoid plugging generators into electric outlets or hooking them directly to your home's electrical system. https://t.co/UpE0CdRybB
If you don't have electricity &amp; are using a generator, remember: NEVER use it inside, even with windows open. Carbon monoxide will kill you. https://t.co/HRxBH4ujB2
