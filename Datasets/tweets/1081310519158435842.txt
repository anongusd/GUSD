Managing forests takes time and commitment of resources. 3 week CR’s don’t provide either.
Timely, consistent appropriations will do the most to help the FS do #morebetterfaster
In the last decade, it’s taken 41 CR’s, 10 omnibus bills, and ONE full year Interior spending bill to keep the lights on @forestservice There have been three shutdowns in the last 6 years. This is no way to run a railroad (or anything else).

A tale of two forests. One is healthier and more resilient to wildfire and insects. The other is not.  It's another reason why FFRC advocates to give federal land agencies the tools and resources they need to accelerate active management on federal forests. https://t.co/ud20a8Olx3
