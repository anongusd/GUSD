@MalcolmNance I am a proud follower of @BreakingBrown and @tonetalks for the past 2 years.  Not a bot.  I disagree with Harris because of her record as a DA and AG! Booker is to closely linked to Corporate contributions.

@rolandsmartin @YouTube The reason #ADOS is important is because her record as DA and AG has hurt a lot of Blacks.  You dont get to escape that just because you went to an HBCU.

@RepVeasey My biggest concerns for the Black community are Mass Incarceration, The Racial Wealth Gap and Reparations.  Can you tell me what you are doing to address these issues?  Thanks.
@SandyDarity @NewYorker @DarrickHamilton I really wish they would talk more about the Federal Jobs Guarantee.  The Baby bonds are wonderful, but they will not close the racial wealth gap.  That is what we need to focus on.  Congrats Prof. @SandyDarity

@SonnyBunch I would hope that you would at least mention the truth in your reviews.  To me that is part of the film.  I guess if Dr. King was portrayed by some White actor to have been the leader of the Klan that would have been fine as long as the acting was good.  Do better brother!
@KamalaHarris That is wonderful and I wish them the best.  Do you have any programs that will benefit American Blacks?
