Trump Is Rapidly Reshaping the Judiciary. Here’s How. https://t.co/yXhoFDVO72 https://t.co/JSbxxDY4kF
These kinds of shifts can't solely happen through individual schools or the school board. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
It also means to maintain the race and class structure. More, as a political project, no one is off the hook. The carceral project is bi-partisan. So shifting local politics matter much. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
But the public school system will 1st have to get out of bed with the carceral project, the latter of which is a grossly interlinked system of ​	policing, surveillance, and imprisonment concentrated in the most marginalized sectors of society. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Making structural, economic, administrative, and curricular changes is a start. Those with their feet on the ground -- in the classroom, admin, the school board, local politics, will need to be in conversation and on board. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
What this looks like needs to be dreamed &amp; strategized in community. There's no singular response. Surely, imagining black &amp; brown children as baby criminals and threats to society who may one day be profitable via prison labor is not the way. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
It's not about more black and brown teachers, though that matters. It is about a systemic, structural, institutional, ideological, epistemic, interpersonal, economic, etc. overhaul. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Administratively, there has to be a leveling of school resources. Entire histories must be told, and truthfully. That said, there needs to be a curricular overhaul as well as a fair, just, and equitable capital plan.  #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
What has to happen is quite a bit of disentangling -- black and brown from criminality, and education from the policing and caste system.  #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
and...where black and brown children ​are made the originary locus of unfreedom, the primal, difference, pathology, sin, danger, and American threat?  #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
So the question of what to do about schools that function like prisons, is really a question of what to do about a public school system where slavery/marginalization/criminalization are normative modes of administration, and...  #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Much of what we see today is about maintaining the class structure. This is why abolitionary moves rather than reform are so important. The structural and institutional biases of slavery are prevalent in ALL American institutions. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Schools in their own way are in essence setting up and maintaining not only the structuring of race, but more, the class structure. And that is something we didn't cover last night that is pivotal to this entire conversation. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
This problem is layered because one could say these kinds of divisive practices have already been written to the law -- as policing and its role has and as race and criminalization has. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
The underlying ideology is that black and brown bodies pose an immanent threat to society. Even as young as 3rd grade and earlier. And yes, even in school. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Schools function as tools of Law and Order. ​This sort of policing is rooted in historical aims: 1) to keep black and brown folks in line and 2) maintain the class structure. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Those who have more, get more. Those who have less not only get less but get policed. It is important to note that police aren't in all schools. Law and Order policing tactics are solely for the middle class, the poor, blacks and browns. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Here's the thing, public education is a foundational source of racial marginalization in America. In addition to clear white washing, necessary resources are channeled to schools based upon class location/property taxes. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
What I (TL) wanted to do last night was acknowledge the preschool to prison pipeline through a personal narrative about my son. In the end, we chose another option, which still criminalizes black children, but perhaps less damaging so. #daretodialogue @raviperry @vcuWMNS
Last night I (TL) was on a panel @VCU on Race and Justice in American Life and a student from @vcuWMNS asked about the preschool to prison pipeline. I couldn't fully hear so I somewhat butchered the response. I want to clarify. #daretodialogue @raviperry
