Here are my thoughts on Virginia's historical monuments: https://t.co/gllrv7UlNj
Heather Heyer's memorial service was a moving, uplifting celebration of her life. But still very sad.
The white supremacists and neoNazis who invaded cville espouse reprehensible views that have no redeeming value whatsoever.  Simple as that.
The so-called "Alt-right" isn't part of a legitimate political spectrum. On a scale of 1-10, they are a yellow. https://t.co/Dins6hhIyA
Violence is not an acceptable form of expression https://t.co/b7WY8TCeof
RT @EdForVirginia: Watch @EdWGillespie's full, unedited interview with @NBC29 in Charlottesville yesterday: https://t.co/Yb8ygeWghv
We will emerge from these tragic last few days stronger in our commitment to one another as Virginians. https://t.co/5Llq8ehcZf
RT @Tim_Dodson: Virginia State Police receive applause on the #Charlottesville Downtown Mall https://t.co/jWco3DWlQF
We've seen evil in white supremacist torches and howling neo Naziism.  God in the quiet service &amp; sacrifice of Lt. Cullen, Trooper Bates.
First reading was from 1 Kings.  We don't find the Lord in the wind or the fire, but in a whisper.
We also prayed for Heather Heyer, Lt. Cullen and Trooper Bates.
.@CathyGillespie and I were able to make Mass in Charlottesville at @Incarnation12 to pray for this beautiful city, Commonwealth &amp; country.
Cathy and I were heartbroken to learn of the devastating loss of 2 members of the VSP in the line of duty. https://t.co/s63fTrypQ1 https://t.co/P4Ey28KZqY
For police to charge David but suspect so.  Definitely tragic effect of vile neo Nazi and white supremacist actions. https://t.co/6FqNLbeIhU

I will be a governor for all Virginians.  I will take this campaign to every voter in every corner of our Commonwealth.
I will get us back on track &amp; we will keep the promise of ensuring that the next generation of can do better than the one that came before.
From our very founding, Virginia and Virginians have been at the forefront of that American ideal. It‚Äôs time for Virginia to lead again.
America‚Äîwhere we start out in life does not determine where we end up. That is the promise we have to keep.
From immigrant janitor to West Wing of the White House in two generations time.  What a country.
That led to a desk job inside one of those buildings, and eventually I worked my way to being Counselor to the President.
I took out student loans and I worked my way through school. One of my jobs was as a Senate parking lot attendant.
My grandfather was a night janitor at a big bank building in Philadelphia. My parents never went to college, but they insisted that I do.
We can reform our policies, change the tired way of doing things and make sure that we keep the promise of Virginia alive!
Given all the challenges, those are their priorities. We cannot afford four more years of a liberal governor. We are at a critical juncture.
I won‚Äôt try to repeal our commonsense voter ID law protecting legal voters while trying to issue IDs to people who are here illegally.
I will be a compassionate executive, but I will put an end to the McAuliffe-Northam rolling blanket restoration of rights to all felons.
I will stand strong for timeless principles and fundamental freedoms: the 2nd Amd‚Äôt, freedom of religion, and innocent human life.
I learned the importance of that when I helped write the Contract with America, which led to the first balanced Federal budget in 25 years.
I will put forward a positive agenda that unites us behind something to be for and that our fellow Virginians will embrace.
We need to keep the promise of a safe, quality public school for every student in Virginia, to ensure that equality of opportunity.
The proper role of government is not to guarantee equality of outcomes ‚Äì but equality of opportunity.
Constant tuition hikes and rampant spending are making college increasingly unaffordable for too many students.
Cutting and reforming taxes and regulations will help foster job creation, but we also need education reforms!
We‚Äôre going to eliminate that shortfall by getting more Virginians back to work in good paying jobs, and shrinking the size and of gov't!
But we‚Äôre not going to eliminate that shortfall by raising taxes on hardworking Virginians and reducing their take-home pay.
Liberals like Ralph Northam and Tom Perriello will say we can‚Äôt cut taxes when we have a $1.2 billion revenue shortfall.
And it instilled in me an entrepreneurial spirit that led me to start three successful small businesses of my own.
Stocking the shelves, sweeping the floors, waiting on customers‚Äîtaught me a valuable work ethic.
I grew up in a small business, a family grocery store‚Äîthe JC Market.  J and C were Jack and Conny, or as I knew them ‚Äì Mom and Dad.
What we need to do is make it easier to open a new business &amp; expand existing ones.  Foster entrepreneurship &amp; small business formation.
Remember the time Ralph Northam‚Äôs VEDP squandered $1.4 million in taxpayer money on a Chinese company with a fake website?
Writing checks to big companies to move to Virginia cannot be the singular focus of our job creation efforts.
For too long, our economic development policies have centered on corporate whale hunting. Trying to lure a company HQ or plant here.
Part of that plan will be modernizing our outdated tax code &amp; cutting taxes for families, small business owners &amp; entrepreneurs.
In this campaign, I‚Äôll put forward a sweeping, serious plan to keep the promise of Virginia alive.
I will be an honest, ethical, hard-working, principled, conservative servant leader worthy of Virginia.
If the next Gov does not respond w/ a sense of urgency we will fail our fellow Virginians. I have that sense of urgency &amp; will not fail us!
We‚Äôve talked for decades about the need to diversify our economy. Friends, that time is upon us. It is here and it is now.
Too many families feel the promise of Virginia is starting to fade.
Five years ago, we were #1 on the list of best states for business. On the McAuliffe-Northam watch, we‚Äôve fallen out of the top 10.
In 2014, we were 48th out of 50 states in economic growth. Virginia ‚Äì in the bottom five. That‚Äôs just infuriating.
In November, Terry McAuliffe, Ralph Northam and Mark Herring ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to send them all packing!
This is the year Virginia Republicans start winning again!
We‚Äôre not just going to win back the governorship. I will lead our ticket to a sweep of all three statewide races!

We cannot afford six more years of the last six years.	But nothing will change if we send Senator Warner back to Washington #VASenDebate
Mark Warner takes arrows from both sides because he says one thing in Virginia and does another thing in Washington. #VASenDebate
Mark Warner sounds like a newspaper columnist or an @msnbc commentator - not someone who has been there for 6 years. #VASenDebate
The time to consider a flight ban to prevent #Ebola has passed, we need a ban now. #VASenDebate #PeoplesDebate
