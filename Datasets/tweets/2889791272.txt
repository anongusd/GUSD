I once posted something about America shouldn‚Äôt a place where we are required to stand for the flag but a place where we want to. Maybe the same goes for taking care of eachother.  All the taxes in the country can‚Äôt force empathy. Maybe that‚Äôs where we start.
@RepBillJohnson Or we can just make it easier to come here legally, so these "caravans" of people are not overwhelming our border patrol and they can do their jobs of keeping the bad people out. I'm sure a few more and better staffed areas where people can request asylum would help too.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Better for who exactly?
@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan I wish you the best.
@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan Start a support group for women who need support with thier pregnancy and having children. Raise funds to feed them. Give them support. That's the Christian thing, not fighting on Twitter. Good luck
@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan Weeds have DNA, do you let them grow? Mold has DNA, do you allow that in your home? DNA does not equal sentient  life. I'm not attempting to change your views. By all means do your best to support what you believe, but for your self.

@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan It's not until about week 10 that the embryo becomes a fetus. Which marks when it has developed to organs necessary to sustain life. Most by choice abortions are done much prior to that. After 10 weeks is because the child and or mother would risk death if brought to full term.
@AZVotes @GOP @realDonaldTrump Where‚Äôs the lie?
@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan I‚Äôm not. So why should Christian beliefs effect my body and my health? You do what you know is right for you. I should be allowed the same.
@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan I‚Äôm agnostic. And as much as I respect your religious views. There is a separation between church and state that states your beliefs have no place as policy. Many Americans don‚Äôt have the same beliefs.
@nanaluvsthree3 @Jim_Jordan Laws won‚Äôt change that. We will just have more children who can‚Äôt be taken care of. Science has a pretty definitive answer to where life begins, other than that, it‚Äôs a personal and mostly religious point of view that has no place in the law books.
@nanaluvsthree3 @Jim_Jordan Contraception fails. And often. I whole heartedly agree that abortion should not be a method of birth control but women need opinions in the case of failing contraception.
@Bernard39715301 @Jim_Jordan I hold no judgment for those who believe sex is for procreation only, but it‚Äôs not a realistic expectation for the rest of us.
@Jim_Jordan The #1 reason women choose abortion is because they don't have the means to care for a child. If they had help, real support, that would stop more abortions than any laws would. You would just stop them from being done safely.
