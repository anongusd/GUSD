@mercatus analyzed a wide range of studies and the evidence suggests two things: 1) licensing requirements do not improve the quality of the goods and services provided by licensed occupations. 2) they exclude potential service providers who find the hurdles too costly. #SB208
A 2017 study by the @IJ examined occupational licensure laws for 102 lower-income occupations and found that Nevada requires a license for 75 of them. Only three other states‚ÄîLouisiana, Washington, and California‚Äîlicense more low-income professions. #SB208 #LegalizeWork
