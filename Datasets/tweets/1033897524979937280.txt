Invest in green energy, health infrastructure, education yes. Tax breaks for people already doing well? No.
@DerekLakey @senjudiciary @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Because I think the public is entitled not to be lied to, whether by Kavanaugh or Ford, and should be given the same respect that, say, someone with a stake in a civil or criminal trial would be given.

@Srcpt2 Nobody looks down on any SAHM or SAHD these days. Attitudes have changed prob because most understand it is a rational economic choice. It is too bad that economics might force choice though. It should be a free choice.

@kevindixon @mattgaetz The bigger crime is probably whatever Cohen and Manafort are talking about with Special Counsel. And my bet is they are not telling lies now.  And they have already committed big crimes.
@Srcpt2 poverty, unwantedness, having to work multiple jobs?Better wages, more job security, social services, which would remove stresses, turn child care into question of choice not need, would do more to help families. I am not clear what this has to do with gender roles and femininity
@kevindixon @mattgaetz Or you‚Äôre looking for another Nunes Memo charade		Politically motivated, recklessly drafted Nunes memo does not support its main thesis alleging FBI/DOJ abuse re Page as it doesn't offer any evidence of the potential abuse...the memo undermines itself	https://t.co/1KBmmuH53t
@kevindixon @mattgaetz Right. I am brainwashed. My bet is folks like you are pumping FULL declass because you know it cannot happen for decades for security reasons &amp; you can argue whatever is in last 2% was exculpatory evidence, even though everyone got convicted on the other 98%.
@Srcpt2 Best spouses don‚Äôt set up a power dynamic where one person in the relationship can‚Äôt make choices because they have less power, and don‚Äôt force gendered/cliched roles on other or themself (and I‚Äôm not just talking about opposite sex relationships).
@Srcpt2 In fact, the left right divide on this issue isn‚Äôt about gender, it is about public investment in childcare services so that it becomes a choice and not a financial calculation.
@Srcpt2 Disrespect for hard job of SAH parenting whether by mom or dad is not something that is disrespected today. You can partly thank ridiculous high cost of child care.
@Srcpt2 You imagine that women who aren‚Äôt submissive are in unhappy marriages because the best men are misogynists. And those women are jealous of the women who gave up and give in to their misogynist husbands, because that is how you get love from a good man? 		Yellow Wallpaper.
@Srcpt2 But what exactly is the tradition &amp; way of life you think are losing?		If it has something to do with guns, there‚Äôs is an 1871-1976 NRA tradition of supporting skills and reasonable regulation and 1976-today NRA tradition of using guns as a wedge issue to polarize and terrify.
@Srcpt2 Feminists are jealous of whom?
@kevindixon @mattgaetz Manafort‚Äôs confession wasn‚Äôt real (the confession that followed a conviction)? The guy In CA didn‚Äôt sell those accounts? Flynn didn‚Äôt lie to FBI? Popadopolous didn‚Äôt lie? Which one do you think wasn‚Äôt real?

@horsevtnek @jones7955 Flat tax doesn‚Äôt solve that problem. If u have political will to get people to pay their taxes, get them to pay in way that allocates tax burden in proportion to marginal value of additional dollar of income (and lighten the burden on earned income if u want to incentivize work).
@NastySJW @jones7955 That is why sales taxes are very regressive. They decrease as proportion of income as the difference between earnings and expenses increase (ie, your effective rate decreases the richer you are).
@horsevtnek @jones7955 Marginal value of an additional dollar of income decreases the more dollars you have. I don‚Äôt think paying same rate on additional dollar across all income levels allocates burden fairly.

@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis @TheHateUGive Let‚Äôs talk again after you see the movie, ideally in the 30 seconds after you feel a sense a compassion and before you start arguing with yourself and against it
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis @TheHateUGive I‚Äôm not saying she was all wrong &amp; he was all right, but I will say that watching her behavior reminded me of the community pool vid, and her following him to his apartment reminds me off the TX shooting of the guy in his apt. It is more complicated than ‚Äúfollow rules on sign.‚Äù
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis @TheHateUGive What do you say you read or watch The Hate You Give? I think you will discover the situation is a little more nuanced than that one should suck it up and play by the exact letter of the rules when someone treats you like you should be in their space based on race.
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis @TheHateUGive Let me save you the trouble of responding. Let‚Äôs stipulate that I am an idiot. I‚Äôm an idiot just trying to shift perspective to this guy‚Äôs side a little bit.
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis @TheHateUGive If you are white, then I‚Äôm not sure you are exactly in this guy‚Äôs position. I suspect something happened before he started filming that might confirm your or my sense of the dynamic.

@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis I would be more outraged about being blocked from my home than from being blocked from the pool. Put yourself in they guy‚Äôs place just for a second. (@TheHateUGive explores that perspective BTW)
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis Like I said, her demeanor reminded more of that community pool incident. If she really thought he was a criminal she wouldn‚Äôt have physically challenged him or followed him to the door. I think she decided he was probably a visitor and was going to complain to the invitor.
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis I think the evidence suggests that this incident is similar to that community pool incident. It is not a fear of a crime motivating her, but a confidence that she doesn‚Äôt have to share space with this guy based on visual miscues.
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis I may be an idiot, but I know the difference between a burglary and a robbery. She was not afraid of being robbed. She wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in that elevator with him if she were.
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis I encourage to read this book or see this movie. https://t.co/j5DzYcW0yN
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis @TheHateUGive You should check out this book/movie for some perspective on this situation.
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis Huh?
@outsiderNYC @looktotherose @ALT_uscis The evidence are the words coming out of her mouth, her attitude, the fact she got in the elevator with him, followed him to the door. She didn‚Äôt seem afraid of him. She seemed to think she had the power. She didn‚Äôt seem to like the fact he was in her space.

I am solely going on the evidence in the video. Maybe she thought she was going to be burgalled, but I‚Äôd bet not. Robbery is when someone physically takes something from you. She seemed to not be concerned about that. In fact she seemed to be challenging him to touch her. https://t.co/FZ1DSWuhBQ

CF didn‚Äôt want to put him in jail. She wanted to warn America about the bad character &amp; deep misogyny of a SCt nominee. She did. Republicans in the Senate didn‚Äôt care. November 6 is Election Day. We‚Äôll see in which States and CDs voters care. https://t.co/BhAfW0P5nj
What is ur evidence that ‚ÄúBiden Rule‚Äù exists? JB suggesting in 6/92 that they shouldn‚Äôt vote on a SCt nominee when there wasn‚Äôt even one to vote on is not evidence of the existence of a rule. The example you cite is example the rule doesn‚Äôt exist. Why didn‚Äôt Garland get a vote? https://t.co/IX8BtXPS9r

You‚Äôre knocking on doors for all of us who can‚Äôt be there with you. Thank you!! https://t.co/qgznLyAI4P
@fawfulfan Yes. It‚Äôs not ruthlessness that was the problem. The problem is that a majority of the Senate is OK with misogyny, particularly if it comes in a vehicle that delivers other (entwined) items on their agenda. Now it‚Äôs time to put the misogynists in the minority. It is time to vote.
BTW, don‚Äôt get too excited about getting past this cred hurdle. The next thing we‚Äôre going into depth on is why use think DC McA personally knows CF. I‚Äôm not saying she doesn‚Äôt but we r going 2 need better ev before we accept she does. We r going to work hard on our BS detectors. https://t.co/gQSiNsr5cW
@Drew1Lawson ur digging hole deeper. U think there‚Äôs a a Biden Rule. JB said in 6/92 (about 150 days or less before election) @ height of campaign he didn‚Äôt think they should vote on hypothetical SCt nominees (there was none). Not a rule. If you believe it‚Äôs a rule U need a new BS detector.

Going in circles. The case to be made was that BK has good character. CF isn‚Äôt even trying to bring a case. She‚Äôs trying to bring to the public ev of bad character. GOP doesn‚Äôt think alleged actions are bad enough to care about truth. If they did, we would have heard from M.Judge https://t.co/4qg5XCg7XH
We r going in circles. There is enough corroborating evidence so that CF‚Äôs allegations were credible. GOP didn‚Äôt care enough about truth to seek it. M.Judge is the key. U can‚Äôt say u care about DueProcess, but not RulesOfEvidence &amp; TrialProcedure as way to find truth. https://t.co/oDAjurCxBS
You like to accept as true evidence that you haven‚Äôt seen, which hasn‚Äôt been prodded under oath, whether to buttress it by own counsel or challenge it by opposing counsel. You love Due Process right up to, but not including Rules of Evdience and Trial Procedure, eh? https://t.co/t7PDGZRlro

@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee Biden said truth. FBI doesn‚Äôt decide fact. FBI investigates. RulesOfEvidence and TrialPractice are how to arrive at truth-hasn‚Äôt happened with BK&amp;CT.

@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee If u care about DueProcess, u need to care about RulesOfEvidence and TrialPractice. I‚Äôm not sure u understand what ‚Äúcorroborating evidence‚Äù means. There is ton of corroborating evidence, and there was an eye witness who has not been prodded by supporting and opposing counsel.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee Again, waiting for a source for that claim. Will it be an anonymous family friend?
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee Which is why cross-examination by a competent attorney, your own attorney buttressing your statements, other evidence, and other witnesses are so important IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee If ur going 2 argue DueProcess is important, it‚Äôs also important to understand RulesOfEvidence and TrialPractice. You could even just watch TV shows, or the shameful testimony of Jeff Sessions regarding RUS interference. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Äù is a way to avoid a perjury charge.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee I don‚Äôt think anyone has refuted them. Many say they don‚Äôt remember. MJ asserting he doesn‚Äôt remember is the least credible, and most in need of being prodded in public for the purpose of buttressing and challenging. That he was hiding at a beach house in DE rather says a lot!
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee And this is why, if shoe were on other foot today, you‚Äôd be complaining about GOP not sharing FBI report, not allowing anyone to cross witnesses, not hearing from all witnesses. U can‚Äôt cry about DueProcess &amp; then ignore RulesOfEvidence &amp; centuries of history on trial practice.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee My guess is MJ said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall.‚Äù Neither of us knows. Bottom line: unless MJ is prodded IN PUBLIC by competent questioners to test his veracity‚Äîsupport AND challenge him‚Äîwe won‚Äôt have a sense of whether he told the whole truth and nothing but the truth to FBI.

@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee Uh uh. That letter WRITTEN BY HIS LAWYER has no evidentiary value. When do  u think he gave evidence under oath? As alleged eyewitness it is absurd he wasn‚Äôt probed under oath/threat of perjury in public by competent counsel. That alone should shake confidence we know the truth.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee I get that you want to persuade others that this is not corroborating and persuasive evidence, but it is, from an evidentiary perspective. This is why Kavanaugh would not ask for an investigation and why McConnel, Hatch and you are so aggressively spinning the other direction.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee That makes no sense from an evidentiary perspective. If anything, if it takes one to know one, then the evidence is even more credible.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee Not very persuasive without links. You were giving more weight to the Daily Mail article (anonymous friend of family) than LK‚Äôs direct statement. So you can appreciate that I‚Äôm skeptical of your seminar of evidentiary value. What is this source?
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee It appears to have happened about a month before the the period of time Judge worked at a supermarket to earn money to pay for football camp.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee That is right. He wasn‚Äôt so drunk then that he could credibly say he was too drunk to rememeber, so if Mark Judge were to admit  under oath what happened, BK would have a harder time excusing his poor recollection due to drinking.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee That‚Äôs what these people stepping up are trying to do. They are trying to quantify it because he wouldn‚Äôt and they believe it is relevant to character.
@PauleyP Sounds like a metaphor for what is happening in this country.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee And the point of these witnesses is that this guy didn‚Äôt just like beer, and didn‚Äôt just get to the point of ‚Äúwhatever the chart says‚Äù in high school, but his character was to frequently drink to the point of almost passing such that it defined his character in college too.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee FWIW, issue was blacking out, and point is it would forgive him of memory lapse. It‚Äôs impossible to prove conscious person blacked out. But a person who admits blacking out could be excused for forgetting something. BK lost a perjury defense when he said no chance he blacked out.
@Drew1Lawson @GovMikeHuckabee And the point of that is that, later, if a bunch of eyewitnesses (like Mark Judge) decided to tell the truth about events, BK loses defense that he was too drunk to remember. So, the Q is a double edge sword as it also says something about excessive drinking, a character issue.

@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch The issue is definitely not whether he committed a crime. 		The issue is his character. 		The yearbook, drinking, credible allegation by Ford, the demeanor, treatment of the senators &amp; fudging &amp;, possibly, lies at the hearing‚Äîthese all go to character.
@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch Why not set a high bar for decency for the Supreme Court? What evidence do you have that that attitude toward women isn‚Äôt a thread that runs right up to how he treated the women who asked him questions at his hearing, and through to his judicial opinions?
@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch And as long as we‚Äôre talking about consent, you saw this, right? Do you think someone who sees you as an object to measure your manhood in the eyes of other men can judge consent? (This is relevant to Ford‚Äôs testimony.)		https://t.co/rhTqnP7QRP

@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch No, I‚Äôm saying wishful thinking to believe ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Triangle‚Äù is a drinking game. You must know that‚Äôs not true. At the very least, you don‚Äôt have any supporting evidence. Unless you went to BK‚Äôs HS at same time, if you were both playing that game, it‚Äôd be documented somewhere.
@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch FstFrwrd 30 yrs:UR applying for job (SCt, receptionist, whatevs) &amp;UR expected to be fair &amp; decent to people. E/er looks at ur facebook, it‚Äôs filled with demeaning attitudes, treating people as objects, measuring your value in proportion to cruelty towards them. What do you do?
@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch This sounds so much more like a wish than something that supported by any evidence.
@Srcpt2 @senorrinhatch If you are offended by the terms used by BK &amp; Judge in their yearbook‚Äîwhich reveal deep misogyny, treating women like they are objects whose only value is to define a man‚Äôs masculinity‚Äîthen I don‚Äôt know how you can be mad at me and can support the GOP.
If you want to scour HS experience for evidence of being honest, that‚Äôs relevant. 		If you want to scour it for evidence of drinking or promiscuity, it is not relevant. There is no allegation by Kavanaugh that he misread her signals. He denies the event even happened. https://t.co/CSaCOr7Gia

Not even fit to judge a game of Devil‚Äôs Triangle. 		Isn‚Äôt the GOP bothered by (1) the lies under oath about the yearbook, and (2) the attitude towards women revealed in it? 		If I saw that in a Facebook feed for someone applying for a job today, I wouldn‚Äôt hire them. https://t.co/9bZQf7HRqx

This treatment of women‚Äôs bodies as objects the control over which measures the value of a man is a thread that connects HS yearbook comments like ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Triangle‚Äù, ‚ÄúRenate Alumnius,‚Äù all the way to abortion politics.

Ford said this happened at the pre-party, not the main or after party. If BK and Judge were too drunk to remember that early in the evening, then they really did have drinking problems. https://t.co/DAJEm25qN5
And for whom women are merely dehumanized objects who are valuable only to the extent that the things you do to them impress other men. https://t.co/DdFeFvkBl1
Set aside whether allegations are true, the 	yearbook reveals such deep misogyny-women are dehumanized objects/currency for measuring men.

@Edwardachike @mopowatooya @frankprosport @Steve_Rohr @CNN @SenFeinstein There is tangible evidence, but there is no corroborating evidence yet presented in a forum in which it could be trusted (specifically, Mark Ford must give oral evidence).
@Edwardachike @mopowatooya @frankprosport @Steve_Rohr @CNN @MichaelAvenatti 90% chance they are just misogynistic idiots and this will be another nail in the coffin of the Republican parry.

@Edwardachike @mopowatooya @frankprosport @Steve_Rohr @CNN 1st Point: WH had the 65 women character letter ready to go day after story broke. They obviously knew something. It is rich to blame anyone other than BK and WH for BK‚Äôs character. WH vetted him and BK knows about his own past. /1
@Edwardachike @mopowatooya @frankprosport @Steve_Rohr @CNN Reread what you wrote. You know they want the investigation in any event. The timing has nothing to do with whether they want the investigation.
@frankprosport @Steve_Rohr @CNN I see it a different way. Finally, character is measured by whether you have decent character.
@CNN So little of what Graham said mad sense. And did he imply that he wants to help Judge avoid criminal liability? That doesn‚Äôt sound like Graham cares about the truth.
@CalFreedomMom @jaded_notes @timkaine The process is not allowing evidence (like a cross of Mark Judge) to be entered. Nobody is victor. Nobody will be a victor.

@mikedpatent @plano_jim @senorrinhatch ‚Äúwhere an individual is facing a deprivation of life, liberty, or property, procedural due process mandates that he or she is entitled to adequate notice, a hearing, and a neutral judge.‚Äù Is that what you want for BK? More time, real hearing w/ real evidence, and neutral judge?
@mikedpatent @plano_jim @senorrinhatch You get DP in court when you‚Äôre already in court asserting rights or defending yourself vs a Federal statue, regulation, or criminal law. How do you analogize that to BK hearing? You think he shouldn‚Äôt have to have a hearing in order to be on SCt?
@mikedpatent @plano_jim @senorrinhatch You get DP when GOVERNMENT denies you a right or liberty. DP issues start with the complaint, ‚Äúgovt won‚Äôt let me...‚Äù What won‚Äôt the govt let Kavanaugh do? Not have to defend his character? That‚Äôs not a liberty or right, and Republicans are in control of process anyway.
@mikedpatent @vance_sherri @plano_jim @senorrinhatch I‚Äôd by thrilled if they followed Fed Rules of Evidence. I have no idea what you think the due process argument is.

@plano_jim @senorrinhatch Rules of Evdnc reflect an accepted standard for arriving at truth that I think we all agree works better than any other system (including twitter).

@AlreadyGreat_ @ameliababy4 @plano_jim @senorrinhatch The letters alone aren‚Äôt evidence. The authors would have to testify. If they testify, the letters could be entered into evidence as, e.g., a prior inconsistent or a prior consistent statement, but the letter is t evidence in and of itself.

@FreezingTeacher @senorrinhatch hearsay evidence is less reliable than oral testimony, which can be prodded and tested either to support it or challenge it.  If you want to know the truth, you get oral evidence from witnesses.
@senorrinhatch If MD brings charges against him, he is entitled to the preumption of innocence. For now, the burden is on you to prove his good character in the face of credible allegations of bad character.
@1usavoice @ARjdoc @paradigmeyes @senorrinhatch No, have him testify under oath, where there are consequences for lying.
@fawfulfan @itarjan They think a woman‚Äôs body and what is inside it is for them to control.

@vance_sherri @plano_jim @senorrinhatch Presumption of innocence isn‚Äôt relevant, but rules of ev are cool. 3 letters=out of crt statement offered for its truth=inadmissible hearsay. risks: misperception, faulty memory, ambiguity/imprecision, untrue, no chance for jury to assess demeanor on direct or cross; no oath.
@plano_jim @senorrinhatch This isn‚Äôt a criminal trial. But say it were, Hatch would need the lesson. These letters would be inadmissible hearsay. You could only enter the testimony of these witnesses if it is given under oath. 		https://t.co/o5J0eh3Ve1
@ARjdoc @paradigmeyes @senorrinhatch Judge was the third person in the room, it seems, and is being shielded from giving testimony under oath.

@senorrinhatch What is difference between an ‚Äúoffficial‚Äù letter and any other letter? And what is their evidentiary value if they are not given under oath?

@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC BTW, when Federalist Society SCt turns clock back on women's rights, you really want impression it was manifestation of BK's personal animus towards women? Pick someone without this history who'll make it look like it was all based in sound legal principles and not a pathology.
@MArstonight @TheDroningPool @jkirchick @EWErickson It's a legitimate point that there might be some people who don't find BK's alleged behavior offensive, but I'm hoping the community standard of decency in this case--when the significance, symbolically, is immense, is that it is not appropriate for a S.Ct judge in these times.
@jkirchick S.Ct. nominee hearing is NOT gateway to prison or liberty. Putting burden of proof of good character, lack of bias, unlikelihood of succumbing to bribery should be on team presenting the nominee. If there's a legitimate question about character, we should care about truth.

@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC So, it‚Äôs accurate for you to say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about the truth and would gladly have a SCt justice for the next 30 days with bad character because he‚Äôs a Republican, I‚Äôm a Republican, and I don‚Äôt like liberals.‚Äù
That joke by @RalphNorman was particularly tasteless. I can't wait for him and @SenDeanHeller to turn over their seats to politicians who are products of the current times, and not of the times 30 years ago. https://t.co/n6WhUoO3Ab
@Wbowman17 @AdamSchiffCA @CNN @ChrisCuomo War as metaphor for politics isn‚Äôt limited to right, but has become a constant in conservative discourse. ‚ÄúThe first shots of the 2nd American civil war have already been fired,‚Äù said Alex Jones. ‚ÄúWe are in a clear-cut cultural civil war,‚Äù according to Newt Gingrich.

@Wbowman17 @AdamSchiffCA @CNN @ChrisCuomo I'm not saying liberals don't do it too, but I can't remember the last time a judge was threatened by a liberal. To paraphrase Lindsey Graham in Fear, Democrats roll over pretty easily. It's easy to fool them with a facade of fairness. They don't drive Dodge Chargers into crowds.
@Wbowman17 @AdamSchiffCA @CNN @ChrisCuomo Here's Sandra Day O'Connor getting death threats: https://t.co/ItcFEGBJ6f
@Wbowman17 @AdamSchiffCA @CNN @ChrisCuomo I was basing that on the last few days. But there's also this (Conservatives threatening Glenn Beck): https://t.co/AKYfLNtR7L
@Wbowman17 @AdamSchiffCA @CNN @ChrisCuomo Based on experience, I think the only scenario where anyone threatens his life is if he shows up and tells the truth and BK has to withdraw.
@Quarternote2539 @admspec1 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @politico Committee not getting Judge under oath is like saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care about the truth.‚Äù It is outrageous and defies logic.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Huh? An investigation and rules of evidence cloud truth?
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Issue is Republicans want to pull an Anita Hill. No investigation. no Mark Judge under oath. No corroborating or exculputory evidence.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I think rules of evidence are fair. Plus there was an eyewitness and it is outrageous if he doesn‚Äôt give evidence under oath.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC That is a legitimate argument. Does this one bad act disqualify him. I think it should simply because I think there are better people out there who haven‚Äôt done this even once. Supreme Court Justice is extremely important job
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC That sounds like evidence you are trying to enter. I would trust it if were made under oath and I had opportunity to cross with my own evidence acquired after investigation.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Exactly!
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC That is a premature conclusion. You make it sound like there was already an investigation. If that is relevant to you, then you are  making an argument for an investigation. Otherwise you are arguing truth does not matter.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC If they do it in that order they can‚Äôt vote until after the investigation completes and there is an opportunity to examine the evidence that results.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC FRE has rules about bias! A neutral investigation applying rules of evidence can handle all of this.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC @AlanDersh I would have been more flattering if you said @AshaRangappa_  https://t.co/IJNY8VP55v
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I think it should follow rules of evidence as much as possible. There should be an opportunity to cross examine and all relevant evidence should be admissible.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Again, that might be a bias of your own which makes you feel like this has less weight than it actually does. At the very least a neutral investigation is appropriate. Like the Fed Rules of Ev, it favors truth and not a party.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Exactly. Allow other evidence. Don‚Äôt just leave it as he said/she said.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC That sounds like political bias of your own that is making you uninterested in truth. Set aside politics‚Äîimagine shoe on other foot even‚Äîyou really don‚Äôt think this is relevant evidence of character? Does hidden truth make judge corruptible (blackmailable)?
@Flassebecker @mitchellvii Why do you assume it wasn‚Äôt BK or Mark Judge who talked it about it afterward? Couldn‚Äôt they be the source?
@JonathanAU @mitchellvii @TonySGrigsby If they knew about it they could have gotten Britt Hume‚Äôs daughter and dozens of others to write a character reference, and could have invited his daughters teammates to sit in on the hearing.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Exactly. I think it is hearsay, inadmissible for truth of matters contained in it. If she testifies it could be admitted to impeach her if it is inconsistent or to support her if it is consistent. That is why you want an investigation.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC So you are arguing a reputation for not being bad. I think that requires putting him on stand for cross on that issue. BTW uniquely, FRE 415: evidence of similar acts in civil cases concerning sexual assault are admissible. If there were others, it would be admissable evidence
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC It is easy to copy paste rules of evidence and there seemed to be a dire need for understanding.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC What you wrote is gobbledygook. But let‚Äôs pretend rules of evidence apply, Blasey=‚àÜ. Crawford v WA (US ‚Äò04): testimonial statements made by witness without opportunity for ‚àÜ to cross-examine not admissible. you think Judge‚Äôs unsworn lawyer letter is enough evidence? stop there?

@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Sen from HI asked BK if he ever assaulted. A was no. Guess what? Whether he did‚Äôs admissible ev of character: M. Furman vid making up evidence not allowed in since extrinsic evidence of a bad act, BUT ephitet was prior inconsistent statement allowed in since said didn‚Äôt use them)
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Is witness telling the truth? Methods of Impeachment: anybody can impeach, including party who called the witness. Basic methods: competency, bias, bad character, self contradiction.
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I think I read that Judge kept HS journals. He writes about HS. Maybe he relied on old journals. That‚Äôs admissible evidence. Past recollection Recorded Foundation: (note a hearsay exception, document, not the testimony, is the real evidence...)
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Let‚Äôs get started: was Judge too drunk to trust? Schneiderman v. Interstate Transit Lines (IL 1946) standard is whether witness has the capacity to observe, recollect, and communicate ‚Äì mental deficiency only goes to weight for jury.
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC ...and here is a summary of actual rules of evidence. Maybe this will help you make your argument. https://t.co/1pmlDIzLlN
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC 1) you are *trying* to describe a criminal trial (and don‚Äôt have it right at all, and 2) there was an eyewitness named Mark Judge.
@LEBassett ‚ÄúLocker room banter,‚Äù ‚Äúshe looked like she was 18‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt was horseplay.‚Äù  I cant wait for November and the end of this low point in American history.

@RAMRANTS @jenrobertson2o2 Those are the conclusion drawn by the independent investigation?
@GlenKnight6 @lynnemartist @mattsmom221 @LindseyGrahamSC That is the standard in a criminal trial. This is not a criminal trial.
@GlenKnight6 @lynnemartist @mattsmom221 @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe according to your ethos, but there is no burden of proof standard with Supreme Court nomination hearings. The only standard is if you perjur yourself you face sanctions. You answer the Qs you are asked and the senate decides who to call to answer Qs and give statements.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC So cover my mouth and turn the music up.
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Again, you are arguing against yourself. These are the reasons to investigate (so u can say with straight face, ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù), and u get evidence so it is not he said/she said.
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC That may be your personal ethos, but it is not how world works. I would love to insulate myself from every inconvenience I could cause my friends by having my lawyer send out letters not written under oath to everyone my friends have harmed. However, again, not how world works.
@GlenKnight6 @lynnemartist @mattsmom221 @LindseyGrahamSC You know this because there was an investigation? If you believe this is true, then you should welcome an investigation.
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC You are arguing against yourself. Hill had corroborating witnesses you were not asked to testify in front of the Senate and there was no investigation so I don‚Äôt know how you draw that conclusion. If you believe what you say you should want an investigation.
@GlenKnight6 @lynnemartist @mattsmom221 @LindseyGrahamSC And you know this because ther was an investigation?
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC What would be harassment? Asking him to talk under oath about something he witnessed?
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC By the way is Mark judge getting death threats and did he have to move?
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Is this the flip side?
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC You are aware that everything I know about him he has published in books and on the Internet this is not stuff he wants to keep private
@Dee54181 @CooperTMack @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Because he is a key to the truth.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC If this is how you‚Äôre feeling then just have the investigation so that you have the facts to prove it
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC You should just embrace this argument here is the reason you do not care about the truth. That would free up your time up as you would not have to keep making bad arguments about already knowing the facts.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I think the analog is, you witness your friend almost rape someone and you become an alcoholic and put yourself in that situation and the rest of your life .  We could test both series with investigation
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Then why are you afraid of an investigation that would reveal that. I don‚Äôt think you really believe you are saying.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC ...put her in therapy, make her not want to sleep in a room with a door to the outside.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Based on your writings I am not sure you know the typical response. ‚Äúcomply‚Äù is an interesting choice of word too.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Your biases might be clouding your vision.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC You‚Äôd have to ask them under oath, no? Start with Mark Judge.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Mark Judge has relives HS almost his entire professional life. Let‚Äôs start with him.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC I can‚Äôt believe I have to answer this. To the truth.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Is that what Anita Hill should have done for CT‚Äôs character to matter?
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Even if I stipulated that were true, it is a terrible argument for not caring about the truth.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Yet you still don‚Äôt understand why Blasey wants a neutral investigation first? The investigation could undermine her testimony if her memory is inaccurate, no?
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Wilful ignorance should preclude a vote on Kavanaugh, no?
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC You know that because there was a neutral investigation? There wasn‚Äôt one. You should want one today so you can make the same argument in 27 years about Blasey and actually have it based on facts.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC You don‚Äôt know what happened with Anita Hill, do you?
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Of course willful ignorance is an option. But t it should preclude you from having an opinion or being able to judge.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Analogy: you could unmute to confirm. You could have a neutral investigation to confirm. Both are within the realm of possibilities.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC She wants an investigation first because of Hill. As I repeatedly have argued.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC You think her hearing was fair? She had a corroborating witness they did not call? There should have been an investigation if they wanted to know the truth.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC If you are just going to turn the volumes up on the stereo, at least let me pick the song  https://t.co/N0cPqFBPep
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC I‚Äôve addressed that and you are ignoring my reply and refusing to engage beyond repeating this mantra.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Is that what Anita Hill should have done? Find me one article from the last 27 years that argues that THAT was the reason that hearing was a mess.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Why do you keep asking the question I have answere without even engaging my response to it?
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC You know that you are just making stuff up now, right? Anita Hill did not need to do that.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC She, unlike you, knows how the Anita Hill he said/she said ended up (which was as designed) and she is not letting Senate fool America twice.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Do you really need me to explain this to you?
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Uh, talk to Mark Judge under oath. He was allegedly in the room. He is an over-discloser, so it seems likely that he has talked to his friends In even more detail than he has written about high school. He has gone back to HS much of his life. So talk to his friends. Obvy
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC I know you believe that but I don‚Äôt think it is true or logical. You really should dig into the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas archive if you want to understand what is happening.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Read a little more. She will testify after there is an investigation which may or may not uncover corroborating evidence. This is exactly what Anita Hill said should have been done with her testimony.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC You know that picture of the kid touching Obama‚Äôs hair (‚Äújust like mine‚Äù)‚Äîpowerful. Could untap a generation of human potential. What do think the symbolism of this administration is untapping? A generation of assaulters who think this is what winners do.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @CooperTMack @LindseyGrahamSC Mark Judge should testify under oath. Interesting to see if a guy with nothing to gain and a lot to loose from lying would be comfortable that he never told anybody else what he witnessed.

@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I definitely chuckled at that.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Happy to leave it at that.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I‚Äôll just put my hand over my own mouth while you turn up the music, eh?
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Uh, yeah. Sorry for caring about the world my daughters will inherit from the people you want to control it. My bad.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Do you care about the truth or about not learning the truth?
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I encourage you to read about Anita Hill.
@CooperTMack @Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC I thought you were being sarcastic and chuckled. But I think you are being sincere and am grateful that you are not professionally responsible for protecting my interests.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC That you don‚Äôt appreciate that this is entirely about whether a person with that character should be able to sit in judgement on issues impacting anyone‚Äôs life, let alone women‚Äôs control over their bodies, is I think extremely telling.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC For a criminal trial. This isn‚Äôt a criminal trial. He isn‚Äôt in jeopardy of losing his liberty. He is in jeopardy of losing immense power over the lives of others, including over women‚Äôs control of their own bodies. The civil standard (preponderance of evidence) is prob too high.
@JeffFlake Do u care about the truth or are you ok leaving her out to dry with a he said/she said? This might not feel important 2u for the same reason that, eg male pols don‚Äôt provide funding for tools to hold assaulters accountable. Do you see the analogy here?: https://t.co/e31cfnROIz
@seanhannity Because they r sworn to uphold the constitution and this is in reference to unconstitutional requests? Trump destroys official documents someone else has to tape together and he thinks Sessions is his personal lawyer. Probs for JD!
@mattsmom221 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC She will testify but she she doesn‚Äôt want it to be he said/she said.  Anita Hill had a corroborating witness the Senate did not call because Democrats cut a deal to approve CT after deciding truth didn‚Äôt matter. Blasey wants truth to matter.
@Dee54181 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC Neither was Anita Hill. It is about character. Also I think men who do things like this probably shouldn‚Äôt sit in judgment on the most important cases on highest court in the US. Sexual assaulters should not have a voice on overturning Roe v Wade.
@KME99117446 @lynnemartist @LindseyGrahamSC My money is on this. They blv there is more. explains a lot about the hearing so far. They want this 2 b he said/she said because they blv there is corroborating evidence and/or similar allegations. they need 2 treat Blasey shitty 2 discourage others from coming forward.

@JudgeJeanine Judge, you know what is going on. Rep‚Äôs want two witnesses. Her and him. They want a tie they can break in his favor. She wants the FBI to find corroborating evidence, like Judge‚Äôs journals or another victim with a similar story, of a friend Judge confessed to.

@Srcpt2 Ok. This is a good check. More time I spend on Twitter, the more tempting it is to polarize. I‚Äôll keep your comment in mind and will keep it level. I appreciate the feedback.
@Srcpt2 You also seem to have a kind vibe.
@Srcpt2 What do you think now that you know that isn‚Äôt true?
@Srcpt2 I thought we were friends. :) it is because you engage. You also seem to echo arguments I see elsewhere but in a more thoughtful way and you are willing to evolve the arguments. Other people don‚Äôt do that.
@AnnCoulter If anyone is repressing it is Mark Judge. He seems to have been suffering.
@Srcpt2 Finally, I am still curious: how did you get your facts so wrong about SCt nomination conventions (that presidents aren‚Äôt allowed to nominate judges in election years)? Do you rember the source of that piece of misinformation? /5
@Srcpt2 Judge reminds me of Mandela‚Äôs comment about apartheid‚Äôs affect on the prison guards at Robbins Island, which I think was that it was a moral trauma on perpetrators, not just victims. /4
@Srcpt2 The evidence suggests that Judge had the decency to be tramautizes by the event (based on alcoholism and his writings). He might still be grappling with it. If anyone is repressing it would be him, but I suspect he knows the truth. /3
@Srcpt2 If argument is passage of time results in faulty memory, you can‚Äôt just give the benefit of the argument to the drunk men in the room. /2
@Srcpt2 I don‚Äôt think she said it was a repressed memory. I‚Äôll double check the reporting. I thought it was interesting that everyone suggests that her memory might be bad because it was a long time ago, but Judge and Kavanaugh remember accurately. They were allegedly drunk! /1
@Ok_la_ho_ma @nomadphils @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter It would be interesting to compare Shell to its competitors who are not succeeding. If Grant is right, you might see a diversity initiative at Shell saving it from group think. (I'm enjoying this exchange--I appreciate the insights and hearing your thoughts. Thank you.)
@arpad_leen @PattyArquette @SenatorCollins That‚Äôs actually partially corroborating evidence.
@phillysnowflake @SenatorCollins Which is why Mark Judge should testify.		https://t.co/ycqXSkhxTS
@SenatorCollins ...and Mark Judge should testify under oath too, he‚Äôs the alleged witness. He seems to like to share details about these years, and If he has ever told anyone else in his life about this event, that would create an incentive for him not to perjur himself.
@mebeincom @nudog71 @OMGno2trump @GOP @SpeakerRyan I don‚Äôt include Ann Coulter,however.
@mebeincom @nudog71 @OMGno2trump @GOP @SpeakerRyan Not trying to be funny, but there are good people on both sides.
@Ok_la_ho_ma @nomadphils @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter BTW, do you know the headwinds/tailwinds theory? I wonder how many people in businesses who lean into ‚Äúcultural fit‚Äù/homogeneity, who then become less competitive, thinks diversity is the headwinds, rather than their bad choices and group think?		https://t.co/CZLBcR9AX2
@Ok_la_ho_ma @nomadphils @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter Do u work in a competitive industry where innovation determines who succeeds? If u feel comfortable sharing, could u tell me who is doing it best in your community?  (Not a start up, but a mature, large business which had been able to constistently perfrom well over the years.)
@Srcpt2 I‚Äôd like to hear Mark Judge under oath, and hear from friends of his over the years, to whom he might have told the story. I doubt she is telling anything but the truth as she remembers it. I looked at those two pages of court docket info. It‚Äôs not clear to me the story it tells.
@Srcpt2 The truth doesn‚Äôt matter because of the timing, or you read the evidence you read so far (including Mark Judge‚Äôs writings about those days) and you think she is lying?
@Ok_la_ho_ma @nomadphils @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter I also find Grant‚Äôs argument and evidence about cultural fit vs diversity very compelling‚ÄîI see that in the real world, in my own experiences.
@Ok_la_ho_ma @nomadphils @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter Fair enough. My experiences and emotions are different. I also look around the world and see evidence, but we‚Äôre interpreting that differently too. At least we can say, time will tell. (But I also think time has told.)
@Ok_la_ho_ma @nomadphils @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter You should be clear in your own mind  how much of that is a feeling, and how much is supported by evidence, and how much it is immutable. I encourage you to consider whether your feelings are holding you back from succeeding.
@Srcpt2 Ok. Saving you some work. Here's the data. Conclusion: unprecedented. (Can you put your finger on the thing that had convinced you otherwise?)  https://t.co/RV4nzyzPxk
@Srcpt2 So, the Garland nomination wasn't the deal. It was unprecedented. I know you're going to say that none other was nominated so close to the end of the term. That's not true, IIRC, but I'll leave it to you to prove it if that's your claim. (Answer might be in Wikipedia.)
@Srcpt2 The nomination remained before the Senate for 293 days,[6] the longest nomination process in the history of Supreme Court nominations.[7]		https://t.co/xjSoVAlutj
@nomadphils @Ok_la_ho_ma @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter I wonder, if you have isolated yourself from new ideas, whether you might want to think about the relationship to your success or lack of success in your own life.
@nomadphils @Ok_la_ho_ma @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter This is not a controversial piece of research. It is broadly accepted and whether corporate America has intuited it or is actually relying on this research, it is a reason corporate America is not on same page as neo-Nazis and white nationalists on these issues.
@nomadphils @Ok_la_ho_ma @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter I think you should read this book, and then we'll discuss (this is a study of companies in free market economies; hiring for "cultural fit" works at the beginning, but not well at all when your competitors come at you after you mature):		https://t.co/FA8ggSjxW2

@Srcpt2 Remind me to address this if I forget. This was off the charts unprecedented.
@Srcpt2 I don‚Äôt think she is motivated by politics. I think this event had an impact in her. I think the issue is memory. There was a third party witness. His evidence is key.
@Srcpt2 Do you think Anita Hill was lying? What do you think would motivate a woman to tell the story first to her therapist and then six years later against her well to the entire nation?
@Srcpt2 She referred it to FBI. Someone leaked it.
@Srcpt2 You made up that second part.

@LindseyGrahamSC The fine print, eh? How about something I can read on my phone, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to put my hand over her mouth, turn up the music, and vote for Kavanaugh. https://t.co/UXVdWE1kZ1
@WaPoSean This isn‚Äôt something voters will forget this November or any future November.
@TCB4EVS @newscentermaine @SenatorCollins Don‚Äôt let those Republican Senators put their hand over your mouth.
@Srcpt2 Not to be overly dramatic but please don‚Äôt put your hand over my mouth and turn up the music while I try to draw attention to what is happening.
@Srcpt2 My beef is administration hostilities toward women and I am not surprised its SCt nominee put a woman in therapy (hand over mouth turn music up) &amp; I hope claim is taken seriously. Wish someone else were nominating judges.
@Srcpt2 I think the timing made sense. Maybe in ‚Äò12 K was in the press during Bush II and jus judgeship, so she talks about it for first time in therapy. As soon as he is nominated fo SC she tells her senator.
@Srcpt2 she brought up in therapy in 2012. He was doing what then?
@TCB4EVS @newscentermaine @SenatorCollins This isn‚Äôt just a matter of listening to bosses. It‚Äôs a question about values and doing the right thing. If the voters didn‚Äôt care, she should still care.
@newscentermaine @SenatorCollins Pls think hard about why (a) (if true) an impulse to assault women (hand over mouth, turn up the music), (b) desire to overturn Roe v Wade, &amp; (c)support for THIS president intersect in one person. Is that a surprise? Does this belong on SCt for 30 yrs?
@HoneyDemForce @ConcernedCLT Is it surprising that those three impulses intersect?
@naileric @CrsngthDrknss @akaBarni @KamalaHarris I don‚Äôt think there is one iota of a chance that the mob is going to rule, unless ‚Äúmob‚Äù means Senate Republicans who sweep this under the rug. Anyway, I think the conversation above is whether it‚Äôs taken seriously, and whether evidence so far creates a question. It does IMHO.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews Tell you what. Why don‚Äôt you read Grant‚Äôs last book and we can discuss it when you‚Äôre finished with it.
@CrsngthDrknss @naileric @akaBarni @KamalaHarris Be interesting to see if Kavanaugh would be willing to take a lie detector test, given that they‚Äôre not admissable and all.
@naileric @CrsngthDrknss @akaBarni @KamalaHarris Contemporaneous written records are very persuasive. If you read her story, it‚Äôs persuasive in/of itself. Mark Judge‚Äôs story also sounds consistent with the allegations. But the bottom line here is: *are we going to set a tone that truth doesn‚Äôt matter with an issue like this?*
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews That claim is not supported by research mentioned in that thread, FWIW. Diversity results in better performance for mature companies. Cultural Fit (homegeneity of opinion) is good for early startups, but becomes anchor weighing down companies when they have to compete.
@naileric @CrsngthDrknss @akaBarni @KamalaHarris Do u realize contemporaneous written records are admissable?Regardless, this isn‚Äôt a court of law. This is congressional hearing trying to determine the character of a lifetime appointment to S.Ct, and which is supposed to say something about what we care about as a country.
@MAGABROham @tomwcleary Read the article. It came out in couples therapy in 2012. She didn't want to be identified at all until she said it was leaked and then her sense of civil duty outweighed her fear of retaliation. It doesn't look like she needs money.
@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @ChuckGrassley @senorrinhatch @LindseyGrahamSC @JohnCornyn @SenMikeLee @tedcruz @JeffFlake @SenJohnKennedy @SenSasse @SenThomTillis @MikeCrapo Please don't let your legacy be that didn't care about sexual assault, character &amp; honesty.

@howeasyweforget @Justvintageme @realDonaldTrump Connect to huge tax breaks for wealthy who benefit from this in short term: it is middle/working class with stagnating wages (who will bear burden of deficits). Direction headed: oligopoly like RUS-an econ w/human capital and resources bigger than US, but economy size of Italy.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews You need to slow down and focus. Go back and reread what you write. It is not compelling. I want you to have snarter arguments. I want to test my own theories. You are not helping further a conversation or increase understanding. You are wasting your own time.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews There is a difference between a good guess and an assertion of fact. That is why it is good to do the research.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews #bipartisancivility. He bacame an independent. There are plenty of opportunities to fund political organizations which embody that. Trump does not. I might be able to name 3 R senators off top of my head. 1 died and 1 is leaving senate. Lot to worry about in Nov if u support T.

If ur in the .1%, u have so much more $ that folks @2% r carrying a disproportionate portion of your tax burden  2 support the country. relative benefits:burdens is so off scale it‚Äôs crazy irrational &amp;  threat 2 US
@mebeincom @nudog71 @OMGno2trump @GOP @SpeakerRyan The short term thinking is disturbing. It poses a threat to the future of this country and an abdication of the role as a global beacon for freedom, equality, and opportunity through democracy. Just so a few people can have a lot right now.

@nomadphils @Ok_la_ho_ma @dukewsu @jbkoleen21 @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter When would you say the US experienced mass immigration? 		Here is an example of lack of diversity resulting in very bad groupthink: https://t.co/9soxYXbsNX
@dukewsu @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter I think that is kind of what is going on here. You can stay in your echo chamber and have bad ideas or you can engage outside the echo chamber and maybe come up with good ideas. The internet is a mature organization. It is time to branch out. #diversity
@dukewsu @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter BTW, USA‚Äôs economic competitors want the US to engage in groupthink so it gets disrupted from the outside.
@dukewsu @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter There are a lot of good people. Some think just like you and others have different experiences and challenge you to innovate. Second is better for a mature organization.
@dukewsu @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter I just quoted it for u. I thought you would need help.
@dukewsu @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter ‚ÄúYou attract same kinds of people b/c culture fit is proxy 4, ‚ÄòAre u similar 2 me?

@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews Issue isn‚Äôt whether he ever gave trump money, it is that he will stop supporting the party because of trump.
@dukewsu @JSternburgProd @AnnCoulter Actually compelling research says that culture fit is only helpful in the beginning of a project. As it matures diversity is crucial to success. 	https://t.co/m5lYq1dPFQ
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews Noted. Most importantly, however, always do the research.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews So first guess was asserted as fact. Stupid me. I accepted it as a fact. Will keep that in mind next time I read something you assert.
@AnnCoulter Prior to WW1 40% of NYC‚Äôers were immigrants, so anything you see in that picture that is precious to you was probably built partly by an immigrant. #diversity		https://t.co/btq8nzrznh
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews So you already knew his name.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews Just made that up?
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews You didn‚Äôt know his name when you posted this?
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews You don‚Äôt think Trump wants to  move US in the direction of the governments he praises?
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews @BarackObama Check the date of that article. Trump wasn‚Äôt even the nominee when it was published.
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews You‚Äôd already called him a never Trumper. Just a guess?
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews Sure. Btw why ask his name if you knew it?
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews @BarackObama #bipartisancivilty
@sxdoc @jenrobertson2o2 From same article: As a congresswoman, she voted against approving the Iran deal and, this past April, backed President Donald Trump's decision to strike Syria. In 2015, she voted with Repub‚Äôs to stop admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees until the vetting process was strengthened
@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews If we keep emulating Russia, it is going to peter out.

@Basil_Fawlty62 @BreitbartNews Again, in a different way, Trump is making the case against himself. The tanking approval ratings consist of a lot of independents and Republicans responding to Trump presentation of himelf.

@Srcpt2 @RightSideSkirt @NFL You're just getting caught in the cross-fire. This isn't so much for you as it is just publicly providing the evidence to support an argument I made upthread (which was that stock price the day after the announcement wasn't a great measure of whether this ad campaign appeals).
@GovMikeHuckabee Honestly, probably because the special counsel hasn't finished its work. Also, don't confuse a "nasty story" with news. What do you think is nasty? Reporting on the Manafort plea deal? Reporting on a Trump tweet or policy, like separating parents from children, or on Helsinki?
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL It has been a week and Nike's ad wasn't supposed to result in profit over that short of a horizon, but it's still worth noting that the stock price now reflects the boost in sales and is at an all time high.		https://t.co/YIJCzjIAgl
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @Wendys Of course, if the same person is behind both accounts (which would not surprise me) it might not be much of a battle.
@Srcpt2 @redandriogrande @queserasera320 @DorianMStarkey @HillaryClinton Also note that Cohen has admitted to "campaign finance violations" according to a Fox News report (so you believe it). Good thing that charge has nothing to do with the campaign, or things would look bad for Trump, eh? :)
@Srcpt2 @redandriogrande @queserasera320 @DorianMStarkey @HillaryClinton Credence in the media? At least let's agree not to trust the NY Post, where Manafort was apparently able to plant lies about Tymoshenko's political opponent.		https://t.co/pulxibQorM

@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Story of the year is probably going to have ‚ÄúManafort‚Äù in the headline.
@WFISCHER412 @SarahPalinUSA Trump‚Äôs vision of America (antipress, anti-knowledge, divisions based on race, xenophobia, concentration of wealth) results in a smaller economy and weaker nation.  That is Putin‚Äôs goal in Europe and US.
@WFISCHER412 @SarahPalinUSA Whatever happens in the short term, economies and political structures like Putin‚Äôs (oligopolistic non-democracies) fail miserably. That‚Äôs why they have to subvert liberal democracies like the US and EU.
@WFISCHER412 @SarahPalinUSA If fighting for democracy against fascists and dictators like Hirohito, Hitler, Mussloni wasn‚Äôt worth the effort, then we have wasted a lot of time, money and lives. Democracy is worth fighting for.
@Srcpt2 @redandriogrande @queserasera320 @DorianMStarkey @HillaryClinton That was the charge. Trial was going to start on Monday.

@CraigDavis62 @PattyMurray Trump administration imposed a policy of prosecuting all people who illegally cross the US border with Mex. Because of the ruling prohibiting children from being indefinitely detained, more than 2K children were separated from their parents and other adults from 5/5 to 6/9

@Srcpt2 @NowAmericaGreat @Kaepernick7 Just reminding everyone that the problem of low foreign worker wages for high price American products isn‚Äôt unique to Nike, so, if you‚Äôre mad at Nike because of CK, should prob focus on why you don‚Äôt like CK (unless you want to give Ivanka equal time on the wage issue).

@AnnCoulter If your theory were true, every confrontation would end in death. I suspect something else is going on besides strength differentials.
@AnnCoulter Only strongest men shld b cops? In any confrontation, chance 2 parties have = strength is low. 1 is stronger. 1 weaker. By your logic, fatal force correlates with what? That strength is not =? Strength differentials? Test that theory before denying weak men jobs.

@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL How can I give this tweet more than just one heart?
@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL Not fair that men can take shirts off without penalty though, no? Serena is also a great vehicle for the message in that ad. (Stipulating that the company might deserve some scrutiny.)
@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL Btw the way, Serena also got paid for that ad. She is a woman who can‚Äôt dress the way she wants at work.
@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL btw, I m not defending the company‚Äôs employment practices. Only explaining the choice (they don‚Äôt care about diminishing number of US football fans and their purchasing power). Watch that ad and list sports shown. I‚Äôll get started: 1) skateboarding...
@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL I picked a sport more prominently featured in that ad than NFL football. :)
@Ich_Currywurst @Srcpt2 @RightSideSkirt @NFL ?
@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL He got paid by Nike to broadly publicize and authentic message about overcoming  adversity. If you think it is against Nike‚Äôs interst to publicize that authentic meassage, I‚Äôd score it 15-Love, Kapernick‚Äôs serve.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @NFL How am I defending the company? Will you at least concede that anger directed at the NFL because of this Nike ad makes no sense? Or explain how it does.
@Srcpt2 @Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @NFL That‚Äôs s comment that easily could be said about any company with enough customers to pay for marketing that can put its spokespeople in front of millions of eyeballs.
@Ich_Currywurst @RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL Excellent point. Not the issue tho. Q is why did Nike do this &amp; A is not b/c of market cap the day after. It is b/c of market cap over the long term. Issue is also whether NFL is to blame &amp; they have absolutely zero  part of Nike ad.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL Pot meet kettle btw. Apologies if your legal name is Proud Patriot or Right S. Skirt.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL Oh lord. Let us leave all of this at, let‚Äôs see how Nike is doing in the future.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL (It‚Äôs not your yard. Mute me if you don‚Äôt want your theories challenged and tested.)
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL Chamber not echoing enough for you?
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL Btw, you think Nike sales went down $3.7 billion because of this ad?
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL So, yes. Boycott the NFL because of this ad.That makes sense./s/Might be time to actually watch the add if that‚Äôs the conclusion you‚Äôve come to.
@Srcpt2 @RightSideSkirt @NFL In fact, getting angry at NFL because of this Nike add is taking the bait. Obviously this isn‚Äôt NFL-sanctioned. If anything, it‚Äôs going to make kids facing obstacles take up skateboarding and tennis.
@Srcpt2 @RightSideSkirt @NFL And the NFL market is getting smaller, which is why Nike is running adds like this‚Äîthey‚Äôre making an appeal to a bigger worldwide market. No chance in the world the bean counters at Nike haven‚Äôt played out this campaign and arrived at it being a loser.
@Srcpt2 @RightSideSkirt @NFL Furthermore, watch that add. There‚Äôs some football in it at the end. Wasn‚Äôt NFL football, right? This isn‚Äôt about football and the NFL. They‚Äôre aiming for something bigger.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL If by, ‚Äútroll‚Äù you mean ‚Äúpropose ways to measure your theories‚Äù, yeah, sorry. I‚Äôll go somewhere other than this subthread to do that since it‚Äôs not welcome here in this subthread, apparently.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL If that‚Äôs your measure, be prepared to defend that argument in 1 month, 1 year, 5 years when we‚Äôll look again market valuation, when we look at worldwide sales, and when we look at Nike performance relative to rest of market.
@RightSideSkirt @Srcpt2 @NFL ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not watching the NFL‚Äù response is big reason Nike can do this &amp; have it make biz sense. The brand is bigger than football &amp; USA. Messages in the vid (diversity, gen-x sports, disability, work through adversity) in face of divided culturally weak USA r powerful worldwide.

@AnnCoulter Private sector profits up while wages stagnate. Rather than cut public sector wages, maybe you should try to shame the private sector into sharing the wealth they‚Äôre creating with employees.		https://t.co/8Pl3hyHP1H
@tedcruz Is this for the farewell tour?
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan Is DOJ is getting too many guilty pleas and convictions or too few?
@Basil_Fawlty62 @AmyOttinger415 @DevinNunes He possibly really good at compromising national security!		He can spend all day every day at In-n-Out and we‚Äôll all be better off.		https://t.co/aMioMPWesC
@tedcruz Really sad. Don weakens America (for Putin) so Hollywood (US) profits depend on selling movies outside the US where, thnx to Trump, seeing American flag makes auds feel they are watching a movie about something that doesn‚Äôt care about the rest of the world. Fredo, heal thyself.
@reductiologic @BillOReilly @NoSpinNews FTFY: Last sentence, ‚ÄúLet us think for you.‚Äù
@Fourseas2005 @spdustin @AnnCoulter The hints haven‚Äôt been subtle.
@AnnCoulter Your cmnt might be more interesting if u haven‚Äôt been advocating for policies &amp; politicians who‚Äôve driven down economic power of prvt sector workers all your life. Instead it feels like you‚Äôre just trying to pick the last pocket. Love those taxbreaks for ultrawealthy though, eh?
@DevinNunes Please do eat at in-n-out everyday. They are delicious and have no locations in DC.		https://t.co/89VPEyb5x2
@lifeinteralia @derekahunter Gotta love the race for the bottom. Private sector sets low bar? No worries. We can make things worse by making it the bar for everyone. Maybe if private sector salaries had been rocketing the last couple decades would I care that the public sector salaries are much higher.
@AnnCoulter Why stop at just Federal workers? Rich people get even better benefits than the ones you listed for Federal workers. Should we reduce by 50% the wages of the wealthy too?
@DevinNunes There aren‚Äôt any in DC, right?
@BeckyBBCR @DevinNunes They‚Äôre always packed!		https://t.co/aR2Xe4f5dK
@AmyOttinger415 @DevinNunes Better he spends his time on this than on compromising national security!		https://t.co/N67ly6Bcx1
@RickSantorum @AndyOstroy @jimsciutto @jrpsaki His voice in the Cohen recording shows concern for family. He didn‚Äôt want them to be upset that he lost the election. He had to engage in FEC violations to protect them. 		https://t.co/zqkG4XKHjH
@DevinNunes All of this over a 25k campaign donation!		I love in n out, but it‚Äôs not the Dorsey 		https://t.co/uEUwbeWnv2
@rwhiteteacher @grofit44 @JasonWhite913 @Hrothgar1000 @AnnCoulter If that pic were a problem for McCain, then a lot of people are going to have Maria Butina problems. 		https://t.co/bMLMoxCk4X		https://t.co/XRqRdU1Nau
@spdustin @AnnCoulter I‚Äôve been Twitter surfing today and I get the distinct impression that Ann Coulter is unwell.
@BillOReilly @KimStrassel It is hard to do your job hen everyone is lying to you. 		https://t.co/kSbow0Vvmv
@tedcruz Careful now. Don‚Äôt take it too far. 		https://t.co/RLWUGOkD7A
@tedcruz Trump is going to play Michael Corleone to your Fredo and plant a big kiss on your campaign before he kills it?		For perfect symmetry you should have the event at the Hotel Nacional 	https://t.co/l3aFwHwJef
@Spoon6724 @BillOReilly Here are some theories about who is responsible		https://t.co/SnihTPjlvr
@BillOReilly Hopefully the Alex Jones trial will allocate the costs of this stuff in a way that helps discourage it. #coasetheorem #paretoefficientoutcome #chicagoschool #neoclassicaleconomics

@RickSantorum @AndyOstroy @jimsciutto @jrpsaki *were* clearly in on the caper
@marcorubio Perhaps it can be solved with a Blue Wave?
@RickSantorum I love the poorly educated!		https://t.co/UD8pHDDduv		Yes, let‚Äôs stop public support for education. I‚Äôm sure Betsy DeVos has better ideas about how to poorly educate Americans.
@RealJamesWoods @tedcruz https://t.co/3lkJFnpfNG
@RickSantorum Is that Consol or your conscience speaking?
@RickSantorum @AndyOstroy @jimsciutto @jrpsaki He revealed to his CFO, whoever cuts checks for his company, his taxi cab medallion guy, the publisher and legal team at supermarket rag tabloid what he was doing (but not the FEC)!!! What does that say about his attitude towards his family?
@RickSantorum @AndyOstroy @jimsciutto @jrpsaki Protecting family would be more a compelling argument if it weren‚Äôt the case that something like 20 of his business associates weren‚Äôt clearly in on the criminal enterprise.
@MaryAnn50148691 @RickSantorum Energy industry lobbyist hates pope for his position on environment. Says it‚Äôs about kids and sex crimes. Is cool with T. Did he ever complain about church‚Äôs crimes against children with any previous pope?
@ThunderRoad66 @RickSantorum A frothy mixture of hypocrisy and greed.
(Lack of ethics) and (stupidity)?
@RickSantorum on CNN I think you said everyone knew T‚Äôs poor character when they voted for him. Why was he paying to hide stories then? Some businessman! A frothy mixture of ___ and ___?
@shanevanderhart Bill: No convictions for real estate deal. Lied to his wife. Impeach trial fail. Donald: Felony campaign law violations-&gt;convictions. Possible treason. Helsinki!!! Picks SCOTUS nominee whose track record is he doesn‚Äôt like subjecting Prez to lawsuits. Hmm.
