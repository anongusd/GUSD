Trust your experience and vision. Keep a joyful and optimistic outlook. Trust the voters. Tell them how vitally important their votes are. A single vote could turn this race.
The worst smears will come so close to the election that you will not have time to respond. Inoculate the voters by warning them far in advance. Use the money and smear ads against them: ‚ÄùTake each smear ad you see as a measure of the fear of our victory.‚Äù
Candidate discord discourages voters. Opponents will use Divide and Conquer against you. They will suppress voting. Trusting the voters will serve you (and us) well. There will be tons of outside money in the race.  You will not be able to match the dark money.
