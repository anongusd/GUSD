The difference between Micro and Mini solar grids is, in Micro you generate electricity yourself then use while in Mini you pay for a generated electricity . I believe much more in Micro solar grids in solving Africa energy needs.

@bbc5live must Brazil win with the help of the referee?
@BBCSport yes, because the referee will not allow Colombia win no matter what they play. Bravo Colombia, I hail you guys
@CNNFC Brazil is winning with the help of the referee. He is the twelfth Brazilian player on the pitch.
@SuperSportBlitz Referee is the twelfth Brazilian player on the pitch. Colombia just try ur best. The ref have assignment to deliver. Hahah
@BBCSport referee is killing this match. Must Brazil win with the assistance of the ref?
@KickOff_Nigeria they should all go. They are killing football in dis country while hiding under corrupt FIFA law.
This defence line is letting Howard down

Thumps up to Howard Webb. Brazilians thought he will favor them. They better play well or forget it.
Howard Webb is in total control of this match. The earlier the Brazilians knows it and play good football the better it will be for them
@BBCSport I disagree with you 100% Chile is better or are you a Brazilian?
@BBCSport what is Hulk contribution to this Brazilian team?
@SuperSportBlitz Webb is truely in control of this match. It can go either way
