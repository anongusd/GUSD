@RobDauster what context? appears defender might have barely hit the ball or hand (of which is part of the ball)â€¦ where does that justify his actions at the other end of the court?
@Pauldadof6 Legal defensive position and verticality, defender can jump up...
@GioWFAN We need an ace...
Thank you for your service!! RIP!! https://t.co/eJBp5yx2NY
@Eagles @WesleyAthletics BS...he was down prior to extending the ball... if he was tackled up the field trying for a first down they would have marked the player short of first down... why a different interpretation?
@LarryFitzgerald Tremendous eulogy today!! If all of  us could get along as you and a true American hero did!!
@Pauldadof6 @beardbrand Looking good!!

@Coach_Centeno Coach, the problem is the humidity up and down the east coast... the courts absorb the moisture and the purrs become dangerous if temps not cold enough in venues...

@CoachAB34 Congrats!!
@JayBilas Agreed and they should institute 5 second count on ballhandler in womens game not only when holding the ball closely guarded but on the dribble closely guarded (in front court)  as well...
@klhoops That and when lining up for free throws, the player who fouled but swears i didnt foul, had all ball, will state the ball don't lie when free throw is missed
@NJCcoach Our nation didnt... an outdated electoral college vote did... and fact that less than 50% of population that can vote, don't vote!!
