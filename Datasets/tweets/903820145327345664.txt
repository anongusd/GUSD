@schraderwest @DxmJohansen @coalmining24 @GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump I appreciate your perspective and I do read to stay informed. but I also bridge that with experience &amp; a significant amount of time spent working &amp; serving communities that are considered impoverished and or inhabited primarily by minorities.

@LunasCrain Do need a path but simple wave of magic amnesty wand is not my idea of real solution.i enjoyed the debate!Have 2go2bed work early tomorrow
@LunasCrain Agree on that aspect of privilege, and am willing to share that with those who immigrate here legally.
@LunasCrain I wish u the best as you do!I encourage you to go for the legal path&amp;then work on it via the democracy that you will then be legally part of
@LunasCrain The dart of painting anyone with priv because they disagree with you or you can't convince them of your opinion is not what is reality here
@LunasCrain Please don't use priveldrge as a throw away dart.. this has been a lively respectful debate - we disagree and that is cool to discuss
@LunasCrain For the industry I work in I see many that don't,i see$under the table,I see&amp;talk 2those who have$on hand for themselves b/c they don't pay
@LunasCrain however we disagree on rights and privileges of legal vs illegal immigrants
@LunasCrain Agreed on 1% but disagree that it will fix problems of illegal https://t.co/DJQB1S2uRI sound like an intelligent person&amp;I enjoy the debate-
@LunasCrain I appreciate that you want to be an American I applaud your passion&amp;desire for that.however I can't apologize for wanting u to do it legally
@LunasCrain Can't change where I was born,can't change working my through college,can't change starting below the basement@my company&amp;working my way up
@LunasCrain Services and opportunities that others who immigrated legally or were naturalized citizens were not eligible for??
@LunasCrain Not moot - did every family who immigrated here illegally pay every tax that should have been collected on every $ earned, were they given
@LunasCrain Not ignorant-I am fully aware-I work very hard for myself&amp;my family, I pay my taxes&amp;feel all should be held to same standard and laws I am
@LunasCrain Not raining on the parade of immigrants wanting a better life,i applaud that,just again going back to the investment-time/$s/effort-legally
@LunasCrain It does work that way..  citizens are afforded certain rights and have obligations.opportunities are there and should be equal for citizens
@LunasCrain So education is a right if anyone who steps in US and wants it?Sory but it costs a lot.A lifetime of paying taxes is part of my contribution
@LunasCrain Expensive is not my problem.be willing to cover the cost and pay for the privilege doing it legally or don't immigrate&amp;contribute elsewhere
@LunasCrain Not misguided.I just believe in accountability and equality..accountable for following a legal path, equality for what everyone contributes
@LunasCrain No asking for a test, I am asking them to follow the legal process like everyone immigrating should - the complexity of that is what it is
@LunasCrain Helping those who can't help themselves and have gone through legal means to gain that support.
@LunasCrain Hospital at time of service because I do have insurance because my ability/being forced to pay covers those who don't pay - I have no prob
@LunasCrain Trouble is again going to social services and schools that are paid for via state taxes and property taxes, healthcare where I pay more at
@LunasCrain And neither will most Americans.crooked fing politicians- both sides-have robbed SS.trouble is gap in payments on taxes over a lifetime
