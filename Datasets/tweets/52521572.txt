Here’s a link to my rare uplifting thread about some dudes in Newark. https://t.co/lsoDSthFwG
Oh man I screwed up the threading. Hey @threadreaderapp can you unroll this? Thanks!
Jimmy spent years helping kids like Semaj, and it was cool to see him get his reward at Vonda’s. That’s service. And that’s all I got. END
I don’t really have a point. Jimmy told me lots of stories about kids he &amp; Cory knew who ended up in jail or in coffins. Semaj didn’t. 15
They all hugged it out. Jimmy got a little choked up. He kept saying: “Man, little Semaj with the dreads!” 14
His mom told Jimmy: “I want to thank you for everything you did for Semaj. Look at him now.” Semaj is shy but he says: “Thanks, coach.” 13
Semaj is now a linebacker on a full scholarship to Howard University. He’s majoring in civil engineering. 12
But there she was a dozen years later at Vonda’s, having lunch with her son. 11
The odds weren’t awesome for Semaj. He lived in the roughest part of Newark with a single mom who had brain cancer. 10
Turned out Jimmy coached him in Pop Warner. He lived a few blocks from the field, but Jimmy always drove him home to avoid the gangs. 9
The kid goes: “I’m Semaj.” Jimmy stares blankly. The kid goes: “You coached football, right?” Jimmy goes: “Little Semaj with the dreads?” 8
At one point he noticed a big young dude staring at him at another table. And Jimmy’s not shy. He goes: “Can I help you? Do I know you?” 7
After our tour Jimmy and I ate at Vonda’s on MLK Boulevard. He told stories about solving murders and coaching Pop Warner football. 6
At one point we thought we saw a guy pissing on Jimmy’s car. Turned out the guy was  just hiding drugs in his pants. But I digress. 5
Anyway, Jimmy showed me the neighborhood before I walked it with Cory. He was a great tour guide. 4
Jimmy got demoted for supporting Cory’s first run against a machine mayor. He was later Cory’s IG, then founded a nonprofit to help kids. 3
Jimmy was a Newark homicide detective who lived in Cory’s project, Brick Towers. That photo was him in the bodega across the street. 2

@ryanavent There was urgency in the WH. The left screaming about $1T wasted on Wall Street bailouts (which was all repaid) didn’t help!
@ryanavent the initial stimulus was too small, GOP austerity backlash kicked in too quickly. But US had fastest recovery of major economies.
Historical footnote: Lieberman was OK with more! Also: the tax cuts that many liberals denounced turned out to be very good stimulus.
@ryanavent Yes. But remember, Ds got another $700B in quieter stimulus by 2010 with no R help - payroll tax cuts, UI, state aid, etc.

The weird thing about these periodic debates over Republican racism is that the Republican president led the birther movement.
Although in retrospect it’s kind of funny that I traumatized my toddler because I misheard a word.
FWIW, Max says 1, Lina says 2, I’ll never forgive myself for 3. I got so mad. He seemed so brazen. I decided to teach him a lesson and ugh.
It was actually my flight from DC to Miami the day after inauguration, but otherwise, yeah, it was kinda weird. https://t.co/Im5jGXIwKv
3. Angrily punished Max for lying after he repeatedly claimed (with chocolate-smeared face) he had eaten a grape. He actually said “crepe.”
2. Taught Lina how to hit a proper forehand by nailing her in the face at close range.
1. Max fell at a playground and broke his arm; I told him he was fine, just wash it off.
My kids and I had a debate this morning about my worst parenting moment. Three very worthy contenders!

I cannot tell you how jarring it is that when @GreenDay comes on the radio my 8-year-old rolls her eyes and says "Oh, that music Daddy likes," as if they were Perry Como or something.
In any case right-wing Cubans are a sliver of FL Hispanics. It’s malpractice that Ds aren’t doing better with that demographic in Trump era.

@peterlattman Thanks man. (Also: we're old.)
Anyway I’m not very religious but I’m very fucking Jewish. I think a lot of Jews feel like that. And we notice there are still Nazis. END
My dad (who tends to keeps things in until they explode) goes: BECAUSE WE’RE JEWS! That was the end of Christmas for the Grunwalds.
One year driving home in our lime green Ford Torino station wagon my mom asked him my he got so sick every year at Christmas.
When I was a kid we thought my dad might be allergic to turkey or ham, because every year at Xmas dinner he got terrible stomach cramps.
A kind of funny story: my mom’s parents were also Germanized Jews who got out earlier and celebrated Christmas every year on Long Island.
That saying about how you might not care about politics but politics cares about you...yeah.
Omi and Opi lived long lives. They moved back to Germany when the government gave incentives to Jews!But “the Nazi times” defined so much.
Of course millions of others weren’t so lucky, including a lot of our relatives.
They eventually got on a boat to Chile in October 1939. My dad got scabies on the way over. But they made it to safety.
He was very lucky. His family got him a fake Uruguayan visa and he was out of Dachau six weeks later. “Before Christmas,” my dad recalls.
He always remembered when they got to Dachau there were pajamas with Jewish stars waiting on their cots. Obviously not a spontaneous thing.
Opi was taken to city hall with other Jews and lined up against a wall. He thought he was going to be shot.
His parents, my Omi and Opi, always considered themselves more German than Jewish, so they didn’t think they’d get swept up in the madness.
My dad’s first memory is hiding under a table 80 years ago tonight, when Nazis took his dad to Dachau on #Kristallnacht.
Did the caravan arrive yet? Is it too late to get all the illegal MS-13 lepers to vote in Florida?
Somebody wake up Bill Nelson and tell him there’s something happening.
It's true: Trump appointing an unqualified toady to be AG because he wants to kill the Mueller investigation is unsurprising. It's true: Trump has already said he thinks the AG's job is to protect him. But, like, that's bad.
The fear that Democrats have no path to take back the Senate in future elections seems overblown. The fear that America is in a constitutional crisis right now seems underblown.

Losing makes everyone look dumb but: 	* Florida Ds seemed less disorganized and lame than in the past.	* Beto and Abrams overperformed in red states and helped Ds get elected to Congress.	* Was there really a different strategy that could've saved Donnelly/McCaskill/Heitkamp?
@zpleat we'll find out in 2020!
If Ds hadn't gotten so understandably pumped up for Gillum/Abrams/Beto and beating McConnell/Nunes/King they'd be pretty ecstatic about taking out Kobach/Walker/Rohrbacher/Heller and getting to investigate Trump.
Also everyone from both countries should read @MarcACaputo's Florida Playbook every day.

The last two years have normalized the insane idea that Congress doesn't scrutinize the president. Trump will try to make oversight look like harassment and the media will have to decide how to react.
In January 09, Pete Sessions gave a Power Point to House GOP leaders: "The Purpose of the Minority Is To Become the Majority." Now he lost and it looks like the House GOP is going to be the minority again.
The Trump effect: @AndrewGillum has 1M votes more than Rick Scott got in 2014, and he's still losing. The mouth-in-chief gets people to the polls.
FL restoring voting rights for felons is a very big deal with very big 2020 implications. But we also passed some dumb anti-tax amendments that could screw up this state even worse than it's already screwed.

The Dow went up about 50% over Obama's first two years. It's up about 25% so far under Trump. I wonder how many Americans know that.
It's not the most important or worst thing, but the best example of the way Trump skews coverage is the way he tweets when the market goes up, so the stories are about him, then says nothing when the market goes down, so the stories are about the market.
The weirdest thing about the three days I spent watching @staceyabrams &amp; @BrianKempGA on rural bus tours is neither one ever mentioned Trump. Kemp didn't in towns where Trump won 75% of the vote. Abrams didn't for crowds where Trump would've won 0% of the vote.
I know we're supposed to pretend Trump's made-up slanders are just the way the game is played, but @AndrewGillum didn't steal anything, and the president of the United States (who paid $25M to students ripped off by his fake university) has no business calling Gillum a thief.

@SandrewFinance @rortybomb The concern is the slippery slope - exempting super-safe custodial assets could lead to future exemptions of assets that seem super-safe but might not be, defeating the purpose of SLR as a complement to risk-based.

@rortybomb Two of them are quoted in my article, as you know perfectly well. There's nothing nasty about expressing concern without vilifying those who feel less concern.
@mattyglesias @jonathanchait Matt I am pleased to hear that on this issue you believe describing situations correctly is good.
@rortybomb That op-ed was a measured discussion of pros and cons. Nothing nasty-bro about it. (And note the first paragraph points out that the attacks on the bill have been wildly overstated, which I guess makes it a Wall Street whore op-ed.)

@mattyglesias @Ted4P I think taking away people's health care is really bad. I think deporting activists to stop their activism is really bad. I think leaving the frequency of stress tests for $200B banks to the Fed's discretion is very mildly bad, and not deserving of the same vilification.
@mattyglesias @Ted4P I haven't defended it! Not once. I have suggested it isn't that big a deal, because it isn't. You said the same thing, but you seem to enjoy joining the pileon.
@Ted4P @mattyglesias Even Senator Warren likes many of the bill's goodies for community banks/rural lending. (I don't - I don't think it's important to promote community banks.) The 16 D's who voted yes think it's good overall despite the mild tweaks to DFA.
@mattyglesias I think "this is a very mild weakening of Dodd-Frank" and "vilifying people who support this is in good faith is a weird strategy given the existence of problems more pressing than technical changes to the supplemental leverage ratio for custodial banks" are consistent views.

9. My last thought: Does anyone have any confidence that our current political process even pretends to seek the best approaches to public policy? It feels almost naive to engage with the issues in a serious way. That's not as sad as what happened last week, but it's sad. END
8. Anyway, thanks for all the thoughtful feedback. It's a challenging public policy issue. I could imagine a serious political process where these kinds of ideas were stress-tested and debated by leaders who genuinely wanted to figure out the best ways to keep children safe.
7. The best argument was probably those stories you all sent about how even NYPD cops usually miss active shooters. That's a problem. But it's a problem for school security guards too, and nobody thinks arming them is crazy.
6. Those are all compelling downsides! They all deserve to be weighed against the potential upside. But there are also ways of limiting those downsides - by locking up guns, limiting eligibility to a few staff with elite training, etc.
5. The best critiques emphasized the downsides. They included:	- Danger of accidental shootings	- Danger of gun getting into wrong hands	- Even cops aren't great at shooting shooters, civilians would be worse	- Contributes to gun culture, idea that guns are the answer	- Cost
4. There's also a lot of anger that I'm talking about anything other than gun control. I  agree gun control is the key issue, but I'm willing to think about anything that might make the next Parkland less likely or less deadly. These massacres are the worst thing ever.
3. Bad arguments include:	"Most teachers/staff don't want to be armed!" (Then they shouldn't be armed.)	"Most teachers/staff aren't well-trained!" (True but some are.)	"You're another NRA shill." (No.)
2. There were a lot of smart evidence-based critiques of the idea of allowing some well-trained teachers or staff access to firearms in schools. I'll get to them in a second. But there were also a lot of knee-jerk straw-man critiques that addressed gun-nut versions of the idea.
1. I appreciate all the good-faith criticisms of my gun thoughts. And I'm OK with the angry lash-outs, too, because kids are dead and people are mad and people should be mad. Here are a few more thoughts you can ratio and then I'll shut up.  https://t.co/zLdYaK54ZJ
This is a good point about political calculus. But we’d take it as a package deal with an assault weapons ban, right? https://t.co/oMuizIHEgv
This is a legitimate cost-benefit concern. But it’s also a legitimate concern for security guards. https://t.co/LsyJHYygTS
Some teachers might be veterans or former cops. Some security guards don't seem to have Mossad-level training. Anyway, I see the responses are now turning to cost-benefit analysis. Which is legitimate. But a reminder this isn't just gun-nut insanity. https://t.co/iGfk6WnAxM
Thanks! But I wonder if that Parkland kid who said he wished Coach Feis had a gun that day got ratioed. https://t.co/iJD1SDuI2r
Obviously teachers shouldn’t be forced to be armed! But some are willing &amp; well-trained. Some might be better-trained than security guards. https://t.co/CT4jneQL9y
So many responses like this. And yet nobody seems to think we should keep guns away from police officers. https://t.co/vgsFSb1gg6
It's not a complete solution but if preventing Sandy Hooks and Parklands is the top priority (which it should be) I don't see why it should be rejected out of hand. Are all security guards better trained than teachers? https://t.co/ta3qw0vyfm
Guns:	1. The only issue I can think of that having kids changed my mind about.	2. Better background checks &amp; AWB now seem really important.	(deep breath)	3. Letting a few responsible well-trained teachers or staff have access to their guns at school doesn't seem so crazy.
Did Nixon ever have the chutzpah to claim Watergate didn't matter because it didn't decide the election? Because it obviously didn't. 1972 wasn't even close. But committing crimes, whether you're a president or just work for one, is bad whether or not it decides an election.

They're also restoring the deductions for medical expenses, college tuition, private activity bonds &amp; student loan interest. But all those goodies cost money. Is there going to be any reform in tax reform? https://t.co/MiEbCSQkqO
Janet Yellen's Fed chairmanship was basically perfect, and almost good enough to keep a white guy from getting her job.
It sounds like the changes to the Senate tax bill (lower top rate for individuals, earlier corporate rate cut, no corporate AMT, looser individual AMT, bigger pass-throughs for investors) should make it cost a lot more. They can't go over $1.5T.
@svdate @omorosa dude, she's the only WH official my wife has heard of except for Ivanka, Jared &amp; (for DHS/immigration reasons) Kelly.
A lot of responses like this. But @Omorosa is absolutely prominent, even if she wasn't always treated with respect. And it absolutely matters whether there's a black person in the workplace, especially that workplace. https://t.co/7s2PjpONRH
I get why the @Omorosa firing will be covered as a celebrity drama/Trump clownshow story but it seems like a big deal that there will be no prominent African-Americans in the White House.
This chart of the 2017 Democratic wave is also a brutal indictment of Jon Ossoff's epic fail. https://t.co/Lt7DZL8WPX
@MarcACaputo that's the lesson! trump needs to change something (I know, I know) or Rs are going to lose everywhere.
This is the right lesson. And this is why R leaders try to prop up Trump. If he's at 40%, they're in trouble. If he's at 30%, they're toast. https://t.co/iWpWjQOm2P
@MarcACaputo No, run a candidate who isn't as bad as Moore and the lesson is applicable. Ds almost won Mulvaney's seat in SC.
@MarcACaputo because Bama is why the lessons apply elsewhere!
@MarcACaputo I remember someone who thought the train wreck was going to win by six!
Some white Republicans were turned off by Moore's pedophilia but it looks like a lot more black Democrats were fired up by his racism.
As the Democratic wave blasts through Alabama, the consultants who helped Jon Ossoff lose must really be hoping nobody remembers they helped Jon Ossoff lose.
By the way nobody wrote in Nick Saban or Jeff Sessions or anyone else. It sounds like Rs who didn't support the pedophile stayed home.

@jbview I'm saying, we know ass-grabbing is wrong - come on, everyone knew that - so ass-grabbers shouldn't get to represent others. We have no idea if parties that follow through on that principle will benefit in the long run, but they should err on the side of doing what's right.
@jbview @dandrezner @Dahlialithwick @DouthatNYT Maybe. The thing is, the political consequences are always uncertain. Smart pundits are arguing both sides of whether forcing ass-grabbers to resign is expedient long-term politics. But everyone knows ass-grabbing is wrong.
A general point: Politicians (and political parties) should try to do the right thing, and pundits should try not to obsess about the potentially negative political consequences of trying to do the right thing.
"Grabbing asses can have negative professional consequences" is the first constructive message the political system has sent in quite a while.

Avastin costs $149,893 a year for colorectal cancer, $109,922 a year for lung cancer. Genentech stopped selling it for breast cancer, but only because IT DIDN'T WORK. https://t.co/WN8ndkyDXb
Cyramza for colorectal cancer costs $220,320 a year. (Thanks, Eli Lilly, and Trump's nominee for health secretary from Eli Lilly!) Fabrazyme costs $301,584, or $25K a month. Arcalyst costs $288,000. Aldurazyme costs $352,061.
Here are some of the "cheaper" ones. Pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis: $40,546 a year. Pegasys for Hep C: $47,353 a year. Humira for Crohn's &amp; colitis: $58,044 a year. That's practically the U.S median income!

@CFPB Mulvaney is Senate-confirmed, so he can wear two hats until there's a confirmed replacement for Cordray. The rumor had been Mnuchin would do this, so interesting Trump apparently picking harder-core conservative.
Mick Mulvaney said the @CFPB was a "sick, sad joke." Now Trump is apparently going to put him in charge of it.
@jonathanchait @intelligencer The Rs presumably hope  they'll be able to muddy the waters enough to get voters to focus on NFL-type stuff instead. It doesn't seem impossible; Trump's tax plan was regressive, too. Plus, they really want to cut rich people's taxes.

TrumpCare wouldn't just reduce the number of Americans with coverage. It would also reduce the coverage for Americans with coverage. 26 END
Obamacare wasn't just about extending insurance to the uninsured. It was also about making sure insurance truly covered the insured. 25
In other words, if you're one of the 150M people in this country who gets covered through an employer, this will affect you, too. 24
They're not screaming bloody murder. They must figure they'd be able to make up whatever they'd lose by squeezing sick people again. 23
Anyway, if TrumpCare was about to kill the mandate &amp; cut subsidies without gutting the rules, insurers would be screaming bloody murder. 22
It's true that those rules are onerous and micromanage-ish. They limit the profits of insurers. But that's why people like them. 21
It's complicated. But when Ted Cruz and the House Freedom Caucus insist that Ocare's onerous rules must go, this is what they mean. 20
Some decisions about issues like "essential benefits" and "annual caps" would shift to states. Others are still being hashed out. 19
Sometimes it's straightforward; they simply delete the rules requiring insurers to spend a certain % on claims. Sometimes it's fuzzier. 18
Rs keep saying they'll keep protections for pre-existing conditions and other protections consumers like, but their bills don't do that. 17
The answer, of course, is that they're confident TrumpCare will whittle away the rules that make it harder for them to gouge customers. 16
No mandate means fewer customers. Massive cuts in government spending means less revenue. So why aren't insurers freaking out? 15
So for insurers, Obamacare has profitable stuff and unprofitable stuff. And TrumpCare would strip away the profitable stuff. 14
When insurers don't hit that %, they have to refund the $ they didn't spend to their customers! They can't boost profits by skimping. 13
Obamacare placed a bunch of new burdens on insurers. For example, they're now required to spend a certain % of their premiums on claims. 12
Insurers can no longer impose annual or lifetime caps, so they can no longer stop paying for your care when you need a lot of care. 11
So insurers can no longer discriminate against customers with pre-existing conditions, who tend to require a lot of health care. 10
The only catch was insurers would have to abandon their old business model, which basically relied on avoiding payouts to sick people. 9
So under Obamacare, insurers are basically guaranteed a nation full of paying customers. Pretty sweet deal, right? 8
Of course, millions of Americans couldn't afford that product. So Obamacare included massive subsidies to help them pay their premiums! 7
They've been quiet even though they got huge benefits from Obamacare. Including a mandate requiring all Americans to buy their product! 6
Remember, insurers killed ClintonCare with Harry &amp; Louise ads. They have even more at stake now. So their silence is pretty interesting. 5
The best way to understand that is to think like an insurer, and to understand the pros and cons of Obamacare from that perspective. 4
Spoiler alert: It would erode the strong protections they got under Obamacare. Even though R's don't say that. 3 https://t.co/i72Z3Rp8fa
It's clear TrumpCare would squeeze Medicaid &amp; leave 20M without insurance. It's less obvious what it would do to people with insurance. 2
Most of the health care debate is simple: https://t.co/xynuyrSUOd But the part about insurance rules can be confusing. So: tweetstorm! 1
The best (but most onerous) part of Obamacare is rules stopping insurers from hosing sick people. GOP bills would erode those protections.
And second biggest is whether to take health insurance away from 20M Americans. https://t.co/YJ27IDAIIk

Is this a joke? Pure repeal means 20M+ lose coverage, more lose subsidies, everyone loses pre-ex protections, no savings to make bill work.

But Jim Bunning did, and when he stood up for his principles at a politically inconvenient moment, the GOP hated him for it. RIP. 23/End
Now of course R's are once again pushing tax cuts that would blow up the deficit, because they don't really care about the deficit. 22
The Republican brinksmanship that led to the debt crisis of 2011 and the sequester that everyone loves to hate was basically Bunningism. 21
The point is it was all about politics. R's were happy to portray Bunning as an off-message crank before they made his message their own. 20
And it turned out to be pretty good politics after all. The R's certainly didn't pay a price for stiffing the unemployed in 2010. 19
The Bunning rule, no new spending without offsets, became the new Republican mantra. R's began opposing disaster relief without offsets. 18
Millions lost benefits until Byrd's successor was appointed in July. Then the vote was 60-40. Only 2 Rs (Collins &amp; Snowe) voted yes. 17
In fact, when Sen Byrd died in June, the Senate no longer had 60 votes to extend unemployment benefits to victims of the Great Recession. 16
Three months later, unemployment benefits expired again. And by that time most Republicans had adopted the senile old coot's position. 15
Of course, there's a twist. 14
McConnell and other Rs portrayed Bunning as a senile old coot who was bitter about getting forced out. They went back to trashing Obama. 13
But eventually, Bunning got rolled. The unemployment extension passed overwhelmingly without offsets, 78-19. Remember: Not controversial! 12
Bunning held the Senate hostage for a week &amp; blocked benefits for millions, while Republicans trashed him for undercutting their message. 11
Of course, R's had never demanded offsets for the Bush tax cuts or wars. Their deficit talk was pure politics, and this was bad politics. 10
Politically, R's preferred to oppose "spending," not actual spending on sympathetic people. This wasn't the fight they wanted to pick. 9
Bunning's point was that R's were always talking about Obama's out-of-control debt &amp; deficits &amp; spending. Why not stand and fight? 8
DC Republicans were furious! The politics were awful. Bunning was making them look heartless when they wanted to blame Obama for the mess. 7
But Bunning objected. He decided to singlehandedly block the unemployment benefits unless Congress cut something else to pay for them. 6
This was not controversial! Unemployment had just hit 10%. Nobody thought the jobless were being lazy; there just weren't enough jobs. 5
Then in February 2010, the Senate was about to approve an extension of unemployment benefits for victims of the Great Recession. 4
Mitch McConnell dried up his fundraising, and Bunning grudgingly agreed not to run in 2010. He spent his last year in the Senate pissed. 3
Bunning was a reliable conservative vote, but crotchety, and in 2009 party leaders decided they wanted his seat for a new Republican. 2
One of my favorite stories for explaining today's Republican Party involves Senator Jim Bunning, who died Friday. So...tweetstorm! 1

This is the theme song for my story about Trump and Obamacare. Posting soon. https://t.co/oKkUFPCSYJ
Only 50 days into Trump presidency, but he hasn't really done anything yet, his biggest thing is in big trouble, and things only get harder.
Big @pauldemko scoop: WH analysis of repeal is even worse than CBO analysis. (And someone inside wants it known!) https://t.co/BGmyGvwKDT
@TopherSpiro @Avik @USCBO Ay dios mio.
@TopherSpiro @Avik @USCBO He disagrees with their analysis. In this case I disagree with his analysis but I don't think he's incompetent.
I don't think @Avik was calling @USCBO incompetent. As Yogi said, predictions are hard, especially about the future. https://t.co/OS9AtT6W81
This is accurate criticism of @USCBO, but good sign for Obamacare; fewer employers than expected dropped coverage. https://t.co/kCRL4O79tB
I guess Jesse James gave banks increased access to financial assets. And maybe Vietnam increased Lt. Dan's access to walking opportunities?
Three CBO takeaways for 2026:	24M more uninsured.	Everyone else gets less from their insurers.	Medicaid gets cut 25%. (Trump promised 0.)
Failing very biased so-called CBO says repealing Obamacare would eliminate coverage for 14M next year, 24M by 2026. https://t.co/egAl26EnR3
It would also be nice if calling out obvious BS before the BSers admit it's BS weren't so widely seen as a partisan activity. 14 END
We've made progress on calling out brazen climate BS; I'd argue that climate isn't the only area where he-said-she-said can mislead. 13
But I will say this: There no longer seems to be a media debate about whether the economy is solid. Even though the #'s haven't changed. 12
Yet again: I don't have a solution! It's hard to cover a campaign that's so hostile to basic fact patterns. People tried their best. 11
Trump managed to turn data into he-said/she-said's. Sometimes media noted specific lies about jobs &amp; crime, but not larger narrative. 10
This posed a real problem for journalism. Trump was saying that America was descending into hell. But the data were all showing otherwise. 9
And it wasn't just jobs. Teen pregnancy, graduation rates, crime, all that data were getting better. Trump just lied about them. 8
Yes, I banged my spoon on that high chair often.	2014: https://t.co/TzkI7ScTQi	2015:	https://t.co/TzkI7ScTQi	2016: https://t.co/41wMvp34OR 7
The problem is, those of us who tried to point out jobs data (and other data) that were getting objectively better were tagged as shills. 6
I know, no duh. Unemployment went from 10% in 2010 to sub-5% in 2016. Or if you prefer, U6 went from 17% to sub-10%. 15M people got jobs. 5
What Spicer was really confirming was that the unemployment rate has been improving for years. Which, again, is obviously true. 4
