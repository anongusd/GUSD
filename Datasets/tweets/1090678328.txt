@AOC You are talking about public opinion, but the law iis clear and if applied correctly we should not make mistakes. It is only when there is circumstantial evidence, what you point out, is true. Some prosecutors are over reaching and that's when problems happen.
@wintravis @realDonaldTrump OK, then Virginia will go Republican in 2021. DemocRATS are baby killers and are morally bankrupt.
@oliviaabland Makes me angry that this happened to you.
@SenSchumer Then work with @realDonaldTrump and fix it, Chuck. You may be able to redeem my vote.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer who is in charge? You have nerve!
@JohnBrennan Well, after hearing Robert McNamara admitting being skeptical whether we could win the Vietnam war, then everyone should question our security advisors. Also, the IRAQ leader WMD, right? Thank God the greatest generation had slightly better intelligence.

#FirstAmendment is a clear assault against the first amendment. It is had  to fathom the a person elected to US Congress would make a statement like @RepJohnYarmuth posted. @RepJohnYarmuth need to get to a constitution refresher class. https://t.co/W4Gq0xRnin
@realDonaldTrump I do not understand the @HouseDems position. If they acknowledge our immigration is broken, then what we  have done in the past legislation was not well thought out. We need to change our method otherwise we are doom to continue fail. Let's try the wall.

@RBReich Witch Hunt!
@SenBlumenthal Witch hunt. Get on with the countries
@JedediahBila well it sounds like left are trying to create some, is ridiculous!
@SenatorDurbin Dick, stop the witch hunt and get to work at fixing the country.
@AnnCoulter ain't that the truth
@AllenWest She is losing her power base. If @POTUS does 50%that's laid out then difficult for the democrats to regain.
@SenSchumer Chuck I hope you do not become irrelevant with fixing this country.  You response this morning was disheartening for me.
@AnnCoulter tough speech that topic to appose. Even CNN commentators have tough time bashing Trump's speak.
@AnnCoulter yes it has. You predicted Trump would win.
@AnnCoulter or demcrat!
@AnnCoulter yes that disturbs me their reaction.

@StandUpResist @RBReich resistance is futile. https://t.co/tQ6dpfNTQ7
@StandUpResist @RBReich if this were Jan 2018 &amp; had evidence, I on your side. But you are running only on emotion, cause bad decisions
@StandUpResist @RBReich 38 days and you can tell. I accepted BO, foreign policy was a disaster and created bad will between people&amp;police
@DavidChalian you left out the FBI approach the white house, mentioning story in @nytimes was bogus! You are twisting reporting!
@Newsday very sad. Bill was in Terminator and many supporting rolls.
@fannibal_me @laps35 @KevJames91 @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump not the first time.
@fannibal_me @laps35 @KevJames91 @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump AE= "know the rules of the game, then play it better than any one else."
@fannibal_me @laps35 @KevJames91 @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump popular vote is not how you win the presidency!
@JudgeJeanine @david_avella agreed!
@JudgeJeanine police need to follow the law. These politicians who part of sactuaries not supporting our blue need accountable.
@BillKristol the 96 &amp; 13 midterm election went badly for BC &amp; BO.. not if @POTUS achieves his campaign goals.  @DNC Will need a miracle.
@ryanobles how do you get half of a vote?
@RBReich despite your resistance, President Trump will protect you too, Robert.
@SenatorMenendez twisting the news is not news.
@JedediahBila I like you. You are responsible and kind hearted, but tough when you need. KUDOS!
@realDonaldTrump, News from liberal media not fake but twisted.  The media Mixes speculation with what's said + agenda = twisted news.
@AshPratte you are wrong about @POTUS, that news conference was what I voted for, I want swamp drained and pot stirred!
@RealJamesWoods @FoxNews good tweet jim. Soros is should  be investigated.
@davidaxelrod  Ok, but we (public) have to listen to distorded the true. The news media nolonger reports the news. The media creates news.
https://t.co/aTP6CjA4Bd  Wow, I do not think this needs comment.
@Jewish_Heritage thank for the follow. I think the proper support is now available for Israel.
@SenSchumer Chuck, Chuck. Chuck, as a person who vote for you,  please get on with the people business. Stop trying to create an issue!
@realDonaldTrump @DT_INCHARGE Donald Trump is in charge, despite the bad and unfair media coverage.
@danielggarza Not sure I agree with your assessment. https://t.co/1yIPfP9US6 Would this plan encourage manufacturing in the US?
@GeraldoRivera The Illinois &amp; CHICAGO politicians are to blame. Those particular politicians have no backbone to implement #Stop&amp;Frisk.
@JedediahBila Yes and media creating news for the politicians to even more like politicians!
@jaketapper stoking the fire Jake. Are you reporting the news or trying to create news.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump That is not what I heard! It is what the parties want to agree.
The bad news media! Beating a dead horse. Would this be considered animal cruelty? https://t.co/vh2VMkJuCx
@rabbijilljacobs @netanyahu what? What are drinking? Let have some, I want get loopy like you. Trump has Jewish family.
@NancyPelosi @YouTube if it were a right it would have been in the constitution. It is morally right to have healthcare.
@SenSchumer  I agree, so Confirm Gorsuch!
@NBCNews President Trump, keep up the good work.
@realDonaldTrump # President Donald I agree!
#CNN is not fair or balanced in how CNN reports the news. They simply are #PresidentTrumpbashers.
#TheresaMay has the right attitude. Hope more leaders follows her lead.

@bj_swingle hey girl. How is the race!
I do not believe the #USPresident is right having public disagreements with the prime minister of Isreal.
