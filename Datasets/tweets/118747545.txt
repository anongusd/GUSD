@digiphile @jetjocko @carlzimmer @jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker And sorry, I meant “beat” reporters, not “newt” reporters. But for the record, all my interviews with @newtgingrich while he was House Speaker were quite memorable.
@jetjocko @digiphile @carlzimmer @jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker Trust me, we appreciate the feedback! It’s really something we should keep in mind. And in general, I agree that it’s important to ask follow-up questions during presidential interviews. That matters.
@digiphile @jetjocko @carlzimmer @jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker I agree that we need beat reporters doing WH interviews, and more newt reporters covering the WH. We all benefit for that. 1 of my biggest frustrations as WH bureau chief is Obama would never sit down for an interview, so I couldn’t ask him questions about his climate policy.

@bradplumer @noahqk Hey there, feel free to email me if you want to continue this conversation offline, but the 33-34% reduction is projected for when the policy is fully implemented. The article shows that could be as late as 2037 (or as early as 2035). It’s not 2030.
The reason Trump can rewrite the Clean Power Plan is b/c it got blocked in court. Now environmentalists and Dem AGs have flipped the script, and the Trump administration suffered half a dozen environmental court losses in a single week https://t.co/0nCQaLppJ7
@Dougsmith1959 @realDonaldTrump @official_barak Yes, I did seek to highlight that the Obama-era rule has been stayed because of the challenge from Republican AGs and industry. Pruitt played a key role in that case, of course.
@Revkin Do you mean the 2030 projections, or further out? One thing that’s interesting is EPA now estimates CO2 emissions will drop by 33% over time under BAU, but that might be by 2037 (since the new rule won’t be fully implemented until sometime b/w 2035 &amp; 2037).

By 2030, according to administration officials, EPA's proposal would cut CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by between 0.7 percent and 1.5 percent, compared with a business-as-usual approach. By contrast, the Clean Power Plan would have cut emissions by roughly 19 percent by 2030.

@WatchThisHand @StephSwisher934 @washingtonpost @brady_dennis @jdawsey1 @ShawnBoburg @sullivank All the companies and donors we contacted confirmed each story we wrote on the job search Pruitt conducted for his wife, on the record. And his spokespeople did not contest the veracity on any piece we printed on the allegations against him. Not one. It’s not #FakeNews
@supertaschablue @washingtonpost @EricLiptonNYT Of course. I just listed some—not all—of our scoops. A 6-person @nytimes team- @EricLiptonNYT @LFFriedman @kenvogel @SteveEder @HirokoTabuchi @CoralMDavenport -also broke several major stories on this topic. And for the record, I’m a print NYT subscriber.
@CalCourtKy @washingtonpost @brady_dennis @jdawsey1 @ShawnBoburg @sullivank We write a great deal on policy as well; I was just listing some of the stories that uncovered allegations of ethical misconduct. And our @PostOpinions section accepts op-ed submissions from a range of writers, including scientists. Thanks for subscribing!
RT @T_Sittenfeld: I've been an enthusiastic @washingtonpost subscriber for almost 20 years and their incredible stories on Scott Pruitt are…
He’s brilliant, and @latimes is lucky to have him https://t.co/AUEd3QPLmp
@IRgetsreal The beauty of journalism is that there’s always another edition the next day (and another online post in a few minutes). Thanks for the feedback.
@KevinUhrm And I cut the “you’re” before “wondering” because of the character limit, but now regret that. So it should be, “if you’re wondering if a Post subscription is worth it...”
Thank you! Those subscriptions and our reporting possible. https://t.co/6hg4DRFL72
11/ BONUS: Pruitt made his security detail drive him to 3 locations to find his favorite Ritz-Carlton moisturizer.
10/ Pruitt asked Davis and another top aide, Sarah Greenwalt, to give him free legal advice on how to break his lease on a DC apartment without paying a penalty.
9/ Pruitt got one of his top aides, Samantha Dravis, to leverage her networks to get Marlyn a job, who then helped secure her a post at @judicialnetwork -later we broke that Pruitt told Dravis to find a job earning more than $200,000.
8/ Pruitt asked the CEO of a non-profit, Concordia, if he would talk to his wife about finding work. Concordia then hired Marlyn Pruitt to help work on a conference where the administrator spoke (at taxpayer expense).
7/ Pruitt enlisted his executive assistant Sydney Hupp in setting up a call with @ChickfilA executives to see if they’d grant his wife a franchise.
6/ Pruitt got his aide Millan Hupp to find him and his wife housing through an extensive, unpaid search--part of which took place during office hours and involved agency resources.
5/ The EPA upgraded the administrator’s SUVs at Pruitt’s request, to Chevy Suburbans, and then put bullet-proof covers on Pruitt’s SUV.
4/ GOP donor Sheldon Adelson helped set up Pruitt’s trip to Israel, which was abruptly scrapped after @washingtonpost reported the cost of Pruitt’s first-class travel.
3/ A lobbyist friend of his helped orchestrate Pruitt’s trip to Morocco, then landed a lucrative contract with the Moroccan government.
2/ That his Italy trip cost taxpayers more than 100K, and other first-class flights cost them thousands more.
1/ The fact that he ordered a soundproof phone booth for $25K-and then, that the price tag reached $43K
1/ If wondering if a @washingtonpost subscription is worth it, I thought it would be worth listing the stories we broke on Pruitt’s spending and management over the past year. So here's a top 10, featuring work by @brady_dennis @jdawsey1 with help from @ShawnBoburg @sullivank

We name his lobbying firm, and his salary. We link to the A1 story from Friday on his lobbying work, and published a Q and A in which we asked him about it. “Wonk” means policy expert-we show how he will use that expertise to advance Trump’s policies. https://t.co/crvPACQveV
The new leaders are just as committed to pursuing regulatory rollbacks, just lower profile https://t.co/raiSoR0D8i
Also, the story doesn't dwell on how #Pruitt violated federal ethics rules, which we've covered in great detail. It explores the policy implications of leadership changes at @EPA and other departments.
Please read the piece, which is about technocrats’ rise within Trump’s Cabinet. Those were a couple of small details, but the broader story is about how experienced Washington hands are making inroads among the administration’s hierarchy https://t.co/iqTKSfcDui

He regularly returned the bottles for recycling. https://t.co/290kSB8Slr

8/ Pruitt also routinely asked his assistants to place hotel bookings on their personal credit cards. Sydney Hupp ended up being stuck with a $600 bill for the hotel Pruitt's family stayed in during the transition: when he didn't pay her back, his chief of staff paid Hupp in cash
7/ When Pruitt spoke to Dravis about finding employment for his wife, he suggested she find a post earning more than $200,000 a year (the short-term job she landed, at @judicialnetwork did not meet that benchmark)
6/ And the lawyer tasked w/ preparing Pruitt's financial disclosure forms during the transition asked @EPA ethics officials to establish procedures to ensure that his travel and political activity didn't violate federal rules
5/ It wasn't just Dravis and Jackson who raised concerns. Oklahoma state supreme court justice Patrick Wyrick, who's in line for a federal judgeship and mentioned as a SCOTUS candidate, also warned Pruitt before &amp; after he took over the EPA to curb his spending
4/ Jackson also told investigators that he connected @EPAScottPruitt to lobbyist Steve Hart to strike a deal paying $50/night for renting his wife's condo, but Pruitt was supposed to stay there for just 6 weeks
3/ Pruitt's current chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, told @GOPoversight that he, along with Dravis, objected to the administrator's frequent use of first-class travel

@GordonGekkoCell @jdawsey1 @brady_dennis @ShawnBoburg This did take place after the Chick-fil-A petered out, yes.
A @judicialnetwork spokesman said Marlyn Pruitt’s work was related to setting up new offices. “She has great organizational skills, and she was retained by JCN at a time when the organization needed those skills,” he said.
At no time did @EPAScottPruitt consult @EPA ethics officials about the push to find his wife work. Instead, he enlisted the help of GOP political law attorney Cleta Mitchell, a longtime friend who's helped establish his legal defense fund.
Pruitt asked Samantha Dravis, then-associate administrator for EPA's Office of Policy, to spearhead the job search for Marlyn last fall. Dravis told friends at the time that she felt pressured to tap Pruitt's political network, and her own.
“I couldn’t find anything that made sense, that wasn’t some kind of conflict,” Deason said. “I’d get a list of names, and say, ‘Here are some people, here’s what they do,’ and it didn’t take long before it was pretty obvious that I was not going to be able to help.”
Key details: Pruitt tapped Trump donor Doug Deason, a major Trump donor, to find Marlyn Pruitt a job. When Deason said he couldn't hire her b/c of his firm's oil and gas investments, Pruitt continued to try to solicit Deason's help.
