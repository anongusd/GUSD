@chantasyalexis @TheSunflowerMac @kkendalllieghh You're right, after Granny killed a leopard she carved it into Leopard Loin Chops and distributed them to the Kenyan locals for a grand feast. Then everyone clapped.		Trophy hunters hunt leopards for their skins, not their meat. Again, you know this and are being disingenuous.
@chantasyalexis @TheSunflowerMac @kkendalllieghh Why are you pretending trophy hunters hunt altruistically? Trophy hunters kill for fun, the positive externalities are products of unneccessary cruelty.		And leopards shot by Americans don't provide meat to anyone. Which you know. I'M tired of arguing with dissemblers.
@kkendalllieghh You and your grandmother are both oblivious heartless monsters lol
@chantasyalexis @TheSunflowerMac @kkendalllieghh Trophy hunters hunt because they are cruel.		If trophy hunters cared so much about conservation, they would take the money they pay for a hunt and donate it DIRECTLY to conservation groups.		They don't because they are sickos who enjoy killing for sport.

@RAINbyte @JasJWright Is "potatoe" a regional variant spelling in Indiana? I always thought it was just a (albeit relatively common) misspelling

@SpoderAlexis @eric_d_williams In a vacuum you're right, but Rivers has made a career of bitching at every referee he sees		Of course, my team's QB is Eli "Mr. Potato Head" Manning, who is very polite and currently sucks. So who am I to judge, really
@SpoderAlexis @eric_d_williams Rivers is the soft one for acting like anyone who breaths on him committed a war crime. Don't get me wrong, he's not the only QB to low-key dream of flag football (Brady's another one),  but celebrating injury is bush no matter how you want to justify it
@SpoderAlexis @eric_d_williams Celebrating somebody getting hurt, because they got hurt trying to hit you, is being a crybaby (and celebrating somebody getting hurt ever is bush-league)
@eric_d_williams Is there a bigger crybaby in the sport (QB division)?
@Based_Chargers @JuMosq @AllbrightNFL *17, in 2011. And the defense played well that SB - but played poorly the whole season overall. Both were true. Just like you can impugn Eli for his career performance, but acknowledge he played very well/clutch in the 07 and 11 runs...which is what we're trying to determine
@JuMosq @AllbrightNFL Of course, it also depends on def of "valuable." Is it more "valuable" to be worse on a per-game basis but have two sick SB-runs, or even just elevated-play game-winning drives, or play better across multiple playoff games but never win the big one? A philosophic question
@JuMosq @AllbrightNFL Gotta watch the games. Eli dragged that team into and though the 2011 playoffs. Despite the narrative, the defense was bad that year and was carried by QB play
@JuMosq @AllbrightNFL Rivers at 14 and Eli at 30 is an example of how while stats are extremely valuable, they cannot tell you everything

@behindhomeplate @SNYtv To be sure. I just worry he's subconsciously overvaluing "his" old guys because he knows them much better than the average GM knows the average free agent
@SNYtv Just like Robinson Cano...another former BVW client, as is Realmuto. Hmmm
@JoeyDG54 Or: are former New York Mets utility infielder Wilmer Flores
@PSLToFlushing Why not get Ramos and two good bullpen arms (Familia and Robertson?) and sign Billy Hamilton for a defense-forward CF platoon (easy to end if/when Cespedes comes back)
@JeffD08227013 @MrCapMorgan @JonHeyman Genuinely, I would prefer Ramos+Nimmo+money for relievers to Realmuto+Pollock		However! I would be very open to dealing Rosario (who I do like) if the Mets thought Gimenez was ready OR if they signed Machado (pause for laughter). MI is bigger organizational strengh post-Cano deal
@MrCapMorgan @JeffD08227013 @JonHeyman Catchers decline quickly (see LuCroy) and trading for this one vis a vis an FA signing creates another hole		Also Conforto, Nimmo, and to a lesser extent Rosario are established big leaguers - NOT prospects. Conforto is a former All-Star himself!
@JeffD08227013 @MrCapMorgan @JonHeyman More to the point, they would replace Nimmo with Pollock, who is worse, more expensive, and consistently broken. It would be ridiculously stupid. This series of moves is not worth it and the Mets would be set back for years		But wait, isn't Realmuto a former BVW client? Hmmmm....

@tommyb31301 @mord134 @martinonyc The next move is to trade Thor for far worse players than we sent to SEA, to stick Lugo back in the rotation, to overpay for one more FA reliever, and for the Wilpons to pray Cano gets bused for PEDs again so they don't have to pay him any money		Sorry to have to break it to you
@richmacleod It's a horrific deal. The RETURN isn't bad, but you can have a good return on a bad deal when a merely decent negotiating ability would have gotten a much better one		BVW got hosed, even if Cano rakes and Diaz is a stud, because he failed to reach maximum marginal value
@AlbaneseLaura Pretty sure that "opportunistic" line was added in, very weirdly, in the Michael Buble version		The original song, in the context it was written and performed in (1950s), is not problematic imo. But that added line makes that particular cover indisputably much creepier
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Public and private lands are best enjoyed when ecologically healthy		The presence of wolves across the fullest recognizable extent of their natural range is key to a more vibrant environment		The shooting of wolves for fun or from fear is grotesque, as is the idea of delisting
@wsucougar08 @Joelsherman1 You're right! There are exceptions always. Robbie Cano's a HOF talent. But so was Robbie Alomar, and the Mets got burned by that trade. And there's no DH to bail Cano out now		I'll be happy if he outproduces McNeil next year. If he hits 6 wins, I'll eat my hat (in a good way!)
@wsucougar08 @Joelsherman1 I'm aware of his stats. But in the post-steroid era, players of Cano's age hit the wall harder and more suddenly than they used to, and that Cano felt PEDs were a worthwhile risk reinforces that point (yes, I know he played well post-suspension)		Love to be proven wrong, but...
@wsucougar08 @Joelsherman1 Cano's a six-win player? At 36 coming off a PED suspension? No chance. 2 to 1 odds he's injured by June and ends the season hitting .265		Obviously it takes prospects to get Diaz, but by the Mets Iron Law, every player they trade will become an All-Star, so why send more than one

@LaughJack15 @jeffpearlman It's baseball, not the Geneva Convention. Morality shouldn't count for the HOF ballot.		Rules should. But imo, there's a difference between using in the Wild West steroid era, and in the current era, where the stakes are so clear. Cano/Manny would be "no" for me for that reason
@LaughJack15 @jeffpearlman Well, obviously the call is to immediately admit Pete Rose and Roger Clemens into the HOF as well
@jeffpearlman No, because you cannot tell the story of Major League Baseball without discussing Barry Bonds.		Plus pre-steroids Bonds would be a first-ballot HOFer if he'd never played a game beyond 1999
