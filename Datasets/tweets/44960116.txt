Jane Fonda had a big movie out this year. Her Netflix show, @GraceandFrankie, is entering its 5th season. She is busy campaigning across the country for farmworkers, and domestic workers, and restaurant workers. And SHE IS 80. She was made for this moment: https://t.co/o4KT8NFEXP
She went from Barbarella to getting arrested for her activism so quickly. She made mistakes, which she was very candid about. She spoke to me about the importance of thinking really carefully about what you want your life to be, and then going for it. https://t.co/o4KT8NFEXP
In the movie, and in my piece, she touches on so many things: growing up with a difficult father, losing her mother, struggling with an eating disorder, and deciding, in her early 30s as a young mother, to radically transform her life by becoming an activist.
.@HBO will release a documentary on Fonda's life, called Jane Fonda in Five Acts, on Sept 24th. I *highly* recommend you watch it. Very few people have lived such great, big, public and controversial lives.

Somewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo‚Äôs family just gathered together to watch his lovely 60 Minutes profile but had to sit through that Stormy Daniel‚Äôs segment first.
My extremely "no shit" advice is that it's probably a bad idea to have relationships with people who clearly disdain you, which is something Trump seems to have real trouble with.
That Stormy Daniels's lawyer is a former Rahm oppo research guy makes SO MUCH sense.

Also, let me use my Janet piece as a reminder: hire @megreenwell to edit your sports and culture features and me to write them. :)
@emilyctamkin he's one of my all time favorite interviews
Anyway, almost everyone blamed Janet, whose left breast was exposed on TV for 9/16ths of a second. People suspected she'd put him up to it. She issued a videotaped apology after it happened, then went quiet for a while. We all know what happened with Justin's career.
This was at a moment when video on demand technology was just coming into existence. People were still terrified by the idea of indecency infecting their children through the TV....a concern that seems almost quaint now.
This was one of the dumbest controversies ever. Michael Powell, then Chairman of the FCC, told me for this story: "I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on."
As you watch Justin Timberlake's Super Bowl performance this weekend, never forget that Nipplegate did major, lasting damage to Janet's career, but not his. https://t.co/eI83AEAhEP
