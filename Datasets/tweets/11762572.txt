@PwC_LLP @rob_gittings thank you for your leadership on this! @HeforShe #HeForShe
@PwC_LLP A10:  people to follow on #genderequity: @heforshe @phumzileunwomen @RaviKarkara @bciamagirl @girlup @emwatson #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A10: 1) join @HeForShe 2) join gender equity local group 3) talk about it w/friends 4) read about it #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A8: also millennial ambassadors like @Monedavis11 @BecauseImFreida @emwatson being vocal about their experience crucial #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A8:  @girlup &amp; @bciamagirl are also great programs training female #Millenials #Plurals to engage #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A8: efforts that work: teen male/female mixed sports leagues, sports groups like @valenciacf now #HeForShe, tech training for girls
@PwC_LLP A7:  outside of work: women are assaulted every 45 seconds in America: 30k human slaves in America, mostly women too  #heforshe
@ShannonSchuyler 1) show it's problem in #US (e.g., 5% of F500 CEOs are women); 2) show it's like other diversity issues @PwC_LLP #HeForShe
@PwC_LLP A6: after signing @heforshe, look for local efforts, also tell stories about @heforshe champions on social, to friends #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A6: after signing @heforshe, find CBO or NGO where you can take small bites of time to volunteer to ease into this work #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A5: that led me to take on #humantrafficking reporting beat, then @bciamagirl @heforshe as ambassador and spokesperson #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A5: like @rob_gittings, I have a mom, a sister, aunts: do I want them to earn 78 cents on a dollar or be 19% of Congress? #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A4:  also research contexts for men that are equally concerning for women: e.g., paternity/maternity leave policy #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A4: for men, engage in women's groups (@GirlsWhoCode); for women, engage men to join women's campaigns (@bciamagirl) #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A3: notice #maternity &amp; #paternity policies, notice pay structures, notice language in biz meetings "re: women in biz" #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A1: #feminism is enjoying a renaissance globally, a new gen, a new energy, a new phase; @unwomen is huge part of it #heforshe
@PwC_LLP A1: #genderequity is commonly associated as led by women. It's not a women's issue tho. It's a #humanrights issue. #heforshe

@NBCLA @V3con #NBCatV3:  thank you the chat was great!
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q4: the number of reporters may improve as well because cost of technoloy/reporter is going down
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q4:  could be on topic-beat reporter did a lot on, so when viewer pings reporter on topic, those reports could be fwded
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q4 interesting space to watch is automation, not as in fake posts, but using tech to help customize quickly
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q3:  I also set aside time to do digital everyday: maintenance, new story ideas, network outreach to grow connections
@TenaNBCLA  @NBCLA @NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat:  so true! it's a great place to show who reporters are and what they care about outside of work.
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q3:  so we shared Vines and Instagrams of grandfather and family praying together when it happened.
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q3:  Michael Brown's grandfather returning to shooting location, we spoke to him 3X, so wouldn't break in broadcast
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q3:  In #Ferguson, digital allowed me to report different layers as the days progressed even if we weren't live
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q3: Ain't no breaks. Eyes and fingers always moving.
@kellygoffLA @NBCLA @GadiNBCLA @NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  Gadi also hear you're doing panel on @periscope @meerkat tomorrow 10amP right?
@NBCLA @GadiNBCLA @kellygoffLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  has given us I think a tool we've needed, will see what uptake is? What u think?
@NBCLA @GadiNBCLA @kellygoffLA: Periscope and YouTube is awesome--went out and bought like 3 backup batteries &amp; portable steadicam #nbcatv3
@TenaNBCLA @NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  so right and even DMing to meet and get tips from your viewers one on one occasionally right?
@SFadguy has your media organization done this "bridge" idea--any best practices to share?  thx!  @NBCLA #NBCatV3
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  tweetdeck allows hard returns so you can do long lists or tweets taking up more real estate, for more attention
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2: i find Twitter is good for new polls or top10 lists; like to use tweetdeck
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  it varies on who you are &amp; space you live in but I use Twitter for useful info and breaking news, not fav foods
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  each social channel has different expectations from users and content providers, so try to respect that
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Chat Q2:  three purposes: #1 community, #2 24/7 reporting, #3 customized news delivery
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Q1: our new SoCal Bureau did the same--@KellyGoffLA probably knows more about that!
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Q1: we've moved two organizations together editorially and physically onto one floor and area: it's always a loud!
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Q1: we just launched the "Bridge" at @msnbc which brings together both digital and broadcast onto one editorial desk
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Q1: outcome is based on news gathering--better story, better reach. Digital &amp; broadcast pick separately for their broadcast
@NBCLA #NBCatV3 Q1: most stories I pitch have presence on all channels, weighting varies:  more specialized=more digital, broader=broadcast

@kngmerriweather so true. As @JoyAnnReid said, tomorrow will be a challenge for families as kids are not in school.
