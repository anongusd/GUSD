@cindy_deyoung @SunnyHamrick @jameshohmann It's just math. if 40% of the country went to college and 60% of them are Democrats, that would mean that at most, 24% of Americans are college educated Democrats. If we assume that there's about a 50/50 party split, then that means that at most half of Democrats have degrees.
@jonlovett Indifference
@cindy_deyoung @SunnyHamrick @jameshohmann It says that of people who go to college, more people are likely to be Democrats. Where does it say that 50+% of all Democrats have college degrees?
@PreetBharara That‚Äôs how deep the deep state is!
@JHWeissmann I‚Äôm Israeli American and I‚Äôm nauseated.
@SunnyHamrick @jameshohmann And again. Most Americans in general are poor so unless there‚Äôs a huuuge disparity within the party it‚Äôs safe to say that most Democrats are too. I‚Äôm defining poor as not having enough cash to be safe. https://t.co/BJTTBu5vt5
@SunnyHamrick @jameshohmann Since less than half the country went to college, most people in the country didn‚Äôt go to college. The split is 22 points so maybe I‚Äôm wrong and the percent of all Democrats with a degree is slightly above 50%. My point holds either way, there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúelite‚Äù about Democrats.
@cindy_deyoung @SunnyHamrick @jameshohmann This seems to be talking about the split within demographics. I‚Äôm not seeing anything about percent of total Democrats with a college degree.
@cindy_deyoung @SunnyHamrick @jameshohmann I meant that of people who are Democrats, more people don't have college degrees than do. I don't mean that there are fewer college educated Democrats than Republicans.
@AdamSerwer Also why is everyone‚Äôs obsession with identity politics making me feel oppressed?
@jameshohmann When will it end? Most Democrats are poor and don‚Äôt have a college education. They care about teachers at their schools not getting paid enough and bias in the criminal justice system. The person you voted for is a liar who abuses women. We‚Äôre not doing anything wrong.
