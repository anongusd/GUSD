@CorvettePassion Corvetta?
@cspanwj @Mil_FANet Military housing code is probably not far from general housing code. Its just you have poverty home issues on a military compound houses
@cspanwj @Mil_FANet Cutting corners
@cspanwj @Mil_FANet The description shows poor construction was used
@cspanwj @Mil_FANet Can't military housing be improved to make enrollment provocative?
No nukes
@cspanwj @RosenJeffrey @ConstitutionCtr Obama was also the political favorite. They didn't take Donald Trump serious until it was too late
@purduewilly @cspanwj We dont need illiterate immigrants telling why we should talk like they do. Or politicians making their districts citizens believe ice is trouble to them.
@purduewilly @cspanwj Not really. They do their jobs as defined. Law makers didnt let them and we have id, voter, and humanitarian crisis's because of it. Most citizens dont have to worry about the agencies becoming effective
@AJEnglish You gotta give it to kim for rockin the fade
@AOC I never got warning i was being fired.
@cspanwj Enable the agencies to do their job
@ABC I dont believe politics and eggs is appropriate of an official announcement of office bidding. Its a likeness to bacon and eggs. Police eggs politics eggs bacon eggs pay attention folks
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo What if the chinese the Russians europeans and americans were only two factions
@realColinHobby @cspanwj I thought it was because our premier politicians arent telling their voter that foreigners are paying then for the jobs and decline in infrastructure
@AnnCoulter Are they lying?
@Warzone_Maniac @AnnCoulter The medical 45k is way off. There are resident doctors doing solo surgeries. Half the injury or illness is just from bad institutions. If insurance is the problem, well, it isn't. You have patients with the same coverage as other low or no income folks and get care based on bias
@cspanwj @jimantle @amconmag What the future holds for politics sucks. A whole bunch of politicians now are jealous and are in positions to screw everyone because they wont get over the peoples executive electee
@cspanwj Some of worst infrastructure things ive seen in the last 5 years. 10 story buildings made of wood frim the 2nd up, no real American supervisors overseeing construction with citizen employees. Yoyr building people were are in a tariff war with
@cspanwj The dc trucker is right.
@cspanwj Some cities are also blighting their districts on purpose because the sanctuary funding has stopped. Im fine with that because it never shouldve started. Thats like taxing tobacco which isnt good for americans, but since nonsmokers got used to the money. Withdraw togetherness
@cspanwj Higher american born and raised engineering personnel so that were not adopting practices from smaller countries tgat have smaller things to accommodate.
@cspanwj obama declared elections infrastructure
@CNN Prgressives are not democrats or Republicans or independents
@cspanwj @amconmag @jimantle I voted for sue Hatfield. The problems loomed during the blumenthal reign in ct stem around election fraud. He allows illegals to vote and makes undermanaged agencies expand to exploit id accountability crisis's by his state dept
@cspanwj @amconmag @jimantle The humanitarian crisis south of the border is a federal issue. A state ag doesnt have jurisdiction. Infrastructure is a national emergency. Election systems etc. We have rights in this country that are citizens only. And the are racist np orgs running
@cspanwj @amconmag @jimantle President Trump has the lieu-tong connection to look foward to. Mr lieu stated his purpose for running but mr tong lied to ct voters. He also said last week that he plans to assemble ags from other states to sue the administration over the national emergency at the south border..

@penelope7usa @AnnCoulter @SecNielsen @realDonaldTrump Not anymore
@NewsHour Not how id say it but the nlrb and the unions took a hit from teachers making paying students/customers do their bidding while never actually teaching law
@cspanwj Upholding the constitution
@cspanwj Gun control national emergency wouldn't be good. David hoggs initial push was to hold captive victims of bullying. Any bullying victim wouldnt usually go in to a place with knowingly armed people. We need guns to protect us from illegals and their political clout
@cspanwj @nytimes @peterbakernyt I dont believe most attorney generals were elected to oppose the president. William tong is making a strategic error intentionally
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics Obamas plan made promises and pulled out once the municipalities were in. Theres a bigger problem
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics Obama infrastructure plan just about bankrupted a town and used eminent domain to abandon a neighborhood. Cost the town ar least 200000000 dollars
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics Midwest
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics So the new construction does not accomodate higher population
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics We have traffic jams because we are hiring contractors from countries tgat dont have a demand for small projects. Thats the type of thing that makes new bridges fall and wood structures above 4 stories during storm intensities
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics He hasnt investigated
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics Fyi. Infrastructure build and maintainence declined as congressional and senatorial lines became synonyms. Over the period of sanctuary
@cspanwj @eugenemulero @TransportTopics No deal on infrastructure. The structures need to be maintained properly. Infrastructure skimping is how that bridge collapsed. When they moved a support beam over 11 feet. Thats criminal
@cspanwj Sounds like that deal is weaponized
@JonathanShawUSA @Porchparty @RepCartwright Your not a law or medical grad.

@cspanwj A little off topic but didnt Venezuela put walls to prevent humanitarian aid?
@cspanwj And dont forget the headline authors district believes ice is their problem. Misrepresentation
@cspanwj The headline author told a young man that he needs ti be scared of them. Im not but the green deal is probably an agreement with the people they trafficked up here to green light target people. Green is gang language for hits (murders)
@cspanwj Its not really a green deal

@MeetThePress Arent we theoretically in a socialist regime now that most of the experience was voted out and the president does use social media and thats a growing trend that worked well enough for him?
@MeetThePress Socialism.
@ChapmanAllegra I dont think theirs a federal voting ban. Its on the states. Similar to not hiring excons. Its illegal to even ask or even have a detail section on applications. In the past the strategy was used to move people around the country in concentration
@Porchparty @JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Glad im not.
@SkyNews Bafta nafta no wonder nobody took it serious. Credit to those reporters
@cspanwj @ChapmanAllegra Why not make it just a special day off. Holiday has legislation in it. Election day itself would be  perversed as a celebration rather than citizens duty and right in the constitution of our great nation
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright No. There is no clear lines between dem rep cong sen. There used to be but before there was millennials you actually had to know stuff. I think your from the midwest though. Definitely no leader characteristics
@JudicialWatch Eric Holder?
@MeetThePress @RepAdamSchiff Dont private folks pose more of threat? Bezos soros?
@MeetThePress does vox media have anything to do with the church called vox? College buddies colleagues etc.
@MeetThePress the aca s problem is doctors. Spendong is a problem whencthe aca is billed for medical malpractice then med attorneys make laws protecting them from assaulting patients
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Youd make a fabulous leader over there
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Your on the other side
@university_fox The format of this style of media outletting sucks.
@CNN @ninaturner Theres easier non criminal ways of removing people you have elected.
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright You still didnt look that stuff up. You will be a treacherous leader
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright If i was id be more effective at leaving you incorrect.
@chucktodd @SenatorBennet Aca lead to brand spanking new medical malpractice laws, because the resident staff the non profits are profitting from are really screwing people up. Thats a bigger problem for us, the ice is for illegals
@ABCWorldNews Its probably a cpa issue. I think based on the paragraph posted agencies are balling a class action, fighting over whoz gonna take the case, or dont care because the agencies staff mainly dpnt make enough for a new BMW. Do not park them in garages

@cspanwj isis capturesd mali during the Obama administration
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright What really sucks and this is why were in the shit now, is that your now a graduate in something politcally related and have the power to argue but not to learn on the fly. Even worse is that we've already elected people worse than you and gave them more power.
@business Hes one billionare.
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Check cnn nbc abc fox rt Reuters any accredited news sources can help you ask questions which bring you satisfying answers

@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright I dont need to. The tweet that got you riled up is right under mr Cartwrights. What can we do to make you happy
@AJEnglish What of they make it like moonshine?
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright I commented your comprehension of our tweets.
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Your choosing to spend your time tweeting against me. Im older than you. Think of me as your professor and look it up

@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Its in the first comment you plagiarized
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Lets get back to basics. Your attacking. You think illegals are my rhetoric. You have the bezt college professors
@JonathanShawUSA @RepCartwright Your plagiarizing my tweets for your college papers? Your not my professor. The sources ate there if your mature enough to just look it up.
@CapnMAGA @cspanwj It was the Republicans first. Really lol. Actually Hillary she wasnt as mad as depending countries but was still pretty pissed. Disappointed.

@Demos_Org @cspanwj @MarkHuelsman Too late
@Demos_Org @cspanwj @MarkHuelsman Also most people go to college to make contacts. And get a degree by cheating. Then immigrant professors do things to screw the education like those yale law professors did to the nlrb
@Demos_Org @cspanwj @MarkHuelsman It doesnt. We have 23 year olds as senior editors.
@cspanwj @delislealleges @AEI @MarkHuelsman @Demos_Org ... And bullying the school official because hes of his physical appearance and single race upbringing. After working with him, bis school was rated top on the country. Black women are racist. Lawters judges doctors. Its how they treat me. They're not even sexy about it
@cspanwj @delislealleges @AEI @MarkHuelsman @Demos_Org We should also look at school performance in elected neighborhoods. I personally know a white guy who ive mildly counseled on dealing with positive enforcement in school, that doesn't stay with the students who are generally single parent African American...
@cspanwj @delislealleges @AEI @MarkHuelsman @Demos_Org Most of the feee education folks are obabma people. Free education will be just like the aca. Youll have high school sophomores twaching freshmen. Not to mention i personally get treated by the educated black woman as if they are racist
@cspanwj @ShaiAkabas @BPC_Bipartisan The call center issue is a big problem. First theyre not saving enough to betray Americans. Sencond, its part of the reason why all of our information is not secure
@NewsHour @MalcolmBrabant So, can the fed gov stop contracting international private entities to oversee citizens data?
@cspan @senatemajldr That new yprk abortion law should have limitions on it. Birth defects, are costly to the medical system among others
@cspan @SenateApprops @HouseAppropsGOP @AppropsDems Shumerpelosi tribe will change rules for presidential candidates to be illegals
@cspan @SenateApprops @HouseAppropsGOP @AppropsDems As well as border tunnels, since texas has at least 90000 illegals the prhers are probably burrowing in to missle silos
@cspan @SenateApprops @HouseAppropsGOP @AppropsDems To Mexico the tunnels may be considered legal
@cspanwj @RepVeasey The cost is crazily more because gentic defects are coming illegally and costing the medical industry more long term care, better than citizens npt worried about ice
@cspanwj @RepVeasey So, southern border immigrants are hired instead of natural born Americans
@cspanwj @RepVeasey His border state has 90000 documented illegal voters. Thats voter fraud

@cspanwj @WSJ @kristinapet Didnt they expand after sandyhook? Why arent the best people being nominated? How you gonna laws when you all should be getting your constituents back to work? Why do low performers get better rewards?
@billurself @cspanwj Where would you start?
@MSNBC Most white supremacists are not white
@thehill But what if he's wrong
@CBSNews You know what, lawyers should only be able to take money from proven citizens. It should be the lawyers job to accurately assess whether or not the persons have a trial right. And the lawyers should be penalized. Law schools aint right
@cspanwj @washingtonpost @fbarbash There is also a tariff war going on.
@cspanwj @washingtonpost @fbarbash Trump trump trump. The President probably can. If it was hillary we might be in martial law already. The electoral college is necessary. Popularity leads to bullying and we are learning slowly on how treating people better will support gun control as is
@cspanwj Constitutionally, there is no argument to not secure the border or to argue about promises on election trails. Unfortunately, the United States citizens are used to judiciaries not being constitutional. How bout that case law law school crap. Thats why there isnt that much gp
@thehill More die from drugs
@SenTedCruz So for the next 2 years... He probably asked the Gov because that money
@AnnCoulter We want that number to stay down
@RepCartwright Will voter participation be based on giving illegals our citizens rights? Or improving the courts in their entirety?

@TheView abby hair looks different
@cspanwj It would be nice if our borders can be secured without impeaching senators and congress people for reckless endangerment resulting in the deaths of 🇺🇸 citizens and causing a humanitarian crisis
@cspanwj @lisquart Were those child deaths due to unidentified gentic defects?
@cspanwj @lisquart One of yous asked the handy man how he advertises
@cspanwj @lisquart Illegal
@cspanwj So, the parents are free from negligent homicide for dropping their dying kids off after thrir terminal, but homicide is the charge in hot car deaths
@cspanwj We dont have prior health documentation from the illegals to say whether or not they were near death when their parents moved them
@cspanwj How much do illegals pay this lady?
@dirkduck @cspanwj @TheJuanWilliams Russians blame blacks for election hacking
@DHSgov if a person is not fit to own a firearm, may those people also be federally banned from obtaining pilots licenses?

@cspanwj @TheJuanWilliams If Romney won Obamas 2nd term then Obama ran again, our economic atmosphere would have return to pre 911 standards

@cspanwj Dont people usually tell their kids dobt bite off more than you can chew?
@cspanwj Does she mainly deal in divorce?
@cspanwj There was a guy released from prison for charges he wouldnt specify. He asked me to look at his case against the pd for hitting him with a flash light. His demeanor and refusal to say what he was doing suggests violating another person w/o permission
@cspanwj The real problem lies with elected officials. They wont make us safe so why would they release model prisoners genuinely trying to rehabilitate?
@cspanwj Inside traders already have good jobs and licenses
@cspanwj Court conduct.
@hearditfirst @cspanwj You need a judge's order to be released. Its a fact. Its also a fact that drs are overlooked for criminal activity
@cspanwj Dont forget the numbers. Not every prisoners is guilty or innocent. Neither are every free person
@cspanwj Jubilee is drugs and prostitution
@cspanwj Prisons in to hospital put criminal drs in charge
@cspanwj Souhld Paul manafort jr get one

@ABCWorldNews Patients or potentials should be able to research doctors to assure them the doctors have the ability or training to assist them in the treatment needed.
@cspanwj @alexanderbolton @thehill So its not the Presidents fault that the border wall cant go up. But, money was the first reason not to build. If financing prevents protection wont we be in bigger trouble if congress and the senate allows the countries money to faulter?
@cspanwj @AFGENational I can not see or enter my neighbor rs apartment

@JudicialWatch when the court system fails, it should waive the right to prosecute
@Locke1776John @cspanwj @laurenonthehill @usnews What pr why?
@cspanwj @laurenonthehill @usnews You have to search the students too because those brown kids out west are brining them and shot a few kids. I think ot was in california towards the begining of the year
@cspanwj @laurenonthehill @usnews And bullying that kid to changing his name is definitely bad for discipline

@replouiegohmert For example, a dentist student has no business doing an optometrist procedure whether or not an administrative agent assigned them? He just told me im dr redacted and that it was urgent to get it done

@realannapaulina Dems
@DHSgov Is the north border being surveilled?
@RepJayapal @repmarkpocan @USProgressives Limits of the constitution?
@cspanwj The standard of quality care should be improved and spread evenly among all recipients. Other countries dont have the problems the 🇺🇸 medical system has.
@FilthyHort @nytimes Venezuela got 2 new long range nuclear capable bombers. Its pretty close.
@EyemLN @TheView Doctors fail all the time. Some cases are different from others but there recently has been new federal law passed protecting drs amd their businesses from medical malpractice claims. Usually that would come after review of performance and possibly underrepresented claimants
@SenBlumenthal Good Lord! How can the health of migrants be monitored during their journey feom South or Central America?

@EyemLN @TheView Ok. 100 percent of doctors are successful at treating ailments
@TheView Then theres also doctors who fail in mental health
@TheView Of you have a criminal record and a gun that is used to protect family or unarmed people from mass shootings
@realannapaulina According to unilad the migrants are being trafficked

@cnnbrk The affluenza defense can work here
@MeetThePress @RandPaul Without fully knowing the facts of an investigation, it seems there is a bipartisan faction trying to form a prosecutorial type ousting of our own President. The thing is nobody would care of his dealings of they hadn't lost in 2016.
@MSNBC Last time he mentioned trouble he was implementing punishing the 🇺🇸 people for voting against his preferred partisanship
@SenBlumenthal The claims still have to be accurately investigated for asylum to be established. It seems the migrants meet asylum status on the way to our Southern border. Keep in mind the parents children were uprooted from their lives in their countries of origin
@JudicialWatch Someone said George soros was soley responsible for funding the non profits funding the migrants caravans causing travel chaos and childhood trauma. I dont believe he is or was all alone in that project. Someone also mentioned unilad.
@MSNBC Why isnt he concerned about wildfires and insurance and matters stemming of fema qualifying disasters?

@WSJ @BillGalston Thats why people hire lawyers. Listen, judicial and attorney misconduct is not a place for ridiculous remarks. Every judge is suppposed to be constitutional. Every law school does not teach law. Which is why students screwed up the nlrb. Lol
@washingtonpost Cause the tariffs halted tea production
@KayaJones @Alyssa_Milano ...brought forth an entirely new type of fraud. Daca fraud fund bybnon profits who settle illegals and give attorneys who lie about numbers which is how you get 600,000 to 11,000,000 daca recipients but the original daca cast was for 50000 unaccompanied minor migrants
@KayaJones @Alyssa_Milano Remember when Obama lured 5 figures of illegal immigrants to San Francisco and deported all of them as families. Then sent them weapons in the fast and furious scandal, and when they sent their children back he when against citizens and started daca which also ...

@JxhnBinder @AnnCoulter DHS has nothing to do with immigration prosecution
@HuntsmanAbby Soup kitchens might be filled with illegals soon
@CNN Didnt Donald Trump legally give all his businesses to his children as part of his preinauguration requirement? Even if he didnt, Donald Trump and Trump enterprises are seperate entities. Furthermore, his personal tax documents will satisfy the people worried about his taxes

@SenSchumer Can GM be forced by law to make products better keep up with competition and not by robots from them?
@ABC Laying off 15% of its workforce seems like intent in not making innovative and quality products. They shouldn't be able to replace it with robots. Especially when human neglect or error is to blame for slumping sales.
@JudicialWatch So...
@JudicialWatch Thats human rights violations and trafficking.
@amy_hudak OMG!
@MSNBC @chrislhayes A ? Does make the language in the form of a question
@MSNBC These unions are supposed to have attorneys protecting their interests
@MSNBC My initial thoughts are that the models bring cancelled didnt really sell to good. Thats design issues. They want to regroup with automation meaning they will order machines from outside the United States. A real issue with the leadership is that the prius is better the the volt
@DineshDSouza She has to be an abuse victim
@LindseyGrahamSC Her mentality is consistent with other nonprofiteers
@TariffMYtaxCUT @cspanwj @NRO @reihan I am a natural born citizen. Whats your profession?
@Acosta the wierd thing is, Papadopoulos is a citizen requesting a stay of prosecution amd gets denied but illegal immigrants get better representation. Sucks!
@ABC Did he defraud the feds or win some votes. He won the electoral college and almost proved voter fraud on a state level
@ABCWorldNews Maybe she should leave him. matter of fact get her ass out
@TariffMYtaxCUT @cspanwj @NRO @reihan But you put bad english an tatoos next to an educated person and you have a problem
@MSNBC It really seems like the Obama administration knows there was collusion because they paid Russian agencies to interact with people before the former Secretary of State was campaigning
@TariffMYtaxCUT @cspanwj @NRO @reihan Probably mismanagement either in the plant or in the immigration practice
@TariffMYtaxCUT @cspanwj @NRO @reihan It was a gun manufacturing plant. Generally ran by illegals(for some reason or another) or Puerto Ricans
@seaforward @SenBlumenthal Fines wont fix it. The problem is law makers allowed free enterprise without screening
@SenBlumenthal Has anyone asked Hillary's campaign chair how that happened?
@Ocasio2018 Nobody said more intelligent. I said you might schizophrenic and psychotic. I also know how you talk when your about to lose an argument
@TariffMYtaxCUT @cspanwj @NRO @reihan Well, that depends. If the immigrants intimidated leadership and were unskilled and lazy then its my correct assessment. They tried to intimidate me but i was busy finding yearly quarters of nonconforming finished product. They xanned the wrong people. They should be open
@ABC @GStephanopoulos Whats the plan if President Trump loses the 2020 election? Go back half a decade or moce forward in support of United States citizens and legal immigrants?
@nytimes Semites should pursue action against nazi like gestures and propaganda.
@ThisWeekABC A lot of politicians still on office were upset that the President did not follow their preference of hiring policy. They should have told the United States people that most offices dont chamge ideals and they are mad at us because we voted outside their community
@cspanwj @NRO @reihan This guy is explaining fraud
@CNN @AdamSchiff Wasnt the intelligence Committee a big part in the 2016 collusion accusations?
@cspanwj @NRO @reihan Immigrants dont always work harder. I had a job with black immigrants who did not only know their jobs, but did not posses a desire to learn it. That company is closed
@cspanwj @NRO @reihan Theres also a whole bunch of illegal immigrant off spring that are allegiant to foreign powers
@cspanwj @NRO @reihan I know legal immigrants who don't like illegals because that's not fair
@cspanwj @NRO @reihan Seems like the Spanish made an ethnic attack on the United States
@cspanwj @NRO @reihan Citizenship rank should be based on generational history.

@Centristchowdah @cspanwj If doctors are screwing around while you under anesthesia and dont properly place implants its a fucking problem. And the courts that support them
@kdmd907 @JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump It looks like partisanship to me
@cspanwj @amprog @reihan I got hot by an illegal immigrant and the Puerto rican cop sucked
@cspanwj @amprog @reihan The illegals told me why their coming what they want, and what they are teaching theyre children
@MSNBC @JoeNBC So did hillary
@cspanwj @amprog @reihan Isnt a melting pot a civil war?
@SenBlumenthal So now the senate blaims the house instead dems and reps?
@NBCNews Didnt they agency say theyd be hostile?
@washingtonpost They do that when they cant think rationally. Its unprofessional
@washingtonpost I wont be speaking Spanish
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Maybe the United States should process their claims and find out why they are fleeing
@cspanwj Progressive liberal and conservative are terms that really screwed our two party system up.
@cspanwj Puerto rico being a foreign entity and the possibility of Puerto Ricans not being eligible for office outside Puerto Rico

@TIME Serina Williams
@cspanwj @Brown_e_Points Most universities support illegals who assault. Some dont. Alcohol also plays a major role, security, staff and faculty, victims who need a boost in grades(not all), seems that the younger leadership gets in these places the easier it is to keep it hush.
@JudicialWatch Prison failed to reform them
@ChuckGrassley So, can illegals be prosecuted like blacks?
@JudicialWatch Did she stop doing drugs?
@SenBlumenthal He wasn't a citizen
@Kybelle195739 @cspanwj Drug induced disability claims.
@Centristchowdah @cspanwj I dont anything about that. Medical malpractice as i know it must be changing when doctors actively cover for another doctors malpractice. Or, they commit neglect with or without intent to either please an ins co, monetary or knowledge toward unspecified science
@AP I thought hurricanes worsened because the gulf stream pretty much died after the bp disaster
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Is judicial watch supposed to be the watch dog agency for misconduct? Omg!
@CNN It would also alter it composition and probably severely damage oxygen production
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump But thats partisanship prior to 2016. Which would actually put adam schiff and maxine waters in places that might not be best for our governments
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump And the office holders and investers really plan to do us ill. If it was rigged, who the hell is against us
@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Hang on, does that imply the former Secretary of State...
@JudicialWatch Lets store more fresh water while we can
@MeghanMcCain What if he was a citizen?
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Not only are they proving they know the laws, but also choosing which ones and on who they wish to enforce them on. Thats partisanship and not professional
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump The fact that they didnt means there is case law protecting ivanka. Judicially, this is bad
@SenBlumenthal If a car is stolen with a child inside, the pare ts should be charged with neglect and implicated in the theft
@Ocasio2018 @scottheins Just a constitutionally correct question. Are puerto ricans legally eligible for office outside of that territory?
@Acosta Just because theres no proof doesn't mean it didn't happen
@KayaJones 2 years
@JudicialWatch Just because theres no proof doesn't mean it didn't happen
@MSNBC @chrislhayes What does she think about stagnant wages?
@CNN Now, adam schiff is one of the politicians who wanted to punish United States citizens for voting for the Republican parties only eligible candidate. Well, Senator Langford and Rand Paul were also heavy advocates for the latter.
@MSNBC @chrislhayes Whats chuck schumer think?
@Reuters So, free speech is a United States citizens right. Free press is also supported by that right. In other countries, there isnt a right to free speech. It can get ya the cold shoulder. It happened to me in another country.
@maggieNYT @nytimes But, the former got away with it anyway
Maybe the smoke can be studied to gauge fallout. And how on earth did house burn all the way down and still unburnt trees? #CaliforniaFires
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Statically ot happens but right now its higher because of the non profit organizations based on helping illegal immigrants get settled without becoming citizens. Third party registrars are not only inaccurate, but intimidate voters
