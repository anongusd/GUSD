Newsom says he expects a tuition freeze from UC and CSU after proposing hundreds of millions of dollars in new higher education spending: “They better, or that money’s being taken away in the May revise.”
Newsom commits to pursuing on a new fee on water and fertilizer to pay for clean drinking water in communities that do not have access. That plan has fallen short in the Legislature over the past two years.
Newsom expects to cover 138,000 more young adults by expanding Medi-Cal access to undocumented immigrants between the ages of 19-25, at a cost of $260 million.
To address homelessness crisis, Newsom wants $500 million to build more emergency shelters, and exemptions to environmental review laws to get them built faster.
Newsom says he wants to revamp regional goals for housing development and tie it to transportation funding. So cities and counties that don’t hit their goals would lose money from the gas tax increase.
“It’s a no damn brainer,” Newsom says of his proposal, previously announced, to expand paid parental leave to six months in California. Still no funding figures in his budget plan.
Newsom budget increases K-12 funding by nearly $3 billion, which he says will provide an all-time high for per-pupil spending, and proposes another $942 million in ongoing funding for the state’s three higher education systems.
Newsom proposes nearly $5 billion to increase the rainy day fund, over the next four years, to about $20 billion. Another $9 billion would pay down budget debts and pension liabilities.

In his closing comments, @TheRealJohnHCox brings up @GavinNewsom's support of high-speed rail, which he calls a waste of money. Unfortunately, we don't get any more time on this major project, which is over budget and behind schedule with no clear funding plan to finish it.

"There's no Iowa dream, no New Hampshire dream, no Nevada dream," @GavinNewsom says to kick off California gubernatorial debate. His top issue is addressing the wealth disparity that is putting the "California dream" out of reach to many.

“Today California sends an unmistakable message to the nation and the world,” @kdeleon, who authored SB 100, says. “Regardless of who occupies the White House, California will always lead on climate change.”
Ahead of his climate summit this week, @JerryBrownGov has signed SB 100, setting goal for 100 percent of California electricity from renewable sources by 2045. He has also signed an executive order for the state to achieve carbon neutrality, also by 2045.

Two Assembly Democrats looking shaky in primary results: Sabrina Cervantes (as expected, after underdog 2016 victory) and...Rudy Salas (not so much!). Both trail Republican challengers in races that will replay in November.

Rough showing for Devon Mathis, who was criticized for vote to extend cap-and-trade and slammed by sexual harassment allegations last fall, in 26th Assembly District. He leads a Republican rival by only 500 votes at the moment, with a Democrat in between them.

AP has called statewide ballot measures. Four pass, including Prop 68 (parks and water bond) and Prop 69 (requires that gas tax revenue used for transportation projects). Only Prop 70 (requiring supermajority vote in Legislature to spend cap-and-trade money) fails.
Republican Steven Bailey advances to face Attorney General Xavier Becerra in November. Dave Jones ran far behind in his bid to unseat fellow Democrat Becerra, whom he criticized for politicizing the office.
With 70 percent of precincts reporting, Democrats Eleni Kounalakis and Ed Hernandez are holding onto top two in lieutenant governor race. Could be a very expensive race this fall for an office that does...well, not much.
Kevin de León, who was languishing in third earlier, looking good for the top two in the U.S. Senate race. He's pulling away from Republican James Bradley with each update, now up by about two percentage points.

Hold up. Antonio Sabato, Jr. is running for Congress? Why did I not know about this?
For all the liberal activist energy in the 4th Congressional District this year, it's not looking any more competitive than usual. Tom McClintock has 51% of the vote, with about a fifth of precincts reporting. Jessica Morse is leading among Democratic challengers.
As only nonpartisan statewide office in California, superintendent of public instruction race could be decided tonight if a candidate gets a majority. But it seems unlikely at this point, with leading candidates Marshall Tuck and Tony Thurmond both under 40% of the vote early on.
In insurance commissioner race, early returns have Steve Poizner, former Republican who is running with no party preference, in the lead (45%), with Democrat Ricardo Lara in second (37%). Both are far ahead of the competition.
Still less than 5% of precincts reporting, but Ed Hernandez is hanging in with fellow Democrat Eleni Kounalakis in the lieutenant governor race (19.2% vs. 21.1%), despite millions spent by Kounalakis and her father. Republican Cole Harris in first with 21.6%.

California Republican Party endorses @ColeHarrisCA for lieutenant governor. @LydiaOrtega4CA is also running, but she was not eligible for the endorsement and had asked delegates not to endorse. #CAGOP2018
California Republican Party endorses @MarkMeuser for Secretary of State. #CAGOP2018
Four years after Ron Calderon and Leland Yee were suspended from the California Senate, they are the stars of a #CAGOP2018 video on Democratic corruption. I guess this issue is never going away.
Before endorsement vote, #CAGOP2018 general session plays a video featuring women and minorities in the party. Republicans in California have been trying to figure out how to expand their appeal to a rapidly diversifying state.
“Liberals want America to be like the rest of the world,” @SenJoniErnst says at #CAGOP2018. “It’s the rest of the world that’s asking, ‘What’s it like to be free?’ and ‘What’s it like to be American?’”
“Poor President Trump,” @SenJoniErnst says. She says nothing he does will ever be good enough for the liberal elite or the media. #CAGOP2018
This @SenJoniErnst keynote address at the #CAGOP2018 convention kicks off like a stand-up comedian’s set, mercilessly roasting the “People’s Republic of California.” When she got the invite, she said, she wondered whether she was even allowed to step foot in the state.
“Big government is not the solution to our problems. Big government is the problem,” @TheRealJohnHCox says at #CAGOP2018 candidate forum. Presumably that does not include his unsuccessful Neighborhood Legislature initiative. https://t.co/eWnI5S5Fuh

Lots of cheers and high-fives for @JoinTravisAllen as he promises #CAGOP2018 session that, as governor, he will undo “sanctuary state” law. Much more than gas tax repeal, that seems to be the issue getting delegates excited this weekend.
“Jerry Brown and his mafia don’t play fair,” @carldemaio says. He suggests county registrars might try to block the gas tax repeal from the ballot by undercounting signatures, but “with almost a million signatures, good luck, Brownie!”
At #CAGOP2018 session, @carldemaio makes the case that repealing the gas tax is the best issue for California Republicans to run on in 2018. His campaign just turned in nearly a million signatures to qualify an initiative for November.
In a packed “sanctuary state” session at #CAGOP2018, law professor John Eastman compares California’s dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration to the secession that led to the Civil War. He says the state is using “lawfare” to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

The Republican Congress is taking on the “mainstream media” and “Obama loyalists” in the federal government, @RepMimiWalters says, before pleading with GOP activists to get fired up about the 2018 election. #CAGOP2018
.@RepMimiWalters says she’s been a leader in fighting sexual harassment and sex trafficking since her days in the California Legislature. Points to Survivors’ Bill of Rights that she successfully carried in 2016.
“Donald Trump was not my first choice” for president, says @RepMimiWalters, who campaigned for Bush and Rubio. But she touts the regulatory rollback, increased military spending and tougher immigration enforcement under @realDonaldTrump. #CAGOP2018
Keynote speaker at the #CAGOP2018 Friday dinner is @RepMimiWalters, one of national Democrats’ top House targets this year. She’s fighting to hang on in increasingly purple Orange County.
Will @realDonaldTrump come to California to campaign for the seven targeted House Republicans? “I’m not on his speed dial,” California GOP Chair @JimBrulte says.
California GOP Chairman @JimBrulte tells reporters he’s not concerned that the party will be shut out of the gubernatorial runoff. “Republican voters will vote for a Republican candidate,” he says, and push either Travis Allen or John Cox to the top two.
