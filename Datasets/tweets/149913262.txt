@ARTofCOOP Huzzah! I and @EvilMopacATX welcome you. Check your texts
odd/rare because of the badging: in 1955 Porsche was persuaded to "Americanize" the 356 for the US market, including doll up trim and dropping "356" for the more Yankee "Continental." They were sued by Ford for trademark infringement, and soon dropped it. Oops! https://t.co/paE8zgrj13

@titudeadjust Carl Stallings was a wonderful arranger, though a lot of the music written for Loony Toons (with the exception of the opera bits) was written by Raymond Scott who went largely uncredited.
Long before "Cars," Avery made "One Cab's Family" (1952) about the rebellious son of a taxi cab who aspired to be a hot rod, complete with twin carb flathead and raccoon tail on his antenna https://t.co/o8ENtEM6Ra
@garysteveneaton we all should aspire to be Droopy
A lot of people are mentioning Chuck Jones, who was of course great, but sort of overly cerebral and mannered. Avery by contrast was not shy about bending every law of physics in support of the cheapest and most hilarious visual gag possible.

@irishace11 @KNayyeh Austin more than holds its own in food, but largely because of BBQ, Mexican, Sushi, street food. There is no Austin equivalent of Alinea, though.
@KNayyeh Yeah, I'd probably add LA to that as well.
@KNayyeh by "food cities" I don't mean specialty regional cuisines, I mean the whole gamut of chow- from world class $$$$ eateries, to street food, to every ethnic cuisine under the sun. By that standard, there's NY, Chicago, and everybody else.
@KNayyeh Gonna stop you right there. Despite its litany of problems Chicago is still near the apex of food cities, and vastly superior to Dallas or Atlanta

and if you're concerned about losing a scheduled 3-day weekend, let's replace Presidents Day with Constitution Day
In fact we should abolish a Presidents' Day holiday altogether &amp; go back to individual Washington / Lincoln birthdays, where they once again become a school lesson topic rather than a school day off
I move that we officially change the name to George &amp; Abe Day. If the rest of those assholes wanted their own holiday, they should have tried harder.
Yes, I know it is a mashup of Washington &amp; Lincoln's bdays for a federal holiday, but somehow has morphed into a generic "celebration of our leaders." As an American, may I say F that S	https://t.co/xWtFa6M7kA

@kyjeeper65 @_TamaraWinter I stand corrected
@_TamaraWinter many of Iowa's notable early black alumni were from the South, where they lacked higher ed opportunities. Lawrence Jones, founder of the Piney Woods school in MS, was UI Class of 1908. Sculptor Elizabeth Catlett was the first black MFA, Iowa Class of 1940.
@_TamaraWinter btw Carver earn both his BS and MS in Botany from ISU and was ISU's first black faculty member before returning to Mississippi to start Tuskegee. Carver Hall on the ISU campus is named in his honor.
@_TamaraWinter Both UI and ISU were on the forefront of admitting minority students. UI was the first state U in America to admit students without regard to race (in 1856). First black UI law graduate was in 1878.

Period correct, steel body '32 Ford roadster hot rod with flathead V8, $55k; screaming yellow plastic '34 kit car, $60k. Go home Barrett Jackson bidders, you're drunk https://t.co/U3hTZlnWTt
@wrongbucko in fact it is hot rodded. Big inch Stovebolt, Fenton intake with twin Rochesters, twice pipes, just as they did it in the mid '50s. Also has Mustang II IFS, which is more a modern hot rod trick.

Another prewar Ford bargain: 1938 Deluxe Convertible Sedan with mild period correct hop-up equipment. $23k to the seller. I'm kicking my own ass through the tears for not jumping on that.	https://t.co/eYdXrsbV3w
I have a deep appreciation for prewar US cars, especially FoMoCo; they are the working man's Delage/Delahaye. Sadly a lot of the collectors of these cars are over 80 and dying off, but I've seen a renewed interest in them among younger car guys. There are bargains to be had.
Another case was this 1939 Ford custom Deluxe. $24,750, the seller only walked away with $22,500. Ayiyi.	https://t.co/I55KaHtCSW
@DamnedGentlemen There's a mix of sociological factors at work there, from guys chasing the cars they wanted in HS in the 60s/70s, to dick-swinging over who can pay the most. For whatever reason I just love the aesthetic of cars that were before my time (insert age joke here).
@touchdownHtown It's fucking crazy. The muscle car market is in for a slow demographic collapse.
Most of the cognitive dissonance is about hi prices, but I have occasional WTF moments about low prices. Exhibit 1 is this '40 V12 Zephyr coupe with vintage Edmunds speed equipment. $58.3k = Grand Theft Auto. https://t.co/SS8hlV0rzZ https://t.co/sOlMVF0wIi

It's weird to watch three liquored-up lummoxes bid a Sizzle Green 1968 Bulgemobile Maniac X99 P-Code up to $175k where there are two dozen Sizzle Green 1968 Bulgemobile Maniac X99 P-Codes on Hemmings for sale at $60k

@giantsfan459 niece didn't play football, but she's currently on a D-1 athletic scholarship.
There are now jocks-only private high schools (like IMG academy in FL) that are basically prep schools for college FB. My niece attended one (American Heritage Delray Beach). 250 students, pretty much every FB player gets a D1 scholarship.
@MichaelCarozza1 Meester &amp; Wiegmann were OL, Devries &amp; Kampman DL. Wiegmann (a 16 year starter for Chiefs), and Kampman (59 career sacks) were all pro. They were all simultaneously in NFL in  in the â00s
Per capita though, no HS ever put out more NFL talent than Aplington-Parkersburg Iowa. Tiny 200-student rural HS, had 4 grads in the NFL at the same time; 2 of them all-Pros, all of them 10+ season starters (Jared Devries, Aaron Kampman, Brad Meester, Casey Wiegmann)
Apparently Austin has replaced Western PA as cradle of QBs. Fellow Westlake HS grad &amp; Longhorn QB Sam Ehlinger could end up in NFL, and Baker Mayfield played at Westlake rival Lake Travis. 	https://t.co/LTsF0dkK2o

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say a lot of those guys on Miami's roster weren't recruited because they were 4/5*, they were 4/5* because they were recruited by Miami.
@Mizbol1 yep. Iowa has 26 alums on NFL rosters, 6 current or former Pro Bowlers, none of whom to my recollection were &gt;3*. Marshal Yanda is a lock for NFL HOF, and was a 0*.
Not saying talent isn't important. It's that judges of it are, in many cases, crap. It was amazing watching that Wisconsin-Miami game listening to announcers rave about Miami's "talent" while the Badgers were stomping them a new mudhole.
an example of how this often works: Iowa recently signed a kid named Jestin Jacobs, the proverbial 3-star Hawkeye recruit. He received a couple of late offers from Ohio State and Michigan, and *voila!* he's suddenly a 4/5 star.
who exactly are these people who distribute "stars," and how do they hook up their highly sensitive Talent-o-Meters on unsuspecting high schoolers?

Attention investment bankers: My friend Brian has a '55 Chevy for sale for $3 trillion. Lend me $3 trillion to buy it &amp; when I skip payment, tell DC the economy is in meltdown until they give us $3 trillion. That way you, me &amp; Brian will all have $1 trillion, plus a '55 Chevy
Just wait until the housing bubble pops again. Instead of welcoming a return to affordable housing and a chance to renegotiate overpriced mortgages, we'll have a 100% DC consensus to "help homeowners" by giving them $ to make their payments to lenders.
Luckily, we have a wide bipartisan consensus that the solution to every crisis caused by cheap money is MOAR CHEAP MONEY
Spoiler alert: markets don't give a shit what party is in power, as long as they get to gorge on a free all-you-can-eat buffet of cheap money until they puke in the alley, and begin demanding more cheap money all over again

Is there anything more creepily totalitarian than an "urban planner"? I swear to god they all seem to spring boners at the notion of cramming people into trains and Soviet-style block apartments
Bottom line is a downtown location = 20 minute commute from a tiny expensive apartment, suburban location = 20 minute commute from an affordable 2500 sq ft house with a pool and 3 car garage.

Probably the worst unintended consequence of car safety design is the apparent sense of DGAF invulnerability among drivers. GET OFF YOUR DAMN CELL PHONES, you morons
*50 years
A 1967 Camaro, with a small block V-8, was 2920 pounds. That's weight gain of &gt;40% in 40 years.
@KevCoons Most people look at '50s cars and assume they have the weight of an ocean liner, but truth is most are lighter than a new Honda Accord
Another thing is that airbags and other equipment have hugely increased the weight / impact mass of cars. E.g. a 1959 Chevy Impala weighs 3600 pounds, a 2018 Chevy Camaro weighs up to 4100 pounds.
Problem is that secondary safety engineering often makes crashes more likely. E.g., safety worries have led to a precipitous reduction in window glass, and as a result, driver visibility.
I suppose airbags, crumple zones, etc are smart, but they're all about "secondary safety," aimed at helping people survive crashes. I'd rather see more focus on *primary* safety to make crashes less likely in the first place - better driver ed would be nice
@Sol29471578 Oh hell no. I'm talking about putting EFI, disc brakes, surround sound stereo, better suspension etc. on a '61 Continental. You can do all that without adding airbags and that kinda crap

If a kid wants to spend recess playing tag or flag football, fine. If they want to make up a random game of floobadoop, fine. If they want to splash in puddles or stare at a bug, also fine. Kids need their own "me time" too.
I guess this is where everybody wants to talk about how they played Deathball 2000 and whatnot when they were kids, but that's not the point - it's the damned authoritarian regimentation of every single moment of childhood.

The second American to hold the world land speed record was Henry Ford. 91.37 mph on a frozen lake in Michigan. The record lasted 2 months in early 1904.

Anyhoo, at this point I severely doubt a delay in the carbon tax will manage to close the lid on this Pandora's box. It's more an object lesson on the dangers of governing by a bubble-dwelling enlightened Ruling Class.		*Fin*
I'm pretty sure few if any of those smoking hulks of BMWs and Benzes in Paris were torched by 60 year old rural pensioners pissed about gas prices and speeding fines; not an expert on French politique, but it now looks as a broad L-R coalition of people pissed about *everything*
Anyhoo, I'm not sure the protests have much to do with angry car-driving French bubbas any more; maybe initially, but they became a vehicle (pun intended) for generalized public discontent on any number of issues- reduced benefits, immigration etc
*op cit. "Convoy" by CW McCall, which was based on that protest.
In retrospect it isn't surprising that the fuel tax prompted protests; especially in France where there's a long tradition of protests, strikes, and shutdowns. I'm old enough to remember a nationwide US protest by truckers in response to a 55 mph speed limit.
I actually know some hot rodders in France, like mes ami Etienne Butterlin who publishes the French hot rod magazine PowerGlide, Takes a big pair to drive around in a hot rod when any grandma in a Citroen is considered a state enemy. https://t.co/SPPDNnMkLU
Get busted for doing 90 km/h in a 70 zone? Pay a big fine, pay big money for a traffic school (crony partners w/ govt, natch), or lose your license for a year. No prob if you live in Paris &amp; ride the Metro, big prob if you're Bubba Francois out in the sticks.
Over the past few years, France has saturated the country with red light cameras, speed cameras, etc., while lowering speed limits nationwide. Supposedly for "public safety," but as everywhere else, mainly used as a govt revenue engine through fines.
The yellow vests themselves are symbolic: every motorcyclist in France is required by law to wear them, and every car owner is required to carry them in their cars.
The proposed carbon fuel tax in France is relatively minor ($0.30 per gallon on a current fuel price of $7 per gallon) but it was the proverbial last straw in a string of indignities targeted at French motorists.

The lead role Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) is a go-getting young guy from Arkansas seeking his big break in Hollywood, a story line that parallels Reagan's. Reagan had just taken his screen test in June 1937, a few months before the movie began filming.
It also features one of the first movie appearances of Ronald Reagan, fresh from WHO radio in Des Moines where he was the voice of the Iowa Hawkeyes. He has uncredited bit part as, oddly enough, a radio announcer. https://t.co/NiB39WrN17

@papabryant I'm not fond of there being a single class system (FBS) that is defacto a 2 class system. If a team like UCF can go 2 years undefeated and never have a shot at a championship, create a Super FBS class of P5 teams who cannot play outside it.
@papabryant I'm just talking about the perspective of the marble game rules; the tea leaf reading wizards of ESPN and polls have their own perceptual psychology problems
@papabryant If the marble game was run with a 200 P5 -120 non P5 start, I'd guess UCF would easily be in top 8, but maybe not enough to be in top 4
@papabryant Another way to set up starting marble count is 200-120; this would say a non-P5 win over P5 on neutral field in Week 1 would make them equal (post game 160-160) and would consider them superior for road win (post game 150-170).
@papabryant The 200-100 starting advantage for P5 is a bit arbitrary, but based on this idea: P5 gets benefit of the doubt, but if a non P5 team beats a P5 team at home in week 1, they are now considered equal. Before the game it would be 200-100, after it would be 150-150.
@papabryant I'm conjecturing, but if Marble Game started with every FBS team at equal marbles, UCF would almost certainly be top 4. The rankings shown are based on P5 teams starting with 200, other FBS teams with 100.
@CaseyMattox_ I liken it to Nascar points chase rules. You can quibble about how many points 1st place, top 5, etc should be worth, but they're clear, simple stated in advance and verifiable.
@CaseyMattox_ Key point: I stated the rules before a single game was played, unlike everybody running around right now making up rules after the season and whining about who gets how many Mulligans
@AppFlyer @woodstockdave App State picked up 18 marbles from UL Lafayette, so they'd now be at 220 marbles, probably around #28 or #29
@SanGringoCorp I suspect OU will get the 4th slot, and *subjectively* I'd probably rank as  1 Alabama 2 Clemson 3 Notre Dame 4 OU 5 Georgia 6 Ohio State 7 UCF
@coshoct @BuddyMacGyver Thank you. If conference title game isn't a playoff game, what's the point?
If there were a 8 team playoff I'd say that's a solid seeding.
@BuddyMacGyver Had Georgia beaten Alabama, it would have been 1 Clemson (714) 2 Georgia (704) 3 ND (690) 4 Ohio St (672)
#HowIThinkIWillDie hilariously
@RLSandack this why I proposed the marble game in the first place, to end the subjective yapping and lobbying. Read the rules: they are clear, simple, and have no bias other than favoring P5 teams over non P5.

@its_GTdawg Why I'm always leery of old chromed front axles, especially tube axles. Chrome was cheap back then so they laid it on pretty thick, but not always carefully, so H.E. can be an issue
@its_GTdawg have a friend who had a '32 Ford 3 window coupe, built around 1968, with a full chrome 1965 Corvette IRS. Spring perch snapped on the Tri State tollway in Chicago at 65 mph, sent him into barrier. He walked away, but scary moment.
@JYuter go to your time out corner for 5 minutes, Rebbe
@MomcorpsFRC The solution, in one word: Mexico.
@its_GTdawg I know a couple of guys with chrome-slathered vintage early 60s show cars who've experience hydrogen embrittlement failures. One was a car with a completely chromed frame that snapped.
Example: show quality triple chrome plating (copper, nickle, chrome) for a late 40s/early 50s Buick grille &amp; front bumper would probably set you back &gt; $10k
What this country needs is high quality chrome plating that doesn't cost the GDP of a Baltic state

Example: in the unlikely event that Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, and Oklahoma ALL lose, the Top 4 marble standings would be		1 Georgia 704	2 Notre Dame 690	3 Clemson 531	4 Alabama 519
@coshoct under the rules of the marble game, Notre Dame is a mathematical lock for the Top 4, but has no way to be a #1 seed. The winner of Alabama -Georgia will have more marbles after that game.
@atkriss No, there are scenarios where either Alabama or Clemson can still make the Top 4 with a loss, but would need other teams to lose. For example, if Georgia beats Alabama, Clemson wins, and Ohio State and OU both lose, Top 4 is		1 Clemson 714	2 Georgia 704	3 ND 690	4 Alabama 519
@mikeslewis @Madisox43 This has all FBS teams ranked #1 to #130 on marble count, along with the description of how it works:		https://t.co/aEzwQapiyr
If Georgia pulls the upset on Alabama, Alabama would still be in top 4 but would need 2 losses from the set (Clemson, OU, OSU). Similar for Clemson, who can still make top 4 with a loss. Oklahoma can make top 4, but would need both Clemson and Ohio State to lose.
So if next weekend's games go as expected, the top 4 teams will be 		1. Alabama 759	2. Clemson 714	3. Notre Dame 690	4. Ohio St 672		No muss, no fuss, no smoke-filled back rooms needed.
Notre Dame finishes reg season with 690 marbles. Marble counts of other top teams depending on conference championship game W/L		Clemson 714/531	Alabama 759/519	Ohio St 672/493	Georgia 704/460	Oklahoma 591/416

"Why did they watch it? Beats me. I guess they were all hopped up on Kool-Aid and Sugar Smacks, and believe it or not Popeye provided more visual stimulation than some other cartoons. Don't get me started on Clutch Cargo."
"Basically, they were right. The TV stations dressed up the weather man as a clown or spaceman or cowboy to give an intro, and the kids'd just sit and watch Popeye like zombies. Later, when grandma &amp; grandpa were teenagers, they heard rumors that the clown was a pederast."
"Anyway, Columbia had a vault of old Popeye cartoons from the Depression that they syndicated a lot cheaper than the far superior Warner Brothers or MGM cartoons, so a lot of drunk local programming execs said, whatever, like any of these stupid kids will notice."
"Well, see, um, back when grandma and grandpa were kids, there were only 3 TV channels and no afternoon network programming, so local stations needed cheap cartoon filler content for the after school market segment."

@RobProvince the Fireballs?
In 1952-3 Studebaker sponsored an ill fated Indy program, using Stude V8 and DOHC heads made by Leo Goosen. Only a handful of the heads were ever made. When he was a teenager, my pal @BanksPower bought a spare pair from Goosen and made them into a hot rod motor. https://t.co/Azx0yjlsnL
A couple of underappreciated OHV V8s, the Studebaker and the Packard. Stude V8 came out in 1951 and owed a lot to Cadillac/Olds design. Packard was a laggard and didn't have it until 1955, too late to save the company; it was also used in AMC/Hudson/Nash cars. https://t.co/oAL4yb4ntL
Buick later made a small all-aluminum 215 ci "Baby Nailhead," and Olds made a similar version. Incredibly light, and used in Indy cars. Also known as Rover V8s because they ended up in British Rovers &amp; Land Rovers https://t.co/FDkGxYjuzk
Buick intro'd their first "Fireball" OHV 8 cylinder in 1931, but it was inline. It remained their main engine until the 1953 introduction of the famous "Nailhead" V8, so called due to its small valve diameters. It was available till 1966. https://t.co/Bm2vpkBLyq
Loved for their durability, availability of parts and speed equipment; hated for their ubiquity. Hot rodders refer to them as "Bellybutton" motors, because everybody has them.
Where was I? Oh yeah, cars. The most durable of all 1950s engine designs was of course the Chevy Small Block V8, introduced in 1955 and available until 2003. They remain the object of love/hatred in the hot rod world. https://t.co/vHM16BgLOW

correction, 1948
The first production US overhead cam engine was the tiny 1944 Crossley Cobra (COpper BRAzed). 44 cubic inches, 26 hp, powered the 'Hot Shot' clown-sports car. Crossleys were made in Cincinnati by a radio company. https://t.co/7V0RoHA7g1
During the same time Euro car makers were introducing overhead cam designs, most notably Jaguar, on smaller engines. The only American OHCs then were the 1967 Pontiac Tempest straight 6 and the mind-blowing Ford 427 SOHC https://t.co/im0pL6g3Cm
@Quietmodealt Chrysler has a trademark on "Hemi" but the design isn't patented. The main reason other manufacturers didn't use the design is cost/bulkiness. The design require huge castings and it takes up a lot of engine compartment space.
"Hemi" refers to the hemispherical or dome shape of the combustion chambers. Chrysler liberally swiped the design from Zora Arkus-Duntov's "Ardun" aftermarket OHV  heads for the Ford flathead V8. He later became the Godfather of GM's racing program https://t.co/clZP17l5p0
Ford was notoriously reluctant to stray from tried &amp; true tech. Believe it or not that 1948 car had the largely the same flathead V8-torque tube-I beam front axle-wisbone &amp; buggy spring suspension as their 1932, and is even similar to the Model T's.
Chrysler Corp had a dizzying array of Hemi motors in the 50's. There was a Chrysler, a DeSoto, a Dodge, and a Plymouth polyhead "semi hemi." Few of the parts exchange between them, and all are completely different from the 1960s Mopar 426 Hemi https://t.co/s0Rko0tdhO
The '49 Ford was all new on the outside and in suspension, but still had the same basic flathead V8 design that was introduced in 1932. 1949 was also the debut of the Cadillac and Olds Rocket modern OHV V8, &amp; all US car makers had their own by '55 (Ford in 1954) https://t.co/YlgEK9Um9W
The car design that declared WW2 was over and that 1950's had begun was the 1949-51 "Shoebox" Ford. Compare the 1948 with the integrated fenders of 1949. https://t.co/FPXzhJAZUM
While Ford &amp; GM were toning things down, Chrysler actually kept getting wackier for a few more years. Here's a 1962 Imperial with its crazy floating headlights &amp; taillights. They toned down after Chrysler replaced Virgil Exner with Elwood Engel. https://t.co/Wbs3T11Iu5
The car that really declared the 1950s were over was the Lincoln Continental. Compare the 1960 model with the 1961, designed by Elwood Engel https://t.co/pjZhMtOGYs
After '59 Harley Earl was pushed out at GM, beginning the era of Bill Mitchell's cool restraint. His signature designs: 63 split window Stingray, 65 Buick Riviera, '67 Cadillac Eldo, '67 Camaro https://t.co/mrYLVDHKtt
1959 was the glorious apotheosis of over-the-top Harley Earl / Virgil Exner googie car design, and it's been downhill ever since. Some of my favorites from that year: Cadillac Eldo,  Chrysler Crown Imperial, Packard-Studebaker Hawk, Chevy Impala https://t.co/YtcD2ZOKP5

Rebates, coupons, BOGOs, limited time 0% financing etc are different words for the same thing, price discrimination. In the context of NY HQ2 just diff words for a contingent tax deal. Don't confuse a price decrease with a cost increase.		https://t.co/PTBqq9k1vP
If NYC's HQ2 deal will raise taxes and make life worse for current NYC residents than rejecting HQ2 altogether, then by all means grab the torches and pitchforks and run Bezos and de Blasio out of town, I don't give a shit	https://t.co/4ezSPR9eXM
NY AMZN tax revenue:	A: if AMZN paid full list price on taxes = $1 zillion	B:  under the tax deal needed to lure AMZN = $0.5 zillion	C: if AMZN picked Podunk TX = $0.		A is a total fantasy. Whether B is "stealing" depends whether NY incurs &gt;$0.5 zillion in additional costs.
@USWeatherExpert Locating in NY versus any other city is optional.
@JammieWF @bwohlgemuth @MattWelch I've found that when you factor in luggage &amp; rental car, LBC to DTLA is 30 minutes faster than LAX-DTLA
I'd prefer cities not dangle tax abatement deals to businesses, but when someone uses a $5 coupon at Olive Garden, it's not "stealing" from the other customers.	https://t.co/MgFwfWGG5H
I mean, AMZN hasn't even turned a shovel of dirt, and already they're being besieged by elected and unelected zombies demanding they fix NY's subways and build affordable housing

Humboldt County, Nevada has 8 towns or designated census places.		=INT(RAND()*8)+1		returns 5. 5th town in Humboldt County is Orovada. Congratulations, Orovada, Nevada, new Iowahawk HQ2*. 		*Unless I receive $500 in unmarked bills by 6 pm Friday
Nevada has 16 counties. Typing in the Excel formula		=INT(RAND()*16)+1		returns 8. The 8th county in Nevada is Humboldt.
First, there are 50 states. Typing in the Excel formula 		=INT(RAND()*50)+1		returns 28. State 28 = Nevada.
I have heard and evaluated your pitches, and now will pick my HQ2 site by the only logical process: randomly.

@badgerbanker @NateEMiller there are no style or beauty points; only wins and losses and where. Beat a team at home, take 20% of their marbles, beat them on the road, take 25% of their marbles.
Based on a quick check, the new marble standings should be	ND 585	Bama 556	Clemson 509	Georgia 470	Michigan 466	Ohio St 415	Wazzu 414	WVU 396	Oklahoma 391	Iowa State (!) 316	I trust @NateEMiller will have complete new standings later today

@evansilva Iowa NFL TEs in Ferentz era: Dallas Clark, Tony Moeaki, Scott Chandler, Brandon Meyers, CJ Fiedorowicz, George Kittle. His cousin Krieger-Coble is on Rams practice squad. Fant and Hockenson are both top 2 round draft potential.
@evansilva 2013 he was freshman backup to Fiedorowicz; 2014 to Jake Duzey; 2015 shared TE duties with his cousin Henry Krieger-Coble; 2016, shared TE with freshman Noah Fant.		Kittle may be top 4 NFL TE, but if he were still at Iowa he might only be #3 TE (behind Fant &amp; TJ Hockenson)

@wiz421 There's an explosion of school population in the suburbs. Leander ISD has 6 large high schools, 5 of them opened since 1998. Meanwhile Austin's population has doubled since 1990, but school population has only grown marginally.
@willcollier it's becoming a lot like Chicago in the sense that hipsters have a kid in the city, and then flee for the suburbs as soon as the kid reaches school age.
@wiz421 Maybe, or maybe they'll just move to Round Rock or Cedar Park. Those 2 school districts alone have more enrolled students than Austin.

@usualsuspectpnc Hruska is a fairly common Czech name, donât know if theyâre related
@ThisIsCanfield IIRC, I think he owned the original âEleanorâ Mustang from Gone In 60 Seconds
@ThisIsCanfield Ted has been a major benefactor to Sioux City. Orpheum theater, 4th Street, etc. Big car collector too.
odd true story: when I was a kid my dad's livestock broker was Norm Waitt at Waitt &amp; Hruska in Sioux City. His sons Norm and Ted later founded Gateway Computers of Holstein-box fame
In my youth, when such things still existed, Sioux City was renowned and redolent as the World's Largest Stockyards

Instead of continuing to anger the benighted, ignorant, superstitious villagers with my enlightened candy rationality, I should buy 300 pounds of Reese's Cup and swap the idiots straight up for their Snickers
You say "Reese's Cups," but all I hear is "17th Century Dutch Tulip Bulb Mania."	#PopularDelusionsAndTheMadnessOfCrowds
Maybe it's time for all you Reese's cultists to reflect on how easily you were programmed by Steven Spielberg product placement
Kit-Kat: Will Perdue	Reeses Cups: Luc Longley	Snickers: Michael Jordan
And don't even get me started on Kit-Kat. Chocolate covered wafers? WAFERS?

This is why I always taught my kids to use "Treat...... OR ELSE"
Let's face it, the linguistically bass-ackwards "Trick Or Treat" teaches our children all the wrong lessons, extortion-wise, plus it's far too specific about consequences. I mean, HELLO, way to leave a paper trail there, kids
For God's sake imagine a mugger telling you "your life or your money." Would we give him money? No, we would just laugh and pat him on the head and walk out of the alley chuckling to ourselves
Why isn't it "Treat Or Trick," and why do all you brainwashed candy-dispensing automatons continue to accept the opposite as perfectly normal?

@RoccamSoccam depends what you mean by creampuffs; beating a non-FBS team is worth precisely 0 marbles. It's probably better to beat a bad FBS opponent early than late. OTOH, scheduling early season creampuffs is pretty much what all teams try to do.
