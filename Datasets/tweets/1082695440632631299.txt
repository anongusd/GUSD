--No,you move."
When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree besides the river of truth, and tell the whole world--
This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences.
"Doesn't matter what the press says. Doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right.
If you alone of all the nation shall decide one way, and that way be the right way according to your convictions of the right, you have your duty by yourself and by your country. Hold up your head. You have nothing to be ashamed of'."
To decide it against your convictions is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let men label you as they may.
Each must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, and which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man.
It is a solemn and weighty responsibility, and not lightly to be flung aside at the bullying of pulpit, press, government, or the empty catchphrases of politicians.
In a monarchy, the king and his family are the country: In a republic it is the common voice of the people each of you, for himself, by himself and on his own responsibility, must speak
Who, then is the country? Is it the newspaper? Is it the pulpit? Why, these are mere parts of the country, not the whole of it, they have not command, they have only their little share in the command.
it cannot be its prerogative to determine what is right and what is wrong, and decide who is a patriot and who isn't. It's function is to obey orders, not originate them.
He wrote --'In a republic, who is the country? 	Is it the government which is for the moment in the saddle? Why, the government is merely a temporary servant:

@AOC is the best person to happen to comedy in years. (And don‚Äôt tell me @realDonaldTrump is better, every comedian and their mother has done jokes and sketches etc. it‚Äôs a tired trope now)
@joncoopertweets @funder Tweets like this are the reason why people are misinformed.
@ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @nytimes  @TIME @MSNBC
Can I get one serious example of why morality comes in to play in regards to the wall? Or why people think $5.7 Billion dollars is a big deal? Or how someone can say it wouldn‚Äôt work? Please someone smart explain.
RT @LizzieRovsek: I‚Äôd like to see a debate between @RealCandaceO and @AOC
Buh-Bye https://t.co/S0q1pu9V3v
@DrLeanaWen Why is your organization allowed to support political candidates? Isn‚Äôt that a conflict of interest with you Government subsidies?
RT @MattWalshBlog: Planned Parenthood for the last 50 years: "Abortion is only 3 percent of what we do!"		The new head of Planned Parenthoo‚Ä¶
@MichaelAvenatti Listen no crimes are created equal, and you‚Äôre innocent until proven guilty, but don‚Äôt you have some legal issues going on right now?
What I mean is I have been so engrossed since before the midterms and it is concerning that people still yell absurd things and stifling any other voice. This is something that isn‚Äôt and should be talked about.
I don‚Äôt want to be so negative but it‚Äôs Jan. The Knicks are well the Knicks, the Rangers keep it interesting to me because I love hockey and the @Yankees still haven‚Äôt signed both Manny and Bryce! Cut the checks guys!
I am very concerned that a overwhelming majority of Americans don‚Äôt know the difference between $1 Billion dollars and $1 Trillion dollars. For one night, one night! Could we get news about the National Debt. Please people we need to focus on finances.
Is it January 17th yet? #LouderWithCrowder #MugClub

RT @EricRWeinstein: Just wanted to say thank you to all my followers who stick with this account. I now feel I can ask any question to you‚Ä¶
Be the ball Danny. Be the ball.
I just love a Leftist (Note that is Leftists not Liberals, Liberals actually believe in free speech as an example) that will vote for #FreeEverything and complain about spending 5 Billion on a Wall.
If a person says ‚Äòwe should spend 5 Billion else where‚Äô remember this is a slight of hand trick. If someone can‚Äôt fathom spending 0.00125 of last years Government expenditures on helping to stem ILLEGAL Immigration then they are frankly just dumb.
@AOC You‚Äôre my favorite follow on Twitter. Can you and I have a debate on your policies? I am an average joe 30 year old white male (which I know makes me the scourge of the earth) and I would just love to talk to you and see if you can back up just one of your ideas with facts.
@CynthiaGubish @hunterw @AOC If you have $22 dollars and the thing you want to buy is $122 dollars, are you going to rob all the other people in the store to buy what YOU want? If you want to step in the ring Veganrella have more info than ‚Äòfair share‚Äô ugh that was such a lazy answer and you know it.
@CynthiaGubish @hunterw @AOC I could give a fifth grader the information I gave you and they would understand that ‚Äòreallocating expenditures‚Äô isn‚Äôt going to cover #FreeEverything! But listen you keep living in your denial bubble. I‚Äôll be here to help you sort it out when you wake up.
@girlsreallyrule If you aren‚Äôt watching you better not have a tweet about it. Also boys drool.
I can‚Äôt lie, Suits is a really fun show. #Suits
@ma_franks @AOC Her answer (in the same interview!) is that facts aren‚Äôt important. Just moral facts. Who gets to decide what constitutes morality? Yikes!
@CynthiaGubish @hunterw @AOC Let‚Äôs not forget the National Debt is now essentially north of 22 Trillion. What‚Äôs another 100 on top. It‚Äôs cool though I‚Äôm sure you actually believe your taxes won‚Äôt go up.
@CynthiaGubish @hunterw @AOC I don‚Äôt have enough characters to put it all out (it‚Äôs a long list). But when @andersoncooper asks how she will pay for essentially a 100 Trillion agenda the response was ‚Äòwe will just pay for it, like we do other things‚Äô Next Question.
@steph93065 @AOC Boom. Great example.
@AOC The reason you‚Äôre people‚Äôs new favorite pi√±ata is that YOU stepped in to the spotlight. If it‚Äôs to hot in the kitchen...well you know what they say? Get out of the kitchen. (Also before I get a kitchen comment just substitute any word I‚Äôm not changing an analogy)
@AOC No, just reasonable policy to ask that immigrants from the southern border use the front door. Nothing more, nothing less. I really don‚Äôt get the controversy.
@scrowder Let‚Äôs GO! Pumped to be able to laugh again.

@Alecmeyerr It is incredibly informative. @JonHaidt was easily one of my favorite guests @joerogan has had on! Can‚Äôt wait to read and listen to more of this work.

The amount of hysteria for the PRESIDENT to address the nation on National Television is scary. @realDonaldTrump just live stream from YouTube, Twitter, Facebook. MSM is going away anyway!
@hunterw @AOC You can‚Äôt be the face of a movement and own it proudly as a ‚Äòradical‚Äô and then duck from criticism. Can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it to.
Don‚Äôt follow the mob.
