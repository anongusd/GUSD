@Maria_Tureaud I just let Twitter do it's thing. But good afternoon.
@TreyStoneAuthor A bizarre death.
@Evelyn_Winters Thank you so much! Have a great day!
@AOC Excellent reply @aoc My theory is racism exists in part because we keep telling everyone it exists.

@AOC So what happens with New Green Deal now?
@HenriettaSnacks Quite a stretch from what Jussie did.
@mvrtinxo @JackPosobiec @AOC @FBI Actually Treasury would be responsible for her security.
@AOC The GOP is stalking you. So are the other 534 members of Congress.  They always seem to be in that big room with leather chairs. SMILE.
I don't remember much of my painful childhood.  Book 2 will be mostly fiction. Time to release the demons. #sisterfate #Amazon #amwriting
@reesevstheworld @PardesSeleh @AOC @JackPosobiec @OANN Publicity on Twitter doesn't make it any better. Probably brings out more crazies if anything.
@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec But @aoc wants publicity so where is the harrassment line? Personally I think the tweets are more to smear the guy. Surely she is smart enough to know the protocol if this is threatening behavior.
@etz @when_loved @16SAMDEAN @RealBankReform @RashidaTlaib I drive the same way I have since I was 25. I never changed my habits when my credit score changed.  One low damage accident in  26 years.
@etz @when_loved @16SAMDEAN @RealBankReform @RashidaTlaib That is a very long stretch.  Financial responsibility does not effect driving habits.
@16SAMDEAN @RealBankReform @RashidaTlaib It's not always a matter of responsibility.  Financial situation can make it hard to make payments. Fraudulent items can also lower your score.  Bad credit does not mean bad driver.
@RashidaTlaib Absolutely.  I hope the bill passes.

@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec Even if all those questions are answered,  intent has to be proven. Is the photog working for a magazine? Do they have a mental or criminal history? All those factors have to be considered.
@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec It is only harrassment if she feels that it is. Typical liberal agenda of victimology.
@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec As a private citizen I have no more right to privacy in public than @AOC does. But if she is seriously concerned she should have Treasury investigate instead of publicizing it on Twitter.
@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec She isn't asking for "it" but she will certainly enjoy the publicity of being a victim.  @AOC still has a lot to learn about the real world.
@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec , Sec 1 starts "with the intent to kill, injure, harass, intimidate, or place under surveillance with intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, and in the course of, or as a result of, such travel or presence engages in conduct that--" Intent has to be proven.

@kindyno @afewcrayons @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec What law has been broken? If @AOC isn't ready for public life she can try a restraining order, but I doubt it gets granted.
@kindyno @Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec If you are in a public place there is no privacy.  Consent is not needed for pictures.
@Communism_Kills @AOC @JackPosobiec Don't try to explain things to a liberal.  They know everything and are always right. Smh
@PardesSeleh @AOC @JackPosobiec @OANN Because she has no sense of humor and obviously isn't ready for public life.
@AOC You were a bartender,  the low wage motivated you to get a degree and find a career. That's how America works.
@AOC Self reliance is a wonderful thing. The free paycheck is someone else's tax money.
Progress is slow on the new book.  Sometimes real life gets in the way.  But it is a while until Christmas.  #sisterfate #Amazon
@RebeccaFKenney1 Never have and never will. They are far too political.
@bstrum10 @GobAbiertoBOL @AOC That in general is a true statement . But I also believe in self reliance not government intervention.  My personal situation I went from $10 to $14 an hour in a few years cause I was motivated internally to advance my career.

@OAP @DeWente69 @nasescobar316 @Trubie2012 @Freeyourmindkid Ok, agree with you completely,  the @ados movement is about money for a certain subgroup of a race. To me that does nothing for advancing the race as a whole and is very divisive.
@OAP @DeWente69 @nasescobar316 @Trubie2012 @Freeyourmindkid Aas?
@DeWente69 @nasescobar316 @Trubie2012 @Freeyourmindkid I think you generalize too much. An individuals treatment is based on how they interact with others.  Respect earned =respect given.

@LombardEmma My first film I remember as a child was man landing on the moon.
@AOC Excellent point. You got a lot to learn about everything but I admire your spirit and ability to dive right in and make something happen.
@HenriettaSnacks @lionorder19 @DNC @AOC You are correct.  I thank you for clarifying this. I do feel that further splitting your race into those that deserve reparations and those who do not is divisive and elitist.  Just my thoughts.
@HenriettaSnacks @lionorder19 @DNC @AOC I get that, but should not all African Americans support the reparations movement?  Or is it just the #ados that benefit that are supporting it?  I would think it would be the race as a whole since it is positive progress.
@lionorder19 @HenriettaSnacks @DNC @AOC Or are you avoiding an answer?
@HenriettaSnacks @lionorder19 @DNC @AOC You are going in circles.  My point is President Obama was African American, so in your opinion , why did he not pass it while he was in office or why did the #ADOS  not be more aggressive about getting it passed then?
@ewarren Seems like you already lost.  What happened to bipartisanship?
@lionorder19 @HenriettaSnacks @DNC @AOC Whoa....so now you are splitting the race further as in #ADOS is superior?

@AngryDem1 Never trust a politician.  I feel your betrayal but I'm not sure how its going happen.  Why would European descent white America let it happen?
@PaigeRaven1 @MChrobakAuthor @KamalaHarris Man wasn't around for the ice age. So what caused it?
@MChrobakAuthor @KamalaHarris If it means giving up my sports car and other luxuries that I enjoy, I'll chance it. The boomers didn't have to make that choice.
@AngryDem1 Ok I can understand that but what are you accomplishing by having government pay? Does it show lack of self sufficiency and pulling your own generation up?
@jauriene @zeke289 @BillOReilly Elvis had it right. Multiple TVs all on different channels
@benta_sony @KamalaHarris A and B simultaneously occurring doesn't mean A caused B. This report collected data and theorized the cause.
@LuzLuzgromero @DavMicRot @realDonaldTrump @ewarren One can not claim ancestry only when it benefits.  Own it 365/24/7
@KristieLyon @KamalaHarris The earth is more powerful than we think.  It will be here long after mankind is extinct.
@phaseric @theonejrf @KamalaHarris And you should learn not to assume because I doubt you are psychic but instead use a typical liberal move to discredit anyone who isn't one of your own sheep
@MChrobakAuthor @KamalaHarris It hasn't happened in 200 years of industrial America.  It was only until scientists started making predictions of doom that global warming even became an issue. The earth wont end in our century
@theonejrf @phaseric @KamalaHarris That's fine if we want 40 percent tax rate like European socialist countries.  But that sort of defies American founding principles
@phaseric @theonejrf @KamalaHarris Only the sheriff is elected.  Taxpayers pay salaries but the officers answer to their superiors not the citizens
@theonejrf @phaseric @KamalaHarris That's a long stretch. Taxpayers pay for essential services.  Has nothing to do with socialism.

@Recoveringarmy To finally finish my book and use my attempts and my story to promote suicide awareness
@tiyonistokes My life has proven this and I hope my book lets thousands realize this.
@Ekhay000 And remember there is a difference.  For example,  cutters do in order to release pain. Cutters are rarely suicidal
@samaritans How would I have my book promoting suicide awareness be  used by groups like yours?
@ismaelsantanaXo I've attempted so many times but out of this came my book which is to promote suicide awareness
@dikremasi Very tasteless and inappropriate
@JimmyVanBramer My brother had the same issue.

@piersmorgan @AnnCoulter Awesome,  I was actually told by my alma matter not to call students snowflake  cause it offends them....case in point
@tariqnasheed @HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter Very true. But isn't the generalized ethnic guilt part of it?
@HenriettaSnacks @tariqnasheed @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter Parallel economy is a good answer.  You should support local businesses and invest in your neighbors but dont take it to separatist extremes  .
@tywilson87 @ShowMe But you are penalizing individuals for being motivated to make a better life.  Currently a higher income means a higher tax bracket. But with  #fairtax  you pay  based on what you buy. If I accept a 10k car is all i need i pay less tax regardless of my income .
@HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @tariqnasheed @AnnCoulter I'm simply asking for a respectful answer on what the reparations will be used for so we as white folks no longer are required to feel guilty.
@HenriettaSnacks @intlatlas @tariqnasheed @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter I am not top 1% so I'm not on the hook for reparations either using that logic.
@intlatlas @tariqnasheed @HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter It's a starting point. Make it 10 million,  I'll wait for adult responses .
@HenriettaSnacks @intlatlas @tariqnasheed @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter Sorry I tried to have a adult discussion I am now more confused then when I started.
@HenriettaSnacks @JH_DC88 @tariqnasheed @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter Trolls don't have respectful discourse.
@tariqnasheed @HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter So you want to directly fine those who act in a blatantly racist manner? That's what I am understanding.
@intlatlas @tariqnasheed @HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter I'll hypothetically write a check if you spend it to benefit your own community. So $10,000 today, give me a list of what you are doing with it.
@tywilson87 @ShowMe Please educate me, where am I wrong?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Blackface was never okay. It was simply socially acceptable to be a racist in 1950.
@nowthisnews @AOC Is this Congress or Romper Room? She acts like a intern trying to learn the subject.
@tariqnasheed @HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @AnnCoulter How is money going to make it better? There will always be racist people so short of fining people for being bigots how does this progress us towards Dr King's ideal?
@HenriettaSnacks @LezIntellect @tariqnasheed @AnnCoulter I respectfully will reply that your own race has discriminated against themselves based on skin tone. Leaders like Ben Carson, Col. West and Condoleezza Rice have raised the bar. Asking for reparations is the opposite direction in that you are stuck in a victim mentality.
@HenriettaSnacks I agree but besides monetary reparations what would you like? What is America doing to hold any race back? I feel with inspiration and motivation anyone can be accomplished regardless of their skin.
