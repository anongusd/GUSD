@Richard45754241 @CybeleSees Now their son (my husband, who was a baby on this journey) is an actor and singer/songwriter here in KC. He wrote a musical about his family's escape and eventual settlement in KS.
@Richard45754241 @CybeleSees They have an unbelievable story-- he fought with the US then was put in "re-education" camps, then escaped with his family. They were captured by the Khmer Rouge only a mile from the refugee camp, nearly executed, and were smuggled out-eventually were sponsored to Western KS. üòä
