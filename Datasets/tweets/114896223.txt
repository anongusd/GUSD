At 11:30 AM, the Senate will vote on a move by Democrats to block short-term health plans. These plans offer an alternative to #Obamacare &amp; relief for individuals who don't want the high-cost plans on exchanges. Here's the legislative overview: https://t.co/8ch5l1sZwq
RT @JohnCornyn: Contention is apparently that "junk" = what consumers choose and can afford.  We don't need more condescending paternalism‚Ä¶
For the self-employed these plans offer an affordable solution. For people who want insurance &amp; don‚Äôt qualify for subsidies they may be the best choice. For Americans who are eligible for subsidies or have pre-existing conditions plans on the Obamacare exchange remain available
Short-term plans are optional, meaning people with pre-existing conditions have the same protections in the exchange market tomorrow that they have today.
Short-term plans can help many of the people who have struggled to find affordable coverage under Obamacare. According to the liberal Urban Institute, 4.3 million Americans will sign up for short-term plans next year, including 1.7 million people who currently have no insurance.
By blocking these plans, Democrats would eliminate an important option for those who #Obamacare left behind. Democrats are working toward forcing Americans into a system of government-run health care by any means possible. https://t.co/vK2TnBtAS2
