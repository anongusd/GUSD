Election campaigns spend a lot of time smoothing down a candidate's opinion on issues to a crisp and digestible one liner. 		While I recognize the importance of being clear and concise to enable accessible consideration, what about those of us who want to hear the next 10 words?
@AndyKimNJ By "preserve" are you referring to the program's current parameters or to the brand itself? The former would seem to imply that there isn't room for improvement.		It might sound like nitpicking, but just recognizing a consistent lack of precision in the campaign's messaging.
@WaveParadigm I suppose that adds greater meaning to the ones you choose to pursue in the one lifetime you have

Note: the above graphics were generated based on a sample (as of these tweets) of the accounts' most recent tweets, retweets, and replies with an exclusion list of common articles and words which appeared less than 5 times.
Not that Twitter should be the definitive source for political communication, but just to note that we as voters now have one less popular media channel at our disposal to fairly compare these candidates in a time where we expect to have many information sources.
While there is definitely an advantage to separating campaign specific messages from general political ones, the disadvantage in this specific instance is that @AndyKimNJ doesn't seem to have a second verified account for us to compare with the congressman's.

I think if more people had an even slightly better understanding of data analysis and sampling techniques, then citizens would hold our leaders more accountable for 1) honest delivery of facts / evidence and 2) follow through.
Although enough time hasn't yet passed for us to judge @GovMurphy's leadership, it is clear that any efforts he's commissioned so far to improve NJT have not yet made an impact.		Does NJT have any public improvement metrics in place besides customer polling?
I appreciate that NJ politicians have recognized on countless occasions the need for @NJTRANSIT improvements, but publicity statements and flyers don't get us to work safely, only actions will. Paying citizens shouldn't have to question if a train is safe, they should know it is.
I've been using NJT to commute for over 1.5 years. Today, I took a different train due to a schedule change: the #1208 mainline to Hoboken. The previous train was cancelled and we have an undoubtedly dangerous number of passengers. Even standing room is overcrowded. https://t.co/Lqw61RdrZH
@AnthonyBucci3 @Deadspin @NatashaBertrand @LastWeekTonight Somehow, despite the surplus evidence and bias disclaimers in @LastWeekTonight, it seems viewers still take the culmination of several local news groups reporting an issue more seriously than one large one.

@Yoshgunn This is the point where my idealist discussion hits the wall - it's reasonable to demand results, but this turns out to be quite difficult
@Yoshgunn Sure, but we still need follow through. Congress can discuss any bill they want on Twitter, but that needs to lead to a decision.
@Yoshgunn Keeping the public informed is vital. Being a leadership figure is vital. But let's perform politics on the congress floor, not on Twitter.
@Yoshgunn Yeah, this type of satire is good for a laugh but also points out a major bipartisan opportunity for improvement.
@Yoshgunn @wilw This to me is a more valid criticism. In my opinion, if you aren't also bringing a solution, then you're (probably) a part of the problem.
@Yoshgunn @wilw I understand that it goes both ways, which is why we ALL need to be better. Politics needs to become more solutions oriented.
@Yoshgunn @wilw Basically, my point is that this is becoming a known post-tragedy political circle in our society and I find it unacceptable.
@Yoshgunn @wilw I see your frustration, but the liberal counter would be (I expect) "there hasn't been a conservative follow-up to recent gun violence."
@Yoshgunn I think the criticism is less about the words and more about the sense of obligation / ingenuity.
@Yoshgunn Yeah, this is a common theme. People are pre-offended. I guess the reason the "thoughts and prayers" takes heat is because it is unoriginal
@Yoshgunn Also, better to screenshot than quote things which are likely to be deleted to maintain context
@Yoshgunn His wording is not necessary and inappropriate, but his point stands. Prayers won't be enough. We need to improve as a society.

So perhaps millenials are not obsessed with emails but rather are obsessed with doing things the right way and not wasting time?

"Leaders should focus in order to get things done" is officially a newsworthy concept. https://t.co/OoySOFkRcY
Just skimmed the article - it's actually, in part, about a lawsuit? Feel like that topic should have made the headline.
I only read the headline, not the article. But "the democrats lost in part because the Bernie supporters never let go" is not "analysis"

@Uber @taylorswift13 And also #Harvey, but I think the storm is being given the attention it deserves based on what I saw this morning
New @Uber CEO, North Korean missile tests near Japan, and new @taylorswift13 album. One of these things seems distinctly more newsworthy...

Those who manage news accounts on social media should probably be required to research the content before marketing it, as a best practice.
@facebook @Twitter My point, by the way, is that "apps use algorithms" is not an informational snippet and that this concept is not unique to China
@facebook @Twitter https://t.co/72TX2hBbEV	An old WSJ article about Facebook using algorithms to curate content.
@facebook @Twitter This was a point of controversy during the 2016 election. Facebook was accused of deliberately prioritizing liberal content in the feed.
Update: most feed-based apps "use algorithms to curate your news feeds for you," including @facebook and @Twitter https://t.co/4RlzTt9vCo
@Brine_Shrimp @Twitter Yeah apparently
