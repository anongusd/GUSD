A final thought: Most people in the service industry could tell you their own similar stories - they just didn't go viral. https://t.co/C1pnVfOPwg
@KapustaDiamond yeah, I mean marketing is a pretty specific skill and unless there's a dedicated person who knows what they're doing that happens all-too-often with events in Cleveland in general üòî
I saw poetry slams, author talks, world music and a book reading set to live jazz at the Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern - along with the usual rock bands. It was its own place. If anything, we could use more programming like that around town.
A lot of takes around Cleveland about the Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern closing (üòì), but what we're not going to do is say "it didn't live up to the spirit of the old Euclid Tavern." https://t.co/ZOxKHjSYSi
I see a lot of people predicting the fate of this restaurant, and it's worth questioning if that would still be so if it wasn't an unestablished name without power and prestige. And if it had happened behind closed doors, as these things often do in the service industry.
If a restaurant owner says this in the comment section of a major local publication, maybe believe women when they tell you about that thing someone said to them in the kitchen, at the hostess stand, behind the bar or in the manager's office. https://t.co/wOwrZ745KT

@Clevecarole @atrubek @anniezaleski That's a great point on the local angle. And of course, I'm always up for talking about interesting ways to cover books/lit. I'm far from qualified to be a "critic," but there's SO much room for more local features. (And *thank you!*)
@Clevecarole @atrubek @anniezaleski And yeah, I have a lot of thoughts about lit scene coverage. I have tried to incorporate more profiles/features (and PD runs some reviews), but it‚Äôs a tough beat, especially if you‚Äôre not tackling it full-time.

@melanie_hersh I hope it's good - it will probably depend on the weather. SZA had a good draw last time she was here and Avetts always do. (I'd like to see them both!) I think out-of-towners could come for New Order.
@melanie_hersh And like I said, I don't think they're doing anything wrong by not adding more. Do I think it would have gotten some more buzz/local people excited about it, though? Probably. That's why I was surprised!
@melanie_hersh For sure - I don't think big art projects ever have any obligation to work on a local level. But when it comes to marketing/enthusiasm, that's another story. I don't think you can take diff approaches and expect the *same* reactions.
@melanie_hersh yes, she seems much better now! She's had ear infections on and off, but I'm hoping this will finally clear them up. She's about 13, and otherwise a happy and bouncy kitty.

I have returned to my lane for a Saturday night, which is writing about a dog cookbook.
@inthewabe @jeffsleasman @evidentialdread It's probably part of it! And like, I v much get in the mindset of "I don't know how to explain to you that caring about this is important." But sometimes things do need explaining!
@jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @inthewabe I also think it's a good approach because it's probably the only one that works. (My thread was just meant to say that's unfortunate!)
And to be clear, I'm NOT knocking the approach. We should be ready either way. But if they felt like cities would work with them, they'd have way more of an opportunity to control their narrative. Instead of leaving it to people writing stories about scooters "being lit on fire."
@jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @inthewabe Exactly, I'm not knocking the approach. I just said to Kevin: If they felt like cities would work with them, they'd have way more of an opportunity to control their narrative. Instead of leaving it to people writing stories about scooters "being lit on fire" for the lolz/traffic.
@inthewabe Exactly. And if they felt like cities would work with them, they'd have way more of an opportunity to control their narrative. Instead of leaving it to people writing stories about scooters "being lit on fire" for the lolz/traffic.
@evidentialdread @inthewabe And when they *have* to do it that way, it's easy to find negative things online. I'm moreso saying that it's a PR/media hurdle than saying they're doing anything wrong. And if the things you said weren't true, it'd be way *less* of a hurdle.
@evidentialdread @inthewabe I agree, and to be clear, I'm not knocking the approach at all. I'm saying it shouldn't *have* to be via the guerrilla approach for the reasons you stated (though we should be ready even if that is the way they chose to do it!).
@inthewabe Exactly. I totally get + respect it. It's just that they've done it in enough cities now that there are a bunch of not great stories out, and the "funny" critical ones get shared and dominate the SEO when you google them. (Not to get nerdy, but also I'm kind of nerdy.)
I have a complicated relationship with nostalgia but I do love a good vintage/antique store. https://t.co/ZVs94Uk0ee
Anyway, IDK the best method. But it's obvious that the guerrilla approach is a statement about it being hard to work with cities (all over). I think about how much more smoothly things would go - from a PR/education curve/etc point - if it felt like they could remove that hurdle.
I am by far no expert on this stuff. A kind person from On Here sat with me and answered all my "but what about---" questions (with nuance!). And got me thinking about bigger things like this. 	https://t.co/ztDKEraRwq
Go to Bird's site and you'll find this ... at the end of a PDF. https://t.co/TjZUJMCKWJ
lol the first story that pops up for me: "Fed-up locals are setting electric scooters on fire" (A great folksy and fun reporting approach, because who doesn't love to make fun of reactions to a positive thing with kinks to work out!)
Bird makes a statement with the guerrilla technique - it's one I appreciate. People also get confused, and Google it and ... up pops a bunch of stories with very little nuance. (And there's obviously a lot of nuance to be had.)
I've been antiquing all day so I haven't been able to tweet about Scooters. But the former PR person in me has thoughts.

@atrubek @jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @gorealfar I'm almost never the type to complain about bringing in outside talent (and realize that's the roster for most of these types of events), but this concept from a NY artist to either tell the neighborhood history or "open our eyes to gentrification" seems ... off in general. https://t.co/FUUGblcgUn
@atrubek @jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @gorealfar I'm also confused - it says they asked her to make a piece about the history of the neighborhood (which ... seems strange and parachute-y), but also later says that they had originally wanted her to bring one piece (mislabeled in the story) and she changed direction?

I've seen two stories on FRONT Triennial that have quoted Uber drivers to, I guess, capture "what the everyday Clevelander feels about a big art event"? Ya'll ... this is not just "small town, Midwestern" drop-in trope-y, but ... also lazy reporting.
Maybe I have a chip on my shoulder because I remember a parachute journo tried to make some sweeping commentary about a cab driver not knowing about Sokolowski's during the RNC in Cleveland.
A weird travel writing cliche is quoting a single Uber driver, as if to symbolize what ... every person in a city thinks or feels? I realize it's tempting to use moments that feel serendipitous, but like, sometimes you have to know when to cut things out of a story.

@krissiepotato @evidentialdread @jeffsleasman @anniezaleski @rustbeltrants @TomHorsman Good point on the distance. Free parking + more lots are definitely not (ever) the answer.

@evidentialdread @jeffsleasman @anniezaleski @rustbeltrants @TomHorsman @krissiepotato I'm with you, of course. More paid parking = less driving = more spots available, for sure. I can't remember off-hand how much of the street parking spots around there is designated accessible parking. Maybe it just starts with increasing that #.
@evidentialdread @jeffsleasman @rustbeltrants @TomHorsman @anniezaleski I totally agree. I don't think free parking is ever an answer. I think the thread started with just observing that it wasn't the most accessible place, and what the possible solutions could be. I don't think there's any easy solution, but it's definitely worthy of conversation.
@jeffsleasman @rustbeltrants @evidentialdread @TomHorsman @anniezaleski free parking is always bad, but i feel this thread is getting away from what seems important: better ways for public institutions to serve those with disabilities, especially if you want them to live downtown and better serve a diverse urban population

@TomHorsman This wouldn't change Cleveland as we know it but - Passport app to pay for parking downtown (or the credit card machines, literally anything but quarters)
@TomHorsman @rustbeltrants @anniezaleski You know I'm pretty much always anti-more parking, but I have thought when going to the library that it seems like it could be difficult for older patrons + those with disabilities. Street parking can be hard to come by. (Not sure the solution, but I have also thought about it.)

@workinwithwords @JulieHullett I just met her at Waterloo Arts Fest, where she was working with my friends from the radio station. I, of course, said "You're a writer, right? I think I saw you on Twitter." As normal people do in 2018.
Was worried my quaint story about a local manufacturer of a giant inflatable duck would not generate much interest, but it turns out there's a twitter account dedicated to "ducking" issues in Ohio politics that has found it, so I'm good on likes and shares.
Before the Scherba Brothers launched their business in 1982, they were two kids just trying to figure out how to make a hot air balloon in their Cleveland garage. Now they make more than 1K inflatables a year at their 100,000-square-foot home base. https://t.co/EU0r2nggth
The world's largest rubber duck has become an international phenomenon of sorts. Most people don't know that it was made here in Northeast Ohio, at a place that also created the world's largest bounce house, NFL entryways, Macy's parade inflatables + more. https://t.co/EU0r2nggth

@nczeitgeist Right? I think that way more often than not. But also, I recently saw a couple comments on a profile piece that were like "hey, fyi, this guy has been accused of assault" ... and the comments were then shut off. That kind of thing is obviously a *total* outlier, though.
@nczeitgeist I get it - I have a lot of *thoughts* on comments we can talk about sometime, but anyway, you'll see there are no comments on prom-related stuff.

@atrubek @B_McElhatten @jeffsleasman @midwestcraftcon they are. Groundswell is/was still doing "pop-up" stuff, but there were a lot of factors in that space closing out of their control. I know they're doing the other Hustles stuff in Slavic Village which I still have thoughts on.
@jeffsleasman @atrubek @B_McElhatten @midwestcraftcon Wasn't Fount a Cleveland Hustles thing? True with Oceanne though. I don't want to see the same stuff at *every* show. Flea is complicated a bit with the Indie Foundry side business where she helps with branding. But in general shows, I don't know about that.
@jeffsleasman @B_McElhatten @atrubek @midwestcraftcon Right -- with shows you just have to know that some aren't going to be as good as others based on outside factors. Like, personally I wish MORE were on the same day, while that's probably counter-intuitive to organizers.
@B_McElhatten @jeffsleasman @atrubek @midwestcraftcon I also think no matter how exciting of an "experience" it's made, some novelty wears off eventually. Plus, weather can be such a big factor to put all your eggs in one basket for one weekend. Why I hope more retail works out - but then they're also competing with the events.

@GeorgeThomasABJ That's fair!! üòÇ I'm going to need some movie recs, btw. I've been slacking.
@GeorgeThomasABJ Cleveland Cinemas having cocktails is always nice!:)
@GeorgeThomasABJ I wonder if people are going to be into the dinner and a movie thing when Pincecrest is going to have other food places. Probably, though!
@GeorgeThomasABJ That's why it's hard for me to see that happening! Those are too far, and Shaker Square is way too small to compensate.

@GeorgeThomasABJ It has to have had a boost since Severance closed.
@GeorgeThomasABJ Right! That's the closest mall to me too. What happens after JCP? My hometown mall was leveled and it's now just a giant empty lot. üòê
@GeorgeThomasABJ I don't online shop. At 4'11, it's pointless if I can't try it on! Still so many dead malls, or nearly dead malls, though.
