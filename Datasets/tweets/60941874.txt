I fear that the condemnation I am tempted to hope for upon others for my perception of their behavior will be what God imposes on me or mine.  Therefore, I don't condemn, I pray instead and leave it all up to God.

@KamalaHarris The political desperation is clear.  If he were a truly bad human, the a accusations would be recent and similar to those made against Bill Clinton.  I'm very happy that people are finally seeing the hypocrisy here.  Thank you!!
@WalshFreedom It makes me sad but I hope it is revealing the desperation of some people.  I  pray that condemnation and serious consequence falls upon whomever is not telling the truth.
Anyone believing Kavanaugh is unqualified based on these claims is a hypocrite if they didn't condemn Bill Clinton when there was clear evidence and a settlement.  Clinton was notorious, but it was said, "that's his private life."  Feminists were never concerned for those women.
Any legitimate psychologist knows a truly bad person would have a LONG history of bad behavior (Clinton).  The political desperation of these people is apparent and ugly, makes of mockery of genuine claims, is as serious as claiming he pulled your hair when he was five years old.

Money doesn't corrupt, it is the lack of morality, the absence of believing you will be held accountable that corupts.
Has the diversity in Europe made it stronger?  From here, it appears to be a bit of a problem.
@SkipStein During the height of legal immigration, it was the duty of immigrants to integrate themselves.  Today, they demand accomodation.
@SkipStein Cultures naturally separate themselves.  Strength is not acheived when one culture demands others be diminished.
@SkipStein Is this the cause of the conflict between Sunni's & Shiites?  Seperation of cultures does not cause conflict, power seekers do
How does "our diversity" make us strong?  Our willingness to erase our own culture, our history, in order to absorb others has weakened us
