@APRoth19 @cdurkotr @FLGovScott With those 1.5 Mill reenfranchised voters from Fla we should be able to win elections easy if we can make the right pitch to them.

@EngineerMinded @RealCandaceO Yes sir my aunt just told me about this. I knew something wasn't right and then to take advantage of those group home kids is wrong.

@YesTo2ndChances This is going to pass. Mark my words. I wonder how republicans will fear monger this amendment cause that's all they do instead of being honest with their constituents. They want to stoke fear and panic to drive their ppl to vote. Classic republican tactic 👏👏👏
@YesTo2ndChances We see that republicans make some of the worst decisions when choosing leaders for the ppl so its time to spice it up a bit. Once they're allowed to vote we can start winning elections again with no worries about republicans putting goons in power. I'm sick of these bad leaders🙆

@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop Coming from a guy who hasn't been relevant in 40 years. When they're old that is expected from them. They are afraid of change because they know they will be left behind and stewing in anger. The Republican Party has no hope and will soon be voted out I'm praying 🙏🙏🙏
@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop This creepy guy had his child quoting trump and building a wall on an advertisement and this is the guy that y'all chose to represent you. Wow. The republicans have some of the worst characters in history I tell ya 😂😂😂 I pray this clown doesn't represent florida heisabigjoke!!
@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop When and where? I've been to one of his rallies in Tampa and they were telling us to act enthusiastic about him and his policies🤔I was like wow so this whole rally thing is a charade for his followers? Obama never had to do none of that. The enthusiasm was genuine.. 👏👏👏💪💪
@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop Yes but I like to hear different sides sometimes to get a better perspective on things and to make sure I'm on point. They are always angry but claim they're tired of winning all of them. They just yell over each other and claim they're debating. It's quite hilarious actually 😂
@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop Taylor Swift alone made 50000 ppl register to vote. Trump can't even get that many ppl at inauguration 😂 😂 it kills him because more ppl respect and loved Obama more than him. He's a weak child with little hands to me. Soft and never had to deal with confrontation himself. Weak
@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop All I see on fox is how happy y'all are for Kanye but in 04 y'all hated him and bashed him. Now he's the best thing happened to conservatism. It's funny to me actually. Y'all have irrelevant kid rock and Ted nugent as your celebrity endorsements and that's it. That is 😔 sad!!!
@LesSage7 @HotNewHipHop B/c they know that Kanye is out of his mind and being taken advantage of and they don't condone what hes saying. I wish more ppl would do the same.

@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 And we are the majority you're far from it.. Look at the popular vote. The electoral college has to save y'all every time. We know who the majority is and it's definitely not your kind republicans. You know it too but can't accept reality🤷🤷🤷
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 And that's twitter. We will see on the 6th. Pin this tweet and remind me the day it doesn't pass. I'll take whatever criticism then but it's going to pass and your bum a** ppl will be gone with the wind like the rest of your kind. History will not be kind to y'all I promise  bro
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 Now I'm racist because I'm giving you facts. Look at my thread I communicate with everyone. I interact with many races on a daily basis but can you say the same. Check my track record I've done numerous things in my community for all races but can you say that. You don't know me
@HenryJamesJimmy @cflierl53 @Clancy_Dew @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 I see more farmers and white ppl on welfare than any other time but when they receive government assistance you call it a bailout but minorities it's called welfare. The hypocrisy!! You see I come with facts for every theory you put out. I'm in the real world everyday making it👏
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 Haha..i have friends and family in the hood yes and also in high places😊😊 I can go and talk to ppl in the hood with no problem and show up to the university where I work and do the same.

@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances @work But Al Frankenstein had to resign because of unfounded allegations. John Conner's too. But republicans are complicit and will cover their folks right or wrong. That's why no full investigation was sought b/c they know what they were going to find and they didn't want thattocomeou
@cflierl53 @HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 Black folks been working. That's why I say y'all are out of touch because y'all act like this is something new that has happened. We been working before him and will continue after him. Y'all are so lost and out of touch with the real world.stay off faux news and get out more🙏🙏
@cflierl53 @HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 That is a republican talking point that I'm tired of hearing. So because e helps with jobs were supposed to look over his incompetence and racism. He and whoever believes that can shove unemployment. He has done nothing for black or let alone white ppl but divide us and despiseus
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances @work I believe republican enthusiasm for midterms Is a hoax and overrated but we will see on the 6th. Hope we can finally get some victories!! 👏👏💪💪
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances @work What about republican disgrace? They made rape a partisan issue now which is crazy but true. And Lindsey Graham scares me 😂 😂 they make rape and getting drunk seem cool when it's 5eally not. And I haven't seen any real republican enthusiasm lately. It's a ploy by Trump again!!
@RobVollat @Triumphrat7 @funder @AmandaB282 @taylorswift13 Hey rob what were they saying. I bet it was very hilarious. Kanye is done with us and now a victim of the "sunkenplace".its sad but true. Jay-Z and bey even disowned him. He needs a hug from Michelle Obama to get him right 😂 😂 https://t.co/pQKDU9OUFk
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances @work And I'm speaking on both sides. They all need to be voted out and put in fresh blood that can compromise on issues that affect everyday ppl. The dems seem too soft and republicans extra angry and aggressive on things that hurt ppl. I'm ready for them all too go honestly🤷🤷🤷
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances @work Yes but that was the old Republican Party. Things changed with Franklin Roosevelt going democrat. It's been downhill ever since.these new politicians are really cutthroat and can't compromise for the sake of the ppl. Too much tribalism to me. They need new young bloods honestly!
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 I'm confused?? What does being white have to do with anything? My best friends neighbors and coworkers are all white and we all get along with no problems even tho we disagree politically sometimes. It's about differing opinions coming together for something bigger.Thatsthepoint
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 If you notice you are the only one with opposition to this. You have to come out of faux news fantasy sometimes and get a dose of the real world because it makes folks like you so lost and left behind trying to catch up. And crazy when you meet real ppl🤷🤷🤷
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 I'm in the real world around everyday ppl who suffer because ppl like you are voting for them. Just look at what's going on now. You can't even hold a conversation with these ppl because ppl like you don't want to hear what they have to say and that's why republicans outoftouch
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances @work How about going independent then. The Republican Party is way too toxic to be associated with. Folks feel like if you vote with or support them the you're complicit with everything they do. You seem like a cool dude and I don't believe that but too everyone else that'swhatitseems
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 No they will be incarcerated for a long time I hope. They are the ones that I dont trust to vote honestly🤷🤷 and ppl like you I wouldn't trust to vote for me either. Just look at what's going on with the ppl y'all voted for. I wouldn't dare trust your vote ever!!! 👏👏👏🙋🙋🙋
@HenryJamesJimmy @Clancy_Dew @cflierl53 @YesTo2ndChances @Kaacee352 The same goes for you because you do alot of assuming also. I seen your threads and you are a very fearful and angry person. I think you should talk to more folks different than you to get a better perspective than the one you have. It works!! Things u don't understand u fear!!!

@RandyRsi @HenryJamesJimmy @YesTo2ndChances No that shows compassion and understanding the times which clearly you are so lost and out of touch with society.

@HenryJamesJimmy @RandyRsi @YesTo2ndChances Your mindset is more west Virginia or Alabama.

Why would you not want the same rights that you have for someone else. That's Jim crow era thinking bro. Not calling you a racist either
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances If I had that alleged against me I would be begging the FBI to investigate and clear my name instead of not wanting it. That means you have something to hide. You know the law. He has something to hide bro. A virgin in college 😂 😂 gtf outta here 😂 😂 😂
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances It's not a litigation it's a lifetime appointment confirmation and that person on that seat shouldn't have assault allegations or anything in that realm on their background it's crazy that he would even still be considered
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances And where do you get this 32 cat deal from 😂 😂 😂
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances Yes I see you're not going to be swayed on this. I don't agree with all felons especially rapist pedophiles or murderers but nonviolent crimes should be restored so these folks can get on with their lives instead of having this hinder them??
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances But Keith Ellison is not up for a lifetime appointment bro. If he was his nomination would be void right now.

@Freemyusa @marklevinshow @AlexJones Yes before he commits suicide or does a mass shooting. And yet he is the rational voice for all things Republican??  Wow they are going down in November if this is how they think👏👏👏 https://t.co/c2PrAk6kmy
@howardoyama Two totally different scenarios that you can't conflate!!! Just read what you just wrote and tell Me your theory behind it cause Ive laid mine out plain and clear🤔🤔🤔
@howardoyama But you donating to a campaign cause you choose to is way different than someone stoking fear and inciting fear of violence to get poor ppl to foot their legal bills. If you have legal bills foot them yourself and stop doing what you're doing if you can't afford them. 🤷🤷🤷

@alsodeplorable @marklevinshow @AlexJones @RogerStone What democrat has asked ordinary people to foot their legal bills?? Let me know and I will out them too. I don't agree with that especially if you're a millionaire. Democrat or Republican it's wrong 🤷🤷

@yashar I would not be surprised if we hear of @alexjones committing suicide or doing a mass shooting.  He seems on the verge of mental collapse bit still receive majority support from republicans. He says he's the voice for republicans so he's representing them and their thoughts! Wow!! https://t.co/xFdtj9UTnH
@yashar Why is @alexjones and @rogerstone asking their viewers to help foot their legal bills when they are millionaires but ppl complain about senators and congressman doing the same. It's legal welfare to me and it's not cool to use your followers for your benefit. #footyourownbills https://t.co/CGIlV3SEFM
@yashar Just like Alex Jones using his channel to beg ordinary poor folks to foot his legal bills cause he chose to do the wrong thing with his platform. It's dead ass wrong and he should be called out on it. You cause trouble so pay your own bills. You're a millionaire wanting welfare🤔
@yashar If the baker can refuse to make a cake for someone then it's OK for twitter to refuse hate on their platform. He agreed to the terms and conditions and he violated so stop complaining and abide by the rules like everyone else. No cakes no twitter 😂 😂 find another platform 🤷🤷
@yashar But republicans were all for the baker not wanting to make cakes for the gay couple but twitter can't say what they want represented on their platform?? It was OK for the baker to refuse tho right?? 🤔🤔🤔
@marklevinshow As I sit back and listen	@alexjones	 infowars it's appalling to see how the conservatives think. He sounds unhinged and maybe on the cusp of committing a mass shooting soon.

@marklevinshow Listen to his broadcast from Thursday and Friday with Roger stone and Evan Troy. He's clearly asking you guys to foot his legal bills when I found out he's a millionaire. Why don't he pay his own bills or stop doing what you're doing to accumulate those bills is all I'm saying!!!
@ModerateReal @tickytaimein @LenaLChen @TomiLahren You know it
@TomiLahren And he is a clown on the world stage. Looking like Putin's puppet. He couldn't even be man enough to look Putin in the eye. This dude is weak and an embarrassment to the US. Nobody respects or like Kim like they did Obama. That's why conservatives complain about coverage of him🤷
@tickytaimein @ModerateReal @LenaLChen @TomiLahren Yes I said it. She has more balls and intelligence than trump. She would run this country way better than him and if she was on the ticket in 2020 I guarantee she would win and you know it too. Nobody liked trump but they love Michelle and what she stands for!!!
@CCouto86 @LenaLChen @TomiLahren Sorry wrong thread. But yes I've seen him in Tampa and Pensacola and both times they told me and my coworkers to look enthused about him and his policies but that's hard to do when his policies hurt working everyday ppl. I'm not fake like that and I don't stand for his policies!
@AlanEMartinSr @AlexJones Thanx Alan. You seem like an honest conservative that has sense. Don't let him take advantage of you guys. That money could be put towards something to benefit you guys for elections and party not for his stupid legal bills. How would it look if I asked y'all to foot my bills??

@TheClimbTo1 @AlexJones I wish I would see a democrat asking someone to foot their bill.. I would try and out them the same way. That is dead wrong and that's taking advantage.i heard him asking for $500and $1000 donations from folks. How low is that when you're a millionaire? Spend your own money Alex!
@TheClimbTo1 @AlexJones I'm glad you agree. That is wrong to even ask ppl who have less than you to foot your legal bills when you're the one doing stupid stuff to have the legal bills. That's all I'm saying. They're taking advantage of ppl but it was a problem when congressman were doing it #footurown
@mull8193 @LenaLChen @TomiLahren What has he done but put tariffs on working Americans and put fear of diversity into conservatives. Y'all should be angry at how he makes your party look right now. He's embarrassing you guys. Conservatism is dead it is trumps party now 😂 😂
@CCouto86 @LenaLChen @TomiLahren Show me one pic where he filled a arena or gymnasium and compare to Obama or Clinton's pics. He is so out of touch the real America hates him and his family. I bet they wouldnt even attend his funeral and would be happy afterwards ijs🤷🤷🤷
@CCouto86 @LenaLChen @TomiLahren When has he filled a gymnasium or arena. I went and seen him in Tampa and they were telling us to act enthusiastic and happy about him and his policies. If he's doing his job you shouldn't have to tell people to act happy just for the camera. It's all a sham and illegitimate 🤷🤷
@LenaLChen @TomiLahren He can't even compare to Obama in no shape way or form. Please don't even put them on the same level. He's not even half the man as Obama or even Michelle. That's why his wife tried to steal her speech And the be best campaign Is quite hilarious when trump is your husband 😂 😂
@AlexJones I'm trying to figure out why he's asking folks to foot his legal bills for things that he done? That's not responsible to me and it's wrong. But some ppl are so blinded and ignorant that they can't see what he's doing. It's just wrong. Stop doing and saying dumb shit and payurown

Because they're parents trying to raise them right🤔🤔🤔Dem kids be hardheaded😂😂😂
@ImOnFirehuh @prettyindie @livingd0ll That's exactly right bro and that motivates you to have a 2 parent household because you don't want your kids to go through what you went thru growing up because you know its a struggle out here and you want better for them so you're grateful and humble but if you don't know
@prettyindie @livingd0ll And yet we grow up and do better than most kids who had two parent homes. Those kids most of the time are ungrateful and don't realize how good they have it and end up in the streets. But when you know the struggle it makes you want to have and do better so your kids don't suffer

@RandyRsi @YesTo2ndChances With the millennial minority women and Puerto Rican vote the democrats will assume power and that fabled old voting block will no longer be able to block progress. It's time to progress and get out those civil war era ways. It's 2018 now. New world new issues can't be foughtdsame
@RandyRsi @YesTo2ndChances I can't speak for everyone but the ones I do know are taxpaying law-abiding hardworking productive citizens who just want a voice in their communities. So they can take their $$ for taxes but not let them vote. That's crazy and real gangster like to me. Typical Republican b.s🤷🤷
@RodziczakCheryl @margaritamimi1 @YesTo2ndChances Haha.. And what's the real world in your 👀?? Is it what you see on fox news or what trump is telling you everyday. Conversate with real ppl with real struggles out here trying to survive and not the rich ones who don't know what a struggle is. The ppl who've been oppressed
@RandyRsi @YesTo2ndChances You never know the circumstances of someone's situation. Alot of ppl may have done something minor but do to the culture of the police they were probably railroaded to let others go. Have you ever thought that? They don't want minorities voting so that's a strategy to suppress 🤷
@RandyRsi @YesTo2ndChances Why does it even matter what party they vote for? That's irrelevant but if the republicans cared about the ppl then they wouldn't be worried about if these folks would vote against them they would be getting the vote but they only care about that fabled 1% and f**k everyone else

Read some books please!
@mick_henery @TonyOhms @YesTo2ndChances Growing up I know you were raised in ignorance to think that all blacks are lazy and ignorant so it makes you feel better about your pos life but as you can see were far from that and we're thriving on high levels now and ppl like you can't handle that. It makes you hate yourself
@mick_henery @TonyOhms @YesTo2ndChances I'm far from lazy but I know your angle with that insult and that's fine if it makes you feel better about yourself. Lazy ignorant are typical insults from ppl like you to make you seem like you are better but you're not and you know it and that's why y'all cry victim
@mick_henery @TonyOhms @YesTo2ndChances No not me I'm voting.  My whole family and I are voting but I do know good ppl who can't. I don't need anything from  you.

Ron desantis Rick Scott are running scared because they know what's going on in Puerto Rico and social issues in Florida they are out of touch. They will be voted out. We are tired of the same bs!
@RodziczakCheryl @margaritamimi1 @YesTo2ndChances If Republicans were concerned about real Americans and had an agenda that serves everyone and not certain ppl then they would want you to vote but they only care about the 1% and they know that once these folks can vote it's over for them in Florida. That's why they don't want a4
@TonyOhms @mick_henery @YesTo2ndChances It's fine that you don't agree but don't be mad when it's passed on November 6th. It's already garnered 3/4 of Florida population support and it's common sense. These ppl need a sense of hope to feel like part of society in order to prosper upon release. You ppl are so outoftouch
@TonyOhms @mick_henery @YesTo2ndChances Why you folks don't want ppl to have their right to vote is shocking to me but then again I always kinda knew that republicans try and suppress voters instead of bringing out more voters so it's typical. This young generation will set them free so if you don't agree that's fine
@TonyOhms @mick_henery @YesTo2ndChances The process is messed up with 10679 backlogged applicants. How will those folks ever get a chance at a hearing when the governor only convenes 4 times a year to make a decision. That's not right and it's unnecessary extra work when theyshould be restored upon completion sentence

Until you acknowledge the fact you will be ignorant to real life issues. You will be at peace with yourself then. I'm still waiting on you to verifyservice
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins I'm glad I can wake up everyday and not have hate in my heart but you have to wear that burden everyday because you're in fear which can cause you to hate what you 😱 fear.

@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins I don't believe you served; just want to use being a vet as clout it's typical.

@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins I chose to go to college and received a degree in African American studies.

@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins So trying to come up with a solution for gang violence and police shootings are not in the same context as a pursuit of happiness? We just want to live and be able to provide for our families without the fear of being gunned down in the streets for nothing. That's it.
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins A free ride?? Take from those who succeeded?? I'm so confused and you still can't tell me why you served?? I'm sure you didn't serve but want to use it as clout for social media🤔🤔 help me understand where you're coming from sir?
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins I have 2 brothers a father and grandfather that served so don't try and tell me about sacrifice and someone's rights. That's why they fought so that ppl will be able to freely protest without fear of retribution. You don't suffer from any kind of injustice I bet so you wouldntkno
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins You have black men dying everyday from gangs and cops and no-one ever held accountable.

@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins So can you tell me why you served your country (if you did)?? And why was the civil war fought? I want to know what makes you blind to everything going on around you
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins Everyone made it plain and clear why they were protesting but you turn it into something inferior vilifying it just like the blm movement. You turn something positive into something fearful and negative to get some ppl behind you. That's wrong and you know it.
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins I honestly don't believe that you served because if you did you would want for the ppl to exercise their right whether you like it or not. That's what you're fighting for right. For a safe and free country. And why do ppl like you insist that he's disrespecting the flag when he
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances But if you don't agree then just vote no. But with 3/4 of Floridians and 60%of the population ready to reinstate them your vote wouldn't matter. The young generation will set them free and they will have their rights. Whether you like it or not buddy👏👏👊👊
@LesSage7 @YesTo2ndChances But majority of those crimes were committed while they were young or maybe just going through a rough time in life you never know the circumstances but they served their time and are taxpaying law-abiding productive citizens then they need to have a voice in their communities 🤷
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins Tell me why you serve sir?? So that ppl will have their rights and to protest about things they don't agree with.. Like burning keurigs and Nike shoes right?? I hate when ppl start out the convo as "I'm a vet so" like whatever you say is righteous. I disagree with you 🤷🤷🤷
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins And you don't have to teach me anything I'm grown just like you. We see the world from two different angles so I wouldn't never tell you what you should and shouldn't do Because that's your right as an American to protest how and when you please. That's why you serve right??
@roosterchex @tonyposnanski @eorlins For the millionth time it's not about the flag it's about racial injustice and inequality. But when it comes to the truth you ppl don't want to hear it because you think it makes you complicit. Is that a guilty conscience cause you seem not to understand?? 🤷🤷🤷

@StormcloakD @YesTo2ndChances I have my right to vote I'm speaking for those who don't have the right but pay taxes law-abiding and hardworking. They deserve their rights also
@Bakari_Sellers That's dumb because you already paid for the product. That's just like when they broke their Keirugs and now they're back drinking coffee and using the Keirugs..these ppl are fools 😂 😂
This is the wannabe future supreme court justice walking away from a parkland shooting parent. Why is it that republicans can't face facts and retreat into fantasy when faced with truth.

@GovMikeHuckabee You caned the sense out of your freak of a son and Sarah looks like she got hit with the cane a few times 😂 I wonder if the son was sleeping with the dog and the dog didn't want it so he snapped and killed it. I believe that's what happened from what I hear. Sick freak huckabee!

@masfatninja @charliekirk11 Ive been voting democrat and I'm actually doing really well financially. Before he became president I was doing well good job benefits retirement. He is making the US look very weak. He may get impeached!! 💪💪💪🙋🙋🙋🙏🙏🙏

This book that's coming out is about to devastate the white house and your president can't handle real pressure or issues. He's weak acts like a child and I just can't support🤷
@StormcloakD @YesTo2ndChances You really need to get out more and catch up with the times. It amazes me how some ppl don't want other ppl to have the same rights as them. That's some cold sh**...everyone makes mistakes in life and should have a second chance to get it right Ijs🤷🤷🤷

@YesTo2ndChances When someone doesn't have hope they turn to crime. They know what it's like to not have their rights so I'm pretty sure that once they get them  they would do their best to keep it. But when you don't have nothing to lose no hope crime will follow Ijs🤷🤷🤷
@YesTo2ndChances Not saying violent offenders should have their rights back but what about the nonviolent Petty felonies??  Possession past drug offenders repeat traffic offenders?? They should pay taxes but not be allowed to have a voice. It makes ppl lose hope and when they don't have hope
@Magnum9846 @YesTo2ndChances Excuse me Chuck but are you a Christian and do you believe in redemption and second chances??

@RaidersacDc489 @don_con @RealCandaceO @RonDeSantisFL He's had two years to prove what he is and it has gotten worse. He's riding Obama's wave with the economy and claiming it as his. He gave tax cuts but that gets voided because the tariffs are raising the prices of goods so how is he winning? Low black unemployment?? Obamas

@doylebob @GlenninVirginia @DLoesch @NRA We will never get anywhere without first acknowledging the situation.

@doylebob @GlenninVirginia @DLoesch @NRA Bob why are you so angry when I'm being so respectful and just asking a civil question. I'm not here to bash the nra and it's supporters but im offering a way to get their name out the shithole it's in. Why are you taking offense to what I'm asking?? 🤷🤷
@doylebob @GlenninVirginia @DLoesch @NRA I'm not saying the nra is responsible what I'm saying is they have a powerful platform and ppl will listen. If they can meet in the middle somewhere they could have a chance to help fix this and everyone would stop blaming them. They would be helping to fix this instead of adding
@ceff7711 @DLoesch @NRA Yes but I don't want to use a gun for every little situation like some folks are doing. But in the right situations then yes the gun will be used. But killing kids and innocent ppl got to make you think about solutions and not continuing the same trends
@SuperDriver318 @DLoesch @NRA We will not get anywhere like this. Have an open mind about things sometimes instead of being stubborn. We need voices of reason with solutions but until then the @NRA will be blamed for the shootings and ppl will continue to die.. We have to start the conversation sometime soon
@JosephBuck321 @DLoesch @NRA Yes Mr buck I understand where you're coming from but your 2nd amendment right is not going anywhere I promise but you have real wackos that want to make it hard for law-abiding gun toting citizens that are doing the right thing. These folks are making it hard for everyone
@freedom_moates Hey Michael it's all about facts and acknowledgement. No matter what party race or background.  Without those two things finding coming ground would be almost impossible
@GlenninVirginia @DLoesch @NRA We won't get there calling each other names and not discussing it civilly.  Ppl are going to continue to die and the @NRA will be made the villain each time. Why not do something to change Americans mindset about the @NRA. Use your power to sew the divide.. Ijs🤷🤷🤷
@DLoesch I agree with everyone having their second amendment right and the guns are needed in certain situations but it's getting out of hand when kids are in fear of going to school and ppl getting killed over parking spaces. We as a nation is better than this and it's time to prove it
@DLoesch I'm in fear everyday because of these shootings and all I want is action please. Could we stop with the back and forth and find a way to make the nation safer with help from @nra Republican  and democrats? I believe that we can do it we both just have to give in a littletoachieve
@DLoesch Hi @DLoesch why wont they just come out and call it what it is domestic terrorism and it's that fact on both sides the mass shootings and the situation in Chicago. Both are horrible situations that need work. Is there anyway that @NRA and the other side can find common ground??

@DiamondandSilk With everything going on this is what you picked to bring up.  Wow.  You have a mass shooting;mccains death.. Manafort and Cohen indictments but you chose this.  Shame on you and your platform. It should be about bringing both sides together so we can take on the situations 🤷🤷

@RepWilson It's going to continue as long as we don't call it what it is.. It's domestic terrorism with the mass shootings and the situation in Chicago and until we acknowledge that nothing will happen. It needs to be fixed cause ppl are dying innocent and kids. Call it what it is!!

It takes bringing our ideas together and forming something great.  But we can't get there if we calling each other names and not listening to each other.
@FranzFurdinand @foxandfriends @RealCandaceO I don't get caught up in the isms.  I just want life liberty pursuit of happiness and I want that for everyone who wants it.  My friends are conservatives and we debate all the time. I just want everyone to have same everything no matter what party
