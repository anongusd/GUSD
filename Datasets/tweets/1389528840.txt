@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer No different than open carry.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer Not necessarily because both groups were straggling out and they were both spooked.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer *objective
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer Ok when you find it, I'll take a look. Thanks for your politeness. I'm nobody, but I'll be injective as possible. You need to know that I believe your leaders erred also with a lack of vetting, beside maybe  law enforcement, which I don't know for sure. Two views on that one.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer https://t.co/jpOjxOI4lK
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I have a few retired police officer friends and one of them posted this verdict today. I wondered why not manslaughter, instead of the aggravated assault verdict but I guess if you're committing a crime, then you could be aggravating the chances that you could be shot:

@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer From the videos I watched, the hitting if bats on his car were after he accelerated and plowed into the crowd. I did tell my further left friends not to take the bait and not to go there. Just let "them" have the rally without response.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer Even though I disagree with your group's basic beliefs, I do believe it's possible, although slightly, that he panicked, if there are missing angles of view.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I do think Dixon should have testified. But I don't know whether he did or not.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer Two good questions because I couldn't tell if they were rioting or simply walking and I don't know if they asked them why they were still nearby. I also don't know if Dixon testified.

@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer If there are some more videos that could show the entire ordeal with the car, which haven't been considered, that would be a place to start digging.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer That's not true. The defense did mention that the meme didn't show intent. Then the prosecution said in closing arguments, that sometimes a meme can show intent. Coupled with the pause before acceleration, it may have started to add up.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer You have a good point except I've listened to podcasts from the altright claiming he wouldn't get a fair trial anywhere in America due to the saturation. But you have a point there.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer That Dixon guy says he waved off Fields with his weapon. That doesn't necessarily mean he pointed his gun at Fields. Lots of folks had open carry there and yes, it can be intimidating, plus he may have broken a law but we're just not sure.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer If he's truly innocent, he deserves help.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer Other*
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer If you really dig and find videos and others pertinent facts, I think it's worth looking into but I followed each witness and the defense brought up a lot of the things you all are bringing up.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I'm just giving you places where people have logical questions. The speed was enough, the pause needs an explanation from him, and a pause is all it takes for premeditation.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I don't believe he thought about it prior to the rally but he paused and that's enough time to reconsider. That speed was enough and the coroner testified.
@BrianErickson3 @AlexJMcNabb I don't like bullies no matter who they are.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I watched videos of some in your groups prior to the planned event. I followed the plans as much as I could for weeks. I saw some real excitement about the chance to smash some heads.
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I do not support antifa but they did have a permit. After the unlawful assembly was declared, James Fields went back there, so both groups were being stupid.
@T6Rejection @RichardBSpencer Which statement alerted you to my horrible idiocy? I don't get emotional so was that it? You talk down to women without knowing much about them so are you expecting emotional responses only? I disappointed you?
@WackJCole @RichardBSpencer I fully agree that no one should have been there. But you said that anyone could show up, since it was a public event. I told everyone I knew to stay away because some of my friends are much further left politically. I saw it as bait for them.
@T6Rejection @RichardBSpencer Next time vet your invitees better.
@T6Rejection @RichardBSpencer I don't insult people in order to win an argument. I simply am suggesting rational questions after watching several videos of this atrocity.

@ScreamoCred But go ahead and continue grilling and bullying me. That's really smart. I'll still do what I can to protect you.
@ScreamoCred And their bullies.
@ScreamoCred No. I've stood between transgenders and gays and those weaker physically many times. I don't make assumptions. You do.
@ScreamoCred Punching is a metaphor for the bullying you want to do to me.
@ScreamoCred Listen Jackass. I've been stalked by Nazis for a couple years and I've been through hell a thousand times. I don't want a civil war. I want nonviolence. My method isn't exactly like yours. Oh well. I'll still protect you if you need me to.
@ScreamoCred It's a metaphor.
@ScreamoCred You just want to punch someone. Go on. Take your anger out on me, I will be the buffer for you.
@ScreamoCred You told me that the question was rhetorical. What was I supposed to think? A balance is smack exactly between Republicans and Democrats.

@EvanMcLaren I happen to be a born again Catholic if you can believe that.
@EvanMcLaren I may be wrong, but your impression of those on the far right is wrong in large part. Every single time crimes happened to us it was from white supposed Christian men.
@EvanMcLaren I live in a bipolar city. Half angels and half killers. I'm not naive and we've had way too much crime happen to our family and especially to me.
@EvanMcLaren I challenge them daily.
@EvanMcLaren You are great at baiting. I'll give you that. Then they bait but they aren't as great LoL. But we boring centrists are caught in the chaos.
@EvanMcLaren It's not toward whites, it's toward your paranoia and it's irrational in its response. But some of them refuse to calm down because of their personal histories. If they saw you all calming down I suspect more of them would follow.
@EvanMcLaren I didn't get this sense whatsoever. The sense is only in response to your overcorrections.
@EvanMcLaren I'm sorry about the far left but they are responding to your movement. I beg them to ignore you all but you know some won't. They are responding, and would easily settle down if you could relax.
@EvanMcLaren I'm sorry you feel this way. I don't. I realize the studies showing our birthrates aren't great but I have faith in my sons age group and their children's. They want peace and aren't concerned about your concern. We are German, Lebanese, Swedish, Norwegian.
@EvanMcLaren @dbzhulen This was intimidation. Not any better than the extreme left.

@EvanMcLaren @dbzhulen Evan, I don't like protests from either extreme. I do feel because I was following the planning and because I had a good sense of the true hopes, that your protest was actually bait for the extreme left. I warned everyone I knew, not to go. I do not think

@EvanMcLaren @dbzhulen When you chant Jews will not replace you carrying torches, you appear slightly obsessed.
@EvanMcLaren of causing turbulence. Do you want the world to burn? Overcorrections cause accidents.
@EvanMcLaren I didn't assume that you weren't kind. I find it difficult to believe that you have no fear in some of your philosophy and in my experience, my neighbors aren't a threat partly because I accept them. They don't see me as a threat or an adversary.

@EvanMcLaren It is my understanding that your philosophy prefers races or ethnicities to be separated or isolated. If not born of fear, what is the purpose of isolationism?
@EvanMcLaren for turbulence? Mother nature demands balance but there are chaotic ways and calm ways to reach that balance.
@EvanMcLaren Don't you think that if you move further right, to a more isolationist stance, the tendency of the universe is to try to counterbalance your paranoia, and possibly you could be the cause of their increased paranoia? Why not move closer to the fulcrum, where there is less chance
@EvanMcLaren What is the problem? Why such fear? Extremism on any side is a problem yes, but moderates are the bulk of the population. Strong border control etc is fine, but good friends come in all sizes and shapes.
