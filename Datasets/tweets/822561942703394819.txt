@Nainimat @ananavarro @CNN @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure you understand the vote that has been done 3 times in the house 	It was to give the furloughs their first missed check even though the govt is still shutdown.

@rockerlawyer @ABC Nope.	I'm agreeing with you. He owns shutting down govt.  And he admits it.	He says it has now turned into dem shutdown since they won't negotiate .	Dems don't rule. Neither do rep.	Therefor they need to negotiate.	Reps are.	Dems aren't. 	Dems are now responsible for shutdown.
@rockerlawyer @ABC That's right.	He said he will own shutting down the govt for border security!	And he did. And he negotiated and has been flexile changing his desired concrete wall to steel slats etc. But dems not negotiating. Dems are responsible for contiming shutdown.
@rockerlawyer @ABC They did try to reach an agreement...last March!! Trump signed bill trusting them to do wall after..said never again..nothing to do with ann...no dems on board so no deal!!! Then they took off on holidays. Nancy made no effort and chose Hawaii  then PR for other dems.
