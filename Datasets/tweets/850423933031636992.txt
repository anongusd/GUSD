@DaRealGrizzle @RandPaul Man, iits tough,  but Rand is probably the most constitutionally driven congressman we have.
@CarpeDonktum @realDonaldTrump This truly is some of the best work on the internet. Thanks for lifting everybody's spirit this sunday.

@CassandraRules We got Ralph Breaks The Internet Friday and I think this is the 11th time.  So far.
@Cernovich And concisely.
@ScottPresler Nice work.
@1776Stonewall @LouDobbs He doesn't tow the line. And that's ok. He probably knows more about constitutional law than any other active member of congress.
@jemelehill Her followers are paid for. How on earth can somebody speak in complete sentences like this?
@AOC So you are referencing language used by an actual black man in 1962 to justify your use of the same terminology in today's conversation. Why didn't you also refer to people as negros then?
@TomArnold @Cernovich This dude legit sounds like my 6 and 8 year olds talking shit. Stupid dummy head. Hertherthert.
@deplorable_phil @cs00582scs @KevinKtk789 I try to always wait for the punch.

@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Sounds like he's going to have some serious tweeting to catch up on. And probably a couple of vetoes.
@MarkMason987654 @McAllisterDen They probably just don't see you that way. Maybe you should cut down on your soy intake,  and figure out something that works for you.

@CassandraRules Nope. Like you even more. Factory farming is shite

@CassandraRules That dress is dope,  but it looks like it's made ir of chemically burned baby fetus tissue.
@PardesSeleh Is that a toilet paper doilie doll?
@piersmorgan Only if you can deflect the calls of you being a sexist homophobic misogynist. Look ma, no commas.
@Alyssa_Milano They used to be peaceful,  and full of love and kindness. How they've evolved.

@benshapiro Even if there's cheese on the burger?
@JeffreyGuterman @DonaldJTrumpJr Interesting takeaway. I didn't get that at all.
@KassyDillon Are you worthy of said ratio?
@CassandraRules I hope you are serious. She is either the best actor in history,  or just a sincere , real and likable person. Im going with the latter.
@michaelmalice @Cernovich I agree on some level,  but even the are so many red flags I can see how people would attempt to do so. Especially after the word 'racist' has been hollowed out the way it has.
@Alyssa_Milano When they go low,  ae kick em'! Amirite?
@Mikefiggs @MattyC801 @Alyssa_Milano How about evidence? Like,  period?
@Alyssa_Milano I'd this a really coded whataboutism question? I mean,  Trump sucks,  so we forgive this behavior? Or did I completely misread that?
@secupp Quit feeding the monster folks. She's so irrelevant to the world and society. She's obviously going down with the ship. She'll do anything for someone to throw her a rescue line. Anything but apologize of course.
@KassyDillon Maybe he likes carcinogens
RT @CarpeDonktum: Oh Comrade Where Art Thou?	Starring @AOC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer https://t.co/M9aDWPuhHA
@secupp It kind of mirrors the response of anti trumpsters when the story first broke huh? Just gross.
@AndrewGillum Says the corrupt disgraced mayor turned CNN hack. We saw what you did to our city and what you planned to our State. Which is why you were uninvited.
@IlhanMN You spelled planned parenthood wrong.
@ChuckCallesto I thought they were deleting the district
@Cernovich Who cares? He's a tool.

@thehill Im just here for the ratio
@Cernovich Why so many hits from all sides on Tulsi Gabbard. Homophobic, the interviews are hits and then 'David Duke  supports her' aand russia backs her.
@thehill I think a lot of assuming goes into making that connection.
@Joy_Villa Im for it.
@Sandralsachs @CampyVB @pragmaticshrink @MeetTheUnrealMe @ChelseaClinton 2 masters degrees and a doctorate actually. 3 masters degrees is what people who aren't smart enough to get a doctorate do.
@mjs_DC Kind of makes you wonder how good victims died. Maybe he offered them a priest before he murdered them huh?
@CassandraRules Pictures or it didn't happen.
@KassyDillon Hold on to your seat,  they aren't going to.
@Cernovich To abstract. Be more specific
@Sekusa1 @SenJackyRosen I still think she dayhrs "you're a disgrace"
@LadyRedWave @POTUS I think she said "you're a disgrace"
RT @usminority: I’m considering running against @AOC in 2020 in NY state’s 14th congressional district.
@CassandraRules @ReElectNydia @thecjpearson We bet get used to it,  this is part and parcel with Democrats today.
@RyanAFournier Sounds like they are literally being held for ransom. Insane.
@OfficeOfMike @elperfect Pelosi
@allidoisowen If they are in politics,  yeah.
@marklevinshow @LittlePubGig So. What you're saying is,  good lieutenant governor didn't stand a chance,  and this is an inside hit job to get the left of left governor in place of the left leaning centrist? You may be on to something there.
@RealJamesWoods https://t.co/I7EsnYqRi3
@Cernovich Why do democrats hate Schultz?
@Cernovich You have any predictions about O'Rourke. I'd like to see him debate.
@Cernovich Cuban Gabbard would be more entertaining,  but im going with Schultz-Gabbard.

@MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
@MichaelRapaport @gehrig38 @ScottBaio @RealJamesWoods @iamrapaport @WeAreRapaport Talk about a cocaine nose job.
@ShawnG927 @Sue564 He also said that capitalism is amoral not immoral.
@tedcruz More than likely the VD brain, aand the reality of his poor deceased girlfriend. We must forgive him.
@renato_mariotti You're a genius Gump. Nobody would've guessed that. Keep up the good work.
@thecjpearson @Sue564 It is probably best. They will only use these interviews to frame these kids further in an effort to justify their own actions. They are just looking for one soundbite to use against them to convict them of these false allegations.

@sarahwoodwriter @Alyssa_Milano Finally. Somebody that tells the truth about this situation. You hated them from the word go.
@Alyssa_Milano Sooo...... you're doubling down on this one huh?
@Cernovich I hope you're right.
@1776Stonewall @Sue564 It helps plenty except poor people don't need money. They need socks and vodka.
@TimRunsHisMouth Picking up fresh dog poop

@Cernovich Trump campaign should sell them. Among with life size DJT punching dolls. It'll fil their coffers for the next run.
@AOC I think that expected you to vote against her instead of falling in line on your first day. I guess ruffling feathers shes standing up to the establishment is the same year after year. Good talk,  little action.

Your intellect is not superior to everyone you oppose just because you can spell check someone,  or correct their grammar.
@KurtSchlichter @jaketapper @azcentral But just keep parroting everything you hear. It really doesn't help neither your cause,  nor the children that are not accounted for under this Obama era program. Yes,  Obama era program that has actually been somewhat effective,  just not 100%. Do you even want honesty?
@KurtSchlichter @jaketapper @azcentral These children weren't 'ripped' from their parents clutches. They are actually arriving without guardians,  and the government is charged with finding adequate guardianship,  followed up 30 days later. Being a government program,  I'm certain there is room to improve.

@giuseppemyself @MustangGirl3 @Cernovich It's not about matching their strength,  it's about making it so bloody,  they would never even try. Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
@giuseppemyself @MustangGirl3 @Cernovich That's not even close to what I'm saying. Governments don't become tyrannical against an armed populace. Simple logic.
@MustangGirl3 @Cernovich I've been a little consumed by it. It represents the worst case of unarmed citizens with socialized medicine,  and a tyrannical government. IMO.

@CassandraRules I've been completely obsessed lately with this case as well after letting it go for several years.
@CassandraRules I think she was misled by the ATF/FBI about circumstances prior to ending the standoff if I remember correctly. But she'll still burn in hell.
@CassandraRules I'm not sure where the conspiracy theory comes in on this one. What happened,  actually happened and is well documented from several sources,  including people inside the compound for different lengths of time during the standoff.
@BaggJames That's exactly how the feds spun it to the media. What a great story for how fucked up the government can be,  and how the media can convince us of the beast under our bed.
@CassandraRules You watched the A&amp;E special. I stayed up until 4am watching that. With commercials. So much new information,  and the interview with the agent that talked about being trained to kill. Whoa.

@decakarjeffrey 4D chess has some difficult angles. Vantage point is everything. I'm having difficulty with perspective personally,  but neither will I throw in the towel,  nor start rooting for anyone just yet.
