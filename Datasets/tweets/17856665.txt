@JimConig @DrivingGuild @lyft @juno @nyctaxi @bradlander ‚ÄúMeets or exceeds‚Äù
Every week, we‚Äôll ensure total driver earnings meet or exceed the rates required by the new driver pay law using an increased pay formula, until a trial settles the issue. It has never been about the increase to us; just about ensuring fair competition.
A NY court agreed that the TLCs formula would likely cause irreparable harm and allowed us to escrow increased driver pay until a further hearing. We‚Äôre doing better than that starting today.
Two days ago, I said we agreed with @nycmayor on increasing driver earnings in NYC. We just disagreed with the TLC‚Äôs pro-Uber formula that would advantage one company over all others.
It‚Äôs the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth2019 - I owe everything to my family - to the people who did all they could with no certainty that things would get any better. We stand on the shoulders of great people. https://t.co/Mh9ZiKxdSY

@NYCMayor We agree with the goal of increasing driver earnings and improving economic opportunity for all New Yorkers. We simply don‚Äôt want to have the TLC mistakenly hand Uber an unfair advantage over smaller players and actually hurt driver earnings.

He also had a subtle but important influence on my confirmation as Transportation Secretary. When I sat down with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, I learned within five minutes that Spangler put in a good word for me.
Two further CD Spangler stories. He was personally generous to me, naming a CPCC Scholarship in my name. The gesture was entirely unexpected &amp; made on my first day as Mayor of Charlotte. In a way, maybe I had done some of what he had hoped young people in Charlotte would do.

Political parties are about winning elections. They do so by differentiating one person‚Äôs interest from the other one‚Äôs.  We are going to have to force the parties to compete on a different terrain.  Who can pull us together better? 14/
One last note: it is unreasonable to expect political parties to fix this for us. While there are some leaders intensely committed to pulling us together, others just as committed to driving us apart and most somewhere in between... 13/
At the end of the day, this dynamic is not unique to NC but I have always lived with the hope that it is more fixable in NC.  12/
Urban and rural schools need to ne better.  Where is the effort to forge that coalition?  Urban and rural poverty are still variations of poverty.  Where is coalition to forge that coalition (I know where that one is!)?   11/

Can we love our country - or our state - and hold antipathy for one‚Äôs neighbor? 7/
And yet, here we are.  Is any nation on the planet going to help us live together and grow together better than your own neighbor? 6/
It can sometimes feel as though we are in two states at once - or even two countries at once.  5/
It is hard to escape the natural antipathies that arise: cities see rural areas as backwards and its leaders as pumping the brakes on progress and towns view cities as large vats soaking up all of the precious few resources. 4/

So much of what we are contending with nationally is cultural.  It is not strictly speaking economic, educational, political.  It is ‚Äúwho are we‚Äù and ‚Äúwho do we want to be.‚Äù 2/
Kudos to the @theobserver for its influencers series. A friend asked me what I thought the biggest challenge facing #NC is: the urban-rural divide. 1/
@nalyticsatwork That‚Äôs a casualty of lack of resources to install electric, which would allow higher speeds but hugely expensive.  The ARRA provided funds to de-conflict railway and other upgrades.  Every step helps.  Would also be great if SC &amp; GA joined the SE Rail Compact with NC &amp; VA.
#NC, this is a big deal, powered by the #ARRA.  Add to that federal money to build CLT Gateway Station, progress. Big kahuna would be shifting from diesel to electric (higher speeds!) from DC to ATL &amp; beyond, merge  #NECorridor into a full East Coast Corridor. I still dream big! https://t.co/BDbLMXZgDe

@markeatman1 It‚Äôs a long process but we set in motion a lot: (1) #RAL Union Station ($20M+ TIGER); (2) ARRA to increase speed &amp; frequencies between CLT AND RAL; (3) TIGER $ to accelerate line between DC &amp; Richmond; &amp; (4) TIGER $ for CLT Gateway Station. SE needs a compact like the NE.
Hard to dissect from afar but sad to see #Nashville reject transit referendum last night. Similar effort failed in #atl relatively recently.  #CLT remains frozen.  The southeast cannot build enough roads to cut congestion. Fast-growing west (#LA, #PHX, #SEA) is handling business.

4/ What to do about Washington?  Get to know someone who looks different than you, who thinks differently than you, who votes differently than you.  Tolerance is not enough.  We must find a way to love each other ‚Äî creating unbreakable bonds that no foreign power can exploit.
3/ I am all for efficiency but when folks say they‚Äôre cutting red tape we all should make sure it isn‚Äôt a license to roll over poor communities and those of color who have historically lacked a voice.
2/ A big infrastructure package should not only pay for projects; it should make those projects a better reflection of our unity as a nation.
1/ Racism and classicism wasn‚Äôt just embedded in our infrastructure by Robert Moses.  It happened everywhere.  Transportation REFLECTS our values.  What is our duty now?  Inclusive and meaningful public input.  Connect us to each other.  https://t.co/ZVG8gu8iSK

Just moved from tarmac to a ramp and awaiting details on whether we‚Äôll take stairs or other means to de-plane. Now the airlines have a backlog problem to deal with.  Anyone who gets to their destination tonight (as opposed to tomorrow) will be lucky. Power still out at Term C.

@rbrown225 Stepping up transit is a good deal for Charlotte - light rail, streetcar, commuter rail and buses. Hard part is paying 4 it.
