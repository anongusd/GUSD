In fact, #EqualPayForEqualWork could slash the poverty rate for all working women in half (from 8.1 percent to 3.9 percent) and the poverty rate for working single mothers would be cut by nearly half (from 28.7 percent to 15.0 percent).
The gender pay gap doesn't just affect women ‚Äì it affects children and families and our economy as a whole.		Did you know that women are the sole or co-breadwinner in half of US families with children? Providing equal pay to women would have a dramatic impact on their families.
Today, a woman still makes only 80 cents, on average, for every dollar earned by her white male counterpart. That gap is even worse for women of color.		I'm proud to have voted with @HouseDemocrats on the Education and Labor Committee to do something about it. #HR7 #EqualPay https://t.co/RmvSKCmCFF

In the last election the American people sent a record setting 131 women to the United States Congress. I was honored to be one of them.   		The @nytimes published this wonderful photo series to commemorate the occasion. 		https://t.co/gqiNbm58Pg
#ICYMI: Yesterday I was honored to have been appointed to the House Armed Services Committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues on @HASCDemocrats to ensure that the men and women of the armed services are well provided for. 		https://t.co/an2bUCZO74

We shouldn't have to shut the government down to have a policy debate. It is time for @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr to open the government. 		https://t.co/8qsSEPiewu
Today would have been Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 90th birthday. His passion, courage, and dedication to breaking barriers and building bridges is an inspiration.

I look forward to being able to leverage my position on this committee to advocate for the servicemembers and their families stationed at Hanscom Air Force Base at home, and the brave men and women of the US Armed Forces around the globe. 2/2

Today I was honored to speak on the House Floor for the first time as a Member of Congress. I spoke about the ongoing government shutdown, its impact on the hard-working men and women of Massachusetts, and the opportunity cost of the current impasse. 1/2 https://t.co/ppGIdHCygu

#ICYMI: Last Friday I was able to meet with dozens of furloughed employees from the Andover IRS facility. Their stories were heartbreaking, and illustrated perfectly the need to bring this government shutdown to an end.  		https://t.co/Od95zp93X3

The House is doing our job. It is time for the Senate to do theirs. https://t.co/MPSNM9WDEA
This shutdown is now the longest government shutdown in US history. President Trump has repeatedly refused to accept a bipartisan deal to reopen the government, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell refuses to bring legislation to the floor, which would easily pass the Senate.
It's time for the President and Senate Republicans to reopen the government. People's lives are not bargaining chips. We should be able to debate policy without closing the government. #ShutdownStories
"We're all being held hostage right now [...]" 		I've heard this sentiment again and again in meetings and phone calls with federal workers being impacted by this shutdown, and they're exactly right. 		https://t.co/GW1vbQBxoF

The idea that federal workers are "better off" because of the shutdown is ridiculous. This administration is so out of touch. They should take some time to listen to the hardships these men and women are going through. Maybe they'd feel differently. 		https://t.co/eDNxpzYi4j
I will continue to support and vote for legislation that reopens the federal government, restores critical services, and makes federal employees financially whole again. 4/4
In addition to toll taken on the workers, thousands of Bay Staters are at risk of having their tax refunds delayed. IRS paperwork impacting loans and mortgages sits in bins, unable to be processed. This is unacceptable. 3/4
...and some of those impacted were even still recovering from last September's gas explosions. It is time for the President and Senate Republicans to end this shutdown. These are real people facing real hardship -- not pawns in a political dispute. 2/4
I spent this afternoon meeting with employees from the IRS facility in Andover, MA who are furloughed as a result of this senseless shutdown. The #ShutdownStories they shared are heartbreaking.

That is why moments ago I voted to pass the FY 2019 Department of the Treasury and IRS appropriations bill to remove all doubt that hard-working Bay Staters will receive their tax refunds in full and on time. 2/2
Each year, about 2,728,086 households in Massachusetts receive an average tax return of about $2,864. Those refunds remain in jeopardy as long as the President and Senate Republicans refuse to end this shameful shutdown and fully re-open the IRS. 1/2		https://t.co/QtZELmPpsT
That is why today‚Äôs vote to empower the House Counsel to defend the law in court is so important. Texas v. U.S. is a direct attack on Americans' health care and this resolution makes clear that @HouseDemocrats are not going to stand by and let it happen. 3/3
The #AffordableCareAct was a historic piece of legislation crafted with those beliefs at its core. Congress has an obligation to preserve the ACA and expand on its successes. 2/3
In the wealthiest nation on earth, no one should lack access to quality, affordable health care or worry that getting sick could mean bankruptcy for their families. Neither should anyone be denied care simply because they have a preexisting condition. 1/3		https://t.co/GGmyoe3qoS
Because of this government shutdown, federal workers and their families are facing severe financial instability. End the shutdown, debate border policy after. People's livelihoods are at stake.  		https://t.co/6es0KDnHDz
This morning I joined @bob_oakes on @WBUR to discuss the #TrumpAddress. Negotiating border security is an issue separate from the responsibility that Congress and the President has to keep the lights on. It is time for this shameful shutdown to end.  		https://t.co/LWk3KWqAgW
