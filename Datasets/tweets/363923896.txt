Why it‚Äôs necessary that people like Tom Brokaw eventually reveal their truth because otherwise the engagement is inauthentic, potentially cloaked discrimination-denied &amp; hidden. We must face him in order to challenge him as being an objective, unbiased professional. He‚Äôs not
Children of color learn of their perceived lesser value from people like Tom Brokaw. Adults formulating ideas about people they know little about are influenced by people like Tom Brokaw.  People who think like Tom Brokaw are energized by people like Tom Brokaw.
Institutionalized racism/discrimination supports a system where the wellbeing of POC is less important than that of their white counterparts so there‚Äôs less $ for education, more $ for incarceration &amp; an almost certainty that life will get off track, thereby living the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù
One of the most dangerous threats to fairness is when  prominent figures hold racist thoughts. Their prejudice will taint the vision of masses who watch, trust, listen &amp; accept as truth. White impressionables believe they are better. Impressionables of color believe they are less
Understanding that change is uncomfortable, more so for some. However, change is necessary in order for humans to reach full potential. In this country, one thing that must change is discrimination based on race. We must stop allowing it, participating in it &amp; overelooking it.
Have you ever bothered to look at how this country has dealt with unrest &amp; what it has taken for us to make tiny steps of progress? It takes a lot &amp; still, we can improve. Are you willing to go back to an even less perfect society? I am not. We need to move forward.
Understanding that each of us has personal beliefs/views that we value, it is necessary to question those which infringe upon rights of others, as they may differ from one‚Äôs own.
Betting that most people recognize hate &amp; discrimination are exhausting. Because we know better, we must do better. Doing better requires we understand the impact of racism on society, in general. We must care enough to check it out &amp; resist it-together
Though there is always room for improvement, I frankly think that returning to ‚Äòdays of old‚Äô would be great only for white people who enjoyed a system of false superiority, which oppressed POC.  You‚Äôd have to be of a certain frame of mind to comfortably live that way
America has a spotted past, including less than stellar practices toward specified groups, resulting in a significant divide in freedom, wealth, health, education, quality of life, etc. Any improvements have occurred as we‚Äôve taken steps to correct those injustices
One of my problems with MAGA concept is that based on the number of reversed policies, which were meant to improve the people‚Äôs environmental, financial &amp; personal safety have resulted in less protection for us &amp; more opportunities for big business to make $ at our expense
When POC view each other as competition/threat, we are more likely to do work of true enemy-breaking each other down, not working together, etc.  When POC feel the brunt of racism &amp; hate based on skin color, it is so easy to believe that all whites hate POC
Some people would gladly spin concepts, notions, policies &amp; rhetoric aimed at dividing people with the sole notion of conquering. If we are divided, we can be much easier defeated.
The ‚Äúrelief‚Äù it brings me has to do with the logical &amp; experience-based notion that whites &amp; people of color are not, and do not have to be, automatic enemies. But, knowing the people who would have us conduct ourselves as such makes resistance that much easier.
The wall, as suspected, has nothing to do w/keeping drugs &amp; crime out. It is about trying to halt the # of Latinx/Hispanic people in this country, as data shows w/continued growth, whites would eventually become less of a majority. They are trying to prevent this, in advance
After recovering from the shock of hearing Tom‚Äôs statements, considering I never picked up his racist views &amp; enjoyed watching him before, I felt a strange sense of relief that my suspicion was right all along...Whites of a certain persuasion, are trying to divide this country... https://t.co/HDdodekBJ8
