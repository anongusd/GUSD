@ronpaul says a win “would be nice.” Cautions that all the votes haven’t been counted in Maine and says he’s in second place in delegates.
@ronpaul says biggest misconception about him is that he “can’t win.” References DMR poll which shows him competitive against Obama
@ronpaul on Newt: he’s  “going in the right direction – but not far enough.”
There is an economic argument to not running off to war. “We don’t have the money”
@ronpaul adds re Iran: Sanctions are backfiring – causes Iranians to rally around their leaders – just look at Cuba.
“I say going to war (with Iran) this quickly is risky and reckless.” @ronpaul adds “If necessary – country should declare one.”
On Iran developing a weapon. @ronpaul says again “No evidence that they have a weapon.”
@ronpaul describes himself in one word as “consistent”
