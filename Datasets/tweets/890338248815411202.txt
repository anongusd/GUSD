@SenSchumer Republicans want a wall to protect America, Democrats want the right to kill babies. Which one makes more sense?
@AOC So your prolife?
@ChuckCallesto The wind between my ears.
@AOC Didn't you vote no on two bills to pay federal employees?
@AOC Simply if you were to raise taxes to this 70% the only accomplishment you would have is to be the reason businesses fled America an America's economy collapsed.	Wage inequality is a result of effort inequality.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Could have nothing to do with people not being forced to purchase health care at the colossal prices the ACA pushed them to.

@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump You Voted no to keeping the government open than claim no responsibility for it closing must be nice.
@JeffFlake No body expects any Democrats to vote for it.
@CNN First government shut down Dems filibuster vote over DACA.		Second 9 hour non shutdown didn't have any affect.		Third Dems voted no to keeping the government open.		Must be nice to have all that power but hold no responsibility.

@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Your previous statement with Nancy "Trump doesn't have the votes to pass the House." Chuck votes in to keeping the government open than claims it not his fault it shut down.		Must be nice to have all that control and hoped no responsibility.
@SenatorDurbin So you voted yes to keeping the government open?
@iSee_PW @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump "You have to pass it to see what's in it."
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You said he didn't have the votes in the House and he did than Dems voted no to keeping the government open.	If walls/fences don't work why do you live behind one? why are they around prisons? Why are they around Military Bases? Why are there gated communities?	Answer your wrong.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So voting yes would of kept the government open and you voted no and it a trump shut down it happened Just like Trump said Nancy and you said he didn't have the votes in the House he said he did it would pass the house and you would be the one to stop it.

@SenatorTomUdall So voting yes would keep the government open right? But your going to vote no just like for Kate's law, stopping sanctuary cities, deporting MS 13 gang members and other violent Criminals than say you want boarder security and the shut down is republicans fault.	That's special.
@BillyBoy2749 @MSNBC So your stance is unless we do it one way considering Dems have voted against 7 other bills that would of got it done we can't protect the boarder?

@RepCummings It has nothing to do with America being better we took the girl air lifted her to a hospital and she died  hours after arriving not from lack of trying on boarder patrols part but because Democrats like your self encourage people to take their kids on these hazardous tracks.
@thehill This is the most agenda filled headline I have seen so far.		She died after a few hours of being with boarder patrol.		She was already dieing when they found her.		Boarder patrol air lifted her to a children's hospital to try to save her.		All facts omitted by the headline.

@CADudeFrank @MSNBC It is the leadership council for her campaign. How is that not working for her? https://t.co/0p7OATl29C
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Ok sweetheart keep looking you'll find it.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC I have always agreed with that statement I do not like a lot of Trump's personal decisions but I do like most of the policies he has worked on and the economic work he has done.	Also like not being forced to buy insurance anymore or else.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Well I made it easy with a picture so you don't have to work to hard to find it.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Here is a picture start there and keep going. https://t.co/5xGFHTCcE1
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Really? I gave you how to start researching yourself and instead of doing it you say I'm lying because you're to lazy?	I prefer you do the work read more than the news that makes you feel good so you can see the rest of the story yourself.	Or is it you don't want to see it?
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC No she did what Trump and all the others brought into this Mueller investigation should do plead the 5th on almost all questions asked.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Well I agree it's hard to find but if you Google Trump fights NY AG campaign finance lawsuit and look for the CNN article you can read it finding how long he worked for the Clintons is much harder to find.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC Well it was what came out. Not from Hillary of course but her aids that we're given the task nothing came of it because of Comes famous I didn't find intent so the FBI will not move forward the congressional hearings only brought out what happened they can not pursue charges.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Well from 2009 - 2013 at least doesn't say when or if he stopped just that he resigned in 2018 as New York AG due to abuse allegations but with a little time and research I will find out.	You could also do the same.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC Well to be fair she did bleach bit her computers and destroyed her blackberries and tablets with hammers so.... No evidence or no more evidence?
@BarackObama No.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Facts are provable points of reference like the name of the AG I gave you and the fact that he worked for the Clinton's before.	Both provable.	 I got those facts from the law suit filled against the NY AG's lawsuit off of a CNN site so the whole Q anon thing is reaching at best.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC That is what I wish more people would do instead of just saying he's guilty of a,b,or c and screaming at each other just to find out nothing comes of it.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Maybe the same reason you think you know what your talking about and clearly just regurgitate news headlines as facts I admitted I said something false and corrected it.	You did what?
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC Actually either way if he told his lawyer to settle the cases it maybe campaign finance regulation crime which if it is treated the same as the last President will result in a fine.	The thing that gets me is one President broke campaign finance law it was hardly a story but now!!
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Took two minutes to look up on a CNN web site.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC I was mistaken it was the New York attorney general who filled the claim to start with not a Federal lawyer.	Schneiderman is his name but he has since resigned after women came forward saying he had abused them. He was a lawyer on Clinton's leadership team for her campaign.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC If you believe that your a bigger idiot than I thought.	I bet you also thank Comey did a great Job testifying for transparency sake right?
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC You did say I was defending a felon which is not true because Trump is not a felon.	But I'm glad you changed your wording to accused because that is true but I have heard more than ten different things Trump has been accused of breaking the law by doing none were actual crimes
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Yes New York state liberal and liberal ran investigators at the federal level you do realize one of the people pushing these filings was a lawyer for the Clinton foundation right? Or do you not research just take everything at face value?
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC It's the boy who cried impeachment on a daily revolving door accuse the President of breaking the law from firing Comey is Obstruction and Trump will get impeached which it wasn't and he didn't but ever time someone says it's happening people are celebrating for no reason.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Actually the law has both sides arguments on way what he has done is illegal and why it is not but just because you accuse someone of breaking the law doesn't make it so and liberals filing law suits from day one over and over just makes them less relevant.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC I'm not a one sided person if Trump actually committed a crime he should be impeached and go to jail but saying everything he does is a crime and impeachable is just blowing smoke.	I am a firm believer in if it was ok for one administration than it should be for this one as well.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC FYI Hillary is still being investigated a Federal Judge ordered her case reopened.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC The last President also broke campaign finance laws is he in jail did he get impeached?	No he got a fine and the world moved on.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Yes same old story two years running this is OBSTRUCTION...	Blah blah no it's not on to the next ten things liberals say is going to get him impeached.	This week it's he committed a crime by having his lawyer settle a law suit.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC The problem lies in the fact that the news has said for two years this is obstruction he is getting impeached this is a crime he's going down and people who are against  there President and still upset about the election hang on ever word.	Words matter so be truthful.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC The out come can be debated because it is unknown.	How ever tweeting someone said something they never said is false	There for this tweet is false.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Encouraging someone that said they wouldn't lie is really hard for you to differentiate from telling them not to testify.	For me it is a bit easier because they are not the same.	If you post something as someone saying it when they did not that is a lie	Sorry you can't grasp that
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC No I'm saying what is said in this tweet is false because it is.	Sorry that is such a hard concept.
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC I know what he actually said and it was not having the guts not to testify it was " having the guts not to lie" to different things but being a sheep of the left gives you a nice soft place to lay your empty head so sweet dreams.
@_FlowerBeast_ @MSNBC So by make up you mean actually use the words a person says instead of words they don't while quoting a single word from a sentence?
@CADudeFrank @MSNBC Wow good job if someone points out the story is false they have to be from Russia not just someone with enough brain cells to look at the quote and the headline and see the difference.
@JoeNBC If he broke campaign finance laws he should be punished remind me what we did to the last President to do this? 		It's was a fine the largest in the history of the presidency but a fine all the same. 		So unless you want Obama prosecuted as well than your argument is partisan.
@MSNBC Well when you change the "guts not to lie" to guts not to testify you could have an argument but that would be the reason you only quote the word guts in the story because that is the only word reality and your headline have in common.	But hey your not fake.
@CNN Comey said he didn't remember, couldn't recall, or couldn't say over 200 times during his testimony either he lied or has Alzheimer's.	Also he testified that he didn't hear about Clinton emails till October 27 the IG's office says he received phone calls about it September 28.
@CNN So Comey can't remember, doesn't recall, or can't say over 200 times during his testimony to bring transparency then he wants everyone to vote for whomever is running not knowing who that might be.	Sounds like a man trying to do anything to keep what really happened hidden.

@TomArnold @NRA @DLoesch You do know the NRA has worked for years teaching Gun safety to all including the Black community before racial equality was a thing right Tom? 	To be famous for being married to a talented woman does not make you a gun expert, even if you played one on TV.

@MSNBC @NicolleDWallace Well to be honest both candidates suck she has said things that cannot be explained away, he had been indicted on 39 felony charges while working in the Clinton White House so who ever wins Mississippi loses.

Maybe if you ventured outside your liberal bubble and talked to people with different views more you would learn that nothing is as one sided as you hope.
@DeadBunnyFrank @vincedemello @MathesonBret @AngryandAsian @TIME @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama By the way the numbers for the stock market December 2016 are because Trump was elected.

@DeadBunnyFrank @vincedemello @MathesonBret @AngryandAsian @TIME @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Cool story.
@vincedemello @DeadBunnyFrank @MathesonBret @AngryandAsian @TIME @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Actually the failing economy can be taken all the way back to Clinton and the housing laws passed that gave loans to people who couldn't afford them and it crashed while Bush was president.

@vincedemello @MathesonBret @DeadBunnyFrank @AngryandAsian @TIME @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama You do realize that the top 10% of the Americans by income pay 70+% of the countries taxes so yes they benefit the most because they pay the most.	And even after the tax cut will still be paying that ratio.
@vincedemello @MathesonBret @DeadBunnyFrank @AngryandAsian @TIME @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Wow someone's been watching the news and not doing his own research.	The tax cuts are for all I am definitely not rich and I stand to get over $2,000 more in tax returns this year.	African American unemployment is at it lowest levels.	And real career Jobs not part time temp Jobs.
@MathesonBret @DeadBunnyFrank @AngryandAsian @vincedemello @TIME @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Trump has improved the economy.	Trump has improved employment across all races.

@DeadBunnyFrank @vincedemello @TIME The actual point was I made a correct statement you called B.S than looked it up found out you were wrong and instead of just letting it be you tried to explain it away after you were unsuccessful you attacked a word used by mistake and tried to stand tall on a grammar hill.
@DeadBunnyFrank @vincedemello @TIME So grammar... Proving my point for me makes things easier have a great day.
@sallyorme @Notloc4396 @JerryBeets @NYTNational That in fact is not true crossing the boarder anywhere not a designated port of entry has committed an Illegal act and is entitled to go to jail and be deported.

@Jaimebugs @vincedemello @davidmweissman You volunteer for the military doctors do not volunteer to work for what the government decides to pay teachers do not either.

@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii So there are not corporations with company heads making money from this it is just a few scientists getting just the money they need for research haha and I'm the naive one.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii What I'm doing is watching what actually happens not believing ever story told when I have heard them before and watch them be wrong.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii Because the climate will always change we are not stuck in a vacuum note are we in any great peril.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii True and that trend has fluctuated over the life of the planet.	Why do you think scientist went from we are going to a new ice age to global warming to climate change?	Because the theories have been disproven by reality every time climate change can't be disproven.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii Investing great word, it means someone is getting paid.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii So you believe what your told and buy what is twice as much money because it is environmentally friendly and the scientist said it would help you not die but no one could be using this disinformation to make a profit it has to be legitimate.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii Not only that but you do realize the temperature has gone down the last two years there were record lows this year so kind of puts a dent in the theory.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii You are talking about a change of &lt;3° so even a little inaccurate through the whole model off.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii And the oil company is the only side you see putting money into climate change results?	If so you are not paying attention.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii I'm not on one side or the other I believe the climate is changing and always has and always will I'm just not running around telling people the sky is falling because a raindrop hit me on the head.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii I'm not doubting the drive and want of scientist 150 years ago but when your dealing with the defference of a couple degrees the tools used and the accuracy involved need more than they did the best they could with what they had.
@Headless_Hunt @EL001 @mitchellvii What I'm saying it the predictions for global anything have been wrong more times than not and the methods used today computer models only have the information put in them the results of which can be made what ever you want them to show variables are none existent.

@MSNBC Yes the President has the audacity to want people who broke the law to be investigated, what a horrible idea. In Demoncrat land we only investigate people we don't like until we find a crime to pin on them, we don't have time to investigate people who have admitted illegal acts.

@AngrierWHStaff Cool name princess, thank you for displaying your bias and ignorance for all to see. Saying Hillary and her classified emails, destroying evidence was merely stupid but Ivanka who did neither was egregious. 	Hopefully with your intellectual ineptitude you were an Obama staffer.
@DrDenaGrayson @RepGoodlatte @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler @RepSwalwell Cool that you have this story to lean on but funny I never heard anything about classified information or destruction of evidence or bleach bit, by all means if Ivanka broke the law she should be punished as well as Hillary and the difference in the two should be about 100 years
@RepSwalwell @snopes @DailyCaller Snoops article say results mixed you made the reference than you said it was just a joke article proves nothing in your favor.

@Alyssa_Milano You do realize that were this so-called voter suppression happened was in democrat run counties and Georgia elections are run by the county so the people who suppressed votes were Democrats	The Republican ran state did not do anything untill a recount was needed. Facts
Is it ok to support a person who called blacks super predators, called the grand wizard of the KKK a friend and mentor and said they all look alike?  Meanwhile demonize a man who was supported by J.Jackson and Rosa Parks before running as a Republican?	Yeah Trump is racist.
@HillaryClinton @AndrewGillum Maybe he will write a book.
@CNN Further stating Demoncrats don't care about the law.	Dems only care about winning no matter how they achieve it.
@CNN @jaketapper @staceyabrams realizing that elections and how they are ran is by county in Georgia Kemp had nothing to do with the election and the secretary of state only participates if a recount is needed so all the voting suppression you are talking about in Democrat run counties was committed by Dems

@thehill @realDonaldTrump The truth hurts liberals can cry all day scream try to scratch open sold doors of the supreme Court but in the end you just look like a bunch of whinny idiots, but hey keep it up resist -delay -distract it's working out so well.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump How will you do that.	How will your resist and delay strategy change.	How will anyone know if your running as a minority or not.	How. Sorry I just like saying hi alot in your native language.
@CNN But look we have a poll by the way no Americans give a shit who the world trust we can what our president does for our country than we can worry about the rest of the world.
This Ford that Ford what's the difference. https://t.co/y9em08Slky
@ValerieJarrett You forgot to ( if you want to accuse a republican running for office) because if not why are you not asking your buddy Keith to step down and where did Roy Moore's accusers go and on and on but hey keep pushing the same B.S. it's working so far not for you but that helps the US.

@SenBlumenthal Who guides your Moral compass surely it is not God because he said you must not provide false witness,	So let's break it down you lied about your service in Vietnam you lied about Trump destroying America you lied about lying. Nope not taking my moral advice from you.
@SenFeinstein What was credible about them the mass amount of evidence, the witnesses that say her story was not what happened or just the girl who cried wolf probably coached by you yourself?
@SenBlumenthal If it is painful it is you and your counter parts that have the blame because of your constant use of fake people with fake stories real ones will be questioned more.	Not true what happened to Roy Moore's accusers after the election was lost or the wrestlers towards Jim Jordan?
@CNN Spoken like a true Democrat.
@SenFeinstein You know scare tactics only work if people are scared of you right? 	Repeatedly say stupid shit just makes you a stupid shit.
@NancyPelosi @SenateGOP You do realize it was televised?	America saw who the party of violence and unbecoming behavior was but way to go Spartacus what will you statement be for the Dem aid arrested for doxxing Republicans? Oh he was just kidding?
@SenBlumenthal More painful than when the truth came out about your military service?	What you might have said was even though we used every trick we could think of you are sorry the resist and delay game is now known to all of America and can't win but you will keep trying.
@SenFeinstein So your basing your decision on race and then claiming the other side is racist, that's a special kind of stupid.
@SenSchumer Wich one is it Chuck Trump's tax cuts are evil because they only help the companies not the worker or Trump's deregulation of Obamas EO's will only help American companies make more money or Trump help America's companies first.
@SenFeinstein So these students are mature enough to make government policy but not mature enough to purchase a gun, almost as dumb as the Democrats stance that outside countries interfering in our elections is wrong but voter ID is also wrong.

@Laursamp @MSNBC The only thing I can even see has maybe helpful would be longer waiting period but more laws won't stop someone who is already planning on
