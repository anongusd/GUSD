Everyone should be aware that @Ukraine is trying to light a #Powderkeg with #Russia. #UKRAINE believes they can get the #US to get involved in a larger geographical conflict.  I dont care how strong you think American Army is or how weak you think Russian Army is. US will lose
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight I have a degree in international relations, history,  and political science. #Ukraine is actively trying to get the #US to go to war against #Russia. It's a way for #UAPresident to look like a powerful leader
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight #Crimea voted and overwhelmingly wanted to join #Russia.  #Ukraine is trying to instigate a full war so that they could pressure #US into war

@TheRealGremlich @cvpayne Ethnic cleansing is the forceful removal of any group of people based on ethnic association.  The reason 08 was not like Jugoslavia, is because US realized they could not claim being right, and let Germany and France handle it. Best decision @BarackObama made.
