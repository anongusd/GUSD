Correction: “Let’s not get sidetracked by feel-good legislation” Lynch (campaign spox) in '01 after Lynch voted against assault weapons ban.
@EdMarkey began his closing remarks talking about how he wants to "Stand up for People".	RT if you stand with Ed!	#MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA
Markey closes the debate talking about how he wants to make the American dream accessible to all people.  #SoundsGoodToMe #MAsen #MApoli
Lynch's final statement in his final debate begins with, "Ed is great on policy, I'll give you that".  lol

@conoryunits http://t.co/TjLvC2C0a8 (quote in this article, and several others, please let me know if it's wrong and I'll remove it.)
Markey is in favor of medical marijuana but wants it to be carefully monitored and controlled.  Lynch sounded against, but a little vague.
"I have not met an addict that didn't start with marijuana" - Lynch (I have not met an addict that didn't start with booze). #BanThatToo?
Candidates now fielding a question on marijuana legalization (3 days after 4/20). Lynch speaks of addicts he's worked with.
Lynch continues to attack voting for bills that aren't perfect like bailout and Obamacare, has he seen who's on the other side of the aisle?
"You might want to create your own facts here, but you can't create your own truth", Markey to Lynch  #Zing  #MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA
Lynch hits Markey for telecommunications, Markey hits back with TARP.  #MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA
#IronWorker DRINK!  #MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA
New question- how can we improve the economy in MA, especially in #WesternMA?
Good answer by Lynch on Social Security, ditto Markey.  Both candidates knock Republicans for trying to privatize social programs. #MAsen
#MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA Lynch tries to score points by vilifying A-Rod.  #YouKnowYoureDesperateWhen... J/K... I like the A-Rod shot  ;)
Questions now moving to Social Security. Lynch, "I forget how Ed voted, I'm sure he'll remind us", lol.  #MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA
@harmonywho Make sure to check out the replay, first 10 minutes got pretty heated, good stuff!

Lynch naming his votes, Markey giving reasons for why he votes as he does. #AdvantageMarkey #MAsen #MApoli #WesternMA
"You're so far out on the left, it's ridiculous" Lynch to Markey.  (Better than being the most conservative Dem in MA). #MAsen #WesternMA
“Let’s not get sidetracked by feel-good legislation,” - Lynch in 1996 when voting against the assault weapons ban. #ThatsSecurity? #MAsen
Lynch trying unsuccessfully to paint Markey as weak on national security, but Markey won't even let knives on a plane. #SwingAndAMiss #MAsen
Whoa!  Already getting interesting, Markey calls Lynch's attack "swift-boating", Lynch tried to interrupt and Ed shuts him down. #MAsen
