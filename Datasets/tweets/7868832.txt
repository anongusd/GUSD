Donald Trump has said waterboarding is “great”. And he wants Haspel to lead his CIA. 		Over to you, United States Senate. What are you going to do about it?
Haspel's inmate was slammed into walls, kept for hours at a time in painful stress positions, denied sleep, and locked for hours in coffin-like confinement boxes.
Haspel would report back to CIA headquarters — namely, the failure to get any meaningful intelligence from her torture tactics.
Haspel later destroyed CIA videotapes documenting torture. In fact, she PERSONALLY directed that the destruction be done by an "industrial-strength shredder."
Gina Haspel is ran a “black site” prison in Thailand during the Bush years, where she allowed inmates to be waterboarded.
