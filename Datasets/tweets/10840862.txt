From 2007-2017, the firearm homicide rate per 100k has remained roughly stable (4.2-4.5) while the firearm suicide rate increased significantly (5.8-7.3). Reducing suicides should be a primary focus in addressing gun violence. https://t.co/4lzF510QYE @JudiciaryGOP @afspnational
While Democrats frequently focus on “assault rifles” in advocating for more gun restrictions, 2017 FBI data finds almost four times as many murders committed with bladed weapons (1,591) as rifles (403). https://t.co/F5ex12Uep9 @JudiciaryGOP
The federal government spent about $190 billion on civilian wages in 2017. Democrats want a 2.6% pay hike for those workers. They can find $5 billion to increase the pay gap between federal employees and the rest of the country but not to secure our border. #HR790 @GOPoversight https://t.co/beBikTicgz
According to @USCBO 2017 report, the federal government would have reduced its spending on wages by 3% and addressed wage inequality if it had matched federal wages with private-sector. Democrats plan to make this wage gap worse. #HR790 https://t.co/NQctZUWIFg @GOPoversight https://t.co/EnSkFTSE03
.@USCBO 2017 report finds "total compensation among workers with a bachelor’s degree averaged 21% more for federal workers” than private sector. American workers shouldn’t foot the bill for Democrats’ federal wage hike. #HR790 https://t.co/NQctZVejwO @GOPoversight https://t.co/5axjjEWdfg
Among workers with no more than a high school diploma, total compensation "averaged 53% more for federal employees” than in the private sector says @USCBO 2017 report. Democrats plan to widen this compensation gap. #HR790 https://t.co/NQctZVejwO @GOPoversight https://t.co/QpL2qg0pMZ
.@USCBO 2017 report finds average benefits were 93% higher for federal employees with no more than a high school diploma than for their private-sector counterparts. Democrats don't seem to care about pay fairness. https://t.co/NQctZUWIFg @GOPoversight #HR790 https://t.co/d0AziKKKT9
According to @USCBO 2017 report, “the federal government paid 17% more in total compensation than it would have" if compensation were comparable with the private sector.” Democrats pushing for a federal civilian pay hike don’t seem to care. https://t.co/NQctZVejwO @GOPoversight https://t.co/a7QtEsIeup
According to the 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, “Heroin production levels in Mexico, the primary source of heroin for the U.S. market, continue to increase.” #SecureTheBorder https://t.co/jjvqjnybyK https://t.co/nnS4HTvUaE
From FY13-FY17, U.S. Border Patrol’s recidivism rate averaged 13.2%. That's the percent of individuals apprehended more than once in the same year.   #SecuretheBorder https://t.co/hHON7YBv8L
U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 3,116 gang members from FY14-FY17. The largest contingent each year came from MS-13. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/hHON7YBv8L
In FY17, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized more than 70,000 lbs. of cocaine, 60,000 lbs. of methamphetamines, and 6,000 lbs. of heroin and fentanyl. Border security shouldn’t be a partisan issue. https://t.co/EOmETB1XT3 https://t.co/5ulThomAN2
