3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.		5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

5 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you. 2 Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.
3 Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!
4 Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of [a]Sabaoth.
5 You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have [b]fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned and [c]put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you.

Romans 2	11 For there is no partiality with God.
12 For all who have sinned [f]without the Law will also perish [g]without the Law, and all who have sinned [h]under the Law will be judged [i]by the Law;
13 for it is not the hearers [j]of the Law who are [k]just before God, but the doers [l]of the Law will be justified.
14 For when Gentiles who do not have [m]the Law do [n]instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having [o]the Law, are a law to themselves,

Daniel 7:1-8 King James Version (KJV)		7 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.		King James Version (KJV)	Public Domain
2 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea ( Mediterranean Sea/The Great Sea ) 		3 And four great beasts ( 4 Great Empires ) came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
4 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth:
it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

Cyprus	A separate Turkish Cypriot state in the north was established by unilateral declaration in 1983; the move was widely condemned by the international community, with Turkey alone recognizing the new state.
Both the US and almost all of the member states of the EU (with exception of Austria, Cyprus, Malta, Finland, Ireland and Sweden) are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).[
Georgia 	Russia has 19 military bases in South Ossetia alone and its activities in the region, on top of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, have continued to raise alarm bells in the West.
The Russian military and its allies currently occupy roughly 20 percent of Georgia's internationally recognized territory.
According to my calculations: Remove Ukraine and add Crimea and that should be eleven.

26 Then he said, ‚ÄúLet me go, for the dawn is breaking.‚Äù But he said, ‚ÄúI will not let you go unless you bless me.‚Äù 27 So he said to him, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúJacob.‚Äù

23 And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.		26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.

5 Even the Lord God of hosts; the Lord is his memorial.		6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continually.

A Visit from St. Nicholas	BY CLEMENT CLARKE MOORE	'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house	Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;	The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,	In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;	While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;	And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,	Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,	I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.	Away to the window I flew like a flash,	Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.	The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,	Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,	But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,	With a little old driver so lively and quick,	I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.	More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:	"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!	On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!	To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"	As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,	When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;	So up to the housetop the coursers they flew	With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too‚Äî
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof	The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.	As I drew in my head, and was turning around,	Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,	And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;	A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,	And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.	His eyes‚Äîhow they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!	His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,	And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;	The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,	And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly	That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.	He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,	And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head	Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;	He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,	And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,	And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;	He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,	And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.	But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight‚Äî	‚ÄúHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!‚Äù

Esther 7 New American Standard Bible (NASB)		Esther‚Äôs Plea	7 Now the king and Haman came to drink wine with Esther the queen.
2 And the king said to Esther on the second day also [a]as they drank their wine at the banquet, ‚ÄúWhat is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done.‚Äù
3 Then Queen Esther replied, ‚ÄúIf I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request;
4 for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the [b]trouble would not be commensurate with the [c]annoyance to the king.‚Äù
5 Then King Ahasuerus [d]asked Queen Esther, ‚ÄúWho is he, and where is he, [e]who would presume to do thus?‚Äù
6 Esther said, ‚ÄúA foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!‚Äù Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.		Haman Is Hanged
7 The king arose in his anger from [f]drinking wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king.
8 Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the [g]place where they were drinking wine,
Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, ‚ÄúWill he even assault the queen with me in the house?‚Äù As the word went out of the king‚Äôs mouth, they covered Haman‚Äôs face.
9 Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were before the king said,
‚ÄúBehold indeed, the gallows standing at Haman‚Äôs house fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good on behalf of the king!‚Äù And the king said, ‚ÄúHang him on it.‚Äù
10 So they hanged Haman on the [h]gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king‚Äôs anger subsided.

TRUMP UNCONVICTED FELON FOR CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SET FOR DECEMBER 21, 2018
Congress voted to delay the threat of a partial government shutdown until Dec. 21 as lawmakers try to avoid political sniping in the midst of the public mourning for former President George H.W. Bush.
The main sticking point in the spending negotiations is President Trump's demand for $5 billion for construction of a wall along the Southwest border between the United States and Mexico.
which was set to expire on the same day.
Congress voted to delay 		Leaders from both parties agreed early in the week on a short-term spending bill that would extend funding for roughly a dozen federal agencies past the current Friday deadline. The bill also extends the Violence Against Women Act,
Leaders from both parties agreed early in the week on a short-term spending bill that would extend funding for roughly a dozen federal agencies past the current Friday deadline. The bill also extends the Violence Against Women Act, which was set to expire on the same day.
The House unanimously approved the extension and the Senate followed with a voice vote on it roughly an hour later, sending the measure to the president's desk for his signature.
A two-week extension allows congressional leaders more time to negotiate, but the political dynamics that have so far prevented a deal are unchanged.
Republicans want the bill to include $2.5 billion in immediate border security and wall funding with an additional $2.5 billion guaranteed to be allocated next year. Democrats are only willing to agree to $1.6 billion this year

Answer: Woe means ‚Äúgrief, anguish, affliction‚Äù; the three woes of Revelation are the final judgment God pronounces on the evil inhabitants of the earth in order to spur them to repentance (Revelation 9:20).
The three woes are, indeed, a time of great anguish and affliction for those who have pledged their allegiance to the Antichrist during the end times.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Justice Department lawyers appeared to be challenging a Maryland federal judge's decision to allow a case against President Donald Trump to move forward.	The filing late Friday afternoon, however, was merely a notice to the court.
It comes as U.S. District Court Judge Peter J. Messitte is poised to allow the subpoenas to begin flowing on Monday. Such information would likely provide the first clear picture of the finances of Trump's Washington, D.C. hotel.
This is the second effort by the president's legal team to delay proceedings.	The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia allege Trump, who hasn't divested himself of his business holdings, is profiting off the presidency.
The Constitution's Emoluments Clause prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.

Acts 13:22 New King James Version (NKJV)		22 And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, ‚ÄòI have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.‚Äô
It was Saul who was the first King over Israel after they dethroned God.	1 Samuel 13:14 New King James Version (NKJV)		14 But now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart,

Romans 5:1-4 King James Version (KJV)		5 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:		2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;		4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
Hebrews 11:1 King James Version (KJV)		11 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
Your strength is in the The Word of God but you must eat it. There in is your victory.
For forty days Jesus suffered temptation and withstood it. He fasted forty days living off the Word of God. This is an example to us.
It is not so much about the end of the age as it is the end of Goliath and fear. Forty days he intimidated Israel but then it was over.	In Matthew 3 and 4 Jesus was baptized by John and immediately subjected to temptation by Satan which he overcame.
It is still about the mighty Goliath tall in stature some nine or ten feet tall towering over Israel‚Äôs Army.	But God chose David to kill him and decapitate him and to walk about Jerusalem saying, ‚ÄúIs this the man you fear‚Äù? 1 Samuel 17

#Kellyanne Conway, Top White House Staffer, husband Lawyer George Conway asserts in an op-ed to the New York Times that President Donald Trump broke the law when he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with Matt Whitaker on Wednesday.
Top White House Staffer	Kellyanne Conway and husband Lawyer D - George Conway
President Trump broke the law when he appointed Matthew Whitaker to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, lawyers Neal Katyal and George Conway argue in a New York Times op-ed Thursday.
according to Katyal and Conway.
But Whitaker was serving as Sessions‚Äôs chief of staff, which is not a Senate-confirmed post. Before that, he‚Äôd been out of government for eight years. That makes his appointment as the acting head of a Cabinet agency highly unusual, at the very least ‚Äî and unconstitutional
Indeed, it was very strange that Trump bypassed the next in line for the post, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and slotted in Whitaker instead. Rosenstein had been confirmed by the Senate for the deputy job.
The problem, they say, is that Whitaker was not confirmed by the Senate. They argue that that violates the Constitution‚Äôs Appointments Clause, which they say requires all ‚Äúprincipal officers‚Äù of the government to be Senate-confirmed.
Kellyanne Conway.
The argument may seem unsurprising coming from Katyal, who‚Äôs a Democrat and was President Obama‚Äôs solicitor general. But the fact that George Conway helped write the piece will certainly raise eyebrows, since he is of course the husband of top White House staffer
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,‚Äù they write.
George Conway‚Äôs frequent public criticisms of Trump and his administration have been much noted, but here he is outright calling a major Trump appointment illegal, on an issue for which the stakes for the president and his family are enormously high.
Whitaker‚Äôs appointment spurred fears that Trump was installing a loyalist to take control of and perhaps crush special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs Russia investigation. And this new argument could be the opening volley in some eventual court battle over Whitaker‚Äôs authority.

In another terrifying development for those who believe that android advancement will lead to the extinction of the human race, robots will soon be building other robots in a $150 million factory in China.
Swiss engineering group ABB plans to have the Shanghai-based factory up and running by the end of 2020 and it will produce robots for the Asian market. ABB‚Äôs industrial machines are used in various industries to build everything from automobiles to electronic devices.
The company says that the new robots will work alongside humans in the new 75,000-square-foot facility. They will be tasked with many of the small parts assembly tasks needed to build the robots it sells.
Last year one of every three robots sold worldwide went to China. Its automated workforce has expanded rapidly as the cost of employing actual humans continues to rise.
As well as building themselves, robots are now tearing things up on Tinder, doing parkour and even giving evidence in parliament. All ominous signs that they are secretly plotting to enslave the human race.
However that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a concern for ABB which proudly boasts that its using ‚Äúcutting-edge artificial intelligence research to create the most sophisticated, automated and flexible Factory of the Future.‚Äù

The Chinese factory is the latest development in a growing trend of robot cooperation. Earlier this month US company FLIR unveiled a robot that can deploy other robots. The system features a tiny unmanned aerial vehicle that‚Äôs designed for the military, government agencies,

South Africa is a whizz at slashing the environmental impact of construction, as bricks made from human urine are set to come on stream thanks to students at the University of Cape Town.
The young researchers managed to combine people‚Äôs urine, which had been collected from specially designed male urinals at the university‚Äôs engineering building, with sand and bacteria.
as a by-product, which can be used as components in commercial fertilisers.
A process called microbial carbonate precipitation reportedly allows the bricks to solidify at room temperature, unlike traditional bricks that are baked in high-temperature kilns, producing a lot of carbon dioxide. Moreover, the bio-brick process produces nitrogen and potassium
a chemical reaction,‚Äù Senior Lecturer in Water Quality at UCT Dyllon Randall said, commenting on the matter.
‚ÄúThe bio-bricks are created through a natural process called microbial carbonate precipitation, not unlike the way seashells are formed. Loose sand is colonized with bacteria that produce urease. The urease breaks down the urea in urine while producing calcium carbonate through
‚ÄúThis cements the sand into any shape, whether a solid column or, now for the first time, a rectangular building brick,‚Äù he added.
The strength and shape of the bio-bricks can be altered as required. The newly invented construction material can be 40-percent stronger than limestone brick, according to Randall.
Dyllon Randall and his students, Vukheta Mukhari and Suzanne Lambert ¬© UCT / Robyn Walker	‚ÄúThe longer you allow the little bacteria to make the cement, the stronger the product is going to be,‚Äù he said, noting that the process might be further optimized.
According to Randall, urine is liquid gold. ‚ÄúBy volume, urine accounts for less than one percent of domestic wastewater, but it contains 80 percent of the nitrogen, 56 percent of the phosphorus and 63 percent of the potassium found in wastewater,‚Äù he said.

2 Thessalonians 2 New Living Translation (NLT)		Events prior to the Lord‚Äôs Second Coming	2 Now, dear brothers and sisters,[a] let us clarify some things about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we will be gathered to meet him. A
2 Don‚Äôt be so easily shaken or alarmed by those who say that the day of the Lord has already begun. Don‚Äôt believe them, even if they claim to have had a spiritual vision, a revelation, or a letter supposedly from us.
3 Don‚Äôt be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness[b] is revealed‚Äîthe one who brings destruction.[c]
A good 4 He will exalt himself and defy everything that people call god and every object of worship. He will even sit in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God.		5 Don‚Äôt you remember that I told you about all this when I was with you?
6 And you know what is holding him back, for he can be revealed only when his time comes. 7 For this lawlessness is already at work secretly, and it will remain secret until the one who is holding it back steps out of the way.
8 Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by the splendor of his coming.
9 This man will come to do the work of Satan with counterfeit power and signs and miracles. 10 He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them.
11 So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies. 12 Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth.

Isaiah 53 New American Standard Bible (NASB)		The Suffering Servant	53 Who has believed our message?	And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
2 For He grew up before Him like a tender [a]shoot,	And like a root out of parched ground;	He has no stately form or majesty	That we should look upon Him,	Nor appearance that we should [b]be attracted to Him.
3 He was despised and forsaken of men,	A man of [c]sorrows and acquainted with [d]grief;	And like one from whom men hide their face	He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
Footnotes:		53:4 Or Yet it was our sicknesses he carried; / it was our diseases.
Isaiah 53:4 New Living Translation (NLT)		4 Yet it was our weaknesses he carried;	    it was our sorrows[a] that weighed him down.	And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God,	    a punishment for his own sins!
5 But He was [h]pierced through for our transgressions,	He was crushed for our iniquities;	The chastening for our [i]well-being fell upon Him,	And by His scourging we are healed.
No more predictions: they turn out to be lies and God hates a liar. Forgive me Lord in Jesus name.
6 All of us like sheep have gone astray,	Each of us has turned to his own way;	But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all	To [j]fall on Him.
12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. 13 Then Pilate *said to Him, ‚ÄúDo You not hear how many things they testify against You?‚Äù 14 And He did not answer him with regard to even a single [a]charge, so the governor was quite amazed.
Matthew 27:11-14 New American Standard Bible (NASB)		Jesus before Pilate	11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, ‚ÄúAre You the King of the Jews?‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúIt is as you say.‚Äù
7 He was oppressed and He was afflicted,	Yet He did not open His mouth;	Like a lamb that is led to slaughter,	And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,	So He did not open His mouth.
8 By oppression and judgment He was taken away;	And as for His generation, who considered	That He was cut off out of the land of the [k]living	For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?
Matthew 27:57-60 New American Standard Bible (NASB)		Jesus Is Buried	57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
58 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.		New American Standard Bible (NASB)
9 His grave was assigned with wicked men,	Yet He was with a rich man in His death,	Because He had done no violence,	Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
10 But the Lord was pleased	To crush Him, [l]putting Him to grief;	If [m]He would render Himself as a guilt offering,	He will see His [n]offspring,	He will prolong His days,	And the [o]good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in His hand.
11 As a result of the [p]anguish of His soul,	He will see [q]it and be satisfied;	By His knowledge the Righteous One,	My Servant, will justify the many,	As He will bear their iniquities.
12 Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great,	And He will divide the booty with the strong;	Because He poured out [r]Himself to death,	And was numbered with the transgressors;	Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,	And interceded for the transgressors.

When officers arrived at the site, they found a helmet-like, charred, metallic object and assumed that it was part of a satellite.

which provides satellite telephone services around the world.
After the sheriff's office inquired with the nearby Vandenberg Air Force Base, which conducts launches of rockets into space, on the origin of the object, it turned out to be a fuel tank from a communications satellite owned by Iridium Communications,
The satellite had been orbiting Earth, along with other man-made space junk, until it eventually re-entered the atmosphere. It's unclear where the rest of the satellite crashed.
An Iridium representative, contacted by the police, confirmed that it was a part of their decommissioned Iridium Satellite #70, launched between late 1997 and early 1998.

Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister has explicitly warned Hamas that the IDF is edging closer to yet another full-blown military operation against the Gaza strip to put an end to cross-border violence.
and the coastal enclave and promised to act unless Hamas stops launching rockets and incendiary balloons that threaten Israeli civilians.
Tel Aviv's patience appears to be running extremely thin from the seven months of violence along the Israeli-Gaza border. The Jewish nation is also uncompromising in its commitment to prevent Palestinian boats sailing up to the maritime boundary between Israel
"I said at the beginning of this week's cabinet meeting that if these attacks do not stop, we will stop them. I want to tell you today [that] Israel will act with great force."
"Israel views, with great severity, the attacks on it along the fence, on the Gaza perimeter, on Beersheba, everywhere," Netanyahu said Wednesday after the IDF struck Hamas targets in retaliation to rocket fire which damaged a house in the Southern Israeli city of Beersheba.
but Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has repeatedly proposed authorizing large-scale military action in the Palestinian territory to put an end to border violence.
Netanyahu's statements echoed the message he sent to Hamas on Sunday, when he warned the militant group that the "Israeli army is edging closer to a large-scale military activity." The commencement of a possible military incursion into Gaza has not been decided yet,
into Gaza, stressing that "a serious blow to Hamas could bring us at least five more years of quiet."
Just before Palestinians struck a residential home in Beersheba early Wednesday and launched another projectile into the Mediterranean, Lieberman warned that Israel is "not prepared to accept the level of violence," calling on the Cabinet to authorize an incursion
The United States opposes a plan by South and North Korea to set up a no-fly zone over their heavily fortified border, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. Washington and Seoul both publicly insist they are on the same page about dealing with Pyongyang.
The military accord, sealed during last month‚Äôs summit in Pyongyang, is one of the most concrete agreements between the neighbors this year. US officials have raised concerns that it could undermine defense readiness and comes without substantial progress on denuclearization.
However, there are growing signs of disagreement as South and North Korea forge ahead with plans to defuse military tensions and rebuild economic ties.

that was only premiered during the Russian president‚Äôs inauguration this May.
After concluding their talks on Wednesday, the two leaders traveled to the Sochi Autodrom, which just recently hosted the Russian F1 Grand Prix. They took the trip in President Putin‚Äôs new Russian-made Aurus Senat Limousine
At the race track, Trade Minister Denis Manturov showed off two other Aurus models ‚Äì Senat sedan and Arsenal minivan ‚Äì to the two presidents. Both serve as part of the Russian president‚Äôs motorcade.
But simply looking wasn‚Äôt enough, as Sisi fully backed Putin‚Äôs idea to take one of the cars on a test drive. They opted for the Aurus sedan and drove around the circuit with the Russian president behind the wheel and his Egyptian counterpart as passenger.
Sisi isn‚Äôt the first foreign leader who got treated with a demo of the Aurus brand. Putin previously showed the Russian cars to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and some other prominent guests ‚Äì but stopped short of actually test-driving them.
The new Aurus SUV, called Komendant, is also expected to be unveiled next year.
The Aurus line (Au/Aurum being Latin for ‚Äògold‚Äô and ‚ÄòRus‚Äô standing for ‚ÄòRussian‚Äô), which is crowned by the armored presidential limousine, has been in development since 2012 as part of a project called Kortezh (motorcade). The cars are expected to enter the market in 2019.

A week before leaving the Trump administration, Nikki Haley spoke to the neocon group - Council for National Policy - lending weight to the prospect of a 2020 candidacy while touting her record as a warmonger‚Äôs warmonger.
including Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway.
The secretive, heavily evangelical CNP has developed a reputation for anointing Republican presidents. Donald Trump and George W. Bush both spoke in front of the CNP before setting out on the campaign trail, and Trump appointed several members to his cabinet in gratitude,
Mercifully, she turned down that first offer, admitting she was completely underqualified to be secretary of state. She had no such qualms about becoming ambassador to the UN, however, even though she told Trump at the time, ‚ÄúHonestly, I don‚Äôt even know what the UN does.‚Äù
Haley revealed that, while she began 2016 as a never-Trumper, a job offer from Trump‚Äôs Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was all she needed to convert to a disciple of the Donald.
She met with him every two months and apparently learned a lot, adopting a form of his ‚Äúmadman theory‚Äù in her diplomatic dealings.
Once inside the halls of power, Haley chose Henry Kissinger as her mentor, the veteran warmonger who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, whose policies resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
Attempting to wring a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù vote from China on sanctions against North Korea, Haley told the Chinese ambassador she was concerned that Trump would invade the recalcitrant nuclear power. He‚Äôs ‚Äúkind of unpredictable, and I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll do,‚Äù she warned.
The audience went wild as Haley touted the US‚Äô withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council as the fulfillment of its ‚Äúduty‚Äù to protect Israel, complaining that the body had condemned the Jewish state dozens of times but had issued only nine such condemnations against her
favorite bogeyman, Iran. The Trump administration‚Äôs relocation of its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem and its cutoff of UNRWA aid to millions of Palestinian refugees also received thunderous applause from the assembled Zionists.
in the face of international condemnation certainly endeared her to big-money GOP donors like Sheldon Adelson.
In light of her CNP speech, Haley‚Äôs rabidly pro-Israel track record looks less like froth-mouthed fanaticism and more like savvy (if still terrifying) politics. The evangelical group is nothing if not pro-Israel, and her tenacious defense of the country‚Äôs alleged war crimes

the Times could simply have been setting the stage for an endorsement of Nikki Haley 2020.

An Alternative for Germany politician is in trouble over a photo of her posing in front of wine bottles featuring Adolf Hitler. The stunt may now cost her a seat in the Berlin parliament.
The infamous ‚ÄòFuhrerwein‚Äô bottles appeared in a post on the social media site ‚ÄòMySpace' that Biessmann says is a decade old.
The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is considering forcing out Jessica Biessmann, a regional lawmaker who posed in front of wine bottles featuring pictures of Adolf Hitler.
The photos show the woman posing on a kitchen counter, while a closer look reveals an array of bottles on a shelf in the background ‚Äì which have pictures of Hitler on them.
The public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, and bottles featuring Hitler cannot be bought in the country. However, they are available for purchase in Italy and a number of other countries, and can easily be delivered to Germany via mail order.
It remains to be seen if Biessmann could face criminal charges apart from being potentially suspended from the party.
and killed by several asylum seekers.
Biessmann herself says she regrets taking the bizarre photos, but claims the flat belonged to a friend of hers living in the eastern city of Chemnitz, according to Berliner Zeitung. Chemnitz recently saw massive far-right rallies after a local was stabbed
The AfD member says she didn‚Äôt notice the bottles in the background at the time the photos were taken. The former car saleswoman and a mother-of-three was elected to Berlin‚Äôs House of Representatives in 2016 and is the parliamentary group‚Äôs family spokeswoman.
Established in 2013, the AfD is no stranger to widespread controversy relating to the darkest part of Germany‚Äôs past. In the most recent example, co-leader Alexander Gauland alleged the Holocaust was ‚Äúa speck of bird shit in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.‚Äù
Other AfD leaders have not minced their words either. Bjoern Hoecke, the AfD leader in Thuringia, had famously called the Holocaust monument in Berlin a ‚Äúmonument of shame in the heart of the capital.‚Äù The AfD considered suspending him from the party but later changed its mind.
The Central Bank of Russia has continued getting rid of US Treasury bonds in August. The share of Russian investments in American debt is getting close to zero.
Russian investments in US securities as of August have fallen to just $14 billion. Back in 2011, Russia was one of the largest holders of US debt with a $180 billion investment.
‚ÄúRussia has almost dropped out of the list of holders of US government debt, being the 54th largest holder.‚Äù
The reason is not only about politics and US sanctions against Russia, a broker at Otkritie bank Timur Nigmatullin told RIA Novosti. The US Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates, which makes American bonds cheaper, he said.

US securities to $1.029 trillion in August, the lowest since October 2011.
The largest investors in US debt, China and Japan, have also cut their holdings. Chinese holdings of US sovereign debt dropped to $1.165 trillion in August, from $1.171 trillion in July, marking the third consecutive month of declines. Japan has slashed its holdings of
The reason for holding money in US bonds is global trade, which is still dominated by the dollar, director of macroeconomic analysis at Expert RA Anton Tabah told Izvestia daily. So, countries are forced to have a lot of dollars in cash, and US bonds are the best option for that.
India and Turkey have followed Russia's lead. Turkey has dropped out of the top-30 list of holders of American debt, while India has been liquidating its investment for five consecutive months to $140 billion in August.

The Russian government is working on the details of a de-dollarization plan announced earlier in October. The program‚Äôs key point is to make it more profitable for key Russian exporters to use rubles instead of dollars.
Exporters will likely get perks like taxation benefits including quicker VAT returns and other stimulus to ditch the greenback.
I hope, the government will soon consider it,‚Äù Russia‚Äôs deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev told Reuters.
The Russian government is specifying the details of the plan that will soon be submitted to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. ‚ÄúThe plan hasn‚Äôt been submitted to the PM yet. We still have disagreements between technical departments, now we will polish them quickly and,
When asked whether the plan would be published after this, Moiseev said: ‚ÄúNo, the plan is for official use only.‚Äù The minister added that Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development and the Central Bank of Russia are working on the details.
The Russian authorities earlier said that the plan does not prohibit the circulation of the US dollar in the country, but includes a number of measures to stimulate the use of national currencies in trade instead of the dollar.
The plan also does not ban loans in dollars for Russians, Moiseev said, but the central bank intends to make dollar loans unprofitable compared to borrowings in ruble.

Queensland, Australia 	A Queensland mother was left covered in large bruises and cuts after she used her body to shield her four-month-old baby from a brutal #hailstorm.
Fiona Simpson was driving to her home in Kingaroy, Queensland with her new baby and grandmother when an extreme storm hit on Thursday. She pulled over when driving conditions got bad, but had no idea just how bad things were going to get.
Simpson soon heard a loud bang and turned around to see what had happened. ‚ÄúAll this rain starts coming in, and the back window where my daughter was was just open ... it's gone,‚Äù she told ABC. The large hailstones had smashed through the window.
Simpson quickly jumped into the backseat and used her body to shelter her baby from the onslaught of large hailstones and rain. ‚ÄúI looked down and I could see she was screaming but I couldn't even hear her, that's how loud it was,‚Äù she said.
Another window in the front of the car soon smashed, and Simpson‚Äôs grandmother was exposed to the violent weather. She was left with one arm that was ‚Äúshredded‚Äù and another that was black with bruising.
When the storm calmed, Simpson drove the car to a nearby house where she called for help. The ordeal left her with large bruises and cuts to much of her body.

Several thousand protesters hit the streets of Pakistan calling for the Christian woman accused of insulting Islam be put to #death. Asia Bibi would become the first person executed for blasphemy if her appeal fails.
The Pakistani city of Lahore was the center of Friday‚Äôs protests, which were organized by the anti-blasphemy party Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP). Demonstrations also took place in a number of other cities across the country, including Karachi and Rawalpindi.
Pakistan, on October 12, 2018. ¬© AFP / Aamir Qureshi	The rallies came after Pakistan's Supreme Court heard the final appeal of Bibi, a Christian laborer accused of blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed in 2009 by Muslim women she was working with in a field.
According to Bibi's autobiography ‚ÄòBlasphemy: A Memoir: Sentenced to Death Over a Cup of Water‚Äô the incident began when she went to retrieve a cup of water from a well during a hot day of fruit picking.
Pakistan. ¬© AFP / Aamir Qureshi	When a Muslim woman nearby saw her doing so she shouted, ‚ÄúDon't drink that water, it's haram (forbidden)!‚Äù She then turned to the other women in the field, telling them that Bibi had dirtied the water in the well by drinking from their cup.
‚ÄúNow the water is unclear and we can't drink it! Because of her!‚Äù the woman said. Several women called Bibi a ‚Äúfilthy Christian‚Äù and told her to convert to Islam.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to convert. I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind? And why should it be me that converts instead of you?‚Äù Bibi said.
At that point, one woman spat on her while another shoved her. Days later, she was accused of blasphemy.
It also said that it had ruled on a petition that would put Bibi on the no-fly list if released, but did not publish that judgment either.
Friday‚Äôs protests came despite the court saying it had reached a judgment at a hearing on Monday, but that it would not be released immediately for ‚Äúreasons to be recorded later.‚Äù
Pope Francis met with Bibi's daughter in 2015.		Although Pakistan's law takes the accusation of blasphemy very seriously and people have been sentenced to death, no one has ever actually been executed.
Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party surround the party's leader during the protest in Lahore. ¬© AFP / Arif Ali	Bibi's case has prompted international calls for her release, with Pope Benedict XVI joining in the calls in 2010.

NASV	KJV 	NIV
3 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
2 this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, ‚ÄúRabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these [a]signs that You do unless God is with him.‚Äù
3 Jesus answered and said to him, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born [b]again he cannot see the kingdom of God.‚Äù
4 Nicodemus *said to Him, ‚ÄúHow can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother‚Äôs womb and be born, can he?‚Äù
5 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‚ÄòYou must be born [c]again.‚Äô
8 The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.‚Äù
9 Nicodemus said to Him, ‚ÄúHow can these things be?‚Äù 10 Jesus answered and said to him, ‚ÄúAre you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?
9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?		10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
John 3:11 New International Version (NIV)		11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.		New International Version (NIV)
11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye (you ) believe not, how shall ye ( you ) believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
Numbers 21:5-9 King James Version (KJV)		5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
6 And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee ( you ); pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
8 And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.		King James Version (KJV)
14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:		15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.		17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.		21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:		13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.		John 1:12,13 KJV
Acts 16:30-31 King James Version (KJV)		30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?		31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.		King James Version (KJV)	Public Domain
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication ( petitioning God ) in the Spirit ( through the Spirit Of Truth ), and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds ( The Apostle Paul is an ambassador for Christ Jesus while at the same time a physical prisoner of the government ) that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
21 But that ye ( you ) also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye ( you ) might know our affairs, and that he might #comfort your hearts.

1 Corinthians 1:18-31 New Living Translation (NLT)		The Wisdom of God	18 The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.
21 Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe.
20 So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world‚Äôs brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish.
22 It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. 23 So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it‚Äôs all nonsense.
24 But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles,[b] Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God‚Äôs weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength.
27 Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.
26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world‚Äôs eyes or powerful or wealthy[c] when #God called you.
28 #God chose things despised by the world,[d] things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important. 29 As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.
30 God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin. 31 Therefore, as the Scriptures say, ‚ÄúIf you want to boast, boast only about the Lord.‚Äù[e]
3 The Lord is slow to get angry, but his power is great,	    and he never lets the guilty go unpunished.	He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm.	    The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.

Both Ramirez and Kavanaugh attended Yale. Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh was heavily intoxicated during the incident.
1. The FBI has reached out to another Kavanaugh #accuser		According to the Washington Post, the FBI has reached out to accuser Deborah Ramirez for an interview. Ramirez alleged in a bombshell New Yorker story that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party at Yale College.
John Clune, the attorney representing #Ramirez, said: ‚ÄúShe has agreed to cooperate with their investigation. Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.‚Äù
details about the lives of people who know each individual.
Kavanaugh, just as he does with Christine Blasey Ford‚Äôs allegations, vehemently denies Ramirez‚Äôs allegations.		It‚Äôs not clear who else the FBI has reached out to. However, people who know both Ford and #Kavanaugh predict the FBI will uncover ugly
‚Äî Leland Keyser and Mark Judge ‚Äî have expressed willingness to cooperate with the FBI‚Äôs investigation.
According to the Post, the FBI has yet to reach out to a third Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnik.		Two of the people who Ford alleges were at the party where she says Kavanaugh assaulted her
The White House counsel‚Äôs office reportedly handed the FBI a specific list of individuals. Absent from that list is Swetnik.
2. The White House has limited the scope of the investigation		According to NBC News, the White House has limited the number of individuals the FBI can interview as part of its #probe.
However, the White House denied ‚Äúmicromanaging‚Äù the FBI‚Äôs investigation.		‚ÄúThe White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do,‚Äù White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said, adding ‚Äúthe scope and duration has been set by the Senate.‚Äù		More from NBC News:
The FBI had no choice but to agree to these terms, the sources told NBC News, because it is conducting the background investigation on behalf of the White House.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter said its not unusual for the White House to set the parameters of an FBI background check for a presidential nominee.
If the FBI learns of others who can corroborate what the existing witnesses are saying, it is not clear whether agents will be able to contact them under the terms laid out by the White House, the two sources briefed on the matter said.
The White House will then share new information with the Senate Judiciary Committee.		It‚Äôs only at that point will each U.S. senator have access to the file.
What happens next?		As the Washington Post explained, the FBI‚Äôs findings will not likely become public. After investigators conclude their probe, they will turn over all relevant information to the White House, where it will be added to Kavanaugh‚Äôs background information file.
However, it‚Äôs the White House that has final say over what is publicly released and what remains sealed.		But there‚Äôs one caveat: The FBI is not coming to a conclusion or recommending a path forward.
They are only gathering information from individuals involved and potential witnesses, recording that information, and turning it over to the White House.

Four Navy officers accused of #sex with a minor, pornography ‚Äì report
A group of petty officers assigned to a US submarine base have been charged with engaging in group sex with a girl younger than 16 and filming it. A criminal investigation was launched after an anonymous tip-off.
the four officers engaged in sexual acts with the girl in barracks at the Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in Washington state. It‚Äôs unclear how the girl, said to be between 12 and 16 years old, was sneaked into the military base.
The incident, reported by the Navy Times on Friday, allegedly took place on September 17, 2017, and had not been made public up until now. According to the charge sheets, obtained by the publication,
The crime was not carried out on the spur of the moment, with investigators saying that the four discussed it in a smoking area before heading for the barracks.
The #orgy took place ‚Äúwith the door open, and with open recording of the group sex using photography and video equipment,‚Äù the charge sheets state.
A criminal investigation was launched by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service after the base authorities received an anonymous tip-off several days later, on September 26.
It took the Navy a year to trawl through evidence and file charges against the suspects, with hearings on the case taking place this week. The hearing officer will decide whether the four men will be court-martialed or tried in a civilian court.
Two of the accused sailors are assigned to USS Nebraska, an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine. One of them is accused of failure to report a crime and engaging in a sexual act with a minor during a three-day period, between September 19 and September 21.
One defendant has been serving at USS Henry M. Jackson, another Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine. He faces charges of making child pornography.
The fourth officer is deployed to the Naval Submarine Support Center Bangor, a former marine base and now a part of the Kitsap-Bangor base.
The base provides support for ballistic missile fleet and nuclear submarines, as well as surface ships.
The scene of the alleged crimes, Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, is the third largest US Navy base and features one of its four nuclear shipyards as well as one of two strategic nuclear weapons facilities.
Ensign Kevin Ortiz also faced the charge of attempting to molest a girl by sending her lewd text messages
Instances of sex crimes involving children are not uncommon among Navy officers. In August, a court-martial trial began for an officer who was accused of four counts of sexual assault of a child between 12 and 16 at Virginia‚Äôs Langley Air Force Base in September last year.
In August, USS Ronald Reagan sailor Gilbert Sandoval was convicted of attempted sexual assault on a child, attempted sexual abuse of a child, attempted production of pornography and related charges. Sandoval was sentenced to three years in jail.
In a recent report by the Pentagon‚Äôs RAND Corporation, Navy ships and training bases were named as carrying the highest risk of sexual misconduct, in particular, to young female service members.

Federal judge: Congressional Democrats can sue #Trump over emoluments	by Caitlin Yilek	 | September 28, 2018 06:15 PM
A lawsuit filed by 200 congressional Democrats alleging President Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign governments can move forward, a federal judge ruled Friday.
The Constitution‚Äôs emoluments clause prohibits presidents from receiving payments from foreign governments, without congressional approval, and was meant to prevent corruption and foreign influence.
Trump‚Äôs hotel just blocks away from the White House has hosted events for foreign governments and visiting officials while he‚Äôs been in office.
The group of Democrats, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., want the court to stop Trump from accepting such payments, or force the president to first get congressional approval.
If Democrats‚Äô allegations are true, then ‚Äúthe president is accepting prohibited foreign emoluments without asking and without receiving a favorable reply from Congress,‚Äù Judge Emmet G. Sullivan wrote in his ruling

‚ÄúWe will increase the number of secure zones in Syria, encompassing the east of the Euphrates,‚Äù Erdogan said in a speech during a visit to New York, Reuters reports.
Earlier this year, Turkey carried out a military operation to seize control of Syria‚Äôs Afrin region from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a terrorist organization. The YPG also controls the Syrian region east of the Euphrates.
Turkey will take action east of the Euphrates river in Syria and impose secure zones as it has done in the northwest of the country, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in comments broadcast on Monday.
Erdogan has in the past warned of new military operations against the YPG along the Syrian border and if necessary into northern Iraq.
Before the Afrin operation, Turkey also carried out a cross-border operation dubbed ‚ÄúEuphrates Shield,‚Äù which targeted both the YPG and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) fighters east of Afrin.
