Most dems don't know what they are voting for. They say they don't believe in abortion they say they want border security they say they are not for socialism but then follow like empty headed idiots dems that say they are for all that and more. Research  before you vote.
If the dems want everyone to be equal then how about no more private schools or free college for their kids. Would AOC let her child go to a public school in Queens New York? How about take your pensions away, cut your wages to what factory workers make. Pay for your own vacays.
I'd like to know why the dems keep saying Trump is just a bully and wants his way. Isn't it the dems trying to change laws of the constitution to fit their way? The dems are trying to change legislation in congress to limit the Presidents abilities. They  force their ideals on us
@caitlinnowens You have just proved that illegals molest and rape children. Out of the 1,308 abuse cases 178 was done by staff which is sick,  the other 1,130 was done within their own. If they rape their young while housed at the border God help us if they go free. Pray for all our children.

@MaryMadsen3 @SenFeinstein I care about border security, not killing babies up to 40 wks. I care when Pelosi wants to spend three billion on illegals but don't care about Americans. Why is it none of you can just talk. If someone disagrees you all start with name calling hateful words. That's a democrat.

@dnwltrs_walters @SenFeinstein If the democrats had any REAL evidence of the slightest they would shout it from the Whitehouse rooftops. Had to do something after killery was disgraced. Lets tie up more taxpayers $. Where are the reports? Been 2 years and still no solid evidence. Why?
@4everManningfan @SenFeinstein Bitch? You haven't seen anything. How about you people put your money where your mouth is. Take up a go fund the immigrants page. If you want open borders then put up your money. Pelosi wants to set aside $3 billion. Take it out of your pocket not mine. Trump 2020.

Do we really want thousands of illegals in our country and not have documents to know who they are? Really?
@realkodybrown Use to watch your show but your such an asshole to all the women. Poor Meri. I hope she gets as far away from you as possible. The girls should do a show about how they got away from you and started their own lives. I'll watch that. Great job with the B&amp;B Meri.
@realDonaldTrump I don't see Pelosi making any kind of compromise. Isn't there a bill you can pass that will impact her and Schumer's paycheck? How about we let a few thousand of those immigrants loose in California and give them the address to Pelosi's mansion. Her doors are open. Right Nancy???
@thehill This has to be a joke. She's nothing but a disaster waiting to happen. Why isn't she being held accountable for her lies?
@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump My question is what is going to happen when the three weeks are up and Pelosi still won't compromise? Her head is so full of herself right now I just don't see her making a deal. She thinks this is a game. If it is then checkmate. Ball is in her court.
@realDonaldTrump You have my vote. Great Job. Build a wall crime will fall. Love it. I support the NRA as well as my whole family.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump As part of that deal we better get that wall or my next vote in 2020 will not be for you. I think your making a fair offer. I guess we will wait and see what happens. The ball is on Pelosi's side of the Democrats court.
@KerryPicket @DailyCaller Her own party is starting to see the truth. Pelosi is so power hungry she can't see the light of day. Now they need to have the balls to stand together and get that bitch out. If she cared she would be in Washington instead of on vacation on the taxpayers dime.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SebGorka This woman says open the government but leaves and lets all those government employees that are out of work continue to struggle. Those are her followers. When are they going to realize she only cares about herself and the power that has gone to her head?
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka She wants a dividend country. Then we all fall.
@RepCheri @HouseDemocrats @senatemajldr Pelosi is running this shit show so do a # democrats shitshow. She could end this right now but but with all these radical democrats behind her making her head swell. The power is to much for her she lost what this is about. Protecting the American people. Period.
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka Stand firm Mr. President. We want the wall. Let Nancy pay for them out of her paycheck. Isn't there something you can do so her and Schumer understand what it's like to do without? Pass a bill that impacts their money.
@realDonaldTrump The Democrats thought it was such a good idea to give all these welfare people their Feb. food stamps early. Most of them sell or trade them for drugs. Now when February does come your going to have all these crackheads with nothing. UNITED WE STAND DIVIDEND WE FALL. Fuck Pelosi.
@FreeBeacon Look at the lying bitch. You democrats keep it up and you'll all be wearing towels on your heads. Where's yours Nancy Pelosi? Get one for cheating Schumer"s wife and mistress to.

@JudgeJeanine I agree. Can you find out where the money is that was set aside when President Bush was in office? Ask Pelosi why we can't use that money? Both parties agreed a wall was needed then.
@realDonaldTrump Why not start a list of who is willing to let the illegals come stay with them. Put up or shut up. You want them here then feed and house them. When all you  woman are wearing towels on your head and bowing down to Allah maybe then you'll see the need for a WALL.
@iamcardib As I have been raped I can answer your question. No person should be violated by anyone. We should all have the freedom to do as we please to a certain extent. That's why we have laws. If we don't build that wall and just let anyone in how can we know what their intentions are?
@realDonaldTrump Ask the Democrats where is the money that was set aside when Bush was in office? What happened to that money? Both parties agreed to it so use that money. The intrest alone should build a wall. Don't back down. Let Nancy and Schumer volunteer their paycheck. Bet they won't.
@realDonaldTrump I wish you would tell Pelosi to go and bring a few of those immigrants to her home and let her take care of them. Does anyone remember when Schumer was busted on the Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss scandal? That shows his character. Don't give in Mr. President. We demand a wall.

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The Democrats are afraid of Pelosi. Schumer is nothing but her puppet. Wasn't he connected to the Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss? Shows his character doesn't it? We want that wall. Nancy is still eating steak while the rest of us go without. She needs to give up her paycheck.
@VP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Tell Pelosi and her people to go to the border and bring a few immigrants home with her. Schumer to. Wasn't he on the Heidi Fleiss Hollywood madam list? Shows his character. Give us the wall. We demand it.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, where is the money that was voted on when Bush was in office? Democrats and Republicans set aside money for a wall that is sitting in a bank somewhere. Pelosi would have have to admit she hates you more than helping the American people. Find the money.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump The question I have is what happened to the money that is already sitting there when Bush was in office? Both Democrats and Republicans voted and passed money for a wall. Wouldn't there be enough in intrest alone to build a wall? Why is that not being brought up?
