Nobody but you has a right to your property, especially not an over-reaching government. Break the indoctrination that breeds the slavish mentality. If this poll is even close to accurate, what a miserably sad state we have fallen into.		https://t.co/i1yKYUpQR2
@SenSanders Promoting jealousy and resentment against our fellow citizens simply because they have been successful is absurd and a sophomoric ploy to divide and conquer. You, Mr. Sanders, are a full-blown authoritarian and your ideas are the antithesis of freedom and liberty.

@CanTanker1962 @krassenstein Also, specify the sanctions you’re talking about. I’m sure you’re incorrectly referring to the sanctions on some private individuals and companies, not “Russia”.
@CanTanker1962 @krassenstein Sanctions are an act of war. Peace is a good thing. Lifting sanctions proves nothing.

@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump Also, don’t forget at this time the Weiner laptop revelation pushed it into the public eye. FBI either addressed it or risked exposure for being in the tank for her.
@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump Please take the time to read the above piece to familiarize yourself with the foundational information supporting these assertions. It’s well worth a read. At very least to attempt to debunk it.
@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump These questions are speculative and irrelevant to the facts at hand. If I had to take a guess, it was to give cover and credence to their ongoing operation and following cover-up. Failure was imminent so they needed the ability to later say, see everyone, we’re not biased at all!

@RepMarkMeadows WOW. @Comey is toast.
@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump NBC is citing the heavily redacted Carter Page FISA. Why hasn’t Carter Page been charged with anything and why is he not apart of Mueller’s coverup investigation if that limited info is legit? The unredacted FISA’s are coming. The world best be ready. #DeclassifyFISA
@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump The Cohen/Prague accusations, now known to be false by all sides, is clearly the cornerstone of the fake Steele dossier. Steele’s claims all fall apart once this fabrication is exposed. The propaganda campaign is over. Time for the #realnews scandal to begin. #Spygate
@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump Wow. The epitome of #fakenews. The footnote was actually who paid for this fake information, the DNC and Clinton. Your generalized claim is not a specific accusation, as the dossier is full of. McCabe states there’d be no FISA’s without the dossier. How could YOU not know this?
@jules_lewis @Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod @realDonaldTrump The key claim underpinning it all is fake...among the others. All so transparent to objective observers. The #Spygate folks will pay dearly for using this dossier to illegally obtain FISA’s and launch this treasonous operation to affect the election.		https://t.co/7QpYqeeWud

@4everNeverTrump @stevenportnoy Let’s also not forget about the #Horowitz #IGReport due out soon. My goodness, what a grand play by Judge Sullivan and Flynn’s team today. Keep the plea on the table long enough to expose #Spygate and destroy Mueller’s cover-up operation. Genius.
@4everNeverTrump @stevenportnoy 3 months sounds like more than enough time to have the Senate settled in place and to #DeclassifyFISA and bring down the whole charade. #SpyGate en route. You mad, bro?
@KenDilanianNBC Jumped the gun on this Tweet now didn’t ya? 😎👍
@AaronBlake @JudgeJeanine That possibility still exists with Sullivan delaying the sentencing and only ordering a "hearing" in 3 months. You should be aware that the unredacted FISA's and the "exculpatory DIA document" that has been withheld will likely be public by then. Game over. #DeclassifyFISA
@DeadlineWH @MSNBC @JoyceWhiteVance @NicolleDWallace Ummm, you're aware that the Judge delayed the sentencing and three months from now there will be hearing, not a sentencing, yes? You couldn't be more #Fakenews here.

@jowr_what @GeorgePapa19 You do realize Carter Page has never been charged with anything, yes? Your premise is dead on arrival. Unreal you provided his highly redacted and uncorroborated FISA to back up your assertions. The declassified FISA’s bring down the house.
@Amy_Siskind Racist/sexist much? Just substitute another race/sex in there to see your logic. Throughout life I like to go with the best candidate for the job and one that shares my principles rather than base decisions on race or sex. Get it?

@jowr_what @GeorgePapa19 Wow. The idea that you think one heavily redacted document showing cherry-picked info to paint a false narrative tells the story is astonishing to me.
@GeorgePapa19 Bingo. They sent their intelligence asset to set you up, brother. #Spygate will be the biggest scandal in American history when the docs drop. #DeclassifyFISA

@chooselife78 @alabony @Minimadden @renato_mariotti @johncardillo Curious Andy’s take as well.
@chooselife78 @alabony @Minimadden @renato_mariotti @johncardillo Of course. The five eyes nations are deeply involved in this. Hence the pull-back on declassifying the fisa applications. Those will reveal what they based this abomination on and what role these “allies” played.
@alabony @Minimadden @renato_mariotti @johncardillo I understand this argument. There is just no evidence that leads me to adhere to it.
@Minimadden @alabony @renato_mariotti @johncardillo Again, the “investigation” began with fabricated information designed solely to give cover and articulable credence to their treasonous operation against the nation and our democratic process.
@alabony @renato_mariotti @johncardillo @Minimadden That does not equate to “collusion” with a presidential campaign, which there has been no evidence of.
@alabony @renato_mariotti @johncardillo @Minimadden Russian interference attempts should be common sense and expected. Every developed nations intelligence agencies has programs designed to interfere in the internal politics of other nations to generate their desired outcomes. No better example of this than our own CIA.
@Minimadden @rob747phil @renato_mariotti @johncardillo Incorrect. Please cite those elements.
@alabony @renato_mariotti @johncardillo @Minimadden Mueller was brought in to keep the narrative of Russian collusion alive and to help cover-up what was done to try to stop Trump’s win. Nobody in the Trump orbit has been charged with a single thing related to Russian collusion and Rod Rosenstein has even stated this publicly.
@Minimadden @rob747phil @renato_mariotti @johncardillo You’re making the assumption the investigation was predicated on real information and not a fake dossier paid for by the opposing candidate. That assumption would be false.
@alabony @renato_mariotti @johncardillo @Minimadden I don’t have a guy. I didn’t vote for Trump. I care only that truth is brought to light, regardless of who that helps or hurts.
@Minimadden @rob747phil @renato_mariotti @johncardillo Please do the research necessary to understand that there is enough publicly available information to state unequivocally this was an operation to ensure Donald Trump was defeated and Hillary Clinton installed as President.
@Minimadden @rob747phil @renato_mariotti @johncardillo The operation preceding the Mueller appointment was an attempted frame-up and is in fact still ongoing as they attempt to cover their tracks. Thankfully, they failed, thus far. #Spygate #DeclassifyFISA
@rob747phil @renato_mariotti @johncardillo @Minimadden You state, “no evidence”, then end with a wild accusation I was taught something by the Kremlin. Oh, the irony. McCarthyism is alive and well.
@renato_mariotti @johncardillo @Minimadden A special counsel based on a transparent propaganda campaign and attempted frame-up of US citizens even existing at all is gross prosecutorial misconduct.

@Heathers1031 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs I remember when America was a nation where you were innocent until PROVEN guilty. You seem to be suggesting it’s now guilty until proven unverified. Do you understand the #policestate implications of your mindset?

@perlmutations Why do you worship the police-state? Your hatred for one man has you blind to everything else.
@ananavarro After two years of blindly and insanely screaming “Russian-collusion” with zero proof, #FakeNews is now pivoting to “interacting”. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@JuddLegum @TrumpsareNazis Hmm, I’d imagine government officials and business people “interact” with people from all nations. McCarthyism much?
@TomSteyer So what you’re actually saying is government needs to force employers to pay whatever arbitrary rate they deem appropriate so that government can then forcibly extract more of employee’s incomes necessary to pay for whatever programs government deems appropriate. Got it. Nope.
@tribelaw 😂 You literally live in an alternate reality echo-chamber. Hilarious.
@AshaRangappa_ FISA court never held a hearing on these targets. Rubber-stamped all the way through. Now Comey claiming he never even read them. The signatories are in for some serious trouble. Fake dossier. Fake justifications. Why people defend the police-state is amazing to me. #FakeNews

@Comey Come on, Jimmy. We know that means you’ll only claim you can’t divulge confidential or classified info in an opening setting. Closed-door means you will be compelled to answer or face contempt/imprisonment. Good try, though. Looking forward to #DeclassifyFISA!#Spygate #Thankful
@ryannicholos @RobertKYarbro @kyledcheney You fundamentally misunderstand what open and closed-door is all about. Look up 👆
@kyledcheney Closed-door means he can not claim confidential or classified information will be divulged when he is compelled to answer. Open public testimony means he will claim he cannot answer due to ongoing investigations or he might divulge confidential or classified info. You know this.

@ananavarro The Saudis financed 9/11. Everyone knows it. Yet, the #fakenews mainstream media, such as yourself, has shrugged it off and ignored it for over 15 years. Why? Your contrived selective outrage is showing.

@SenBobCorker George W. Bush flew out members of the Saudi royal family and the Bin laden family in the days after 9/11. He also covered up the role of Prince Bandar “Bush” in financing the attack. You Sir, are simply an opportunistic liar:		https://t.co/sbvSwVZiIF

@johnkruzel @Brent858 Indeed it should. Especially when she is indicted.
@joshrogin @SecPompeo I agree. However, I’ve yet to hear you come out against the Chinese government, as well as and many others, imprisoning and executing dissidents every single day of the year.  The selective outrage of millions changes daily with each new mainstream media contrived “scandal”.
@PaulaChertok I’m only pointing out facts. Those typically win arguments without much of an effort. Using the term #Fakenews is not propaganda. It is a way to accurately describe the lies and distortions of those putting forth biased and untruthful information under the guise of “journalism”.
@PaulaChertok Point being that one who disregards the Constitution so glaringly clearly has no compass whatsoever to determine if an act is constitutional or not. Yoo should not be cited or held up as one who is credible on such matters. Yet, the Atlantic publishes him. Hence, #FakeNews.
@jdawsey1 Imminent #IGreport and Prosecutor #JohnHuber investigation findings will be exposing #Spygate. Are police-state apologists ready for #DeclassifyFISA?
@grantstern Two years later and not a single piece of evidence of “Russian-collusion”, yet so many gullible people have fallen for the propaganda campaign. This deep-state “insurance policy”, their own words, will be ensnaring many former gov’t officials once #Spygate drops. #DeclassifyFISA

@viaCristiano “Though some may wish that good speech is the best way to drive out bad speech, the harms he perpetrated can’t be dealt with in the marketplace of ideas”. Ban speech we don’t like, because we can’t debate it. The worst kind of authoritarian thought-police mindset. Disgusting.

@MichaelAvenatti Remember when you neglected to afford the innocent until proven guilty standard to Brett Kavanaugh? Understand now why it is so important to base allegations and conclusions on evidence? It appears the Senate Judiciary committee has recommended you be taught this valuable lesson.

@Lawrence @ABC It’s called reporting what was actually said and not injecting #fakenews (for once). Try it, Larry. 😂
@maggieNYT If you want to pretend signing an executive order is dropping it, that is totally your right. I don’t believe executive orders are constitutional at all but it’s almost like you and the Times don’t read your own paper. That, or it’s deliberate #FakeNews.🤔	https://t.co/BviRg55hvU

@jaketapper @CNN Do you think this absolves you and #CNN for spreading #Fakenews on non-existent Russia-collusion and many other fabrications reported simply to stoke fear and hate in weak and suggestible minds? Take responsibility for spreading propaganda.
@MSNBC “#FakeNews media is the true enemy of the people”. Why completely misquote and take out of context what was actually said? That would mean you’re engaging in...#fakenews. Way to prove the point. 😂👍

@Simpson25M @WilDonnelly @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Income is not defined as only “salary”. Are you even serious?
@WilDonnelly @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL My statement was clearly based off of precisely what you stated regarding taxes. Your rebuttal against me is made up from thin air to redirect the conversation. Come at me with a real argument please.
@LakeShow_209 @WilDonnelly @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Tired argument. Study up.
@WilDonnelly @realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL The fact that you think the government owns our income and keeping your own income is “stealing from the government” is very sad. #BrainwashingWorks #TaxationIsTheft #EndTheFed
@Acosta #Fakenews media has led us into Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and on and on, causing incalculable death and destruction worldwide. The #fakenews media, with their deep-state collaborators feeding fake narratives, is indeed the enemy of “the people” and all of humanity. 	@CNN

@davidfrum @Politicon Got your clock cleaned by @dbongino on #Spygate @Politicon. Dude brought his A-game while you and the “moderator” appeared to have no clue about what he was even talking about. Step it up if you’re going to debate in the big leagues. 😎👍
Imagine being the leader of a nation and saying this. “Sorry everyone, my globalist masters said it’s over so it’s over. Nothing I can do about it”. Glad he was proven dead wrong. #Failure https://t.co/7TIrwgWUeq
@travis_view @PhilippeReines You call that trolling? Weak.
@BrianDunning For a “science” writer you sure don’t like to wait for facts, ay?
@Ocasio2018 Why call it “single-payer” when in reality it means “every citizen is the payer”, doubling (at least) everyone’s taxes to pay for it? Just an outright obfuscation to mislead people. It also means eliminating private plans entirely. Please be honest about what this all means.
@SteveWasHereb4 @stevesilberman @MalcolmNance Its about justice. It’s not even about him and your petty surface understanding and failure to face the facts of what actually happened does not negate reality. I was only pointing you there. You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. As I said, best of luck.
@SteveWasHereb4 @stevesilberman @MalcolmNance You’re lost in propaganda, bud. Good luck.
@Rosie I didn’t vote for him, or her, but he was in fact elected to “remake the world order”. Establishment globalism is dead and nation-state self-determination on the rise. “Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations. Entangling alliances with none”. - Thomas Jefferson.

@BruceTeitell @KamalaHarris Please point to a time throughout history when the climate didn’t change. See how that works? Establishment hacks don’t say “global warming” anymore so that no matter what happens you can claim It’s anthropogenic. Absurd. Transparent.
@KamalaHarris Pollution has nothing to do with “climate change”, which is a natural phenomenon. Neither does CO2, which is a beneficial life-giving gas. We should actually address pollution rather than fear-monger. Let me guess, “carbon taxes” to globalist government institutions will save us?
@JackPosobiec Hahaha triggered! Yes! Hysterical.
@abbydphillip @jaketapper You do realize U.S. law enforcement can’t investigate the murder of every other nation’s citizens, yes? How could they possibly function if they did? The alleged crime wasn’t even in a U.S. embassy.
@NBCNews Why isn’t it a “cult-like” movement to keep putting known toxins in the public water supply? Why are those who don’t believe gov’t has the authority to forcibly mass-medicate its citizens the ones being demonized here? If people want toxic fluoride, they can add themselves. 🤔

@Alkaline_Cheese @thehill Not sure who “you people are” but I didn’t vote for Trump or Hillary, nor will I. I just love pointing out #FakeNews and the futility of their rigged polls and projections. Judging by the way the economy is going, you’re not in for a very good November.

@em_az @deborahkherman My god. The idea white supremacists are prevalent in our society is mind-bogglingly dumb. I’m seeing the same people buying this transparent divide-and-conquer race-baiting idiocy are also the same McCarthyites screaming about “Russians” invading every corner of our lives.

@SharylAttkisson Amazing how #fakenews mainstream media journalist’s concern for a “free press” started mid-November 2016. Your case is a perfect example of their hypocrisy and deep-state allegiance.
@kurteichenwald Most objections are to the assault on the principles of free speech. Of course private companies CAN ban and censor. We just don’t think that’s a good precedent to set and see it for what it is, a fascist tactic to silence opposition. Glad to see where you stand.
@ChrisMegerian @kurteichenwald Miss the quotations and explanation that it was an implication made by The NY Times? Also, cooperating with “law enforcement” on an attempted coup based on fake information justifies being called the worst possible name imaginable so your argument is moot.

@CNN Or because he used his position to attempt to rig an election by framing an American citizen. Tick tock.

@CNN Except no one ever questioned it’s authenticity and the tape fell flat, sooooooooo? #Fakenews
@beecrab @Lawrence I do. I don’t support their censorship. You clearly do. End of story.
@beecrab @Lawrence Irrelevant. The conversation is about censorship being unacceptable and having reverence for the principle of free speech, not how you feel about what is being said.
@beecrab @Lawrence Ok. But he doesn’t. Strawman argument. As for libel, if that is true then he can be sued for libel. Has nothing to do with censoring. Give up your non-arguments. You’re for censorship of political opponents. Period.
@beecrab @Lawrence The “private companies” argument is a cover and justification for the selective silencing of those you/they oppose. The principles of free speech should be defended and those who seek to silence others should be called out and shamed.
@beecrab @Lawrence Please explain. No one has muted you.
@MSNBC @KatyTurNBC https://t.co/1kzYb2qiBo
@beecrab @Lawrence Censorship is censorship and unacceptable in all instances. Your feelings on it’s victims are irrelevant.
@beecrab @Lawrence Paying any attention to what Facebook/Google/Apple are up to lately and MSNBC’s boot-licking support of it?
@Lawrence Claiming dog is racist doesn’t make it so. Are you not satisfied with supporting censorship of political opponents? You must also be the authoritarian language-police and claim that definitions for words and the intent surrounding their use is what you deem it to be? Disgusting.
@JohnBrennan Says the guy who is caught red-handed because of his incompetence in organizing a failed election rig and coup attempt. Don’t drop the soap! 😂
@SenSanders Of course, by “free” you mean the cost of tuition stays the same and then increases as it 100% subsidized by extracting yet more $ from the incomes of every American tax-payer. You are 100% economically illiterate and authoritarian. Your plan will fail, as it always has.

@Silence17Dogood @charlietrone2 @kurteichenwald @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews If assault is the case, then charge someone with a crime. If speech becomes threatening, then we are no longer talking free speech. Censoring speech under the guise of sympathy for grieving families is an intolerable abuse of tragedy. No need to invent or test arguments here.
@Acosta @colbertlateshow @StephenAtHome It’s almost like you’re talking yourself into believing you’re not #FakeNews.
@Silence17Dogood @kurteichenwald @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews Not sure why you’re involving me in arguments I am not making. I’m saying that Kurt/Facebook/Apple/Google et al. promoting censorship is abhorrent. That is all. Of course, they CAN do it. My argument is the principles of free speech are much more important than their biases.
@MZHemingway The amount of strawmen I am seeing puts the Midwest to shame.
@Silence17Dogood @kurteichenwald @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews Sadly, your straw man argument is irrelevant. Upholding the principles of free speech can be discussed absent the first amendment/government. The “private company” argument is a cover for people who love the idea of censoring their political opponents. Better luck next time.
@kurteichenwald @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews You love censorship, eh? Thankfully, you don’t make the rules around free speech.
@AndrewFeinberg @sjkl333x Aside from those things that you mention, which are matters of opinion regarding specific events/issues, philosophically, the folks at @infowars do not believe in globalism and centralized planning or state-control of our economy. That is the answer.

@SirGoldenrod @CNN @CNNOpinion Weird how they all banned Infowars and Alex Jones on the same day. As if it was a calculated and coordinated effort to censor one organization and man specifically. 🤔
@SirGoldenrod @CNN @CNNOpinion You admit it. At least you’re capable of seeing where you’re wrong.
@DarthSkyWrecker @eugenegu @RealAlexJones Without the unnecessary and revealing ad hominem attack, you just described support for censorship. Good luck with that. Hint: it never ends as the imposers and supporters intend it to.
@SirGoldenrod @CNN @CNNOpinion Do you remember the exact moment you started hating free speech and loving corporate-monopoly control of it?
@SirGoldenrod @CNN @CNNOpinion 1) A lawsuit proves nothing. 2) This is bigger than Alex Jones or Infowars. 3) You’re defending censorship?
@DarthSkyWrecker @eugenegu @RealAlexJones Please validate your support of censorship.
@DarthSkyWrecker @eugenegu @RealAlexJones It’s sad you, and apparently many others, agree with censoring those with differing political opinions than your own and then attempt to justify it. That is all.

@realDonaldTrump Washington Post is openly Operation Mockingbird. Deep-state funded and controlled. It’s not even debatable. $600 million buys a lot of propaganda.	https://t.co/vj13HiepCO

@dznyc @RandPaul Haha the race card again? Have anything other than identity politics to work with? Exhausting.
@keithlaw @Cernovich There are scientific facts and studies disputing their safety. Don’t let that get in the way of your point though.
@nycDSA Hahaha, wait, you’re serious? How’d you buy the supplies you used for this protest? Did. someone. profit?

@realDonaldTrump Transparently obvious. Declassify the records. IG report on this one going to be lots of fun!
@cameraman1961 @cspan @JusticeOIG @GOPoversight @OversightDems @HouseJudiciary @cspanradio You mean a real hearing on now fully documented and irrefutable corruption at the highest levels of government? Yes, it is for real. Give the IG report a read. He was appointed by Obama, as you surely know.

@Capt_PirateFace @NOFXband #BanNOFX? Shut your fascist mouth. There will be no banning of things because you hate free speech.
@NOFXband Caught you guys in Brockton. Your festival and beer is outstanding. Now get the fuck out there and launch a nationwide “Fuck Your Feelings” tour! It’s the only way forward.

@itsweezie @realDonaldTrump Look at real pic. Photoshop. You got played fool.
@piersmorgan Straw-man argument. No one is calling to arm everyone with anything. People are calling for Americans to be able to exercise their 2nd amendment right to defend themselves should they choose to carry. But you already knew that and chose to obfuscate the issue, per usual.

@MegMcPartland @mdornic @piersmorgan @PiersTonight A 4 person "rally"?  What do u call 6 people, a riot?
@piersmorgan Wonder if he was also on mind-altering antidepressants like all the other mass shooters.  u REALLY don't like to mention that.
@aprilmacie how "trendy" and "cool" and "liberal" to advocate torture.  You must love Obama's drones&amp;wars committing daily Sandy Hooks huh?
@RealAlexJones @piersmorgan would rather be "edifying" and talk about killing you on his abysmally rated show.  AJ gave Piers ratings 4 once
@piersmorgan Did he tell you over breakfast in bed this morning?
@earldean71 @emilysteel @piersmorgan Wikipedia surfer ay?  Traditional conservative, aka not neo-con.  Constitutionalist, aka real conserva.
@earldean71 @emilysteel @piersmorgan  Oh he's not "conservative" to u?  If only he supported torture, endless war, bailouts etc. then maybe.
@caitastrophe I'M BAAAACK!
@piersmorgan you should accept @RealAlexJones debate challenge.  Or would you just rather be "edifying" and talk about shooting him on TV?
@sullydish Tips on civility from yourself, a "journalist" lapdog of a President that commits daily SandyHooks with drones, is a joke.
