as everyone works to craft a unique legislative package to save our pensions and our Commonwealth.  	12/13
In the coming weeks, I will continue to speak with Governor Bevin‚Äôs administration and the General Assembly	11/13
It is also important that we have a deeper commitment to realistic assumptions and requirements for full funding each year.	10/13
It is clear we need structural reforms to stop the bleeding.  	9/13
But new leadership in Frankfort is committed to tackling the problem head-on. 	8/13
Previous elected officials failed our public employees, retirees,  &amp; all citizens,	7/13
impacting dollars that go to classrooms, roads, health care, and other key services.		6/13
&amp; our unfunded liabilities are beginning to swallow a greater and greater share of our state spending,		5/13

If citizens visit https://t.co/UbizyAJyFd, they can view 5 of the major causes of our crisis.		3/13
