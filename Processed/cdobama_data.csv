It would be pointless for the President to read all of the bills before they are up for legislation.

That is the only reason he hasn't had as much as he would like done. That's not his fault.  And every president since Nixon except Bush Jr has wanted to pass a healthcare bill. Every single one. Obama has been the only President able to, and that in itself is going to put him on par with some great presidents.

It takes the same ignorance to say that the recession of 1920 had nothing to do with the war ending and establishment of the Federal Reserve, etc. as it does to not realize the previous administration's contribution to our current economic predicament.  ""On March 4, 1921 President Harding assumed office while the nation was in the midst of a postwar economic decline, known as the Depression of 1920-21. By summer of his first year in office, after a series of actions by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, an economic recovery was underway.  After the recession , starting in 1922, Harding cut taxes. The top marginal rate was reduced annually in four stages from 73% in 1921 to 25% in 1925. Taxes were cut for lower incomes starting in 1923. Despite these policies, the economy entered recession in May 1923 and remained in recession into the next presidency, through July 1924. Thomas E. Woods, however, contends in the Fall 2009 issue of The International Review, that the tax cuts implemented by President Harding ended the Depression of 1920-21 and were responsible for creating a decade-long expansion. In fact, there were three recessions in the 1920s prior to the Great Depression and the rate of recovery was slower than during the Great Depression.""

Links:  1  &  2   I liked your second article more, it seemed less biased, and it did raise two good points. First of all, Obama is supposed to spend more in a recession, government spending should counter the business cycle. Bush had no real reason to continue the deficit in the way that he should have, whilst Obama had the biggest recession in modern history. To get back to your original point, of how Obama has increased debt more than any other president, I was simply pointing out that it's hardly a fair comparison.  Second of all, Obama's tried to increase tax on the upper classes, and the corporations, and been blocked by Republicans. Again, it's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever' when the results you are using against him are not of his own making.  But, as I said originally, I don't think Obama deserves all of the love that he gets from the 'Left'/liberals/democrats, whatever you want to call them. He is currently the best of a bad lot. I remember looking through the official comparisons of the various candidates economic projections, and yes, it is true that Ron Pauls cut the deficit most quickly, and therefore debt, but it did so at the expense of the economy. The Libertarians look to 'save' the economy, but at the expense of the people who it is supposed to help, and this is where I feel that Obama does well, and the Republicans do neither.

Considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue, I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.

In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive. And I have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom, such as Bush did, the second highest debt creator.   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.   The war was his choice to enter, and considering the flaky reasons for it, I do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost. Considering the US' abysmal foreign aid (as a percentage of national income) history, its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money.   Obama supports the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.    He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include ""other extensions of relief that were also set to expire."" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that ""there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,"" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. ""That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,"" he said. ""And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.""   But yes, I'll concede, I wasn't aware of that. However, considering the whole Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession (yes, he designed Bush's budget too). Considering the widespread criticism of his plan, I would hesitate before supporting it, yet alone attaching such massive claims to it.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold.   This is what annoys me about Ron Paul. Some of his policies are fantastic, ending the war on drugs/terror, all that bullshit, but at the same time, he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall. But, that's unrelated.   How are they hurting the people it ""helps"".   Social support is supposed to help those who need it the most. Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.

All of this at the expense of small businesses that try to compete with large businesses in a heavily regulated market.

Ron Paul and other Libertarian thinkers believe that individuals benefit the most when they have choice over what to do with their own property.   Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.   Is this why welfare reform resulted in economic prosperity? Is this why FDR almost made the Depression worse until the War started?  If there is any kind of spending that has ever helped economy and the prosperity of citizens it has historically been Military Spending. Yet that is one of the MANY things that government has boosted its spending in, and even so, just because military has been successful in the past doesn't mean that it's the only way.   Even so, helping those who truly can't help themselves is still a small portion of government spending.  edit: The Soviet Union had industrial progression, but this was also, technically, military spending. As for their agriculture, 27% of the food provided for the people was from private farm owners, even though they took up 1% of the total agricultural community of Russia.  Historically, as we see, overall wealth goes up with privatization, no with government welfare.  I agree that some welfare may still be necessary for those who need it most, but at the rate it is now (and how both Obama and Romney want to continue it) is not going to help increase the standard of living.

False. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were irresponsible in their rewards to banks that did the wrong thing. Subsidization and inflation encouraged the banks even more to give out money to poor people who can't afford to give it back. The housing market regulators focused more on pushing ideological goals than thinking about what could actually profit the housing market. In fact, the housing market was encouraged, by government regulators, to over-supply and care little for their expenses (after all, they were being subsidized to an atomic level). Bush should have gotten government COMPLETELY out of the housing market. However, this wasn't the case, and folks like  Ron Paul  knew this would happen.   but that doesn't mean it was a good thing overall.   Clearly Bush should have listened to  Ron Paul  instead of the ideologues pushing for bigger government.   necessary and justified.   based on the assertions of Catholic Bishops?  They complain more about the subsidies going to farmers, which is, of course, wrong. However, Obama is not eliminating subsidies, as Ron Paul or Gary Johnson would.

Just to make you happy, I don't really like Obama that much, he's failed in a lot of aspects that I thought he'd do better, drones in Pakistan and others, hasn't pushed Republicans far enough to help the economy, and hasn't done shit to stop everything with Iran. I also remember watching a 2008 video of him speaking for ending the war on weed, yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard. I just don't like people calling him the devil, because he isn't.   Money isn't spent on less taxing. that just means there is less money to spend.   Debt is created by a deficit. Less taxing means more debt.   And increased welfare spending is not the answer, as LBJ and Nixon have shown. Instead, proposals by Bill Clinton, JFK, and Reagan have gotten more people off of government dependence and more independent, as well as leaving room for the private sector to increase wealth for all Americans (as it historically does).   Increased welfare spending was mandatory, it takes years to change the systems, and as far as I'm aware, it largely falls outside of his mandate (state law, not federal, I'd assume?).   If the bad lot doesn't include Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, both for completely ending the turmoil in the Middle East, you'd be right.

Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common, with people not being held responsible for their actions.

Less taxing means more debt.   But it is not spending, which actually creates debt. Taxing is unnecessary to continue spending. Government will spend as much as it wants and will tax people as much as they want. We can't just say ""increase taxes to reduce debt"" when the debt could have been avoided all together. Once again, it's a red herring.   it largely falls outside of his mandate   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?  Bill Clinton, however, signed welfare reform. This was a Federal act.   I like this part of them, but disagree with others   yet you're not specific on how their economics will hurt anyone. You've avoided pointing to specific, first saying ""welfare is necessary"" and then saying ""well, Obama has no control over welfare.""  Now, economics may not be your strong suit (it was once something i hardly considered), but if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views, you should be more specific on what is wrong with them.   Regardless, he's making an effort, and being blocked off, for no real reason   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule, even though I already described how the Buffet rule is a ""red herring.""   You wish to completely deregulate the banks?   It's about getting government away from the banks all together. The banks, how they currently operate, could not survive without government involvement. They rely on subsidies, standardized currency, human controlled inflation and regulation to keep themselves in power. Without it they would hold little power over our wealth and currency. Currently, the banks dictate most money powers. They will continue to dictate as long as government stays involved with the affairs of the banks. This isn't about letting the large trample the small, it's about removing the power-source for this monstrosity that government created in the first place. Big government is the problem here, not lack of it.   bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country.   A bank without government would NEED to operate in the interest of the consumers or else it will attract none. Currently people feel that they need banks. While the privatization of banks seemed like a good idea during the transitional period between Centralized and non-centralized banks, what ended up happening was government assisted greedy men. You can not expect the private sector to do what it does best if government is still involved, as it always has been. The banks are protected from competitive currency because they hold all currency rights. The banks are paid by governments to continue being banks, which removes most financial liability (especially when you're large enough to ""need"" a bailout). And the banks are encouraged by leaders (government bureaucrats like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) to make poor decisions but given money to make up for those poor decisions. This isn't some magical imbecile who happens to be running a bank, this is a guy basically being given money to make poor decisions with all of our money. It was inevitable with government involvement, as Ron Paul accurately predicted.   Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common,   Not if you eliminate government involvement in the banking market.   I was simply using them as an example.   A terrible one.   I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.

I brought it up to say that he was forced to pay more, it was mandatory.   But if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views   In the simplest of terms, an economic system is simply nothing more than a system of allocation of resources, goods, and services. Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something. As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions. Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market. Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities. Leaving them open to abuse by the rich is not what I think should happen, and that is what Libertarians would do - leave everyone to the benefits, and abuse, that others put on them through trade.  I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.

Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement. They simply speculated, loaned out money, told everyone it was going fine, had massive rates of leverage, and then it all fell to shit.  So no, I don't agree that deregulating the banks is a good idea, either economically, or from a humanitarian sense (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people. They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   A terrible one.   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.  But in all honesty, I haven't read around it too much, and don't have time to do so now, however, it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.

66	obama	B	19	13	-1	oppose	ThePyg	ThePyg	"then are you saying that taxation doesn't matter?   It's more about the tyranny behind taxation. In the terrible shit-storm that government has created thus far, it is almost impossible to eliminate most taxes today. However, we should be progressing past the need for taxation all together. Create a new system dependent on proper justification for spending and taxation (if necessary).  The taxes today are irresponsible and incomprehensible by average Americans. Many people have to pay someone just so they don't accidentally miss any payments. The tax bracket is better now than it has been at times, but it is unrealistic. Taxes on Capital Gains are basically taxing the same income twice.  Taxes for subsidizing wheat and corn, and products made by wheat and corn are taxed. Most states have sales tax asking that people pay the government if they wish to buy an item. Taxes on property, saying that you can't even have shelter without paying the government.  This is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil. The idea that an authority figure can charge you for buying something from someone else is kind of ridiculous, yet it is currently the case.  So it's not so wise to just say ""yeah, taxes should go up because what about the debt?"" The debt is from irresponsible spending from the government. The government is now asking us to pay for their mistakes. Furnishings that don't even benefit most of us. TJ called this shit tyrannical for a reason.   Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something.   The number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government. Higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate. People do not end their pursuit of profit just because government has made things more expensive for them. They will simply pass the expenses unto the consumer, as we have seen with the healthcare and agricultural businesses.   As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions.   As shown, historically (as I've pointed out a few times already), private endeavors succeed far more in spreading wealth across the nation than public efforts. This is because government has no concern for efficiency. While welfare and social services may be for noble reasons, they have been unsuccessful in getting people out of the slums. Allowing businesses to operate unrestricted creates growth. More goods and services are provided at a cheaper rate because the business men want to make these items cheaply. They don't want expensive items. Expensive items mean less consumers.  As well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically). It goes all the way back to the bourgeoisie and we see it today with the monopolies created solely by government. The largest of corporations owe most of their strength to government regulations and restrictions that have hurt small business, subsidization and contracts that has chosen winners, and ridiculous business taxes that small businesses couldn't keep up with.   Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market.   The ""corporatist"" legislation includes major regulations on the market. Government should not have the power to put such restrictions on individuals, yet we give it that power by claims of non-trust for the free market. Free markets is very far from corporatism.   Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities.   Even if we look to a futuristic utopia where the Free Market has prevailed over tyrannical government, government's place will still be to provide basic needs (security, vouchers for food and healthcare) at a much cheaper and efficient rate. However, government currently is a bureaucratic mess and the only defense that people can have for it all is the fear of an alternative that has never done harm (in fact, 'regression' towards free markets has done wonders for the economies of the USSR and China).  Vouchers (like food stamps, or the Paul Ryan healthcare plan) are cheaper and allow the market to do what it does best, compete for customers. It's a system of welfare that is efficient and I have no problem with it. That is currently, however, not what government does.   I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Hardly. The expense of most food industries comes from heavy regulation and taxation. One is not allowed to sell food without going through months of expensive protocol. How can a poor person in a poor neighborhood afford to do that or keep up with all business regulations and fees? This is what impoverishes the people the most.  A neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them.   I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes   as explained, the Buffet Rule is a ""red herring.""   The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession.   Way to leave out the most important part. When the recession was occurring, the Icelandic government PANICKED and made drastic action believing that the banks wouldn't be able to handle the downfall of the European Union's dollar (the EU had much to do with this, sir). Iceland surrendered ownership of their banks to government regulators and this is where all hell broke loose. Now, the development of the banks was already a fault of government, as government, as I explained before, should have NOTHING TO DO with the banks. No start up help, no subsidies, no regulations, no nothing. Iceland would not have been able to invest so much power into three banks if they had completely avoided that market. As I've stated, it is better to either have a Centralized bank or no government involvement with banks at all. I'd choose the latter, especially today, because of the great catastrophe government has created in the banking and currency systems.   Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement   If government had stayed out of it all along, none of this would have been an issue. Iceland would have been one of the countries to avoid the mess that the EU and US created with their meddling in the private sector.   (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people.   The regulators of the Fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed.   They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   With a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please? Is it government's role to build up such monstrous corporations only to try and tame them and make them take care of us poor folk who need a nanny state? I find it quite shaky when we say ""hey Frankenstein, make us one of them monsters to push us around.""   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.   And I don't trust them as economic advisers. For good reason, it's not very good to give the religious a voice in politics. But that's just my opinion.   it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.   Sure, but saying that still doesn't make a difference in what we're talking about.

68	obama	B	21	13	-1	oppose	ThePyg	ThePyg	"in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important.   Bill Clinton had a different view on things. It was about having taxes that can match the spending. However, if spending is out of control, increasing taxes doesn't help. this is why Clinton cut spending so much that taxes could actually be cut instead of needing any raise, while still having an annual surplus.   My issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me.   You're ignoring some of my points on a voucher program, but even so, it makes little sense to reward others for doing nothing. As well, as explained, government services provide a lot less to the public than private services. This is simply because pursuit of wealth increases overall wealth. People have more in Capitalistic countries than in Collectivist countries. This is what the USSR witnessed when they privatized more industries, and this was the BIGGEST realization for China as they went from Communist to practically Laissez-Faire economics.     Obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that I like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality.   Socialistic policies do not increase the amount of goods and services available to people (unless you include Militaristic policies that have been the only historical instance where massive government spending has actually benefited the citizens in in their wants). Food and clean water supply goes up with private industries' efforts to make more money. Consumers want goods and services, private forces provide them.  If you're worried about the poor, a voucher program (that would cut down spending and regulation greatly) would benefit them far more than a public service. Vouchers would give them the ability to choose at little to no cost to themselves. However, socialistic policies of government services and regulation only make things harder for the poor.   Remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (Scandanavian ones come to mind).   I've given my explanation on Scandanavia and PrayerFails has given a different but also effective one as well. Wealth equality doesn't mean jack shit if the overall wealth is still low.   The Ryan plan calls for little reform   The current Ryan plan is to appeal to the Mainstream Democrats who hated his voucher program for healthcare.   over-regulation is one of them   general regulation does this. Unless you mean regulation ONLY in rich neighborhoods...    The housing market crashed because of banks, CDO's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers.   It came from government incentives to ""look out for the poor"" who were actually the risky loans. It came from government taxes on businesses that didn't make these high risks.    Out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them?   I feel that you completely ignored my points that regulators should have no say in any of the business of the banks, and that general government should give absolutely no rewards to banks for any reasons. No subsidies, no tax incentives, no regulation, no interest fondling, and no bail-outs. Government should view banks as another business and should have no concern for them. This will remove their power over all of us who depend greatly on government currency yet require private industries to provide us with this government provision.   Funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same.   Explain.   I trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately.   Why? forgive me, but this may just be my issue with debate in general, when others look to their pastors and school teachers as experts on very complex issues (especially to justify the surrendering of liberty for the sake of security that has never been shown to exist or be successful).   but the commentary they provide is not worthless.   To you, maybe. To me, it is very worthless.

LNG is used in energy production, as well as in some cars, and its demand & price fluctuates much less than oil does. For example, Qatar produces over 95% of UK oil, and demand is only predicted to increase. They've made attempts to diversify their income (they've learnt from Dubai), and have one of the biggest banking sectors in the region, and huge infrastructure plans.  They also allow a free market to a reasonable extent - both Shell and Exxon make billions there, and there is a significant number of foreign companies in the country.

However, an entire social and economic system to be dependent on government exports is kind of the point that I was making. Qatar has to run itself like a business to keep its employees (citizens) happy and working for the government. And it is not a free market just because it pulls in Capital (Hitler pulled in Capital but delegated most of the citizens to work for militarist goals).  Shell and Exxon make billions because of Globalization. Not because Qatar allows ""free markets.""  And the social aspect has much to do with with my justification for little (not no) government. A social system with a terrible economic system is not a good social system. People will have little access to goods and services of better quality if the private sector is limited and heavily regulated. As explained in my many posts before, overall wealth goes up with the pursuits of the private sector. This has been evident in transitional periods for the Soviet Union and China, which portray the greatest examples of binaries in their economics.  Society benefits when they are free to trade with each other and when they are free to compete for consumers. When free trade is restricted, people will never be able to get the goods and services that they need (unless you restrict the population itself).

Considering that he started off with a budget surplus, I hardly consider this a good record.  Then, you look at Obama. He's cut back on military spending, partially through removing troops from around the world (saving lives), as well as through straight cuts. In his first year, spending fell - overall spending growth in 4 years is lower than the inflation rate (0.4%). Obama is spending essentially the same amount as Bush did at the end of his presidency. However, due to a fucked economy, tax revenues have fallen massively, and government non-discretionary spending has risen (due to increased welfare payments).  So no, that's patently wrong.

Our country is in worse shape that when he was elected and the fact that he is backing down on virtually all of his promises and policies should tell you something isn't working.   First, what do you mean by worse shape? And of the criteria, that you use to establish this ""worse shape"", how much of it can Obama be legitimately blamed for?  Second, Obama has kept just under 130 (an additional 40 kept with compromise) (and just under 230 in the works) of his ~500 recorded campaign promises in the first two full years of his Presidency. That's not such a horrible pace that we should all abhor his legislative and other Presidential activities. But what promises did he break and what policies has he backed down from that you would have really liked to see him keep?   We don't need progress. We need principles.   A completely nebulous and possibly useless slogan.

Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?  2. Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually  shrinking  the size of government.  3.

That more of the unemployed begin again to look for work, and so are again counted in the percentage of unemployed - keeping the numbers aproximately the same, in no way negates that jobs were created - it just means we have a messed up way of counting unemployment rates. You can thank Regan for that by the way, one of the many tricks his corporate overlords used to pad Regan's scores while he acted like a President.  And the point is not that jobs had been created every month, I just mentioned that new numbers were in for January.

Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?   Cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession, its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about.   2.  Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually shrinking the size of government.   $82.69 billion dollar deficits this April, though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls.   3.

Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Keynesian economics: Fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run.   5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.  I oppose the war, but I'll give him credit for recent success.   And here's a list of things Obama has done, some may not agree with everything, but at least he isn't at Camp David or reading to Kindergartners on the tax payer's dime:   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending   Trying to make agencies more efficient is not a new concept.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   See above.  1.Instituted enforcement for equal pay for women  I'll give him credit... though if women are to except maternity leave then they ought to expect lesser pay.   1.Beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq  Good.   1.Families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at Dover AFB   McCain would have likely done something similar.   1.Ended media blackout on war casualties; reporting full information   Seeing as every tv station not named Fox is in the tank for him this is not much of accomplishment.   1.Ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to Dover AFB; the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier's family  Good.   1.The White House and federal government are respecting the Freedom of Information Act   Until what goes on behind closed doors with the Federal Reserve and Obama's negotiations with Unions and Democrats this is not much of an accomplishment.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   Really? They are counting this as an accomplishment?  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  I like this one.  1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  There are still loop holes but if this policy works I'll give him credit.   1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date   McCain might have done something like this, but I'll give Obama credit.  1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research   1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   I don't mind stem-cell research, but tax payers should not pay for it.    1.New federal funding for science and research labs   Not their job to do so.  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  I would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to.  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect   1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   Not government's job.   1.New funds for school construction   Not government's job, the schools still suck anyways.    1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out   This one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a PR move. If he wants to change the prison's policies then that is one thing, but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid.    1.US Auto industry rescue plan   Propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment.    1.Housing rescue plan   He still needs to fix Fannie and Freddie.   1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan   The tax cut parts were good, the rest not so much.   1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying   1.US financial and banking rescue plan   Not government's job.  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy; the US now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the Geneva Convention standards  Good   1.Better body armor is now being provided to our troops   McCain would have done the same.  1.The missile defense program is being cut by $1.4 billion in 2010  Good.   1.Restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure/protocols   New policy with new president, nothing special.  1.Reengaged in the treaties/agreements to protect the Antarctic  Protect it from what?   1.Reengaged in the agreements/talks on global warming and greenhouse gas emissions   More bull shit regulations from self righteous environmentalists.    1.Visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office   And now they like us more... so what?    1.Successful release of US captain held by Somali pirates; authorized the SEALS to do their job   Do you really think that a Republican would have hesitated to have the SEALS do their job?   1.US Navy increasing patrols off Somali coast   Do you really think that a Republican would have hesitated to increased military presence?    1.Attractive tax write-offs for those who buy hybrid automobiles   Preferential treatment to his environmental followers is not an accomplishment.    1.Cash for clunkers program offers vouchers to trade in fuel inefficient, polluting old cars for new cars; stimulated auto sales   Not the government's job, no way to pay for the program, Japan automakers love us now.  1.Announced plans to purchase fuel efficient American-made fleet for the federal government   1.Expanded the SCHIP program to cover health care for 4 million more children   Not government's job.   1.Signed national service legislation; expanded national youth service program   Not government's job.   1.Instituted a new policy on Cuba, allowing Cuban families to return home to visit loved ones   He could just lift the ban on Cuba altogether seeing as it hurts the Cuban people more then it hurts their government.    1.Ended the previous policy of not regulating and labeling carbon dioxide emissions   Not government's job.   1.Expanding vaccination programs   And wasting millions in the process on unused vaccines.    1.Immediate and efficient response to the floods in North Dakota and other natural disasters   MSNBC was criticizing the government for not doing anything, enforcing something like this after you are chewed out is not an accomplishment.   1.Closed offshore tax safe havens  Good.  1.Negotiated deal with Swiss banks to permit US government to gain access to records of tax evaders and criminals  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy of offering tax benefits to corporations who outsource American jobs; the new policy is to promote in-sourcing to bring jobs back  Good.  1.Ended the previous practice of protecting credit card companies; in place of it are new consumer protections from credit card industry's predatory practices  Good.   1.Energy producing plants must begin preparing to produce 15% of their energy from renewable sources   Not government's job.   1.Lower drug costs for seniors   Not government's job.  1.Ended the previous practice of forbidding Medicare from negotiating with drug manufacturers for cheaper drugs; the federal government is now realizing hundreds of millions in savings  Good   1.Increasing pay and benefits for military personnel   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Improved housing for military personnel   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Initiating a new policy to promote federal hiring of military spouses   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Improved conditions at Walter Reed Military Hospital and other military hospitals   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Increasing student loans   Not government's job, not only that but they have failed to address growing tuition costs which negates the benefits of increasing loans.  1.Increasing opportunities in AmeriCorps program  Ehhh, sure, I like this one.  1.Sent envoys to Middle East and other parts of the world that had been neglected for years; reengaging in multilateral and bilateral talks and diplomacy  Good   1.Established a new cyber security office   And now he wants the government to be able to take control of the internet in case of ""emergency"".   1.Beginning the process of reforming and restructuring the military 20 years after the Cold War to a more modern fighting force; this includes new procurement policies, increasing size of military, new technology and cyber units and operations, etc.   New president, new policy.   1.Ended previous policy of awarding no-bid defense contracts  Good   1.Ordered a review of hurricane and natural disaster preparedness   Sounds like something any president would do.   1.Established a National Performance Officer charged with saving the federal government money and making federal operations more efficient    1.Students struggling to make college loan payments can have their loans refinanced   Not government's job, if they really gave a shit then they would have fixed the problem of the rising costs of college, but seeing as the left is in love with academia I doubt that will happen.   1.Improving benefits for veterans   McCain.   1.Many more press conferences and town halls and much more media access than previous administration   Narcissism is not an accomplishment.   1.Instituted a new focus on mortgage fraud  Good.   1.The FDA is now regulating tobacco   Increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment.    1.Ended previous policy of cutting the FDA and circumventing FDA rules   Increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment.  1.Ended previous practice of having White House aides rewrite scientific and environmental rules, regulations, and reports  Good.   1.Authorized discussions with North Korea and private mission by Pres. Bill Clinton to secure the release of two Americans held in prisons   The reporters were not worth the costs.   1.Authorized discussions with Myanmar and mission by Sen. Jim Web to secure the release of an American held captive   Not worth the costs.  1.Making more loans available to small businesses  1.Established independent commission to make recommendations on slowing the costs of Medicare  Good.   1.Appointment of first Latina to the Supreme Court   I thought race did not matter to the left? Anyways, he appointed some bitch that he knew would agree with him on most issues, that is not an accomplishment that is politicizing the court, though that is nothing new.   1.Authorized construction/opening of additional health centers to care for veterans   McCain.   1.Limited salaries of senior White House aides; cut to $100,000   They should be making a lot less.   1.Renewed loan guarantees for Israel   Fuck Israel.   1.Changed the failing/status quo military command in Afghanistan   New president, new policy.   1.Deployed additional troops to Afghanistan   McCain.  1.New Afghan War policy that limits aerial bombing and prioritizes aid, development of infrastructure, diplomacy, and good government practices by Afghans  New president, new policy, but since this a really good policy I'll give him credit.  1.Announced the long-term development of a national energy grid with renewable sources and cleaner, efficient energy production   1.Returned money authorized for refurbishment of White House offices and   private living quarters   PR move.   1.Paid for redecoration of White House living quarters out of his own pocket   Really? Kos included this with accomplishments.    1.Held first Seder in White House   He threw a Jewish party? That's an accomplishment?  1.Attempting to reform the nation's healthcare system which is the most expensive in the world yet leaves almost 50 million without health insurance and millions more under insured  Already listed.   1.Has put the ball in play for comprehensive immigration reform   States are passing their own laws because they are tired of inaction at federal level.   1.Has announced his intention to push for energy reform   I wasn't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment. And since this is the Kos what they mean by ""reform"" is cap and trade that will cause electricity costs to sky rocket while at the same time allowing large companies to continue to pollute as long as they are willing to buy credits.   1.Has announced his intention to push for education reform   I wasn't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment.

Check, I'm aware that Cap and Trade is still technically alive, but seeing as it is pretty much dead and watered down I think it might be safe to consider this a failure.      Granted, some of these points might be a bit weak and I'm well aware that he has been able to get some leftest bills passed that have not gotten much coverage. But honestly, will the rest of his term really matter? It's become rather clear that the majorities that the Dems hold in Congress are going to be widdled down if not flat out erased come November, so any major legislation that he wants to get passed will have to be done right now. He has Congress busy with the Wall Street ""reform"" bill, but that thing is getting wattered down to the point where it is looking more like a PR stunt rather than actual legislation.   There is always the possibility of Obama becoming more pragmatic with the Republicans during the second half of his term like Clinton was in the 90's, but what's the point? They have already shown that they would rather see him fail in order for their own political gain instead of attempting bipartisanship.

Allowing the Federal Reserve to do whatever they want.  I my personal opinion the Federal Reserve Board should all be shot.  Allowing big banks to do whatever the fuck they want.  They also should be shot. (Again just my personal opinion.)  Allowing giant corporations deemed ""too big to fail"" to do whatever the fuck they want.  They should have let GM collapsed and that way the auto worker union would have be broken up and jerk off would be getting paid $40+ an hour for putting a damn blot on a car.  Watch as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fail.  Should also have their board members shot. (my personal opinion.)  Bailout failing entities.  I don't want to sound fucked up but we shouldn't have sent a crap load of money to Haiti when we got our own financial problems to worry about.  Backroom deals hidden from the public.  Has always happened and always will.  Criticize the public for the same mistakes that he commits.  What do you except when the ""Teabaggers"" are waving signs with him depicted as Hilter on them. He was elected, he did not steal the election. (Unlike Bush, but thats a whole different discussion.)  Holding a party while states are experiencing extreme natural disasters.  Because Bush didn't do the exact same thing with Katrina right?  Offshore drilling.  I totally agree.  Go against gay marriage.  Again, totally agree.  Have no sense of fiscal responsibilty.  Atleast he's trying to fix the economy, all Bush did was sit around and let it collapse.  Continue War on Drug.  Agreed.  Pretend to be for safe border but at the same time doing nothing to protect them.  What is the point of trying to do something about this, the only thing Republicans would support is deporting everyone so there is no point of him trying to debate the immigration topic.  Promoting environmental while at the same time failing to get some real legislation done.  Kind of hard when no Republican is willing to open talks with the Democrats.  In Conclusion, Obama may have his flaws, but he is doing, in my opinion, a way better job then that wacko McCain would have done.

""He did, that's why it is on my list of ways Obama = Bush.""  Let me restate that in actuality Bush's response was worse then Obama's, Bush was told by the Govenor of Louisana as well as the Mayor of New Orleans that the leevees would not hold prior to Katrina but did nothing, it hit New Orleans on Monday and Bush overflew the devastated area on Air Force One as he traveled from Texas back to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and wasn't briefed about the situation until he arrived at the Gulf Coast on Friday. Thats a week of doing nothing even though he had already been told prior to Katrina that the leevees would not hold.  The oil spill that is occuring right now however was not predicted and Obama was told by BP that it was not a serious problem and wasn't told that the leak was in fact serious until almost a week later.  Bottom Line: Obama didn't know, Bush didn't even care.  ""Actually, Bush was the one who passed the first bail outs and in 2003 he tried to regulate Fanny and Freddie but the Democrats blocked him.""  The recession started around December of 2007 so Bush's bail outs didn't do shit. As for the Democrats blocking Bush from Fanny and Freddie, the Republicans are doing the same thing now with Wall Street.

Even the health care bill accomplished almost nothing the democratic party wanted and mostly played into the pocketbooks of the Insurance company, who will now get more business and have an excuse to charge what they want. To be fair, the republicans in Congress have dug in their heels and refuse to do almost anything, but they're only getting away with it because of Obama and the dems in Congress inability to either work together and use their super majority or approach the republicans in a way to make things work.  This was the dems opportunity for a golden age of several years of dem control. Instead, they will probably lose everything in the next two elections.

I think that everyone is just tired of the establishment and wants to get rid of the incumbents. So I guess since Dems have a majority, they are the bigger target but the fact the people are still pissed at Bush, balances out both parties chances of victory. Atleast thats how I feel.

If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration.   OK, I don't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just don't see this. Tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes, but we are in a massive recession, so tax revenue is down. Your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact. Ironically, your point only proves why the Bush tax cuts should be extended: by lowering taxes for certain income brackets, the govt tax revenue actually goes up.   2. Spending has actually been cut   No. Sure he cut the f-22 program, but the stimulus bill, health care, and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending. This is just not true. Sorry.   3. Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it   So if everyone else is doing it we should too? Most of these countries are having financial meltdowns because of massive deficit spending.   4. Due to the stimulus package, the economy is improving. Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Again, no. First of all, 200,000 jobs gained in January are census jobs mostly. Second, the stimulus package contained almost NO stimulus. It CANNOT stimulate the economy because it was almost entirely pork barrel spending and was ""stimulus"" in name only. That aside, we have clearly lost jobs, as unemployment has gone from 6% to 10%. Where did that 700 billion dollars go? And even if we did add jobs, 700 billion for 200k jobs? It would be cheaper to give $1 million dollars to every american.  Anyway, I'm gonna skim and end, because I think I've made my point.   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending    Political double speak. While he drastically increases spending he attempts to make himself look good by ordering reviews.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   see above.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   while bills like the 1 trillion dollar health care bill are done completely behind closed doors.   1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House   He said. But we have seen the heaviest lobbying in White House history under his regime.  Anyway, point being almost everything this man touches turns to dust. The ""budget neutral"" health care bill has now been revealed by the CBO to be a 1 trillion dollar deficit. We are spending 150% of our GDP in deficit spending (Greece is collapsing at only 119%). He passed student loan reform and no one even knows what it means. You say this man will go down in history. This is undoubtedly true.

The rich are no longer in a mood to create even lousy jobs. They are taking what's left of their riches and fleeing to the safety of treasury bills. They are still trying to figure out if their asset managers were funneling money to Bernie Madoff and other crooks.  When private demand and investment collapse, the government has to step in and boost its own investment in our future. Fortunately, the government intends to invest in things we really need like education, science, infrastructure, health care and renewable energy. Frankly, that's better than video games and hummers and all the other crap that Americans buy when we get to keep our own money.  What supply-siders don't seem to understand is that government jobs are not a dead weight on economic growth. If we employ more teachers and firefighters and peanut-butter-factory inspectors, they will take their paychecks and go to the mall and buy the crap that private investment tends to favor. Vital services and crap can coexist.  Any decent country needs a balance between public and private investment. Yes, if the government runs everything, you get a dreary Soviet-style morass that makes almost everyone poor. But the starve-the-government-to-death (except for the war machine and corporate welfare queens) philosophy of the Bush era was leading us to a situation in which the rich were counting their dollars in gated communities, while the rest of society was going to hell -- even while enjoying the video games.

Sure, bankers and unscrupulous speculators and con artists destroyed many jobs indirectly with their risk and irresponsible business decisions, but those jobs were directly lost to fear, inactivity and no confidence in the economy.  However, the real problem is the Federal Reserve, the central bank who provided the money for the bailouts and were supported by the government. If the Fed were to end, sound money would reign supreme and end the influx of inflation and bailouts. If bailouts were not guaranteed by the Fed and the government, these banks would have strong incentives to practice responsibility and prudent business decisions; plus, the government passed laws requiring banks give loans out despite the ability to pay.  The problem with government stepping in or demand side economics boosting investment are 3 factors. One is inflation unless you love inflation, in order to reinvest, more money needs to be printed; thus, it devalues the currency, and it actually hurts the poor and middle class in the long run because wages increases can't keep up. Two is higher taxes. Since the government has very little ownership, they don't own assets. They have to tax to pay for these investments. Three is if no higher taxes, then it is increasing debt, which is just as bad as inflation.  I completely agree that the war machine and corporate welfare is wrong. War can only be funded by unappropriated or levied resources where the government must print more money in order to pay for wars.

That is why they are weird, they live under a number of delusions, that the government has been acting unconstitutionally only one of many. Here are some of the other tea party delusions:  1. Obama was not born here  2. Obama is taking your guns when in fact he's relaxed gun laws.  3. Obama has raised their taxes, when in fact everyone paid less taxes last year.  4. Only poor black people who want free stuff voted for him even though he won by one of the largest majorities in history  I'm sure there are more but I try not to talk to the village idiots.  Anyway, yes, on average every one really did pay less taxes. I realize that ruins many of those potato chip stuffed asses reason for leaving their recliner and making a colorful sign, but it is the truth.  Further, half the idiot tea party crying about ""Gov'ment tooks my money! WAH!"" Actually benefit from one government program or another, and would be crying even harder if the government took away their Medicare or social security.  2. No, spending really has been cut. The stimulus was passed under Bush, and under Obama most of the money has been repaid. It's yet another silly tea bagger delusion, this idea that only Obama passed the stimulus, and that the stimulus isn't the only thing that saved us from another great depression. Every expert says without it we would be living in Hoover tents right now. Anyway,   part of the problem I see, is that people like yourself when I say ""spending has been cut"" you are comparing spending now, to spending in magical fairy land, while I on the other hand am dealing with reality, and the spending during the Bush years.  3. Uh, no.  Every  country that has a similar plan, and usually an even more liberal plan than what was passed here, spends less per capita on healthcare. That means they have more money. That means they are less likely to have financial meltdowns due to healthcare. Again, you do not argue in reality. Look at any chart of healthcare spending and you will see the US spent nearly twice as much as any country before this was passed.  4. Oh my god, are you literally retarded? I mean I had my suspicions when I saw your name, looks like a gay dating site title, but that aside I didn't really think you were literally retarded until I saw your number 4 point there.   Bush was handed the best economy in the history of the US due to Clinton's policies. This massive surplus was literally squandered by that monkey Bush in about 3 years. Due to what you call ""stimulus"" which is really just tax cuts for people who don't need them and won't put the money back into the economy and insane deregulation that started with Reagan, we went from the greatest US economy in history to the second worst in US history.  It is truly an accomplishment in itself, how one crappy president with daddy issues can bring an entire economy to it's knees so quickly. Now we have an intelligent person in office, and for the first time in about 6 years each month is showing less job losses than the last, and in some instances actual job gains,  and still you preach Bush era economic strategy. It is truly mind boggling how one can be so completely clueless.  Honestly I'm bored of you now.  I will add though to your ""bigot"" comment. You do realize that if Obama were not black this fake corporate run grass roots tea bagger bs would not happen. Sure some are just clueless idiots who live in a Faux Noise media alternate Universe and have no idea how backwards their view of what is going on is, but most are pissed because ""real America"" as they put it, in there view does not include black people. Disliking people because of their opinions is far different than comparing a democratically elected president to Hitler and insisting he was not born here all because of the color of his skin.  And I don't want to hear the old line ""no that's not it uh, uh, it's his policies.""  Bullshit. Where was the tea party in the Clinton years? Where was the tea party when Bush with the help of that troll Cheyenne destroyed the strongest economy in the world? Nowhere, because Clinton and Bush are white. Bigot indeed.

The companies with plans like this are dropping these plans to avoid the taxes, drying up still another form of payment.

That nazi...always spending money.  Except it isn't Obama's policy. It's Bush's that is driving up the debt.  Almost all of our deficit can be attributed to four main spending binges:  1. Two unsustainable useless wars started, passed, and continued by republicans. It took Obama to end Iraq and create an endgame for Afghanistan pullout.  2. Two unsustainable, deficit exploding tax cuts for the rich. All passed, initiated, pushed, and signed by republicans.  3. An unsustainable social security increase. Take a guess as to who passed it?  4. An unsustainable Medicare Part D expansion, the single largest entitlement increase in United States history, and likely world history. Republicans sure are anti-entitlement small government fiscal conservatives aren't they...  -  But don't take my word for it. Here is Obama vs. Bush New Spending.  Obama is at a net $350 billion in non-recession spending (projected out for EIGHT years). Bush spent $4 trillion in the same time period.  Now look me in the eyes and call Obama a big spender.}  Ok I will,   1. Don't EVER call Iraq a stupid war, if you think going to search and destroy osama bin laden in Bush's war was stupid well your very undereducated. We didn't just roll into iraq with tanks for nothing, 9/11 triggered the war, If you can remember Republicans and democrats stood on the capitol with bush in and listened to the star spangled banner in agreement that war was absolutley necessary and then the democrats all ran away and blamed bush for the war. Democrats love to pay thanks to our shitty president for getting osama but what they dont realize this is BUSH'S WAR you all opposed and still do.  2. Do the poor create jobs? NO. Does the middle class, yea they contribute small business's but Steve Job's, Bill Gates, Alan Mulally, etc, the rich create the majority with jobs and what happens when you tax them to death, well they don't want to lose all the money of starting new corporations and new enterprises along with the taxes and regulations of the govt and they end up moving their business's to other countries where they can make a profit. Did you not read the part where 50% of Americans dont pay taxes and the rich make up for the 20% that do?! and you want to tax them more!?   3. Aren't the democrats the ones who want to spend money they don't have?  4. So theres 1 liberal thing a republican did, what if we added up all the shitty euro-style policies dems keep wanting to ram down the taxpayers throats? Look what each side spent it on, Bush's was the necessary war and obama's was his failed stimulus bill and obamacare that 60% of Americans want repealed TODAY?   {Who said liberals find it attractive?!?!?!  Liberals were AGAINST THE WARS!  AGAINST THE BUSH TAX CUTS.  Where have you been living. Why do you think they are calling on revenue increases? To cut the deficit that Bush created from a projected surplus}  Ok first of all, incorrect liberals were for the war in 2001 and then they backed out of it blaming it on bush in ...2001.5.  Why raise taxes, CUT USELESS SPENDING, for example funding the egyptian military when they we just had to pay 5 million dollars to release American hostages from egypt!?!? the should FUND THEIR OWN DAMN SELVES!

A lot of the taxation is theft mentality is predicated on the notion that we (humans) are not primarily social beings. Most of what you do in the world is social activity - buying goods and services, owning property, etc... all things are allowed for and provided by a society of people, participation is a privilege and you tacitly comply with and assent to taxation merely by participating  The 'We' is the nation as a whole, the demand of the masses as expressed through voting and engaging in political discourse.   i definitely agree that prudent is open to opinion, this is where the 'We' comes in, the 'we' becomes the expression of the collective opinon  You have obviously been smoking the supply side theory insofar as you think that the middle class is allowed for by the wealthy. Tax policy and education policy is what allows for the creation of a middle class and jobs are created by the market. It is true that if the wealthy have all the money that jobs are created by them because they are the only ones who could invest, however, if they don’t have all the money, jobs are created by where money is invested. Middle class people can invest just as much as the wealthy, and do when given the opportunity to when tax policy is not skewed in favor of the wealthy. Just because a lot of money is in the hands of the wealthy, doesn’t mean that this is the fundamental nature of job creation, it is only the nature of job creation in an extremely stratified society. Extreme stratification also creates instability in the market because investment is based on the whim of a small number of individuals who have often, in the past, jumped ship and played with the markets toward their own personal gain (not that personal gain is a problem, it is only a problem when it is done by manipulation and with the known consequence of huge costs to other people.) This is why there are anti-trust laws and laws that prevent monopolies.   The he who serves best earns best notion is valid to a point, but national income is not a reflection of this, income and wealth is a reflection of the degree to which a few people control the means of production and maintain that order through a rationalised stratification. I am not against stratification, I just think that there needs to be an ameliorative taxation policy to prevent the various forms of desperation that are fundamental to capitalist systems.   You totally did write uber-sensitive  Some truth is subjective, some truth is objective, like this - it is objectively true that you are reading this right now. I would argue that truth that which is subjective is only opinion. subjectivity is dependent on perception, objectivity is about things that are true independent of perception even if they require a perceiver. Truth does exist independent of belief about what is true.  Afirmative action is not about putting african americans ahead of caucasion , it is about social justice, it is not fundamentally left, and is distinct from the notion of modern racism even though it relates to racial issues. modern racism is when you - believe racism is a thing of the past, - make associations about people based on their ethnicity or skin color that are not necessary links. it is racist because you are making judgements and acusations about people according to their skin color or ethnicity, this includes names and religions that are a persons cultuaral heritage.

It is the best way to accelerate economic activity. As far as i am aware, Supply side economics (i.e. trickle down economics - right wing economics) is contrary to maximal aggrigate demand because it doesnt promote consumption.   Aggregate Demand is the combination of Consumptions, Investment, Govt. Spending, and Net Trade activity. As far as i know, the wealthy invest and consume at a relatively static level as a group. The middle class invest and consume relative to their ability. Progressive taxation increases this ability for the middle class and thus, in order to maximize aggregate demand we need to policies that promote the middle class (typically left wing, socialistic policies).   To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well.

Evidence suggests that socialism tends to reduce crime. Socialist policies promote education as well, which can only serve to benefit our economic situation insofar as our nation has become a service-based economy, and our remaining industries are both capital intensive and require at least some post secondary degrees (High tech industries).   Insofar as this is true, Obama, who has an idiologically left (socialistic) alignment, is the best option.

John McCain had lost to the first major party endorsed African-American presidential candidate in United States history. We finally closed troubling chapters in our history such as Mississippi burning and the civil rights marches of Selma.  Republicans, including the bewildered Religious Right, sat stunned in their seats wondering what would happen to their country. It was not because the Democratic Party was any different from the Bush Administration but because the GOP had pathetically lost its neo-conservative bully pulpit in the White House.  Democrats cheered with glee at the opportunity to take back the power that was theirs during the Clinton Glory Days. They salivated at the prospect of re-introducing neo-liberal interventionism on foreign soil and overseas markets They longed to once again crank the Dollar presses to inflate the money supply in the name of the ""poor"" this time instead of ""business"". They would gladly finish the work of the Fall of the American Empire started under the Bush Regime.  And now, the smoke and mirrors game goes on. The crooked politicians of 2009 are no different than the corrupt politicians of the Gilded Age or the Roaring Twenties. Crony capitalists like oil barons and railway tycoons then lined the pockets of our nation's representatives to further the goals of Big Business and destroy the wealth of American workers. Sound familiar?  President Obama had a unique opportunity in history -- and he blew it. He brought us ""change"" indeed. He slammed the Bush Doctrine in all its ugly forms of secrecy and judicial obstruction into executive hyper-drive. The rhetoric of compassionate conservative now became the drivel of compassionate liberalism.  If there is one thing Americans say about Obama it is this: he cares.  He cares for the mechanic in Detroit who lost his job. He cares for the middle-aged couple living in the Hooverville tent outside Sacramento. He cares for the middle class mother and her three kids in Toledo spending their nights in a homeless shelter with the addicted and the ignored.  But does Obama really care?  In fact, his compassionate liberalism runs so deep that it pulls a move from the old Ronald Reagan playbook we knew as trickle-down economics. These days the compassionate White House grants bail-out money to financial monsters like AIG and Bank of America. There could be no better help for the American veteran shivering under a bridge tonight because there just aren't any more jobs. (Unless of course, you can beat out the 200 other people applying for that one lonely job opening.) The idea is that bail-out money will sooner or later trickle-down to the great unwashed masses of Americans wondering what in Sam Hill happened to the real estate market and their retirement accounts.  It may only be a drop of financial bail-out -- but hey it trickled down. Next up, bread lines!  The truth is that the White House allowed corporate giant CEOs to loot and pilfer the public treasury. This Administration is following the same tortured logic of the previous one which assured us that falsely accused cab drivers from Baghdad were receiving comfortable attention at Guantanamo Bay.  The left-right political paradigm in this country is a sham. (Sorry to disappoint my fellow Evangelical Christians.) Both parties have proven to be Big Business, Big Government warmongers. For those who actually wished McCain had been elected just think about this: the GOP would have put up no opposition to the new President's Stimulus Package and would have rammed through trillions more in ""help"" for America.  So there you have it. President Obama is as bad as the worst conservative and as bad as the worst liberal -- and all with a smile.  How is the left-right scenario a sham? Consider the following.  The gay rights issue is a political distraction. Stem cell research? Just more Big Research pork-barrel spending. Abortion? It's the political Gordian Knot that requires even the most astute of political science majors to bust a gut if they dare try to untie it. The so-called immigration invasion? A typical act of sensational yellow journalism that says, ""Look over there, Bubba! It ain't your own government stealin' your hard-earned dollars, it's them Mexicans lookin' for revenge and dishwasher jobs since the Alamo!"" Sorry, Pat Buchanan, the ""Death of the West"" comes from the corruption in our government, not the immigrants heading back home in record numbers.  What are the real issues of post-election America? For starters, the destruction of individual wealth in this country, save for the high upper class. We are on the verge of an economic meltdown that will dwarf the Great Depression and will take decades to recover. There is no need for a conspiracy theory here -- only the urgency of understanding the mess that we allowed to happen and how we can financially protect ourselves.  We must not waste time. We must move our already-compromised and over-valued U.S. Dollars into assets of real value. This does not include real estate unless you're buying ten cents or less on the high-priced dollar. Forget your 401(k), pensions and your annuities. Unless you can take your money out, they are toast. The stock market is one toxic graveyard, particularly finance shares. Dump them. Invest in precious metals, food supply, cigarettes, alcohol and medicine for trade and help for your neighbors when the Dollar collapses.  Consider buying silver, palladium and gold from reputable sellers like apmex.com. I personally recommend silverbullion.com because I support the goals of the owner Jason Hommel to bring silver back as the most effective medium of exchange. Remember, that despite the U.S. Treasury's naked assertions, the U.S. Constitution expressly reserves the right of individual States to mint legal tender coins so long as they're gold or silver.  When the dollar collapses, I do not think that New York City will burn or that the United States will come to an immediate end. But if it did, the blame must rest entirely on Barack Obama and his Congressional Criminal Syndicate.  Some might here criticize me as being unfair. After all, George W. Bush The Evangelical nearly bankrupted this country with his illegal wars, his blatant lies to stir Americans to bloodshed, his deliberate obstruction to the 9/11 Commission, his last-minute corporate bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions, his economic tinkering with interest rates, his unconscionable acts of torturing innocent men and children, his doubling of the national debt, et cetera, et cetera.  But let me be clear about this. George W. Bush is a public menace. He and his cadre must be tried and convicted of their crimes. But that will never happen under an Obama Presidency, in spite of the President's left-leaning brand of crony capitalism. The Truth Commission currently at play in the Congress is merely a circus show to fool Americans into thinking that we actually take seriously the crimes of torture, invasion, occupation, mayhem, pillaging, looting, rape, pollution, perjury, bribery and killing of civilians with illegal weapons of war.  Every moment that the Obama Administration rolls on without prosecuting the crimes of the former Administration, it exists as a de facto confirmation that our new President has sold out to the rich and that he lied to his Democratic base and the American voter. The White House today has continued in the same deadly bait-and-switch tactics of the former Village Idiot-In-Chief. Additionally, Obama has moved to control more media and aggressively solidify relationships with members of the ""War and Bankers Party"" on both sides of the aisle.  For a President to vociferously take on Rush Limbaugh the GOP's talk radio attack dog is an alarming signal. Besides the fact that the Democrats want to point out the weakness of the GOP's leadership vacuum, Obama is inserting himself into the realm of media and entertainment instead of focusing on how his office can uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution in light of the economic crisis. Are we really so surprised to see the leftist authoritarian Hugo Chavez, who is a regular media personality, cheer Obama in his nationalization and socialization of the banking and insurance industries?  Evangelical Christian radio stations are scared stiff about the Democratic-led Congress reviving restrictions on Americans to share their religious opinions over the people's airwaves. And they should be concerned. (I particularly enjoy my local station.) After all, the same kind of government that monitors, censors, filters and controls any form of media is the same type of authoritarianism that steals, plunders and coerces its own people. One look at China's control of the internet and Google's sickening overture to that regime is enough to make any civil libertarian's skin crawl. Reports that Australia is considering Chinese-style filtering over what their people can access on the internet makes me want to boycott eucalyptus leaves.  So why is President Obama responsible for our economic debacle?  Because it's the first rule of leadership. Everything is your fault. If he didn't like the prospect of being stuck with the mess of his predecessor he should have remained in the Senate or considered an honest living like working for AIG or Lehmann Brothers. Obama has not only repeated the same unconstitutional trespasses of Bush II, but he actually increased the amount of corporate welfare to the Bank Barons. Obama turned a blind eye to the Federal Reserve's arbitrary usury practice through the printing of increasingly worthless U.S. Dollars.  Are we really going to see a Dow Jones 4000? The answer is regrettably yes -- and then some. There are economic forces at play that will no longer be ignored or manipulated. Human behavior will always gravitate towards self-preservation and the protection of our future generations through wealth-building, capital, production and labor. All the paper fiat money and government spending in the world can never stop that or help this economic disaster recover without drastic corrections to our own cursed speculative market. The times of fast and easy money are over.  President Obama has not even finished his first year in office and I must already call him out as one of the worst Executives ever in the history of our Republic. Bush II is close behind. Every GOP and Democratic elected leader that voted for any of these crooked bail-outs deserves a one-way ticket to an electoral defeat. Should state law allow it, a public tar-and-feathering might be in order.  When our country faced economic dangers, depressionary woes and international volatility let it be said that President Obama failed to protect us from the corruption of Congress, the indifference of the Judiciary and the foolishness of the People. Let it be said that he abandoned his post to uphold the Constitution. Let it be said that he whored his policies and his office for the rich and powerful, both foreign and domestic. Let it be said that we voted for change and all we got was the Raw Deal of the Obama Failure obama is a failure

Never would present his academic records from the colleges he supposedly attended. Would not release his medical records either. Who is he?  Well he has bowed down and kissed Arab leaders. He has treated the president of Israel terrible…what leader in the world comes to the White House and has to use the back door?   His hero is an anti-American racist who hates whites….Rev. Wright. He was in bed with Tony Rezko the Chicgo slug who is now in prison. I mean what political candidate would take money from someone who is being investigated by the FBI? OBAMA.  Then there is his affiliation to communist radicals…many of whom he appointed as Czars in his administration. Enter the scene….Bernadine Dohrn and her communist husband Bill Ayers who founded the organization Weather Underground.    ""The best thing that we can be doing for ourselves, as well as for the [Black] Panthers and the revolutionary black liberation struggle, is to build a fucking white revolutionary movement."" And that is what she and her husband did.  For a long time she was on the FBI's most wanted list. Her husband is just as radical as she was. Two of Obamas friends.  He failed to handle the Gulf Oil spill in a timely manner.  Failed to end the war like he promised he would do. Took him three years to end it….hundreds more died on his watch.  Putting all legislation on the Internet for five days before it came to a vote.  Snubbed the president of Israel. Snubbed Britain by returning that bust of Churchill.    He appointed Communists/Socialists/Progressives to his various Czar positions (without even getting congressional approval) then doing nothing for them after Glenn Beck calls them out…forcing many to resign.  Then there was his failed stimulus…health care the country still does not want…  Wants total amnesty for illegals.  Does not even know basic American geography and thinks there are 57 states.  Thinks that there was only one bomb that hit Pearl Harbor.  He thinks to solve any financial crisis….borrowing is the answer. So he has borrowed until we now don't even have our chins above water.  I could go on and on….  He is a narcissist and his change was not what the people who even voted for him expected he meant. His change seeks to destroy the country. He is absolutely incompetent and dangerous….and I would vote for just about anyone in order to get him out. Well except Nancy Pelosi and I think she is almost worse than Obama is.   If he is get in for four more years…we are doomed. He hates this country and it shows. He has done nothing but apologize for Americas actions since taking office and I think people even many Democrats are sick of him and can now see him for what he is.

261	obama	F	9	8	1	oppose	Nick91983	unknown	"(Pardon spelling errors)  How does Obama not know a thing about the economy? As far as i know he promotes progressive taxation, progressive taxation promotes aggregate demand which benefits everyone since this term is synonymous with economic health - see my other post about aggregate demand to know more about what i mean.   Immigration - How could anyone talk about Obama with respect to immigration as though he is an immigrant if he didnt immigrate to this country? Are you really that unaware of the fact that he was born in Hawaii? Do you really think that he would be able to become all the things he has become if he had forged the documents that prove his origins? I feel like the scrutiny would be really extreme prior to his taking office. The notion that he is from another country is at least slightly racist because it is a reflection of his non-anglo-american name and ethnicity which are irrelivant to that fact that he was born in the US.   On gay rights - maybe he doesnt fully support them, but he supports them way more than just about any other option. who is more in support of them than he?   on Middle class taxes - taxes must reflect government spending, insofar as there are bariers to the greater taxation for the wealthy, he is necessarily forced to tax the middle class more if he is to be fiscally responsible. I doubt that he is truly in favor of increasing taxes generally and specifically not in favor of taxing the middle class. but what other option does he have that doesnt increase the national debt?   On Foreign policy - are you arguing that he is pro war? Obama is trying to get us out of the wars we got into under bush II. Given the political (national and global) complexities of our modern world, you cant just withdraw at any arbitrary point once you have engaged in war. Also, as a nation we have a responsibility to ourselves (even though people would argue beyond this point) to prevent nuclear proliferation and instability in regions that supply us with natural resources as well as the threats to them - it is not only in our economic interest, but our national security interest as well. I am not pro war, but i also recognize that the complexities of geopolitical strategy suggests the irrationality of isolationist and immediate-withdrawl policies.   Terrorism - I dont have much to say about TSA and NDAA. as far as i know, these are the way they are because of Bush II. Insofar as Obama is concerned politically, it might be a bad idea to undermine strong counter terrorist innitiatives. Political dance is more than just going with what you want, you have to navigate the will of the masses to promote the best ideas. Obama cant commit political suicide by appealing to the sensabilities of the people when doing so might cause others to question his stance on national security and defense.

For all the Lefties out there, yes President Bush was NOT the ideal president he was very far from it, I will be the first to admit that. What you must understand is that: The national average when President Bush left office the national price for unleaded gasoline was $1.75 a gallon, today as I write this, the Lowest national price for a gallon of gas is $3.80. When President Bush left office (not that this is low) the national debt was 8 trillion $'s, today it's 15 trillion $'s and climbing, do your math, President Bush created about $1 trillion a year in debt in 8 years , Obama has created $7 trillion in about 4 years, I don't see how that is attractive to lefties but it just seems to be. The last time our economy was worse than this, it was the great depression. Everyone keeps saying that ""Obama got osama"", Incorrect, he gave the order to kill him after 16 hours of ""thought"" wheather to do it or not, the Navy Seal Team 6 were the men who killed osama in Bush's war. Taxes, Conservatives want them low and Liberals want them high. Obama wants to raise them on the wealthy, WHY!? 50% of Americans pay no taxes at all! why not even give them a tax! The wealthy pay their fair share, they make up for the 20% who do pay taxes. Raising taxes is one thing but if the president is going to raise them he needs to raise them on EVERYONE. We are all in this together, stop alot of these govt funded (taxpayer funded) programs and grow a set and work for your living so your neighbor doesn't have to! Barack Obama has been a failure as a president 6x more than President Bush. If your going to argue this please do so in an intelligent, mature manner.

Jesus! How ignorant can you be? The presidency has exactly NO control over the gas prices.  I would suggest reading  this .   Oil prices are a global phenomena . You have no point.

You have already discredited your argument.   today it's 15 trillion $'s and climbing   But why? Why is climbing? It's Obama isn't it. That nazi...always spending money.  Except it isn't Obama's policy. It's Bush's that is driving up the debt.  Almost all of our deficit can be attributed to four main spending binges:  1. Two unsustainable useless wars started, passed, and continued by republicans. It took Obama to end Iraq and create an endgame for Afghanistan pullout.  2. Two unsustainable, deficit exploding tax cuts for the rich. All passed, initiated, pushed, and signed by republicans.  3. An unsustainable social security increase.

Obama is at a net $350 billion in non-recession spending (projected out for EIGHT years). Bush spent $4 trillion in the same time period.  Now look me in the eyes and call Obama a big spender.    I don't see how that is attractive to lefties but it just seems to be.   Who said liberals find it attractive?!?!?!  Liberals were AGAINST THE WARS!  AGAINST THE BUSH TAX CUTS.  Where have you been living. Why do you think they are calling on revenue increases? To cut the deficit that Bush created from a projected surplus.    The last time our economy was worse than this, it was the great depression.    The effects of trickle-down economics and republican economic policy continues to be felt...sad...  And actually, the last time it was worse than this was Summer of 2009. Since then, under Obama, the economy has recovered significantly.   Incorrect, he gave the order to kill him after 16 hours of ""thought"" wheather to do it or not   He did much more than that. And i'm damn glad he bought about it. There was a 60% chance that he was there. Defense Secretary Robert Gates (appointed by Bush first I might add) called it one of the gutsiest decisions he has seen made and he doubted other people who have done what Obama did.

And this was only possible under Obama's leadership.  And don;t you dare give Bush ANY credit for this. The first shreds of intel that came about his whereabout (that of his courier actually) were found two years before the raid. Obama was president at that time.  Maybe it was Bush's infrastructure? NO. Obama has killed 22 of 30 top Al Qaeda Heads. How many did bush get in 8 years? 4...  Obama has been BY FAR the best commander in chief in modern american history.   Taxes, Conservatives want them low and Liberals want them high.   Wrong. Righties want taxes for working people, the poor and middle class (who have seen income increases of 5% in the past 30 years) to be high and cut taxes for the rich who have seen income increases of 212% in the past 30 years.   Liberals realize this is incredibly unfair and that income inequality is vicious, self-perpetuating cycle that needs to stop.    50% of Americans pay no taxes at all!   That is a lie. Stop being spoon fed republican bullshit lies and propaganda. They pay sales tax. Property tax. Estate tax. Social security/payroll taxes. Etc.   The wealthy pay their fair share   They do not.    Raising taxes is one thing but if the president is going to raise them he needs to raise them on EVERYONE.   When has obama EVER raised taxes?  He cut taxes for small businesses 16 times.  Extended the bush tax cut.  Fought against republicans to extend patrol tax cuts and won.  His jobs plan was over 50% tax cuts.  His stimulus cut taxes for 95% of americans.  He wants to cut corporate taxes from 35% to 28%.  The corporate tax actual rate (average percent paid...about 12%, not the 35% the right whines about) is the lowest in decades under Obama.  -  But no...he wants to raise taxes. You righties will just never stop smearing this president with lies will you? Sickening...   Barack Obama has been a failure   How? In what area? He has been a success. 4 more years!   6x more than President Bush.   HA! That man ruined the country and Obama begins to fix it, but no...he is 6x worse.

Small business is not going to hire when they are facing a possible huge carbon emissions tax. If health care goes through another 8% tax.   The game plan right now of the President is to add more tax to a already hurt economy.

It's pretty scary scenario when you think about it.   On the other hand I had a real new rule regulation hit me in the face to day. I was trying to surrender and pull my money out of a 403B plan that my wife has and before Jan 1 of this year it would have been no problem but now you can't. The reason when I asked my broker was they had no reason even when the regulators set out the new rules they targeted 403B and their reason according to my broker who is an expert on the markets said they had none. Great! So this is the great regulation we where all waiting for not allowing people to get their own money out. This just happened to me today. There's a lot more to the story but it is so frustrating that I will get even more mad. Basically the new regulation is a form of pure Socialism. My money, won't let me have it. I have to make up some lie just to get it out like I'm sick or something or I have a hardship which I don't but that's besides the point. I don't know if you own a home or business but if you did you would see the huge amount of more taxes you pay just to own a home or business it's stifling. The argument here is that the more taxes and more government regulation the less freedoms we have and less individual drive we have. Today for me was a absolute confirmation on what I believe this admin is trying to do and that is a Socialist society.

Obama believed that we would have made much more progress in the conflict than we have, and we could leave safely.   Then why even waste so much on it? If it cost so much and had only a small effect then wouldn't it have been better without it? Then why is it so hard for Godmaba to cut spending? Why does it seem like he thinks that MORE spending will help the economy?    This is the reason why economics is so confusing for so many people. You CAN help an economy with spending more. Sounds crazy but it is possible. The cost isn't what's important, what's important is:  1) Where is the money going.  2) What is it doing once it gets there.  The idea is this. If the government gives us money, the hope is that we will spend it on goods and services and in return generate revenue, this revenue becomes income. This income is then spent on more goods and services, which will generate more revenue and so forth... So by encouraging people to spend money in exchange for goods and services, Obama was hoping to improve the economy.   The more money changes hands the better the economy will be. So by spending money, we are causing it to change hands.  An increase in spending has two benefits:  -increased economic activity for us  -increased tax revenue for the government.  It's a win-win situation. What often happens is that people get their stimulus check, and then they put it in their savings account where it sits. The money doesn't do the economy any good if it just sits in your bank account. People have to spend their stimulus checks for it to help the economy any. Another thing that happens is people get their stimulus checks they spend their money on some name-brand good and the money goes directly into the bank account of some rich CEO where it can sit for years before it is ever spent again.

Or perhaps you could be a little more discerning about word usage, particularly when it is my argument you are considering.   All US economists are conservative ideologues...    You misuse the term ""conservative"" to mean ""believer in free markets"". This is misleading because liberals also believe in free markets. It's only a question of the degree of government oversight that should exist. You won't find many purists at either end of the spectrum.   Conservative: in favor of preserving the status quo and traditional values and customs, and against abrupt change.   Ideologues: a particularly zealous or doctrinaire supporter of an ideology.  All US economists are conservative ideologues; regardless of whether or not they are democrats, republicans, or independents etc.  My argument is about economists not politicians. I described attributes of all economists, none of which are political.   (If you mean the  conservative political party , then communicate what you mean, for I can only understand what you mean by what you state. And if what you state is not what you mean then choose words that communicate the meaning of what you’re thinking.)   Finally, the track record of the consensus opinion of economists is so poor...the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.    Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Thus far you have presented none.   Finally, we get to the core problem of your viewpoint.   You’ve not researched the opinions of other economists whose opinions are not the consensus. Case in point, Nouriel Roubini, one of many economists who predicted the current economic mess, did so in 2006. Nor was he the only economist who predicted today’s crisis. But, it is self-evident to me that you failed to do your own research, and then as a consequence you find that my assertion,  ”the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.” , is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.   What is extraordinary is the fact that you are blinded by your own biased viewpoint, so much so that you presumed there is no evidence to contradict your viewpoint and therefore there is no reason to consider a contrary or contradictory viewpoint of the consensus opinion of economists.   However, if you do find it within yourself to challenge your viewpoint, you will find that there were many Economists who predicted the crisis. And you will find that the consensus of economists was predicting good times. Moreover, the economists who were predicting good-times were mocking and laughing at economists such as Dr. Doom.   .    Yes, it's clear that most economists fucked up in the case of the current recession. How many times do we have to go over this? The future is hard to predict. The best we can do is make educated guesses. Why is that concept so hard for you to grasp? We can't predict the weather with 100% certainty, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.   You must stop with the straw-man arguments with me. I am being as polite as I can be, but you are testing my limits of politeness.   We both know that the consensus of economists missed the current ‘great recession’ , but what you fail to recognize is that there are some economists who did predict this recession. Not only did they predict the recession, their opinions were not the consensus. Albeit, your refusal to research the opinions of maverick economists indicates to me that you deny that there are indeed economists who predicted this recession. Furthermore, you take it to the extreme of being extraordinary, both in claim and evidence.   If you find the above to be obscure in terminology, consider the following illustration.  You can’t call my evidence extraordinary when you fail to even go look for contrary evidence before assuming a valid viewpoint.

I find it extremely laughable that there is not one iota of reason contained within any of your arguments which would justify your blind-trust of the consensus opinion of economists.   Now, allow me the license to appeal to your sense of reality. In the last thirty years, and more quickly the last ten years, there has been an uninterrupted progression of the transfer of wealth from the lower classes to the upper class. The record profits of Wall Street are occurring at the same time that record wealth is being lost from the common man. Now, explain to me why most mainstream economists are not advising anything other than more of the same? Hell, we can go back thirty+ years on this truth of reality.  Conclusion:   Go ahead and trust the consensus opinion of mainstream economists and likewise observe the continued transfer of your wealth. And perhaps you may learn that maybe, just maybe, the economists are effecting policy for that very purpose. Consistency establishes intent! A man (economist) who consistently advocates policy that transfers your wealth to another is guilty of seeking to transfer your wealth.   I thought liberals were for the little guy?

Firstly you didn’t distribute your subject, economists. And in response I rationally supposed that you meant  some  economists. For no man in his right mind would make the error of supposing that all economists agree. Furthermore, I even granted you the supposition that you were referring to the consensus opinion of economists concerning employment of 2010.   Secondly, no question I asked you remotely hints at suggesting that all economists are nit-wits. I repeatedly asked questions that implicated  only some  economists, and never could it be rationally asserted that I implicated  all  economists.   If you disagree, then consider the following example.  Economists expect employment to be back by the end of 2010.  A contrary rebuttal: Not all economists expect employment to be back the end of 2010.  Finally, demonstrate to me how any question I posed in my original post implicated all economists; for you certainly responded as though I had.  Moving on…   You refer to conservative ideologues, and then imply they are not rational people.  All US economists are conservative ideologues. Why? Because all US economists want to conserve the free-market capitalism of the US which they believe to be perfect or near perfect. Yet, most economists supported the abandonment of free market principles for the sake of capitalism as a means to conserve capitalism. So, who is rational, the economists who protected their ideological view, or the economists who supported the reign of free-market principles.   Finally, the track record of the consensus opinion of economists is so poor I can’t believe any person would use the opinion of the same as a premise of an argument. Albeit, the track records of the maverick economists are more in-tune with reality though.    My evidence: Reality! Why? If the track record of economists was as worthy of policy as you assert then the economy of the US would not be so fucked up as it is now. Economic forecasts are intended to preclude the mess that we are currently struggling with.  Shall I drive that point further?  And the reason, I suppose, that my post was up-voted multiple times is because, believe it or not, I spoke of that which they too are witness. And like me, they too have lived long enough to know that an economist predicts so far into the future that most men are not likely to remember the previous forecast of a year ago. Yet, if there are some who do remember, I assure you that the same economists will provide an explanation of why their forecast was wrong.   Shall I continue with the remainder of our correspondence?  (Better to be pissed off than pissed on.)   Oops, I almost forgot!  Don’t ask me (implicitly) to divine the un-employment rate of the US for 2010 as an evidence of why the consensus opinion of economists is wrong!   They were wrong about this year’s rate of un-employment and I have no reason to believe they can foresee next year’s rate.

Which hasn't done anything except waste 1 trillion dollars on borrowed money.  Proof: 9.7% unemployment in America.   Plus, we were in war, which is always expensive.   Which is a waste. Money wasted due to two warmongers, Bush and Obama.   One other thing, prove for me that governments cannot create wealth.   Creating jobs and wealth is interchangeably linked because if jobs are created by producing an new good or service, then wealth is created, so in a capitalist economy, government has no assets to produce anything without taxation that is taken out of the private sector, government doesn't create jobs and wealth, it merely transfers jobs and wealth from private to public.   Government spending has three sources of misrepresented stimulus.  1. Taxation doesn't create new jobs or wealth because it only transfers wealth from one who creates new wealth. Sure, government employees received incomes, but it is at the expense of those who produce. Government employees don't produce anything new, they only take from the general public.  2. Government borrowing is just as inadequate as taxation, yet at least in taxation, it is paid. It reduces investment in capital, labor and land. Consequently, this translates into fewer new factories, machines, and homes being built. Not only does this decrease in private investment slow economic growth, it results in additional unemployment in these industries. Government borrowing has the illusion of wealth.  3. The worst source of additional government spending is creating new money either by simply printing more money or lower interest rates. Thus, this monetary event always results in inflation by eroding the value of the currency, and consequently, it started the Great Depression.  In addition,  ""But though government can consume wealth and redistribute wealth, it can't create wealth. And unless wealth is created, there is nothing to consume or redistribute. That's why -- even when government is doing something we all agree must be done or most of us want to have it do -- government is a parasite. All it has is what it takes from the producers of wealth... For the economy to grow, government must shrink.""  Wealth 1   ""In a capitalistic economy, labor and capital freely flows to the most productive enterprises precisely because they’re the most profitable. All government can do is inefficiently redistribute wealth that the private sector creates."" Wealth 2   ""But it is a fallacy of the Keynesian legacy that government can reduce unemployment by priming the pump with spending programs. Government needs to reduce spending and taxes in order to leave income in the hands of individuals who earned it and who can spend it much more efficiently than the government can.""  Jobs 1   ""Governments have only three ways of paying employees — taxes, borrowing and printing money. Each of those reduces income and wealth among those paying taxes, servicing debts or stuck with shrinking greenbacks. In short, governments can't ""create jobs."" Adding government jobs is never a net addition to employment opportunities, because it means a heavier burden on private employers and employees. ""  Jobs 2   ""It overlooks the fact that, in the real world, government can’t inject money into the economy without first taking money out of the economy. More specifically, the theory only looks at one-half of the equation — the part where government puts money in the economy’s right pocket. But where does the government get that money? It borrows it, which means it comes out of the economy’s left pocket. There is no increase in what Keynesians refer to as aggregate demand. Keynesianism doesn’t boost national income, it merely redistributes it.""  Jobs 3   ""When the government attempts to create a job, all of these natural forces are removed. The market has produced no demand for the government-created job. In other words, no buyer has voluntarily agreed to purchase those services, because to do so under current market conditions would be unprofitable. Were it profitable to hire someone to do the government-created job, an employer would have done so voluntarily. So, the government steps in and forces the taxpayer to purchase those services against his will. In additional to violating the taxpayer’s rights, the entire coordination that existed between employer, employee, and consumer is disrupted. ""  Jobs 4   To illustrate further, this is what government does to destroy wealth or job creation because it thinks it can create jobs and wealth.  WATCH VIDEO    I agree (more or less) with the healthcare reforms, his overturning of policies involving Embryonic Stem Cells, the ""Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act"", ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010"" and his ending of the War in Iraq.   More insurance isn't going to contain costs in premiums and deductibles. It is only going be more expensive. When you buy a car, you pay for what you get. If you want a Mercedes E-Class, you have to pay for it compared to a Ford Fiesta. More coverage = more money. This is what the bill does, just more insurance.  As for Embryonic Stem Cells, it should be left to private research. Polo's cure was invented by a private scientist, not government, where in the goodness of his heart, he donated it without patents for profit.

I don't think so. While I would have preferred Saudi Arabia to Iraq, it still gives us a possible ally in the middle east (it's an Islamic State however, so that might be in vain). It also rooted out a number of terrorist factions in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The big disappointment is that we allowed them to make the state a theocracy. This means that there is a strong possibility that sectarianism will continue in Iraq long after our forces leave, and that the government will ultimately make an enemy of us.   Creating jobs and wealth is interchangeably linked because if jobs are created by producing an new good or service, then wealth is created, so in a capitalist economy, government has no assets to produce anything without taxation that is taken out of the private sector, government doesn't create jobs and wealth, it merely transfers jobs and wealth from private to public.    I think you contradicted yourself. If the creation of jobs is interchangeable with the creation of wealth, then it must follow that the government creates jobs (and wealth) whenever it creates new organisations (like NASA, the FBI, Military branches, etc.).

Sure, government employees received incomes, but it is at the expense of those who produce. Government employees don't produce anything new, they only take from the general public.

Taxation takes surplus wealth from producers and uses it to fund the creation of these things.   3. The worst source of additional government spending is creating new money either by simply printing more money or lower interest rates. Thus, this monetary event always results in inflation by eroding the value of the currency, and consequently, it started the Great Depression.   Right. Except for the last point.

Jobs 1   If the market works like Natural Selection, and businesses behave like animals, then Keynesian policy would merely be that which applies artificial pressure to the evolution of business. If this is true, then it follows that the market's behaviours can be changed to correct social problems like unemployment.   ""Governments have only three ways of paying employees — taxes, borrowing and printing money. Each of those reduces income and wealth among those paying taxes, servicing debts or stuck with shrinking greenbacks. In short, governments can't ""create jobs."" Adding government jobs is never a net addition to employment opportunities, because it means a heavier burden on private employers and employees. "" Jobs 2   If this is true, then private businesses may never create a net addition to employment opportunities because they produce a heavier burden on other private businesses and employees, because a private business ""charges money for a service (same as tax), borrows money (loans), and prints coupons (similar to printing money practically).""  What I would be interested in hearing is how a tax is different from a sale, practically speaking. I'm not interested in how you're compelled to pay tax, because force is irrelevant to the immediate equation, which is the creation of jobs (and wealth) through the trading of money.   ""When the government attempts to create a job, all of these natural forces are removed. The market has produced no demand for the government-created job. In other words, no buyer has voluntarily agreed to purchase those services, because to do so under current market conditions would be unprofitable.

"" Jobs 4   Force, either real or perceived, is irrelevant to the equation. Force only matters in a discussion about social rights. In the discussion about economics, what matters is that money changes hands.   To illustrate further, this is what government does to destroy wealth or job creation because it thinks it can create jobs and wealth. WATCH VIDEO   Those state sales permits and laws which prohibit business startup are usually motivated by business interests who wish to stifle competitors. It's how capitalism works in democracy.   More insurance isn't going to contain costs in premiums and deductibles. It is only going be more expensive. When you buy a car, you pay for what you get. If you want a Mercedes E-Class, you have to pay for it compared to a Ford Fiesta. More coverage = more money. This is what the bill does, just more insurance.   Right. We also needed it, since our healthcare coverage is so poor in this country.   As for Embryonic Stem Cells, it should be left to private research. Polo's cure was invented by a private scientist, not government, where in the goodness of his heart, he donated it without patents for profit.   Government-funded research exists because most research is costly and unprofitable to the private market. It is costly in the case of medicine because of laws imposed due to our lessons learned with free market medicine (remember Radithor and Snake Oil?) and due to the lack of ethics in general which existed (the Smallpox vaccine was tested by picking a vagrant child off the street and injecting him with the virus, for example). Polio's researchers and early efforts to make a vaccine used a similar lack of ethics: 3000 children were injected with an unsuccessful mixture which caused allergic reactions in some of them.  In other words: government takes over where private industry would fail or be less successful.  As to the stem cells: you can thank Bush for regulating stem cells in the first place. Obama rescinded his laws.   As for Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal, we will see how effective it is in the years to come. One way or another, I don't care. Military recruitment should be non compulsive and open to anyone regardless. Why does the government need to even know your sexual orientation? WHY RED TAPE!! That is irrelevant to a solider.   It didn't, and wouldn't ask, as long as you didn't provide it. However what happened was that many officers and recruits were discharged annually because they were spotted in gay clubs on shoreleave, or ""outed"" by malicious coworkers.   Again, you are an odd creature, you absolutely chastise business because it is inherently corrupt and greedy, but get all sympathetic for big business when they go bankrupt because of bad management. Where is your sympathy for when small bushiness goes out of business? There is none because that is business. Bad management equals failure, and you support it. No wonder you like government. You enjoy bad management.   I'm not sympathetic for big business. I care about the thousands (perhaps even millions) of employees who would lose their jobs, pensions, etc. because a handful of sociopaths gambled with the system. When you've worked your entire life in a career and you lose everything, it is tragic. I feel bad for the people.   Doesn't matter. It was still failure of government. It is central planning at its finest. A series of failures, but no sees that. It is government attempting to control to many things, and it fails.   I think it does an admirable job handling the roads, sewers, water, schools, medical research, space programs, and research.  I certainly know that only a state could afford a project as big as the Large Hadron Collider.   Looks like someone has a conspiracy, someone who doesn't engage in conspiracies.

Government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy. Government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means.

Are these organizations self funded through their own personal money?, No because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation, who is paid by private citizens. Government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money came from the private sector. It is government taking from private citizens.   Taxation takes surplus wealth from producers and uses it to fund the creation of these things.   There is no such as as surplus wealth. If government accounts for 40% of the 100% of the economy, that means that 60% of the economy must provide for 100% of the people because 40% is being transferred from private to public.  For instance, lets say I am a private citizen and you are government. I produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100% of the population, so you impose a tax of 5%, so now I only have 95 dollars. Next, you say that you will create more jobs. Where are you going to get it? Well, me because you don't possess any assets. So, you impose a tax of 10%, now, I only have 90 dollars. Now, you want more government jobs, impose 25%, now, I only have 75 dollars. Now, I have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector.   The great depression was caused by insider trading and corruption of the stock market.   No, The Great Depression was caused by failure in central bankers.    Milton    Milton    If the market works like Natural Selection, and businesses behave like animals, then Keynesian policy would merely be that which applies artificial pressure to the evolution of business. If this is true, then it follows that the market's behaviours can be changed to correct social problems like unemployment.  This only shows your lack of knowledge of Keynesian economics. It is not about fixing social problems.   If this is true, then private businesses may never create a net addition to employment opportunities because they produce a heavier burden on other private businesses and employees, because a private business ""charges money for a service (same as tax), borrows money (loans), and prints coupons (similar to printing money practically).""   OH MY GOD. Anyway. What Next?   What I would be interested in hearing is how a tax is different from a sale, practically speaking. I'm not interested in how you're compelled to pay tax, because force is irrelevant to the immediate equation, which is the creation of jobs (and wealth) through the trading of money.   Because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money, then they pay it back, government doesn't use its own money because it doesn't have any of its own, so any money it borrows, neither are they paying it back with your own money, that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers.  For instance, if a man wants to sell lemonade, he will get a loan from somewhere of 5 dollars. So, over the course of the summer, the man makes 15 dollars in revenue, but he must pay back the 5 dollars in loan, and now he has a profit of 10 dollars where he created new wealth and a job.  However, if government wants to sell lemonade, it must tax the man 5 dollars because it can't invest in anyone that of which it does not own because that is what it cost him to produce, so now, the child only only has a profit of 5 dollars, so the output is still 15 dollars, but it was transferred from private to public sector. Then, the 5 dollars that the government took, he could have reinvested and hired a partner to grow.   In the discussion about economics, what matters is that money changes hands.   And that money is who does the money belong to.   Those state sales permits and laws which prohibit business startup are usually motivated by business interests who wish to stifle competitors.   This is what I have been saying time and time again.   It's how capitalism works in democracy.   It's how corporatism works in democracy.   Right. We also needed it, since our healthcare coverage is so poor in this country.   Healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces, but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge.  If you wanted more expensive coverage, that is what you got. Congrats.   Government-funded research exists because most research is costly and unprofitable to the private market.   Never said that it is for only profit market. Research should be non profit.  Mayo Clinic is one of the most respected nonprofit medical research organizations in the world.   Polio's researchers and early efforts to make a vaccine used a similar lack of ethics: 3000 children were injected with an unsuccessful mixture which caused allergic reactions in some of them.    Well, they cured Polio. BUT  Your going to cry over the few for the many.  REMEMBER YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR GREATER GOOD.   Polio was a life threatening disease, and it is gone.   government takes over where private industry would fail or be less successful.   There is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so, because government has no competition, NASA, USPS (First class mail), and Education   As to the stem cells: you can thank Bush for regulating stem cells in the first place. Obama rescinded his laws.   Why do you keep assuming I applaud Bush? Those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research.   It didn't, and wouldn't ask, as long as you didn't provide it. However what happened was that many officers and recruits were discharged annually because they were spotted in gay clubs on shoreleave, or ""outed"" by malicious coworkers.   Again, this resorts to bad government military policy because before, you could get dishonorable discharge for being gay. This type of policy is stupid.    I'm not sympathetic for big business.   Despite your sentiments for the little guy, you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was, you think that they should be bailed out. Those workers would just find different jobs.   I think it does an admirable job handling the roads, sewers, water, schools, medical research, space programs, and research.   Well, Great! I am so glad that you feel proud of the progress that you support.    I certainly know that only a state could afford a project as big as the Large Hadron Collider.   I am certain that one man, Branson, will be able to provide space travel for any paying customer instead of the select few the government picks. Maybe, space travel may become as inexpensive that anyone will be able to fly and experience it.  By the way, you gave me a headache.

489	obama	K	60	57	1	oppose	aveskde	PrayerFails	"Answer these questions.  How is government funded? Does government possess any assets without taxation? Does government have any financial authority without taxation?   Technically speaking our government owns nothing because it is public, however practically speaking it owns its institutions and their collective works.  Does a business have any financial authority without charging a bill? In other words, speaking in the context of our discussion, taxation and a private bill are practically the same.   Government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy. Government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means.   It doesn't matter if a business generates income by itself, it matters if it generates it by exchange with others.   There is no transfer because government prohibits these types of jobs to the private sector by law.   Does not change the fact that they are not transferred jobs, but created ones.   Again, you only presume government is the only entity that can provide certain services. The private sector is may be unable to provide a service because of the laws prohibiting competition such as NASA or USPS.   Only the wealthiest oil corporations could hope to touch our military budget, and yet they fall short by about half. That is to say nothing of medical research, aerospace research and engineering, and physics research like the LHC which are all in addition to the military budget.   All of the employees who work at NASA or Defense, whose money is it that they are using. Are these organizations self funded through their own personal money?, No because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation, who is paid by private citizens. Government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money can from the private sector. It is government taking from private citizens.   They use their own money, which comes from providing a service to the public (taxes), through trade of goods (technology to the private sector and other governments).   There is no such as as surplus wealth. If government accounts for 40% of the 100% of the economy, that means that 60% of the economy must provide for 100% of the people because 40% is being transferred from private to public.   It really isn't that simple, because a portion of that 40% is often made accessible to the people in the form of student aid, welfare, unemployment, social security, schools, medicine, etc. The other 60% as utilised by the private sector is never distributed in a manner approaching equality and that is why you have one percent of the people holding fourty percent of it (which would mean as per your numbers that 1% of the people hold 16% of the nation's economy in their hands).  To answer your actual question however, what I mean by surplus wealth is that wealth which is beyond the living means of the owner.   For instance, lets say I am a private citizen and you are government. I produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100% of the population, so you impose a tax of 5%, so now I only have 95 dollars. Next, you say that you will create more jobs. Where are you going to get it? Well, me because you don't possess any assets. So, you impose a tax of 10%, now, I only have 90 dollars. Now, you want more government jobs, impose 25%, now, I only have 75 dollars. So, now, I have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector.   It's the same exact issue with private companies. If you have 100 dollars, and this is the total GDP, and a business charges you 5$ for medicine, you now have 95$ and the business has 5$. The business did not increase the GDP to 105$. Conservation of wealth, like conservation of energy.   Milton  Milton   I never cared for Milton Friedman's opinion. He's a bit of a nutter.   This only shows your lack of knowledge of Keynesian economics. It is not about fixing social problems.   Keynesian economics is merely the idea that government can intervene to stimulate the market where it is acting with reduced efficiency.   Because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money, then they pay it back, government doesn't use its own money because it doesn't have any of its own, so any money it borrows, neither are they paying it back with your own money, that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers.   You just explained how a government uses tax, and the behaviours surrounding government borrowing. What I'm interested in is the fundamental changing of hands which both sales and taxes employ.   And that money is who money does it belong to.   It would be the government's money, since they provided a service and you are paying for it.   It's how corporatism works in democracy.   Same thing.   Healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces, but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge.   The healthcare act is not socialised medicine. It is private medicine, which means that the ""rationed care"" you speak of is a capitalist phenomenon.   Well, they cured Polio. BUT  Your going to cry over the few for the many. REMEMBER YOU ARE A BIG ADVOCATE FOR GREATER GOOD.  Polio was a life threatening disease, and it is gone.   It is a matter of the ""welfare of the few, for the many"" because right now those bad ethics are wildly illegal. If they were not, it wouldn't be the few any longer but a large number of annual deaths and deformities caused by standard medical research practice.   There is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so, because government has no competition, NASA, USPS (First class mail), and Education   Most of them you hardly notice: roads, research, technological development, military, police, courts. Also: government put a man on the moon and a probe on mars. What has big business done for you?   Why do you keep assuming I applaud Bush? Those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research.   I don't.   Despite your sentiments for the little guy, you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was, you think that they should be bailed out. Those workers would just find different jobs.   Just wait until you get fired or laid off from your career at age fifty, and are desperate to find work for almost a year but no one hires you because you're old and they want new, young professionals. You really have no empathy for these people because you're too self-absorbed.  One other detail: since many thousands of them would be laid off, this means that the market would be suddenly flooded with people who have the same credentials, which means they would probably receive lower salaries on top of losing their retirement.   I am certain that one man, Branson, will be able to provide space travel for any paying customer instead of the select few the government picks. Maybe, space travel may become as inexpensive that anyone will be able to fly and experience it.   I'm not as hopeful, look at airline security and how often a plane crashes. I can just imagine the skies being littered with thousands of bodies due to cost-cutting and terrorists.

""I had an uncle who was part of the first American troops to go into Auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps."" The problem being...American troops did not liberate Aucshwitz, the Soviet Read Army did.

I have traveled to , lets see....uh....57 states with one left to go...with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii. So total that up.....57+1+1+ 1 left to go. ....60 American states wow...what a Harvard education he got.   And he pronounces Massatoosits........just like that.   ""Eau Claire is a beautiful state"" I believe its a city, he better check his map or better yet fire his speech writer.   He doesn't even know what states border eachother.

Then he says that he will be serving as president for 10 years. He doesn't even know how long a term is.   And show me one politician ever....that looks more like a boob than he does....in this video of him at the town hall meeting.  He doesn't even know the facts..........can't present them and people don't seem to care...

Considering that you are only looking at what is seen and not unseen. However, Ford maybe part of the unseen considering it didn't take a bailout, and it is still in business.  Losing of jobs would have been lost, but if an adjustable and corrective market, these people would have adapted.  As aforementioned, this $14 billion dollars is only estimates done by government, and government lie to fit thier agenda.   So, the real cost of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts demonstrate this.  A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has zero credibility. It pegged likely taxpayer losses in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts at $25 billion. For those with a sense of history, it is worth remembering that the S&L;bailout had a $160 billion price tag. The numbers diverge so far from reality as to be laugh-out-loud funny. Funny, that is, except that the CBO estimate demonstrates a willful disconnect with the actual consequences of federal government actions.  As demonstrated below, the real cost of the bailouts will easily exceed $1.3 trillion. In fact, the real cost is likely to range between $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion, and is not unlikely to reach $2.5 trillion.   Our only hope is to (1) accept up front a twenty-percent fall in American living standards for a people living beyond their means for the past twenty-five years on the delusions made possible by fiat money, and (2) simultaneously discipline the creature from Jekyll Island, a.k.a. the Federal Reserve System, not to create new money just to prop up asset-price bubbles. Mises    Ask Ford who didn't even take a bailout if it was worth it (in the story you linked to) to preserve the market and their supplier base, etc.   The CEO of Ford doesn't even understand that his own company one who didn't take the bailout is still in business because of good past decisions.

But anyway:  ""Save the auto industry""  We can debate the numbers, but you're not about that (clearly). So let's talk about the ideology of saving the auto industry. Or even better, simplify: Added to the Corporatist system of the United States. Same with bailing out the banks. And for shame... I thought you didn't like the corporations and all their money. Finally, they have a chance to fail and leave their business to bidders, and you support the legislation that keeps them ""too big to fail"".   ""Finally brave enough to fix our ridiculous health care system"".  Ridiculous indeed. We waste billions on medicare and medicaid, just to see that they are, in general, pathetic ways to help those in need. I don't disagree with you on that one. My problem is 1. Brave... like all the other presidents who were ""finally brave enough"" to do something about the healthcare system? INCLUDING BUSH! 2. Government hospitals and Universal Health-care... right, because government healthcare worked in this country all this time... oh wait, our health care system is ridiculous. Darn these intricate fallacies. BUT WAIT!!!! A voucher program, proposed by Paul Ryan, implying that government will continue to help people who are in need of medical care but can't afford it, but instead of choosing what kind of treatment the people will receive, they will be able to choose their coverage in the private sector. This is far better than subsidizing for subsidizing takes away incentive to compete and provide better coverage. But with the voucher program, the private sector will continue to compete for the only way for them to receive that money is if the people find them a suitable insurer. But that's too sensible, right? Nope, let's just get government more involved with running the healthcare system, because if cotton rips all the time, the only solution is MOAR cotton.  But another thing we can agree on, the Republican nominees are looking shitty. Gary Johnson and Ron Paul will most likely not get it, and Paul Ryan is dicking around.

He is a master manipulator and lied before the election and continues to do that today. He never would come clean about birth certificate until Trump went after him…then all of a sudden one pops up. ???? Was he really born in America?     He consistently lied about the war. In 2008 after the Democratic convention he stated that we had an “absolute obligation” to stay in Iraq that it would be a disservice to all who lost their lives there. ”The failure of the Iraqi state would be a disaster,” he said at a lunch sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “It would dishonor the 900-plus men and women who have already died. . . . It would be a betrayal of the promise that we made to the Iraqi people, and it would be hugely destabilizing from a national security perspective.” Yet he took a different stance while campaigning. He said one of the first things he would do would be to bring all the troops home and end the war. We all know that…that did not happen.  Is he, was he ever a Muslim? Well……he would like you to believe that he was not…but he has given many different answers to this question. Was he a constitutional law professor? He stated that he was and that’s why he knew the law better than Bush. That was a lie however as he was only a senior lecturer.   He can’t give a speech (with or without a teleprompter) and when he does its full of errors. Remember the Kansas tornado tragedy? He stated for the record that over 10,000 people died that an entire town was destroyed. Actually the town was ok and only 12 died.   He can’t figure out whether he is for decriminalizing pot or against it. He says what the audience wants to hear and did that to get votes. In a presidential debate he sided with most the other Demos…said he was against it. BUT later in a speech in Illinois to college students he said the opposite as he did in a debate at Northwestern University.  He lied about his pastor Rev. Wright (uncle to him, who baptized him and Michele and just happens to be godfather to his girls)….he never heard all those anti-white speeches, not a one.   And then there is Tony Rezko…..and Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn….and his staff who are self admitted socialists.     He said he never took a dime from a Washington lobbyist. Lie he did.   http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/ election2008/2008-04-15-obama_N.htm    Then he lied about tax cuts….denies attacking small businesses……all while he was raking in money, political contributions from those associated with Fannie and Freddie.     Tell me what he has ever done for the middle class?     He hates Israel. Gee I wonder why? Maybe because he bowed to a Saudi King, maybe because he studied the Koran when he attended Islamic schools….oh yes that’s right he is Christian.   He sure did not learn history at Harvard. He has no idea how many states there are in the United States where he just happens to be commander in chief.

An economic bubble is commonly used term to describe an economic or business cycle that is best characterized by the rapid expansion followed by the contraction in a economy often times in dramatic fashion.    I am pretty sure that I said that before because I explained it in a previous statement. ""Economic trough is consequence of a business cycle after there was a peak in expansion.

The fact is, people without insurance have a 45% higher chance of dying earlier because they don't have insurance. Just about everyone  wants  insurance, again, it is not an issue of ""personal freedom"" and if you've let the trillion dollar insurance industry trick you into thinking that you've been duped.  3. It's absolutely nothing like your example of homeowners insurance, and I think you know that. As you keep complaining the situation is more like making homeowner insurance mandatory for everyone, thus lowering the cost for everyone, thus if the house does catch on fire your life isn't ruined and you do not become a burden on society.  4. I find the assumption that only the ""irresponsible"" don't have insurance very offensive. The vast majority of the uninsured work full time jobs but cannot afford it.  5. Only the healthy think their insurance is any good. There is a very high possibility that before this bill was passed, if you were seriously ill your insurance would have found a reason not to cover or to only cover a portion. It happens/ did happen all of the time.  6. The number one cause of bankruptcy is illness. The majority of these people who go bankrupt thought they had good insurance until they got sick. This is a huge burden on our economy, and now it won't be.  7. Again, like I've explained to Joe a hundred times, the only way  your  insurance is going to change if you are already insured is it will be less expensive, you will get rebates if 85% of the money you pay hasn't been used for health reasons, and your insurance won't be allowed to look for ways to not cover you because of ""pre-existing"" conditions.  All this fear rhetoric running amok, I haven't seen a single piece of evidence any of it is founded.  In fact, every other country that has some type of Universal care has better healthcare than the US and they pay less for it.  There is no real life example that says otherwise.

609	obama	M	56	55	-1	oppose	iamdavidh	iamdavidh	"I'm going to address these concerns starting with your last point:  5. When speaking of fear rhetoric, I'm not talking about your argument specifically, but all of the death panel BS and socialist take-over nonsense the tea-baggers spew, whom consequently make up the majority of the opposition and all of the death threats, bricks through windows, etc.  The 1.05 trillion dollar price tag is nominal, but not that nominal. They are pretty sure it will be between 1 trillion and 1.5 trillion...  over ten years.  That is less money than one year of the Iraq war and instead of killing people we are saving them.  4. That simply is not true. Rationing should only exist when resources are limited, however the difference is, the insurance industry has had plenty of resources. In fact even in this economy they have continued turning out record profits while at the same time covering less people. Since we didn't go with the single payer system for some mysterious reason, the next best thing is to legally demand the private companies we will still be getting our insurance from are legally obligated to insure.  I don't doubt they will still find ways to let people die for a profit, but at least it will be harder for them to do.  3. Sounds like propaganda, no offense. They  say  they will have to raise rates, but I don't believe them. They may  want  to raise rates, but they won't be allowed to because now they must spend 85% of the money they receive directly on healthcare or they will lose their license to provide insurance. My guess is they will actually be forced to lower rates since only something like 10% goes toward actual healthcare now.  2. It is hard to argue, and some I'm sure really do have good insurance. But again, the majority of these bankruptcies are people who  thought  they had good insurance. The trend seems show the comment to be correct.  1. You cover a lot ground with this comment. First I believe you have an unfair negative view of mandates. For example government mandates hospitals maintain a minimum standard of cleanliness, as a result things like the black plague are far less common. Could there have been a time when one argued such a ""government mandate"" would never work. I almost guarantee someone somewhere made that argument. There may be bad mandates, I believe though that in light of no public option (which I'd prefer actually) mandating a certain level of business ""cleanliness"" as it were is the next best option.  As for subsidies. Of course if everyone is covered that would be inescapable, at least until everyone is in the system then maybe even the poorest will be able to afford healthcare because of a larger pool, but that aside, in the meantime it is essential. I would say though, that subsidizing say a breast exam which finds a stage 1 tumor, is ultimately less expensive than not finding the problem until the woman goes to the emergency room during stage 3. We're talking a $2,000 dollar procedure to remove a tumor against hundreds of thousands of dollars of treatment we would be subsidizing anyway when she goes to the emergency room. And then there is the whole thing about the woman's life and all.  And your last sentence, I actually have nothing to lose. I'm an independant contractor so pay a disproportionately high tax rate compared to income already and still don't have health insurance. But if I did receive a paycheck, I would be extatic that more of the money that is taken out will go toward healthcare instead of the Insurance money machine. I'm pretty sure everyone will be paying less in the long term. The fact is, most people don't get that sick, so if you have a bunch of people paying into a system, it is pretty simple to cover the people who do get sick, or oneself if they are the unlucky one.  That is how insurance is  supposed  to work anyway. All this does is take some steps to make sure the insurance companies can't cheat anymore. I almost guarantee, in light of the 85% law, and in light of the fact that the millions of people like myself who are relatively healthy but still simply could not afford it are now going to be paying into the system, everyone's insurance is going to go down not up.

Blah, I moved a decimal, you're right. I feel that they cost just as much is as solid a point as the wars costing more, either way it's more wasteful imo.  Plus, again, we won't know for a few years, but every country that has done something similar actually pays less for healthcare, than the US  link  - scroll down to see a chart, you'll be amazed. I think there is something lost in our translation following the money trail, much of that cost isn't an increase, it's a shift into where the money is coming from and how it is tracked. ie, today when one without insurance goes to the emergency room it is not a cost but a debt. A large part of the 1-1.5 trillion  cost  represents that shift. We're paying for emergency room visits now anyway in other words, we just don't count it. Either way we're indebted to China, but that's another issue entirely and I don't believe this will effect that long term one way or another.  3. As a matter of fact, I think a Medicare for all system would be the most cost-effective route. As for incentive to stay in business,  link  - they'll still be the second richest people in the land next to banks even with new regulations.  4. Well, the problem with claiming that it is somehow illegal to mandate purchasing healthcare is that you can use the same logic that you use for ""everyone wants a clean hospital."" In that ""everyone wants to go to the doctor when they are sick."" Again, the problem is a lack of imagination on the part of the healthy I think. The fact is, just as many people, when sick, want insurance as want a clean hospital I would argue. If approached as a mandate for private consumption, as in say ""it is the law of the land you buy candy"" sure, unconstitutional as hell. However, they will take the taxation approach I believe.

Considering he won by a greater margin than any candidate in recent history pretty much proves race did not play a role.  The reason he actually won by more than Bill Clinton, the last Democratic President, is because there was a greater overall turnout.

This requires knowledge of 2 things -   First, an understanding of a property of money - fungibility.  To illuminate: if a woman gets federal money, e.g. a student loan, a pell grant, etc. and puts the money in a bank account and later gets an abortion using funds in that bank account, it does not mean that federal money subsidized the abortion.  Second, what was actually in the bill:   ""specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account.  On top of that, the national health care law gives states an opt-out of abortion coverage altogether. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose.""    http://www.politifact.com/florida/ statements/2011/mar/17/matt-gaetz/ taxpayer-funded-abortions-federal-healt h-care-bill/

651	obama	N	33	22	1	oppose	JustIgnoreMe	Witchypoo	"No signing statements to nullify or undermine congressional instructions as enacted into law    Here is Obama's full memo:   Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies     SUBJECT: Presidential Signing Statements     For nearly two centuries, Presidents have issued statements addressing constitutional or other legal questions upon signing bills into law (signing statements). Particularly since omnibus bills have become prevalent, signing statements have often been used to ensure that concerns about the constitutionality of discrete statutory provisions do not require a veto of the entire bill.     In recent years, there has been considerable public discussion and criticism of the use of signing statements to raise constitutional objections to statutory provisions. There is no doubt that the practice of issuing such statements can be abused. Constitutional signing statements should not be used to suggest that the President will disregard statutory requirements on the basis of policy disagreements. At the same time, such signing statements serve a legitimate function in our system, at least when based on well-founded constitutional objections. In appropriately limited circumstances, they represent an exercise of the President's constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and they promote a healthy dialogue between the executive branch and the Congress.     With these considerations in mind and based upon advice of the Department of Justice, I will issue signing statements to address constitutional concerns only when it is appropriate to do so as a means of discharging my constitutional responsibilities. In issuing signing statements, I shall adhere to the following principles:   1.The executive branch will take appropriate and timely steps, whenever practicable, to inform the Congress of its constitutional concerns about pending legislation. Such communication should facilitate the efforts of the executive branch and the Congress to work together to address these concerns during the legislative process, thus minimizing the number of occasions on which I am presented with an enrolled bill that may require a signing statement.   2.Because legislation enacted by the Congress comes with a presumption of constitutionality, I will strive to avoid the conclusion that any part of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional. In exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional, I will act with caution and restraint, based only on interpretations of the Constitution that are well-founded.   3.To promote transparency and accountability, I will ensure that signing statements identify my constitutional concerns about a statutory provision with sufficient specificity to make clear the nature and basis of the constitutional objection.   4.I will announce in signing statements that I will construe a statutory provision in a manner that avoids a constitutional problem only if that construction is a legitimate one.  To ensure that all signing statements previously issued are followed only when consistent with these principles, executive branch departments and agencies are directed to seek the advice of the Attorney General before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this memorandum as the basis for disregarding, or otherwise refusing to comply with, any provision of a statute.  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

The sharp decrease in unemployment was due to the number of people who stopped getting unemployment benefits after looking for employment for years. Note: you are only counted as unemployed if you are still actively looking for a job. How did he single-handedly save the U.S. auto industry? The deaths of the 22 Al Queda Heads were the cause of the hard-working men and women in the military. Not sure how he's even indirectly responsible for that. How has he improved relations with other countries? Afghanistan still hates us (probably because we're invading them, but no one wants to talk about that war), Iraq hates us more than ever since we left, as soon as we got out of Iraq, Iran decides to start talking about a possible conflict with the U.S, and Israel is starting to hate us as a direct result from Obama's foreign policy on Israel. He isn't a small spender. Fact: he has spent more money in 3 years than any other president has in 8 (that counts inflation). And just to top it off, he's spent more money on vacations than any other president. I do believe his last Hawaiin vacation costs $4 million, 99.7% of it being taxpayer dollars. Do your research man.

I am going to vote for him again in the coming election because he is our best chance and has done a good job thus far - just look at the job growth - the sluggishness of the markets and this effect on job growth and economic prosperity has nothing to do with him and his efficacy as a president - the conditions of our economic environment both domestically and internationally are the biggest influence in our slow recovery   Insofar as the economy goes, Bush didnt cause the collapse, but he did increase the national debt for these two not fully thought out wars (which we havent really won even though we have made some significant positive changes in the region).

I'm not sure how this addresses anything I just said. In fact I'm fairly certain it doesn't; The cause of the 'economic demise' was never in question, but you did just completely side-step my contention. The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.  Point being you can't blame someone for high unemployment when you personally prevented them from solving the problem, without being the world's biggest hypocrite.   To suggest that the auto industry was on the verge of collapse is a hypothetical   No it's not, it was a mathematical equation. GM had been in continuous decline for over a decade. It was 17 months from bankruptcy and a 46% chance of defaulting within the next 5 years. GM already filed for chapter 11, and was selling off most of it's assets. To deny this is the utmost absurdity.  The Math is here:   http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm   Bankruptcy here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization    bankruptcy is vital to capitalism because it disposes of waste.   Yeah, and that waste was millions of employees, without whom would have meant unprecedented levels of unemployment not seen since the great depression, which would have taken almost a decade or more to recover from.   GM didn't pay off the loan. They merely shifted money from the escrow account to the loan.       In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.  ""To me, money is fungible,"" he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.  ""It's a genuine paying back,"" White said. ""It does reduce the federal government's involvement."" Still, he said, ""it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate"" with the U.S. government.

Which is still a good sign.   All of which were created by bad government policy before.   Yeah, like the irresponsible deregulation of the housing and banking markets. When you repeal laws that prevent downright criminal business practices, this can have a detrimental effect. I don't share your faith, the private sector can fail, and history is our proof of this. If you allow multi-million dollar businesses to pilfer people of their savings and their homes, that is exactly what they will do and that is exactly what happened in 2008.

Now common sense can tell you that when you don't have any money, you need to stop spending as much. The Republicans won't agree with him because he spends way too much and won't negotiate.

John McCain had lost to the first major party endorsed African-American presidential candidate in United States history. We finally closed troubling chapters in our history such as Mississippi burning and the civil rights marches of Selma.  Republicans, including the bewildered Religious Right, sat stunned in their seats wondering what would happen to their country. It was not because the Democratic Party was any different from the Bush Administration but because the GOP had pathetically lost its neo-conservative bully pulpit in the White House.  Democrats cheered with glee at the opportunity to take back the power that was theirs during the Clinton Glory Days. They salivated at the prospect of re-introducing neo-liberal interventionism on foreign soil and overseas markets They longed to once again crank the Dollar presses to inflate the money supply in the name of the ""poor"" this time instead of ""business"". They would gladly finish the work of the Fall of the American Empire started under the Bush Regime.  And now, the smoke and mirrors game goes on. The crooked politicians of 2009 are no different than the corrupt politicians of the Gilded Age or the Roaring Twenties. Crony capitalists like oil barons and railway tycoons then lined the pockets of our nation's representatives to further the goals of Big Business and destroy the wealth of American workers. Sound familiar?  President Obama had a unique opportunity in history -- and he blew it. He brought us ""change"" indeed. He slammed the Bush Doctrine in all its ugly forms of secrecy and judicial obstruction into executive hyper-drive. The rhetoric of compassionate conservative now became the drivel of compassionate liberalism.  If there is one thing Americans say about Obama it is this: he cares.  He cares for the mechanic in Detroit who lost his job. He cares for the middle-aged couple living in the Hooverville tent outside Sacramento. He cares for the middle class mother and her three kids in Toledo spending their nights in a homeless shelter with the addicted and the ignored.  But does Obama really care?  In fact, his compassionate liberalism runs so deep that it pulls a move from the old Ronald Reagan playbook we knew as trickle-down economics. These days the compassionate White House grants bail-out money to financial monsters like AIG and Bank of America. There could be no better help for the American veteran shivering under a bridge tonight because there just aren't any more jobs. (Unless of course, you can beat out the 200 other people applying for that one lonely job opening.) The idea is that bail-out money will sooner or later trickle-down to the great unwashed masses of Americans wondering what in Sam Hill happened to the real estate market and their retirement accounts.   It may only be a drop of financial bail-out -- but hey it trickled down. Next up, bread lines!  The truth is that the White House allowed corporate giant CEOs to loot and pilfer the public treasury. This Administration is following the same tortured logic of the previous one which assured us that falsely accused cab drivers from Baghdad were receiving comfortable attention at Guantanamo Bay.  The left-right political paradigm in this country is a sham. (Sorry to disappoint my fellow Evangelical Christians.) Both parties have proven to be Big Business, Big Government warmongers. For those who actually wished McCain had been elected just think about this: the GOP would have put up no opposition to the new President's Stimulus Package and would have rammed through trillions more in ""help"" for America.  So there you have it. President Obama is as bad as the worst conservative and as bad as the worst liberal -- and all with a smile.  How is the left-right scenario a sham? Consider the following.  The gay rights issue is a political distraction. Stem cell research? Just more Big Research pork-barrel spending. Abortion? It's the political Gordian Knot that requires even the most astute of political science majors to bust a gut if they dare try to untie it. The so-called immigration invasion? A typical act of sensational yellow journalism that says, ""Look over there, Bubba! It ain't your own government stealin' your hard-earned dollars, it's them Mexicans lookin' for revenge and dishwasher jobs since the Alamo!"" Sorry, Pat Buchanan, the ""Death of the West"" comes from the corruption in our government, not the immigrants heading back home in record numbers.  What are the real issues of post-election America? For starters, the destruction of individual wealth in this country, save for the high upper class. We are on the verge of an economic meltdown that will dwarf the Great Depression and will take decades to recover. There is no need for a conspiracy theory here -- only the urgency of understanding the mess that we allowed to happen and how we can financially protect ourselves.  We must not waste time. We must move our already-compromised and over-valued U.S. Dollars into assets of real value. This does not include real estate unless you're buying ten cents or less on the high-priced dollar. Forget your 401(k), pensions and your annuities. Unless you can take your money out, they are toast. The stock market is one toxic graveyard, particularly finance shares. Dump them. Invest in precious metals, food supply, cigarettes, alcohol and medicine for trade and help for your neighbors when the Dollar collapses.  Consider buying silver, palladium and gold from reputable sellers like apmex.com. I personally recommend silverbullion.com because I support the goals of the owner Jason Hommel to bring silver back as the most effective medium of exchange. Remember, that despite the U.S. Treasury's naked assertions, the U.S. Constitution expressly reserves the right of individual States to mint legal tender coins so long as they're gold or silver.  When the dollar collapses, I do not think that New York City will burn or that the United States will come to an immediate end. But if it did, the blame must rest entirely on Barack Obama and his Congressional Criminal Syndicate.  Some might here criticize me as being unfair. After all, George W. Bush The Evangelical nearly bankrupted this country with his illegal wars, his blatant lies to stir Americans to bloodshed, his deliberate obstruction to the 9/11 Commission, his last-minute corporate bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions, his economic tinkering with interest rates, his unconscionable acts of torturing innocent men and children, his doubling of the national debt, et cetera, et cetera.   But let me be clear about this. George W. Bush is a public menace. He and his cadre must be tried and convicted of their crimes. But that will never happen under an Obama Presidency, in spite of the President's left-leaning brand of crony capitalism. The Truth Commission currently at play in the Congress is merely a circus show to fool Americans into thinking that we actually take seriously the crimes of torture, invasion, occupation, mayhem, pillaging, looting, rape, pollution, perjury, bribery and killing of civilians with illegal weapons of war.  Every moment that the Obama Administration rolls on without prosecuting the crimes of the former Administration, it exists as a de facto confirmation that our new President has sold out to the rich and that he lied to his Democratic base and the American voter. The White House today has continued in the same deadly bait-and-switch tactics of the former Village Idiot-In-Chief. Additionally, Obama has moved to control more media and aggressively solidify relationships with members of the ""War and Bankers Party"" on both sides of the aisle.  For a President to vociferously take on Rush Limbaugh the GOP's talk radio attack dog is an alarming signal. Besides the fact that the Democrats want to point out the weakness of the GOP's leadership vacuum, Obama is inserting himself into the realm of media and entertainment instead of focusing on how his office can uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution in light of the economic crisis. Are we really so surprised to see the leftist authoritarian Hugo Chavez, who is a regular media personality, cheer Obama in his nationalization and socialization of the banking and insurance industries?  Evangelical Christian radio stations are scared stiff about the Democratic-led Congress reviving restrictions on Americans to share their religious opinions over the people's airwaves. And they should be concerned. (I particularly enjoy my local station.) After all, the same kind of government that monitors, censors, filters and controls any form of media is the same type of authoritarianism that steals, plunders and coerces its own people. One look at China's control of the internet and Google's sickening overture to that regime is enough to make any civil libertarian's skin crawl. Reports that Australia is considering Chinese-style filtering over what their people can access on the internet makes me want to boycott eucalyptus leaves.  So why is President Obama responsible for our economic debacle?  Because it's the first rule of leadership. Everything is your fault. If he didn't like the prospect of being stuck with the mess of his predecessor he should have remained in the Senate or considered an honest living like working for AIG or Lehmann Brothers. Obama has not only repeated the same unconstitutional trespasses of Bush II, but he actually increased the amount of corporate welfare to the Bank Barons. Obama turned a blind eye to the Federal Reserve's arbitrary usury practice through the printing of increasingly worthless U.S. Dollars.  Are we really going to see a Dow Jones 4000? The answer is regrettably yes -- and then some. There are economic forces at play that will no longer be ignored or manipulated. Human behavior will always gravitate towards self-preservation and the protection of our future generations through wealth-building, capital, production and labor. All the paper fiat money and government spending in the world can never stop that or help this economic disaster recover without drastic corrections to our own cursed speculative market. The times of fast and easy money are over.  President Obama has not even finished his first year in office and I must already call him out as one of the worst Executives ever in the history of our Republic. Bush II is close behind. Every GOP and Democratic elected leader that voted for any of these crooked bail-outs deserves a one-way ticket to an electoral defeat. Should state law allow it, a public tar-and-feathering might be in order.  When our country faced economic dangers, depressionary woes and international volatility let it be said that President Obama failed to protect us from the corruption of Congress, the indifference of the Judiciary and the foolishness of the People. Let it be said that he abandoned his post to uphold the Constitution. Let it be said that he whored his policies and his office for the rich and powerful, both foreign and domestic. Let it be said that we voted for change and all we got was the Raw Deal of the Obama Failure obama is a failure
