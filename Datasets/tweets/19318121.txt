@anjell1913 Great point on ferpa.  I was thinking it would give parents an opportunity to see just how hard our educators work, what they deal with and also that their kids are safe, and in the rare occasion one is in trouble and parent blames teacher they can see for themselves.‚ù§Ô∏è
@anjell1913 This is a powerful tool. As a parent I‚Äôd love to see this in every classroom allowing parents to odserve and hear what is going on in their children‚Äôs classrooms as well. It would bring an entire new level to education and accountability for students and educators alike.

@cole_sandlin @USRepGaryPalmer How many debts have you paid off by reducing the amount of your payment. Take a look at this nations debt. Will you be offering jobs to those who lost there‚Äôs as your pharmacy? Many of them had family‚Äôs to support and homes to pay for.

So after watching the SOTU and listeing to it all, one of many things that grabbed my ear was POTUS braging about the Tax cuts, and how it will save and create Jobs. Now since that Sams Club in Irondale alabama has shut down, 100's of ameircans lost thier jobs. help me understand

@cityofbhamal it's time he stand with us &amp; show his support so I can tell my little boy we do live In a city that loves us all.
@cityofbhamal last year he offered a proclamation he said he would read at pride for the community. He never showed or called.
@cityofbhamal it's important he shows he supports us, his citizens, his voters. He never showed at pride last year either.
@cityofbhamal as a black man the mayor knows what discrimination feels like all to well. We would stand with him and show our support 2 him.
@cityofbhamal 2-3 weeks ago. We had people attend who lost limbs, in wheel chairs and on crutches.
@cityofbhamal where was mayor and Citi council at vigil? Gay tax dollars? Pandering?

@GovernorBentley I've noticed when I'm in Montgomery we have plenty of reserved parking for you all &amp; we tax payers have to park far away..
@GovernorBentley it seems the only cut backs come at the expense of the working class, the ones paying you all.
@GovernorBentley you could save our state money woud be to stop using the tax payer funded jet.. how about a train or car? You have security
@GovernorBentley alabama has been working toward it our elected officals, not so much.
@GovernorBentley funds short fall because you and many others in this state keep spending.
@GovernorBentley wanna help alabama? Don't like the heat? Resign. Walk away. It's time to rebuild Alabama, clearly you cant.
@GovernorBentley and let's not forget when Clinton left the white house the frist time we where ahead. Clearly Hillary was in charge then.
@GovernorBentley we'd be better off with her than we would a man who cheats on his wife with a married woman.
