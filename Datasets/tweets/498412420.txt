@GOP Cohen appeared to be mesmerized by Trump's confidence, belief in self power added with Trump's ability of  subliminal messaging to everyone in his circle. Power of suggestions &amp; use of subliminal messaging by Trump appears to be common thread stated by those who've had contact

@tlj7295 @TheeDukeNukem @MarkDice @KamalaHarris So Transgender are people who just decide out of nowhere I no longer desire to be a man or woman &amp; wish to have a sex assignment?  I've been told at early ages they knew they were born in wrong body.
@blockenbracket @HJextor @TheeDukeNukem @MarkDice @KamalaHarris I just believe that's an opinion based upon the information I have gathered. But that too is an opinion. I do not know a Transgender do you?
@blockenbracket @HJextor @TheeDukeNukem @MarkDice @KamalaHarris That's very harsh statement in which I do not agree with
@tlj7295 @TheeDukeNukem @MarkDice @KamalaHarris Do you know a Transgender personally. I have reached out on my feed for a response but have not received one. I don't know personally since I don't know a Transgender. Therefore I can only rely on what I read or those who know personally
@blockenbracket @HJextor @TheeDukeNukem @MarkDice @KamalaHarris Not true. I believe whatever you say should be able to be researched so that I may make my own decision that I can be confortable with. Should I engage with an individual I try to explore their reasoning for better understanding.  I have learned from our engagement &amp; understand

@realDonaldTrump Why do you lie so much? NY Times is not failing only you are as a man and as a leader of a country. Tired of your whining and crying like a baby. Time to change your diaper and give you a bottle to shut up and go to bed. Enough with the BS
@realDonaldTrump Didn't see that your way during your Helsinki performance; More like Treason to support a foreign country over your countries intelligence. You lost my respect &amp; perhaps many others. You were truly a Putin Puppet
@realDonaldTrump What are you afraid of if they lied? seems like there is more going on than the public is privy to. Is that why you shut the government down? More Obstruction of Justice by not funding the budget so that your crimes won't be revealed by @FBI and Muller's investigation.Disgraceful
@realDonaldTrump There are more crooks in the White House and Republican Legislation than arrested at the border. Plenty of indictments and convictions to prove it
@realDonaldTrump America has been watching a fake president for 2 years whose decisions hinges on the latest @FoxNews commentary
@realDonaldTrump You created that Humanitarian crises by not knowing how to be diplomatic and working with other countries that you called "Shit Holes" You have failed at being a leader and showing leadership. can't wait for 2020.
@realDonaldTrump Tired of Trump Lies and deflections. You have shutdown the government to protect yourself from FBI Investigation of your treason and Mueller Investigation of your activities with Putin. You finally found a way around Obstruction of Justice. You're an unethical coward

This is for clean energy. States who are drilling oil experience earthquakes &amp; sink holes this is alternative fuel/ energy
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer We're guessing at their intent &amp; actually it's can be argued from anyone's point of view. America must do what's in the best interest of Country 1st then the people. Security is necessary,  recycling &amp; conservation is necessary &amp; we must protect land that reproduces food.
@PreetBharara We're at a pardon the pun Mexican stand off. But realistically we should not build a wall unless Trump secures 2020 election. If not what will the next president do scrap the wall &amp; for what. American tax payers can't afford wall. We need security but the wall isn't feasible now.
@DFillmore52 @funder @realDonaldTrump Trump was allowed to lie without repercussions for 2 years by @GOP. He is under impression that he can do what he wants without oversight. This is the stand off. It is not the wall but the will of getting my way. Trump is throwing a tantrum to get his way at expense of Americans

@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer No, it was McConnell who stopped him from announcing the interference
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer That's politics. We are not politicians getting briefings to know why these things happen. We should let experts do their jobs unless proven unsuitable which has happened by Rule of Law &amp; via indictments &amp; convictions
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer Yes they will. Just like you and those who support Trump should do as all should do. When Trump does good we should say so &amp; let him know that was good thing but when Trump does bad we should also say so not defend his bad behavior. Open your minds let go of partisan thoughts
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer They're over sensitive as said but can you blame them from some of the activity that has happened?  Everyone must look in mirror &amp; accept responsibility for their failures and actions. This doesn't fall one 1 person. We all have played a part in the deconstruction of civility
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer It is what it is. Who are we to decide what one chooses to be? Boundaries must be maintained between people's rights &amp; claims of heritage. She wants to be of Native American descent who am I to deny that claim?. We must temper ourselves to inside voices.
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer Not it's not rediculous. It did happen.  We must understand how &amp; why so we are never influences by a hostile nation again. They played a major part in dividing us into political parties who oppose each other. Are you aware they Organized Charlottesville or clashes Americans?
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer Everyone needs to calm down.  There needs to be open dialog in Congress for legislation to reform immigration &amp; How to secure the border bipartisan. Then they need to present that proposal to Trump.  The lines are crossed. Need to  seperate Executive &amp; Legislative branches
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer I believe Trump should have kept his campaign promise to hire the best people. Had that be done I believe we would not be where we are today.
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer She submitted proof she has American Indian heritage. Personally I believe it shouldn't have mattered. We are all Americans despite our heritage.
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer That is to be investigated by Mueller &amp; a Report issued based on Facts, indictments &amp; convictions. I have an opinion but does it make it right? Answer is no. Rule of Law makes it right. We must not take politics to such extremes. That is why we hold elections.
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer That's the problem. Democrats believe Trump is unstable &amp; changes his mind with whomever has his ear at time. Must be agreed upon immediately with contract signed or it will not get done at all. Trump will hear @FoxNews &amp; change mind
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer Everyone knows border needs to be secure the question is how. They also want legislation.  We are so busy yelling no one is listening. The Democrats &amp; Republicans are saying same thing but it's material &amp; how they are not agreeing on. Should be based on scientific research
@DFillmore52 @funder @realDonaldTrump I understand but we do not have all the facts. Until Mueller's investigation has ended &amp; a full report is provided to the American people we are presumptive with bits &amp; pieces. I do ride on the side of Trump's guilt but again that's an opinion not quite based in all of the facts.
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer I will agree about unacceptance of Trump as President.  But I believe Trump brought that on himself. Once he became president he should have stopped America from their divisive behavior day 1. He continued drawing lines &amp; divisive behavior which widened the divide further.
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer We are looking at wall being started &amp; New election 2020. Should Trump secure 2020 then build wall we are guaranteed it will be completed not started then abandoned by next president
@Gimpmaker @insaneknight85 @CaitE_Writer I agree we need border security but a wall is antique &amp; will need maintenance at cost. There are better &amp; less costly ways to secure border by technology.  There are electronic fences that alert via signaling also can be armed armed well. It's about cost &amp; efficiency not security

@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Totally unfair that Trump didn't live up to his campaign promise to have Mexico pay for the wall. 65% of Americans do not want to pay for that addition to the already 3.5 Trillion dollar Trump deficit. That is not fair to expect them to pay for something they never voted for.
Trump will say anything to get his campaign promise through. That is not the responsibility of American people. Mexico was to pay for the wall. Either Mexico does or Trump is the failure we always knew he was. Trump has no negotiation skills what so ever https://t.co/gXTIkD55g9

RT @glenn_wofford: @watsupwitthatms @Gimpmaker @NRA Interesting report here...	https://t.co/OSd4SlEcUC
I am having an interesting discussion on Gun Control &amp; was sent this Report. I believe all those who are interested should read this. It is a beginning dialog that we should have &amp; address. I appreciate your input. #Resist	https://t.co/xzKkNH37ub
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA Thank you so much. I appreciate
@RepSwalwell Trump would not believe it if it jumped up &amp; bit him in the ass
RT @RepSwalwell: Does someone want to tell him? https://t.co/65uMdUmq3O
@AirCop264 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA If you followed the thread I admitted I was unaware of that information but stated I would research. Do you know?
@Snow_Granny @MuslimAdvocates Why would you call truth BS?
RT @joncoopertweets: Donald Trump might be the dumbest president the US has ever had 		#MoronTrump  https://t.co/plBlkOeDT3
@joncoopertweets Im embarrassed for my country that Trump chooses to be ignorant by not surrounding himself with the best scholars with knowledge of deplomacy,  Constitution,  Government  &amp; Legislative branches along with policies, practices and proceedures. He also needs a spokesman &amp; never talk
@Brian64441918 @JeffAlerman @idontcare543 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA I understand that we have the laws that are needed but they are not being enforced. We must connect with our local law enforcement &amp; legislators to ensure that they are mindful of these laws
@SpeakerRyan has left a bad stain as a @GOP Speaker of the House. It is good that he finally retired. His legacy will be he was a failure as a legislator. https://t.co/Jzvv0nxrqu
@AirCop264 @idontcare543 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA What do you suggest. I am making suggestions
Facts,do not matter in the Trump Administration. We must hold our President to the normal standards we require from our Children, spouses &amp; friends. Tell the truth. It is sad that our @realDonaldTrump  chooses to lie without need &amp; continously to America https://t.co/vAs3VedVd7
@FuzzyBlueOG @alexglockbarre1 @idontcare543 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA I agree, we need behavioral Health incorporated in our school system. I believe our teachers know those who pose threats. Teachers school be able to make referrals to the students counselors that will review the referral &amp; take appropriate steps of referrals proper to assessment
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA @HouseGOP @SenateGOP	or @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems should legislate a law against false reporting of facts by any media that distributes information to public that has government oversight including politicians &amp; government employees or contrators. Ethics must be re incorporated
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I believe @Gimpmaker has the best idea by an automatic 15yr term for use of gun in commission of a crime
@JeremiahNeral @danthe727man @RepSwalwell @NRA The purpose is to detect mental illnesses &amp; threats by an algorithm
@PCVelteIV @idontcare543 @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA The purpose was to detect guns before they made it into the schools by metal detectors,  dogs trained to detect certain scents with guards &amp; facial recognition at each entrance &amp; Exit.
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I agree we need truth. Good evening.
Of course he does. That's why he got a pass to rat everyone out who committed what amounts to treasonous activities. Be glad when Mueller's investigation is completed &amp; all wrong doings against Americans &amp; Country has been revealed https://t.co/NOvErioSgn
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I vote for whatever works. I'm not sure yet of the reasons
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I'm not sure but lawlessness is not the way.
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I like C Span then watch all others including local
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I believe Trump showed us what works. They're 1 tweet away. See he has done some good all agencies now tweet &amp; have Facebook pages
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA It's not media it's people's fault for not looking for facts.  I am guilty of that too. But I will know truth after researching facts &amp; statistics thanks to you both taking the time to educate me. Thank you. I am in hopes that our conversation inspires others to seek truth
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA We have learned our votes matter. We can remove then upon will should they not work in our best interest. They need our votes
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA That I can agree on
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA Really alarming to hear. Sounds like manipulation of the people's thoughts &amp; opinions
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA We thought that as well but lips a re tight here
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA Just sad. You would think we would have evolved from this type of violence. We are responsible to do better by putting pressure on our law enforcement agencies and law makers to enforce our laws we currently have to see where we are &amp; stand.
Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Hasenpfeffer Incorporated. RIP Penny Marshall you brought joy into my life.
RT @dbongino: Comey to Congress: "Who Cares" Who Paid for the Anti-Trump Dossier https://t.co/niAK5uTx1v
I have to agree with Comey. Is it reliable &amp; factual is what matters. https://t.co/XPygcbdFNh
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I know but the way it's been sesationalized gun violence hasn't decreased
She has no worries. Unless Go Fund Me raises the 3 billion that wall won't be built with tax payers money https://t.co/b7KiTkvccJ
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I have to agree. The past election cycles have proven that. Ethics have be waining. I believe despite difference right is right. If you just stop &amp; listen you can then hear the message.
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA You're right wow. That's awful. We have hope
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA It's not the government it's those we elect. Some go in with good intentions but over time with temptation &amp; corruption hitting you daily you can become a casualty. I believe with term limits &amp; checks &amp; balances that behavior can be curtailed
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA America is the murder capital of the world isn't that amazing. Makes you wonder why.
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA Wow, you learn something new every day. I thank you so much for the education. This was good.
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA We thought that it had to do with sending a political hate message but it was never said either way.
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I will check it out &amp; I believe we as Americans should now facts &amp; truth
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I can figure it out sensationalist going for ratings instead of truth.  How sad. We must do &amp; be better that that.
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA If true I will have to agree. I must find the chain of command and put what I find out on a tweet. Good project to work on
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA Then what are they? Rifles?
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I got it now. Is it shoot to kill not to wound factor?
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I will then agree with you if this turns out to be fact. We must get on top of our local governments to enforce the law as intended
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA We in Vegas know something is fishy. It was never explained why he did it. His girlfriend never spoke on TV &amp; it went dark real fast about the shooter. We were mushrooms on this one
@Gimpmaker @glenn_wofford @NRA I believe that the local reports said that he did.
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA Who is responsible for the state reporting?
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA That's not good. People need truth not narrative
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA I thought they were banned in CA for awhile but I could be wrong. I didn't know those facts. Well check that too. Then why the emphasis on the latter? Is it because of the casualties are more?
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA More with aimed shots. I use to belong to a gun club with husband before he passed away. Haven't been going on the regular but it's like a bike once you learn it never really goes away. I am a pretty good. I've done skeet shooting as well
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA They stated there wasn't a national database so that's not true. What needs to happen is individual states need to have database connection to update their individual records
@TaylorBrad76 Thank you.  Appreciate
@danthe727man @RepSwalwell @NRA Should evolve with technology.
@glenn_wofford @Gimpmaker @NRA Ok. That's what I thought but had to ask
