@ananavarro How many illegals are in our nation ? No one knows accurately , how many do harm ? Ask an angle mom /family , until it affects you , I don't expect u to understand
@ananavarro He doesn't take a salary does he ?
@ananavarro @RedHourBen Where I live ms 13 is rampid, what would you know about that
@ananavarro Your bias has no end , is that your opinion Orr or you a journalist ?
@ananavarro I should take down this post , your a big part of the division in this nation , take some responsibility
@RepJeffries Cause dems Hate America and won't protect her
@RepSwalwell I'm sure u just happened to be walking by trump tower
@RepAdamSchiff Because Democrats hate America that much
Dear Democrats:		Just so you know... President Trump declaring a state of emergency?		Is PATRIOTIC and putting AMERICA FIRST.  		You'd do well to take note! 		Sincerely,		Grateful Americans. https://t.co/0br2BjDf3Q

Replying to @RP4TRUMP2020	Call @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer to: 	#FundTheWall 	Leave your name, state, and phone number; be professional.	Note: currently Chuck is not receiving calls.	Goal: overwhelm them with calls.	‚ñ° I am calling daily.	See their phone numbers in Meme below: https://t.co/fRf0J8TgKt
Interesting  when lying ‚Å¶@SpeakerPelosi‚Å© &amp; ‚Å¶@SenSchumer‚Å© say ‚Äúall the experts say...‚Äù what experts are they referring to? All the border patrol agents who are real experts agree with ‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å© that we have a #CrisisInAmerica. https://t.co/o2MjNA7gfF
60,000 people are now attempting to come into our country illegally every month. That's more than 2,000 a day. The vast majority of those people now are families and unaccompanied children, and it simply is overwhelming the ability of our customs and border patrol to address it.
I think it exposes how far to the left and anti @realDonaldTrump the MSM truly is - shameful because no matter how anyone feels about the issues- the American people should have options to hear POTUS address (which I know will make significant news on the border issues). https://t.co/x9QaQjNDvZ
üå™It's 2019 and many controversies are starting to brew from the Democrats. Fresh allegations and more stonewalling.üå™	‚ö°Problems at every turn!! @POTUS ‚ö°		üåüüåüDo you STILL back our President 110% and FULLY support him, as he works for us??üåüüåü		Retweet so he can see the votes!! https://t.co/rq99XbrFtn
