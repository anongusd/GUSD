I‚Äôm excited to announce #RebootRepresentation, a coalition of tech companies that aims to double the number of underrepresented women of color earning computing degrees by 2025. https://t.co/01aMn3oSsR
That‚Äôs a problem. But it‚Äôs also an opportunity. Companies that are serious about bringing more women, especially women of color, into the tech workforce could be using their philanthropic spending more effectively. And in fact, that‚Äôs exactly what many of them have agreed to do. https://t.co/EKW6eUxmBK
The answer: Just 5%.		And an even smaller amount‚Äîless than 0.1% percent‚Äîwent toward programs specifically targeted at bringing women and girls of color into tech. https://t.co/iP7SMWJjw9
Take a guess: out of the $500 million these companies spent on philanthropic giving last year, how much went to efforts to increase gender diversity in the industry?
Together, we surveyed 32 leading tech companies about their philanthropic and corporate social responsibility initiatives. Our goal was to learn how much they‚Äôre investing in gender diversity‚Äîand whether they could do more.
And many tech companies acknowledge that they have a lot to gain by making diversity a priority. But as a philanthropist, I‚Äôm even more interested in what they can contribute. So I teamed up with @McKinsey to gather some data.
It‚Äôs no secret that women are still severely underrepresented in tech at every stage of the pipeline. (thread) https://t.co/ewA6kUdsB1

Budgets are a reflection of our priorities. When we cut funding for the programs that are keeping women &amp; children alive, it sends a signal to the world that we do not care about their lives or futures.
When I think about what‚Äôs at stake, I think of Sadi, a woman I met in Niger‚Äîa mother of six who uses contraceptives because she believes it‚Äôs part of her duty as a parent. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be fair for me to have another child,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to feed the ones I have.‚Äù
For many around the world, family planning is a matter of life &amp; death. Without the ability to plan &amp; space their pregnancies, women are more likely to die in childbirth, babies are less likely to survive childhood, &amp; more vulnerable families are trapped in a cycle of poverty.
While the proposal restores some funding for international family planning, I remain troubled by the impact of underfunding these programs, both through the budget &amp; the continued impact of the Mexico City Policy.
For example, the fact that we already had health workers on the ground in Nigeria fighting polio was a key reason we were able to contain the last Ebola epidemic before it reached our shores. Make no mistake: foreign aid funding protects American lives, too.
Historically, the U.S. has dedicated only about 1 percent of the federal budget to foreign aid. Even that small investment reaps enormous returns‚Äînot only for the health &amp; well-being of people overseas, but for the safety &amp; security of our citizens.
This plan falls far short of America‚Äôs longstanding aid commitments, &amp; I think we should be crystal clear about what that means.
Today, the President released his budget request for 2019. It continues the misguided approach the Administration has taken toward global health &amp; development over the past year.

Our friend Warren Buffett was a friend, business confidant, and champion of Kay's, and I'm eternally grateful that he introduced us. When I first met Kay, I was a young woman just starting my career, and she was an inspiration to me.
Kay was a pioneer. When she became CEO of the Washington Post Company in 1972, she was the only woman CEO of a Fortune 500 company. As a leader, she exuded authenticity, strength, and vulnerability‚Äîa mix that made her incredibly effective. https://t.co/l2Nw8KE8bb
