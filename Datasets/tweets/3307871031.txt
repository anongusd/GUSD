This is Shamima Begum who joined ISIS and participated in HEINOUS acts! Now she feels that she should be allowed to "come on back home" to England. She says that the British people should "have sympathy" on her, because she "ONLY" joined ISIS. Guess what, the Liberal DORKS do! üôÑ https://t.co/FGbKd9VvNH
@L_Heath01 The same to you Lee. God Bless you and yours!!! üòá
@CharcoalCharmed @CNN LOL!!! I watched Cavuto with that young Black guy, who is a flaming Liberal. He makes me sick and is almost foaming at the mouth with TDS. He made Neil "The Chipmunk" Cavuto almost look like a Republican...üòÜ

@kenallenspull ..........üòÜüòÜüòÜ
@L_Heath01 Yes, and they all try to blame it on the President. They have taken all of his comments, which he could have said some in a much better way, out of context. The 2019 Democrat Party are the biggest USURPERS in our nation's history...üò°
@L_Heath01 No, no offense taken at all Lee. I was just pointing out that if Mrs Northam really wants her husband to remain in office, she has to be a little more aware of the situation at hand is all...üòå
@L_Heath01 Yes sir Lee, I am a veteran.
@CharcoalCharmed @CNN They can push Juan Williams, Chris Wallace, and Neil Cavuto off of a cliff....üôÑ
@CharcoalCharmed @CNN Limbaugh, Beck, O Reilly, Tucker, Hannity, Dobbs, Pirro, Ingraham, Shapiro. There ain't that many of them...ü§î
@L_Heath01 It's was an ugly chapter in our history Lee. This has became an ugly chapter also, and all because of the racially divisive Democrat Party. They're feeding the victimhood of many Blacks, which they have indoctrinated into us, and turning it against Whites. It's just for votes..ü§®
@L_Heath01 No problem Lee. Yes, that is Blackface Northam's wife. I just thought that she would be a little more thoughtful, and quite frankly smarter, knowing that her husband may lose his job as Governor any day now because of racial issues. But she is giving history lessons on slavery.üôÑ

@soonersbigred Chamberlain was a CREAMPUFF. Then there was an interesting Chess games between FDR, Churchill, and Stalin. But FDR had his love affair with Stalin, and made some serious mistakes before he died in 1945. We COULD have stopped the Soviets from taking over so much of Eastern Europe.
@soonersbigred It was a punchline. He made it for a reason, because Americans did not want to go to war at the time. Do your research. We need to be the arsenal for our OWN democracy, and can't even secure our own damn border. If we don't fix our nation, we won't be the damn arsenal of ANYTHING
RT @CynthiaWilliam6: @raymysterio305 https://t.co/Y8J5zlFIPT
@soonersbigred That was created by FDR for WW2. That is the only time that was used, and was a punchline that he came up with trying to prepare our citizens that we needed to join the war.

@DNC @GOP @realDonaldTrump 		TO: CONGRESS	FROM: AMERICAN CITIZENS	SUBJECT: YOU		We Americans are SICK and DAMN TIRED of your ELEMENTARY SCHOOL leadership! Your opinion poll ratings are in THE TEENS, but you people don't seem to care!		TERM LIMITS...ARE COMING, YOU HEATHENS!!! üò§ https://t.co/a2cxI0zWie
Isn't a shame that the leader of America's most STANCH enemy of ALL TIMES, has foretold OUR future? General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev of the USSR foreseen the coming of IDIOTS Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Cortez, Bill Deblasio, and many other like BUFFOONS!		What a DAMN shame..üò¨ https://t.co/bkGtGnzyDm
This network has become the SCUM STANDARD in the news media today. They have become CHEAP 2 BIT PROSTITUTES for the Communist Democrat Party! They don't report NEWS, they peddle NARRATIVES for the Democrat Party. THEIR cause is the DEMOCRAT'S cause. That's not news in my book..ü§® https://t.co/78inCbyXYy
Very complex meme. Also a very TRUE meme. It's almost too much for any one person's brain to bear, knowing that we have ALLOWED this absolute BLASPHEMY into our society! Killing babies has become fashionable, and protecting yourself an OUTRAGE. Who cares about our border? Hmm..ü§î https://t.co/xC9E1QupgE
Americans we are on the cusp of a COMMUNIST takeover! We made a SERIOUS error in November 2018, allowing the WACKED OUT Democrats to take control of the House. They've been planning this Socialist/Communist rollover for YEARS, and think that we are ripe for the taking. Are we? ü§î https://t.co/zREiY66VmP
FDR was the founder of welfare. I don't believe that it was his intention at the time, but the New Deal was the start. Then LBJ passed his Great Society and put the NAIL into the coffin of the Black community. 		Now this STOOGE Cortez wants to enact MORE government controls....üôÑ https://t.co/zJkKZweS8N
Not only did this FOOL Governor Ralph Northam SQUANDER his career, his IDIOT wife has now stuck her foot in HER mouth!		These two just can't stay away from racial topics to save their lives!

Americans, this meme speaks for itself. As an American, you HAVE to wonder what has affected Liberals in our country? Is it the media, the Liberal FILTH education system, or the infamous "CHEMTRAILS" from airplanes?		It HAS to be SOMETHING that has ROYALLY SCREWED UP Liberals! ü§™ https://t.co/s2rFI3Dg58
Americans, this meme is VERY accurate! 90% of this GARBAGE is coming through our Southern border and turning half of our population into DRUG ADDICTS!		You people on the "BLOCK TRUMP EMERGENCY DECLARATION" bandwagon better think LONG AND HARD about this. This stuff is LETHAL!! ü§î https://t.co/GjnguDQucs
Better yet, many of these MILLIONAIRE actors who SUPPORT Socialism live in California. Well I'm pretty they can see the FILTH and SQUALOR in ANY major city! Sacramento, San Francisco, LA.

I spoke to a family member who's a STAUNCH Democrat. I told them of infanticide and how laws are being passed. My family member was APPALLED and asked "WHO is doing this? This is HORRIBLE".

I'm sure that Kanye has thought twice about meeting President Trump in the Oval office last year.

You know, I'm actually starting to see American woman walking around with these face coverings on. Has the Liberal movement become SO DERANGED, that women would GIVE UP their freedoms, to feel as if they're being "ALL INCLUSIVE"? ü§î		The women on the right CANNOT be too happy..ü§® https://t.co/OQ0E6ExD1U
It's time for President Trump to stop playing charades with the COLLUDERS who has and CONTINUES to try to overthrow him! ü§®		Put out the contracts for the carpenters to build hanging platforms, start gathering JAG officers, and get the cells ready at GITMO!

The past instructs us on how to proceed forward in to the future. Many Americans did not care about history in school saying "I don't have time for that".

@FeastTemporal Yes but we are nearly on the 20th year there, which tells me that our government WANTS us to be there. These Islamic people are never going to govern their countries as we want them to. So let them to fight their own tribal conflicts. We got enough issues here with Democrats. ü§®

@FeastTemporal Hey, I agree with you. But we have the most powerful military on this Earth. We have been in Afghanistan 18 years, and Iraq for 15. So that's signaling to me that these are permanent US conflicts.		That's unacceptable. We get NOTHING out of guarding Islamic nations, indefinitely.

There are many Democrats who KNOW that they're on the wrong team, but are too ASHAMED to admit it! This fine woman gives Americans a lesson which should be heeded.

So I seen some woman on HEATHEN CNN say that the red Make America Great Again hat "TRIGGERS" her. I seen another IMBECILE say that a DAMN HAT, was a SYMBOL OF RACISM.		How much longer are we going to tolerate this GARBAGE? Are we waiting for something HORRIBLE to happen first? ü§î https://t.co/ebTNGCQzCR
If you read to this NEW GREEN DEAL rolled out by BUFFOON Alexandria Cortez, you will discover that it lays out controlling EVERY aspect of YOUR life! It dictates how much taxes you pay, how you travel, what you eat, and supports racial division. The USSR wasn't much different..ü§î https://t.co/cc5YfJw5vy
The Democrats CLAIM they support the Jewish...		Meanwhile their EVIL politicians use their offices to ATTACK Israel. USURPERS Omar, Tlaib, and Cortez are allowed to freely ATTACK the Jewish and Israel, as they damn well please! I don't see anyone having the BALLS to stop them! ü§® https://t.co/hehLE35jwN
The Roman Empire was BY FAR the strongest empire this Earth has EVER know. It lasted for a very long time, but was eventually defeated. The funny thing is that it was NOT defeated by enemies. Their OWN internal corruption, deceit, and treachery defeated the Romans. Same for us?ü§î https://t.co/167Mjf6xTT
You know, it's a DAMN shame that America lost HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of brave men and women fighting the Socialist/Communist SCOURGE, only to sheepishly allow it into our government without a fight!

The Democrats are trying to form a protective barrier around the Black vote in America by generating racism. They see Black Americans opening their eyes, and don't like it.
