@SenhorRaposa I disagree with expanding the courts. Dems and Republicans court pack tbh. The next Dem President will and then the next R President will. I’ll go on and on.
@GabeTheCentrist @SenhorRaposa That’s fair.

Exactly. @RepAOC @RepRashida @Ilhan take notes. https://t.co/RFRsd1lm5k
@ChazNuttycombe Doubt it. Bernie’s chance was 2016.
Everyone on here is so partisan. If you’re a Democrat you’re a Democrat. Democrats believe in core values and principles.All Democrats don’t agree on the right solution but we agree there are problems and want to fix them. Let’s remember that. Everyone needs to keep an open mind.

@CautiousLefty @JoshDrake22 I doubt Sanders survives long in the race. His time was 2016.
@CautiousLefty @JoshDrake22 You’re not wrong. Honestly looking at the primary dates and Super Tuesday. Kamala looks like the strongest candidate. Super Tuesday will pretty much decide who the nominee is.
@JoshDrake22 @CautiousLefty It’s not wide open. Is it competitive yes but not wide open. Policy wise he’s the same exact democrat as many of the other candidates.

@jacobfhsmith I doubt Crisanta beats Diana. SHE CAN LITERALLY ALMOST BE GIVIN A SENATE SET!
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo Fair.
@CAinexile @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo I just classify it as a rural state.
@CAinexile @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo I put CO in the rural category
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo Hickenlooper said he isn’t made to be a senator. Sounds like he doesn’t wanna run.
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @CAinexile @politicsluo True. I hope a strong Dem woman runs. Dems need a rural female Senator.
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo I said could I didn’t say she is. Then again no real establishment Dem has made moves yet either sooo....
@CAinexile @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo I definitely don’t want Perlmutter.
@CAinexile @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo Romanoff definitely isn’t the establishment choice. Degette honestly could be.

@liamleewashere 🤣☝️
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo The senate seat is looking bluer by day sooo....
@jackcurran49 Oh hell ya. MO would be packing🤤. Any guy can look at Hawley and Kander and be like “damn he’s good looking”
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo Degette might run for Senate. Nothing is really keeping her in the House besides Seniority.
@jackcurran49 Yet he’s so attractive ☹️
@travis_gaither Glad someone said it 👏🏼
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo Maybe a previous scandal made her decide not to run such a in the spotlight race even tho running against Degette is pretty in the spotlight.
@jackcurran49 Cornyn:”quotes Italian Mussolini” 	Bernie: Hold my beer John
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo I doubt Romanoff has the backing of establishment. Degette or someone who is in current office could be running so Duran felt she’d better run for another office(shouldn’t be against Degette)

@TaylorDesloge @SenhorRaposa She very well could be. It’s not like she’d be leaving much in the House besides Seniority ig.
@JAllen_BR I get updates from Twitter. Thats good enough for me.
@CAinexile @JakobIsSmug @LikeIGive_Adam Exactly.
@JakobIsSmug @CAinexile @LikeIGive_Adam “Is making moves like he is running” insinuates that’s he’s running. Tweeting against her doesn’t equal running. That’s the only “move” he’s making.
@CAinexile @JakobIsSmug @LikeIGive_Adam People see one thing and they are like “he/she is running” like no honey sometimes people just criticize people...
@JakobIsSmug @CAinexile @LikeIGive_Adam Ok criticizing her doesn’t mean he’s running....

@SenhorRaposa @BenScionti @politicsluo She’s the chair of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Maybe this is a whole plan for her to run. I like Diana I think she’d be a great senator.
@BenScionti @politicsluo She has a subcommittee chairship plus her seniority ranking.
Why? @crisantaduran a Senate seat is way more important than a House seat with a good incumbent. https://t.co/fIoRk1eopR

@NotTheChips Which is fine... whoever wins the nomination I’m sure will have him on their list of vp potentials.
@NotTheChips Fair but there are things you just know/feel...
@NotTheChips I also respect your loyalty for him but sometimes have to be realistic. I do believe he’d be a good vp Pick. I’ve said that for a while.
@NotTheChips There’s quite a few motivational people running.
@NotTheChips Yes but comparisons of him with Obama etc just ain’t it. People give him to much clout. Like don’t get me wrong he did a lot in TX but going from a relatively less known congressman to nail bitter loser in TX to Presidential Nomniee just isn’t possible, maybe in a different year.
@NotTheChips @Polit_eurOpines Interesting.
@NotTheChips @Polit_eurOpines So what do you personally think would have made Beto win??
@NotTheChips Ya but you insinuated that Beto would bring more voters than Biden and that just isn’t factual. Honestly Beto blew up only because he got close to winning in TX. People comparing Beto to Obama like??? Just ain’t it.
@NotTheChips @Polit_eurOpines Well if he did it against Cruz we could’ve had Senator O’Rourke...
@NotTheChips Trying to compare Beto to Biden ain’t it chief. Biden is way more well known than Beto.
@NotTheChips @Polit_eurOpines Not going negative isn’t a winning theory but I respect him for believing in it.
@NotTheChips A lot of candidates have good teams and trust me voters will go to the polls. Beto doesn’t have to jump in to do that..
@NotTheChips Well Beto would be the same mold policy wise of almost every other presidential candidate. He won’t have much distinction.

@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren Did I say that but I don’t need you to tell me. The IN state legislature wouldn’t be that R if it was fair maps. Statewide offices will be R but the would have a lot more Dems it fair maps were made.
@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren That’s a big if. The glove always changes that’s politics. WE WONT HAVE THE HOUSE FOREVER.

@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren That’s what you mean tho. We aren’t talking about the House. You basically want to get rid of the filibuster if Dems Get the senate to rush things through yet when Dems aren’t in the majority you’ll wish the filibuster was there to stop Rs rushing things through...
@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren State legislatures are at the front lines of gerrymandering. It’s just something we will disagree on.
@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren I get it that it’ll be hard to have it but it’s the principle that it’s only ok if Dems are in the minority but not Rs. It can’t only be ok for one but not the other.
@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren I understand that but if Dems do that then Dems shouldn’t blame Rs for doing the same. It’s like saying it’s only go for Dems if they are in the minority. Gerrymandering can end in state legislatures. Get more Dems elected there.
@EricPerless @BernieSanders @CoryBooker @ewarren It would be hypocritical for Dems to get rid of the filibuster than whine when they don’t have it when the go into the minority(assuming they win a majority in 2020) it’s not a smart move.

@travis_gaither He really is. LA is a very R state so to have a Dem Gov that is successful at working together is amazing. Honestly if he’s the only Dem to win in the governors races this year I’ll be fine but boy I’m a JBE stan.
@BenJKest I think once candidates announce n such we could have a bette picture. Gardner and Jones are goners for sure.
@BenJKest What’s your personal prediction. Not any special prediction but yours right now.
@BenJKest I feel like Kobach could win like McConnell does, no one likes him but he’s a R in a state that is R federally.
@TossupReport My position is that the government shouldn’t have the ability to control what someone does with their body.
@BenJKest KS hasn’t elected a Dem Senator in like 70 years. I think Dems getting the majority is really possible. Especially because Trump isn’t helping the party and environment etc
@BenJKest I would kill to have a Dem from AK.
@jackcurran49 I really like her. I don’t agree with her on some issues but overall she’s a good person.
@BenJKest Now a Dem wipeout. Like a 2008.
@BenJKest This is my prediction too. I feel like Collins will end up retiring or losing. She has changed over the past two years. ME is changing too. Bullock has a strong brand in MT. Kelly if he is the nominee has a good chance to win. I just hope a dang good Dem nominee runs in NC.
@BenJKest Dems gain 4 seats. Enough to have 51-49.

@NotTheChips @betospotify I didn’t say it as a negative thing. I just said that’s the only thing that stand out. Like he’s has extremely similar positions on virtually everything. Just because someone has experience or knowledge on an issue doesn’t mean they should run for President. That’s the bad take.
@NotTheChips @betospotify literally what difference would Beto make in the primary besides him being from El Paso. He should rally behind a candidate so that the candidate stands out with his support so the primary isn’t that brutal.
@jackcurran49 I live in IN-01🙋🏼‍♂️

@jackcurran49 I do believe that reps should have to serve 3 terms to get a pension and Senators have to serve a term to get a pension. Like Karen Handel shouldn’t get a pension for not even serving a full term.

@Danny_Funaro @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @SteveKingIA 1 that shows a double standard that vocal antisemites shouldn’t be punished because they are democrats. 2 Ilhan would not have apologized if people didnt call her out so let’s make that clear. 3 More Muslim people will run and im sure they would know not to be vocal antisemites..
@Danny_Funaro @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Steve King is in congress because he was elected...and keeping them because of their perspective which if I’m understanding you right is them being Muslim. Firsts aren’t the last, so more people with “their perspective” will come.

@travis_gaither I live in IN-01. I know IN-02(in a good Dem year) could flip. Walorski isn’t as strong as people make her to be. He should contact Cheri and run for IN-02. If anything he can waste NRCC money there...

@MarkEHartman @giulioiacoviel @SenhorRaposa Pompeo isn’t running. The President announced that and pompeos camp didn’t deny it. Plus going from sec of State to a Senator isn’t really a promotion lol
@BenJKest My personal choice would be Stanton but since he’s likely to stay in the House So I’m between Kelly and Gallego. Kelly seems like a safe choice however he can get pulled against 2A because Rs can tie him to gun control. Gallego is a possibility depending on the environment.
@_Political_Nerd McAdams is a special kind of politician and Utah passed a redistricting proposition so who knows what the district will be but I’m giving McAdams incumbency and the fact that he won a squeaker that he could squeak it out again but I understand why you put it at toss-up.
@politicsluo Mine is Kyrsten Sinema
@politicsluo Sen Tammy Baldwin is a great senator! Easily one of my top Five.
@_Political_Nerd Agreed on all except IL-13(should be toss-up), PA-01(tilt R), UT-04(tilt D)
@_Political_Nerd @politicsluo Exactly
@politicsluo It saves all incumbents and maybe Dems get another seat....depends on a bunch of things. I’m just hoping it means Dems have good years in 2020 and take back Johnson’s open seat in 2022.
@politicsluo For sure. He was the king of Rs in WI. He had a good grip in his years.
@politicsluo Anyone who beat Walker is God. Walker was horrible.
@_Political_Nerd @SenhorRaposa AK-AL is Don Young territory until he retires or dies in the seat. Any R like Arrington could lose SC-01. 2018 was probably the best year to try to flip KS-02
@SenhorRaposa I agree with all but PA-01. I have a feeling Fitzpatrick will win...he seems like he can get crossover votes.
@ChazNuttycombe @politicsluo McClellan would be a good governor.
@joncprevo I’m ranking my choices 1.Amy 2 Kamala.3.Gillibrand 4. Biden 5. Warren 6. Booker. Amy and Biden would be the most positioned to win general. However I don’t think Amy got what it takes to win nomination. It’s extremely early but that’s my list as of right now.
It’s very early on in the 2020 prologue however I will not vote for Booker. Booker is such an attention seeker, has a past will big pharma, etc. I don’t see anything that makes him better than Harris, Warren, Gillibrand, etc. I’ll be surprised if he makes it to Super Tuesday.

@CAinexile Agreed on that. If Dems go too left, they won’t win. They should be left in areas where they should/could be and moderate in areas that matter. Moderates, Progressives, leftists should all thrive. Not one of them. Dems being too far left is a turn off for many.

@BenScionti They released statements condemning it and insinuating he should do what’s best. It’s not satisfactory for you so you are claiming that they aren’t calling for him to resign because of their friendship. If that was the case they wouldn’t have released anything.

@BenScionti It’s funny that you are saying I’m floating hypotheticals when literally you’re the one that is floating they didn’t say resign because of their friendship......
@BenScionti The released a statement which condemned it and that he should do what’s right(not in those words, but by insinuating). That’s not saying nothing or thinking about their personal relationship like you are saying.
@BenScionti Ben, we don’t know what was going on with creating the statements and It’s wrong to mischaracterize someone because you don’t know the full story or you don’t agree with a course of action someone took.
@BenScionti @Yukongold1898 Which is fair, also they could’ve been waiting to see what McAuliffe would say.
@BenScionti Some things are implied. Those statements could have been made before the full resign wave came. I think many are attacking Kaine and Warner for no reason. It’s not like they are saying he shouldn’t resign.
@BenScionti He implied it by saying that he should do what’s right. Many have asked for his resignation. Kaine and Warner said to do what’s right. Everyone attacking Kaine and Warner isn’t going to help the situation.

@_Political_Nerd @joncprevo @HughCHEvans @The_Viking95 @kkondik @mcimaps Agreed. I believe if you split SC-06  to add to SC-01 it’ll make it Dem friendly. If LA-02 loses Baton Rouge that would make another district. Making two Dem district in LA isn’t hard tbh. Might have another Dem friendly district after 2020.

@rsnekser That’s not true and tbh if lefties say stuff like gives the GOP every right to make fun of lefties. To act like it’s only about Oil is so ignorant. I’m sorry but your take is just laughable.

@_Political_Nerd Ok and would’ve you said that about Rosen? It’s kind of naive to think that’s the last option. Axne won a competitive district. She’s new political like Rosen so no real scandals. I wouldn’t count her out because she’s a freshman. IASEN is more important than one house seat.

@deedahnjr I think you are the one underestimating Kamala and drastically overestimating Booker. He’s not a big deal. He’s a good senator but presidential candidate not so much. He should stay in the Senate.
@deedahnjr @giulioiacoviel He’s not more well known then Warren or Harris. Hate to burst your bubble. He doesn’t have any outstanding qualities besides being a liberal from NJ. He can try to trap the Im the next obama wannabe but it ain’t gonna work. The only candidate that will crush the debates is Kamala
@deedahnjr You make up Booker more than he is. He doesn’t have a shot to the nomination. He won’t outshine Kamala, Liz, or Kirsten. Cory won’t be in the race after SC. He’s not a heavy hitter like Kamala, Liz or Kirsten. He’ll waste time in the race. Also you highly underestimate Kamala.

@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel Again not disputing she wouldn’t be a good vp for a male or female presidential candidate. I just don’t see a all woman ticket. If Joe Biden somehow won the nomination, Tammy would be a good pick for him.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel 1. Biden is the old crop of Dems(love him but Dems need to move on from him) 		2. I love Gov Whitmer, AG Nessel and SOS Benson but statewide and federally are two different things. I just don’t see a case where all woman ticket happens in 2020. A two man ticket for Dems is over.
@davidagordon9 @BenScionti @IAmKrishanPatel It was my prediction/thoughts not like I said it was set in stone. Y’all understood it to be set in stone.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel 3. Tammy’s great. I’m not disputing that at all.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel 1. See the female presidential candidates rn. They are heavy hitters.I don’t see Biden getting into the race and even if he did he wouldn’t win the nomination. 		2. An all woman ticket sounds great but I think all the strategists know it’s just not possible for 2020.
@BenScionti @davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel Many things played in FL. Don’t even get me started.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel Ok. I personally see a female presidential nominee... an all woman ticket isn’t going to happen in 2020. A woman will be on the ticket tho. 2018 made it clear.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel I didn’t say that was the fact, I said that it’s a purple state like PA etc. appetite for both parties is there. To say that a seat will flip just because of a midterm is wrong.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel I made my assumptions by facts and from the fact that open seats in swing seats often are competitive. A fact was that Rs best year for taking seats in the Senate was 2018. No doubt about that.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 You give takes that aren’t always based on fact...it’s just not surprising you’d say that.
@davidagordon9 @IAmKrishanPatel It’s Krishan.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 Bad take. Wisconsinites like being represented by both parties. I don’t see two R senators from WI. In 2022, PA, WI(Johnson’s seat), FL, NC, and IA should be competitive af.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 I doubt it. Dems don’t really have any seats we can lose in 2022. Mark Pocan or Ron kind would be a good successor to her seat.
@RachelBitecofer @kayhagan She’s too ill to run. She’s been sick since 2017.
@davidagordon9 @kenner116 @IAmKrishanPatel It’s a joke. Bernie would never be a vp.
@_Political_Nerd Grassley’s seat is open in 2022. Either Finkenauer or Axne will run against Ernst. Jacky Rosen is a shinning example of a good freshman that beat a incumbent senator. I really like Axne.
@_Political_Nerd I like the map
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 Oh for VP he would be a good choice. However I feel a more established pick would happen.
@davidagordon9 I agree. Compared to Liz or Kirsten she has the most winnability. Kamala is my favorite rn. Beto wouldn’t beat Trump. It’s clear. Even though I’m sure he’ll run because his senate run gave him and his supporters an adrenaline rush.

@zcpolitics Nominating someone from NY didn’t help in 2016, nominating someone from MA didn’t help us in 2004....so state doesn’t matter.

@EricPerless @GraysonBarnette Ok, but each candidate puts their major points first then the only things they support. Just because her main points aren’t exactly what you want to see doesn’t me she won’t support the things you support.
@EricPerless @GraysonBarnette Ik my point was for the broader idea of people being turned off because they don’t see key words in her platform. She has and will support key issues. We got time to go. She’ll change minds.
@GraysonBarnette @EricPerless True but some people are already being anti-Harris which is wrong. Her formal announcement could have a lot more policy points.
@EricPerless @GraysonBarnette She supports M4A. I think to act like she’s not for progressives issues is wrong. Just because she doesn’t put key progressives at the forefront of her campaign like others have doesn’t mean she doesn’t support them. Each candidate is different.

@ChazNuttycombe Running for TXSEN is his route more than running to be the 3rd or 2nd choice in the primary. I’m not bashing him, I’m just being realistic.
@ChazNuttycombe I don’t see him winning. Honestly Beto’s on an adrenaline rush. He got TX close so everyone thinks he’s the next big thing. Which trust me I get it but just because he got close to winning TX doesn’t give him the boost I think he needs to win the nomination. I’m supporting Kamala
@ChazNuttycombe Out*
@ChazNuttycombe Let me clarify, I see Kirsten put lasting Warren. Beto should run TX-SEN.
My list as of right now. https://t.co/aIi2a0nqT8
@ChazNuttycombe Kamala and Kirsten Gillibrand are honestly the two I see going through the primary. Warren will probably drop out in March, I don’t even think Beto runs.

@giulioiacoviel @rsnekser OH will probably be red. NC and FL depends on the candidate.
@rsnekser @giulioiacoviel We’ll see. I wouldn’t say they’ll have the name recognition you necessarily think they will but vps don’t necessarily need name rec from the beginning.

@davidagordon9 Oh I’m not lol. I’m just being passionate too. I like you David if I didn’t, I wouldn’t follow you. I gave an opinion you probably wouldn’t normally have heard. I like having conversations with people of different beliefs. That’s why I follow many progressives.
@davidagordon9 @BenScionti Justice Democrats. I’m supportive of all groups to be able to flourish, not one take over the others etc
@davidagordon9 @BenScionti I don’t agree with that moderates want Progressives to shut up and wait their turn but I do feel that progressives shouldn’t primary moderate Dems. There was words that a group affiliated with AOC wanted to primary Hakeem Jeffries. Like the only people who would be that dumb are
@davidagordon9 I never said it would hurt. I’m just saying some people think that. You and Ben went too much into this.
@davidagordon9 @BenScionti Well I don’t think so should go away but I believe she should be more quiet and learn the ropes than go full steam. She just got there, let it sink in then go full throttle. I understand that whatever I say you’ll disagree with but that’s ok.
@davidagordon9 Ad*
@davidagordon9 I didn’t say you were and I didn’t say she was. Nancy wasn’t running for all 435 seats(Donna was😂) But She was on every attack ad. So Rs will use AOC on an attack add against who ever does run.
@BenScionti @davidagordon9 I’m just saying it’s what some people are saying. Look I don’t like her, it’s clear but Progressives see her as one thing and others see her as another.

@davidagordon9 Wym?
@davidagordon9 She does represent her wing maybe you don’t think that but others do. I don’t think she represents all Dems but many independents etc do. Republicans will claim that since AOC and Rashida Tliab are socialists all Dems are socialists. Socialism is a bad word, try to change my mind
@davidagordon9 It’s more of the optics of her and what she stands for more than her herself. Like I agree with some policies of her and I don’t agree on others. I’m socially progressive but economically moderate.
@davidagordon9 Work everywhere. So AOC should represent her wing of the party not the party as a whole.
@davidagordon9 Like I know for me and many other moderates it’s that the Democratic Party shouldn’t be far left like her and shouldn’t be known as the party of AOC etc. Don’t get me wrong she is good for her district and those policies work for her district but those specific policies don’t
@mjdawidowicz @davidagordon9 Democratic Party as a whole isn’t as far left as she is.
@davidagordon9 Of her. She represents a far left group of democrats not democrats as a whole.
@davidagordon9 The harm is that the Rs will use her as the example for the whole Democratic Party, which she is not. She is apart of the left wing. She is also trying to set primary challenges against her colleagues. Bottomline is that when people think of democrats I don’t want them to think..

@BenScionti Honestly, EBJ isn’t bad. She’s old but isn’t as bad as SJL.
@LikeIGive_Adam I’m not building her up. She has decent approval ratings, she’s an incumbent, and she is apart of a party in PR that gets votes from Rs and Ds. Ya she’s not safe but it’s not a Doug Jones situation.
@LikeIGive_Adam I would say it’s the primary goal of all delegates. To EHN and Jennifer it is but Amata, Stacey, MSN, and Gregorio Sablan just want to get funding and resources for their districts.
@LikeIGive_Adam However it’s not impossible.
@LikeIGive_Adam First I want PR to be a state. Second I’m not lecturing you so don’t think I am. I didn’t say Cruz was the best choice, I just said that she would be a clear front runner if she ran. PRDEMs would have to run someone real electable because taking on Jennifer will be a challenge..
@LikeIGive_Adam A Delegate is essentially a rep without a vote. The delegate advocates for PR like Peter Welch advocates for VT. Doesn’t necessarily have to be statehood(the only delegates that advocate for statehood are EHN and Jennifer) At-large members are interesting to me.
@LikeIGive_Adam That’s fair, I just wanted her because she’d be the clear front runner and she cares a lot about PR.
@LikeIGive_Adam True. I kinda want Carmen Yulin Cruz to run. She’d be a clear front runner.
