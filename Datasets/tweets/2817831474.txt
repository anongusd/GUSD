Congratulations on the upcoming birth of your son, but seriously, even with the tear jerker story about Bruce, both of you MUST fix your hats- THEN drink the tequila! Happy 2019 to you both with all my love!
@RepKarenBass Thank you on Morning Joe for refocusing attention on the border children. That has just about disappeared from the news lately. Keep up ALL of your good works. Thank you for all that you do. I'm a true fan of yours! President 2020- maybe?
@RukhnamaLives @SailorHaumea @AaronBlake Ain't that the f-ing truth!
@yasminv WELCOME BACK! You have been missed while so happy for you and your family. SO good to see you once again every morning!
@ElizabthRecheis thanks for the follow!
@JillWineBanks BTW,,you're wearing one of my favorite pins this evening of the elegant dancing  couple. Only you can carry it off with such beauty. Thank you for always matching your beauty with your talent and incredible brains leaving us  breathless and amazed!!!
@RepAndyHarrisMD SHAME ON you for your ignorance. I used to think that you weren't TOO bad- boy was I wrong! I'm ASHAMED  that you represent the state that I proudly live in!!!
@funder KICK HIM OUT THEN LOCK HIM UP!
@apoliticthot Me too!
@funder Good! It's about damn time! I pray all recounts break towards Fem. But I we Ted to say that I am SO proud and grateful that we are taking to the streets on WHITAKER.	  NO matter how physically &amp; emotionally drained, exhausted and physically wiped out we are. TAKE TO THE STREETS!
@amyklobuchar the great team of Amy Klobuchar and Eric Swalwell?
@amyklobuchar cybersecurity; military needs and crisis; international relations and trade agreements, etc, etc, etc, all at the same time to prove to the U.S. that you can do it all with honesty, transparency and as adults, you need to start planning for 2020, so how about the
@amyklobuchar now that midterms are over &amp; Dems have to deal with Whitaker/Trump/Meuller; healthcare, prescript cost, opioid abuse, VA care; medicaid, medicare, Soc Security; education; energy solutions; environment; infrastructure; border security and immigration programs; ...
@zmartypantz Thank you for the like!
@PPact @tedcruz @BetoORourke Ditto
@jaclynf @HeidiHeitkamp Ditto!
@bopinion @TimOBrien Really, Trump? Give me a try, you bloody idiot.
@JuddLegum I'm so pissed off. To read my ranting stream of consciousness check my Twitter account. Can't write anymore, my old arthritic fingers hurt!
WHITAKER= enabler, apologist, sycophant  (you are right, John Brennan!) Smell test= doesn't stink, it reeks! Thumb on the scale=  no...whole bleeping fist on the damn scale!
@RepJerryNadler We have now placed our faith in you to go after Trump hard as he has already taken the offensive hard. I only hope that by January it won't be too late.
@funder Let me be clearer- I can't imagine surviving more Trump, BUT I agree completely- we will not give up, we will not be intimidated! I just hope my old and decrepit body can last as long as that takes!
@funder OMG. I really don't think I can survive 2+ more years.
RT @funder: Not having power cords for voting machines is voter suppression. Not having enough paper ballots is voter suppression. Retweet‚Ä¶
@diaperdan72 Thank you for RE-tweeting!
@sandboxpete Thanks, Peter. That helps me to calm down.
I'm SO F**KING ANGRY...can you tell?
Eric Holder just tweeted, saying it best. He's right. This is OUR RED LINE. We must come together and start protesting immediately and not give in to this megalomaniac in the WH. That power hungry criminal must not get away with this sh*t. TOGETHER, we must ALL fight back now!!!
Now Trump will be able to get away with everything- unless ALL OF US WAY NO and protest without ceasing. Everyone who gathered to protest Kavanaugh, the Muslim ban, taking babes from mothers at the border- come together as one NOW. We must act now, for as long as it takes. SAY NO
We the American people from all political parties MUST TAKE TO THE STREETS in absolute protest day after day until this criminal OBSTRUCTION of "firing" Sessions and replacing him with WHITAKER. I have Never been a Sessions fan but I admired his protecting Mueller.
Whitaker was picked deliberately to shut down Mueller investigation by refusing to allow indictments; cutting all funds; saying no to investigations into Trumps business, finances, family &amp; self; deep six any reports from investigation. Sessions was technically fired. OBSTRUCTION
@JillWineBanks VOTE VOTE VOTE!!!
@PhilipRucker OMG! You've got to be kidding me!

@DrMichaelSutter F you!
@RosieFanSpam i LOVE the new haircut you have on Deadline White House. It's gorgeous, you're gorgeous-always!
@HeyJude1302 @JillWineBanks Right on!
@MissMyrtle2 @JillWineBanks Ditto again!
@JillWineBanks @KeciaWimmer Ditto, hero!
@SenatorCollins Beautiful speech but you have made a mistake and you have broken my heart. I give up. You let the bullies win. I quit. I quit life.
@JeffFlake for any judicial position. His op-ed blamed everyone else for his anger and loss of composure under stress. His owing the President his loyalty vs. the constitution is wrong. So much more that YOU care about. Be a hero. Vote no tomorrow, I beg of you, PLEASE!!!
@JeffFlake every little thing instead of admitting he made mistakes that he was now sorry for. He wanted to look like a choir boy so he LIED. The investigation would have proved that had it been allowed to. His political bias was beyond evident, his demeanor wasn't appropriate
@JeffFlake PLEASE DON'T VOTE YES. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ! I know this is a tough decision. Of course the supplemental investigation showed nothing because the WH handcuffed the FBI.  You're not running for re-election so you can be brave enough to vote no. He LIED about
@JeffFlake As Joyce Alene says "If you lie under oath, you'll lie in an	op-ed"!
@JeffFlake How brave was Heidi Heitkamp today? That took real guts, to put doing the right thing over political pressure to save her career in a very Republican state!
@JeffFlake Demeanor is everything to inspire trust in the court. Please share the last few tweets that I sent you with Senators Collins &amp; Murkowski. Thank you very much.
@JeffFlake Justice Stevens. At 98 years old, a very wise man!
@JeffFlake "what goes around, comes around"...remember that statement from the judicial nominee? Very scary!
@JeffFlake "we can't have it on the court, we just can't"...sound familiar? I have to say that I agree with the wise Republican Senator that said that
@JeffFlake Please...Kavanaugh is so openly politically biased that he can't be trusted to be objective in the highest court of the land for the rest of his life. Vote no, then put through a different conservative judge. Dying on this hill is not worth it &amp; not fair to the US!
@SenatorHeitkamp THANK YOU SO MUCH for your real bravery today! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
@JeffFlake Temperament and Trustworthiness!
@JeffFlake Drinking game? Flatulence? Come on. No one is foolish enough to buy those explanations. To me that's lying. And little lies always lead to larger lies. That's too big a chance to take. Vote yes on the next candidate.
@JeffFlake The WH deliberately walled off the FBI from asking about the truth of the yearbook comments. How can you decide on his truthfulness under oath without that? Please think very hard, I BEG you. We need you. Be a hero.
@SenatorCollins Are you sure this vote is worth being primaried out over by not doing all that you can to protect Roe v. Wade since this FIB  investigation did not include looking into Kavanaugh's truthfulness, political bias and affect? Please think hard.
@SenatorCollins I just wanted you to know how sorry I am that you have been threatened in any way. That's thoroughly abhorrent. I feel just terrible that you are going through all of this just because of a vote. Please hang in there!
@ABC Simply gorgeous! Lifts my soul. Thank you!
@SenSasse I am a fan but I'm BEGGING from my heart &amp; soul that you PLEASE vote no on Kavanaugh.  There are lots of other conservatives to vote yes on. PLEASE do the right thing for our country and our future. We need you to stand up. We need you- please don't let us down!!!
@SenBobCorker sir, I am begging you-and from the bottom of my heart and the bottom of my soul- PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE change your mind and vote no on Kavanaugh. There are plenty of other conservatives to vote yes for,  but PLEASE vote no on this judge for the sake of the future.
@woofka AMEN!!!
@ZerlinaMaxwell You are NOT alone. BTW... I'm a huge fan!!!
@adrienne_72 Thank you for the re-tweet! Very kind of you.
@peterdaou @JoeNBC Then don't fucking watch it, you blithering idiot! Better yet, watch it and try to learn something from it. Maybe your head needs to explode! I'll come pick up the pieces.üòÅ
@noellenikpour I really hate to be mean and I truly don't want to hurt your feelings, but as hard as I try to stay neutral about you and respect your right to express your position and opinions, I really just can't stand you and your opinions. Sorry!
@ChuckGrassley You are the perfect puppet for Mitch McConnell.   You should feel nothing but SHAME. May God and this country forgive you for what you have done and what you have not done! SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!
@McConnellPress I hate to give in to expressing my baser thoughts,  but sir you are a power hungry, unfeeling bully and  hate-filled pig. You are disgrace to humanity.  You and Trump deserve each other. I have to actually feel sorry for you. SHAME on you!!!
@sandboxpete Thank you for sharing your viewpoints... you make a difference!
@getgoing43 Wow! Thank you for reading my tweet and then RE-tweeting it! That is so kind. It's nice to know my written frustrations may mean something to more people than just me.
@Morning_Joe feeling #why bother...they always win in the end. Will anything ever really change? Will the bullies always win in the end? But I refuse to give up hope for the future. We must keep telling our truths. We must keep fighting. Thank you for all you do. Thank you!
@Morning_Joe  Me too # me too # me too literally more times than I can count during 35 years of my 65 yr old life til I was able to get safe by hiding from the world. While I have been very encouraged by the #me too movement, with the way the WH  &amp; Republican Senate, I am now
@clairecmc I know you're in a really tough race but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay strong and vote no on Kavanaugh.
@JeffFlake PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE vote no based on the WH playing the country for fools, for deliberately constraining the FBI, for lying to you as much as Kavanaugh did. Vote no on principle.  Vote no for honor and honesty. Please don't let us down. We need &amp; are counting on you!
@JeffFlake The FIB was deliberately hamstringed. You are being deliberately manipulated. You will be letting the country down through no fault of your own when you were the person who bravely called on the WH to do the right thing. Please don't let them get away with this.
@JeffFlake had proof of Kavanaugh's evading or not telling the truth. He LIED to you and the WH deliberately set out to keep that out of the investigation so you'd have cover to vote yes. They're setting you up to be their fool. This was NOT a thorough or honest investigation
@JeffFlake I am BEGGING you to do the right thing regarding the FBI investigation and the Senate vote. The White House set that "investigation" up to never confront anyone who had a negative opinion on Kavanaugh, never look into the 40 people who begged to be interviewed who
@Sen_JoeManchin PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do the right thing. I'm begging you to find the inner strength to vote no, begging you.	For the sake of the environment, health issues, civil rights, protecti g our institutions as well as for truth and honor. Thank you for listening.
@Sen_JoeManchin not hamstringed and white washed by the White House in an effort to con the Senate and the country into saying yes to the President that wants this judge on the court to legally protect him personally. Plenty of other conservatives to vote yes for- not this one!
@Sen_JoeManchin I am a fan of what you've done for your state. Now I'm asking you to do what's right for the country. Stay strong and vote no on Kavanaugh. Vote for truth under oath, anti-conspiracies, for judicial temperament and for true and comprehensive FBI investigations
@SenatorHeitkamp PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay strong and do the right thing. Vote no, I beg of you. The country desperately needs you. There are other conservative judges that can be voted through. We are ALL counting on you. PLEASE! Thank you for your help!
@lisamurkowski Don't forget his opinion on native Alaskans and Hawaiians! Anyway, thanks for listening to one more anguished request that you do what I believe has to be the right thing for the country. I admire you and your work so much. Thank you again!
@lisamurkowski Small lies, the ability to be honest about the past leads you to have to doubt his honesty about everything. There are plenty of conservative judges that can be voted through. Please look deeply in your heart before you vote and do what truly is right or all of us.
@lisamurkowski Judge Kavanaugh in the meeting before the Senate, his obfuscation to questions and when that didn't work his attack on the Senators. His conspiracy theories and extreme political views makes his ability to be impartial on the bench and handle stressful situations.
@lisamurkowski begging to be interviewed by the FIB were never contacted, houses and schooled were never attempted to be inspected. All of this was to be seen as to examining truth under oath- oath to the Senate and FBI. Keep in mind the affect and attitude by
@lisamurkowski I am begging you to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE when you read the investigation report, keep in mind that the "expanded" investigation was still severely restricted by the White House. The 2 main subjects were not interviewed, 40 people with very relevant information were
@Princeharry0056 Thank you sir for the "follow".
@SenatorCollins Vote for the next conservative candidate who has honesty, dignity and judicial decency and fairness that is on display all of the time. Please don't vote for Judge Kavanaugh for a lifetime position and be full of doubts and regret forever. PLEASE!!!
@SenatorCollins Please, please, please Senator Collins... Help us all- I pray, I pray, I pray. Thank you SO much for listening to me. I think you're wonderful.
@SenatorCollins intentionally hamstrung by party leadership, power plays, the White House legal department and the President to con 3-5 Senators,  including you. Only you 3 can force them to do what's right and fair and honest. Please stand up for all of us.
@SenatorCollins truth under oath, honor, severe political leanings, belief in destroying all of the consequences of revoking Roe v. Wade inappropriate interaction with Senators, inappropriate affect, conspiracy theories, rage and belief in his entitlement. The FIB has been
@SenatorCollins I have to write to you again and pray that you have the strength to stand up for what is fair and right. The FBI cant talk to Dr. Ford, follow any leads that those close to Judge Kavanaugh are begging the investigators to respond to. This is about truth under oath
@BWilliams OK Sorry..	Peter Baker got it out there. Thanks.
@BWilliams Did you not hear that the "new" guidelines in the Kavanaugh investigation is STILL VERY restrictive. There is no red pin in the college or prep school, and no looking into the over-drinking allegations!!!
@MichelleStGeor3 Thank you for the "like"!
@SenatorCollins THANK YOU SO MUCH for pressuring the White House to expand the background search parameters on Judge Kavanaugh.  Now if the time constraint allows it, America can feel like this shadow on our justice system has been addressed	 Thank you again!

@SenatorCollins The more time wasted on NOT actually being able to properly conduct this FIB investigation will end with the White House/Kavanaugh still lying to you. This MUST be addressed/fixed by TONIGHT! PLEASE listen, PLEASE help- all of us and yourself!!!
@SenatorCollins I know that hearing about an FIB investigation gives you cover to vote yes, but the very arbitrary restrictions put on it makes it a rubber stamp sham that will cause you to actually vote uninformed. They can't even investigate perjury charges. Help us help you!
@SenatorCollins PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to Frank Figliuzzi re: what the FBI is absolutely NOT allowed to do under McGahn's orders, including looking for the house Dr Ford described or any supplemental witnesses whose name comes up, the prep school or college, etc. Please help
@SusanGrundberg Thank you SO much for liking my tweet. That is so kind of you!
@MSFargo0303 Thank you SO much for liking my tweet. That is so kind of you!
@dbd603 Thank you for liking my pathetic little tweet. That's amazing!
@JeffFlake Thank you for LISTENING  with your heart to Senator Coons and the 2 women in the elevator. I know it was difficult and painful but brave. Thank you for all of the women in the country and thank you on behalf of America. Thank you ONCE AGAIN from me. You're a good man!
@JeffFlake Arizona must be a great place. It produced 2 courageous men who became the 2 bravest Senators in many, many years. Both you and the late Senator McCain have made me proud to be an American again. (BTW I'm a Democrat!) Thank you again.
@JeffFlake Thank you, thank you, thank you!
@JeffFlake Thank you for your courage!
@Sen_JoeManchin Thank you!
@lisamurkowski Thank you!
@SenatorCollins Thank you!
@JeffFlake You are still my hero for following your heart and not party. Thank you!
YOU are the evil co-conspirator! May you rot in hell!
@LindseyGrahamSC Rolling your eyes. Planned political outburst to protect Kavanaugh fron the paid prosecutor's questions. How do you live with that shame for all eternity. John McCain is definitely in heaven. Where do you think you will be? God help you.
@tedcruz You are one more disgrace to the US Senate. I pray you lose your Senate race. SHAME on you for your words and actions. Go home and shut up.
@GrassleyPress My God, you have demonstrated that you are a bleeping asshole. I'm ashamed that you are a United States Senator. You should be ashamed of yourself. Think about finding a new job where you can try to regain your dignity. SHAME on you for such behavior !
@LindseyGrahamSC I never thought I would say that I hate you, but after your comments, actions and attitude today- I hate you. And J. McCain would be more than ashamed of you. I hope you can live with yourself, you (words I dare not say).SMAME ON YOU!!!
@BretStephensNYT Super congratulations on your Ted Cruz piece. That's exactly how I would have put it. SO proud of you!. Perfect in every single way. 	BTW, I'm YOUR #1 fan!!!
@McConnellPress And by the way, the end DOESN'T justify the means, but I'm sure you'll never realize that in your lifetime...so very sad.
@McConnellPress You are such a cold hearted, power hungry, amoral, despicable human being, not deserving of respect from 	America. Just like Trump, being a unethical bully is not the same as being an effective leader. SHAME on you for all that you say and do in the name of truth.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No sur- that's your game!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Let me put it like Maize Hirono did- shut up and put up. WWJMD...What would John McCain do?
@RepDonBeyer The sound you now hear is me screaming!
@senorrinhatch BULLY!!! Give me a freaking break! You are a bully and you damn well know it. SHAME on you!!!

@thelisagraves BTW, I'm a big fan!
@MichaelAvenatti Thank you, Michael Avenatti! You are a real hero for women. I have a story that I could tell but I won't destroy my &amp; my son's life, so I am grateful to those brave enough to speak out. I'm so glad that they have you to help them do so. Thank you.
@RodRosenstein3 2/2 many tears and sleepless nights. The loneliness and always being misunderstood for your entire life is hard to take, but I can't &amp; won't change who I am. I must be true to myself. I give it all to God and trust it will all work out. Hang in there, stay strong.
@RodRosenstein3 I also have always had a dry, sarcastic sense of humor since early childhood. Only the most intelligent ever really understood and appreciated it. Over time it has cost me freedom, priva y, employment, acquaintances, friendships, deep personal relationships, 1/2
@NBCNews My dogs suffered seizures and permanent neurobiological damage from them. The newer and newest products were even worse.
@crooksandliars @MalcolmNance Disgusting beyond words. Should be criminal. He should sue the pants off him.

@RodRosenstein3 I sent this to you through DOJ site: Hang in there. Stay strong. We believe in you. You're doing a great job.We need you &amp; believe in you. Hang in, stay strong. Thank you for all you do!
@TheJusticeDept This is just a few words for Rob Rosenstein...please stay strong. Please hang in there. You are doing a wonderful job. We all believe in you. We are all grateful. We are all proud of you. We all need you. Hang in, stay strong. Thank you.
@AriMelber Seriously? On a day like today, can't we just skip the fall back Friday?!
@mattapuzzo May I ask why you have been transferred to Brussels? I'd rather see you here in the States than on Skype. Anyway,  great scoop on Rosenstein and I hope Brussels is where you want to be. Enjoy yourself there. You're terrific!
@DeadlineWH If Republicans insist on Wednesday can't Dr. Ford say o.k. as long as you give me the supeona for her witness? Fair is fair in negotiations.
@SteveKornacki I just wanted to say that I enjoyed your hosting Live w/Ali Velshi today, as I always enjoy all of the shows you substitute host. My point for the day is that I really hope they give you your own permanent show soon, you're so good at it. Thank you!
@JillWineBanks Just watched you with Stephanie Reuhl and while this has nothing to do with what that you were discussing, I just have to tell you that I love your new haircut. Silly tweet, I know, but you look fantastic...It makes you look even more beautiful &amp; 15 yrs younger!!!
@jwpetersNYT I hate to say this as- you're the best looking man I've ever seen, but your mother is right...you DO look tired! (Maybe choose between Last Word and MSNBC morning shows within mere hours of each other.) Love you and your reporting either way. Now go sleep (&amp; shave).

@JillWineBanks I'm so proud of the opinion piece that was published on Think that you co-authored with Mimi, Barbara, Joyce and Maya- my five favorite women. It was perfect. I pray that the Congressional Republicans all read it. Whats happening makes me sick, furious and ashamed!
@LindseyGrahamSC MY prayers are for YOU sir. John McCain would be so disappointed and so disgusted with you, not only for your kissing Trumps ass at every turn, but for how you are dealing with the Kavanaugh hearing, how you are treating his accuser. SHAME ON YOU! SHAME! SHAME!
@CecileRichards AMEN!!!
@ChuckGrassley SHAME on you, SHAME on you, SHAME on you. HOW DARE YOU, SIR!!! What has happened to the man and senator that you used to be. I can't look at you or say your name. I'm gutted. How can you live with yourself? SHAME!!!
@TheLastWord I have never been more proud to follow your show, never more proud of you then right now in your opinion/coverage of Senator Grassley and the need of the Washington press core to do the right thing. Thank you SO much!
@SenBobCorker i am SO disappointed in you. I have always been impressed with your honestly and fairness until now. You must allow an investigation before the hearing to be fair. Please don't let your public down. Please don't let history down. Please don't let me down. Thank you.
@KazmerDiedre How very, very kind of you to ask. I'm fine, I live in MD and the nursing home survived intact my parents should be ok. Waiting for phone lines to work again to double check. I over reacted but prayers work. I can't express adequately how much your concern means to me. Thanks!
