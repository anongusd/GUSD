@babyboy2088 @Minnie_Selie @BBNaija Lol.... To me, I don't see them as being in love, I see two adults who enjoy each others company and satisfy themselves in the process
@babyboy2088 @Minnie_Selie @nnekaukpanah @BBNaija Hmmmmmm, the truth is I don't see any reason they have to date themselves in there,  when their focus should be in the crown, that's why I like Ifu and Alex
@SaintmaroB @BBNaija Some girls won't fall trust me.
@Minnie_Selie @babyboy2088 @BBNaija It's was a game and she knew it, she agreed to it, she doesn't have any reason to complain but should have been smarter.
@Minnie_Selie @nnekaukpanah @babyboy2088 @BBNaija So why is she complaining since they both agreed to do it for the game? Both of them were playing games, so she isn't suppose to get loose. I still blame her.
