@LadyThriller69 I'm conservative and that's not what conservatives think. I wish everyone would get past race and just love each other.
@RandPaul Bye bye Rand.  U don't support Trump, we replace you.
@DeepStateExpose God will prevail.
@SebGorka How can so much stupid come out of one mouth.
@ericbolling Happy Birthday Eric Bolling.
@prayingmedic Why are they letting them go?
@ashnicoleb23 For a romantic, y'all went about things backwards.   Try concentrating on what you have and not what you didn't get.
@robreiner Yeah. When they gonna start investigating the Democrats.
@SharylAttkisson @JackPosobiec And wearing the same exact outfit she wore a year ago. Funny how that works out.
@AOCpress Liar Liar.
@AOCpress Leave her ass there. She made her bed. Let her lay in it.
@ashnicoleb23 LOL. She's rotten.
@ashnicoleb23 That's how it goes.
@dbongino He don't have room to talk about meat eaters.
@LionelMedia He gets on my nerves.
@AOCpress You are one crazy lady.
@raratimmar @MerrittKelly1 @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump Why
@raratimmar @MerrittKelly1 @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump About what?
@johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump You're just as fake as the rest. You offend me.
@MerrittKelly1 @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump Yeah and fake news media shouldn't cover all the DemWits running for president or entertainers prancing around stages half naked and singing degrading lyrics.
@johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump I used to like you until you started bad mouthing Trump.
@johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump And......
@dbongino Tell that to the Satanists that are eating baby parts.
@mitchellvii Prayers for you and family.
@dbongino She can apologize but doesn't change how she feels.  My father's family came from Germany and were Jewish although they quit practicing it when they immigrated here.
@JackPosobiec Love them cows.  Nothing beats a good steak dinner.
@charliekirk11 That was funny.
@realDonaldTrump Quit trying to deal with them and build that wall.
@LindseyGrahamSC Declare a national emergency and quit trying to deal with DemWits.
@BreakingNLive Ain't happening.  She's delusional.
@SenSchumer Great family photo. Beautiful.
@senatemajldr That includes you Mitch.
@IPOT1776 Pitiful
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump ESAD palmer report
@realDonaldTrump Awesome speech.  Would like to see abortion abolished.  We are killing our future.  BUILD THAT WALL.
@LisaMarieBoothe She appeared nervous and unsure of herself.
@LisaMarieBoothe Great speech.  I agree with everything he said.  Happy he took a stand on partial birth abortion but would like to see the heinous practice abolished.
@DevinNunes Amen.
@JudicialWatch You know how it is. The laws/rules just don't apply to Democrats.
@ashnicoleb23 Who doesn't love u?
@JackPosobiec Unbelievable.  Wicked people.
@vahousegop @dbongino @VAHouseDems Their hearts and minds have been seared over with a hot iron.  These narcissists have no conscience.
@ashnicoleb23 Me
@ashnicoleb23 I'm depressed too. I hate winter
@KennedyB420 @dbongino No lady. My thoughts are I have no idea why everybody hates everybody.  We live in the greatest country in the world.
@Ray17278912 Get some psych help.
@dbongino Dunno. They should move to Africa.  I've heard they're killing white folks there.
@KellyannePolls Schiff is a piece of schitt.
@RepAdamSchiff Schiff, you're full of schitt
@ashnicoleb23 Pick a goodun.  Anne is depressed.
@65TAA @jasoninthehouse TY for explaining.
@jasoninthehouse Why does Trump need her permission?
@ashnicoleb23 Why r u crying
@ashnicoleb23 No. Don't even think it.
@greta None of the above.  Fox only has a couple that can tell the truth and even they won't tell whole truth.
@IPOT1776 You are being censored apparently.
@realDonaldTrump Is Q real?  I'm losing faith in that bunch.
@realDonaldTrump Open govt up, pay people, declare SOE, take money you need and forget about the dumb Dimwits.   Problem solved.
@RepAdamSchiff Schiff you're full of schitt.
@RandPaul @RepThomasMassie @SenMikeLee Happy Birthday Senator.
@greta @realDonaldTrump Undoubtedly.
@IPOT1776 @YouTube One can hope though it will get worse before it gets better.   They probably wish we would all just die.
@RandPaul Everything.  Govt is tooo big. Trump really really needs to drain the swamp, aka Washington DC.
@RandPaul Insurance
@JackPosobiec Didn't know she was sick until she didn't show up for work today.
@DanaPerino No. Stupid DemWits.
@charliekirk11 Sounds legit.
@LindseyGrahamSC I heard on main stream media that torture works real well.
@seanhannity Good.  She needs to retire already.
@realDonaldTrump They are the Deep State mouthpieces.  That's why we don't listen to them.
@bellametrics Dumb Demshit.
@ashnicoleb23 Really?????
@BarryEhlert Beautiful little girl.
@Lisa_Twaronite That ain't pain. That's just plain stupid and ill mannered.
@Franklin_Graham @FoxNews @facebook I hate FB jail.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS Why give Mexico, etc 10.6 billion in aid money?
@charliekirk11 True but ya ain't taking my guns.
@ashnicoleb23 And me.
@AmyMek Stuff her full of bacon.
@dbongino Corker has no spine and a yellow stripe down his back. He's the white stuff on top of chicken shit.
@realDonaldTrump @dbongino Invite the homeless in to break bread with you.   You are in my thoughts and prayers.  Love you Mr. President.
@Comey You are a swamp rat sir.
@prayingmedic Boo hoo.  Just give Trump the money for a wall and they'll get paychecks.   Trump should just keep the 10.6 billion in aid going to Mexico and South America. Problem solved.
@realDonaldTrump BS.  Drain the swamp and you won't have to contend with them.
@realDonaldTrump Just leave govt shut down. Rep and Dems do nothing anyway except line their deep State pockets with tax payer money. Quit paying the lowlifes and maybe they'll work.
@IPOT1776 Who is it for?   This is a nothing burger.
@LindseyGrahamSC I thought Russia/Syria asked us to leave?
@ChuckGrassley Good job sir.  Just imagine what could be done if y'all worked together every day like we, the peons, elected y'all to do.
@prayingmedic Yeah we've seen how they handle things.
@SpeakerRyan Good riddance.
@senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan BS.  He's corrupted  according to Q.
@LindseyGrahamSC Wrong.
@realDonaldTrump Drain the swamp then like you said you would.
@prayingmedic Where's the cajones?  Does he have em?
@AlanDersh Not good.
@guypbenson @SpeakerRyan He's corrupt
@mitchellvii No. The damn fools would electrocute themselves then their families would sue US for wrongful death.  Otherwise I don't have a problem with that.
@senatemajldr And what about the wall funding?
@marthamaccallum @AnnCoulter Could be. We voted for a wall and we want the damned wall.
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews Let him go. He did the world a favor.  When are you gonna quit letting jackwagons tell you what is right and wrong. Use some common sense.
@ChuckCallesto Shut him down.  Taxpayers just made him richer.
@prayingmedic Who can you trust anymore?
@realDonaldTrump And what is being done about it?  Honestly.
@ChuckCallesto I really can't stand Mueller
@RichardGrenell Y'all should boycott CNN.  They would lose the last 10 people that watch them.  If not for Fox News, nobody would have heard this libtard say that.
@jasoninthehouse Yes. We voted for a dam wall and we want it.
@JackPosobiec Another Witch Hunt.  Meanwhile Hill and Bill and Obummer go their merry ways.
@mitchellvii I guess.
@mitchellvii @YouTube Can't stand judge napolitano
@NicolleDWallace @JackPosobiec Confides to friends?  And I guess you're one of them.
@JackPosobiec Good for him.  It was a waste of money.
@ashnicoleb23 May.
@ashnicoleb23 You mean Annie?  Ya gotta have that boy first.
@ashnicoleb23 When ya movin
@Lrihendry He will win by a landslide. I promise.
@JudicialWatch And just why?
@kimguilfoyle Roll em out.
@ashnicoleb23 I'll get you an eye dr appt when u get home.
@ashnicoleb23 Get ur butt home. U shouldn't be out and about alone.
@ashnicoleb23 I used to get like that so I know what it means.
@ashnicoleb23 Green hair and nails.
@marthamaccallum @guypbenson My husband votes the way I tell him to. He's really a closet Republican I think.
@ashnicoleb23 One can dream. Cold and wet here.
@ashnicoleb23 Bummer.
@ashnicoleb23 Yeah.  When I first saw you.
@ashnicoleb23 Well I wanna know.   I need some happy news for a change.
@ashnicoleb23 My baby. Wish you were home so I could just hold you.
@prayingmedic Wonder if he knows Hill and Bill.
@patton6966 Great news to hear.
@DeplorableTrump @MaggyBeeee Then release declass docs.  Unseal indictments.  And drain the swamp.  Simple.
@AdamSchiff You're full of schitt Schiff.
@ashnicoleb23 BS. Ur already married.
@CydEHargis Wasn't doctored. I watched the press conference.
@foxandfriends Flaky Flake???  That's funny. Trump will rip him a new one.
@ashnicoleb23 Just come home then.   Papaw will come get you.
@dbongino Must be some major cheating going on then.
@ShannonBream Go to sleep.  I did my part. I voted.
@ashnicoleb23 What's on fire
@IPOT1776 I don't know how to do memes but Hi anyway.
@IngrahamAngle She's just one reason for a red wave.
@foxandfriends No
@ashnicoleb23 Try it again Pooh Bear.
@ashnicoleb23 She sure does miss you.
@letsgomathias @jack Can't stand this woman. Don't understand why anybody listens to her. Deport her.
@charliekirk11 @SebGorka Can't tolerate Al.
@prayingmedic I always said he had a sense of humor.
@IngrahamAngle @CNNPolitics Is he saying his job makes him sick?
@ashnicoleb23 Turn em loose.
@ashnicoleb23 Mustard tastes better going down than coming up.
@IPOT1776 Prayers for you and your family.
@ashnicoleb23 Me too.
@ashnicoleb23 We try.   We fall short many times.  Somehow we get it done.
@ashnicoleb23 Not me.  I'm celibate.  And old.
@GiannoCaldwell I thought he did good.  He was sincere and genuine.  He is real. Give me real over fake people anytime.
@ashnicoleb23 Kid is a stupid brat.
@GiannoCaldwell He's a very intelligent and talented young man.
@RealJamesWoods He's an ugly woman.
@patton6966 What....
@SourcedReports Shameful.   F***in liberal no-brain Democrats.
@Yamiche Prayers
@leeleeb50 Women need to learn to be women again.
@ashnicoleb23 Baby is hungry.
@foxandfriends No
@FoxBusiness @SenBlumenthal That said from a first class liar.
@TheRealFletch24 I know. I don't have any either
@seanhannity Better frisk him for a wire.
@FoxFriendsFirst Yes
@marthamaccallum It's a school boy prank.   My boys used to keep a girls underwear.  They're boys.  Their main focus is getting laid.
@greta Greta it's a repressed memory.  Not reliable. Think about it.
@FoxFriendsFirst Yes. No point in waiting. I don't believe her.
@FoxFriendsFirst Because of Democrats.
@RealJamesWoods Idiot ragheads.
@foxandfriends Stupid stupid people
@HillaryClinton Go away somewhere. Like Gitmo.
@stephenfhayes Who the hail are you?
@RepMattGaetz With all you know, you still don't do jack schitt about any of it.
@FoxFriendsFirst Now that's funny.
@ashnicoleb23 What did I say
@ashnicoleb23 Annie/Nanny sure do miss you.
@TheRealFletch24 I've never heard of MM.
@TheRealFletch24 I'm happy for you. Wish you all the best in life.
@TheRealFletch24 Smack the shit out of em but not thank em.
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain Why?  I had no respect for him.
@RichLowry It's not petty.  I agree with him. U must be a libtard.
@DineshDSouza No no no
@ashnicoleb23 Why not.  We had that last nite
@prayingmedic @PressSec Hilarious
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @RealDrGina Keep in mind. Our govt can get away with these biased crooked legal practices on any US citizen.
@JosephNSanberg Yeah. Get rid of their govvernor
@cvpayne She would sing a different tune if was her or her daughter.
@Yamiche Sounds legit to me.
@WalshFreedom You reckon?
@ashnicoleb23 LOL.  Why couldn't she just message you and say "'I love you."   I do you know.
@ashnicoleb23 A guilty conscience makes people say a lot of things
@SecondLady @VP @CNN Good job SL Pence.
@greta Cause she wants paid not to.  These gold diggers burn my ass.
@george_capen @realDonaldTrump I love the job Trump is doing. I also have a high IQ.  I might be deplorable but not a stupid deplorable.   I think you might be that white stuff on top of chicken shit. It's still chicken shit.
@marklevinshow Facebook is censoring conservatives.  They won't let me post anything by Q.
@GovMikeHuckabee Send her back to Palestine.
@kilmeade @foxandfriends She needs to go back to her day job.
@seanhannity That take a number and wait in line approach for health care services kills people off faster. Ask the veterans. That's what they had.
@FoxFriendsFirst She's full of crap.
@WalshFreedom I'm not following you.  Why in hell are you on my newsfeed.
@greta I get my news on YouTube
@TheRealFletch24 Why
@SarahPalinUSA Trump was anointed by God to be President.  My dog talks to God more than she does.
@RepMattGaetz @Twitter @VICE @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes Yep Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google.
@JacobAWohl Yes she did.
@FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters @TomiLahren @WattersWorld That ain't even remotely funny. Her mind is warped if she thinks train wrecks is interesting.
@Education4Libs That would be interesting.  What she said that is.
@FoxNews Ain't gonna happen.
@WalshFreedom Not me. I love Trump
@sjcloobeck Ur an asshole.
@trish_regan Your full of crap Trish Regan. You are Fake News.
@RandPaul John Brennan is the imbecile. Republican Patriots are where they've always been...backing Trump. JB and his Deep State cronies are running scared.
@LindseyGrahamSC Why?  Do you think Putin is a Democrat?
@AmyConley41 hey. Welcome to Twitter.
@realDonaldTrump Only because of you.
@AlanDersh I support my President.  These people are committing a crime when they cross our borders. Criminals DO NOT get to keep their children with them.  Although he did sign an EO allowing them to.
@RandPaul Happy Independence Day to you and your family.  Proud to be an American.
@GiannoCaldwell @TeamCavuto @FoxNews No
@ashnicoleb23 Your mouth girl.
@ashnicoleb23 GTR?
@realDonaldTrump Dems are deluded.
@greta We're still here.
@cvpayne Charles, you shouldn't even acknowledge these idiots with a response.   Where we go one, we go all.  When they go low, you go high.
@ashnicoleb23 What did you do?
@SarahPalinUSA They need to start charging and arresting these people.
@HeatherChilders @POTUS Boycott Red Hen.
@SenGillibrand Hell no. PP shouldn't get another dime of tax payer money.   PP does far more damage than good.
@greta So sorry for your loss.
Wouldn't it be great to matter to somebody.
@ReaIKimJongUn welcome to twitter.
@cvpayne @RealDrGina @FoxBusiness Not at the rate they're going.
@ashnicoleb23 Now Ash......
@dbongino Screw CNN.  Unreliable. Disreputable. Liars   Dumb and dumber.  They use up oxygen that good people could be breathing.
@AmbJohnBolton @RegSprecher And the wicked witch of the west looks like she's pretending to wear the pants with the necessary equipment to go with it.  Deep State embecile is all she is.
@ashnicoleb23 Who knows!!!
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for announcing the #ProtectLife rule to stop Title X tax dollars going to abortion orgs! https://t.co/0Lvzyaxq1E
@GOP We are all just two legged animals that learned at some point, to walk in an upright position.  I've heard of gorillas doing that also.
@pastormarkburns Handsome little dude. Happy Birthday.
@GOP God bless you young lady.  Prayers for a successful future.
@Franklin_Graham Tragic and heartbreaking.
@chuckwoolery Why don't she just sit down and shut up like a good girl.
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods I love Sarah.
@mercedesschlapp @mschlapp Did you walk out?
@dbongino Shameful.
@marklevinshow He better. He's verrry close to losing his seat.  Gonna vote him out.
Is Twitter censoring conservatives?  I signed up on Twitter for one reason. To get Donald Trump's tweets. They never show up on the feed. I have to hunt them.
@TheRealFletch24 My apologies then.
@TheRealFletch24 I used to think well of you. My sympathies were wasted it seems.
@RealCandaceO God bless you.  My favorite quote "free at last, free at last, thank God I'm free at last."
Mike Pompeo is a great pick for Secretary of State. @RandPaul, as your constituent I urge you: #ConfirmPompeo!! https://t.co/K7p4WjJBNR
@seanhannity Deep State is fighting hard to take Trump down and anyone else connected.  They will lose.
@BillOReilly Really!
@realDonaldTrump Deep State?
@ashnicoleb23 No
@Education4Libs Cover up.
@johncardillo Trey can't press charges against anybody.  He can only uncover shit.  It is up to DOJ to press charges and hold people accountable.
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Wromg
@greta You should've fed those puppies before you left and quit leaving stuff on the counter.
@RandPaul You're going to get voted out of your seat Senator.
@MarkSimoneNY Too funny
@realDonaldTrump When are indictments coming down on all the Swamp Rats?  Send all their treasonous asses to Gitmo.
@brithume McCabe lied and lied and lied.
@dbongino Maybe they have a sealed indictment on him.
@Comey And you, JC, are not. You're nothing more than stink on the bottom of his shoe.
No to CRA.@RandPaul reversal of Obama-era policies created an open internet free of gov’t control. Reject the CRA https://t.co/km9iq1jAwW
@RealJack You're a piece of shit Jack.
@Franklin_Graham He knows the truth now.
@cvpayne Yes
@StephenMilIer Not even remotely funny. Is that the best you can do to get your sorry name on Twitter feed.
@dbongino Sounds legit.
@WalshFreedom I don't think it was a surprise.
@SenateMajLdr And what did you do?  You sure as hell didn't support Trump when he was running for President.
@realDonaldTrump What's up?
@RealJack It's magic.
@realDonaldTrump Good job Mr. President
@dbongino But the NRA members have guns. Doesn't make sense.
@donaldktodd @TiffersYUPP @jlhatty @DianeToucan @thedailybeast @davidfrum @realDonaldTrump Don Todd, I think you see in him that which is within yourself.
@chuckwoolery Nope.  He just likes spending tax payer money.
@RealJamesWoods Sick.
@realDonaldTrump The Deplorables care. Good job Mr. President.
@marklevinshow And....
@chuckwoolery Should be fun watching the weasels squirm but nobody can beat Trump.  He's our man.
@RealJack I wonder.  Seems pretty slow to me and millions of other Americans.  At this rate, Bill and Hill will be dead of old age.
@SarahPalinUSA Good job Mr. President.
@w_terrence They aren't Christians.  Not even close to it.
@realDonaldTrump Sounds legit to me.
@seanhannity Trump should do the opposite of what she says.  He should tell Rocketman if he don't get with the program, he'll squash him like a bug.
@RealJack She's full of black shit.
@stephenfhayes All of you idiots underestimate Trump.
@RealJack CNN is a nonstop comedy routine.
@Franklin_Graham An all too common tragedy these days.
@FoxNews Does he know he's black?  Who is the racist here?
@marklevinshow Nobody gives a shit.
@BuckSexton Cause Trump ain't a pussy as all the others have been you dimwit.
@marklevinshow You're wrong
@FoxNews Hang him high
@SarahPalinUSA I used to like her until she started attacking Trump.
@GovMikeHuckabee @FoxBusiness That should be interesting.
@JacobAWohl Amen. Prayers answered.
@SenateMajLdr They can dream.
@RepLeeZeldin @ADL_National Does he know he's black?
@seanhannity We may forgive but we don't forget
@RepMattGaetz Why?
@RealJack Thank God.
@realDonaldTrump Sign executive order to stop the killing of elephants and trophy wildlife in Africa.  Let the people starve if you want. Too many people there anyway.
@greta Greta you know what white lies are.  Quit with the dumb blonde routine.
@ericbolling Time doesn't heal all wounds.
@Google I believe in equality.  But I believe in Moms staying at home and taking care of her kids first.
@Franklin_Graham @facebook That is sick. They didn't ask me.
@StephenMilIer Very sad.
@FoxNews Fire her and Sheriff Israel.
@DonaldJTrumpJr A dependent people offers no resistance.
@RealJack Sounds like vote buying. Isn't that illegal?
@ashnicoleb23 Nope.  Ain't happening.
@GovMikeHuckabee Billy didn't save them. God did.
@cvpayne Yes yes yes
@ashnicoleb23 Pick me.
@TuckerCarlson I think a whole lot of people noticed that one Tucker.  It ain't gonna fly.
@realDonaldTrump Due process is a Constitutional right.  Don't mess with that.
@PrisonPlanet What are we supposed to do about it?
@Cernovich True
@FoxNews @BarbraStreisand @HillaryClinton Yeah we said that about Obama.
@GovMikeHuckabee Lord let's hope not.
@RealSaavedra Cover up
@carrieksada @Hoosiers1986 @CarmineZozzora @RuthieRedSox @_SierraWhiskee @michaelbeatty3 @LVNancy @phil200269 @steph93065 @SandraTXAS @ChristieC733 I don't like this kid much.
@realDonaldTrump Be nice to fire Sessions.  But realize not a good idea at this time.
@Looby007 @realDonaldTrump Actually 50%.
@EliotMackey @realDonaldTrump Those danged Mexicans breed like bunnies.
@LennyGhoul @realDonaldTrump Being Christian has nothing to do with being president.  Dumb DemWits.
@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Go back to India Patel.  Your tribe is missing their idiot.
@chuckwoolery Bust his ass. He doesn't look like a high school kid. Something stinks here.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Damn Democrats. Cheating as always.
@JudicialWatch Crooked witch.
@ashnicoleb23 Don't even think it.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump They're the white stuff on top of chicken shit. It's still chicken shit.
@ashnicoleb23 Maybe
@cvpayne @foxandfriends @FoxNews No. Unions contribute union dues paid by Republican workers to Democrat candidates.  My husband's union said they would take him to polls to ensure he voted Dem many years ago.  Turned me against unions.
@SarahPalinUSA Boycott these airlines
@chuckwoolery Trump does. The rest of them...no. Their ultimate goal is to abolish 2nd Amendment and confiscate our guns.
@benshapiro Most men can't accept responsibility for their own mistakes.  Goes back to Adam and Eve. Blame someone else.
@cvpayne They were neutered males. Probably Democrats.
@RepLeeZeldin Probably a bunch of panty waisted snowflake DemWits
@JaniceDean Nope
@WalshFreedom Boycott these companies.
@seanhannity If Trump was a dictator, he would put liberals in FEMA camps and bring back the guillotine.
@DineshDSouza Truth
@derekahunter They always blame anybody but the guilty party. Wouldn't surprise me if they get everyone feeling sorry for the Mexican kid and he walks free.
@dbongino No
@benshapiro @enterprisecares Enterprise sucks. Boycott Enterprise.
@SteveScalise And if Republicans win 2018, they can amend that bill and make tax cuts permanent.
@mitchellvii Nope. Can't think of anything.
@StephenMilIer Yep
@marklevinshow He must be a Democrat. No balls.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Great speech.
@EnergyInDepth @NYCMayor He's a dipshit.
@RealJack Bullshit. They fed them the questions.  Leave it to Dems to f**k up everything
@BarackObama You're a disgusting POS
@StephenMilIer I hate Dems
@seanhannity Firing squad should take her out.  I'm a woman and I'll never vote for a woman for anything. Democrats have destroyed this country.
@jasoninthehouse @Reuters Suspect is DEAD
@laurenpeikoff @jasoninthehouse Home made bomb. Suspect is in police custody
@benshapiro @trish_regan That would cause civil war.
@williamlegate @TravelGov Too bad ur an idiot.
@jasoninthehouse I read it was hand grenade type bomb and police have suspect in custody.
@KatiePavlich I agree with Trump.
@johncardillo Is this censorship?
@davidwebbshow @Twitter Yep. My unfollow was kicked in. I hit the Follow button again.
@RealJack Yeah they love the dumb Dems.
@ashnicoleb23 What's a vine thread
@JackPosobiec DemWits are like a dog with a bone.
@BretBaier @krauthammer Heavenly Father we pray for our good friend, Charles, that you  will touch his body and heal his infirmities.  Give him strength and renew his spirit.  In Jesus name we ask.  Amen
@FoxFriendsFirst Just a crutch.
@mitchellvii Democrats are idiots.
@chuckwoolery Now that's real bright. She's messing with the wrong people.
@mitchellvii Screw the DemWits.
@greta Wasn't the Russians. It was those damned liberal Democrats.
@HeyTammyBruce That was painful. And funny.
@FoxNews @bigbangtheory @missmayim @NRA Nothing worse than a fool.
@MarkYoungTruth @AdamSchiffCA Chicken shit.
@FoxBusiness @RepAdamSchiff Schiff is that white stuff on top of chicken shit.  It's still chicken shit.
@ArthurSchwartz She's the stupidest of the DemWits.
@RealJack Liberals are trash.
@SarahPalinUSA I hate liberals.
@JudicialWatch We would like to know. Total waste of money.
@RealJack But we don't take this bullshit laying down anymore. We fight back. I'm sick of Trump bashers.
@ByronYork We voted for Trump because We believed he was the best. Russia had NOTHING to do with our vote. If ur gonna cry about foreign meddling, then u would have to stop U.S. Meddling in foreign elections u huge POS.
@realDonaldTrump Bite em hard Mr President.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Ur full of shit and I'm sick of you and your friends. Ur tongue is loose at both ends.  You put a silver haired devil to shame.
@amyschumer @SenSchumer @Everytown We don't need more laws. We need for the laws we have be enforced. We need the FBI, etc to get off their ass and do their job. We need accountability of elected officials. We need for Congress and Senate to stop bickering and work together to find solutions.
@realDonaldTrump All of you snowflake liberals are mentally disturbed.
@FoxNews @Dennis_Kucinich Wrong
@realDonaldTrump You need to start a page just for Deplorables.  All these other ass wipes get on my nerves.
@hylh58 @realDonaldTrump Speak English.
@Liz_Wheeler Great idea.
@ashnicoleb23 I don't know why they follow me to begin with.
@dbongino Nah the Dems will play this till eternity.
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump I think he did. Do you really presume Putin gives a rat's ass what anybody thinks?
@TeamCavuto @RepSwalwell And it didn't effect my vote. I intended to vote for Trump from the get go. Why? Because God told me to.
@realDonaldTrump Ignore the snowflake liberal DemWits.  The Deplorables elected you and love the job ur doing. And we will re-elect you.
@seanhannity @JudgeJeanine Must've had their minds on something else.
@ashnicoleb23 How'd u manage that?  If they are in that room, you'll never find them.
@RepMarkMeadows Yeah. Just why?
@ABC Love my President.
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight No
@FoxNews @SteveScalise @IngrahamAngle Snowflake DemWits.
@seanhannity @RealDrGina They had signs. Nobody did anything about it. They can only blame themselves if blame must be assessed.
@dbongino She's just another DemWit liberal snowflake.  I own guns and they haven't killed anybody.
@FoxNews Amen
@FoxNews Sheit is full of shit.
@StephenMilIer I'm betting he's mentally incompetent to stand trial.
@seanhannity Tragic.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Or dope.
@PastorJohnHagee Not true.
@seanhannity Somebody put a stopper in her mouth.
@newtgingrich I agree
@RealJamesWoods I love President Trump.
@SharylAttkisson I'm gonna unfollow tou
@CollinRugg CNN is a very sadistic joke.
@thebradfordfile Nah. Don't tell him.
@mitchellvii Empty headed POS.
@kimguilfoyle Awesome
@ashnicoleb23 Unless they're queer then they'll spread those butt cheeks as wide as they'll go.
@EnergyInDepth @NYCMayor He's a funny idiot.
@Cheylovesyouuuu Let me drive ur car.
@StephenMilIer How you figure?  Tax cuts isn't torture unless you ain't gettin one.
@GiannoCaldwell Yes
@RealJamesWoods Hang em high.
@ChadPergram Your full of Schift.
@JessieJaneDuff Good bye.
@FoxNews As a Republican, I am offended by Democrats.  Especially that bitch Joy Behar.
@RealJamesWoods Trey Gowdy is one of the good guys.  What the hell is wrong with you. The weasel is Obama and Hillary is his harlot.  And that's an insult to furry weasels.
@docdhj @Craigsawyer @Solari @thomaspaine @stealthjeff @Lrihendry Swamp rats.
@SebGorka Another Democrat POS that ought to be hanged.
RT @JordanSekulow: Radio: NEW TEXTS: President Obama “Wants to Know Everything” https://t.co/hVKHUyMqvB
@DineshDSouza Probably not.  Americans will never trust them again.
@realDonaldTrump Let me see them.  I wanna watch too.
@ashnicoleb23 Must not be ur friends
@ashnicoleb23 Not good.
@HeatherChilders @POTUS @DrDarrinPorcher @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews No
@marklevinshow Neither
@foxandfriends Bullshit.
@greta Good morning Greta.
@TheRealFletch24 Happens to me all the time. But it's like pouring water on a duck's back. It gets to where you don't care what the world thinks.  I like me.
@Cheylovesyouuuu Brown eyes are sexy.
@MikeTokes @RepGosar As they should be. Hang em high in front of the White House as an example.
@marklevinshow What do you expect them to say.
@ChuckGrassley To Dems, they are just election fodder.
@ashnicoleb23 Except eucalyptus. I'm allergic and so are dogs. The fumes from anything eucalyptus poisons their systems.
@Fahrenthold @wvgazettemail Imagine having to count all those pills by hand.
@mitchellvii Couldn't get on
@EricHolder You're full of yourself.  Hope you go to jail.
@mitchellvii I do hope these people will be fired without collecting any benefits.
@mitchellvii Nope.
@prayingmedic Who gives a shit.
@TGowdySC You will be missed.  You're my favorite. Thank you for your integrity, your honesty and your service.
@greta Don't care. Don't watch it. Hate football.
@ashnicoleb23 Proud of you little lady.
@kmbiamnozie @realDonaldTrump Guess he will lose his seat
@foxandfriends No surprise. DemWits are common.
@TheRealFletch24 Me either.
@SenSchumer You DemWits spikes the fires of division
@WalshFreedom But all too true
@ashnicoleb23 Better get home and get good night's sleep.  What happened with auntie?
@SharylAttkisson @realDonaldTrump I think it's a setup.  Hope Trump doesn't fall for it  and refuses to testify.  They've got nothing.
@ashnicoleb23 Something good?
@FiredFBIBoss Your a big piece of shit.
@dbongino Sounds like a plan. But it won't fly.
@VP @POTUS I really would like to know God's purpose in creating Democrats.
@mitchellvii Good, good and good.
@FoxNews Ain't she dead yet?
@Peoples_Pundit Go ahead punk. Make my day. I like that one better.
@FoxBusiness Maytag is the best anyway.
@ashnicoleb23 Who?  I'll stomp their ass
@TheRealFletch24 I used to have a 77 Grand Prix. Loved that car. Broke my heart when Jamie wrecked it and totaled it.
@ashnicoleb23 @JeffreeStar Not good.
@TheRealFletch24 But I love Alvin.  He had pizzazz and he could sing.
@MarkYoungTruth @BFT_Podcast Wish old George would disappear
@ScottPresler Everybody hates everybody it seems.
@JonahNRO Beautiful fur babies. Love em.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump No surprise. Somebody just needs to leak them. Where's Wikileaks?
@ashnicoleb23 Today?
@GiannoCaldwell Give em nothing and just deport them all. And send the dam Dems with them. I'm tired of listening to this bullshit
@TuckerCarlson They get more lame and pathetic every time they open their mouths.  You gotta pity that level of stupidity.
@seanhannity This woman is just plain stupid.
@SharylAttkisson And the crap gets deeper.
@FoxNews Very insensitive. Ignore Cher.  It's just a ploy to draw attention to herself.
@FoxNews @MonicaCrowley @IngrahamAngle I don't like Laura ingraham
@ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump @edhenry @FoxNews @foxnewsnight He didn't say that.
@ashnicoleb23 U don't listen to me at all.
@saxonlh @nytimes Nor do we care what you DemWits think.
@KatiePavlich Yeah right. That's gonna help them.  Not.
@ashnicoleb23 No more
@seanhannity Crybaby snowflake
@FoxBusiness @SenSchumer Lying SOS DemWit.
@B75434425 That is rude.
@ABC He should tell Meuller and ABC to kiss his ass
@GiannoCaldwell More fake polls
@mitchellvii Nothing
@SharylAttkisson You are right Ms. Attkisson.
@WiredSources Two peas in a pod... dumb and dumber.
@RealJamesWoods Love Trey Gowdy. Bless his heart.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe the Russians retrieved them.
@mitchellvii Vladimir must be Laughing his ass off.
@mitchellvii She's an idiot.
@mitchellvii LOL. That's a good one.
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for your kindness.
@GiannoCaldwell A tattoo parlor?
@ashnicoleb23 Why not
@KelemenCari Utter bullshit.
@MAGAPILL They ain't under rocks.
@JudicialWatch Makes me furious.
American people deserve to see the memo. #ReleaseTheMemo
@cvpayne Very convenient. They've learned Killary's tricks.
@realDonaldTrump Shameful
@JaniceDean Awesome
@SenCapito DemWits
@FoxNews @robreiner @realDonaldTrump Screw him.
@SebGorka Right on target.
@Franklin_Graham @FoxNews @foxandfriends @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I voted for him and will again.
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews Bullshit
@PoliticalShort Fire every last one of em and start fresh.
@greta Pay no attention
@ericbolling All of them are 2yr olds in a sandbox w/1 shovel.  Wish Trump would drain swamp faster. Get rid of dickwad Dems and republicans.
@JacobAWohl Bullshit foul.
@SharylAttkisson How convenient
@JudicialWatch This is just plain wrong.  How do you send this to Trump?
@JudicialWatch Well Judicial Watch, he did offer to use his own planes but he was told he has to use AF1.  Where were you when that little black weasel and his hesheit were hopping around the world spending money like water?
@seanhannity Lock her up.
@mitchellvii Only in the eyes of the beholders of the black weasel.
@FoxNews Dumb DemWits.
@charliekirk11 @RepAdamSchiff Drain the swamp and lock em up.
@madi_webbx Where at
@mitchellvii Ya think. Sure hope your sources are right.  But does anybody know where the little weasel, Obama, is hiding out at?
@seanhannity That looks like a shit eating grin on her face.
@dbongino One can hope.
@SenateMajLdr Who knows the minds of DemWits.
@StephenMilIer DemWits
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews Douche bag lying sleaze ball.
@FoxNews @PressSec @POTUS Love him.
@FiveRights Drain the swamp.
@KellyannePolls Love him
@SebGorka Disgusting man
@realDonaldTrump I just can't stand whiny ass DemWit liberal snowflakes.  You people disgust me. You're talking to the President of the U.S.   Have you no respect even for yourselves.
@FoxBusiness Utter bullshit. Nobody cares
@GiannoCaldwell @naacpimageaward @RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Crazy DemWit
@realDonaldTrump All goes back to Shadow Govt.
@charliekirk11 Crazy demWits.
@realDonaldTrump Right.
@ashnicoleb23 I get like that a lot
@ChrisSalcedoTX @TheDemocrats No
@JohnKasich Ur mouth is moving....must be lying.
@BarackObama Sit down and shut up
@MikeTokes @ICRC @TheJusticeDept @FBI @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump What does it mean?
@ericbolling Wasn't she confused about whether she was a boy or girl?
@FoxNews @RepWilson @POTUS Embarrassing to be seen with you.  You're fake fake
@JohnKasich Nobody is listening to you.
@mitchellvii Republicans will win in 2018 and Trump will win 2020.  Bunch of rats jumping ship as it is.
@SharylAttkisson Smoke stacks?
@JoelOsteen You said it.
@FoxNews That's great. Keep their sorry butts home.
@dbongino Why yes. I think it is too.
@JohnKasich He didn't say it. You're just a foul smelling dickwad.
@realDonaldTrump Pay no attention to Satan's minions.  God has your back. And so do we, the American voters.   You have 7 years to right the wrongs and drain the swamp.
@GovMikeHuckabee Unfortunately we can't get away from him no matter what planet we're on.
@realDonaldTrump Dems are dumb and dumber.
@Yamiche Bullshit. Haiti is a shithole. Go live there and see for yourself.
@JebBush @POTUS Blow smoke up ur own ass.  Trumpers don't believe anything out of ur bushy mouth.
@SharylAttkisson But they did.
@mitchellvii Lot of shitholes in this world.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Yes
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews That's how they cheat.
@DineshDSouza Must be Dems
@SteveScalise Prayers for you
@brithume @Twitter I'd like to know the answer to that.
@JudicialWatch Government wasteful spending.
@cvpayne That makes him a racist for hating white, Republican Trumpers.
@Marple82 Ky
@LawrenceBJones3 Me.
@seanhannity That's why NOBODY watches CNN.
@FoxNews Craziness.
@DineshDSouza BS is full of bs.
@TheRealFletch24 I like it.
@dmartosko I am shocked.
@ashnicoleb23 That was so sweet of him.
@ashnicoleb23 It's a cutie. Like James.
@seanhannity Why do you even give her air time?  She's a lunatic.
@greta @FoxNews That would be snowflake pantywaisted liberal Dems. They love talking trash.
@FoxNews @stephenfhayes Fox is full of shit.
@greta He's a jerk. Rich. But still a jerk.
@greta @johnpcoale I love your dogs Greta.
@ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends @FoxNews Time will tell
@MarkSimoneNY Go Trump.
@RealJamesWoods No. Blazing Saddles was the best.
@mitchellvii Cold. Very very cold. How bout that global warming.
@ashnicoleb23 Don't cha jus luv it.
@realDonaldTrump There will be peace after Armageddon.
@MeghanMcCain You need to get on the Trump Train.
@ashnicoleb23 No
@cvpayne He sure was handsome.
@RedPillBlack Bullshit
@FiredFBIBoss Not quite. You're a POS.
@DanaPerino Go ahead and eat it. You might die tomorrow and look what you missed out on.
@DineshDSouza Deport that BS. Or something. Trump's our man.
@VP @POTUS LOL. That's a dream world. Iran isn't gonna loosen its grip on anything.  And what USA thinks doesn't amount to a hill of beans to them.
@cvpayne I'm not real good at math but looks to me like NYC is losing money. Perhaps cutting spending would help.  When snowflake pantywaist liberals start cussing, you know they haven't a clue.
@ashnicoleb23 Not good
@ericbolling They should. And more.
@davidwebbshow @POTUS @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @SiriusXMPatriot @SXMProgress @SXMPolitics Good
@FiveRights Put the nobody Congresswoman in the cargo hold. Problem solved.
@RealMattCouch It's back up now.
@RealMattCouch What???  Nooo.....
@SenateMajLdr Merry Christmas Senator McConnell
@seanhannity God bless you Sean Hannity
@cvpayne Merry Christmas to you and yours
@DiamondandSilk Now that would be funny.
@FoxNews Where in hell do you get these polls from.  Must be surveying Dems.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Very odd.
@johncardillo @realDonaldTrump One can only hope.
@TheRealFletch24 Photoshopped
@cvpayne There wasn't a racial divide until Obama opened it. Perhaps now it can heal once and for all.  Very few Americans care what color or nationality anybody is.  We just want to get along peacefully.
@MAGAPILL Not the conservative republicans.   We all knew obummer and his merry gang of thieves was ripping us off everywhere he turned.  I'm ashamed they were Americans.
@AllenWest Shameful.  Obama should have to face a firing squad.  And stand Hillary and Bill with him for moral support.
@DineshDSouza Show us the letters.
@mitchellvii Just keep believing that and Trump will win in a landslide.
@SenateMajLdr Good job Senator McConnell
@UPS Good luck soldier.
@GiannoCaldwell A+.  He's done an amazing job. And he's just plain awesome.
@ashnicoleb23 It's the final countdown!!!
@FoxBusiness @TheJuanWilliams Can't fire him. He's their black quota.
@ashnicoleb23 You're fine pooh bear.
@ashnicoleb23 Eight more days
@ashnicoleb23 Not so.
@ashnicoleb23 I looked. It is in northern Ky.  Holds the country's gold reserves.
@ashnicoleb23 Girl can't know everything.
@TheRealFletch24 Scare me bad.
@TheRealFletch24 What's up?
@BreitbartNews They can get over themselves. It ain't happening.
@ashnicoleb23 And did he?
@seanhannity Kick ass for doing this kid that way.
@JacobAWohl Interesting
@FoxNews @lindseyvonn Good. She can stay home.
@FoxBusiness @BarackObama He must be on something
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Letter pretty much sums up the whole fiasco of Meuller's committee. All are rotten to the core.
@BreitbartNews Can't damage what's already screwed up.
@jusakae So very sad.
@ainsleyearhardt @FoxNews @foxandfriends Your polls are fake.
@jessebwatters Somebody needs to do something bout that little black sumabich.
@TeamCavuto Sue their asses.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Truth. FBI is in tatters.  Nobody, except liberal Dems, believes them anymore.
@BreitbartNews Can't stand her. Ashamed she's from KY.
@GiannoCaldwell Yes
@realDonaldTrump I never liked Matt Lauer.
@NolteNC @AmericanThinker Your full of shit. There's a paper trail on Conyers showing he paid his women out of his office budget.  Release names on that secret fund and get rid of all the SOB's. Drain the Swamp.
@ericbolling It's in every family.
@foxandfriends Great idea.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Bust em.
@dmartosko I thought it was funny.
@ashnicoleb23 You don't listen
@realDonaldTrump Call their bluff and shut down the government.  Everybody knows by now, it doesn't really shut down.
@JudicialWatch Good job. Proud of them.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Agree 100%
@WYMT Stupid judge that handed down this sentence.
@BreitbartNews If I had millions of dollars from playing a game, I'd sit around too and whine about how rough life is. Gimme a break.
@TheRealFletch24 Not a good idea
@michellemalkin Michelle Malkin, what about Conyers. That jerk didn't resign. But then, he's black.  Wouldn't want to be accused of racism.  I Used to think you was pretty savvy but no more.
@FoxNews @SenFranken Conyers did a whole lot more than pat butts and he won't resign.
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Everybody is too chicken shit to do anything about Killary.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich It's a no brained.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump The DOJ would appear to be lax about investigating anything.  Maybe someone should check on them. I don't think they're really working.
@JonahNRO These women are ridiculous.
@FoxBusiness No. The government does that quite nicely.
@DanaPerino Get a grip Dana.
@FoxBusiness I knew women would start crawling out of the woodwork.
@UBS Nope. It's the Dems.
@ashnicoleb23 Nope
RT @marklevinshow: 24 Dem scandals CNN ignored https://t.co/f2jwSOuYw5
@greta 18.  Had to.
@BillOReilly PC police run amok
@JacobAWohl No
@BreitbartNews He's an old hand at it which must be why he doesn't remember.
@WYMT They shouldn't.
@TalbertSwan @COGICFamily @realDonaldTrump White supremacy is all in your mind.  Nobody really gives a rats ass what color anybody is.   You play the race card to garner sympathy for being black.
@TalbertSwan @COGICFamily @realDonaldTrump And your boy Obummer was the biggest rat in the Swamp along his best buddy Killary.
@jstidham49 @GinaTrammell4 @realDonaldTrump He's the best we've had or will ever have.  Only thing obummer had going for  him was he was black.  His ideology sucked.
@realDonaldTrump Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours Mr. President.
@seanhannity Happy thanksgiving to you Mr Hannity
@ericbolling Count your blessings today Eric Bolling.  Nothing eases the sorrow. Time just takes the edge off the pain.
@FoxBusiness @donnabrazile Dems should just sit elections out for the next several years. Maybe they're honing their cheating skills.
@PastorJohnHagee Tough one sometimes.
@marcorubio You better quit now then. D.C. is overrun with them.
@ashnicoleb23 Ur in trouble
@SteveBannen Time to ditch Mitch. Drain the Swamp
@BillOReilly Are you crazy!!
I love the #MacysParade #balloons—show me more, @macys! (FYI friends: you can pick your fave below to see more, too) https://t.co/OEmU0JY6FK
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight It's a conspiracy. The man is innocent.
@marthamaccallum No.  Too many women make this stuff up.  And they're all jumping on the sexual harassment bandwagon now. They should have provide proof.
@Mediaite @jessebwatters Reminds me of something else but can't say it on here.  Anyway, we all keep saying LOCK ER UP but nobody's listening.
@TeamCavuto And I didn't appreciate your little rant on my President.  I turned off Shepherd and I can turn you off too. Perhaps Mr Ball would have preferred to see his son spend 10 years in a Chinese prison, the ungrateful SOB.
@daj605 @TeamCavuto Well said.
@TeamCavuto Not on your life.  Tweets just rile up the media.
@realDonaldTrump Told ya they weren't grateful.
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @WattersWorld Great story. God bless him for the rescue.
@BillOReilly Love Hannity.
@ashnicoleb23 Besides pj's????
@BreitbartNews She is just funny crazy.
@MAGAPILL None of them
I care about #OurOcean. Where do you want to see Nat Geo make an impact? https://t.co/rkA1ikMDwc
@RandPaul So sweet
@TeamCavuto Yes. And religion.
@realDonaldTrump No good reasons to trophy hunt. I'm an animal rights activist.  All living things has the right to live.
@foxandfriends Are they all black?
@marthamaccallum Colleges needs to put an end to this crap. You don't send your kid to college for a bunch of rich little jerk wads can kill him or her.
@DiamondandSilk @POTUS Tax payers money.
@realDonaldTrump Liberals really ain't good for much except running their mouth.  Reading comments on this thread makes me glad to be a deplorable Republican.
@d_drennan @LillyPaloma1980 @PressSec @POTUS Jerk wad.
@LillyPaloma1980 @PressSec @POTUS How do you know he isn't?
@PressSec @POTUS True. But they don't appear to be grateful. They are reading from a prepared script.
@SteveBannen True.  Mitch will never win another election in Ky.  That seems to be the only way to get rid of career politicians since they won't even utter "term limits."
@marklevinshow Boy Toy doesn't have a clue.
@realDonaldTrump Wouldn't hold my breath waiting. But wonders never cease.
@SteveBannen Sure they will. Too stupid to realize what Trump did for them.
@seanhannity @Keurig Showed them a thing or two. Now....who's next.  LMAO
@RandPaul Great idea.
@MZHemingway JB is an old man full of shit. He needs to go lay down and finish deteriorating.
@SteveBannen I disagree
@FxTeddyBear @BreitbartNews That is true.
@BreitbartNews I don't agree with anything this b says.  And Meghan is an airhead. She's as laughable as her daddy.
@jane_jrobbins @michellemalkin @TeriGRight I say no.
@UBS Best idea yet. Love President Trump.
@marthamaccallum Yes
@SteveBannen Woah!!! Say what?
@BreitbartNews Hypocrite
@BhattKSV @chiugo22 @SteveBannen Doesn't matter. Men or women should be touching each other without permission.
@chiugo22 @SteveBannen Why is she laughing?  Turn around and smack his little pea brain out.
@SteveBannen Dirty old man.
@ffweekend Then they will continue to be BOYCOTTED.
@TheRealFletch24 Ok
@TheRealFletch24 Wasn't you.
@megynkelly @JaniceDean Nah. I'm one of Trump's deplorables.
@SenateMajLdr Just do it and cut out the bullchips.

@ericbolling Firing squad would be good.
@BillOReilly Need to fry his ass.
@ashnicoleb23 Really...
@brithume I did.
@BillOReilly I cry BS foul.  Those offended people offend me. Remove them.  Maybe to the FEMA camps.
@ericbolling So sorry to hear this. My thoughts and prayers with you and your wife.
@TheRealFletch24 Have to choose wisely son. Even then, they'll still stab you in the back
@ericbolling But will anybody go to jail!!!
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Those Dems do have a way with words.
@TeamCavuto Why hasn't anybody gone to jail?
@greta Love love Trump's tweets
@greta Love Neil Cavuto.
@greta Only watch Fox. But some of their commentators lie.  Hannity and Tucker are best. Shepherd is worst. Eric Bowling was awesome.
@ashnicoleb23 Like what?

@BreitbartNews She's being trashy.  And Breitbart news is nothing more than a rag paper in supermarkets checkout lines
@realDonaldTrump Amen
@RobertGBeckel I like you Bob but you're just full of liberal leftist BS.
@SteveBannen Sink em into ocean. Problem solved.
@BreitbartNews Wake her up. She's dreaming.

@BreitbartNews Why are you even still talking about this witch?
@foxnation Why are you giving her the time of day?
