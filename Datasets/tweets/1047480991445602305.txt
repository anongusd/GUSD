@SenWarren @WellsFargo #WallStreetBanks like @WellsFargo treat people like pawns. The culture needs to change. Individual Leadership changes are irrelevant w/o large scale overhaul. When the motivation is to make money for shareholders, not to provide the best services for members this is the result.

This is a continued failure by the courts and DOJ to adequately address a major problem. There have been thousands of ADA lawsuits filed on similar grounds... I cant think of a more obvious showing of why DOJ MUST create clear regulations and guidance.

Ex2: The DOJ‚Äôs position that the ADA applies to	websites being clear, it is no matter that the	ADA and the DOJ fail to describe exactly	how any given website must be made	accessible to people with visual impairments.
