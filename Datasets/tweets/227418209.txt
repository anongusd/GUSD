@terrence_mccoy release, have official data or pie charts that we can put in our stories. In the meantime, it's good old-fashioned shoe leather.
@terrence_mccoy what you don't know. It became clear after months of deep research and speaking to scores of people that there is an urgent problem happening, unintended consequences, as I and other reporters have called it. Who knows how long it will take for authorities to issue a press
@terrence_mccoy from at least a dozen people reporting mothers, fathers, spouses and friends who died by suicide after being tapered down or cut off. I'll be writing about them. So, this veteran reporter knows a pattern when she sees one. But as you correctly say, you write what you know and
@terrence_mccoy theirs who died by suicide after not being able to find another doctor to treat their pain either at all, or at the dose at which they felt relief. This surprised me, that each of these doctors had several patients die by suicide. And since the series, I've heard
@terrence_mccoy then, we probably only would be scratching the surface. I made clear in my piece that the scope of suicide was underdetermined, and what there is now is what independent individuals and groups are documentiing. Then, interestingly, there are the doctors who report patients of
@terrence_mccoy Yes, the CDC says it has heard reports of suicides that is in the midst of trying to figure out how to measure it. Of course, as with suicide in general, it's often not reported as suicide, and the reasons are not usually known and not documented so it takes vetting and even
@irishspirit7 from hundreds more, including friends and relatives of people in that situation who died by suicide -- these people were unknown to the various pain patient advocacy groups and people keeping lists of vetted suicide victims. These are folks who are not part of any network.
@irishspirit7 I truly did investigate, spending several months to see if this really was a pattern. So many people reached out to me with nearly identical stories of being abandoned or forcibly tapered down, and of having suicide plans as a result. And since the series published I've heard
@Kevinmfilms to know a pattern when I see one.
@Kevinmfilms that up to four to six of those patients had died by suicide, and these are just the doctors I interviewed. Since the series, I've heard from relatives and friends of others who died by suicide after forced tapering or complete loss of pain meds. I've been a reporter long enough
@Kevinmfilms I would have been shocked before I started my research, but after months of deep reporting, it became clear that many people have experienced a dramatic change to their pain management and are deeply affected. Several doctors who felt forced to taper or cut off patients reported

@RogueWolf2001 Is it because of the Xanax? Many patients who take anxiety meds are being penalized because they're now allowed to take them while also taking opioids, although pain is often accompanied by anxiety.
