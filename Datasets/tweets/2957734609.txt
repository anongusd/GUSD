Your actions in public are not that of a video game. You don't turn the game off at night and restart. Your actions can haunt you in the real world. It can affect your future. It can scare the shit out of you to no longer being a dick. Hopefully a lesson gets learned.
I went to Catholic School. Been to Pro-Life Marches. Represented myself and my school in public. Not once did I, or any classmate, ever act that way in public.
Honestly, I could care less if the media made those teenagers look like little d***s.... they go to a Catholic school and were in D.C. for a Pro-Life March.

If Judge denies everything and proves to be a key character witness for Kavanaugh, then the swing vote R's would have a much stronger justification for their yes votes.
If Judge shows up and pleads the 5th the whole time then it's endgame for #Kavanaugh, no? Wouldn't that be the result Feinstein's looking for if she's truly trying to defeat this nomination?
Has anyone asked Grassely straight up if he refuses to subpoena Judge? Why are neither side trying to place blame on that specific issue? If Feinstein wants to hear from Judge, all she need's is Grassley's signature.

3. Let the political fodder sink in, reinforcing the idea behind "Fake News" outlets driving the perception/facts.	4. Step out from behind the op-ed and reveal you're the real Wizard of Oz and you duped the whole "Fake News" media and their readers.
1. Feed the op-ed, which is politically slanted against the WH, to a "Fake News" outlet with whom you've raised previous source-vetting complaints.	2. Watch that op-ed get published, anonymously, to serve as a "resistance" agenda item for whom POTUS decries as "Fake News.
How would Trump GAIN from that op-ed? Here's how:
This makes way too much sense. https://t.co/CACroYgGD4

The same argument applies to the other side of the political aisle as well. Proud conservatives burning Nike gear are putting selfishness first.. you can protest from the Goodwill donation box as well.....
And the "well the other side did that when they were the minority" is not an excuse. Somebody needs to step up and be the bigger person. Why is that so hard?
When you try raising a point through the vehicle of disrespect, you not only lose the ability to convey your point, but your credibility. We can debate, argue, implore with a LOT more respect than what I've seen from our elected officials lately.

The success gained this year with North Korean relations should clearly show their dependence on others at the moment. (5/6)

Ending the war, formally, establishing diplomatic ties, promoting trade with DEMOCRATIC nations... its like taking the younger kid on the team under your wing and keeping him out of trouble while also grooming a mini me to spread your vision. (3/6)

It‚Äôs pretty damn easy to sit on a couch and scoff at the way others manage their income. But that‚Äôs not the ‚ÄúFox and Friends connecting to middle America‚Äù that they try and sell you on. That‚Äôs the elite, badgering the average worker.
Do hosts of Fox and Friends recall the price of a down payment on their first mortgage? How about the price of an engagement ring? Or the expenses that come with celebrating the marriages of friends and families?
Does that make me an invaluable member of the economy, like was just framed on FNC? I don‚Äôt think so. I pay my taxes, I save for my future while spending my income to reinvest into the economy.
I still make less than 40k a year.
