LAUNCH UPDATE: All known rocket anomalies have been resolved. Launch targeted for Tues, w/ Weds as a back-up. Window opens at 5:41pm ET.
RT @elonmusk: The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower &amp; weighs 160 lbs
RT @elonmusk: Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
RT @elonmusk: Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
RT @elonmusk: Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
RT @elonmusk: We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
RT @elonmusk: If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
RT @elonmusk: Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
