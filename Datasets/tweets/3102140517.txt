@sonyacsa sigh, would you have said the same thing back in the days of Jim Crow laws?
@sonyacsa you really believe that our laws are based off common sense?
@sonyacsa "walk on eggshells or else" is not what's written on the Statue of Liberty.
@sonyacsa this sounds gestapo-esque. Where's the civilian oversight and evaluation?
@sonyacsa but rendering a decision without a trial is unAmerican. What if they are innocent?
@sonyacsa "copy and paste" is not the best means of policy creation. But I agree that they can be used as a template to integrate.
@sonyacsa research shows that the proportion of immigrants who are like that is less than domestics. Why are we unfairly victimized?
@sonyacsa and I see you point, but this *could* be misconstrued that other countries' standards are the correct standards. They aren't.
@sonyacsa while I agree with you, overly characterizing immigrants as lazy, murderous, and/or rapists really diminishes the argument.

@BrynnaTM @RobinJohnson54 https://t.co/EdUQrGa0ZE
@RobinJohnson54 it's not. 13 people were shot in Chicago this weekend. Was that a terror incident? Which religion was that?
@AllenWest I see. White guy = man. Non-white guy = ISLAMIC TERRORIST
@jtinfo there are worse ways to misuse your cash.
@jtinfo we were never winning that war. Bush went in there, shot off the hip, took a piss in the corner, then tossed the keys in the river.
@jtinfo Bush missed THE BIGGEST FUCKING TERRORIST ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL
@jtinfo and what you're advocating just gives them more opportunity to break in, get a gun easier, and kill more.
@jtinfo FAIL. It was Bush's fake war that enabled them.
@FoxNews @JaniceDean lemme guess, God doesn't like the southwest.
@jtinfo it's both. Non problem this complex is that binary.
@BecketAdams for someone in the news business, you really don't keep up with things.

@USAGOPMan @EWErickson I like how your inability to answer the question means that you conceded the point.
@BrianGMattson @EWErickson where in the fix does it say that it explicitly exclude Christians?
@GovMikeHuckabee its when you quote scripture that you alienate those not of your faith.
@USAGOPMan @EWErickson also, show me where in the Constitution it explicitly says that Christianity is the one true religion. Go ahead.
@USAGOPMan @EWErickson ok, then if it had it all figured out: who wins the World Series this year? I'd like to put my bet down early.

@RelapsedCath it'll be interesting to see what Arkansas and Indiana come back with.
@RelapsedCath that's a seesaw that doesn't balance easy.
@RelapsedCath religion is the field of morality, which is highly subjective. Science, through research, incorporates  (more) objectivity.
@RelapsedCath why should medicine weight in on the morality? They should be driven more by evidence based research. (Sorry, hit send early)
@RelapsedCath why should it?
@RelapsedCath I know it's a sticking point, but a doctors judgement should be based off science, not religion.
@RelapsedCath a doctor whose religious beliefs were against (non-ER) abortions wouldn't chose that field in the first place.
@RelapsedCath then if there is a demand for the service, why not let doctors supply? Religious doctors don't have to enter the field.
@RelapsedCath in an emergency (life at stake)? Yes. Otherwise, Doctors choose their practice.
@RelapsedCath what if a doctor refuses to transfuse blood due to religious concerns? Ceremonies need strict definition.
@RelapsedCath it can extend further: landlords, doctors, etc. I would be in favor if amended for protected classes.
@RelapsedCath @MZHemingway very true. In this case, do you give credence the the gay/sinner or religious/homophobe (depending on view)?
@GM one of your employees supported Indiana's #RFRA does this mean that you might refuse to sell a car to my gay friend?
@TheFix I think you forgot Apple.
I don't normally take a side, but @GOP has yet to convince that #RFRA is different from '50s racial segregation.
@MZHemingway you're allowed religious liberty, but it stops at the point that it infringes on my liberty, religious or  not.
@LadyLNorth @MZHemingway what government activities? Taxes? Secret observation?
@MZHemingway I don't suspect you use an iPhone , do you?
@TheFix same old story.
@waveringliberal @BrookingsInst let it be known that they still lag behind, and many communities make it tough for them to assimilate.

@TheFix so the military is 7X larger than the sum of all gov workers?
@MZHemingway if someone wins under #RFRA, doesn't that indicate their their religion is above that law? Do we really want that?
