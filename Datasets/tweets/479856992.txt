Some facial recognition software not being able to recognize black faces is an example of bias in AI, Elizabeth Edenburg, an ethicist @georgetown
Ethicists coming in earlier in design process and broadening data sets are two ways some tech companies are trying to combat bias in AI, says Sean Perryman of @InternetAssn #AISummit
Sean Perryman of @InternetAssn: AI can replicate "societal bias" and the data "shows us who we are." When we dream of the future we don't dream of "more efficient discrimination." Asks "How do we harness the power of this technology in a fair way?" #AISummit
To kick off AI and ethics discussion, @Marty_Abrams of @iaf_org cites this quote "Data should serve people. People shouldn't serve data." #AISummit
Watch the final panel of #AISummit: An Ethics Baseline for American AI https://t.co/VyAhjEFiYm
RIGHT NOW: Peter Cleveland of @IntelPolicy giving his remarks at #AISummit WATCH LIVE: https://t.co/VyAhjEFiYm
Shawn Bohen @YearUp says being good at pivoting, adapting and building relationships are some of the skills workers will need to get better at because AI cannot replace those skills. #AISummit
A theme emerging in the Future of Work discussion is the shift in the culture from expecting everyone to aim for a four-year college degree to other ways they can get trained and educated. #AISummit
Who is most at risk of getting displaced by AI? @VictoriaEspinel says "we don't know." Companies and policy makers "need to admit we don't know the time frame or who is going to be impacted." #AISummit
Governors are voicing concerns not just about industries under threat because of automation, but regions that are most at risk, including rural communities or those outside of metro areas. Scott Pattison of @NatlGovsAssoc #AISummit
.@VictoriaEspinel talks about a matching problem in tech, which is people who want training opportunities to qualify for jobs, but do not know where to find it. #AISummit
#AISummit is back with: Panel- The Future of Work in America https://t.co/VyAhjEFiYm

RIGHT NOW: Remarks from Dr. Jerry Smith from @Cognizant https://t.co/VyAhjEFiYm
How can the benefits of innovation reach all Americans more broadly? Steve Case's Rise of the Rest seed fund mentioned as a way to create innovation hubs in the heart of America. #AISummit
Why did the U.S. rank lower in the Bloomberg Innovation Index this year?	Denise  Zheng of @BizRoundtable says education, human capital and immigration are big factors. It's not just R&amp;D. #AISummit
.@RobAtkinsonITIF The U.S. has "fallen into the trap" of  being "accustomed to being the winner" on innovation. But says it takes effort to stay in the lead. #AISummit
Denise Zheng of @BizRoundtable says the U.S. has been "sleepy" on R&amp;D, a key indicator of innovation. The private sector shoulders R&amp;D spending, but says federal spending needs to go back up. #AISummit
WATCH NOW: Panel - Rules of the Road for Innovation https://t.co/VyAhjEFiYm #AISummit
There's only been 8 hearings on AI in Congress. There needs to be an increased body of knowledge on this topic. @HurdOnTheHill
Why is China's potential  lead on AI  over the U.S. such a concern?	"They don't care about privacy and some of the other issues we do." It's about a different worldview and how they plan to use the technology.	@HurdOnTheHill #AISummit

Thanks to @IntelPolicy for sponsoring #POLITICOTech this morning and to all of our panelists for their participation!
Wrap up question for panel: Is AI more of a threat or an opportunity right now?  Mixed responses from panel.	Without standards, it can be a threat, Rashida Richardson, Director, Policy Research, AI Now Institute. #POLITICOTech
Two questions to keep in mind when considering AI policy:	With respect to communities that have been disadvantaged in this country, does the technology make this worse? And are kids being protected? @RepJohnDelaney #POLITICOTech
We have different definitions of bias and fairness. There are varying degrees. So, you can end up having a tool that is said to not be biased, but it is. Rashida Richardson, Director, Policy Research, AI Now Institute, NYU #POLITICOTech
One of the biggest concerns in AI is bias. You can develop a system that is inherently biased. Having a broader ranger of people involved is key before AI becomes more advanced. @HurdOnTheHill #POLITICOTech
China's edge on AI has been smart investments in research and also "not playing by the rules," @RepJohnDelaney #POLITICOTech
There are a "million steps" between now and any doomsday scenario on AI where there is opportunity for human intervention and to make the right decisions. It's the ultimate protection.  @RepJohnDelaney #POLITICOTech
Right now the emphasis with AI is on speed, but equity, fairness and ethics should be priorities, Rashida Richardson, Director, Policy Research, AI Now Institute. Adds that having a national strategy will help with this. #POLITICOTech
The best case scenario is "we are tied" with China in terms of AI, says  @HurdOnTheHill. China has the ability to move quickly because their government can "force" action on AI. #POLITICOTech
"The toothpaste is already out of the tube in terms of how AI is affecting our lives," @RepJohnDelaney, Co-chair, AI Caucus. Delaney says the EU, China have a national strategy on AI. The U.S. should have one. #POLITICOTech

Will the 2011 law that prevents U.S. partnering with China in space be repealed? @JimBridenstine says he doesn't see that happening for now and that a decision would go beyond space exploration and take into account other issues. It's not just a NASA discussion. #POLITICOSpace
.@JimBridenstine discussing climate change views: NASA is not a regulatory agency and it does science. Says he wants to keep the science from being politicized and "does not reject the science." #POLITICOSpace
.@JimBridenstine also cites the importance of  space  technology in disaster relief, national security defense and weather predictions to make a case for a Space Force. #POLITICOSpace
.@JimBridenstine  says a "Space Force" should not be seen as provocative, but as a way for the U.S. to be ready to defend itself. #POLITICOSpace
On Trump's space force plans, "I'm for it!" says @JimBridenstine #POLITICOSpace
.@JimBridenstine on James Webb Space Telescope launch delay and going over budget, "Nobody in NASA is happy about this," but "it will be absolutely worth it" when it happens. #POLITICOSpace

‚ÄúPart of my hope would be that we can listen a little harder to each other, and find ways to work together to create a better future.‚Äù @GovofCO at #POLITICOMoney
What is @GovofCo‚Äòs vision for America going forward? Listening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never going to persuade anyone by telling someone why they‚Äôre wrong and you‚Äôre right. As soon as you start really listening and asking questions, that‚Äôs when real transformations happen.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney
‚ÄúWe need to make sure we don‚Äôt leave people behind in opportunities for training‚Ä¶we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs at all different levels‚Ä¶this leads to more inclusive prosperity‚Äù @GovofCO on wage disparities and the urban/rural divide #POLITICOMoney
‚ÄúAbout a third of clean tech jobs need college degrees and two thirds don‚Äôt. Roughly, that‚Äôs the breakdown we have of how many of our kids are going to get a college degree.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney with @GovofCO
.@GovofCO: ‚ÄúWe have over 60,000 clean tech employees in Colorado‚Ä¶and we‚Äôre a pretty big coal state but we only have 1,000 jobs in coal. We need to provide the broadband and the incentives so that clean tech jobs end up in rural areas‚Ä¶it can make a huge impact.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney
Biggest risk of automation and the jobs we‚Äôre going to lose? @GovofCO: ‚ÄúAny job that is repetitive, you can expect that at some time in the next decade, a robot will be doing it.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at functional zero unemployment. If you took out 11 million workers from the United States, it would be a train wreck for agriculture, manufacturing‚Ä¶almost half of our industries would be in danger.‚Äù @GovofCO on immigration policy at #POLITICOMoney
On providing broadband for everyone, @GovofCO says, ‚ÄúWe need to make sure we don‚Äôt have this [digital] divide between rural and urban America.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney
On apprenticeships and experiential education: ‚ÄúBusinesses love it, kids love it, and it‚Äôs transferring some of the cost of education to businesses and they embrace that and get the employees they want.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney with @GovofCO
On education and the workforce: ‚ÄúWe need a system of training that can adapt in real time to the needs of what businesses are‚Ä¶One way to rapidly get people into the jobs that are really needed is to do experiential learning.‚Äù @GovofCO at #POLITICOMoney
‚ÄúI twice got elected mayor and twice got elected governor in a purple state and I‚Äôve never run a negative ad.‚Äù @GovofCO #POLITICOMoney
How do we address the red/blue divide in America? ‚ÄúPart of it is recognizing that the political system and the heat that television ads and video can have creates damage through attack ads that‚Äôs hard to get past once the election is over.‚Äù @GovofCO at #POLITICOMoney
‚ÄúDespite the party difference, Democrats and Republicans can come together on complex issues and find solutions.‚Äù #POLITICOMoney with @GovofCO on bipartisan politics and possible presidential tickets. Tune-in: https://t.co/jaXoDfpWDj

‚ÄúChina is our third largest export market and when you start putting tariffs on goods coming and going, that‚Äôs hitting our farmers and our ranchers who are already suffering from low commodity products.‚Äù @GovofCO on trade + agriculture at #POLITICOMoney
We‚Äôre kicking off #POLITICOMoney by talking tariffs with @GovofCO:‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a problem saying we needed to revisit NAFTA and our trading agreements‚Ä¶but trade creates wealth‚Ä¶when you start threatening tariffs, you increase costs.‚Äù
