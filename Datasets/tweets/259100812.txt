@pcnerd37 @Rockies @MLB So by that logic, a football secondary is just common sense. Because you'll just adjust based on the quarterback and his receivers.
@pcnerd37 @Rockies @MLB Couldn't be farther from the truth. Fans don't notice the shifting of the outfielders to different depths depending on the hitter at the plate, the way you pitch a guy, when to run, when to take a pitch. It's a chess game played on a field! Thing a beauty.
@pcnerd37 @Rockies @MLB The excitement is in the strategy. Trying to play the game of chess in your own head while the Manager is playing it in his. Gratification in baseball comes to those willing to put in the effort. @MLB @Rockies
