@mattdpearce I read her point more as an analysis than an accusation. She acknowledged that people, including socialists, need tech platforms to organize but warned such dependence itself limits the conversation. I wonder if activists would disagree. Seems classically Marxist/gramacian.
@mattdpearce The critical emphasis, I think, is on the system itself. At least that‚Äôs what I found provocative. She does take a brief swipe at socialists for not talking about the data monopoly enough, which didn‚Äôt stick with me because it seemed liked an aside. i‚Äôll give that more thought.
@mattdpearce Listened to it. You‚Äôre right, she says ‚Äústructurally...I don‚Äôt actually think they call out the data monopoly.‚Äù Her main point, which I think is clear, is that tech ‚Äúcorporations are our railroads,‚Äù that the culture has become ‚Äúindentured‚Äù to their distribution systems.
@mattdpearce But I think that's precisely her point ‚Äî she's commenting on *why* it is so difficult to organize against the structures that yield sweeping social &amp; economic inequality. It's not criticism of the activists themselves, but of the playing field.

Noxious sewage filled with feces, industrial chemicals and other raw waste regularly comes from Mexico into Calexico, a border town in southeast California. Residents are worried the water, soil contamination, and chemicals in the air are making them sick. https://t.co/FT3tM5MhmE
Lastly, I'd like to point you to other work on this! The Desert Sun, the regional paper, has done really heroic work on pollution along the border. If you found my story interesting, you should read their exhaustive dives: https://t.co/J9MPfDyapq
State officials told me they're committed to fixing this. There are people at all levels of govt who seem genuine in their concern. The residents I spoke to sighed when they heard this; they‚Äôve learned not to get their hopes up because this has been a problem *for half a century*
This story was especially complicated because it takes place on the border. You would not believe how maddening it is to get shuffled to a dozen or more agencies, especially when you're asking a simple question: "What is in this water?"
I‚Äôve learned over time that stories about pollution are always, always stories about bureaucracies and justice. Suffice it to say, river reporting can be DENSE. Hours spent digging through legislation, state natural resource codes, water data, etc.
So I started digging into the story as I worked on other pieces as well. A bunch of locals were saying to me, if there‚Äôs all this money for a wall, how about some to clean up this ‚Äúpit of infection‚Äù? That‚Äôs the essence of this story.
As I was reporting, residents kept asking: Has anyone told you about the river? Do you know about the asthma here? Have you noticed the air quality? This rural American town is under siege because, on the other side of the border, there is a large under regulated Mexican city.
I went to Calexico last month to do research on the redeveloped section of border fencing in town. As I‚Äôve often found in small towns, residents weren‚Äôt shy suggesting other things I should write about. I stayed in the area for weeks to get to know the place better.

Anecdotally, on Election Day voters kept mentioning ec security and mobility as top priorities. As more data becomes available, it will be interesting to see what motivated Latino voters most in 2018. My instinct is that Trump helped Dems, but Trump alone didn‚Äôt bring them out.
One more reminder about Central Valley politics: Hispanics in the region tend to be more conservative than one would expect, especially on social issues. Definitely should not be taken for granted as tried and true Dem voters.
Following the defeat of Denham and Valadao in 2018, the Nunes race is going to be very, very interesting in 2020. Especially during a presidential cycle. Definitely one to watch.
The Central Valley districts in particular are very interesting ‚Äî where Hispanic voter apathy and lack of targeted engagement has been a problem in the past. The 2018 cycle showed that campaigns can convince Latinos to vote but it takes a serious investment in canvassing and ads.
I spent time in the district and one notable thing about Harder‚Äôs pitch was that it targeted Latinos with bread and butter messaging. Health care, wages, retirement, economic mobility. Trump came up of course, but the messaging went far beyond character attacks.
Smart piece about the Latino  vote in CA. The organizing Dems did here in 2018 could become model for engaging Latinos in other states where that isn‚Äôt happening. The Harder campaign, featured, made a big push for Hispanic votes and it clearly paid off.  https://t.co/52Uh3UlMJ9

@ktumulty For a moment I thought we were heading into Jonathan Swift territory
In the words of one Calexico community leader: "We don't need money for a wall. And we already have a fence. What we need is money for the door."
Along border towns, its very common to hear local officials practically beg for more money for security upgrades at ports of entry ‚Äî because they want to prevent drugs from coming in, and because it can speed up crossing times, which deeply affect local economies.
Border towns also regularly struggle with sophisticated tunnels that go UNDER existing fencing.
Vehicles that are moving this stuff would much rather do it on highways, which I easier than off-roading through the desert. Drugs can then be hidden among legal goods at these ports of entry.
Another point, also sourced to DEA: the strongest fentanyl comes into the United States from China by mail. Lower-dose fentanyl that comes from Mexico ‚Äî again, largely through ports of entry ‚Äî is also made with chemicals from China.
That includes heroin and fentanyl specifically.
A quick fact check on the drug stuff: According to the DEA itself,	Mexican cartels most commonly smuggle drugs into US via privately owned vehicles and tractor trailers. The drugs are carried through the southwest border‚Äôs various points of entry, not through wall-less desert.

Newsom was clear he sees government as a powerful engine for combatting rising income inequality. "Too many of our children know the ache of chronic hunger," he said. "These aren‚Äôt merely policy problems. They are moral imperatives." But the cost of such programs remains unclear.
Though Gov. Newsom never mentioned Trump by name, the president factored in big time. He presented California as "an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the White House. Our government will be progressive, principled, and always on the side of the people."
In his speech today, Newsom leaned hard into the idea that California is the future. "The country is watching us. The world is waiting on us. The future depends on us. ‚Ä¶ We will prove that people of good faith, and firm will can still come together to achieve big things.

Earthquake drills are a fact of life in Anchorage, as common in schools as fire drills. The 1964 earthquake, a 9.2 beast, looms large in Alaska history. It basically swept away downtown anchorage and caused landslides that destroyed dozens of homes
People have calmed down a bit since the initial big shake, which a friend described as surreal, "straight from a movie." But everyone is on edge waiting for aftershocks, monitoring tsunami warnings. Those in the valley aren't sure how they're going to get home b/c of the highway.
I grew up in Anchorage. Several of my best friends who live there said they've never experienced an earthquake like it. This is a place that is accustomed to the occasional shake. People are panicked: there are cracks in buildings, toppled desks, cracked roadways, no power.

In any case, like I said, the authors are tremendous journalists, but I wanted to detail a few things I was troubled by in the piece. Open to discussion and thoughts. (Forgive typos &amp; grammar mistakes; twitter threads are always a mess.)
Of course it costs more money to be smuggled into the United States than it costs to be dropped off in Nogales or Tijuana. Those are fundamentally different, not a family discount. Conflating illegal crossings with asylum requests is a persistent problem in immigration coverage.
And lastly, the article doesn‚Äôt make much a distinction between families that are making the journey to request asylum at the border, and people who are seeking to cross illegally into the country. These are different things, with different challenges.
Why does this matter? Because it flattens an entire refugee crisis to economics, with no mention of violence, it disregards the love Central American parents feel for their kids, and doesn't hammer home the scale of this problem. I guarantee this becomes a political talking point
Again, trafficking *is a problem* and any single case is a tragedy. But the scale is buried toward the end: 90 cases out of hundreds of thousands have resulted in fraud prosecution. The article doesn't go far enough to clarify that not every family unit is a trafficking scheme.
I was shocked to read this sentence abt refugee families: ‚Äúyoung children and teenagers are seen as boarding passes to the flight for economic survival." This is sweeping statement that reduces an entire region's view of familial love &amp; responsibility.
Isn't the far more common scenario that women, often single, bring their children with them on the torturous journey because there's no one else to care for them, b/c she or her child have been threatened, and/or because they don't feel safe? I'd have liked to see that mentioned.
While the piece centers an absolutely real and horrifying problem, human trafficking, it never seems to decide whether this is ‚Äúa small number of cases‚Äù or if *everyone* brings a child "because Central Americans know they will have a better chance of avoiding deportation.‚Äù
I'm really troubled by this article and some of the implications it makes, perhaps unintentionally. I have great respect for the authors but there are a few things that need to be unpacked here. https://t.co/uxsVhvrkWM

Chris Weber said that many of the people he believed were at Borderline Wednesday night had attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas last year, which we know as the Las Vegas shooting.
As Mr. Miller and his friend Chris Weber walked toward Borderline, trying to find some fo the friends they knew were they, they received a call that a friend who works the door had been shot. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the sweetest, nicest girl,‚Äù he said, trailing off.
Michael Miller, 25 ,who lives near Borderline and is a regular, began to call him frantically asking if he was inside. He was at another concert earlier in the night but many of his friends were there.
Borderline was described by everyone I spoke to as a casual, safe place with a lot of regulars. The place is frequented by police officers and firefighters in the area, and Wednesdays are particularly crowded because it's college night.
Taylor Whittler, who was also there, was dragged out of the bar by a stranger. She said she saw the man pulling the trigger repeatedly. Her parents pulled up as she was being patched up by an EMT. Her mother looked panicked as she thought for a moment Taylor had been shot.
Ms. Wong was trapped in the club through the whole shooting until police officers showed up. She said she was unsure when they were able to subdue the gunman and described the scene as a blur.
She made a break for the door as soon as she could; as she ran, she saw several bodies. Ms. Worrell and her group of friends were separated during the chaos but several of them found each other after. They've been unable to reach two others.
Chyann Worrell, a sophomore at Cal State Channel Islands, said she saw the gunman draw his gun and point it at someone near the front entrance; she threw herself to the ground and started hearing repeated gunfire. She was there celebrating her friend Nellie Wong's 21st birthday.
I'm here in Thousand Oaks, Calif., where a gunman unleashed a barrage of bullets at the Borderline Bar &amp; Grill. There's still a lot we don't know. But I spoke to several young man and women who were inside when it happened. https://t.co/DO32gzwj5i

A union spox told me this year‚Äôs midterm operation is modeled after their presidential year efforts; they‚Äôre trying to avoid a midterm drop off like the state saw in 2014. According to Ralston‚Äôs analysis &amp; reporting, they appear to be meeting the targets they‚Äôve set.
The union offers a political leave program that turns cooks and cleaners into organizers. 10 hrs a day, 6 days a week, for months. It‚Äôs a fascinating, robust organizing model. The dem machine in the state complements those efforts, but  Culinary is a powerhouse unto itself.
As the brilliant Jon Ralston mentions, the Culinary Union ‚Äî which is 54 percent Latino ‚Äî has an expansive GOTV operation in the state. I shadowed bilingual canvassers a few weeks back and it‚Äôs time intensive work, but the gold standard in organizing. https://t.co/FtsxM5XEBv

Great piece on Prop 10 here in California by @ConorDougherty https://t.co/dA6tsV3GJL
I should add: It was a real page turner. I couldn't put it down, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I started.

I finished An American Marriage by @tayari last night &amp; I highly recommend it. The writing is elegant &amp; familiar at the same time. The story is full of tension and uncertainty; It was frustrating and difficult, by design, and raises a lot of unanswerable questions. Read it!

@kylebuchanan It is definitely not camp. Maybe there's some confusion because there are queer characters and drag queens prominently featured? But they're not used with irony, even if their own senses of humor are campy.

@LJSelsky @CHueyBurns Yes! That was brilliant but actually quite controversial; there was some grumbling about whether those wristbands should be allowed in voting booths.
Is she a Republican? Yeah,  a legacy Republican at that. And I *do not know how she's going to vote on Kavanaugh*. But a no vote from her would not be terribly surprising or fatal. Her political calculations are unique, &amp; her sense of ideological &amp; moral obligation are as well.
Connecting these threads: https://t.co/sH1M7rpVr0
During the 2010 election, at the height of tea party fervor, Lisa Murkowski lost the GOP primary to Joe Miller. She ran a write-in campaign as an independent and won. It was historic. The first time anyone had pulled that off in 60 or 70 years.
She earned good will the way AK politicians do: bringing home federal $$$, waxing romantic about the state in every interview, and retail politicking in the AK Bush. Going against the nat'l parties is often celebrated up there; there's a feeling that the lower 48 doesn't get it.
Some history: Murkwoski's first life in the Senate was controversial. She was appointed in 2002 by her father, Frank Murkowski, who left his longtime U.S. senator seat to become governor. She narrowly won a full term against Tony Knowles, who her father had replaced as governor.
Strategists and commentators tweeting that her career is over don't know anything about politics in Alaska.
Murkowski isn't up for reelection until 2022, and, because Alaska politics can be confusing and wild, her coalition comprises moderate Republicans, liberal rural voters, and Democrats. She simply doesn't need the Republican establishment the way others do.

The piece also conflates ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù with tokenism, and then uses that to passively invalidate people who do speak up about their experiences. That is...offensive, but a topic/pathology for another day.
I believe this piece was written in good faith. But, even if unintentionally, it treats poverty as an ornament to be unveiled during college admissions. There are more sophisticated arguments to be made about the commodification of trauma, and who gets to share which stories.
If your biggest problem is that you grew up in a financially stable, nurturing environment, congrats!
This whole piece does an enormous disservice to people who come from difficult circumstances. Poverty isn‚Äôt a *good topic for essays*, it‚Äôs a structural obstacle that devours lives. https://t.co/a1NEBXIFVq
No...some of us entered adolescence &amp; adulthood pretending we *didn‚Äôt* grow up in poverty, for fear it would permanently keep us from a seat at the table. Disadvantage isn‚Äôt something many have the luxury to fetishize; it‚Äôs something to conceal. https://t.co/a1NEBXIFVq

And so I set out to write about the twin crises, and to emphasis the way community leaders were mobilizing litigation, medicine, and cultural restoration efforts to address this interwoven despair. https://t.co/3PC5HlSyb2
Once I was on the ground in Yurok country I realized something else: the slow ecological decline of the Klamath River had hurt the regional tribes for decades; and it had reached a breaking point. The tribes kept mentioning how the crises were connected. https://t.co/3PC5HlSyb2
I followed up and realized that, not only were the reservations struggling with opioids, but Native Americans broadly are the most affected by the drug overdose epidemic nationally. And yet not much gets written about those communities. https://t.co/3PC5HlSyb2

Some crucial context: Between 1999 and 2015, Native Americans saw a 519 percent increase in overdose deaths nationally. They are the hardest-hit demographic in an overdose death epidemic that has affected every corner of the country. https://t.co/uLCS5XUo6f

Meanwhile, leaders in the area, and in particular Yurok General Counsel Amy Cordalis, have been very active in using litigation and negotiation to clean up the ecological mess on the river. https://t.co/uLCS5XUo6f

@jonathanvswan 2) This again draws attention to the administration's initial denial, which misrepresented the meeting to the public. Shifting justifications and explanations need to be considered against that initial context. The lack of contrition is part of what makes this so surprising.
@jonathanvswan That's a good point to tease out. Two things: 	1) When Trump made the 2017 comment, he insisted it was not a Russian govt lawyer. Seems impossible that he doesn't know now that it was in fact a govt lawyer; that elevates the public significance of these fresh remarks.

Lastly: the primary may feel a bit sleepy in this part of CA, but tensions will certainly escalate closer to November. Outside groups (&amp; inside groups) are already pumping a fortune into candidates' war chests. And anything can happen. Stay tuned! https://t.co/5l0IueZYm9
The issue of who votes is big too. Gil Hernandez, a Democrat, told me that, in his view, too few low-income and Hispanic people in the area vote. (Many either can't because they don't have citizenship, or they're too young.)
Of course, rural &amp; agrarian areas are not a monolith. Plenty of disagreement. David Marquette, a Democrat, really dislikes Nunes and said he thinks he's too focused on national issues and not his district. https://t.co/wVfnZkTWgX
And farming backgrounds really mattered to them. Take Kelly Mahoney, who told me people were excited to elect David Valadeo, a dairy farmer, because he "gets it." She said she's very happy with the job he's done, especially on water issues. (This was a common refrain.) https://t.co/eTR2KAnLum
But a lot of the voters I spoke to seemed genuinely content with their representation. Take Mr. John Dixon, below, who told me he though the Russia-related criticisms of Nunes were just something television people were talking about. https://t.co/CxV0P0UdOM
During a recent trip to Devin Nunes and David Valadeo's districts, in the San Joaquin Valley, voters kept telling me over and over again that they didn't know there was a primary coming up. Thats, in part, because of lack of primary election competition.
There's a lot of talk about NorCal versus SoCal, but I'd say the biggest cultural differences in CA are between the coast and the valley. For my latest piece, I wrote about the part of California where voters remain unmoved by 'the resistance.' https://t.co/5l0IueZYm9

Syringe exchanges, once an urban phenomenon, have become an important tool in fighting the opioid crisis. Why are small towns and rural areas having second thoughts? Great piece by the brilliant @jshkatz https://t.co/TccZDjWuH9
@itscaitlinhd let's be honest, this was adapted from a group text review. (miss you too!)
Anyway, music like this can make a difference in people's lives, in people's attitudes, and in people's conceptions of themselves. That's really cool. Give the album a spin.
And damn if "I Like That" doesn't speak to me on a million levels. Plus the TLC reference makes me literally do a chef's kiss every time; early 90s R&amp;B is the music I grew up on.
But a lot of it is made "for me." The way JM embraces various audience at once, across race &amp; gender &amp; sexuality, feels revelatory. And its empowering: "I am not America's nightmare, I am the American dream."
And so, I'm the first to admit some of this music is not made just "for me," or "for me" at all.  (I hate that phrase, but it's useful in describing imagined communities and intended audiences).
JM's project deals with womanhood and blackness, the latter of which the aforementioned  Fame of course did not. There are a lot of layers that I can't even begin to unpack on twitter lol.
Not everything in the album works. Some of it feels too on the nose. The album's last song is a wreck. (In contrast to the experimental intro, which is brilliant.) The "dirty computer" theme is hit hard at first and then evaporates quickly. But the experiment is thrilling.
Reminded me of the first time I listened to The Fame by Gaga, hearing music that felt like it was explicitly for me, that sought to meet me where I was.
And it doesn't feel cheap here; proximity to queerness right now carries a real cultural currency, which is often reductive and essentializing. But that's not what this is. JM's music is celebrating sex and freedom, and there's so much power in that.
In particular, I was very moved by the queerness of the album &amp; videos. Her work always embodied queer themes, but the directness here is a revelation. I always wondered if Q.U.E.E.N. wasn't originally supposed to be Q.U.E.E.R. (listen to the lyrics, revel in the camp)
Listened to Janelle Monae's album. In short, it's great. Some thoughts:

The crowd has thinned but there are still many, many protesters in the city hall foyer. They are chanting, ‚ÄúNo justice, no peace! No racist police!‚Äù https://t.co/FOPL0DI6Bn

After an emotional outpouring of grief and anger, some community leaders took the room back and brought everyone together in prayer. https://t.co/DL5AAOKOUC

Some people in the room were groaning, others were cheering Mr. Clark on. The mayor just adjourned the meeting.
After giving Mr. Stevante Clark the floor, the mayor is trying to take back back the meeting. "Tell him to shut the fuck up," Mr. Clark shouted.

@MeanDanceFightr Very insightful perspective. I went to a school with a specialized program for hard of hearing people and learned so much about the deaf community that way. (And once upon a time even some sign language!) I‚Äôll keep your insights in mind once I finally watch the film!
Important addendum: the protagonist is mute, not deaf! (I haven‚Äôt see the movie. I was personally rooting for others I had seen. Will watch!)
Look, they gave Best Picture to a film directed by a Mexican guy about a deaf woman who falls in love with a fish. That's pretty wild, and I'm gonna take that as a win lol.

Tldr: eh.
The central theme, pain as baptism, is an interesting one. But the film provides no resolution, and does no work to convince the viewer that redemption is achievable through suffering in any real way.
Then suddenly half way through, in case the dialogue wasn‚Äôt heavy handed enough, the film turned into an epistolary novel?
And what did that dialogue reveal? Some thin ‚ÄúReal America‚Äù stereotypes that felt both flat and difficult to believe. I‚Äôd have assumed more depth to the characters if their lines were cut in half.
I finally saw Three Billboards (on a long flight). Really dynamic plot. But the expository dialogue was so overdone as to be painful. Like the actors were reading the stage cue aloud.
