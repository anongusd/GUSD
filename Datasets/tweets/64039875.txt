‚ÄúMost of those I spoke with, Republican and Democrat alike, were resigned to Trump being outplayed by Putin.‚Äù https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúBest case: ‚ÄúNothing of significance is said or done.‚Äù https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúThe worst result? Adelman wrote to me: ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs flattery prompts Trump‚Äôs swooning. Policy is shoved aside, lost among all gushes of the ‚Äògreat, great‚Äô personal relationship Trump‚Äîunlike any previous President since Chester Arthur‚Äîmiraculously established. https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúAsked what word best summed up Trump‚Äôs approach to Putin, Beyrle responded, ‚ÄúUntethered‚Äù and ‚Äúdaydream-ish.‚Äù Tom Graham, [a former] top N.S.C. official for Russia, added ‚Äúcontradictory and incoherent,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúideologically driven and non-strategic.‚Äù https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúThere is no historical precedent for such a potentially high-stakes U.S.-Russia meeting to take place with so little advance preparation, and with such a dark cloud of suspicion and uncertainty hanging over it. We really are in uncharted waters here.‚Äù  https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚Äú...even a talked-about preparatory session between Pompeo and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is not going to happen. According to current and former officials, Bolton‚Äôs N.S.C. has not had a single principals-level meeting.‚Äù https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúFiona Hill, the top National Security Council adviser for Russia, isn‚Äôt going to be in the meeting.‚Äù https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚Äúof now it appears that it will be a four-hour affair (rather than the seven hours requested by the Kremlin), with a lengthy one-on-one between Trump and Putin first, followed by an expanded meeting to include Bolton, Pompeo, and Huntsman.‚Äù https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúThe sum total of the preparation was a single trip by John Bolton to Moscow. He came out with none of the ‚Äúdeliverables‚Äù typically determined in advance of such high-level summits. (‚ÄúThe meeting is the deliverable,‚Äù the Russians apparently told Bolton.) https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚Äú[As of June] advisers still hoped to delay the summit, or, at least, to use the opportunity to produce a real, substantive policy agenda with proposals that actually reflected American foreign policy. It is now clear that they failed on both counts. https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no stopping him,‚Äù a senior Administration official told me in June. ‚ÄúHe wants to have a meeting with Putin, so he‚Äôs going to have a meeting with Putin.‚Äù  https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúTrump then called a hastily assembled news conference to claim that the allies had bowed to his demands and made new spending commitments (the French President, Emmanuel Macron, quickly rebutted him).‚Äù  https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
‚ÄúAsked whether he would consider scrapping exercises in the Baltic states neighboring Russia, ‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôll talk about that,‚Äù he replied, to the great alarm of Europeans who had been publicly reassured by American officials that he would do no such thing. https://t.co/1HetmXTWyo
