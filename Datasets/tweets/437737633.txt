What I am saying is that the NCAA is a racket and, if they aren‚Äôt going to pay the players, they should make them better suited for success by trimming down the arbitrary rules that dissuade them from fully exploring their career choices
The difference for the NCAA is that basketball players ~declare~ for the draft while baseball and hockey players are automatically in the draft pool. 		But the latter are allowed to tryout with pro teams or be selected in the draft while maintaining eligibility.
The NCAA eligibility models for baseball or hockey give players a much better chance of succeeding while still being able to fall back into college if it's not a good fit. They can take real steps to test the waters of a pro career without forfeiting eligibility.
Let the players get a better idea of how viable a pro career is for them before they go to school or enter the draft and throw away their eligibility. It's a no-brainer for the NCAA if they actually care about what's best for the athletes over their bottom line.
This is good, but the NCAA could make it even better if they let players enter the draft out of high school without forfeiting their eligibility https://t.co/rE9Jr7533k

@tstough simmer down buddy, it was a thing we like to call a ‚Äújoke‚Äù
@StanLoveTheShow are all of your takes this bad or are you just having a big night tonight
@Donopolis1 Yes, I played hockey. The fight was picked months ago when the Pens GM ran his mouth. Wilson might have grappled early, but he gave Oleksiak the chance to throw the first punch. It was a completely fair scrap after that and Oleksiak got whooped. That's all there is to it
@Donopolis1 lmfao "defensive punch," make sure you stretch before that reach. Wilson gave him the chance to throw the first punch and he did. Then Tom knocked him out. Maybe next time your GM shouldn't be picking fights on behalf of his players. He's writing checks they can't cash.
@Donopolis1 What's it like living in the alternate reality where your player can throw the first punch and simultaneously also be jumped by the guy he hit first?
The Penguins GM dared Tom Wilson to do it, they both squared up, Oleksiak threw the first punch ‚Äî and Penguins fans still act like they're the victim! I would pretend to be shocked but it's not even surprising at this point https://t.co/DczpUjkfKt

Judaism teaches that the highest level of good deed is one that cannot be returned.
