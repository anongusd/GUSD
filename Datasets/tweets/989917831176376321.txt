We‚Äôd also support mothers and children-before during and after pregnancy-with free healthcare and childcare services. And better nutrition in schools so kids can continue to thrive rather than just survive.
So why have children died in ICE detention centers? If that was the case we‚Äôd be making it easier for refugees and families to come here and begin new lives rather than deporting them to be killed by the very people and circumstances they were trying to escape in the first place https://t.co/TsVGWppxsk

@theedflegacy @DemWrite Posted this yesterday https://t.co/swceKYW6i7 our election system is really atrocious and it is embarrassing
@theedflegacy @DemWrite I think the media does that A LOT but some politicians don‚Äôt list party affiliation on their public profiles or websites. You have to do a little digging before you find it. Some wear it on their sleeve or literally wear party colors.
@theedflegacy @DemWrite I‚Äôd also argue that our government hasn‚Äôt always seen this level of partisan rancor. Much of this is a direct result of @newtgingrich https://t.co/8VwLfMiSJo
@theedflegacy @DemWrite We don‚Äôt generally address our elected officials by their party affiliation. Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding? There are party specific positions (like the one I hold) but most are addressed with a title they reflects the highest position they hold.
@theedflegacy @DemWrite I should have left ‚Äúbipartisan‚Äù out (lack of coffee this am) The bodies should be completely independent. I‚Äôve even seen some interesting computer programs that could make quick work if the entire process...but you still need oversite because they can be hacked

@RepBarbaraLee @RepPressley @RepKatieHill @RepUnderwood @RepDavids @RepAngieCraig @RepMGS @RepDebHaaland @RepHaleyStevens @RepEscobar @RepKatiePorter In the past Congress has tried to undo all of our gun laws, restrict our ability to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, curtail our reproductive rights, and grant marriage equality (nearly 10% of people here are LGBTQ). https://t.co/GkB6Rtxrus
@RepBarbaraLee @RepPressley @RepKatieHill @RepUnderwood @RepDavids @RepAngieCraig @RepMGS @RepDebHaaland @RepHaleyStevens @RepEscobar @RepKatiePorter Welcome to DC! I hope you will all sign #HR51 #statehood for DC will help restore some semblance of balance in Congress and restore our rights. We've suffered under the yoke of a tyrannical Congressional committee we have no control over for long enough.
@theedflegacy @DemWrite Completely agree that districts should be redrawn by bipartisan bodies that are outside of the legislature. I wish the Dems would agree to this and make it a priority as it is exactly the reason we have less representation in our government.
