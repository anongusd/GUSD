@incapete The size of the lens (mainly its length) is the parameter that makes you go for the C-Z100 instead of the C-AF (eg: grey Canons)
@incapete The difference in the lens connection of the C-AF and the C-Z100 is that the front port has a 10mm larger dia. in the C-Z100

@scotbaston if the 70-200mm doesn't change the length and if the camera incl. lens isn't longer than 250mm the U-BZ100 would fit also.
@scotbaston does the 70-200 lens changes the length when zooming. I don't think so but I'm not sure anymore.
@scotbaston our distributor in The Netherlands is company Hofland www.arivvo.nl. You can also give me a call +49817141850 or skype me.
@scotbaston the Canon 70-200mm f2.8 IS is to long for our housings but you can use the C-Z100 raincover to protect your camera.
@scotbaston the U-B series was specially made for professional cameras like the Canon 1Ds MK II. For 24-105mm you'll need the U-B100 housing
