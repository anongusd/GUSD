Remember those embedded taxes? #FAIRtax takes them away, and the buyers at Walmart will know that and force suppliers to lower prices. How much? It will vary by product/service but avg. is 12-14%. Purchasing power will go up. 	https://t.co/EEfauCFj9i https://t.co/ctlCp1vmna

@MikeRose2d @natmbates1 @MariaBartiromo @realDonaldTrump If you title the land and take a deed on the home/land together even as a builder the FAIRtax is owed when it is first titled to a retail purchaser. So the real estate agent would be liable for the FAIRtax.

In 2019 we will be checking our list to see who is naughty and nice @Congress. https://t.co/onnmwb5NG1
@BankableInsight @atlassheepdog As noted the money is essentially "recycled".   https://t.co/cprUkM4a8p     The "cost" to the government in lower tax revenue is 1/2 or less the current deductions. It can be set up and run for 500 million year one and lower after as 92% paid electronically.
@BankableInsight @atlassheepdog So you would never allow a mortgage interest deduction (handout), charitable deduction (handout), educational tax credit (handout), or any standard deduction (handout) under any income tax system? If a retail sales tax does not have a tax credit option it hammers the poor. https://t.co/iBiD1m7Gc9
@BankableInsight @atlassheepdog Sorry, but we can't see where you made a point. The tax credit created by the Family Consumption Allowance is nothing more than people keeping their money to buy essentials up to poverty level essentially tax free and it is paid in advance as a monthly credit. https://t.co/vOvZhut1wX

@CosmUnity #FAIRtax is a replacement for US federal taxes. It applies to domestic consumption.  It is not intended to apply outside the US.
Thank you @GovMikeHuckabee for those words of wisdom. @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence run on #FAIRtax in 2020. https://t.co/3ow1rGlXnW

If a 2nd addition to #TaxCutsJobsAct passes that will be &gt;500 pages of new code. No wonder our tax laws, regs, interpretations are over 76,000 pgs. @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/jF9LA7jFD3

Income goes up &amp; down much more frequently and widely than consumption. https://t.co/TFH05UqmJN
Income fluctuates widely over a lifetime. Consumption stays stable. #FAIRtax is America's https://t.co/EEfauCnIhK https://t.co/sTUg5tal9P
@Bitte__B @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence #FAIRtax is a FULL replacement for current tax revenue. 300+ million consumers including foreign visitors, visa holders,illegals ALL PAYING TAXES.
Five of the top reasons. Tell @realDonaldTrump &amp; @Mike_Pence to run on #FAIRtax in 2020. https://t.co/9Hs2GpA78r
Stop punishing work, ingenuity, &amp; productivity. End income taxes &amp; IRS with #FAIRtax. Tax consumption. @realDonaldTrump run on #FAIRtax in 2020. @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/EE8nB1M9oO
@tracygee_ Pricing competition applies all through the chain of commerce.
Which tax base is larger &amp; more stable, income vs consumption? . @FoxBusinessAM @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/O0yKNBjsea
Over 90% of our purchases of new retail goods are bought at less than 12% of retailers by dollar volume. #FAIRtax works on a large scale barter does not. https://t.co/3g0V7yyI0u
@tracygee_ Walmart forces suppliers to lower prices every time the suppliers costs drop. They use that to beat their competitors.
Today, in every service you pay the income/payroll/investment taxes of all the businesses that service provider used for business inputs. https://t.co/EEfauCFj9i https://t.co/iulfbKA6ea
@hijodelibertad Some minor leakage in services.  Most sales of new goods easily tracked. Why are retailers going to risk loss of business licenses to either retain tax or not collect it.
Consumption is far more stable than income in the long run. #FAIRtax will put more money in people's pockets, higher wages, higher purchasing power. Read https://t.co/2BYyZqdvFC https://t.co/mVQXCotooZ

Chairman's Report - December 7, 2018 | https://t.co/QQy45oA4QJ https://t.co/gcvHkNyJgO  a very important feature of #FAIRtax is its lower rate of evasion compared to an income tax. Limited opportunity. Fewer pressures &amp; incentives to evade.
@ERICIX That is not a feature of the #FAIRtax.
So if the prebate is an estimated $600 billion  https://t.co/cprUkMlKZX and estimated current evasion is over $700 billion https://t.co/pqihmnv7Dq how can it "cost" us? https://t.co/4U9fo9hJm3

Hey #Tarriffman we can end tariffs, end embedded payroll/income/investment taxes, just take #FAIRtax to the people. @Mike_Pence you were a 12 yr cosponsor. @FoxBusinessAM @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/FJ4AKXugin
A tax preparation company touts the fact that it uses a supercomputer to analyze your tax return. That says a lot about our tax system. #FAIRtax https://t.co/EEfauCnIhK https://t.co/WrhsVfRQFY
@Thunderelic @BenSasse @realDonaldTrump BTW #FAIRtax is not a VAT on consumer goods in the style of a tax added in the chain of commerce. It is an end point of retail sale one time tax on new goods/services and with no business income/payroll/investment taxes prices go down 12-14% due to competition
@Thunderelic @BenSasse @realDonaldTrump One more https://t.co/zYP2gzNfVi
@Thunderelic @BenSasse @realDonaldTrump What is the FAIRtax https://t.co/Dm2KpnWNlR
@Thunderelic @BenSasse @realDonaldTrump You are quite ignorant of how #FAIRtax works. There is 0% unreimbursed tax on spending up to poverty level. How does that hurt the poor? No poor person will ever have a 23% net effective tax rate or tax burden under FAIRtax. https://t.co/fX1F2jWGDO
Most of the critics of the #FAIRtax either lie about it or are ill-informed and criticize what they THINK the plan is and not what it REALLY is. https://t.co/tQNXLOMu1J https://t.co/g0ZtmiKdSa

@housebudgetGOP @RepRobWoodall Would have helped to have mentioned America's https://t.co/EEfauCnIhK #FAIRtax as part of the solution to one side of the equation. Yes SS/Medicare are underfunded and switching to a 300 million consumer tax base would help fix that. https://t.co/tNGk71HA3c
@BenSasse #FAIRtax is far far superior as a tax policy. It ends the embedded taxes in American goods/services, reduces the prices, and improves the economy. @realDonaldTrump  run on it in 2020. https://t.co/KFDVsZbNus
Americans dream big. Americans love freedom &amp; liberty. Americans are great at finding solutions. @realDonaldTrump we need America's https://t.co/EEfauCFj9i https://t.co/r8Zw1otrUM
Are there faults with #FAIRtax? Sure, but you have to hunt for them. @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria @GovMikeHuckabee https://t.co/K1HJ8ZfCtb
Our current tax code punishes hard work, innovation, savings &amp; thrift. #FAIRtax punishes nothing. Freedom to decide when, why &amp; how much you are taxed. @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxBusinessAM  @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/sL1h47sAi8

@Robot73I @trialkat @TimChiappe It is NOT tiered by any economic factor other than proven household size. Read the chart. It shows 1 adult no dependent and up from there. It shows 2 adult and no dependent and up from there. That is not a "tier" based on wage, income, or anything other than family size.
No flat income tax can or does end the IRS. No flat income tax will stay flat. No flat income tax eliminates FICA payroll taxes. No flat income tax significantly reduces evasion. Why would we bother? @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/MfYrujh1x3

The Florida Grown PAC ad is false. It ignores the prebate. It ignores the replacement of income, payroll, investment taxes and the compliance costs. https://t.co/tQNXLP45qj https://t.co/hJd9FTYjfv
The #FAIRtax WILL NOT raise the costs of goods &amp; services 23%. Because it replaces roughly 24% FICA, income, investment taxes &amp; compliance costs consumers will have higher purchasing power. https://t.co/YODW6k2Ksb
No other tax plan eliminates business payroll, income, investment taxes and the massive compliance costs that go with them. Time for #TrueTaxReform @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @NFIB @NSBA https://t.co/UAAPcM5x7q
A PAC supporting @adamputnam is lying about #FAIRtax creating a 23% increase in prices and a 23% burden on taxpayers ignoring the prebate, ignoring no FICA, no income tax, no investment tax. Shameful. https://t.co/aS0eAZtGsT

An income tax will ALWAYS violate your privacy because you are forced to give too much information to the government. #FAIRtax keeps NO federal tax record on taxpayers. @FoxBusinessAM  @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/vikV2710ql

We operate this page @FairTaxOfficial  with the help of volunteers. Not sure what page you are referring to but we respond to comments, concerns and inaccuracies as time permits.
ONLY the #FAIRtax ends the IRS forever as all federal taxes are retail sales taxes collected by the retailers and enforced by state sales tax agencies. @FoxBusinessAM  @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/zNgRTErf2T
The right answer on #TrueTaxReform is #FAIRtax. We need to stop yelling at each other, stop accusing each other, and just do the thing that helps the most people. https://t.co/EEfauCFj9i is #PASSFAIRtax. https://t.co/lB3p8w6LtM
#FAIRtax bakes the biggest pie! Time to run on it in 2020 @realDoanldTrump @Mike_Pence @larry_kudlow because no other tax policy grows the economy like #FAIRtax. https://t.co/PuQPqIXPnj

@tradefeedz @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @larry_kudlow Federal corporate taxes on income, payroll, investment go away. State and local taxes are not directly controlled by FAIRtax but most will switch to a large broadbased tax on consumption to replace income and property taxes.
@tradefeedz @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @larry_kudlow It goes away. No #FAIRtax on any business input, no tax on business income or investments and no payroll taxes. Costs of doing business go down on average 18-24%. Competition and market forces will push prices down avg. 12-14%.
#FAIRtax has nothing for businesses to lobby in relation to taxes. @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @larry_kudlow you know eliminating 10,,000 tax lobbyists will help #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/ha2m4CIo1t
@tradefeedz @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @larry_kudlow Only individuals pay taxes. Businesses and llc's pass all tax costs including compliance and avoidance on to individual workers, investors or consumers. So #FAIRtax only taxes retail sales of NEW goods &amp; services to individuals. https://t.co/tQNXLP45qj https://t.co/SVQdpK7OEK
No it will not. Why, because over 90% of our retail sales of NEW goods are sold by less than 15% of retailers and consumers are not likely to change. @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @larry_kudlow https://t.co/PyDERSQ827
For 12 years @Mike_Pence was a cosponsor of HR 25 @FAIRtax in @Congress. @realDonaldTrump time to run on it in 2020. @SarahHuckabee @GovMikeHuckabee @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria https://t.co/9CPJdzhCAm
No border adjustment, tariffs, or trade wars needed with #FAIRtax because it has no embedded taxes. @FoxBusinessAM  @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria @GovMikeHuckabee @SarahHuckabee @TeamCavuto https://t.co/eGk17F4J3f
How does it work? #FAIRtax is simple, visible &amp; efficient #TrueTaxReform. https://t.co/3REIOYe49o

Cut the cost of higher education by up to 50%. Eliminate embedded tax costs. No tax on tuition because education is an investment. https://t.co/SB9xPJf3rb https://t.co/YGmP8UGZ1D

As evasion climbs the IRS is going to grow more and more aggressive. Good people trying to comply with 74,600 pgs. of code, regulation &amp; interpretation will be raked over the coals by a weaponized agency. https://t.co/91XPoUNXI9
The #TaxCutsJobsAct is not #TaxReform but the #FAIRtax is total reform. Read the research  https://t.co/WQfjIPfWTX https://t.co/Yl5FUC363n
No other #TaxReform provides as much of these 3 things. #FAIRtax fully replaces our current tax system.  https://t.co/JrUm0grPmO @GovMikeHuckabee @SarahHuckabee @MariaBartiromo @marklevinshow https://t.co/ijQAZ8p4Rq
Florida has some great volunteers who do weekly shows on #FAIRtax. Check it out. @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec https://t.co/V3PAfrsHAs
Consumption is far more stable than income. As the economy grows typically consumption grows. #FAIRtax grows the economy more than any tax policy. https://t.co/tYwP4p3stx
