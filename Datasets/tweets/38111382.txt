@dontisc @RockerMyK @cameron_kasky @thecjpearson Blacks did not have any rights when the 2nd Amendment was written.

@WiIIiamson @RockerMyK @cameron_kasky @thecjpearson Well a British invasion probably was on the authors' minds, but one of the main reasons why the 2nd Amendment was ratified was to protect well-regulated slave patrol militias against black uprisings.

@GayConservativ3 Presidents Kennedy &amp; Reagan were surrounded by highly trained &amp; well-armed Secret Service. Both of them were shot. One of them barely survived. You cannot guarantee guns (in the hands of amateurs) would've saved anyone in a dark, crowded, noisy club. Imagine the panic &amp; chaos.
@0ryuge @GayConservativ3 I'd love to hear you explain how Conservatives fought for gay rights. I'll wait.
@GayConservativ3 Harvey Milk was assassinated by a gun. He died fighting for your rights. The fact that you can openly call yourself "gay conservative" in this country is reason enough to be thankful.
@GayConservativ3 No talespinner, I didn't say "ALL gay people go to clubs and get smashing drunk." I said arming a bunch of drunk people w/ guns is a foolish idea. Getting in a car w/ a drunk driver is a foolish idea. But from your logic, I'm guessing you see nothing dangerous about that either.
@LNSmithee @c5galaxydriver @RockerMyK @cameron_kasky @thecjpearson I'm not complaining.

@dontisc @RockerMyK @cameron_kasky @thecjpearson You just basically downgraded two life-altering amendments (one that ended slavery and another that created rights for women) as something akin to modest handouts. Really?
@LNSmithee @c5galaxydriver @RockerMyK @cameron_kasky @thecjpearson And Conservatives only started not caring about "chronic adultery" when #DonaldTrump was doing it.

Behind-the-scenes, I was hand-picked to work on the "Zendaya Project" with my then EVP of Programming. It was all about elevating Zendaya into superstardom. Now, over 7 years later, she's gone on to act in an Oscar nominated picture(!). https://t.co/2lpnzwFXTj
Back in the Fall of 2010, we had a big "Shake It Up" launch party in the Disney Channel lobby. Zendaya made an appearance. I remember she was so new to show business (as was I). She was bright-eyed and eager to be joining the Disney family (as was I). https://t.co/2lpnzwFXTj
I started my career at Disney Channel one month before "Shake It Up" premiered. I can say I played a very small role in Zendaya's entire Disney Channel career. I promoted the hell out of every sitcom, music video, and DCOM project she was in. https://t.co/2lpnzwFXTj

@InfinitumNihil what genre is shantaram?
tired from a morning with kindergarteners, but inspired me... characters for another screenplay, perhaps?
@JanetJackson is there going to be a new album in early 2010?
@InfinitumNihil the rum diary sounds intriguing.  depp back in the caribbean sounds good to me.
@six7music anything with jam and lewis is pure magic.  looking fwd to hearing all of your future collabos. take care...
@JasonKennedy1 good job on chelsea the other night.  you should be on there more often. although i don't know how you kept your composure.
@JonathanRKnight you should adopt. i'm sure you could bring a lot of joy into his or her life.
going to work now.  had a good day, but a lazy, lazy day.
@CAgEEk79 AGREED on special k ;)
@donaldrickert oh i hope you got your wish granted.
@buzzfly whoah.... tune in... groove on...bust out.  i think that's a line from "summer vacation" ;)
@mrskutcher the supermarket conspiracy makes me sad.  is that an example of greedy corporate america?  giving & sharing benefits all.
why allergies, why?!?!
it will be good.  i don't know what it will be, but it will be good.
@CAgEEk79 i prefer to call them B.e.e.Fs. instead of besties ;)
@donaldrickert it's called the bakertucky syndrome...
been hard at work on my family tree... found my ancestor belonged in the court of henry VIII. i am generation 14 to him.
@donaldrickert did you talk about how you have a man crush on me? (or was it the other way around?) how you durin?!?
@donaldrickert but you have so many... :)
@MoniqueMonahan what was the name of the production?
@larrybirkhead soreness means you did it right, right?

@JonathanRKnight so are you glad to be back into the groove of performing and whatnot?
@jonathan_isaiah this is your bday? well happy bday, buddy!
@XxDonnyxX ah you should do it!
@XxDonnyxX so glad my boy JT won.  though it would've been cool for the 100thou to go to one of the underdogs.
@ThanatoticPoet buying dried mango at 15 bucks a bag often and you'd have enough money to buy a dehydrator. food for thought...
@XxDonnyxX ah, i'm gonna have to be careful about your updates cuz i'm going to watch it tomorrow. just glad coach is gone :)
@yehudaberg i am questioning my future and where i am headed, but i'm trying to embrace certainty even though there is much fear
watching crouching tiger, hidden dragon for the first time and eating dried mango.
@WilliamOrbit have you ever worked with mariah carey?
i think a trip to the gym is in order.
um taking fish oil pills makes me want to barf. gag.
@jordanknight so is this cruise part of the nkotb tour? or something else?
@ThanatoticPoet vodka and cranberry?
@WilliamOrbit hello w.o. did you produce a mariah carey track called "angel of fire" ? i always wondered about that net rumor.
@JasonKennedy1 ride pirates for me :)
i think lou dobbs should've already made the switch to fox news.
just got back from the mall and borders and chipotle. what a way to start my day before going to work :)
@jonathan_isaiah a taurus, huh?  you guys really get into the whole aesthetics of love, right?

@ChristopherM920 so where have you ended up? gotta catch me up CM, it's been too long...
@TinaFey how long did you write before you found fame on SNL? just trying to guesstimate my own timeline in the industry...
@JonathanRKnight it's funny to think about 1989... i was in 9th/10th grade watching you and the band on a disney world 4th of july special.
buying on itunes.... benny benassi
@SandraBernhard dick cheney thrives on fear and it is creating self-doubt.  he is a gingerbread man and we all know how that story ends...
84 degrees and the sunshine is calling me.  gonna catch some rays...
@SandraBernhard omg i'd love to see wanda rip into rush... is there a video somewhere?
@GiulianaRancic i really don't know when you guys sleep... i'm sure you have other things to do on E! today as well.
cooking cinnamon apples for my waffles in the morning...
just got home from work. pretty exhausted. so not easy to go to sleep when it is sunny out.
@Oprah fires like that are scary. i would worry about losing my photographs... things that cannot be replaced.
@GiulianaRancic what dvd are you going to watch? have you seen the documentary "young @ heart" ???
getting to leave for work. going to watch snl tonight. hope my client sleeps throughout.  had a churro for dessert. a saturday ends on high.
@CAgEEk79 i love doing laundry, i just hate putting it away!
@WilliamOrbit yes, it is absolutely one of my all time fave collabos between you & her.
@matcat roger contacted marvel re: his spidey films. i'm supposed to watch the first one today...
@CAgEEk79 reminds me of vallarta
@WilliamOrbit any plans on releasing "like an angel..." on cd?
off to bed. starting to fade which is good. hoping to fall asleep reading a magazine. arch digest 4 daydreams and nightvisions.
longs for the day when i don't have to take "simply sleep" to simply, well, sleep!  working nights is cause for insomnia insanity.
@buzzfly the party put out some good tunes. such a long time ago... innocence of youth lost but not forgotten. peace out mr. hampton!
just got an email from a "friend" asking if i'm alive. and that's it.  you don't return my calls and question my absence? wtf?!?
@WilliamOrbit did you produce "like an angel passing through my room" with madonna?  wish i had that on cd.
@MariahCarey another album in the works? how exciting is that?!? is it true you wrote a song with madonna called "angel of fire" ?
@MariahCarey do you know when TENNESSEE comes out on dvd?  i've been wanting to see it...
is wondering if eating taco bell after going to the gym is some sort of oxymoron.  a paradox, perhaps?
@mrskutcher i just bought satan: an autobiography by y. berg... have you read that one yet?
@donaldrickert yes, you are quite magical :)
listening to tiesto at 3:10am! wtf...
@andersoncooper would you consider doing a foster care/adoption segment? we need to rescue our children!

@ThanatoticPoet that just happened to me actually!
going to the gym soon....... actually going there and working out is a different story!
@donaldrickert the setting sun?  where are you that the sun is setting at 531pm?
@MoniqueMonahan what kind of dog do you have? what did you name it?
@vincentludovic children's book wasn't working, so i am writing my story in screenplay form and possibly into a comic book.
