@NightlyPolitics Couldn't do better than Beto O'Rourke.
@RepSwalwell @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a mobster and a traitor, a Russian asset here to destroy America.
@essenviews @Ronniemair1 Traitor Republicans. Russian sympathizers facilitating the destruction of American democracy.
@Jim_Jordan Jordan, you are nothing, a nobody in history. Your name will not even be mentioned. You are just another Republican scumbag traitor sympathizing with Vladimir Putin. May you rot in hell for what you are doing to this country.
@realDonaldTrump You have the mentality of a 5 yr old. F_ck you.
@essenviews I hope Don Jr. goes to prison and gets butt raped.
@michaelschweitz What a lot of ugliness, Roseanne.

@EdKrassen @JackieGailConr1 Every day that passes brings further damage to America. The shutdown was a masterstroke war move by Putin's @realDonaldTrump. Impeachment is the least we should do.
The so-called "Trump Shutdown" is an act of war by Vladimir Putin being carried out by @realDonaldTrump and his Republican cohorts. Putin has successfully crippled our government and is devastating millions of our people. This is not about a border wall dispute. It is about war.
@SenatorRomney @POTUS Big Bird wants to peck your eyes out, Mitt.

@HillaryClinton Mr. Trump is delighted, I'm sure. That's what he is here to do.
@RepTedDeutch He is here to damage US. He has been very successful. Finally, something he's good at.
@brycetache @realDonaldTrump He doesn't look scared. He looks smug.
@sarahkendzior It's time for the GOPer party to go down. Every last one of them is complicit.

@AOC Finally, we are making progress against the failed War on Drugs. How many lives have been ruined, not by the plant, but by Law Enforcement and the legal system in general? It is time to end it.
@realDonaldTrump If I didn't know you were lying, that would be pretty cool.
@realDonaldTrump @wef I'm sure you won't be missed.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We should get him out of there by whatever means we can muster.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Would you protect Robert Mueller, too?
@SenSanders It's all part of the Putin plan. Trump is here for a reason: to damage or destroy America.
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump There is no line they will not cross.
@BernieSanders Good time to invade us. Donald has us sofened up. Just move in for the coup de gras.
@NightlyPolitics That one there, and that on over there, and, Hell, just take them all.

@realDonaldTrump We're hip to your tricks, POTUS-Man. You're looking bad in the press now.
You present this like it's something to be proud of Mr. Hannutty. You are going to pay, Russian sympathizer. Stick up for your country, damn you. https://t.co/1UijODwhqe
@realDonaldTrump It's called Freedom of the Press, numb nuts.
@realDonaldTrump Legalize weed you lying f_cker. You can at least do that.
@realDonaldTrump You and your GOPer buddies couldn't care less about the stupid wall. What you are after is $5.7Billion to line your traitorous pockets. How much does Pootin get? 	You are doing everything you can think of to bring America down. 	We're coming for you, asshole.
@seanhannity Leave AOC alone, you f_cker.

@RandPaul @RandPaul you are just another Ayn Rand Republican. I have no respect for you.
@Jim_Jordan You don't want a wall. It's a boondoggle. You want the money. Well, you can't have it.
@realDonaldTrump No. You can't have $5.6 BILLION. I know you want to steal it, but we won't allow it.
@realDonaldTrump You aren't getting your boondoggle wall. All you want is to steal the money.
@GunReformRyan Go away, Russian sympathizer.

@senorrinhatch Hot damn. Don't let the door hit you in the ass, Orrin.
@realDonaldTrump Donnie, your wall is as stupid as you.
@SenatorDurbin Trump is very successful at what he came here to do, which is damage/destroy America for Russia. Otherwise, he's insane.
@RudyGiuliani You aren't believable, Igor, you nasty little lying ogre. You aren't fit to shine Nancy Pelosi's shoes with your tongue. 		Go away.
@realDonaldTrump Hey, DonDon, why don't you pay for the wall? You can get a loan and not pay it back. Simple, believe me.
@realDonaldTrump Just more bullsh_t, Donnie. Try again.

@seanhannity Sounds like bullsh_t to me.
@seanhannity What Democrat group?
@stopthenutjob @realDonaldTrump Absolutely right. It has been obvious from the start. Trump is here to destroy us in the name of Pootin. Somebody get him out of there. Every day he brings our democracy closer to disaster.

@NathanHRubin I think the word they are looking for is 'petulant'.

@funder Trump's boy toy.

"Every vote matters this year, and in a midterm year, all votes are equal. There are no “swing states” this year, and no electoral college to worry about.  There are just Americans voting, in record numbers, for candidates who excite them." 	Please vote this year. Vote Blue.
@Brasilmagic lol
@HollyResist Sorry for your loss, my friend.
@wvjoe911 "Just start shooting"? Republicans? Heck yes. Line them fkrs up.
@QuancyClayborne Nope, it's unique. I can relate, my middle name is Quinton.
@nowthisnews Just think. Most of the passengers will be Republicans. Will history repeat itself? One can hope.
I voted today!	 Straight Dem.	 10/23/2018	 Be like me.
Don't believe the bullsh_t artists in the White House.		https://t.co/Y4fbmjg9uu
@realDonaldTrFan Did you take lessons to be so stupid, or did it come naturally?
@SpeakerRyan Shut up liar.

@maydaymindy9 I love computer stuff. Online shopping is the best.
@wvjoe911 Little weasel has completely sold out to @realDonaldTrump For a long while, he seemed to be a voice of reason, but when John McCain died he went nuts.
Nikki Haley @nikkihaley is not the least bit funny. She's a right wing bloviator with no redeeming value. Please stop showing her obnoxious speech.
@AnnCoulter Go jump in the lake.
This is a problem we need to be paying attention to.		https://t.co/W1gUjpo2x1
@Anonsource7 @BernieSanders @SSWorks Liar.

@Brasilmagic It was a shameful spectacle.
@Stop_Trump20 Just before this picture was taken, he had that finger up his own ass.
@realDonaldTrump When are you going to start slaughtering dissidents, Donnie? You're falling behind, a-hole. Get off of your fat ass.
@AidenWolfe Don't apologize! Melanoma Trump is a known slut.
@realDonaldTrump Be careful! Don't crash and burn to death.
@wvjoe911 Melanoma Trump is vile.
@seanhannity You are professional bullshit artist.
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is SO bad, he makes excrement look like chocolate.

@realDonaldTrump Scanning through the comments on this post, I see that the majority of them don't like you. You are an unfunny dirty joke.
@MrsRabbitResist Yes, absolutely.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You aren't fit to say the word Texas. Boof you punk.

@DonaldJTrumpJr You filthy little POS, you know absolutely nothing about "Nam". I wish you were there right now sweating in the jungle with your feet rotting.
@kathydiz11 @senorrinhatch You, my dear, are a fool and a dupe. You don't want health care, education, good roads, clean air... What the hell am I doing. You won't even hear this.
@Yamiche He's just a punk. (That's what they call male prostitutes in prison.)
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don't fret, Junior. You may be in jail by then.
@VP Pence, you are a sociopathic God-freak, and an egregious homophobe. Go jump in the lake. (of fire)
@GeorgeTakei 10 points for using the word 'miscreants'. lol
@SenatorCollins The information Sen. Collins based her decision on was faulty and incomplete. Shame on her. Shame on the GOP. Now we will never get rid of Donald Trump.
@Yamiche Manchin is a party traitor with no balls.
@ECMcLaughlin Hemlock.
@MikeJPassmore Does the KKK allow women in their ranks? It sure sounds like they do.
@SpeakerRyan Ryan, you have a black heart and no soul. I don't believe a word you say.
@KamalaHarris Yes!! Kavenaugh is a misogynistic predator, extremely partisan and partial to the GOP, and will ensure we are stuck with Russia's traitorous Donald Trump. I oppose his confirmation.
@senorrinhatch Her decision was based on incomplete and incorrect information. This whole evaluation is a farce. Shame on the GOP. Shame on you.
@SenJoniErnst @senorrinhatch Get boofed.
@leahmcelrath Black heart and no soul.
@senorrinhatch Please legalize cannabis now. End the "war on drugs"

@realDonaldTrump lol, good joke, and it's not even funny. We are laughing at you, as is the whole world. You fkn Russian co_ksucker.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You got it, shithead.
@senorrinhatch You should dump Kavenaugh and focus on ending the failed drug war.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You ain't seen nothin' yet, punko.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are the enemy of the people, Donald, you traitor.
@RealMuckmaker God wants him to reveal his true nature and suck a pecker.
@Jim_Jordan Remember, don't drink Roundup. It can kill you.
@AdamSchiffCA @RepAdamSchiff for President, 2020. You Trump suckers are Russian collaborators. Traitors and fools.
@LindseyGrahamSC You changed your stance on presidential culpability, a complete reversal on what you said before Congress regarding President Bill Clinton. I have no respect for you.
@RepSwalwell Save the Dream. Stop Kavanaugh. Legalize cannabis. Impeach Trump now. That's where we stand. Thank you.
@Shapiro4FL16 @VernBuchanan Stop Kavanaugh. Legalize cannabis. Impeach Trump now. That's where we stand. Thank you.

@RealMuckmaker Leavenworth prison would do.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS @ICEgov More accurately, I want to abolish the GOP.
@Manum_Babloo @MizKit2 Death sentence for criticizing the government... Trump would love this.
@rdewald wonderful
@RealMuckmaker Al Franken @alfranken is a treasure. I would vote for him.

@UROCKlive1 No.
Happy birthday! https://t.co/UOldNSmVd5
@HardballChris @OMAROSA I am embarrassed for you, @HardballChris You are better than this. Omarosa is pathetic.
@RealMuckmaker Sarah, have you forgiven your daddy for dropping you on your face when you were three days old? I'm sure he didn't mean to.
If I were you I would be embarrassed to put the spotlight on this fraud, Omarosa. It's pathetic. I hope you keep it to a minimum.
This Omarosa thing is sickening. If I were you, I would be ashamed that MSNBC has been covering it heavily all day long.
@VelshiRuhle @OMAROSA @AliVelshi @SRuhle Omarosa is a pathetic fraud. Why are you making her famous? Ignore her!
@SRuhle, why are you and others focusing on this ridiculous clown, Omarosa? She deserves NO attention. You are making her famous! She has zero credibility. Ignore her!
@RealMuckmaker Jordan brings shame to Congress. He's just another complicit traitor licking the shoes of Treasonous Trump.
@IndivisibleNet Hell, yeah, Mr. Avenatti. Go for it!
@VP Space Force... You are going to regret militarizing low Earth orbit. Everybody else will do it, too.
@rdewald There's nothing much better than home grown tomatoes. Are these growing in your apartment?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Mr. Trump, why do you lie every time you say anything? Do you even know the truth? We won't let you get away with destroying our country. Too many people know what you are up to. Too many real Americans will stop you. We will not serve a dictator. You will never be King.
@RandPaul Dude, Libertarians are just Republicans that want to play with no rules. That's all you are.
@thehill Ted @tedcruz bows to the inevitable. "Help me, Daddy,," Ted says.
@Brasilmagic Another one?? How much did Donald pay this one for her silence?
@Brasilmagic Work it, baby!
@funder It appears that we are at war. The Russians are executing a massive cyber war. They have damaged our Democracy beyond repair already, and Trump is complicit. Stop him!
@dannyoconnor1 Try it again. Our country needs you.
@mitchellreports This can't be allowed to happen! Might as well abandon the US Constitution and implement monarchy.
@MichaelAvenatti @McDonalds I am aghast, Michael Avenatti. A birth certificate is a holy document! I hope you changed it https://t.co/i0NKbO5nSz shouldn't misrepresent one's age! :p
@BetoORourke Good luck, Beto O'Rourke! It is well past time for Ted Cruz to go.
@senorrinhatch Senator Hatch, Brett Kavanaugh will turn back the clock on 60 years of hard-won progress. Who would want backroom abortions? He will almost certainly excuse Donald Trump's treason and corruption. That is unacceptable.
@RealMuckmaker Back to Hell!!

@TomSteyer Thank you, @TomSteyer, you are so needed now.
@MichaelAvenatti Thank you, @MichaelAvenatti, we need you here.
@RudyGiuliani Igor Ghouliani, you crack me up.
@realDonaldTrump There's a difference between 'open borders' and open arms. We progressives welcome those who have legitimate appeals for asylum, and the hard working immigrants who seek a better life. Middle-class Americans don't want to work picking fruit for 14 hours in 110 F heat.

@SSWorks Destroying it will destroy lives. So many people will die miserably. It's barbaric.
@rdewald Yes. It is pretty tasty.
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's right. Shit jobs abound. Part time only, minimum wage, three jobs at one time....
@realDonaldTrump We're on to you now, Donald. Only your gullible fools believe you. You are king of the ignorant., You believe your own bullsh_t. We are laughing at you, buddy, You are a bloviating buffoon and a traitor to the United States of America.

@TheLastWord Good place for him. Maybe he will stay.
@JonLemire @realDonaldTrump the MSM got you elected with their incessant attention to your lies and behavior. You owe them respect and gratitude. They keep you in the limelight now, which you thrive on. Answer their questions. Don't be a coward.
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerRyan you have zero credibility, so why should we believe you. I hope one day that you need one of our social services and can't get it.
@CarlMacon2 @EndPayToPlay @realDonaldTrump Another Russian troll.

@RudyGiuliani Oh, Igor. Go dig up another corpse.

@Steve50945209 @CjohnsonNV @irishkat123 @Jim_Jordan Pathetic Russian troll.
@SpeakerRyan We understand the problem. What exactly are you going to do about it?
@StateDept @SecPompeo I pray every day that treasonous Trump and all of his supporters, including you, will meet they're demise while we still have a modicum of Democracy left.
@VP We get no MSM updates on what is going on with our shooting wars. We're supposed to take your word for it? I don't think so.
@VP Gee Mr. Mike, could you be more full of crap?
@thehill God help us, no!
Nothing to fear. We already do it. We just need more of it. https://t.co/nViwDo9XWu
@elonmusk Mr. Musk, you are one of the heroes of the 21st Century. Please rescue American democracy by supporting the Democratic Socialist movement. Save us from King Donald.
@VP @StateDept I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof', thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp;State.
@thehill Too bad she wasn't on it.
@RudyGiuliani Michael Avenati is a lawyer. Igor Giuliani is a crackpot.
@realDonaldTrump What is shadow banning?
@rdewald What a beautiful thing to say.
@thehill Pootie gets it right.
@RudyGiuliani That's a blatant lie. Trump suggests cash and Cohen says no. You are twisting the facts.
@Jim_Jordan You are going to have to live with your treasonous support of Trump for the rest of your life. Enjoy.
@costareports Sessions is weasely.
@cuddlycrow @_waleedshahid @Comey Nobody I know of wants pure Socialism. We need more Democratic Socialism. What we already have a tiny bit of left. It's where everybody pitches in for the greater good.

@Salon Finally, someone acknowledges the obvious. Trump is an active Russian agent. Somebody stop him! What is wrong with you, GOP? You are enabling a traitor.
@thehill George Washington wouldn't have anything to do with Donald Trump.
@realDonaldTrump You're not fooling me, Donnie John. You are an act of war by the Russians. You aren't stupid. You are here representing Russia. You are doing as much damage to my country as you can before you are stopped. And you will be stopped. I have that much faith in our Constitution..
@thehill Igor Giuliani, creepy little hunchback.

@realDonaldTrump You will go down in American History as a dark and dangerous madman. I wish you ill.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Stick it in your ear, you lying traitor.
@realDonaldTrump You lying sack of rotting trash. It's not the Democrats. It's you and your sinister policies. Own it axxhole. You belong in a cage sitting outside in the rain and snow, so we can come by and laugh at you. You belong before a firing squad, traitor.
