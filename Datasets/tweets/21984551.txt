@otivar55 @BET The hub of our greatness may be, yes, we get knocked down &amp; make mistakes. Then, many give all to make the US better, again.
@otivar55 @BET  We're using DNA forensics on evidence &amp; reviewing witnesses, proving numerous black men in prison were wrongfully convicted.
@otivar55 @BET With blatant racial profiling &amp; unarmed innocent black kids being killed by cops &amp; citizens w/o consequences, it hurts us.
@otivar55 @BET Racism, sexism, etc. will hold us back, until purged. When our female reps won't vote for equal pay for women, it seems grim.
@otivar55 @BET  But the real issue, sadly, beyond the wanton greed, is that he is black. And as much as we educate ourselves, racism sticks.
@otivar55 @BET Now we learn 3x more death threats than any other pres. Some more real than threats. Why? Might put us back on track of USA.
@otivar55 @BET The result, verbal attacks &amp; commmentary on First Family that turn my stomach. Threats and remarks that border on treason.

@otivar55 @BET So we wait &amp; hop for a great leader to come along with the courage to make the long-awaited changes so desperately needed.
@otivar55 @BET To look in the mirror at what we have become, at such a price, in  betrayal of our founding principles &amp; goals is too painful
@otivar55 @BET We have religious fanaticism to rival that of the Reformation, unapologetically, despite science &amp; multicultural knowledge.
@otivar55 @BET Every kind of evil "ism" still tears at the fabric of our nation. We came out of the gate ahead but fell quickly behind.

@FDACSNews @FLForestService Ppl sending up these huge rockets often see them fizzle out, when they've really landed on asphalt roof. Fire!
@NathanSkaggs Not really, when consequences considered. Have any idea how many women become insulin dependant diabetics due to pregnancy?
@NathanSkaggs As do I; but they aren't. I don't blame men. But the physical &amp; financial toll on a woman is extreme. Best interests of child.
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch Why war on men? You've gotta be kidding! Taking responsibility for your sperm too much?!
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch Financial responsibility as rigorous as student loans for woman &amp; child. Consider it liability.
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch Nevermind. As it does take two, it's high time men faced real consequences for pregnancies.
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch What point was that Nathan?
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch This logic could be used to argue that every sperm not used in effort for child is murder.
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch BC pills the first choice for treatment of endometriosis in non-sexually active girls &amp; women.
@NathanSkaggs @vulcanscience @PabonMatriarch What makes no sense is bc pills prevent egg from ever being fertilized. No being killed.
