What Happens to Asylum Seekers While Their Application Is Processed?		Some of these individuals may live in the United States while their application is processed, yet the government has detained others—including children and families—for some or all of this time.
How Long Does the Asylum Process Take?		Overall, the asylum process can take years to conclude. In some cases, a person may file his or her application and receive a hearing or interview date years in the future.
Is There a Deadline for Asylum Applications?		An individual generally must apply for asylum within one year. Some asylum seekers may never know that a deadline exists after facing traumatic repercussions from their time in detention or journeying to the United States.
Does the U.S. Have to Protect Those Who Qualify as Refugees?		As a signatory to the 1967 Protocol, and through U.S. immigration law, the United States has legal obligations to provide protection to those who qualify as refugees.
What Is Asylum?		Asylum is a protection granted to foreign nationals already in the United States or at the border who meet the international law definition of a “refugee.”

This decision gives #TPS holders critical time to safely remain in the United States with their families. It also affords Congress time to provide a legislative solution for many of these long-time residents who have built their lives and homes in America. https://t.co/O9k42uq6AU
The decision describes both direct and circumstantial evidence of the White House placing pressure on DHS to terminate these #TPS designations, based at least in part on President Trump’s “expressed animus against non-white, non-European immigrants.” https://t.co/O9k42uq6AU
Additionally, the judge stated that #TPS holders with U.S.-born children face the “choice of bringing their children with them (and tearing them away from the only country and community they have known) or splitting their families apart.” https://t.co/O9k42uq6AU

A Record 13,300 Migrant Children Are Being Detained by the Trump Administration by @jbreisblatt https://t.co/MGT7piAIJe
Read more about why Congress must not only conduct rigorous oversight of HHS and ICE, but also insist on holding the agencies to the budget and operational direction they have been given → https://t.co/RTf69xJXmc
However, recently the rate of children being released from HHS has dropped dramatically, as families and guardians in the United States have been too scared to come forward.
After children reach the border, they are placed in the custody of HHS as the government works to identify parents or other suitable guardians to care for the child while their immigration proceedings progress.
These kids by and large arrive at the Southern border alone, seeking refuge in the United States.
This increase is largely due to the administration’s new policies and not an indication that more unaccompanied children are coming to the US-Mexico border.
THREAD: The Trump administration is holding a record level of 13,300 migrant children in its custody, forcing the government to shift hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure there is enough money and bed space in Health and Human Services facilities (HHS).

"We believe in an America that sees the potential in all people. This proposed regulation declares null and void that premise. Instead, they would pre-judge and penalize hard-working families based on the size of their bank account.
"The immigrant story has long been one of men, women and children arriving in America with little more than the drive to succeed and the desire to be reunited with family."
"Many people now would be forced to choose between accessing the assistance they and their children need now or securing permanent legal immigration status to be with their families in the future."
"These proposals would break that fundamental promise. These lengthy and technical changes to longstanding regulations would obstruct those whose only desire is to work hard and be with their family."
“The Trump administration’s proposed changes to the public charge regulations are an unprecedented attack on legal immigration. They signal an intent to abandon the basic principle that America is a land of opportunity for people, rich and poor.

Trump Administration Proposes Regulations in ‘Flores’ to Detain Migrant Children Longer in Unsafe Conditions by @roycebmurray	https://t.co/0ErVSdWDkq
Read our full statement here → https://t.co/XRSZZUaQDK
"There are viable alternatives to detention that are more humane, less costly, and just as effective at ensuring people comply with their obligations as they face removal proceedings."
“The manner in which this administration treats migrant children shocks the conscience. Harsh treatment of children must never be the solution."
"And we know, after witnessing the trauma-inducing practice of family separation, child welfare has never been a priority for this administration. This proposal is further evidence of that fact.”
"From our hands-on work providing legal services to detained families through the Dilley Pro Bono Project, we have seen the indecency and serious harm caused by detaining children."
"The federal government’s proposal would expand family detention, lock up parents and children indefinitely, and hold them in unsafe conditions."
“Under the Flores settlement, all children must be treated with ‘dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors,’ but these new regulations would do the opposite."
The following statement is from Beth Werlin, executive director of the American Immigration Council, on Trump Administration's proposal to indefinitely detain children:

"Our experience defending families in detention, first in Artesia, New Mexico and now in Dilley, Texas, has taught us that family detention is never humane.”
"The zero-tolerance policy is cruel and unnecessary.  We should not have to choose between separating parents from their children and expanding the shameful practice of imprisoning families."
"Today's executive order does nothing to change the fact that the administration is attacking families and criminalizing asylum seekers."
The following is a statement from Beth Werlin, Executive Director of the American Immigration Council, on Trump's Executive Order on Family Separation:
Why keeping families together in immigration detention might not be much of a solution: The government tried this in 2014. It was a disaster. https://t.co/8VZQEQKr4D

8. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Inspector General should continue to investigate the unscrupulous prosecution of asylum seekers for entry and reentry following a former attempt to avail themselves of humanitarian protection in the U.S.
7. DHS should explore alternatives to detention.
6. DHS should prioritize humanitarian considerations and obligations to ensure access to protection for asylum seekers when considering referral for criminal prosecution.=
5. DHS should coordinate among its components and with HHS and DOJ to identify family separation and facilitate release and reunification. This should include mechanisms to help detained family members locate and connect with loved ones, such as an inter-agency hotline
4. DHS should mandate the hiring of child welfare professionals at the border to supervise the protection of children and families and, in rare instances in which it is warranted, oversee instances of family separation.
3.  DHS should consider the best interests of the child in all processing, custody, and removal and repatriation decisions.
2. DHS and its component agencies should document and trace all family relationships to better understand when family separation occurs and inform strategies to address it.
1. DHS should consider family unity as a primary factor in all charging and detention decisions. DHS agents should receive training and clear guidance on the identification, documentation, processing, and placement decisions for families.

If the Trump administration’s new regulatory proposal goes forward, the United States will likely lose a crucial comparative advantage at attracting foreign nationals who often boost U.S. competitiveness, economic strength, and innovation. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
With most H-4 spouses being female, the ability to work empowers women to contribute their skills to the American economy while ensuring the wellbeing of their families. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
At the same time, evidence shows that immigrant scientists and engineers are more likely to choose a country where immediate family members are welcome. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
This makes any job that includes the ability of family members to work more attractive. In turn, brings the United States in line with other countries that compete to attract workers with similar characteristics. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
Authorizing H-4 spouses to work can have several advantages. When employers seek to attract talented foreign nationals to work for them, their spouses may have careers of their own. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
Other notable countries of origin for H-4 visa recipients are China, Philippines, South Korea, and Mexico. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
Most of these visas have been consistently allocated to family members from India, nearing 118,000 in 2017, which constitutes 86 percent of all H-4 visa recipients in that year. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
Recent data from the U.S. Department of State shows that the number of H-4 visa recipients increased from 47,206 in 1997 to 136,393 in 2017. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
H-4 status is dependent on the status of the primary worker—if the status of the primary worker ends, the status of the H-4 dependent also ends. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
H-4 dependents are spouses and children (under 21 and unmarried) of temporary foreign workers in specialty occupations (H-1B), agriculture (H-2A), non-agriculture occupations (H-2B), and nonimmigrant trainees other than medical or academic. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J
These changes, if implemented, could have distressing effects on many of these workers, their families, and American competitiveness. https://t.co/ulNaClQn4J

"Returning many Liberian DED holders back to Liberia will not only upend their families and communities here in the United States, but Liberia may struggle to absorb returning nationals who have not lived there for decades."
"They own homes, are valued workers, started businesses, have U.S.-born children, and integrated into the fabric of American society."
“Having been in the United States since at least 2002, with many here years longer, Liberian DED holders have made their lives in this country."
Our Policy Director, @roycebmurray, highlights the importance of protecting the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) program:

There are, on average, 35.5 fewer crimes committed per 10,000 people in "sanctuary" counties compared to non-sanctuary counties. https://t.co/JKlmbfU7MS

Immigration enforcement—and the threat of such actions—can negatively impact a child’s long-term health and development. https://t.co/JRHAfNUcEp
"Since the administration won’t protect them, Congress must seize this moment to provide a legislative fix." https://t.co/BINH0nuJh3
"TPS holders have provided their personal information, undergone background checks, and in 18 months will lose their ability to work lawfully and support their families." https://t.co/BINH0nuJh3
"Conditions in El Salvador continue to place people’s lives in grave danger. Who gains when we take away lawful status from hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have lived here, paid taxes, and registered with the government for nearly 20 years?" https://t.co/BINH0nuJh3
“Ending TPS for El Salvador is a tragic decision. It’s devastating for the 200,000 people who have lived and worked here legally for nearly 20 years, as well as their families, their employers, and their communities." https://t.co/BINH0nuJh3
The following is a quote from Royce Bernstein Murray (@roycebmurray), Policy Director of the American Immigration Council, on the Trump administration’s decision to end #TPS for El Salvador. https://t.co/BINH0nuJh3

In addition to the devastating repercussions that children and families are likely to experience, the nation as a whole would suffer. A strong, sustainable society depends on the contributions from TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador. https://t.co/49SDsGrs2T
It would be an unusual act of cruelty to deport these long-standing members of our society—51 percent of Salvadorans have lived in the United States for at least 20 years. https://t.co/49SDsGrs2T
Salvadoran TPS recipients now represent nearly two-thirds of all TPS holders nationwide. https://t.co/49SDsGrs2T
El Salvador was designated for TPS in 2001 by the Bush administration, following a series of devastating earthquakes that displaced over 16 percent of El Salvador’s population. Today, the nation is plagued by ongoing gang and gender-based violence. https://t.co/49SDsGrs2T

“I hope that the United States does not close its doors to those who need protection like me and my children.”
“I pleaded to the officers explaining that we had come to ask for help and apply for asylum and I cannot believe they just laughed at us.”
“I knew I could not return to Honduras, where our lives were in danger.”
“We were very disappointed about what had happened at the bridge and didn’t understand why we were treated like that.”
“One of the immigration officials told my son to tell his mother to get out of there.”
“My son looked at me nervously and pointed to the entrance to the U.S. and the officials laughed when he gestured.”
"One of the officials looked at my son and asked him in a mocking tone ’where are you going, kid?’”
“The immigration officials muttered something to each other and then laughed."
“The officials noticed my son’s disability; he is very small and skinny for his age and has a slight speech impediment.”
“He also said that he was not accepting any more people because the law giving asylum to Central Americans had ended the day before.”
“The immigration official asked me what I was still doing there, and said that the official who deals with asylum was actually not coming.”
“After 2 hours, the same official who had asked for our passports approached us with another official who appeared to be Latino.”
“The U.S. immigration official, the one who deals with those issues, wasn’t there and that we should come back later.”
“One border official asked for our passports and I told them we were from Honduras and had come to ask for asylum.”
“We arrived to the port in January, 2017. We presented ourselves at the border at around 9am. There were 4 U.S. immigration officials.”
“Due to my son’s health problems, the entire trip through Guatemala and Mexico took two months.”
“My oldest son has cerebral palsy and on the journey through Guatemala he had a seizure.”
“I fled Honduras with my sons in November of 2016 to escape the death threats from members of the MS-18.”
Here is the story of Maria, mother of two from Honduras, who was illegally denied asylum by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials:
