@cb0321 I mean, their were definitely aspects that were fishy. But the 911 call log was released by a local Minn politician. I never saw that debunked, but maybe I missed something?
@RoccamSoccam IIRC there's like 700K+ voters in that district. And there's only 74K somalis in the whole state. Not nothing, but doesn't seem to be decisive.
And Speaking of Keith Ellison, I have barely heard his name once in the Justin Fairfax drama. He's still state AG, and there were 911 calls regarding his abuse of women!

@TooOldTooStupid NICE. This reminds me, I've had a SDD-3000 preamp circuit waiting to be housed on my workbench for a while... I should finish that.

@crkmccabe Once again: The Daily Caller did not make fun of her for dancing. They made fun of her for being socialist. This is different and renders my original tweet essentially accurate.
@katherinemiller Sure, but it's more complicated than that obviously. A lot of the perception of him is really reductive if you actually watch the show, even if I understand why certain soundbites cause outrage.
@crkmccabe Oh please. This was done well after the whole fake controversy was started. And making fun of her because she's a socialist is fair game, the false charge that the right is threatened by a woman dancing is wholly different.
If these kinds of populist sentiments are wrong, the way to address them is to have the argument and TC is good for getting this stuff out there. 		I appreciate, say, French and Shapiro critiques. But the reaction from the left has literally been to try and force him off the air.

@ATLNativStepson @ix_sir @RealSarah103 @catoridesagain So it's hard to deny the only reason he's getting in is political activism and I can't imagine it working that way for conservative student thrust into a national political debate.
@ATLNativStepson @ix_sir @RealSarah103 @catoridesagain (I actually do care about gun control?) I do regret the extent this is about Hogg. The issue is mainly the insularity of liberal elites and liberal institutions. Regardless, Hogg isn't bad student -- he's just nowhere near Harvard qualified (1270 SAT).

@StlCardsCards You know I just realized that Lanois produced 'Oh Mercy.' I forgot 'Most of the Time' is on that record and not 'Time Out of Mind' (which Lanois also produced.)
@AFK9 'You got it' from Mystery Girl is actually one of the songs taught by the beginner guitar course Gibson put out a while back, IIRC.

@LMandrakeJr That was the song written by U2. Gotta say I was surprised. Translates to Orbison surprisingly well.
@StlCardsCards Yeah, that was Don Was and no bueno. Dylan put out about 5 clunkers between 85 and the early 90s. (I guess Oh Mercy wasn't bad. Not great either.)

@StlCardsCards Yeah, resurrecting Roy Orbison's career was a specific project of Petty and Lynne. And they succeeded, big time.
After a long career slump, Orbison died with two records in the charts: The Traveling Wilburys and Mystery Girl. The latter, if you haven’t heard it, has songs written by Tom Petty, U2, and Elvis Costello. It’s fantastic. https://t.co/O6lmEZT2Du

Not what I was saying. I was saying that a lot of people who drink/drank too much are sitting in judgment of Kavanaugh and using the fact he drank as a predicate for believing the accusations against him, absent evidence -- when they wouldn't want to be judged similarly. https://t.co/YPcuvhFumz
I don't think that's a fair characterization of what he said. She here and here. Seemed to be saying that w/ lower drinking age, it was easier for teens to get booze and more drank as a result:	https://t.co/iEyodzMXQq	https://t.co/HfQzwlUhFK https://t.co/pw1irSypd2
