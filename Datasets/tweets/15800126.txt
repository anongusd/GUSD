I wish Congress would pay off the debt we owe and concentrate on creating jobs. Let's pass Plan B if would help.
@thehill @E2Wire @Ben_Geman Why would anyone need an assault rifle? It's not even appropriate for deer hunting. Stricter gun laws.
Reading Mother Daughter Book Club Wish You Were Eyre. YA Book. Clever novel. Would like to read the rest of the series.
@cspanwj Maybe educating people about nonviolence instead of accepting violence as a norm is the answer. i.e. TV Show, Video Games.
Watched Morning Joe this morning re: shooting. Agree need to toughen up gun laws and screen people better who own guns.
