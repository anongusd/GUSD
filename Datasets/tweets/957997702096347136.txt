@rook429 @rbottoms @Ange_Amene agreed, but I still think we as a country can do better. and I believe that the majority of Americans actually want better.
@TVega29 @rbottoms @Ange_Amene didn't say it would be easy, nor possible in this political climate. But I also don't think healthcare should be political. And I agree with you. Doesn't mean we shouldn't try or that ultimately there is not an appetite for it. Healthcare is the # 1 issue for a lot of people now
@brassman66 @rbottoms @Ange_Amene Glad to have the ACA over nothing, but still think it is not at all sufficient. This does not mean I won't support incremental change, as I already said before.
@brassman66 @rbottoms @Ange_Amene health care should not be a for profit industry. As long as insurance companies are a part of the equation, it will remain problematic at best. Insurance companies sure as hell are not going to cover everyone unless the government forces them to, which is where the ACA came.
@Ange_Amene I am not a purity candidate. These are my own opinions, but I will still vote for incremental change. I am voting for Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who does not support single payer healthcare. I also canvassed for her as well. I want every person in America to be covered.

@catladycool4 @Ange_Amene Not trying to be callous at all. I am just stating facts.
@catladycool4 @Ange_Amene Full disclosure, I am a social worker at a VA Hospital so I do very much know the ins and outs of the system.
@catladycool4 @Ange_Amene I am sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, patients die at all hospitals, not just the VA. The VA also serves a much sicker and more complex population.
@rbottoms @Ange_Amene I definitely didn't say I wouldn't support incremental change, but that is honestly bs in this day and age. Believing everyone should have health care is not a radical thought and shouldn't be treated as such. Let's join the rest of the developed world for Christ sake.
