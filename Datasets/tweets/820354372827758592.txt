Enabled by Republicans and parts of the media, Trump built his entire political brand around the charge that the first African American President was born in Africa and therefore illegitimate. Can. We. Stop. Debating. Whether. He. Has. Done. Anything. Racist.

4/4 This mindset leads to repeated mistakes and the removal of any nuance from hugely impactful policy debates. For more, here is what @ChrisMurphyCT wrote about VZ recently: https://t.co/rkFAhvWAFA
3/4 The political-media consensus that Dems should have no daylight with Trump on Venezuela adds to a tradition: it is seen as politically damaging to oppose U.S.-imposed or supported regime change, despite the results of those efforts (which often get worse after regime change)
2/4 It doesn't help that Trump is obviously disingenuous. He embraces dictators around the world while talking up democracy in Venezuela and Cuba. And he unsubtly - in his SOTU and in Miami - views Venezuela as a domestic political issue tied to his 2020 reelection campaign.
1/4 It is possible to think that a) Venezuelans would be much better off without Maduro, and b) Trump's policy (and bluster) is creating the impression of U.S.-imposed regime change which raises lots of risks, including military intervention (which the opposition could call for) https://t.co/0yB6jLBeKT

9) Thus far the crises of the Trump years have been largely of his own making. Over the next two years, reality could intrude, whether it's in the form of an economic downturn at home or a crisis abroad, likely brought about in part from the decisions he has already made.
8) Remember that unlike Obama - who inherited the Great Recession and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - Trump was handed years of GDP and job growth, and far fewer troops in harm's way. He is in no way prepared to govern in a crisis, foreign or domestic.
7) The dysfunctional White House - often treated as a source of amusement - would be a further obstacle to rational decision-making.
6) He will also try to blame Democrats in Congress, even though his own totally partisan and counter-productive tax bill will be the reason that Congress will have limited capacity to do anything substantial.
5) His attacks on the Fed suggest his strategy will be to blame others for any economic downturn, starting with the Fed
4) Trump's own trade war with China, which he seems to have little idea how to end, is increasing the pressure on the global economy, roiling markets, risking inflation, and adding new uncertainties
3) Interest rates, while rising, remain low which limit the Fed's capacity to do much through rate cuts.
2) Because of his tax bill, which amounted to a huge give away to corporations and the wealthy, there are already run-away deficits and there is almost no capacity for more stimulus from Congress.
1) After inheriting a strong economy from Obama, Trump is in now way prepared for a recession, and the steps he has already taken will make it almost impossible to respond. https://t.co/fkepKCVtLk

8) The most shocking story in American politics these last two years is not Trump, it is the total acquiescence of the Republican Party to lies, corruption, and authoritarianism. Funded, of course, by unchecked dark money facilitated by the Citizens United decision.
7) And yet Republicans flipped out in faux, sanctimonious outrage over Obama's comment on Citizens United. Faced with Trump's relentless effort to do away with independent rule of law in our country, they enable him through silence and applause and recycled attacks on Obama
6) Trump through his words and deeds clearly has zero respect for the rule of law and wants to get rid of the independence of the judiciary in the United States so he can have a system more like his friends in Saudi Arabia and Russia.
5) He also reportedly wanted to prosecute his political enemies and has relentlessly tried to undermine - if not end - the independent investigation into Russia's interference in our elections.
4) Meanwhile Trump blustered about the 9th circuit and "Obama judges" and vaguely threatened that he wasn't going to let the 9th circuit decide cases anymore at the same time he has unconstitutionally put an unconfirmed and unqualified lackey in charge of the Justice Department
3) That holds up well. It's actually been worse than Obama warned in some ways.
2) I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people."

The complete capitulation to Putin and abandonment of our values, the separation of children from their families, a reckless tax give-away to the wealthiest, and a constant assault on the truth - these are the defining events and characteristics of this catastrophic presidency.

13. All of these risks for no reason, based on no understanding of the Deal, simply because Barack Obama was involved in negotiating it.
12. Finally, at home he has turned the gravest national security issues into a political reality show, poisoning the discourse on serious issues
11. China will continue its subtle but effective global effort to cast the U.S. as unreliable, pressing its alternative view of global arrangements that suit its interests
10. Trump's potential efforts to enforce secondary sanctions could face stiff resistance from Europe and Asia, more broadly undermining the efficacy of sanctions as a tool of U.S. policy and potentially the role of the dollar as the reserve currency
9. The U.S. role at the center of the international order - especially our leadership of the nuclear non-proliferation regime - is set back given that the JCPOA was anchored in our commitment to the NPT
8. Together with TPP and Paris, Trump's action also severely undermines the credibility of the United States to uphold international agreements that we sign which will endure after he is gone
7. In North Korea, it's hard to see Trump achieving a deal as good as the JCPOA (which he calls a disaster), and he just also alienated China and Russia who will be important to our North Korea diplomacy
6. Outside of Iran, Trump just initiated a crisis with our European allies that at a minimum makes it harder to cooperate to confront Iranian behavior. Beyond that, could be a widening rift in the relationship that infects other issues and undermines our closest partnership
5. Inside of Iran, Trump just gave hardliners an opening to strengthen their position in ways that could negatively shape the succession process when Iran's aging Supreme Leader dies
4. Given how much Iran took advantage of the catastrophic decision to invade Iraq, any conflict with the U.S. could threaten our interests in Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and beyond
3. The U.S. could then be faced with the choice of accepting a de facto Iranian nuclear capability or going to war to stop it.
2. To begin with, without the constraints in the JCPOA, Iran's nuclear program could once again approach the point where they have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Scenarios that deal opponents warned about 10-15 years from now would come much quicker.
1. Trump's decision just made the world a more dangerous place in ways that begin with Iran's nuclear program but go far beyond it.

Trump hasn't articulated goals in Syria - he cuts support for opposition, humanitarian aid, refugees, and says he wants out of Syria militarily. What would be the goal of a strike? What is the broader strategy?

8/10) S Korea could move closer to China if public opinion turns against alliance
7/10) Also risk that Japan and S Korea will want their own nuclear arsenal if they doubt US commitment
6/10) Danger is that US and allies aren’t all on the same page - which has been a tactical goal of N Korea in the past
5/10) Trump’s bluster toward N Korea does not feel coordinated with allies who have most at stake
4/10) Graham quoting Trump “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there” plays into fears that we don’t value allied casualties
3/10) Attacking S Korea on twitter the worst possible response to the latest NK test
2/10) Withdrawing from US-S Korea free trade agreement would call US assurances into question when S Korea needs to count on them
1/10) Trump risks serious strains on US alliances with Japan and S Korea that will make it harder to deal with NK threats
