@AllenJo40666383 @EdKrassen Keep in mind it's not just the hats, but the rhetoric as well.  It's Trump who said "Immigrants are animals."  MAGA is an intentional racist slogan also used by the Klan and the Nazis. Anyway ...
@AllenJo40666383 @EdKrassen Yeah I agree with the Nazi comparison. Like Nazi paraphernalia, MAGA hats are equally ostracized. But it’s the ideology behind them that is wrong. I see the kids in the video more as victims. The hatred is learned and can be unlearned.
@AllenJo40666383 @EdKrassen Dude come on. he’s wearing a Maga hat. It’s not a good look. Google Maga shooters, it’s a problem, it’s a pattern, and it stems from the core racist ideologies of Donald Trump.
@AllenJo40666383 @EdKrassen It’s hard to pinpoint, I mean right from the start there was hate involved, but when people wearing MAGA hats started to kill people, such as in Parkland,  We were definitely passed the point of no return.
