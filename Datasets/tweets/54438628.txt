@FatsFats1 It would still meet the Art II requirements. The SOTU was written instead of speech until the 20th century. But yes, we know the state of our Union... :(
@BradCrofford Oh, I would imagine.
@FatsFats1 All this to say, POTUS can deliver a Constitutionally required SOTU to Congress in any manner or format he so chooses.
@FatsFats1 And to fulfill his constitutional duty, POTUS doesn't need to address a joint Session of Congress.
@FatsFats1 Nothing in the Constitution states how, when, or where the State of the Union needs to be delivered. It wasn't a formal speech to both Chambers of Commerce until Woodrow Wilson. It takes a resolution from both chambers for a joint session of Congress.
@JC_Cali He can do that. The Constitution only states that POTUS update Congress from time to time on the State of the Union. Doesn't say how often, or where, or how.  So, yes he can do it. No it has not been done before. But for some time presidents wrote to Congress as their SOTU.
Will Mitch McConnell invite POTUS to deliver the State of the Union in the Senate?
Wow, Rep. Steny Hoyer (House Maj. Leader) just confirmed that the State of the Union has been called off. The Speaker invites POTUS.
