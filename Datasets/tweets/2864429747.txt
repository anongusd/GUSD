@ChrisMurphyCT @RepHankJohnson @JudiciaryGOP Yet their remarks only underscore the need for a more robust code, which, when enacted, should cause the justices to think twice before saying or doing something that would impugn their institution’s integrity or their own impartiality.

@ChrisMurphyCT @RepHankJohnson @JudiciaryGOP Here's the thinking behind it: req'g JCUS, over which CJ Roberts presides, to write code for all judges mitigates const concerns &amp; potential carve-out for justices (“provisions…applicable only to certain categories”) says there may be some area that should not apply to #SCOTUS
@ChrisMurphyCT @RepHankJohnson @JudiciaryGOP Here's the bill text: “The Judicial Conference shall issue a code of conduct, which applies to each justice &amp; judge [including #SCOTUS] of the U.S., except that the code of conduct may include provisions that are applicable only to certain categories of judges or justices."

.@sarahturbo79 responds by saying due to examples like this (&amp; Kav/RBG examples she mentioned earlier), "We are no longer able to give #SCOTUS the benefit of the doubt" on ethics 🔥🔥🔥
After several rounds of Qs on voting, @RepHankJohnson is up &amp; talks about Justice Scalia's final trip, which featured several ethics issues:	- Who paid for the trip?	- Who else was there (i.e., anyone with cases before #SCOTUS)?	- Does this harm the integrity of the judiciary?

Also mentions several laws, akin to #HR1, that Congress has passed that apply to #SCOTUS:	- Recusal law in 28 USC 455	- Financial disclosure law in post-Watergate Ethics in Gov't Act	- The number of justices that sit on #SCOTUS	- Some of #SCOTUS's jurisdiction
.@sarahturbo79 mentions how Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges &amp; Judicial Conduct &amp; Disability Act of 1980 apply to lower court judges *but not #SCOTUS*, adds that the #HR1 provision would be kosher bc JCUS is asking to create code &amp; Chief Justice presides over JCUS

Now onto #SCOTUS ethics! The part we've been waiting for, w/ @sarahturbo79 of @ConPro.		She begins: "By extending a code of ethics to #SCOTUS for 1st time, #HR1 seeks to balance the need to enhance the public’s faith in judiciary w/ imperative to safeguard separation of powers."
First 2 witnesses, @vanitaguptaCR &amp; @Sifill_LDF, talk about voter suppression efforts in recent elections. (FTC doesn't take a position on the whole bill, just the #SCOTUS ethics section, since staying in one's lane is 🧠 for NFPs like ours.)
Next up: RM @RepDougCollins, who does not mention the #SCOTUS ethics in his statement, focusing instead on voting rights, but does close with, "I look forward to working on areas of the bill we agree with" #HR1
.@RepJerryNadler kicks off #HR1 hearing, nothing that the bill "includes provision that passed [House Judiciary] last year on a bipartisan basis to require development of a judicial code of ethics that would apply to all federal judges, including justices of the Supreme Court"

After Watergate, several pro-accountability reforms for all 3 branches were codified.		In the coming years, the US will have another opp’y to recommit to openness &amp; honesty.		We’re here to say: due its cont’d reluctance to modernize, #SCOTUS should be part of that conversation.

In the 1st arg., Justice Ginsburg quoted Gilbert and Sullivan.		In the 2nd arg., Justice Alito quoted Sherlock Holmes.		Even if you aren’t a lawyer, or aren’t versed in civil procedure, the arguments lend themselves to being experienced by more than the 200-300 people allowed in.
2nd arg., about jurisdictional issues on Native American lands, featured a testy exchange between Justice Kagan &amp; Lisa Blatt, the latter, you may recall, irked libs when she supported Kavanaugh for #SCOTUS (Kav stayed out of said exchange)
1st arg., on motion deadlines &amp; tolling &amp; the hypothetical Martian invasion (yes, you read that right), looks like it could yield a 9th Circuit reversal, which would please you-know-who
The cases are submitted!		Highlights included:	- Sitting behind @SenatorLankford &amp; @JimInhofe during 1st argument before they were moved up front for 2nd	- Sitting behind plainclothes possible member of #SCOTUS Police (yes, they do this sort of thing https://t.co/eLTbV77VII)

That's the full Roberts statement, or what we can gather from not having a #SCOTUS hard pass. 		Pretty amazing it's exactly 280 characters.

Holy Toledo! @OHSupremeCourt says J. @patdewine need not recuse from OH AG cases (his dad is AG) but DOES say it'd "be instructive in future...to file [paper] provid[ing] reasons for denying the request.” Cf. Scalia in Cheney v. U.S.D.C. District of Columbia. Let the sunshine in!
@smmarotta With higher % of &gt;30-year-old clerks with each passing year, meaning higher likelihood of previous work impacting conflicts, why not?		Our bill (HR 6755) would do that for justices so can’t hurt to include clerks. Would take 0.02 seconds per recusal &amp; increase trust in 3rd branch

This ranking was co-done by the firm where CJ Roberts’ wife works, and the CJ is only 13th?? https://t.co/8EiOhkJ3Lp
RT @PipelineParity: Serena Walker, @YaleLawSch 1L, advocates for a climate survey that provides baseline aggregate data.
"An open window for reporting" misconduct is "very important," says @chandini_jha, emphasizing the risk of retaliation shouldn't factor into clerk's decision whether to come forward. Also calls for more comprehensive reporting mechanisms &amp; more robust Office of Judicial Integrity

CJ Roberts has often moved misconduct complaints away from home circuit - e.g., Kozinski 2017 complaints moved to CA2 &amp; Kavanaugh 2018 complaints moved to CA10.		The idea that complainants could themselves request a move is smart &amp; should be adopted via amendment to the JCDA
Also says a 3-judge panel is smarter for initial adjudication than going just to chief judge b/c what if chief judge is Kozinski? (Not really a hypo since he was chief judge 2007-14)		And - we may steal this - they want complainants to have the ability to file for change of venue
Now on to @YaleLawSch students (link is here if you've lost it in the thread https://t.co/QN8k0y8pHF). Begins w/ concern that "rigidity disincentives judicial employees" from coming forward w/ complaints, citing the fact that ZERO instances of misconduct were reported in 2016
Next witness is whistleblower Cyrus Sanai, who states, "As long as there is no incentive for judges to be held to account for refusing to discipline [their peers], no matter how good the rules look in abstract, history tells us they're never going to be enforced properly." Boom.
We'd like to point out the following:		Several Judicial Conference committees are being represented at today's hearing: Court Administration &amp; Case Management, Codes of Conduct and Judicial Conduct &amp; Disability.		Yet a list of their membership is nowhere to be found online. Why?
Up now is Judge Julie Robinson (D. Kan.) of the Judiciary Working Group. Says she won't speak to proposed language changes to the Codes or the JC&amp;D rules.		(Wait, what? That statements implies that the JWG was not involved in these proposals, which would be a shame &amp; news to us.)
Concludes with discussion of Judge Kopf's online harassment of @ClerksForChange https://t.co/Oe8vy0wFPY
Q from judge: should discipline be imposed after resignation? @Jaime_ASantos says yes, as just bc someone has left bench voluntarily doesn't mean an investigation against such actions should automatically end, esp w/ retired judges using their name to get post-judicial employment
Turner on formal v. informal reporting (is pro the former) "We don't think [misconduct complaints] should be handled quietly without some reporting of the incident. Judge O'Neill handled [his example wrt a judge with dementia] wonderfully, but that won't always be the case."
Continues with point that JC&amp;D process is often biased, as it's unclear when judges on local judicial councils should recuse from the process. 		Better yet, she adds: investigations into misconduct should automatically be conducted outside the circuit in which they arise
Quote of the day comes from @Jaime_ASantos of @ClerksForChange: "Judges are very smart, but you are not trained investigators."
This is a problem, and we're working to fix this. https://t.co/gu63soLRgf

Turner notes it's confusing for what happens when chief judge is subject of complaint (Kozinski was CA9 CJ 07-14).		Also re complaints being made public, if there are (rare) reasons complaints can't be made public, @uscourts should at least release general data, e.g., region/type
Representing @ClerksForChange are Kendall Turner &amp; @Jaime_ASantos.		Turner begins by thanking committee for taking the need for change seriously &amp; moves in to recommendations for improvements to the Code of Conduct
Up now: @ClerksForChange. Turn up your @YouTube, folks https://t.co/QN8k0y8pHF
Prof. Needham's main takeaway: the Codes must be clearer language-wise (i.e., "shall," not "should") to signal that these provisions are actionable, not just aspirational
RT @PipelineParity: Judge Sarah Evans Barker responds to Professor Knake from @UHLAW: “I am sorry that we lost you.” #pipelineparity
Next is Prof. Carol Needham of @SLULAW (go Billikens!). She has wide experience in law: clerk, white shoe partner, law prof &amp; writing for @ABAesq to boot. "Overall, I support these changes [...] but there are some places" where provisions should be further amended:
Future chair of @senjudiciary unclear on 14th Amendment: https://t.co/LoGCfG8bYg
Committee debates annual survey of clerks vs. exit interviews with clerks to give qualitative data on what's occurring in chambers.		Both/and?
RT @ZoeTillman: Knake's reccs:	- Prohibit consensual romantic relationships between judges and clerks/employees (a la law school policies)…
Prof. Newman Knake proposes 2 different tracks for adjudicating judicial misconduct complaints: 1 track for harassment complaints, 1 for civility / other types of non-harassment complaints
Wants committee to consider Code amendment that would ban consensual sexual relationships b/w clerks &amp; judges, given uneven power dynamic; says such a prohibition exists in academia already b/w students &amp; profs
We're back! Up now: Prof. Renee Newman Knake of @UHLAW, a legal ethicist. 2 things stand out: 	1. She discussed proposed changes to Codes w/ her students, who were shocked to learn they weren't already in there 	2. She was warned about Kozinski when applying for clerkship in 1998
Smooth jazz break! https://t.co/QN8k0y8pHF
In addition to press, FTC reached out to congressional staff about attending today; unclear if any are in room/watching live.		Recall that 20/21 members of @senjudiciary are NOT in close races or in races at all. The @HouseJudiciary is undergoing makeover (~12 retirements) so 🤷‍♂️
Adds that "more transparency is required when allegations have become subject of public reports," which makes sense theoretically, but does that imply that I'affair Kozinski should not have been made public had former clerks not blogged or spoken to @washingtonpost?
Hellman helped write 1980 Jud. Conduct &amp; Disability Act, notes "very little consideration was given" to what public thought about this law.		Says "now that all institutions, including courts, must struggle to maintain public trust," the public shld pay attention &amp; shld have a say
Up next is Prof. Hellman of @PittLaw. So that makes 5 (!) male presenters at the start of the @uscourts hearing (would've been 6 but Russ Wheeler of @BrookingsInst can't make it): 2 JCUS committee chairs, 1 CAED judge &amp; 2 ethics profs.		Do better.
Concludes by saying that Kozinski affair exposed the gaps in judicial misconduct protocols &amp; as a country we need to do more to restore faith in the judiciary
On to suggestions. Says new req't where judges who hear complaints in confidence must "run it up chain" will have chilling effect &amp; make it less likely complaints are brought fwd.		Interesting pt BUT just bc 1 judge is OK at handling complaints w/o protocol doesn't mean all are
2nd witness is Prof. Geyh of @IUMaurerLaw, a top legal ethicist. Begins by explaining parallels b/w new @uscourts proposals &amp; @ABAesq rules on harassment (https://t.co/uyZGH9Rr4l)
Yeah, no.		That's not going to cut it.
@ZoeTillman And CA9 has program to help judges age gracefully (https://t.co/yBLPpEPtBS 2nd column). 		And sure, judges should help one another decide when they should retire. The CA9 program even has a buddy system!		But there should be a more formalized rules when harassment occurs, period.
O'Neill is telling this story, &amp; another related one, to say he believes that judges should have "discretion at the local level" to handle complaints informally "unless Chief Judge says [s/he] can't handle it" or "if person complaining says 'I want to go to the next level'"
First up is Chief Juge O'Neill (E.D. Calif.). He recounts a harrowing story where a law clerk approached him about a fellow judge making a lewd comment.		Turned out the judge had been in early stages of dementia; O'Neill approached him about it &amp; he then retired, died 2 yrs later
Scirica cites Chief Justice Roberts' end-of-year report, which addressed the 2017 Kozinski matter. 		Fix the Court convened a dozen top law profs &amp; former law clerks to write Roberts soon after Kozinski news, requesting he discuss matter in report https://t.co/NRdTdQcm0a
Judge Erickson (CA8), chair of Codes of Conduct Cmte, opens hearing, is followed by Judge Scirica (CA3), chair of Judicial Conduct &amp; Disability Cmte.		Scirica took senior status in 2013, is one of longest serving cmte chairs &amp; heard 2008 Kozinski complaint https://t.co/PoZFr5tJpY

Welcome to our side (albeit with a 33% term reduction), @ezraklein! https://t.co/dywldBh6Yl
#SCOTUS has released same-day audio 27 times since 2000, so we know they can do it.		They can even livestream from the courtroom, as they did for Scalia's Bar memorial (https://t.co/H32kGsjBnW).		And 3/4 of America thinks live audio should occur. What are they waiting for? (5/5)
If you'd like more, our recusal line - Info@FixTheCourt.com - is always open.		Finally, we're still waiting for CJ Roberts to respond to the letter we worked on with @ChuckGrassley &amp; @SenatorLeahy requesting same-day audio for all OT18 cases https://t.co/Q18Qub2O4n (4/x)

This is what happens when you have non-#SCOTUS types write your tipsheet with #SCOTUS news: mistakes are made. (The answer, @politico, is no, he wouldn't have to recuse from any of these cases, save if a Clinton, a Foster or a Starr was a named litigant.) https://t.co/ucTgaIq8wF

3rd, documents should not be withheld because one side says they should be withheld. As we now know, there were relevant e-mails in Kagan's SG file &amp; there are relevant memos in Kavanaugh's staff secretary file. The public should see them before senators vote (3/5)

These are all DOJ-Office of Legal Counsel docs.		Our lawsuit for DOJ-Office of Legal Policy docs may yield files as soon as this Friday.		Though our 3rd #FOIA suit is mostly done, we still have some questions for NARA, eg, did you withhold 52% of your Kav files like DOJ-OLC did?
We just received the 5th &amp; final batch of Kavanaugh docs pursuant to our #FOIA suit w DOJ https://t.co/CT00Za9OoG.		That makes 1,743 pgs in total: 52% withheld in full, 48% released but heavily redacted.		Of the pages that were released, 2/3 are WHCO &amp; 1/3 are staff sec. files
The cost to receive Judge Eid files from @ColoLaw was quoted to us as &gt;$1,500 for search &amp; replication fees, &amp; the cost to receive Judge Grant files from Georgia gov't was quoted to us as $&gt;6,900 for the same, so in June we hit pause on pursuing those (2/2)
Since you were wondering about #FOIAs, Judges Barrett &amp; Sykes didn't work in public sector before becoming judges. 		Judge Ryan was a JAG 1995-99 but no #FOIA has been sent.		Judge Larsen worked at DOJ &amp; @UMichLaw. We asked for her files in Jan. 2017 &amp; have received nothing (1/2)
Link to Friday's docs: https://t.co/yQVLmGRIcL		To review, DOJ-OLC has ~1,800 pgs of Kavanaugh docs. So far, they've reviewed 1,608 pgs: 56% (899 pgs) have been WITHHELD; 44% (709 pgs) have been heavily redacted.		Of the 709 pgs that are out, 35% are from staff sec.; 65% are WHCO
Late Friday we received more DOJ docs from our #FOIA lawsuit (mostly redacted WH TPs justifying warrantless wiretapping).

@AndyMcCanse Yes, the phasing in of judges was something we've been working with members in both parties on, as it's a rational compromise that accepts the Judicial Conference's recommendations (https://t.co/Prac1Ovxlk) while not throwing out all the proposals on transparency / accountability
THE AYES HAVE IT! Bill reported out of @HouseJudiciary	✅ Same-day audio in #SCOTUS in 1 yr	✅ Live audio in #SCOTUS in 2 yrs	✅ Video in circuit crts in 2 yars	✅ Recusal explanations	✅ New #SCOTUS ethics code	✅ 52 new judges added add post-1/22/21 (prvsly: added upon passage)
Now @RepJerryNadler is on board with the @RepRaskin amendment for the bill to take effect 1/22/21, urging a "yes" vote on the whole bill
We're back! @repraskin offers a slightly altered amendment, whereby bill would take effect 1/22/21 (earlier amendment was 1/21/21). This amendment is agreed to - must've been some behind-the-scenes convos during cmte recess to get Rs on board, or there's still more to come on it
Senate Dems did manage to ask Judge Kavanaugh several Fix the Court questions among the 1,278 they submitted. 		Here's our favorite (https://t.co/6qzBjBuqkt, p. 188): https://t.co/Q3S01yTHTI
If there weren't enough things going on today (Kavanaugh QFR out, Kavanaugh vote postponed, HJC courts bill markup), the Judicial Conference had its semiannual meeting today.		If there's an any intel to be gotten, we'll post it here.
.@RepRaskin has an amendment that would make the effective date January 21, 2021, says that he's asking for that bc Chief Judge Garland didn't get a hearing or a vote during an election year
.@RepJerryNadler: Wants to postpone the consideration of the bill until 11/14/18 due to the lack of hearing on it, the lack of consultation with the Judicial Conference &amp; fact that it's happening while many members are out
.@RepJerryNadler: "Many of the bill's transparency measures would gain wide bipartisan support," suggests that they be taken out &amp; put into a separate bill
.@RepJerryNadler: "Nearly every single one of Trump's nominees has been male &amp; white. [...] Given the current administration that is seeking to pack the federal courts, a more reasonable approach would be to delay implementation" of the new judgeships
.@RepJerryNadler is up next, focusing on the 52 new judgeships that are also in the bill: "Trump is packing the court with extremist judges &amp; outsourcing the process to @fedsoc &amp; @Heritage." [My stars!] 		FTC has asked that the judgeships be phased in over 3 to 7 years
In terms of a #SCOTUS ethics code, @goodlatte says, "If you determine a set of ethics, it should not be voluntary [as it currently is]; you should become committed to it."
.@RepGoodlatte: "This bill would let the American people see &amp; hear all appellate arguments." Then cites the popularity of livestreamed Ninth Circuit hearing in Trump v. Hawaii last year
.@RepGoodlatte, who is a cosponsor with @DarrellIssa of the bill: "This is clearly an ambitious court reform [bill], but it's the will of the American people."

For those keeping score at home, the fixes below, plus live audio at #SCOTUS, have been inserted into bills drafted in the last few weeks by @DarrellIssa &amp; @SenWarren, so the idea that nothing in D.C. is bipartisan these days is not accurate https://t.co/3uv8OeoXhe
A modest proposal:		Listen to the Judicial Conf. on judges. But phase them in over several years. 		And continue to support pro-transparency fixes to 3rd branch.		(Here's how to ensure judgeships have bipartisan support, via nominating commission https://t.co/0Bh4tGzNRE?) (6/6)
These pro-transparency "fixes" are in 2nd half of bill. What's in 1st half? The aforementioned judges.		In fraught political times, hard to imagine Ds agreeing to add 52 district j's now, even if large no. of Trump's district j's have been bipartisan choices w/ few no votes (5/6)
The bill would also require:	✅ All Article III judges - including #SCOTUS justices - to get periodic medical exams to ensure continued cognitive function	✅ The results of the exams would remain confidential, of course (4/6)
In terms of pro-accountability fixes, the bill would require:	✅ The creation of a code of conduct that all Article III judges - including #SCOTUS justices - would follow	✅ Justices to explain, via online notice, the reasoning behind their periodic recusals (3/6)
In terms of pro-transparency fixes, the bill would require:	✅ Same-day audio at #SCOTUS within 1 year	✅ Live audio at #SCOTUS within 2 years	✅ Live video in appeals courts within 2 years (2/6)
Yesterday @HouseJudiciary introduced a bill to fix (double entendre!) federal courts https://t.co/EvJy7eC4Ku.		It would add 52 judgeships that @uscourts has wanted for years https://t.co/Prac1OdWtM.		It would also make 3rd branch more open &amp; accountable. 		Let's take a look (1/6)

The prime mover of this mess, though, is the hiding of documents. 		There have been weeks of opportunity for a larger % of Kavanaugh’s record to come out; still &lt;10% has been released.		Once again, the coverup looks worse than the crime (no crime here but you get the idiom) (2/2)

This is all we have from the documents since it's likely Bill Burck is hiding the rest.		But remember: we're all like Kavanaugh - sometimes at a new job, you're required to do OPPOSITE of what got you the job in the first place!
And this: 		Two more suits against President Bush, which allege that Bush was caught up in some conspiracy to hide military technology from who the hell knows but it was frivolous &amp; hard to follow https://t.co/SfJn46cPGv
For years, all Kavanaugh was doing was trying to pin a crime on President Clinton. 		Then, when he joined the White House, he had to deal with things like this - a handwritten, pro se lawsuit against the president: https://t.co/aIjNBkDhnR
For Judge Kavanaugh, JOB A was associate counsel in the Office of Independent Counsel &amp; ACT A was investigating/charging the president.		JOB B was associate counsel in the White House &amp; ACT B was defending the president from criminal/civil liability.
Sometimes you're asked to do something, let's call it ACT B, at your job, let's call it JOB B, that sucks - something that you didn't have to do when you were at JOB A five years prior. 		In fact, when at JOB A, you did the opposite of ACT B, which we'll call ACT A (stay with us)

Or there'll be a Carpenter II next term, &amp; SG Francisco will use a theory he &amp; Kavanaugh developed when working together on warrantless wiretapping during the Bush admin - which we'll only learn about when all of the Kavanaugh papers come out in 2021
From watching the hearings, reading thousands of docs (&amp; trying to obtain more), you just know that history is going to repeat itself &amp; a Justice Kavanaugh will sit on, say, an affirmative action case from Michigan but then - oops - he'll remember he worked on the Grutter brief
In OT16 and OT17 Kagan TWICE forgot to recuse in Jennings v Rodriguez due to her previous work on the case. And in OT17 Kennedy forgot to recuse in Washington v US despite his previous work on the case (that's forgivable since his "previous work" was from 1985)
Also in OT15 Breyer forgot to recuse in FERC v EPSA due to his stock in Johnson Controls, a party on the EPSA side. In OT16 Roberts forgot to recuse in Life Technologies v Promega due to his ownership of stock in Thermo Fisher Scientific, which owns Life Technologies
More recently, in OT08, Alito forgot to recuse in FCC v Fox despite his son’s stock in Disney, a party on the Fox side. In OT15 Roberts forgot to recuse in ABB Inc v Arizona Board of Regents, due to his stock in Texas Instruments stock, a party on the ABB side.
Ginsburg forgot to recuse in the mid-90s due to her husband's stocks. Kennedy forgot to recuse in the mid-90s related to his going on Westlaw junkets. Oh and Thomas for years forgot to put his wife's salary on his financial disclosure report.
Given how many ppl are working on this, they couldn't find anyone to go through the missing recusals &amp; figure out reasons?		Since #SCOTUS is already SO GOOD at forgetting to recuse despite statutory conflicts, putting another forgetful recusal-er on bench will have consequences
And there's Klay v Panetta, on sexual assault in Navy/Marine Corps. He worked on all these cases while in the Bush White House. 		While at Kirkland, he worked for Big Tobacco in US v Philip Morris, where court held cigarette companies conspired to deceive ppl about health effects
Let's start by looking at cases where he does recall why he recused. There's CREW v Office of Admin., on the millions of lost WH e-mails, i.e., the parody that writes itself. There's Jud. Cmte. v Miers, on the firing of U.S. attorneys. There's Wilson v Libby on the Plame affair.
A thread on recusals, which got all of 2 minutes of chatter the last 3 days: 		Judge Kavanaugh listed 136 times he recused from a D.C. Circuit case in his @senjudiciary questionnaire (https://t.co/lB6BWu4Dhw). He couldn't recall the reason for 90 of them. 90 of them! That's nuts.
This is SO frustrating &amp; true but since there’s a case soon going to #SCOTUS on this (given the circuit split), Kav had to pull back. It sucks for sure bc this should be obvious, but one also must hope a Kennedy acolyte would continue in tradition of AMK’s jurisprudence on this https://t.co/UE0wMpyfbY

Kavanaugh: I've seen the benefits of live audio &amp; I'll keep an open mind on cameras
Kavanaugh: "I do agree with you that when you see the justices in action it is inspiring, [with justices] not sitting on different sides of an aisle or caucuses but as one group."
Kavanaugh responds: "I'm positive of the future of the judiciary. [...] I hope the people watching understand that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel" of American democracy
.@JohnCornyn: "Not everyone can go across the street get a seat. I think they would be awed. I think they would be impressed."		Adds that he's confident #SCOTUS could control potential outbursts better than @senjudiciary can
.@JohnCornyn: Cameras afford the "great opportunity for people to see their government in action," applauds live audio in D.C. Circuit

@ishapiro Apples &amp; oranges, Ilya, unless Kagan or Alito wants to run for president. (That'd be a sick ticket.)		Live audio or cameras for op. releases - both of which Kavanaugh supports - wld be a fair intermediate step &amp; would show #SCOTUS is more measured than most @senjudiciary members!
Finally, we know that Kavanaugh did more than just "pass along paper" while staff secretary. He engaged, he edited, he brokered. It's unfortunate that 99% of the documents from his time as staff secretary won't see the light of day until 1/20/21 at the earliest https://t.co/QBZCw00IM8
Our recourse is to request a Vaughn Index that gives a few-word summary of all the documents that have been withheld.		We did that with Gorsuch when DOJ withheld e-mails in a Feb. 2017 suit. When did we get the Vaughn Index? Sept. 2017, or 4 mos. after Gorsuch was sworn in
We had to sue the Department of Justice with @weareoversight to obtain the e-mails Kavanaugh just referred to from the Office of Legal Counsel on torture. 		Guess what: despite the suit, those e-mails have been either almost fully redacted or withheld in full
Here are the current justices (plus Scalia &amp; Kennedy) during their confirmation hearing on cameras in the courtroom https://t.co/pVlxWAP4eb
He supports live audio at #SCOTUS. Sad that he didn't say it just now https://t.co/W217tRFxHp
Kavanaugh adds that oral argument is "extraordinarily impressive &amp; makes you confident in the rule of law"
Kavanaugh says he wants to listen to the other justices on what they think about cameras in the courtroom &amp; wants to consider cameras for opinion announcements, as it's "a distinct issue from oral arguments"
Kavanaugh notes that the D.C. Circuit now allows live audio &amp; judges are "comfortable" with this reform
Grassley asks if Kavanaugh would "keep an open mind on cameras in the courtroom." His response: "I appreciate your longstanding leadership on transparency in the courtroom."
HERE COMES THE CAMERAS QUESTION #KAVANAUGH
We have our first "you'll rue the day." Thank you @SenThomTillis!		Now he talks about #FOIA for Article I...which does not exist.
@Dsquared75 12 years after the end of the administration in which he worked, so 1/20/21 at the earliest
@jeffhauser Twelve years after Bush's last day in office
What makes this whole argument so much more frustrating - again, we read the documents - is that Kavanaugh worked with Al Gonzales, Gary Stern at NARA (still there) &amp; Paul Colborn at DOJ (also still there) to keep Reagan's files from the American people LONGER than 12 years
Again @senmikelee makes a fair point. The Presidential Records Act could be rewritten. We may not be having this conversation if the 95th Congress chose 8 years instead of 12 years regarding the confidentiality of presidential documents
There should've been an agreement between the parties on documents like in years past but so much for https://t.co/5IhyyqzxVp
He makes another good point! You can't fight the Presidential Records Act: "...the President shall specify durations, not to exceed 12 years, for which access shall be restricted with respect to information, in a Presidential record..."
@rjr6864 He's not. He just received bad advice on how to answer this softball.
Anonymous is on fire https://t.co/72Q8W2ba9f
.@SenMikeLee makes a good point: why are Dems asking Kavanaugh a question about a document when he can't see the document? Walk the 10 feet and hand it to him, folks - even if it's been marked "committee confidential," which, as of 5 min. ago, has lost any meaning

If Kavanaugh can comment on Brown v. Board (segregation = bad), but can’t comment on Charlottesville (current events = 🤷🏻‍♂️), fear not. 		Based on the passage of time, we’ll get to hear his views on Nazis in 2081, when he’ll still be on the Supreme Court.
Thanks to @cspan for cutting and posting the clip!
Kavanaugh hints he’d like to have cameras for #SCOTUS opinion announcements, praises live audio of oral arguments in his own court https://t.co/QySDfLOVci
.@senjudiciary just gaveled out at 10:08 p.m. ET. The major transparency takeaways: 		Kavanaugh implied that if he were in charge of #SCOTUS broadcast policy, he'd allow cameras for opinion announcements. 		He also noted that live audio works well for his appeals court.
At the point when most everyone has stopped paying attention, several senators are justifying hiding 150,000 pages of the nominee's record by making them "committee confidential." This is in addition to 6.5M other hidden pages. (Can we get our @RelativityHQ deposit back?)

Kavanaugh insinuates that the announcement of #SCOTUS opinions may be a better place to start in terms of opening up the institution more to broadcast
Kavanaugh responds by saying that "same-time" (e.g., "live") audio "has worked for us" on the court of appeals
🚨🚨🚨@SenJohnKennedy asks if "having cameras in the courtroom would help" improve the public confidence in it 🚨🚨🚨
That Kavanaugh's staff secretary files are hidden does him disservice: he was in WH when Voting Rights Act was reauthorized nearly unanimously &amp; signed into law but we have no idea if he worked on it (probably did &amp; was probably coached not to mention anything from '03-'06)

Re @SenBooker's affirm action q's, it's possible Kav worked on govt brief in Grutter v Bollinger (schools "cannot justify the express consideration of race in their admissions policy" https://t.co/3UTcavVInq), but @senjudiciary docs are so heavily cherrypicked, it's hard to tell
Fact check: true. Kavanaugh has also said he wished there were no FedSoc &amp; ACS, &amp; that all interested in the law could sit down to discuss impactful issues w/o predetermined labels https://t.co/zIvbhGQ7Wb
In the documents we received from DOJ via our #FOIA lawsuit (https://t.co/W6nGiB6DaT &amp; https://t.co/ARdusCSzds &amp; https://t.co/KKu26UT3Xu), the same thing happens with conversations cut off, with heavy redactions to boot
There are dozens of examples in the @senjudiciary documents (https://t.co/zKPspFBmiL) where there's an e-mail discussion on a topic of interest - maybe related to the war on terror, maybe related to the judicial nominees Kavanaugh shepherded - &amp; then it cuts off
With all due respect to @MikeCrapo, the reason the docs haven't come up so much is - &amp; this is obvious to anyone who's read them - the small % that's been released have been cherrypicked, yielding little of interest re: Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy or issues he's worked on
No fan of _Chevron_, big fan of Chevron general counsel https://t.co/Ya8wmijYI1
Of course, there need to be clearer avenues for clerks &amp; other staff to report harassment &amp; without fear of retribution. 		But on the judges' side, the clarity of Kavanaugh's response was a positive moment.		Next up: questions on Garza v. Hargan =&gt; @DCCircuitBreak time
And, Kavanaugh added, if he were not pleased with response from those 3, he'd call Chief Justice Roberts directly. 		It's a process to get this right &amp; to eradicate harassment in judiciary once &amp; for all. 		And it's critical this discussion takes center stage at @senjudiciary
Kavanaugh makes his views clear &amp; every judge in America should pay attention: he says that if you see or hear of harassment in your court, you (A) call your chief judge, (B) call the judge you are closest w/ who sits on a relevant Jud Conf Cmte &amp; (C) call Jim Duff at @uscourts

Kav notes the JWG report is "not final step. This is part of a much larger national problem. [...] We need better reporting mechanisms. [...] Victims need to know where to report &amp; that they won't be retaliated against."		This is a critical issue; tx to @senorrinhatch for asking!
IMPORTANT: Kavanaugh distances himself from Kozinski, says "I'm interested in doing everything I can to make workplaces safe."		Adds: "No woman should be subject to sexual harassment, esp in judiciary"; praises Roberts/Garland for setting up national/CADC workplace conduct cmtes

Third, we asked @TheJusticeDept for all Kavanaugh memos to/from its Office of Legal Counsel, which acts as legal adviser to the prez. (You may recall Bush did many things that were hardly legal.)		DOJ delayed, we sued, &amp; as of now, they've released only about ~600 pages (3/5)

Six weeks before the end of #SCOTUS's OT02, when pundits were alternately predicting the retirements of CJ Rehnquist or J O'Connor, @fedsoc set up a war room at @JonesDay to talk through scenarios &amp; invited Kavanaugh https://t.co/o6uOJyB6cP
Fed judges are req'd &amp; #SCOTUS justices are admonished to "avoid appearance of impropriety," https://t.co/F3PmmeJiso, &amp; speaking at Trump Hotel, allowing a #SCOTUS advocate to intro you &amp; demonstrating animus toward a litigant (RBG v DJT) shows how swamptastic all 3 branches are
Does it matter? Did anyone (besides us) make a stink when @neal_katyal introduced Neil Gorsuch at his 2017 confirmation hearing &amp; then argued Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates on Gorsuch's first argument day as a justice? https://t.co/KdK4Z3bEPm
In looking how to craft the Bush administration's response to Lawrence v. Texas, which made same-sex sexual activity legal, Brett Kavanaugh looked to President Clinton's 1996 Defense of Marriage Act signing statement #SCOTUS https://t.co/7RdY33obQv
In 2002 @RyanLizza wrote that WHCO, where Kavanaugh was working, "advised Bush not to grant POW status to prisoners at Gitmo [&amp;] led multifront campaign to expand authority of the executive branch &amp; insulate the administration from records requests." Sound familiar? #AskKavanaugh
For those who read Linda Greenhouse's most recent op-ed in @nytopinion on Guantanamo, or saw it Thurs. in our @SCOTUSDaily, recall that Kavanaugh not only participated in Gitmo cases on CADC, the WHCO also worked on Gitmo policy, often coordinating w/ DOD https://t.co/Wc5n8Jlyld https://t.co/0f2Rtu6Fpi

@Kferd The rest of the Bush speech was redacted for reasons that remain unclear
Unfortunately, the Kav TPs have not just been redacted here - they've been withheld in full. Thanks to @cspan, you can watch Bush's public speech (there was an earlier private portion not captured on camera) but there's so much we don't know due to obstinacy from GWB's designees
On 1/25/06, Pres Bush visited the NSA &amp; spoke about warrantless wiretapping (https://t.co/sJtTNTnE87 at 3:48).		Kavanaugh worked on Bush's talking points for that speech (see pic), just as he worked on TPs the previous month, as we uncovered in our #FOIA suit w/ @weareoversight https://t.co/tXYrdVruGu
Here's another hard to find, yet innocuous, page from Judge Kavanaugh's staff secretary file - the first lines of a speech he helped draft for President Bush's 1/23/06 trip to Manhattan, Kan. (Last Chance Bar had a name change &amp; has since closed, for those curious) https://t.co/2osohKza0G
On Aug. 17 we received 191 pages from Kavanaugh's time as WH staff secretary (see graf 20 &amp; kicker https://t.co/MkUprroZDC). 		This Friday we expect another 400 pages due to our #FOIA lawsuit. It's not the millions of pages that Archives should be releasing but 400 &gt; 0? 🤷‍♂️

3. Establish a formal and binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. FTC has stood with members of Congress in introducing a standalone ethics bill, but there’s no harm in including this provision in a larger effort. #EndCorruptionNow

The 182,000 pgs of Gorsuch docs were *2/3* press clips - easy to scroll thru quickly.		The Kavanaugh docs are 1% clips, w/ bulk being drafts on terrorism insurance &amp; airline liability bills post-9/11, judicial noms, PRA regs &amp; ethics waivers, which take hours to read/digest (2/2)
We’ve reached the point where there are about as many Kavanaugh documents out in public as there were Gorsuch documents released in total. But there’s a *MAJOR* difference no one’s talking about (1/2)
Not all e-mails, @DKyleSampson. Just those deemed worthy of release by President Bush's lawyers https://t.co/2yi6rsLCrE
Who among us would disagree? @cspan @HowardMortman @nicninh @CraigCaplan https://t.co/SjLZhUWEP1
Kind of interesting that Oliver North was getting talking points from the Bush White House at the same time the White House counsel's office was delaying, time &amp; again, the release of documents of Reagan-era documents under the PRA https://t.co/rYou4eKjtZ
Had email been as prevalent 30+ yrs ago as it is nowadays, wld certain justices who worked in past administrations/other govt jobs - like Breyer (worked on Watergate), Scalia (known for his barbs) &amp; Thomas (no need to add anything here) - have even been nominated? Don’t think so
We asked for his staff secretary docs in May 2017, didn’t get them, appealed the denial &amp; were again turned down. Unfortunately, the Presidential Records Act makes it nearly impossible for anyone - a transparency group, a US senator, a member of NARA - to see them until 2021
NOW: @senjudiciary holding 1st public biz mtg since #SCOTUS nom announcement. @ChuckGrassley has reasserted the public can’t see Kavanaugh’s staff secretary docs due to exec privilege. @SenFeinstein will cite need for &gt; transparency in confirmation process https://t.co/BoAdcFpgia
While in WHCO, Kavanaugh vetted district court noms for slots in AZ, WA, ID, MD, IL, PA &amp; PR (plus some circuits not yet noted in the docs). 		Total number of votes in the Senate against his suggested judges: 0.		Sure, it was a different time, but you can't do better than zero.
Tonight we close by recalling the halcyon days of 2001, when the guy overseeing our present-day NARA #FOIAs &amp; the guy overseeing our present-day DOJ #FOIAs were discussing whether to release a whopping 68,000 pages of President Reagan's records with some guy named Kavanaugh https://t.co/tOWtBCLnl2
@richardjwolf For example, from today's release https://t.co/telxNV7r0d
@richardjwolf And, Gumpianly, Gary Stern himself shows up throughout the Kavanaugh documents, since Stern's been at NARA forever &amp; Kav was tasked with several PRA-related issues during his time in WH counsel, Also appearing: DOJ's Paul Colborn, the special counsel now handing Kav docs at DOJ
Fix the Court asked for these files via #FOIA in May 2017, and despite ongoing litigation with NARA over that request, we don't expect to get them before the confirmation vote, let alone the hearings https://t.co/HAgEKtFUmG https://t.co/RiD97CaqgM
So pg 125291 is missing (not redacted but missing). Will we see a version of it at a later date? Was it in a different PDF altogether? (Does it imply WH planted stories about Thurmond in 2001?) In any event, the lack of clarity in the doc production to date raises red flags (2/2)
To get sense of what's going on re Kavanaugh documents, take these e-mails b/w Kav &amp; Rachel Brand, pg 125290. https://t.co/wCX1pH5xHu The previous pg (125289) is a link to Robert Novak column on Sen.

*2003
This is nothing - just the past &amp; current general counsel of the National Archives mentioning to Kavanaugh in 2002 that his staff "can review presidential records that are closed to the public" &amp; Kavanaugh noting this e-mail chain may be discovered "in 20 years" (it only took 15) https://t.co/cbI1lC7aJE
- Though he said "next administration" should make decision whether to indict Clinton, there's no mention of that at all in the docs	- Only refs to OIC thus far: 2 articles passed around about Clinton's '01 #SCOTUS disbarment &amp; glowing intro Kav wrote for Starr speech at WH (4/4)
- Kavanaugh was frustrated with partisan nature of judicial confirmations, both for friends like Estrada &amp; others	- Possible Kav was responsible for Bush 2003 SOTU line, "Every judicial nominee deserves a vote [...] no matter who is President &amp; which party controls Senate" (3/4)
- This includes a poll indicating support (55%-40%) for 1st trimester abortions (no follow up), a note from Kavanaugh to Miguel Estrada on "Justice O['Connor]" (no follow up) &amp; a note referencing an attached FISA Court ruling (no file attached). That can't be coincidence (2/4)
Some observations from reading about 20,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's documents so far:	- It's clear the documents released to date have been cherry-picked. Any time a somewhat controversial topic is broached, the e-mail chain abruptly &amp; mysteriously ends (1/4)

Some members of @senjudiciary argue there should only be a limited release of Independent Counsel docs ahead of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.		We disagree.		Unfortunately, the senators in favor of withholding have a strong ally: Judge Kavanaugh https://t.co/44crGFhVL4 https://t.co/HB6UjTMLml
As Kavanaugh wrapped up his work w/ OIC, he told colleagues it'd be up to the next administration whether to indict President Clinton. The ironic thing, of course, is that Kavanaugh played a major role in the legal work of that administration https://t.co/44crGFhVL4 https://t.co/f9jKmS9d7q

Many of the docs just released by @senjudiciary from Kavanaugh's time w/ Indep Counsel have our #FOIA no. (56806) stamped on the bottom. 		So had we not made this request in spring &amp; sued for the docs last month, would senators have tried to withhold them? https://t.co/EjumhLhTjC

Acc. to his just-released e-mails, Kavanaugh was a fan of same-day audio before it was cool, sending his WH colleagues this #SCOTUS press release on audio for two 2003 affirmative action cases, which were the first for which same-day audio was granted since Bush v. Gore https://t.co/2RIOV5N4N7
Please, tell us more about this "#FOIA-like" release of presidential records under the PRA. Not sure that's happening these days for some reason https://t.co/2Tffo9Vy2o
Can't be a coincidence the 1st few hundred pgs of Kavanaugh's files released by @senjudiciary comprise clips on why partisan battles over judicial noms should be deescalated &amp; includes RNC factsheets on "Dems' hypocrisy." Clever but we can see through that https://t.co/zKPspFBmiL

For a time judges didn't want to be on #SCOTUS due to the burdens of riding circuit. The practice ended 107 years ago, long before the (relative) ease (hi, @united!) of commercial flight.

We're still pursuing Kavanaugh's 2001-06 DOJ files &amp; 1993-97 Independent Counsel files; to date, our lawsuit with @weareoversight has yielded 2,492 pages from DOJ/OIC &amp; we expect more as soon as tomorrow. Be sure to check https://t.co/vf0tARJ4Zd for the latest!
15 mos. ago, we sent in a #FOIA for all Kavanaugh docs at Bush Library. (We had a hunch about his nomination.) Yesterday we heard from @USNatArchives that Pres Bush is asserting 12-yr privilege on most files &amp; there's close to nothing we can do to get them https://t.co/8YujVdSeR1
Hi, Tom. First time/long time. Fix the Court &amp; the 176,000 people who follow what we do on Tw/FB/email, who hail from every state, including at least 622 from Arkansas, want to see all Kavanaugh documents, which we, Fix the Court, asked for in *May 2017* &amp; still have not received https://t.co/DHmYyUSKbT
Yes, the old “quantity over quality” argument...		It didn’t work in Agincourt, and it shouldn’t work for the Supreme Court. https://t.co/G0xwk5vDNb
NARA also told us, as they told Sen. Grassley, that they expect to have 300,000 pages processed by Aug. 20, though they didn't indicate when those pages - about 1/3 of what they expect to release, all from Kavanaugh's time in WH counsel's office - would be available to the public
The Archives did grant FTC's request to expedite our #FOIA for Kavanaugh files, although that would seem to mean little since initially NARA said **it'd take 20 years** for our #FOIA to be completed. "Expedition" is relative
FTC + @weareoversight appealed that determination since we didn't believe all 13,934 pages had specifically been designated by President Bush as off limits for the full 12 years allowed under the PRA. But this afternoon, the Library sent us this letter https://t.co/356KBpVdII
Our #FOIA for to the Bush Library for Judge Kavanaugh records from May 8, 2017, was lost or somehow "unreceived" until April 5, 2018. Two weeks later the Library denied access to 13,934 pages of records under the Presidential Records Act

It is a FALSE CLAIM (see shot of BMK e-mail below) to say that the Bush Library can't release Judge Kavanaugh's 2003-06 staff secretary files since they've already released some, albeit in heavily redacted form. 		See this thread for more https://t.co/XtjmPuLdVi https://t.co/R93U08t66E

Yet here are 2 pgs of a speech honoring Buckley that crossed Kav's desk in 2005. The other 23 pgs in the file are being withheld, but fact that some of it - &amp; this is but one of many examples - is out means that senatorial insistence that whole SS cache is "off limits" is silly https://t.co/gCV4AQ3KzP
For example, 4 years ago someone requested all of Pres. Bush's correspondence with William F. Buckley; some of it occurred while Kavanaugh was staff secretary. The Library is withholding most of that correspondence under the Presidential Records Act (3/4)
These files, from 2003-06, are heavily redacted - almost 100%, in fact - but some snippets have been posted online as part of four- and five-year-old #FOIA requests. (That's the current #FOIA backlog at the Bush Library) (2/4)
THREAD: Here's how we know the claim made by some U.S. senators that Judge Kavanaugh's staff secretary files are off limits is a load of bull: the @USNatArchives itself has released some of Kavanaugh's staff secretary files (1/4)
2045: Justice D retires, Kav retires, add Justice M: E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M (9 justices **becomes permanent**)		We hope @senjudiciary asks Kavanaugh his thoughts on life tenure. Maybe we'll join @judicialnetwork / @WeDemandJustice &amp; run TL ads, cf https://t.co/bfffAa2Wyv (8/8)
2041: Justice B retires, add Justice K: Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K (11 j's)		2042: Gorsuch retires (10 j's)		2043: Justice C retires, add justice L: Kavanaugh, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L (10 j's) (7/8)
2037: Add Justice I: Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I (12 j's)		2038: Kagan retires (11 j's)		2039: Justice A retires (**18 years after appointment**), add Justice J: Gorsuch, Kav, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (11 j's) (6/8)
2031: Add Justice F: Roberts, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C, D, E, F (11 j's)		2033: Roberts retires, add Justice G: Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C, D, E, F, G (11 j's)		2035: Soto retires, add Justice H: Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (11 j's) (5/8)
2027: Thomas retires, add Justice D: Roberts, Alito, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C, D (10 j's)		2029: Add Justice E: Roberts, Alito, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C, D, E (11 j's)		2030: Alito retires (10 j's) (4/8)
2023: Breyer retires, add Justice B: Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B (9 j's)		2025: Add Justice C: Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A, B, C (10 j's) (3/8)
2019: Roberts, Thomas, RBG, Breyer, Alito, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav (9 j's)		2021: Term limits law passes, RBG retires, add Justice A: Roberts, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, Soto, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kav, A (9 j's) (2/8)
A back-of-envelope calculation shows why we don't need court-packing; we need term limits at #SCOTUS, where j's are added every 2 years &amp; stay until all 9 rotate thru (18yrs). Assume current j's are grandfathered in, serve ~27 yrs &amp; don't retire in prez elex yr. Let's begin (1/8)

The cache of government documents released today thanks to our #FOIA suit v. NARA show the focus of the investigation over Vince Foster's death centered on Starr, Kavanaugh &amp; co. searching for...a cache of government documents
It's the case that won't go away: NARA files released to Fix the Court today include Kavanaugh's thoughts on Morrison v. Olson as part of a draft filing to the Eighth Circuit over then Gov. Tucker's ties to the Whitewater scandal  https://t.co/5SiIdrXk8b
The files include a discussion over whether the FBI may use polygraphs in their work (they can), whether people associated with the Rose Law Firm used a shredder (they did) &amp; how people associated with the Clinton '90 AR gov. &amp; '92 prez campaigns used them as fronts to make money
BREAKING: NARA releases 2nd batch of Kavanaugh's Starr report files https://t.co/MB3JwoATKe pursuant to our #FOIA lawsuit.		This comes on heels of DOJ's 1st release of Kavanaugh files Friday, which also happened as a result of FTC / @weareoversight lawsuit https://t.co/0O0hC7YfZi
Pp. 206-230: More back &amp; forth on PRA, including review of this op-ed https://t.co/dwhAiCqIlm that ran 12/20/01 in @PostOpinions		That's all for now. Pursuant to our other FOIA suit, expect another 1,000 pages from Starr Report to be posted at https://t.co/3S45v1e4sO on Monday
Pp. 177-205: Includes some e-mails about whether exec branch officials should be required to testify in public/before Congress. From contemporaneous Kavanaugh files in @USNatArchives, this was a question bandied about a fair amount after 9/11, given concerns over classified info
Pp. 136-150: Various e-mails about proposed legislation (mostly redacted).	Pp. 151-177: E-mails &amp; letters on **IRONY ALERT** the Presidential Records Act, which is the law that essentially allows President Bush &amp; Senate GOP to claim privilege on Kavanaugh's staff secretary files
Pp. 1-135: email chain with Kavanaugh &amp; OLC about post-9/11 Air Transportation Safety &amp; System Stabilization Act, which created the Air Transp. Stabilization Board (issued loans to carriers to help maintain safety) &amp; the Victim Compensation Fund. Very heavy redactions
BREAKING: The first 404 pages in Judge Kavanaugh's DOJ file have been processed: 230 pages w/ redactions https://t.co/KKu26UT3Xu &amp; 174 pages withheld full.		This comes 15 months after our initial #FOIA request to the agency &amp; 1 month after we sued for the docs w/ @weareoversight

NARA #FOIA: We req'd files marked "Kavanaugh" from Starr Report manifest (https://t.co/mTbb4PS9Nr). By making formal request, we wanted to see types of withholdings they'd try &amp; if we'd need to fight. Yet since we got nothing post-4/4 #FOIA, we sued 7/10 &amp; expect files 7/30 (4/5)
DOJ #FOIA 2: We also believe that while Kavanaugh was in the White House, he was part of a small group of advisers working on judicial nominations, which included staff from the agency's Office of Legal Policy. We requested Kavanaugh's OLP file yesterday (3/5)
DOJ #FOIA 1: We believe that while Kavanaugh was in WH, he wrote/received memos from the Office of Legal Counsel, which advises prez/exec agencies on legal matters. We requested memos Sept. '17, didn't receive any so sued on 7/10 &amp; expect to get 1,800 pages worth around 8/3 (2/5)

If @POTUS tried to dismiss suit for actions he took before he was prez, he'd likely lose given Jones v Clinton. But wld you expect Kavanaugh to recuse from cert in said case given his work on Solomon v Lawless (Bush personal-capacity suit)? Cf 2014-0216-F1 https://t.co/UjSffZtTQS

(Liberals are going to be annoyed when we do the exact same thing in a few years for their next #SCOTUS pick. Oh well.)
Kavanaugh also recused himself from a case involving the 3-5MM White House e-mails that somehow disappeared 2003-05 (CREW v Office of Administration), from one concerning the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 (House Judiciary v Miers) &amp; from the Plame affair (Wilson v Libby) https://t.co/ytwBtvdmEg
The best-captioned recusal is U.S. v. Rayburn House Office Bldg Rm 2113 (then of Rep. Jefferson / cash-in-freezer fame). The FBI raided the office 2 weeks before Kavanaugh's confirmation to CADC &amp; case involved “special procedures” used in FBI search 🤔 https://t.co/j7YxFg28jW

Finally, the fact that Kavanaugh recused himself from 5 U.S. v. Philip Morris suits needs some looking into (tobacco co. Brown &amp; Williamson retained Kirkland &amp; Ellis during Kavanaugh's time at the firm &amp; B&amp;W, though now part of RJ Reynolds, was co-defendant in these cases)
Next is 09-5388, Navab-Safavi v B'cast Bd of Govs: a woman who translated English-Farsi for @VOANews claims she was fired for making anti-Iraq war music video during own free time. Does this mean Kavanaugh is recused from all Iraq war cases? All music video cases? We keep digging
The past is prologue: 10-5140, Alexander v. FBI, is a case related to "filegate," in which members of the Clinton team, in '93-'94, allegedly requested the FBI files of the GOP holdovers in the new administration. Bc its provenance related to the IC inquiry, Kavanaugh recused
Some other likely prior work ties: petitioner in 12-5399, Al Bakri v Obama, was captured in Thailand in 2002, while Kavanaugh was working for WHCO, &amp; was sent to Bagram, sought habeas relief; petitioner in 10-5388, Adair v Solis, was fired from USDOL in 2003, so similar issue
Can't figure out the reason for the recusal in 12-7069, Araya v. Bayly, where the petitioner tried to remove the D.C. Superior Ct judge who presided over his divorce case (Bayly) from the proceedings bc Bayly (&amp; his ex-wife) were Catholic (neither goes to the Kavanaughs' church)
Bank of America is also the largest single stock holding of the Employment Retirement System of Texas, in which Kavanaugh's wife has an account
With all the @BankofAmerica litigation that has reached CADC in the last decade, not a stretch to believe Kavanaugh would recuse in three BofA cases due to financial reasons. He's had a BofA checking acct. since at least 2003 &amp; BofA credit card debt in 2006-12 &amp; 2015-16
Some recusals are harder to figure out, like why did Kavanaugh recuse from an Abramoff case, 09-3112, U.S. v. Safavian (respondent was GSA CoS who lied to FBI about his ties to the disgraced lobbyist)? Best guess is Safavian atty was counsel to VP Cheney when Kav worked in WH
Next up is Spaeth v. Georgetown Univ. Petitioner sued @GeorgetownLaw &amp; 5 other law schools for not interviewing him for a job; he claimed age discrimination. Kavanaugh recusal likely due to deep ties to GULC, having taught there in 2007 &amp; spoken there ~10 other times as judge
Another easy one: Kavanaugh recused from 17-1504, in re State of Maryland, on the proposed @wmata Purple Line. The judge's wife is a public officer in Md. (Chevy Chase Village Section 5 town manager) &amp; their house is near the proposed route. One could image potential conflicts https://t.co/XXBY3NkHr8
He didn't recall why he recused from 16-5366, Judicial Watch v. NARA. That's an easy one: it's the FOIA suit JW pushed to obtain the draft OIC indictment against Hillary Clinton that came to light in 1999. (JW lost btw &amp; HRC was never indicted)
Of the 136 times Kavanaugh has recused from a case since he joined the D.C. Circuit in 2006, he does not recall the reasons behind 90 of his recusals, or 66% of them https://t.co/lB6BWu4Dhw. That seems a bit high. Maybe we can help him out

LOWLIGHT: Kavanaugh cites a '97 case in the SJQ where he sought "documents of a gov't attorney employed in the White House." Our FOIA request to the Bush Library, which is being stonewalled, is for...documents of a gov't attorney - Kavanaugh - who was employed in the White House! https://t.co/KpRqALOxN5
LOWLIGHT: Kavanaugh copied &amp; pasted same answer on conflicts of interest that Gorsuch, Garland, Sotomayor, Kagan, Alito, Roberts &amp; Breyer used in their SJQs. Not his fault; @senjudiciary should ask differently https://t.co/LBQtYU6MOU
LOWLIGHT: Appendix 23, which is Kavanaugh's net worth statement, has not been included by @senjudiciary. It likely includes the value of his retirement (TSP) plan &amp; of his house. Shame bc it's fairly easy to redact personal info from &amp; release
HIGHLIGHT: Kavanaugh is also confused as to why Paul Clement wasn't on Trump's #SCOTUS shortlist https://t.co/1isQ5HfeHd
HIGHLIGHT: Of the 10 "notable cases" he mentions, 1st is on unitary exec, 2nd is case the indicted Russians are citing in their response to Mueller, 3rd is anti-EPA reg. case, 4th is "please vote for me, Rand Paul" 4A case, 8th *upheld* donation limit to pol. parties

If you requested these speech files - remember, they're being withheld in full by NARA - you’d still have to pay $0.80/pg. just to find out, over the course of 21 unhelpful pages like these https://t.co/uJMdobC2m6 that materials responsive to your request won’t be released (4/4)
That, of course, makes little sense. It's possible that maybe some of the speech drafts had some potentially restricted materials about the number of captured Iraqis or confiscated mortars, but it's highly unlikely. And it gets worse (3/4)
Bush wrote 5 drafts of the speech before delivering it &amp; the final text is still on HF's website https://t.co/9BFHXokTdV. Yet a copy of the speech from the Bush Library itself is marked "restricted" since it would somehow "disclose confidential advice b/w prez &amp; advisors" (2/4)
For those wondering why obtaining Kavanaugh files (at all + in a timely manner) is going to be so difficult, let's take a single file from the Bush Library as an example, a copy of Pres. Bush's 11/11/03 speech to @Heritage that Kavanaugh worked on (1/4)

@brianefallon @jadler1969 @cdkang76 Yes, there are abortion cases &amp; ACA cases &amp; school desegregation cases on the horizon, but new cases will have new facts, &amp; recusal would not be required if a nominee actually answered questions about the facts of (&amp; reasoning behind) the earlier cases
@brianefallon @jadler1969 @cdkang76 Why is it OK for nominee to say s/he agrees with holding in Brown v. Board but can’t say if s/he agrees with it in Roe or NFIB v. Sebelius? Past cases should be fair game &amp; sens should vote based on a nominee’s reasoning (e.g. “I can see both sides bc...” vs. “I can’t answer...”)
See, you don’t need to “pack the court.” You just need to add a new justice every 2 years to ensure fairness &amp; accountability.

5. Finally, huge thanks to @Jaime_ASantos &amp; fmr @USEEOC commissioner Jenny Yang for their candid &amp; compelling testimony &amp; putting up with a smattering of disjointed questions from an uneven panel. If you missed it, you can watch/read here (5/5) https://t.co/UHo9pVrNGa
4. Judiciary's tradition of opacity has been seen as positive (no one wants judges soliciting favors for rulings) but today it's a liability. Creating a more transparent system where victims can come fwd &amp; harassment can be punished is most imp fix 3rd branch can undertake (4/5)
3. Several senators expressed dismay that judges who resign due to harassment may keep salaries &amp; though that's mostly up to Congress to fix, the AO has a role beyond throwing up hands &amp; citing a narrow interpretation of judicial misconduct law as the office is wont to do (3/5)
2. Unfortunately, no one, not even those working on these issues, has a full grasp of how victims of harassment can come forward in a way that's both supportive &amp; confidential &amp; is a marked improvement from what existed before Kozinski scandal. That needs to be made clearer (2/5)
Takeaways from today's @senjudiciary hearing:	1. The third branch still has a long way to go to ensure its clerks &amp; support staff have the resources to feel safe in their courthouses &amp; that judges are given legitimate punishments once found to be harassers (1/5)

Jenny Yang &amp; @Jaime_ASantos end by saying that the federal judiciary, assisted by an independent source, should conduct a broad &amp; confidential study on pervasiveness of harassment
About to recess at @senjudiciary but @SenJohnKennedy hits it home by asking if the panel knows of any sitting federal judges who have engaged in harassment. @Jaime_ASantos answers yes
"I'm talking about a punishment that meets the crime" adds @SenBlumenthal &amp; he suggests there is a moral responsibility to act "when a judge blackens the name of all judges" &amp; the judiciary should have the authority to stop the pay
Next up is @SenBlumenthal, who makes that point that it's insane how a judge can retire &amp; the complaint against him goes away. The senator urges Duff to change that, esp. since pay is continued after a resignation
2. On the prep side, this is the same committee that does judicial nominations &amp; the Russia investigation, among other hot-button issues, so prep on this, from senator 1 to 20, wasn't as high as we'd like, though of course several have asked great Qs
For those watching or not watching at home, these hearings like today's @senjudiciary are challenging in terms of impact for several reasons. 1. There's no flow bc senators are popping in &amp; out due to other hearings happening at the same time
.@SenTedCruz adds that it's both a blessing and a curse "that the judiciary is independent" and asks each panelist how pervasive harassment is. "The system now places the burden on victims," adds Jenny Yang, but the judiciary should do more to help victims come forward
Next up is @SenTedCruz, who asks if there have been any taxpayer-funded harassment settlements. Duff says no. You may recall this has been a big issue in Congress
Thank you for that question, @maziehirono
And @maziehirono responds by saying that, well, the Department of Defense said its "framework" was fine and then let harassment continue unabated for decades. Wow
.@maziehirono "Why isn't harassment included specifically in the code of conduct and the Judicial Conduct &amp; Disability Act?" Duff: "I think the act is fine [and] the framework works." WHOA. No. Not even close https://t.co/3zjJzuLoKN
Next up is @maziehirono, who has become famous this session for asking each judicial nominee about whether they have ever sexually harassed anyone
.@SenJohnKennedy asks how can we decide what misbehavior is actionable criminally vs. actionable in some other way, such as pushing someone out of their job. "Intention," answers @Jaime_ASantos, adding there are ppl whose conduct cannot be improved &amp; they need to go
.@SenKamalaHarris also asks Duff if federal judges are asking clerks to sign their own in-chambers confidentiality agreements, which would be terrible for their chilling effects. Duff said he'll look into whether this practice is occurring
.@SenKamalaHarris asks if news of harassment may lead judges to not hiring female law clerks &amp; Duff says that would be a terrible outcome &amp; isn't one he sees happening
Duff says a judiciary IG would be unconstitutional. First off, show your work. Secondly, it's not. Are there issues abt whether IG could oversee #SCOTUS? Yes. But overall, there's not one w/ creating an office to ensure judges aren't accepting large gifts or harassing clerks
As of now, there is no independent body ensuring the federal courts - that's 94 district, 13 circuit and one Supreme Court, aren't messing up &amp; given how meekly they've handled the harassment issue, they have ZERO credibility here
A body in charge of policing itself will on its face do a crappy job. It will. We all know this, and we've all seen this
Duff, when asked by @SenThomTillis, says he thinks that a judiciary IG is "unnecessary." (He is wrong and here come some tweets as to why)
"Your office has the power to implement a [confidential reporting] system," @SenFeinstein emphasizes judiciary has power to makes impactful changes (though we'd also like to see new legislation along these lines since we don't fully trust 3rd branch to honor its charge)
Duff is asked if anyone in the judiciary was aware of the Kozinski allegations, which he said they didn't. Uh what? https://t.co/PoZFr5tJpY
Up next is former EEOC commissioner Jenny Yang: "It's hard to create an independent process when the judiciary is the one policing itself" 🎯🎯🎯
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't studied its scope," @Jaime_ASantos bringing it home. In other words, the judiciary needs to look backwards, as well, to understand how large a problem there is and its various downstream effects over time
.@Jaime_ASantos brings up VERY important point: there's a national report which has problems, of course, but how do we ensure that each circuit creates and implements its own modernized workplace conduct plan?
Btw Duff would have been smart to have his GC testify, who is a woman. It feels a bit odd to have a dude as the face of this
Next up is @Jaime_ASantos: "Harassment in the judiciary isn't the norm, but it isn't rare, either."
All of this is so theoretical. We want to Duff to walk us through two things: one, how a clerk can file a complaint now vs. how it was pre-Dec. 2017, and two, what he thinks should happen to judges who are serial harassers - i.e., that they can't just retire &amp; make it all go away
Duff alludes to having to wait for the next Judicial Conference meeting IN THREE MONTHS for many of these recs to be implemented
Let's break this letter thing Duff is talking about down: the working group writes report, sees it's not getting positive response &amp; then AO scrambles to get several membership orgs to write supportive letters. Everyone in DC has done exactly this at some point &amp; it's super lame
The AO's Jim Duff is up, and he notes that he's been working behind the scenes with @ChuckGrassley &amp; @SenFeinstein staff on these issues - and those staffs should get their due for pushing the working group in the right direction here and holding it accountable
.@SenFeinstein notes that workplace conduct bills have passed in the House and Senate but no law has been passed &amp; gives due to @SenGillibrand, who has been working on these efforts on the Senate side
@Jaime_ASantos is getting some great shoutouts from @SenFeinstein: "It is because of her efforts that we're here today"
Given what the third branch does and what it represents, @SenFeinstein begins, "I'm shocked that we have to hold a hearing on preventing harassment in the judiciary."
His concerns with the working group and it's report? "The report is exceedingly vague [and] it didn't set any timeframe for the judiciary to implement its recommendations."
Speaking out takes tremendous courage, @ChuckGrassley adds, and that's true in all branches. "Bc of these women's bravery, we can hopefully make real significant changes to these imbalances"
@chuckGrassley notes that nearly every federal agency has an independent agency monitoring misconduct, so it's time for the federal judiciary to catch up. Here are details of his judiciary IG bill, last introduced in 2015 https://t.co/KGrxpLRpcp
We'll be tweeting throughout the hearing, but be sure to follow @melissa_charlot for her livetweeting

There's a 0% chance that Dems, when next in the Senate majority with a Dem. president, will honor blue slips if, say, 2 Rep. senators from Texas want to block an ACS-picked CA5 nominee. Irony's been dead for a few years now, and sanctimony should be killed off, too @senjudiciary

"Gorsuch’s DOJ e-mails show his bias toward military commissions, and his recusal from a #SCOTUS petition on the commissions’ legality seems to confirm that bias. It’s unclear, though, why he’d recuse himself from one Guantanamo case but sit on two others" https://t.co/h9KkYvDO9Z
That the justices recuse themselves 200x per term w/o a single explanation - &amp; with several errors (Kagan in Jennings, Kennedy in Washington, Gorsuch in the other 2 GTMO cases) - shows they may not be taking their ethical obligations seriously enough @senjudiciary @HouseJudiciary
Another major takeaway is that justices who own stock - Roberts/Breyer/Alito - only recused 28 times due to stocks so far this term, vs. 47 times last term. We know Alito sold $SLB to hear a case 4/16/18. Maybe the drop in recusals means all 3 are listening to our calls to divest
On Oct. 10, Gorsuch stepped aside from al Bahlul v. US (GTMO case) but a week later sat on al-Nashiri v. US (another GTMO case) &amp; he didn't recuse from Dalmazzi v. US, argued at #SCOTUS in Jan. &amp; tangentially related to - you guessed it - GTMO military commissions. What gives?

Lungstrum asked whether Trump administration's stance toward immigrants and immigration cases is impacting workloads and judicial budgets. Answer: "It can have an impact across the U.S., and we expect it to, but we haven't seen it yet"
Lungstrum asked about CSOs, which are court security officers, typically hired by the U.S. Marshals Service. Fix the Court has been calling for increased funding for CSOs since our #FOIA revealed some gaps in the system https://t.co/KbMe8KFCqU
Duff: "I think it's education within our branch, many of whom weren't aware of what existed, so we need to elevate training. One of the things were going to do in our orientation process [...] is a separate day of orientation" to discuss issues related to harassment
Follow up from @RepCartwright: What are the protections in place for clerks given the confines of judges' chambers and the fear for retaliation?
Duff (cont.): "...We've been hearing employees need &amp; want guidance &amp; intervention earlier on in the process so that you don't need to get to the formal complaint process, so we're going to create other [less formal] outlets for employees both nationally and in the circuits."
Duff: "We haven't finished our work [in the working group], but what we have determined one of the barriers to filing complaints is the formality of our complaint process..."
.@RepCartwright asks Jim Duff about the Judiciary Working Group on preventing sexual harassment in the judiciary, specifically on how the reporting methods are being improved
Major headlines: $95 million for &gt; IT infrastructure, plus #SCOTUS requests another 14 security officers

Duff: "Already in fiscal 2018, [the U.S. courts] have had 11 million attempted break-ins or hacks to our system." Whoa.
Lungstrum: "I'm not a technology person, but we have to deal with preventing intrusions" in our tech infrastructure, which is "an expensive proposition It's our no. 1 administrative priority"
Duff: "We have about 140 judicial vacancies at the moment, 68 of them are what we consider 'emergencies'." Emergency = greater than 18 mo. vacancy or &gt;700 cases per judge
Up now is Jim Duff, head of the Administrative Office of U.S. Court and secretary of the Judicial Conference of the U.S. Nothing surprising in opening remarks; generally thanking Congress for their work in funding third branch priorities
Lungstrum also noted that the judiciary is asking for a $2M outlay to hire more court security officers nationwide, which we support
In FY17, #SCOTUS got $79M &amp; it received $82M in the FY18 omnibus spending bill signed last month. According to opening testimony, it looks as if the judiciary is still calculating its FY19 request, but Judge Lungstrum (budget cmte. chair) says it'll be ~3% increase overall

After Justice Kennedy's recusal last month from a case he participated in as a CA9 judge in 1985, is it possible the justices are now paying closer attention to their (much much) earlier work that, after all, still requires disqualification by statute?
The Roberts recusal took some digging: turns out that Alan Poulnott's habeas petition crossed the Chief's desk in OT91 (!) when he was Bush 41's principal deputy SG (see p. 111 https://t.co/9JriIbCIdQ)
Four recusals in today's orders: one EK due to her work as SG, one NMG due to his work in CA10, one SAA due to his ownerships of up to 50K in $JNJ stock and one JGR in a CA11 habeas case that we're looking into https://t.co/QRIAvs4sh2

While #SCOTUS hears 2 cases today, the justices will be protected by dozens of SCPD officers in the courtroom, elsewhere in the building and on the plazas that surround it. Once they leave D.C., though, their protection is up to them and them alone. (1/3)

That we were able to figure out most if not all of the justices' 12 USMS-covered trips in July 2015 (we had to narrow our request to a single month since DOJ quoted us $4,560 to get a whole year's worth of info) is due, in large part, to @SCOTUSMap, so a BIG thank you to them!
The bifurcated nature of justices’ protection (USMS vs. #SCOTUS Police) noted in e-mail from deputy USM asking 2 hrs after USMS became involved in the investigation into Scalia's death, “Has USSCP been notified? [...] Just checking all the boxes." (It had been at that point)
On the USMS policy on how/where to protect justices: #FOIA docs confirm coverage only occurs upon request by #SCOTUS marshal or by a justice. So unlike other high-ranking fed officials, protection is opt-in &amp; not utilized each time a justice leaves D.C. That shouldn't be the case
Key findings: it took 3.5 hrs for USMS to reach Scalia once his body was discovered due to a combo of factors: those who found him were unclear of protocol, local USMS initially unreachable &amp; nearest field office 64 mi away. Also likely: local USMS didn't know Scalia was in W/TX

That an average person would "reasonably question [the justices'] impartiality" in these cases must be weighed against the fact that we don't want an even number of justices, given the likely 5-4s here. So what's the solution? (No, really; we'd like to hear from you) 4/4

CJ Roberts sold his @Microsoft shares in Jan. 2016 so he could vote for cert. in MSFT v. Baker. (He will also sit in next week's MSFT v. US). Yet he, Breyer &amp; Alito still own 50 individual stocks; that led to 47 cert.-stage recusals last year. They should divest already!
With the indictments, #appellatetwitter is probably busy, but if not, can anyone who's worked in federal court explain benefit of using employment dispute resolution vs filing a formal misconduct claim vs going to the police? See answer to Q8 in particular https://t.co/W9orLB3UMx
Short version: is there a reason for Breyer to own up to $100,000 in @Cisco shares, esp. since Cisco has signed on to a pro-@Microsoft brief in their #SCOTUS case next week, which does not trigger a recusal but reflects poorly on him &amp; the court?

Crowdsourcing #AppellateTwitter here: have any of you heard Justice Thomas speak so directly about the death penalty and agonizing over petitions whether to stay executions? https://t.co/Nte4RwI14G (46:56-47:53) https://t.co/4aqxknqOrM
CT: "Look at Justice Scalia. [...] He'd say, 'You have to fly the flag. You have to go out there [and give more public events]. He was more extroverted than I."
Justice Thomas' response to what he thinks has changed regarding his attitude toward his job over time: "Judging is like climbing a mountain. You see more at 10,000 feet than you do at 5,000 feet or 1,000 feet."
Thomas recounts the following exchange on his frequent solo dissenting/concurring opinions:	Scalia: "You don't care for other people's opinions, do you?	CT: "No, I do care. But I prefer my own."
CT: "I have never met a judge who wants to execute people. I haven't met that judge yet." Says gray hair is due to worrying over whether he has gotten his capital punishment decisions correct over the years.
CT: "There's a real decided difference between the myth of what goes into judging and what actually happens. It's a wonderful world to work in where you actually have to write out what you think and work it through. I like that world."
CT continues: "The members of the court were just wonderful people - to a person. [Becoming a justice] was a lot of work, but in retrospect it was an exciting time. The court itself is almost the opposite of what it was to get there."
Justice Thomas on confirmation hearings: "I don't think the process is what it ought to be. I don't think they should become spectacles. I think we're going to lose some of our best people who don't want to go through the ordeal."
Justice Thomas: "We like to be in the shadows. It was fine [back in the green room]." https://t.co/CVv3RTJhcn

Finally is the event staff both for #SCOTUS &amp; SCHS. According to one profile, there are &gt;1,400 events held in the building each year (though unclear where that no. comes from). Either way, that's one hell of a job! 8/x
We're also reminded, thanks to this search, that since OT72 #SCOTUS has had its own Office of Legal Counsel (not to be confused DOJ's), which you can read more about in this 1993 @DukeJudicature article https://t.co/M9Sg6S1146 7/x

Next is the official #SCOTUS (still) photographer, which has always felt like a funny job, given the courtroom ban on cameras of all sorts. Then come the IT folks, who seem to focus primarily on network security. No mention of the new online filing :( 5/x
First off, lots of current/recent clerks pop up, clearly stoked about their clerkships &amp; rightly so. Next are several ppl w/ clerical jobs at #SCOTUS: justices' aides &amp; secretaries. Also a few tour guides &amp; art curators 4/x
When you look up the former domestic travel coordinator online, his LinkedIn profile comes up. So maybe we'll learn some other things about #SCOTUS from the ugly duckling of social media 3/x
Why do this? We recently stumbled upon how #SCOTUS Police had a "domestic travel coordinator" but he retired (unclear if replaced). FTC has a #FOIA on whether USMS are adequately protecting the justices &amp; fact that there's a role at #SCOTUS Police on travel is a positive sign 2/x

@CA3blog That's fair &amp; we appreciate the feedback. Our larger point is 2-fold: 1, that even within the lame rules that govern disability proceedings, &amp; given the rulings in previous misconduct cases, the judiciary can still do more; &amp; 2, it's really up to Congress to write a better JCDA

#SCOTUS justices often brag about how &gt;50% of their opinions are unanimous. Yet they lack unanimity when deciding whether to attend the #SOTU, and it reflects terribly on the court to see only a few of the 9 there. Either all should go or none should go. Figure it out.

Sure, there are concerns about televising certain court cases. Trials can be tough. But saying yesterday's (gripping/heartbreaking) sentencing in MI is a reason not to televise appeals courts is like saying the most recent snowstorm disproves climate change. It makes no sense 8/8
There's no way that Justice Alito would show up with a "not true" placard at a campaign finance case or Justice Ginsburg would drop a "faker" sign at one involving @POTUS 7/x
Finally, in addition to the apples-to-oranges comparison b/w trials and appeals, pundits will say, "See what cameras did to Congress?!?" Well. Members of Congress use televised floor speeches to move voters. #SCOTUS, if televised, can't do that (see Article III) 6/x
Instead, when you watch federal appeals in person (&amp; hopefully via C-SPAN 4 in the future), you see judges and justices have thoughtful discussions of what the law should be. You can't tell which are appointed by Dems or GOP, which is a good thing! 5/x
With such a short amount of argument time, there's no time for attorneys or judges to grandstand. There's barely time to get your points in 4/x
In #SCOTUS, 9 justices hear a total of 1 hour of argument divided among 2-3 attorneys...and that's it. In other federal appeals courts, panels range from 3 (usually) to 10-15 (special circumstances, called "en banc") judges, and arguments are often only 10-20 min. per side 3/x
Let's start by comparing what happened yesterday in the Nassar case with what occurs in #SCOTUS. During a trial, including sentencing, there are defendants and witnesses and exhibits and often a jury and opening and closing statements. None of that occurs at #SCOTUS 2/x
Whenever there's major drama unfolding in a televised courtroom, pundits will use it as an opportunity to decry the presence of cameras in all courts, including the Supreme Court. Here's why they're wrong 1/x

Last week #SCOTUS sent out media advisories (https://t.co/arZowcBxRJ) on press seating for 2 big cases, Janus &amp; U.S. v. @Microsoft. Okay. But will the court do anything - like release expedited audio - to help the large number of reporters report their stories? Of course not

In non-shutdown news, we learned yesterday that the 10th Circuit voted to start uploading argument audio to the web within a day or so of a hearing. Previously, you had to file a motion for audio. Now #SCOTUS is *the only federal appeals court* not allowing within-a-day audio

@MichaelMcGough3 @5thCircAppeals Think so. Like so many things, needing to say, “sexual harassment is bad” in 2017 would have seemed unnecessary, yet here we are, and Roberts’ voice and leadership have been MIA for too long

Sixteen days from now, Chief Justice Roberts will release his Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary. He should use the opportunity to assure victims of harassment in the third branch that they will be heard and that justice will be done
@CA3blog @davidlnoll @AlisonFrankel @MDAppeal To which court of appeals will Judge Kozinski's misconduct proceedings be referred?
We were hoping Brett Talley was a sacrificial lamb and the rest of the nominees would be as thoughtful &amp; up to the task as, say, Willett &amp; Ho. But then this happened... https://t.co/O70uRZxFx7
Last time there was a complaint against Kozinski, the complaint was transferred to the Third Circuit Judicial Council. This time, though, he won’t get off with a mere wrist-slap https://t.co/TszBd1P7pg
@ProfHenderson We're nonpartisan on all things except grammar
@ProfHenderson Yes, this is a shame. Also a shame: when people adopt the adjective "Democrat," used widely and incorrectly by Fox News, instead of the more accurate "Democratic"

RT @NYMag: Is the judiciary ready to handle harassment charges? @cristianafarias writes https://t.co/cyWq0DaZmR
@cristianafarias @senjudiciary @JudiciaryDems Bottom line: the federal judiciary should reassure those thinking about going public with complaints of sexual misconduct that they will be heard and that justice will be done. Chief Justice Roberts' year-end report - being released on 12/31 - would be a good venue for this.
@cristianafarias @senjudiciary @JudiciaryDems Even so, the disciplinary process for lower court judges under the JCDA is slow and judicial councils are not always on point with releasing their findings to the public
@cristianafarias First off, the Judicial Conduct &amp; Disability Act DOES NOT APPLY TO #SCOTUS. We e-mailed every single @senjudiciary &amp; @JudiciaryDems counsel today asking if Congress will do anything about that. (They can, just as they make #SCOTUS file financial disclosures.) So far, 0 responses
Very important piece from @cristianafarias on sexual misconduct and the federal judiciary in which he asks, "Is the judiciary ready to handle harassment charges?" The short answer is no https://t.co/LGMd5SG6G1
Wisconsinites tried to get their judges to follow stricter recusal rules. Dozens of petitions were filed in favor of new rules; here's who filed against. Guess which side a majority of judges came down on? More here https://t.co/H2cvcr0miz https://t.co/BJT30kzNUh

@AnthonyMKreis @LambdaLegal But, tea-leaf readers, the question now becomes, how could Justice Kennedy retire in the summer of 2018 if OT18 includes a Title VII LGBT case...?
@AnthonyMKreis .@LambdaLegal response to cert. denial: "By declining to hear this case, #SCOTUS is delaying the inevitable &amp; leaving a split in the circuits that will cause confusion across the country." CA7 ruled in April that Title VII covers LGBT workers https://t.co/Qo5L3Aj5Ix
Law prof. @AnthonyMKreis answers: "Not an ideal vehicle. [...] Suspect #SCOTUS wants this to play out in the CoAs a little longer, too. For now, we'll wait for Zarda in the 2d Cir." Zarda was argued en banc Sept. 26; opinion not out yet

What’s the German word for when you hate a judge’s actions, not to mention his rulings, but you can’t impeach him because doing so would lay bare the hypocrisy of keeping individuals who’ve committed worse acts in office?

Which all goes to show how Kozinski and C. Thomas did roughly the same thing at roughly the same did (we'd argue the Thomas accusations are worse), yet only one of these two will be unemployed in 2018, and you can guess which
@qjurecic There's the 9th Circuit Judicial Council, which hears complaints (which may then go before a national JCUS Conduct Committee), and Kozinski could be censured, could be taken off cases or could be given anti-harassment training. Impeachment rec possible, too
Judge Kozinski should step down. It's also important to point out there are remedies for lower court judges who behave improperly that are short of impeachment - e.g., censure, counseling &amp; taking cases off docket. These remedies don't exist for #SCOTUS justices but should https://t.co/IBM6Q0k2UN
