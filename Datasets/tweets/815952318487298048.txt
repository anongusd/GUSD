Instead these bills restrict the rights of law abiding citizens - by imposing unnecessary delays and regulations on the purchasing of firearms. Please know that I will continue to fight to protect our Second Amendment rights in Congress.
Democrats in the House passed legislation that, if signed into law, would restrict our constitutional right to bear arms. H.R. 8, and H.R. 1112 do nothing to make it harder for criminals to obtain firearms. https://t.co/WhYIfk8ifA

This bill falls short of providing necessary funding to secure our borders and is forcing @POTUS to declare a national emergency to get the job done. I believe we can and must do better. 6/6

Florida‚Äôs Panhandle needs help now, not six months down the road. It‚Äôs been 4 months since Hurricane Michael hit &amp; much of the Panhandle is still in ruins, with people living in tents &amp; surviving on the bare essentials. We need to pass disaster funding &amp; we need to do it now. 4/6
I cannot in good conscience support a bill that completely ignores all those who were devastated by disasters in 2018. We cannot continue to kick the can down the road on disaster funding. 3/6
It includes no money for Hurricane Michael disaster relief, does not seriously address the humanitarian crisis at our border, &amp; was finalized at the last minute with little time for members to review the details. 2/6

We cannot allow our military and national security to be held hostage by those who want to continue the reckless spending of the last administration. This is not how our government is supposed to work, and I believe we need reforms in how the Senate treats appropriations bills.
When I ran for Congress I pledged to do all I could to begin rebuilding our military, and this bill accomplishes this critical task. I‚Äôm deeply disappointed that Senate Democrats refused to pass the defense bill the House has sent to them not once but four times.
Investing in our defense operations gives certainty to our warfighters on the front lines and strengthens our national security in a dangerous world. That‚Äôs why President Trump and Secretary Mattis strongly supported the budget agreement.
By reversing these damaging ‚Äúsequestration cuts‚Äù that have gutted our military and making necessary defense investments, we are beginning to repair a decade‚Äôs worth of damage.
Right now, we have ships that cannot go to sea, planes that cannot fly, and troops without the equipment they need to deploy.
It is wrong for us to send our best young men and women into harm's way without the resources they need, asking them to make up with their efforts, and their risk, for our shortcomings.
Congress has passed a budget deal to fully fund our military by reversing harmful ‚Äúsequestration cuts‚Äù and keep our government up and running.
It‚Äôs time for the Senate to get its act together. The House has passed full defense funding three times in the last year. And tonight, we will do it for a fourth time. #SetOurTroopsFree https://t.co/S7OEqLPqhn

My full statement on the release of the memo --&gt; https://t.co/PAOS3FaNBq
The American people deserve transparency and releasing this memo is a step in the right direction in restoring faith in our justice system.		I urge Attorney General Sessions to continue doing all he can to ensure each and every American receives equal justice under law.
There cannot be two standards of justice, one for Republicans and another for Democrats. We must return to a Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Department of Justice that we can trust.
President Trump made the right decision to allow for the release the memo to the American people. 		The memo demonstrates how politicized federal law enforcement had become during the Obama Administration. The police power of the state must be blind to politics.
It‚Äôs February and the tax cut law is delivering bigger paychecks. #CheckYourCheck		https://t.co/2kqmPPrfEb

A family of five earning $65,000 will go from owing $735 to Uncle Sam under current law to getting a $1,460 check from the IRS because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.		For instance: https://t.co/FkND9IoXxS
The bill replaces personal exemptions with a roughly doubled standard deduction, lower tax rates across-the-board, and a doubled child tax credit. This results in a lower overall tax bill.
A family of four making $55,000 will get a $1,500 tax cut. A single mother with one child making $30,000 will get an $800 check from the government.
The child tax credit is doubled to $2,000 per child ($1,400 of which is refundable, meaning you can benefit from it even if you have a negative tax liability and don‚Äôt owe the government any tax).
The bill cuts taxes for the middle class. The 15% bracket is cut to 12%. The 25% bracket is cut to 22%. The standard deduction (claimed by 81% of residents in Florida‚Äôs Second District) is roughly doubled to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. https://t.co/uPecHyFcVz
