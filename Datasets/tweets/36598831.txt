@CLRo777 Just a message to someone. Thank you for asking.
@astroeric12 @kdfree07 I think he can overcome the radical label. The dem part, I dunno. Many of the people that say ‚Äùvote blue no matter who‚Äù and talk of unity seem to be put off.
@WaPaRow @SocialPowerOne1 I like all of them, but support Bernie‚Äôs agenda. This country has moved far too right economically. It doesn't trickle; it can only be redistributed. I'll vote for the nominee regardless. Reasonable people can disagree.
@McClellandShane Yes, all links point to donation pages today. Money talks, and Sanders knows that. Tomorrow‚Äôs headline will be ‚ÄúBernie Raised More Money Than All Other Democratic Presidential Candidates.‚Äù
@WaPaRow @SocialPowerOne1 If he ran as an independent he would slit the vote and trump will win.
@McClellandShane It is just temporary - probably just up for today. you can see by what search engines have indexed over time rather than just what you see today. This is because how much money you raise on the day of the announcement determines how viable a candidate is going to be. https://t.co/xNmNo6VvSV
@WaPaRow @SocialPowerOne1 I'd rather he ran as democrat than as an independent. That really would be a disaster.

@CCXIII Ahh! You can't leave me here alone.
@CCXIII I see this more and more: black and white thinking - a cognitive error - causing cognitive dissonance resulting in rage.
@CCXIII People don't seem to grasp this basic concept: Two things can be contradictory and still be correct.  Both candidates were good candidates and both added value to the conversation. Both were also flawed. Ig isn't necessary to love one and hate the other.
@CCXIII For the most part, I see the rift healing. There are some who received their twitter notoriety during the 2016 primary. That is their shtick. It maybe more of a Twitter phenomenon. And life would be boring of everyone agreed with you all the time. How would you learn new things?
@CCXIII What the party used to be before ‚Äùtriangulation‚Äù and  ‚Äùthird-way politics.‚Äù The party of FDR.
@CCXIII My allegiance is not to the Democratic Party, it is to the leftist, it is to the party of FDR, it is to average working people. https://t.co/kuFG3WooHC
@CCXIII It is very demotivating. It should also be noted that those of us who supported Berine or Jill are the true believers, ie, the people that knock on doors, make phone calls, and write checks. Should be stop this obvious unappreciated work?
@CCXIII I have worked for and donated to the Democratic Party for 30 years. There is always hurt feelings after a primary but never has it been this bad.  I'm not sure how rehashing this over and over again helps anyone. I see how it hurts.
