@Swamy39 Stupid u need a killer
Opposition is clueless in the crisis as both big parties PML,N and PPP have soft corner for India and both parties leadership is corrupt and their only concern is to save their looted money at the cost of national interests.
Imran Khan conquered Indian hearts by releasing Indian pilot and Modi earned hatred for not accepting IK offer for rsumjng peace talks.
Imran Khan will sweep election in India aftrr Indian pilot released , if he desire to contest next indian election ,  Imran Khan is now prime minister of whole subcontinent and general Bajwa is army chief of whole subcontinent armed forces. All kudos to our leadership.
The whole Pakistan is standing behind Imran Khan in a war against India . Pakistani jawans will fight with India till it's dismantled .
Stupid man has stupid wish https://t.co/C44P5Stxsu
Pakistani opposition are dumbed and clueless in the face of IK statesmanship
PM Imran Khan outshines Modi in fees days war of nerves great leader and great preacher of peace.
Indian media should die in shame and humiliation which is ridiculing the good gesture of Imran Khan to release Indian pilot on humanitarian grounds.
PM Imran Khan is now strong contender for noble peace prize . He prove that he is great statesman and wants to establish peace in subcontinent ,All kudos for him .
