@CharlieCreme Not saying they are anywhere near level of uconn they aren't but the will to compete was there...also left out WVU who built up under carey
@CharlieCreme Uconn in AAC is anaomly that is problematic but can't punish uconn more worrying is there seems to be less upward attempts by the rest of aac, old big East most schools reacted by beefing up talent level...launched programs like Louisville RU and Stj don't see that in AAC
@CharlieCreme Fair enough and to me (throwing out oddities caused by Uconn in the AAC) we are seeing a clear AAA class in Mac Big East and WCC maybe valley  where consistently they are multi bid with good up and down team movement...hard to call mids but hard to ignore too (and beast is down)
@CharlieCreme I'd also say BYU but you have them on right side of bubble...as for p5 teams I don't like ASU this year I'm leery of teams who book but can't beat big opponents good scheduling good but wins need to matter at some point (note this is a seed beef not in out beef like ok last year)

@SherronShabazz I thought he was silly but respected his talent hated Paul bearer goofy...hated him in attitude era when they made him Satan.
@SherronShabazz One thing I'll agree with Heyman...how the fuck did herd miss on taker and let him walk to Vince...that talent in the talent driven WCW...how they not see that...he was leap frogging th LUGER clean at 6 10
@SherronShabazz Only time it worked was with UT and 1 it basically made him his new Andre (taker at that time was doing shit no one near his size was doing) 2 he had Paul bearer so over the top it lightened things up to work
@SherronShabazz Was most underrated heel of all time (namely stuck behind flair...then injuries) but all the time...weve discussed Henning...doink was unforgivable...hell the dutch and swagger tea party gimmick wouldve worked if they kept kayfabe (something dutch was good at) and kept them heel
@SherronShabazz Had piper face more than heel....which yes Crockett fell In that trap too but at least valentine was a legit motherfucker at that time...had the rougeaus real life assholes wasted as faces for 4 years till someone was like dummass French accents make great comedy heels
@SherronShabazz Oh I agree both are being wasted...badly...as babyfaces... just trying to think like Vince...mind you hes always had issues identifying natural heels...once had DIRTY DICK SLATER as a dukes if hazard face
@SherronShabazz Roode I think they see canadian technical who can get over on skill a la benoit and kidd which no...		Miz I think is just they dunno what to do with him and he does good behind scenes so roll with it (why zero kayfabe bad people...dont need to be the 70s but need some lines)

@SherronShabazz I didn't mind her when she was me Hughes type to blissy...but a joke as a face...and you need that confidence to be like I'm good enough people love me by hating me to be a good heel doesn't have that and she should be a heel
@SherronShabazz A fuckup...(getting compared to Mabel bad thing) b bad on Mic...c. Unlike snuka doesn't have balls to be a top heel imho.
@SherronShabazz I know üò†üò†üò†üò†
@SherronShabazz Yep...but if they pushed Jax . . . lol
@SherronShabazz So since I havent seen world of sport she could have been doing the screwdriver and just nerfed it enough to get past wwe
@SherronShabazz Niven impressed me most in first Mae young...IO in 2nd. But that Michanoku was wtf (tho someone else was using a vertabreaker but calling it a gory bomb
@SherronShabazz I agree a lot likely vince and hug were just oh another Brit üòë
@SherronShabazz Mind you sometimes size does make the move...had zero problem with the pearl river plunge when Ahmed did it when Toni storm does it as storm 0 scares he'll out of me for some reason
@SherronShabazz Mind you piper niven in a nutshell nia Jax with talent
@SherronShabazz Agreed question what about the Michanoku driver...when done by a little guy like taka it's not awful...but I saw Piper niven using it and holy cow basically Steiner screwdriver but from the center shocked even in a nxt tourney WWE allowed it

@SherronShabazz That would be been huge...but I can see vinces point rather have a midcard guy than half a tag team which used to be the classic JTTS set up have it be a legit match but they know the tagger is at a disadvantage so both look strong but the single gets a easy win
@SherronShabazz I did see the superstars match snake vs steamboat where steamboat parodied his gimmick with the baby gator (it was supposed to be a komodo dragon but guess they couldn't find one) it was good albeit short shit üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
@SherronShabazz And hes worked to improve which much respect for that
@SherronShabazz Oh sweet that woulda been epic
@SherronShabazz Yep I mean I missed out on 86-88 on snake aside from his WM matches which were not the best due to bad booking/opponents rude feud only thing I had of his best work and that didn't fit his character that well (I know the why lol)
@SherronShabazz Yep but his work while better still not top gun tho better than during his title run...can you imagine him as a manager just look how he got Reilly and sandow over as tag partners lol thats why the Jimmy Hart comparisons
@SherronShabazz Fair nuff but if you can't be spoiled on steamboat flair trilogy what can you be spoiled by...at least there is a hidden gem of a SNME 12 min savage BRET (!) Match that helped could only wish steamboat bret or steamboat owen/benoit
RT @SherronShabazz: @Starkman55 i agree. let everyone be themselves. and if they cant talk, get them a manager.
@SherronShabazz Miz including career path reminds me of a modern Jimmy Hart always have said that when he was butchering the diva search that he'd be a good Jimmy Hart type
@SherronShabazz Right and there are wrestlers now who would be managers in 80s (MIZ) but also guys like English blissy etc
@SherronShabazz Yeah see I saw end of road squashed by taker and fat jesus preaching smashed by austin jake not old time jake so thats why I put rude above as a worker but to me they're close...agree on sting match I've seen better steamboat plus thats when they were making rude flair lite lol
@SherronShabazz At all its the biggest issue corny once circulated a con video 4 years ago of reigns and Rollins just cutting on each other and corny was like god if you let him talk maybe fans would give him a chance lol lol
@SherronShabazz He somehow made warrior believable lol He was borderline but so was snake (tho that was for other reason) admit he got exposed on wcw by 80s wwf standards he was a good worker he was nothing in wcw
@SherronShabazz Miz' promos on cena were good...some Rollins but again why scripted promos bad outlines abd guidelines good
@SherronShabazz 2011...2013 was AJs pipe bombshell which im shocked got approved basically self buried all her opponents!
@SherronShabazz Agree to point bur as good as they were in the ring flair and savage would be half the men they were without some good promos can't be shit in ring and then cut nasty shit (HOGAN) while vice versa ok for me and do both equally like flair arn snake (when sober) rude legends
@SherronShabazz I am mostly for the moves but especially heels I don't mind a good hot promo...thats the art of it to me
@SherronShabazz Mind you I remember miz SOMEHOW getting shots at cenas moveset onto a SCRIPTED promo dunno how he did that but thats shit WWE needs going all austin not great but puked when fans chanted that's too far at Mahal for a mild asian joke at nakamura. Wanted to chant "that's the point"
@SherronShabazz And see I don't mind some of that...i think the PG PC is a part of wwe issue...RA era and late 80s wcw/jcp (minus the race comments) is a good landing spot attitude era too far but RA late 80s maybe SMW good examples of how you don't need to be pottomouthed to get ppl riled up
@SherronShabazz I mean I remember funk calling Steamboats kid a half breed on air...to set up an in between Clash match not even a ppv lol lol
@SherronShabazz Yep I saw I was looking at the std joke (don't mind that I'm not PG)  not the OP lol...i mean I'm not a yim fan but I can deal with it esp with a ex mma I've seen worse but maybe I'm just a bit old school didn't mind the hard verbal gut punches as long as it set up a good match
@SherronShabazz Didn't see the line crossed but I can be missing something

This is not some reinvent the wheel...i did this 4 times 3 on the chief once on the zephyr what is new is making it less about the transit and making the transit the destination..and a need too...very hard to really see middle America even for Americans and yes much to see
I've always said there is no great way to cross section America as a week or 2 week vacation...rail excursions would fix this imagine a weekly 7 or 10 day cross country trip...day stops in major cities or places like aspen arches and frand canyon...the routes exist!
I've said it before the plan amtrak has is good but for the long distance trains what they need is to partner with a cruise or vacation operator and sell them as journeys across America...can charge more have on board and keep the long routes while investing in needed corridors https://t.co/mF0IvPTEuh
