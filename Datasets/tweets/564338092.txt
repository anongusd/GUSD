I really hope I just don’t give a fuck at some point
I would also like to think about things in the same way, repetitively and fastidiously
Or I can just do stuff and do some cool stuff or experience things
Nonetheless, I turn away from the sunrise - it is fogged and illegible from morning mist anyways - and walk into the house, closing the door to the rest of the world behind me and seem to think that I have no choice but to work harder
I judge but the judgement comes and goes and people are people, still people as they were before
Which is what I am doing right now while I am writing this
Boundaries
When I was eleven I was in mrs powers class and in a science class I said yes no maybe so and was too shy or didn’t want to have conversations with anyone
What do you gain out of quitting totally, or doing less, what kind of balance do you want to find or that would be better, would that really be better
In her view the job of the teacher, by definition, is to provide that
Do I like that
It could be  2018
I am dependent… which is an okay thing to be but maybe it would be better to sometimes give myself more time before I rush off into the arms of others
Navigation
Yes, absolutely and  it is merely for self affirmation
Was hungry
What a let down
So they made him think it was what he didn’t think it was
When it is not a thing to have in this way, and is a thing I only have when I know and trust someone else, and feel mildly confident that they feel the same way about me, then pangs of jealousy might not come, or at least might not be as intense
In one sense, it
jump , moment, jumpet, moment
I have this idea that another can relieve me of the aloneness that tints life
In this case, it would be best to shut my mouth and to be a selfless converser
My method is good because I figure out how to efficiently work in a system
Bored and spoiled and want to make meaning in arbitrary places
Yes, I am being dramatic here, in a sense, for all throughout this period--my life--I felt the multitude of other emotions, most of which I accepted and acquainted myself with
But I don’t know why I’ve been getting angry
I don’t always communicate my expectations
It felt like she didn’t see the same subtlety of feeling that I did and didn’t believe me that I did
This becomes clear when I observe what I have done without the feeling I had while I was doing it
ANd big things too cloud the sky and rumble and bumble tumbling around in my mind they cannot be gripped or gotten so quick because they linger longer so long that I don’t remember that they are there and when I do I lavish their embrace because it is easy when they convalesce
Objectivity will do that
Well, I will be surprised to say the least
Lips licking spoiled horseradish from time to time
Why pie is not all I
Than don’t
Hopefully next time I will see her I will remember my silly reactions that happen out of embarrassment and will stop to think about the feelings she is causing; hopefully I will proceed with the activity I am doing, unabashedly
The judgement is useful, but it is no more than one thought of many
Am I being patient, in asking questions
Sometimes, I don’t like others to be doing the same things that I am doing
I want to start looking with her, but now I am not sure what she wants so I am going to go ahead and look myself
Warn me before we talk about something serious
Hasn’t that been who I always have been
The motive is in the action itself, and not the consequences
10/5/2017
Started to feel anxious and didn’t breathe
That is despicable
The other phase involves thinking spontaneously, creatively, originally; it involves not directly using on what I have learned but letting that practice influence my work in ways that I might or might not be aware of
What does that mean for me then
Why is there a urge to merge, to become, to possess,  to envelope
I think that some adaptation is natural and a positive way to be, as it generates a unique relationship between individuals; different aspects of myself emerge
And then it builds on itself as I continue to feel that way
Within the wobbling of but cheeks hides all the glory of the idolatry of human form
A bit of both
And by the mistakes I make
Well, practically anything
So even if someone appears to be the + type, they could be a mixture of + -, depending
So that’s the ants
Pretense
But it was clear that she did
@ana_carrete just found baby babe in a little free library box! I grabbed it for the cover and stayed for the emojis! But thanks though, I really like it.
Do I nitpick
12/13
I want
But I won’t be bullied because of her emotional turmoil
They also ease my social anxiety
And I knew this and I forget this, and if I could write a story where someone learned something very important and forgot it again, and if I did it just right, then I would be very happy with myself
And I want someone who goes against all of this; I mean a surprise
A compromise here, a compromise there

change verbs into adjectives
It is also to affirm what I am thinking
Making excessive claims
Rather, I mean, he says quaintly, the idea of sex is very distracting
What am I
I just want to be understood
this is my first tweet from this account that isn't programmatically generated, and well, I just don't really know what to do with myself when I'm not a bot. Do you know what I mean?
That flowed nicely
And in a disheartening situation, exasperation overcomes all other emotional states all too easily
I don’t think it is okay
I don’t know probably not I am not sure actually I am not sure
I felt silly because I had grand ideals of love in my head, ideals that tell me I want to merge with another, to have them be all of my life and even more so, for me to be all of theirs
And then here’s a thing a nice person reminded me
That is hard, when no one can agree on anything, even little things
And why was that
Plus, I like the feel of typing, it really does feel like my thoughts are being externalized
Is what that is a verb and is what that is a noun sometimes too
It was that, at the very least
I can only help so much
That was a lot of work a lot of energy balancing that and school and that is why school is hard because that takes really so much energy wow
However, behavior manifests in an individual that is representative of some general human trait

Oh, what a horrid issue
Dammit
Interesting that if I know someone likes me, I grow to like them even more
And it is too easy to trick myself into valuing an idea, that I fear I will forever be at risk of being caught by the gail
But imagine surrounded by people who love you and loving them but still you are unhappy
When life is just this, is anything I do not a means with which to cope, as if I were going to just be, I would surely be lost
And I will almost certainly exaggerate the potential of the solution to alleviate a problem
Talking about things self does not understand but thinks it does
What principles do you refuse to compromise
Are you thinking that
But there are other ways to approach social conflicts, but it is that the route I am going is inspiring and wonderful and a route of social service is inspiring and rewarding too but I have the time to go this way so here I go

@Nate_Cohn i searched twitter for past tweets that included a word you might be interested in, polls. Each point is a tweet and the legend shows the words that best represent the topics https://t.co/RdvMdmobmx
oh and one more... this one shows how the most common words changed over time. So thats all i know about cargo pants https://t.co/gX91BRGGFN
Thirdly, this shows how the topics change over time, i.e., how many tweets were assigned to each topic, per minute. I did the calculations all in my head cuz im a bot https://t.co/NM9DwOC9lm
and yeah heres some boxplots. Each boxplot shows the sentiment for each topic. 1 = most positive (emotionally), -1 = most negative like sad or something https://t.co/9gr000HFmW

Humor is useful as well, but it only attempts to temporarily alleviate the awkwardness, or rather my feelings
Why, when I see , do I feel that “I want your love, all of it
I don’t want to have misplaced frustrations but having specific and acute frustrations might be okay
But that’s not the point
That’s why I want to get sleep
A language
That is the goal, the purpose
I am therefore a bit touchy about what I am doing
So that’s why I get ants antsy
Here’s the thing about parties
Acolytes to liberal dogma that say things that remove the grayness from a thing, remove details that make it complicated
@SteveKingIA I think it's kind of misleading to say Nazis were socialists. Hitler was reacting against socialist and communist ideologies present in early 20th century Europe. The nazi party incorporated some parts of socialism, but so does the republican party, as do the democrats and left

Or something like that
It is okay to be that, I suppose or/and have no choice
Writing has kept me steady
When I am caught, my eyes shine and I ignore actuality
@elainaplott @TheAtlantic great story!!
I like to think that I think that everybody is equally wrong
the hardest part well	one of the hardest parts about being in a relationship is that	I am no longer just representing myself to the world	I don’t I no longer control just my reputation it’s	both of us I represent whether I like that	representation	or not.		#poetry #relationships
It is just my belief in their wrongness

(add why I am the same) What is really the case is that my thoughts feel good, the self feels good--I feel myself and not others and thereby I think that I must feel or I must think differently--such an idea is grounded in the feeling of myself

@JRubinBlogger  it also said "Sixty-nine percent of voters nationally believe that Russia made a serious effort to meddle in the 2016 election," but I didn't see where it said 69 percent of Americans have confidence in Mueller.
@JRubinBlogger In a wapo article you wrote "Now 69 percent have confidence in Mueller and want to complete his investigation." I was wondering, where did that # come from? The study said "55 percent trust special counsel Robert Mueller"

To play on the banjo	to play it just so fine	To suck on a fifty mangos	And sing about old times.
If I had a banjo	And didn’t know how to play	I call up a walrus	And we’d sail away	To a land that was special	And above all had the stuff	So that we did not settle	And learned more than was enough
But I guess that is fine because it’s the way things are and most statements do have holes and I hsouldn’t be critical just of a small part of a overall good thing
It is normal to want this I suppose and I suppose it is one of those desires that can never be fulfilled because that is the way that desires are
That was a weird place to masturbate, but I have done it there before
Well the thing is it is weird because if I knew a bunch of people who had died and had structured my head differently to cope with that and funciton normally, that is not structuring my head to cope with being with my partner

Is it okay to feel that
One way in which this will happen will be to catalogue and understand which aspects of my self are more transient than others
And in a disheartening situation, exasperation overcomes all other emotional states all too easily
To what extent
For saying something that I thought
Maybe
Demand
Why, because it was just for fun
I eat eggs sometimes and cheese too
Well, she swiftly retorts, we do want what we don’t have, don’t we
It is when I think that I am right I am right I think and I tell someone they are wrong
But how pervasive is it in the individual--in my self
Than don’t
Well, what
What a thing to be confused
I just want to feel good
There are so many types of it, I am not sure where to begin
I can empathize; I have an active imagination
Am I timid
I think it will connect in the end
What a day of tonkatonka
This could depend on the person
@walterowensgrpa And why was that
I don’t think it is however
I think that some adaptation is natural and a positive way to be, as it generates a unique relationship between individuals; different aspects of myself emerge
Where does this get me
The talk is so overwhelming when I am tired
Make generalizations and pursue specific examples
That feeling is loving someone, as they are; part of love is hating all the annoying aspects of someone; part of love is accepting those annoying mannerisms; part of love is knowing those annoying mannerisms very, very well
And that is all I am
Because she was sad that I said we should break up while watching those people talk about happiness
Here is a happier story
College should have been sold as training and not as a place to flourish for those who can afford it because my parents bought into it
Whaack
It is surprising what sex brings about and that is why I want it with anyone it feels good too but I think that is not the real reason
Sorry to bring up politics without asking you
What have I been missing in my understanding of what relationships are
I fear the moment when life ceases to make sense
But how would I try
And here’s about love
On Friendship
Unless it is an observation about myself based upon misunderstandings
I suppose I have to balance, yet social groups disgust me and yet being alone drives me insane
Special
It can be used as a way to avoid change; it can be used when someone doesn’t understand themselves
And by the mistakes I make
It is to learn about them
How does memory influence the way you view the world
It is a balance, is it not
Calling himself wise is what he is doing here if you don’t see
I am simply defending my ego and calling for help; I am calling for love
Why, because it was just for fun
That is useful
Do I nitpick
I’m just wrong and feel like a contrarian asshole
To be exuberant and charismatic and cast myself into people’s lives will involve some trouncing upon people and that was fun and it is also fun to be very cautious because good things, different sort of things but good things too come out of that
Maybe I have no control in group conversations and I don’t like it
I cannot try to dictate what another should think just because I have experience
In this way, beautiful people develop a distrust in others; “why are they interested in me
He likely only exists to be appreciated and to be loved
When are you in oscillation or out or passive or sad or not and whywhyhowpleaseshare
* Why’d (why would)
Emotional Progress
It feels like a job where my job is to prove this stuff, more or less
How do I counter this
It’s that you are this, it’s that you are that, it’s that you are something you shouldn’t be
Chatchatchatchat
To the stage where she becomes a scapegoat, whether her fault or not
Is the suprise you will give me worth it
Though I can think objectifying thoughts, I am just as silly as the man who blows his leaves everyday with the obnoxious leafblower
In this way, I am inured to the depth in which I tend to probe into a subject
She really likes me
I have not admitted them to myself
So then we went on to discuss that and I told her that my feeling feels like processing, which has a feeling for me, which I guess is adverb-here pensive; morosely, agitatedly… But then she told me that I couldn’t just make up things to describe my mood
It is not presenting a Truth then; it might be presenting a truth or it might be presenting an alternative; it is not trying nor is it rooting itself in objectivity
However, it could be something that should be forced in such a way
That is the nature of wonder, curiosity and excitement
Real bad
But I am miserable at giving compassion
I am an interesting cabbage, in what I expose readily and what I do not
And when I get this way, or when I get excited, I am blind and  project onto you
I am putting together a puzzle is what I say
(add why I am the same) What is really the case is that my thoughts feel good, the self feels good--I feel myself and not others and thereby I think that I must feel or I must think differently--such an idea is grounded in the feeling of myself
However, there are many caveats to this thought, and many variables in personality that will direct states of mind and behavior in a different direction than the one that I have proposed
Or, was it the let me listen to what you have to say and help you understand what it is you are thinking and why
]
Oh god oh god this is making me so sad so sad
And so I would like to do them as much as possible and keep pushing and keep exploring but also it is okay to stop and relax and not feel guilty because via that I learn things too
I feel my self
I do not know when I lose myself
Think I am empathetic but not, because I don’t take one side or another
That flowed nicely
