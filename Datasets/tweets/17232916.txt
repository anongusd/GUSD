If you get stuck and have to do something impromptu, asking questions is your friend:	• public speaking? Interview yourself 	• mtg w ppl? Ask them questions	• lost? Ask someone for help
Stuff to try today:	1) try more humility today than yesterday 	2) try assuming better of others today than yesterday 	3) try deferring more to give others a chance today than yesterday 	4) try listening more today than yesterday 	5) try praying more today than yesterday
Strategic planning and development starts with strategic thinking. It won’t always be organized. It starts with questions and more questions. It doesn’t assume things. It doesn’t even assume that the right questions are being asked yet.

10/ To walk in the truth I need to get off of wrong trails which means I need active repentance and discipline.
9/ Imagine cities full of families full of dads and moms who do real and actual daily repentance.
8/ Some repenting is easier than other repenting. All repenting is needful. “Big” or “small.”
7/ “Spirit, where do I need to repent?” is a prayer that’ll serve me everyday of my life.
6/ Legit repentance gets me under a better ruler and master.
5/ Repenting isn’t bad. Repenting is good.
4/ Active repentance is crucial to being an actual disciple.
3/ If I want to grow, I need to know how to be an actual and active repenter.
2/ “I did some repenting today and it was good,“ is a phrase I need to be saying every day of my life.
1/ I did some repenting today and it was good.

Where sin runs deep Your grace is more	Where grace is found is where You are	And where You are, Lord, I am free	Holiness is Christ in me
Lord, I need You, oh, I need You	Every hour I need You	My one defense, my righteousness	Oh God, how I need You
Lord, I come, I confess	Bowing here I find my rest	Without You I fall apart	You're the One that guides my heart
Teach my song to rise to You	When temptation comes my way	And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You	Jesus, You're my hope and stay

Cast your deadly “doing” down— 	Down at Jesus’ feet; 	Stand in Him, in Him alone, 	Gloriously complete.
Till to Jesus’ work you cling 	By a simple faith, 	“Doing” is a deadly thing— 	“Doing” ends in death.
Weary, working, burdened one, 	Wherefore toil you so? 	Cease your doing; all was done 	Long, long ago.

He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of Thy people was He stricken.
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto His sorrow!
Thy rebuke hath broken His heart; He is full of heaviness.
He gave His back to the smiters, and His cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: He hid not His face from shame and spitting.
He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.

But, through thy free goodness, my spirits revive,	And he that first made me, still keeps me alive.	(2/2) http://t.co/nw9Rj8207I
Without thy free mercy I could not live here	Sin soon would reduce me to utter despair; (1/2)
@trillianewbell here's a thought: what if someones like @timkellernyc or @CrawfordLoritts or @NancyDeMoss did a teaching series based on it?
Come, ye thirsty, come, and welcome,	God’s free bounty glorify;	True belief and true repentance,	Every grace that brings you nigh.
Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,	Weak and wounded, sick and sore;	Jesus ready stands to save you,	Full of pity, love and power.
Let not conscience make you linger,	Not of fitness fondly dream;	All the fitness He requireth	Is to feel your need of Him.
I will arise and go to Jesus,	He will embrace me in His arms;	In the arms of my dear Savior,	O there are ten thousand charms.
Come, ye weary, heavy laden,	Lost and ruined by the fall;	If you tarry till you’re better,	You will never come at all.
hankering 	fried pickles, 	fried okra, 	fried catfish.

A moralistic lifestyle is not what God desires from you. It is not what pleases a holy and a righteous God. http://t.co/FbAP3SjdUH
Lord, revive our hearts to go blissfully to sleep trusting that you've got this thing - every thing - covered.
Lord, revive our hearts to get that our approval with You is all through Christ and what He's done vs. anything we've done, do or muster up.
Lord, revive our hearts and replace our grumbling with gratefulness.
