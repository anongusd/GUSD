What a remarkable end to the Cruz-Trump fight. Booed off the floor by Trump delegates for failing to endorse. But likely not the end.
Those boos for Cruz. Not exactly the response to Reagan at the '76 convention.
Trump campaign asked Matt Scully, John McConnell to draft Melania speech. They did. Speech Monday bore almost no resemblance to the draft.
Another delegate accuses Mike Lee of "sour grapes." He says, "For what, for asking for a roll call vote?"

After much debate, RNC rules committee rejects proposal to ban lobbyists from being members of the national committee.
Sharp debate at GOP rules committee over whether paid lobbyists (excluding those for non-profits) can be members of the national committee.
Spicer says no deals and not clear whether negotiations are really ongoing. Says unbinding not part of talks.
"That is the motion before the body. Is there anybody besides me who is confused?" says rules committee chair Enid Mickelson.
Rules committee has quickly descended into parliamentary weeds. Meanwhile negotiations continue behind closed doors.

@samrhall @clarionledger  Well deserved.
Congrats to @samrhall @clarionledger for smart coverage of the race watched round the country.
Mississippi GOP establishment spent much of today in fetal position. Tonight: dancing in their houses.
Cochran victory a tribute to his expand-the-electorate strategy.
Cochran leads by 4455 with 98% of precincts in. He leads in Hinds by 10,965 with 117 of 118 precincts in.
For Cochran, Hinds, Hinds, Hinds.
News we can use! RT “@DavidLauter: Meantime, election geeks, Anthony Rendon just hit a homerun in top of 8th to tie the game, 2-2.”
On 6/3, Hinds and Madison gave Cochran margin of 8722. Tonight with almost all in, his margin is 15,003.
Nothing reported from small Holmes County, which gave Cochran a 620 vote margin on 6/3.
With one box out in Jones, McDaniel is at 82%. Got 85% on 6/3. Vote total up a bit, not dramatic.
Key for McDaniel: Are areas where he is doing better than 6/3 voting at similar or lower numbers? Cochran has upped turnout in his key ctys.
For McDaniel, DeSoto overperforming, Jones underperforming. He needs big boost from Jones.
McDaniel wins Hancock County on the Gulf Coast with 51.7%. Cochran won it on 6/3 with 51%. Overall vote down.
Cochran generally better in the Delta and Hinds than 6/3.
McDaniel running behind 6/3 pace in crucial stronghold of Jones County. Got about 85% on 6/3 v 80.5 with 2/3 counted.
Cochran also running 2 points better than 6/3 in Madison County north of Jackson with 90% counted.
Cochran only ahead 82 in Jackson along the Coast. McD by 328 votes on 6/3. Cochran targeted shipyards.
McDaniel running a little ahead of his 6/3 percentage in DeSoto stronghold with less than half precincts in.
For Cochran, Hinds much better than 6/3. Won by 5300 votes then. With 1/2 precincts in, he's got a 4900 vote margin.
In Pearl River County, early numbers show McDaniel % slightly larger than 6/3.
In MS, lacking numbers from DeSoto and Jones counties, which together gave McDaniel a 13,000 vote margin over Cochran.

@SusanPage  You're right. Up tempo!
Clinton says no rush to make a decision about 2016 because of grandbaby on the horizon.
Clinton favors "automatic registration" for voting at age 18.
"We don't agree in lockstep," Clinton says of Bill Clinton. She says it keeps the conversation going.
Clinton says some opposition to Obama is "virulent" but won't generalize on whether race is one reason.
Clinton on how to deal with Putin: "patience and persistence and strength."
"Difficult to gauge how I was presenting myself and how it was perceived," Clinton says of 2008 campaign.
Clinton on running and governing: "Some people can paint a beautiful vision [but] can you lead us there?"
Clinton: I can be flattered. I wish it would happen more often."
"I've gotten better... I had to get better." Clinton on taking criticism.
@mollyesque  Yes, you do.
"Intense. Passionate. Service-minded."  How Clinton describes herself.
Clinton cautious about proposed paid family leave. Calls it "unfinished business" but would leave it to states now.
Clinton wary of recreational pot use: Wants "to wait and see" the evidence is. I didn't do it when I was young. I'm not going to start now."
"My views have changed over time," Clinton says about gay marriage. "I evolved over time."
@camanpour to Clinton: Was this a failure? "I think it's too soon to tell," Clinton says.
Should you have tried harder on Syria? "We pushed very hard," Clinton says. Obama resisted. "The buck stops with the president."
Would earlier help for Syrian rebels, as she recommended, have prevented what's happening now? Clinton isn't sure.
"We are certainly not putting any soldiers at risk" in Iraq, Clinton says on @CNN.
Failure to get an agreement to keep U.S. troops in Iraq was a mistake by Iraqi government, Clinton says on @CNN.

@tibor75 FDR was already president when s reelected to a 3rd and 4th term. Was talking about someone new succeeding a 2-term D president.
True, but wasn't prez. MT “Gore was the only case where a D won the popular vote following 2-term D POTUS.”
“@bendgibbons: @danbalz Does Truman count?” No, he was already president.
Looking to 2016, was the last time a D president was elected to follow a two-term D president way back in 1836? Van Buren after Jackson?

Gov. Jindal on Perry's prediction about POTUS and Keystone: "Rick's a lot more confident than I am."
Rick Perry on Keystone: "The president is going to approve the XL pipeline. Write it down."
GOP governors sharply criticize President Obama for his tone at morning meeting with all govs. They say he doesn't trust the states.
