@pmurnion @hiltandchuckdog @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro Again, you can't just say you are President and have it be so. Just because the US recognizes it, doesn't make it so.
@hiltandchuckdog @pmurnion @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro I would prefer the UN have a trial, or new trials protected by the UN. Innocent until proven guilty, so Maduro would stay in charge. 		Until a crime has been proven, I do not believe fake news or CNN or any news org that will say He "usurped" power without proof.
@Forrestgun1977 @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro okay bot
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul All.
@kashthefuturist Or, in reality:		https://t.co/bTRlVqnlf8
@LifeNewsHQ The Bush's have fallen too far. Glad that Dynasty is no longer in power.
@asllv No thanks.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul If anyone is to blame, it's Congress. They set the laws, the allowed bad behavior to exist, and they have made it legal for Trump to use the law to re-allocate funds as He wishes.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Pandora's box has been opened, and Congress (by not doing anything for 30+ years) has set case law to allow for National Emergencies to be a procedure, and not respected by temporal law.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul March 15, 1995: The National Emergency With Respect to Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources was an effort to prevent potential deals between oil companies.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Jan. 2, 1995: The National Emergency With Respect to Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process placed economic sanctions in response to the Jerusalem bombing.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Nov 14, 1994: The National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, that combined two previous national emergencies focused on weapons of mass destruction.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul And these.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul If we're being honest, then why don't we shut down this "emergency" 		Nov 14, 1979: The National Emergency With Respect to Iran, in response to the Iran hostage crisis.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul But we should strive to be honest, Rand is not being honest; at all.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul If the law causes damages. Then we can all take it to court, OR, Congress can use the law, and stop it. All I'm saying is it's within the law; being honest doesn't always lead to the outcome you want.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul A National Emergency is a short-cut to get funds moved around to achieve something. What would the national emergency fund or change? Forcing everyone to what? Stop using Gasoline? To walk to work? What exactly would they use the law for?
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul And if the President finds a way to legally re-allocate money, then that's within the law.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul The original tweet was about constitutionality. And I've proven that is it within the Constitution, and of course, existing laws.		You're referencing withholding funds, which is another debate topic.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Again, protecting the people is within the law. Allocating money via other laws, is within the law.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul ...from the treasury - do you think there's money there still? Is it still in the treasury once it's been sent to a department under the executive branch?
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul And this is what executive power is:		https://t.co/dr6xXPoMiW
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here: The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul So once money is allocated, is it in the treasury? Or is it already allocated and at the discretion of the agency of which the money was already give?
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Technically, there is never going to be money in the treasury; the money has been gone for years.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; a
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul "raising revenue" is taxes. Not exact allocation of what agency did what with what money.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here: 		All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.
@hiltandchuckdog @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro At the end of the day, I do not care much about the situation because it's not my country. But I wouldn't let a guy say he's president when he wasn't voted in.
@hiltandchuckdog @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro so everyone is pointed a finger at the guy, but nothing has been proven one way or the other. I would be deeply upset if Hillary claimed to be President because of "russia"
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Congress has power to raise revenue. That doesn't say Congress has to control money that has already been appropriated for various agencies that are under the Presidents branch.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Where does it say He can't get money from one agency and use it for another agency?
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Where does it say He can't move money around that was already appropriated, and under His control?
@Funwithpaul @Barnes_Law yet we're spending more than under Obama
@ElChongoEniLuCp @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro Where does it state that someone can just claim to be President?
@hiltandchuckdog @SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro did that get proven in court based on their laws?
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here's more: The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here's where Trump is required to enforce the laws:		he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here's where Trump is in charge of all military:		The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here's where Trump is obligated to enforce the Constitution:		"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Here's something that says the States can join forces and "wage war" on illegal immigration:		another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul Caravans of people breaking into a country counts as an invasion.
@ScottMcMurtrie3 @RandPaul It's the role of the US Congress (Government) to repel invasions:		To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;
@Barnes_Law Consistent in that He's weak, and wrong?
@BernieSanders There are Red states, blue states. Let's focus on reality. Gov. makes people poorer. We need less Government so people can build their own wealth.
@RandPaul You must be new. Trump has the Constitution on His side. Furthermore, Trump is using Emergency Powers as intended by law. 		Maybe it's time to pass a law that fixes the issue? Maybe something that prevents National Emergencies from being renewed each year?
@RealJamesWoods @KokeReport It's the culture of that area, not necessarily Islam. We need to be careful, or else we end up being just as bad as the bad guys. 		This video is terrible. But if we get Capitalism over there, so these people can become educated, and see that it's wrong; that's how we win.
Even with several TV shows designed to make Hillary look good, the American voters said: No Hillary.		People are starting to see through the Democrat lies.
@jmillerlewis @KyleKulinski @BernieSanders @RoKhanna who got a raise?
@SenRickScott @jguaido @NicolasMaduro Just to be a Devil's Advocate, if that guy did that in the US; he would (at least should) have been arrested for causing an insurrection. Here: https://t.co/F4eCpBZFxk		If we are to be honest, Maduro has every right to arrest Guido.

@MikeMeservy @ConfuseTheRight @RoyalCoug @NelsonRussellM Did you know Jo Smith had all those extra wives, after speaking a month earlier that He could only find one?

@BostonBikers @SleazyBae I'm amazed
@glennbeck Isn't that the world Facebook &amp; Google want to impose on Americans? Seems like that's how things are going for the US.
Let's not point out Hillary's track record, and let's totally ignore that the Media has interviewed plenty of the Dodge-Caravan to know that they're NOT seeking asylum. This is an army of mostly military-aged men, waiving a foreign flag, trying to enter the US illegally. https://t.co/CRU1jNN5Z1

@getongab they invested in infrastructure

@JackPosobiec Might not have actually voted, but that doesn't stop someone from being a groupie. Any rock star should be honest and admit that not all groupies are attractive
@ChatByCC It's not for the attention, it's so there's documented proof when something like Cesar happens. His Twitter "profile" was either fake or by a retarded person, with no record of it existing prior other than 1k+ followers; which means it was renamed for the "bomb" hunt.
@ChatByCC I say add them to a list and document their profile.
@JeffFlake Republicans do not need spineless Flakes, please retire so that stronger and callous Republicans can help make America better.
@JeffFlake If he's putting "bomb" in quotes, then he must know something you're too involved with to be open and honest about. The whole thing smells fishy, defies logic, and timed to help motivate Democrats to go vote.

@justearlh @Fuctupmind and no duct tape
@ChelieinTX Um, since when do old ladies like you talk like that?
@Fuctupmind they're worried the stickers will fade within the day
@rmck51337 @Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull Also, before I go watch Netflix, if he worked for the Seminoles, they would know him, and he wouldn't be living in a van. They would also have his plate on file because Hollywood records every plate for several months. Lots of data to dig through.
@rmck51337 @Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull There are cameras on almost every major light in Florida. "They" can just look at the recordings and trace his every move. If recordings go missing, then we know there's something Hillary going on.
@rmck51337 @Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull I think he would have been fine in the area he's at. Plantation has a lot of Trump supporters. Hispanic Democrats are not the Liberal nut job Democrats that you see on TV. Aventura is a rich area. If he was a pizza guy in Hollywood, still would have been fine.
@rmck51337 @Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull Part of why I'm skeptical. You wouldn't be able to drive around with those stickers on the passenger window.
@rmck51337 @Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull But right now, all over the country, if you look minority, you're probably not going to get the same shit you did a few years back. Hence, a major reason crime rates are dropping in certain areas. Cops are still too scared to do anything. And DAs ...
@rmck51337 @Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull So there's the law and then there's what Cops actually enforce. In Florida, you can have tinted windows that only allow 15% sunlight, stuff that would be bad in other States. 		As for the stickers, if He was driving around, they would have gave him shit about it.
@texasborn81 @Don_Vito_08 @PattiLaudan Um most of the time yes. There's really no need to travel much with the internet and Ubereats, Netflix. Just watched Daredevil. What else do I need?

@Charlethewal @therealictinike @CalebJHull the driver side window maybe, you can have tinted windows and it's a van; probably a work van, so those side-back windows don't count much.
@KatTheHammer1 well it's safe in Florida but I'm still skeptical about the whole thing.

@soflashinobi @Thomas1774Paine Of course I'm not going to look into that stupid-ass story. I saw his "twitter" page before they deleted it, no record of the page with 1k follows. So the name changed today. It could have been a creepy dude's page, but no record online.

@McRocketscience Well, you're a bot, and you don't have a soul.
@Lrihendry And his twitter page is BS, not real. I'd be asking the Seminoles about the guy first. If he's a promoter for the Hard Rock and/or the place He works, then wouldn't it be a van full of something else.
@DavidCypkin also, people usually post photos to social media right when they take the photos. I mean, that's just how people are so...
@BillyCorben @DavidCypkin @FBI Even if those pictures are on the inside, the sun would have faded them by now. Seems like a pain to have someone replace those stickers every couple months.

@BernieSanders Hmm, aren't you a millionaire? Unless you give away most of your money, you are part of the problem.
@WayneDupreeShow Yeah, a lot of Democrats voted Republican. They're still learning what it means to fully transition over. But anyway, focus on the Florida Sun and Fading.
@TheSharpEdge1 Also, Florida. Those would have faded within a couple weeks.
@JackPosobiec interesting, so if he's republican, the facebook page stays up long enough to grab photos?

@Mydudetrump @VibeHi Well, think of what they promised you last election cycle? Now think of what they're going to give you next election cycle? That's a bribe, doesn't have to be stone cold cash. But it's a bribe.
@Mydudetrump @VibeHi Then you have mental health issues to address. There's nothing shameful in standing for life &amp; liberty. When you can overcome your disability, join the Republican party, they're on your side.
@Mydudetrump @VibeHi So don't worry, if someone hasn't tried to bribe you into their party, it'll happen again next election cycle. You'll get the attention you seek, and you will follow accordingly.
@Mydudetrump @VibeHi Republicans have fought for life, hence the civil war happening during Lincoln, and of course, Republicans fight for the un-born. Democrats have been consistent, Republicans have been consistent. What hasn't been consistent is the attention given to the attention seekers.
@Mydudetrump @VibeHi Yes, followers follow whatever is trending at the moment in time. Loyal followers, well, that's close, but at least they stand for something. The values have stayed pretty consistent for hundreds of years. Democrats started out killing Indians, continued slavery, Jim Crow, etc.
@McRocketscience what stereotype, you racist?
@Mydudetrump @VibeHi You should belong to a political party, as long as you stand for something. Independents tend to be followers and will only join the party that gives them the attention they seek. A party doesn't own you. It's what you join when you show the world you stand for something.

@Fuctupmind The other good thing about all the money she is raising is that Judge K. now has an nest egg to go after when he takes her to civil court.

@DLoesch Trump did, then came the never Trumpers. Roy Moore did, but no one supported him. Kavanaugh looks weak (physically), so Repubs will puppy dog him and support him.
@RandPaul Then why do we allow voter registration data to be leaked online? That data includes address and party affiliation; make voters targets. Why are Senators more important than voters?
Jeff Flake better man up.
@marcorubio You have the ability to show that you are smart enough to take over for Trump in 2024. Fix your hairline first of course, but then train your brain, and practice toughness. You could be President some day. But you're not ready yet with these tweets.
@marcorubio There is no reason to involve the wrong level of government (Federal), over a criminal act, committed in a State that has the ability to investigate. If Ford wants Justice, she can seek it. And if there is a crime, then Congress has the tools to handle the removal of Judge K.
@marcorubio There is no reason to delay a vote based on an investigation. Should Ford want to pursue an investigation, she can go to the local authorities and report the crime. Once that has been completed, you can take the situation more seriously.

@ChuckGrassley Should Ford have further concerns, she may continue on with her legal rights, after Kavanaugh is confirmed. We have the presumption of innocence in the US. It's part of our core, it's who we are. We can't lose sight of what makes America great.
@ChuckGrassley At the end of the day, this is a job interview. You have 35 years of confidence in Kavanaugh. Democrats have used this tactic before, and it won't be the last time they use it. But it can be the last time we fall for it.

@Cernovich I guess if all it takes is 100k to make new friends, why not? You only live once, that we know of. Everybody loves a party, and if you can rally the troops, go for it. Trump got the economy roaring by being positive. You can get the Repubs roaring with your events. Good!
true https://t.co/uJOqTIbdH5
@MattsOurSemite @pnehlen Yeah, don't think Paul's going to win. Maybe time to get another guy/gal to destroy Ryan.

Waywad Sisters was horrible, can't imagine this being a TV show #Supernatural
@Breaking911 That's awesome.
@JoyAnnReid Well when you put it like that, I'm not sure why more Democrats aren't in on it.
@SenSchumer It shows that you planned on shutting the gov down because you went through the trouble of putting this video together before it happened.
@JackPosobiec @Cernovich Looks kind of boring
@realDonaldTrump ** unchecked criminal immigration **
@RepBarbaraLee You do know how this works right?
@Health_n_Hubris .

@charliekirk11 It takes time to find out where they should go. Unless we set a default law that says when country of origin cannot be determined, we send them to some obscure country far, far away.
@DineshDSouza That's just such an insult, to horses
Hopefully Hawaii isn't using this as a ploy to Attack Trump.
@JohnKasich Americans are the Dreamers because we qualify for the American Dream. Other people can also, when they follow the law and become Americans.
@JohnKasich You mean illegals, don't you?
@Cernovich I feel you're overestimating Steve Bannon's popularity.
@NBCNews That'll be another several million cut from your budget
@WalshFreedom JFK probably did as well
@Ima_Deplorable @realDonaldTrump Or it was leaked to get Democrats on record praising those areas so that it's not "mean" to send these illegals back to those areas
Wonder what kind of dirt the NSA has on @SpeakerRyan because you know that stuff is leaking anytime now cc: @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
What about the American Dreamers? #DACADeal
@Cernovich I hope he does a Funny or Die response video that would pretty much give him a get out of jail free card.
Facebook wants your nudes, and to put cameras/microphones in your homes, yet people still use Facebook. Twitter is bigoted against Conservatives (and white people in general), yet Twitter still exists. Someone really needs to create a Twitter &amp; Facebook Alternative. #MAGA
Exactly https://t.co/gwG49iWEvK
Our President (@realDonaldTrump) doesn't represent illegals, even those Fake Dreamers. That's a huge mistake he's making, but he's the negotiation guy, so maybe it'll work out #MAGA

@ZionSunshine @MustangGirl3 @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure chocolate milk is the gateway drug for everything. Most cocaine users have started out with chocolate milk before they tried cocaine.
@Cernovich @realDonaldTrump Hopefully it just means we're going to legalize federally. Would be a HUUUGE mistake to go over pot after it's been legalized in a State.

@CNN This isn't something a news org should be reporting.
@Cernovich Not talking to a journalist based on skin color is pretty racist. You have the right to do what you want, that's what freedom and liberty is all about. But it's hypocritical for the Left to do that.
RIP Erica Garner
@Cernovich why?
@benshapiro He's a meanie.
@TonyTech310 Anybody that flops should be fined, and if it causes a team to lose a game, then the player should be suspended as well.
Marcus Smart should be suspended and fined 100k.
@GreyWolfwon @thebradfordfile I wasn't being serious.
@Cernovich Of course he's thirsty for media coverage, he's trying to be a politician. But now you're into the name calling thing, wonder if he didn't accept your hand shake.
@thebradfordfile What's VHS?
Roy Moore is fighting like every Republican should. He may not have won the Alabama Senate, but he's showing how tough he is. That should be respected. #MAGA

@RichardMadan Something shady went on with the votes.
@JoyAnnReid People are free to quit their jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Need full support of candidates. The Repubs turned on Roy Moore, just like they turned on you, for similar things. But you fought through it. Republicans need to be loyal to Republicans, like Democrats are to Democrats. Otherwise, what's the point of having a political party?

@sugabuttdiariez @kansasfemale @RepMaxineWaters I'm a fan of the 80s, manly because of the hair bands. Anyway, again, it's a slogan, and a very good one used by Reagan &amp; Slick Willy (Bill Clinton). Take it easy ma'am, it's Friday, relax, live a little.
@50inaug @RepMaxineWaters Back in the good ole days, people had a sense of humor.
@AP gonna make him a 6-time deportee?
@sugabuttdiariez @RepMaxineWaters haha it's just a really good slogan that causes people to think because lots of people tend to think of the past as the good ole days. But it's subjective and a thought exercise for the voters to decide. And they decided, Trump won.
@RepMaxineWaters Could be his voice, but maybe it was cut together? Billy Bush was in on it, so Billy ran and hid? Many things could have happened, but that was last year, and Trump won the election. Let's focus on #MAGA!
@President1Trump @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump Trump just suggested they look into the guy's past, something fishy going on there. Now we know who wears the pants.

@82jda @ScottChickee @CNNPolitics That was just a copy and paste from Google. From it, we gather, that Trump &amp; The Republican Voters are the Good Guys.
@82jda @ScottChickee @CNNPolitics Fascist traces to the Italian word fascio, meaning "group, bundle." Under fascist rule, the emphasis is on the group — the nation — with few individual rights.
@82jda @ScottChickee @CNNPolitics A fascist is a follower of a political philosophy characterized by authoritarian views and a strong central government — and no tolerance for opposing opinions.
