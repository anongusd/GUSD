If it was scheduled as a natural birth and they have to do an emergency c-section, the baby still lives. And you are correct!

Developing:		Empire actor forgot to tell the press, or the Police, that he was drunk and hit something in the icy steeets of Chicago. Whether he slipped and hit the pavement is open to interpretation, so instead of admit it and face embarrassment, he blames #maga.
@DavidRoseQ13FOX @BellinghamPD @catchwmw Did you hear about the bust in California today? I heard last year, they had another bust and caught 500 paedophiles. Kudos to them and to you and the crew at WWM!
Why are we not talking about placing U.S. troops in Columbia to aid the Colombian Government from keeping Venezuelan immigrants from coming to America? Columbia is fare game and will reduce the drug trafficking as well as citizens from a broken Socialist country.

@GovernorVA Liberals. If you see a pregnant woman, punch her in the stomach.
I've had an epiphany! 		Stupid Liberal states pass Satanic abortion laws, correct?		These states are sued winding up in the @Scotus and here's the kicker. 		Roe v. Wade was based on a false rape.		The SCOTUS reverses Rv.W and anyone who did an abortion is charged with murder.
