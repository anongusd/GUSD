Question about how we can direct finding to metro planning areas, rather than states?
And now onto the Q and A! #eesitalk
How can we do anything to make our bases and military less ready? Less resilient? We can see drought, glaciers melting, and more...
White House was considering resolution and judgment that climate wasn‚Äôt really a threat to national security, disregarding the judgment of Gen Mattis and so many others who are making their bases more resilient, which would create a vulnerability....
Conger: If the base is resilient and the community is NOT resilient, well the base is not really #resilient. #eeaitalk
What happens when your toilets on the base because a wastewater facility in the community isn‚Äôt working right? What about your civilian employees who all live in the communities? #eesitalk #ClimateSecurity
If Congress does an #infrastructure bill, think all of this. A lot of investment needed. In Alaska an Air Force base requested funding in the FY19 bill because permafrost is melting...this is happening TODAY. #eesitalk #ClimateSecurity
Conger‚Äôs second point: #climate doesn‚Äôt care about the fence line! That means the communities are under threat too and they need to be just as #resilient!
So much military infrastructure is just above sea level...
RT @iglitzin: @Jackson_Fdn @eesionline and @CntrClimSec livecast very informative on climate impact on military structures and installations
Tyndall and LeJeune have been devastated. $10 billion in damages!
Conger begins with his first point. Our bases are under threat! A wildfire in California is the last time a military facility had to be evacuated. #eesitalk #climatesecurity
Now @climatecliff introduces our final speaker for this #eesitalk, John Conger, Director of @CntrClimSec, and is former DOD official.
McFarlane mentions that communication is critical, and it has to be based on personal interactions and relationships #eeaitalk
Working on flood risk management. It is difficult to coordinate military construction and civil works funding right now. McFarlane argues this needs to change. #eesitalk
Coordination is absolutely critical to enhancing relationships, and from funding perspective it is good to be able to pool resources. #eesitalk
Another example: Norfolk airport wants to add another runway, but doing so would have some negative impacts on nearby military facilities.
McFarlane discusses water #infrastructure and storm water management. Water is moving between City of Hampton Roads and military installation, but Navy didn‚Äôt share data on water until recently. Data is really critical to effective local planning. #eesitalk
Read if you‚Äôre interested in today‚Äôs #eesitalk #ClimateSecurity https://t.co/RIyjIYjgJJ
Challenges for Hampton Roads communities include lack of usberara ding of installation missions and vice versa. Too often data isn‚Äôt shared. Priorities of community and military installations may differ. And there is just not enough $$ to address priorities.
#Resilience has been a focus in Hampton Roads for 10 years, one of the greatest concentrations of military installations in the country. #eesitalk

The @NatlHsingTrust has the largest solar use in public housing in the DC area! They are continuously trying to decrease the carbon footprint of federal housing! #energyefficiency #eesitalk
Federal housing programs have high construction standards but need to continue to focus on #resilient #infrastructure! This can only be accomplished through continuous  funding and support #eesitalk
‚ÄúOur climate is changing and these low income families have the most to lose.‚Äù -Eric Behna; This is why we have to protect programs like WAP and LIHEAP #eesitalk #energyefficiency
Question about climate change and how that affects these programs. Answer is that we need #resiliency! And the programs serve people who are most affected. They have the most to lose. Worst housing stock as far as drafts etc.
Now on to the QandA! First q from @ACEEEdc
The Weatherization + Health program goes one step further than regular weatherization programs by working to provide weatherization, health and social services to low income families #eesitalk

9 out of 10 people served by LIHEAP have a child, person with a disability, or an elderly person in the home. Most have income under &amp;20k per year. #eesitalk #LIHEAP #EnergyEfficiencyForAll
One out of three households that rely on LIHEAP went without food for at least one day in the past year. LIHEAP is a critical program and one that needs continuous funding #ProtectLIHEAP #eesitalk #energyefficiency
LIHEAP helps the most vulnerable American families to afford their home energy bills! But it needs your protection to keep funding going #ProtectLIHEAP #energyefficiency #eesitalk
What is an #energyburden? It‚Äôs the percentage of household income spent on #energy bills! It‚Äôs MUCH higher for low income households. #eesitalk #EnergyEfficiencyForAll
Now learning about LIHEAP, which started in 1981, enacted under Reagan w #bipartisan support. Not an entitlement program so dependent on annual appropriations. #eesitalk

Let's examine rates vs bills. #Virginia has some low utility rates. Baserates may be low, but any new gen or distribution plan, there is a "RAC" on the bill -- which adds to the bill. "Virginia's bills from 2007 to 2017 have jumped 43% in that decade" even though rates were low!

For the lowest income households, rental assistance from HUD and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (#LIHEAP) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  (#HUD) provide critical lifelines.
In addition, affordable-housing developers rely on the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (#LIHTC) to build and preserve energy efficient, multi-family affordable housing.
EEFA/ACEEE studies have found that the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs (@Energy) Weatherization Assistance Program, which retrofits single-family homes for people who live at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, saves families an average of $283 per year.
Making homes more #EnergyEfficient and reducing energy costs per square foot can reduce utility bills and lighten the energy burden for low-income families and individuals; improve their comfort, health and quality of life; and reduce the environmental impacts of energy use.
#Housing that is not well constructed and maintained, with air leaking through roofs, walls and windows, coupled with inefficient appliances, lighting and #HVAC can lead to high #energy usage and costs even if utility rates are low.
When monthly bills for electricity &amp; #fuel take a large bite out of small paychecks, residents are often forced to choose between heating/cooling and other necessities like food and medicine. High energy burdens are not simply a result of low incomes and/or high energy prices.
Tuesday #briefing/ #livecast on #EnergyEfficiency &amp; affordable #housing. Will you be there? Let us know and pls. RT! üëáüèæüëáüèæüëáüèæüëáüèæ@NRDCSolutions @NatlHsingTrust #Virginia #Ohio @ACEEEdc https://t.co/KFZGPwwWD3

These disasters we're having now should really be a learning exercise.  We have a lot of transitioning to do, as communities.  #resilience #eesitalk
Many states are behind when it comes to sea level rise and #resiliency.  New Jersey is #3 in claims paid dollars when it comes to insurance.  One municipality in New Jersey is above the entire state of California when it comes to flood-based insurance claims. #eesitalk
"Five years after Sandy -- some communities don't have their tax base back.  Revenue gets very impacted by the storm event."  #eesitalk
‚ÄúThe national flood insurance program ‚Äì we still have the same standards now that were in existence in 1968.  There have been no higher standards.‚Äù John Miller discusses the importance of climate #resiliency planning. #eesitalk
Harvey, Irma, Sandy, Maria -- massive destruction from these hurricanes. Importance of higher standards. HUD recently released new standards to address the need for local #resilience planning. HUD will need even more funding to deal with 2017 hurricane season. #eesitalk

"More low risk property owners will insure when their rates are closer to their risk" which means recovery after a disaster will be faster. #eesitalk
Every time the national flood insurance program is subject to a short-term renewal (or even lapses), the impact on the real estate sector is huge. Need at least a five year authorization. #eesitalk
Congress can invest in the latest technology to remove this burden on homeowners #eesitalk
We also need accurate maps for #flood insurance....lenders determine who needs insurance based on these maps. Maps have to be based on individual properties.
Need to prioritize ease of process, use Public Private Partnerships, etc.
Need to incentivize programs that invest in #mitigation.
Flood insurance policy renewals 200 to 400 percent higher? Who is going to buy a property like that? #Realtors see some solutions. #eesitalk

The #Arctic and the Asia Pacific regions are so important to consider in our #risk. The opening of the Arctic, the climate instability of the Asia-Pacific region, the megacities there -- leads to v high #risk. #ClimateSecurity
.@GoodmanSherri talks about how our nation prepares for a high-impact, low-probability event (nuclear). The need to prepare &amp; address the #climaterisk is clear. -#ClimateSecurity
.@GoodmanSherri is going to close this out for us -- takes many hands to bring these events together! EESI's @climatecliff, @CntrClimSec, &amp; many more!

"Getting people to think about decades is a challenge". But most buildings are around for 30-50 years." - John Conger, talking about #base vulnerability, #ClimateSecurity
"Once you recognize a problem, you can start to deal with these problems." They are often location specific and can be addressed. DOD developing report on which bases are most vulnerable to which aspects of climate (e.g, wildfire, water etc). They need a plan. #eesitalk
Hon John Conger talks about his experience in the #Pentagon. Preparation happens and is happening today. Case in point: sandbags can reduce damage. #ClimateSecurity #eesitalk

What about the human dimension? Can't ignore them -- if we do, we'll get the #policy wrong. Because they're #constituents &amp; they #vote. #ClimateSecurity
What about the #Arctic? The Arctic is why the #Navy got into #climatechange. There was an LNG tanker that went from Russia to N Korea with NO icebreaker, in February! And 19 days faster than going thru Suez Canal. #eesitalk #ClimateSecurity
"Think of #Sandy, what did it flood? The #subway" It would not have flooded a century ago (if they had subway then). That cost billions...
"We're already locked into a #sealevelrise of 5,6,7 feet." How much it will rise depends on when we stabilize climate. - #ClimateSecurity.
Three words on #ClimateSecurity: People, water, change. When building things, we've looked at history, add 10% as safety measure, and build it. Can't do that any more. Need to prepare for these changes. Historical trends won't cut it. #eesitalk
"The ice doesn't care who's in the Congress or who's in the White House, it just melts." #ClimateSecurity It's a lot better if we can plan.

This new report is the context for our new #eesitalk on #ClimateSecurity. Pls read if you can! https://t.co/yCieyTmpGf
#Climate considerations are part of the #risk assessment - looking at federal facilities and outside. Living in Hampton Roads, flooding is a critical concern. Flood mapping is based on historical data but we need to look at projected future data - NOT the past. Huge shift.
Rear Admiral Ann C. Phillips (ret.), is about to speak - she's an operator, driving ships. Worked for Admiral @dwtitley. Now part of advisory board for @CntrClimSec - focusing on this "existential threat to our #NationalSecurity - can't overstate that."
Support is the third part of the new report -- how can we prepare? How do investments in our partners and allies help generate influence for the US? What about the South China Sea &amp; our relationship there? #ClimateSecurity
Second panel has started! What should the the military do about #ClimateSecurity? Assess, for starters. Need support from #Congress. #eesitalk Prepare is #2. Need to adapt to #ClimateChange. @DOD understands these risks.

Bottom line ‚Äì climate change is impacting military training right now. Not in 5 of 10 years -- Joan VanDevort #eesitalk #CNSF18
Military‚Äôs ability to protect depends on ability to train. Need access to land, sea and air. How can I protect training readiness from the impacts of climate? Climate change is a game changer in terms of readiness and training.  -- Joan VanDevort  #eesitalk #ClimateSecurity
Don‚Äôt strengthen infrastructure that sits in an increasingly vulnerable area [to sea level rise]. Let‚Äôs not throw good money after bad. Need to be more strategic.  Happy that the services are doing that, we need to do more of it. -- Vice Admiral Parker #eesitalk #ClimateSecurity
