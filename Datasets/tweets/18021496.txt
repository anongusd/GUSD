Follow @GLSENTN for on-the-ground updates and calls to action around HB1151 and the entire ‚ÄúSlate of Hate‚Äù in Tennessee, including the voices of students in the state who are leading the charge against hate! #TNLeg #HB1151 #SlateofHate
If you LIVE in Tennessee, call you legislators TODAY and tell them to vote NO on House Bill 1151. Follow @tnequality for updates and on the #SlateofHate and take action with them NOW to help stop #HB1151: https://t.co/maQHLmftxV
With House Bill 1151 -  and the entire anti-LGBTQ ‚ÄúSlate of Hate‚Äù - Tennessee risks being branded a ‚Äústate of hate‚Äù and opening themselves up to the economic and reputational risks that come along with that title. #TNLeg #HB1151 #SlateofHate
Tennessee state resources would be better spent in creating schools that are safe and welcoming for all students -- not in actively working to make them less safe for students who already face extreme harassment and discrimination. #TNLeg #HB1151 #SlateofHate
#Trans students face hostile environments in Tennessee schools. GLSEN‚Äôs #2017NSCS data shows 71% of LGBTQ students experienced verbal harassment at school based on gender expression &amp; nearly 3 in 4 trans students were unable to use the school restroom aligned with their gender.
All students, including #trans students, deserve to feel safe &amp; welcome at school. They should not have to live in fear of being targeted, harassed, or criminalized, simply for using a locker room, bathroom or other school facilities like any other student. #TNLeg #HB1151
In 2017, Tennessee legislators introduced a discriminatory bathroom bill that failed to even make it out of committee. #HB1151 is nothing more than an end-run around a policy that was already deemed a bad idea. #TNLeg #SlateofHate
House Bill 1151 is one of 12 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced in the #TNLeg, known as the #SlateofHate, and one of 3 bills that would specifically make school bathrooms, locker rooms and other school facilities less safe for trans students.
Today legislators in Tennessee will debate #HB1151 which would grossly expand the state‚Äôs existing indecent exposure law to target and criminalize transgender people -- including trans students in locker rooms and school bathrooms. #TNLeg #SlateofHate

South Dakota‚Äôs #HB1108 is a step in the wrong direction. It is unnecessary, targeted, mean-spirited, and harmful to our nation‚Äôs youth. We must all raise our voices against this specific bill, and others like it, whenever they are introduced.
#SDLeg should focus on creating positive learning environments for all students rather than pushing legislation that would make school environments more hostile for trans and non-binary students. LGBTQ students deserve a positive learning environment like every other student.
We know that policies that ban curriculum on LGBTQ experiences are harmful &amp; create hostile learning environments. LGTBQ students in states with similar ‚ÄúNo Promo Homo‚Äù policies are more likely to experience violence &amp; harassment. #HB1108 is no different. https://t.co/CQxo0lXvSi
Banning curriculum that helps students understand and communicate about gender identity and expression won‚Äôt stop them from doing so - instead, it will just create confusion and shame among students, which leads to bullying and harassment. #SDLeg #HB1108
Trans and nonbinary students - like all students - deserve to see themselves reflected and included in a positive way in the classroom, and throughout their school environments. And for that reason, we urge legislators to vocally say NO to #HB1108. #SDLeg
This morning, South Dakota legislators will be discussing #HB1108, a harmful bill targeting transgender and nonbinary students, that would prohibit the instruction of gender identity or gender expression in public schools for grades K-7. #SDLeg

Erasing trans and non-binary students from curriculum and the athletic field will only make them less safe in an environment where they deserve the opportunity to learn, play, and thrive like every other student in this nation.
GLSEN's #2017NSCS also shows that trans and nonbinary students who attend schools that have trans and nonbinary specific student policies in that protect them face less discrimination and are more engaged in school https://t.co/Yxf4kEB8Yd
Transgender and nonbinary youth already face enormous obstacles to a safe and welcoming school environment. GLSEN's #2017NSCS shows that 84% of transgender and 70% of gender nonconforming students were bullied or harassed at school because of their gender. https://t.co/Y0c55uUVYm
South Dakota #HB1225 would ban trans high school students from participating in athletic programs in a way that is consistent with their gender identity, creating an unequal playing field where trans youth are denied the benefits of playing school sports with their peers.
South Dakota #HB1108 would prohibit teachers from including transgender people and experiences in public school curriculum for grades K-7. School officials in South Dakota agree that this is a preemptive and completely unnecessary move. #SDLeg
While 2 of these harmful bills have already died in committee, 2 others, #HB1108 and #HB1225, are moving forward. BOTH put the safety of transgender and nonbinary students at risk, opening them up to potential humiliation, harassment, bullying, and stigmatization. #SDLeg
Already in 2019, South Dakota lawmakers have introduced 4 bills explicitly targeting transgender and nonbinary youth. 3 of these bills specifically target schools -- places that we should reasonably be able to expect all students to be treated with care and dignity. #SDLeg

House Bill 1108 is one of three bills introduced in South Dakota specifically targeting transgender and nonbinary students and youth. Follow @ACLUSouthDakota for legislative updates and additional calls to action around this harmful legislation.
If you live in South Dakota, reach out to these #SDLeg members here, via @EqualitySD and say NO to #HB1108 https://t.co/KEh7K3QaY6.
South Dakota‚Äôs #HB1108 is a step in the wrong direction. It is unnecessary, targeted, mean-spirited, and harmful to our nation‚Äôs youth. We must all raise our voices against this specific bill, and others like it, whenever they are introduced.
Here‚Äôs the thing, #SDLeg: banning curriculum that helps students understand and communicate about gender identity and expression won‚Äôt stop them from doing so - instead it will just create confusion and shame among students, which leads to bullying and harassment. #HB1108
According to GLSEN's #2017NSCS LGBTQ students in schools with an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum were less likely to hear negative remarks about gender expression, and less likely to hear negative remarks about transgender people. #SDLeg #HB1108
We also know that schools that have inclusive curriculum are less hostile places for trans and non-binary students who already too often face harassment and discrimination in their daily lives. #SDLeg #HB1108
Inclusive curriculum improves students‚Äô lives. GLSEN's own research shows that LGBTQ students in schools with inclusive curriculum feel safer in school, have higher levels of self-esteem, and even perform better academically. #SDLeg #HB1108
Trans and non-binary students - like all students - deserve to see themselves reflected and included in a positive way in the classroom, and throughout their school environments. #SDLeg #HB1108
Today, South Dakota legislators are holding a hearing on #HB1108, a harmful bill targeting transgender and nonbinary students, that would prohibit the instruction of gender identity or gender expression in public schools for grades K-7 #SDLeg

RT @GLSENPolicy: Great debrief on the importance of aligning research and policy with the needs in the classroom: https://t.co/uPkrTzCaSU
LGBTQ students with an #LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum reported lower levels of victimization because of sexual orientation and gender expression, had better attendance, and performed better academically. #NSCS2017
The few #LGBTQ students with an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum in their schools were less likely to hear homophobic remarks and negative remarks about gender expression or transgender people. #NSCS2017
Less than half of students reported that they could find information on #LGBTQ-related issues in their school library, and about half reported being able to access #LGBTQ-related information on school computers. #NSCS2017
Less than 7% of students reported receiving #LGBTQ-inclusive sex education. #NSCS2017
Our findings show that only 1 in 5 #LGBTQ students are taught positive representations of #LGBTQ history, people, or events and almost the same number of LGBTQ students were taught negative content about #LGBTQ topics. #NSCS2017
Our newest School Climate Survey found that there is an urgent need to create safe schools for #LGBTQ youth. One way to create a more affirming learning environment is through an #LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum: https://t.co/f7OtDK1SyR  #NSCS2017
‚ÄúFortunately, the evidence continues to show that key interventions are working to improve students‚Äô lives,‚Äù said @EByard, executive director of GLSEN https://t.co/leOMQ4qx8s
Educators, #PronounsDay is the perfect opportunity to learn about including pronouns in an effort to create an inclusive classroom for all of your students: https://t.co/uMUdr5dDwM @PronounsDay https://t.co/V8yE3qoGIo
GLSEN is proud to endorse the first ever International #PronounsDay! Using someone‚Äôs correct personal pronouns is a way to respect them and create an inclusive environment for all ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/Kp8sxTR9pE @PronounsDay https://t.co/V64OvEWOK1
International #PronounsDay is a perfect time to commit to help create inclusive spaces. One way you can do this is by having pronoun buttons available in your classroom, office, or at club meetings: https://t.co/ttEUqsNx3J https://t.co/vQUJ9DhgCL
To celebrate International #PronounsDay, we're giving away 5 Club Packs of pronoun buttons! Enter to win by texting in PRONOUNSDAY to 21333 ‚ú® https://t.co/SbxFBq50TO
In our latest data, we didn‚Äôt see the same progress in reducing levels of victimization experienced by #LGBTQ youth as we had seen in recent years. For the full report, visit https://t.co/f7OtDK1SyR #NSCS2017 https://t.co/gkGi7kUb5e
#LGBTQ students with #LGBTQ clubs at school also reported a greater number of supportive school staff, more accepting peers, and a greater feeling of belonging to their school community. #NSCS2017
#LGBTQ students also experienced less victimization related to their sexual orientation and gender expression when a GSA was present at school.
Students with #LGBTQ clubs at their schools were also less likely to feel unsafe because of their sexual orientation and less likely to miss school.  #NSCS2017
Compared to #LGBTQ students who did not have a GSA at their school, #LGBTQ students at schools with GSAs were less likely to hear negative remarks about sexual orientation and gender expression.  #NSCS2017
In the 2017 School Climate Survey, more than half of students said that their school had a GSA or similar club, and most #LGBTQ students reported participating in it at some level. #NSCS2017
Our newest research released today shows that progress made for #LGBTQ youth in school is in jeopardy. Supporting student clubs, such as GSAs, is one way schools can positively affect these students‚Äô school experiences: https://t.co/f7OtDK1SyR #NSCS2017
