@Scotttaylorva It’s certainly driving growth at Chase for Dimon. I’m paying more for insurance due to the administrations sabotage of health care. It’s more than I gained on my check for tax reform. Why is chase your priority and my not my middle class family in Virginia Beach?
@CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump It must be hard for your extreme male ego to be capitulating to a campaign that fired you for being exactly who you are
@DineshDSouza Well you got the bigotry part down pretty well yourself
@realDonaldTrump Your the president of all of us, not just republicans
@TomiLahren Oh dear, you should stick to yelling at Black athletes, foreign policy is hard
@Scotttaylorva Speaking of a government picking winners and losers......what’s going on with this 12 billion dollar bailout to essentially cover the glharm caused by tariffs?
@Scotttaylorva Nothing shows your female opponent what a man you are by posting workout videos. I’m sure she will give up her campaign today
@DineshDSouza It’s another great day and another time to remind you what an accomplished American @PreetBharara is and that you can’t even outsell your liberal counterpart Michael Moore
@Scotttaylorva How’s your boy @DonaldJTrumpJr ?
@EWErickson True but why discount youth participation in democracy? Former protests that were now historic were dismissed. I’m sure you can appreciate the divergence or ideas you don’t like vs how the people feel. Even if it’s  not on your side
@realDonaldTrump Ask @SenateMajLdr  he can describe it for you
@pwcdanica I see a lot of people who want to run in VB but it’s so hard to get them excited and I understand. Regular folks are up against longtime community leaders. It’s an expensive market. How can they break through
@GOPChairwoman So if all that is true why is ok for the current administration to take no actions?
@AriFleischer Ari is trying to reach that audience of one again
@TomiLahren Weird you guys were so gracious in the past https://t.co/A7l6hxBUlU
@SebGorka @netflix @michelleisawolf It’s not a fault to seek help, it sounds like you are having trouble coping
@AriFleischer @GovMikeHuckabee You worked for Bush, Trump isn’t going to hire you. Stop sucking up
@drf5n @Scotttaylorva @SteveScalise Makes me think of that song Friday I’m in love. He’s anti Trump on Monday, Tuesday he’s Corey Stewart junior and Wednesday he’s back to supporting his policies but not him
@JackKingston Weird your side was so dignified during the last administration https://t.co/8nQTo8eYVS
@parscale Good job at playing to your audience of one
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Given Putin’s history of aggressive moves in the Baltic States, his record of manipulation of media and his unaccounted for large amounts of wealth, how would you suggest we position the US to maximize pressure on foreign actors?
@SebGorka @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness @FoxBizAlert All the paid talking heads together. Zero substance lots of ❄️❄️❄️

@realDonaldTrump What does Putin have on you anyway?
@DineshDSouza @JudgeJeanine You don’t need a book about liars, it seems to come naturally to you
@TomiLahren But what about the victims of water thrown on us terrorism?!?
@JackKingston Anytime you can have a white power rally is a good one in Jacks mind
@realDonaldTrump False Mitch McConnell threatened to politicize it to cover for your corrupt campaign
@TrumpinTheShark @GOPChairwoman Great profile pic!
@GOPChairwoman Why isn’t the current president doing anything about it except lying ? You guys have little room to stand on. What about McConnell threatening to politicize it if Obama revealed it?
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara No  reason to be bitter about someone who more successful than you by a large margin. What is it you guys always say about rising waters lifts all boats?
@Scotttaylorva Wait there’s a Jimmy Buffet concert today?
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara Notice how he never responds to you? He has zero time for your foolishness and divisive lies.
@theresomethere @SebGorka Nope it’s all emotion and no facts based in reality. Also they are morons
@LadyConserv @JackKingston @JimDeMint Going in straight for the personal attack shows you for who you really are. It must be hard to have so much hate inside you. I hope the burden gets easier for you over time
@JackKingston @JimDeMint Overlooking pedophilia, Hastert, Roy Moore, Jim Jordan..... just to toe the party line. History will judge you as vile as it should. What Clinton did was wrong but 2 consenting adults. This is disgusting and criminal
@Scotttaylorva  https://t.co/EjMRoCWWfF
@Scotttaylorva I voted for Scott Rigell, you are not getting my vote. Try again
@Scotttaylorva @dccc It’s simple really, Taylor might not hold the same views as Stewart. But if he criticizes him he runs the risk of alienating Trump voters, that’s why he won’t say anything about it. He thought this would be a cakewalk, ask Rocky Holcomb how that worked out in your district
@TomiLahren Last thing they need is to be like you. You are consistently distorting the facts and looking for click bait. Go with @secupp instead
@burgess094 @rsrinva He’s shaking in his boots, he will make an excellent addition to the private sector
@Scotttaylorva What were you saying about culture wars ?
@Scotttaylorva “ they” that tells you everything you need to know
@foxandfriends @SebGorka @TomiLahren @annakooiman @PMorici1 @RepScottTaylor @RCamposDuffy @LongHornSteaks @MorganOrtagus @HARRISFAULKNER @jasoninthehouse @JoeEversonArt Typical for @Scotttaylorva , go on a friendly network with all softball questions and avoid his constituents
@jbarro @Popehat Usual colorful commentary... I just listened to the podcast and it was very interesting and informing. Awesome work guys!
@TomiLahren This is my weekly reminder for you. It’s not good for your mental health to be so angry all the time. I hope you can find the peace you are looking for
@ForecasterEnten Wait what?
@Scotttaylorva Seems like your too focused on one narrow poll... how do you stake your claim on opposition polling... what if (gasp) they weren’t honest..... still waiting on your Corey Stewart position... and so are you. You’ve been advised to wait for polling before you take one...
@CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump When are you coming to Hampton roads to campaign with @Scotttaylorva !?!
@WalshFreedom From the generation that bankrupted the country
@AriFleischer You upended US foreign policy for a generation with the false pretenses for the Iraq war. You were complicit in pushing a false narrative. Every US service members life should haunt you at night. You lied plain and simple
@lucas_anderton @Scotttaylorva @JohnWhitbeck He never answers people, excuse me he never speaks to the people he represents. Good thing that’s not in his job title
@parscale @SenGillibrand She’s not going to be the nominee, the fact that you guys are already threatened speaks volumes
@Scotttaylorva Toss up
@AriFleischer It’s a good thing for you bush guys that you can deflect on Trump. You started a war that changed the world for the worst. The single biggest foreign policy disaster of my lifetime. Right after you stole an election. See a pattern here?
@AriFleischer Multiple administrations were complicit in the erosion of diplomacy. No need for a foreign news bureau if there’s no news
@DineshDSouza You are the epitome of what is wrong with our politics
@Scotttaylorva Now if only the people of VB had some kind of official person who was supposed to represent their values say on a federal level🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
@Scotttaylorva Read the story, the restaurant has many cooks who are in the lgbt community. SHS has been very vague in answering questions about the presidents ban on transgender military people, they asked the boss to take a stand and she did, for her community.
@SebGorka The lengths you go to sabotage people who largely agree with you is something that will come back to haunt you. Sure it feels great now....
@Scotttaylorva This ones not a hit job? Because you get favorable coverage......hmmm sounds like someone else I know.......
@Scotttaylorva Just like your buddy here, news you don’t like is a “hit piece” when In fact the pilot was just doing its job https://t.co/kPtwBM5Nze
@Scotttaylorva The right to protest is in the bill of rights. Ask Ed Gillespie how well the whole I’m and establishment republican but also a trump guy worked out for him
@realDonaldTrump You know damn well you didn’t read that book
@DineshDSouza He wouldn’t play chess with someone like you.
@TomiLahren It must be very distressing to be so angry all the time. Try to find some peace for the health of your mind
@Scotttaylorva No one dare insult dear leader right ?
@WalshFreedom @tomperriello is also a one term congressman who is the exact opposite of you. Doesn’t stoke fear and hatred, looks for sensible solutions to thr things that divide us. Maybe you guys should debate??
@KaivanShroff The medley at the end of Abbey Road
@Scotttaylorva Put out a public statement and squash it. Represent your views as a person who represents other people. So weird it’s almost like it’s in the title......
@TomiLahren It has to be a huge burden to be in this constant state of negative feelings. Your too young to be so jaded, also extremely misinformed. You are not getting a cabinet job, they are using you.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump And state run media is all over it I see
@GovMikeHuckabee There was a time during the 08 primaries where I thought you could win my vote, now I wonder how you sleep at night
@JackKingston This will be hard to explain to your grandkids
@Scotttaylorva Hey @Scotttaylorva, let me know when you going to rally with Corey Stewart, if so love to attend
@Scotttaylorva Turnout in the 16 primary was over 40K, so you lost voters. And you had a senate primary on the right and not on the left and still lost voters
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @IngrahamAngle Selling out Mark Sanford on strict orders from the king
@WalshFreedom Didn’t you judge Trump for trolling? That’s what this post is. It only makes people feel better about opinions they already had and doesn’t move the much needed dialogue forward

@mitchie898 @DineshDSouza @PreetBharara @PreetBharara would bury him
@RealCandaceO @DineshDSouza @DineshDSouza is a complete scumbag who seeks to profit off of our divisions as a country. He spews racism, lies and total falsehoods. He wishes he were a tenth of the man @PreetBharara is
@DineshDSouza @ElliottKalan @PreetBharara Compared  to preet you are less of a man than anyone I know. You peddle fear and racism. Your values don’t exist.
RT @RandallTime: If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I’ll buy everyone who retweet’s this a jersey...
@JackKingston Evidence ????
@Scotttaylorva @realDonaldTrump Trump 101 . When it’s positive he’s great, when it’s negative it’s not his fault. Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Accomack, and Northampton county, we deserve better than this. Someone who doesn’t trade values for political ideology
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends That last one was 🔥🔥🔥🔥, not for the stability of our country but for comedic purposes 😳😳
@DineshDSouza You

@LogicByLauren @AmandaPresto @TheMarkPantano Still haven’t answered the basic questions. I wish you a good night or morning depending on what time zone you find your self in. Read

@LogicByLauren @AmandaPresto @TheMarkPantano I’ll bite. Most transformative Trump victory and why it’s important to you. Without campaign taking points
@LogicByLauren @AmandaPresto @TheMarkPantano Your page reflects your independence in thought. Also your fascination with twitter fame is a mirror image of your leader, as long obsessed with fame.
@LogicByLauren @AmandaPresto @TheMarkPantano By that logic you should keep your mouth shut and no comment on politics and movies unless you happen to be employed in those fields

@WalshFreedom You spent all day talking about standing with Israel, because the where we stand with then based on sovereignty. That was because of the holocaust. That was slaughter. Abortions are choices you don’t agree with. That’s America. You won’t respond though because I’m not famous
@WalshFreedom Well in think, never mind, he’s only replies to actors and other taking heads on tv. But he represents you and isn’t elitist..........
@ForecasterEnten where do I get live results tonight ?
@WalshFreedom Why is it that we have to be us and them?

@DineshDSouza  https://t.co/cMoqqWw6II
@AriFleischer In don’t get your level of engagement. You were a pressec so you know how fast stories come at you and the necessary responses. If you are not looking for work why do you express such fealty for this administration
@rustic_ram @Scotttaylorva What? What evidence supports that? Corporations buy bonds, is this 1945
@rustic_ram @Scotttaylorva Perhaps we could debate on the merits of my statement versus leveling personal judgements
@Scotttaylorva Capex expenses are necessary but are not directly beneficial to the workers. In fact those costs could be shifted in automation.
@Scotttaylorva Meet and greets at small restaurants are not town halls by the way
@Scotttaylorva Here’s the message, money for the people not corporate tax cuts. A health care system that works. Sensible gun control. Women’s rights. Focus on income inequality. Protect the environment. No reason for teachers to spend their own money while bank buy backs at record pace
@Scotttaylorva What’s your specific outreach to this segment of voters @Scotttaylorva? How can you speak to what would be beneficial for their lives?
@RichLowry @POLITICOMag @politico Man @RichLowry. Even though I’m progressive I find the bulk of your work intelligent and thoughtful even if it’s a position I don’t care for. It’s sad to see you lose your objectivity to finally jump on the Trump train. I hope your publication has become compromised like RS
@realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman  https://t.co/W5sPYyF8Ls

@joncoopertweets Once you go Barrack....
@AriFleischer Is there no dignity left. After being part of administration that pushed the biggest foreign policy  blunder of a generation in Iraq you are now pushing these conspiracy theories. Your an intelligent man who knows how this works. Save yourself, there’s no job for you in the admin
@WalshFreedom Hey  what chapter of the Bible did Jesus guarantee your right to an AR-15? Asking for a friend
@benshapiro @WalshFreedom I work in fast casual, most cameras are by cash registers and doors, not in the dining room

@DineshDSouza Human rights issue perfectly in the range of acceptable.
@WalshFreedom Them
@vasecthomas @RandPaul Have to agree to disagree on education, every study shows early education is beneficial which is why people of wealth invest in it. Don’t get the defense of the tax bill is a balanced budget is truly the end game. Seems highly hypocritical on the senators part
@vasecthomas @RandPaul I’d like to have a balanced budget with more spending on things that will make lives better than giveaways to corporations. I never suggested tax cuts create revenue. When has that ever occurred
@vasecthomas @RandPaul Kids in Oklahoma go to school 4 days a week. The Kansas was a disaster, this is what we want for the whole country ?
@vasecthomas @RandPaul This isn’t an attempt to fix the mistakes of the tax bill. It’s a show vote with no teeth. Even if it did pass they would use it to make cuts in more vital areas to open up more $ for tax breaks and corporate loopholes
@vasecthomas @RandPaul Not at all but you don’t pass legislation that pushes the annual deficit over a trillion and then act like you care
@RandPaul You voted for the budget busting tax bill
@UnfilteredSE @secupp I respect your opinions if this is Trump talking about doing something not actually doing it. As someone employed to comment on these matters you know they are 2 different things

Me and @Scotttaylorva don't agree on politics but we represent the best Navy town on earth. Get well @SenJohnMcCain
@seanhannity @SheriffClarke @POTUS Your the reason they don't need press briefing anymore. I hope you are at least getting paid to spew your nonsense

@hughhewitt I know your not a trump guy, why? This bill is massively unpopular. And it doesn't even repeal the ACA
@realDonaldTrump This will be another chance for Macron to show what a great leader is in the face of your failure
@realDonaldTrump Remember when you hear the term "president of the United States" they are talking about Bush and Obama not you
@SarahPalinUSA You were a VP candidate and a governor of this great country. Sharing this clearly skewed shows your lack of intellectual skills
@ChuckGrassley Desperation? https://t.co/waQDDRWiWM

@thehill ❄️❄️❄️❄️
@realDonaldTrump You guys charting your course for the 18 midterms ?
@realDonaldTrump Must be nice to not be in the US, think you will draw thr crowds that Obama did? Not important but it is to your narcissism
@realDonaldTrump That has almost nothing to do with sitting presidents. Yet another time when your idiocy compared to Obama shines through
@realDonaldTrump They called president Obama every name in the book and he never responded. That's true leadership
@realDonaldTrump @Morning_Joe Can we get Obama back?!?
@realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke The bush family will thank you for your legacy as a terrible president, takes some fire off of GW
@FiveThirtyEight Read more than the byline, do research
@FiveThirtyEight But they were calling it a toss up right down to the end
@FiveThirtyEight I know that doesn't fit into the narrative of over confidence on either side
@FiveThirtyEight Most 538 models were within the margins of error.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump You guys are a disgrace. People called the last potus every name in the book and he never shot back.get off Trumps boot
@realDonaldTrump Don't you have better things to do? Your such a failure compared to Obama
At a funeral and I'm one of 2 people wearing a Def Leppard shirt
@realDonaldTrump Obama covered millions of Americans, you are giving rich people a tax credit. Failed amateur president
RT @JohnKasich: A one-party solution gave us Obamacare. Let’s not make the same mistake twice. We have to work together! https://t.co/6vdwx…
@realDonaldTrump You should apologize for being a terrible POTUS, pass an executive order to let Obama finish your term
@seanhannity @JulianAssange Another McConnell puppet on the string of my tennis shoes
@Scotttaylorva Your a shame to Hampton Roads. I cannot believe we elected someone who is afraid of Trump

@realDonaldTrump Barrack Obama was a great man and president. You will never even be close
@realDonaldTrump VA voter, a great 13 electoral to have back. But I want to hear from you
@realDonaldTrump Can you go back to the working man. I work 50+ hours a week, didn't vote for you but how can you win for me
@seanhannity Explain why your a credible journalist?
@ForecasterEnten If it goes to a recount you get to keep covering it!

@billoreilly News flash your not on the Murdoch payroll anymore, stop shilling and have a real opinion
@AriFleischer Your at the podium while Bush did the same thing. What's your response
@SheriffClarke He used an offensive term, HBO his employer will decide. U support policies that will harm people of color disproportionately.Ur a disgrace
@WalshFreedom Your a Trump surrogate, if the shoe fits. Therefore you are an embarrassment to true conservatives

@SpeakerRyan @POTUS I don't agree with your values but I respected your intelligence, you sold out to someone who doesn't share your values. Career over bigly
@Scotttaylorva @AReese1980 @Scotttaylorva  I voted for @ScottRigell, it easy to dismiss people who don't agree with you but your the rep now
@Scotttaylorva @Scotttaylorva you seem to love it when liberal extremists tweet crazy things at you. But you don't seem to engage your constituents
@Scotttaylorva Lot of $ in VB, lots of would be primary challengers. Did you even give @realDonaldTrump a chance last year ?!
@Scotttaylorva I want to keep military honor in my district as my family served in WW2, need to know my rep cares about all
@Scotttaylorva I voted for @ScottRigell even though I usually vote for dems, @realDonaldTrump won't get my vote, u seem cozy
@Scotttaylorva @Scotttaylorva what moves can you point to to reach out the those who didn't vote for you ..
