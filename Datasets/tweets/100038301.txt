@RepStevenSmith @AshaRangappa_ There’s no way you believe your own tweet. And if you do, it’s terrifying that an elected official’s mind can be this warped by blind loyalty to a demagogue.

@BillKristol I disagree. It’s infested top to bottom with nationalistic populism. There are maybe a dozen decent elected Republicans between Congress and governships.		There’s no saving it. The GOP must be destroyer and something better must rise from the ashes.
@williamlegate If Trump’s still in office, they’ll justify it, say it’s necessary to make American great again.		If a Democrat is in office, they’ll blame him/her.		Because this is a cult, not a political movement, a cult in which facts are entirely irrelevant.
Trump finds another non-white group of people to harass. These people have lived here for decades. This is their home.		The only purpose in doing this is to make America less diverse. Trump is a racist scumbag and if you don’t see it that way, it’s because you are too. https://t.co/APXcUvYoCm

@kevinsidonohoe I guess the Secret Service, FBI, and NYPD are conspiring with the news media to gain a few extra votes for Democrats in two weeks.		It takes an exceptional level of stupidity to be Trumpian conspiracy theorist.
On the day of the election in 2016, the 538 model had Trump with a 1 in 4 or 5 chance of winning the presidency. Other models, like the New York Times, had Trump with a 1 in 50 or even a 1 in 100 chance of winning.		Nate Silver knows what he's doing.
Currently, the model has the GOP with a 1 in 6 chance of keeping the House. That's the same probability as rolling a 6-sided die and it landing with the 1 face up. That's far from impossible.
Hi @SykesCharlie , the criticism of @NateSilver538 by @EasterbrookG on yesterday's The Daily Standard was vicious and untrue. Silver has not said a single time that the Democrats are guaranteed to win the House. He also gave Trump a greater chance at winning than other modelers.

@DigitalBobbi @mikememoli Sen. Warren claimed a Native American heritage, which Harvard used in defense of criticism of lack of faculty diversity. The test shows she has Native American in her family tree no more recently than six generations ago. So, at best, she's 1/64 Native American.

@elizahecht @ryanstruyk @CNN I agree. Hillary has a major charisma deficiency, but I also think the constant FBI/e-mail news hurt her. She also ran an ideas-free campaign.		While Bloomberg lacks charisma I feel like his cleaner reputation, and an ideas-driven platform, would help.
@elizahecht @ryanstruyk @CNN It’s a double edged sword that historically both parties have faced. The ideal candidate should appeal to the base enough to get them out to vote, but also must have some crossover appeal for moderates and independents.

@TheTattooedProf @feministabulous @Ocasio2018 Are we talking about Republicans or reporters? If she’s being harassed by Republicans about Pelosi, then I agree with you 100%. If we’re talking about reporters, it’s the perfectly logical question. Ocasio-Cortez will vote on House Leadership, not the Senate.
@feministabulous @TheTattooedProf @Ocasio2018 I am not saying there is no misogyny in play when it comes to Pelosi. I’m saying that, in this instance, it makes perfect sense for Ocasio-Cortez to be asked about Pelosi’s leadership, and not Schumer’s, because she’s running for the House, not the Senate.
@TheTattooedProf @feministabulous @Ocasio2018 Yes, I’m aware that the GOP has very effectively demonized Pelosi in conservative and swing districts, forcing the Blue Dog into near extinction, but I assume this question is coming from reporters, not the person Ocasio-Cortez is running against.

@mattklewis What makes this conversation much harder to have is that the loudest voices complaining about media bias are Fox News and talk radio, which is astronomically hypocritical.
@mattklewis I think it’s virtually impossible to expunge all bias from media. News people are human. Humans have biases. It’s a matter of finding an acceptable level of bias. There’s a pretty big difference between, say, ABC News and Huffington Post.
@brithume Conservative media has embraced, lied, and propagated for a mob boss in the White House.		Brit Hume is staring out his living room window as his house is in engulfed in flames, complaining about his neighbor’s tacky pink flamingo.

@JayCostTWS Yes, I’m one of those people for which it is prohibitively high. Not only because of geography but because of income.		Personally, I think the protestors are being rude and disrespectful, not trampling on my first amendment rights. They will be removed and the hearing will go on.

@davidmweissman From Lincoln to Eisenhower, Republicans were, generally, more pro-civil rights. This took a drastic turn in the 60’s when JFK defied Southern Democrats and declared support for civil rights. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) ran for president opposed to the Civil Rights Act in 1964.

@buderfly7 @spitdabit @KayTaylor3 @ryanstruyk I did not vote for Trump in 2016 and I will not vote for him 2020. He embodies the darkest characteristics of the United States. He’s a narcissistic demagogue who “leads” by stoking fear, hatred, and anger.

@mmgday @brian_mistrot @Lynn_Rose1 @Bayeux188Lonnie @rickwtyler @AModerates Yes, I agree it has to be a big name or at least a charismatic figure that can quickly gain traction. The 2016 election showed us that even having historically disliked candidates from the two major parties isn’t enough.
@Monitorabbit I’ve heard. I wish they would do the same for us here in the US.

@TheDrillField @DicenzoMiller I was visiting a friend in Louisiana. We took a day trip to visit his grandma in Ferriday. She didn’t have a TV so I found the game on the radio. I suppose the signal was out of Natchez. I can’t remember.		That was the same day LSU upset Tennessee. We were both giddy.

@brian_mistrot @Lynn_Rose1 @Bayeux188Lonnie @rickwtyler @AModerates I think this is part of the reason why a third party cannot rise up. There are so many and new ones being created all the time. We need some consolidation. Any third party that falls between the extremes of the Democrats and the GOP should unite to work out a common platform.
@lavici I agree completely. Trump pours fuel on the fire. He’s caused both sides to retreat to more extreme positions, heels dug in, attack more viciously, no compromise.		I think voting him out of office is the first step to healing this country.
@lavici I’m not overly politically correct. My issue is with the hypocrisy. If you replace “white” with any other race race in her tweets, she would have would been crucified by the Left.		I’m an equal opportunity condemner of bigotry.

@lavici Let me be clear when I say that I despise the Alt-Right. I hate that they are involved in this conversation.		I agree with Vox that there is a distinction between Jeong’s comments and systemic racism, obviously, but it doesn’t change the fact that her comments were bigoted.

@lavici I wish I had the resources.		Whatever happened to Bill Kristol’s New Federalists?
@voxdotcom Okay, if you don’t want us to use the word racist, fine. Sarah Jeong is a hateful, prejudiced bigot.		Any media outlet that defends her, or hires her, loses all credibility on the issue of race.
@seungminkim I just realized I’m incredibly thankful it isn’t my job to keep up with the Troll in the White House.
@jbarro The point, Josh, is that not only is she getting away with making blanket racist statements for two years, but also that the Left is leaping to her defense and accusing her critics of being awful, racist people.		The hypocrisy is pungent.

@anghunt26 @72442W30 @DavidAFrench Maybe you missed the original tweet. David French suggested Trumpism isn’t real. I refuted it. You chimed in. I pointed out why the fact you stated doesn’t contradict my point.
@PatrickSvitek @tedcruz @BetoORourke Risky. An incumbent leading in the polls has more to lose in debates.
@NileCmylo @DavidAFrench Please see previous comments.
@mikeavent @DavidAFrench What is your prediction?
@mikeavent @DavidAFrench He may not have won the GOP primary if he had less opponents, but they rallied around him in the general, his approval is sky high, and Republicans in Congress cower in fear of the GOP voter. It’s his party for now.
@mikeavent @DavidAFrench I think we can say Trumpism is more meaningful than black nationalism because, simply, he’s president. He ran on a platform of hatred of Democrats, the free press, and immigrants and won 46% of the vote. He will win a similar % in 2020 barring strong independent candidate.
@GeoBfield @DavidAFrench I think we’re already seeing the earliest (unofficial) stages of the 2020 primary. Gillibrand, Booker, Harris, Sanders, Warren. They’ll all run to the far left (if they run). Cuomo and Bullock seem to be staying somewhat mainstream.
@mikeavent @DavidAFrench Yes, that’s a fact. And it’d be much lower if unemployment wasn’t so low.		I get the impression everyone replying to me thinks I’m somehow defending Trump. I’m not. I hate his guts. I’m just refuting the claim Trumpism isn’t real.
@72442W30 @anghunt26 @DavidAFrench Yes, I know. I have addressed this twice. The comment I was refuting is that Trumpism isn’t real. That’s bonkers.
@mstowle @DavidAFrench Yes, I’m aware. I said “Trumpism does not reflect the views of a majority of Americans.”		I’ll add “or even a plurality”, but it’s still very real. We’re seeing the effects of it every day.
@GeoBfield @DavidAFrench I would agree if the Democrats would nominate a moderate, but I don’t see that happening. Almost every potential 2020 Dem is swinging hard to the left.
@mikeavent @DavidAFrench Yes, some Republicans have fled, but what should be apparent is that far more than 20% of Americans support him. He won 46% of the popular vote and his approval hangs around 40%.
@gary_swisher @DavidAFrench I am aware of that fact.
@anghunt26 @DavidAFrench Trump won 45% of the primary vote. No one else was close. Most Republicans rallied around him in the general. His GOP approval is sky high. It’s his party now.
@DavidAFrench Trump beat 16 someones not named Hillary Clinton in the Republican primary. He has an approval rating of nearly 90% within the GOP.		Trumpism does not reflect the views of a majority of Americans, but it’s sure as heck real.
@MeghanMcCain I just want to know where this passion is when discussing Trump and the GOP. You mostly give passive, nuanced takes. It’s like you have to come up with the friendliest take possible regardless how outrageous the topic is.		But Democrats, you effortlessly crank it up to 11.

@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench I didn’t say it “required inventing some new meaning.” It requires interpretation and application. The 1st Amendment does not mention union dues.		This has been fun but I can’t express my point any more clearly.		Have a nice day.
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench Which is why I roll my eyes when Republicans or Democrats try to argue that the Constitution or the Founders fully supports their political ideology. They were a politically diverse group that couldn’t even agree on the meaning of the document they had written!
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench Yes, I’m aware. Poor choice of words on my part, maybe.		And yes, I know the Constitution doesn’t explicitly give SCOTUS this power, but it was established very early in the Republic. The whole process was an experiment that took some time to figure out.
@aceofclubbs @DavidAFrench @GOP It isn’t a contradiction at all because, in my opinion, there are virtually no good Republicans left. Certainly none in my state. If I tried hard enough, I probably could come up with a dozen or so Republicans from across the country that I like.
@Hi_IQ_Trump @brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench I haven’t read any studies to support that claim, but off the top of my head, I’d say, yes, historically that is true. Warren, Souter, O’Connor, and Kennedy come to mind.		But I think those days are gone. Extreme vetting has been introduced into the judicial nominating process.
@Hi_IQ_Trump @brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench Based on a 1st Amendment argument. My point, again, being it requires interpretation and application. There are no true “originalists.” There are conservative and liberal justices. The appointees generally rule in favor of their appointers.
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench You’ll need to provide me with some specific liberal rulings on guns for me to read.
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench Of course. I don’t disagree with the ruling, but my point is that majority opinion requires interpreting the 1st Amendment to apply to a 21st century issue. It does specifically address unions and dues.
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench Yes, they did, to make fundamental changes to the Constitution. Marbury v Madison established that the courts interpret.
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench If you believe in a 100% literal, “originalist” reading of the constitution, then Elon Musk could build a nuke and point it at Washington, and Congress couldn’t pass a law to stop him.
@brianjacksonXP @DavidAFrench Writers of the constitution could not conceive 21st century issues. It requires interpretation to support/oppose nearly every new piece of legislation. For a recent example read the majority/conservative opinion on Janus v AFSCME. It isn’t “originalist.” It’s interpretation.

@DavidAFrench Once again, it isn’t about sending Trump a message. It’s about sending the GOP a message. They do not deserve to remain in power. They are complicit.
@DavidAFrench Additionally, voting for good Democrats isn’t about “sticking it to Trump.” It’s about kicking the @GOP to the curb and forcing them to evolve as a party. They do not DESERVE my vote until they regain their senses.

@DavidAFrench The point, Mr. French, is that the Cult of Trump remains obsessed with Hillary. She lost. Trump won. Still, they cannot seem to get over her.		Furthermore, these chants do not come from being well informed of the law or deep analysis. It’s anger and hatred driven by Trump.

@Basil_Austin94 @TheView I disagree. Bill Clinton is a sexual predator. Donald Trump is a divisive, demagogic, xenophobic, narcissistic, ill informed, wannabe despotic sexual predator.
@TheView It’s painful to watch Meghan McCain contort, conflate, and equivocate to try to defend the Trump voter. He is a uniquely awful human and president. There is no intelligent defense of him or his supporters.

@thelongversion @AriFleischer @JaniceDean Bee’s comment was political criticism wrapped in mean-spirited comedy. If I were her producer, I would’ve tried to stop her from using such vicious language.		Roseanne’s comment was plainly racist and conspiratorial. I would have fired her.

@charlescwcooke Your piece perfectly deconstructs a tweet by a distraught Senator. I can not argue with a single point.		Now, please explain to me why the Republican reaction is always to discredit all Democratic talking points rather than proposing effective legislation that could SAVE LIVES.

@Jeff28647618 @NRA 1. 2nd and 3rd amendments should be read and studied together to fully understand context.	2. Only very few on the fringe left actually want to disarm Americans. Expanded background checks, waiting periods, etc. lets the people keep and bear arms while potentially saving lives.

@NRA “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”		“A well regulated militia”		“Well regulated”		#WellRegulated
@williamlegate Yes, it truly is. The folks that believe they need their guns because they may have to overthrow the government one day (realistic in the 18th century, laughable today) think that background checks and waiting periods will be their undoing?
@williamlegate Even if no NRA members have committed mass shootings, I think it’s an irrelevant point. The NRA gets most of their money from gun manufacturers and in return they fight tooth and nail to prevent any gun laws from passing. I think that’s the fact that matters most.

@kylegriffin1 This is beyond the pale, a hatchet job on a teenager who’s recently been through a traumatizing experience.		Whatever wrote this article needs to go back to the circle of hell it escaped from.

@DavidAFrench True, but the composure and boldness of these Parkland teenagers is impressive.		I was shy and dumb as a box of rocks when I was 17.
@GuardianRover Right-wing news and Congressional Republicans would have lost their minds.
@kylegriffin1 @GovHowardDean He may be too young to realize the severity of his statement but the adults applauding it must realize this is 0% helpful. Calling people child murderers (that didn’t actually murder children) probably isn’t the best way to get them to have an honest discussion.
@HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn A foundation can do good but still have corrupt inner workings.
@MillenPolitics @NathanHRubin While I loathe Trump, unless it can be proven that Russian hackers changed vote counts to give swing states to Trump, we cannot legitimately say that he isn’t legitimately president.

@GovHowardDean The GOP will be a permament minority in one generation if they do not change their ways.		I know some Democrats may drool over that prospect but one-party rule is not a good thing.

@brianklaas Laws do matter, but the US is saturated with guns. There’s a gun for every person in the US (literally 1:1 ratio) but only 1 gun per 16 people in the UK.		I think the only way to meaningfully reduce gun deaths is to drastically reduce # of guns in US. Not sure how that happens.

@EWErickson I agree they shouldn’t include minor, accidental, or non-fatal events alongside the truly tragic ones, but that’s hardly a good reason to refuse to discuss solutions to save the lives of children and teenagers.
