And if it's a "scam" for a group to take labor money, what is the word for politicians who are supported by big banks and real estate interests?
Planned Parenthood gets union money. The NAACP gets union money. @amprog and @CenterOnBudget and @BrennanCenter get union money. If it's a "scam" to take union money, the entire liberal political order is a scam.
Cuomo is of course right that labor unions fund an enormous array of activities within the broader constellation of Democratic Party politics and activism. https://t.co/gJE5TF4r89

If this fight continues, it should review some actual policy disputes btw Krugman and MMTers. I think there's enough theoretical space in both traditions to justify just about any proposal, but worth thinking about where their theoretical assumptions lead them in practice.
MMT economists consider Treasury bonds part of the money supply. There's a real conceptual dispute between Krugman and MMT and you don't have to agree with the MMTers. But it's pretty disingenuous to present them as totally brain-dead like this. https://t.co/DNJcYML18c

@D_Kuehn If you disagree, ok.
@D_Kuehn I think economics has been pretty ideologically rigid the last ~25 yrs and I don’t think history has conclusively disproved fiscal policy or price controls as useful inflation management tools. I think it’s possible we’re entering a period of greater flexibility.
@D_Kuehn We’re talking about a long period of time here, but I think the Volcker shock should complicate any argument about monetary policy being the first and last line of defense against inflation.
@D_Kuehn Give me a break, Dan. It’s not ahistorical to point out that there are periods of ideological creativity and periods in which orthodoxies harden. If you don’t think we’re in a rigid period now, fine, but at least represent my views accurately.

The extreme ideological rigidity of contemporary economics is not a historical necessity. Whatever its faults, the field has been more flexible in the past, and would benefit from more flexibility today.
Once upon a time, very mainstream Keynesians had much more flexible ideas about how to manage economic policy than they do today.

@rohangrey @ryangrim @MattBruenig the political and theoretical debates here are getting muddled. the theory seems clear that you can't tax the rich enough to fund a GND that solves the climate mess. so you need to be clear that paying for things dollar-for-dollar shouldn't be a barrier to climate legislation.
@StephanieKelton @MattBruenig That is what I am confused about!

But on theory the MMTers are rejecting market fundamentalism. Krugman believes debt and money markets are a bedrock economic reality that governments must conform to or (eventually) pay a price. The MMTers believe governments create markets. It's an important distinction.

@Noahpinion onward to saving the world!
@Noahpinion In the spirit of reconciliation, let me add that it is generally good for the government to be investing heavily in technological advances, and you are right to point out that we can afford to do much more.
@Noahpinion Your plan is formulated as a critique of a Green New Deal. I have argued that this critique relies on a caricature of what Green New Deal &amp; MMT economists have advocated. So while I commend you for calling to raise taxes -- I love tax increases! -- I think you have been unfair.
@Noahpinion We just went back and forth talking about inflation, pay fors and spending, and now you are accusing me of refusing to engage with you on ideas. That's called bad faith.
@Noahpinion I think I've been quite clear that I think your plan is formulated in response to a straw-man critique, supported by inflammatory "collapse our economy" rhetoric. You're trying to play gatekeeper, and it's not very impressive.
@Noahpinion Okay, then it's settled. You're creating a straw man MMT argument and knocking it down to build the case for a plan of your own! Very serious of you!
@Noahpinion What you call "paying for spending" is just "managing inflation" in MMT lingo. And there's nothing in MMT says you can't use tax increases to do that.
@Noahpinion Either you don't understand MMT or you're being deliberately misleading. The point MMT folks are making is about inflation. The government can always "spend" money without raising taxes, but eventually inflation becomes a problem with enough spending. https://t.co/hYN9z3u6TU
This is where the action is in Noah's critique. But there's nothing in MMT or the Green New Deal that says you shouldn't pay for things with taxes. Noah just doesn't want MMT-affiliated economists to get the fancy jobs. https://t.co/MpbUm4dfSL
So much of the controversy around the Green New Deal on Twitter is about intellectual brand-management. There are issues with the proposal, they are very solvable, and folks are fighting over who will get to be the fancy people sitting at the fancy table where they are solved.
@Noahpinion your plan is to fund a bunch of research so that "TECHNOLOGY" will innovate the problem away! this is silly.

@brianbeutler @MattBruenig I think that is wrong, and I'm happy to discuss further with anyone who is confused about why I think that is wrong.
@brianbeutler @MattBruenig But I was responding to Noah's point, which was: "So until the proposal is substantially revamped, every Democrat's answer to the question "Do you support the Green New Deal?" should be "NO."
@brianbeutler @MattBruenig I'm not going to try to state Matt's position for him, because it inevitably changes to suit whatever will be a sick burn on Stephanie Kelton or anyone affiliated with MMT.
@MattBruenig @brianbeutler you're a lot more interesting when you aren't playing high school debate captain
@MattBruenig @brianbeutler Did you notice in my *original thread* where I *also* suggested tax increases as part of a GND?
@brianbeutler @MattBruenig It's not really a tax question. I like tax increases! But I also recognize that they're just one method for dealing with inflation and if there are political/practical limits we can do other things. Matt for some reason is hostile to this view.
@EricLevitz @rohangrey @MattBruenig in which case, we disagree about a pr question you don't think is important
@MattBruenig good thing i didn't say that!
@MattBruenig of course not
@MattBruenig you don't have to like that piece, but stephanie's body of work is explicit about inflation, as you're aware. https://t.co/rmGnbI0dIx https://t.co/aAD5lYocXP
@MattBruenig nah. "we'll pay for the GND the same way we paid for all of these other things" is pretty open and honest.
@KStreetHipster screwed up my thread!
But this would change the traditional role economists play in Washington. "How much inflation is too much?" and "what are the best ways to fight inflation" are political questions. Economists can help map that terrain, but they can't tell us the right answer.
The good news is, the projects contemplated under the Green New Deal are big and ambitious and would take time to bear fruit. So there's plenty of time to work out a plan.
So what does that mean for GND? Lefty economists are going to have to spend some time thinking about the best ways to deal with the upward pressure on prices that they think will accompany full employment. Interest rates? Tax increases? Price controls?
The *actual* problem that the GND is hand-waiving -- future inflation -- is one that economists don't really have a solid answer for. That's why Fed governor Dan Tarullo gave this speech when he left the Fed.  https://t.co/x7pVEE8hd8
"How will you pay for it?" assumes that deficits are bad and that if you increase the deficit you have failed as a policy designer and need to start over. Not many economists think this is literally true, but it helps economists function as gatekeepers in Washington.
So I suspect that at least some of Noah's frustration here is related to the GND's implied attack on the status and influence of the economics profession.
When the CBO "scores" legislation, for instance, it's not actually telling you how something will in fact effect government revenues. It's making an educated guess, based on a lot of (typically right wing) assumptions about how the future will play out.
Economists have been making a pretty good living for a long time by being the people who write papers that make predictions about how to pay for policies. But these predictions are rarely accurate and depend on events in the future that economists can't know.
The real money problem facing a Green New Deal is the same problem facing *any* full-employment agenda. How do you deal with inflation once the economy is running at full tilt?
It's not unreasonable to believe the predictable mass death caused by climate change is a (much) more pressing problem than the deficit. Economists have been freaking about about the deficit now for 30+ yrs, and none of the "debt crisis" predictions have come to pass.
Noah is of course right that GND framers hand-waive this question, but they're quite explicit about it. It's not an accident. They're trying to shift the way we think about policy.
Some thoughts on this. One of the most interesting parts of the Green New Deal frame is the rejection of "how will you pay for it?" as the most pressing question facing any new policy idea. https://t.co/jMBLLw20MF

@workclassjane @linmp1031 why don't you just say "fake news"
And it is not obvious at this moment whether Democratic voters care more about that stuff than they do about their partisan commitments to the people who have represented them for the past three decades.
Long-term, I don't think the widening gulf between leadership and the base is sustainable. But there's plenty of bad stuff that can happen in the short-run. We're out of time on climate change. Our criminal justice system is a rolling human rights outrage. Our economy is unfair.
That's worth keeping in mind when the shutdown gets going again. Pelosi winning the PR battle over the shutdown isn't just about Trump's approval rating and a wall that is never going to be built. It's a way to build credibility with the base without compromising on ideas.
Leaders also see Trump as the overriding issue for Democratic voters. So long as they look tough as hell on Trump, corrupt meetings like this -- yes, it's corrupt when party insiders privately assure corporate interests that they are on the same team -- will get a pass.
So while the polling on policy makes it pretty clear that the party has moved left, leadership doesn't have a whole lot of evidence that leaders will be punished for failing to move with the party. They see Crowley's loss as a campaign failure, not an ideological break.
Progressives did pretty well against 1990s-style Democrats in the 2018 primaries. But they didn't do very well against 1990s-style *incumbents.* @AOC is a big win, but that's about it.
By now it's pretty clear that there's an ideological breach between Democratic Party leaders and most Democratic Party voters. The party bigwigs are still committed to the policymaking assumptions of the 1990s; the base is not. https://t.co/40Iagm7eGc

Same sex marriage will make everyone marry their pets! Ocasio Cortez won a primary and they are going to nationalize the all the pet stores!
American politics are in fact changing right now and the consensus around what constitutes legitimacy and decency and the appropriate role of government is in flux. When that happens, people freak out.
Schultz has just not been exposed to very many ideas and is terrified of what he sees when he steps outside the boardroom.
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and @AOC are not "far left" politicians. The far left does not believe in the legitimacy of the American political system and does not run for office seeking to change it.
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and @AOC are not "far left" politicians. The far left does not believe in the legitimacy of the American political system and does not run for office to change it.
But note that not a single person in Democratic Party politics actually espouses any of these views. The radical demand that most terrifies Howard Schultz is ... expanding Medicare.
For the far left? There are a lot of options. People who don't believe in the legitimacy of any state. People who support the violent overthrow of the American government. People who support economic equality enforced by an authoritarian dictatorship. So much to choose from.
Words are just words, but it seems to me that support for street violence and racial purity are characteristics of the far right.

So the 1990s are so cursed among the American electorate that Schultz can't get traction with *either* major party. And whatever happens to his presidential bit, he's already an interesting test for political gatekeepers and alums of the 1990s consensus.
I'm going to try to stay away from predictions in 2020. But it's very difficult to win the presidency from a third party. So difficult that it has never happened.
So the Howard Schultz campaign is really instructive. He's a walking embodiment of the 1990s consensus -- we can't afford health care! what about the debt! But he also knows he can't win as either a Republican or a Democrat.
Most people who follow this thinking don't even realize it's an ideology. It's just how to be serious about politics.
This way of thinking was discredited in 2008. But it's still very powerful in elite circles. It's the unspoken ideology of TV news. It's why the go-to question for political reporters who want to appear serious about policy is "how will you pay for it."

@MikeGrunwald your tweets are more interesting when you are fantasizing about people being killed	https://t.co/42mFLdhUFT
Obama's first chief of staff was Rahm Emanuel and his second was an in-house lobbyist for JPMorgan Chase. This is not just a tactical difference with AOC. It is a significant ideological gap, and it has to be acknowledged.
It is not good for the Democratic Party or American liberalism to pretend the Obama administration was the second coming of FDR. Obama wasn't *trying* to be the second coming of FDR or the precursor to AOC. Here he is making overtures to ... Joe Crowley. https://t.co/FD9wlF1Sh1
And frealz finally: in this essay @MikeGrunwald argues that Obama, AOC and FDR were/are all doing the same thing, only Obama was a savvier political operator who faced a tougher political opposition. That should seem ridiculous on its face, because it is.
There was a lot of good stuff in the stimulus. And there was a lot of harmless stuff in the stimulus. But it did not transform American life or government. It was a countercyclical tax cut that should have been bigger.
And finally, trust your gut when stuff seems too good to be true. The New Deal was a decade-long experiment that transformed American government and the basic architecture of the nation-state. The Obama stimulus was a tax cut that built some roads and piloted some programs.
Second, it's just a dumb way to compare the two programs. The New Deal was 40 % of precrash GDP. The stimulus was ... 5.7%. https://t.co/D2VqtRz5HM
So FDR and the Democrats raised taxes a ton. They created new taxes -- a liquor tax, a Social Security tax, a coal tax. They raised the corporate tax rate and the rate on dividends. In 1934, FDR raised the top income tax rate from 59 percent to 75 percent.
First, "Franklin D. Roosevelt's entire New Deal" didn't create big deficits until 1938, because FDR believed in balanced budgets when he came into office.
This is lying with statistics: "the stimulus was an unprecedented exercise in deficit spending, as big in inflation-adjusted dollars as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s entire New Deal"

This is why American life expectancy is declining. Only elite concerns are considered the proper subject of political action.
They view this as the legitimate function of Congress. The see the problems AOC talks about as populist concerns for people who don’t understand how Washington really works. They’re illegitimate issues, and it’s dishonorable to discuss them in public.
Their staffs spend a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of paperwork are really important and what varieties wouldn’t be *that* bad to get rid of.
The top career legislative achievement for most members of Congress will be helping to save a small subset of millionaires and billionaires a few thousand dollars in paperwork costs.
You could substitute "I actually like it when Democrats to corrupt things and that's why AOC makes me mad" for every one of these anonymous quotes.

@ObsoleteDogma @Neil_Irwin seemed to work pretty well in the eccles era. but i'm not convinced the politics of "we need to raise taxes to keep inflation down" are a lot worse than the politics of "we need to throw a lot of people out of work to keep inflation down."
@Neil_Irwin @Steinernomics @NathanTankus any call for more democratic accountability on economic management has to be clear-eyed about the louie gohmert problem. and i think democrats have been conditioned to think about who the good people are and not what the good policies are. but it is all fixable.
@KStreetHipster @Neil_Irwin This is getting far afield but yes. I think Trump's criticism of the Fed so far has been essentially correct. Whether he understands why I cannot say.
@Neil_Irwin @NathanTankus I think about it every day! Along with deep thoughts about the way the Department of Education has decided to manage student loan debt, which has also been quite bad.
@Neil_Irwin right, but the choice looks different if you take, say, the last 25 years instead of the last 12. i think there's clearly room to improve democratic accountability and diversify the toolkit.
The Fed regulates inflation by intentionally causing unemployment. It's undemocratic, it's cruel and unfair, and it frequently fails catastrophically. It's a cop-out to pretend that the only other option is an up-or-down vote in Congress.
Sure, raising taxes can be hard in Congress. But you know what else is hard for Congress to do? Raise interest rates! And so they created an agency to handle it.
And if we are going to go with experts and bypass Congress for this -- why is fiscal policy off-limits to the expert agency that manages the economy?
There's an obvious tension between democracy and expert management, but Josh doesn't actually address it. He just starts noting that economists have started thinking differently about debt and will surely get it right next time.
People should be deeply skeptical of an arrangement which says "don't trust democratic mechanisms with the basic health of society, leave it to the experts," especially when the experts gave you the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession.

But if the concern is that Pharma invests in less R&amp;D if it becomes less profitable -- well, the government can fill in the research gap. In fact, it already does. It's called NIH.
That will continue to be true if we offer pharma greater or lesser "incentives" to invest. Extend the patent monopoly to 25 years. Or 50. Or replace monopolies with a prize or a tax credit.
So pharma companies don't use in future profits to their investment decisions with any degree of precision. They play their best hunch with the information they have. Just like the government, which starts the process.
These changes are always happening, and yet research still happens. And the process doesn't even begin with pharmaceutical companies. Every drug that pharma brings to market piggy-backs on research funded by the federal government, which begins as a deeply speculative enterprise.
At any point in the drug development process, there's a risk that the drug becomes irrelevant or less profitable thanks to outside factors. In the 1930s, stomach cancer was the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Today, it's relatively rare.
How many people will be alive? Who will be president? What if someone changes the law? What other innovations will take place? What if we learn that diet and exercise take care of the problem?
This isn't because they're lazy. It's because it's impossible. Nobody conducting drug research now has any idea what the medical landscape will look like when their drug reaches the market. They don't even know if their research will result in a drug.
Current pharmaceutical investment decisions are not driven by "rational" long-term calculations about revenue streams stretching decades into the future.
I think that's silly. It just sounds serious when you say "trade-off with future innovation" instead of "Pharma is maximally efficient." Now about the investment.
Do we really believe that the government granting a long-term monopoly is the most efficient way to get results?
Pharma spends more on marketing than it does on R&amp;D. It spends more on *stock buybacks* than it does on R&amp;D. There is really *no way* to make this more efficient without costing lives?
Ask yourself if you believe that every dollar spent by pharmaceutical firms is maximizing future public health outcomes.
Saying there's no "free stuff" to be had is another way of saying the existing system can't be made more efficient. There is no way to get the same or better results with less.
My fundamental objection is to the model for investment implicit in Craig's argument. And I'll get to that. But first let's just look at the implications of his view for a second.
High prices are sad, but lower prices have costs that people don't think about. There's no "free stuff" to be had, in Craig's words.
On the show, Craig said he views prescription drug pricing as a trade-off btw the present and the future. He argued that if we make the pharma business less lucrative today, we'll miss out on life-saving developments tomorrow. Money that would have gone to research won't be spent
I'm getting a few inquiries about it, and thought I'd explain my disagreement with Craig in a little more detail here.
Had a nice conversation with @TanzinaVega and @C_Garthwaite about prescription drug prices on @wnyc this morning.

@jbarro This is true, but I don't think there is a significant faction of Democratic Party primary voters seriously invested in the meaning of the terms "socialism" and "capitalism." Those are style points for a narrow population. Ditto on low-fiscal-cost wonk signaling.
@BenjySarlin @pareene i am very curious about how the primary process will change the topline issues for 2021. at the moment the dem base currently seems to be saying "anything but torturing brown people and giving money to rich people!" and also "Medicare 4 All!"

@ImNotOwned @kar_nels yes i think that's right. but there will be 2020 candidates whose message is Obama Was The Greatest And I Will Do That. Warren will not be able to win voters who are really into that.

Warren's been saying some version of "The game is rigged, Washington teamed up with Wall Street to screw you, they've been doing it for 35 years" for 25 years. She'll lose a big chunk of Clinton/Obama enthusiasts for saying that in 2020, but it's her brand. She can't escape it.

And his AFI lifetime achievement speech from 1982 is really intense. At the time, nobody knew about his McCarthyist informant stuff or that his memoir was an unreliable guide to his life. Still a hell of a speech: https://t.co/usTXpUWMb4
This theme becomes much more muted as he becomes a more popular director. He uses extra-white casts to embody all of America. But he sometimes has these characters go out of their way to insist that immigrants are great and anybody who believes in America is an American.
Also interesting that Capra works openly with some immigration themes in his early work. The protagonist of The Strong Man is an immigrant who sees the Statue of Liberty when he comes to America before experiencing hijinks. https://t.co/XLL4OXwbzw
And in fact Springsteen almost titled his fourth album American Madness, after a 1932 Capra movie! He went with Darkness On The Edge Of Town instead. Capra gets ripped a lot for gooey sentimentality, but he helped inspire a very dark and bitter record.
If you watch a dozen or so Frank Capra movies, you start seeing Bruce Springsteen everywhere. Capra's memoir is about leaving the immigrant ghetto behind and hitting the bigtime. It's Born To Run except Capra actually gets rich and famous when he leaves.
@SandyDarity in American Crucible, Gary Gerstle writes a lot about Capra's fears and frustrations with race. fear of descending the racial hierarchy, frustrated by his inability to be fully accepted in the white elite: https://t.co/tNm69IJxuA
It rages against the Mr. Potters who hoard money and exploit its scarcity to impose social hierarchies on the community. And it celebrates people like George who spread the wealth to solve social problems. It isn't capitalist or anti-capitalist. It's populist.
Money is what the community uses to save George and what George uses to save other families in trouble The film acknowledges that in America, people without money aren't treated as full citizens or full human beings.
This is an important theme in the movie. It's about folks pulling together when the chips are down, not about what the gov can or can't do to solve problems. That makes it feel non-ideological when it is a deeply ideological film.
Banks don't need deposits to make loans. They use them to lower their cost of funding when making loans. There is no central bank or deposit insurance in IAWL.
Pretty much every single technical point the movie makes about money is wrong. The explanation of banking that Jimmy Stewart/George gives during the run is historically accurate for the period being described, but totally wrong for banking in 1946 and 2018.
Capra knew it was a good story, but it wasn't consistent with the way he presented his family in the book, and maybe to himself. So Tony disappeared in the memoir version.
For instance, Capra claims a local tough guy once offered him $20k (&gt;$250k today) to engineer stills for Italian bootleggers (Capra turned it down). After the book was published Capra's brother Tony said that *he* was the local guy who offered Frank the job.
Every work of non-fiction has to be selective about what it emphasizes and de-emphasizes, and things get misremembered, especially after decades. But there are some really interesting, ah, mistakes.
Frank Capra's memoir Name Above The Title is an incredible read, and at times you find yourself thinking, "this is so wild, I can't believe it's true." That's because a lot of it isn't! https://t.co/nnFpD1gs7L

@JStein_WaPo @mattyglesias does anyone on the internet know who would have won in 2016 though?
But in a lot of areas, elite knowledge still has a groupthink problem. And it's important for journalists like Michael to challenge it.
Obviously we don't want to throw out expertise entirely. Specialized knowledge is good! And the haters often *don't* know what they're talking about. You don't want Gwyneth Paltrow in charge of medical licensing.
Just one example, the foreclosure crisis. A lot of judges couldn't believe that the nation's top banks &amp; their lawyers were illegally throwing people out of their homes. The best defense for banks was often just, "Judge, believe me, I'm from Wells Fargo." https://t.co/aUr6BVvcen
This is a broader problem with expertise in American culture. We credential experts to signal to society that they carry some level of elite knowledge, not to indicate infallibility. But disputes between experts and other critical thinkers are often adjudicated by credential.
Here's one of the doctors crying foul. Read for yourself and decide if you think Michael's piece was filled with "vitriol towards the medical community." https://t.co/r8IZFcSodF

@matthewstoller @CharlesPPierce @muddlewait Patrick's role at Ameriquest is a legitimate scandal. https://t.co/zuz70TbBnS
The 2016 DNC race showed that Obama could still get pretty much whatever he wanted from the party. Patrick's early exit from the 2020 field suggests that isn't true anymore -- or at least that Patrick doesn't think it is.
And in multiple glossy profiles on Patrick this fall, reporters breezed right by the Ameriquest scandal, focusing instead on praise for Patrick from Obama's inner circle. Here's @jeffreytoobin in The New Yorker: https://t.co/8gc7dZDA78
Obama was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Arnall's ambassadorship came up. He was the chief skeptic about Arnall's qualifications for public office in 2005. He knows about Patrick, Arnall and Ameriquest, and still backed Patrick as a potential president.
And this one from Michael Hudson: https://t.co/nxx0pqr6oz
These weren't state secrets. There are two very good books on the financial crisis that detail Patrick's relationship with Ameriquest. This one, from @opinion_joe and @bethanymac12 https://t.co/vbxAaMsrPA
And yet despite all of this, Patrick was the top choice for Team Obama in 2020. And I think that tells us a lot -- both about Team Obama, and about Team Obama's influence. https://t.co/OA6n4UuqG1
Ameriquest eventually agreed to pay $325 million to settle predatory lending allegations with 49 states and DC. https://t.co/zYi1cHX7zp
In 2005, Patrick urged skeptics on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to give Arnall -- a billionaire George W. Bush megadonor -- an ambassadorship. "This is a good man." "This is a good company." Here's what Ameriquest was doing at the time: https://t.co/909T10BwQC
Ameriquest was really, really bad, even for a subprime lender. "The worst bottom feeder of them all," according to @opinion_joe. And in 2004 Patrick joined the board at Ameriquest, making $360,000 a year.
As we laid out in the story, when Patrick was at DOJ, he issued a very flexible settlement with Arnall's subprime mortgage operation for targeting black families with expensive, dodgy loans. Arnall subsequently developed his mortgage business into Ameriquest.
Patrick's relationship with Roland Arnall and Ameriquest mortgage was pretty breathtaking, even by Washington standards.
And today we know he's going to withdraw. I have some thoughts on the 2020 campaign that wasn't. https://t.co/l0Jv3G78ea

@brianschatz That's the way I read your tweet, but glad to see you clarify otherwise. I think the Trump tariffs are mostly a mess, but they have indeed been a boon to the U.S. steel industry, and I have a hard time seeing how we improve trade policy long-term without tariffs.
@brianschatz Yes, we agree on that.
@brianschatz Thanks for clarifying. But I still don't think it helps non-wonky types understand things to say that Trump's tariffs are a problem because they are a tax.
@brianschatz As for the point about regulations: https://t.co/UTc46KkFo6
@brianschatz Well, sometimes you can impose them without any downside. It depends.
Markets don't fall out of the sky. They are constructed by public policies and governed by rules of conduct enforced by public authorities. Tariffs are one tool that can be used in these processes, just like interest rates, taxes and regulations.
Tariffs are also a tool for regulating commerce. Imagine a Democrat saying this about "regulations." https://t.co/1tfTnalGgy
Tariffs can be either good or bad. They are not bad in and of themselves, and Democrats denouncing them wholesale in order to criticize the president are embracing a fundamentally right-wing view of the world.

A lot of the debate won't be about whether to tackle big problems that involve entrenched corporate interests, but *how* to tackle them. That's different, and it will be harder to dismiss lefty plans as unserious when they are going through a serious policy vetting competition.
I don't know if Dem leadership was/is prepared to sort out multiple serious proposals that would each serve as a major hit to big pharma's bottom line. But because 1/4 of the Senate caucus is "exploring" presidential runs, the party is full of new policy proposals.
Both of these bills are much more aggressive than anything Democrats have talked up in the past. https://t.co/u4iqEQ5Ldr
Jeff Merkley was the only sitting senator to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2016. Now both he and Sanders have competing bills going after high drug prices. https://t.co/tTLxB5VIFG
You can already see some of it in the message legislation starting to move in Congress.
An interesting dimension to the 2020 primaries will be the presence of multiple candidates from the progressive left. This time around, there won't be a cluster of centrists with an outsider lefty yelling at the pack. The "progressive" label is now a feature, not a bug.

That's a problem that needs to be addressed, and the richest society in the history of rich societies can afford to walk and chew gum at the same time. There is no conflict between addressing *both* student debt *and* severe poverty.
Middle class people who are crushed with debt don't do a lot of things that help the entire economy -- they don't buy cars and houses, they don't take risks and start businesses, they don't take jobs they like that don't pay very well. They play it safe and pay down debt.
Handing piles of money to the super-rich doesn't do much for the broader economy because they already have more money than they can spend. But spending money on the middle class, even the upper middle class, isn't just a dead-weight loss.
He's also thinking about inequality the wrong way. The explosion in income inequality over the past thirty years hasn't been driven by an upper-middle class getting fancier at the expense of the poor. It's driven by the top 1% and top 0.1% breaking away.
David thinks there's a trade off here between the middle class and the poor, here. But the real trade-off on student debt is between the middle class and the financial system.
You would want to take into account a lot of things about the health of the financial system when you do this, of course. But Leonhardt is conceptualizing the wrong trade-off.
The government doesn't have to choose between spending $1.4 trillion on the poorest Americans and $1.4 trillion on debt cancellation, because you don't have to spend money to cancel debts. You can just cancel them.
Cancelling debts isn't a welfare program. It's ... debt cancellation.
I think David's thinking is off-base here for a bunch of reasons, but my most serious objection is to his "giant welfare program" angle. https://t.co/qKuCdEBNXE

"We don't like Cuomo, we just keep voting for him" is a bad argument folks!
@JHWeissmann @NeonPlatypus My point is that Democrats like who they have. You are making arguments about left-wing strategy, which is fine, but different. If Democrats didn't like Cuomo, they would put up a challenger -- either from the right, center or left -- and vote for that challenger. They don't.
@JHWeissmann @NeonPlatypus there is also no reason why it's the left's responsibility to oust a corrupt incumbent. centrists have agency, too. they could put up a challenger, and they don't.
@JHWeissmann @NeonPlatypus this whole notion of "credible" and "qualified" somehow only applies to challengers. crushing an anti-corruption investigation into your administration is disqualifying.
@TimLikesPi Thanks for your prayers in this difficult time, Tim.

The Dems in swing states who voted against the bank bill -- Baldwin and Brown -- cruised to re-election.
Voting with the banks sure didn't seem to help Donnelly, McCaskill or Heitkamp and it doesn't look like Tim Kaine needed the money. We'll see how things go with Tester.

So we'll have an early test of what types of candidates and strategies are working where. Can lefty populists win in rural districts in the Trump era? Are Dems turning the red suburbs blue? We'll find out.
And VA-05 is gerrymandered to be just about impossible for Dems to win. The D candidate is Leslie Cockburn, and she's been running an unapologetically lefty campaign.
VA-07 has been in Republican hands since 1971 and is currently represented by David Brat, a hardline Tea Party guy.
But the real test will be in Virginia, where we'll start to see info at 7:01. VA-10 is the type of wealthy exurban district that party leaders in DC have been targeting.

Democratic ideas -- everyone should have access to affordable health care -- are popular! That's why Republicans lie about them! But Dems have convinced themselves that red state voters don't like good things unless they come w/ corporate partners to ease the pain of socialism.
There's also plenty of first black president stuff going on. But Democrats can't really do anything about that. What they can do is propose programs that actually work and then deliver on them.
For the people who Obamacare has benefitted, these associations are good. The bill has made their lives easier and more financially secure. But for tons of other people who have seen no appreciable benefit, Obamacare is a symbol of being broke and frustrated with awful insurers.
When most people hear "repeal obamacare!" they are not thinking about socialized medicine. They are thinking about dealing with insurance companies and not being able to pay the bills.
The fact that Republicans are lying constantly about pre-existing conditions after campaigning on REPEAL OBAMACARE for ears tells you there is a huge disconnect between what voters and wonks hear in political messaging.

But we didn't need a wave of global fascism to tell us both-sidesism was a problem -- it has just made it impossible to ignore for anyone willing to be persuaded. The same is true for a lot of bad practices in other fields from the turn of the millennium.
A lot of the elite consensus from the turn of the millennium is being torn down, and it's important not to lose what was good while the bad is cleared away. The instinct to be fair, to recognize and grapple with ideas and individuals you don't agree with is important to preserve.
I don't think it's useful to describe those periods as "normal," or to lionize the media standards that prevailed during those periods. There were obvious, serious failures, most notably with the Iraq War.
So many of the actors from the Trump era -- Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Newt Gingrich, Dinesh D'Souza -- are key figures from earlier periods.

Growth is not neutral, money is not neutral, the financial system is not neutral.
One of the most important differences between Democratic governance and Republican governance since the 1970s has been the GOP's willingness to see economic policy as a tool to advance a social agenda and alter the balance of power in society.
The economic agenda of the Reagan presidency was about where the centers of power in the American economy and the government bureaucracy would be. It was not about deficits or interest rates, which were means, not ends, and always are.
The idea that is is disgraceful for the president of the united states to "interfere" or "meddle" with the Fed by trying to *lower unemployment* should be recognized as absurd. Economists who focus on central bank independence are emphasizing the wrong thing.
The fantasy of a politically neutral Fed that manages the economy beyond the reach of elected officials is fundamentally anti-democratic. The sooner it is discarded, the better. https://t.co/EDMdHQDzFb

@BudgetBen But the problem seems most acute for finance, insurance and health care.
@BudgetBen And, critically, no real independent barometer to tell us whether the prices *actually* correspond to consumer preferences or are in fact just some meaningless numbers that the system happened to generate.
@BudgetBen "Work" is a flexible term, but yes, I think the idea that prices serve as an indicator of true consumer preference is at best a muddy proposition. Where Hayek sees the price system as a decentralized brain calculating social activity, I see a lot of numbers, many of them random.

@BudgetBen And indeed the *entire point* of the CEA paper is to show that "socialist" policies don't work because they miss out on the benefits of market price signals.
@BudgetBen No, you're deliberately sidestepping my point, which is that price signals in a health care market obviously don't mean the same thing that price signals in a market for trinkets do.
You have been in a car accident. Your leg is probably broken. Are you 1) screaming in pain, trying to get to the nearest hospital as fast as possible? or 2) Excited about an opportunity for some comparison shopping!
But it's really helpful to have this market price signal stuff out in the open!
Ah yes the many, many choices "consumers" have in the health insurance "market," where 56 percent of Americans get insurance from their employer, 19 percent get it from Medicare and 16 percent get it from Medicaid!

Frankly, letting the Dow 36,000 guy run the CEA has been good for The Discourse. He is crystal clear about just how ludicrous the economic assumptions behind conventional conservative policies are.
It is almost as if a very simple question has been needlessly complicated with silly statistics to render a politically convenient result.
But it's funny, the Trump CEA doesn't mention that countries with single-payer healthcare systems have longer life expectancies than the United States. How strange! https://t.co/iq00YJYp5u

Trump CEA: "Evidence on the productivity and effectiveness of single-payer systems suggests that M4A would reduce longevity and health, particularly among the elderly, while only minimally increasing the fraction of the population with health insurance."
Sorry, back to how dumb this Trump CEA report on socialism is. They go to great lengths to try to show that a Medicare For All program will reduce "longevity."

In short: billionaires make their money by subverting some function of government, and spend their money by infringing on the role of public institutions. This is not generous, it is dangerous.
What Big Philanthropy shows is not billionaires with a sense of social justice, but billionaires operating beyond the reach of social accountability. Even if they're just really nice guys who mean well, that's dangerous. https://t.co/bGRXOcwJ6l

Billionaire charities are not really charities. They are public policy forums that set agendas for governments. Sometimes they succeed and sometimes they don't, but unlike elected governments, nobody can vote Bill Gates or the Clinton Foundation out of office if they screw up.
But he has pledged his fortune to charity! Isn't that good? No. Not if you care about democracy.
So Warren Buffett, like other billionaires, makes a lot of his money by bleeding other productive enterprises and dumping losses on the public.
This is how monopolists work. They either team up with the government, or find a critical function that *should* be filled by some regulated/public entity, and suck money out of the productive elements of that sector.
The banks benefit from government support, while Moody's occupies a choke point in the economy. Nobody really believes Moody's is *good* at their role, but they have found a place to exact a toll, and they do.
These are not just companies that do horrible things -- though for more on that, read this: https://t.co/ssNL8hLhQW

@rorycooper It’s a cyclical pattern in GOP strategy, though. When Democrats are in charge, Republicans rail against deficits. When Republicans are in charge, they run big deficits and talk about growth, wages etc.
Deficits are a necessary part of the operation of a healthy economy. Pretending this is a big new change lays the groundwork to slash social welfare spending when Trump is gone by citing big deficits as an element of the unique horror of Trumpism.
This idea, voiced here by @rorycooper, is ubiquitous in Washington, and also wrong. Every Republican administration since Herbert Hoover has overseen deficits of increasing size and scope. It is not new with Trump. https://t.co/wVrMDJg3uX https://t.co/vljfNlbCHd

This is not a majority coalition. It can only maintain control if Democrats comprehensively refuse to learn any political lessons from the last decade.
Republicans don't need Kavanaugh to advance their policy goals on the Court. Any doctrinaire GOP lawyer will do. Closing ranks around Kavanaugh indicates that the mask is off the few stragglers who hadn't fully embraced the party of Roy Moore and Corey Stewart.
All polling to date indicates that the conservative movement's position on Kavanaugh is a minority view, and elite representatives of the Never-Trump conservative camp are openly saying Kavanaugh is binding them to Trump.
The facts on Kavanaugh are very clear to the public. He repeatedly lied under oath to defend himself against a credible accusation of sexual assault. The conservative movement and the Republican Party are making it clear that they don't care.

@BudgetBen "I Ben Ritz prefer taking away healthcare benefits for old people to having my taxes raised and believe this is moral altruism." Quite a position!
@BudgetBen This is shockingly toxic reasoning in multiple respects, but your acknowledgement that this is in fact a discussion about *values* rather than passive scientific forces of debt is correct.
@BudgetBen The idea that *only* social security and Medicare cuts will really do the trick — not growth, taxes or anything else, ever — is your bag. And like Paul Ryan, you need the threat of crisis to sell that.
@BudgetBen Everybody in this discussion agrees that it is possible to  run dumb deficits and mismanage fiscal policy. Raise taxes! Go ahead! It’s better than monetary policy for attacking inflation.
@BudgetBen ultimately MMT folks actually care about full employment and deficit hawks actually care about cutting SS and Medicare. if we have a long continuum of policy options for achieving full employment and moderating price swings, then the case for SS/medicare cuts is lousy
@BudgetBen if what you care about is really just inflation, and you really believe the stuff you say about spending and debt, then there is no reason why taxes can't be raised or spending cut "within a year or two." that is certainly just as politically plausible as ss or medicare cuts
@BudgetBen My root objection is to presenting the debt as cliff you fall off rather than a continuum with many policy options. That hasn't been true since the gold standard. PPI likes Paul Ryan's framing bc the ideas only look good when contrasted with calamity. https://t.co/BpwznHx0sB
That austerian take is obviously wrong for a country that controls its own currency, but people still put it out there. For instance: https://t.co/SKKXr6V4vh

Trump literally has a list of 24 other nominees pre-approved by the professional conservative industrial complex to overturn Roe! They have plenty of time to get another nominee through! But the movement insists it's Kavanaugh or bust.
For much of his presidency, self-styled responsible Republicans have distanced themselves from the worst of Trump's outrages. With Kavanaugh, we have the entire conservative movement publicly disgracing itself.
"i am sorry that i defamed a man and humiliated my friends and political allies" -- that is an apology. "my accusation still stands but i shouldn't have made it" isn't even coherent

The conservative movement has insisted for decades that their opposition to Roe is all about the sanctity of life and in no way about exerting power over women. They have also apparently decided that Brett Kavanaugh is the only acceptable vehicle for overturning Roe.

@Ksdsc6 that's the whole point, right there. why are they proud to get in? because others are excluded. why are the professors legendary? because that's just what it means to be a yale law prof. it's an engine of social inequality. like all higher ed, but on steroids.
@MikeSacksEsq there are plenty of ways to subvert the norms of privilege and power that do not involve getting a degree from yale law. the very protection you're referring to is the protection of joining the club of prestige and power.
@Ksdsc6 yes, and the reason they went to yale instead of a state school or night school is to collect the prestige that comes with a yale law degree, and leverage it for the work they do
The Kavanaugh debacle is ripping the facade of enlightened responsibility off the prestige and power complex, revealing a simple system of domination and subjugation.
The power comes from people like Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld landing students jobs with people like Brett Kavanaugh. They can get you into the ruling class, but only if you perpetuate the norms and ideas of that ruling class. Dress with 'a certain look!'
Places like Yale Law exist to lift some people up over others. And the lie about these institutions is that they're chiefly concerned with education or hard work. Those might be part of the ritual, but they're not the source of the institution's power.
One of the rites of that initiation, as @EmilyRPeck reveals, is learning to dress in a manner that appeals to Brett Kavanaugh. Another is readying oneself for harassment by Alex Kozinski.
People don't go to Yale Law to memorize statutes and regulations. They go to make connections and be initiated into the cult of American power and prestige.

5. Kavanaugh is now a test case in whether this aristocracy -- Georgetown Prep, Yale law, Chevy Chase -- is in fact beyond reach of the rabble. And that outcome mattes as much to the conservative movement as any court case.
4. The Kavanaugh nomination has become a referendum on a certain wing of the American aristocracy, whose entire raison d'etre is to be above democratic accountability.
3. The fact that the Republican Party and the professional conservatism network is nevertheless rallying behind Kavanaugh instead of demanding a reliable replacement is quite telling.
2. If confirmed, Kavanaugh will be open to perfectly legitimate impeachment proceedings for things he's said in his confirmation hearings. He's an extremely unreliable vehicle for conservative policy goals at this point.
1. Trump could withdraw Kavanaugh this afternoon and get almost any professional conservative lawyer confirmed to overturn Roe and abolish the minimum wage.

@dceiver right, it's reasonable to say these things just take time and remember that AOC's win *was* in fact a surprise and an upset. but also American politics are in a state of emergency right now and don't have 10 or 15 years to put things together.
That's a long game. And today's energy won't last forever.
So in a moment where the left is more influential than it has ever been in my lifetime, the realistic path for change is for politicians like Salazar and AOC to build careers and name recognition to the point where they can win statewide in 10 yrs.
The left can't even really take credit for knocking Cuomo out of the 2020 discussion. He was never going to be a serious candidate. The corruption, "America was never really great," etc.
One of Team Nixon's consolation spins last night was that Cuomo had to spend over $25m just to repeat his performance 4 years ago. But ... he had $25m. These will always be races where the machine has money and the left has people, if the left is left in any meaningful sense.
If name recognition is an overwhelming barrier for new candidates calling for change within the Democratic Party, then the playing field narrows to races where face-to-face contact with voters can be a deciding factor. And that essentially forecloses statewide contests.
AOC is the lefty crown jewel this cycle, but it was also a race with low turnout, in part because Crowley was so absent from the district that people just didn't know who he was. Again, low name recognition gave lefties an opening.
Lefties made inroads in state senate contests where name recognition was much lower. Julia Salazar has been getting absolutely pummeled in the press for months now and she routed Milan. Cuomo has been getting ripped in the press all year. The media didn't really matter.
I think things are a little more dire for the left, at least in New York. *Two* top Cuomo aides were *convicted* and *imprisoned* for corruption during the campaign season, and he still swept the statewide contests.
Here is the optimistic take for lefties from last night: https://t.co/gY96NFPdI7
In short: the machine swept the top of the ticket and got demolished downballot. The left's best opportunities seem to be against lesser-known candidates.
Sean Patrick Maloney functioned as a Wall Street-backed spoiler for Zephyr Teachout in #NYAG. https://t.co/s8heAwuvk0

Political parties are weird, incumbency has advantages. But this isn't just a test of whether Democrats want to be a party of ideas, or a progressive party. It's a test of whether Democrats really want to be a party of *Democrats.* And I have no idea how it will turn out.
But it won't be. Whatever happens, a big chunk of voters who *loathe* the president are going to pull the lever enthusiastically for Cuomo today.
For a party faithful that is in a state of constant outrage over the propriety of President Trump's financial affairs, this should be a pretty basic litmus test.
Two of Cuomo's top aides are in jail, right now, for corruption. They were convicted this year. Four years ago, Cuomo suspended a corruption investigation when it got close to some of his real estate donors.
Even setting aside major ideological differences between candidates, there are questions of simple partisan loyalty that make the establishment ticket more odious to moderate Democrats than Hillary Clinton was.
Maloney voted with *Ted Cruz* to suspend Obamacare during the 2013 government shutdown fight.
Cuomo, for instance, is not even a committed Democratic Party partisan. He fostered the IDC alliance that helped Republicans control the state's governing agenda.
But it is *not* a rehash of the Bernie-Hillary primary.
There's also a divide between older establishmentarian voters and younger lefties. And a split between MSNBC viewers and digital media readers.

Eight years ago, Paul Ryan and Alice Rivlin had everyone in Washington screaming about an imminent debt crisis. It didn’t happen. It didn’t come close to happening. They don’t understand how this stuff works.
Reagan ran record deficits! Bush ran record deficits! Obama ran record deficits! Trump runs record deficits! And nothing bad keeps happening. Again and again and again. If there is something bad about deficits, conservative orthodoxy and Econ 101 don’t know what it is.

So what you have is a political theory in which violence isn't objectionable unless it's directed at property owners, and any system of government that constrains property owners in any way (e.g. income tax) can be legitimately overthrown by fascists to correct the "emergency."
And let's be really clear about what those ideas about property are. Here he is in 1944. The next section of the book attacks anti-trust laws and the income tax. https://t.co/h7wSlZNTQS
Here he his defending fascist dictatorship as a necessary action to preserve a 19th century vision of the state and property. The next step to be reasonable and peaceful and lawlike. But first, the violent overthrow of systems that do not abide by Mises ideas about property. https://t.co/QyTKWaDUpg
Mises is in fact willing to accept very extreme acts of violence against human beings in the name of property rights enforcement.
This is obviously wrong. But if we acknowledged that human beings can be wronged in fundamental ways that do not involve property, then even a restricted state-as-peacemaker idea of government would need to consider protections beyond property rights enforcement.
When you go through classical liberals or conservative intellectuals, or whatever term the right wants to use, you find some wild stuff. This is Ludwig von Mises, justifying a conception of the state as the enforcer of property rights. https://t.co/k7unYH0eKG

@SeanMcElwee @daveweigel the nyag polls have consistently shown huge portions of the electorate undecided (30% in latest). In aug over 50% had never heard of James or Teachout. ny polls have been spotty this yr, but still seems like activist energy/media coverage is reaching a relatively small community
@SeanMcElwee @daveweigel but cuomo is at least an incumbent, so you can argue that he has built-in advantages. the nyag seat is open.
@SeanMcElwee @tysonbrody @daveweigel No -- the point would be that resistance orgs aren't very powerful and lose easily to organized money.

That's important, because Geithner in particular worked hard to prevent Dodd-Frank from including structural changes to the financial system. He didn't win every battle in 2009-10, but the piecemeal repeals -- 2014, this year, mean the law on the books to day is his vision.

That story changes if McCain had run a different campaign in 2008. But he didn't. And you can levy that judgment on the historical significance of his career without claiming to have insight into the quality and character of his soul.
So the story about John McCain upholding fairness and decency against the tide of partisanship, amid the moral collapse of the GOP -- I just don't see it. I see a straight line from McCarthy to Nixon to McCain-Palin to James O'Keefe and Donald Trump.
The wing of the party that supported increased economic investment in our Cold War ally, Apartheid South Africa in the '70s and '80s, is the same wing of the party that destroyed ACORN. And it's the same wing of the party that elected Donald Trump.
This kind of moral lapse is a big deal if the Republican Party is your path to power. Going back at least to Joe McCarthy, the fascist-friendly wing of the GOP consistently linked civil rights to totalitarian communism and plots against America.
If all of these nice things people keep saying about John McCain are true, then he didn't believe any of this. But that just makes it worse. He was willing to spread toxic racist lies to win the presidency.
Putting Sarah Palin on the ticket was an attempt to appeal to the same crowd that was psyched about the ACORN attacks.
He did the same thing with TV ads, accusing ACORN of destroying U.S. banks by pressuring them into giving undeserving black families mortgages, and accusing Obama of helping to perpetrate the scam as a community organizer.
What McCain did in 2008 was ugly and wrong. In a live debate, he presented a racist conspiracy theory in which Barack Obama and ACORN were conniving to steal the election and defraud American democracy.
What I keep coming back to is the 2008 campaign. Being a stateswo/man means accepting compromises. And it's instructive to examine the depths to which a public figure is willing to sink for the sake of power.
But foreign policy just *is* making judgments about mass death. Plenty of other public figures made the exact same wrong calls McCain did, and many did so for political gain, believing their votes were morally indefensible. McCain at least had the courage of his convictions.
I don't agree that the defining characteristic of McCain's career is his consistently pro-war foreign policy. I think it was bad, and recognize that getting foreign policy wrong means getting mass death wrong.
People live long, complicated lives. Nobody is perfect, and nobody wants to be defined by their failures alone.

@BudgetBen But to the substance of your question: the GOP's top legislative priority will be cutting social security, medicare and the safety net. I find the prospect of fiscal aid in that context remote.
@BudgetBen Assumptions aren't usually based on evidence, Ben.
Without help from Congress a traditionally manageable situation could get very ugly. The threat to social stability in this country from rising unemployment should make policymakers absolutely terrified of overtightening. Obviously, it does not.
It seems very plausible to me that the Fed overtightens, causes a recession and doesn't correct until a wave of corporate debt defaults have slammed the banking sector and spooked the banks into not lending to anybody.
I do not think Powell and the Fed appreciate that there is zero fiscal help available from Congress for at least 2 yrs.  https://t.co/zM1zqOHWBp
@future_of_music Even by this definition, music is insufficient for a decent lifestyle, or people wouldn’t be scrapping for that extra third.
@future_of_music of course. but most working artists today also earn the vast majority of their income from non-musical sources. the career path is typically independent of the art.
.@jasoncherkis and I wrote about this back in 2012. It's worse now: https://t.co/CyJVmHMvCn
We're down to three major labels today from five in the 1990s. And if you want to make a living making records, you have to be on one of them. There is no independent career path.
This was all true before Napster and the platforms broke the music industry's business model, but it is much, much worse in the ere of hyper-consolidation that has followed.
When something genuinely subversive does break through, it is quickly re-channeled into something corporate-friendly. Rage Against The Machine gives birth to solipsistic suburban nu metal. Some of those that work forces --&gt; I did it all for the nookie.

It's not that economists have *no* scientific content to their work, just as Supreme Court opinions don't just discard the Constitution or actual legal statutes.
The closest analogue for an elite economist is not an elite physicist but a Supreme Court Justice. A political figure who uses elite language to cloak political judgments in a shroud of dispassionate expertise.
What Summers doesn't mention is that economists don't agree on what those "laws of economics" actually are, or that the "laws of economics" have this unfortunate tendency to change radically over time, sometimes in the course of just a few years.
People think economists are like physicists, just studying the data and wearing labcoats. And economists actively encourage that perception. Here's Larry Summers: 		https://t.co/IUeWq0VaM6 https://t.co/rmFQ8OQbgc

Change is a struggle, not a consensus.
The point is just that any movement to implement positive social change in the United States will have to accept being assailed as "socialism." When that change is established and institutionalized everyone can say "jeez remember those idiots? This is common sense capitalism!"
And when Democrats started to talk about same-sex marriage and LGBT rights in the 21st Century, Steve King and Rick Santorum denounced them as socialist.
Conservatives and neoliberal intellectuals denounced just about every act of social and economic change that took place in the United States up until 1980 as "socialism."

Anyway -- the point is not to say Marx had a good white paper or a bad white paper. Just to say that "capitalism" and "socialism" and "communism" are words that have almost nothing to do with implementing an actual agenda. They're terms of abuse and political combat.
https://t.co/f8ttH77P3d
Other stuff is legit radical. "Abolition of property in land," "Abolition of all right of inheritance.
"Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly." Sounds pretty close to having a central bank and bank regulations to me.
There's also quite a bit sounds pretty radical, but wouldn't be if you just take "centralisation" to mean "regulation."
"A heavy progressive or graduated income tax," "free education for all children in public schools," "abolition of children's factory labour in its present form"
Marx very rarely says much of anything about what communism is going to look like. But he does talk about an initial transitory state before what he thinks of as pure liberation. And a lot of what's in there is not controversial anymore, even to hardcore capitalists.
We nod to this briefly in the story, but just to highlight how far removed from actual policy words like "capitalism," "socialism" and "communism" are, I wanna point to a few items from the Communist Manifesto.

This is also how Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg became billionaires. But the stuff the smashed didn't belong to a company called "Facebook," it belonged to an industry called "journalism."
Tronc execs are just taking their employees' money and putting it in their own bank accounts without any concern for the newspaper as a going concern or its role in society.
The grotesque smash-and-grab management strategy from tronc execs is of course disgraceful. It is also the business model for Facebook. https://t.co/DjYGmqwpUo
In conclusion, Eric is great and everybody should read his book on FDR and the gold standard: https://t.co/ORdVO2tMms
At one point the economics profession said the gold standard was the only way to live. At another it said the Phillips Curve was an iron law of human behavior. And when the professional consensus breaks down in a crisis, Democrats can get caught flat-footed &amp; whacked politically.
And that comes with risks and benefits. Because a lot of the time economists are right. And a lot of the time the entire profession generally agrees on ideas that are wrong.
So I take Eric's point that Democrats are typically free traders to mean that Democrats, at least over the past century, have been much more closely attuned to shifts in the consensus among academic economists than Republicans have been.
So for Wilson, free trade is about tariffs. For Bill Clinton and WTO, free trade is about a whole slate of regulatory policies on intellectual property, environmental regulation, etc.
They were right! But they were also stating a tautology. Because what we call "free trade" at any given moment just *is* the international political order favored by the economics profession. And that changes over time.
Milton and Rose Friedman once said: "Ever since Adam Smith there has been virtual unanimity among economists, whatever their ideological position on other issues, that international free trade is in the best interests of trading countries and of the world."
Because the policies and ideas that we call "free trade" change over time. "Free trade" meant something different to Woodrow Wilson than it meant to Bill Clinton.
Eric's basic point, that historically Democrats going back to Wilson, Bryan and beyond have supported free trade, is true. But there's more!

What Trump is doing on trade isn't coherent. It's a mess. And a lot of it seems pretty corrupt. But the public doesn't really have a good lens through which to filter it.
I think that coverage vacuum has contributed to the sense that Trump is upending something normal and stable. If people had a better idea of what has been going on all over the world under the banner of U.S. trade policy, they would see it as an area of almost constant conflict.
But it's an example of the way politicians -- and particularly politicians in the Democratic Party -- can shape news narratives without explicitly haranguing or bargaining for coverage.
For a lot of the 21st century journalism outfits have faced ridiculous cost pressures, so it's hard to blame the editorial decision. When you have to cut, it's not crazy to cut in places where there seems to be political consensus and little controversy.
Several major publications scaled back their coverage of trade policy in the 21st century. It was considered unsexy, settled and boring after Clinton basically adopted the GOP position in the 1990s.

13. And Obama explicitly targeted price hikes in poor countries, or "LDCs" (Least Developed Countries). https://t.co/w8CSpNEovg
12. This exception saved millions of lives. But it didn't apply to trade agreements with the rest of the world, which Clinton formalized in WTO treaties.
11. So did LGBTQ activists. They protested at Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign rollout. It was a debacle for Gore, and Clinton quickly carved out an exception to his global drug price policy for African nations. https://t.co/iFvAX9CL22
10. It wasn't true. And when activists convinced an Indian generic firm to produce them at a retail price of $1/day, the Clinton administration freaked out. https://t.co/vg0Bo6FWeV
9. Clinton was trying to keep HIV drug prices elevated in Africa, and a consistent talking point in favor of this policy was the idea that the drugs just chemically could not be produced at low prices.
8. What they did NOT want to see was what happened with AIDS and HIV drugs in the late 1990s.
7. The biggest issue for the Obama administration and U.S. pharmaceutical firms was cancer drugs. New treatments were being developed that could extend lives for years -- and if this stuff could be priced at 5- or 6-figures a year per patient, it would mean enormous profits.
6. More generics = lower prices on brand-name drugs.
5. Higher drug prices = less treatment for poor people in poor countries. Obama tried to get this stuff encoded into trade law through intellectual property standards in TPP. But he also dispatched John Kerry to India to try to get them to squash generics. https://t.co/g82cHRhyte

Me: Making things cheaper will affect consumer behavior	Tom: Not if they love freedom https://t.co/wbrwCKOnL7
An alternative view: democracy is good, but democracy needs sustenance. Deliberately undermining democracy (all over the world!) for the sake of capital mobility at all costs was a mistake.
And this is where his rube-shaming is essential to the worldview. Look what happens when you let rubes vote! They elect Trump.
In Tom's portrait, neither powerful lawmakers negotiating trade deals, nor powerful institutions moving huge amounts of capital around the world have agency or responsibility. It's just life. And it's true -- if you assume democracy is bad.
From the 1980s onward, there was a systematic effort to limit the powers of democracy to shape the social order, directing that power to institutions that possessed a lot of financial capital.
Those rules aren't laws of nature. There is no mystical economic order underlying political reality that operates according to its own logic irrespective of law and society.
American Factory Bossman didn't wake up one morning and say, "hmm I will move this production abroad." There were treaties negotiated, laws passed, and elections contested over the specific, detailed terms that would establish the rules of trade.
Globalization wasn't some spontaneous aggregation of producer and consumer tastes. It was a political system created by years of negotiations, proposals, counter-proposals and pretty straightforward ideological debate.
Basically, if you didn't buy so much pointless shiny stuff, globalization would not have happened. But then he flips right around and says globalization was *inevitable.* https://t.co/KiiLFr9bd2
This is a ridiculous caricature, but still instructive. Tom's history of the past 30 years boils down to: "How come you rubes bought all the stuff we were selling?" with a touch of "You didn't deserve the nice stuff rich people invented." https://t.co/50rSvDFuvL

That's bad electoral strategy, and it's not the way Democrats under 40 think about politics, identity or otherwise.
Specifically, Dem leaders only consider identity politics useful or meaningful when they can be deployed as a weapon against lefty ideas about inequality.
She's wrong. But this also illustrates the way the Democratic Party leadership thinks about and practices "identity politics."

Now the same thing is happening with wredtung refugee children from their parents and putting them in camps.
Now it's just standard GOP doctrine to be pro-torture, because it supposedly works.
There has always been a fascist quotient in the GOP, but there was no openly pro-torture wing of the party before George W. Bush, which was why Bush denied the existence of a U.S. torture program.
Watching Fox and Friends defend the separation of children from their parents is just horrifying. It has already hardened into a straight question of partisanship.

This was a policy change the Trump administration *publicly announced.* And Sanders is pretending its a law that is on the books that Trump just can't do anything about. What a disgrace.
Literally nothing is stopping Sarah Huckabee Sanders from saying, "It is wrong to be wresting children from their parents and I cannot stomach being a part of it."
But doing so would complicate things for his future paymasters who, like Ryan himself, have had no problem allying with an authoritarian.
It would be *extremely easy* for Paul Ryan, who is retiring, to say "it is bad to rip children from the arms of their mothers and as Republicans we should not stand for this." https://t.co/IqydsHbUzB

Fairfax County Republicans are bow-tie, khaki and crew-cut Republicans. A group of voters we might have called "Tucker Carlson Republicans" in 1998 or 2006. We're seeing them transform into what we might today call "Tucker Carlson Republicans."
The point here is that Stewart *lost* in 2017 and 2013. His victory last night shows that the GOP is changing -- relative not only to Mitt Romney, but since inauguration day.
This thread is prompting a lot of dumb "economic anxiety" jokes, so I'll elaborate further. https://t.co/O4ziPFxNwR

Trump's takeover of the party is complete. He's not a faction or an aberration. The party likes what it's got.
Stewart just won #VASen by carrying Fairfax County -- a wealthy D.C. suburb -- by a wider margin than the entire state. Suburban Republicans put him over the top.
In 2016, Trump's general election victory hung on a few thousand votes in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. A few thousand votes means every factor was a deciding factor. But gutted manufacturing states were a focal point of the disaster.
But Corey Stewart did just win a statewide GOP race in 2018. He lost one in 2017, and he lost one in 2013. The party really is different today than it was a few years ago.
Corey Stewart isn't winning because liberals said things on about conservatives on the internet or because Kevin Williamson got fired from The Atlantic.
There's this common Twitter burn from liberals now that says conservatives who go fascist or white nationalist must have been bad people all along. And ok, fine.
It's not an accident that it's the GOP that turns for Trump and Corey Stewart and not the Democratic Party. But it's also just not true that the GOP is static.
By the time you get to the general election, most facts we can glean about Trump voters are just facts about Republicans.
This @BenjySarlin story from 2016 is one of very few analyses of Trump voters that actually dealt with the fact that at one point, Trump had to differentiate himself from other Republicans. By the end of the primary, his appeal was partisan. https://t.co/8MTagIX5Rh
Corey Stewart's #VASen margin of victory is substantially less than his win in Fairfax County. Suburban D.C. Republicans put him over the top.
@realBenShapero sure, but it's still a secondary problem
The inability of judges to understand this is a triumph for anti-democratic conceptions of freedom. There is more to democracy than a price mechanism.
The chief threat posed by these mergers is to citizenship, not consumer prices. Monopoly is actively sabotaging the free press. What it means for the price of a cable bundle or a newspaper is a secondary concern.
