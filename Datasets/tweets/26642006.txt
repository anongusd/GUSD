3. But...there‚Äôs nothing in 2A that prevents sensible regulation.  		That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre not ‚Äòpracticing‚Äô your constitutional right to bear arms w/ a pipe bomb or sarin gas or a Huey.  		We the People get to decide how ‚Äòwell-regulated‚Äô you are.
2. My response to all of you 2Aers is this: 		If you‚Äôre in the National Guard, you can carry an M16.  If you‚Äôre in your house defending your family, well, the Supreme Court said that‚Äôs OK too. 		You have the right to bear arms.		BUT...AND IT IS A BIG FUCKING BUT...
1. Hey, 2A zealots!		Let‚Äôs talk about the 2nd Amendment for a second, shall we?		Gun lovers: ‚ÄúShut up, Melissa Alano, you haven‚Äôt been relevant since Who‚Äôs The Boss &amp; I‚Äôm just practicing my 2nd amendment rights. It‚Äôs my constitutional right to own guns. You can‚Äôt have my guns.‚Äù

4. As we remember the Parkland massacre let‚Äôs not forget, we can change the status quo. We can stop this obsession our country has with guns. It does not have to be this way.
3. Since Columbine there have been 231 school shootings, murdering 709 people - 231 of which were children.		The Parkland community said enough. They‚Äôve woken up every morning without their children, sisters, friends, and harnessed that collective pain into collective power.
2. The Parkland community fought for gun safety while being knocked down by those wishing to silence their pain. Let‚Äôs be clear, these were victims being further victimized. 		Instead of retreating into darkness, they arrived into their light. 		And I‚Äôve stood and watched in awe.
1. I didn‚Äôt know the Parkland community a year ago. None of us did. Actually, they didn‚Äôt know themselves to be who they are right now. 		They‚Äôve fought tirelessly in the last year while trying to keep their heads above water. Gasping for air at times. 		(A thread) https://t.co/zdWNNqILsm

4. We describe immigrants as either victims or villains depending on our political ideology. The problem with this is that it‚Äôs void of any nuance.		A physical wall further calcifies this idea of ‚Äúus and them,‚Äù which goes against every thing we‚Äôve ever fought for as a nation.
3. We must give these people legal representation. 		We also need more immigration judges. Currently there are only 750 judges for 750k cases which leaves immigrants waiting for years. Allow due process in a civil space for their stories to be told.
2. We also need more personnel on the ground. 		And most importantly, we need a humane system to allow these human beings a safe path to seeking asylum and potential citizenship.

14. This is but only one dark corner of the evil system of jailing babies. And this is just one facility company. 		There are over 12,000 imprisoned children in the US as I type this. 		Where else are these abuses happening? 		Feeling rage yet?
13. Why are we allowing children who are already traumatized, separated from their parents, incarcerated, and thrown into the arms of a predator to be groped, sodomized, and scarred for the rest of their lives?		I REPEAT‚ÄîTHEY ARE CHILDREN. https://t.co/DqwQ8EHIkn
12. Also, records suggest MCSO didn‚Äôt fully investigate child abuse claims at SWK Migrant Center. 		The reports show neither the Southwest Key employees nor the minors involved were ever interviewed by law enforcement. https://t.co/rkbkx2fz5J
11. Since this letter, one of SWK's facilities has closed. Why? Because of *yet another* allegation of sexual abuse. And this time not by AZDHS, but by the US Dept of Health and Human Services (DHHS). AZDHS had already moved to revoke the licenses of all 13 SWK facilities.
10. AZ Dept of Health Services director Dr. Cara Christ wrote a scathing letter to SWK, shared here. Dr. Christ minced no words, telling SWK the report it provided "demonstrates your organization's inability and unwillingness to comprehend Arizona's most basic licensure laws.‚Äù https://t.co/OhygX4wu9H
9. Biggest problem? Employees didn't have a criminal background check completed. What kind of childcare facility can't be bothered to see if an employee is a sex offender? I'll tell you: one that doesn't care.		That's really what these documents show: No one cared.
8. But what prompted the hundreds of hours of investigation were allegations of vile sexual abuse. 		On Sept 7 a SWK worker who was HIV+, was convicted of 10 counts of sex acts against the children he was tasked to "care" for. 		Reread the last sentence.https://t.co/SG3wOXwW8A
7. SWK's mission statement is "opening doors to opportunity so individuals can achieve their dreams." 		Dreams or nightmares? You decide. 		Out of 13 SWK facilities in Arizona, 10 were found to have serious deficiencies. https://t.co/d1TauRJbMs
6. Their CEO, Juan Sanchez, has made millions off this manmade crisis, profiteering off of the incarceration of children.		Simply put, our government awards contracts to jail babies using our money to subsidize. https://t.co/YnJpyrqFHl
5. SWK enjoys tax-free nonprofit status, and was paid $458 million of our tax dollars in FY2018, and $1.7B over the past decade. 		That's one private detention company ‚Äì not including companies like CoreCivic or Geo Group. That's billions more tax dollars. https://t.co/5WKv3t1cMB
4. In August, Arizona moved to revoke the licenses of all 13 centers in the state.		This. Has. To. Stop. I‚Äôm sick. I feel rage. 		These are CHILDREN. How can we allow this to happen in our name?
3. Southwest Key Programs (SWK) maintains facilities to jail children. 		In June, Senator Merkeley (D-OR) tried to enter a facility and was turned away. SWK called the cops on him. https://t.co/2fLl3015nd

WE THE PEOPLE must vigilantly protect our right to the voting franchise - our most fundamental right as Americans. 		We must get active to stop suppression at the state level, and VOTE on Nov. 6 to elect Democrats who are working to protect your fundamental right to vote.		üñ§ https://t.co/tWGt38Nuoq
The voter suppression we are seeing today makes crystal clear that a robust VRA is as important now as ever. Congress can and should restore the Act to full force and effect. And the Roberts Court should reckon with the egregious and shortsighted mistake it made in Shelby County.
Shelby was also an incredibly activist decision (Republicans love to decry judicial activism, so...ironic). A bare, partisan majority of the court struck down a near-unanimously passed act of Congress and disregarded its extensive factual findings about the need for a strong VRA
The Republicans true motive is clear: suppress the votes of low-income, youth, and minority voters who tend to support Democrats. 		After Shelby County, Republicans again have free rein to do just that. And so they have. https://t.co/SNmDMD8QVP
Under the guise of preventing ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù (which experts say does not meaningfully exist), Republicans push for increasingly restrictive measures like Voter ID laws and aggressive voter roll purges.
Republicans have long embraced voter suppression as a winning political strategy. https://t.co/jPFjFddI96
Immediately after Shelby, many of the jurisdictions formerly subject to DOJ preclearance used their new-found freedom to pass the same bullshit discriminatory voting laws that the VRA so effectively guarded against.
They said the formula by which the covered jurisdictions were chosen was outdated and unconstitutional: the world had changed &amp; the preclearace requirement was no longer justified by the need to protect against discrimination.		Clearly, they were gravely wrong about that. https://t.co/GXqltJlPku
But in 2013, in the 5-4 Shelby County v. Holder decision, John Roberts and the Republican appointees to the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act by killing preclearance. 		(Another reason Supreme Court justices are so important.)
The Voting Rights Act worked. And it was reauthorized repeatedly by Congress with huge, near-unanimous bipartisan majorities.
The most important piece of the Voting Rights Act was that specific jurisdictions w/ histories of discrimination needed to ‚Äúpreclear‚Äù any changes to voting laws. Every time they made a voting change, DOJ would review to see if it was discriminatory &amp; approve or reject the change. https://t.co/bYfeP6O1r5
Let‚Äôs talk voter suppression. 		There was a huge, watershed law passed in 1965 to protect against historic voter discrimination by (mostly) southern states. 		The Voting Rights Act was a crowning achievement of the civil rights era. 		(Thread) https://t.co/un7EadT55R

In conclusion: 		People should be fucking terrified and outraged. I sure as hell am. 		We need to take back our power by taking back the Senate and the House in November. It is the only way out of this mess.
They won‚Äôt be able to provide that check if we let them capture the courts. This goes far beyond the Supreme Court. 		Kavanaugh made big news, but stacking our lower courts with fringe right operatives has been Mitch McConnell‚Äôs absolute #1 priority since trump‚Äôs election.
Kavanaugh is the 69th judge trump has confirmed. That‚Äôs an absolutely insane number. This is all happening quietly and no one is realizing it.		We‚Äôve all seen how important the courts have been in stopping trump‚Äôs most hateful and harmful policies.
THE SENATE IS VITAL. We are focused on the House, and rightly so. But only the senate votes on judges - that goes for lower courts too. So if they keep the senate, even if we win the house, McConnell‚Äôs judge machine keeps on cranking.
Kavanaugh moves it much, much further to the right. It has completely lost touch with the values of majority of Americans. And now its legitimacy is shot.
The Roberts Court was already incredibly partisan. It‚Äôs the most pro-corporate, right-wing Supreme Court in history, handing down over 70 partisan 5-4 decisions in the last decade.
What‚Äôs happened today is the culmination of a 30+ year plan to capture the federal judiciary and use our courts to line their pockets and suppress the will of the people.
That they supported Kavanaugh despite his obvious and disqualifying flaws - temperament, dishonesty, rabid partisanship, credible accusations of sexual assault - speaks to how beholden they are to these special interest powers, and how critical the Court is in their plan.
They picked Kavanaugh because they know he is a reliable vote; he is a lifelong foot soldier for these interests, a political operative who became one of the most partisan ideological judges in the country.
My thoughts on this sad day for America (a thread):		Right-wing &amp; corporate special interests selected this nominee and propped up his nomination with tens of millions of dollars in dark money. 		We need to prioritize protecting our courts, which starts with retaking the Senate.

I am available to speak further should you wish to discuss. I am currently REDACTED and will be in REDACTED.	 	In confidence, REDACTED.
It is upsetting to discuss sexual assault and its repercussions, yet I felt guilty and compelled as a citizen about the idea of not saying anything.
I have received medical treatment regarding the assault. On July 6 I notified my local government representative to ask them how to proceed with sharing this information .
I have not knowingly seen Kavanaugh since the assault. I did see REDACTED once at the REDACTED where he was extremely uncomfortable seeing me.
Both loudly stumbled down the stair well at which point other persons at the house were talking with them. I exited the bathroom, ran outside of the house and went home.
After a few attempts to get away, I was able to take this opportune moment to get up and run across to a hallway bathroom. I locked the bathroom door behind me.
From across the room a very drunken REDACTED said mixed words to Kavanaugh ranging from "go for it" to "stop."	 	At one point when REDACTED jumped onto the bed the weight on me was substantial. The pile toppled, and the two scrapped with each other.
Kavanaugh was on top of me while laughing with REDACTED, who periodically jumped onto Kavanaugh. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state. With Kavanaugh's hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.
Kavanaugh physically pushed me into a bedroom as I was headed for a bathroom up a short stair well from the living room. They locked the door and played loud music precluding any successful attempt to yell for help.
The assault occurred in a suburban Maryland area home at a gathering that included me and four others.
Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted me during high school in the early 1980's. He conducted these acts with the assistance of REDACTED.		Both were one to two years older than me and students at a local private school.
I am writing with information relevant in evaluating the current nominee to the Supreme Court.	As a constituent, I expect that you will maintain this as confidential until we have further opportunity to speak.
