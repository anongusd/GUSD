Thanks for a great #CreditChat today, @Experian - and we hope everyone is excited for #GetSmartAboutCredit Day tomorrow! https://t.co/T4YUOHmduc https://t.co/kNyMHVaEJi
A8: Be honest about how a credit mistake happened and what you‚Äôre doing to fix it. Explain what you would have done differently. #GetSmartAboutCredit #CreditChat
A7: Our Roadmap to Financial Responsibility is a great place to start when it comes to learning how financial education evolves as kids grow up: https://t.co/DOZrwR1IHv #GetSmartAboutCredit #CreditChat https://t.co/78xieZNPmh
A7: Explain the many life milestones in which credit scores play a role. Our #GetSmartAboutCredit program also offers lessons on credit scores! #CreditChat
A6: Parents can share with kids and teens how their own credit scores affected purchases of items like housing, vehicles, and more. #GetSmartAboutCredit #CreditChat
A5: Parents should teach their kids and teens that credit cards are a loan that must be repaid to avoid interest, or harm to credit scores. Always try to pay the statement balance in full, not the minimum payment. #GetSmartAboutCredit #CreditChat
A4: Or better yet, if you‚Äôre a banker you can register for the ABA Foundation‚Äôs free #GetSmartAboutCredit program and lead financial education presentations in schools in your community! https://t.co/ie4gMHZAbg #CreditChat https://t.co/kjrBVbzykd
A4: Show your kid or teen your credit card statement and talk about how you pay it off each month and what happens if you don‚Äôt pay it on time. #CreditChat #GetSmartAboutCredit
A3: One easy way is to provide kids and teens with age appropriate financial themed reading. Need recommendations? Try our Reading Pays poster: https://t.co/vCDghvQoof #GetSmartAboutCredit #CreditChat https://t.co/MU3nohJAb2
A2: Anything from the responsibilities + benefits of credit, to student loan repayment, to shopping around for the best interest rates. Our #GetSmartAboutCredit program presentation materials cover it all: https://t.co/LaEtwIM2hO https://t.co/wAqJdSGApq
A1: Financial lessons last a lifetime! Credit is also critical to post-secondary success, as many young people start their adult lives with significant student loan debt. #GetSmartAboutCredit #CreditChat
We're excited to be joining this chat today! #CreditChat #GetSmartAboutCredit https://t.co/KjdmBwTxQx
Outdated @FDICgov rules are unnecessarily suppressing the interest rates that community banks want to offer their customers. Community banks should be able to offer competitive rates in their own communities, and it looks like the FDIC is willing to give the rules a look.
FDIC deposit rules from the 90‚Äôs have become out of touch with how customers like to bank. Glad to hear @FDICgov is interested in updating the rules for modern banking. @rachelwitkowski does a great job of breaking down the disconnect in @AmerBanker. https://t.co/5E3uSjz5HK
