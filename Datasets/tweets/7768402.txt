Judge says Stone‚Äôs release under current conditions would pose a risk to the public. https://t.co/wEN8cw2Umd
JUDGE to STONE: "Thank you, but the apology rings quite hollow." https://t.co/wEN8cw2Umd
Judge says Stone has "decided to pursue a strategy of attacking others." Says Stone couldn‚Äôt keep story straight on the stand. Says Instagram post had a ‚Äúmore sinister message.‚Äù Roger Stone, fully understands the power of words and symbols, she says.
Judge Amy Berman Jackson says she's not convinced that Stone is all talk. Says the post created a very real risk. "These were deliberate choices."  https://t.co/wEN8cw2Umd
The judge is back.
We're past the 15 minute mark with no sign of the judge. Stone is sitting at the defense table, looking around the courthouse, playing with his glasses and talking with his attorneys. Took a deep breath or two.
@gtconway3d no problem, George.
"I'm going to take a break to try and absorb this, but I'm going to come back and rule," says judge. Expects she'll be back in 15 minutes.
Judge Berman Jackson says Stone has "insisted" that his name has been in the media every day since Stone's arrest.		"After he apologized, he continued talking every single day."
Stone attorney says his client is a person who is "used to talking," but has learned his lesson. Lawyer says Stone wants a second chance. Again says Stone apologizes.		Lawyer: "It's not even close, it's indefensible."		Judge: "I agree with you there."
Stone has named four of his volunteers, after testifying he has five or six. Stone says he can't recall all the names of the volunteers working for him a few days ago. One or two Stone volunteers must be feeling pretty left our right now.
STONE: "My house is like a headquarters, I have many volunteers."		JUDGE: I thought you said five?		STONE: Five is a lot.

STONE: "I do not exclusively use my own phone, that's what I'm saying." Suggests someone else may have used his phone to find images of Judge Berman Jackson. Said none of his volunteers would own up to selecting the images Stone chose from.
"The passive voice is not helpful," Judge Berman Jackson tells Stone as he answers questions about his volunteers and his social media operation.
JUDGE: "You saw it, and you said, 'Okay, I'm going to post this'?" 		STONE: I'm sorry, it was a mistake, etc.
This is not going well for Stone, who can't say who sent him the image, or whether it was sent via text or email. Says he has five or six volunteers.
"I have no rationalization or excuse," says Stone, again calling it an error. Special Counsel gets to take a shot at Stone next.
Stone tells Judge Berman Jackson it was improper for him to criticize the judge at all. Again calls it an "egregious, stupid mistake."
Judge is now questioning Stone about the Instagram post. Judge is interested in the notion that he's not responsible for what gets posted on his Instagram. Asks if he knows how to Google.		"How hard was it to come up with a photograph that doesn't have crosshairs in the corner?"
Stone claims he's having trouble putting food on the table and paying his rent.
STONE: "I can only say I'm sorry yet again it was an egregious mistake." Tells judge he's sorry he abused her trust. Says he's not being paid to speak about the case. "Perhaps I talk to much, but I am under enormous pressure."
STONE: "This is just a stupid lapse in judgment." Says his business has dried up and he's exhausted his savings. "My apology is sincere and it it heartfelt."
STONE: "I believe I abused the order, for which I am heart fully sorry. I am kicking myself over my own stupidity... I offer no excuse for it, no justification..." Calls it a lapse in judgement called by stress.
Roger Stone is now taking the stand.
Defense attorney says he want to put Stone on the witness stand. Judge says he'll give him that opportunity. Defense attorney says Stone "would like to have another opportunity to comply" with the judge's order.
U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson is at the bench. The Instagram post has been marked as Exhibit 1.

Barr said the "overarching public interest" is for Mueller to finish his work and had a tough time anticipating a circumstance in which he'd fire the special counsel.		‚ÄúIt's unimaginable to me that Bob would ever do anything that gave rise to good cause."		https://t.co/0kC7pst9PN
Barr says he didn't want to join Trump's private legal head and ‚Äústick my head into that meat grinder" at this point in his career. https://t.co/0kC7pst9PN
Barr said he'd consult with DOJ's career ethics officials about potential recusal in the Mueller probe, but didn't commit to following their advice. Said he'd make decision "in good faith" based on the law and the facts. https://t.co/0kC7pst9PN
William Barr's confirmation hearing is recessed for lunch. Barr called Bob Mueller a "straight shooter" and says he doesn't believe the special counsel "would be involved in a witch hunt." https://t.co/0kC7pst9PN
"I understand that things have changed since 1992," Barr says about sentencing policies. Says he held onto beliefs on harsh sentencing longer than others, and suggests it was because he was out of the prosecuting business for awhile and didn't keep up with how things changed.
Barr, responding to a line of inquiry about why he's willing to take this gig: "I had a very good life, I have a very good life. I love it. But I also want to help in this circumstance, and I am not going to do anything that I think is wrong." Says he won't be bullied by anyone.
Sen. Grassley questions Barr about a 1992 DOJ report titled "The Case for More Incarceration."		Barr says he believes the crime rate is much lower today because of tough-on-crime policies, but that he has no problem revisiting sentencing laws.		https://t.co/cJEoxsC2Sl
Barr says that, hypothetically, a president would be violating his constitutional obligations if he interfered in an investigation in which he has a personal interest, such as a case involving him or a member of his family.
Barr says he first raised concerns about the Mueller investigation in a lunch with Rosenstein early in 2018, and that Rosenstein had no visible response.
Barr says Sessions probably did the right thing by recusing himself from the Russia investigation and that he has a lot of respect for Rosenstein.
"I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt," says Barr. He says he trusts Mueller to treat the president and the American people fairly.

Judge Sullivan is now back at the bench. Stay tuned. üçø
Michael Flynn and his lawyers are now back at the defense table, awaiting the judge. 		Here‚Äôs what happened at this remarkable hearing so far: https://t.co/Ry9S8n7p0b
They‚Äôre now taking a recess until 12:30, at Flynn‚Äôs request.
Judge Sullivan even asked the government whether Flynn could have been charged with treason for interfering in Russian sanctions imposed by Obama administration. Government didn‚Äôt want to go there.
Judge Sullivan is now asking government if Flynn could have been charged under the Logan Act, or if there are any other charges that Flynn could have faced.
Judge Sullivan: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hiding my disgust, my distain for this criminal offense.‚Äù 		Says he can‚Äôt guarantee he‚Äôs going to avoid incarceration. Gives Flynn yet another opportunity to speak with his lawyers.
Judge Sullivan to Michael Flynn: ‚ÄúArguably, you sold your country out."
Judge Sullivan: 		‚ÄúThis crime is very serious.‚Äù 		‚ÄúIn the White House! In the West Wing!‚Äù		‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very serious offense.‚Äù		‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt minimize that.‚Äù
Judge Sullivan: So Flynn could‚Äôve also been charged in that indictment unsealed in Virginia yesterday, right? Gov: Yes. 		Judge Sullivan: ‚ÄúExposure to Mr. Flynn would have been significant?‚Äù Gov: Yes.
Gov says the decision to proceed to sentencing is based on the totality of Flynn's assistance. Has already provided ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of his potential cooperation. Highlights indictment unsealed yesterday against Flynn‚Äôs business partner.
Judge Sullivan: Is Mr. Flynn still cooperating?		Gov: It ‚Äúremains a possibility‚Äù that he‚Äôs still cooperating.
Judge Sullivan giving Flynn one final shot to withdraw his guilty plea. Judge asks if he wants to proceed.		FLYNN: ‚ÄúI would like to proceed.‚Äù		Because you‚Äôre guilty? 		FLYNN: ‚ÄúYes, your honor.‚Äù		Now proceeding.
Judge Sullivan, question Flynn lawyer: How is raising those contentions about the circumstances under which Mr. Flynn lied consistent with acceptance of responsibility?
Does he want to postpone? No. Wanna chat with your lawyers in another room? No.
Judge Sullivan is making sure it‚Äôs abundantly clear that Michael Flynn is pleading guilty because he‚Äôs guilty. That he lied to the FBI, that he knew it was wrong to lie to the FBI.
Judge Sullivan asks Flynn if he wished to challenge the circumstances by which he was interviewed by the FBI. "No, your honor."
Michael Flynn‚Äôs sentencing hearing is now underway.

Somehow, it has only been one year ‚Äî 365 days ‚Äî since Mueller dropped his first indictments against Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos.
MacArthur spent more than $5 million of his own money to win the seat in 2014. In 2016, the Democrats didn‚Äôt field a serious challenger: the nominee raised a grand total of $600.
Despite voting for Democratic presidential candidates, the district has pretty much always sent a Republican to Congress. MacArthur moved down to the district from North Jersey after former Eagles offensive tackle Jon Runyan decided not run again in 2014.
The district went for Obama twice, but Trump won by 6 points. Polling shows the district dead split on Trump: 49 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove. Both candidates are pitching themselves as bipartisan. https://t.co/l8vKim94rO

Judge Ellis also complained that ‚Äúif you read the newspapers‚Äù it makes it seem like he‚Äôs always taking the defense team‚Äôs side.
There was a lot of coverage about Judge Ellis saying (before trial) that Mueller‚Äôs team was only going after Manafort to get to Trump. 		But he‚Äôll instruct jurors that they should ignore any argument about DOJ‚Äôs motive or lack of motive in bringing this particular prosecution.
Andres, addressing defense argument about missing witnesses: ‚ÄúDoes anyone really think we need more witnesses, more documents?‚Äù
A strong (and short) rebuttal from the special counsel team just wrapped up.		‚ÄúThe defense is asking you to ignore your own common sense,‚Äù Greg Andres said.		Judge is now going through jury instructions, which will take up the rest of the day.
Government gets 17 minutes of rebuttal, per judge. Court starts back up in 5 minutes, then jury instructions before they begin deliberations. üèõüìµ
Manafort lawyer said trusting Gates was a ‚Äúbig mistake‚Äù and that Gates had ‚Äúshowed himself to be the liar that he is.‚Äù Said government made a deal because they were ‚Äúdesperate to make a case‚Äù against a Manafort, and that Gates ‚Äúfell apart‚Äù on cross examination.
Manafort‚Äôs team vaguely suggested there were some ulterior motives to the prosecution, saying that some of the charges were rare and that ‚Äúthere are plenty of things that have not come out in this courtroom.‚Äù
Also said that no banks complained about being defrauded by Manafort, and that this didn‚Äôt come up ‚Äúuntil the special counsel showed up and started asking questions.‚Äù
Also disputed the notion that Manafort was going broke when he joined Trump campaign, claimed he had substantial holding and a ‚Äúrobust‚Äù net worth but no income as a ‚Äúvolunteer on a political campaign.‚Äù
In closing argument, Manafort‚Äôs team once again returned to the tactic of attacking Rick Gates. Their other tactic was saying that taxes and laws are really complicated, who knows how they work. Also emphasized that reasonable doubt is a really high burden.
Closing arguments from Manafort‚Äôs team start at 1:30 sharp. üê∞‚öñÔ∏èüê¢ https://t.co/hjsfA4TG84
