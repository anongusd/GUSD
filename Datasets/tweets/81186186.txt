@farhip And must have considered multiple times while running for office whether to own the mistake and apologize and chose instead to hope it never got found.

1. Holding public office is not a right. It’s a public trust.		2. People who’ve erred should be able to redeem themselves &amp; serve, but have to make case for redemption to voters based on full information.		3. Racist GOPers who haven’t even tried to apologize should resign too.
@dominique6138 I am absolutely giving that chance. I believe in it. It’s how we improve. But to serve in public office, you have to make the case you’ve redeemed yourself to voters and give them all the information. Northam didn’t do that. Voters had a right to decide about this when they voted

@dsheldonboggs @gtconway3d It’s not that it’s permanently disqualifying. I completely agree with you. We want people to learn, improve and reform.

@EWErickson Or you could just credit Democrats with having more principles than today’s Republican Party.
He’ll be lucky if he stays on through the weekend. Resign. Ask forgiveness. Prove you’ve reformed. But not while serving as governor. Forgiveness is given if you ask and earn it but it’s completely wrong to force this on Virginians who didn’t know this when they voted for you. https://t.co/LIclG9ELOZ

@AndyGrewal I’m not changing the goal posts. I stand by my tweet, if the President engaged in political activity on this trip and campaign doesn’t reimburse a portion per the regs, that’s a violation of the law, not some norm.
@AndyGrewal One more: the key point here is in the WH I served, everyone including POTUS cared about these rules, both the letter and spirit of them. And they took pains to comply. People weren’t perfect, but they tried to be. That Trump neither knows them nor cares is the larger problem.
@AndyGrewal I never said a Hatch Act applies to President. That’s not the point. Taxpayer funds were used to support this trip and if POTUS engaged in political activity on it, that’s a violation unless taxpayers are appropriately reimbursed. /end
@AndyGrewal If true that POTUS gave out campaign gear on trip, at a minimum it’s a “mixed” trip, requiring some cost allocation. As I tweeted originally, reporters should ask if campaign reimbursing at all. We did this countless times as did Bush folks. /2
@AndyGrewal When POTUS takes a trip, costs are involved (AFO costs, staff costs etc). In prior WH’s the counsel’s office determines if a trip is “official,” “political” or “mixed” based on what happens on trip then applies cost allocation formula from regs to applicable costs. /1

@AndyGrewal The Hatch Act does not apply to the President. But 5 CFR 734 implements the Hatch Act and requires an allocation of all trip costs when political activity takes place. If the facts described were true and campaign didn’t pay portion, that’s a violation. https://t.co/6vOi8Gq8KP

Yesterday we learned Trump wants to turn federal law enforcement into weapon to go after his opponents. Today he tries to delegitimize independent judiciary. For those who still think he's not an authoritarian threatening foundation of our country, time to move that hand. https://t.co/AqRgnznm2Y
Trump is trying to gin up personal fight between himself and the courts in order to delegitimize them in eyes of his base. Once he does that, it'll be hard for GOP to defend independent judiciary. Then it becomes a partisan football. Then rule of law dies. https://t.co/Tw4Pfepw6Y
Wow. Many have shrugged off some of Trump's worst acts as "just rhetoric." This is a remarkable statement by the Chief Justice that rhetoric matters.

Founders anticipated this very danger &amp; interposed Senate consent rule to stop POTUS installing loyalist as AG. Its why we, @MyConstitution and S Blumenthal, Whitehouse and Hirono sued to challenge the apptment as reported by @charlie_savage @npfandos /8: https://t.co/28sbhuG2o9
We now know from @maggieNYT and @nytmike that the President is very willing to use DOJ to prosecute opponents and that the only thing stopping him before were lawyers unwilling to do his bidding. Their departure and arrival of a loyalist as AG is therefore deeply concerning. /7
This week @lawfareblog unearthed fascinating history about how President Nixon disregarded many of these principles. His actions specifically in this regard were central to the impeachment movement in Congress and his resignation. That story is here /6: https://t.co/K3YwuwXwoB
The constitutional principles that are designed to prevent presidential interference in the independent enforcement of the law were also explained in this brief filed by @PreetBharara @JohnWDean @JoyceWhiteVance and more bipartisan former DOJ officials /5: https://t.co/JQs8qO3dUV
Those rules derive from principles in the constitution, including guarantees of due process, equal protection and the President's oath to "faithfully" execute the law. An explanation of how those constitutional principles apply to this story is here /4: https://t.co/TpQGgvIIdL
In the past, protecting law enforcement independence from WH interference was done via a set of rules that covered WH staff. Presidents voluntarily complied with the spirit of those rules as well. You can see a summary of them here /3: https://t.co/rad1RVMF7w

@JoanAnzelmo @farhip @CNN @Acosta @ReliableSources @brianstelter This is correct
@farhip @CNN @Acosta @ReliableSources @brianstelter Not just argue, he wanted to revoke @Acosta’s credentials. SHS didn’t decide herself to revoke them the day after the election. As our complaint in @PENamerican v. Trump alleges, Trump is directing this personally. He wanted to show he could do this as a sign to others.

If Republicans hold a 50 or 51 vote Senate majority, remember one of those votes will be Mitt Romney, who may not take orders from McConnell or Trump, and unlike Flake or Corker may have constituency support for that.
The strong rejection of Kris Kobach is a rejection of voter suppression and some of the worst aspects of lawless, racist, power-grabbery.
@DavidAFrench It’s not judges David, it’s geography and the original compromise. Polling is not pro-Kavanaugh.

@davidfrum made some predictions in March 2017 that have been largely born out. Now read the things I didn't quote. Some are scarier, but not less plausible, and still could happen. If they do, we will indeed live in an autocracy. But we have a chance to stop this. Nov. 6. #VOTE
"People crack jokes about Trump’s National Security Agency listening in on them. ... [but] it’s just common sense to be careful what you say in an email or on the phone."
"African Americans, young people, and the recently naturalized encounter increasing difficulties casting a vote in most states. But for all the talk of the rollback of rights, corporate America still seeks diversity in employment. Same-sex marriage remains the law of the land."
"Ambitious Republican plans notwithstanding, the American social-welfare system, as most people encounter it, has remained largely intact during Trump’s first term."
...Yet somehow all of this earnest effort feels less and less relevant to American politics. President Trump communicates with the people directly via his Twitter account, ushering his supporters toward favorable information at Fox News or Breitbart."
"Trump-critical media do continue to find elite audiences. Their investigations still win Pulitzer Prizes; their reporters accept invitations to anxious conferences about corruption, digital-journalism standards, the end of nato, and the rise of populist authoritarianism....
"Nobody’s repealed the First Amendment, of course, and Americans remain as free to speak their minds as ever—provided they can stomach seeing their timelines fill up with obscene abuse and angry threats from the pro-Trump troll armies that police Facebook and Twitter."
"Meanwhile, social media circulate ever-wilder rumors. Some people believe them; others don’t. It’s hard work to ascertain what is true."
"The proposed merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner was delayed for more than a year"
"Wise business leaders take care to credit Trump’s personal leadership for any good news, and to avoid saying anything that might displease the president or his family."
"The business community learned its lesson early. “You work for me, you don’t criticize me,” the president was reported to have told one major federal contractor, after knocking billions off his company’s stock-market valuation with an angry tweet."
"Trump loyalists shouldered aside the pre-Trump leadership."
"As the air filled with allegations of insider trading and crony capitalism, the public subsided into weary cynicism."
"Most Americans intuit that their president and his relatives have become vastly wealthier over the past four years. But rumors of graft are easy to dismiss. Because Trump has never released his tax returns, no one really knows. Anyway, doesn’t everybody do it?"
"The president regularly tweets out news of factory openings and big hiring announcements: “I’m bringing back your jobs,” he has said over and over. Voters seem to have believed him—and are grateful."
"Concerns about Trump’s purported conflicts of interest excited debate in Washington but never drew much attention from the wider American public."
"The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies"
I'm going to quote a few lines from it that today read like history, not prediction: "Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic."
It is bone chilling to re-read this @davidfrum from the beginning of 2017. Just read it. So much of it has happened or seems vastly more plausible than it did back then. 		The water is simmering. We are the frog. Nov 6 we either jump out of the pot or...  https://t.co/nVmukg7dX5

@mvandemar @marty_lederman @PreetBharara This I believe is the memo/advice I’m recalling: “We are aware of no basis for drawing a distinction as to the legal effectiveness of a presidential action based on the form or caption of the written document through which that action is conveyed.” https://t.co/mwOdIYQZLF
@marty_lederman @PreetBharara But absent such a clarification (which I agree Wray should seek), isn’t the default best read that it is a directive? The President said publicly I want the FBI to do x. Barring anything else, why wouldn’t that be the latest directive from the President?
@marty_lederman @PreetBharara Whatever he previously told FBI, wouldn’t this tweet supersede that?
@JoyceWhiteVance Whatever order existed before, this tweet supersedes it. This tweet is a presidential order to FBI.
@marty_lederman @PreetBharara I recall OLC telling us in WHC that a presidential order need not take any particular form. If President orders something, however he does it, it’s a valid order. I read this tweet as an order to FBI overriding anything WH staff told the FBI. Is that your read @marty_lederman?
Note to @FBI: whatever instructions White House staff gave you, the President’s tweet below is actually (no, really I’m not kidding) an order from the President.

Why did Trump - who admires autocratic strongmen around the world - pick Kavanaugh? Here’s why: https://t.co/B3xciRrGar
This was disturbing to watch. If Kavanaugh is willing to pander to Trump like this when (a) it’s blatantly untrue and (b) he no longer needs anything from Trump, then we have our answer on whether Kavanaugh would be a check on Trump as a Justice. https://t.co/vkXkHcyeHG

An expert on the Middle East I spoke to the other day said when he read that Kavanaugh believed a President shouldn't be able to be sued or indicted in office, he thought "that sounds like Mubarakism" in Egypt.
If Trump - facing multiple civil suits and a criminal investigation - nominates a Justice who has said he doesn't think a President should be subject to those things in office, the conflict of interest here is mindblowing. The Court needs to be a check on Trump, not a blank one.

Unlike Trump, the #RoadmapForRenewal is actually generating support from the right and left, as @JRubinBlogger details here: https://t.co/zwCqfUn7SQ /12
Check out the #RoadmapForRenewal and add your comments, because it's up to all of us to stand up together for our democracy: https://t.co/LXusSSv3La /11
We @protctdemocracy are instead bringing people from left &amp; right together around agenda for protecting democracy. This week we rolled out our #RoadmapForRenewal - A Legislative Blueprint for the next Congress. We shared it w @realDonaldTrump today: https://t.co/ZJcNELWHQa /10
Third, the only one making excuses about elections is Trump himself, who keeps denying reality and endangering our national security in order to pretend he won the popular vote. /9
Bipartisan National Security leaders including @JohnBrennan @GenMhayden @McFaul @MichaelJMorell Jim Clapper and others filed a remarkable brief in the case underscoring that Russia's MO is very much in line with the allegations in the case: https://t.co/DA2rvPvo43 /8
Far from "winning" this case or being absolved of conspiring with Russia, this case could very likely proceed in a different court. The conspiracy claims are very alive and real. /7
But in making that decision, the Judge went out of her way to state that “it bears emphasizing that this Court’s ruling is not based on a finding that there was no collusion between defendants and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.” /6 https://t.co/Lc2x5lwLRV
We disagree with that ruling and think it gets the law wrong but, unlike how Trump reacts to court decisions he dislikes (more on that here https://t.co/SUZnbg18U6), we respect the Judge and the Court's decision. /5
Second, Trump did not "win" the case as he claims. As is being reported by many in the media in response to his tweet, the Judge ruled only that the case was in the wrong court. https://t.co/Lw5PDnv8Wk /4
These voters sued the Trump Campaign for conspiring with Russia to dump their private data online in violation of their privacy rights and civil rights. See more here: https://t.co/Wxhs9a05N7 /3
So for example, a few things @realDonaldTrump is misleading about. First, the case was not brought by @DNC. It was brought by @protctdemocracy on behalf of American voters who were injured when their private info like SS#s were hacked and dumped to the world. /2
Trump (surprise) has his facts wrong about our suit, but what's worse: The plaintiffs @protctdemocracy represents are 3 Americans (not crazies) who had private lives hacked &amp; dumped on web.

Because if it turns out Trump has broken the law but he can avoid accountability by choosing his own judge in a manner designed to insulate himself (and don't kid yourself if you think the Senate GOP is going to be a check on this), then we will have lost our democracy. /end
The #KennedyRetirement is only 24 hours old so I don't propose to have all the solutions worked out to this problem here, but it's a problem that should be getting more attention and thought to what the right solutions are. /8
In that sense, the mess of the Donald Trump presidency, which stems entirely from his own norm-breaking and potentially even law-breaking behavior, is now a colossal mess for our constitutional system. /7
That is simply not a viable scenario for a democracy rooted in the rule of law. It's a simple concept: the accused may not choose who will be judge in their case. /6
That could come via Trump being subpoenaed and fighting it, being indicted and fighting it, or even trying to pardon himself. All of those things, if they happen, would likely be resolved not just by the Supreme Court, but specifically by whoever Trump next appoints. /5
It's therefore not just possible, but I'd say it's likely that whoever Trump nominates may cast the decisive vote that determines whether Trump is civilly or criminally exposed on any of these things. /4
Yet that's exactly what might happen here. Trump is currently under investigation on a range of fronts, from whether he obstructed justice to whether he colluded with Russia to whether his pre-presidency business dealings were on the up and up. /3
But I cannot think of a prior example of a President appointing a justice who could rule on that President's personal exposure to serious criminal or civil liability. /2
A short THREAD on a huge issue: A major thing missing to me so far in the #KennedyRetirement coverage is this: all Presidents who appoint justices might have those justices rule on their official acts, like policy initiatives or legislation. /1

RT @protctdemocracy: When we talk about authoritarian tendencies, this is what we are talking about.		https://t.co/c8sxuLEvOu
Except perhaps that it’s a trait that, on a purely human level, @realDonaldTrump could stand to have a lot more of. For his own sake, and for the sake of the nation. /end
It’s an important lesson in his book and in his actions and it’s got nothing to do with politics. /18
I believe today’s op-ed from @Comey is not about spinning the IG report but is instead about all of this: trying to make sure an institution he loves, the FBI, grows from this episode, and that all of us become more growth mindset about life. /17
… so that as our country goes through trying times, we use it as a chance to learn and grow. /16
As much as @Comey has important things to say to the country about political facts and events, it’s clear he also wants to try to pass on what he’s learned about being growth mindset to the country as well… /15
It has been among the most powerful principles we’ve followed and has allowed us to not just be effective in our first year of operations, but it ensures we’re constantly improving and maximizing every opportunity to learn. /14
At my organization, @protctdemocracy, we instill this same principle of being growth #mindset, both for the individual members of our team, and for our organization as a whole. /13 https://t.co/6Yk8WLiMNQ
And he clearly doesn’t agree with the IG’s conclusions. But he also sees great value for himself, the FBI, and all of us, from inviting scrutiny, review and the generation of lessons learned in every experience. /12
That doesn’t mean he’s not also laying out his thinking so people can compare it to the reasoning in the IG report. He clearly does that. /11
Today’s op-ed is his attempt to make sure that our institutions learn lessons the same way, and that this IG report, which he knows will be a political football, also serves that noble end. /10
But it’s also clear he deliberately cabins that aspect of his personal reaction in order to maximize the degree to which he can learn from every experience and improve from it. /9
That’s not to say failure or criticism doesn’t hurt. It’s clear he was deeply troubled by the possibility of making a mistake or even just being seen as having made one. /8
He’s constantly seeking lessons in all around him, and does not see everything that happening around and about him as a threatening judgment on his value as a person. /7
If you read Comey’s book, listen to his public appearances, and read today’s op-ed, you can see he’s deeply committed to being growth mindset about life. /6
Having a growth #mindset means recognizing that we are all vessels capable of constant improvement, and that life is a series of opportunities to learn and grow. /5
The Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck has described this as having a #GrowthMindset in her book Mindset. /4 https://t.co/7EtuJFB5Ce
Instead, @Comey is exhibiting a trait we all could benefit from more of in society and our institutions, including internalizing it for ourselves personally: the constant search for how we can always be learning and improving. /3
There are many who will try to say today’s @Comey op-ed is mere spin, trying to save face in light of the IG faulting his handling of the Clinton investigation. But if you’ve been really listening to Comey, it’s clear that’s not what is driving it. /2

So to recap: Trump’s theory is wrong, they’ve applied it overbroadly as even if right it only applies to a sliver of the suspected conduct, and it’s no protection against impeachment. /End. For more on all this, @protctdemocracy has you covered: https://t.co/DbCn7gKKx6
Conservative lawyers who believe in the unitary executive should be very public and clear that the theory is not a license to presidents to obstruct justice, and that if one does, impeachment is a proper remedy. /22
It’s critical that the media, public and Congress not buy it. As both the underlying theory is wrong, and even if it were right, it only means if Trump did obstruct, he should be impeached. /21
The deliberate leak of this memo is part of what will be a concerted public campaign to make those fudges and try to win over the court of public opinion. /20
And any sound lawyer would agree they are criminally chargeable, at a minimum after a president leaves office, if not before. /19
If, on the other hand, the President told a witness to lie, or dangled a pardon to induce a witness to obstruct, those are not Article II powers under any theory. /18
The other way the Trump team is pulling a fast one is that the theory, even if one bought it, would only apply to the President shutting down an investigation. /17
But that’s not what the theory actually holds.  Trump’s lawyers think they can fudge not being chargeable and not being impeachable as the same thing. They're not. /16
But the Trump lawyers plan to spin the theory to say that it means not only can Trump not be criminally charged, but that there’s actually nothing inherently wrong with him obstructing and thus it’s not a grounds for impeachment either. /15
In fact, the unitary executive theory is actually precisely that the president can end any investigation and if he abuses that power, the remedy is impeachment. /14
It would say nothing about whether the President can be impeached for the same acts. /13
But here’s the rub: that unitary executive theory would only extend to saying the President can’t be charged with the crime of obstruction for trying to end an investigation. /12
And so the Trump team expects to get support from conservative legal scholars on this. /11
That theory argues that the President can do basically what he wants with the Justice Dept because all executive power, including the power to open or close an investigation, ultimately emanates from the President. /10
But here’s the other tricky thing the Trump team is trying to do. They know that some conservative legal scholars believe in something called the “Unitary Executive” theory. /9
Here, if he were to interfere with an investigation in order to protect himself, his family, or his aides, that’s not a “faithful execution” and therefore is beyond his constitutional executive powers. /8
In this case, it means the President has to execute the laws “in good faith” – in other words, to advance the public interest and not some corrupt, self-interested purpose. /7
The word “faithfully” there has to mean something as constitutional interpretation requires every word to be there for a reason. /6 See also this brief by @preetbharara @johnwdean @joycewhitevance et al https://t.co/5bWRSeA81j
As @protctdemocracy has explained at length, among other reasons, the Constitution charges POTUS to “faithfully execute” the law. /5 https://t.co/vhTWoqmSXI
There are 2 problems with this theory. The 1st is that it’s wrong. /4 https://t.co/ehusvK22zV
Trump floated this theory himself a few months back when he claimed to have “an absolute right” to do whatever he wants with the Justice Dept. /3
The Trump lawyers are trying to pull a fast one in a few ways. First, they’re trying to say Trump can’t commit the crime of obstruction of justice because he runs the justice department and can do whatever he wants with it. /2
