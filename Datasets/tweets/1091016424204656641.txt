@dick_nixon He could emerge as  a compromise candidate: A white, male, Christian with progressive-leanings. He won't scare off the center; he may do enough to appease the far left if they're scared of Trump winning (which they should be). Inslee's undoing will be debates, if he gets there.
@Zigmanfreud He's certainly not alone in that thinking. It also explains how someone can be a racist but "have black friends". Everyone who doesn't register on Trump's scale is lumped into "The Others", and the prism for them is a racist, sexist, elitist worldview.
@KevinMKruse @AlexYablon What Carter didn't address is that during these "Skittles parties" all the kids' parents were next door throwing their keys into a bowl.

@JuddLegum The day I hug someone like Mark Meadows is the day I do so to put a "Kick Me" sign on his back.
I thought @RepCummings kind words about Cohen in his closing were unwarranted and in general I thought both sides displayed a (perhaps by design) naivete about human nature and behavior. Like when @HouseGOP couldn't fathom Trump saying racist things in private.
You can appreciate @MichaelCohen212 testimony while also acknowledging he's a sleazeball who acted of his own volition. He didn't "make mistakes", he willfully broke the law and behaved like an asshole. He's no better than @realDonaldTrump. #CohenHearing #MichaelCohen

@GOP If everything Cohen says is a lie... Trump his his wife, had a lovechild, thinks his son is brilliant.
@brithume The idea that Trump didn't know or influence Cohen's character is absurd. As is the idea that Trump doesn't say things in private that he doesn't in public. People who think otherwise are children and deserve to be played like suckers by con artists like Trump and Cohen.
@HOOISJG @shanebrighton Those are tax withholdings; they're not sales. The executives had restricted stock awards vest. When the awards vest the company automatically withholds delivery of some of those shares, applying the value to the tax liability. This is a common practice.
@WashingtonSRC Please add, "So long as the parents or guardian are not disruptive and understand that if their kids don't learn about jimmy hats they'll be helping change diapers sooner rather than later."
Trump's racism comes in many forms, including "there's black people and N-word" type. That's a classic form of racism not just among the wealthy but the working class too. I've heard it for decades from both camps. #CohenHearings #CohenTestimony #Cohen

@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Btw, it just occured to me (way too late) that you've offered ZERO facts throughout this discussion. Every time I present a fact you come back with an uniformed opinion that's clearly a symptom of your biases. Good luck with that.
@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Trump has not magically solved any problems (what President has?) and he's increased the deficit due to tax cuts and increased spending (not a very Republican thing to do). And, yea, jobs in coal mines, dot-matrix printer and rotary phone factories are not coming back.

@cjscalia @AG_Conservative This is the administration that put a party planner in charge of the most important HUD region. The sky really is the limit for a pastry chef at a Trump property, even ones with cakes that ugly. (Okay, it's a stupid story that should have never been written).
@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump The problem is we spend too much on the military and the interest on our debt; there's no accountability for spending; and, we don't get enough money from corporate taxes (only 7% of Federal government revenue vs 49% for personal income taxes).
@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump If you cut all the discretionary spending that people tend to complain about it would barely impact the budget and it would have net negative result. States would try to make up the difference so you'd still be paying. Poorer states would get destroyed.
@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Over 50% of the $600 million gets distributed to over 1,400 TV and radio stations, of which ~45% are rural stations that employ ~6,000 people. PBS children's programming has proven to be an effective educational tool. Arts funding is a net positive in the near- and long-term.
@FCDFtweets The vast majority of that money is Medicaid reimbursements for services performed; the other money is grants. So let's open up "know everything the organization does" to any entity receiving Medicaid reimbursements or grants.
@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump If you take all the "arts" funding, including CPB and NEA, that's ~$600M per year, with 75%+ for CPB. Even if you want to argue this is "wasted" money, it's not the problem.
@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Planned Parenthood doesn't get funded; they get less than $100M annually in grants. The other money they get from the Federal Government is in the form of Medicaid reimbursements for services performed (FYI, they're legally not allowed to use this money for abortion services).
@bswagspeare @AG_Conservative @notwokieleaks More abortions would solve this problem.
@NyackTrader @GoodThings2Life @seriousfun8309 @brianefallon They're the "compulsory government programs" that @GoodThings2Life wants to reject in favor of taking care of things himself.

@Bbrunn1 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I was and it's shocking that a "Republican" President would follow two Presidents who outrageously expanded the national debt by piling on more debt. But the deficit hawks are gone, buried by their mouth-breathing GOP brethren.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump That leaves only 17.5 million metric tons of soy beans that will rot because of tarriffs. But don't worry, $7.7 billion of our capitalist tax dollars are going to subsidize farmers who own government is forcing into bankruptcy.

@QTRResearch CEO pay ratio is a meaningless metric created by politicians. The fact that the media even mentions it is ridiculous. So many other things in compensation data that are more interesting and important but can't be boiled down to headline that gets clicks.

@DineshDSouza Your concept of atheism is removed from reality. Most atheists would argue that we're not "doing great" and the main reason is because the vast majority of people have and do believe in a concept constructed by those wishing to attain and exert power.
Memo to Trump supporters: The word "coup" is pronounced "ku". A "koop" (spelled "coop") is what Trump will fly when he's indicted. #Coup #DeepStateCoup #MAGA
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump For those Laura and Trump fans, the word is pronounced "ku". The word pronounced "koop" is something Trump will fly when he's indicted.
@chuckwoolery If any of Chuck's friendly followers are wondering, the word is pronounced "ku".

@QTRResearch Visit Seattle but don't talk to any white professionals and see what you find out.
@JoyceCarolOates @senatemajldr's missing chin will be the next national emergency.
@SethAbramson Because the GOP couldn't find a man to do the job.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yea, remember when Obama took our guns away! The GOP said he would and he did. We no longer have guns because Obama destroyed the 2nd Amendment.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump I think the real danger is that someone enters the country illegally, gets hit on the head by some falling bricks and falls into coma, then wakes speaking in tongues and takes your "job".
@GOP Show that special woman in your life how much you love her by regulating her body and paying her less.
@Heritage @KayColesJames You have something brown on your nose.

@QTRResearch Pretty sure he's going to pivot and suggest triple-leveraged ETFs.
@BillOReilly I love reading about the fantasy world you live in where you're a good person and a bastion of journalistic integrity. Can't wait for the movie.
@prchovanec @overlordjonny @HeathMayo @senatorshoshana @RadioFreeTom @TheRickWilson The turn to anti-intellectualism the right has taken in recent years is disturbing. CPAC's roster of loons shows the turn is complete and that a new direction is being taken. It's why we have Trump; it's what McConnell banks on.
@HeathMayo It's all people who have accomplished nothing. They're just talking heads with no policy expertise or proven ability to execute on anything other than making themselves "famous".
@amber_athey That's classy stuff.
@SenAlexander Agreed, but to turn the tide of the opioid crisis you need to go after the opioid makers, doctors and pharmacies who flooded America with misery.
@ChuckLane1 @realDonaldTrump Most people haven't done their taxes yet.
@jmartNYT @politico You mean "back into the swamp".
@JohnJHarwood It was the Popsicle Cartel.
@RealJamesWoods Agreed, which is why we need more information on Trump's health as well. That letter was non-specific and totally bizarre (who can predict someone's health?). These should be issues we all agree on.
@yashar Imagine a meal prepared by Theresa May and @PeteHegseth. You could serve that at the border and there would be no need for a wall; just bathroom after bathroom after bathroom.

@CocoaMonoi @Shotzzie96 @Austin__Shiver @MattWalshBlog I want it on the receipt but absent voluntary disclosure, which gas stations are not doing, it would take a law to force the disclosure.
@CocoaMonoi @Shotzzie96 @Austin__Shiver @MattWalshBlog Correct, there shouldn't be an any cost, so why don't they already do it? Would you support a Federal government regulation requiring all sales of gas to include a receipt that comes with a breakdown of taxes?
@CocoaMonoi @Shotzzie96 @Austin__Shiver @MattWalshBlog Consider that the next time conservatives scream weaken consumer protection laws and scream about over-regulation.
@CocoaMonoi @Shotzzie96 @Austin__Shiver @MattWalshBlog Would you be on board with a Federal government regulation requiring that gas stations provide a receipt showing the cost of fuel and a breakdown of taxes?

@Jackson19205096 @mrfelt1 @RealKyleMorris @benshapiro @uaYAF @yaf Hey Jackson, you can have forms of gun control that don't involve ripping guns from cold, dying hands. Where did I say, "Get rid of guns!"? I didn't. Don't put words in my mouth.
@MaxBoot According to Trump, a decade's worth of economic progress was accomplished in the past week.
@redsteeze It's "grab them by the pussy" next level bad.
@mrfelt1 @RealKyleMorris @benshapiro @uaYAF @yaf Doesn't answer my question. If someone truly cares about all children they would be for some form of gun control that doesn't currently exist, just like they'd probably be for distrcted driver laws.

@KellyannePolls So are the Lakers.
I spent a few months in Israel in the mid-90s. Things were much different then but some things haven't changed. At the time, the most enlightening conversations I had were with Arab Christians, and we didn't talk about religion.
@RichLowry If they'd only built the bus stop out of slats.
@GlennThrush I'll the Mad Scramble II with a side of bacon and crumbling infrastructure.
I've never met a non-Jew who supports Israel because it's a Jewish state. Non-Jewish support of Israel is rooted in politics and fiction and many of those supporters of Israel don't like Jews, especially American Jews. This is regardless of political party.
@NRO @JayCostTWS TLDR: No.
Proposed panel discussion: @IlhanMN and @SteveKingIA.		Let's also not forget that the GOP is quite often not Jew-friendly and has no problem peddling anti-Semetic tropes.		https://t.co/r2VjRaKa4t
Some good discussion and a good brain exercise for those screaming about socialism. https://t.co/y2yskncsA3
@tomgara The Saudi comment was about oil.
@tomgara A big-money conservative donor once told me his support of Israel was due to Islamophobia, "keeping the Saudis checked" and some religious mumbo jumbo.

@SonnyBunch Almost as interesting as Trump denying he said things that were captured on live television.
Perhaps there are intelligent solutions somewhere on the spectrum between the #GreenNewDeal and Trump &amp; the @GOP's sadistic dismantling of environmental protections. I will say that at least with the #GND our children won't end up being C.H.U.D.s
@wbc2027 Definitely not the kind of friend I need or want!

At the root of America's problems are people who have been groomed to trust those in power (politicians, clergy, law enforcement, administrators, bosses, etc.) to the point that they can't operate without a structure of obedience. Their trust is virtually unconditional.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I'm in top 2% of income, I live in a no income tax state, own a home, am married and have two minor children.

@SteveScalise Don't forget the part about rolling back corporate taxes and decreasing deductions to stick the working and middle class with higher tax bills.
@StacyFreedban My wife and I work our asses off and our income is entirely work-related compensation (e.g. not investments, etc.). I agree with your sentiment, which is why I posted what I did, but high income doesn't mean we're not working or haven't worked hard to get to that income level.

@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren You proved my point; Dinesh's comparable of Cherokee to Americans was ridiculous. Cherokee membership is defined by blood; American membership is defined the people and codified law. As such, we could define "American" to exclude Dinesh.
@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren "American blood" can be defined. For example, both of your parents were born in America, or three of four grandparents. It's all arbitrary; just make up a definition of "American blood" and use it to enforce citizenship and immigration.
@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren Dinesh said "doesn’t America as a nation [have the right to define who is a member and to exclude others]?" So it's okay for the country to do it, but not for me to offer up ideas on how to do it?
@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren I do agree with Dinesh. Using his Cherokee comparable he would not be an American. He's an Indian living legally in America but that doesn't make him an American. 		Transphobia only relates to transgender and transsexual people, not Canadians. I like trans people and Canadians.
@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren Yes, Americans can define who they are and I think we should use a method similarly to the Cherokee. 		I'm assuming you're joking about identifying as an American. You're either an American or your not. I like hockey and The Tragically Hip but that doesn't make me a Canadian.
@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren Right, so his comparison is not apt. I'm assuming you're Canadian so I'm not sure why you're involved with this conversation.
@DavidAFrench Revenge Of The Nerds
@Blazenhozen @DineshDSouza @SenWarren Cherokees define membership by blood, not place of birth, immigration status, etc. We could certainly come up with a definition of "American blood" and since Dinesh was born in India to parents from India he most certainly would not qualify.
@DineshDSouza @SenWarren Okay, so let's exclude anyone without American blood. We'll start with you. Or, we can continue to let people like you into the country. Your choice.
@benshapiro Same thing Trump says about intelligence reports.
@lumiauraah You're assuming boards are always acting in the best interest of shareholders. Many boards believe without evidence that buybacks are in best interest of shareholders, and management likes this because it helps their cause of enriching themselves.
@Robert_E_Kelly You're giving conservatives + GOP voters too much credit if you think that Trump &amp; Co.'s behavior is going to make them see some kind of light. Sure, a few will, but by and large the behavior of Trump and GOP aligns with their regressive thinking that protects their priviledge.
@realDonaldTrump Who are you harassing now?
@JRubinBlogger @stephgracela Dems will eventually tolerate this crap because of the precedent set by the GOP. At some point Dems will realize it's not worth eating their own when the GOP won't do it. That's going to be one of the many awful legacies of Trump and the current GOP.
@lumiauraah Management controls buybacks with board approval. Management incentive compensation can be directly impacted by buybacks if EPS and TSR/rTSR, among other items, are incentive drivers.
@marinabudzisz Maybe she has bone spurs in her heels, which I'm told keep people from serving their country.
@lloydblankfein Buybacks are management's excuse for not being able execute. $GS has spent more than $74 billion on buybacks in the past 15 years. That's $74 billion in cash that went to enriching management.
@lholow @DineshDSouza @yaf If the Federal Government bought ~2.6 million Flip Tree's we could have a sustainabale and mobile border wall.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your father consistently attacks women merely for being women. I know it's fun to live in your factless fantasy world but once in awhile it may be helpful to remove your head from your donald.
@GOP @SteveScalise Typical GOP attitude. Talk a big game, provide no specifics or path to execution, take credit for the work of others, end with self-congratulations. Dems have their own faults but GOP is just a bunch of grifters preying on generally well-meaning people.
@Peggynoonannyc Next time just say "She should smile more".

@yashar It was Virginia in 1984. Not sure what the mystery is.
