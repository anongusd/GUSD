@EnterDaDome @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda Police fire when a weapon is drawn at them regardless of the race of the person doing it. Is your claim that these police just intentionally drove to the park and killed the kid for fun?
@bumblebeethekid @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda And my understanding is it wasn't even tamir's fault. I think his friend is the one that removed it. I don't mean to sound unsympathetic. It's such a sad outcome. I just don't think it's fair to demonize the officers who were told there was someone pointing a gun at pedestrians
@bumblebeethekid @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda By keeping the orange safety cap on so it is clear to all parties it is not a real weapon. That's why they make them with those
@dropdead_foxxii @bumblebeethekid @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda Would you let someone draw a gun on you. The dispatcher failed to tell the officers the gun could be fake. They never heard that information
@dropdead_foxxii @bumblebeethekid @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda They called out the window to drop the weapon. He then reached for it (can be seen in video). Not lies. Very sad truth.
@dropdead_foxxii @bumblebeethekid @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda They did
@bumblebeethekid @Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda Totally agree. Having a gun pointed drawn on you makes it unfortunately difficult to avoid sometimes though
@Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda Delaying medical assistance was inexcusable.   I agree
@Joshua_Lynn81 @Mike_Eagle @yoda I'm not trying to defend stone. I don't think he needs or deserves defending but reigniting the rice case when witness reports and independent review of the video says he pulled something identical to a firearm is silly

@jeffersoniantoo @GrainSurgeon @ElonsPromises I'm of the opinion that it is unlikely but not as hard as everyone is making it out to be. The BMS from the S/X could probably be pretty easily interfaced with the 3, and I doubt Elon designs things with any less modularity than would allow this. u would have to redo housing tho

@theovdhd @Viridian_Hawk @Polixenes13 That's literally the point. Giving Tesla huge benefit of every doubt, and it still does nothing
@Viridian_Hawk @Polixenes13 So making insanely generous assumptions to $tsla they still don't contribute any significant amount to emissions goals
@Viridian_Hawk @Polixenes13 217M is the number of cars in China approximately
@Viridian_Hawk @Polixenes13 300k/217M *(0.16) = .0002 = .02%	Reduction in emissions where we're assuming Tesla's have no associated emissions whatsoever (ignoring all the coal that'll burn to charge them)
@Viridian_Hawk @Polixenes13 China has about 16% of its emissions come from transportation. If we make the insanely generous assumption that that's all cars, and then make the insanely generous assumption that Tesla can sell another car in China for every car it has ever sold 300k then we get:
@Viridian_Hawk @Polixenes13 It seems pretty unlikely that China would utilize $tsla to reach emissions goals. Sales would have to be huge to have any impact whatsoever

@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta I said I would change my view if 5 examples of something could be found. I then stated some facts which are objectively true (unless you have some evidence to the contrary) and responded with views about the president that are in no sense radical.
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta What did I say that was so stupid?
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta I'm pretty embarrassed to have someone who is an objectively bad person in an office that is supposed to carry a certain gravitas. I hate the  way Trump destroys that. Doesn't give Acosta an excuse to disgrace the press core and first amendment though
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta No. Thought that was terrible actually. Didn't vote for the guy. Was a Kasich fan throughout the primaries
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta Why do you think I'm a bot?
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta But I'm sure you and @NaplesAlleycat think this is a totally appropriate way to address the president?
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta Also notable that all news organizations reporting on that noted it was a "shocking breach of etiquette"
@SwampIsFULL @NaplesAlleycat @upslovemachine @TwitterMoments @Acosta Yes and this is the _only_ example I found. There were a few other times non reporters heckled him. But this was the only time a reporter did it. Acosta personally has done this more times to Trump not to mention other reporters

@inhartsnkiss @jctechsan @DanDanielMwanik @krassenstein @Acosta Multiple times. Yes. The staffer's job is to pass the microphone around. She did not handle it perfectly for sure but Acosta was more unprofessional, ignoring the president and interrupting his colleague.
@inhartsnkiss @jctechsan @DanDanielMwanik @krassenstein @Acosta My assumption is everyone reading my comment directly under the video has seen the video. I'm not trying to lie to people about what the video shows. I'm just saying the way that woman is treated doe doing her job is totally unacceptable
@suznic106 @jctechsan @DanDanielMwanik @krassenstein @Acosta Most people commenting on this are defending a guy who stood up during another reporter's questioning because telling him it wasn't his turn is an "attack on the free press" and I'm the one pushing my propoganda?
@lilsun83 @Louis_Left_Shoe @BNONews @Acosta @PeterAlexander What?

@JohnyQi @SmartContracter Lol never said he isn't a million times more successful than I am or that I wouldn't love to have some of the traits he have. I'm surely "jealous" of some of what he's accomplished. Just saying he's gotten there more off deceiving people than being smart
@iamhubris @TeslaCharts @elonmusk It's not like being profitable was ever that big a deal to him..... Right?
@SmartContracter @JohnyQi Actually on a team working on one.  Ours i  very far from done, so we keep it very far from roads where it can kill people and shit
@JohnyQi @SmartContracter He built a niche car company that through getting people to let him throw away money he blew up into a huge best-selling car brand
@JohnyQi @SmartContracter He does have a certain set of people skills.  Having the following he has would be impossible without it.  All his successes stem from that though.  Not intelligence or a particularly unique ability to execute
@SmartContracter Same number as elon has.  Some good engineers working for him though
@SmartContracter Maybe top 1M
@SmartContracter In fact that's 100% certain
@SmartContracter He's not one of the smartest men of our time.  Probably misses the top 1000 alive rn
Look at the likes.  It's cool how you can see the moment where 6.7k $tsla fans realize the guy's gone nuts https://t.co/5g8NTd7FzV
@_Cap_22 @passthebeano Water and nuclear definitely the best clean solutions
@passthebeano Im short $tslaq but this idea never works. Karma's next model is removing them because solar panels are so uselessly inefficient. At the end of the day all EV can do for now is use gas burned in a plant instead of in the car
@InvResDynamics @TeslaCharts They have 45 days from when?

@MrR17941987 @Alpsoy66 FUD!!!!! The kid works for the Koch brothers.  He ran into the car not the other way around.
@crypto_gordon I'm short but it's hard to call these people stupid.  It's not like this was some clever trick they fell for. Just a straight lie
@zomgjon @barstoolsports @RedSox doesnt seem like a particularly compelling reason to lower the price?
Checkmate $TSLAQ.  Pack your bags and go home https://t.co/oQhoaI9vGN
@BossHoggHazzard They literally just don't care. The value of [feature/potential feature/piece of fraud] will always be [ $TSLA stock price] + $100
I keep asking myself why the $TSLA wouldn't be plummeting after FSD removal.  Did bulls not place as high a value on the automated taxi thing as it seemed? Did they never actually take it seriously? Wrong questions!! There is no price too high to buy at for them. Reason be damned

@tomi @Benshooter @Trumpery45 @AngelNDevil2 @fatropea @CathieDWood @skorusARK Agreed. Elon certainly doesn't have a strong grasp on where AI is at and most of his supporters seem to assume he's a leading expert.
@FelixMoser I hear $VW is adding this cool feature that $tslaq didn't think of where they actually deliver the car you order
@iliketeslas @leonard0534 @Tesla @FoxNews @elonmusk So what's the picture. Hot wheels?
@iliketeslas @leonard0534 @Tesla @FoxNews @elonmusk The guy's family almost died while they were out eating dinner. You wanna chill on pumping the stock on his personal Twitter?
$TSLA Bulls who were on about Elon for years saying this should send the stock back up to where it was before the whole debacle like losing Elon is no change
@SnopowAUS This is possibly the worst analysis I've ever heard
@sbalatan Yeah. Just wish some IBs still had the dignity to say no to obviously shady money
@sbalatan It's the fact they got on board at all.  $GS of 20 years ago would have laughed away the BS without some evidence of its legitimacy
What happened to $GS that they were willing to advise on the shit show that is $TSLA when they assuredly knew all the information we learned today.  Didn't $GS used to have some pride in itself?
@lumpytrader Because the media only talks about the successes
@lazygetter Ah. I want listening lol. Thanks for all your great work man
@lazygetter What is this video showing?
@TeslaCharts Is there some context I'm missing here.  Like what does this mean?
@CapitalLecter But if they liquidate (I see $225 and $230 suggested a lot) then musk runs off with some cash right? Which beats just sitting around for $tslaq
@CapitalLecter Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding how this works but I'd think he'd get margin called well before the full collateral was lost so if he just misses a margin call it's all systems go for $MS to dump the shares and return what $ they can to him.
@CapitalLecter In this hypothetical that sends it quickly to $tslaq levels theoretically. Whereas this slow burn gives the banks a chance to get him off the hook. (this is a wacky conspiracy for memes sake not investment advice :p )
$TSLA Bulls have conspiracies about how musk is tanking the stock to buy it cheaper before a run here's mine:		Musk knows $tslaq is coming		MNPI means he can't just sell		He wants to tank the stock b4 ch 11 so he can miss margin calls and get some collateral out b4 it goes to 0
@rosslazer No. If he tanks it, he gets margin called and has to sell
@SchadenCap Can we get another one of these woth these new yields? Also what's your source?
$TSLA hey come on everybody this is unreasonable. He didn't even swear!!
@ravenvanderrave Good morning
@ravenvanderrave Oh I'm ready
@ravenvanderrave yeah the plan is to sell then if i get ITM
@ravenvanderrave Saturday at 11:59pm is the official time I believe
@ravenvanderrave So are my 275s paying or no :P
@ravenvanderrave You were right.  He went easy on him
$tsla Lol is he talking about "pedo guy"
@littletinysmal1 I mean $420 been sitting for a while and BoD hasn't said a word
@Prof_John_Frink I feel so special
@littletinysmal1 I'm holding way more than i should be in puts and i still think nothing bad will come of this for Elon.  hope you prove me long
$tsla Oh boy here it comes!
$tsla is joe talking about short sellers?
@TeslaCharts @EmmetMeehan my puts are f'd but i'll gladly call it admission to this ride
$tsla very clearly not an answer about sales
$tsla This is dull as heck but if pedo comes up and he's like this gonna be pay day for shorts

@littletinysmal1 @TheAdaptedMind This is the only reason I paid for puts
@ravenvanderrave @bjohn352 I bought some puts and will be tuned in :)
@ravenvanderrave @bjohn352 That said he's gotta at least have seen musks Twitter and have this pedo thing and the crying thing. No?
@ravenvanderrave @bjohn352 Lol this is so fkn stupid. I thought Peterson wasn't a complete loon
@ravenvanderrave @bjohn352 I don't watch too much of him so forgive me if I'm off base on this. Just from YouTube clips I've seen he doesn't seem to mind being confrontational (e.g. Crowder) but I'm sure there's a selection bias I failed to account for
@ravenvanderrave @bjohn352 Depends on his mood. even if he doesn't ask tough questions he'll go after bs if he sniffs it
@ravenvanderrave @bjohn352 But he knows go private was bs
@bjohn352 @ravenvanderrave Do u ever listen to rogan's show?  Genuinely curious not trying to be a dick. I have a little bit not much and my impression is he definitely is aware of front page news
@bjohn352 @ravenvanderrave He miiiiight not push to hard on it but there's no way Rogan doesn't know what's going on

@temp_worker @WintonCapPtnrs @FZucchi I believe there was an 8k last time he did it, so the lack of one suggests he didn't. That said $tsla might just not do 8ks anymore
@Adamalbaugh3 I'm really sorry you have to put up with this crap.  I hope it gets sorted out for you
@awesom_o Exactly. Could that be the cause of the high insurance?
If $TSLA goes $TSLAQ do insurers still have obligation to pay for damage to car?
@Adamalbaugh3 lot of people will try to call BS on this can u just hit view details and show us it's a legit tsla email ur getting it from?
@TedRosen @QTRResearch He is.  He said "he knew what he was getting" with the car or something like that when someone pointed out that the list of problems was pretty damn long for a car of that price

@trading_mz Source?
@StuartMeissner @Varneyco When?
@DatHandsomeJerk @ellec_uk This literally shows a giant liability for $tsla
@TwainsMustache @temp_worker Chart clearly indicates that there was a 7 sigma event where 16 suppliers started doing poor work all at once. Obviously $tsla wouldn't just take their money and make some bullshit claim about the work being poor quality. It's not like they're COMPLETELY FKING OUT OF MONEY
So... $tsla is worth more than it was before that earnings report?
@PlugInFUD @Tesla @elonmusk Apparently not lol
@markbspiegel They finally corrected this
@mydoghasagun @elonmusk HOARY smartish MARMOT v. Musk		Dismissed because this is clearly a forward looking statement that you've highlighted
@Bar2lucci @elonmusk The resilience of the $tsla share price and the cowardice of the BoD which are the only two reasons he made it this far (besides the fact the markets bought that inane bond offering) are going to make it very hard for him to get pushed away from this mess
$tsla rebounding as bulls remember that they don't care if the CEO is tweeting on Ambien at 10am
RT @davidenrich: We stand by our description. Musk’s emotion was audible. It is not true that his voice only cracked once. https://t.co/RZO…
@mydoghasagun @elonmusk @yoda @RMac18 @TijenOnaran Yes. $TSLA is producing 8k model 3's a week currently. (This statement about current production is a forward looking statement for some fucking reason so even though it's bullshit you can't sue me for it) https://t.co/tv45ZHtE1v
@passthebeano Or the third one holy shit
@passthebeano Don't forget the second one
@mmomboisse @TezzlaCFO Lol a $tsla 8k
@Alpsoy66 @omniamea gave a much better response than I did to this question https://t.co/17J44VgG2z
@omniamea @RichardKeppler1 @mydoghasagun This is a GREAT observation
Could there be a legitimate FTC consumer protection case against $tsla with the failure to deliver products and honor warranty. If Ch 11 coming i'd think Tesla owners better do something quick if they don't want to be left hanging
@Numenor33 @TeeKay_EV @skabooshka @ElectrekCo This is also very possible
@Doug24Seven @LoupVentures @digirah Unfortunately this isn't just a minor mistake. It's the entire crux of the $TSLA buisness. Musk's hubris let him believe he could do everything better without advice but instead all he's done is throw away first mover advantage by reinventing the wheel but making it an oval
@CGasparino @DowdEdward @Tesla @elonmusk @CGasparino I know you're doing well cuz both sides are taking turns hating on you. Thanks for adding some transparency to this shit show though.  That said $tslaq
@JustGamblingFTW Lol same. My near term puts got shattered today
@JustGamblingFTW 10 years from now the creditors will own the company and 9 year old $TSLAQ will be getting exchanged at $321.04 by Elon fanboys
@S_Padival @JaycarAU This statement is so insane.  You do realize STM is a $20B electronics manufacturer right? Not a RadioShack spinoff?
@WehbyJammin @Amyas_ @BonaireVolt @Lebeaucarnews Oh $TSLA's data is so good. SO GOOD. Other car makers are years Decades CENTURIES behind. We just gotta get the data out of this fking 700TB file give us a couple months
@BullTesla @orthereaboot When was the last time a $TSLA short lied?
@DavidRo19158533 Lol if Tesla's safe irrespective of of there were material lies why bother noting that he said "considering"
@Teslemmings @xandriteme Same boat. They're priced so low it's worth keeping the lotto tickets
@Alpsoy66 Again just my thoughts. Not remotely close to investment advice
@Alpsoy66 On the off chance that they were sitting on a real path out of their current liability mess it may have been worth an investment (not at $420). That's my guess. $TSLA gladly took the "funding secured" alibi but said nfw to looking at their finances (VW would leak if bad imo)
@MrShortSqueeze That's what I'm counting on
@dueckman123 @QTRResearch Lol my bad
@DavidRo19158533 "funding secured" and "only contingent on shareholder vote" are though
@dueckman123 @QTRResearch Lol @QTRResearch is anything but that
@Alpsoy66 They don't. They just wanted to nose around the books but $tsla refused to allow it because of what they would have found. Obviously just a theory.
@temp_worker Much respect for the correction
@MrShortSqueeze I know. I bought them when they were triple that. Rip lol
@xandriteme Ofc lmao. Some of em at least. Serves me right for being impatient
$tsla could go Ch 11 tomorrow and the stock would still trade between 310 and 320
@TeeKay_EV @skabooshka @ElectrekCo The market is so irrational rn. Everyone who missed apple/Facebook/Amazon clinging to $tsla in false hopes they haven't finally discovered a big run.

@MLMentor This article claims to ignore all the most important points but really activrly dismisses them despite strongly evidence only to give poor analysis of one relatively uncommon short argument. It's a terrible piece
@AlterViggo @dennistalley @TeslaAgnostic The point of the shorts (of which I am one) is that $tsla produced the RWDs to meet production targets but there's no demand for them so they just burnt a ton of money. Not that there is no demand for AWD
@EthicsGradient @tradervic21 @28delayslater @QBCentral When the demand exists. Unlike $tsla who will roll 5000 RWDs out with no demand to hit a production number and save the stock price

@ContrarianShort Yeah he admitted funding was not secured, and he's pretty much just praying for the Saudis to take a couple more shares.
$TSLA So are bulls going to be ok with no news AH today?
@crypto_gordon @SEC_Enforcement Some board member probably made him put this in by hanging the threat of resignation over his head
$TSLA How log until @GerberKawasaki gets involved in a class action against $tsla?
And ofc the software is totally lost but the electronics you might have a chance at it but who is going to repair it. The electrical engineers at $TSLA who currently make 6 figures to understand this crazy contraption? Good luck finding them at your local AutoZone
And most car problems you can just go find a garage but they're not going to be able to fix the electrical and software issues that are sure to arise as would in any machine of this level of complexity with such minimal QA when you have to go looking for third parties
Do $TSLA depositers really want to own the most complicated car software wise to ever be produced without an entity behind it that can provide bug fixes? Especially when QA at $TSLA has gotten so bad.  They better hope this company gets saved by some miracle
@TezzlaCFO @markbspiegel He just wants to keep getting his software updates

@ZorTrades Feels like that's Elon's goal at this point
@LIBORsquared Can and SHOULD.  The market should drive cheaters into the dirt if @SEC_Enforcement doesn't give
@invworks @Tesla Focus now on if the Saudis know what musk is talking about
Your first point is especially devistating as an American taxpayer. BILLIONS handed out to this company by federal and state governments and the ONLY HOPE presented for it to not go belly up is that 9/11 funding government makes a killing off of it. What a sad day for our country https://t.co/zNtnDK0Wt9
@KeyserSozeBro1 Do you mean $tsla or musk himself? Musk is already sitting on billions in shares bought on margin that will be extremely difficult or expensive to roll over if the company goes private
@stuartbrainerd @TeslaCharts Musk said on Q2 earnings call he had never considered implications of exporting such technology with potentially military uses so regardless I'm sure he hasn't thought about this very important question
@KeyserSozeBro1 Where in hell is musk getting 5bn in equity. He can't afford to bring his current stake private

@iliketeslas What direction did u think it would move?
@ShamsanM $tsla Repackaging old news as clickbait at premarket open? Nice dude. High five!
@Jackson_Staack $tsla Yeah. F the stupid wallstreet games like being transparent with the owners of the company you run and following the disclosure procedures you've agreed to.
$TSLA when will the longs who bought on the tweet to get into $TSLAP stop attacking the class action and join it?
$TSLA I don't know if there has ever been a time when a company so precisely and clearly showed they were at their peak stock price without making it fall
@gebbyart Where's my first fuel check??
@walt373 I had been waiting. Got some nice cheap puts
@JohnSno25197756 You're being smart I'm being greedy. All we'll see is if I'm also lucky
@mydoghasagun Isn't it great?
$tsla Musk tweets are continuing desperation to prop up the stock. Otherwise they're illegal. Either way I'll see you all at $0

Time for AH bears to shred $tsla
$tsla Can't believe I'm holding these puts into the weekend but how can i get out negative after this news?
$TSLA the fact this price is going up on the bad news is making me feel like bears are getting jobbed by an insider
$tsla finishing up today would be the greatest injustice to reason since the execution of Socrates
@Commuternyc Duuuude FAKE NEWS.  Elon said funding is secured and his IQ is like 70 billion. I for one am not selling off at $420 and will go private with him. I'm riding my share up to the obvious $1T market cap that $TSLA will hit after Q3 shows 4 million model 3's produced in 12 seconds!
Still absolutley no mention of $TSLA BoD on any of this.  Bloomberg headline says Tesla seeking but the article clarifies it's "Musk and advisors"
@JustGamblingFTW So the theory is the Saudis offered $420 a share. Musk was considering, and tweeted out that he was "considering" but that "funding was secured," but eventually decided to rejected.  I guess technically possible until he tweeted out we were just waiting on investor support
@NetflixAndLamp Surprisingly their decision is actually not that difficult.  @elonmusk will just tell them what to do.
$tsla Anyone else on twitter wondering where our bullish friends have run off to?
@SheepleAnalytic Don't worry funding's secured!
@RichardKeppler1 3 months?? I heard 3 different $200B+ valuations on TV yesterday!
@iamhubris @xenomorpher1 @TeslaCharts @beatlesonbankin @SEC_Enforcement $TSLA did not.  This is musk acting.  The headline is wrong.  Look at the article says it is MUSK seeking wide investor pool
@WintonCapPtnrs Now
CRITICAL DISTINCTION BEING MISSED:  @elonmusk AND NOT $TSLA is seeking a wide pool of investors.  He has gone 100% rogue at this point and the board is clearly going to be complicit.  This is an abomination.  Where is @SEC_Enforcement https://t.co/sizhDj7miE
$tsla "There's not a single idiot who will pay $420/share so we're seeking a wide pool of idiots who will pay $420/share" #FundingSecured
@passthebeano I was on the IR page before I read the second line
$tsla @SEC_Enforcement  HALT THIS MADNESS NOW
How the hell is $tsla still green.  This is the only news about it today and it's objectively negative
@JonCooper22 The problem isn't the BoD lol. It's that the type of entity who would be willing to buy out $TSLA at $420/sh's biggest asset is their first home.
@rramdin @Nasdaq @SEC_Enforcement $tsla If you're @elonmusk you gotta be worried that the first thing that shows up in a google search for your ticker can reasonably be captioned "This graph shows obvious market manipulation"
$tsla And the rest gives us #FundingSecured https://t.co/vnxflwtDLp

@4Awesometweet @AuspexResearch I think they're idiots too but they're shareholders so the board has a fiduciary duty to them.
@4Awesometweet @AuspexResearch What about shareholders who bought at $380 expecting a free $40 from a $420 sale? The SEC and board don't have any responsibility to them? If your tweet were true why wouldn't companies just lie about everything?
@markbspiegel @EconomicManBlog @TeslaCharts Elon has picked option 2 for his little minons
@janopetsa hello
@GerberKawasaki Yeah but it's able to raise capital and isn't in a complete solvency crisis
@EdgeCGroup Oh yeah and it also doesn't drive itself....  Wouldn't be surprised if Apple's self driving tech is already further along than $TSLA and they're just less willing to embarrass themselves and kill people with half finished products
@EdgeCGroup You mean "midsized premium sedan" which is a hell of a lot smaller of a category.  It could get ur claim to if it were $35k but...
@EdgeCGroup Since when is TSLA the self driving leader???
@golfnutrich @elonmusk That was totally legal though. This is just manipulation
@TSandisonn @StuartMeissner Literally no reason it would
@FlatMarsClub Deleting would be an admission of guilt. That's the only reason it's still up
@WehbyJammin Exceeeept... The shares jumped big time on the announcement, but with tons of selling. Saudis just dump their stake and run off with a killing. Come back in 2 weeks to save Elon when the stock is $4/share
@MaxJacobsEdison @biologypartners @bradloncar @Sanctuary_Bio @TomMathies I see.  Fair point.  Do you think it's possible the bard is just covering themselves or trying to hold the 360 mark for convertibles?
@passthebeano @QTRResearch i mean the algos didn't read the news.  it's just stupid bulls
@MaxJacobsEdison @biologypartners @bradloncar @Sanctuary_Bio @TomMathies I disagree somewhat. It definitely helps musk, but I'm going to guess they're all responsible for the blog post so theyre doing just enough to retroactively make the post true and cover their own asses. Asking for recusal indicates the goal isn't to throw musk a bone.
@Nasdaq reproting after hours high of 352.60 so i assume was just a bug or something
Googe Finance had $tsla up 2.33% after hours for a few seconds about 2 minutes ago.  Bug? Or something come out?
@DoucetteSaryn @timseymour Every time I see one of these "Breaking news: Elon Musk secures funding from..." jokes I nearly have a heart attack! lol $TSLA

@brodieferguson @elonmusk That's not how aaaany of this works
@Fults117 Puts will cost more than a "$35,000 car" by tomorrow lol
@twfadvisors $TSLA E is negative so higher P/E comes from lower P, in which case I'm 100% with you!
@louwhiteman lol! Still more serious than $420, funding secured
@louwhiteman lololol
@mikeo188 @zerohedge But SEC looking makes it much more likely $TSLA cooked the books. If so the investigation is to decide who goes to prison and the company is already screwed

@jahimes Pretty crazy considering how Clinton said we would have a recession already under Trump.
@AccurateTrading The hour delay before trading was suspended, the subsequent hour of silence before the poorly crafted email that was written after the tweet according to @FT was published, the lack of an 8k, the post from a subset of the board and the SEC investigation were all part of the plan?
@Long_GoldSilver source?
$TSLA Still can't get over that $420 was such an unreasonable price that Musk thought he could tweet it as a joke and the bulls didn't get the humor lol
@pnweez @Renegade_Trade @elonmusk Thanks &lt;3
@JTSEO9 I think you mean until the floor falls out
@vincent13031925 I don't have the facts.  It's just a guess, but you don't have the facts either
@vincent13031925 The difference is he said funding was secured which may be untrue. If so he actually lied, not just set some price Target or shared an opinion.
@Renegade_Trade @elonmusk If the sale goes through I'm happy to apologize but in case I forget, you can rest assured I'll be out a ton of money if that happens
@Renegade_Trade @elonmusk Until there's a buyer there's much more fraud than sale
@Renegade_Trade @elonmusk Duuuude fraud is so alpha. Hodl $tsla to $1000000

@bgrahamdisciple How were none of the lawyers and board members who worked with Musk to craft his thoughtful tweet aware of this???
Can't imagine how much productivity is being lost as $tsla tries to sort out this shit show. Even if the SEC doesn't get him the creditors will
@jefffocker And if it doesn't change the 3 to a 2
@modern_rock 6. Blatantly lying to investors in regulated markets
@GerberKawasaki @IBDinvestors @MarketSmith @SEC_Enforcement is a little more than "noise"
@StockGravity More likely there's nothing behind it at all
$tsla stock down, volume high, and all the bulls still talking about how shorts are going to be scrambling to find sellers
Are we all still pretending that $tsla funding secured isn't total fantasy?	Stock propped up by buyers who will put money in at any price as long as the arrow is going up. If they see big losses they go running, and the floor comes out.
@ExecutiveBuying Not true! We've known musk wanted this for years but these talks were 2017. He was just making sht up yesterday or we'd have an 8k by now
@seller_short @elonmusk Source??
@TomMathies @Sanctuary_Bio @bradloncar @MaxJacobsEdison @biologypartners So does this make it more or less legal that he completely lied on the platform??
@bullriders1 @elonmusk This is ridiculous. The pump dumps itself because of the convertibles
@Wolf_InTheWilds @elonmusk Some do or it would be at least 30 lower
@levelsio @elonmusk @Tesla If this "brilliant" move is truly what @elonmusk did, then he committed securities fraud by saying funding was secured and could easily catch a big fine and some jail time. That might add some difficulty to preventing a takeover.
@Katphiche Doesn't this add like $5B to the buyout cost??
@MacroWidodo The possibility of collapse is too real to not be buying such cheap puts.  Maybe there's a 75% i lose all my bets, but the other 25% is big money
@AntonOlff How much do convertible debt add to price of LBO??
@cebrian_mario @YodaSapiens_29 @TheBubbleBubble Is the $70B number getting thrown around inclusive of paying off convertible debt?
@Bobocr1 I was 100 with you during the halt. Can't believe the bulls let him get away without an 8k or even a gaurentee in an official filing. If it's  not out by end of day tomorrow we should see the shares break hard
@JustGamblingFTW It wasn't today so it won't be tomorrow. And if it's not by Q3 then it'll be a different company by Q4
@MacroWidodo $TSLA fanboys could easily put the thing up another $60 or $70 on top of the $420.  Those cheap calls you're selling aren't so safe
@Arpit_Rathi @elonmusk @Ferrari He didn't make a dime! He told people they would by their $5 bills for $10 and everyone is acting like he's rich because "now all Musk's $5 bills are worth $10"  He can't sell or he's going to prison, so it's not worth anything!

@politico I 100% agree it doesn't break open the Meuller investigation, but that doesn't mean there isn't an issue here.
@jahimes I agree 100% Congressman.  Seems great that we learned this from the memo, and gives reason for the investigation to continue.  I don't understand why everyone was so against the release?
@Slate As he should be.  Dems who claim to be feminists then don't believe that the most politically capable woman to ever enter politics is able to succeed without sleeping her way to the top should be ashamed of themselves.
@ZulaQi @debkerwin @grlnxtdoorisblk Surely I wouldn't say you can't criticize a woman's belief, but you didn't just criticize. You've just claimed that the literally millions of women who voted for trump were just following their husbands and couldn't be thinking for themselves. That's a disgusting view.
@thehill Memo reveals corruption is vindication. He can't shut down the investigation on these grounds but he damn well deserves to feel vindicated
@JasminRoman15 @Jullian_Goodin @KamalaHarris 40 favorites for a man telling a woman why she shouldn't feel empowered. 8 for her pointing out the factual inaccuracy he used. 		Gotta love modern feminists
