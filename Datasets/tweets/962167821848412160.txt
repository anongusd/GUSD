@jaketapper @amandacarpenter @K_JeanPierre @abbydphillip @TheLeadCNN This is absolutely preposterous. Democrats knew that it would be IMPOSSIBLE for Trump or his family NOT to profit off of the White House and of course, now we are seeing it in action. I wonder how Trump voters feel that Trump and his family are becoming billionaires on our backs.
As an Armenian American Democrats, Trump's using his presidency to profit was a major worry but watching it happening live is absolutely disgusting and disheartening, we have to push the GOP into the history books in November! #AADLC #ArmenianDemocrat @ANCA_DC @agbu https://t.co/6CMD4RogAZ
