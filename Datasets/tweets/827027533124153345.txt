@supermarkusa Definitely. I dont like to make waves... too much of a people pleaser. But I have an opinion so I post it here
@TheJeffBridges The dude abides!
@femalestuds @ava @joerogan @wkamaubell Didnt party ideology switch in the 1930's? It's an interesting video. Just trying to put it all together.
@MohanadElshieky Jesus help us
@MrsRobe21241883 @73SNAngel @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Your initial comment said that it bothers you that she had an affair. But you like Trump despite his affairs. So, is it bad if a woman does it but not if a man does it? At the very least you just contracted yourself...
@CourtneyHadwin Also, is Twitter the best way to stay current with what's going on with you? I'm excited about supporting you whatever way I can!
@CourtneyHadwin Hey Courtney! Im curious, are you putting an album together?
@johnegibson @AuschwitzMuseum @AOC Definitely how it starts!
@cnnbrk Seriously, Watch "Vaccines: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)" on YouTube https://t.co/BNmmmWRhaR
@AOC @jubileefilms Sorry you're going to miss it but thanks for letting us know about it!
@thehill What a f***ing pot stirrer. Shame on you!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump By the people who brought us fake news, here's some actual fake news!
@RepFinkenauer Thank you for representing the people! This country works by debating the tough issues not by letting one person do as they please. This was a victory for Democracy!
@SonOfGodAndMan @AOC Who would have guessed that Donnie had a long game!? lol!
@cnnbrk ‚ÄúI am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.... So, I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I‚Äôm not going to blame you for it. I will take the mantle of shutting down.‚Äù	                           ~ Donnie
@CNN This is the difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. In no way did she break the spirit of the law by providing help for that young man. I stand by her too!
@RealSophiaRobot Falling in love is quite ineffable and really different than cultivating a relationship with someone. It feels wonderful, like you're floating. You're happy for no reason, yet they become your reason. It infiltrates your thoughts and you wish it would never stop.
@mrsharma @AOC clearly
@Dazarbeygui @thehill hell yeah! that's what I'm sayin!
@thehill Yeah, it's like the Confederate flag. It might be your right to fly one but if you do everyone knows that you just hate people because they're different than you.
@washingtonpost Didnt he just confuse her for Donnie? How do you do that? Maybe he should use Clear Eyes, wow.
@shelleycanuckAB @washingtonpost Ummm, he's sick. ;)
@cnnbrk Border Patrol arrests 200 adults, 176 children who dug under border wall in Arizona - CBS News https://t.co/JDoMCAPnvU
@DoubleGman28 @cnnbrk The branch of the government that represents the people thinks what Donnie is doing isn't right. The crisis is not at the boarder but with the dictator in the Whitehouse.
@AOC Amen!
@MIGOP @JanMI19 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi It's just not the way it works. It's the rules. The president has to be invited. It's a different and more-or-less equal branch of government. It's part of the built-in checks and balances system.
@thehill Why is this guy standing in the way of Americans?
@AOC What if we all paid 10% across the board? No deductions, no loopholes, no BS. Everyone just pays 10% on everything they earn. Would that work? Honestly curious here! Why wouldn't a flat tax work?
@neeratanden I feel thankful and out of the loop at the same time! How refreshing! ;)
@nowthisnews @AOC Pffff, typical Fox News ü§£
@AOC PREACH!
@nypost Shame on you NYP!
@AOC Man I'm so sick of the news manipulating stories. They are more worried about ratings by manufacturing sensationalism then having integrity for the facts.  Hey journalists! You want the flabbergasted awe of the world? Give due diligence to representing what's actually happening!
@AOC @StephenAtHome Two of my favorite peeps!!! ‚ô°
@jzanglin @thedailybeast Jesus! Where did you find that?! Kinda where my mind went too though. Outrageous and scary at the same time!
@thedailybeast Well, upon examination of the video those other jerks were the real jerks for sure. And things definitely shifted when Nathan showed up. But 1st, ya'll should have walked away. And 2nd, while you shouldn't be getting death threats, maybe that'll wipe that smirk off your face.
@lisasharper Thank you! I watched the whole video right away and I believe you really nailed it. The Black Hebrews were being so offensive and horrible! You dont do what they were doing to win people to a cause but only to sew seeds of hate....
@LastWeekTonight üéµ Missin you, is easy cause you're beautiful. Do do do do doooo, ahhhhhüéµ	Hey John, remember when we used to just hang out and talk all night?
@squirrelbite @AOC ü§£
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Thank you!
@Alyssa_Milano Exactly! I've been telling my friends it's the new Confederate flag. It might be your right to fly one but pretty much everyone knows that you hate people just because they're different than you.
@rtraister You're so great! I'm glad you were on the show!
@poolboy88 I appreciate your desire to engage in reasoned discourse. Don't find a lot of that on the old Twitter.
@poolboy88 @washingtonpost The real issue is that this country isn't run by one person but by 3 branches of govt. Trump needs to open the govt and allow debate to happen there... but he won't until he gets what he wants. By the ppl for the ppl and the ppl he's not listening to are our representatives.
@washingtonpost So he's agreed to do something he should have been doing in exchange for something we don't need. Cool.
@CBSNews Our government works by debating issues to make the tough decisions. Trump and Mitch are keeping the government closed so that there's no debate and will not open it back up until they get their way. Boarder security is important but what they're doing is unamerican!
@WetMo708 @cnnbrk Well said! Apparently not!

@Communigirl @cwalker0506 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService **That moment when you realize you're better off praying for someone then engage any further**		I really hope they look it up though.
@cwalker0506 @Communigirl @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService The attack ad hominem is one of the most often used logical fallacies. It's when you attack a person instead of debating their ideas. You are in the wrong here.
@cwalker0506 @Communigirl @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Ah yes the attack ad hominem. Real classy. Look it up. What we said was in a report by the FBI. You accuse us of having mental illness but you blindly follow a racist dictator who wants to grab your crotch.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService You forgot to sprinkle his name throughout the document so he would pay attention. I found it informative but I doubt he got to the end.
@LastWeekTonight I guess I shouldn't be surprised at how much I miss you... but I am. I JUST WANT IT TO MAKE SENSE JOHN! Ahhhhhh! üòò
@PressSec Oh Sarah. I wonder if you were a nice person before you got roped into being press secretary. I hope I meet someone as loyal as you one day. Wow.
@CourtneyHadwin Courtney!!! I just got home and watched your performance on youtube! You did such an amazing job!!! Keep being you, we love you for it!!! ü§©
@rickygervais @13bladon @NetflixUK I love you! In a safe "fan" kind of way! üòò

This isn't about party affiliation or if the candidate he ran against in 2016 was worse, this is about Donald Trump. #boardersecurity		Watch "For Fact‚Äôs Sake: The Donald Trump Admin Has Border Crossings All Wrong | Velshi &amp; Ruhle | MSNBC" on YouTube https://t.co/p3lrqpHSVk
@thehill He's not worthy of the office so I mean what are you gonna do? Besides she wasn't even at her post when she said it, she was at a bar. Which is funny because the last time I went out to a bar someone yelled the same thing.
@WilliamShatner I think this is a big problem with our present culture and kind of dangerous. If you take the sincerity out of an apology then you take away a persons chance to grow as a human and you yourself will always be a victim.
@thehill If you watched the news conference you'd know that this didnt come up until someone asked him about it. The LAST thing I want to do is defend the guy but it just wasn't the tone of the meeting. PS - Stop giving him ideas!!! Geez!!!
@RealSophiaRobot Love you Sophia! I think you're the best!
@AOC @ewarren I am so thankful for your presence in this nation! ‚ô°
