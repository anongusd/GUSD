@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Challenge him to a round of golf for the nukes / lifting of sanctions. It’s one thing 45 may be good at. Between Kim’s hole in one and trumps cheating it’ll be an interesting match. Pay Per View OK so 45 can make some money in the process.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP They’re very successful criminals.
@roebuckjeffrey @SenFeinstein Science. Ice cores, ratio of O2 isotopes indicates the temp at the time ice was deposited as snow. Air bubbles contain CO2 levels that can be measured.

@Kokomothegreat @alexnazaryan So, there’s still time? https://t.co/v5ivzgFikF
@roebuckjeffrey @SenFeinstein How - simple. The rate at which change is occurring today as compared to all those previous patterns and events. All of those previous patterns and trends are the baseline that allows us to know this is different.Thanks for proving the point not that it will matter to u.
@jfreewright You just need to get a white guy to stand behind u silently while u explain that that silent white guy thinks you’re not a racist. Solved.

@johnstodder @s0yp0p @Bethypam @HoarseWisperer @DelanyDean You find something inaccurate or offensive, say so.  A bot just spews insults.
@s0yp0p @Bethypam @HoarseWisperer @DelanyDean Ted Kennedy primaried a sitting Dem president. This isn’t about who ‘deserves’ to hold office or who’s ‘turn’ it is. Stop this bullshit that u can’t criticize your own party-or just join the MAGA crowd if you want a cult.
@HoarseWisperer @DelanyDean Aren’t you the guy saying you won’t vote for the dem nominee unless it’s your chosen candidate?

@Guerrilla_495 @CNNPolitics @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Their feet should have been held closer to the fire. Conversion therapy and open hostility is a distinguishing factor too. These are old battles. Can’t we find someone in a country of 300M+ who got it right the first time?

@stucam7771 Is the American Dream to get rich?  I thought it was to live comfortably, own your own home and do better than the last generation. The lie that we’ll all be millionaires has skews policies in favor of the rich and treats everyone else like a loser asking for a handout.

@JimCarrey @tedcruz You mean, when Trump grabs to and you are a pussy.
@CandiceRoyer @bkjanik1 Edibles.
@EffenShop @Scaramucci If he were truthful in his observations he would simply say that lying is what’s working for 45.
@Scaramucci You mean like, social security, medicare, medicaid, preexisting conditions? Pay attention to those things you mean?
@BillDeFilippo You pretend the R party left you but all of the conventional Republicans in the primary said Trump was a lying crazy pathological POS yet you followed him which means you left the R. party not the other way around.
@PatsyResists @MitchKramer01 Problem is we probably won’t know the outcomes of many of the races for days, so, buy your limit!
@SoulStealer25 And? https://t.co/yAJUFi7KBl
@BillDeFilippo Sorry but I don’t believe any person who says they voted for trump and now they have changed their minds. It’s mind numbing to think you bought the bulkshit to begin with - it’s therefore impossible for me to think you have the capacity to reject it.
@tribelaw I found Trump’s copy of the Constitution. https://t.co/Zv5K4pMwlH
@marcorubio Bible Quote of the Day Toilet Paper roll must have run out.
@marcorubio It’s too early to talk about it.
@TrueFactsStated I disagree that the primary process determines who our best candidate will be.
@hughhewitt You can use deadly force to defend against unlawful deadly force. Trying to blow someone up is the unlawful use of deadly force. Are you saying, given the equivalency, deadly force can be used to stop someone from interrupting Mitch’s dinner?
@hughhewitt A robocaller just interrupted my dinner. I guess I should call the FBI?
@hughhewitt @JoeNBC @SenatorCollins Simultaneous attempted assassinations of two former presidents, a sitting senator, a house member, former intelligence officers and a number of other private persons EQUALS disturbing mitch’s dinner.? You’re a fucking moron.
@hughhewitt Are you suggesting someone should get life in prison for disturbing mitch’s dinner? Just curious given the equivalency.
@LesterHoltNBC @NBCNews Will 45 cover his legal fees?
@normangoldman Looks like he qualifies for a pardon.
@DaddyDaddymac Not sure there’s one answer but I ask you this: would we have so much hatred if our economy worked for everyone? Seems we get a lot of distractions thrown at all of us to keep our eyes off of how much we are all losing - Affordable education, safe water, healthy food, healthcare
@wfpalmer @jinngaa @realDonaldTrump It’s tan. Paint it white- problem solved.
@jadorkables They believe trump is a self made billionaire- what do you think?
@johncusack Yes, at least once
@chrislhayes Whatever, try to rewrite history. You guys gave him 2B in free promotion

@senatemajldr You’re wrong. We will not be satisfied with just bringing down his nomination. He must be removed from his current seat on the bench.
@DianeHarkey Is this a False Flag too?
@realDonaldTrump So trump fought for new nafta to get mexican auto workers a raise to 15$/hr meanwhile bernie gets 350K Americans a raise to 15$/ hour. Who are you “winning” for exactly?
@DaddyDaddymac I wish he headed the DNC.
@AmericanExpress Tuweap. One place you can’t use your amex card. Also, it’s not a peak but a plateau. But very nice pic.
@thehill Yeah!!!
@AppleShmapple @chrislhayes @JoeNBC Didn’t he say something about grains of sand draining in  kavanaugh‘ hourglass? Take the House. IMPEACH Kavanaugh- let the House do a real investigation.
@VanJones68 @CNN When you refuse to answer the question but instead question or attack the questioner, you’re fucking lying.
@smerconish yes

@AnnCoulter You must be thinking of Ann Coulter.  Or was she kicked in the head?
@HoarseWisperer What? Kegmeister Kavanaugh can’t recall a party?
@sebasti31023430 @mchooyah Nonsense. Currently the longest serving member of congress is a republican. I’m a dem and agree we need term limits- starting with judges. You can argue about SCOTUS but i can find no reason why a trial level judge needs a lifetime appointment. Complete bullshit.
@perlmutations I think they were exchanging pussy grabbing stories. Lots of ground to cover.
@twooatsodasgary @AmazonTraveler Either is appropriate but your right what’s on a title. Instead of Judge, let’s call him Kegmeister Kavanaugh.
@SidecarStrega @airINsd @SenatorCollins @keithboykin Great point that nobody will take seriously.

@KamalaHarris Impeach Kavanaugh
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump I’m a Dem and I do a lot more than pay any attention to Trump. I work hard, employ people and pay them a decent wage, I provide health insurance, I pay my taxes without bitching about it because it’s the best deal on Earth. Fuck u and your divisive bullshit.

@bellvedere @mchooyah I don’t like Trump because of his policies. I agree with you tho- i care one fuck not who he screws.

@PaulDEaton52 @realDonaldTrump I never served in the military. But I can’t help but wonder what those that did and do think about the fact that your president only likes people who don’t get captured and thinks torture works and is fair game.

@mitchellreports I hope this is the B4 picture.
@mchooyah @jontester @SteveDaines @realDonaldTrump If accusers are lying, why did he withdraw instead of fighting? An Admiral, yes but one who won’t even defend himself against outright lies?

@MalcolmHau @FoxBusiness Ah, always just around the corner but never quite here. So you are promising even more indicted republicans. I coulda told you that.
@MalcolmHau @FoxBusiness Where are you reading that the republican McCabe was indicted?  “so called guilty pleas”???  Were they accepted by a “so called judge” ?
@jfreewright King George III. For a country that revolted  against one, we sure love our dynasties.
@MalcolmHau @FoxBusiness All they have so far is a bunch of indictments and handful of guilty pleas.
@CNNPolitics Maybe we should do that before the midterms. Make it clear there will be new leadership when we take the house. A Pelosi Schumer redo is not going to get anybody excited.

@Spider_canyon @drvox Yep. But i’m right and you know it🤨
@Spider_canyon @drvox Trump isn’t for anything - he is against things.  His people agree with what he is against. He attacks special interests. The Dem party caters to them. If you don’t fit into a Dem sub-category, where do u fit in the Dem Party? He’ll snatch you up.

@kewlimp @TitusNation The question is who should pay. Supposedly I have an inalienable right to life- but now i have to buy a gun, hire security, pay to train teachers and harden schools. The shooting victims get insult on top of injury with medical bills and disabled bodies. Someone is going to pay.
@davidhogg111 There’s a bill sitting on the gov’s desk because of these people. It’s something where there was nothing. What have the typo-police done to address the problem of gun violence? Jack Shit. Keep it up DH!
@Jeremyt22485 @ALovelyToy @davitydave @chrislhayes It will take place. Now if anyone in the room  bothers to take notes, that’s another issue.
@themanfronUNCLE @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump you know how to cite? prove it.
@themanfronUNCLE @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Nonsense. You haven’t explained how it disallows a tax on a firearm. Give me a quote not your paraphrase.
@cleflore23 @Kwame09 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump To support programs to address gun violence. This has already been done in Wash State and upheld by the Wash Supreme Court.
@cleflore23 @IanOPadrick @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Sales
@BRJonesMKE @Cxameron @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Now you’re getting it
@themanfronUNCLE @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump You have to apply whatever the court says you have to apply and since that changes depending on who’ saying it,,,,
@imakewebs @ArmsJc @ItsStillDan @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump It is and yet it isn’t. It’s all about $ in politics.
@ArmsJc @imakewebs @ItsStillDan @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Seems like everything eventually gets back to $ in politics.
@themanfronUNCLE @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Just wrong. 24th Amendment specific to voting. Not a blanket statement - and 2nd amendment says ‘regulated’
@themanfronUNCLE @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Good thing it says ‘regulated’ not ‘unregulated’
@ArmsJc @imakewebs @ItsStillDan @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump For sure but auto and tobacco also used and uses heavy lobbying etc to continue bad policy that harms people.
@FourthCastle @cleflore23 @themanfronUNCLE @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Oh no, that’s an essential part!
@ArmsJc @imakewebs @ItsStillDan @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Agreed- great start. Problem is every good idea is shot down bc it doesn’t solve 100% of the issues.
@themanfronUNCLE @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump The ‘poll tax’ argument doesn’t apply to 2nd amendment. The 24th amendment is specific to Voting rights. Don’t conflate. Provide me a citation for your proposition that you cannot tax firearms sales to generate income to offset the societal costs of same, Counselor.
@Trent_Phill @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Yes we are. Ban lapsed. You want to argue about definition, argue to congress- it defined it. Albeit definition was stupid but if you’re going to have discourse let’s agree on the terms. If u don’t like it- tell me your personal definition so we can discuss.
@Tr0llYouHard @cleflore23 @ErinBur47178375 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Well, can’t wait to read your citation. Very interesting topic but I doubt you’ll find any  support of you proposition. And see how I did that without name calling?
@thebarkybark @FavThngs @sparkerhot12 @Cxameron @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Nope. It’s a privilege. But the second amendment doesn’t guarantee you a gun either. Haven’t seen the govt handing out guns with surplus cheese yet. You can tax them. And you can regulate them.
@FavThngs @sparkerhot12 @Cxameron @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Damn straight!
@cleflore23 @Tr0llYouHard @ErinBur47178375 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump The govt is paying out of pocket for first responders and uncovered medical. And not only are there the standard ‘sales taxes’. Read Watson vs City of Seattle, Wash Sup Ct #93723-1, upholding additional tax on guns an ammo to fund health research on gun violence.
@sparkerhot12 @Cxameron @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Except cars are not considered inherently dangerous. Yes they can be, but it is not their function. However we use fuel taxes to improve road and transportation safety - so more akin to a tax on ammo but that’s a good idea too!
@Tr0llYouHard @ErinBur47178375 @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Firearm sales are already taxed. You know this, yes? You claim these taxes are a Poll Tax. What authority do you cite to for that proposition?
@Tr0llYouHard @ErinBur47178375 @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Yeah- provide a citation.
@letsgetupsidedn @ErinBur47178375 @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump I guess you still haven’t read the thread.
@cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump So now it’s your turn to answer the question...
@cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Section 8, Clause 1. Next question.
@letsgetupsidedn @ErinBur47178375 @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Well you must be really old to be calling me jr. - how is a tax on firearms to offset costs of first responders and medical bills picked up by the govt. unconstitutional?  Maybe read first and type later?
@letsgetupsidedn @ErinBur47178375 @cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Still waiting. All talk - no game.
@RichFlair8 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Doubt that very much. But if so, he’s used them well.
@cleflore23 @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Got my copy of the Constitution handy. Waiting for your explanation Professor.
@mcAvoyxx @davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump We are already paying it thru medical and funeral expenses. Why shouldn’t the gun owners cover the ACTUAL costs of gun ownership?
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Rather, those proceeds should go to pay for medical and funeral expenses of mass shooting victims. We are all paying for a small group to have the privilege of owning an assault weapon. Shouldn’t that group pay for the consequences of having them in circulation?
@dawn_westlake @AdamHelpsPeople @SenSanders No he is not being investigated- they are investigating Russia’s meddling some of which had to do with splitting the democratic party and damaging hrc by casting her in a bad light and bernie and stein in a good light, in contrast to the investigation into trump and his circle.
@SenDeanHeller @CoxComm And what of the Cox executives bonus’?
@mchooyah @NRA Most people who start a sentence with “most people” have never actually conducted any research into their claims. Me included.
@NancyPelosi Support dems taking the house in 18’ by declaring NOW that you will not seek speakership!
@LDBurnett @Lawrence Photo lineup https://t.co/ebfuDsxtpx
@nahaltoosi “I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're finding."
@a35362 Biggest boost to dems in 18’ would be if Polosi declared right now that she will not seek speakership if dems take the house.
@HonestConservat @mchooyah Socialists you say? You mean they have social security and medicare?
@mchooyah What exactly is your understanding? Nazis loosened gun laws on most but forbade Jews to possess guns. Their loosening of restrictions on the rest of the population didn’t get them to overthrow the tyrannical govt. which is the justification often used here.
@SpeakerRyan Who needs regulations? https://t.co/auKekIVOls
@SpeakerRyan can u be more vague?
@MeetThePress @MSNBC @chucktodd Act II of performance art display.
@Jenfeds73 @JTMann05 @DonaldJTrumpJr Looked like bad performance art or rather an attempt by Stone and in fact Nunberg himself to discredit what he is bound to give up to Mueller. Falling on his sword for Stone to avoid plutonium enema from kremlin for both of them.
@chrislhayes @moorehn @thegarance Maybe he isn’t messaging Trump- he’s trying to avoid plutonium in his tea.
@chrislhayes @moorehn @thegarance Isn’t Trump suing this guy already?
@LindseyGrahamSC Prayers are for every occasion, really. You can’t go wrong giving a prayer.
@grumpy_tones @WRatHsChilD_ish @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump No-it’s the one he prefers when he’s getting urinated upon.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes these two things are entirely the same.
@BrannStalhjerte @VoiceOfOBrien @MikeDrucker You mean like when he said ‘maybe be the second amendment people’ can fix the supreme court?
@MikeDrucker Is this an audition tape for a position in the Trump admin?
@CNN So, ‘it isn’t brain surgery’ actually means ‘damn, this shit is difficult’ and does’t pay as well. Maybe next time have some respect for what civil servants have to deal with every day. Such unbelievable arrogance this crew has.
@counterchekist 45 was listed 45th
@m3h2 @garrypl @Methionylthisl @RealAlexJones Not abstract thinkers.  Hence the flag hugging.
@NBCNews How do they square their bs when Trump says he doesn’t  even need a gun?
@TheOnlyEdAsner WH spin prediction:	1- He was only joking, a little. 2- But Hillary tried it when she was president.
@RWPUSA He’s not there to run it. He’s there to run it into the ground.
@JohnWDean Can we have a parade after we win the trade war?
@DianaFincher @davidfrum No- it was during the Hillary Admin.
@normangoldman Golf, grifting and grabbin’ pussy.
@NBCPolitics @MSNBC @NBCNews Wow, they have pictures already?
@realDonaldTrump Impose tariffs on your family’s shitty chinese made clothing and jewelry!
@thehill He’s probably already forgotten he said it. At most he’ll say congress has to do it.
@danharmon @pattonoswalt When are where is this party going down exactly?
@imogensound @thehill He may have a conviction soon tho...
@perlmutations We need a tariff on cheap chinese made neckties.
@thehill Not Ivanka?
@realDonaldTrump Let’s support the American necktie industry with a huge beautiful tariff on ties made in china.

@Alhudson66 @ChoppingGuy @KennethWReid @danagould banned
@Alhudson66 @ChoppingGuy @KennethWReid @danagould Yes, but the restricted semi-autos were bought by the govt. and band so what has replaced them are not semi-auto. The number of guns isn’t causing its 25 year low murder rate but rather the type of weapon which has been eliminated.
@waltshaub @CAGOPUnknown Which makes everyone a hypocrite. Now that we’re past that....
@MSNBC Would anyone be upset?
@pattymo @pattonoswalt ‘Age limit’? I sure hope they mean ‘minimum age’. language is dead in this country.
@realDonaldTrump I don’t know. I think those kids in Florida are doing a good job.
@IngrahamAngle Good thing he had millions to defend himself with specialized white collar defense lawyers and experts. What kind of deal do u think he’d get if he’d got handed a Public Defender with 300 other clients?
@chrislhayes Imagine how someone without any money feels.
@mchooyah If they are “legally innocent” then you mean there’s an adjudication of not guilty?  Or are you asking if there is a remedy for someone who’s rights were taken without due process?
@talapu04 @mchooyah You’re right. Guns don’t kill people. People with guns kill people
@mchooyah Why is there a next? Why always the slippery slope argument?
@becky_diquattro @mkues65 @thehill Wrong. Convictions of misdemeanor battery constituting domestic violence bar you from possession of any firearm under federal law. Brady Bill. Been like that for decades.
@thehill It’s been federal law for decades.
@thehill I always thought Republicans were the party of Mr. Burns.
@killrpromise @mchooyah Not true. Have you ever read the Assault Weapons Ban? It was riddled with exceptions and loopholes. My M1 Carbine - exempt.
@mchooyah Who has said anything about ‘taking away’ guns?  Who is ‘they’?
@CNN Maybe the NRA loves shootings because they spur more gun sales. Maybe that’s why they want teachers to have to buy handguns.
@chrislhayes Yeah but you can sell more guns by arming both sides.
@CNN Since when is the NRA in the immigration fight? Waiting for them now to enter into the abortion debate.
@EricJR76 @Cjdicksonll @thehill Not even lever action?
@BarbraStreisand Let’s hope they pursue more respectable professions where they can effectively promote change.
@BBlackstone1 @HoughMagicDragn @RFreeba @ScottMartin1977 @vprnet @SenSanders Really? Nobody cares that he did in fact release his taxes during the primary? Bot much? https://t.co/q7gbNjykFF

@a35362 I guess he wasn’t a star.
@railfan4christ @DineshDSouza So having money to support themselves means they might have money to funnel thru channels to fav politicians in order to avoid financing laws and thus contribute more than legally allowed therefore providing them with a louder voice than everyone else? Is that how it’s done?
@DineshDSouza Embryos can’t support themselves but you think they have full rights of citizenship. Doesn’t every citizen have a right to advocate thier policy positions in America? Isn’t that what America is all about? So tell me, Sir, why do you hate America?
@railfan4christ @DineshDSouza Ok so the Founders were not activists? Do u have a problem with them too?
@Thom_Hartmann How can that be safe? Thought more guns = more safe.
@realDonaldTrump A celebrity. Apparently, they are entitled.

@TacticalCat13 @realDonaldTrump You’re going too far. Human being?
@wgay70 @thehill 100%. However, whatever their intentions, Obama and Comey tried to control the story, supposedly so as to not affect the election. But that had unforeseen unintended consequences. My point is, just do the job, don’t overthink it, don’t manipulate the timing - let the chips fall.
@HardballChris Rick Scott will be a featured speaker at NRA’s Leadership Forum, May 4th- Dallas. You remember Dallas, it was only a few hundred shootings ago,  15 police officers were shot. Hey students Forum is fir tomorrow’s leaders. https://t.co/JiZlayYG1v
@realDonaldTrump Why don’t you show him how it’s done.
@DaveKelley6 @OMGno2trump Or a lawyer...
@a35362 Here’s your vegetables https://t.co/q1ux2NzYm0
@thehill This ass-wipe is a featured speaker at NRA’s May 4th Leadership Forum. Defect much? https://t.co/JiZlayYG1v
@SenatorDurbin Don’t remind me.
@pattonoswalt Reflective. Like this? https://t.co/yWx5xDpwld
@thehill Well you’ve never gotten over a lot of things, like, male pattern baldness - but you find a way to cope.
@johncusack I wonder how many more guns get sold after a mass shooting. The death merchants and their lackeys have no incentive to stop the killing. Guns owned by the law abiding are millions to one against the shooters- yet the killing continues. clearly ‘more guns’ is not working.
@JerryLingle exactly
@thehill When an airliner goes down and people die we don’t wait to figure out the cause until after the funerals We try to stop it from happening again We definitely have a systemic problem involving guns and more people WILL die, we all know it, before they do anthing about it SHAME
@thehill He should release it when he is good and ready to and not before or later. We r in this mess because of law enforcement injecting itself in politics and trying to manipulate one way or another its impact.

@alanmns @SharonNye6 @TruthinGov2016 @realDonaldTrump @nypost Spoken just like the Tarleton twins in Gone With The wind
@TrumpUpdate @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I copped a client charged with running a meth lab out of his garage to improper storage of hazardous materials. It’s just good lawyering.
@TrumpUpdate @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Means nothing. That’s the nature and whole point of a plea deal. You’re not pleading straight up to what you’re charged with. Best example in Flynn. Shitload of stuff he avoided by plea.
@linnaeanstreet @JoanieVee1 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It’s not the Feds - it’s been the national policies that have been bankrupt.
@thehill Well if the President refuses to impose those sanctions, which he will, again, your threats are pointless.
@Scaramucci When we were young you’d buy your gun at the hardware/sporting goods store. Been to a gun store/show lately? It’s freak show of guys amped up on defending this or that from from some invisible boogie man. We have become a county of scared people and make believe fears.
@THEPhilPacker @VinAtticus @Scaramucci And what’s interesting is that you rarely seen them involved in crimes- because they are expensive, difficult to acquire and heavy penalties to procure unlawfully.
@bluesbuster11 @r_graus @Scaramucci @JohnJHarwood Absolutely untrue. Not all guns need to be registered.
@joanwalsh @FLOTUS Show some compsssion. #freeFLOTUS
@John_Monahan @RuthADouthitt @DebraMessing To bad we’re not talking about one car or one shooter or one death or one maiming. Your response avoids the problem- like thoughts and prayers and talk about curing mental illness in a country that doesn’t care to deal with healthcare in general, all the time avoiding the obvious
@realDonaldTrump You sick MF
@EricTrump  https://t.co/pq9QOXk5QU
@dbongino So, who coined the term ‘alternative facts’ again?
@RuthADouthitt @John_Monahan @DebraMessing That’s not addressing the problem. If your car leaked gasoline would you conclude that you simply need to buy more gas?
@Dana84884856 @ABC Ok but shootings happen in every type of workplace. Are we all supposed to carry guns? That’s the solution? We’re all packing all the time looking over our shoulders? That’s your idea of freedom?
@ABC Not gonna happen. This country has its head up its collective ass. If we cared about people we’d have healthcare and wouldn’t be pandering to some silly childish testosterone driven gun obsession we’ve exalted to a status higher than the actual citizenry.
@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/LpIKznXVwN
@johncusack Kush’s building address -666. Trump Stock market crashes 666 points. 2017 budget deficit, 666 Billion. I’m just sayin, play that combover flip tape again slowly. https://t.co/TNPPOXxwQd
@Thom_Hartmann Until these guns are removed from the marketplace, we need a recovery fund for victims of mass shootings financed by fees imposed on manufacturers and purchasers/owners of assault weapons.
@joanwalsh Along the same lines, terrorists could simply fund the NRA who will ensure our gun laws continue to allow tens of thousands of americans to be killed every year in our own country. Training and funding terror cells is completely ineffective comparatively.
@C__Wizzy @trumpsuckbigly @MickOrmerod1 @TomiLahren You’re talking about of your ass!
@davidaxelrod A fund needs to be created to cover the medical and rehab costs for survivors of mass shootings. It should be paid for by manufacturers and purchasers of assault weapons. If pols won’t do anything to prevent the shootings, we can at least prevent the financial ruin afterwards.
@FavuzzaDeb @jimmykimmel Great. Until a teacher shoots someone. Then we will have to arm all the students.
@davidjfinizio @CNN But we don’t have to make it easy.
@AllenWatson23 @GOP @NRA @realDonaldTrump Humans will not exist 1000 years from now.
@thehill Until we do anything to effectively prevent this shit, minimally, the survivors’ medical and rehab should be paid by the manufacturers and the owners of assault weapons.
@JohnWDean By ‘their boss’ you mean...? https://t.co/N4Myc5ytvg
@NBCNews It’s not just time- its literally TOO LATE!!!
@marcorubio We keep praying you’ll do something about it. Just as effective.
@diamond_pixels_ @cyberdyne @realDonaldTrump Not everyone with a mental health issue ends up shooting someone. We can take on individual problems without taking on every problem in society, getting overwhelmed and quitting. My freedom to live and be safe supersedes your desire to have an assault rifle.  End of story.
@cbar719 @realDonaldTrump So then let’s do nothing because whatever solutions we can come up with won’t be 100% effective whereas thoughts and prayers fix everything.
@realDonaldTrump Guess it’s too early to talk about gun control, AGAIN.
@johncusack Pardon HRC for - fill in the blank -? Would that do it?

@SpeakerRyan You know how helpful your prayers are? - these people WERE literally praying when attached. Start praying for gun control if u tk it works.
@SenDeanHeller Why don't you start praying for gun control.? I'll bet it's just as effective.
@SpeakerRyan Imagine if you fucked yourself sideways you lying sack of shit...
@SenDeanHeller @ATFHQ Legislation is needed. interpretation will only result in litigation. You're leaving it to the whim of whatever NRA shill occupies the WH.
@SenDeanHeller Rather than tax cuts for the wealthy why not back Bernie and Medicare for all so you can take healthcare off the employers, back!
@realDonaldTrump I proclaimed it a disaster in january.
@KellyannePolls The money is your message. Sick and sad.

@realDonaldTrump Poor Snowflake.
@KellyannePolls The way u all talk about HRC so much you'd think she won the election. Like you're obsessed over an old GF.
@KeithOlbermann Q for Jr.: Why did you keep scheduled meeting with Russians from your father if u were so excited about it?
@KellyannePolls I thought u didn't get to nominate people while in your last year in office? Isn't that a repub thing?
@realDonaldTrump Exactly, don't do anything they tell you to do.
@TrueFactsStated The order is from the District Court. If not complied with a mtn to compel would follow, not a visit from the SC. Explain
@CNN Rid us of these Red Square Republicans
