@kendraegle @feline_cannon @TaliOsteen @sarahjeong Thanks Kendra.		I have found that most Californians are more pleasant and less aggressive than I am, but I’m a Virginia transplant so I’m not like most Californians.		And I have enough friends in Denver to know not to post that, but I appreciate your advice. 😊
@Alyssa_Milano @SIippery_Slope Matt Gaetz really IS that big of a jack ass.		https://t.co/e9VVZ0ZqEh https://t.co/sEQJURJBju
@kendraegle @feline_cannon @TaliOsteen @sarahjeong I don’t see that as a problem all, and the reason is the 2017 GOP Tax “Cut”.		For many Californians, that #GOPTaxScam made California unaffordable for so many of us that we HAVE to move.		Texans are moving when they want to.		Californians are moving because we HAVE to.
@kendraegle @feline_cannon @TaliOsteen @sarahjeong I’ve been to all three.		Tipping purple states blue by sending California’s finest to settle there is a really good idea! 💙		I’ve been socializing that idea with friends.		More of us are moving to Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona, too.

@renato_mariotti So basically, we can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way.		President* Trump ALWAYS chooses the hard way.

@TaliOsteen @Eevildebs @sfleetucker @catmikk @sarahjeong I’m thinking of moving to Virginia, which is currently the purplest of states:		Their state legislature is literally split 50/50 with a slight red tip because a single district had a tie vote that was decided by drawing a name from a hat, which gave them the Speaker.		Really.
@ndimichino @jentaub Mesmerizing to watch Apple, Google, and Amazon brands eat the world.		Not so fast, Facebook: Your future in the G-MAFIA is no longer certain.		https://t.co/N6FRd5jXOk

@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin Can do! 💜
@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin We in that case is Angie and me.		Sometimes I type so fast that I forget the antecedents.
@SBFNC @BonSomerville Happily, Sharon. It helps to laugh. 🤗
@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin Will do! Looking forward to it, Jay.
@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin The most magical people bring out the magic in others. ✨
@JadedCreative @BonSomerville A little progress every day means the breakthrough eventually will come.
@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin Yes, we are connected on Facebook, but Facebook connections are not necessarily close friends. 😊
@SBFNC @BonSomerville Yes. And often it starts with fear.		Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.		That’s actually from Star Wars, but it rings true.
@SBFNC It does look good! I am cautiously optimistic. 💜
@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin Heck yes it’s okay! The whole point of Insta is to be followed.		I’m currently angry with Facebook for leaking my data so I’m on hiatus from Insta, too, but if they make things right then I’ll be back.		I didn’t suspend my accounts; I’m just not giving them free content for now.
@JadedCreative @AdamRifkin That’s understandable. You two look radiant together!
@BKapcoe @PNC16basses @IshaKIShanti Seriously, it’s a class action lawsuit waiting to happen. 😊

@lilyX68 @RonanFarrow Lessons are repeated until they are learned.
@SBFNC @BonSomerville Substituting hate for hurt is like taking out a loan.		Eventually the debt comes due.
@feline_cannon @kendraegle @TaliOsteen @sarahjeong Shucks, if that’s our criteria then California can send our best and brightest elders to take over not just Wyoming but also Idaho, Montana, both Dakotas, and perhaps even Nebraska.		We’ll also send more folks to Nevada and Arizona to solidify those states, too.
@JadedCreative No, @AdamRifkin knows Angie Everhart. He’s a wonderful friend.		I met her once long ago but I’ve never talked with her.
@Nmenon777 Sweet. Thank you for the clarification, Nina. 🌺
@JadedCreative @pandaslvsandy Can do.		Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing but wait.		Patience is rewarded.
@JadedCreative @pandaslvsandy Thank you!		My instinct is that it will work very well as a remake in the modern context.
@JadedCreative @BonSomerville This is wonderful. Have you ever considered writing a self-help book?

@BotSentinel @cbouzy @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety @TAPSTRIMEDIA @th3j35t3r @nadinevdVelde When I call out trollbots in tweets now I put their chosen name in quotes.

@PNC16basses Yes.		I don’t know what the solution is, but no half measures will send the message to Facebook that what they did repeatedly is unacceptable.
@PNC16basses Past warnings have demonstrated that neither Mark Zuckerberg nor Facebook Inc takes small fines seriously, so I agree that the only thing that will get through to them is one or more big actions.
@chargrille @brooklynmarie I appreciate your thoughts, Erin.		I don’t believe there’s any precedent for nationalizing a $400 billion company.		The only thing close has been the trust busting breakups of monopolists like Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982.

@StankSuzette He kicked Heather to the curb like she was Tiffany Trump.

@CreechJeff @JoyceWhiteVance The fundamental unfairness the GOP inflicted on the tax code in 2017 is going to destroy them.		American taxpayers in 2019 are FURIOUS that we’re paying more taxes than corporations do.		https://t.co/fmBJjfOtqk
@riaaustin1 @VandersteltTina @MollyJongFast We never step in the same river twice.		There’s literally no knowing what to expect, except that whatever happens, Trump will try to go golfing as much as humanly possible.

@favorscurry @renato_mariotti We welcome the post-Manafort, post-Stone, post-Atwater era of America.		Without their dirty tricks the Republicans will have to win elections by having ideas Americans actually want. Good luck with that.
@Sttephaniee @renato_mariotti Yes.

@KarenAttiah @BKapcoe Fascinating synchronicity that Jeff Bezos specifically mentioned the Saudi Arabia royals in his Medium post:		https://t.co/jQHRgvXH4h https://t.co/CyVWJQb97Y
@no1earthling Yes.		The Trump administration is STILL separating families at the border, to this day, as testified under oath February 7 to the Energy and Commerce Oversight subcommittee:		https://t.co/cITPJGLlPP
@Citizenroxanne Yes.		It now appears that Trump’s Justice Department, DHS, and HHS are all blaming each other for the Trump family separation policy.		https://t.co/HFY7tJ8FsG
@DebraMessing @RepJayapal Blame shifters gonna shift blame.		https://t.co/HFY7tJ8FsG
@DebraMessing @RepJayapal On Feb 7, HHS officials testified that they learned of the Trump family separation policy when Jeff Sessions announced it on TV.		Today we saw the Trump admin once again deny under oath that they created a family separation policy:		https://t.co/dmEpA0O9qE https://t.co/nvcE2Zr6vn
Yesterday we learned that DHS forcibly separated children from their families LONG BEFORE Trump’s official zero tolerance policy and they are STILL separating families:		https://t.co/cITPJGLlPP		Today the Trump admin once again denied separating families:		https://t.co/nvcE2Zr6vn
@leepen_lee @atrupar @RepJayapal When it comes to the Trump family separation policy, is Whitaker ignorant, lying, or both?		#FamiliesBelongTogether

@alanmimms @Rschooley @MollyJongFast When does grifting become grafting?		Or is that just a question of scale?
@ManInTheHoody @ElieNYC @MollyJongFast Answering my own question:		Candace Owens sounds like she has no problem with the Trump administration forcibly separating families and putting children in cages, as long as such actions are done within America.		https://t.co/JnStVoUNoj
@ManInTheHoody @ElieNYC @MollyJongFast You’re in shock that we’re in The Bad Place or you’re in shock that Candace Owens has no problem with the genocidal thinking that accompanies nationalist beliefs?

@kimmasters @DebraMessing Can’t stop thinking about it because the thought that there’s a sixth Trump child out there is unsettling?		Or can’t stop thinking about it because all of AMI’s unethical behavior might actually finally destroy the company?
@JohnFugelsang @DebraMessing Charlie Kirk is so distracted by his past prejudices that he misses the fact that the SDNY has Trump in significant legal jeopardy, is not constrained by Rosenstein’s memo, and does not have the limited scope of Mueller.

@voxkev Ha! We will always have the memories. 😊
@chellelaine @lauferlaw @jackshafer @JeffBezos Most Trump activities are grifts or grafts.		In this case, as Mr Bezos describes in his post, Trump did Pecker a favor in sharing his Saudi royal family connections:		“Mr. Pecker was pursuing business [in Saudi Arabia] while also hunting for financing for acquisitions…”

@barbstudebaker @MollyJongFast Despite my past differences with Jeff Bezos, I agree.		I also thought this quote was courageous because he’s committed to fighting the trolls, bros, bots, brotrolls, brobots, trollbots, and Putin:		https://t.co/FCaEwDvb84
@lauferlaw @jackshafer @JeffBezos Asking for clarification:		David Pecker’s immunity deal with the Feds does not grant him unlimited immunity to commit new crimes such as attempted blackmail and extortion, right?
@MollyJongFast Jeff Bezos says it best:		“Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?"
@MollyJongFast We hoped when Pecker got immunity from the Feds that he’d STFU.		Instead his immunity seems to have emboldened him.		I hope Pecker’s immunity regarding Trump does not give him blanket immunity to extort whoever he wants. Extortion is still illegal, right?		https://t.co/wDJvaQy0eH
