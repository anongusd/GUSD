@seanhannity Newt went around and tried to convince Republicans to vote for Freddie Mac's favorite bills (and against regulations on them). Newt denies he was lobbying his work didn't meet some technical definitions of lobbying and claimed, ridiculously that they paid him to be a "historian."
@seanhannity There are few things that Newt has done more hypocritical than corporate lobbying work for the mortgage giant Freddie Mac. You see, Newt has publicly attacked Freddie Mac for years, blaming it for the 2008 housing crash. they paid him $1.6 million
@seanhannity "Fannie Mae is an excellent example of a former government institution fulfilling its mandate while functioning in the market economy.‚Äù -- Newt, 1995
@seanhannity "[I was] very lonely, very driven, and pretty weird as a kid." -- Newt		"It doesn't matter what I do. People need to hear what I have to say. There's no one else who can say what I can say. It doesn't matter what I live." - Newt, dumped  second wife for a younger, healthier woman
@seanhannity "Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them", [I] "found frightening pieces that related to my own life." - Newt.	"I think you can write a psychological profile of me that says I found a way to immerse my insecurities in a cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to
@seanhannity NEWT: Attacking Congress for gridlock, when he personally led the destruction of Congress' civility and traditions in the 1980s as a "bomb-thrower" and evil genius tactician. (Seriously, look it up.)
@seanhannity NEWT: Repeated adultery with younger women, while each successive wife was seriously ill. Attacking mortgage lender Freddie Mac, while secretly getting paid $1.6 million as a lobbyist for them.
