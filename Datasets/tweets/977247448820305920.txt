Rather than seek opportunities to bring this country together, Donald Trump and Republicans have chosen to further inflame and divide our nation by moving forward with the nomination and confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh. This is a dark day in American history. My full statement: https://t.co/7iAp6rEgjT
This disturbing act is a direct result of Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric &amp; constant attacks on our media. Any attack or threat made to a free press is an attack on our democracy.

A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court has grave and long-lasting implications – yet Republicans have fast-tracked this process and failed to provide appropriate vetting of the serious allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh.

I'm proud to have the support of @StopBigMoney and look forward to working together to overturn the abysmal #CitizensUnited ruling, combat the toxic influence of anonymous corporate money, and strengthen the integrity of our political system. #NY25 https://t.co/Gr6JT1LG1N
The best part about public service is the ability to help people during their time of need.

Thanks to @narfeny for hosting me at their annual picnic lunch today! Our entire nation is a better place thanks to your dedicated public service. https://t.co/negEhgNf1y
The Trump administration just doesn’t get it: healthcare is a fundamental human right. While they pedal empty policies designed to mislead Americans, I'll fight tirelessly in Congress for comprehensive solutions that guarantee coverage for all people. https://t.co/C1rFElF3IV

Trump's repeated attempts to undermine and interfere with the Mueller investigation are not only dangerous, they show a blatant disregard for democracy and the rule of law. The investigation must be allowed to continue unimpeded. https://t.co/0G77vtBlGS
Now more than ever, we need leaders in Congress who will fight for #WomensRights and protect access to reproductive health services. #NY25
Donald Trump continues his unrelenting attacks on the rights of women with yet another proposal aimed squarely at cutting off access to critical family planning services. https://t.co/WNrKzSxnbe
We deserve better. In Congress, I will fight for what really matters to New Yorkers - expanding access to healthcare, protecting a woman's right to choose, creating more good-paying jobs, and enacting common-sense gun safety laws. #NY25 #FlipTheHouse
Donald Trump’s priorities couldn’t be more clear:	✅ Tax breaks for for the wealthiest one percent 	✅ Gut access to healthcare for millions of Americans 	✅ Rollback the rights of women	✅ Continue to advance inhumane  immigration policies https://t.co/ZcR8t9bjTp
For too long, Congress has turned a blind eye to the scourge of gun violence plaguing our nation &amp; terrorizing our streets. I'm proud to have the support of @GiffordsCourage and am committed to working alongside them to finally enact common-sense gun control laws. #VoteCourage https://t.co/2mVRrl3el7
My family and I had a wonderful time with Mayor Fred Ricci at the East Rochester Fireman’s Carnival this evening! My grandkids, Jonas and Arabella, agree that the cotton candy is some of the best in #NY25. https://t.co/xRlAXxWpAt
Had a great time marching in the Puerto Rican Parade today celebrating the incredible contributions of Puerto Ricans and the entire Latino community here in #NY25 and across the country! https://t.co/cKsVUHspbf
For the 2nd time the #TrumpAdministration will fail to meet the deadline to reunite separated immigrant parents &amp; children. 900+ parents won't be reunited with their children by the end of today’s deadline. It's simply unacceptable. #FamiliesBelongTogther https://t.co/TOROSG2uUJ

Trump’s #SCOTUS nominee is a direct attack on the basic freedoms and rights of women everywhere and poses an immediate threat to a woman’s right to choose. If elected, I will fight to pass legislation that guarantees a woman’s right to choose in all 50 states. #CommitToRoe @NARAL https://t.co/BdCK4QXlUv
I’ve spent my career in public service fighting to pass legislation to strengthen anti-discrimination protections &amp; expand access to critical support programs for those with disabilities. In Congress, I will work tirelessly to ensure the ADA is never weakened or repealed.
Pleased to join Bruce Darling and my friends at @CDRNYS to celebrate the 28th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act! This landmark legislation outlawed discrimination on the basis of disability, giving hope and opportunity to those with different &amp; special abilities. https://t.co/cOiSWjkern

In NY, I’ve spent my entire career fighting for and protecting the rights of all women. And in Congress, I’ll continue to be a tireless champion for choice and never stop working to protect access to the reproductive healthcare services women need and deserve.

Separating families is reprehensible, and that is why I stand with @ActTogetherROC and all those around the country participating in today’s #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch to demand that families stay together.
"Where are my children? When will I get to see them? Who will help reunite us?” 		These are the questions thousands of immigrants are still asking and no one in the #TrumpAdministration has an answer.
Enjoyed seeing so many friends and neighbors at the Penfield Independence Day parade this morning! To those celebrating an early #FourthofJuly this weekend, have fun and stay safe in the heat! https://t.co/zceWlUE6LL
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone at the Capital Gazette in Maryland. I am sickened by yet another tragic shooting. We cannot allow these atrocities to become our new normal - we must take action on gun control measures now. https://t.co/FI3uBfIal3
As the home of the modern labor movement, NY has led the way in protecting workers’ rights. I’ve been proud to stand with my brothers &amp; sisters in labor to create more jobs with fair wages &amp; expand access to quality healthcare, and I’ll continue to fight for that in Congress.
I’m deeply disappointed that the Supreme Court has prioritized profit-driven special interests over working people in its #Janus decision. Labor unions are the cornerstone of our workforce &amp; essential to the success of our middle class. https://t.co/5Xgfax7ELy

NY has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, including measures banning the sale of assault weapons and ensuring mandatory universal background checks on gun purchases. I’m ready to take on Trump and the NRA and fight to bring these much-needed policies to Washington.
On #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I #WearOrange because the safety of our children and grandchildren’s future depends on Americans standing up to demand common-sense gun reforms NOW. How much more must we endure before leaders in Washington realize #EnoughIsEnough? https://t.co/7HsnjEAQok
Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens - and right now, @realDonaldTrump is failing.
Following the Great Recession, leaders in Washington took action to create safeguards &amp; prevent another crisis like that from ever happening again. Now, Trump is attempting to gut those regulations &amp; prioritize Wall Street at the expense of Main Street. https://t.co/VOYtqbdXKH
Leaders in Washington have failed to take action on these issues &amp; thereby failed the American people. It is unacceptable. In Congress, I’ll fight to deliver the same common-sense gun control measures we have enacted in NY. For the sake of our children, we must take action now.
I’m grateful to @MomsDemand for recognizing me as a #GunSense Candidate. Gun violence is a scourge plaguing our neighborhoods - that’s why I have been proud to help NY pass some of the toughest gun laws in the country, including measures that ban the sale of assault rifles. https://t.co/eZXCnfxHUp

Donald Trump &amp; Republicans in Congress are at it again advancing a heartless piece of legislation that will cut access to critical food assistance programs for over 2 million struggling families. Join me in the fight to stand up to Trump &amp; #FlipTheHouse https://t.co/SXdWcu1DBM
Lawn signs are in! Pick one up at our office at Monroe County Democratic Committee Headquarters. I’m humbled by the incredible grassroots support our campaign has received - together, we will create a brighter future for all who call #NY25 home. https://t.co/SJoL3293Kl
In Congress, I’ll always stand up for our shared values and protect the hardworking families who call #NY25 home.
An afternoon talking to voters in the City of #Roc is one well spent! I continue to hear from community members who are concerned about Trump’s extremist agenda that threatens their healthcare, their jobs, &amp; the safety of this nation. https://t.co/Kl2Za84ijR
Had a great time participating in the @ROCLilacFest parade! A time-honored community tradition showcasing the beautiful lilac blooms in Highland Park. One the best parts about Spring in #Roc - even in the rain! #LilacFest https://t.co/qsXrwLEoyY
Sadly, this is the kind of misguided and heartless leadership we have come to expect from @realDonaldTrump and leaders in Congress.
Yet again &amp; without hesitation, Donald Trump turns his back on our nation’s hardworking families by placing essential children's health programming on the chopping block to continue subsidizing profit-driven special interests &amp; the wealthiest one percent. https://t.co/3A2BB0X0G9
In Congress, I’ll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the @AFTunion in the fight to ensure our schools and educators have access to the essential resources and tools they need to help our children achieve the highest levels of success. #NY25
I’m so grateful to have the support of the @AFTunion! Our teacher workforce is one of our nation’s greatest strengths - we need to make certain we are supporting and treating educators as the incredible assets they are. https://t.co/BbyzuMRUCU
My mother is one of Team Morelle’s most dedicated volunteers - hard at work stuffing envelopes today! https://t.co/zIekICMA69
I find these allegations both shocking &amp; reprehensible. For the sake of the victims, who have demonstrated incredible courage &amp; resilience, and all people who call NY home I urge Eric Schneiderman to take this opportunity, do what is right &amp; resign the Office of Attorney General. https://t.co/F006zwcjhT
In Congress I will stand up, fight back, and work every single day to support our hardworking families, create strong jobs with good wages, and ensure access to healthcare for every person. #NY25 https://t.co/AmLlkAzyPX
The men and women of @AFLCIO know that it’s time to reclaim our future and recapture the promise of an America that works for ALL people. Unfortunately, @realDonaldTrump has betrayed that promise and rigged the system in favor of the wealthiest few at the expense of the many. https://t.co/pxlMWOr9zk
It’s been a beautiful weekend to knock on doors! Always a joy to talk with neighbors about how we can build a better community for everyone who calls #NY25 home. https://t.co/NL0Fg9XcUL
The @NRA and profit-driven gun interests are pulling the strings of Donald Trump and the extremists in Washington.  It’s time to declare, with our voices and our votes, that we demand action now. #gunsense #GunControlNow
The only thing that frightens me as much as the scourge of gun violence terrorizing our nation is the failure of @realDonaldTrump and leaders in Congress to take action and enact much-needed, common sense gun control measures. https://t.co/gaqUWBLtuz
Proud to be endorsed by @steelworkers! Growing up in a union home I learned early on: when working families succeed, our nation thrives. That's why I'll never stop fighting to expand job opportunities/strengthen wages &amp; ensure universal healthcare for all. https://t.co/aco1YHrG4x
Since this time, Trump and his allies have waged an unrelenting assault on families and our most vulnerable citizens. That is why it’s so important that we #FlipTheHouse this November and ensure a universal healthcare system where no one is left behind.
One year ago today, @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans advanced fundamentally flawed, heartless legislation that sought to strip healthcare options from over 24 million hardworking Americans &amp; needlessly gut critical #healthcare programs. https://t.co/JL0XMN6VeU
Enjoyed the chance to tour Sheet Metal Workers Local 46 this afternoon! I got to see their robust apprenticeship program in action. It is critical that we continue to support programs like these that equip workers with the skills they need to succeed. #NY25 #Roc https://t.co/bV5AKaivEB
I am honored to have the support of these dedicated men and women. #NY25
Always a pleasure spending time with Paul Markwitz, President of @Teamsters Local 118, and their hardworking members! My grandfather Joe Morelle, for whom I am named, was a Teamster - in fact, he helped to organize the Utica branch. https://t.co/utjniBIred
Enjoyed the chance to talk with members of the Sweden/Clarkson Democratic Committees tonight! It’s exciting to see so much energy &amp; enthusiasm surrounding the race for #NY25. Together we will take on @realDonaldTrump and ensure our hardworking families have a voice in Washington. https://t.co/3hFfpiJkw7
Throughout my time in public service, I have been proud to advance policies and proposals that create opportunity for all people—and I will bring that same fight to Congress. The hardworking men and women in Monroe County deserve nothing less.
I am humbled to receive the endorsement of the @WorkingFamilies Party. Now more than ever, it is critical that we have leaders who will stand up to extremists in Washington and never lose sight of the fundamental progressive ideals most important to our community. #NY25 https://t.co/EJdY5sCflH
I've been humbled by the incredible grassroots support our campaign has received over the past month. We've hit the ground running - now we need to keep the momentum going. Sign up to volunteer at https://t.co/YA1G3gw3sm and help us get our message out to voters! https://t.co/tGYPB0bqFZ
I’m proud to stand alongside my brothers and sisters of @1199SEIU to fight for the fair wages and essential protections every workers deserves. We must ensure stability and security of our hardworking families is our top priority. https://t.co/U7vF8DiX9y
For the sake of our children, we need to fight back, #standupforscience, and advance policies that ensure clean air, clean water and a sustainable planet are treated as fundamental rights.
.@realDonaldTrump and his enablers in Congress continue to put profit-driven corporate interests ahead of the critical need to protect our environment and safeguard against the growing threats imposed by climate change. https://t.co/nwPumLRLpW
Delighted to join my good friend @tomdinapoli to celebrate @@MCDC_Rochester this evening. Let’s continue the momentum and elect strong Democrats up and down the ballot in this year’s elections, including in #NY25! https://t.co/7afH0wIGbG
.@RealDonaldTrump’s repeated attempts to influence the Mueller investigation threaten to upend the guiding principles of our nation. It’s distressing that this legislation is even necessary.	https://t.co/Z37sepNdKx
Throughout my career I have been proud to advocate on behalf of New York’s schools and will continue to build upon these investments in Washington to ensure students and teachers everywhere receive the essential support and resources they deserve.
As the proud husband of a retired schoolteacher, I am especially grateful to have the support of @nysut &amp; the many teachers and professionals they represent. Education extends far beyond the reach of the classroom to build the foundation of the earliest dreams of our children. https://t.co/wmJbvW8cgq
There is a lot of energy and excitement building around the race for #NY25, especially in Pittsford! Thanks to @PittsfordDems for hosting me last night - enjoyed talking about my candidacy and how we can work together to flip the House this November. #BlueWave2018 https://t.co/I9faAKWiyZ
.@realDonaldTrump continues to wage an unrelenting war on hardworking families. Congress cannot allow this proposal to advance any further - we need to uplift and protect those who are struggling and most in need, not make it harder for them to get ahead. https://t.co/Yrmknl0tD8
We need leaders who will empower our scientific community and commit to advancing evidence-based policies that protect our planet and the wellbeing of future generations.
Yet another example of the Trump Administration’s continued efforts to undermine environmental safety and promote junk-science. This cannot continue. https://t.co/5JKJagYHsT
Working men and women are the backbone of our society. I’m humbled to have the support of @Insulators26 - it has been my honor to stand alongside them and I will continue to do so in Washington. https://t.co/XCJKl0VQaq
With a President who denies the very real effects of climate change and advances policies that roll back environmental regulation, it is more important than ever this #EarthDay to recommit to protecting our environment &amp; ensuring its future sustainability. https://t.co/dkzW74gj2a
I am truly grateful to all of our local volunteer ambulance workers for their courage and devotion to keeping our community safe. It was a pleasure to join @BillMoehle1 to honor the selfless men and women of @townofbrighton volunteer ambulance - thank you for all you do! https://t.co/MtmQbA6noj
Very grateful to have an overwhelming level of support from our local labor community. These men and women are working hard to ensure we elect strong leaders everywhere who will fight tirelessly for working families everywhere.
Inspired by so many of our union activists, like those who attended today’s @RGVALF_AFLCIO Campaign School, who are taking on active roles in our local &amp; national campaigns. These dedicated men and women are critical to ensuring we flip the House in November. https://t.co/XpYm81RGAm
No better way to spend a Saturday than talking to voters! Grateful for the opportunity to speak with the dedicated and passionate committee members of Rochester’s 25th Legislative District and discuss how we can work together to create a brighter future for all of #Roc. https://t.co/BrMCoHggij
I continue to hear from so many seniors throughout our community who are worried about Donald Trump’s continued efforts to slash medicare and cut social security. In Congress, I will fight back and work to ensure seniors have the essential supports and protections they deserve. https://t.co/HtBDgJGmzF
They deserve immediate action from Donald Trump &amp; leaders in Congress to ban the sale of military-style assault weapons, strengthen gun background checks, &amp; make the sale of bump stock devices illegal. For the sake of our nation and all those we have lost, the time to act is now.
I am inspired by the courage of the students who have spearheaded this movement and I stand in solidarity with them as they participate in #NationalSchoolWalkout today. These brave students, and the many victims of gun violence across America, deserve to be heard.
Today, on the anniversary of the tragic Columbine shooting, millions of people across the nation are joining together and speaking with one voice to proclaim that we refuse to sit idly by while our children &amp; families are terrorized by gun violence. https://t.co/nM7D4kjLfd
Thank you to the dedicated men and women of @RWDSU Local 220 for the opportunity to meet and discuss the issues most important to your hardworking members. And yes, sadly it is snowing. That’s #Roc for ya! https://t.co/SmVH4Trw4X
Special thanks to the hardworking members of @ATUlocal282 for taking time out of their day to talk to with me about the important work they are doing to serve transit workers in our community. https://t.co/SA2Dyhtyd3

From fighting for fair wages to expanding health coverage, I have been privileged to stand alongside the hardworking members of @Laborers435 throughout my career.

Humbled by the outpouring of support from so many in our labor community, including the Int'l Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers. #EqualPayDay reminds us of the important role unions play in ensuring an honest day's work equals an honest day's pay for ALL men &amp; women. https://t.co/SjQDDznNdq
Across our nation, too many women are the victims of a #GenderWageGap that is shortchanging them and their families. This is unacceptable, and it is why we must continue to fight to ensure women receive the respect and dignity of a fair &amp; equal wage. #EqualPayDay
Members of @ATUlocal282 are some of the most dedicated public servants in our community -I am truly grateful for their support. Now, more than ever, it is critical that we have a representative Washington who will work tirelessly on behalf of our working families. https://t.co/jK1zUjRCNr

I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the issues that are most important to women in our labor community.

I am so grateful to have the support of @Teamsters Local 118.

From Susan B. Anthony to Louise Slaughter, NY has a strong, proud legacy of advancing women’s rights &amp; never backing down from those who would threaten them.
