I could not in good conscience support HJRes31, because it increases spending in areas unrelated to national security when thousands are dying from drugs coming across our Southern border, &amp; others are suffering injuries &amp; death at the hands of people who came here illegally.
Today, the House passed my bill, the SAID Act. It would provide transparency &amp; accountability where there is currently no uniform standard for recordkeeping within federal agencies. Watch my speech on the House floor regarding the bill here:	https://t.co/l6tryp9C3B

On the other hand, I think Rod Rosenstein has not represented the DOJ well, especially regarding Congressional oversight and document production. This is what I told the CNN reporter; CNN reinterpreting my comments for the sake of headlines is the very definition of fake news.
As it stands, Jeff Sessions is doing his job when the only leaks are coming from those being investigated. While I share the President’s concerns about the Russia investigation and believe it should end, Jeff Sessions is recused from that.
A recent CNN news story mischaracterized my trust in Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He has my full trust and I think he's done an excellent job in de-politicizing the DOJ. The DOJ has many ongoing investigations and Jeff Sessions will ultimately be judged by their outcomes.

We must continue supporting our intelligence agencies as they protect us from those who would undermine our nation. Further, the 2016 election was not ultimately undermined. President Trump should take satisfaction that the American people elected him despite Russia's efforts.
Our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia was successful only in hacking the DNC server. I'm glad President Trump has admitted he misspoke at the press conference &amp; I encourage him to evaluate the current situation as Russia continues to try to divide us.
Putin is clearly a ruthless leader determined to make Russia a feared nation. I'm sure his operatives tried to influence the 2016 election, as confirmed by the CIA &amp; congressional investigations. But this shouldn't be confused with collusion between Russia &amp; Trump's campaign.

I hope we not only remember how Dr. King died, but how he lived. He understood there are some causes so valuable that they are worth giving up our comfort, security, and perhaps even our lives. #MLK50
I recalled a testimony I once heard from Dr. Andrew Young, a witness to Dr. King’s murder. He said he realized later that Dr. King had done more for their cause in his death than he had in life. Dr. Young reflected, “There is no redemption without the shedding of blood.”
Congress held a special ceremony today to honor MLK Jr.’s life, marking the 50th anniversary of his death. He believed in justice and in advancing the cause through love instead of hate.
Speaker Ryan has given great service to our nation &amp; now with his decision to retire, he is demonstrating the character and sense of personal priorities that we all should emulate…that our 1st obligation is to our family, spouses &amp; children. I wish him &amp; his family the very best
I will miss @SpeakerRyan, especially our policy discussions, but I fully understand his reasons for retiring and have the utmost respect for his decision.

I continue to be committed to supporting our military, to working to find ways to eliminate deficits, reducing our national debt, and restoring the fiscal health and stability for our nation that is essential to the future well-being of every American.
While I strongly support the increased funding for our military, I could not in good conscience vote for the Omnibus that costs almost $1.3 trillion. The military threats to our national security are real and serious, but so is the fiscal threat to our national security.
Millions of Americans across the country are now reaping the benefits of tax reform in the form of higher paychecks, and my district is no exception. #AL06  https://t.co/xLSDaW5ATP

I hope President Trump will consider that there are other ways to address the rogue trade practices of countries like China.
While I understand President Trump’s desire to protect U.S. businesses, I believe the new proposed broad-based tariffs could roll back much of the progress manufacturing has made and increase product costs. Tariffs, like taxes, are ultimately borne by American consumers.
Significant tax and regulatory reforms by the President and Congress, combined with tremendous reductions in U.S. energy costs, have made America’s economy competitive again and have put U.S. manufacturing in the best position globally in years.
