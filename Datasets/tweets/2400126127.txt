The issue at stake is whether workers are fairly judged based on their ability to perform a job or whether they’re discriminated against. Congress should ban the use of credit reports for employment purposes, with only very limited exceptions for a few specific job positions 6/6
The overwhelming weight of evidence is that people with impaired credit histories are not more likely to be bad employees. The earliest study on this issue concluded there is no correlation between credit history and an employee’s job performance. #WhosKeepingScore 5/6 @ChiChiWu8
The use of credit checks in hiring discriminates against African American and	Latinx job applicants. African Americans and Latinx consumers have lower credit scores as a group, meaning they fare worse when their credit reports are considered in employment. #WhosKeepingScore 4/6
Credit checks create a fundamental Catch-22 for job applicants. Workers who lose their jobs are likely to fall behind on their bills due to lack of income. If credit reports are used against them, these workers now find themselves shut out of the job market. #WhosKeepingScore 3/6
One survey reported that 1 in 10 respondents who were unemployed had been informed that they would not be hired for a job because of the information in their credit reports. @ChiChiWu8 #WhosKeepingScore 2/6
Thread: The use of credit reports in employment is a practice that is harmful and unfair to American workers. Despite many good reasons to avoid engaging in this practice, about half of employers do so today. @ChiChiWu8 #WhosKeepingScore
A more effective solution than changing scoring models would be to require the credit bureaus to remove any paid or settled medical debt and delay reporting medical debt--giving consumers time to resolve complex, confusing medical billing issues. @ChiChiWu8 #WhosKeepingScore
There is strong evidence that medical debt items are not an accurate reflection of the creditworthiness of the consumer. @CFPB found that medical debt unfairly penalizes a consumer’s credit score by 10 points-- 22 points if the debt is subsequently paid. #WhosKeepingScore
Medical bills result from services that are frequently involuntary, unplanned, &amp; unpredictable, &amp; for which prices quotes are rarely provided. Yet as @CFPB found, medical debt represents 1/2 of all debt collection entries that appear on credit reports @ChiChiWu8 #WhosKeepingScore

“For decades, the rent to own industry has evaded core consumer protection laws to target and drain wealth from families, especially households of color, already living on the edge,” said @NCLC4consumers @SkaddenArps Fellow @bd_highsmith
Under these laws, RTO companies can use arrest or the threat of arrest to intimidate struggling customers. Charges may even be brought against individuals who have already paid the full retail value of the goods, but simply have not paid the excessively high financing charges.
Rent-to-own companies have pushed for laws allowing them to pursue criminal charges against their customers, resulting in the enactment of “rental theft laws” in nearly every state. These state statutes can unfairly capture RTO customers who simply fall behind on a payment.

Don't put medical debt on a credit card! If you put #medicaldebt on a credit card, you lose protections you may have. Then, it's just credit card debt and the hospital has no incentive to work with you. @JeniferBosco @NPRLifeKit https://t.co/tV1dNt25Js
“For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties,” Ginsburg wrote. https://t.co/acjt1n9don
#StoptheDebtTrap, @CFPB https://t.co/ebNxHVCtxG
In a policy report called "The Dark Side of Payroll Withholding to Repay Student Loans," @NCLC4consumers advocates argue a system like the one proposed could force borrowers to choose between payments &amp; rent, heat, or food. #DefendBorrowers #DefendStudents https://t.co/CZSE378QNf
"In terms of magic words, financial assistance policy and charity care are the words to use," @NCLC4consumers attorney @JeniferBosco discusses negotiating medical bills and making the debt collection calls stop. @NPRLifeKit https://t.co/tV1dNt25Js
"When innovative, new models enter the federal aid [student loan] system, there should be clear guardrails. We can develop thoughtful, robust outcomes measures but doing so will take time. It won’t happen on the tight timeline of this rule making." #negreg https://t.co/Y7qz2AkR27
@jenDanser31 @TalkPoverty @CFPB @lsaundersnclc The Trump administration has proposed to rollback rules that would rein in the short-term payday loans and was scheduled to go into effect this year. People have until May 14 to submit comments regarding this rollback at: https://t.co/0dqUR7ILX7
A brief released by @NCLC4consumers last week raised concerns about employers’ access to borrower information. “There’s no way to get around the fact that you can’t make a formula that works for everybody,” said NCLC attorney Persis Yu. #DefendBorrowers https://t.co/b5xgAp6EJG

Automatic payroll withholding could mean diverting money from rent or food...depriving families of income to cover necessities. “While the student loan repayment system is in desperate need of overhaul, forced automatic payroll withholding misses the mark" https://t.co/oI9IDM2S5k

“We’re confident that someday California will eradicate cash bail entirely," said @DaveySeligman, director of Towards Justice. “The bail sureties have profited for too long off their collusive conduct on the backs of some of the most marginalized members of society.” #BailReform
“This rigged system disproportionately hurts low-income folks and their families, who are often the ones scrambling to get their loved ones freed from jail and back home,” said Stephanie Carroll, senior staff attorney with @PublicCounsel. @BailReformCA
“The surety cartel’s overpriced bail bonds harm thousands of Californians, including people who were arrested but never even charged, and family members who paid the inflated price to secure the release of their loved ones,” said @benelga, ED of Justice Catalyst. @BailReformCA

Lifeline products serve some of the most economically fragile consumers, including those traumatized by domestic violence.  For many survivors, prepaid wireless providers are the only safe and affordable option. #LifelineForSurvivors #LifelineAwarenessWeek https://t.co/tCHbRLvjPo

@jrkoren @CRLONLINE @FinTechEsq Installment loans are a type of payday loan.
@reporterev @jrkoren @CRLONLINE @FinTechEsq 36% state rate cap for all loans is reasonable and fair. And yes, dig into the fine print to see if there are forced arbitration clauses which severely restrict consumers' legal rights. The only ones who win are the businesses with forced arbitration.
@jrkoren @CRLONLINE @FinTechEsq Could push lenders to longer-term high cost installment loans which trap people even more. See our report which recommends states adopt a 36% interest rate cap, allowing for profit without gouging people. #StoptheDebtTrap https://t.co/DsUmlzPqmE

"We also urge students and the people who care about them to send comments to the Dept. of Ed telling it to put students and taxpayers first over predatory schools," said Shafroth. Submit comments here as soon as rules are posted tomorrow: https://t.co/48TOPjc4q8 #DefendStudents
“We urge the Department of Education to promptly implement the 2016 rules and to use this rulemaking to make it easier, not harder for students to get relief," said Shafroth. #DefendStudents #4profit
“If these proposed rules are implemented, schools will continue to break the law and harm students with impunity, and student borrowers will continue to pay the price,” said Shafroth. #DefendStudents #4profit
The Department can and should apply rules that deter schools from lying to students to get them to enroll and that ensure students who were taken advantage of have real access to relief," said @NCLC4consumers atty. Abby Shafroth. #DefendStudents from #4profit fraud
“But for too many #Americans it has done the opposite—putting targets on low-income students &amp; #veterans who are recruited by predatory institutions focused on growth &amp; profit instead of education &amp; career training. It doesn’t have to be this way," said Shafroth.

Bottom line: #studentloan payments are not more important than paying for necessities like heat, food, rent, and should NOT be taken out of wages. @NYTimes gets it wrong: https://t.co/OP8QNaQNYU
Taking money from #studentloan borrowers’ paychecks makes more sense in Australia, where only people who earn &gt;$44,000 must pay. U.S. borrowers earning as little as $18,210 would have their pay docked. This can doom low-income Americans’ efforts to stay afloat. #ProtectConsumers
There are much better solutions to America's #studentloan default problem than just taking money out of struggling borrowers’ paychecks. #DefendStudents
