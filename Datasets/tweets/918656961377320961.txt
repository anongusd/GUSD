Weapons of mass destruction. An end-time Elijah. The true gospel preached around the world. The true Church splitting apart. These are four signs of Jesus‚Äôs return that God inspired to be recorded and miraculously preserved in the Bible for 2,000 yrs today all been fulfilled!
4. The true Church splitting apart.
3. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come‚Äù
2. The coming of an Elijah who would ‚Äúrestore all things‚Äù is indeed a pivotal sign that we are in the end time. Just like the sign of weapons of mass destruction, this sign of an Elijah was given by Jesus Christ Himself. And, just like that sign, this one has already occurred!
1. So when you see wars and rumors of wars increasing‚Äîand you see famines, pestilences and earthquakes increasing‚Äîdo not pretend everything is normal. Sit up and take notice!
For Christians who believe Jesus Christ, there is no escaping this fact: He personally predicted that He would supernaturally return, and that there would be signs immediately preceding that event‚Äîsigns we should watch for.  Cont. https://t.co/TamL9TneXt
