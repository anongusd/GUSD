Great to know that an ELECTED CONGRESSMAN is now working to abolish the first amendment and turn America into a theocracy. Take lessons from literally any theocracy in history, as well as modern day Saudi Arabia and Iran, and fucking don't. https://t.co/W5UBzRGcPj

@LisaM3732 @ItsHv @PoliticaPolls I'm not discounting every other dem candidate just because they aren't Bernie- hell, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are pretty high on my list, but I'd still support Bernie over those 2 because of the former's lack of experience and the latter's remarks against LGBT people.
@ItsHv @PoliticaPolls @LisaM3732 Why? He's the most popular congressperson in the country, has successfully spearheaded attempts to get out of foreign wars and increase the minimum wage for our workers, and his most well-known policies are extremely popular with the people. This is Bernie's year without a doubt.

@philosophrob They know how popular candidates like Yang and Bernie are. They know what the people want- unfortunately for them, the will of the people and the will of their donors are mutually exclusive, so the establishment is stopping at nothing to preserve our stagnation and their wealth.
@ForecasterEnten As it stands now Bernie, but for whatever reason if he decides not to run, I'm putting my support behind Yang. #RunBernieRun
Great to see this action against the downright authoritarian actions Trump has encouraged.

"Oh, we may be bombing Yemen into the Stone Age, blocking food stamps and welfare, and screwing over thousands of government workers, but at least we're CIVIL about it!"
@RepRWilliams @POTUS Doesn't matter who supports it; It's a waste of money when we have other pressing issues to address instead of supporting a shutdown. Wouldn't we be better suited in passing desperately needed infrastructure reform, getting our vets off the street, or addressing the opiod crisis?
