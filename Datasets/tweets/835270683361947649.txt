Obviously can’t speak for every sector of the border, but the lack of alarming news coming from its 2,000 mi stretch should lead everyone to believe this response is not justified. We all can agree we need border security, but do we need MORE? Everyone should be asking this q.
The fact that no one seems to challenge the notion that the border is a war zone that needs to be secured is mind-boggling to me. The border is safe. It’s already heavily militarized. I went into Mexico yesterday, had a nice lunch, waited 3 hours to drive back. No crisis.
It’s so surreal to be home RIGHT NEXT to the southern border while Trump has shut down the government due to the “crisis” here. Let me tell you, the only crisis we have involves the long lines of wealthy Mexicans coming to US to shop in OUR stores, bringing $ to OUR communities

Now California Republicans are basically extinct. The CA Republican Party is practically defunct. It’s just unbelievable it happened this fast. Demographic changes quickly caught up to those districts, and Donald Trump gave them the last push.
