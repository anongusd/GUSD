Related: did #sq788 include paraphernalia legalization or are the police planning to arrest patients for having pipes?
Instead of ‚Äúhow do we make sure patients are protected?‚Äù They‚Äôre asking ‚Äúhow can we still bust them?‚Äù
They‚Äôre acting like they‚Äôve never done field sobriety tests before. Maybe call Oregon, Washington, Colorado, California? Ask them how they do it. Y‚Äôall gave DUIs for cannabis before. Nothing‚Äôs changed except simple possession isn‚Äôt a crime for licensed people.
It‚Äôs very frustrating that the police are hyper focused on how to arrest people for cannabis even if it is legal under #sq788. A patient driving home from a dispensary is going to smell like cannabis and also have positive test for THC. That alone should not be cause for a DUI.

Someone give me a hill, I'm fucking done.
Everyday I watch politicians play with medical care like it's a football. They don't care if I live or die. Many would probably prefer I die because my cost outweighs my productivity.
It was kinda nice not to worry about planning something like that but now I realize those are memories I will probably never make. Even if I felt well enough to do it, I have no one to invite.
The only mail I get is bills. Once a year I get a couple Christmas cards. I didn't get to have a wedding. We just signed papers at a restaurant because I needed insurance ASAP since my job had fired me for leaving to go to the emergency room.
Being disabled is shitty enough on its own without the growing isolation. People get disappointed when you cant do things with them, they stop calling eventually. I've been sick for 15 years. The only phone calls I get are debt collectors and automated appointment reminders.
Rarely do I feel as utterly useless as I do right now. I have all the time in the world and my body just won't cooperate. I don't want to be sick anymore. It hurts too much and I'm so alone. I haven't seen anyone but my partner since Christmas. I'm just stuck in this house.

If I was not in the USA, these same medications would cost $1,500 a dose without insurance. Here they are $5,000-20,000 every six weeks.
Now I‚Äôm married to someone with fairly decent insurance but my medical costs are upwards of $20,000 a year. That‚Äôs with insurance. After I meet my deductible I have to pay ‚Äúco-insurance‚Äù which is exempt from the max out of pocket.
None of these jobs offered insurance until after six months. Had I not been in a state that took the Medicaid expansion I would have been without any medical care.
3. Took time as I could. My boss was chronically ill too so we covered for each other. Unfortunately, our district manager refused to bring in help from other stores when we needed it. It got to be too much. I developed Drug Induced Lupus from my autoimmune meds. Had to quit.
I was terminated for that.
2. Never took a sick day. Bent over backwards. Missed doctors appointments. Supervisor refused to grant a reasonable accommodation I requested to not have to work 90 hours in ten days as I was getting a cold. On day ten I had bronchitis. I had an asthma attack and left to ER
Do I go to work sick and risk getting worse? Or do I take the day off and get another black mark on my record? My last three jobs:	1. Mostly worked, occasionally took unpaid sick leave. Demoted and hours cut after I was hospitalized. 	(Continued)
I have severe autoimmune illness. This means I need $$$$ worth of drugs monthly to be functional and work. Unfortunately the drugs don‚Äôt always work perfect and I get sick sometimes.

If we forget small farmers, we will end up with more industrial conglomerates and more rural poverty.
Farmers need libraries, they need compensation for injuries on the job, they need predatory tractor loan relief, they need access to market places, they need roads, they need schools, they need many of the same things people who live in the city do, and also different ones.
If we toss small farms by the wayside, we will end up with more large industrial farms. This isn‚Äôt good for anyone.
Farmers are vital part of our country. And as you may know, we need food or we die. Do not forget the farmers. Small farmers often live year to year, harvest to harvest. It‚Äôs a very insecure livelihood. They need support, they need to have their needs addressed.
Big agribusiness is never going to swing left, small farms have in the past and may in the future. It‚Äôs frustrating but remember, small farms have more voters that big agribusinesses do. Small farms are key.
Farmers want health care, reliable income, security, clean water, access to education, and public services. Rural poverty is extreme in many areas and it feels like rural people are getting left behind in the movement to the left. They grow our food, we need them with us.
The left movement in this country needs to consider farmer‚Äôs needs and wants. There is a reason rural areas are Rebuplican, often they are forgotten by Democrats and others to the left. At the least, take a page out of the DFL‚Äôs book and make sure small farms have health care.

@DIRECTVService Hello, can you help?
@ATT I just want to pay you money for a service but apparently you will not install the service due to internal errors.
@ATT apparently there was an error with order that was placed by phone by an ATT rep. Doesn't explain two weeks of service no shows.
@ATT spent over 5 hours in the last two weeks trying to get this sorted out and no resolution or service yet.
@ATT messed up our internet and @directv install again and didn't show up. Two weeks in a row. No curtesy call, still won't tell me when.
