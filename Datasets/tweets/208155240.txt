@jsomaney @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness We do not know the backstory yet.  The WSJ reported/suggested this company has been used by the Chinese Gov to spy.  I am not making a judgement until I know more. Ghosn is sitting in jail  while they decide on charges.  No official charges but he's locked up. It's different.
@pakakobre @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness It's a public company does the board not know how much comp he made? Not buying it.  Lots of upset over his plans to merge Nissan w Renault
@pakakobre @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Evidence?
@BHH_STIG @alancheng333tw1 @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness He was in the process of merging Japan's jewel -Nissan with Frances Renault
@phire7 @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness @Huawei I am not sure. Was the company used by the Chinese government to spy?
Everyone knows this Carlos Ghosn arrest is totally political.  I will say it again- what kind of a judicial system puts a guy in jail w/o any charges.  And keeps extending jail time? are we to believe japan is a capitalist country? @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness this is shameful
