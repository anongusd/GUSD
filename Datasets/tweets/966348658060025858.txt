@nytimes @nytimes your story lacks details: Was it an ice cube or more than one. Was it a cube or round?  Clearly, cubed ice with it’s sharp unmelted corners could be more hazardous and dangerous when employed as a weapon.  Or, was it crushed ice which could have melted before impact?
@nytimes What the hell has happened to the @nytimes ? @sarahjeong perhaps?  This ice story should have already been investigated during 1 of the other 6 investigations.  👀@SenFeinstein for withholding the Ford info for 6+ weeks.  That is a story.
@Mimirocah1 Talk about a witch hunt.  Well it is October.  👀@SenFeinstein she had more than 6 weeks to initiate an investigation.
@KamalaHarris #InvestigateFeinstein 👀@SenFeinstein 45 days she withheld the information you now want investigated.

@nytimes Questions I still have, doctor: who invited you? what beer did you drink?what were you wearing? what did the room look like?  how were you held down?  was clothing removed? what was said?  how long were you there?  time of day? how long did it take you to get home?  who was home?
@jacobsoboroff stop calling it an alleged sexual assault; it is a reported allegation of attempted sexual assault.  #wordsmatter. “Four alleged sexual assaults” that is why people don’t believe the media.  You can learn from @megynkelly #factsmatter

@DylanDreyerNBC Potato bread is good too.  Creamy peanut butter on each piece, strawberry jam I the middle; about a teaspoon so it doesn’t leak out.  Peanut butter on each piece prevents the jam from seeping through the bread.  Enjoy!!!!

@CNN That was okay?  All this from the under oath admitted leaker.  Must be okay because he leaked to (Yale?) professor.  Absolutely no accountability and his book will fund his retirement.
What I’ve gathered from Zuckerberg’s testimony is that Facebook censors (deletes) conservative pages, Catholic pages and lets @PPFA (Planned Parenthood) and @MoveOn run rampant.  Food for thought, right there.  @FoxNews @BillOReilly

@marcorubio Give the NRA back it’s money and represent everyone.  No civilian needs an assault weapon.  Let shooting ranges rent them out for the thrill seekers; capitalism at work.  #Parkland #BanGuns
@RepHastingsFL This is not true.  False statements.  Wow, Rep. Hastings where do you get your information.  Uniformed representation = uninformed decisions.  Do your research.

@TheFive...impossible to put the police everywhere they need to be; malls, schools, churches, movie theaters etc.  The common denominators are easy access to guns and mental health.  Access, is by far the easiest to address.  Maybe need more mental health in-patient facilities.

There is a suggestion to arm teachers.  Are they the same teachers who buy their own classroom supplies?
