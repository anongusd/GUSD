@MLS @ColoradoRapids Please fire @adidassoccer.
@dylanw @JadeEJF It’s just so craven that they do that. Unfortunately, our government doesn’t seem to have any appetite to protect us either.
@JadeEJF I find it’s easier to ignore a lot of the disinfo on Twitter for some reason. It also doesn’t seem to have as much of an impact as what’s on Facebook. Twitter is really problematic in its own ways, obviously, but not quite at the scale (yet) of Facebook.		I’ll miss Naked City!
@JadeEJF If you go to Google News and search Facebook it’s wild how many articles come up about Facebook’s abuses. Every six months or so Zuckerberg does an apology tour but they seem to behave worse over time instead of better.
@JadeEJF The myriad privacy violations, despite apologies and promises of fixes, that have continue unabated (because they’re a feature not a bug) is most glaring. But the amplification of disinformation is equally concerning and perhaps more damaging at a societal level.
@JadeEJF They’re both bad and amplify the worst parts of society (and ourselves). But the way Facebook conducts itself as a company is outrageously harmful. 		Somewhat surprisingly, I don’t miss it in the least (not even the so-called good parts). It’s been a big relief to let it go.
@ScoutWithBryan No, you couldn’t.
@aaronhahnmedia I thought I’d miss it a little. I don’t at all. Like not even one little bit. So that’s been a nice surprise.
I recently deleted my Facebook account (permanently deleted not just deactivated). Given how uniformly bad Facebook is — both at a personal and societal level — it feels good to be able to walk the walk and be rid of it.

@TBpnw That’s a legitimately tough transition. Especially because he’s probably frustrated and it’s affecting his confidence and self-worth. But the fact you’re seeing it early is really good.
@TBpnw Speaking from my own experience, the transition from “everything is easy and I’m just really smart” to “oh, wait, I have to try now” was not an easy one to make. But quite a few good books available on this that might help if you think it’s relevant.
@TBpnw Tough one. Just spitballing...was there much effort required in the past to get good grades? If not, and there’s more effort required now, it could be part of the issue. There’s a lot of discussion nowadays about focusing on effort rather than results.

@IsaacDovere There are a billion reasons for why this is a terrible idea starting with the fact that Schultz will get slaughtered in his own state. He’s radioactive here. So, I guess let him burn his money?
@TylerTeton Exactly.
Good morning. Reading tweets this morning and I realized I’m going to be angry at Bernie Sanders for the next 20 months.

@willfnye @jbarro Do you not see a difference between a bunch of MAGA hat wearing private school racists and victims of a mass shooting who were subsequently attacked by the NRA among others? The Parkland kids waded those waters by themselves at first. The MAGA kids had a PR firm within a day.

@erich333 Ok, that’s fair. Although by the standard described (clear evidence through indictments, etc) there’s literally nothing about the Obama administration that rises to that level.
@erich333 I asked a yes or no question — if clear evidence of criminality becomes publicly available through indictments or other means (which may include emails, texts, or recordings and not just witness accounts), would that affect your support of Trump?
@erich333 Honest question, is they’re any evidence of wrongdoing or criminality that would cause you to re-evaluate your support of Trump?
@Toblerone_DOTUS I see you’ve been tracking my thoughts. Very clever.
@thatjennyj @JeremiahOshan I have to believe their intent was to re-brand at time of announcement — or maybe a few days before — and they missed the target.

@brianstelter This is a pretty shameful hit job. I don’t understand why you would elect to amplify this.
@dylanw I made the switch from Delta to Alaska primarily because Alaska doesn’t require a minimum spend to achieve status and my weekly commute keeps me on the west coast. Pricing and on-board experience is comparable. Alaska’s only regional jet (E175) is better than Delta’s CRJs, too.
@blueeyedbuddha That’s pretty cool you guys were able to connect.
@prawn_terrace That’s exactly what I think. They probably have an agreement in principle and the lawyers are still hammering out the final language.

@mjs_DC @Slate Oh my god. She’s a moron. They’re all just really, really stupid people, aren’t they?
Not that Lorem Ipsum is nonsense. But it’s become filler now and has lost meaning. Zulily!
The thing I like about the new partnership is that if you’re not really familiar with Zulily you’d think it was just some nonsense word they put on the front of the jersey. It’d be like if they put Lorem Ipsum there.
@60secondsoffury I mean, you should probably care if it was the KKK.		But yeah, I’m over any concerns I had about Zulily. Those concerns lasted less than 24 hours.
@justicar Do we have any insight into what those sales were? Is it possible they weren’t big enough to consider in comparison to increased sponsorship dollars coming directly from Zulily?

@blueeyedbuddha @LikkitP True. And in any event, remedies would be contemplated in the standard contract language. It’s just a curious situation to me — and one I probably won’t ever think about again after today.
@LikkitP @blueeyedbuddha As someone who negotiates contracts for a living, I assume nothing. I’ve seen it all at this point. But I suspect you’re right.
@LikkitP @blueeyedbuddha I’m really curious what the length of the agreement will be. Zulily hasn’t been the most stable company and QVC could easily pull the plug on them. Would hate to see them dissolve mid-season someday.
@AaronCampeau If I come across one someday I’ll give it a try.

@AaronCampeau @bmvaughn @mkstnr Highly recommend reading Michael Lewis’ new book The Fifth Risk (super quick read). He spent time at several Executive Branch agencies and learned what they’re working on. Our civilization, in many ways, is dependent on the success of some Exec Branch programs. Hanford being one.
@AaronCampeau @bmvaughn @mkstnr Chiming in to reiterate how bad an idea this would be. Even if you think the Executive Branch is too large, do you trust Trump and the GOP to be thoughtful and smart in going about the reductions?
@dylanw I hope it continues but I’m still skeptical that his base will ever abandon him. He’s their religion.
If you’re Trump and you’re desperate to distract from a Meuller report that most think will be delivered within the next few months, is there a better way than to keep the government shut down indefinitely? Manufacture a crisis to distract from a different crisis.

@sportzfrk @turneresq But does a bigger market size necessarily equate to a bigger market capture? PHX is 12th, SAC is 20th. SAC is not a small market — especially considering location in relation to SF/OAK/SJ.

@bmvaughn It’s something I’ve thought for 15+ years and still can’t wrap my head around.
Here’s the book and memorial card. https://t.co/EODXUMnbrd
Some people win the lotto or get struck by lightning. I found a memorial card of a childhood friend in a book borrowed from a friend who borrowed it from his girlfriend — 3,000 miles away and 11 years after I last saw him.
Occasionally I’ll wonder if there is a bigger meaning to this. I don’t think there is.
He was full of life when I knew him — a small kid but spunky and clever. He was just short of a troublemaker when I knew him but had a good heart and a great sense of humor. I wonder what happened that he died under suspicious circumstances.
To this day, that’s all I know. With her permission, I kept the book and the memorial card. I think often about how bizarre and unlikely it was that I learned of Dominic’s death the way I did. Then I think of Dominic.
Carolyn went to high school with Dominic. The high school where I would’ve gone if I hadn’t moved. Dominic died in a car accident but she said there were suspicious circumstances surrounding it that she didn’t really elaborate on.
My friend said he had borrowed the book from his girlfriend who lived in San Francisco. Her name was Carolyn and I had met her once. When we got back to San Francisco I reached out to her.
I immediately asked my friend if he knew Dominic. Not surprisingly, my friend who had been born in London and grew up in Seattle, had no idea who he was.
But he was my friend — his birthday was on Halloween and as kids we thought that was so cool. And somehow sitting in an airport 3,000 miles away from home, 11 years after I last saw him, I learned that he was dead. Had in fact died 3 years earlier.
Dominic and I went to elementary school together. We played on the same little league teams. There was no internet or social media when I moved away to Seattle so I lost touch with him.
I was stunned. I couldn’t quite believe what I was reading. There I was, in a random airline terminal in New York, leafing through a friend’s book because I was bored, and had just discovered the memorial card of a childhood friend in Sacramento.
On the back it said:		“In loving memory of 	Dominic Valentino Saladine	October 31, 1975	August 24, 1997”		There was a prayer and the location of his funeral. Mt. Vernon Mortuary, Fair Oaks, CA.
Except it wasn’t a bookmark really. It was a memorial card — the kind given out at funerals. I took it in my hand. The front was a picture of the Virgin Mary. I flipped it over.
I opened it and began thumbing through it. I kept mindlessly flipping through it until I hit a page where a bookmark was buried.
I looked over at my friend and saw he had pulled out a book but wasn’t reading it. It was titled “Thinking Strategically”. I was bored and asked if I could look at it. He handed it over.
We were sitting on the floor in the terminal looking at our laptops and flip phones. It was crowded. The weather was frigid outside but sweltering inside. In short, everyone was miserable.
One late night I was with a group of co-workers (including my aforementioned Seattle friend) at the Tower Air terminal waiting for our flight to San Francisco. It was delayed because the plane had a broken windshield. They were flying in another plane from Miami.
Tower Air had their own terminal at JFK which sounds swanky but was the furthest thing from it. It was a dump. And Tower Air was never on time.
I was bouncing back and forth between New York and the Bay Area quite a bit and kind of living the dream, to be honest. This was in 1999/2000. Our travel budget was shit, though, so I often flew Tower Air.
That didn’t last long because they called me back to New York to work at HQ in lower Manhattan. I still made shit money but was able to live in a “corporate apartment” on the Upper West Side free of charge. Supposedly, I lived two blocks from Kurt Vonnegut (who I never saw).
I made shit money (but had stock options that I just knew would make me rich) so I lived in a shared house in Berkeley. Besides, I was working so much I lived at the office during the week and only went home on weekends.
This was during the first dot com bubble — people were becoming paper millionaires overnight. So, of course, I jumped at the chance to become a “Community Development and Political Affairs Analyst” at their satellite office in Burlingame, CA.
At 22, eleven years after I had moved away from CA (a lifetime at that age), a friend I made in Seattle called and asked if I’d be interested in joining a startup based in New York.
At the very end of 5th grade, at 11 years old, I moved to a suburb of Seattle where I finished elementary school, junior high, and high school. Then I started college in Seattle.

@AlaskaAir I’ll meet you in the middle — allow me to opt out of a middle seat upgrade.
@AlaskaAir Sorry to be cranky about this but I’ve sat in the middle seat as a G75 way too many times as a result of a fairly hamfisted approach to upgrades. Delta gives middle seat mileage bonuses — perhaps that’s something Alaska could consider?
@AlaskaAir Good morning. There is no situation I can think of, when traveling alone, where getting moved from an aisle seat to a middle seat is considered an upgrade. Went from 10D to 7E. I’d rather buy my own drink than sit in the middle. Please stop.

@WoS I think I could’ve answered the “how” better. As you said, that vertical surface slices through the air — as it does, it smooths the airflow around the wingtip which reduces drag. Lower drag means greater lift which translates to slower takeoff speed and less fuel burn at cruise.
@WoS A standard blended winglet on a 737-800 will also save 3 to 6% or so (longer routes see better performance). Split scimitar winglets will add another 1 to 2% on top of that.
@WoS Put simply, they reduce wingtip vortices which is a major source of drag. Fun fact: Installing winglets on a 767 adds 4,000 pounds to the aircraft. But the drag reduction is so dramatic that fuel savings are still in the 4 to 6% range depending on the route.

@kentsj I didn’t prepare. But I might leave with lederhosen. 		Munich Oktoberfest is the biggest, most drunk county fair you can imagine. Definitely touristy but not annoyingly so (yet).
@kentsj It’s really funny you ask. I’m sitting next to someone who was just talking about Stuttgart. She says Oktoberfest it more fun but Volksfest is definitely worth experiencing. It’s just a huge fair!
So, holy shit, Oktoberfest in Munich is wildly fun. I don’t know why I wasn’t looking forward to this.
@mattbucher That’s really interesting. Everything seems easy here. It’s human scale. Modern but warm and inviting. Expansive public transportation, easy to walk and bike. Also, it’s cheap. 		Basically, I’m sold.
I started my day — the end of a long work week — in Upper Austria. After a detour to Passau I’m now in Munich. Tomorrow is the the start of Oktoberfest here. I admit that I am not prepared. 		(Munich is a really great city, though.)

@dylanw Likewise. But even that early it’s starting to get congested.
@Llarian Fair point.
@Llarian I think Paine could be to SeaTac what John Wayne is to LAX. It’s just going to take a long time.
@mattbucher I have both Clear and Pre-check and it’s saved me more than once.
@Llarian I actually think Paine’s location is good. But their capacity will be so limited initially that Light Rail might be running before it makes any difference for SeaTac.
@mattbucher I feel fortunate I don’t have to endure those. Some of those lines are longer than any I’ve ever seen at Heathrow or CDG.
@allonsyrachel @MikeStandish It’s the yin and yang of commutes.
@Llarian I imagine it will help when they finish the main terminal renovations and again when Alaska finishes the new North terminal. But I don’t think either of those things will help the Departure and Arrival zones.		A second regional airport (Paine) could help but not for awhile.

@ToryHagen The Obama admin found out in September, two months before the election, and the FBI and other intel agencies immediately launched an investigation. Obama wanted to make a joint statement with GOP leadership about Russian meddling but McConnell refused.

@tylsim @deb9266 @CMTMosqueda But it wasn’t just Amazon. Not even close.
@tylsim @deb9266 @CMTMosqueda I seriously question whether this group had any impact at all. This tax was wildly unpopular the day it was announced as a possibility.
@CMTMosqueda I despise Trump and everything he stands for. I also think the head tax was another regressive tax in a city and state already full of them. I’m typical of the people who wanted this tax repealed. So you can miss me with the Trump comparisons, Councilwoman.
@ByRosenberg @antonyfalco @business Conflating Bezos’ net worth with a head tax that would affect certain businesses isn’t helpful. If anything, it only strengthens the argument for a state income tax.
@bmvaughn Interesting. I wonder if that explains why they boarded my flight 20 minutes early this morning. 		In Ontario last week they boarded rows 20 and higher from the back of the place. 19 and lower from the front.
@versingseattle @cmkshama @mudede @SeattleCouncil Look at what’s Boeing’s done over the past 30 years. They’ve reduced headcount in the Puget Sound fairly dramatically due to overhead costs that aren’t as competitive as elsewhere.
@versingseattle @cmkshama @mudede @SeattleCouncil Immediately? Obviously not. But yes, I do think taxes like this can cause companies to alter their mid-range and long-range strategic growth plans. Why add people here at a higher cost when they can add the same caliber of people in [insert city] for a lower cost?
@versingseattle @cmkshama @mudede @SeattleCouncil Whether businesses can afford it or not (agreed, most can) is not the point.
@BallardCoug206 @cmkshama @mudede @SeattleCouncil Totally agreed. But both are terribly regressive approaches. We need a state income tax badly.
@mudede Charles, this is an absurd take. Absolutely ridiculous.
@cmkshama @mudede @SeattleCouncil Do you seriously think that taxing businesses for hiring a lot of people is the right way to fund homelessness programs? I mean, seriously.

@AaronCampeau @nate_bowling @NosAudietis Fair. His response was inartful and I don’t blame him given the context of the interview. But the organization should follow up with something more thorough.
@nate_bowling @AaronCampeau @NosAudietis The Sounders, now that Garth has broached the topic himself, owe the fan base a thorough explanation of what’s driving their cost &amp; revenue and why we can’t compete on payroll. The backlash is deserved until a better explanation is provided.
@JacksonKJR Agreed!
@JacksonKJR Anyway, thanks for the conversation. I appreciate it.
@JacksonKJR I’m not privy to the inputs/pressures that you experience but I think the Sounders need you more than you need them. Just my opinion.
@Toblerone_DOTUS @KING5Seattle Sweet local news, to boot.
@LAFC @LAFC3252 (Pssst...@LAFC3252 were the ones chanting. FYI.)
@JacksonKJR Literally nobody wants you to yell at Garth. Most people would be appreciative of you attempting to have the conversation, though. As you say, there’s a middle ground.
@JacksonKJR @jamesinho4 @the16thdoc @JasonEWU @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio Fair. I’m not asking for the Spanish Inquisition just basic questions relevant to his daily professional existence. He’s the executive of a major-ish sports franchise, not an intern. He can handle it.
@JacksonKJR @jamesinho4 @the16thdoc @JasonEWU @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio I’ll drop it after this: Please don’t treat Garth with kid gloves because you’re afraid of losing access. Good luck.
@the16thdoc 6. In summary, Garth doesn’t actually work for the Sounders and would very much like his red stapler back.
@the16thdoc I hope you’re right that this is a continuation of a pattern but I fear you’re not. 		Maybe we’ll be laughing about this in October. Or at least embarrassed we argued about it.
@the16thdoc We wouldn’t even be having this discussion if we had 14 points instead of 4. I don’t know what my point is with that but I keep typing anyway.
@the16thdoc FTR, I’m not mad at Garth. But it’s totally fair and ok to apply pressure on him in the form of questions about the club’s finances. He’s a big boy. He can handle it. Also, his responses might be interesting.
@JacksonKJR @the16thdoc @JasonEWU @jamesinho4 @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio Jackson, you have a very different audience than that podcast. Ask the basic questions and then let the conversation develop. What budget considerations do they have? Why can’t they compete with Toronto, LA, and NY in the that way? Etc.
@JacksonKJR @the16thdoc @JasonEWU @jamesinho4 @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio How do know unless you ask? He could throw you a curveball but if you don’t ask you’re not addressing the biggest component in roster building. And to me, that makes everything else irrelevant.
@the16thdoc @JacksonKJR @JasonEWU @jamesinho4 @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio YES. Going on the record about where we stand financially against out competition is absolutely relevant and important.
@the16thdoc @JacksonKJR @JasonEWU @jamesinho4 @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio I’m not sure why you want to treat Lagerway differently than GMs in every other professional sports league. I feel like I’m in bizarro world right now.
@the16thdoc @JacksonKJR @JasonEWU @jamesinho4 @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio It doesn’t mean you don’t ask the question. These are standard questions asked of GM’s in all professional sports leagues.
@JacksonKJR @JasonEWU @jamesinho4 @SoundersFC @ExtraTimeRadio Lagerway manages and has input on the budget. He absolutely has insight into the issue and should be able to respond to questions about it. Just like DiPoto and just like Schneider.
@SmashleyFC My big worry is that it’s really an ownership issue. Replacing a GM is pretty straightforward. Replacing ownership...forget about it.
