RT @rob_onderweg: Bieniawski, Doyle and Squassoni discuss @FMWG policy recommendations for #NSS2016 @CSIS
Bieniawski: NSS gift baskets are a powerful tool, e.g. HEU elimination roadmap - @NTI_WMD to draft gift basket
Intern'l nuclear security convention difficult, but at 2014 NSS, growing recognition of need to improve global governance #NSSLegacy
Separated plutonium is also a major risk, stocks should be minimized, comprehensiveness includes plutonium #NSSLegacy
On security culture, despite the importance of nuclear security, there's no certification of security personnel competence #NSSLegacy
Squassoni: should be a way to identify and share non-sensitive info from IPPAS missions #NSSLegacy
Forthcoming matrix of stakeholders, kinds of information, potential constraints, value of sharing, to encourage more information #NSSLegacy
Squassoni: Media has a critical, underused role for public engagement #NSSLegacy
Share information to build global confidence... somewhat counter-intuitive in security, but it's needed for ACCOUNTABILITY #NSSLegacy
Squassoni: my topic, Info-sharing, Standards &amp; Best Practices, and Security Culture, not most exciting, but no less important #NSSLegacy
Military group: most important identify best forum to further discuss among military materials possessing states, recommend P5 #NSSLegacy
States with military materials should provide assurances they have effective security, drawing on past cooperative approaches #NSSLegacy
Must agree to what security requires and commit to specific steps, eg accounting &amp; control capable of detecting theft #NSSLegacy
2 goals for military materials: Achieve effective &amp; sustainable security for all materials; (2) Provide assurances of this fact #NSSLegacy
Doyle: addressing military nuclear materials security is controversial, but important--85% of all stocks in military programs #NSSLegacy
HEU group recommends dedicated international conference on ending civilian use of HEU (after 2016 NSS), possible house gift #NSSLegacy
Proposed Eastern and Central Europe HEU free zone map #NSSLegacy http://t.co/OHN2VGPY9u
Proposed southeast Asian and Australian HEU free zone map #NSSLegacy http://t.co/w8SAzKcfxV
Map of proposed Latin America HEU free zone #NSS - almost cleared out already! #NSSLEGACY http://t.co/fZwKH5S59K
Map of proposed Latin America HEU free zone #NSS - almost cleared out already! Remove/downblend small amount left http://t.co/MZWCXaHbKE
World leaders should make unequivocal political commitments that pave the way to the end of HEU use in civilian/non-weapons use #NSSLegacy
HEU Elimination group says, US should launch major R&amp;D efforts to replace HEU use in naval propulsion #NSSLegacy
Bieniawski: convert remaining civil HEU fueled reactors to LEU by 2035 #NSSLegacy
HEU Free Zones paper http://t.co/NnLLlcKtSs #NSSLegacy
Roadmap to elimation of HEU http://t.co/P1qzrc5KgO #NSSLegacy
Bieniawski: still a huge amount of HEU in the world, that's why we need roadmap to elimination #NSSLegacy
Bieniawski: key to this group's recommendations, HEU ELIMINATION, not just minimization #NSSLegacy
